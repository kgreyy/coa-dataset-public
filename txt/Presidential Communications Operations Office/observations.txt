OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

 

A. Financial and Compliance 
 

Unaccounted inventory items 

 

1. The 800 copies of coffee table books acquired by PCOO for distribution to other 
government agencies totaling P2 million were not accounted as inventory upon 

delivery and were recorded as outright expense upon payment that resulted in 

the non-reporting in the financial statements of the undistributed 342 copies 

amounting to P855,000.00 at year-end, and misstatement of the balance of the 

affected asset and expense accounts. 

 

Section 15 of Chapter 2, Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume I 

state that: 

 

Fair Presentation.  The FS shall present fairly the financial 

position, financial performance and cash flows of an entity.  Fair 

presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of 

transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with the 

definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, 

and expenses set out in the PPSAS. Xxx 

 

On May 29, 2020, PCOO entered into an agreement with National Printing 

Office (NPO) for the printing of 800 copies of Boracay Coffee Table Book amounting 

to P2,000,000.00 or at a price of P2,500.00 per copy.  The books were intended for 

distribution to different government agencies around the Philippines. 

 

Audit of disbursement documents disclosed that the 800 Boracay Coffee Table 

Books were delivered to PCOO as follows: 

 

Delivery Receipt No. Date  Quantity Amount (P) 

0003029 October 30, 2020 20 50,000.00 

0003025 October 29, 2020 780 1,950,000.00 

  Total  800 2,000,000.00 

 

However, there was no entry made recognizing the appropriate inventory 

account upon delivery of the coffee table books.  In this case, the Other Supplies and 

Materials for Distribution account could be used as there was no specific inventory 

held for distribution account for coffee table books prescribed in the GAM.  While 

upon payment, the following journal entry was taken up in the books: 

 

Advertising Expenses P2,000,000.00  

Cash – Modified Disbursement 

System 

 P2,000,000.00 



34 
 

Per Requisition and Issue Slip (RIS) attached to the Disbursement Voucher 

(DV), the 800 copies of the Boracay Coffee Table Books were issued to personnel 

from the Office of Director for Special Projects, the requisitioning office and the one 

in charge of the distribution of the books to different government agencies. 

 

It was learned that the 342 copies of coffee table books remained undistributed 

at year-end. We verbally requested for a copy of the distribution list and actual 

recipients of the coffee table books, for validation purposes but to no avail.   

 

Failure to recognize in the books of accounts the appropriate inventory account 

upon delivery and erroneous recording of the delivered items as outright expense 

resulted in the understatement of the inventory account balance and overstatement of 

the total reported expenses. Consequently, the undistributed books at year-end 

amounting to P855,000.00 was not reported in the agency’s financial statements due 

to accounting error. 

 

Moreover, the receipt and issuances/distribution of the coffee table books were 

no longer accounted in the property records. 

 

We recommended that Management require the: 

 

a. Director, Office of Special Concerns to: (i) explain for the non-
distribution of the 342 copies of the Boracay Coffee Table Book; (ii) 

cause the immediate distribution of the remaining coffee table books 

or turn-over the same to the Property Office for proper control and 

monitoring of the issuances; and (iii) submit to the Audit Team the 

distribution list and actual recipients of the books. 

 

b. Head, Accounting Division to recognize in the books the cost of 
undistributed books through the following journal entry: 

 

       Other Supplies and Materials for Distribution   P855,000.00 

              Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit)                                               P855,000.00 

  

Management informed that the Office of the Secretary Media-Special Projects 

(OMSP) is seeking the kind assistance of the PCOO Records Section for the 

distribution of the remaining coffee table books, especially for bulk deliveries within 

Metro Manila. The main consideration under this arrangement is the availability of 

personnel as well as the vehicle that would be used to transfer the coffee table books. 

 

Restrictions on movements and business operations both in PCOO and other 

agencies due to COVID-19 has caused some delay in the delivery. Moreover, the 

drastic increase in the number of cases since March ultimately halted the distribution. 

 

 

 



35 
 

Audit Team’s Rejoinder: 

 

The Audit Team will monitor the implementation of the audit 

recommendations. Management had provided the distribution list on June 10, 2021 

to be verified by the Audit Team. 

 

 

Erroneous classification of intangible assets 

 

2. Computer software and operating systems (OS) worth P6,950,966.00 were 
erroneously recorded as Information and Communication Technology 

Equipment (ICTE), thus, were depreciated with residual value of at least five 

percent amounting to P695,096.60, contrary to Chapter 12, Volume I of GAM 

providing that intangible assets shall be amortized with zero residual value.  

Moreover, obsolete and expired computer software with total cost of at least 

P987,500.00 were not derecognized in the books. These deficiencies resulted in 

the misstatement of the balances of the accounts Computer Software, ICTE and 

related depreciation.  

 
As defined in Chapter 12, Volume I of the GAM, “Intangible Assets are 

identifiable non-monetary asset without physical substance, common examples of 
which, are computer software, patents, copyrights, franchise, motion picture films, 
trademarks or brand names, licenses, etc.  An intangible asset shall be derecognized 
on disposals or when no future economic benefits or service potential are expected 
from its use or disposal.” 

 

Volume III of the GAM prescribes that “the account Computer Software is 

used to recognize the purchase cost or capitalized development cost of computer 

software programs for use in government operation. Development costs include cost 

of coding, testing and cost to produce product masters. Credit this account for 

obsolesce, transfers or other disposal.” 

 

The same Chapter of the GAM, Volume I, further provides the following: 

 

• Intangible assets are classified as having: (a) Indefinite 
life – no foreseeable limit to the period over which the asset 

is expected to generate net cash inflows for, or provides 

service potential to, the entity; and (b) Finite life – a 

limited period of benefit to the entity. 

 

• An intangible asset with a finite useful life is amortized 
on a straight-line method while an intangible asset with an 

indefinite useful life shall not be amortized. 

 

• The depreciable amount of an intangible asset with a finite 
useful life shall be allocated on a systematic basis over its 

useful life. As a guideline, the finite useful life of intangible 



36 
 

assets shall be 2 to 10 years. Amortization shall begin when 

the asset is available for use, i.e., when it is in the location 

and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in 

the manner intended by management. 

 

• The residual value of an intangible asset with a finite 
useful life shall be assumed to be zero.  

 

Review of the accounting records and Report of Physical Count on Property, 

Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) for the CY 2020 revealed that computer software 

and OS totaling to P6,950,966.00 were erroneously recorded/classified as   ICTE. As 

such, these intangible assets were depreciated, just like any other PPE, with residual 

value of at least five percent of the cost.  Thus, overstating the Accumulated 

Depreciation-ICTE account and understating Accumulated Surplus account by 

P695,096.60, the details of which is shown in the table below.  

 

In addition, inquiry disclosed that computer software with total cost of at least 

P987,500.00 and which could no longer provide economic benefits to the agency due 

to obsolescence and expired subscriptions were not derecognized in the books. 

 

The table below shows the details of intangible assets that were erroneously 

classified as ICTE.

Grand Total   6,950,966.00 695,096.60 6,255,869.40 

 

The accounting treatment of those intangible assets as ICTE and non-

derecognition of obsolete/expired software were contrary to the above-mentioned 

accounting standards.  

 

The accounting errors also resulted in the overstatement of the ICTE account 

with corresponding understatement of the Computer Software account by 

P5,963,466.00 (net of obsolete/expired software).  Accordingly, the Accumulated 

Depreciation account was overstated while the Accumulated Surplus account was 

understated by P6,255,869.40.   

 

We recommended that Management instruct the Accountant to: 

 

a. Reclassify those computer software and OS still in use to the proper 
account, and make corresponding adjustments on the ICTE and 

related depreciation accounts;  

 

b. Derecognize in the books those intangible assets that were already 
expired/obsolete; and 

  

c. Amortize the intangible assets in accordance with Chapter 12, 
Volume I of the GAM. 



38 
 

Management Comment: 

 

Items which work together in the form of a group of network assets can be 

recognized as part of the primary Property, Plant and Equipment. It is in this context 

that all computer software and operating system which were connected to the 

computer hardware were recognized and recorded as ICTE, and were depreciated 

together with the computer hardware with a residual value of five (5) percent.  

 

Moreover, computer software which no longer provide economic benefits to 

the agency due to obsolescence and expired subscriptions were not derecognized as 

it is awaiting disposal of computer units. The Accounting Division made the 

appropriate adjustments in the books, as recommended, as provided in the JEV nos. 

21-03-101, 21-03-102 and 2103-103. 

 

Last 14 May 2021, the PCOO through its Disposal and Awards Committee 

(DAC), disposed 43 unserviceable IT equipment and other appliances through a 

public action with proceeds amounting to P41,610.00. We have attached the Deed of 

Absolute Sale and Notice of Award for reference. 

 

Audit Team’s Rejoinder: 

 

The Audit Team will monitor the implementation of the audit recommendations 

and will validate the adjustment made by the Accounting Division in the books, as 

recommended, as provided in the JEV nos. 21-03-101, 21-03-102 and 2103-103. 

 

 

 Unreliable Due from GOCCs account  

 

3. The Due from GOCCs account’s balance amounting to P83,641,281.91 is 
unreliable as there was no corresponding balance of unliquidated fund transfer 

in the books of the implementing agency, the People’s Television. Network, Inc. 

(PTNI), based on confirmation from its Resident Auditor caused by non-

reconciliation of records.  

 

Section 15, Chapter 2, Volume I of GAM, requires fair presentation of the 

financial statement, to wit: 

 

The FSs shall present fairly the financial position, financial 

performance and cash flows of an entity.  Fair presentation requires 

the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other 

events and conditions, in accordance with the definitions and 

recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses 

set out in the PPSAS. xxx 

 

On October 25, 2012, the PCOO entered a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) 

with PTNI for the release of funding support for the PTNI’s Revitalization Program 



39 
 

in the amount P342,536,605.00 from the Disbursement Acceleration Program (DAP) 

Fund of PCOO. 

 

Records showed that from CYs 2012 to 2014, PCOO transferred funds to PTNI 

a total amount of P342,136,605.00 for the said program. As at December 31, 2020, 

the transferred funds recorded under the Due form GOCCs account had a balance of 

P83,641,281.91 in the books of the PCOO. 

 

It may be mentioned that per our confirmation from the Resident Auditor of 

PTNI in CY 2018, PTNI had utilized the amount of P293,134,700.49 from said fund 

transfers as of December 31, 2014, and returned the unused balance of 

P49,001,904.51 to the Bureau of Treasury (BTr) per Official Receipt No. 2545491 

dated May 22, 2017, signifying that the total fund transfer was fully accounted for, 

thus, has no more balance in the PTNI books.  

 

The above information on the status of said fund transfer was contained in the 

CY 218 AAR on PCOO wherein the Audit Team recommended that Management 

demand from PTNI the submission of liquidation reports, reconcile its records with 

PTNI, prepare necessary adjusting entries, and close the DAP Fund account 

pertaining to the PTNI Revitalization Program.  

 

Management had made several follow-ups through phone calls and sent 

demand letters to PTNI for the submission of liquidation reports, but to no avail. Per 

verification, the last demand letter sent in CY 2020 was on August 7, 2020.   

 

The PCOO Accountant furnished the Audit Team with copy of PTNI letter to 

PCOO dated August 10, 2020 affirming that it had already submitted the liquidation 

to their resident COA Auditor.  He also provided the PTNI Audit Team Leader’s 

reply to PTNI that retrieval of Reports of Disbursements relative to the Revitalization 

Funds will require some time since the reports covering the period CY 2012 to 2014 

have already been transferred to their bodega. 

 

In view of the lack of the required reports, the PCOO Accountant has yet to 

record the liquidation of the balance of P83,641,281.91, hence, remained outstanding 

in the PCOO books of accounts.  

 

However, considering the PTNI Resident Auditor’s confirmation that the 

amount of P293,134,700.49 was utilized out of the PCOO transferred funds and the 

unused balance of P49,001,904.51 was already returned to BTr, the same would 

suffice as basis in recording the liquidation of the remaining balance of fund transfer 

amounting to P83,641,281.91 in the PCOO books, in order to close the receivable 

account from PNTI with regard to the Revitalization Program funds, and to fairly 

present the Due from GOCCs account in the financial statement.   

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to 

closely coordinate with the Accountant of the PTNI to reconcile the records of 



40 
 

the inter-agency fund transfer, and thereafter prepare the necessary journal 

entry as applicable.   

 

 

Unrecognized expenses paid from funds received from other agencies  

 

4. Expenses totaling P12,374,291.16 paid out of the funds received from other 
agencies were not recognized in the PCOO’s books of accounts but were 

recorded, instead, as a direct charge to the Due to NGAs account, contrary to 

Annex M, Volume I of GAM for NGAs. 

 

Annex M of Volume I, GAM, prescribes the illustrative accounting entries for 

transactions involving inter-agency transferred funds. As provided therein, the 

following transactions shall be recorded in the Implementing Agency’s books of 

accounts, as shown below: 

 

a. Payment of expenses 
 

Appropriate Expense Account xxx  

     Cash – Modified Disbursement System (MDS), Trust  xxx 

     Others   xxx 

 

 

b. Adjustment for expenses chargeable to liability (Due to NGA) at year end. 
  

Due to NGAs  xxx  

       Appropriate Expense Account  xxx 

        Others  xxx 

 

In CY 2020, the agency paid various expenses totaling P12,374,291.16 

chargeable to funds received from other agencies for the implementation of special 

projects, as follows: 

 
Source Agency  Project Amount (P) 

Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency – Inter-

Agency Committee on Anti-Illegal Drugs 

Rehabinasyon 1,626,853.23 

Department of Interior and Local 

Government

Government Procurement Policy Board  Procurement Online 

Learning System 

1,766,543.54 

           Total 12,374,291.16 

 
However, review of Journal Entry Vouchers (JEVs) revealed that the expenses 

were recorded as a direct charge to the Due to NGAs account, thus, were not 

recognized in the PCOO’s books of accounts, contrary to Annex M of Volume 1, 

GAM. 



41 
 

Due to non-recognition of expenses, actual transactions incurred out of the 

inter-agency transferred funds were not reflected in the financial reports of the 

PCOO. 

 

We recommended that Management direct the Accounting Division to 

properly record the transactions involving inter-agency transferred funds in 

accordance with the journal entries prescribed in the GAM. 

 

Management Comment: 

 

Management commented that the total amount of the inter-agency transferred 

fund received by the PCOO were all credited to the Due to NGAs account since no 

itemized expense accounts were provided by the Source Agency (SA), all 

transactions incurred were directly charged to Due to NGAs accounts. At month end, 

Reports of Disbursement were submitted to SA to liquidate the disbursements made 

by PCOO. 

 

Management acknowledged the recommendation presented regarding the 

proper recording of transactions involving inter-agency transferred funds and will 

implement the soonest, as discussed with Accounting Division. 

 

 

Undisposed unserviceable properties 

 

5. Unserviceable properties totaling P4,928,817.22 remained undisposed at year-
end contrary to Section 79 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445, thus, denying 

the government of potential income, in case of sale.  However, the unserviceable 

properties were not specifically identified in the RPCPPE while the IIRUP was 

not updated.   

 

Section 79 of PD No. 1445 states that: 

 

Destruction or sale of unserviceable property. When government 

property has become unserviceable for any cause, or is no longer 

needed, it shall, upon application of the officer accountable 

therefor, be inspected by the head of the agency or his duly 

authorized representative in the presence of the auditor 

concerned and, if found to be valueless or unsalable, it may be 

destroyed in their presence. If found to be valuable, it may be 

sold at public auction to the highest bidder under the supervision 

of the proper committee an award or similar body in the presence 

of the auditor concerned or other duly authorized representative 

of the Commission, xxx.  

 



42 
 

Section 40 (d) of Chapter 10, GAM, Volume I also provides that “all 

unserviceable property shall be reported in the Inventory and Inspection Report of 

Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) (Appendix 74).”   

 

The RPCPPE shall contain, among others, the following information:  

   

Article – Type of items or article 

Description – brief description of the article/item 

Property Number – assigned property number by the Supply 

and/or Property Division/Unit 

Unit Measure – unit of measurement of the property, plant and 

equipment 

Unit Value – cost per quantity unit 

Quantity-Per Property Card – quantity of items or articles 

appearing in the PC 

Quantity-Per Physical Count – quantity of items or articles per 

physical count 

Shortage/Overage – excess of the quantity and total value of items 

or articles per PPELC over that of the 

physical count or vice versa 

 

The agency’s RPCPPE for CY 2020 showed unserviceable properties under 

Other PPE classification, in the amount of P4,928,817.22 representing 89 percent of 

the total cost of the Other PPE amounting to P5,523,990.57.  

 

However, the unserviceable properties were not specifically described in the 

RPCPPE but were reported as single lot and was labelled as Office 

Equipment/Furniture and Fixture/IT Equipment/Motor Vehicles. The other required 

information on the PPE were not indicated in the RPCPPE.   

 

When asked for the specific details of the unserviceable properties, 

Management submitted a copy of the unsigned copy of IIRUP as of December 31, 

2017 which included the following unserviceable PPE amounting to P4,509,533.53 

only, as shown below: 

 

Particulars Amount (P) 

Office Equipment 1,583,588.00 

Information Technology 2,461,889.35 

Communication Equipment 464,056.18 

Total 4,509,533.53 

 

The IIRUP should have been updated to include unserviceable properties that 

were added to the RPCPPE as of December 31, 2020.    

 

Management inaction to dispose the unserviceable properties denied the 

government of the potential income that may be derived, in case of sale.  Also, the 



43 
 

space/area occupied by the unserviceable properties could have been used for other 

beneficial purposes. 

 

The absence of adequate information about the RPCPPE and updated IIRUP 

would cause difficulty in the Audit Team’s validation of the reported unserviceable 

properties.   

 

We recommended that Management require: 

 

a. The Inventory Committee to: (i) specifically identify the reported 
unserviceable properties; and (ii) henceforth, properly accomplish 

the RPCPPE ensuring that the required information/data are 

provided therein; 

 

b. The Property Officer to update the IIRUP to include all 
unserviceable properties; and 

 

c. The Disposal Committee to immediately undertake the proper 
disposition of unserviceable properties. 

 

Management Comment: 

 

The unserviceable properties were not specifically identified in the RPCPPE 

due to improper and incomplete turnover of documents and lack of clear list of 

pending action items from previous personnel of the Property and Supply Section. 

 

To remedy the situation, the Chief of General Services Division through the 

Head of Property and Supply Section assigned two (2) personnel of the Property and 

Supply Section dedicated to conduct physical inspection and inventory of 

unserviceable items to revise the RPCPPE to include details and update the IIRUP. 

The original target completion date which was in the fourth (4th) week of May was 

not met and will be extended due to the ongoing office transfer of the PCOO. 

However, this will be prioritized the soonest. 

 

Audit Team’s Rejoinder: 

 

The Audit Team will monitor the implementation of the audit 

recommendations. 

 

 

Hiring of private lawyer without OSG’s conformity and COA’s concurrence  

 

6. PCOO engaged the services of a private lawyer without the written conformity 
and acquiescence of the Solicitor General and the written concurrence of the 

Commission, and despite having a legal office, in violation of COA Circular no. 



44 
 

95-011 dated December 4, 1995, thus, related expenditures were considered 

irregular and unnecessary. 

 

COA Circular no. 95-011 dated December 4, 1995 states that: 

 

Xxx. public funds shall not be utilized for payment of the services 

of a private legal counsel or law firm to represent government agencies 

in court or to render legal services for them. In the event that such legal 

services cannot be avoided or is justified under extraordinary or 

exceptional circumstances, the written conformity and acquiescence of 

the Solicitor General or the Government Corporate Counsel, as the case 

may be, and the written concurrence of the Commission on Audit shall 

first be secured before the hiring or employment of a private lawyer or 

law firm. 

 

The same Circular also quoted the decision of the Supreme Court in the case 

of the Municipality of Pililla, Rizal vs. Court of Appeals, et. al., GR No. 105909, 

promulgated on June 28, 1994, and stated that said decision clearly indicates that, 

where a government agency is provided by law with a legal officer or office who or 

which can handle its legal requirements or cases in courts, it (agency) may not be 

allowed to hire the services of private lawyers for a fee, chargeable against public 

funds, unless under exceptional or extraordinary circumstances. 

 

Records showed that PCOO engaged the services of Atty. Ma. Jovi Patricio 

Jore as Attorney II for the period from October 15, 2020 to December 31, 2020 at a 

rate of P42,159.00 per month. Per related contract of service (COS), she shall render 

services under the Office of Undersecretary for Administration and Legal Affairs 

with the following functions and responsibilities: 

 

a.      Act as prosecutor on behalf of the agency in relation to 
administrative and criminal cases; 

b.      Draft administrative and criminal complaints, position 
papers, comments and other relevant legal documents on 

behalf of the agency; 

c.      Draft Memoranda, Office Orders and all other internal and 
external issuances of the agency; 

d.      Draft and review Memoranda of Agreement and/or 
Understanding, contracts, legal forms and other related 

documents to be entered into by the agency; 

e.       Provide legal opinion in relation to administrative and legal 
inquires; 

f.       Review administrative and legal matters of agency to be 
presented before the Undersecretary for Legal Affairs for his 

signature; and 

g.      Perform all other related functions as may be delegated by the 
immediate supervisor.

It was disclosed, however, that the hiring of Atty. Jore was without the written 

conformity and acquiescence of the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) as well as 

the written concurrence of the COA, in violation of COA Circular No. 95-011. 

Besides, PCOO has a legal office which could have handled its legal requirements. 

 

COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012 defines the following 

expenditures, to wit: 

 

"Irregular expenditure" signifies an expenditure incurred without 

adhering to established rules, regulations, procedural guidelines, 

policies, principles or practices that have gained recognition in 

laws. Irregular expenditures are incurred if funds are disbursed 

without conforming with prescribed usages and rules of discipline. 

Xxx. A transaction conducted in a manner that deviates or departs 

from, or which does not comply with standards set is deemed 

irregular. A transaction which fails to follow or violates appropriate 

rules of procedure is, likewise, irregular. 

 

"Unnecessary expenditures” pertains to expenditures which could 

not pass the test of prudence or the diligence of a good father of a 

family, xxx. This would also include incurrence of expenditure not 

dictated by the demands of good government xxx.  An expenditure 

that is not essential or that which can be dispensed with without 

loss or damage to property is considered unnecessary. 

 

In view of the lack of the required actions from the OSG and considering that 

PCOO has legal office, the hiring of a private lawyer and payment of her salaries 

totaling P105,397.50 were deemed irregular and unnecessary. 

 

We recommended that Management: 

 

a. Hold the concerned agency officials who signed/approved the COS, 
approved the payments, and certified as to the necessity and 

lawfulness of the expenses and completeness of supporting documents 

liable for the refund of salaries of the private lawyer in view of the 

noted deficiencies; and 

 

b. Ensure that the requirements and other conditions under COA 
Circular No. 95-011 are complied with before engaging the services of 

a private lawyer. 

 

Management Comment: 

 

Management commented that the engagement of Atty. Ma. Jovi Patricio Jore 

as Contract of Service (COS) personnel, for the period of 15 October 2020 to 31 

December 2020, does not fall within the contemplated intent of COA Circular No. 



46 
 

95-011. Atty. Jore in fact merely provided assistance to the Office of the 

Undersecretary for Legal Affairs in the latter’s preparation and/or review of legal 

documents. In no instance did Atty. Jore represent the PCOO or serve as counsel 

thereof in any legal case, be it before the courts or quasi-judicial bodies. 

 

Further, the engagement of Atty. Jore as COS personnel by the Legal Office is 

appropriate, urgent and necessary in view of the lack of plantilla legal positions under 

this Office, in turn providing adequate and direct assistance to the Undersecretary 

for Legal Affairs. 

 

It is settled that unnecessary expenditures are those not supportive of the 

implementation of the objectives and mission of the agency relative to the nature of 

its operation. These also include incurring expenditures which are not dictated by the 

demands of good government, and those the utility of which cannot be ascertained 

at a specific time. Verily, an expenditure that is not essential or that which can be 

dispensed with without loss or damage to property is considered unnecessary. 

 

Given the growing need of the agency for manpower particularly during these 

uncertain times, it is deemed essential for the Office of the Undersecretary for Legal 

Affairs to be fully capacitated so that it may deliver the required tasks with efficiency 

and effectiveness. It is under these circumstances, due to the foregoing demand and 

in the exigency of the service, that Atty. Jore was hired. 

 

Pursuant to the aforementioned definition of an unnecessary expenditure, it is 

indubitable that the hiring of Atty. Jore cannot be deemed as an unnecessary 

expenditure. 
 
Likewise, the hiring of Atty. Jore cannot be deemed irregular, inasmuch as the 

Honorable Commission affirms and recognizes that government agencies are 

permitted to hire private lawyers. An expenditure is irregular if it was incurred 

without adhering to established rules and regulations. 
 

Moreover, in the subject AOM, it was recommended that concerned officials 

who approved the hiring of Atty. Jore should be made liable to refund the salaries 

received by Atty. Jore. 
 
A public official shall be made liable to refund the salaries received by a 

private lawyer only when he acted in bad faith. The concerned officials who 

approved the hiring of and payment of salaries to Atty. Jore were in the honest belief 

that the PCOO was authorized to hire a private lawyer. Having acted in good faith, 

the approving officers of the PCOO cannot be held liable to refund the salaries 

granted to Atty. Jore. This is consistent with the recent pronouncement of the 

Supreme Court in Madera v. COA: 2 
 



47 
 

1.  If a Notice of Disallowance is set aside by the Court, no 

return shall be required from any of the persons held liable 

therein. 
 
2. If a Notice of Disallowance is upheld, the rules on return are 

as follows: 
 
a. Approving and certifying officers who acted in good faith, in 

regular performance of official functions, and with the diligence of a 

good father of the family are not civilly liable to return consistent with 

Section 38 of the Administrative Code of 1987.” (Emphasis Supplied) 

 
In the case of Development Bank of the Philippines vs. Commission on Audit 

3 , the Supreme Court synthesized recent jurisprudence on COA disallowances to 

provide the requisites in appreciating good faith on the part of officers responsible 

for the disallowed disbursement, to wit: (1) they acted in good faith believing that 

they could disburse the disallowed amounts based on the provisions of the law; and 

(2) that they lacked knowledge of facts or circumstances which would render the 

disbursement illegal, such when there is no similar ruling by this Court prohibiting 

a particular disbursement or when there is no clear and unequivocal law or 

administrative order barring the same. 
 

In sum, it is respectfully submitted that the engagement of Atty. Jore as contract 

of service personnel under this Office was proper and necessary. The concerned 

Officials who hired Atty. Jore on behalf of the PCOO cannot be made liable for the 

salaries granted to her since they acted in good faith and engaged her pursuant to 

applicable rules and regulations. Accordingly, this Office respectfully requests that 

the Honorable Auditors reconsider their findings/recommendations in AOM No. 

2020-004. 

 

Audit Team’s Rejoinder: 

 

The Audit Team maintains that the contract of service of Atty. Jore falls within 

the scope of the prohibition under COA Circular No. 95-011 which covers the hiring 

of private legal counsel or law firm to represent government agencies in court or to 

render legal services for them. It is informed that said Circular amended/modified 

COA Circular 86-55 which deals on the same subject, where the latter directed that 

the payment out of public funds of retainer fees to private law practitioners who are 

so hired or employed without the prior written conformity and acquiescence of the 

Solicitor General or the Government Corporate Counsel, as the case may be, as well 

as the written concurrence of the Commission on Audit shall be disallowed in audit 

and the same shall be a personal liability of the officials concerned. 

 

Moreover, it is important to note that the intent of said Circular is to curb the 

observed and persistent violation of existing laws and regulations pertaining to the 

engagement of private lawyers on contractual basis in government agencies which 



48 
 

involves the disbursement of public funds by subjecting the same to the conformity 

and concurrence requirements of said Circular. 

 

In the case of DR. WENIFREDO T. OÑATE, Petitioner, v. COMMISSION 

ON AUDIT, G.R. No. 213660, July 05, 2016, the Supreme Court (SC) declared that 

the prohibition under COA Circular No. 95-011 covers the hiring of private lawyers 

to render any form of legal service - whether or not the legal services to be performed 

involve an actual legal controversy or court litigation. The purpose is to curtail the 

unauthorized and unnecessary disbursement of public funds to private lawyers for 

services rendered to the government, which is in line with the COA's constitutional 

mandate to promulgate accounting and auditing rules and regulations, including 

those for the prevention and disallowance of irregular, unnecessary, excessive, 

extravagant or unconscionable expenditures or uses of government funds and 

properties.  

 

          Also, the SC has invariably sustained the statutory authority of the OSG and 

the OGCC as well as the necessity of COA concurrence in the hiring of private lawyer 

by government agencies, and see no legal justification to deviate from the settled 

jurisprudence. Indeed, when a government entity engages the legal services of private 

counsel or law firm, it must do so with the necessary authorization required by law; 

otherwise, its officials bind themselves to be personally liable for compensating such 

legal services.  

 

In view of the above-cited SC decision, the PCOO officials who approved the 

COS of Atty. Jore and the corresponding payment of her services without the 

required acquiescence of the OSG and COA’s concurrence should be held liable 

therefor.  

 

 

Deficiencies in the implementation of MOA for PhilSys Project 

 

7. The implementation of activities under the MOA between the PCOO and PSA 
as well as the utilization of the PSA transferred funds for the PhilSys project 

were with deficiencies as follows: (a) fund received from PSA amounting to 

₱93,900,000.00 had been idle for more than one year due to the non-transfer of 

funds to PIA and PTNI, and the non-implementation of the planned  activities 

for Mainstream Media such as media placements in Top TV, radio stations and 

others; (b) PCOO has yet to hire personnel for the Monitoring Division of the 

PCOO PhilSys Project Team; hence submission of required  reports by the 

Implementing Agencies (IAs) was not being closely monitored; and (c) the 

related Report of Disbursements (RDs) submitted to the Audit Team were not 

supported with documents; thus, validity of expenditures charged against the 

PSA transferred funds could not be ascertained. 

 

PCOO is mandated to serve as the premier arm of the Executive Branch in 

engaging and involving the citizenry and the mass media in order to enrich the quality 



49 
 

of public discourse on all matters of governance and build a national consensus 

thereon. 

 

Its mission is to serve as the primary vehicle for consciousness-raising, 

constituency-building, and social mobilization in support of the policies, programs 

and projects of the Presidency and a tool for informing, educating, enlightening the 

citizenry about matters of national importance for inspiring the citizenry to deepen 

their civic engagement. 

 

Republic Act (RA) No. 11055, otherwise known as the Philippine 

Identification System Act or the “PhilSys”, aims to establish a single national 

identification system for all citizens and resident aliens of the Republic of the 

Philippines to promote seamless service delivery of services, enhance administrative 

governance, reduce corruption and curtail bureaucratic red tape, avert fraudulent 

transactions and misrepresentations, strengthen financial inclusion, an promote ease 

of doing business.  

 

On April 8, 2019, PSA entered into a MOA with PCOO with validity until 

December 31, 2020, where the latter will handle the information production and 

campaigns, advertising placements, public relations, regional advocacy, and research 

and feedback mechanism requirements of the PhilSys with an approved budget of 

P419,563,200.00, broken down as follows:

As provided in the MOA, the said budgetary requirements shall be transferred 

by the PSA to PCOO under the following terms:

Total 100 419,563,200.00    

 

The 1st tranche of P209,781,600.00 was received by the PCOO on June 25, 

2019. As of December 31, 2020, the following amounts were transferred by the 

PCOO to its attached agencies: 

 

Agency Check No. Date Transferred Amount (P) 

NPO 1010372 November 18, 2019 12,600,000.00

PBS-BBS 1010364 October 30, 2019 25,200,000.00 

Total 73,200,000.00 

 

 

a)       Idle funds for over a year 

 

The amount of P93,900,000.00 had been idle in PCOO for more than one year 

due to the non-transfer of funds to PIA and PTNI, and the non-implementation of the 

planned activities for the Mainstream Media, such as media placements in Top TV, 

radio stations and others. 

 

Of the PSA 1st tranche transferred funds of P209,781,600.00 representing 50 

percent of the approved budget for the PhilSys Project, P93,900,000.00 was allocated 

to PTNI, PIA and to Mainstream Media as shown below: 

 
Agency Responsibility Allocation (P) 

PIA -Provincial Roadshows 

-Information kiosks 

12,600,000.00  

PTNI -Production of broadcast materials 

-Advertising Placements 

21,000,000.00  

Mainstream Media 60,300,000.00  

Grand Total   93,900,000.00  



51 
 

It was disclosed, however, in the letter of the Director for Special Projects that 

the allocated fund for PTNI was not transferred by the PCOO because PTNI has yet 

to fully liquidate the prior fund transfers, while the fraud audit being conducted on 

special projects previously handled by PIA prevented PCOO from downloading the 

funds for PhilSys Project to PIA. 

 

Likewise, the allocated fund for the Mainstream Media was not utilized as at 

year-end, signifying that the related activities have yet to be accomplished. It was 

noted that per report of the PCOO PhilSys Project Team, only few significant 

activities were accomplished for Phase 1 of the project and there was no reported 

activity for the Mainstream Media.  It was explained that the delays in the 

implementation of the planned activities were mainly attributable to the presence of 

the Covid-19 pandemic, specifically from March 2020 to present. However, it is 

noteworthy to mention that as provided in the MOA, the implementation of the first 

phase of the PhilSys Project is from April to November 2019 or for a period of eight 

months.  Considering that the date of receipt by PCOO of the fund from PSA is June 

2019, the expected deliverables/services should have already been accomplished by 

the PCOO and other IAs even before the pandemic. 

 

It was only on December 10, 2020 that an amended MOA, with validity until 

May 31, 2021, was executed by PSA and PCOO, which contains the major changes 

in the original MOA, cited as follows: 

 

a. Removed PIA and PTNI; 
b. Included Presidential Broadcast Staff-Radio Television 

Malacañang (PBS-RTVM) as part of the MOA; 

c. Reallocated the majority of the budget to PBS-BBS, NPO and 
RTVM; and 

d. Majority of the activities are now digital or will be through digital 
means due to the pandemic. 

 

Accordingly, the project fund was reallocated for the following activities and 

timelines: 

 

Agency Activities Allocation (P) 

PCOO -Overseeing and Implementation of the 

campaign 

-Production and Content 

-Creative and Content Curation

52,400,000.00  

PBS-RTVM 2,000,000.00  

Grand Total  419,563,200.00  

 

Based on the review done, from the time of receipt of fund from PSA in June 

2019 until the end of CY 2020 or for a period of more than one year, a total of 

P93,900,000.00 remained idle in PCOO.  

 

We recommended that Management: 

 

a. Accelerate the implementation of the activities for the PhilSys 
communications campaign throughout the country ensuring that the 

project is completed as planned/scheduled; 

 

b. Develop other plans/strategies on information campaign appropriate 
during this pandemic; and 

 

c. Immediately address the issues/problems that may arise during the 
project implementation to avoid occurrence of idle funds. 

 

Management commented that as for the implementation of the communications 

campaign, the PCOO and its attached agencies, as servicing communications 

agencies of the PSA, are highly dependent on the directives and instructions of the 

PSA in the execution of the communications plan.  

 

Management further explained that in cases when PSA feels that a scheduled 

communication action plan should be deferred or delayed by reason of 

appropriateness or timing, for instance, then the PCOO is left without recourse but 

to accede to the former’s instruction. 

 

 

b)      Lack of personnel in the Monitoring Division of PCOO’s PhilSys Project Team 

 

The PCOO has yet to hire personnel for the Monitoring Division of the PCOO 

PhilSys Project Team; hence, submission of required reports by IAs was not being 

properly monitored. 

 



53 
 

Item 1, Section II. Responsibilities of the PCOO under General 

Responsibilities of the MOA states that the PCOO shall monitor the implementation 

of the project as regards their attached agencies. Item 3 provides that the PCOO shall 

manage, monitor, and execute, together with the PSA, the implementation of the 

Services under the MOA. It further provides that the PCOO shall: 

 

(a) Submit to the PSA, on a monthly basis, a liquidation 
report on all expenses made in relation to the execution of 

activities under the Agreement 

(b) Submit to the PSA, on a monthly basis, progress reports 
on the undertakings under the Agreement 

 

In like manner, the MOA entered into by the PCOO with the other IAs requires 

the latter to:  

 

(a) liquidate to PCOO, on a monthly basis, all expenses made 
in relations to the execution of activities under the MOA; 

and 

 

(b) submit to the PCOO on a monthly basis, progress reports 
for work or projects undertaken relative to the execution 

of the activities of the MOA. 

 

Based on the submitted organizational chart, the PhilSys Project Team shall be 

composed of seven (7) Divisions, with the following proposed manning and actual 

personnel complement: 

 

The four personnel under the Monitoring Division are two Information 

Officers, one Information Systems Analyst and one Computer Programmer.  Per 

letter dated November 25, 2020 of the Director for Special Projects in response to 

our Audit Query No. 2020-001, there are still no hired personnel under the 

Monitoring Division. However, no reason was offered why no personnel was hired 

to man the Monitoring Division.

In the same letter of the Director for Special Projects, it was stated that the 

PCOO is in the process of requesting progress reports from the attached agencies for 

the summary of the deliverables of the project. This is an admission that the 

submission of the monthly reports was not strictly required. 

 

We recommended that Management require the Director of the PhilSys 

Project Team to give utmost importance to the monitoring of the reports 

required under the MOA with PSA and its attached agencies by:  

 

a. Assigning personnel in the Monitoring Division; and 
 

b. Close monitoring of the submission of the monthly reports by the 
PCOO to PSA and by the attached agencies to PCOO. 

 

Management replied that it will direct the official concerned to proceed with 

the hiring of the necessary personnel for the Monitoring Division. In the meantime, 

the official concerned shall temporarily designate existing personnel to perform 

monitoring functions, as required. 

 

Further, a monitoring tool is being developed by the office of the official 

concerned, in order to implement an effective and seamless monitoring of the outputs 

of the attached agencies. 



55 
 

c)      RDs not supported with documents 

 

The submitted RDs to the Audit Team were not supported with the necessary 

documents, thus, validity of expenditures could not be ascertained. 

 

Section 63, items (f) and (i) on the Disbursement for Inter-Agency Transferred 

Funds (IATF), Chapter 6 of GAM, Volume I state that: 

 

Within ten (10) days after the end of each month/end of the agreed 

period for the Project, the IA shall submit the RCI and the RCDisb 

to report the utilization of the funds. Only actual project expenses 

shall be reported. The reports shall be approved by the Head of 

the IA.  

 

The implementing agency Auditor shall audit the disbursements 

out of the trust accounts in accordance with existing COA 

Regulations. 

 
While Section 4(6) of PD No. 1445 states that: 

 
Claims against government funds shall be supported with 

complete documentation. 

 

As of date, PCOO had submitted to the Audit Team the RDs covering the 

period from August 2019 to October 2020 involving a total amount of P8,016,909.70 

that were charged against the PSA transferred funds, as shown below:

Total     8,016,909.70    



56 
 

The submitted RDs, however, were not supported with documentary 

requirements applicable to the reported expenditures; thus, validity thereof could not 

be ascertained. 

 

We recommended that Management require the Chief Accountant to:  

 

a. immediately submit the necessary documents to support the 
reported disbursements charged against the PSA transferred funds; 

and 

 

b.  henceforth, ensure that the succeeding RDs to be submitted to the 

Audit Team are supported with proper documentary requirements.  

 

Management commits to attach the supporting documents to the submitted RDs 

and to support the succeeding RDs with the necessary documents.  

 

The Audit Team will continue to monitor the implementation of the PCOO 

activities for the PhilSys communication campaign and will conduct post-audit of the 

related disbursements upon receipt of the transaction documents. 

 

 

Hiring of numerous COS personnel 

 

8. PCOO hired a total of 375 COS personnel in CY 2020 which was 260.42 per cent 
way above the total number of its regular employees. However, the necessity of 

hiring such number of COS personnel, for which a total amount of 

P70,688,830.39 was spent by PCOO for their salaries, could not be established 

due to absence of the agency’s written policy guidelines on availing the services 

of COS personnel, justification for the need to hire those COS personnel and 

incomplete documentation of DVs.    

 

As stated in CSC-COA-DBM Joint Circular (JC) No. 1, s. 2017, dated June 5, 

2017, government agencies have been authorized in previous executive issuances and 

general appropriations acts to enter into service contracts with other government 

agencies, private firms, non-government agencies or individuals for services related 

or incidental to their respective functions and operations, whether on a part-time or 

full-time basis.  

 

Agencies have used this provision as basis for directly hiring individuals on 

contract of service or job order basis to perform specific jobs or to supplement their 

current manpower.  

 

However, the proliferation of individual JO/COS workers in the government 

and their involvement even in the performance of regular agency functions have been 

observed. 

 



57 
 

Under CSC-COA-DBM JC No. 1, s. 2018, dated November 9, 2018, to quote:  

 

11.3 The existing qualified COS and JO workers shall be 

considered for appointment by the government agencies to their 

vacant positions subject to existing Civil Service Law and rules 

and agency CSC approved Merit Selection Plan. Xxx.  

 

11.4 Government agencies shall review their functions, systems 

and procedures, organizational structure and staffing to determine 

the appropriate human resource complement for their 

programs/activities/projects. The creation of permanent positions 

may be considered for regular functions, while the hiring of casual 

or contractual personnel may be considered for projects and 

activities that are temporary in nature, xxx.  

 

In CY 2020, PCOO has a total of 523 workforce during the year, composing 

of the following:

It was noted that the 375 COS personnel account for 71.70 percent of the total 

workforce of the PCOO, with the Office of the Secretary having the greatest number 

of 70 COS personnel in CY 2020. Also, the total number of COS personnel was 

260.42 per cent over the number of PCOO regular employees.

Interview, however, with PCOO officials and employees revealed the following 

information: 

 

• PCOO has no written policy guidelines on the hiring of employees 
particularly under contract of services; 

 

• Identification of individuals to be hired rests directly upon the 
request of the department heads and other agency officials, and the 

availability of applicants qualified for the requested position; and 

 

• The request was not supported by a justification for the hiring of COS 
personnel and the statement of functions to be performed by the said 

personnel  

Moreover, it was noted that the COS accomplishment reports attached to the 

DVs were not reflective of their actual duties/tasks accomplished for a particular 

period since the same were in general statements and the same accomplishments 

were repetitively reported every month.   In addition, accomplishments of COS 

personnel with similar designations were exactly the same with one another.  

Apparently, these are pro-forma accomplishment reports, and only the name and the 

period covered are being changed.  While some of the COS performed functions, 

which were part of the job description of the agency’s existing regular employees.  

 

Also, the payrolls were not supported with certification by the Personnel 

Officer that the activities/services cannot be provided by regular and permanent 

personnel of the agency to establish the necessity of hiring of COS personnel. 

 

The Audit Team recognizes the need to augment the agency’s manpower 

complement by way of outsourcing personnel services in the exigency of the service, 

however, a clear definition of the various conditions whereby employment of such 

COS personnel may be availed of is imperative so as to put the practice of hiring 

individuals under COS in its proper perspective given the scarce resources of the 

government.  

 

Those qualified COS personnel should be considered in filling up the vacant 

regular positions, and redundant or unnecessary COS personnel such as those who 

duplicate the work of regular employees should be cut.  

 

The unrestricted/massive hiring of COS personnel cost the PCOO a total 

amount of P70,688,830.39 for their salaries during the year, resulting in the depletion 

of government funds which could have been used for other programs and projects of 

the government.   

 

We recommended that Management:  

 

a. Submit justification for the hiring of 375 COS personnel; 



59 
 

b. Assess its existing organizational structure so that the ideal number of 
plantilla items/positions could be established, thereby, avoiding the 

hiring of excessive number of COS personnel;  

 

c. Develop a written policy guidelines on the hiring of individuals under 
COS clearly defining the conditions whereby employment of such COS 

personnel may be availed of; 

 

d. Evaluate the need for the services of COS and ensure that hiring of COS 
personnel shall be resorted to based on necessity and exigency of the 

service, and refrain from hiring COS whose functions are redundant to 

the functions of existing regular agency employees;   

 

e. Consider those qualified COS for appointment to the vacant regular 
plantilla positions in the agency; and  

 

f.  Require the COS to provide details of the actual duties/tasks 
accomplished in the monthly accomplishment report to facilitate 

proper evaluation.   

 

Management Comment: 

 

Management replied that the hiring was due to the exigency of the need to hire 

additional personnel in order to augment the lack of manpower of the agency. To 

stress out, the delivery of the services of the PCOO especially during the time of the 

pandemic are considered very crucial and the hiring of COS personnel is essential in 

order not to hamper the delivery of its basic services and pursue its mandate which 

is to serve as the premier arm of the Executive Branch in engaging and involving the 

citizenry and the mass media in order to enrich the quality of public discourse on all 

matters of governance and build a national consensus thereon. 

 

PCOO has implemented a budget cap for each of its unit/office in order to 

regulate its spending especially in hiring COS personnel. In addition, it required the 

submission of organizational structure from each unit/office to assess the current 

manpower complement and only approve request for hiring of COS personnel if 

proven to be necessary, to avoid redundancy of functions among Cos personnel. 

 

PCOO also clarified that it already issued Office Order No. 0031, Series of 

2020 to prescribe the policies and guidelines covering personnel hired through 

Contract of Service funded under Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses and/or 

other fund sources. The said Order ensures that the request for hiring of COS 

personnel by the requesting Office indicate the justification for hiring of COS 

personnel, source of fund where the salary of the COS Personnel will be charged 

against, updated table of organization, job description of the COS personnel, 

determination whether the COS personnel is office or output based and the 

Certification of Availability of Funds (CAF) before approving the same. 



60 
 

 

PCOO added that it has opened 34 positions during the current year wherein 

the preference for such positions are qualified current COS and JO personnel, and 

submitted the list of COS personnel who were regularized in the previous years. 

 

On the preparation of accomplishment reports, PCOO issued Memorandum 

dated June 2, 2021 prescribing the template where the brief description/detailed 

services rendered/actual tasks provided, date accomplished, status and related 

outputs shall be presented by the COS personnel. 

 

Audit Team’s Rejoinder: 

 

Management should support the succeeding COS to be submitted to the Audit 

Team with copy of the duly approved request for hiring of COS personnel, 

justification, job description and other pertinent documents as provided in the related 

agency’s guidelines.   

 

The Audit Team will validate whether the agency’s directive on the 

preparation of the prescribed accomplishment reports is complied with.

Gender and Development (GAD) Plans and Programs 

 

9. Management formulated GAD plans and programs to boost the level of 
awareness on gender issues and promote gender equality among PCOO 

personnel utilizing only P157,336.00 or 0.04 percent total expenditures contrary 

to Section 31 of the General Provision (GP) of the GAA FY 2020. 

 

Section 31 of the GP of the GAA FY 2020 (RA No. 11465) requires all 

agencies of the government to formulate a Gender and Development Plan designed 

to address gender issues within their concerned sectors or mandate and implement 

applicable provisions under RA No. 9710, also known as the Magna Carta for 

Women Act, Convention on the elimination of all forms of Discrimination against 

Women, the Philippine Plan for the Gender-Responsive Development (1995-2025) 

and the Philippine Development Plan (2017-2022). 

 

Moreover, the GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of the 

agencies, which shall be at least five percent of their budgets.  For this purpose, 

activities currently being undertaken by the agency that can contribute to poverty 

alleviation, economic empowerment especially of marginalized women, protection, 

promotion, and fulfillment of women’s human rights and practice of gender-

responsive governance are considered sufficient compliance with said requirements.

“All agencies of the government shall formulate plans, programs and projects 

intended to address the concerns of senior citizens and persons with disability, insofar 



62 
 

as it relates to their mandated functions, and integrate the same in their regular 

activities.” 

 

We recommended that Management allocate fund for the 

programs/projects related to Senior Citizens and Persons with Disability in 

compliance with the General Provisions of the GAA for FY 2020. 

 

 

Disaster Risk Reduction and Management and Climate Change Adaptation 

 

11. The agency failed to implement a project to address disaster risk reduction 
management (DRRM) and climate change adaptation, contrary with Section 36, 

General Provisions of GAA 2020. 

 

Section 36 of the GP of GAA FY 2020 (RA No. 11465) provides that “All 

agencies of the government shall plan and implement programs and projects, taking 

into consideration measures for climate change adaption and mitigation, and disaster 

risk reduction, based on climate and disaster risk assessment. National government 

agencies shall report their climate actions to the Climate Change Commission (CCC) 

for monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of the National Climate change 

Action Plan. xxx All Agencies shall undertake efforts to integrate environmental 

sustainability in their daily activities, systems, processes, and operations, and 

accelerate the greening of their organizational culture and behavior towards reducing
