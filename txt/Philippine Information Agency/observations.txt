OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

 
 

A.  Financial and Compliance Audit 
 

Grant of additional CAs despite non-liquidation of previous ones 

 

1. Additional CAs were granted to PIA Regional Offices (ROs) despite non-
liquidation or settlement of previous CAs, in violation of Section 89 of PD No. 

1445 and COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997, resulting in the 

accumulation of unliquidated CA totaling ₱85,525,292.71 as at December 31, 

2020.  

 

Section 89 of PD No. 1445 and COA Circular No. 97-002 provide among 

others, that a cash advance shall be reported on and liquidated as soon as the purpose 

for which it was given has been served and no additional cash advance shall be 

allowed to any official or employee unless the previous cash advance given to him is 

first settled or a proper accounting thereof is made. 

 

Analysis of the accounts Advances for Operating Expenses and Advances for 

Payroll as at December 31, 2020 disclosed that despite non-liquidation of previous 

CA, another CA was granted for the Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses 

(MOOE) and Personnel Services of various PIA Regional Offices totaling 

₱75,822,732.13 and ₱104,112,455.48, respectively, as follows:

The practice of Management to grant CA despite the non-liquidation of the 

previous CA and the failure of the AOs to liquidate their CAs within the reglementary 

period, aggravated by the grant of additional CAs even with still unliquidated CA, 

violated Section 89 of PD No. 1445 and COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 

10, 1997. 

 

COA Circular No. 97-002 states that: 

 

9.3.2  If thirty (30) days have elapsed after the demand 

letter is served and no liquidation or explanation is 

received, or the explanation received is not 

satisfactory, the Auditor shall advise the head of 

the agency to cause or order the withholding of the 

payment of any money due the AO. 

 

9.3.3 The AO shall likewise be held criminally liable, 

for failure to settle his accounts. xxx 

 

Likewise, Section 128 of PD No. 1445 penalizes the non-liquidation of CAs, 

to wit: 

 

Penal Provision. - Any violation of the provisions of 

Sections xx 89, xxx of this code or any regulation issued 

by the Commission implementing these sections, shall be 

punished by a fine not exceeding one thousand pesos or 



37 

 

by imprisonment not exceeding six (6) months, or both 

such fine and imprisonment in the discretion of the court. 

 

We reiterated our recommendation that Management: 

 

a. Issue demand letters to all ROs for the liquidation of their CAs, 
considering that the purpose for which the cash advances were 

granted had already been served; and to withhold the salaries of 

those who failed to liquidate their CAs until such time the liquidation 

is completed; 

 

b. Monitor unliquidated CAs to avoid long outstanding accounts; 
henceforth, institute measures to ensure that AOs strictly comply 

with the regulations on CAs. 

 

 

Failure to prepare the monthly BRS  

 

2. The monthly BRS of PIA CO for CYs 2019 and 2020 for the Cash in Bank- 
LLCA and Cash-MDS accounts for CY 2020 were not prepared, thus, the 

difference of  P26,165,197.19 between the books and bank balances could not be 

ascertained and reconciling items, if any, were not identified for appropriate 

adjustment. 

 

A bank reconciliation is the process of matching the balances in an entity's 

accounting records for a cash account to the corresponding information on a bank 

statement.  The goal of this process is to ascertain the differences between the 

two, and to book changes to the accounting records as appropriate.  It is an 

effective tool for management control and thus, must be kept current and accurate to 

avert possible acts leading to irregularities. 

 

Section 74 of PD No. 1445 states that: 

 

At the close of each month, depositories shall report to the 

agency head, in such form as he may direct, the condition of 

the agency account standing on their books.  The head of the 

agency shall see to it that reconciliation is made between the 

balance shown in the report and the balance found in the books 

of the agency. 

 

While Section 5, Chapter 21 of the GAM, Volume I, which covers the 

preparation of the BRS for “Cash in Bank” and “Cash-Modified Disbursement Sytem 

(MDS)” accounts, requires that the Chief Accountant/Designated Staff shall within 

ten days from receipt of the monthly Bank Statement (BS) together with the paid 

checks, original copies of Debit Memoranda (DM)/Credit Memoranda (CM) from the 

Government Servicing Bank (GSB), reconcile the BS with the General Ledger (GL), 



38 

 

and prepare the BRS in four copies.  Moreover, as provided under Section 7 of the 

same Chapter, GAM, Volume I, the Chief Accountant/Designated Staff shall submit 

the original copy of the BRS with all the supporting documents and JEVs to COA 

Auditor within 20 days after receipt of the monthly BS. 

 

Verification disclosed that the PIA CO maintains the following bank and 

MDS accounts with the LBP.   Confirmation request on the balances of Cash in Bank 

accounts as of December 31, 2020 were sent to LBP and the results of the 

confirmation disclosed a total cash balance of P26,142,287.39 or a difference of 

P26,165,197.19 as against the balance per books of P346,679.66, as shown below: 

 

Account Name Account No. Per Bank Per Book Discrepancy 

CIB, LCCA  0712-1037-36 161,884.93 346,679.66 184,794.73 

Cash - MDS , 

General Fund

Total  26,142,287.39 346,679.66 26,165,197.19 

 

However, reconciliation of the CIB-LCCA account for CYs 2019 and 2020, and 

of the two MDS accounts for CY 2020 was not conducted as there was no BRS 

prepared for said period.  The difference between the book and bank balances on bank 

accounts were not accounted for, thus, the correctness of the balances could not be 

ascertained, contrary to the aforementioned COA rules.  Consequently, no BRS was 

submitted to the Audit Team for verification despite repeated verbal demands to the 

Officer-In-Charge (OIC), Accounting Section.    

 

Due to failure to prepare the BRS, identification and appropriate adjustment of 

reconciling items, if any, were not facilitated.    

 

We recommended that Management direct the OIC, FMD to require the 

OIC, Accounting Section/responsible accounting personnel to: 

 

a. immediately prepare and submit to the Audit Team the BRS for the 
PIA CO’s bank and MDS accounts for said prior period up to current 

month;  

 

b. henceforth, strictly comply with the COA rules and regulations on the 
regular preparation and submission of the monthly BRS and to the 

Audit Team within the prescribed period; and 

 

c. enforce the sanction (reprimand or withholding of salary) on the 
responsible accounting officer/personnel who will fail to comply with 

the audit recommendations.  

 
The Management directed the Accounting Section of the Finance and 

Management Division  to submit all the BRS on or before June 1, 2021 and strictly 



39 

 

monitor compliance of the accountable officer and necessary actions will be 

undertaken if will still fail to comply. 

 

 

Erroneous classification of PPE 

 

3. Several office equipment of PIA RO V totaling P255,632 with unit cost of above 
the P15,000.00 capitalization threshold were erroneously classified as semi-

expendable, thus, inadvertently omitted in the RPCPPE, contrary to Section 4, 

Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs. 

 

Section 4, Chapter 10, GAM, Volume 1 explicitly states the capitalization 

threshold of P15,000 as the minimum cost of an individual asset recognized as a PPE 

on the Statement of Financial Position. 

 

Erroneous classification of the several office equipment totaling P255,622.32 

as semi-expendable items and included in the Report of Physical Count of Inventory 

(RPCI); thus, inadvertently omitted in the RPCPPE on the said PPE items. 

 

RPCI for Semi-Expendable was overstated while the RPCPPE for Office 

Equipment was consequently understated.  Such error, if not corrected, would 

eventually misstate the consolidated RPCPPE prepared by the Central Office. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Property 

Officer to appropriately classify each asset according to type, condition and cost 

and prepare separate RPCPPE, in this case, for the Office Equipment. 

 

 The OIC, Accounting Section directed the regional offices to reclassify the 

PPE account accordingly and recorded the same in the RPCPPE. 

 

 

Unreliable Inter-Agency Payables 

 

4. The existence of abnormal/negative balances of P9,013,774.90 reduced the 
ending balance of the inter-agency payables accounts totaling P204,891,532.90 

while the respective balance of the Due from NGAs and Due from GOCCs 

accounts was misstated due to erroneous recording of transactions, thereby, 

affecting the reliability of the financial statements.   

Section 111(2) of PD No. 1145 provides that:  

The highest standards of honesty, objectivity and consistency 

shall be observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against 

inaccurate or misleading information.  



40 

 

Also, Section 112 of the same PD states that in recording financial transactions, 

each government agency shall record its financial transactions and operations 

conformably with generally accepted accounting principles and in accordance with 

pertinent laws and regulations.  

 

Moreover, sound accounting practice dictates that the normal balance of asset 

and expense accounts should be debit; and the liabilities, equity and income accounts 

should be credit.  

 

Abnormal/Negative Balances  

 

Review of the trial balance as at December 31, 2020 and its supporting General 

Ledgers (GL) disclosed abnormal/negative balances totaling P9,013,774.90 in the 

inter-agency payables accounts.   

 

As disclosed in the Notes to Financial Statement (FS), the negative balances 

for Due to GSIS, Due to Pag-IBIG and Due to PhilHealth accounts represent 

cumulative balance since 2002 as a result of conversion of accounts required by 

NGAS, and that the Accounting Office is still in the long process of reconciling the 

amount. 

 

Comparative analysis of the negative balances in CYs 2019 and 2020 revealed 

the following:  

 

Account Name 
CY 2019 CY 2020 

Amount(P) 

General Fund (101) 

Due to GSIS-GF 3,893,434.57 

 

4,135,174.16 

Due to Pag-IBIG-GF 1,393,447.87 

 

1,386,357.99 

Due to PhilHealth 144,877.04 141,445.39 

Due to GOCCs 316,092.85 3,233,077.61 

Trust Receipts (07) 

Due to BIR - 117,719.70 

Total 5,747,852.33 9,013,774.90 

 

As can be gleaned from the above table, the CY 2019 negative balance for Due 

to GSIS and Due to GOCCs accounts further increased in CY 2020 while the negative 

balance of Due to BIR account only occurred in CY 2020.  There was no significant 

reduction in the negative balance of the other inter-agency payables accounts. 

 

The abnormal/negative balances reduced the total ending balance of the inter-

agency payables accounts, thus, rendering the same unreliable.  

 

 



41 

 

Erroneously recorded transactions 

 

Audit of the accounts Due to NGAs and Due to GOCCs disclosed accounting 

errors that affected the respective balances as at December 31, 2020, to wit: 

 
Particulars Understated/(Overstated) 

Due to NGAs Due to GOCCs 

Error in recording the receipt of funds from 

DOH 
720,000.00 (720,000.00) 

Erroneous adjustments in the recording of 

fund received from DOH  

720,000.00 

 
(720,000.00) 

Erroneous recording of the refund of 

unutilized fund from Employees’ 

Compensation Commission (ECC) 

21,069,464.35 (21,069,464.35) 

Total 22,509,464.35 (22,509,464.35) 

 

Management erroneously recorded the receipt of fund transfer from the 

Department of Health (DOH) as Due to GOCCs instead of Due to NGAs.  Though 

there was an adjustment made per JEV No. 07-2019-05-123 to correct the error, the 

transaction was still credited to Due to GOCCs instead of Due to NGAs.   

 

Also, the refund of unutilized ECC fund was erroneously recorded as Due to 

NGAs instead of Due to GOCCs. 

 

While the said accounting errors did not affect the total reported inter-agency 

payables accounts balance, the respective balance of the accounts Due to NGAs and 

Due to GOCCs was misstated.  

 

The above-noted conditions indicated that transactions were not carefully 

reviewed/analyzed before recording in the books and that analysis /verification of the 

negative balances was given less attention by the Accounting Section.  

 

We recommended that Management instruct the OIC, Accounting Section 

to: 

 

a. effect the necessary adjustments to reflect the correct balances of the 
affected accounts; and 

 

b. exercise diligence and attentiveness in the review of transactions 
before recording in the books to prevent errors.  

 

Management commented that there were several adjustments that had been 

effected in CY 2020 based on reconciliation that are being undertaken and already 

instructed the OIC, Accounting Section to devise a strategy to reconcile the negative 

balances reflected the soonest so not to reflect the same towards the end of this year. 

 



42 

 

Unused balance of fund transfers not returned to SAs  

 

5. Unutilized fund transfers from NGAs and GOCCs amounting to 
P110,173,949.96 and P39,118,303.18, respectively, were not returned to the 

source agencies (SAs) despite completion of projects, contrary to the pertinent 

provisions of COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994 and related 

MOAs.  However, the total amount of P149,292,253.14 that should be returned 

to the SAs does not reconcile with the balance of the PIA’s trust account with 

the BTr which amounted to only P119,834,655.58, or a difference of 

P29,457,597.56, thereby, casting doubts on the correctness of the balances of the 

accounts Due to NGAs, Due to GOCCs and Cash, Treasury/Agency Deposit, 

Trust. 

 

Section 4.9 of COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994 which 

prescribes the rules and regulations in the grant, utilization and liquidations of funds 

transferred to Implementing Agency (IA), the IA shall return to the SA any unused 

balance upon completion of the project. 

 

The MOAs entered into between PIA and various NGAs and GOCCs for the 

implementation of special projects also stipulate that any unspent funds upon 

completion of the project shall be returned to the SA. 

 

 In CYs 2014 to 2019, PIA received funds from various government 

agencies/instrumentalities for the implementation of projects in the aggregate amount 

of P657,202,449.46 with unutilized balance totaling P149,292,253 as at December 

31, 2020, details shown below:

Grand Total 149,292,253.14 

 

Despite completion of the intended projects, PIA failed to return the unused 

project funds to the SAs, contrary to the pertinent provision of COA Circular No.  

94-013 and the MOAs. The accumulated balance of P149,292,253.14 represented 

17.95 percent of the total funds received by PIA from said NGAs and GOCCs.  

 

Such failure resulted in cash idleness which does not promote the efficient 

utilization of government resources. The unused balance of fund transfers could have 

been immediately utilized/allocated by the SAs or the government for other priority 

projects.  

 

However, verification disclosed that the total amount of P149,292,253.14 that 

should be returned to the SAs was not backed up by adequate cash in the PIA’s trust 

account with the BTr where the fund transfers were remitted. As at year-end, PIA’s 

Cash-Treasury/Agency, Trust account had a balance of only P119,834,655.58, which 

is lesser by P29,457,597.56 than the unutilized balance of fund transfers.  It was 

learned that PIA Accounting Section did not reconcile its records with the BTr with 

regard to its trust account.  

 

The unreconciled balance of fund transfers with the PIA’ s trust account with 

the BTr casted doubts on the correctness of the balances of the Due to NGAs, Due to 

GOCCs and Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, Trust accounts.   

 

We recommended that Management instruct the OIC, Accounting Section 

to: 

 

a. prioritize the analysis/reconciliation of the Due to NGAs, Due from 
GOCCs and Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, Trust accounts in   

order to establish the correct balances. Thereafter, immediately 

facilitate the return of the unused project funds to the SAs; 

 

b. initiate the reconciliation process for the PIA’s trust account with 
the BTr; and 

 

c. henceforth, strictly abide by COA Circular No. 94-013 on the return 
of the unused balance of fund transfer to the SA upon completion of 

the project/purpose.   

 

The Accounting Section has an ongoing reconciliation of the unaccounted 

balance of the Due to NGAs and GOCCs. Last year, they’ve generated disbursements 



45 

 

reports for some of 2012 to 2014 receipts from the previous updated reports for 

receipts from 2015-onwards only.  But these reports are still subject for reconciliation 

and verification before refunding any balance. Thus, the Management instructed to 

fast track the reconciliation or at least partially refund or request from Department of 

Budget Management the fund for return of unutilized fund transfers Since, all trust 

fund were already reverted back to the treasury unless requested for refund. 

 

 

Non-disposal of unserviceable properties 

 

6. Unserviceable properties of PIA ROs IV-B, V, VI, XII and XIII remained 
undisposed contrary to Section 79 of PD No. 1445, exposing them to further 

deterioration and diminution of resale value, including the deprivation of the 

agency of the maximum utilization of space occupied by the properties. 

Section 79 of PD No. 1445 states that: 

When government property has become unserviceable for any 

cause, or is no longer needed, it shall, upon application of the 

officer accountable therefor, be inspected by the head of the 

agency or his duly authorized representative in the presence of the 

auditor concerned and, if found to be valueless or unsalable, it 

may be destroyed in their presence. If found to be valuable, it may 

be sold at public auction to the highest bidder under the 

supervision of the proper committee an award or similar body in 

the presence of the auditor concerned or other duly authorized 

representative of the Commission, xxx. 

 

The Audit Teams observed that disposal of unserviceable properties has yet to 

be undertaken in the following PIA ROs as at December 31, 2020, contrary to Section 

79 of PD No. 1445, with details below:  

 

ROs Audit Observation 

IV-B 

Palawan 
 Disposal of obsolete/unserviceable properties of P343,581.04 

has not yet been undertaken by the Agency 

V  Unserviceable motor vehicles reported in the Inventory and 
Inspection Report for Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) costing 

P1,269,500.00 were not disposed as of December 31, 2020. 

VI  Various unserviceable and fully depreciated properties with a 
total acquisition of P285,526.00 remained undisposed. 

XII  Unserviceable and fully depreciated properties amounting to 
P243,191.68 were still dumped inside the office premises 

awaiting proper disposal. 

XIII  Unserviceable equipment and semi-expendable properties 
valued at ₱462,255.90 remained undisposed at year-end. 

 



46 

 

Non-disposal of the unserviceable properties has caused the 

storeroom/warehouse to be overcrowded and the equipment to accumulate dust, 

deteriorate and lose its value.  Likewise, the spaces occupied by those assets could 

have been utilized for more productive or worthwhile purposes if the same were 

disposed immediately. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a. require the respective RO Property Officer to prepare an updated 
IIRUP duly approved by proper officials, with all the necessary 

supporting documents, including appraisal thereof, for appropriate 

action of the Disposal Committee; and 

 

b. ensure that proper disposal procedures are undertaken in 
accordance with existing rules and regulations. 

 

Management commented that to date, the IIRUP has been prepared by the 

Central and Regional Offices and is subject for review of the Accounting Section for 

dropping from the books. 

 

The Management will also ensure through the Administrative Division a 

thorough review and checking of unserviceable PPE for proper disposal. 

 

 

Provision/Usage of mobile phone not in accordance with agency guidelines 

 

7. The provision of two mobile phones with postpaid line subscription to ineligible 
personnel, upgrading of plans, mobile phone usage in excess of the allowable 

limit/plan and non-deduction of the excess usage from the device user’s salary 

of the PIA CO, CAR and RO IV-A were contrary to PIA Office Order No. 21 

dated March 19, 2018. 

 

The PIA Office Order No. 021, Series of 2018 dated March 19, 2018 providing 

the policy guidelines on agency-issued mobile phones was issued to rationalize, 

streamline and standardize the utilization and function of agency-issued mobile 

phones to officials and personnel of PIA.  Among others, the policy guidelines 

prescribed the type and nature of the mobile plans for each qualified personnel, the 

package costs and service parameters are presented below:

The guidelines further provide that: 

 

 Statement of Billing shall be sent to the Administrative Division (AD) 
or Regional Focal Person (RFP) shall sort billings and identify any 

potential misuse or violation for possible investigation, which shall 

include, but not limited to 

 

- Bills that exceeded respective plan; 
- Excessive mobile data charges; 
- Lengthy calls; and 
- Unauthorized roaming and/or long-distance charges. 

 

 Any excess usage of the plan shall be automatically deducted from the 
device user’s salary 

 

It was gathered that from January 1 to August 31, 2020, 72 PIA CO personnel 

were issued mobile phones with postpaid plans, for which, a total of P1,244,955.95 

was incurred by the agency during the said period. 

 

Review of the monthly billing/statement of account revealed that four PIA CO 
personnel, whose position/designation are not among those entitled to more than one 

plan, were provided with two mobile phones with postpaid plan, as shown below:

It should be informed that the provision of mobile phone, whether postpaid line 

subscription or prepaid, in excess of one unit for each entitled official, which should 

not be lower than Division Chief rank, is one of the cases of “excessive expenditure” 

enumerated under COA Circular No. 2012-003. 

  

It was also observed that the actual postpaid plan availed by 29 users were more 

than the authorized plan under the PIA guidelines. This was due to upgrading of plans 

despite having no specific provision in the agency policy guidelines for such.  

 

While the mobile plan of the other eligible agency personnel conformed with 

what was allowed in the agency guidelines, their actual usage, however, exceeded 

their respective limits/plans.  Moreover, the mobile phone charges for the excess 



49 

 

usage was not automatically deducted from the corresponding device user’s salary, 

contrary to the guidelines. 

 

The OIC, Accounting Section, explained that upon determination of excess 

usage, an adjustment is prepared to reverse the equivalent recorded expense and a 

receivable from the responsible user is recorded. This condition indicated that no 

proper review of the monthly billing/statement of account for the post-paid plans was 

made before payment.  

 

 Likewise, actual mobile phone usage of some PIA RO IV-A personnel 

exceeded their respective postpaid plan by P12,577.98 While four rank and file 

personnel were issued mobile phones with monthly plan of P2,000.00 and P999.00 

when they are only entitled to a P300.00 monthly prepaid load as provided in PIA 

Office Order No. 021, thus, resulted in excess mobile expenses of P46,872.89. 

 

In addition, the PIA CAR maintained 16 postpaid plans distributed to its 15 

personnel.  A comparison of the plans availed with the monthly budget prescribed in 

the guideline showed that there are 7 accounts exceeding the prescribed monthly plan 

and the inclusion of the installment cash outs for high end phones opted by personnel 

and some add-ons. 

 

The Audit Team wishes to emphasize that one of the goals of the Policy 

Guidelines is to limit corporate liability by instituting procedures for monitoring and 

controlling costs-related use of mobile devices. 

 

We recommended that Management:  

 

a. revisit the policy guidelines to include specific provision on the 
upgrading of plans, if deemed necessary; 

 

b. instruct the OIC, Administrative Division to (i) to assign personnel 
who will review the monthly billings before payment so that proper 

action on excess usage could be immediately taken; and (ii) see to it 

that only the prescribed plan to each eligible personnel is provided; 

 

c. require the OIC, Accounting Section to immediately bill the 
concerned personnel for the excess usage and recognize the same as 

receivable in the books upon recording of the payment of the 

monthly statement of account/billing, and ensure that the excess 

usage is automatically deducted from the user’s salary; and 

 

d. direct all personnel with agency-issued mobile phones to strictly 
observe their monthly authorized mobile limit/plan. 

 



50 

 

Management issued the Memorandum Circular No. 027 dated 25 August 2020 

as the new guidelines on the provision of mobile communication plans for PIA 

personnel to ensure that only eligible officials and employees will be provided.  

 

Excess usage has been consolidated and some were collected especially those 

that were separated from the agency. A demand letter will also be issued to all who 

has excess usage. 

The accounting also was able to recognize in the books the entire excess usage 

base on the review that was undertaken last December 2020.  Also, through the 

issuance of the new memorandum, the employees and personnel were already guided 

accordingly. 

 

 

Illegal payment of Transportation Allowance 

 

8. The RH of PIA RO VII claimed TA totaling P60,000.00 despite being issued 
government vehicle in her name, in violation of NBC No. 548 dated May 15, 

2013, hence, considered, illegal pursuant to COA Circular No. 2012-003.  
 

Item 5.2.3 of NBC No. 548 prohibits the grant of transportation allowance to 

officials and employees who are assigned or presently using government motor 

transportation.  Likewise, under No. 3.13, Annex B of COA Circular 2012-003, it 

classifies the payment of TA in such condition as illegal. 

 

Review of disbursement vouchers (DVs) revealed that the RH was granted TA  

in the amount of P5,000.00 per month or a total of P60,000 for the period January to 

December, 2020 despite being issued a Toyota Innova service vehicle under Property 

Acknowledgement Receipt (PAR) No. 03-01-AA02. 

 

Payment of TA under such circumstances is considered illegal as further 

provided for under No. 3.13, Annex B of COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 

29, 2012, and is therefore disallowable. 

 

We recommended that the RH explain the receipt of monthly TA.  

Likewise, we recommended that Management stop paying TA to officials who 

are assigned or issued government vehicles, in strict compliance with COA 

Circular 2012-003, and pursuant to NBC No. 548 on the rules and regulations 

on the grant of RATA. 

 

Management explained that while it is true that the vehicle is MR’ed to the RH, 

it must be noted that the RH is not using the official vehicle to transport her from 

home to office and vice versa but is using her own personal vehicle, instead. The 

only reason that the vehicle is MR’ed to the RH is because of its value who holds 

liability for it. 

 



51 

 

With the Audit Team observation, it was agreed that the vehicle will now be 

under the custody of the Administrative Officer, in order not to violate COA Circular 

on this matter. 

 

 

Excessive payment of hazard pay 

 

9. Payment of hazard pay to PIA RO VII personnel was excessive by P104,500.00 
in violation of DBM BC No. 2020-01. 

 

Administrative Order No. 26 authorized the grant of hazard pay to government 

personnel who physically report for work during the period of implementation of an 

Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) relative to the COVID-19 outbreak. 

 

Likewise, DBM Budget Circular No. 2020-01 provided the guidelines on the 

grant of the COVID-19 hazard pay.  Among the guidelines and conditions prescribed 

to be granted a hazard pay is the implementation of ECQ measures in the area of such 

office or work station where the personnel/workers have been authorized to 

physically report. 

 

During the onslaught of the COVID19 pandemic, to curb the spread of the 

disease, various branches of the government including the Local Government Units 

(LGU), and the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious 

Diseases (IATF-EID) imposed community quarantine measures including which is 

the declaration of a city/province as under General Community Quarantine (GCQ), 

Modified General Community Quarantine (MGCQ), Modified Enhanced 

Community Quarantine (MECQ) and ECQ.  Shown below are the different issuances 

related to the declaration of risk-classifications:

PIA RO VII personnel report to four different work stations, RO in Cebu City, 

Bohol Infocen, Negros Infocen and Siquijor Infocen.  The different areas were put 

under different risk-classifications during the pandemic as shown above. 

 

During the year, the personnel of PIA RO VII, including workers engaged 

through contract of service or job order were paid a uniform amount of hazard pay 

in the amount of P500.00 per day of physically reporting to work for the months of 

March to July totaling P419,000.00, as summarized below: 

 

 
 

Verification of the DVs revealed that some personnel were granted hazard pay 

even though their work station were not under the ECQ as required by the BC, thus, 

resulted to overpayments amounting to P104,500.00. 

 

Moreover, some of the payments of hazard pay were not properly supported 

with documents, such as Daily Time Records (DTRs) necessary to verify the validity 

and propriety of the claim. 

 

Expenditures which exceed what is proper and are outside the reasonable limits 

are considered “Excessive” and are subject to disallowance in audit. 

 

We recommended that PIA RO VII explain the grant of hazard pay to 

personnel whose work stations are not declared under the ECQ; and submit to 

the Audit Team the DTRs to support the claim. 

 

PIA RO VII took note of the issue and commented that there was a time where 

all the provinces were simultaneously placed under the ECQ. However, other 

provinces have already graduated from this status while Cebu remained under the 

ECQ. 

 

It further informed that during the preparation of hazard pay payroll, the RO 

presumed that the provinces were still under EQ status since there was no advice or 

update from the provinces on the change of classification.  The Management failed 

to verify the quarantine status of the respective provinces.

Management also committed to submit the DTRs of the personnel who 

received the hazard pay. 

 

 

Unnecessary representation expenses 

 

10. Representation expenses amounting to P125,161.48 were incurred for the meals 
and snacks of PIA RO XI’s employees while conducting ordinary office work 

and for activities/programs with few or no guests; thus, considered as 

unnecessary expenditures per COA Circular No. 2012-003 resulting in the 

improper utilization of funds that could be used for more relevant activities of 

the agency. 

 

COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012 defines “unnecessary 

expenditures” as: 

 

The term pertains to expenditures which could not pass the test of 

prudence or the diligence of a good father of a family, thereby 

denoting non-responsiveness to the exigencies of the service. 

Unnecessary expenditures are those not supportive of the 

implementation of the objectives and mission of the agency 

relative to the nature of its operation. This would also include 

incurrence of expenditure not dictated by the demands of good 

government, and those the utility of which cannot be ascertained 

at a specific time.  Xxx… 

 

For the period January 1, 2020 to July 31, 2020, a total of P125,161.48 was 

incurred for representation expenses spent on internal and external activities. 

 

Review of the paid DVs for the period January 1 to July 31, 2020 disclosed that  

a total of P125,161.48 was incurred for representation expenses spent on internal and 

external activities, and noted some deficiencies: 

 

 Attached attendance sheets indicated that the meals and snacks were for 
“Skeletal Work during COVID-19 Quarantine Period”, “Skeletal Work 

during COVID-19 Enhanced Community Quarantine Period”, 

“Skeletal Work during COVID-19 Extension of Enhanced Community 

Quarantine Period, “COVID-19 Extended General Community 

Quarantine Period” which are not valid activities/programs and are 

considered ordinary office work;  

 

 Most of the attendees/participants were PIARO XI employees, 
accounting for 57 percent to 100 percent of the total attendance to these 

activities/programs, thus expenses for meals and snacks should have 

been minimal since there were only a few or no guests; and 

 



54 

 

 Attached activity designs did not specify the resource requirements, 
such as manpower (i.e. resource persons, facilitator, documenter, and 

administrative assistant) that determines who among the employees 

will be involved in activities. As a result, anyone can attend. 

The representation expenses incurred were considered irrelevant to the 

activities undertaken, thus considered unnecessary expenses since these were not 

dictated by the demands of good government and funds could have been channeled 

to more important activities/programs. 

 

We recommended that Management: 

 

a. submit a written justification on the incurrence of representation 
expenses amounting to P125,161.48 which were considered 

unnecessary; 

 

b. submit a copy of the approved Office Order/Memorandum 
authorizing the conduct of virtual pressers; 

 

c. specify and indicate the resource requirements on the Activity Design 
to determine the number of participants, including the personnel from 

PIA RO XI, who attended the activity/program. This is to ensure that 

only those involved in the program shall be authorized to attend the 

activity; 

 

d. refrain from incurring representation expenses for activities 
considered as ordinary office work; and 

 

e. strictly observe prudence in the use of government funds by ensuring 
that these are utilized only for expenses which are valid and necessary. 

 

The RH, in response to the audit observation, provided the following 

information: 

 

 He was designated as the chairperson of the Task Group on Strategic 
Communications per RTF11-COVID19 Resolution No. 09, Series of 

2020. The Strategic Communication Task Group, with the leadership of 

PIA as chairperson, established the production and airing of One Davao 

on COVID19: A Virtual Presser which became a daily virtual press 

conference where media practitioners actively participate through Q and 

A and source out their news published through the different platforms. The 

conduct of virtual pressers is on top of the regular activities as planned by 

the agency for this year, for which expenses for meals and snacks of the 

production staff were incurred, thus, these expenses are not irrelevant and 

unnecessary since these have been indicated as part of the budgetary 

requirements in the Activity Design of the virtual presser. 

  



55 

 

 On the observation that attached attendance sheets indicated meals and 
snacks for Skeletal Work during COVID 19 Quarantine Period, 

Management admitted that the assigned personnel failed to indicate the 

actual activity title and this was overlooked by all the accountable officers 

who signed and approved the processing of procurement as well as 

payment.  

 

 The allocation for meals and snacks, including the production of the virtual 
presser however, were included in the breakdown of expenses for 

additional funding that was requested by the PIA CO during the start of 

the pandemic period. 

 

 Moreover, on the observation that the activity designs did not specify the 
resource requirements, the agency may have no specific tasking formally 

issued to the staff, however, verbal instructions on their role in the virtual 

presser were provided. While the desired information may have been 

missed out in a formal memorandum, RO assured the Audit Team that the 

smooth and continuous conduct of the activities from Day 1 until present 

is a proof of teamwork and collaboration.  

 

Audit Team’s Rejoinder: 

 

The services rendered as information officers, moderators, multimedia 

assistants, and other working staffs were inherent to their positions, therefore, 

allocation for meals and snacks for PIA employees is irregular and unnecessary. It is 

evident in the Attendance Sheets that PIA employees were the only participants who 

availed the meals and snacks, and guests were not included.  Also, target participants 

were not indicated in the activity design; hence, it cannot be clearly determined how 

many PIA staffs were authorized to participate. 

 

Moreover, six out of 85 activities from March to July 2020 shows that no virtual 

presser was conducted. The activity indicated in the attendance sheet was “Skeletal 

Work during CoViD-19 Quarantine Period” which is not a valid activity. 

 

However, with the submission of the executive orders, resolution, and 

memoranda, the audit team will verify the validity of the said activities.  

 

 

Unnecessary office supplies expenses  

 

11. PIA RO XI paid for office supplies amounting to P6,246.43 that cannot be 
utilized due to the negligence of the Requisitioner who failed to consider the 

correct specifications of the items prior to its procurement, thus resulting in the 

incurrence of unnecessary expenses and wastage of  government resources.  

 



56 

 

Administrative controls are primarily established to create a sound 

environment that help agencies achieve operational proficiency and adherence to 

management policies and government rules and regulations in an orderly and 

efficient manner. This encompasses the proper preparation and submission of 

procurement documents which facilitate an efficient and effective monitoring of 

procurement activities. 

 

Last September 2020, the agency received delivery of two (2) units TN-2280 

printer toners amounting to P6,246.43 from RASI Computer Inc. for the use of the 

Acting Bookkeeper who currently uses a Brother L-2540 printer. Upon inspection of 

said items, it was found that the toners were not compatible with the printer.  

 

The approved Purchase Request (PR) and Purchase Order (PO) contained the 

specifications: Brother L-2540, TN-2280, which is the same model of the printer she 

uses and the same model of toners she has received. It was later found that the correct 

toner for the printer Brother L-2540 is TN-2360. 

 

The Acting Bookkeeper, who also happens to be the requisitioner, justified that 

she copied the specifications indicated in the Delivery Receipt (June 2020) of the 

previous delivery of printer toners from RASI Computer Inc. which indicated TN-

2280. Moreover, the Acting Bookkeeper also claimed that RASI Computer Inc.’s 

system only shows TN-2280 as the printer toner for all Brother L-2540 printers. A 

table on the specifications for the June and September 2020 deliveries are shown on 

below:

Delivery Receipt TN-2280 TN-2280 

Actual Delivery TN-2360 TN-2280 

 

The agency’s Inspection Officer says that he ensures that the delivered goods 

conform to all the important specifications stated in the approved Purchase Orders. 

However, he made a mistake in the June 2020 delivery since he did not notice the 

error in the Delivery Receipt.  

 

Per inquiry with the supplier, they expressed that they just delivered the items 

indicated in the Request for Quotation and the Purchase Order. The supplier denied 

the claims of the Acting Bookkeeper that their system only shows TN-2280 printer 

toners for monochrome laser Brother printers. For the reason of their established 

good relations with PIA RXI, the supplier agreed to replace one (1) of the two (2) 

erroneously procured printer toners. The other printer toner can no longer be replaced 

since the box was already open.  

  

Due to the negligence of the Acting Bookkeeper who failed to indicate the 

correct specifications in the Purchase Request, the agency incurred unnecessary 



57 

 

expenses amounting to P6,246.43 for the purchase of printer toners that cannot be 

used due to their non-compatibility with their printers. Fortunately, the supplier 

agreed to replace one of the two printer toners.  

 

The error committed by the Acting Bookkeeper could have been avoided had 

she exercised prudence and diligence in the conduct of her work.  The same could 

also be said of the Inspection Officer who was also negligent in his duty.  

 

We recommended that Management: 

 

a. hold the Acting Bookkeeper personally liable for the one (1) unit 
printer toner that cannot be replaced by the supplier and order the 

refund of P3,123.20 from her; and 

 

b. impose disciplinary sanctions on the erring personnel, including the 
Inspection Officer, for their negligence. 

 

The RH required the Acting Bookkeeper to replace the unused toner from her 

personal funds. This action will be validated by the Audit Team. 

 

 

Direct reimbursement of expenses 

 

12. Expenses amounting to  P280,947.18 from January 1 to November 30, 2020 were 
directly reimbursed  by PIA RO I employees to the GF of the agency, in which 

the amount of  P126,973.60 should have been paid directly to the 

suppliers/creditors through checks, the amount of  P36,534.61 could have been 

reimbursed through their PCF and the amount of  P117,438.97 could have been 

paid out of special cash advance pursuant to COA Circular No. 97-002 dated 

February 10, 1997, thus affecting the agency’s effectiveness in handling cash 

through the imprest system. 

 

Two of the general principles in handling cash through the imprest system are 

the following: 1) All payments must be made by check; and 2) Only payments in 

small amounts may be made through the petty cash fund under Section 2 of COA 

Circular No. 97-002. 

 

Also, it is stated under item 3.1.4 of the same Circular that a regular cash 

advance can be granted for petty operating expenses consisting of small payments 

for maintenance and operating expenses such cannot be paid conveniently by check 

or are required immediately. 

 

Further, under item 3.2.1 of the same Circular allows special cash advances for 

current operating expenditures of the agency field office or of the activity of the 

agency undertaken in the field when it is impractical to pay the same by check. 

 



58 

 

Monthly Reports of Check Issued (RCI) were examined by the Audit Team 

and found out that several checks were prepared and issued in the name of two 

employees representing reimbursements of various expenses incurred by the agency.  

Audit of DVs for CY 2020 revealed that several reimbursements should have 

been paid directly to suppliers/creditors, could have been paid through the PCF of 

the agency, and other expenses reimbursed should have been paid out of Special Cash 

Advances for specific purpose. Summary of these are presented below: 

 

Particulars Amount (P) 

Should have been paid directly to the 

suppliers/creditors through checks  

126,973.60 

 

Could have been paid out of the PCF 36,534.61 

Could have been paid out of the special cash 

advance 

117, 438.97 

Total  280,947.18 

 

This practice of Management purportedly evades the purpose of an effective 

cash management under the imprest system. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed that they will refrain from 

directly reimbursing expenses to the agency fund, petty expenses shall be 

reimbursed through the PCF only, and implementation of COA Circular 97-

002 shall be strictly observed. 

 

The RH and the accountable employee took note and promise to adhere with 

the audit recommendation and that is to refrain direct reimbursement of expenses 

from the agency fund and strictly observed the implementation of COA Circular 97-

002. 

 

 

Insufficient documentary requirements 

 

13. The validity and propriety of disbursements of PIA ROs I, III and XI in the 
respective amounts of P139,425.31, P1,250,481.72, and P191,321.01, could not 

be ascertained due to insufficient documentary requirements, as prescribed 

under COA Circular 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012, contrary to Section 4(6) of 

PD No. 1445.   

 

Section 4 (6) of PD No. 1445 provides the fundamental principles governing 

financial transactions and operations of government agencies and Paragraph 6 

specifically requires that “Claims against government funds shall be supported with 

complete documentation”. 

 

COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 was issued prescribing the 

revised guidelines and documentary requirements for common government 



59 

 

transactions which incorporated the requirements under existing issuances of the 

Commission.  

 

RO I 

 

During the year, a total amount of P267,500.36 was paid out of PCF for CY 

2020 of which, P139,425.31 was for the representation expenses, summarized as 

follows: 

 

 

Post audit of DVs on the replenishment of PCF revealed that the 

representation expenses were for the meals, snacks and assorted groceries were 

served during various meetings by RO I. The claims were only supported by 

Attendance Sheets and ORs. As can be gleaned from the table, the representation 

expenses accounts for more than 52 per cent of the total petty expenses in CY 2020.  

 

Furthermore, the initial grant of PCF was not supported with approved 

estimates of petty expenses for one month. This requirement is needed in order for 

the Petty Cash Custodian (PCC) to properly use and manage the fund for its intended 

purpose. Absence of approved estimates of petty expenses can lead to improper use 

of funds. 

 

The supporting documents attached to the DVs were not sufficient to establish 

validity of claims. The PCC should have included in his or her liquidation reports the 

notice of meeting, agenda, minutes of meeting, and photos or videos of the meeting, 

if possible to prove that such expenses were actually incurred for that purpose.  

 

RO III 

 

COVID-19 related expenditures incurred for the period January to 

September, 2020 revealed that several transactions amounting to P1,008,938.96 and 

P232,406.76 were processed without the necessary Inspection and Acceptance 

Reports (IARs), and list of recipients/beneficiaries of the delivered items, 

respectively; thus, casting doubt on the regularity, validity and propriety of the 

expenditures.

Also, the DV covering the payment of last salary of an employee who retired 

from service and which was paid on September 16, 2020 under Check no. 2892245 

was submitted to the Audit Team without any supporting document.  

 

RO XI 

 

Expenses incurred for meals, office supplies and other incidental expenses for 

the conduct of various activities totaling P61,650.25 were not adequately supported 

with documents. Moreover, IARs were lacking in the various procurement of goods 

totaling P129,670.76.  

 

The noted deficiency indicated weakness in the agency’s internal control over 

its disbursement system.  Moreover, the incomplete documentation is contrary to the 

aforecited COA regulations which specifically require complete documentation to 

support claims against the government funds.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to support the DVs with the 

documentary requirements as prescribed under COA Circular No. 2012-001 

dated June 14, 2012. 

 

The RHs required the accountable officers to immediately submit the lacking 

documents and reminded to adhere with COA 2012-001 to ensure the submission of 

the documentary requirements. 

 

 

Insufficient internal control over safeguarding of assets 

 

14. PIA RO I still has insufficient internal control over safeguarding their assets, 
particularly their PPE which is not in conformity with the principal objectives 

of an internal control. 

 

One of the principal objectives of an internal control is to safeguard the assets 

of a company from its misuse and possible loss. Physical safeguards over the assets 

are likewise very important to minimize the fraud risk involved.  

 

On August 28, 2018, AOM No. 2018-003 was issued by the Audit Team as an 

audit observation to PI RO I regarding insufficient internal control. The paragraphs 

below were the condition of the agency and results of audit before: 

 

The Audit Team found out through verification and vouching of 

documents that PIA RO 1 has no security services expense incurred 

during the period January 1 to June 30, 2018. During the interview 

conducted by the Audit Team with the Acting Disbursing Officer, it 

was revealed that due to limited monthly budgetary requirement for 

Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE), management 

opted not to avail security services.  



61 

 

Management’s sound internal control on physical safeguards 

over the assets dictates that company’s property should be protected 

from its misuse and possible loss at all times. This requires twenty-four 

(24) hours a day, seven (7) days a week (24/7) security.  

 

With the above-mentioned principle and existing condition of 

PIA RO 1, it can be clearly viewed that such security services should 

be availed in order to address the need to physically safeguard the assets 

of the company, particularly its PPE. The risk of a possible loss or theft 

is likely very high when there is no guard on duty. 

 

During the exit conference sometime in January 2019, before the finalization 

of the Summary of Audit Observation and Recommendations (SAOR) for CY 2018, 

Management agreed to our audit recommendations. They also said that they will 

include this concern in their budget proposal for CY 2020 and hoping that PIA 

Central Office (CO) will approve the same.  

 

During our validation and monitoring of prior years’ audit recommendations 

sometime in June 2019, Management informed the Audit Team that they are still 

waiting for the approval and appropriate action from top management.  

 

The Audit Team again raised the issue on the status of action taken by 

management during the exit conference on January 22, 2020, before the finalization 

of the SAOR of CY 2019, but Management informed that they have not yet received 

any approval for their proposed budget for CY 2020 and reply from PIA-CO 

regarding the audit observation.  

 

On January 28, 2020, Management sent a letter to the Office of the Director-

General, PIA CO requesting for an appropriate specific action on the matter but until 

now neither update nor reply was received by PIA-ROI from PIA-CO. 

 

We reiterated the recommendation that Management address their need 

on security services to cover the physical safeguarding of PPE 24 hours a day, 

seven days a week and make a strong representation with the higher authority 

to request for additional budgetary requirements to cover the said security 

services expense. 

 

The RH make the initial steps to safeguard the agency’s asset through 

requesting two employees to stay in the office since there are still no available budget 

due to current status of the agency as to its financial capacity. 

 

 

Lapses in the preparation and issuance of POs and IARs 

  

15. Lapses were noted in the preparation and issuance of POs and IARs in PIA RO 
XI, contrary to Section 9.2 of COA Circular No. 2012-001, thus items delivered 



62 

 

may not be in accordance with the delivery terms and specifications provided in 

the POs to the detriment of the end users/recipients. 

 

Section 9.2 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 provides the basic requirements 

common to all purchases under alternative mode which include, among others, 

Purchase Order (PO)/Letter Order/Contract, duly approved by the official 

concerned and accepted by the supplier (date of acceptance must be clearly 

indicated, especially when the time or date of delivery is dependent on or will be 

counted from the date of acceptance of the purchase order/letter order/contract).  

 

Review of transactions from January 1, 2020 to September 30, 2020 disclosed 

the following lapses in the preparation and issuances of POs and IARs purchase 

orders and for disbursements totaling P305,750.54. 

 

a. No date of acceptance by the suppliers on POs with a total amount of 
P125,447.00; 

b. No specific dates of delivery of supplies indicated in the POs for purchases 
with a total amount of P156,962.54. In effect, there is no way of knowing 

whether delivery of supplies and equipment were delivered on time or not; 

and 

c. Likewise, some of the IARs lacked the date of acceptance and inspection 
of goods delivered with a total amount of P183,783.00. 

 

Inquiry with the Property/Supply Officer revealed that is has been their 

practice not to accomplish all the information in the PO and that she just followed 

and continued what was turned over to her when she was designated as Acting 

Property/Supply Officer.  

 

The explanation provided by the Property/Supply Officer is not valid and 

not acceptable in audit. It is her responsibility to observe the diligence expected of 

her in the discharge of her duties.  

 

The above deficiencies, if not corrected, defeated the purpose of the penalty 

clause provided in the PO, thus penalty for any delay, defects and/or deficiencies in 

the items delivered could not be imposed to the detriment of end users/recipients and 

to the agency as a whole. 

 

We recommended that Management instruct the Property Officer of 

PIA RO XI to properly accomplish the POs and IARs by providing the 

required information therein, and to enforce compliance by suppliers with the 

terms and conditions therein. 

 

The Management conducted a webinar for administrative and Finance 

concerns which includes the procedures in the procurement for everyone to be 

equipped on this matter.

Unnecessary surcharges  

 

16. Late payments of electric bill for the period covered December 2019 to April 
2020 resulted in unnecessary surcharges of P3,636.58, thus resulting to wastage 

of government funds, which is contrary to Section 2 of PD No. 1445. 

 

It is a policy of the State that all government resources are managed, spent or 

used in accordance with law and regulations, and safeguarded against loss or wastage 

through illegal or improper disposition to ensure efficiency, economy and 

effectiveness in operations. (PD 1445) 

  

Further, COA Circular 12-003 dated October 29, 2012, provided for the 

updated Guidelines for the Prevention and Disallowance of Irregular, Unnecessary, 

Excessive, Extravagant and Unconscionable Expenditures.  In definition of 

“unnecessary” expenditures (Section 4.1), it includes among others, one that could 

not pass the test of prudence of the diligence of a good father of a family and the 

incurrence of expenditure not dictated by the demands of a good government.  

  

In our review of the DVs  for the payment of electricity bill to Bohol Light 

Company, Inc. for Bohol Infocen revealed inclusions of surcharges amounting to 

P3,636.58 as shown below: 

 

 
 

Sound fiscal management dictates that obligations shall be settled on or before 

due dates. Had the bills been paid on time, surcharges would have been avoided.  

Penalties and surcharges are not rightful charge to the government funds.  The 

employee in-charge is duty bound to keep track of payables to avoid unnecessary 

charges. 

 

We recommended to Management that the Bohol Infocen Manager and 

the bookkeeper exercise prudence in monitoring payables and due dates to 

avoid the incurrence of surcharges because of late payment. 

 

PIA RO VII replied that the issue stemmed due to the late billing from Bohol 

Light because of the travel time and three to four days processing of the check 

payment which resorted to the delay.  Bohol Infocen was then instructed to get the 

billing statement in advance to prevent penalty dues and send it to RO through email 

or FB messenger for processing ahead of time while waiting for the original copies 

to be mailed through courier.

Delayed submission of transaction documents  

 

17. PIA ROs III, X and XI incurred delays in the submission of POs, disbursements 
vouchers and other accounting reports documents, contrary to Sections 3.2.1 

and 3.2.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-001and Section 100 of PD No. 1445. 

 

Section 3.1.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-001 requires that, within five (5) 

working days from the execution of a contract by the government,  a copy of said 

contract and each of all the documents forming part thereof by reference or 

incorporation shall be furnished to the Auditor of the agency concerned.  

 

While Section 7.2.1 (a) of COA Circular No. 2009-06 dated September 15, 

2009 states that, “The Chief Accountant, Bookkeeper or other authorized official 

performing accounting and/or bookkeeping functions of the audited agency shall 

ensure that (a) The reports and supporting documents submitted by the accountable 

officers are immediately recorded in the books of accounts and submitted to the 

Auditor within the first ten (10) days of the ensuing month.” 

It was observed that PIA RO III remained not updated in the submission of 

transaction documents and financial reports for the period February to August 2020.  

The DVs, Report of Checks Issued (RCIs) and Journal Entry Vouchers (JEVs) were 

normally submitted to the Audit Team beyond the prescribed period. The Audit Team 

have already called the attention of concerned officials regarding said deficiency, and 

despite repeated verbal demands, submission of said documents/reports accounts 

remained delayed. 

 

In PIA RO X, POs for the procurement of supplies, materials and equipment 

including for the repairs and maintenance totaling P770,422.76 were not submitted 

in advance to the Audit Team.  In addition, DVs amounting to P6,534,220.00 

including the supporting documents were not submitted to the Audit Team within 

the prescribed period.   

 

Similarly, PIA RO XI did not furnish the Audit Team with copy of 

contracts/POs relating to its various purchases of supplies and other items, printing 

and publication, repairs and maintenance and representation expenses totaling 

P603,420.20. 
 

As a consequence of delayed submission, the Audit Team was precluded from 

the timely evaluation of the transactions, and the prompt communication of the 

deficiencies to Management, if any.   

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the concerned RO 

personnel to submit the contracts/POs, transaction documents and other 

required reports to the Audit Team within the reglementary period to facilitate 

the timely review and analysis of the transactions.

Other non-compliance issues  

 

18. Presented below are the observations noted by the Audit Teams regarding 
compliance with other rules and regulations, and the corresponding 

recommendations.

acquired during the year 

were not yet issued to the 

end-users, though, these

the said IT equipment.   

 

Sec. 44, Chapter 6, Volume

as prescribed. 

 

A stale check shall be 

marked cancelled on its face 

and reported as follows: 

 

a.  Voided, spoiled or 

unclaimed stale checks with 

the Cashier shall be reported 

as cancelled in the List of 

Unreleased Checks that will 

be attached to the RCI. 

 

b.  New checks may be issued 

for the replacement of 

stale/spoiled checks in the 

hands of the payees or holders 

Stale checks amounting to 

P19,609.46 was not 

restored to cash account as 

these were not reflected in 

the CIBReg nor was 

properly recognize in the 

BRS; hence, proper 

adjustment for the 

cancellation of stale checks 

was not effected in the 

books of accounts, 

resulting in the 

understatement of the cash 

in bank account balance of 

RO V by the same amount.  

 

 

We recommended and 

Management agreed to 

advise the PIA RO V 

Accountant to report the 

stale checks in the 

CIBReg and properly 

recognize the same in the

Internal control deficiency 

of the agency led to non-

renewal before expiration 

of the PCC’s  fidelity bond.   

 

 

 

 

 

We recommended that 

the Management 

properly monitor the

any given point during 

the term of handling 

cash. Moreover, the

B. Other Areas 
 

Gender and Development (GAD)  

 

20. Management still failed to submit to the Audit Team a copy of the annual GAD 
Plan and Budget (GPB), and GAD Accomplishment Report for CY 2020, 



70 

 

contrary to COA Circular No. 2014-001; hence, the utilization of the allocated 

GAD budget and the effectiveness of the plans were not verified and evaluated. 

 

Section V of COA Circular No. 2014-001 states that the audited agency has 

the responsibility to submit a copy of the annual GPB to the COA audit team assigned 

to the agency five working days from the receipt of the approved plan from the PCW 

or their mother or central offices, as the case maybe.  Likewise, a copy of the 

corresponding Accomplishment Repot shall be furnished the said Audit Team within 

five working days from the end of January of the preceding year.  

 

However, Management has yet to submit the agency’s GPB and related 

Accomplishment Report to the Audit Team as of date despite our previous year’s 

audit recommendation.  As a result, the Audit Team was not able to verify the 

agency’s utilization of the allocated GAD budget, and to evaluate the efficiency and 

effectiveness of its GAD plans and programs in addressing gender issues.   

 

We reiterated our recommendation that Management require the GAD 

Focal person to strictly comply with COA Circular No. 2014-001 on the 

submission of a copy of the annual GPB as well the corresponding 

Accomplishment Report to the Audit Team within the prescribed period. 

 

            Management submitted a copy of the PIA’s CY 2020 GPB and 

Accomplishment Report for CY 2020 on April 14, 2021 after the receipt of the AOM.

Management Council (NDRRMC), whereby it deploys staff to the NDRRMC for 

coordination, monitoring, and dissemination of weather and disaster response alerts 

through text blasts, social media, and mainstream media during weather disturbances 

and other calamities. On a regular basis, PIA also conducts regular monitoring of 

weather updates, posts real-time situation reports, participates in earthquake and fire 

drills, and validates information sourced from the regions and media monitoring on

Compliance with Tax Laws 

 

25. PIA, acting as a withholding agent of the BIR withheld a total of ₱6,806,255.20 for 
CY 2020, remitted ₱6,101,446.24 during the year, and the remaining balance of 

₱704,808.96 was remitted in January 8, 2021.  

 

 

Compliance with GSIS Law (RA No. 8921)  

 

26. PIA complied with RA No. 8291 on the prompt remittance of GSIS contributions 
and loan amortizations deducted from salaries of its employees totaling 

₱13,277,205.38.  It remitted a total of ₱12,730,664.89 to the GSIS, the remaining 

balance of ₱546,540.49 was remitted in January 10, 2021. The negative balance of 

₱4,135,174.16 as at December 31, 2020 was an accumulation of prior years’ errors, 

which have been dormant for more than 10 years.  However, underpaid loan 

amortizations and premiums were noted in PIA RO IV-A, as herein discussed. 

paragraphs. 

 

27. Various employees of the PIA RO IV-A have under paid their loan 
amortizations totaling P39,339.04 contrary to Section 3.6 of Rule III of 

Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of  RA  No. 8291 which would  result 

in the accumulation of  penalties.  Further, a total amount of P 74,592.13 was 

reported as under paid premiums by the agency as of December 31, 2020. 

 

The IRR of RA No. 8291 provides, among other, the following:  

 

Section 6.1 The employer shall deduct from the monthly 

compensation of the employees optional life insurance premiums, 

preneed monthly installments, loan amortization and such other 

amount due the GSIS from the employee’s compensation.  

 

Section 6.2 These amounts shall be remitted to the GSIS within 

the first Ten (10) days of calendar month following the month 

when the deductions were effected, accompanied by supporting 

lists in the form prescribed by the GSIS. 

 

Review of the GSIS electronic copy of the “In –Default PIA RO IV-A - Loans” 

furnished by the GSIS to the Audit Team disclosed that a total amount of P39,339.04 

were considered arrearages on the account of the   PIA RO IV-A’s employees.   

 

Records show that the loan type consist of Consolidated Loan, Regular Policy 

Loan, Emergency Loan, Computer Loan and GSIS Financial Assistance Loan. There 

were loans granted as early as CY 2015 and the latest were granted in CY 2020.  The 

amount of underpayment ranges from P364.44 to P9,011.70 which was due to 

deficient deductions in the monthly payroll.  

 



74 

 

On the other hand, the following is the summary of unpaid premiums per 

electronic copy of the report furnished by the GSIS to the Audit Team, such copy 

which contain the details of the unpaid premiums was already sent to the PIA RO 

IV-A for appropriate action, to wit:  

 

Particulars Unpaid Balance (P) 

Personal Share (PS) 50,276.32 

Government Share (GS) 74,592.13 

Total 124,868.45 

 

Review of the report showed that the unpaid balances were mostly due to   

underpayment of PS and GS premiums attributed to salary adjustments/increases 

which were not properly computed and deducted from the employees’ salary. The 

amount of under payment ranges from P.01 to P1,906.27 which accumulated in 

months; thus, reached the total amount of P124,868.45. Likewise, timing difference 

on the date of remittance by the agency and posting in the GSIS electronic collection 

system could also be a factor in the noted discrepancies hence, there is a need for 

constant and regular reconciliation among the PIA ROIVA thru its Agency 

Authorized Officer (AAO) and the GSIS. While the PS can be simply deducted from 

the salary of the employees upon notification and reconciliation, the GS should be 

properly included in the Cash Allocation of the agency for the settlement of the 

outstanding balance. 

 

The failure to deduct and remit the correct amount of loan amortizations, PS 

and GS premiums due to GSIS was contrary to pertinent Sections of the IRR of RA 

No. 8291, and would result in the accumulation of interest and penalty on the 

outstanding balances of the borrowers/members that would significantly affect future 

claims and possible suspension of loan privileges. 

 

We recommended that the RH instruct: 

 

c. the AAO to ensure the sufficiency of the employee’s net pay after 
deducting the loan amortizations prior to loan approval;  

 

d. the Acting Accountant to deduct the correct amount of premiums and 
loan amortizations due to avoid incurrence of penalties and remit the 

same immediately to GSIS; and 

 

e. the AAO and the Acting Accountant to coordinate with the GSIS for 
the settlement of the outstanding balance of PS and GS  totaling 

P124,868.45.       

 

Management commented that they will abide by the recommendations and 

would request for a reconciliation to GSIS Pagsanjan Laguna Branch regarding loans 

and premiums.   

 



75 

 

Pag-IBIG Fund Contributions 

 

28. The PIA and its officials and employees contributed to the Home Development 
Mutual Fund (HDMF), more popularly known as the Pag-IBIG Fund, in accordance 

with RA No. 9679. The negative balance of ₱1,386,357.99 was an accumulation of 

prior years’ errors, which have been dormant for more than 10 years.   

 

 

PhilHealth Contribution 

 

29. The agency deducted properly and remitted the PhilHealth personal share of officers 
and employees pursuant to RA No. 7875, as amended by RA No. 9241 (National 

Health Insurance Act of 1995). The negative balance of ₱141,445.39 was an 

accumulation of errors in prior years’ transactions and already dormant for more than 

10 years. 

 

 

Property Insurance Law 

 

30. PIA CO and its ROs, except RO III, had provided adequate insurance coverage for 
all its insurable assets for CY 2020. 

 

31. PIA RO III failed to insure its insurable properties, assets and interests with the 
GSIS, contrary to the provisions of the Property Insurance Law or Republic Act 

656, as amended by PD 245 dated July 13, 1973, and COA Circular No. 92-390, 

thereby providing no means for recovering the value of properties in cases of 

fire, earthquake, storm, or other fortuitous event. 

 

Section 5 of Republic Act No. 656 as amended by presidential Decree No. 245, 

requires every government agency, except a municipal government below first class, 

to insure its property with the General Insurance Fund of the Government Service 

Insurance System against any insurable risk therein provided and pay the premiums 

thereon. 

 

Section 6.b of the same Act also provides, “that the responsible officials and 

employees who fail to comply with the requirements of the Property Insurance Law, 

shall be subject to the following penalties: 

 

(b) Penalties. – Any cashier, treasurer, or any government official 

responsible for the collection and/or remittance of the premiums 

hereinabove prescribed, who refuses or habitually neglects to 

comply with the instructions of the System and to collect or accept 

payments of the said premiums, issue receipts therefor, and/or 

remit the same within the time prescribed by the System, shall be 

held liable for the payment of said premiums and shall pay to the 

System a fine of two per centum per month of said premiums from  



76 

 

COA Circular No. 92-390 dated November 17, 1992 provides the 

procedure in facilitating the conduct of inventory of physical assets 

of the government, insurance and bonding of risks with the General 

Insurance Fund (GIF) of the GSIS. 

 

Moreover, the said Circular states that, “All Heads of National agencies, Local 

government units and Government-owned and controlled corporation (GOCC) shall 

be responsible for the preparation and submission of the inventory of all insurable 

physical assets xxx.” 

 

Property insurance is an insurance that protects the physical property and 

equipment of a business against loss from theft, fire or other perils; all-risk coverage 

covers against all risk; or named-peril coverage covers only against since Philippine 

Information Agency (PIA) Regional Office No. 3 is renting or leasing the building, 

its contents can be insured separately. 

 

In relation thereto, the Management should submit their respective inventories 

of property appraisal of the amount of premium during the month of October of each 

fiscal year to be paid for the insurance of the property. 

 

We recommended that all insurable assets/properties of PIA RO III be 

insured with the General Insurance Fund of the GSIS in compliance with COA 

Circular No. 92-390 to protect the interest of the agency and the government as 

a whole. 

 

Management acknowledged their failure to insure its insurable properties 

because of restrictions brought about by the Covid19 pandemic and assured the Audit 

Team that they will file for renewal of insurance of all the agency’s insurable assets 

and properties.  

 

 

Status of Audit Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges 

 

32. There was a Notice Disallowance issued in CY 2020 amounting to ₱4,550,690.29 for 
suspension that matured into disallowance.  The amount of ₱208,120.00 pertains to 

unsettled disallowances of prior years.
