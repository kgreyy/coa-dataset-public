The PIA Central Office (PIA-CO) and its 16 Regional Offices (ROs) and 78 

Provincial Information Centers nationwide continued to maximize the use of 

various communication platforms and engage with institutional partners and 

networks to further resonate development down to the grassroots. 

 

The PIA provides technical assistance to other government agencies by way 

of communication plan development, content creation, preparation of creative 

briefs, events management, multi-sectoral consultations, communication research, 

capability building, and production and dissemination of multimedia materials. 

 

A total of 24,436 situation reports (sitreps) on significant events of national 

interest happening in the regions were generated by the PIA regional offices.  

Situation reports are real-time on-ground reports about local issues and events 

which the Agency’s field offices send on a daily basis on the Central Office via 

SMS and/or email.

The Statement of Appropriations, Allotments, Obligations, Disbursements

D. Scope of Audit 
 

The audit covered the accounts and operations of the PIA for CY 2020.  It 

was conducted to: a) ascertain the level of assurance that may be placed on the 

Management’s assertion on the financial statements; b) determine the propriety of 

transactions as well as extent of compliance on the applicable laws, rules and 

regulations; c) recommend agency’s improvement opportunities; and d) determine 

the extent of implementation of prior year’s audit recommendations.  Moreover, the 

audit was conducted in accordance with International Standards of Supreme Audit 

Institutions (ISSAIs). 

 

 

E. Independent Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements 
 

The Auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of 

the financial statements of PIA as at December 31, 2020 due to the existence of 

abnormal/negative balances of P9,013,774.90 that reduced the ending balance of 

the inter-agency payables accounts totaling P204,891,532.90. 

 

 

F. Summary of Significant Observations and Recommendations 
 

The following are the other audit observations and the corresponding 

recommendations:  

 

1. Additional cash advances (CAs) were granted to PIA Regional Offices (ROs) 
despite non-liquidation or settlement of previous CAs, in violation of Section 

89 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 and COA Circular No. 97-002 dated 



iv 

 

February 10, 1997, resulting in the accumulation of unliquidated CA totaling 

₱85,525,292.71 as at December 31, 2020. (Paragraph no.1) 

 

We reiterated our recommendation that Management: 

 

a. issue demand letters to all ROs for the liquidation of their CAs, 
considering that the purpose for which the cash advances were granted had 

already been served; and to withhold the salaries of those who failed to 

liquidate their CAs until such time the liquidation is completed; 

 

b. monitor unliquidated CAs to avoid long outstanding accounts; henceforth, 
institute measures to ensure that AOs strictly comply with the regulations 

on CAs. 

 

2. The monthly Bank Reconciliation Statement (BRS) of PIA CO for CYs 2019 
and 2020 for the Cash in Bank- Local Currency, Current Account (LCCA) and 

Cash-Modified Disbursement Sytem (MDS) accounts for CY 2020 were not 

prepared, thus, the difference of P26,165,197.19 between the books and bank 

balances could not be ascertained and reconciling items, if any, were not 

identified for appropriate adjustment. (Paragraph no. 2) 

 

We recommended that Management direct the OIC, Finance and Management 

Division (FMD) to require the OIC, Accounting Section/responsible accounting 

personnel to: 

 

a. immediately prepare and submit to the Audit Team the BRS for the PIA 
CO’s bank and MDS accounts for said prior period up to current month;  

 

b. henceforth, strictly comply with the COA rules and regulations on the 
regular preparation and submission of the monthly BRS and to the Audit 

Team within the prescribed period; and 

 

c. enforce the sanction (reprimand or withholding of salary) on the 
responsible accounting officer/personnel who will fail to comply with the 

audit recommendations.  

 

3. Several office equipment of PIA RO V totaling P255,632 with unit cost of 
above the P15,000.00 capitalization threshold were erroneously classified as 

semi-expendable, thus, inadvertently omitted in the Report of Physical Count 

of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE), contrary to Section 4, Chapter 

10, Volume I of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National 

Government Agencies (NGAs). (Paragraph no. 3) 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Property Officer to 

appropriately classify each asset according to type, condition and cost and 

prepare separate RPCPPE, in this case, for the Office Equipment. 



v 

 

4. The respective balance of the Due from NGAs and Due from GOCCs accounts 
was misstated due to erroneous recording of transactions, thereby, affecting the 

reliability of the financial statements.  (Paragraph no. 4) 

 

We recommended that Management instruct the OI, Accounting Section to: 

 

a. effect the necessary adjustments to reflect the correct balances of the 
affected accounts; and 

 

b. exercise diligence and attentiveness in the review of transactions before 
recording in the books to prevent errors.  

 

5. Unutilized fund transfers from NGAs and Government-Owned/Controlled 
Corporations (GOCCs) amounting to P110,173,949.96 and P39,118,303.18, 

respectively, were not returned to the source agencies (SAs) despite completion 

of projects, contrary to the pertinent provisions of COA Circular No. 94-013 

dated December 13, 1994 and related Memorandum of Agreements (MOAs). 

However, the total amount of P149,292,253.14 that should be returned to the 

SAs does not reconcile with the balance of the PIA’s trust account with the 

Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) which amounted to only P119,834,655.58, or a 

difference of P29,457,597.56, thereby, casting doubts on the correctness of the 

balances of the accounts Due to NGAs. (Paragraph no. 5) 

 

We recommended that Management instruct the OIC, Accounting Section to: 

 

a. prioritize the analysis/reconciliation of the Due to NGAs, Due from 
GOCCs and Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, Trust accounts in order to 

establish the correct balances. Thereafter, immediately facilitate the return 

of the unused project funds to the SAs; 

 

b. initiate the reconciliation process for the PIA’s trust account with the BTr; 
and 

 

c. henceforth, strictly abide by COA Circular No. 94-013 on the return of the 
unused balance of fund transfer to the SA upon completion of the 

project/purpose.   

 

6. Unserviceable properties of PIA ROs IV-B, V, VI, XII and XIII remained 
undisposed contrary to Section 79 of PD No. 1445, exposing them to further 

deterioration and diminution of resale value, including the deprivation of the 

agency of the maximum utilization of space occupied by the properties. 

(Paragraph no. 6) 

 

 

 

 



vi 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a. require the respective RO Property Officer to prepare an updated IIRUP 
duly approved by proper officials, with all the necessary supporting 

documents, including appraisal thereof, for appropriate action of the 

Disposal Committee; and 

 

b. ensure that proper disposal procedures are undertaken in accordance with 
existing rules and regulations. 

 

7. The provision of two mobile phones with postpaid line subscription to 
ineligible personnel, upgrading of plans, mobile phone usage in excess of the 

allowable limit/plan and non-deduction of the excess usage from the device 

user’s salary of the PIA CO, CAR and RO IV-A were contrary to PIA Office 

Order No. 21 dated March 19, 2018. (Paragraph no. 7) 

 

We recommended that Management:  

 

a. revisit the policy guidelines to include specific provision on the upgrading 
of plans, if deemed necessary; 

 

b. instruct the OIC, Administrative Division to (i) to assign personnel who 
will review the monthly billings before payment so that proper action on 

excess usage could be immediately taken; and (ii) see to it that only the 

prescribed plan to each eligible personnel is provided; 

 

c. require the OIC, Accounting Section to immediately bill the concerned 
personnel for the excess usage and recognize the same as receivable in the 

books upon recording of the payment of the monthly statement of 

account/billing, and ensure that the excess usage is automatically deducted 

from the user’s salary; and 

 

d. direct all personnel with agency-issued mobile phones to strictly observe 
their monthly authorized mobile limit/plan. 

 

8. The Regional Head (RH) of PIA RO VII claimed Transportation Allowance 
(TA) totaling P60,000.00 despite being issued government vehicle in her name, 

in violation of National Budget Circular (NBC) No. 548 dated May 15, 2013, 

hence, considered, illegal pursuant to COA Circular No. 2012-003. (Paragraph 

no. 8) 

 

We recommended that the RH explain the receipt of monthly TA.  Likewise, 

we recommended that Management stop paying TA to officials who are 

assigned or issued government vehicles, in strict compliance with COA 

Circular 2012-003, and pursuant to NBC No. 548 on the rules and regulations 



vii 

 

on the grant of Representation Allowance and Transportation Allowance 

(RATA). 

 

9. Payment of hazard pay to PIA RO VII personnel was excessive by 
P104,500.00 in violation of Department of Budget and Management Budget 

Circular (DBM BC) No. 2020-01. (Paragraph no. 9) 

 

We recommended that PIA RO VII explain the grant of hazard pay to 

personnel whose work stations are not declared under the ECQ; and submit to 

the audit Team the DTRs to support the claim. 

 

10. Representation expenses amounting to P125,161.48 were incurred for the 
meals and snacks of PIA RO XI’s employees while conducting ordinary office 

work and for activities/programs with few or no guests; thus, considered as 

unnecessary expenditures per COA Circular No. 2012-003 resulting in the 

improper utilization of funds that could be used for more relevant activities of 

the agency. (Paragraph no. 10) 

 

We recommended that Management: 

 

a. submit a written justification on the incurrence of representation expenses 
amounting to P125,161.48 which were considered unnecessary; 

 

b. submit a copy of the approved Office Order/Memorandum authorizing the 
conduct of virtual pressers; 

 

c. specify and indicate the resource requirements on the Activity Design to 
determine the number of participants, including the personnel from PIA 

RO XI, who attended the activity/program. This is to ensure that only 

those involved in the program shall be authorized to attend the activity; 

 

d. refrain from incurring representation expenses for activities considered as 
ordinary office work; and 

 

e. strictly observe prudence in the use of government funds by ensuring that 
these are utilized only for expenses which are valid and necessary. 

 

11. PIA RO XI paid for office supplies amounting to P6,246.43 that cannot be 
utilized due to the negligence of the Requisitioner who failed to consider the 

correct specifications of the items prior to its procurement, thus resulting in the 

incurrence of unnecessary expenses and wastage of government resources. 

(Paragraph no. 11) 

 

 

 

 



viii 

 

We recommended that Management: 

 

a. hold the Acting Bookkeeper personally liable for the one (1) unit printer 
toner that cannot be replaced by the supplier and order the refund of 

P3,123.20 from her; and 

 

b. impose disciplinary sanctions on the erring personnel, including the 
Inspection Officer, for their negligence. 

 

12. Expenses amounting to  P280,947.18 from January 1 to November 30, 2020 
were directly reimbursed  by PIA RO I employees to the General Fund (GF) of 

the agency, in which the amount of  P126,973.60 should have been paid 

directly to the suppliers/creditors through checks, the amount of  P36,534.61 

could have been reimbursed through their Petty Cash Fund (PCF) and the 

amount of  P117,438.97 could have been paid out of special cash advance 

pursuant to COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997, thus affecting 

the agency’s effectiveness in handling cash through the imprest system. 

(Paragraph no. 12) 

 

We recommended and Management agreed that they will refrain from directly 

reimbursing expenses to the agency fund, petty expenses shall be reimbursed 

through the PCF only, and implementation of COA Circular 97-002 shall be 

strictly observed. 

 

13. The validity and propriety of disbursements of PIA ROs I, III and XI in the 
respective amounts of P139,425.31, P1,250,481.72 and P191,321.01, could not 

be ascertained due to insufficient documentary requirements, as prescribed 

under COA Circular 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012, contrary to Section 4(6) of 

PD No. 1445.  (Paragraph no. 13) 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to support the Disbursement 

Vouchers (DVs) with the documentary requirements as prescribed under COA 

Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012. 

 

14. PIA RO I still has insufficient internal control over safeguarding their assets, 
particularly their PPE which is not in conformity with the principal objectives 

of an internal control. (Paragraph no. 14) 

 

We reiterated the recommendation that Management address their need on 

security services to cover the physical safeguarding of PPE 24 hours a day, 

seven days a week and make a strong representation with the higher authority 

to request for additional budgetary requirements to cover the said security 

services expense. 

 

15. Lapses were noted in the preparation and issuance of Purchase Orders (POs) 
and Inspection and Acceptance Reports (IARs) in PIA RO XI, contrary to 



ix 

 

Section 9.2 of COA Circular No. 2012-001, thus items delivered may not be in 

accordance with the delivery terms and specifications provided in the POs to 

the detriment of the end users/recipients. (Paragraph no. 15) 

 

We recommended that Management instruct the Property Officer of PIA RO 

XI to properly accomplish the POs and IARs by providing the required 

information therein, and to enforce compliance by suppliers with the terms 

and conditions therein. 

 

16. Late payments of electric bill for the period covered December 2019 to April 
2020 resulted in unnecessary surcharges of P3,636.58, thus resulting to 

wastage of government funds, which is contrary to Section 2 of PD No. 1445. 

(Paragraph no. 16) 

 

We recommended to Management that the Bohol Information Center (Infocen) 

Manager and the bookkeeper exercise prudence in monitoring payables and 

due dates to avoid the incurrence of surcharges because of late payment. 

 

17. PIA ROs III, X and XI incurred delays in the submission of POs, 
disbursements vouchers and other accounting reports documents, contrary to 

Sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-001and Section 100 of PD 

No. 1445. (Paragraph no. 17) 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the concerned RO 

personnel to submit the contracts/POs, transaction documents and other 

required reports to the Audit Team within the reglementary period to facilitate 

the timely review and analysis of the transactions.  

 

18. Management still failed to submit to the Audit Team a copy of the annual 
Gender and Development Plan and Budget (GPB), and GAD Accomplishment 

Report for CY 2020, contrary to COA Circular No. 2014-001; hence, the 

utilization of the allocated GAD budget and the effectiveness of the plans were 

not verified and evaluated.  (Paragraph no. 20) 

 

We reiterated our recommendation that Management require the GAD Focal 

person to strictly comply with COA Circular No. 2014-001 on the submission 

of a copy of the annual GPB as well the corresponding Accomplishment 

Report to the Audit Team within the prescribed period. 

 

19. Various employees of the PIA RO IV-A have under paid their loan 
amortizations totaling P39,339.04 contrary to Section 3.6 of Rule III of 

Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA No. 8291 which would 

result in the accumulation of  penalties.  Further, a total amount of P 74,592.13 

was reported as under paid premiums by the agency as of December 31, 2020. 

(Paragraph no. 27) 

 



x 

 

We therefore recommended that the RH instruct: 

 

c. the AAO to ensure the sufficiency of the employee’s net pay after 
deducting the loan amortizations prior to loan approval; 

  

d. the Acting Accountant to deduct the correct amount of premiums and loan 
amortizations due to avoid incurrence of penalties and remit the same 

immediately to GSIS; and 

 

e. the AAO and the Acting Accountant to coordinate with the GSIS for the 
settlement of the outstanding balance of PS and GS totaling P124,868.45.       

 

20. PIA RO III failed to insure its insurable properties, assets and interests with the 
GSIS, contrary to the provisions of the Property Insurance Law or Republic 

Act 656, as amended by PD 245 dated July 13, 1973, and COA Circular No. 

92-390, thereby providing no means for recovering the value of properties in 

cases of fire, earthquake, storm, or other fortuitous event. (Paragraph no. 31) 

 

We recommended that all insurable assets/properties of PIA RO III be insured 

with the General Insurance Fund of the GSIS in compliance with COA 

Circular No. 92-390 to protect the interest of the agency and the government as 

a whole. 

 

The Summary of Audit Observations and Recommendations (SAOR) was 

transmitted to Management on May 3, 2021.  Management submitted their 

comments and were considered in the report, where appropriate.  The details of the 

above observations were discussed in Part II of this report.  

 

 

G. Implementation of Prior Year’s Audit Recommendations 
 

Of the 30 audit recommendations contained in CY 2020 Annual Audit Report 

(AAR), 20 were implemented, and 10 were not implemented.  The details are 

presented in Part III of this report.
