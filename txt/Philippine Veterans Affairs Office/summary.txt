	 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 





A)		Introduction

	

The Philippine Veterans Affairs Office (PVAO) was created pursuant to Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1 dated 24 September 1972 through Letter of Implementation (LOI) No. 19 dated 24 December 1972 under the supervision of Department of National Defense (DND) which consequently phased out the Philippine Veterans Administration. As the primary government office that caters to the needs of the veterans, PVAO administers old age, disability, and death pension payments to veterans and beneficiaries under Republic Act (RA) Nos. 6048 and 7696 and other Philippine laws. PVAO also administers burial claims, educational and hospitalization benefits to veterans and surviving spouses and dependents.



Pursuant to Executive Order (EO) No. 366 dated 4 October 2004, the PVAO Rationalization Plan was approved on 29 June 2010 changing the Agency’s “benefit based” structure to an “activity/process-oriented” or function-based organization.



The agency’s functions are to: (a) formulate policies concerning ex-servicemen’s affairs, including their placement and training as well as assistance to widows, dependents and retired personnel; (b) adjudicate and administer their benefits, pensions and other privileges granted to veterans, their heirs and beneficiaries; (c) provide medical care and treatment to veterans pursuant to existing laws; and (d) administer, develop and maintain eight national military shrines, to wit:



			1)		Balantang Memorial Cemetery in Jaro, Iloilo City

			2)		Capas National Shrine in Capas, Tarlac

			3)		Kiangan National Shrine in Kiangan, Ifugao

			4)		Libingan ng mga Bayani (LNMB) in Taguig City

			5)		Mt. Samat National Shrine in Pilar, Bataan

			6)		Ricarte National Shrine in Batac, Ilocos Norte

			7)		USAFIP-NL Military Shrine in La Union

			8)		PEFTOK Korean War Memorial Hall in Taguig City 

	

PVAO has a total workforce of 445 personnel. Out of 356 authorized plantilla positions, only 333 positions were filled-up, of which 240 are from the Central Office and 93 are from the Field Service Extension Offices (FSEOs). Shortages of regular employees were augmented by 112 Contract of Service as of December 31, 2020. It is headed by Lt. Gen. Ernesto G. Carolina, AFP (Ret) as Administrator and assisted by MGen.

E)	Summary of Observations and Recommendations

						1)		 The propriety of the Cash-in-Bank – Local Currency, Current Account (CIB-LCCA), Regular account amounting to ₱1,009,590,147.12 cannot be ascertained due to: a) unrecorded book reconciling items amounting to ₱453,374,015.25 which misstate the affected accounts in the financial statements; and b) accounting deficiencies such as uncorrected error in the Subsidiary Ledger (SL) totalling ₱23,400.00 and reconciling items amounting to ₱408,894,059.78 without supporting documents. (Observation No. 1)

	

	We reiterated our previous years’ recommendations that Management require the: a) Accounting Section (AS) to: i) coordinate/communicate with the Government Accountancy Sector (GAS), COA, through e-ticket to properly log deficiencies and facilitate actions on problems encountered in the e-NGAS, and thereafter make constant follow up; ii) record immediately all documented transactions to reflect the actual balance of the accounts; iii) adjust the entry for stale checks by debiting the Cash in Bank – LCCA Regular and crediting the appropriate accounts previously debited; b) Bank Reconciliation Unit (BRU) to: i) immediately coordinate with the Finance Division (FD) on the noted unrecorded deposits to assist in identifying and monitoring deposits in the account of the agency; ii) in coordination with the  FD and the AS, exert more efforts in identifying and documenting unaccounted reconciling items pertaining to closed bank accounts and other reconciling items which over/understates the book balance and immediately adjust all identified and documented reconciling items; and c) FD in coordination with the Head of BRU,  to immediately and continuously exert more efforts to secure from the depository bank, copies of DMs/CMs and other documents to substantiate recording of the transactions in the books of accounts.

						2)		The collectability of past due accounts amounting to ₱50,169,200.85 or 52.09 percent of the total reported Other Receivables account of ₱96,310,013.79 is doubtful due to: a) dormant accounts totalling ₱29,091,396.00 aged more than 10 years; b) unsettled cash advances (CAs) of Accountable Officers (AOs) totalling ₱21,028,284.95 who are either retired, resigned, terminated, transferred or deceased; and c) unreconciled/undocumented receivables amounting to ₱49,519.90. (Observation No. 2)

	

	We recommended that Management require the Accountant to: a) strictly adhere with the provisions of COA Circular No. 97-002 on the granting and liquidation of CAs; b) exhaust all possible remedies to recover outstanding balances of CAs from (i) retired, resigned, terminated and transferred AOs by locating their whereabouts to be able to send demand letters thereafter; and (ii) for deceased AOs, request for authority to write-off the accounts pursuant to COA Circular No. 2016-005; and c) exert extra effort to locate the documents regarding the unreconciled/undocumented balances.

	

						3)		The accuracy and reliability of the Due from NGAs account balance of ₱109,275,156.20 cannot be ascertained due to non-reconciliation of PVAO’s records of fund transfers with that of the VMMC and DBM-PS showing a total discrepancy of ₱4,690,661.94. Moreover, funds transferred to various NGAs totaling ₱74,937,172.77 aged more than a year to over five years were not liquidated as a result of inadequate monitoring of project implementation and non-adherence to the provisions of the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA). (Observation No. 3)

	

	We reiterated our previous years’ recommendations that Management: a) closely coordinate with the IAs to enforce liquidation of outstanding fund transfers (FTs) or demand the refund of unexpended balances; b) create a Monitoring Team that would coordinate with IAs to determine the status of project implementation; c) see to it that all mandatory provisions on the responsibilities of both parties stipulated in the MOA are complied with; d) direct the AS to intensify its efforts to reconcile its records with that of the IAs through regular coordination particularly VMMC and DBM-PS; and e)  require the designated Supply Officer to reconcile on regular basis their records with the DBM-PS as to balances of undelivered/delivered goods out of the advance payments made. 

	

						4)		Funds transferred to the Philippine International Trading Corporation (PITC) for procurement of goods/services for three projects worth ₱6,004,000.00 aged nearly three years are yet to be delivered nor implemented as of December 31, 2020; thus, depriving the Agency of its immediate use. (Observation No. 4)

	

	We recommended that Management: a) continuously monitor the timelines of procurement activities and progress of all PVAO projects outsourced from PITC to ensure efficient delivery/completion of projects; and b) require PITC to fast track the implementation of the projects or demand the refund of unutilized FTs in case procurement process has not been proceeded/started.

	

						5)		The accuracy and reliability of the balances of PPE accounts totaling ₱484,456,553.24 as of December 31, 2020 cannot be ascertained due to: a) failure of the AS and General Services and Support Management (GSSMD) to conduct regular reconciliation of their records which resulted in unreconciled difference of ₱51,546,595.19 between the balances per books and per RPCPPE; b) unreconciled balances between the GL and the SL for Other Structures account with variance of ₱248,230.50; c) inclusion of properties totaling ₱5,679,681.70 each item costing less than ₱15,000.00; and  d) erroneous classification of various items totaling ₱9,365,215.62 which resulted in either overstatement or understatement of the affected PPE accounts; e) inclusion of lost property amounting to  ₱599,999.00. Moreover, the accuracy of the RPCPPE as of December 31, 2020 is doubtful due to various deficiencies noted such as: a) erroneous classification of PPE; b) double recording of some PPEs; and c) inclusion of one item costing below the capitalization threshold of ₱15,000.00 (Observation No. 5)

	

	We reiterated our previous years’ recommendations that Management require the: a) AS and GSSMD to: i) collaborate an effective system by which their records are reconciled regularly and the results of the physical count tally with the amount recorded in the books of accounts; and ii) make necessary adjustments to correct deficiencies noted either in the books or in the Inventory Report, where appropriate, to reflect the correct balances of PPE accounts; iii) reclassify erroneously classified items to its appropriate PPE accounts in order to reflect correct balances of affected accounts; and iv) observe proper account classification in recording transactions for proper presentation of the accounts in the Financial Statements and in the Inventory Report; b) Chief Accountant to: i) determine the cause/s of the unreconciled amount and exert efforts to identify details/composition of unreconciled balances; and ii) analyze negative balances recorded in the books and make necessary adjustments; c) GSSMD to: i) take immediate and appropriate action on the disposal of unserviceable properties to avoid further deterioration, possible loss of their value and to generate additional income from its disposal; ii) fast track submission of documents to the AS concerning disposed Mitsubishi Lancer and lost Hyundai Mini Bus considering that these issues are not  resolved for years; and iii) shed light on the true condition/status of the L-300 vehicle. Moreover, we also recommended that Management implement COA Circular No. 2020-006 dated January 31, 2020 for the one-time cleansing of PPE balances, if appropriate. 

	

						6)		The Accounts Payable account with a balance amounting to ₱12,238,767.29 includes liabilities totaling ₱1,370,956.29 which have been outstanding for more than two years contrary to existing laws, rules and regulations. (Observation No. 6)

	

	We recommended that Management require the AS to: a) investigate the difference amounting to ₱1,230,014.29 between the GL and SL balances of DCI Konstruct, Inc., and Rolosa Construction and Supplies; b) review and determine if dormant balances are still valid obligations; if not, revert those payables which have been outstanding for two years or more, pursuant to existing laws, rules, and regulations; c) effect the necessary adjustment on the account of Tadtad Joel Posada and maintain only one SL sfor each creditor; and d) regularly review payables particularly those with material amount to ensure that only those rightful obligations are recorded properly in the books of accounts and presented in the FS.

	

						7)		     The balance of Pension Benefits Payable account totaling ₱1,492,383,025.99 is doubtful due to the discrepancy of ₱937,573,009.76 between balance per books against the PVAO’s servicing banks and financial institutions’ records. Moreover, inadequate monitoring of pension liquidations resulted in the accumulation of unliquidated pension remittances totaling ₱1,492,383,025.99 hence, not in accordance with Sections 74, 111, and 124 of P.D.1445 and the provisions in the MOA between the PVAO and its servicing banks and financial institutions. (Observation No. 7)

	

	We recommended that Management: a) require the Head of AS and BRU to identify and document noted difference amounting to ₱937,573,009.76 between the balances per books  against the BRS and SOR to reflect the correct balance; b) submit the list of pensioners to support pension benefits payable amounting to ₱1,492,383,025.99; c) analyze erroneous adjusting entries pertaining to prior years’ transactions; d) prepare and submit adjustments with sufficient supporting documents; and e) implement monitoring schemes to avoid differences in reporting of the balances of the account.

	

						8)		Various accounting errors, omissions and deficiencies were noted in recording repairs and maintenance of the Agency’s assets which resulted in the misstatements of the affected accounts in the financial statements. (Observation No. 8)

	

	We recommended that Management require the AS to: a) prepare necessary adjusting entries to correct deficiencies noted and observe caution in using the proper classification of accounts in recording transactions; b) reclassify the progress billing to the appropriate Construction in Progress account; and c) submit the lacking documents to support the claims.

	

						9)		     The validity and propriety of various COVID-related expenditures totaling ₱3,108,937.73 cannot be ascertained due to incomplete documentation, contrary to the provisions of Section 4 of PD 1445, COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 and COA Memorandum No. 2020-019 dated November 9, 2020. (Observation No. 9)

	

	We recommended that Management: a) submit the lacking documents and henceforth ensure completeness of supporting documents for all disbursements in accordance with the existing laws, rules and regulations before processing of claims; and b) comply with the period of submission of reports pursuant to Section 60(c), Chapter 19 of the GAM for the NGAs Volume I.   

	

Other equally significant audit observations and recommendations were also noted and discussed in detail under Part II of this report.



	 The above findings and recommendations were discussed with the concerned officials of the agency in an exit conference held on March 12, 2021. Management’s views and reactions were considered in the report, where appropriate.

	

	

F)	Status of Implementation of Prior Year’s Audit Recommendations
