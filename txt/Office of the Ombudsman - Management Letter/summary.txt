Commonwealth Avenue, Quezon City





	

May 11, 2021



	

Honorable JUSTICE SAMUEL R. MARTIRES                   

Ombudsman 

Office of the Ombudsman

Agham Road, Diliman, Quezon City



Dear Hon. Justice Martires:



Management Letter on the audit of the

Office of the Ombudsman 

for the year ended December 31, 2020

	

1)			Pursuant to Section 2, Article IX–D of the Constitution of the Philippines and Section 43 of the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines (PD 1445), we have audited the accounts and operations of the Office of the Ombudsman-Central Office (OMB-CO), Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for Luzon (OMB-Luzon), Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for the Military and Other Law Enforcement Offices (OMB-MOLEO), Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP), Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for Visayas (OMB-Visayas) and Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for Mindanao (OMB-Mindanao) for the year ended December 31, 2020.  The audit was conducted in accordance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, and generally accepted state auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain a reasonable basis for our conclusions.

		

2)			The audit was conducted to: a) ascertain the propriety of the financial transactions and operations of the agency; b) ascertain compliance with prescribed rules and regulations; c) recommend agency improvement opportunities; and d) determine the extent of implementation of prior years’ audit recommendations.

	

3)			We wish to bring to your attention our audit observations and recommendations which were earlier communicated through Audit Observation Memorandum (AOM) to the concerned officials of the OMB. Their responses were incorporated in this Management Letter (ML), where appropriate. 

	

4)			In compliance with COA Memorandum No. 2014-11 dated October 21, 2014, this ML is issued in lieu of a Consolidated Annual Audit Report (CAAR) due to the non-submission of the required CY 2020 Financial Statement (FS) more than 30 days after the prescribed due date.

Detailed Audit Observations and Recommendations





NON-FINANCIAL ISSUES



Delayed/Non-Submission of Financial Reports



6)			Non-submission of financial reports and supporting schedules/documents precluded the Audit Team to conduct review and evaluation of the transactions to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence in rendering an audit opinion on the financial statements of the OMB.



	1)		Section 122 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 requires the submission of reports and states that: whenever deemed necessary in the exigencies of the service, the Commission, may under regulations issued by it, require the agency heads, chief accountants, budget officers, cashiers, disbursing officers, administrative or personnel officers, and other responsible officials of the various agencies to submit trial balances, physical inventory reports, current plantilla of personnel, and such other reports as may be necessary for the exercise of its functions.

	

	2)		Likewise, Section 41 of PD No. 1445. Annual Report of the Commission, states that:



1)	The Commission shall submit to the President, (the Congress), not later than the last day of September of each year, an annual report on the financial condition and results of operation of all agencies of the government which shall include recommendations of measures necessary to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of these agencies.



2)	To carry out the purposes of this section, the chief accountant or the official in charge or keeping the accounts of a government agency shall submit to the Commission year-end trial balances and such other supporting or subsidiary statements as may be required by the Commission not later than the fourteenth day of February. Trial balances returned by the Commission for revision due to non-compliance with accounting rules and regulations, shall be resubmitted within three days after the date of receipt by the official concerned.



3)	Failure on the part of any official or employee to comply with the provisions of the immediately preceding paragraph shall cause the automatic suspension of the payment of his salary and other emoluments until he shall have complied there with. The violation of these provisions for at least three times shall subject the offender to administrative disciplinary action.



	3)		The auditor shall form an opinion on whether the financial statements are prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework.  In order to form that opinion, the auditor shall conclude as to whether the auditor has obtained reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. That conclusion shall take into account: a) The auditor’s conclusion, in accordance with ISA 330, whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence has been obtained; b) The auditor’s conclusion, in accordance with ISA 450, whether uncorrected misstatements are material, individually or in aggregate; xx (ISSA 1700/ISA 700)



	4)		Sections 5 and 46, Chapter 19 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume I enumerates the complete set of financial statements (FS) (condensed and by fund cluster) and interim FS, respectively to be submitted by an entity which shall include the following: 

	

--		Statement of Financial Position; 

--		Statement of Financial Performance; 

--		Statement of Changes in Net Assets/Equity;

--		Statement of Cash Flows;

--		Statement of Comparison of Budget and Actual Amount; and

--		Notes to FS comprising a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory notes. 

	

	5)		Section 60, Chapter 19 of the same Manual also prescribes the deadline on the submission of the following financial statements and schedules for the Central/Head/Main Offices, as follows:

	

	 Entity/Office   Statement/Report             Deadline                              Submit to

	  

	 Monthly          TBs and SSs     Ten days after the end of the month    Auditor, DBM

	Quarterly          TB, FSs, SSs     Ten days after the end of the quarter   Auditor, DBM      

	 Yearend          TB, FSs, SSs      February 14 of the following year      Auditor, DBM

	

	6)		Section 7.2.1a of COA Circular No. 2009-006 requires that the Chief Accountant, Bookkeeper or other authorized official performing accounting and/or bookkeeping functions of the audited agency shall ensure that the reports and supporting documents submitted by the Accountable Officers are immediately recorded in the books of accounts and submitted to the Auditor within the first ten (10) days of the ensuing month.

	

	7)		Section 5, Chapter 21, GAM Volume I, requires that Chief Accountant/Designated Staff shall within 10 days from receipt of the monthly Bank Statement (BS) together with the paid checks, original copies of Debit Memoranda/Credit Memoranda from the Government Servicing Bank (GSB), reconcile the BS with the general ledger and prepare the Bank Reconciliation Statements in four copies.

	

	8)		DBM Circular Letter 2018-9 dated September 6, 2018 on the Guidelines Prescribing Electronic Submission of Budget and Financial Accountability Reports (BFARs) reiterates the quarterly submission of BFARs to the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) and the Commission on Audit (COA) as prescribed under the COA — DBM Joint Circular No. 2014-1 (Guidelines Prescribing the Use of Modified Formats of the Budget and Financial Accountability Reports [BFARs]), dated July 2, 2014; and COA Circular No. 2015-005 (Availability of Web-based Annual Financial Reporting System [AFR5), dated July 16, 2015.

	11)		While electronic copies of the year end FSs were submitted through email on February 14, 2021, these reports were not updated, since verification of the accounts showed that these were not reconciled with the General Ledger. Moreover, due to the absence of Post-Closing Trial Balance in the submitted reports, the figures indicated in the FS are the extension of the balances in the Pre-Closing Trial Balance, rendering the report incomplete.  The official (hard) copy of these FSs were not yet submitted up to this date.

	 

	12)		The Accountant explained that delays in the submission of various accounting reports and supporting documents were attributed to the pandemic that affected the whole country and caused work suspensions. Since health protocols were implemented, the agency had adopted an Alternative Work Arrangement where employees could not report at the office premises at same time, causing delay in the preparation and submission of the needed reports.

	

	13)		While we acknowledged the consequences of the declaration of community quarantine and the risk brought about by the pandemic, capacitating employees with equipment such as laptops and information access could have been done at the onset or even before the community quarantine.  

	

	14)		Failure to submit the financial reports and supporting documents to the COA Auditors within the prescribed period hindered the appropriate review and evaluation of the transactions, thus, precluded the Audit Team from conducting timely audit and early detection and/or correction of errors that could have been readily relayed to Management for immediate appropriate action.

	

	15)		Ultimately, incomplete/non-submission of financial reports and supporting schedules/documents deprived the Auditor from obtaining sufficient appropriate audit evidence to conclude as to whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatements due to fraud or error.

	

	16)		We recommended that Management require the:



a)	Accountant to submit financial reports and supporting schedules/ documents immediately; and



b)	Financial Management and Information Office to assess the needs of the Accounting Division of equipment and information access to lessen work disruption.





Delayed/non-submission of reports for collections

	

7)			Delays in the issuance of Official Receipts (ORs) on collections from clearance fee; in submitting Report of Collections and Deposits (RCD);  non- preparation of Cash Receipts Record (CRRec); and delayed/non-submission of the Report of Accountability for Accountable Forms (RAAF), hindered a full accounting and reconciliation of collections and deposits for CY 2020 and precluded the Auditors from conducting complete examination of the accounts to detect errors and recommend corrections thereof.

	

	1)		A sound system of internal control shall be installed, implemented and monitored by the Management primarily by its Head. (Section 124, PD 1445).

	

	2)		Receipts/Collections shall refer to all cash actually received from all sources during a given accounting period. (Section 33(b), Chapter 1, GAM, Volume I).

	

	3)		Among the internal controls over collections are expressed under GAM, such as follows:



Section 4 (e), Chapter 2 - No payment of any nature shall be received by a collecting officer without immediately issuing an official receipt in acknowledgement thereof. The receipts are subject to proper custody, accountability, and audit. (Section 68 (1), PD 1445)

	

Section 39, Chapter 5 which provides the RCD, such that, receipts and deposits shall be reported as follows:



a)	At the close of the business day, the CO shall prepare the RCD for submission to Accounting Office/Unit. The report lists all the ORs issued in numerical sequence including cancelled ones.



b)	The RCD shall be supported by documentary evidence such as duplicate copies of ORs and validated deposit slips.



c)	The Collecting government entity issuing electronic Official Receipt (eOR) should generate and submit daily to the Auditor a copy of the RCD. In case the collection system is not integrated with the accounting system, the Accounting Division/Unit shall recognize the collections and deposits based on the generated reports duly certified by the CO/Cashier/Head of Cash/Treasury Unit.



d)	Field Offices (FOs)/Operating Units (OUs) without complete set of books shall record their collections of income chronologically in the Cash Receipts Register (CRReg) (Appendix 27). The certified copy of the CRReg together with the required supporting documents, duplicate copies of ORs and Deposit Slip (DSs) shall be submitted within five (5) days after the end of each month to the concerned mother unit (central/regional/division office) by the FOs (a unit under the central/regional/ division office) for review and recording of the transactions in the CRJ by the Chief Accountant.



	4)		Detailed procedures for collections and deposits through the CO under Section 40, Chapter 5 of the GAM requires the issuance of OR to acknowledge receipt of cash/check by the CO/Cashier and the recording thereof to the CRRec.

	

	5)		On the other hand, the procedures for collections through Authorized Government Depository Bank (AGDB) requires the recording of collections by the Bookkeeper thru Journal Entry Voucher (JEV) based on the Consolidated Report of Daily Collections (CRDC) from AAB/AGDB.

	

	6)		One of the key functions of the OMB is the processing of Ombudsman Clearance for all government employees.  The OMB collects P150.00 for each clearance issued and P20 for every certified copy.  This can be availed of thru different payment facilities namely, Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) Linkbiz; Postal Money Order (PMO); Cash; and Payment via Shoe Mart (SM) before the contract was terminated in August 2020.

	

	7)		Regardless of payment modalities, all clearance applications and the corresponding payment documents will undergo the scrutiny of the Clearance Section, Public Assistance Bureau before these are submitted to the CO/Cashier for the issuance of OR,  as shown in the diagram below.  

	

Figure 1. Collection Flow for Clearance Fees



----media/image2.png----



	8)		As may be gleaned in the diagram, the present set up of taking up collections is a lot cumbersome and go against the intent of the procedures under the GAM. The collection flow entails additional processes in the issuance of OR and deposits thereof; resulting in further delay in recording in the books and non-reconciliation of account balances, as discussed in detail below.

	

Delays in the issuance of Official Receipts for collections from clearance fee



	9)		The GAM specifically requires the issuance of OR as acknowledgement for the payment made (Section 4(e), Chapter 2) and the reporting of collections thru the RCD.   These procedures are not observed in the present collection flow.  We compiled the ORs issued in CY 2020 as presented in Table No. 3 to illustrate this concern.

	10)		It has to be noted that the contract with SM Inc. was already terminated in August 2020 but the issuance of ORs for payment extended up to December 2020 depicting delays of up to four months.

	

	11)		Similarly, capturing payment of Postal Money Order (PMO) and issuance of OR corresponding thereto were delayed as disclosed by 187 cases of checks totaling P35,510.00 that went stale because these exceeded the 90-day validity period for encashment.  These were requested for replacement as shown in Table No. 4.

P35,510.00

	

	12)		The 187 PMO checks totaling P35,510.00 were not issued with OR and deposited within the said 90-day timeframe because of the delay in sorting and transmitting these checks from the Clearance Section to the CO/Cashier apparently due to the alternated working arrangement of personnel, which had not taken into account the number of clearance applicants during the period of community quarantine (CQ).

	

	13)		It is worth noting that the number of issued ORs prior to lockdown/CQ has an average of 121 daily and went down to 80 per day from June to December 2020.  This means, ORs issued during CQ declined by 34 percent suggesting that delays could be avoided if appropriate steps and strategies were taken towards personnel deployment. 

	

	14)		Occurrences of PMO stale checks needing replacements entailed unnecessary costs for administrative processes derailing employees’ efficiency and productivity. Ultimately, delays in issuing OR would mean delays in issuing OMB Clearance for the applicants who are expecting their retirement pay on time.  This would tarnish the OMB’s reputation if not corrected in due time.



Non-preparation of Cash Receipts Record (CRRec) 



	15)		The CRRec (Appendix 29, GAM Volume II a tool for tracking cash receipts, deposits made and the undeposited collections.  This form shall be prepared by every CO/Accountable Officer and shall maintain this record to monitor his/her accountability. All transactions for the day shall be recorded immediately and a balance (Undeposited Collection) shall be extracted.

	

	16)		We observed that the COs do not maintain the CRRec; thus, collections of cash,  PMO checks and those from SM payment facility were recorded using the RCD only instead of the tracking undeposited collections using the CRRec.

	

	17)		As a consequence, the benefit of monitoring undeposited collections was ignored which resulted in difficulty on the part of the Cashier to account and fully determine those collections that have been issued with OR and those that were not.  This gave rise to the 291 cases of cancelled ORs as can be gleaned from Table No. 5, equivalent to P43,650.00.

	18)		The Cashier explained that they had a hard time coping with the limited manpower and the backlog caused by the lockdown and CQ brought by COVID-19 as they heavily relied also on the lists and instructions of the PAB Clearance Section. 

	

	19)		The Cashier further pointed out that cancellation of 291 pieces of ORs equivalent to 2 percent of the total issued during the year was the result of some list from Clearance Section re-submitted and apparently issued with ORs doubly.

	

	20)		Escalation of these errors noted in months of June, September and October resulted in more delays instead of fast-tracking issuance of OR for the backlogs.

	

	21)		This scenario could have been easily mitigated if the Cashier put emphasis on preparing CRRec as it has a built-in check to determine those already issued with ORs and the corresponding deposits made, thru dates and references.  This built-in check could not be achieved using the RCD only.  Paid applicants issued with OR could also be detected by putting stamp as “received” the lists forwarded by the Clearance Section, and stamp as “recorded” after these were recorded in the CRReg for a more effective control.  

	

Delays in submitting Report of Collections and Deposits (RCD) 



	22)		The RCD that shall be prepared by CO bear the lists of all the ORs issued in numerical sequence including cancelled ones, is required for submission to Accounting Office.  The Head of Cash/Treasury Unit reviews and signs the RCD before submission to the Accounting Office/Unit.

	

	23)		The RCD provides information and details needed by the Accounting Office to record, compare and reconcile collections made by the agency and deposits made for the account of the agency thru reconciliation.  

	

	24)		To be of optimum value, the RCD should be submitted to the COA Audit Team by the Accounting Unit immediately so that audit could commence and pinpoint errors for Management’s corrective action.

	

	25)		We observed however that as of this writing, the latest RCD submitted to the Audit Team was as of March 31, 2020 or almost a year late. We are also informed of the late submission of RCDs by the Cashier to the Accounting Office hence, contributed to delays in reconciling collections and deposits and consequently resulted in delay in preparing financial statements.

	

Non-submission and Delays in submitting Report of Accountability for Accountable Forms (RAAF)



	26)		 Section 17(k), Chapter 8, GAM Volume 1, requires that RAAF (Appendix 67) shall be prepared by the Accountable Officer to report on the movement and status of accountable forms in his/her possession. The accountable forms include those with or without face value. 

	

	27)		For OMB’s Financial and Management Information Office (FMIO), the RAAF provides a control mechanism to check and reconcile accountability of COs against the issued ORs as of a given period. In the same vein, RAAF provides greater control on the issuance of OMB Clearance when compared to collection of clearance fees since OMB collects P150.00 for every clearance issued.  Non-/delayed preparation would therefore compromise the check and balance in the OMB’s collection cycle.

	

	28)		In CY 2020, we noted that the RAAF submitted to the Audit Team were  from January to August 2020 only; the RAAF for September to December were not submitted until now.



	29)		As a result, the CO/Cashier was not able to render a full accounting and reconciliation of her accountability in due time and thus precluded up-to-date recording in the books, and consequently delayed the preparation of financial reports. 

	

	30)		On the other hand, there was no accounting and reconciliation between OMB clearance issued and clearance fees collected. The RAAF could have been used by the Management in ensuring that all clearances issued were actually paid.  It can be used as well in the forecast as to the number of future applicants so that necessary adjustment of work schedule and personnel complement could be anticipated while promoting sense of accountability in the process.

	

	31)		The delays in the issuance of ORs for collections from clearance fee; non-preparation of Cash Receipts Record (CRRec); delays in submitting (RCD); and the non-submission and delays in submitting RAAF hindered a full accounting and reconciliation of collections amounting to P814,747.00 as at December 31, 2020. 

	

	32)		Ultimately, delayed/non-submission of the aforesaid reports to COA precluded the Auditors to conduct complete examination and verification of collections and deposits which could help Management detect errors and recommend corrections thereof.



	33)		We recommended that Management require: 



	The Chief of the Clearance Section to:

	

a)	Transmit the PMO check without delay to the Cashier upon receipt;



b)	Prepare RAAF corresponding to the receipt and issuances of clearance form, and the Cashier to submit said report on time; 



The Cashier to:



c)	Issue Official Receipt for all collections immediately upon receipt;



d)	Prepare and maintain the CRR (Appendix 29, GAM) to track down undeposited collections on a timely basis;



e)	Prepare and submit the RCD (Appendix 26, GAM) to ensure reconciliation and timely recording; and 



f)	Direct the Cashier and the Accountant to collaborate to render a full accounting of collections and deposits for CY 2020. 





Non-recording of expenses due to non-submission of CBReg and CDReg

	

1)		The OMB-MOLEO, OSP, OMB-Visayas and OMB-Mindanao were not able to submit the Cash-in-Bank Register (CBReg) and Cash Disbursement Register (CDReg) pursuant to existing COA rules and regulations resulting in non-recording of liquidations in Cash Advances for Operating Expenses account of P796,657.65 and the related expenses accounts as at December 31, 2020. 



	1)		Chapter 6 of GAM Volume 1, applies to the disbursement of funds and cash advances in the operating units without complete set of books and the reporting thereof:



Section 11. Recording of Check Disbursements by Field Offices without Complete Set of Books. Field Offices (FOs) without complete set of books shall record chronologically in the Cash in Bank Register (CBReg) (Appendix 37) all checks issued/charged to deposit with the AGDB. The certified copy of the CBReg together with the required SDs shall be submitted within five days after the end of each month to the concerned mother unit (central/regional/division office) by the FOs (a unit under the central/regional/ division office) for review and recording of the transactions in the books of accounts.



Section 12, Step 19, Note 7. For field offices without complete set of books, the CBReg shall be maintained. 

Section. 14. Disbursements by Cash. Cash disbursements constitute payments out of cash advances granted to the regular and special disbursing officers for personal services, petty expenses and MOOE for field operating requirements. All cash payments shall be covered by duly approved DVs/payrolls/petty cash vouchers (PCVs). The cash advances may be granted to the cashiers/disbursing officers/officials and employees to cover the following: salaries and wages, travels, special time-bound undertakings and petty operating expenses. 



Section 22. Accounting Books, Records, Forms and Reports to be Prepared and Maintained. A Cash Disbursements Register (CDReg) (Appendix 43) shall be maintained to record, monitor and report transactions involving the grant, utilization and liquidation of the cash advance. The Disbursing Officer shall submit within five days after month-end the certified copies of the CDReg with supporting paid DVs and other documents to the accounting units of their respective Central/Regional/Division Offices and Operating Units for JEV preparation or whenever a request for replenishment is made.



	2)		COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 also prescribes the liquidation of Cash Advances for Field Operating Expenses within 20 calendar days after the end of the year subject to replenishment as frequently as necessary during the year.

	

	3)		The aforesaid COA rules on disbursement of fund/cash advances by the operating units without complete set of books were re-echoed by the Honorable Ombudsman under Office Circular No. 1 dated January 7, 2020.

	

	1)		 In CY 2020 the OMB Central Office transferred funds totaling P1,911,410.31 (Table No. 6), and out of this amount, 51 percent or P991,512.33 (Table No. 6) were disbursed by the Area/Sectoral Offices as at December 31, 2020, as presented below:

	3)		As deduced in Table No. 7, it was only the OMB-Luzon that submitted the liquidation reports to the OMB-CO Accounting Office, thus, their disbursements during the year were appropriately recorded in the books.  The rest of OMB Area/Sectoral Offices such as OMB-MOLEO, OSP, OMB-Visayas and OMB-Mindanao did not submit any of their liquidation for expenses incurred throughout the year.  

	

	4)		While the new cash advance scheme at the Area/Sectoral Offices is new, appropriate guidelines was issued by the Ombudsman in its Office Circular 1, viz:



“9.  The disbursing officers (cashiers) shall maintain a Cash in Bank Register (CBReg) to chronologically record all check deposits and payments made within the month.  A certified copy of the CBReg shall be submitted to the Accounting Division in the Central Office within five (5) days of the ensuing month or whenever replenishment is needed together with the duly approved Disbursement Vouchers and supporting documents pursuant to COA Circular No. 2012-001.”



	5)		The Audit Team revisited the financial process at the Area/Sectoral Offices before the OMB Centralization wherein we observed that the financial cycle starting from the receipt of funds from the OMB-Central Office, disbursements and reporting entails a lot of steps and reportorial requirements as depicted in the illustration below: 



----media/image3.png----

	6)		The adoption of the cash advance system resulted in more streamlined financial process at the Area/Sectoral Offices resulting in elimination of unnecessary layers of documentation and financial reporting.  The centralization necessitates only two reports from the Area/Sectoral Offices, such as (1) Cash in Bank Register (CBReg) and (2) Cash Disbursement Register (CDReg) to capture their expense transactions, as illustrated below.  



----media/image4.png----

	7)		It is emphasized that the disbursements for the monthly operating and recurring expenses at the Area/Sectoral Offices should have been the same such that:



i)	For Check Disbursements – this done through issuance of check chargeable from LBP LCCA account maintained for each Area/Sectoral Office; and



ii)	For Cash Disbursements – from the CA of the designated Disbursing Officer/Cashier wherein the CA is drawn from the LBP LCCA account maintained for each Area/Sectoral Office. 

 

	8)		Ironically, the more simplified financial process created so much stir and confusion at the Area/Sectoral Offices, as we observed different procedures such as follows:



	a)	The OMB Visayas has drawn as cash advance to the Cashier the full amount of P350,000.00 transferred by the Central Office, such that all their disbursements were made thru cash payments;



	b)	The OMB Mindanao has drawn as cash advance to the Cashier the full amount of P350,000.00 in a staggered basis, and also their disbursements were made thru cash payments;



	c)	Aside from paying disbursements thru check out of the Cash in Bank Local Currency Current Account (LCCA), the OMB-Luzon, MOLEO and OSP had established their respective Petty Cash Fund out of the transferred fund to cater petty expenses (P15,000.00 and below), however, we noted that some petty expenses ranging from P1,200 to P4,000, P3,200 to P24,450.00, and P2,272 to P8,954, respectively, were paid by check;



	d)	The CBReg and CDReg were not submitted by OMB-MOLEO, OSP, Visayas and Mindanao to OMB FMIO that should have been used to capture and record the expenses incurred by these Offices. Only the OMB Luzon had submitted these reports; and 



	e)	Various inquiries from the operating units were also received by the Audit Teams as regards the processing of payment and the appropriate signatories on the Disbursement Vouchers, contemplating on the transfer of their accountants to the OMB-CO.

 

	9)		The unfamiliarity with the new cash advance system and the varied interpretation of the rules and/or lack of emphasis thereto mainly influenced the non-submission of the required CBReg and CDReg that resulted in non-recording of the expenses totaling P796,657.65 (Table No. 7) incurred by the operating units. This resulted also in overstatement of the Cash Advances for Operating Expense account as at year-end.



	10)		The centralization and the simplification of the financial processes that significantly reduced reportorial requirements at the Area/Sectoral Offices would help enhance OMB’s productivity if fully and completely embraced by ensuing faithful compliance with the procedures and reporting requirements.

	

	11)		We recommended that OMB Management thru the Financial and Management Information Office (FMIO) to:



a)	Require the Area/Sectoral Offices to submit to FMIO/Accounting the Cash in Bank Register (Appendix 37), required under Section 11 to 12 and Cash Disbursement Register (Appendix 43) under Section 14 and 22, both in Chapter 6 of GAM, five days after the end of each month with or without disbursements made therefrom;



b)	Require the OMB-MOLEO, OSP, OMB-Visayas and OMB-Mindanao to submit immediately the CBReg and CDReg for CY2020 to the CO Accountant;



c)	Require the Accountant to record/adjust the books immediately every time CBReg and CDReg are received; and



d)	Reiterate a clearer step by step procedures of “cash advance system” to the designated Cashier/Disbursing Officer/Accountant of the Area/ Sectoral Offices, incorporating, among others, the following:

	12)		Management in its letter-reply dated March 18, 2021, stated that they already issued Office Circular No. 5 dated January 11, 2021 or the Budget Guidelines for the Release of Funds for FY 2021 where the cash advance system for special operating budget releases to OMB-Luzon, OMB-MOLEO and OSP was discontinued. Moreover, the Office has required the immediate liquidation and refund of unutilized balance of cash advances granted to the concerned offices; and

	

	13)		Management also informed that with regard to the OMB- Visayas and OMB-Mindanao, Management has required the designated cashiers/ disbursing officers prompt submission to the FMIO/ Accounting Division of the CBReg and CDReg five days after the end of each month, with or without transactions duly received by their respective COA Resident Auditor. Along with this, Accountants are instructed to be proactive of all transactions in the eNGAS based on the CDReg submitted.





	Deficiencies on Internal Control over Property Plant and Equipment (PPE)

	

1)		Ineffective control over PPE such as: (a) the absence of physical inventory taking exercise, Report of Physical Count of PPE and updated property cards for the last five years; and (b) the inability to reconcile huge variance between property and accounting records, posed risk of property losses/misuse, affected operational efficiency, and precluded the auditor to verify accuracy, existence and condition of the PPE account balances presented in the financial statements.

	

	1)		Section 42, Chapter 10, GAM Volume I prescribes the Accounting and Property Records to be maintained for PPE. The Chief Accountant shall maintain the Property, Plant and Equipment Ledger Card (PPELC) for each category of PPE including work and other animals, livestock etc. The PPELC shall be kept to record promptly the acquisition, description, custody, estimated useful life, depreciation, impairment loss, disposal and other information about the asset. For check and balance, the Property and Supply Office/Unit shall likewise maintain Property Card (PC) for PPE in their custody to account for the receipt and disposition of the same. The balance per PC shall be reconciled with PPELC maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit. They shall also be reconciled with other property records like Property Acknowledgement Receipt (PAR).

	

	2)		The following are the forms/reports necessary to account for PPE, among others:



“xx

a)	Property Card (Appendix 70) – this card shall be used by the Supply and/or Property Division/Unit to record the description, acquisition, transfer, disposal, and other information about the PPE. It shall be kept for each class of PPE.



b)	Property, Plant and Equipment Ledger Card (Appendix 71) – this card shall be used for each class of PPE to record the acquisition, description, custody, estimated life, depreciation, impairment, disposal, transfer/adjustment, repair history and other information about the property. It shall be kept and maintained by the Accounting Office/Unit.



c)	Property Acknowledgement Receipt (Appendix 72) –This form shall be used by the Supply and/or Property Division/Unit to report the issuance of PPE and the acknowledgement of the end-user.



d)	Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (Appendix 73) – this form shall be used to report the physical count and condition of PPE by type as at a given date, including those which are unrecorded and those which could not be accounted for. It shows the balance of PPE per property cards and per count and the shortage/overage, if any. It shall be rendered by the Inventory Committee, on its yearly physical count of properties owned by the entity.



xx”



Absence of physical inventory and failure to render RPCPPE and update Property Cards



	3)		The physical count/inventory is an indispensable procedure for checking the integrity of property custodianship which shall be done annually and presented on the RPCPPE as at December 31 of each year.  This shall be submitted to the Auditor concerned not later than January 31 of the following year.  Equipment found at station and losses discovered during the physical count shall be reported to the Accounting Division for proper accounting/reporting.

	

	4)		In essence, the RPCPPE is a powerful tool for effective tracking and monitoring of property and equipment received during the year, missing, damaged as well as unserviceable equipment that needs repair/replacement or disposal. It provides basis for updating accounting records and a source of information for management decision making process, such as in the forecasting of acquisition and distribution, if prepared, reported on and communicated timely.

	

	5)		We noted however that the benefits of the RPCPPE as tracking and monitoring tool is not given much emphasis at OMB Central Office (OMB-CO) as the PMS did not  conduct physical verification or inventory taking for the last five years as can be gleaned from prior years’ audit observations.

				Exclusion of the unserviceable PPE awaiting disposal from the RPCPPE while still recorded in the PPELC 

				





	6)		Without the RPCPPE and the updated property cards or records that could easily track the whereabouts and status of the OMB’s PPE, there is no way for the OMB Management to trace missing or misused properties.

		 

	7)		A robust PPE tracking and monitoring including acquisition and deployment if conscientiously observed would redound to OMB’s operational efficiency; enhance the sense of accountability; and provide a clear view and accuracy of agency’s assets presented in the financial statements. 

	

	8)		 To illustrate this concern, we noted 262 sets of desktop computers and the 262 units of uninterruptible power supply (UPS) procured by the OMB Central Office in September 2019 and delivered in the same year and remained undeployed or unissued, as of March 2021, or already more than a year after these were acquired.

	

	9)		These desktop computers and UPS could have been used as early as 2019 and could significantly help the agency to propel employees’ performance and productivity as these could have been issued to 262 employees representing 25 percent of the total OMB’s workforce.

	

	10)		Apparently, the OMB Management has differing views on how these computer units will be distributed to end-users as there is no definite basis for issuance.  We were informed that they already have the distribution list but when we checked, the handwritten list has no information where it came from, not even the personnel who prepared and approved the list. 

	

	11)		We were further informed that issuance of such computers would take a while as they will check further who among from the OMBs employees needed them. 



	12)		This dilemma could have been avoided if the PMS conducted physical count and made updates on the PPE records as the prescribed RPCPPE has the following attributes and information:



--	location or the end-user of the property;

	13)		In due time,  the OMB is also confronted with losing dealer’s warranty and technological obsolescence, without even issuing and using such information technology equipment.

	

Inability to reconcile huge variance between property and accounting records



	14)		The RPCPPE and property cards are the primary basis of information to start PPE accounts reconciliation procedure.  Without these reports, there is  no way for the Accountant to verify whether PPE recorded in the books still exist at the end of the accounting period.  In the same manner, these reports are the bases in recording impairments and safeguard accuracy of PPE account balances being presented in the books.

	

	15)		We observed that no PPE accounts reconciliation was made in the last five years as manifested in huge variances between accounting and property records as summarized in Table No. 9.

	16)		While the intermittent work schedules brought about by the pandemic hindered the conduct of physical inventory taking, updating of property cards, as well as the reconciliation of such reports with that of the accounting records, non-performance of such activities were traced even in previous years and were not given emphasis by the OMB Property Management Section for a long period of time. 

	

	17)		It can be recalled that in 2018, the Accounting Division (AD) had exerted efforts to verify and analyze the reported unreconciled difference in the CY 2017 CAAR.  A Reconciliation Report on the results/ observations noted was submitted by the AD to this office and we noted that they were able to pinpoint the PPE that were recorded in the RPCPPE but not recorded in the books and conversely, recorded in the books but not in the RPCPPE. To reconcile, the AD requested a report of the actions taken and/or reconciliation undertaken by the PMS vis-à-vis the results of reconciliation in the books made by the AD. However, no reply/report/comment/compliance was submitted by the PMS.

	

	18)		The inaction or inefficiencies on the part of the PMS is putting the OMB in a bad light being the advocate and prime-mover of organizational efficiency among government agencies.

	

	19)		Ultimately, in view of the absence of RPCPPE and non-updating of property cards, precluded the Audit Team to pursue audit procedure to verify accuracy and reliability of PPE account balances presented in the financial statements.



	20)		We acknowledge the Ombudsman’s effort to pivot organizational restructuring that would address the dilemma including the shortage of personnel assigned at the PMS. However, a conscientious effort on the part of the Management to immediately address this gap is necessary to put its pervasive impact in agency’s financial reporting and operation to rest. 

	

	

	21)		We recommended that Management:



	a)	Pursue the creation of ad-hoc inventory committee thru Office Order that would take necessary steps to initiate and administer the conduct of physical inventory exercise including the preparation of the RPCPPE;



	b)	Instruct the Property Officer to observe regular updating of Property Cards and include the same in their individual/division performance commitment and review form; 



	c)	Direct both the Accountant and Property Officer to reconcile their records on a regular basis as prescribed under Sec. 42, Chapter 10 of the GAM Volume 1; and



	d)	Require the Property Officer and the Financial Management and Information Office to collaborate for the immediate deployment of information technology equipment to employees who need the same. 





Non-disposal of Unserviceable Properties at OMB-Visayas

	

2)		Unserviceable properties amounting to P3.027 million at OMB-Visayas were not disposed of contrary to existing laws, rules and regulations thus, exposing them to further deterioration.  

 

	1)		Section 79 of  PD 445 provides that: 

 

“Section 79. Destruction or sale of unserviceable property.  When government property has become unserviceable for any cause, or is no longer needed, it shall, upon application of the officer accountable therefore, be inspected by the head of the agency or his duly authorized representative in the presence of the auditor concerned and, if found to be valueless or unsalable, it may be destroyed in their presence.  If found to be valuable,  it may be sold at public auction  to the highest bidder under the supervision of the proper committee on award or similar body in the presence of the auditor concerned or other duly authorized representative of the Commission, after advertising  by printed notice in the Official Gazette, or for not less than three consecutive days in any newspaper of general circulation, or where the value of the property does not warrant the expense of publication, by notices posted  for a like period in at  least three public places in the locality where the property is to be sold.  In the event that the public auction fails, the property may be sold at a private sale at such price as may be fixed by the same committee or body concerned and approved by the Commission.” 

 

	2)		Review of the RPCPPE as of December 31, 2020 disclosed that several unserviceable properties remain undisposed despite having been unserviceable for a number of years already. Summary of which are as follows:

	3)		Management’s inaction to dispose of the unserviceable properties exposed the same to further deterioration resulting in the reduction of recoverable value and thus, depriving the agency of income that can be generated from such disposal. 

	

	4)		We recommended that Management of OMB-Visayas instruct the Supply Officer to prepare the Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Properties (IIRUP) for all the unserviceable properties as at December 31, 2020 and undertake the necessary steps for disposal as provided for in Section 79 of PD 1445. 

	

	5)		Management at the moment is still on its transition to the implementation of the centralization policy coupled with the challenges brought about by the pandemic since 2020. Thus, the disposal of unserviceable properties was put on hold. Management appreciates the reminder and noted the observation given and will undertake the necessary process to accomplish the observation.  







	OTHER COMPLIANCE ISSUES

	

	Gender and Development

	

3)	The OMB was not able perform gender analysis using the Harmonized Gender and Development Guidelines (HGDG) to aid gender mainstreaming activities to ensure compliance with the 5% GAD budget required under the General Appropriations Act (GAA) of FY2020.  Moreover, it incurred total expenditures of P6.619 million for GAD related activities and attribution, equivalent to only 16 percent of the total GAD Plan and Budget of P41.615 million for CY 2020 due to cancellation of programmed activities affected by community quarantine and strict health protocol caused by COVID-19 pandemic, thus, the objective to promote women empowerment and gender equality was not fully realized.  



	1)	In accordance with Section 36(a) of Republic Act No. 9710 or the “Magna Carta of Women” (MCW), and the guidelines set under PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular (JC) 2012-01 and PCW Memorandum Circular 2019-02, national government agencies and instrumentalities have prepared and are implementing their FY 2020 Gender and Development (GAD) Plans and Budgets (GPBs). The cost of which shall be at least five percent (5%) of the agency’s total budget appropriations.



	2)	Section 3.4 of the same JC states that: mainstreaming gender perspectives in agency Programs, Activities and Projects (PAPs) to attain the desired outcomes for GAD shall be a priority in GAD planning and budgeting. Using the 5% GAD budget for gender mainstreaming is a way for agencies to influence the entire agency program, plan and budget. To aid gender mainstreaming, agencies shall perform gender analysis using existing tools, such as the HGDG, to ensure that the different concerns of women and men are addressed equally and equitably in their PAPs. Activities to address these differential concerns through capacity development on GAD or GAD-focused activities shall be included in agency GPBs.



	3)	Section 5.0 of the same JC further provides among others the steps in formulating GAD Plan, which include:



“5.1 Set the GAD agenda or identify priority gender-issues and/or specific GAD mandates and targets to be addressed over a one-year or three-year term by the central office in consultation with regional offices, bureaus and attached agencies. This GAD agenda shall be the basis for the annual formulation of PAPs to be included in the GPB of the department and its attached agencies, bureaus, regional offices and units.



5.2 Identify appropriate PAPs to address priority gender issues that are included in the GPB. PAPs may be client-focused or those addressing gender mainstreaming in major programs and other GAD-focused activities for agency clients. It may also be organization-focused or those addressing identified gender issues of the agency and its personnel.



 5.3 Agencies are encouraged to assess the gender-responsiveness of their major programs and projects using the HGDG tool. The result of assessment will guide them in identifying areas for improvement. (Emphasis Supplied)



x x x” 



	4)	Sections 6.0 of the same PCW, NEDA and DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-11 also discussed the Costing and Allocation of the GAD budget, particularly Sections 6.3 and 6.4 which states among others  that:



		“ x x x



6.4.1 If an agency intends to attribute a portion or the whole budget of major programs during the GAD planning and budgeting phase, it may subject the program to gender analysis using the HGDG tool. If the agency is not yet trained on the use of the tool, it may include said training in its GPB and may seek the assistance of an expert on gender analysis using the HGDG.



6.4.2 The use of the HGDG will yield a maximum score of 20 points for each program or project. Depending on the score on the HGDG, a percentage of the budget of the agency’s existing and proposed major program may be attributed to the GAD budget as follows:



Table No. 11. - HGDG Table

6.4.3 After arriving at the score, the agency will now set a target score in the HGDG.



6.4.4 During the preparation of its GAD AR, the agency will again administer the HGDG test to determine the extent that the targeted HGDG score is attained. This score will be the basis in determining actual expenditure that can be attributed to the GAD budget.

	5)	Due to the uncertain/unexpected situation brought by the COVID-19 pandemic, additional guideline was issued and embodied in PCW Memorandum Circular No. 2020-03 dated April 27, 2020 providing guidance on the review, revision and/or implementation of the FY 2020 GPB to implement measures to address gender issues and concerns arising from the unequal status of their women and men stakeholders due to the COVID-19 situation. Such measures should be in line with their respective agency mandates, Republic Act No. 9710 or the Magna Carta of Women and the Bayanihan to Heal As One Act. 



	6)	In addition, Section 4.6 of the said Memorandum Circular provides that to ensure the gender-responsiveness of PAPs and comply with the minimum 5% GAD budget provision, agencies, especially those that are mandated to implement specific programs/projects under the Bayanihan to Heal As One Act and related directives, are highly encouraged to use the HGDG tool. 



	7)	The FY 2020 GAA showed total appropriation of P4,046,726,000.00 for the Office of the Ombudsman and we noted total approved GAD Plan and Budget of P41,615,104.16 equivalent to only 1.08 percent of the total agency budget.



	8)	We further noted that, the OMB has lined up 13 activities to address organization and client-focused GAD related issues and instill GAD awareness among its employees together with four attribution of agency program in its GPB, all totaling P41,615,104.16. The GAD activities as well as the corresponding approved budget allocation and the actual expenditures incurred were presented in Table No.12.

	9)	In can be recalled however that the country had observed lockdowns and community quarantine that affected the achievement of the programmed activities, hence, OMB only incurred actual total expenditures of P6,619,929.89 attributed to GAD equivalent to 15.91 percent of the GPB.  



	10)	We noticed that the OMB has a well-established GAD Focal Point System (GFPS) wherein it has the main oversight body – the GFPS Executive Committee, otherwise known as the OMB GADvocates, and it has its Technical Working Groups (TWGs) for the various area/sector offices.



	11)	While we anticipated slow down or even stoppage of GAD planned activities, the GFPS TWG could have used the HGDG Tool to boost compliance with the required 5 percent of the OMB Budget by integrating GAD awareness and gender responsiveness in the following OMB programs: 



--	Public Assistance

--	Prevention

--	Education and Anti-Corruption Promotion

--	Integrity Management Program

--	Partnership Through Accreditation

--	The March to Righteousness

--	Conference on Corruption and Development

--	Integrity Caravan

	

	12)	Some of the OMB expenses that can be charged to GAD budget and can also be included in the accomplishment report, includes:



--	Salaries of agency personnel assigned to plan, implement and monitor GAD PAPs on a full-time basis, following government rules in hiring and creating positions;



--	Agencies may cost the time spent by GFPS members and of agency personnel doing GAD related work (e.g. supplies and materials issued to auditors doing audit of GAD funds) and charge this to the GAD budget; 



--	Overtime work rendered in doing GAD related PAPs may be compensated through a compensatory time off (CTO), following government accounting and auditing rules and regulations;



--	Consultations conducted by agencies to gather inputs for and/or to disseminate the GAD plan and budget;



--	International Electronic Commission (IEC) activities (development, printing and dissemination) that support the GAD PAPs and objectives of the agency. (e.g. cost of publication and maintenance of the OMB website that includes GAD related activities and GAD awareness)



	13)	Nevertheless, prior to the pandemic, we noted Management's effort thru its GPFS to integrate gender perspectives in its operation at the organizational and client level, but still has to deliberately address the gender issues by efficiently carrying out the process of planning, budgeting, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation including the use of HGDG Tool.   Integrating and mainstreaming of GAD into OMB’s operational practice and use of HGDG Tool will help address the gender issues or those which promote women empowerment and gender equality.



	14)	We recommended that Management require the GAD Focal Point System and GAD Secretariat to: 



	a)	Perform gender analysis using the HGDG Tool, to assess the gender-responsiveness of their major programs and projects and thus, will guide in identifying areas for improvement as prescribed under PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular 2012-01 and to aid in ensuring compliance with the 5% GAD budget required under the General Appropriations Act of FY2020; and



	b)	Identify GAD related activities and expenses that influence or those that promote women empowerment and gender equality which can be considered in the formulation of GPB and accomplishment report to boost OMB compliance with the 5% required GAD budget, guided by PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular (JC) 2012-01 and PCW Memorandum Circular No. 2020-03.



	15)	Management in its letter dated May 14, 2021 noted that the AOM identified “Activity No. 11:  Mainstreaming of gender-fair language in OMB action documents (policies, orientation of target audience, revision of legal style book, monitoring of the use of gender-fair language, and the like)” and attributed P2,206,491.73 as GAD expenditure and informed that it should be the GAD activity – “Mainstreaming GAD concept and issues to the training programs of the office for its employees” which incurred the said GAD expense and attribution as stated in the GAD accomplishment report for FY 2020 submitted to the PCW. 



Since the COVID-19 crisis started, all agency programs and activities were severely affected including the GAD initiatives mainstreamed with the organization’s core functions. The recommendations stated in the AOM are most welcome to the GFPS as it continues to study the effective application of the HGDG tool in attributing and assessing gender responsiveness in the various programs of the office. 



The GFPS will continue to prioritize programs and projects focusing on the Office’s mandate as embodied in the Public Accountability Blueprint agenda for 2019-2025 (WE PROTECT) and patterned after the mandate of Republic Act No. 9710, otherwise known as the Magna Carta of Women.  



Gender mainstreaming is a systematic approach that transforms an agency into a gender-responsive institution and involves the public policy concept of assessing the different implications for women and men of any planned policy action in all areas and levels including legislation and programs. Mainstreaming essentially offers a pluralistic approach that values the diversity among men and women.



In spite of the challenges brought about by the COVID-19 crisis, the GFPS will continue to exert all effort to effectively implement and mainstream gender and development programs into the Ombudsman’s core functions under the “new normal” setup.

		

	

Senior Citizens and Persons with Disability



4)	The OMB approved and implemented Programs/Projects for senior citizens and persons with disability (PWDs) both in the CO and in the ROs, in compliance with Section 32 of the General Provisions of the General Appropriations Act (GAA) for FY 2020.



	1)		Section 32 of the General Provision of the GAA of CY 2020 requires all agencies of the government to formulate plans, programs and projects intended to address the concerns of senior citizens and persons with disability (PWDs), insofar as it relates to their mandated functions, and integrate the same in their regular activities.



	2)		Moreover, all government infrastructures and facilities shall provide architectural or structural features, designs, or facilities that will reasonably enhance the mobility, safety and welfare of PWDs, pursuant to Batas Pambansa Blg. 344 and R.A. 7277. 

	

	3)		The OMB office buildings are provided with architectural facilities or structural features and designs like elevator, ramps, comfort rooms and sufficient benches that enhance the mobility, safety and welfare of senior citizens and PWDs.



	4)		We encouraged Management to continue complying with the provisions of Section 32 of the GAA that addresses the concerns of Senior Citizens and PWDs.

1)	 The inability to conduct physical inventory of Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) as part of the assurance activity to determine existence required under Section 38, Chapter 10, Volume 1 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), precluded the reconciliation of the huge variance of ₱351,777,452.20 between property and accounting records at the OMB-CO, while errors and deficiencies observed at OMB-MOLEO such as:  (a) unrecorded Furniture and Fixtures of ₱2,173,140.00 and Semi-Expendable Furniture and Fixtures of ₱195,150.00; (b) misclassification of some properties worth ₱83,186.00; (c) unresolved variance of ₱3,460,752.09 between the Accounting records and Report on the Physical Count of PPE (RPCPPE); and (d) discrepancies in property numbering and descriptions, affected the fair presentation of OMB’s PPE totaling ₱1,595,511,854.79 as at December 31, 2019. 



We recommended and Management agreed to direct:



a. the Property Management Section (PMS) to formulate a work plan catered for the conduct of regular physical inventory taking, including among others, the timing of the activities and the personnel or team necessary to implement the activities and update and complete PPE information based on the physical count; and



b. the PMS and Accounting Unit to reconcile their PPE records and include such activity in their Performance Commitment.









We further recommended and Management in OMB-MOLEO agreed to: 



a. require the Accountant to cause the adjustment of unrecorded PPE, unrecorded Inventory and misclassified PPE, and recognize as expense semi-expendable properties whenever issued using the ICS to the end-user; and



b. require the Property personnel to collaborate with Accounting by submitting regularly the documents for receipt and acceptance of properties and RPCPPE resulting from physical inventory taking to reconcile the ₱3,460,752.09 variance, to effect adjustments.



2019 CAAR

pp. 47-55





























































































The Inventory Committee was not able to conduct the physical inventory of the PPE due to the intermittent work schedule brought about by the pandemic/ lockdown. 



































All items have been adjusted in February 2020 thru journal entry vouchers (JEV)  as per recommendation of COA. Collaborative efforts are being made by the accounting and property sections to reconcile variances in the RPCPPE; adjustments are to be undertaken after the conduct of physical inventory of property, plant, and equipment.

Letter-reply to the Audit Query (AQ) revealed that in lieu of the conduct of physical inventory taking, continued use of Property Inventory Management System (PIMS) on the issuance of PAR and ICS was resorted to.



Moreover, due to the implementation of remote work environment where some IT equipment were brought home, issued PAR, approval of gate pass/corresponding authority from concerned officials are being monitored in the PIMS. 









Unrecorded Furniture and Fixtures amounting to ₱2,173,140.00 was adjusted per JEV-2020-02-000065 dated 02/29/20202. misclassified properties worth ₱83,186.00 was adjusted per JEV-2020-02-000062-63 dated 02/29/20203. Unreconciled items amounting to ₱3,460,752.09 variance between the Accounting records and the  RPCPPE is for further validation. OMB-MOLEO conducted its physical inventory on December 9-11, 2020, witnessed by the Audit Team. The Team awaits for the report of inventory taking.



2)	The parcel of land donated by the Provincial Government of Cebu for the construction of OMB-Visayas Annex Building is not recorded in the book of accounts as of year-end, contrary to Section 112 of Presidential Decree (PD)  No. 1445 and Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standards (PPSAS) 17 and 23, thus, understating the Land Account by an undetermined amount.



We recommended and Management of OMB-Visayas agreed to: (a) fast track the processing of the Certificate of Title of the donated lot to obtain absolute ownership thereof; and (b) conduct an appraisal of the donated lot for purposes of determining its fair value in order for the Accountant to record the asset in the book of accounts.

3)	Pre-signing of Official Receipts at OMB-MindanaoA total of 200 pcs unissued Official Receipts (AF 51) were pre-signed by the Cashier at OMB-Mindanao before issuance, thereby exposing unauthorized collection and posed possible risk of financial loss to the agency.



We recommended and Management of OMB-Mindanao agreed to:

a. instruct the Cashier to stop the practice of pre-signing the Official Receipts before its issuance to avoid unauthorized collection and to prevent incurrence of loss of government funds; andb. require the Cashier to ensure that internal control on cash management is in place and enforced to minimize the risk of fraud and financial loss.

Management reiterated and explained to the Cashier the importance of strong and sound internal control on the handling and maintenance of ORs to ensure unauthorized collection and prevent risk of fraud and financial loss.



4)	The legality, validity and propriety of payment made to PLD Construction for the four progress billings on the construction of Four-Storey Annex Building amounting to ₱48,392,478.81 could not be established due to insufficiency of document as required under Section 4 of Presidential Decree No. 1445 and COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012.



We recommended and Management agreed to:a. require the Procurement Officer to submit lacking documentary requirements such as: (a) Inspection Report by the Agency’s Authorized Engineer; (b) Statement of Time Elapsed; (c) Monthly Certificate of Payment; (d) Contractor’s Affidavit on payment of laborers and materials; and (e) Pictures, before, during and after  construction on every progress billing payment; andb. require the Accountant to ensure the completeness of the supporting documents in all disbursements pursuant to law and regulations.

We recommended and Management at OMB-Mindanao agreed to compel the Cashier to submit the disbursement vouchers together with all the supporting documents to the OIC-Accountant at the end of each month for submission to the Office of the Auditor within the first ten days of the ensuing month, otherwise, Section 22 of PD 1445 mentioned above will be imposed.

6)	The Office of the Ombudsman (OMB) needs to pursue vigorously the organizational restructuring to address: a)  the need for additional workforce for unresolved carry over cases and complaints; 



	We recommended and Management agreed to revisit HR strategy to incorporate Workforce requirement based on the current workload and forecast to improve on the resolution of pending and unresolved complaints and cases and lessen carry over backlogs.

b) the gaps in low and mid-level core positions; 

	We recommended and Management agreed to:

a. incorporate in its on-going reorganization the study of the ideal core workforce requirement that would address the gap noted in low to mid-level positions, thereby improving workforce position classification ratio; andb. formulate hiring policy, giving priority on employing and on-boarding of low and mid-level core positions to be utilized in doing most of the legwork to accelerate and catch up on the resolution of pending complaints and cases.   

c) the need for talent mapping to improve core workforce ratio; and 

We recommended and Management agreed to improve the ratio of the OMB’s core workforce by pursuing and implementing talent mapping process by: (i) Updating organizational design/ structure particularly on the core function to reflect what is the right Staffing Requirement to execute its current strategy and in the foreseeable future; (ii) updating personnel qualifications including the breadth of their experience; (iii) create a pool of talent from non-core personnel that can be matched to the roles that OMB needed; and (iv) identify from the pool those personnel that are “job-ready” and or “high performance” talent and communicate with them to initiate their transfer and on-boarding to core position.

d) the gaps in the organizational design and workforce imbalance.  



1) We recommended and Management agreed to: (a) assess and establish the right size of workforce needed for Financial and Administrative -functions; and (b) identify personnel suited for rechanneling to Internal Audit Service/ Unit and Procurement Unit, to obtain a more balanced workforce for Finance, Administrative, Internal Control Services and Procurement functions.

2) We recommended and Management agreed to:(a.) instruct concerned Offices and Bureaus to reestablish their function and/or job description and reassess their workforce needs; and, (b.) instruct the Human Resource Management Division to resolve organizational gaps and workforce imbalance by determining workforce component depending on the functional needs.

With the ongoing rationalization and retrofitting under Hon. Ombudsman Martires, through the newly created Committee on Reorganization, it is expected that the issues and observations noted will henceforth be fully addressed.



With the assumption of the Honorable Ombudsman Martires in August 2018, the structure was further revisited based on his thrusts and directives and Office Circular No. 18, s. 2019 or the Guidelines on the Retrofitting of the Functions and Structures of the Office of the Ombudsman, and Office Circular No. 10, s. 2020 on creation of a Committee on Reorganization were issued. Thus, in compliance with said directives, a new proposed reorganization has been submitted by the different offices/ clusters, including General Administrative Office (GAO) to the Ombudsman for his consideration, through the aforementioned Committee on Reorganization. Therein, as is the thrust of the Ombudsman, the centralization of administrative and auxiliary functions at least for component offices situated in Central Office  the need to create a Procurement and Supply Management Division (separate section for Procurement and for Supply) and the request for additional staff to man the proposed unit were proposed. 



Anent the perceived organizational gaps and workforce imbalance, the reorganization of Office under the administration of then Ombudsman Conchita Carpio Morales which was undertaken from 2012 to 2016 using the scrap-and-build policy/scheme and submitted to the DBM was not completed or realized in its entirety. While majority of the offices were indeed reorganized, the offices in CO, particularly the Office of the Legal Affairs, the PAMO, the PACPO, GAO and FMIO, as well as the creation of Internal Control Unit whose reorganization was submitted to DBM between December 2015 to July 2016, remained pending before DBM as of February 2018. Also, an offshoot of the said ongoing reorganization, during the same period, particularly the CO, had been selective in the filling-up of vacant positions, as number of vacant positions were subject to either abolition, collapse or transfer, following the scrap-and-build-scheme.

7)	Designation of Rank and File employees in Supervisory Positions at OMB-MindanaoTwo (2) rank and file employees were designated to supervisory positions and were occupying the same for more than two (2) years, contrary to Omnibus Rules on Appointments and Other Human Resource Actions (ORAOHRA). 



We recommended Management at OMB-Mindanao to:a. strictly observe that designations of employees in an acting capacity are to be renewed every year, in the exigency of the service, but not to exceed two (2) year limits; andb. open and fill-up the vacant positions in the agency’s Plantilla specifically in the Finance and Administrative Bureau and encourage the employees to apply and be promoted for the position.

We recommended and Management agreed to designate personnel separately in charge for certifying obligation, certifying legality of the transactions and completeness of supporting documents on the disbursement voucher and signing of checks for disbursements to ensure the check and balance and safeguarding of agency’s financial assets.

We recommended and Management agreed to:a. establish the OMB Procurement Unit in accordance with NBC No. 2015-558 dated June 4, 2015, to provide a more responsive structure on the pressing procurement needs in areas of planning, purchasing, contract management and monitoring to effectively delineate procurement function and ultimately resolve prevalent delays in executing procurement activities; and

The work restrictions brought about by the pandemic resulted in the   delay of  ongoing creation of the Procurement Unit.             



















The pandemic brought changes the way the BAC functions wherein virtual meetings/ conduct of bidding were done to achieve a consensus that paved way on the speedy process of deliberations concerning procurement of goods and services. 



With the noted decrease in the procurement volume in 2020, we validated that agreement with timelines were observed.









10)	Overarching responsibility of the Property Management Section (PMS)Appointment of the majority of PMS personnel as member/secretariat of the Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) created an overarching responsibility which resulted in: (a) incompatible functions; and (b) prevalent delays on submitting required copy of Purchase Order (PO), Delivery Receipt and Inspection and Acceptance Report to Commission on Audit (COA).



We recommended and Management agreed to:a. create Procurement Office/Unit in accordance with National Budget Circular No. 2015-558 dated June 4, 2015, in order to properly address incompatible functions and segregation of duties and responsibilities relative to procurement function and property management; and

b. instruct the PMS to submit copy of contracts/purchased orders within five days from perfection and copy of Purchase Order, Delivery Receipt and Inspection and Acceptance Report within 24 hours from receipt of items as required under COA existing rules and regulations.

Moreover, four out of the 16 GAD plans were not accomplished while the attributed amount of expenditure for the six activities exceeded the GPB allocation.

b. strengthen the allocation and costing in the preparation of GAD budget to reflect a more accurate estimate based on historical records for the desired outcomes and goals in the evaluation/ assessment of the attribution and mainstreaming of major programs in accordance with Sections 6.3 and 6.4 of the PCW, NEDA and DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-11; and

We recommended and Management agreed to require the PMS to have a complete record of the properties to support and reconcile its PPE records/reports with that of the Accounting Division.  



2018 CAAR pages 53-55







































The OMB-CO will pursue reconciliation through the PMS to comply with the recommendations.









































Not

Implemented























































Recommendation is reiterated in pages 23-29 of this report.



15)	At the OMB-Visayas, the rules and regulations on the granting and liquidation of cash advances for special purpose activities were not strictly implemented resulting in excess cash advances and incurrence of delays in liquidation.



We recommended and Management of OMB-Visayas agreed to direct the officials and employees concerned to adhere strictly with the laws, rules and regulations on the granting and liquidation of cash advances.

2018 CAAR page 68























The grant and liquidation of cash advances are strictly monitored. Also, the Cashier no longer waits for the end of the month before submitting the liquidation report and its supporting documents to the Accountant.

























Implemented

























Due to the centralization  of the financial operation of the Area/Sectoral Offices, the granting of cash advance for special purpose activities is now undertaken by OMB Central Office. Hence, recommendation is considered implemented.

16)	The BAC failed to prepare the Procurement Monitoring report (PMR) and to submit the same to the GPPB, as required in Section 12.2 of the revised Implementing Rules and Regulation of RA No. 9184, thus public monitoring of the procurement process/activities and evaluation on whether all contracts were awarded pursuant to the said provisions of RA No. 9184 cannot be made.



We recommended and Management of the OMB-Visayas agreed to require the BAC to prepare and submit to the GPPB the PMR within the time frame as stipulated in Section 12.2 of the Revised IRR of RA No. 9184 so that monitoring and evaluation of the agency’s compliance to the provisions of the Procurement Reform Act can be made.



2018 CAAR page 79





































Closely monitor the preparation and submission of PMR to GPPB within the time frame. The PMR as of June 30, 2019 of the OMB-Visayas (Cebu) was forwarded to the GPPB on July 12, 2019.





































Implemented







































Due to the centralization of the procurement of the Area/Sectoral Offices, the submission of PMR is no longer applicable in OMB-Visayas. Hence, we considered this as closed/ implemented.



CY 2017



17)	The balances of Inventory accounts totaling ₱21,092,050.63 as of December 31, 2017 are unreliable due to unreconciled balances of ₱3,697,707.20 between the Accounting Division (AD) and Property Management Section (PMS) records and non-maintenance/non-reconciliation of Supplies Ledger Cards (SLCs) and Stock Cards (SCs) in the OMB Central Office, and the inclusion of issued semi-expendable items in the Inventory accounts totaling ₱5,588,565.82 in OMB-Visayas, which is not in keeping with Appendix 66 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume II and Section 10, Chapter 8, Vol. of the GAM. Likewise, only the Report on the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) for Office Supplies Inventory, among the five inventory accounts, was submitted by the OMB-CO to the Commission on Audit (COA), contrary to Section 17, Chapter 8 of the GAM, Volume I.



We recommended that Management in the OMB-CO to require the PMS and the AD to update and reconcile their inventory records and the PMS to maintain SCs of the 70 line items totaling ₱1,679,094.00 to comply with Appendix 66 of the GAM, Vol. II.









































2017 CAAR pages 39-42

















































































OMB CO



The General Service Division (GSD) is continuously reconciling the Inventory records with the GL.



The unreconciled balance

was adjusted by the Accounting Division under JEV Nos. 2018-01-001426 and 425 dated 1/3/18 and 1/4/18, respectively.



PMS was provided subsidiary ledgers and supply ledger cards on January 31, 2019 and corresponding adjustments were thereafter reflected in the Property Stock Card.





















































































Implemented



















































































JEV Nos. 2018-01-001426 and 425 dated 1/3/18 and 1/4/18, respectively were drawn to reflect correct accounts and reconciled balances.















18)	Payments to suppliers of procurements made through public bidding were delayed such that only eight (8) suppliers out of 22 were paid promptly or within 60 days from submission of sales invoices while 14 suppliers or 64 per cent experienced long delays of payment ranging from 66 days to 304 days or ten (10) months, which is not in keeping with the General Conditions of the Contract (GCC).  For alternative modes of procurement (AMP), payments were made from 21 days to 192 days or six (6) months, in the absence of internal policy to expedite payment of its obligations to suppliers, which might discourage suppliers from participating in the public bidding and other forms of procurement of the Office of the Ombudsman.



We recommended that Management:



a)	promptly pay the suppliers who have delivered goods and services or pay within 60 days after submission of Sales Invoices as required in the General Conditions of the Contract; and































	

2017 CAAR pages 68-70































































The GSD and AD will look into the issues that delayed the processing of payments to suppliers and institute remedial measures to ensure that payments be made within the prescribed due date set forth in the contract, purchase orders and job orders.



The management updated the delegation of authority on financial concerns specifically the signatories and alternates for a more effective and efficient way of expediting the processing payments.



The AD strictly monitors the accounts payable to creditors/suppliers. Moreover, GSD was reminded to process payments of delivered items and services rendered upon receipt of IAR per Routing Slip dated 3/8/19. 



The draft procedure on the payment to external clients with indicative timelines for each activity were discussed with the concerned personnel.

































































Implemented













































































































Verification of DVs in 2019 and early 2020 (before the pandemic) on procurement through public bidding showed that suppliers were paid within 60 days from the submission of sales invoice.
