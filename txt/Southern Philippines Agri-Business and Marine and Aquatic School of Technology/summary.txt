EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

 
 

 

A. INTRODUCTION 

 

 The Southern Philippines Agri-Business and Marine and Aquatic School of 

Technology (SPAMAST) is now on its 37th year of existence. Batas Pambansa Bilang 148 

dated February 8, 1982 converted Malita Municipal High School to Malita Agri-Business 

and Marine and Aquatic School of Technology (MAMAST) which was later renamed to 

SPAMAST by virtue of an amendment passed through Batas Pambansa Bilang 651 dated 

March 7, 1984. It has eleven members of the Board of Trustees as the policy determining 

body of the School and its day to day affairs are taken care of by the College President. 

 

            The SPAMAST is mandated to provide higher technological and vocational 

instructions and trainings in aquatic and marine science, agriculture, and industrial fields 

pursuant to the provisions of the School’s Charter Batas Pambansa Bilang 148. 
 
 

B.        AUDIT METHODOLOGY 
 

The Commission has been implementing risk-based audit in the conduct of its audit 

services. However, to meet the evolving development in public governance and fund 

management, the results-based approach in audit was incorporated. The integration of these 

two approaches, called the Integrated Results and Risk-Based Audit (IRRBA) 

Methodology, was applied in the audit of the accounts and operations of the SPAMAST. 
 
 

C.       SCOPE OF AUDIT 
 

The audit covered the review of accounts and operations of SPAMAST for CY 

2020.  The audit was aimed to ascertain the propriety of the disbursements, the adequacy 

of recording of the transactions in the books of accounts and the fairness and reliability of 

the financial reports. Transactions of the agencies were also examined to determine 

whether existing laws, rules and regulations were complied with. 
 
 

D.  FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS 
 

Sources and Applications of Funds 

 

In the implementation of programs, projects and activities, the SPAMAST 

depended largely on the subsidy from the National Government. The SPAMAST also 

derived its income from collection of tuition and other fees that were constituted as Special 

Trust Fund by virtue of RA 8292 as well as from its income generating projects; and from 



ii 

 

grants and donations received from other National Government Agencies intended for the 

implementation of special projects. 

 

The following is the summary of appropriations, allotments and obligations of 

SPAMAST for CY 2020 by virtue of RA 11465 or the FY 2020 GAA including 

appropriations per BOT Resolution No. 047, s. 2018 approving Program of Receipts and 

Expenditures (PRE) for CY 2020 with comparative figures from CY 2019.

 The decrease in assets and net assets/equity of SPAMAST as at December 31, 2020 

were attributable to the partial transfer of assets to the newly created Davao del Sur State 

College by virtue of the Republic Act 11220.  The increase in liabilities resulted from the 

increase in Inter –Agency Fund Transfers. 

 

 The decrease in revenue, current operating expenses and net financial 

assistance/subsidy attributed mainly from the separation of the extension classes located in 

Davao del Sur areas which is now the Davao del Sur State College. The significant decrease 

of the other non-operating income was due to the recognized losses in the condemnation 

of various structures giving way to the construction of new projects of the college.

E.  AUDITOR’S OPINION ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 

The Auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the 

financial statements of the SPAMAST for CY 2020 due to exceptions stated in the 

Independent Auditor’s Report and as discussed in details in Part II of this Report. 

 

 

F. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT AUDIT OBSERVATIONS AND  

RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

The following are the significant observations with the corresponding 

recommendations: 

 

1. Total assets amounting to P4,409,685.32 (net of accumulated depreciation of 
P3,450,019.57) were not turned over to the newly created Davao del Sur State 

College (DSSC) for want of further validation, inconsistent with Section 20 of 

RA No. 1120, thereby overstating/misstating the asset balances in the financial 

statements of SPAMAST as at yearend by the same amount.  
 

 We recommended that Management: 

 

a. Advise the Supply Officer to prepare the needed documents for the proper 
turnover of the latest validated assets in the total amount of P3,990,925.24 net 

of accumulated depreciation the soonest possible time to Davao del Sur State 

College; 

 

b. Coordinate/schedule with the DSSC management for further validation of the 
remaining assets to be turned over in the total amount of P418,760.08 net of 

accumulated depreciation; and 

 

c. Ensure a complete turnover of all assets, real and personal, personnel and 
records of the SPAMAST-Digos City Campus, the SPAMAST Laboratory and 

Production Campus in the Municipality of Matanao, the SPAMAST Extension 

Classes in Barangay Kapatagan, Digos City and the SPAMAST Extension 

Campus in the Municipality of Sulop as well as the liabilities and obligations 

as mentioned in the above provisions that includes the original titles and deed 

of donations of recorded lots. 

 

2. The receipt and issuance of delivered supplies and materials covered under 
Purchase Order No. 0573-20 amounting to P1,151,475.75 were not promptly 

recorded in the Stock Cards of the Property/Supply Officer due to lack of 

complete documentation contrary to the accounting for inventories under 

Chapter 8, of GAM Volume 1, thereby casting doubt on the integrity of 

property custodianship and exposing the assets to risk of loss or 

misappropriation. 

 



iv 

 

We recommended that Management: 

 

a. Require the Property/Supply Officer to submit a written explanation on the 
quantity variance summarized in the table above, update his records and 

reconcile it with the Accounting records, and submit the Report on the Physical 

Count of Inventories (RPCI) not later than January 31, 2021; 

 

b. Require the Property/Supply Officer to strictly and faithfully observe the proper 
procedures in accounting for the delivery, receipt, inspection, requisition, 

issuance, and recording of inventories in accordance with Chapter 8, Volume 1 

of the GAM as well as the storage or keeping of stocks in order to strengthen 

the very weak internal control on inventories; and 

 

c. Remind the Property/Supply Officer to be mindful of his duties and 
responsibilities under the law as an accountable officer for government property 

because it is the Management’s or Agency Head’s duty to exercise diligence in 

supervising accountable officers under him/her, otherwise, he/she shall be 

jointly and solidarily liable with the person primarily accountable therefor for 

any losses of government funds or property. 

 
3. The delayed submission of the CY 2020 Report on the Physical Count of 

Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) by the Supply Officer contravened 

Section 38, Chapter 10 of GAM Volume 1, hence preventing the Auditor from 

conducting a timely verification on the existence, condition, ownership, and 

valuation of the PPEs, as well as not proving the accuracy of their balances 

presented in the books at P179,188,805.16. 

 

We recommended that Management strictly comply with the submission of the Report 

on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) within the prescribed 

deadline pursuant to Section 38, Chapter 10 of the GAM Volume 1. Otherwise, the proper 

sanctions for inefficiency shall be imposed upon the personnel concerned. 

 

4. Accounts Payable in the total amount of P1,163,048.71 remained dormant for 
more than two (2) years contrary to the existing provisions under Executive 

Order No. 87 and PD 1445, thus immobilizing public funds and hindering 

resource planning and allocation thereof. 

 

We recommended that Management comply with the provisions of the Executive 

Order No. 87 and PD 1445. 

 

The above audit observations and recommendations were discussed with the 

agency officials in an exit conference held on 24 February 2021 and their comments were 

considered in the report, where appropriate.
