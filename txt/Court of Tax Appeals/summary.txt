	EXECUTIVE SUMMARY





A)		Introduction



The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) was created on June 16, 1954 by virtue of Republic Act (RA) No. 1125 with exclusive appellate jurisdiction to review by appeal, decisions of the Collector of Internal Revenue, Commissioner of Customs, and the Provincial or City Boards of Assessment Appeals.



With the passage of RA No. 9282 on April 23, 2004, the CTA became an appellate Court equal in rank to the Court of Appeals with an expanded jurisdiction not only on civil tax cases but also on cases that are criminal in nature, as well as, local tax cases, property taxes, and final collection of taxes. 



The CTA envisions to remain worthy of public trust and confidence by maintaining its impartiality, competence, transparency, and faithful compliance with tax laws as guided by the following principles:



1)		Fair and speedy collection of taxes by the Government;

2)	Adequate judicial remedies to taxpayers against unreasonable or unjust tax assessments and refund of excessive or erroneously collected taxes;

3)	Proper interpretation of tax statutes;

4)	Adherence to the independence of the Judiciary; and

5)	Utmost deference for public trust and confidence in the Judiciary.



With the passage of RA No. 9503 on July 5, 2008, the organizational structure of the CTA was expanded to include one Presiding Justice as Head of the Court, assisted by eight Associate Justices.  The CTA may sit en banc or in three divisions with each division consisting of three Justices.  The CTA, as one of the Courts comprising the Philippine Judiciary, is under the administrative supervision of the Supreme Court. The Court is headed by Presiding Justice Roman G. Del Rosario.



The personnel complement of 285 composed of 202 permanent, 71 co-terminous and 12 contractual positions, assist in the performance of adjudicative support functions with some non-adjudicative or administrative functions among the Office of the Clerk of Court (OCC), Judicial Records Division, Management Information Systems Division, Internal Audit Service, Office of the Legal and Technical Services, Tax Specialist Division, Library, and the Office of Administrative and Finance Services.

C)		 Scope of Audit



	The audit covered the accounts and operations of the CTA for CY 2020. The audit was conducted to: a) verify the level of assurance that may be placed on Management’s assertions on the financial statements; b) recommend agency’s improvement opportunities; c) determine the propriety of transactions as well as the extent of compliance with pertinent laws, rules and regulations; and d) determine the extent of implementation of prior year’s audit recommendations.





D)		Audit Opinion on the Financial Statements 



The Auditor rendered an unmodified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the financial statements of the CTA for CY 2020. 



	

	

	

	

E)	Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations

	

The following are the significant audit observations and recommendations, the details of which are discussed in Part II of this report:

	

1)		The efficient and timely renewal of the Court’s Internet Service Provider (ISP) contract amounting to P1.200 million was not met in view of delays in the gathering of documents to support its renewal. (Observation No. 1)

	

	We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief Judicial Staff Officer, MISD to:



a)	Monitor all contracts that need periodic renewal based on the result of assessment or cost benefit analysis that continued to favor the existing provider;



b)	Immediately initiate the procurement process to replace the expired contracts so that existing contract is  not  automatically extended beyond the contract period; and



c)	Strictly adhere to the Guidelines on the Procurement of Water, Electricity and Internet Service Provider as amended under GPPB Resolution No. 41-2017.



2)		Semi-Expendable Properties of the Court totaling P0.562 million were issued without the required Inventory Custodian Slip (ICS) duly received by end users, thus accountability was not established. (Observation No. 2)

	

	We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Property Custodian to:

	

a)	Immediately prepare the ICS to all individual end-users of all the semi expendable properties presented in Table No.1 in order to establish proper responsibility and accountability thereof; and



b)	Regularly prepare ICS upon issuance of any item of Semi-expendable property as reflected in the submitted monthly Report of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI).



The observations and recommendations covered in this report have been communicated and discussed with Management through the Summary of Audit Observations and Recommendations (SAOR) issued on June 30, 2021. Management comments were incorporated in the report, where appropriate.







F)		Status of Audit Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges

	

	There were no audit suspensions, disallowances and charges issued during the year.  Deficiencies noted during the year were either complied with or settled immediately upon communicating to the concerned officials and employees of such findings.  There were also no unsettled audit suspensions, disallowances and charges in prior years.



G)	Status of Implementation of Prior Year’s Audit Recommendations



All of the six audit recommendations embodied in the CY 2019 Annual Audit Report were implemented.
