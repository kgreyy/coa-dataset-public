EXECUTIVE SUMMARY





Introduction

             

		By virtue of Republic Act (RA) No. 5521 dated June 21, 1969, Bicol University (BU) evolved from six reputable educational institutions integrated to form the first State University in Region V. The Bicol Teachers College (BTC) with its Laboratory School (BTLC) and Daraga East Central School (DECS) both at Daraga, Albay together with Albay High School formed the College of Education and its Laboratory School. Bicol Regional School of Arts and Trades (BRSAT) at Legazpi City became the College of Industrial Technology, College of Engineering, and Institute of Architecture. Formerly known as Roxas Memorial Agricultural School (RMAS) at Guinobatan, Albay became the College of Agriculture and Forestry, while the School of Fisheries at Tabaco City formed the Tabaco Campus. The University’s registered office is located in Legazpi City.



At present, BU operates on seven campuses with 14 colleges and two institutes. It is composed of the following campuses with its cluster of colleges:

Independent Auditor’s Report on Financial Statements

	

The Auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the financial statements of Bicol University for CY 2020 due to the following material errors and omissions as stated in the Independent Auditor’s Report and discussed in detail in Part II of this Report:



1)	   A net discrepancy of ₱4.01 million between bank and book balances existed due to the absence of a complete and updated Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS). Likewise, the year-end General Ledger (GL) balances of Cash in Bank - Local Currency Current Account is over by ₱24.66 million as against its subsidiary records;  



2)	  Unr	econciled discrepancy of ₱745.04 million exists between inventory report and book balance of Property, Plant, and Equipment (PPE) account due to inability to submit a complete inventory report and inclusion of damaged and unserviceable properties costing at least ₱5.77 million in the asset account;



3)	   	A net discrepancy of ₱62.00 million exists between Accounts Payable account per GL and unpaid obligations under due and demandable in the Financial Accountability Reports (FARs);



4)	   Existence of abnormal balance aggregating ₱37.92 million in the Other Payables account and non-reversion to the Accumulated Surplus/Deficit account of the unidentified liability accounts totaling ₱3.63 million aged more than four years rendered the account unreliable; and



5)	   Existence of prior year’s unremitted taxes of ₱18.33 million under the General Fund that should have been covered by the Tax Remittance Advice (TRA) and unreconciled difference of ₱51.42 million in TRA reported under FAR and per GL.	





Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations

		

	For the exceptions noted earlier, the Auditor recommended that Management:

	

1)		 a. Enroll with the LBP’s online facility to be able to view and print the bank statements of the University’s depository accounts at any given time;

	

b)		  For common depository accounts, designate an Accountant in charge to prepare and submit BRS as of December 31, 2020 and monthly thereafter in coordination with the other cluster Accountants who shall facilitate in the identification of deposits and disbursements credited and cleared in the bank based on the monthly financial reports of their respective Cashiers;

	

c)		  For other depository accounts, instruct the Accountant under whose responsibility its accounting is lodged to prepare and submit BRS as of December 31, 2020 and monthly thereafter;

	

d)		  Direct the immediate recording of book reconciling items as identified and thereafter submit to COA its corresponding journal entry vouchers duly supported by necessary documentation such as bank debits/credits memo, generated JEVs of the erroneous entry adjusted;

	

e)		  Require the Accounting Unit to reconcile the GL balances of the Account CIB-LCCA with its subsidiary ledgers; and

	

f)		  Impose appropriate administrative sanctions to responsible Accounting personnel who are unable to prepare and submit this mandated report.



	2.a. 	Direct the concerned Inventory Committees through their Deans/Directors to plan for the systematic conduct of inventory taking of assets under the new normal condition with prior notice to the Audit Team;

	

a)		  Remind the Inventory Committees to adopt the prescribed format of Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) and observe the instructions indicated under Appendix 73, GAM for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume II;

	

b)		  Designate an employee to prepare a consolidated RPCPPE of the University to facilitate the reconciliation of PPE accounts between records maintained by the Supply and Accounting Offices;

	

c)		  Require the Accountants and the Supply Officers to reconcile any discrepancy noted between their records to enable them to adjust accordingly;

	

d)		  Direct the concerned Supply Officers and Accountable Officers to prepare and submit the required Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Properties (IIRUP) and Report of Lost, Stolen, Damaged, Destroyed Property (RLSDDP), respectively, to serve as basis in the derecognition of the unserviceable and lost/damaged PPE accounts; and 

	

e)		  Instruct the Accountant to prepare and maintain the lapsing schedule of depreciation for all depreciable assets to check the accuracy of the computation of depreciation of PPEs per Electronic National Government Accounting System (e-NGAS) and submit the same to the Audit Team for verification.

	

	3. Require the Chief Accountant to:

	

a)		 Review and reconcile the amounts of expenditures, disbursements and unpaid obligations recorded in the books with the information presented under the financial accountability reports and book-up the obligations; and

	

b)		 Set a synchronized cut-off date with the Budget Sections on their receipt of DVs to be recorded to minimize the existence of discrepancy between their records.  

	

	4.a. Direct the concerned Accountants to investigate the subject liability accounts marked “For Reconciliation” and those with negative balances to be able to identify the specific creditors and record the necessary adjusting entries; 

	

a)		 Revert the Other Payables accounts that remained outstanding for more than two years to the Accumulated Surplus/Deficit account; and

	

b)		  Provide disclosure on the nature and aging of the liability accounts in the Annual Financial Reports.

	

	5.a. Direct the Finance Office to reconcile the noted difference of TRA between the books and the accountability report;

	

a)		 Require the Accountants to examine the correctness of the reported outstanding balances of Due to BIR account, prepare adjustments, when necessary, and furnish the audit team with its copy duly supported with attachments for verification;

	

b)		  Provide disclosure in the Notes to Financial Statement for information on the constructive remittance of withheld taxes made for the year;

	

c)		 	Order the immediate remittance of overdue taxes withheld totaling ₱36.43 million otherwise be held liable under Section 255 of National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) with penalties and charges prescribed in Annex A of Revenue Memo Order (RMO) No. 7-2015; and

	

d)		 See to it that taxes are withheld and remitted within the deadline set by pertinent BIR rules and regulations.

	

	Moreover, the following are the notable observations and the corresponding recommendations, which are discussed in detail in Part II of this Report:

	

1)	    Procedural weakness in the recording of financial transactions resulted in (a) non-reversal of unreleased checks amounting to ₱3.77 million; (b) existence of stale checks for adjustment and cancellation totaling ₱178,434 and ₱0.70 million, respectively; and (c) unrecorded paid disbursements amounting to ₱2.24 million transacted as early as CYs 2016 to 2020, inconsistent with applicable accounting rules and regulations prescribed by the Commission.



We recommended that Management:



	a)	   Remind the Cashiers to provide in the Report of Checks Issued (RCI) the complete information of all checks issued whether released or unreleased and to submit regularly the Schedule of Unreleased Checks along with the RCI;



	b)	   Require the Cashiers to regularly monitor those unclaimed checks that have become stale for prompt cancellation and reporting in the List of Unreleased Checks; 



	c)	   Direct the Accountants to record the necessary adjustments and observe the proper accounting for unreleased checks and stale checks as prescribed by the Government Accounting Manual (GAM); and 



	d)	   Instruct the Supply Officers to submit the paid disbursement vouchers (DVs) under their custody to their respective Accounting Offices for the immediate recording of the subject transactions.   

 

1)	     Dormant bank accounts with a balance of ₱7.21 million remained in the books and   were maintained with Authorized Government Depository Bank (AGDB), contrary to Department of Finance (DOF)-DBM-Commission on Audit (COA) Joint Circular No. 4-2012, COA Circular No. 2015-001 and Section 10 of the General Provisions of the General Appropriations Act (GAA) for the fiscal year (FY) 2020, thereby, depriving the national government of beneficial use of the fund.



We reiterated that Management cause the immediate reversal of all dormant bank accounts to the General Fund of the National Treasury consistent with the procedural guidelines under DOF-DBM-COA Joint Circular No. 4-2012 and COA Circular No. 2015-001. 2. If analysis and review of the funds are not possible due to the absence of records, the Finance Unit should request for the corresponding write-off following Section 10 of COA Circular No. 97-001.



2)	     Schedule of Accounts Receivable in the financial statements showed overdue accounts amounting ₱1.18 million and inclusion of collectibles from unidentified debtors have remained in the books for over three years, contrary to Section 2 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445, thus, depriving the agency of the funds to support its operation.

	

We recommended that Management:



a)	 Require the Accountant to reconcile the balances of the undetermined portion of Accounts Receivable-Internally Generated Fund (IGF) reported in the financial statements and the Schedule of Dormant Receivable Accounts; and



b)	 Exercise due diligence in the collection of receivables and regularly issue demand letters to the debtors with overdue accounts to enforce its payment.



3)	  	The accuracy, reliability, and existence of the reported balances of various Inventory accounts in the aggregate amount of ₱12.27 million as of December 31, 2020, cannot be ascertained due to incomplete Report on the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) and non-reconciliation of inventory reports with the Accounting records resulting in a net discrepancy of ₱7.55 million, thereby, impairing the fair presentation of the affected accounts in the financial statements. 



We recommended that Management:



	a)	 Require the concerned Supply Officers to submit the required inventory report as of December 31, 2020, and thereafter, remind compliance of the notification for the conduct of inventory taking and submission of this mandated report; 



	b)	 Direct the concerned Supply Officers to immediately submit all paid DVs under their custody to the Accounting Office and cause the recording of these transactions in the books; 



	c)	 Remind the Accountants to observe the proper accounting of the procured, delivered, and issued Inventory items as prescribed by the GAM; and



	d)	 Instruct the Accounting and Supply Offices to regularly update and reconcile their records to be able to promptly record the necessary adjustment/corrections in their respective books/records, if warranted.



4)	     Premiums of the officials and employees of the University that are due to the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) were not remitted promptly, contrary to Section 14 of the Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (R-IRR) RA No. 8291, thus, the overdue GSIS contributions and loan repayments have accumulated to ₱3.20 million as of December 31, 2020. 



We recommended that Management remit in full the amounts due to the GSIS without further delay. Strictly comply with Section 14 of the R-IRR of RA No. 8291 for the timely remittances of premium contributions as well as members' loan amortizations to avoid interest and penal sanctions imposed under Section 52 of the Act.



5)	     Pertinent provisions of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997, on the grant and liquidation of cash advances were not strictly enforced resulting in unliquidated cash advances amounting to ₱2.04 million at year-end. 



We recommended that Management:



	a)	 Require the concerned AOs to immediately liquidate their overdue cash advances through the issuance of a demand letter, copy furnish the Audit Team; 



	b)	 For those with initial demand, issue final demand to settle their unliquidated cash advances otherwise, cause or order the withholding of the payment of any money due them or deduct the same from the payroll. Furthermore, refrain from granting additional cash advance if the previous cash advance has not yet been liquidated; and 



	c)	 Instruct the Chief Accountant to analyze the negative balances and thereafter, record the appropriate adjustment/reclassification entry.



6)	    The University was not able to implement the procedures prescribed under COA Circular No. 2020-006 for the one-time cleansing of PPE accounts of Government Agencies, which is not in keeping with the Commission’s effort of assisting government agencies to come up with reliable PPE balances that are verifiable as to the existence, condition, and accountability.

	

We recommended that Management require the Inventory Committees, in coordination with the Property and Accounting Units, to conduct a one-time cleansing of PPE accounts following the prescribed procedures under COA Circular No. 2020-006 to be able to come up with reliable PPE balances. Thereafter, cause the submission of RPCPPE annually for all units and call the attention of those officials who continually not able to submit the mandated report. 



7)	     Four infrastructure projects totaling ₱91.57 million awarded to the same contractor showed overlapping contract implementation with the same key personnel assigned and equipment to be utilized due to lapses in the post-qualification process, contrary to Section 23.6, Rule VIII and Section 34.3, Rule X of the Revised IRR of RA No. 9184, thus, resulted in the delayed implementation of these projects depriving the University the benefit to use the same at the earliest possible time.

	

We recommended that Management:



	a)	 Direct the Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) and its Technical Working Group (TWG) to carefully examine the contractor’s manpower and equipment on all the projects to be awarded and not on an individual project only in case the contractor is the lowest bidder in several projects which have the same or overlapping period of implementation; 



	b)	 Require contractors to augment their manpower and/or equipment to be utilized in the projects awarded to them which have the same or overlapping period of implementation, otherwise, disqualify them from obtaining several contracts in accordance with the provisions of Section 23.6 of the 2016 IRR of RA No. 9184; and



	c)	 Require the contractor to complete the projects as soon as possible and impose liquidated damages for the unperformed works.



8)	 	Six infrastructure projects with an aggregate cost of ₱132.94 million remained unfinished due to the inability of the contractors to satisfactorily complete the work within the specified contract time and for Management’s inability to take appropriate action thereto, thus, the intended users/beneficiaries were deprived of the immediate use of the facilities.



We recommended that Management direct the Project Engineer in charge of the University projects to determine the unperformed work as of the target date of completion of the aforementioned projects, prepare the corresponding inspection report and impose the appropriate liquidated damages. Further, consider the remedies provided under Section 8.1 Annex E of the R-IRR of RA No. 9184 to fast-track the completion of the projects with significant delays.  



9)	   Termination and forfeiture of performance security, and adoption of remedies provided by RA No. 9184 were not made on four infrastructure contracts in CY 2017 aggregating ₱3.86 million which remain unimplemented to date.



We reiterated that Management:



a)	 Cause the immediate termination of the contract and forfeit the contractor's performance security following Annex I of the 2016 Revised IRR of RA 9184; and



b)	 Adopt the procedures for the suspension or blacklisting of contractors, etc. under Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB) guidelines as a form of administrative penalties to the concerned bidders imposed under Section 69 of the same Act.



10)	  The University’s provision of technical assistance in collaboration with the Department of Social Welfare and Development Field Office V (DSWD FOV) under its Skills Training Program for the Pantawid Pamilya beneficiaries with funding of more than ₱313.02 million was not fully attained due to a very low percentage rate of accomplishment at 16.82 per cent, in terms of targeted beneficiaries, thus, defeating the purpose for which the project was created almost three years ago. 



We recommended that Management to secure first the approval of the requested extension of the project implementation from the Source Agency, otherwise, immediately return the much-needed fund for other priority projects of the government. When approved, the following action must be undertaken:



a)	 Require the project implementers to immediately review and re-assess the feasibility of those unimplemented projects as to the level of interest and willingness of the member/beneficiaries to continue and sustain the chosen project under the new normal setting, availability of the training materials within the locality, as well as the sufficiency of the allocated funds for the project; 

 

b)	 Refund the corresponding cost of skills training for projects identified as cancelled and no longer viable to continue; and



c)	 Direct the monitoring team to regularly visit and inspect the implementation of the program to ensure that its execution is still in line with the program’s objective and within the proposed final timelines.



11)	  The regularity on the grant of COVID-19 Hazard Pay in the amount of ₱1.59 million cannot be easily determined due to incomplete documentation and improper recording of claims totaling ₱41,000 as prescribed by the pertinent provisions of Administrative Order No. 26 dated 23 March 2020, DBM Budget Circular No. 2020-1 dated March 24, 2020, and Section 4 (6) of PD No. 1445. 

	

We recommended that Management:



	a)	 Demand the refund over the excessive hazard pay claims by the concerned personnel;



	b)	 Submission of lacking documents, such as Special Accreditation Orders (SAOs) and/or Daily Time Records (DTRs) for the period March 2020 to May 2020 for proper audit disposition of the subject hazard pay with incomplete documentation; 



	c)	 Observe proper account classification as prescribed under the latest Revised Chart of Accounts issued by the Commission; and



	d)	 For future issuance of SAO, as an internal control mechanism, issue pre-numbered orders duly indicated with a specific purpose and inclusive dates of effectivity as necessary.



12)	   Management has been unsuccessful in the enforcement of refund for breach of contracts by those grantees who were unable to complete their scholarship, thus, recoupment of at least ₱7.53 million representing scholarship benefits, salaries, and allowances from at least 30 scholar employees paid for academic years (AYs) 2012-2018 remain uncollected, inconsistent with Section 16.1 of the Human Resource Development Program Policy Guidelines (HRDPPG).



We recommended that Management undertake the following courses of action:



a)	 Cause the promulgation of a decision to be able to recoup the financial assistance, salaries, and allowances relative to the scholarship grants from those scholars with breach of contracts; and



b)	 The respective Accounting Office/s, in coordination with the Campus Administrative Officer, come up with their computations of the monetary benefits for each employee grantee with a final decision of the violation.



13)	   Series of cash advances totaling ₱10.62 million to pay students’ beneficiaries and honoraria claims of regular employees were granted without observing Section 89 of PD No. 1445 and DBM Circular Letter No. 2018-14 dated December 28, 2018.



We reiterated our previous recommendation that Management adopt the Advice to Debit Account (ADA) mode of disbursement in releasing funds to students-grantees wherein these student-grantees shall be required to open an account with the AGDB of the University and regular employees as well, so that all claims will be credited to their respective accounts, instead of having it cash advance by the AO.  



14)	  The BU Tabaco Campus (BUTC) Management did not immediately notify the Audit Team for the losses of government records and properties amounting to ₱2.56 million caused by fire and neither a request for relief from property accountability was submitted, not in keeping with Section 73 (1) of PD No. 1445 and Sections 498 and 499, Volume 1 of the Government Accounting and Auditing Manual (GAAM).



We recommended that BU Managament: 



a)	Instruct the Supply and Property Management official to determine based on records the campus officials accountable to the lost properties;

 

b)	Remind the AO to file his/her request for relief from property accountability to the COA in accordance with Section 73 (1) of the PD No. 1445 and Sections 498 and 499, Volume I of GAAM, duly supported with the required documents and explanation for the delay in filing; and



c)	Require the BUTC Dean to provide a written explanation why the official records and documents in the custody of COA were damaged by fire considering that the fire did not reach the COA BUTC Office and how come the steel cabinets where said documents were stored/kept are already being used by the Accounting Office.
