OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS





FINANCIAL AND COMPLIANCE AUDIT



Cash and Cash Equivalents



1)	Unremitted collections of two former Cashiers amounting to ₱116,338 or 99 per cent of the Cash-Collecting Officers account’s year-end balance has been overdue and outstanding for more than five years.



		Pertinent rules and regulations relative to collection and deposit are restated below:



		Section 69 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 provides that, “Public officers authorized to receive and collect moneys arising from taxes, revenues, or receipts of any kind shall remit or deposit intact the full amounts so received and collected by them to the treasury of the agency concerned and credited to the particular accounts to which the said moneys belong.”



		Sections 21 of the Manual on the New Government Accounting System (MNGAS) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I, and COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997, state that all collecting officers shall deposit intact all their collections, as well as collections turned over to them by sub-collectors/tellers, with Authorized Government Depository Bank (AGDB) daily, or not later than the next banking day.  



		Section 6.3 of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997, also states that the AO shall reconcile the book balance with the cash on hand daily. He shall foot and close the books at the end of each month. The AO and the Accountant shall reconcile their books of accounts at least quarterly.



		Section 39, Chapter 5 on Revenue and Other Receipts of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for NGAs, Volume I, likewise provides for the reporting of collections and deposits as performed by collecting officers.  Section 40 of the same manual, illustrates the detailed procedures for collections and deposits through the collecting officer. In summary, the collecting officers prepare the Report of Collection and Deposit (RCD) as supported by official receipts (ORs) and validated deposit slips. It is the Accounting unit that makes the necessary Journal Entry Voucher (JEV), on the basis of said report and documents, to recognize the transactions in the books of accounts of the Agency. 



		Lastly, Section 80 of PD No. 1445 prescribes the final report of accountable officers:



1)	An accountable officer, upon ceasing to act in his official capacity as such, shall submit to the auditor of the agency concerned a report of his accountability.



(2) Any remaining balance of such accountability shall be deposited in the proper treasury without unnecessary delay.



As of December 31, 2020, the Cash – Collecting Officers account reported a balance of ₱117,967.25 for all funds.  Analysis showed that ₱116,337.55 or 99 percent of that balance pertains to unremitted collections of two accountable officers (AO) that had been outstanding for more than five years as detailed below:

This is a reiteration of the prior year’s finding that has remained unimplemented as of year-end.



The designation of AO1 as Cashier supposedly ended in July 2016. Meanwhile, the cash accountability of AO2 who had retired from the government service on September 10, 2013, was already paid in full on April 28, 2021.



As to the above cash accountability of AO1, the collection pertains to the refund of excess cash advances of certain BU personnel that was receipted under OR# 7344922-7344923 dated June 2015, thus, already overdue and outstanding for more than five years. The corresponding RCD for June 2015 however remains unsubmitted because allegedly it was returned by the Accounting Office to AO3 for revision. Succeeding RCDs of the AO showed zero balance of undeposited collection up to the last reporting period submitted on file which is July 2016.



During the interview, AO1 promised to produce copies of validated deposit slips to support the deposit made of the subject refund. In case she cannot do so, she expressed her willingness to pay on an installment basis or thru salary deduction for the settlement of her cash accountability.

	

Last March 8, 2021, AO1 has partially remitted collections amounting to ₱20,000 under OR No. 7344990, out of the unremitted balance of ₱97,100, thus, leaving a balance of ₱77,100.



Had reconciliation between AO’s records and accounting books been made by the concerned officials, the foregoing discrepancies could have been detected earlier and immediate action could have been undertaken. Outstanding cash balances further indicate non-conformance with the procedure on the deposit of collections to the Treasury of the Philippines (TOP)/AGDBs.

 

We recommended and Management agreed to undertake the following courses of action:



a)	Require the concerned AO to immediately remit in full the cash balances in her custody to the Cashier who will facilitate the deposit thereof to the Treasury and/or AGDB, otherwise, cause the withholding of payment of salary and other monetary benefits due her; 



b)	Remind all AOs to deposit intact all collections of the day on the same day or the next banking day;



c)	Order all the Accounting and Cashier offices to reconcile their records quarterly as mandated;



d)	Remind AO that upon ceasing to act in their official capacity as such, to comply with Section 80 of PD No. 1445 as its final report requirement; and



e)	Instruct the responsible officers and employees to be cautious on the grant of the approval of the clearance of accountability.





2)	Procedural weakness in the recording of financial transactions resulted in: (a) non-reversal of unreleased checks amounting to ₱3.77 million; (b) existence of stale checks for adjustment and cancellation totaling ₱178,434 and ₱0.70 million; and (c) unrecorded paid disbursements amounting to ₱2.24 million transacted as early as 2016 to 2020. 



International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) provides that, the Financial Statements shall present fairly the financial position, financial performance, and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with the definition and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in IPSAS. The application of IPSAS, with additional disclosures, when necessary, is presumed to result in financial statements that achieve a fair presentation. (Par. 27, IPSAS I)



Paragraph 29 of IPSAS I requires an entity to present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that meets a number of qualitative characteristics. This guidance summarizes the qualitative characteristics of financial reporting. One of which is Completeness which requires that the information in financial statements should be complete within the bounds of materiality and cost.

		Section 12, Chapter 6 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I discussed the procedures for Disbursements by Checks, areas of responsibility covered by the Accounting Division/Unit and/or designated Staff from the preparation of JEVs and recording in the Check Disbursements Journal (CkDJ). 



Under Section 44 of the same chapter, the accounting for cancelled checks was provided, as follows:



Checks may be cancelled when they become stale, voided, or spoiled. The depository bank considers a check stale if it has been outstanding for over six months from the date of issue or as prescribed.



A stale, voided, or spoiled check shall be marked cancelled on its face and reported as follows:



a)	Voided, spoiled, or unclaimed stale checks with the Cashier shall be reported as cancelled in the List of Unreleased Checks that will be attached to the RCI.



b)	New checks may be issued for the replacement of stale/spoiled checks in the hands of the payees or holders in due course, upon submission of the stale/spoiled checks to the Accounting Division/Unit. A certified copy of the previously paid DVs shall be attached to the request for replacement. A JEV shall be prepared to take up the cancellation. The replacement check shall be reported in the RCI.



Also, Section 56 provides that a Schedule of Unreleased Commercial Checks shall be prepared by the Cashier for submission to the Accounting Division/Unit. All unreleased checks at the end of the year shall be reverted back to the cash accounts. A JEV shall be prepared to recognize the restoration of the cash equivalent to the unreleased checks and the recognition of the appropriate liability/payable account. The accounting entry for the restoration of the unreleased check to the cash account shall be a debit to the Cash in Bank, Local Currency Current account with credit to the appropriate liability account. There shall be no physical cancellation of the checks. The JEV supporting such restoration shall form part of the supporting document to the financial statements to be submitted to COA at year-end. At the start of the ensuing year, another JEV shall be drawn to reverse the previous entry made and recognize the availability of the checks for release. This procedure shall not apply to account Cash-Modified Disbursement System (MDS) since there is no actual cash with the GSBs.



In the case of the University, CkDJ is not being prepared by the Accounting Unit due to the adoption of the Electronic National Government Accounting System (e-NGAS) facility that utilizes the use of General Journal for all kinds of transactions.

 

Our verification of the Cashiers’ Reports of Checks Issued (RCI) submitted as of December 31, 2020, disclosed that some important details such as payee, particulars and amount for unreleased checks were omitted in the report. Likewise, some of the AOs were not able to regularly submit the Schedule of Unreleased Checks along with the RCI.



Unreleased checks at year-end totaled 91 checks amounting to ₱4.43 million. It should be noted that the documents for these unreleased checks remain unsubmitted to COA and this observation has already been communicated to Management through the issuance of an Audit Observation Memorandum (AOM). Analysis of the report further showed the following deficiencies:



a)	Unreleased checks amounting to ₱3.77 million were not reverted to cash 



Verification of records revealed that the Accounting Offices were not able to make the necessary adjustments or reversal for those unreleased commercial checks not yet considered stale at year-end, as required under the existing COA regulations. Summary of those unreleased checks that were supposed to be reverted to cash and restored with their corresponding liability account at year-end is presented in the table below:

b)	Unclaimed checks included stale checks for cancellation and adjustment for reversion of cash and liability totaling ₱0.70 million and ₱178,434, respectively.



The list of unreleased checks included checks that have been outstanding for more than six months to more than four years from their date of issuance, hence, already considered stale. Some of these stale checks were not yet recorded in the books for cancellation while those that have been cancelled were not adjusted for reversion of the cash and liability previously decreased.

Inquiry disclosed that the documents pertaining to the unrecorded disbursements remain in the custody of the Supply Office pending the completion of the delivery by the PS-DBM. This practice however, resulted in the non-recording by the respective Accounting Offices of the subject disbursements.



The foregoing deficiencies showed non-compliance with the aforementioned accounting rules and regulations, thereby, impairing the fair presentation of the appropriate expense and cash accounts in the financial statements. 



We recommended that Management:



	a)	Remind the Cashiers to provide in the RCI the complete information of all checks issued whether released or unreleased and to submit regularly the Schedule of Unreleased Checks along with the RCI;



	b)	Require the Cashiers to regularly monitor those unclaimed checks that have become stale for prompt cancellation and reporting in the List of Unreleased Checks; 



	c)	Direct the Accountants to record the necessary adjustments and observe the proper accounting for unreleased checks and stale checks as prescribed by the GAM; and 



	d)	Instruct the Supply Officers to submit the paid disbursement vouchers (DVs) under their custody to their respective Accounting Offices for the immediate recording of the subject transactions.   

	 

	Management Comment:

	

			BU Management informed the Audit Team in its letter dated May 5, 2021 that the Accounting Section will verify the aforementioned unreleased checks as well as those checks issued to PS-DBM. Necessary adjustments will be effected, if warranted. 

	

	

3)	Petty cash balance in CY 2007 in the amount of ₱33,460 was accounted as Due from Officers and Employees.



Annex A of COA Circular No. 2020-001 dated January 8, 2020, prescribed the Revised Chart of Accounts (RCA) for NGAs (Updated 2019). This includes the description for the accounts Due from Officers and Employees and Petty Cash. 



Due from Officers and Employees is the account debited to record amount of claims from agency's officers and employees for overpayment (not covered by Notice of Disallowance), cash shortage, loss of assets and other bills issued by the agency, losses in excess of allowable variance between books and volumetric count of merchandise inventory and the like (not covered by Notice of Charge). It is credited for receipt of payment, write-off, and approved relief from property accountability.	



Petty Cash account, on the other hand, is the account debited to recognize the amount granted to duly designated Petty Cash Custodian (PCC) for payment of authorized petty or miscellaneous expenses which cannot be conveniently paid through checks or Advice to Debit Account (ADA). This includes replenishments made during the year pertaining to prior year’s expenses charged to the fund and recognized at the end of the preceding year. This also includes unliquidated funds of PCCs who are no longer designated as such, whether in active service or separated from the service. This account is credited for refund and liquidation of cash advance every time there is a change of PCC. It is also credited upon recognition of expenses charged to the fund which remained unreplenished at year-end.



Analysis of the Status of Unliquidated Cash Advances as of December 31, 2020, revealed that there were at least three AOs who have outstanding balances from petty cash fund (PCF) in CY 2007 but were reported under Due from Officers and Employees account in the supporting schedules of year-end FS:



Name of AO

Amount

1.

AO 1

₱5,000.00

2.

AO 2

20,000.00

3.

AO 3

8,460.00



Total

₱33,460.00



The above classification is inconsistent with the description of the accounts Petty Cash and Due from Officers and Employees provided under the RCA for NGAs. 



Further, due to the misclassification of accounts, the outstanding balance of AO3 who is currently designated as the Cashier of BU-Daraga Campus, was not included in her cash accountability during the initial cash examination conducted in CY 2017. 



		As for the other two AOs, the specific purposes of the fund and information as to when they ceased to be accountable officers have yet to be determined. The foregoing accounting error however has resulted in the non-monitoring of the full settlement of the petty cash fund balance that has remained dormant for more than ten years to date.

   



We recommended that Management:



	a)	Investigate the subject PCF balance of ₱33,460 reported under the Due from Officer and Employees account and when validated reclassify to Petty Cash account to restore the cash accountability of the three AOs; and



	b)	Send demand letters to the concerned AOs for the settlement and/or refund of the PCF balance.



Management Comment:



BU Management, in its letter dated April 7, 2021, informed the Audit Team that AO 3 refunded the balance of her PCF. Also, the Accounting Section already sent demand letters to the rest of the AOs mentioned in the aforementioned AOM. 



Copies of the demand letters issued to AO1 and AO2 both dated March 31, 2021 were furnished to the audit team on May 28, 2021. 





4)	Refund and settlement of PCF balance amounting to ₱217,966 of the nine PCF custodians who have been separated/retired/transferred has not been made.



		Petty Cash Fund, as defined under Section 2(r), Chapter 6 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, refers to the amount granted to duly designated Petty Cash Fund Custodian for payment of authorized petty or miscellaneous expenses which cannot be conveniently paid through checks/LDDAP-ADA.



As discussed in the same chapter of the manual under Section 35(b), the unused balance of the PCF shall not be closed/refunded at the end of the year. The fund shall be closed only upon termination, separation, retirement, or dismissal of the Petty Cash Fund Custodian (PCFC), who in turn shall refund any balance to close his/her cash accountability. 



Lastly, Section 80 of PD No. 1445 prescribes the final report of accountable officers:



1)	An accountable officer, upon ceasing to act in his official capacity as such, shall submit to the auditor of the agency concerned a report of his accountability.



(2)  Any remaining balance of such accountability shall be deposited in the proper treasury without unnecessary delay.



Based on the submitted List of PCFC as of December 31, 2020, employees who are no longer designated PCFC but with remaining unliquidated PCF balances are as follows:

Note: 	* - with partial refund in February 2021 



		Further inquiry revealed the following information:



a)	AO3 and AO4’s assignment as PCFC supposedly ended in December 2017, yet, it took them at least three years to refund/close the fund balance.



b)	AO6 was no longer designated as PCFC since July 2016 due to her reassignment to another unit/station. Last November 16, 2020, a demand letter was issued to her in compliance with the prior year’s audit recommendation, however, no settlement has been made to date.



c)	AO7 and AO8’s PCFs were established in April 2018 and August 2018, respectively. AO7’s account balance has no recorded liquidation/settlement since it was established. AO8’s, on the other hand, made partial refund in February 2021.



d)	AO9’s account was a forwarded PCF balance way back in July 2015. 



e)	No data available as to when AO5, AO7, AO8, and AO9 ceased to be PCFCs.



The above deficiencies were indicative of Management’s laxity in the monitoring of the immediate settlement of the PCF balance by the formerly designated PCFCs. Also, full liquidation of the fund was not required before the grant of clearance to those former accountable officers before they were separated from the government service.  



The existing condition is not in compliance with the laws, rules and regulations mandated for this particular financial transaction that could result in idle or loss of government funds.

	

We reiterated that Management:



a)	Issue a demand letter to cause the full settlement or refund of the unused PCF balance by the former custodians, otherwise, cause the withholding of the salary and other benefits due to the concerned AOs who are still in the service. Likewise, send demand letters to the retired employees who were not able to settle their cash accountabilities with the University;



b)	Remind AO that upon ceasing to act in their official capacity as such, to comply with Section 80 of PD No. 1445 as its final report requirement; and



c)	Instruct the responsible officers and employees to be cautious on the grant of the approval of the clearance of accountability.



Management Comment:



BU Management submitted copies of liquidation reports and ORs relative to the PCF balance settlement of the following AOs: AO3, AO4, AO5, AO7 and AO8.



On May 28, 2021, copies of the demand letters issued to AO1, AO2, AO6 and AO9 were also transmitted to COA for information.





Cash in Bank - LCCA



5)		A net discrepancy of ₱4.01 million between bank and book balances existed due to inability of the Accounting Office to prepare a complete and updated Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS). Likewise, the year-end General Ledger (GL) balances of Cash in Bank - Local Currency Current Account (CIB-LCCA) totaling ₱826.81 million is over by ₱24.66 million as against its subsidiary records.



Section 74 of PD No. 1445 mandates that at the close of each month, depositories shall report to the agency head, in such form as he may direct, the condition of the agency account standing on their books. The head of the agency shall see to it that a reconciliation is made between the balance shown in the reports and the balance found in the books of the agency.



Section 12 of Chapter 2 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I provides for the books of accounts and registries of the National Government (NG) entities, which consist of, among others, the GL (Appendix 5) and the Subsidiary Ledgers (SL) (Appendix 6). The GL, as described under Volume II of the same manual summarizes all transactions recorded in the General Journal (GJ) and special journals (e.g. CRJ, CDJ, CkDJ, etc.) maintained in the Accounting Division/Unit. Controlling accounts in the GL shall be supported by details in the SLs. Meanwhile, the SL shows detail for each control account in the GL which is maintained per account and fund cluster by the Accounting Division/Unit. The totals of the SL balances shall be reconciled with the corresponding GL controlling account.



Likewise, Chapter 21 of the same Manual prescribes the procedures for the reconciliation of bank and treasury accounts maintained with Government Servicing Bank which aims to achieve the following objectives found in Section 3 thereof:



a)	check the correctness of both the bank’s and agency’s/entity’s records,

b)	serve as a deterrent to fraud, and

c)	enable the agency/entity or bank to take up charges or credits recognized by the bank or agency/entity but not yet known to the agency/entity or bank.



Accordingly, Sections 5 and 7 of the same chapter requires the Chief Accountant to prepare and submit within twenty (20) days from receipt of the monthly Bank Statement (BS), the bank reconciliation statements for each depository accounts in four copies to be distributed as follows: 



Original – COA Auditor (with all the supporting documents including the JEVs)

Copy 2 – Head of Agency/Entity

Copy 3 – Accounting Division/Unit file

Copy 4 – Bank, if necessary.



		Moreover, Section 42 of Chapter 19 of the Manual, states that errors can arise in respect of the recognition, measurement, presentation, or disclosure of elements of financial statements. X x x. Errors may be classified as current period errors and prior period errors. Current period errors are errors committed and discovered within the same period. It shall be corrected by an adjusting entry, within the same year before the financial statements are authorized for issue. (Emphasis supplied)



Based on the financial statements of the Agency as of December 31, 2020, the account CIB-LCCA has a balance of ₱826.81 million broken down as follows: 



Regular Agency Fund - General Fund (01)			        ₱34,479,444.86

Internally Generated Income - Off-Budgetary Fund (05)	        415,592,117.12

Business Type Income - Off-Budgetary Funds (06)		            5,146,298.84  

Trust Fund - Custodial Funds (07)				        371,592,209.78

Total							                  ₱826,810,070.60  

	

Verification with e-NGAS showed that the above cash balance pertains to 42 depository accounts maintained with Landbank of the Philippines (LBP). 



Results of the bank confirmation however revealed a net discrepancy of ₱4.01 million between the bank and book balances as the total confirmed account balances per bank amounted to ₱830.82 million. Further analysis disclosed the following observations:



			a)	Existence of 33 current accounts of the University with LBP from its three different branches - (29 accounts) Legazpi, (2 accounts) Ligao, and (2 accounts) Tabaco. 



			b)	The confirmed accounts included one unidentified but active LBP-Legazpi current account number 0132-1067-20 with a balance amounting to ₱420,701 which is not accounted for in the books.



			c)	The existence of 10 current accounts cannot be established as these were not confirmed by LBP:

			e)	The confirmation of the existence of Modified Disbursement System (MDS) and Time Deposits was not provided by the bank.



The specific cause/s of the discrepancy between bank and book records could not be easily identified and determined by the Audit Team due to the absence of an updated BRS. This had been a perennial audit observation reported by the Audit Team every audit period and continues to prevail to this day. 



Bank reconciliation is a form of internal control over cash. When done monthly, this measure is expected to provide reliable and accurate financial information of the Cash in Bank account as the latter is reconciled with the balance appearing in the bank statement.  In said regard, we have inventoried the transmitted BRS to apprise us of the status of the agency’s compliance with the report submission.

As gleaned in the table above, only the time deposit account (No. 4) has an updated BRS. The three MDS accounts and 16 out of the 42 current accounts have been prepared with BRS but dated back one to more than seven years ago. It was also observed that the book reconciling items reported in the BRS of current accounts remain unrecorded or unadjusted to date.



Management reasoned out that preparation of bank reconciliation is difficult for the following three current accounts that are commonly used by all the accountable officers assigned in the different cluster/colleges/campuses of the University:

As for the other depository accounts, the continued non-preparation of an updated BRS has yet to be justified.



The audit also disclosed that the balances of the CIB-LCCA accounts per GL and its corresponding subsidiary ledgers did not tally. Comparison of the balances appearing in the two ledgers revealed a net discrepancy of ₱24.66 million as follows:

			The inability of the Accounting Unit to prepare updated BRS for all its depository accounts and the discrepancy of balances between the GL and its subsidiary ledgers have rendered the balance of the CIB-LCCA as of December 31, 2020, unreliable. 

	

We recommended the following courses of action:



a)	Enroll with the LBP’s online facility to be able to view and print the bank statements of the University’s depository accounts at any given time;



b)	For common depository accounts, designate an Accountant in charge to prepare and submit BRS as of December 31, 2020 and monthly thereafter in coordination with the other cluster Accountants who shall facilitate in the identification of deposits and disbursements credited and cleared in the bank based on the monthly financial reports of their respective Cashiers;



c)	For other depository accounts, instruct the Accountant under whose responsibility its accounting is lodged to prepare and submit BRS as of December 31, 2020 and monthly thereafter;



d)	Direct the immediate recording of book reconciling items as identified and thereafter submit to COA its corresponding journal entry vouchers duly supported by necessary documentation such as bank debits/credits memo, generated JEVs of the erroneous entry adjusted;



e)	Require the Accounting Unit to reconcile the GL balances of the Account CIB-LCCA with its subsidiary ledgers; and



f)	Impose appropriate administrative sanctions to responsible Accounting personnel who are unable to prepare and submit this mandated report.





Management Comment:



The Accounting section consistently requests from LBP-Legazpi branch the previous years and updated copies of bank statements, however, the latter cannot deliver the request on time. In addition, they already submitted an enrollment form with the LBP’s online facility to view and print bank statements for this is one factor that causes the delay in preparing BRS, as well as the lack of manpower and high-turnover of job-order accounting personnel doing bank reconciliations. Nevertheless, Management stated that they shall abide by the recommendations given to submit updated BRS.

Auditor’s Rejoinder:



BU Management should request LBP to provide them with a printed copy of their bank accounts to be able to prepare an updated BRS.





			1)	Dormant bank accounts with a balance of ₱7.21 million remained in the books and were maintained with AGDB.



			The Department of Finance (DOF)-Department of Budget and Management (DBM)-COA Joint Circular No. 4-2012 dated September 11, 2012, provides the rules and regulations implementing Executive Order No. 431 dated May 30, 2005, directing the reversion of all dormant accounts, unnecessary special, and trust funds to the General Fund and for other purposes.



			COA Circular No. 2015-001 dated January 29, 2015 requires the reversion to the General Fund of all dormant cash balances, unauthorized accounts, and unnecessary special and trust funds maintained by national government agencies (NGAs) with depository banks.  Among others, the circular is made applicable to: a) accounts pertaining to collections deposited/maintained with an Authorized Government Depository Bank (AGDB) which have remained inactive or those accounts with no transactions other than periodic bank charges based on the existing regulation of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas; and accounts or cash account balances maintained by agencies without specific authority or legal basis or specific purpose.

	

Section III of COA Circular No. 97-001 dated February 5, 1997 also provides the procedures to follow when there are dormant funds or accounts in the books.  As stated in the Circular, the Chief Accountant or other officials concerned shall initiate/cause the verification of the nature or purpose of the fund after which review, analysis, and reconciliation shall be conducted. Specifically, Section III.A.4 enumerates the proper disposition of reconciled and validated accounts and one of these is to remit all cash balances on hand and in other banks to the National Treasury. Furthermore, Section III.A.10 provides that if the analysis/review of the accounts/funds is not possible due to the absence of records and documents, the agency head concerned should request for write-off and/or adjustment of account balances from the COA supported with pertinent documents.



		Section 10 of the General Provisions for the General Appropriations Act (GAA) FY 2020 directs the reversion, closure, and transfer of balances of special accounts, fiduciary or trust funds, revolving funds, and unauthorized Accounts. Departments, bureaus, offices, and instrumentalities of the National Government, including Constitutional Offices enjoying fiscal autonomy and SUCs are mandated to close and revert all balances of Special Accounts, Fiduciary or Trust Funds, and Revolving Funds to the General Fund in any of the following instances: 



i)	when there is no legal basis for its creation;

ii)	when their terms have expired; or 

iii)	when they are no longer necessary for the attainment of the purposes for which said funds were established xxx.



Based on the confirmed bank accounts with LBP, the dormant accounts of the University have increased from 14 to 17 accounts with a total outstanding account balance of ₱7.21 million as of December 31, 2020. Details pertaining to the subject dormant accounts that are found maintained with LBP-Legazpi Branch are presented below:

These accounts showed no activity or transaction in the bank for the past three years or more, thus, considered dormant by the bank. This observation is a reiteration of prior year’s audit finding.



Inquiry disclosed that the University continues to be hesitant to close these dormant accounts because these were opened for the implementation of certain projects and might, later on, have claims against the account. Considering the number of years that the subject accounts have remained dormant, this contention may no longer be possible.



The practice of maintaining these dormant accounts is contrary to existing laws and regulations that aim to avoid idle funds that could have been used to fund priority projects of the government.



We reiterated that Management cause the immediate reversal of all dormant bank accounts to the General Fund of the National Treasury consistent with the procedural guidelines under DOF-DBM-COA Joint Circular No. 4-2012 and COA Circular No. 2015-001. If analysis and review of the funds are not possible due to the absence of records, the Finance Unit should request for the corresponding write-off following Section 10 of COA Circular No. 97-001.

Management Comment:



Management reasoned that the LBP-Legazpi branch has not yet provided the requested complete Bank Statement of those dormant accounts mentioned. They are still in the process of completing the reconciliation of CIB accounts with the records available.





Receivables



			2)	The dormant receivables and unliquidated cash advances amounting to ₱0.92 million and ₱85,785, respectively, remained unsettled and non-moving for 13 to 15 years.



COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016, prescribes the guidelines and procedures on the write-off of dormant receivable accounts, unliquidated cash advances, and fund transfers of NGAs, Local Government Units (LGUs), and Government-Owned and Controlled Corporations (GOCCs).



Sections 6.1 and 7.1 of the subject Circular provides the following guidelines:



Sec. 6.1 All government entities shall conduct regular monitoring and analysis of receivable accounts to ensure that these are collected when these become due and demandable and that cash advances and fund transfers are liquidated within the prescribed period depending upon their nature and purpose;

Xxx.



Sec. 7.1 Conduct regular and periodic verification, analysis, and validation of the existence of the receivables, unliquidated cash advances, and fund transfers, and determine the concerned debtors, accountable officers (Regular and Special Disbursing Officers, Collecting Officers, Cashiers), and the source and implementing government entities concerned;

Xxx.



The Schedule of Dormant Receivable Accounts as of December 31, 2020 showed receivables from debtors with a total of ₱0.92 million which were non-moving for 13 to 15 years. 

		According to the Accountant, the Accounts Receivable under Business Type Income (BTI) pertain to the catering services provided for BU College of Industrial Technology (BUCIT). The debtors were identified, however, their whereabouts were unknown and their profile cannot be established due to insufficient data available.



The Other Receivables under Internally Generated Income (IGI) were comprised of debtors from BU College of Agriculture and Forestry (BUCAF) but the transactions which gave rise to the receivables were not known to Management. Six of the debtors were identified as retired employees with collectibles amounting to ₱225,915 wherein these receivables should have been deducted from their retirement benefits or clearance from their accountabilities should not have been issued unless the settlements of their obligations were made. They also identified seven debtors which have already either resigned, on absence without leave (AWOL), or deceased with collectibles amounting to ₱88,805.



Records of the Accounting Office showed that they have already requested the writing off of three of the dormant receivables amounting to ₱490,325, while they are still gathering information and documents for the remaining dormant receivable accounts to facilitate its write-off.



It was revealed that the contact information and documents of the debtors were filed by the concerned colleges. To gather the relevant documents necessary for the write-off, the management sent letters to the deans of the concerned colleges on March 31, 2018, and August 28, 2018, and issued a follow-up letter on July 30, 2020, informing them to file a request for the authority to write-off dormant receivable accounts together with the necessary supporting documents. However, no documents were submitted yet as of this writing.



		It was learned that the inability of Management to obtain supporting documents to push through with the filing of the request for write-off can be attributed to the lack or insufficient data of debtors retained by the management or the college where the debtors were connected, thereby, causing delay in the process of writing-off the dormant receivables.



Also, analysis of the Report on Consolidated Status of Unliquidated Cash Advances showed that the long outstanding cash advances which remained non-moving for more than 13 years were under the Due from Officers and Employees account amounting to ₱85,785. Three of the debtors are still employed in the University, nine of them were former students, three were already retired, one deceased and another has transferred to another agency. 



The afore-mentioned cash advances remained unsettled or unliquidated due to the absence of documents to validate or support the claims. Despite demands and requests for liquidation, the cash advances remained unliquidated, thereby, prompting the previous audit team to make an appropriate administrative and/or criminal proceeding against these accountable officers/employees through the Ombudsman Office which was filed on August 15, 2014. No further actions were taken by Management.



		Section 5.0 of COA Circular No. 2012-004 dated November 28, 2012, prescribes the legal presumption against non-liquidation of cash advances and stated as, Article 217 of the Revised Penal Code states in equivocal terms that: “The failure of a public officer to have duly forthcoming any public funds or property with which he is chargeable, upon demand by any duly authorized officer, shall be prima facie evidence that he has put such missing funds or property to personal use.”



		However, the writing-off of these unliquidated cash advances was not feasible due to the pending case in Ombudsman which is one of the exceptions enumerated in Section 4 of COA Circular No. 2016-005.



The foregoing condition shows that the University was unable to fully observe the guidelines prescribed by COA Circular No. 2016-005 which aim to minimize the existence of the dormant accounts that deprives government on the use of such funds and affects the fair presentation of the financial statement.



We recommended for Management to take the following courses of action:



a)	For Dormant Receivables Account:

--	Remind the concerned colleges to gather documents pertaining to the debtors and the dormant accounts;

--	Review, assess, and evaluate the available documents relative to the dormant accounts; and

--	Prepare request for the authority to write-off the dormant accounts in accordance with COA Circular No. 2016-005 and attach the necessary supporting documents mentioned in Section 8.3 of the same Circular.



b)	For Unliquidated Cash Advances:

--	Issue demand letters to:

i)	Notify the concerned officials and employees of their responsibility to settle their unliquidated cash advances. If the settlement was not received, withhold from their salaries provided that they were notified and given enough time to liquidate; and

ii)	Employees who already resigned and transferred and the former students of the agency to immediately cause the liquidation or settlement of the unliquidated balances.

--	Request the write-off of the unliquidated cash advance balances of the dead employees.



c)	Strictly comply with the provisions of the above-mentioned Circulars to avoid the accumulation of dormant account receivables and unliquidated cash advances.



Management Comment:



In the letter dated April 7, 2021, BU Management informed the Audit Team that they have already sent letters to the Deans of the concerned colleges inquiring about their action concerning with the audit observation.



They also sent letters to the Administrative Officers and other concerned personnel in order to gather contact information of the concerned debtors/personnel.





			3)	Allowance for Impairment Losses for non-moving and dormant receivable accounts were not recognized.



Paragraph 76 of IPSAS 41 on Financial Instruments provides that the objective of the impairment requirements is to recognize lifetime expected credit losses for all financial instruments for which there have been significant increases in credit risk since initial recognition – whether assessed on an individual or collective basis – considering all reasonable and supportable information, including that which is forward-looking.



Section 9, Chapter 5 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, prescribes the provision for the Impairment Losses and Allowance for Impairment Losses which is stated as follows:



	When an uncertainty arises about the collectibility of an amount already included in revenue, the uncollectible amount, or the amount in respect of which recovery has ceased to be probable, is recognized as an expense (impairment losses), rather than as an adjustment of the amount of revenue originally recognized.



	Entities shall evaluate the collectibility of accounts receivable on an ongoing basis based on historical bad debts, customer/recipient credit-worthiness, current economic trends, and changes in payment activity. An allowance is provided for known and estimated bad debts.



Relative to the above provision, Section 10, Chapter 7 of the same Manual provides for the impairment of financial assets which states as follows:



An entity shall assess at the end of each reporting period whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired. Xxx.



	In the case of Accounts Receivable, the Allowance for Impairment shall be provided in an amount based on collectibility of receivable balances and evaluation of such factors as aging of accounts, collection experiences of the agency, expected loss experiences, and identified doubtful accounts.



		Review of the submitted Financial Statements for CY 2020 and the GLs as of December 31, 2020, revealed that Allowance for Impairment Losses for the non-moving receivable accounts aged more than 10 years and those classified as dormant were not provided. These accounts indicate that the collectability of the receivables from the debtors was uncertain, thereby, allowance for impairment losses should be set up to give consideration to the following factors: aging of accounts, experiences of the agency on the collection and expected losses, and identified doubtful accounts.



		The receivables totaled ₱1.01 million which include debtors from different colleges who were either retired, resigned, AWOL, deceased, transferred to another agency, former students, still employed with the agency, or with unknown whereabouts. 



		It is worthy to note that this observation is a reiteration of prior year’s audit findings on the non-provision of Allowance for Impairment Losses on applicable receivable accounts wherein the Audit Team recommended for Management to exhaust all possible means to collect the accounts, evaluate its collectability, and provide for an allowance on impairment losses.



		The aforementioned guidelines raised doubt as to the validity of the recorded receivables and the accounts reported in the financial statements. The remote possibility of collection of these balances would result in a possible overstatement of receivable accounts.



We reiterated the previous year’s recommendations for Management to:



a)	Increase effort and exhaust possible means in the collection of outstanding receivables by issuing demand letters to debtors;



b)	Assess and evaluate the collectability of the accounts which remained uncollected despite every effort of Management; and



c)	Set up provision for Allowance for Impairment Losses to present fairly the net realizable value of the Accounts Receivable, Loans Receivable-Others, and Other Receivables.



Management Comment:



In the same letter dated April 7, 2021, Management informed the Audit Team that they have already sent letters to the Administrative Officers and other concerned personnel in order to gather contact information of the concerned debtors/personnel.





			4)	Only 0.42 per cent of the prior years’ balances of the Loans Receivable-Others identified as “for reconciliation” were accounted and collected. 



Section 111 of PD No. 1445 on the keeping of the accounts provides that:



1)	The accounts of an agency shall be kept in such detail as is necessary to meet the needs of the agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or control agencies of the government.



2)	The highest standards of honesty, objectivity, and consistency shall be observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate or misleading information.



Review of the GL of Loans Receivable – Others (Regular Agency Fund) revealed that collection was made for Student Financial Assistance Program (STUFAP) Loan with OR No. 2282011 dated January 7, 2020 amounting to ₱6,203. The loan was previously included in the CY 2019 unreconciled balances as “For Reconciliation – July 31, 2015”, thereby reducing the uncollected accounts subject for reconciliation by 0.42 per cent.

		The observation of having unreconciled balances is a reiteration of the previous year’s audit findings and indicates that the Accounting Office was inactive to take appropriate action on the Auditor’s recommendation to consistently maintain the accuracy and reliability of the subject accounts.



We reiterated our previous years’ recommendation for Management to direct the Accounting Office to facilitate the identification of the unadjusted reconciling items in the balance of the Loans Receivable-Others account and determine the liable creditors for their immediate settlement of the accounts.



Management Comment:



In the same letter dated April 7, 2021, Management commented that the Accounting Section already coordinated with the Office of the Student Services (OSAS) particularly with the University Scholarship and Financial Grants In-aid Officer to reconcile the list of debtors.





			5)	Schedule of Accounts Receivable in the financial statements showed overdue accounts amounting to ₱1.18 million and inclusion of collectibles from unidentified debtors have remained in the books for over three years.



Section 2 of PD No. 1445 prescribes the general provision on the declaration of policy which states that, “It is the declared policy of the State that all resources of the government shall be managed, expended or utilized in accordance with law and regulation, and safeguarded against loss or wastage through illegal or improper disposition, with a view to ensuring efficiency, economy, and effectiveness in the operations of the government. The responsibility to take care that such policy is faithfully adhered to rests directly with the chief or head of the government agency concerned.”



In Section 7.4 of COA Circular No. 2016-005, Accountants are required to prepare the aging of dormant receivables, unliquidated cash advances and fund transfers on a quarterly basis using a prescribed format presented in the Annexes to the said circular.



		A review of the Accounts Receivable account for CY 2020 showed that the balance of ₱1.18 million comprised of receivables aged over three years and remained uncollected by the Agency. Details are presented hereunder:

		Verification of the Accounts Receivable balances revealed that the foregoing receivables under Internally Generated Fund (IGF) pertain to the IGP-Catering Services availed by the stated BU Colleges/Unit.



It was also noted that the Accounts Receivable-IGI included in the Schedule of Dormant Receivable Accounts for the quarter ending December 31, 2020, reported debtors “For reconciliation” with a different amount of ₱200,455 which is over by ₱8,250 against that reported in the FS:

		Further, the Accounts Receivable balances under Business Type Income (BTI) pertain to the revenue from the sale of produce of the BUCAF, such as, but not limited to swine and soil crops, and some of which also pertain to the catering services provided for BUCIT. It can be observed that 15 of these debtors were classified as dormant receivables as they were non-moving for over 14 years and were identified to be from BUCIT but their whereabouts were still unknown and the collectability have become uncertain.



		The accumulation of long outstanding receivables from their revenue-generating activities showed that the University was not able to exert effort in validating the propriety of these outstanding balances and send demand letters as soon as they become due, thus, missing the opportunity to raise more funds for their other priority projects.



We recommended that Management:



a)	Require the Accountant to reconcile the balances of the undetermined portion of Accounts Receivable – IGF reported in the financial statements and the Schedule of Dormant Receivable Accounts; and



b)	Exercise due diligence in the collection of receivables and regularly issue demand letters to the debtors with overdue accounts to enforce its payment.



Management Comment:



In the same letter dated April 7, 2021, Management stated that they have submitted Request for Authority to write-off amounting to ₱200,455 dated August 6, 2019 to the Audit Team. 



Management also already sent letters to the Deans of concerned colleges inquiring about their action concerning with the previous Audit Observation Memoranda. 



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



The status of the above-letter request shall be traced in the office records.

  



			6)		Receivable accounts were not supported with complete schedules.



Section 121 of PD No. 1445 prescribes for the provision on financial reports and statements with the following:



1)	The financial reports prepared by the agencies shall comply with the specific requirements of applicable laws and regulations as to nature, accounting basis, content, frequency, and distribution as well as with all applicable restrictions pertaining to information that is classified for national security purposes.



2)	The financial statements shall be based on official accounting records kept in accordance with law and the generally accepted accounting principles and standards.



Paragraph 21(f) of IPSAS 1 stated that a complete set of financial statements comprises:



Xxx.

(f) Notes, comprising a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory notes.



Moreover, Paragraph 7 and 129 of IPSAS No. 1 prescribes the provision for the disclosure in the Notes to Financial Statements, which stated as follows:



Paragraph 7 on the Definitions. Notes contain information in addition to that presented in the statement of financial position, statement of financial performance, statement of changes in net assets/equity, and cash flow statement. Notes provide narrative descriptions or disaggregations of items disclosed in those statements and information about items that do not qualify for recognition in those statements.



Paragraph 129. Notes are normally presented in the following order, which assists users in understanding the financial statements and comparing them with financial statements of other entities: Xxx.



The Receivables account amounting to ₱11.02 million includes accounts under Accounts Receivable, Loans Receivable – Other, Due from NGAs, Receivables – Disallowances/Charges, Due from Officers and Employees, and Other Receivables. A review of these accounts and the corresponding Notes to Financial Statements revealed that the observations on receivables stated from the previous year’s findings were not incorporated in the preparation of the current year’s Notes to Financial Statements.



		Although the Notes to Financial Statements on Receivables included information on Due from NGAs and Receivables – Disallowances/Charges, the completeness, accuracy and reliability of the report is doubtful due to the absence of other information such as aging/ analysis of receivables that will corroborate with the balances in the Financial Statements. Notes to Financial Statements must include supporting information to better understand the financial reports and provide adequate data and disclosures to help the Management in the decision-making processes of the Agency and the other users of the Financial Statements.

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to prepare supporting schedules in the Financial Statements as stated in Chapter 22 of GAM for NGAs, Volume 1, detailing the illustrative accounting entries and financial statements. Likewise, for the Accountant to include details to support the balances of receivable accounts and make the necessary disclosures in the Notes to Financial Statements.





Inventories



			7)	The accuracy, reliability, and existence of the reported balances of various Inventory accounts cannot be ascertained due to incomplete Report on the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) and non-reconciliation of inventory reports with the Accounting records. 



Section 6 Chapter 19 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, enumerates the qualitative characteristics of financial reporting in accordance with Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standards (PPSAS) 1. One of these characteristics is reliability described as, “reliable information is free from material error and bias, and can be depended on by users to represent faithfully that which it purports to represent or could reasonably be expected to represent”.



Chapter 8 of the same Manual covers the definition, recognition, measurement, cost formulas to be used, and related disclosure requirements in accordance with IPSAS 12 on Inventories. It includes specific guidelines and procedures on the acquisition, issue, disposal, and impairment inventory and defines the benchmark for those tangible items not enough to be considered as Property, Plant, and Equipment (PPE). 



Also, Section 9, Chapter 8 provides the use of the Perpetual Inventory Method. It states that supplies and materials purchased for inventory purpose shall be recorded using the perpetual inventory system, resulting in a more accurate inventory records and a running total for the cost of goods sold in each period. Regular purchases shall be coursed through the inventory account and issues thereof shall be recorded as they take place except for supplies and materials purchased out of PCF for immediate use or on emergency cases which shall be charged directly to the appropriate expense accounts.



Section 13, of the same Chapter, explains the Inventory Accounting System. It provides that, physical count/inventory, which is required semi-annually, is an indispensable procedure for checking the integrity of property custodianship. Similarly, Section 490, Volume I of the Government Accounting and Auditing Manual (GAAM) states that said report shall be certified correct by the committee in charge thereof, attested and witnessed by the representative of the auditor concerned, and approved by the chief of the agency in interest. (Section 490.a & b thereof have been concise for purposes of presentation) 



Likewise, one of the instructions enumerated in the preparation of RPCI under Appendix 66 of GAM Volume III states that the report shall be reconciled with the Supplies Ledger Card (SLCs) and Stock Cards (SCs) maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit, and Property and/or Supply Division/Unit, respectively. Any discrepancy shall be verified and/or adjusted accordingly.



As of December 31, 2020, the Detailed Statement of Financial Position (SFP) reported Inventories totaling ₱12.27 million. Verification of the asset accounts however showed several observations that rendered such balance unreliable as follows:



a)	Non-submission of complete RPCIs for all types of inventories and fund clusters 



This is a reiteration of previous years’ observation which remained unimplemented in CY 2020.



The University has 13 designated Supply Officers (SOs) distributed in different Units and Colleges. It was observed that nine or 69 per cent of these SOs regularly submit the required semi-annual RPCIs, while four of them have been irregular or consistently unable to submit said reports for the past four years, as follows:

As mentioned in the AOM issued earlier, Supply Officers directly transmit the inventory reports to the Audit Team on behalf of the Inventory Committees created by campus/college/units. 



For the year under audit, except for the five colleges/campuses/units, no invitation to witness the inventory taking of the other 16 colleges/campuses/units was sent to the Audit Team. Consequently, whether an actual physical count was made and whether there are still inventory stocks existing on hand in the colleges/campuses/units without RCPIs cannot be easily established.



b)	Non-reconciliation of inventory reports with the Accounting records resulting in a net discrepancy of ₱7.55 million



Based on the submitted RPCIs of the nine SOs, the total inventory stocks on hand at year-end were valued at ₱4.72 million thereby showing a significant net variance of ₱7.55 million as against the reported balance per SFP:

The discrepancy shows that the Accounting and the Inventory Committee were unable to reconcile their reports and/or records. Such variance can be attributed to, among others the following:



a)	Non-existing inventory totaling ₱344,600



Despite the observation contained in CY 2019 audit report, the University continued to include inventory items worth ₱344,600 that were found no longer existing at the stockroom, as reiterated in the table below:

The Supply Officers based at the Main Campus unanimously stated that all of their semi-expendable items had been issued and none remain in their stockrooms as of year-end. 

The concerned SOs also stated that the corresponding Reports of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMIs) had been submitted to the Accounting Offices to support the recording of the issuance. However, the reason for the delay and/or non-recording of its issuance by the Accounting Offices has yet to be determined.



c)	Improper recording of undelivered supplies totaling ₱307,174 and unrecorded delivered supplies worth ₱0.62 million from PS-DBM. 



Procurement of common office supplies from PS-DBM in CYs 2018, 2019, and 2020 totaling ₱1.54 million was already paid in full but the items delivered amounted only to ₱1.05 million, thereby, leaving an undelivered balance of ₱483,622 due to non-availability of stocks, broken down as follows:

The accounts pertaining to the above transactions remained unsubmitted to the Audit Team, pending the completion of deliveries, per interviews conducted with the SOs. 



For the recorded but undelivered items amounting to ₱307,174, it is not proper to record the same as a debit to the accounts Inventory, Expense, or Due to NGAs/LGUs considering that they are not yet received by the Agency. The appropriate account that should be used is the receivable account, Due from NGAs to monitor the complete delivery of the inventory procured from PS-DBM. 



The above unrecorded inventory purchases totaling ₱0.80 million is thoroughly discussed in a separate auditing finding for unrecorded disbursements.	







d)	Recording as an outright expense of various procurement

Interview conducted with one of the Accountants, and SOs, and which was further verified from transaction documents revealed that these DVs have already been supported with RSMI, thus, the expense method was applied. However, it does not conform to the existing COA rules prescribed for the accounting of regular purchases.



e)	Irregular use of RPCI as a reference to record debit adjustments to inventory and supplies and materials including semi-expendable accounts



It was observed that several reclassification entries or debit adjustments to Inventory and Expense accounts were made at the end of two semesters using the RPCI as its reference.

Inventory accounts are debited to record acquisition and purchases while the supplies and materials expense accounts including semi-expendable items are debited to recognize the cost of inventories issued to end-users. Consequently, debit entries to the subject asset accounts shall be normally supported by a paid DVs and for the subject expense accounts to be supported by the RSMIs.



The reason for the use of RPCIs as the basis for the debit adjustments by the Accounting personnel has yet to be disclosed.



		We recommended that Management:



	a)	Require the concerned SOs to submit the required inventory report as of December 31, 2020, and thereafter, remind compliance of the notification for the conduct of inventory taking and submission of this mandated report; 



	b)	Direct the concerned SOs to immediately submit all paid DVs under their custody to the Accounting Office and cause the recording of these transactions in the books;



	c)	Remind the Accountants to observe the proper accounting of the procured, delivered and issued Inventory items as prescribed by the GAM; and 



	d)	Instruct the Accounting and SOs to regularly update and reconcile their records to be able to promptly record the necessary adjustment/corrections in their respective books/records, if warranted.



Management Comment:



In the letter dated May 15, 2021, Management made the following statements:



a)		The net variance of ₱7,549,117.81 was due to non-submission of the identified SOs of the semi-annual and the adjusting entries of the Accounting Section pertaining to the PPE AOM No. 2020-020 (2019) dated 11 June 2020.

	

a)		Moreover, the working papers of the current adjustments will be coordinated with the SOs for proper disposition.

	

b)		Other recommendations will be considered. 





Other Assets



			8)	Pertinent rules and regulations on the grant and liquidation of cash advances were not strictly enforced resulting in unliquidated cash advances amounting to ₱2.04 million at year-end.



Section 89 of PD No. 1445 provides the limitation on cash advances. It is stated therein, among others, that a cash advance shall be reported on and liquidated as soon as the purpose for which it was given has been served and that no additional cash advance shall be allowed to any official or employee unless the previous cash advance given to him is first settled or a proper accounting thereof is made. 



COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 further enumerates the guidelines on the grant and liquidation of cash advances, as follows:



4.1.2 No additional cash advance shall be allowed to any official or employee unless the previous cash advance given to him is first settled or a proper accounting thereof is made.



4.1.3 A cash advance shall be reported as soon as the purpose for which it was given has been served.



		Section 5.1 thereof provides the timelines for liquidation of cash advances:



5.1.1	Salaries, Wages, etc. – within five (5) days after each fifteen days/end of the month pay period. 



5.1.3 Official Travel – within sixty (60) days after return to the Philippines in the case of foreign travel or within thirty (30) days after return to his permanent official station in the case of local travel, as provided for in EO 248 and COA Circular No. 96-004.  Xxx



5.7    When a cash advance is no longer needed or has not been used for a period of two (2) months, it must be returned to or refunded immediately to the collecting officer.



5.8  All cash advances shall be liquidated at the end of each year (underscoring ours). X x x the AO shall refund any unexpended balance to the Cashier/Collecting Officer who will issue the necessary receipt.



Article 217 of the Revised Penal Code likewise states in unequivocal terms that: “The failure of a public officer to have duly forthcoming any public funds or property with which he is chargeable, upon demand by any duly authorized officer, shall be prima facie evidence that he has put such missing funds or property to personal use.”



As of December 31, 2020, the Detailed Statement of Financial Position, as well as the Status of Unliquidated Cash Advances for the quarter ended December 31, 2020, disclosed the following balances of the unliquidated cash advances.

Audit of the pertinent accounts revealed that the above-cited rules and regulations on the grant and liquidation of cash advances were not strictly enforced, resulting in the following deficiencies: 



a)	Cash refund from traveling expenses and time-bound undertakings, aged one to over two years, in the total amount of ₱178,841 from 11 officers and employees remained uncollected, as of December 31, 2020. 



This is a reiteration of prior year observation.



Verification of the transaction documents of the 11 officers and employees disclosed that while the liquidation report was submitted, the unexpended/unused travel allowance, however, were not yet returned/refunded, as presented in the table as follows:

The foregoing condition shows non-compliance of existing laws, rules and regulation in the settlement of cash advances and exposes government funds to risk of possible losses thru theft or misuse.



c)	Negative or credit balances totaling ₱5,591 were netted against the total debit balance of the account, instead of showing them at their gross amounts.



		Comparison of the consolidated figures of Tables 1 and 2 against Advances balances reported at year-end Financial Statement disclosed a negative variance of (₱5,591) as presented below:

Reporting the Advances account net of the above negative variance resulted in understatement of the account by the same amount. 



We recommended that Management:



	a)	Require the concerned AOs to immediately liquidate their overdue cash advances through issuance of demand letter, copy furnish the Audit Team; 



	b)	For those with initial demand, issue final demand to settle their unliquidated cash advances otherwise, cause or order the withholding of the payment of any money due them or deduct the same from the payroll. Furthermore, refrain from granting additional cash advance if the previous cash advance has not yet been liquidated; and 



	c)	Instruct the Chief Accountant to analyze the negative balances and thereafter, record the appropriate adjustment/reclassification entry.



Management Comment:



Management, through their letter dated May 25, 2021, furnished the Audit Team copies of demand letters dated March 18, 2021 that was issued to the concerned personnel. The reference JEV Nos. to record the subsequent settlement of BU personnel and the adjustment made for the negative balances of AO3 and AO4 was also indicated in the same transmittal letter:

Property, Plant and Equipment



			9)	The correctness, completeness and existence of the reported PPE accounts totaling ₱1.74 billion as of December 31, 2020 cannot be relied upon due to: (a) the inability to submit a complete Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE); (b) the deficiencies noted in the submitted year-end inventory report; (c) the existence of unreconciled discrepancy of ₱745.04 million between the inventory report and the PPE book balance; (d) the inclusion of damaged and unserviceable properties costing at least ₱5.77 million; and (e) non-preparation/maintenance of lapsing schedule for depreciation charges of all depreciable assets.



Audit of the PPE accounts disclosed the following observations:



				a)	The RPCPPEs of eight out of 24 campuses/colleges/units as of December 31, 2020 were not submitted.



Section 38, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I states that the entity shall have a periodic physical count of PPE, which shall be done annually and presented on the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant, and Equipment (RPCPPE) (Appendix 71) as of December 31 of each year. This shall be submitted to the Auditor concerned not later than January 31 of the following year. Equipment found at the station and losses discovered during the physical count shall be reported to the Accounting Division/Unit for proper accounting/recording.



Verification and review of the RPCPPE showed that only 16 out of the 24 colleges/campuses/units were able to submit the year-end inventory report for CY 2020. Eight of these 16 colleges/campuses/units with report incurred delays ranging from one to 44 days from the due date of the submission of the periodic report. 



As to the eight colleges/campuses/units without an updated year-end inventory report, it was observed that the Polangui Campus and Research and Development Management Division (RDMD) have CY 2019 RPCPPE while the remaining six, namely: BUCAF, BCHRD, BU-EMD, BUCIT, BUCENG, and BU-IA have no report for the past three years. 



As discussed in the preceding paragraphs, the submission of the year-end inventory report is normally done by the SO on behalf of the inventory committees created for every cluster unit/campus/college of the University. 



The inability of the Supply Office to furnish the Audit Team with complete RPCPPEs is contrary to the above-mentioned rules and regulations. 



	a)	Deficiencies were noted in the preparation of the RPCPPEs.



Verification of the RPCPPEs revealed several observations as follows:



			--	The RPCPPE was not prepared by type of PPE, contrary to Appendix 73, GAM for NGAs, Volume II. The types of PPE were combined in one report, viz:



a)	Land, Land Improvement, and School Buildings;

b)	IT Equipment & Office Equipment;

c)	Office Equipment, Furniture;

d)	Laboratories / Laboratory Equipment;

e)	Audio-Visual Presentation and Composing Equipment;

f)	Office Equipment/ Furniture & Accessories;

g)	Electrical Equipment and Components and Supplies;

h)	Other Equipment and Physical Equipment; and

i)	Reference materials/books.



--	Account titles in the RPCPPE were not compliant with GAM for NGAs, Volume III making it difficult to reconcile with the accounting records. The following are some of the account names used in RPCPPE that were not found in GAM Volume III:

a)	IT Equipment;

b)	IT Peripherals;

c)	School Vehicle;

d)	Other Machinery;

e)	Musical Instrument;

f)	Car tools;

g)	Car lift Equipment; and

h)	Marine Equipment.

--	The RPCPPEs were not accomplished following the instructions per GAM for NGAs Volume II:



a)	Date indicated on RPCPPEs of two units was the previous year, December 31, 2019

b)	Not prepared separately by fund cluster;

c)	Date of Assumption of the Accountable Officer is not indicated;

d)	Incomplete information on Description, Date of Acquisition, Property Numbers, Unit of Measure, Unit Value, and Quantity per Property Card.



--	An additional column for the Total Amount was provided in the RPCPPE. However, the figures indicated did not tally on the re-computed amount.



Due to the inconsistencies and constraints mentioned above the accuracy and completeness of the inventory report cannot be easily ascertained.



a)	Existence of unreconciled discrepancy of ₱745.04 million between the inventory report and PPE book balance



Section 491 of GAAM, Volume I, provides a brief outline of inventory taking. One of the points to be kept in mind while the inventory is being conducted is that all discrepancies between physical and book inventories must be investigated and cleared immediately. If necessary, written explanations shall be required from persons responsible. This regulation is reiterated under Section 53.b of GAAM Volume III which provides the accountability for the custody and use of an asset:



	Sec. 53.b. This standard further requires a comparison of recorded accountability with existing assets to determine whether the actual assets agree with the recorded accountability. Any discrepancy should be investigated in accordance with existing regulations and appropriate action taken thereon.



Comparison of the total PPE balance as of December 31, 2020 reported under RPCPPEs as against that of GLs revealed that there is an unreconciled difference of ₱745.04 million between these two records of the University. The discrepancy represents 42.83 per cent of the total PPE balance at year-end, as shown in the below:

		The RPCPPE amount of ₱994.59 million is the aggregated balance of PPEs appearing in the year-end inventory report of the colleges/campuses/units of the University including the current year’s acquisitions of the colleges/campuses/units without an inventory report for CY 2020. 



We also noted that the RPCPPEs were prepared by the inventory committee of each unit/campus/college but the reports were not consolidated to facilitate reconciliation with the PPE book balance. 



Accordingly, to have an estimate of the total PPEs most likely existing at year-end, the PPE acquisitions recorded in the GL during the year 2020 of the eight colleges without an updated year-end report and the PPE balance appearing in the 2019 RPCPPEs of the concerned campuses and units were considered. Reliability of the prior years' inventory reports, however, cannot be assured due to the occurrence of typhoons and other calamities that may affect the condition of some properties. 



		The above conditions affect the existence and completeness of the reported balance of the asset accounts. 



b)	Damaged and unserviceable properties costing at least ₱5.77 million were included in the PPE balance. 



Section 40.d, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, states that all unserviceable property shall be reported in the Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) (Appendix 74). PPE reported in the IIRUP shall be dropped from the books by debiting Impairment Loss-Property, Plant, and Equipment (cost of the PPE less Accumulated Depreciation). A. The IIRUP shall be prepared by the Supply and/or Property Unit as the basis to record dropping from the books the unserviceable properties carried in the PPE accounts.



Likewise, Section 41.b Chapter 10 of the same Manual provides that lost property and the related accumulated depreciation and impairment loss shall be derecognized in the books upon receipt of the Report of Lost, Stolen, Damaged, Destroyed Property (RLSDDP) (Appendix 75) supported by a Notice of Loss prepared and submitted by the Accountable Officer. The loss shall be charged to account "Loss of Assets" at an amount equal to its carrying amount. A. The RLSDDP form shall be prepared by the Accountable Officer to report or notify the auditor of the COA, the Chief Accountant, and all others concerned of the lost, stolen, damaged, or destroyed property.



Scrutiny of the year-end inventory report revealed that there were several unserviceable properties totaling ₱5.28 million, however, no impairment loss has been recorded to drop these items from the books. 



Also, based on the itemized list of unserviceable properties, there were IT equipment valued at ₱490,585 that were damaged during the fire incident on August 23, 2020 at the BU-Tabaco Campus Duplex 1 Building (Collaboration Building). Summary of the subject PPE accounts is presented in the table below:

There were also five buildings costing ₱4.80 million reported in the RPCPPE of BUTC that were labeled with “Total Rehabilitation”. It was not clear, however, whether these buildings are still being used by the campus or not. There was also no information on whether these were damaged due to typhoons that devastated the region during the last quarter of the year.



The Inventory Committee of BUTC was not able to notify the Audit Team of their year-end inventory taking as discussed in the AOM earlier issued. Likewise, the issue on non-filing of relief from property accountability on the damaged properties due to the fire incident was discussed on a separate AOM previously issued.



No entry has been made to record the above losses and unserviceable PPE items which implies that the corresponding IIRUP and RLSDDP have not been prepared by the responsible officials.



The foregoing lapses affect the fairness of the presentation of the PPE accounts at the year-end report.



c)	Non-preparation/maintenance of lapsing schedule for depreciation charges of all depreciable assets.



Sections 58 and 111 (1) of PD No. 1445 provide the following:



Section 58 of PD 1445. Audit of Assets. The examination and audit of assets shall be performed with a view to ascertaining their existence, ownership, valuation, and encumbrances as well as the propriety of items composing the respective assets accounts, determining their agreement with records; proving the accuracy of such records; ascertaining if the assets were utilized economically, efficiently and effectively; and evaluating the adequacy of controls over the accounts.



Section 111 (1) of PD 1445. Keeping of accounts. (1) The accounts of an agency shall be kept in such detail as is necessary to meet the needs of the agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or control agencies of the government.



Inquiry with the Accountant revealed that the depreciation on all depreciable properties was generated through the e-NGAS and the manual preparation of lapsing schedule was no longer prepared. The existing practice prevented the audit team to determine the correctness of the recorded depreciation expenses of the University especially on the newly acquired assets of the Agency.



Lapsing schedule for the depreciation of depreciable assets of the Agency serves as control or checking mechanism to substantiate the accuracy of the depreciation generated by the accounting system. Considering that entries to the e-NGAS are still prone to human error, complete and appropriate supporting schedules are needed to verify its correctness. 



		Prior year’s observation includes the non-recognition of depreciation expense for the account Infrastructure Assets-Power Supply Systems. A JEV was made on July 1, 2020, in compliance with the audit team's recommendation, however, the correctness of the recorded depreciation cannot be verified due to the absence of the lapsing schedule.



We recommended that Management:



a)	Direct the concerned Inventory Committees through their Deans/Directors to plan for the systematic conduct of inventory taking of assets under the new normal condition with prior notice to the Audit Team;



b)	Remind the Inventory Committees to adopt the prescribed format of RPCPPE and observe the instructions indicated under Appendix 73, GAM for NGAs, Volume II;



c)	Designate an employee to prepare a consolidated RPCPPE of the University to facilitate the reconciliation of PPE accounts between records maintained by the Supply and Accounting Offices;



d)	Require the Accountants and the SOs to reconcile any discrepancy noted between their records to enable them to adjust accordingly;



e)	Direct the concerned SO and AO to prepare and submit the required IIRUP and RLSDDP, respectively, to serve as basis in the derecognition of the unserviceable and lost/damaged PPE accounts; and 



f)	Instruct the Accountant to prepare and maintain the lapsing schedule of depreciation for all depreciable assets to check the accuracy of the computation of depreciation of PPEs per e-NGAS and submit the same to the Audit Team for verification.



Management Comment:



On May 28, 2021, BU Management, in its letter reply, commented that the generation of the PPE depreciation is embedded in the e-NGAS facility. The schedule of depreciation can be viewed on the aforesaid accounting system.



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



The depreciation schedule that may be generated from the e-NGAS does not provide specific details of PPE account included in the schedule. Hence, the lapsing schedule which provide information on the purchase date of specific PPE account is still necessary to check on the accuracy and completeness of the depreciation provided in the e-NGAS.





15. The University was not able to implement the procedures prescribed under COA Circular No. 2020-006 for the one-time cleansing of PPE accounts of Government Agencies.



		Appendix 73 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume II provides the form and instruction in the preparation and submission of the RPCPPE. The report shall be submitted to the Auditor concerned and Accounting Division/Unit not later than January 31 of each year.



COA Circular No. 2020-006 dated January 31, 2020, likewise prescribes the guidelines and procedures in the conduct of PPE, recognition of PPE items found at the station, and disposition for non-existing/missing PPE items, for the one-time cleansing of PPE accounts of government agencies.



Section 1 of the Circular provides the following rationale:



Property, Plant, and Equipment (PPE) generally constitute a significant portion of the total assets of the government, usually comprising more than fifty percent thereof.



The existence of enormous amounts of discrepancies in PPE account balances of government agencies has become a perennial issue and caused the non-establishment of the accuracy of the PPE balances presented in the financial statements. Such condition, if not properly addressed would always cause an exception in the fairness of presentation of the financial position of government agencies and will deprive the government of reliable and useful information in decision-making and accountability for these assets.



The Circular provides the general and procedural guidelines for the conduct of physical count as well as the disposition procedures for non-existing/missing PPEs and procedures in the derecognition of non-existing/missing PPEs without an available record of accountability.



			The following among others are the relevant provisions:



	1)	Each government agency shall conduct physical count of all its PPE, whether acquired through purchase or donation, including those constructed by administration and found at station.



5.2	The Head of the Agency shall create an Inventory Committee composed of adequate number of members to be able to complete the physical inventory in three months or less. The Inventory Committee shall have at least one member each from the Accounting and Property Division/Units of the agency.



5.3. The members of the Inventory Committee shall be temporarily relieved of all their regular duties to devote their full time in the conduct of physical inventory taking until the same is completed.



5.4	The entire inventory taking shall be witnessed by the Commission on Audit (COA) Auditor. The Audit Team Leader and/or any of his/her audit team members may be assigned for the purpose.



5.5	The Head of the Agency may also require a representative from the agency’s Internal Audit Service/Unit to witness the inventory taking.



5.6	Each government agency shall adopt a uniform property identification system for PPE wherein a unique Property Number shall be assigned for each PPE item, using the following numbering system:



0000 – 00 – 00 – 0000 – 00



Year Purchased

PPE sub-major account group

General Ledger Account

Serial number (one series per PPE category/type/location)

Location/Office

			

The codes for the PPE sub-major account group and General Ledger account correspond to those provided in the Revised Chart of Accounts prescribed under the Accounting Manuals of the respective Sectors (National, Local and Corporate).



Additional digits may be used for serial number and location/office, as necessary.	



Xxx



5.9	In coordination with the Property Division/Unit, the Inventory Committee shall plan/strategize on how to conduct and complete the physical inventory within the prescribed period. It shall prepare a Physical Inventory Plan (PIP) containing, at the least, the specific assignments/duties of the Committee members, the cut-off date, and a schedule specifying the dates and locations of the inventory taking activities from start-up to the targeted completion of the physical inventory.



5.10	The PIP shall be approved by the Head of the Agency.



5.11	The Inventory Committee shall submit the approved PIP to the COA Audit Team at least ten (10) calendar days before the scheduled start of inventory-taking activities.

	

Xxx



6.2.5	All PPE items counted shall be tagged with new property stickers containing the information provided under paragraph 5.7 of this Circular.



Xxx



6.3	Reconciliation of inventory count per RPCPPE with property and accounting records.

	

The Property and Accounting Units shall undertake collaborative procedures to ensure that all PPEs included in the RPCPPE are duly recorded in their respective records and that the Property Cards (PCs) maintained by the Property Unit and the PPELCs maintained by the Accounting Unit are reconciled. The reconciliation shall be completed within ten (10) days from rendition of the RPCPPE by the Inventory Committee. Xxx 



For CY 2020, as in prior years, the SOs, on behalf of the Inventory Committees, directly transmitted to the Audit Team their RCPPEs prepared for the campuses/colleges/units assigned under their jurisdiction with noted zero to 42 days delay. It was also observed that of the 13 SOs, four of them were not able to submit the report up to this time, as shown in table.

2)	SO2

3)	SO3

4)	SO4

BUCIT/BUCENG/ARKI



Further inquiry and validation revealed that no Inventory Committee created for every campuses/colleges/unit was able to avail the one-time cleansing of PPE account balances during the year based on the following observations:



a)	The Inventory Committee did not submit a PIP nor was any notice to the Audit Team for the conduct of physical count of PPE, hence, the Audit Team was unaware of the timing of the count made to be able to witness the inventory taking. 



b)	The prescribed new property identification system for PPE was not yet adopted.



c)	Existing PPE stickers were not yet replaced with the new property stickers with the prescribed property identification system.



d)	The submitted RPCPPE does not contain data on the actual location and condition of the properties.  Only the person with custody of the properties was indicated in the location/condition portion of the reports.



The above deficiencies caused difficulty in reconciling the total PPE reported in the financial statements which are composed of almost 60 per cent of the total assets as against those PPE found existing during the count. 



The foregoing situation showed non-compliance of the University with the above Circular which is not in keeping with the Commission’s mandate of helping government agencies to come up with reliable PPE balances that are verifiable as to the existence, condition, and accountability. Likewise, without the Audit Team witnessing the physical count and absence of data of the whereabouts and actual conditions of the properties in the submitted RPCPPE cast doubt whether actual inventory taking was indeed conducted.



We recommended and Management agreed to require the Inventory Committees, in coordination with the Property and Accounting Units, to conduct a one-time cleansing of PPE accounts following the prescribed procedures under COA Circular No. 2020-006 to be able to come up with reliable PPE balances. Thereafter, cause the submission of RPCPPE annually for all units and call the attention of those officials who continually not able to submit the mandated report. 





Infrastructure Projects



1)	Four infrastructure projects awarded to the same contractor showed overlapping contract implementation with the same key personnel assigned and equipment to be utilized. 



Section 23.6, Rule VIII of the 2016 Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (R-IRR) of Republic Act (RA) No. 9184 provides:



Notwithstanding the eligibility of a bidder, the Procuring Entity concerned reserves the right to review the qualifications of the bidder at any stage of the procurement process if the Procuring Entity has reasonable grounds to believe that a misrepresentation has been made by the said bidder, or that there has been a change in the bidder's capability to undertake the project from the time it submitted its eligibility requirements. Should such review uncover any misrepresentation made in the eligibility requirements, statements or documents, or any changes in the situation of the bidder which will affect the capability of the bidder to undertake the project so that it fails the eligibility criteria, the Procuring Entity shall consider the said bidder as ineligible and shall disqualify it from obtaining an award or contract, in accordance with Rules XXI, XXII, and XXIII of this IRR.



Section 34.3, Rule X of the same IRR also provides:



The post-qualification shall verify, validate, and ascertain all statements made and documents submitted by the bidder with the Lowest Calculated Bid/Highest Rated Bid, using non-discretionary criteria, as stated in the Bidding Documents.  These criteria shall consider, but shall not be limited to, the following:

xxx



		a)	Technical Requirements. To determine compliance of the goods, infrastructure projects, or consulting services offered with the requirements specified in the Bidding Documents, including, where applicable:



			i)	Verification and validation of the bidder's stated competence and experience, and the competence and expertise of the bidder's key personnel to be assigned to the project, for the procurement of Infrastructure Projects and Consulting Services;



			ii)	Verification of availability and commitment, and/or inspection and testing of the required capacities and operating conditions, of equipment units to be owned/leased/under purchase by the bidder for use in the contract under bidding, xxx



Verification of infrastructure projects implemented in CY 2020 revealed that four projects were awarded to the same contractor, one of which is under a joint venture with another contractor, as follows:

Gleaned from the table above, the Audit Team noted that one contractor was awarded four projects with an overlapping period of implementation. It was further noted that aside from those four projects, the contractor has two ongoing projects with the University which were supposed to be finished in CY 2019 but were only completed in June 2020, hence, also coincided with the implementation of the four awarded contracts. Below are the details of those two projects.

Further, scrutiny of the documents and analysis of the attached sales invoices, official receipts, deed of sale, and lease agreements for the equipment whether owned or leased by the contractor revealed that the contractor’s available equipment was not sufficient to implement the projects at the same time. The List of Equipment, Owned or Leased and/or under Purchase Agreements, pledged to the proposed contracts were almost the same for all the projects awarded, as follows:

As can be seen from the table, four units of equipment were pledged to more than one project with an overlapping period of implementation. Worthy to note is the distance of the location of these projects. BUCAF is approximately 50 km from BU East Campus and 38 km from BUTC, while BU East Campus is approximately 30 km from BUTC, hence, could cause a delay in the implementation of projects considering the limited equipment and the distance of the location of the projects.



Based on the inspection conducted, the Audit Team noted that all of the four projects were already delayed in implementation. The table below shows the noted observations during the inspection.



Infrastructure Projects

Date Inspected

Observations

A)	Rehabilitation of Academic Building (Animal Science Building) at BUCAF

January 22, 2021

Work still ongoing and near completion. Ahead of schedule per revised target date of completion of February 25, 2021, as indicated in the Reports of Government PPA. However, based on variation order additional workdays given was 75 CD, hence from the original date of completion of September 7, 2020, the revised target date of completion should be November 21, 2020, and not February 25, 2021, as reported. Thus, project implementation was already delayed.



B)	Rehabilitation /Improvement of BUTC Gymnasium 

February 8, 2021

No personnel working and no equipment inside the gymnasium. The condition inside suggested that work has not been done for quite some time. Apparently, the contractor is not committed to fast-track the work despite the delay incurred. 88 CD behind schedule as of the date of inspection. 



C)	Rehabilitation of Industrial Technology Building



February 18, 2021

Work ongoing and 97.10% completed. 52 CD behind schedule as of the date of inspection

D)	Completion of Electrical Engineering Building

February 18, 2021

Work ongoing and 94.72% completed. 34 CD behind schedule as of the date of inspection.



As prescribed in the aforementioned regulation, verification of the availability and commitment, and/or inspection and testing for the required capacities and operating conditions, of equipment units to be owned/leased is an important procedure in the post-qualification process. The Agency should take emphasis on these standard procedures so as not to incur similar issues upon awarding of contracts to prospective bidders. 



Setting aside the aforementioned deficiencies, the University could have disqualified the contractor due to unsatisfactory performance in the previous projects. Prior to the award of contracts, the contractor was already in default in the implementation of the two projects with the University. This deficiency was included in the previous year’s AOM in which BU Management agreed on the imposition of liquidated damages. Despite the inability of the contractor to satisfactorily complete the projects on time, he was still awarded four additional projects with a coinciding period of implementation.



Due to the aforementioned deficiencies in the post-qualification process, all four contracts were awarded to the same contractor whose capability is not enough to satisfactorily perform the work, as such, resulted in delayed implementation of all the four projects.

 

Had the post-qualification of the contractors been done carefully in accordance with the regulation, the Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) particularly the Technical Working Group (TWG) could have noticed that the contractors' personnel to be assigned and equipment to be utilized were almost the same for all the projects awarded to them. The lack of personnel to supervise the simultaneous implementation of the projects and the insufficiency of the contractors' equipment resulted in the delayed completion of said projects, depriving the agency of the benefits from using the same at the earliest time. 



We recommended that Management:



	a)	Direct the BAC and its TWG to carefully examine the contractor’s manpower and equipment on all the projects to be awarded and not on an individual project only in case the contractor is the lowest bidder in several projects which have the same or overlapping period of implementation; 



	b)	Require contractors to augment their manpower and/or equipment to be utilized in the projects awarded to them which have the same or overlapping period of implementation, otherwise, disqualify them from obtaining several contracts in accordance with the provisions of Section 23.6 of the 2016 IRR of RA No. 9184; and



	c)	Require the contractor to complete the projects as soon as possible and impose liquidated damages for the unperformed works.



Management Comment:



Management commented in its letter dated March 16, 2021 that they do not have any objective and non-discretionary basis as to the number of projects where the same professionals and equipment shall be used to warrant disqualification.



In case of delay in the implementation of infrastructure projects, they usually undertake, among others, the following post-award activities as a requirement in the catch-up plan:



a)		Require the contractors to augment their laborers, not the professionals;

b)		Require the contractors to augment their minor tools, not the major equipment as provided for in the checklist of equipment requirement; and

c)		Emphasize on the imposition of liquidated damages.



The BAC has also been very strict on the requirement of Section 34.3a which states that should there be a negative slippage of at least 15 per cent in any one project, or a negative slippage of at least 10 per cent in each of the two or more projects, then the bid submission will automatically be disqualified. Also, they continue to rely on the interpretation that any changes in the situation of the bidder can be managed in the contract implementation stage because of the Net Financial Contracting Capacity (NFCC) which is a way beyond the required capacity, and that nay contractor would as far as practicable; avoid delay because of the imposition of liquidated damages.



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



The Audit Team recognizes the issue stated by BAC on the absence of a clear standard to be used on the basis of available key personnel and equipment in disqualifying the bidder with existing project with the agency at the time of the post-qualification. However, they are not precluded in recommending to the Head of the Procuring Entity the disqualification of a bidder due to its unsatisfactory performance and constant delays in the bidder’s previous projects with the University. 



It is reminded that procurement process in the government should promote efficiency to afford completion of projects and delivery of services at the most opportune time.  





2)	Six infrastructure projects with an aggregate cost of ₱132.94 million remained unfinished. 



		Annex E of the 2016 R-IRR of RA No. 9184 is the contract implementation guidelines for the procurement of infrastructure projects. The pertinent provisions of Section 8 thereof are quoted as follows:



8.1  Where the contractor refuses or fails to satisfactorily complete the work within the specified contract time, plus any time extension duly granted and is hereby in default under the contract, the contractor shall pay the procuring entity for liquidated damages, and not by way of penalty, an amount, as provided in the conditions of contract, equal to at least one-tenth (1/10) of one (1) percent of the cost of the unperformed portion of the works for every day of delay.

	xxx



8.4 In case that the delay in the completion of the work exceeds a time duration equivalent to ten percent (10%) of the specified contract time plus any time extension duly granted to the contractor, the procuring entity concerned may rescind the contract, forfeit the contractor's performance security and take over the prosecution of the project or award the same to a qualified contractor through negotiated contract.



8.5 In no case, however, shall the total sum of liquidated damages exceed ten percent (10%) of the total contract price, in which event the contract shall automatically be taken over by the procuring entity concerned or award the same to a qualified contractor through negotiation and the erring contractor's performance security shall be forfeited. The amount of the forfeited performance security shall be aside from the amount of the liquidated damages that the contractor shall pay the government under the provisions of this clause and impose other appropriate sanctions.



Verification of Infrastructure Projects implemented in CY 2020 disclosed that six infrastructure projects were not completed within the contract duration. Details are as follows:

*Revised contract duration/target date of completion



The preceding table indicated that the contractors of the six ongoing infrastructure projects were already in default, thus, they are required to pay liquidated damages equivalent to at least one-tenth of one per cent of the cost of the unperformed portion of the works for every day of delay due to their failure to satisfactorily complete within the specified contract time.



It also showed that the contractors already incurred a significant number of days delayed which far exceeded the 10 per cent of the specified contract time. However, the procuring entity did not rescind the contract, forfeit the contractor’s performance security and take over the prosecution of the project, or award the same to a qualified contractor through negotiated contract. There was also no information whether the officials in-charge with the project implementation has taken action to call up the attention of the contractors prior to the expected completion date of those projects. 



The above-noted deficiencies manifest Management’s laxity and inability to closely monitor the project implementation and enforce the completion of the project within the contract duration. Moreover, non-application of remedies provided for in the procurement law resulted in the further delay of the completion of the subject infrastructure projects, thus, deprived the intended user/beneficiaries of the immediate use of the structures. 



Although, face-to-face classes are not yet allowed during these times, it would be beneficial that these facilities will be ready for occupancy when the present condition returns to the new normal. 



We recommended that Management direct the Project Engineer in charge of the University projects to determine the unperformed work as of the target date of completion of the aforementioned projects, prepare the corresponding inspection report and impose the appropriate liquidated damages. Further, consider the remedies provided under Section 8.1 Annex E of the R-IRR of RA No. 9184 to fast-track the completion of the projects with significant delays.  



Management Comment:



In the letter dated April 8, 2021, the Physical Development and Management Office cited that two of the projects have been 100 per cent completed as of February 18, 2021, namely, (1) Rehabilitation of BU College of Industrial Technology Building and (2) Refurbishment of Daraga Campus Administration Building (Formerly International House). For the remaining four projects, the respective contractors did not abandon their respective projects but are actually waiting for delivery of required equipment/furniture for installation on the buildings due to difficulties on delivery as offshoot of COVID-19 restrictions on travel and international trade.



		They commit to strictly impose liquidated damages every day of the delay on the uncompleted portions of the contract. Termination of their contracts and procurement of uncompleted portion of the project would only cause further delay in the completion of the projects as new contractors would encounter the same transport/delivery problems.





3)	Termination and forfeiture of performance security, and adoption of remedies provided by RA No. 9184 were not made on four infrastructure contracts in CY 2017 aggregating ₱3.86 million which remain unimplemented to date. 



Section 39 of the 2016 R-IRR of RA No. 9184 or the Government Procurement Reform Act provides that to guarantee the faithful performance by the winning bidder of its obligations under the contract in accordance with the bidding documents, it shall post performance security prior to the signing of the contract. Accordingly, this security shall be forfeited consequent to the default of the contractor to carry out in any of its obligations under the Contract. 



Annex E of the same Act provides for the contract implementation guidelines for infrastructure projects which states among others that in case that the delay in the completion of the work exceeds a time duration equivalent to ten percent (10%) of the specified contract time plus any time extension duly granted to the contractor, the procuring entity concerned may rescind the contract, forfeit the contractor's performance security and take over the prosecution of the project or award the same to a qualified contractor through negotiated contract. (Section 8.4, Annex E)

                 

Our validation of the Agency Action Plan and Status of Implementation (AAPSI) as of December 31, 2020 disclosed that there were four projects in CY 2017 that remain unimplemented yet no information as to its contract termination and forfeiture of performance security has been communicated by the University Management:

Note: * - contract including its attachments not submitted for review



		The validity of the posted surety bond is effective until issuance by the University of the certificate of final acceptance in accordance with Section 39, R-IRR of RA No. 9184.



		Management had previously commented that a thorough review and evaluation of the foregoing projects had been conducted. Also, the University, through its Physical Development and Management Office allegedly had instituted the necessary measures to cause the termination of the contract and upon proper grounds shall duly impose the forfeiture of the contractor’s performance security.

Pending the submission of documents as proof that the above-enumerated projects have been duly terminated with forfeiture of security, as warranted, the status of implementation of the prior year's recommendation remains unimplemented. 



The continued delay in enforcing the University’s right to demand the termination of the subject contracts and forfeiture of the performance security does not promote faithful compliance of obligations and timely implementation of the project by the contractors. 

	 

We reiterated that Management:



a)	Cause the immediate termination of the contract and forfeit the contractor's performance security following Annex I of the 2016 Revised IRR of RA 9184; and

 

b)	Adopt the procedures for the suspension or blacklisting of contractors, etc. under Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB) guidelines as a form of administrative penalties to the concerned bidders imposed under Section 69 of the same Act.



Management Comment:



During the virtual exit conference held last May 25, 2021, Management informed the Audit Team that the contracts of the subject four projects had been terminated already. Pertinent documents relating thereto shall be transmitted to the Office of the Audit Team.





Accounts Payable



4)	A net discrepancy of ₱62.00 million between Accounts Payable per GL and unpaid obligations under due and demandable in the Financial Accountability Reports (FARs) balances at year end due to unrecorded obligations, rendering the account inaccurate and unreliable. 



		IPSAS No. 1 prescribes the manner in which general purpose financial statements should be presented to ensure comparability both with the entity’s financial statements of previous periods and with the financial statements of other entities. To achieve this objective, the Standard sets out overall considerations for the presentation of financial statements, guidance for their structure, and minimum requirements for the content of financial statements prepared under the accrual basis of accounting. (Emphasis ours)



Accrual basis means a basis of accounting under which transactions and other events are recognized when they occur (and not only when cash or its equivalent is received or paid).  (Par. 7 IPSAS 1)



COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2019-1 dated January 1, 2019 was issued to prescribe modified formats for the budget and financial accountability reports (BFARs), as earlier prescribed under COA-DBM Joint Cir. No. 2014-1 dated July 2, 2014, and revised submission timelines.



		Under Item 5 of COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2014-1, the responsibilities of the officials concerned are provided, to wit:



	5.0  The BFARs shall be prepared and certified correct by the following officials:



5.1.1. Budget Officer/Head of Budget Unit – for the portion of the report pertaining to appropriations, allotments, obligations, unpaid obligations-not yet due and demandable and unobligated allotments.   



5.1.12 Chief Accountant/Head of Accounting Unit – for the portion of the report pertaining to the disbursement and unpaid obligations – due and demandable.



		Our verification of FAR No. 1-A (Statement of Allotment, Obligations, Disbursements and Balances-SAAODB) for Current and Continuing Appropriations and FAR No. 2-A (Statement of Approved Budget, Utilizations, Disbursements and Balances-SABUDB) for internally generated fund disclosed that the total balance of unpaid obligations-due and demandable obligations do not reconcile with the related GLs of Accounts Payable. The table below shows the summary.

(₱ 62,004,153.99) 

		Based on the preceding table, the Due and Demandable Obligations-Accounts Payable reported under FAR Nos. 1-A, 2-A is significantly higher by at least ₱62.00 million or 191 per cent more than the amount of Accounts Payable recognized in the books of accounts.



		Further, we observed during the early part of the year that several paid vouchers included under prior year’s FAR and reported under due and demandable obligations were recorded using Accumulated Surplus/Deficit account, hence, directly affects the Government Equity account as prior period adjustments. 



Management, in its update on the status of implementation of prior year’s audit recommendation, explained that the foregoing variance was due to timing differences in the recording. The recorded Accounts Payable by the Accounting Unit in the eNGAs system was based on the received DVs together with its supporting documents not yet paid on its cut-off date at year-end report. Those due and demandable unpaid obligations, with DVs and its supporting documents not yet received by Accounting Section at cut-off date were no longer considered in the year-end report. Hence, the unrecorded obligations at year-end by the University. 



The existing practice resulted in the continued discrepancy of the payable account between the books and the FAR, hence, renders the account inaccurate and unreliable. It is also contrary to the basic requirements for financial reporting required by the above-stated accounting standards.



We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief Accountant to:



a)	Review and reconcile the amounts of expenditures, disbursements and unpaid obligations recorded in the books with the information presented under the financial accountability reports and book-up the obligations; and



b)	Set a synchronized cut-off date with the Budget Sections on their receipt of DVs to be recorded to minimize the existence of discrepancy between their records.  





Due to Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR)



5)	Due to BIR year-end account balance of ₱36.43 million cannot be relied upon due to: a) existence of prior year’s outstanding balance of ₱18.33 million representing unremitted taxes withheld under the General Fund that should have been covered by a tax remittance advice (TRA); b) unreconciled difference of ₱51.42 million between the TRA reported under FAR 4 and per GL; and c) non-submission of pertinent documents to record the constructive remittance of taxes through TRA.



Section 7 of BIR Revenue Regulation No. 1-2013 dated January 23, 2013, specifically mandates NGAs to electronically file all tax returns observing the due dates prescribed in the table presented therein. Payment of the tax due must also be made on the same day the return is e-filed by accomplishing online the TRA. The use of eTRA as payment is limited only to the NGAs’ tax liabilities arising from the use of funds coming from the DBM. NGAs’ tax liabilities arising from the use of funds other than those coming from DBM based on the NGAs Annual Budget as approved under the General Appropriation Act (GAA) must be paid using cash through the bank debit system of the authorized agent bank (AAB) where the NGA shall enroll for this purpose.



Revenue Memorandum Circular (RMC) No. 57-2014 likewise provides that Monthly Remittance Return of Income Taxes Withheld on Compensation, Creditable Income Taxes, and Final Income Taxes be filed and paid on or before the 10th day of the following month in which withholding was made, except for taxes withheld for the month of December of each year, which shall be filed on or before January 15 of the succeeding year. While the Monthly Remittance Return on VAT and Other Percentage Taxes withheld is on or before the 10th day of the month following the month in which withholding was made.

The unremitted balance for CY 2020 refers to the taxes withheld in December 2020 that are due for remittance in January 2021.



It can be gathered from the preceding data that despite the previous year’s recommendation on full remittance of taxes withheld, 60.62 per cent or ₱27.21 million of taxes withheld from prior years remain outstanding at year-end. Breakdown of the outstanding balance from prior years by fund cluster is presented below:

Based on the above data, a significant portion of the outstanding prior years’ balance of unremitted taxes pertains to General Fund that could have been paid through e-TRA. Verily, there may be prior years’ tax remittance not yet taken up in the books though a number of similar adjustments had already been recorded in CY 2020. 



The correctness of the foregoing balance of Due to BIR account cannot be easily verified due to the following:



a)	The University does not record its receipt of TRA and/or constructive receipt of Notice of Cash Allocation. 



It was revealed that the account Subsidy from National Government Agency is directly credited for every constructive remittance of tax withheld made. This may be due to the absence of the account Cash – TRA in the list of accounts available in the existing e-NGAS of the University. Accordingly, the Constructive Receipt of NCA for TRA and Remittance of Taxes thru TRA were not included in the Statement of Cash Flows of the University. Relevant information pertaining to this transaction was also not disclosed in the Notes to Financial Statement.



b)	The recorded tax remittance using TRA for the current year cannot be reconciled with the TRA reported under the Monthly Report of Disbursements (FAR 4) at year-end:



Report/Record

 ₱ 51,418,668.14



c)	The accounts including its supporting documents such as the statement of tax withheld and copies of TRA for this non-cash transaction were not submitted for verification to the Audit Team. 



Consequently, the accuracy of the year-end balance of the subject inter-agency payable account cannot be easily determined. Also, the continued existence of prior year's outstanding balances in all funds shows non-observance of prompt remittance of taxes withheld contrary to RMC No. 57-2014 and deprived the national government of the immediate use of tax revenues needed to finance its priority projects.







We recommended that Management:



a)	Direct the Finance Office to reconcile the noted difference of TRA between the books and the accountability report;



b)	Require the Accountants to examine the correctness of the reported outstanding balances of Due to BIR account, prepare adjustments, when necessary, and furnish the audit team with its copy duly supported with attachments for verification;



c)	Provide disclosure in the Notes to Financial Statement for information on the constructive remittance of withheld taxes made for the year;



d)	Order the immediate remittance of overdue taxes withheld totaling ₱36.43 million otherwise be held liable under Section 255 of National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) with penalties and charges prescribed in Annex A of Revenue Memo Order (RMO) No. 7-2015; and



e)	See to it that taxes are withheld and remitted within the deadline set by pertinent BIR rules and regulations.



Management Comment:



BU Management informed the Audit Team, in its letter dated May 26, 2021, that all taxes withheld for CY 2020 was remitted on due date and posted to date. The corresponding JEV can be viewed in the e-NGAS facility.



Also, review of the aforesaid SL accounts will be made so that appropriate adjusting entries may be prepared.





Due to Government Service Insurance System (GSIS)



6)	Premiums of the officials and employees of the University that are due to the GSIS were not remitted promptly. 



		Section 14 of the R-IRR of RA No. 8291 provides that each government agency shall remit directly to the GSIS the employees’ and government agency’s contributions within the first ten (10) days of the calendar month following the month to which the contributions apply. The remittance by the government agency of the contributions to the GSIS shall take priority over and above the payment of any and all obligations, except salaries and wages of its employees. More so, the agency is obliged to deduct from the fixed monthly compensation of the employee the loan amortizations due the GSIS. These amounts are then required to be remitted to the GSIS within the first ten days of the calendar month following the month when these deductions were effected.

		

Review and analysis of the related GL of Due to GSIS account revealed the following information:

		As presented in the table above, only 2.35 per cent or ₱43,490 out of the ₱1.85 million were remitted for prior years’ GSIS contributions and loan amortizations, thus, leaving an unremitted balance of ₱1.81 million.



On the other hand, 93.34 per cent or ₱67.20 million out of ₱71.98 million were remitted for the total GSIS contributions and loan repayments withheld in CY 2020, also leaving an unremitted balance of ₱4.78 million at year-end. Out of the unremitted balance from current year transactions, ₱3.40 million pertains to premium payments and amortizations in December 2020 that is due for remittance in January 2021. Accordingly, the difference of ₱1.39 million pertains to current year transactions that have further increased the payable accounts prior year's outstanding balance to ₱3.20 million, computed as follows:

The continuous delay in the remittance by Management of the premium contributions and/or loan payments does not only disregard the GSIS law but also deprives its officers and employees of the benefits due them, such as dividends that may be earned from the total premiums. The affected member-employee shall also incur undue loan arrearages that will affect his/her loan privileges and retirement benefits from GSIS. 



We recommended that Management remit in full the amounts due to the GSIS without further delay.  Strictly comply with Section 14 of the R-IRR of RA No. 8291 for the timely remittances of premium contributions as well as members’ loan amortizations to avoid interests and penal sanction imposed under Section 52 of the Act.



Management Comment:



On May 28, 2021, Management transmitted its letter reply informing the Audit Team that the GSIS premium contributions as well as loan amortizations pertaining to CY 2020 have been posted to date. The subject JEV may be viewed in the e-NGAS facility of the University.





7)	The subsidiary ledger for GSIS Policy Loan showed an abnormal balance of ₱22,998 as of December 31, 2020.



Revised Chart of Accounts (Updated 2019) prescribed under COA Circular No. 2020-001 dated January 8, 2020 describe the Due to GSIS as the account credited to recognize the withholding of employees’ premium payments and other payables for remittance to the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS). This account is debited for the remittance of withheld amount, and/or adjustments.



		Verification of the SL under the account, Due to GSIS showed that the balance under Regular Funds (FC01) as of December 31, 2020, amounted to ₱6.57 million broken down as follows:

It could be noted that the balance under the subsidiary account, Policy Loan had a negative or abnormal balance of ₱22,998. This condition is indicative of an error committed in accounting for the withholding and remittance of policy loan amortizations, thus, cast doubt as to the correctness and reliability of the account balance in the Financial Statements.



We recommended and Management agreed that the Accountant review the related transactions that resulted in the negative balance of ₱22,998 under the Policy Loan account and prepare the appropriate adjustment to correct the balance of the Due to GSIS account.



Management Comment:



Management commented in its letter reply received on May 28, 2021 that appropriate adjusting entries pertaining to Policy Loan account will be prepared after the review of the aforesaid SL account.





Due to Pag-IBIG



8)	The year-end balance of Due to Pag-IBIG still includes 53.77 per cent of the prior year's contributions and/or loan amortizations and unreconciled subsidiary records with abnormal balances totaling ₱89,179 that have been in existence for over two to five years. 



		Section 2 of RA No. 9679 states that it is the policy of the State to establish, develop, promote, and integrate a nationwide sound and viable tax-exempt mutual provident savings system suitable to the needs of the employed and other earning groups, and to motivate them to better plan and provide for their housing needs, by membership in the Home Development Mutual Fund (HDMF), with mandatory contributory support of the employers in the spirit of social justice and the pursuit of national development.



		Section 23 of the same Act provides pertinent guidelines in the remittance of contributions, some of these are enumerated below:



a)	It shall be the duty of every employer, private or public, to set aside and remit the contributions required under this Act in accordance with a mechanism determined by the Board of Trustees.



b)	Every employer required to set aside and remit such contributions as prescribed under this Act shall be liable for their payment, and non-payment shall further subject the employer to a penalty of three percent (3%) per month of the amounts payable from the date the contributions fall due until paid.



c)	It shall be mandatory and compulsory for all government instrumentalities, agencies, including government-owned and controlled corporations, to provide the payment of contributions in their annual appropriations. Penal sanctions shall be imposed upon these employers who fail to include the payment of contributions on time or delay the remittance of the required contributions to the Fund. The heads of offices and agencies shall be administratively liable for non-remittance of the required contributions to the Fund.



Accordingly, HDMF issued its Circular No. 275 dated January 22, 2010, prescribing the implementing guidelines on employer registration, contribution, and remittance under RA No. 9679. Section E.4 of the same Circular provides the remittance schedules depending on the first letter of the employer's name. It also states that the employer shall be charged a penalty equivalent to 1/10 of 1% per day of delay of the amount due starting on the first day immediately following the due date until the date of full settlement. Based on this guideline, the University’s due date of remittance falls on the 10th to 14th day of the month following the period covered.



Review of the GL for the Due to Pag-IBIG account for all funds revealed that the total amount of ₱430,380 remained unremitted as of December 31, 2020. The details are presented as follows:

			d)	Total current year’s remittance to HDMF of ₱14.59 million is 98.67 per cent of the total current year’s contributions and/or amortization of ₱14.78 million, hence, leaving a balance of ₱198,961 at year-end.



The Audit Team had already requested for a photocopy of the remittances made in January 2021 to the Mutual Fund covering the contributions and loan amortizations withheld in December 2020. As of this writing, however, Management has not yet complied.



Inability of the employer to pay and remit the contributions and loan amortizations as stated by the aforementioned circular shall not prejudice the right of the members to the benefits under the fund. However, the responsible personnel of the University will be held personally liable for any penalties to be imposed due to the delay incurred.



We recommended that Management require the Finance Officer to review the existence and correctness of the Due to Pag-IBIG account to effect the necessary adjustments to the account and to immediately remit in full the verified employees and employer’s contributions and loan amortizations to Pag-IBIG. Henceforth, remit all contributions and loan repayments on time to avoid penalties.













Management Comment:



On May 28, 2021, Management transmitted its letter reply informing the audit team that the HDMF remittances pertaining to CY 2020 have been posted to date. The subject JEV may be viewed in the e-NGAS facility of the University.



Also, the balances reflected in the SLs of the HDMF account were forwarded unreconciled balances from previous Accounting records. Reconciliation is being done by the Accounting Section to ensure that all deductions and contributions to HDMF are properly accounted for.





Due to PhilHealth





9)	Prior year's contributions constitute 79.46 per cent of the unremitted balance of Due to PhilHealth account as of December 31, 2020.

 

		Section 2 of the R-IRR of RA No. 10606 seeks to attain the objectives of the Act which are to (a) Provide all citizens of the Philippines with the mechanism to gain financial access to health services; (b) Establish the Program to serve as the means to help the people pay for health care services; and, (c) Prioritize and accelerate the provision of health services to all Filipinos, especially that segment of the population who cannot afford these services.



Likewise, Section 11 of the same Act provides that the remittance of contribution shall be mandatory for all members. It shall be made to PhilHealth offices or any of the accredited collecting agents. Failure to timely remit the appropriate premium contribution shall be subject to interest and penalties as prescribed by the Corporation without prejudice to other applicable penalties herein provided. 



Further, Section 18 (b) and (d) thereof states that the monthly premium contribution of employed members shall be remitted by the employer on or before the date prescribed by the Corporation. The failure of the employer to remit the required contribution and to submit the required remittance list shall make the employer liable for reimbursement of payment of a properly filed claim in case the concerned employee or dependent/s avails of Program benefits, without prejudice to the imposition of other penalties as provided for in this Rules.

The following observations can be generated from the above table:



a)	The beginning balance of ₱125 under the Business Type Income (Fund 06) has been recurring since December 2018. A remittance of ₱413 was recorded in February 2020, resulting in an over-remittance of ₱288. However, this remittance pertained to CY 2019 contributions.

b)	Prior years' remittance recorded only 6.35 per cent or ₱34,628 of the total prior years balance of ₱0.55 million. 



c)	Current year’s contributions and remittance in the amounts of ₱6.39 million and ₱6.26 million yielded 98 per cent remittance, leaving a balance of ₱131,905. 



d)	It disclosed that the bulk of unremitted contributions constitutes 79.46 per cent from prior years and 20.54 per cent from the current year, presented below:

Detailed analysis disclosed that the foregoing balances pertain to the PhilHealth contributions of employees under contract of service and/or job order. 



While the monthly contributions of the permanent employees have been regularly remitted during month-end, remittance for the non-regular employees are usually not made on time, hence, the accumulated balance of account Due to PhilHealth at year-end. 

The foregoing deficiencies may affect the health care benefits due the concerned PhilHealth member.



We recommended that Management:



a)	Conduct analysis and tracing on available records to determine the actual unremitted contributions of individual personnel and record adjustments, when necessary;

	

b)	Remit immediately all outstanding PhilHealth premiums deducted from the concerned employees, when identified, otherwise remit the excess and unidentified premiums to the Bureau of the Treasury; and



c)	Comply with Section 11 of the R-IRR of RA 10606 for the timely remittances of health premium contributions. 



Management Comment:	



Management commented in its letter dated May 11, 2021 that the prior year’s balances reflected in the subsidiary ledgers of Due to PhilHealth account are due to inherited unreconciled subsidiary records. Also, the remittance of PhilHealth balance pertaining to CY 2020 transactions had been posted as of the date of their reply and can be viewed in the e-NGAS facility.



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



It is the responsibility of the present Management to ensure that all the premiums and contributions be duly accounted and remitted to the PhilHealth in order to support the health care system of the members. Reconciliation and efforts to locate pertinent records of prior year balances must be undertaken before Management decides to remit the unidentified premiums to the National Treasury.





Due to NGAs



10)	The University’s provision of technical assistance in collaboration with the Department of Social Welfare and Development Field Office V (DSWD FOV) under its Skills Training Program for the Pantawid Pamilya beneficiaries with funding of more than ₱313.02 million was not fully attained. 



Section 2 of PD No. 1445 states that:



It is the declared policy of the State that all resources of the government shall be managed, expended or utilized in accordance with law and regulations, and safeguard against loss or wastage through illegal or improper disposition, with a view to ensuring efficiency, economy, and effectiveness in the operations of government. The responsibility to take care that such policy is faithfully adhered to rest directly with the chief or head of agency concerned.

		The Sustainable Livelihood Program (SLP), one of the core programs of DSWD, is a community-based capacity-building program that seeks to improve the program participants' socio-economic status. Its main objective is to improve the socio-economic capacity of the poor to enhance access to basic social services and improve their standard of living. 



In November 2017, the DSWD FOV tapped the services of the Bicol University and entered into a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with the University to provide technical education and skills training to Pantawid Pamilya beneficiaries to develop and empower them through livelihood opportunities.	

	

The skills training is one of the assistances provided under SLP. As indicated in the approved proposal, the BU, through its Extension and Management Division (EMD), colleges, and units, will provide skills training including the starting/training kits to SLP beneficiaries under the Microenterprise Development (MD) Track and Employment Facilitation (EF) Track. Some of these projects include the provision of the Employment Assistance Fund (EAF) to entitled participants. 



Initially, the amount transferred to BU was ₱280.10 million, then in February 2018 additional fund was transferred for the same purpose amounting to ₱32.92 million, or a total of ₱313.02 million. 



Almost three years after the subject fund transfers, the Status of Implementation and Utilization as of December 31, 2020, disclosed very marginal accomplishments on the training conducted as summarized below:

Out of 26,803 intended beneficiaries, only 4,509 individuals, or 16.82 per cent have been provided skills training. The lack of target participants including the cancellation and non-implementation of the required skills training deprived 22,294 or 83.18 per cent of the intended beneficiaries of the benefits that could have been derived from the project.



		As reflected in the submitted report, the causes of delay in the implementation of skills training were due to lack of participants, challenges encountered on procurement in bulk, delayed submission of complete project proposals to DSWD FOV needed in the completion of the Project Procurement and Management Plans (PPMP), the occurrence of weather disturbance and the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, the approval of the request for extension of the project took a long time and some have a low approved budget cost allotted per training. Another factor was the occurrence of Bird flu and African Swine Flu which affected the skills training program that involves chicken and hog farming/production, thus, its procurement process was suspended. There were also issues on unreleased training materials, meal, and transportation allowances for those trainings conducted by the University.



		Training programs where targeted participants are no longer interested as per assessment of the Provincial Coordinators and Development Officers are considered cancelled projects. This happened apparently due to their long wait for the training to push through that they opted out of the training course because of conflicting schedules while some have already gone out of the region to work.

It can be gleaned from the preceding table that only 6.03 per cent from ₱313.02 million was utilized since its actual project implementation in CY 2018. Despite the existing approved extension of the program implementation up to the end of December 2020, the status of the required deliverable is very low. 



Management informed the Audit Team that their request for another extension of the project implementation up to December 31, 2021, is still in process.

		The foregoing status of implementation and cited conditions appeared that the objective of the program, which is to improve the socio-economic conditions of the poor, vulnerable, and disadvantaged household in the region is not attained, thereby depriving the beneficiaries of the benefits they could have enjoyed had the required skills training and the starting kits have been provided on time. 



We recommended that Management secure first the approval of the requested extension of the project implementation from the Source Agency, otherwise, immediately return the much-needed fund for other priority projects of the government. When approved, the following action must be undertaken:



a)	Require the project implementers to immediately review and re-assess the feasibility of those unimplemented projects as to the level of interest and willingness of the member/beneficiaries to continue and sustain the chosen project under the new normal setting, availability of the training materials within the locality, as well as the sufficiency of the allocated funds for the project; 

 

b)	Refund the corresponding cost of skills training for projects identified as canceled and no longer viable to continue; and



c)	Direct the monitoring team to regularly visit and inspect the implementation of the program to ensure that its execution is still in line with the program’s objective and within the proposed final timelines.



Management Comment:



In the letter dated May 18, 2021 of the OIC Director of BU-EMD, she stated the following comments:



	a)	The request for extension dated March 11, 2021 has been granted approval by DSWD FOV until December 2021.



	b)	The Source Agency has already conducted review and reassessment on the feasibility of the unimplemented projects as to the level of interest and willingness of the member/beneficiaries, thus a total of 80 project proposals were reviewed, revised and forwarded to the EMD for inclusion in the 2021 project implementation. Said proposals were already included in the submitted Project Procurement Management Plan for 2021.



	c)	The refund for the cost of skills training identified as cancelled is already in process. Its corresponding voucher amounting to ₱13,610,270.85 is already with the Accounting Office. Bank Reconciliation is still on-going that could revise the said amount to be refunded through the National Treasury.



	d)	BU has partnered with the SEDP-Simbag Pag-asenso in the monitoring of projects implemented including its sustainability. They were able to conduct monitoring and evaluation in the Provinces of Sorsogon, Albay and Camarines Sur last July 2020 to August 2020.

.



Other Payables



11)	The proper valuation and fairness of the presentation of the account Other Payables amounting to ₱20.99 million in the Year-end Financial Statement is affected due to: a) non-reversion to the Accumulated Surplus/Deficit account of the unidentified accounts aged more than four years; b) existence of accounts with negative balances; and c) non-disclosure of the nature and aging of the liability accounts in the Notes to Financial Statement. 



Sec. 111 of PD No. 1445 in the keeping of accounts provides: (1) The accounts of an agency shall be kept in such detail as is necessary to meet the needs of the agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or control agencies of the government, and (2) The highest standards of honesty, objectivity and consistency shall be observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate or misleading information.



Moreover, Section 15, Chapter 2 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I provides that Financial Statements shall present fairly the financial position, financial performance, and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in PPSAS. The application of PPSAS, with appropriate disclosures, if necessary, would result in a fair presentation of the FS.



Likewise, the following criteria for recording and recognition of liabilities, among others, were as follows:



• Section 4(6) of PD No. 1445 requires that claims against government funds shall be supported with complete documentation.



• Section 98 of the same Act provides that any unliquidated balance of accounts payable in the books of the national government, which has been outstanding for two years or more and against which no actual claim, administrative or judicial, has been filed or which is not covered by perfected contracts on record may be reverted to the unappropriated surplus of the general fund of the national government.



• Section 3.1 of DBM-COA Joint Circular No. 99-6 dated 13 November 1999 requires that all documented accounts payable of all funds which have remained outstanding for two years shall be reverted to surplus account.



• Section 3.3 of the same Joint Circular states that all undocumented A/Ps regardless of the year they were incurred, shall immediately be reverted to the Cumulative Results of Operations Unappropriated (CROU) account, subsequently converted to Accumulated Surplus in the new Revised Chart of Accounts.



• PPSAS, Volume I defines liabilities as present obligations of the entity arising from past events, the settlement of which is expected to result in an outflow from the entity of resources embodying economic benefits or service potential.



The financial report as of December 31, 2020 disclosed the following balances of Other Payables by fund cluster, viz:

		The above negative/debit balances reduced the overall balance of the Other Payable account.  



Moreover, the same schedule disclosed that an aggregate amount of ₱3.63 million from the prior year's account was marked “For Reconciliation”, broken down as follows:

The present Accountant reasoned out that the subject accounts with negative balances and for reconciliation were inherited from previous Accountants which they find difficult to reconcile and match against specific creditors.



Finally, it was observed that there was no disclosure provided on the nature and aging of the liability accounts in the Notes to Financial Statements.



The foregoing deficiencies affected the proper valuation and fair presentation of the subject account in the year-end financial statements.



We recommended and Management agreed to:



a)	Direct the concerned Accountants to investigate the subject liability accounts marked “For Reconciliation” and those with negative balances to be able to identify the specific creditors and record the necessary adjusting entries; 



b)	Revert the Other Payables accounts that remained outstanding for more than two years to the Accumulated Surplus/Deficit account; and



c)	Provide disclosure on the nature and aging of the liability accounts in the Annual Financial Reports.





Expenses



12)	The University’s Quarterly Physical Report of Operation as of September 30, 2020 registered an accomplishment of five or 38 per cent only out of the 13 targets/performance indicators which is far below the required average of 70 percent due to its laxity in monitoring individual program’s efficiency and effectiveness. 



		DBM Budget Circular No. 2020-5 dated November 4, 2020, provides the guidelines on the grant of the Collective Negotiation Agreement Incentive (CNA) for FY 2020. Pertinent provisions are hereby enumerated:



Section 4.1.2(a) provides the Accomplishment of Targets. It states that The NGAs, including Constitutional Offices enjoying fiscal autonomy, SUCs, and GOCCs not covered by RA No. 10149 should have accomplished, by September 30, 2020, at least an average of 70% of all the targets for all the organizational outcomes/performance indicators under their respective FY 2020 budget approved by Congress, or the approved FY 2020 Corporate Operating Budget (COB), whichever is applicable.

	

		Likewise, Section 1.4 thereof states that “Section 3 of AO No. 25 dated December 21, 2011 mandates that the harmonized Results-Based Performance Monitoring System shall be used as basis for determining entitlement to performance-based allowances, incentives, or compensation of government personnel, including the CNA Incentive.”



		Moreover, 4.1.3 of the same Budget Circular provides the Submission of Accountability Reports. It specified that “The NGAs, including Constitutional Offices enjoying fiscal autonomy and SUCs, should have submitted to DBM their respective accountability reports as of September 30, 2020, pursuant to COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2014-1 dated July 2, 2014, as amended by COA-DBM No. 2019-1 dated January 1, 2019.”



The required Budget and Financial Accountability Reports (BFARs), as of September 30, 2020, were submitted to DBM on November 18, 2020. Review of the Budget Accountability Report (BAR 1) or the Quarterly Physical Report of Operations thereof disclosed the University’s accomplishments vis-a-vis targets enumerated in the GAA for FY 2020:

The preceding table clearly reported that the University was not able to accomplish the required average of 70 per cent by September 30, instead only five out of its 13 or 38.46 per cent of its performance targets were realized. The justification reported under the Remarks column of the subject BAR that accomplishment will be reported in the 4th quarter seemed to be acceptable considering the global situation due to COVID-19 we are challenged with.



We recommended that Management improve its monitoring and reporting mechanism to be able to identify and address at the earliest possible time the existence of gaps that could delay or hinder the attainment of University goals set for the year.



Management Comment:



		In its letter dated May 27, 2021, Management explained that the aforementioned performance indicators are being reported in the last quarter of the calendar year. This is after processing/validating all the collected data from concerned offices. Thus, their possible resolution is the review and improvement of the University’s reporting of performance indicator with quarterly/semi-annual target settings. Finally, they commented that during the Academic Council held last May 27, 2021, the University President stated that the CNA Incentive shall be granted primarily if, at least 70 per cent of the targets is accomplished by third quarter.





Hazard Pay



13)	The regularity on the grant of COVID-19 Hazard Pay (HP) in the amount of ₱1.59 million cannot be easily determined due to incomplete documentation and improper recording of claims totaling ₱41,000. 



Under Proclamation No. 929 series of 2020, the entire country was placed under the State of Calamity for six (6) months and was imposed an Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) over the entire Luzon effective 17 March 2020 until 13 April 2020. It was during this period that government employees were ordered to stay at home and restrained from reporting physically for work because those who do in the urgency of their services are inevitably exposed to health risks and hazards.

 

Accordingly, AO No. 26 dated 23 March 2020 was issued authorizing the grant of hazard pay to government personnel, occupying either regular, contractual, or casual positions, or are workers engaged through COS, JO, or other similar schemes, who personally report for work during that ECQ period as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. Implementing guidelines thereof were prescribed under DBM's Budget Circular (BC) No. 2020-1 dated March 24, 2020. Enumerated hereunder are the pertinent guidelines and conditions on the grant of COVID-19 Hazard Pay prescribed by the budget circular, viz: 



4.3

The personnel/workers have been authorized to physically report for work at their respective offices or work stations on the prescribed official working hours by the head of agency/office during the period of implementation of Enhanced Community Quarantine measures in the area of such office or work station.



5.1.1

The amount required for personnel occupying regular, contractual, or casual positions shall be charged against their available released Personnel Services (PS) allotments, while the amount required for COS or JO workers shall be charged against their available Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE) allotments, without the need for prior authorization from the DBM, provided that all authorized mandatory expenses shall have been paid first. 



5.1.2

Should an NGA or SUC have insufficient PS or MOOE allotments, as the case may be, to fully cover the COVID-19 Hazard Pay at the rate of P500/day per person, a lower but uniform rate may be granted for all qualified personnel.



10.0 

The grant of the COVID-19 Hazard Pay shall be effective beginning March 17, 2020.



11.0 

Agencies shall be responsible for the proper implementation of the provisions of this Circular. The responsible officers shall be held liable for any payment not in accordance with the provisions hereof without prejudice to the refund by the employees concerned of any excess or unauthorized payments.



The extension of ECQ over the entire Luzon up to April 30, 2020, has been covered under the memorandum issued from the Executive Secretary dated April 7, 2020. Later, upon the recommendation of the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) for Emerging Infectious Disease, with its Resolution No. 31 series of 2020 dated May 1, 2020, ECQ in Albay was again extended for another 15 days from May 1 to 15, 2020.



Along this line, the Audit Team was furnished by the Office of the University President, upon request, with copies of issued Special Accreditation Orders (SAO) to various officers and employees, allowing entry to the University premises to perform urgent tasks, with strict observance of social distancing and wearing of face masks at all times.



Our verification of transaction documents relative to the grant of COVID-19 Hazard Pay disclosed that attachments to the claims were limited to the subject AO No. 26, DBM BC No. 2020-1, SAOs, and certifications issued by the supervisors. The following are the common deficiencies noted:



a)	Incomplete documentation

--	There were HP claims without an approved SAO from the Office of the President and yet was allowed to claim.

--	Some claims were supported with certifications of work accomplishment signed by their respective supervisors, others have no attachment except for the copies of the AO 26 or the related DBM guidelines. 

--	There were at least several HP claimants from BU-Tabaco Campus where Daily Time Records (DTRs) were appropriately attached but for most of the payrolls, no DTR of the claimants was submitted. 



Time record is an official document where an employee records the actual date and time of his physical arrival and departure from the office. In the absence of a biometric machine or any similar equipment, the actual attendance of all officials and employees may be recorded in a logbook maintained for this purpose. Entries to the DTR shall be based on this logbook. Consequently, unless otherwise contested, DTR serves as the basic document to show proof of actual and physical attendance of an employee to the office premises.



b)	Inappropriate charging of HP amounting to ₱41,000 



Verification of HP payrolls disclosed improper recording of Hazard Pay totaling ₱41,000 resulting to misstatements of the affected expense accounts:

c)	Unnumbered and irregularly issued SAO. 



--		The use of a pre-numbered document is an internal control measure that can be adopted in the issuance of SAO. It facilitates easy referencing, especially in financial and compliance-related transactions. 

--		SAOs issued for 29 PDMO personnel authorized them to report simultaneously for work for the period April 20 to May 14, 2020, raising doubt whether social distancing had been considered before its issuance.

--		Inclusive dates of SAOs for the period March 16 to 31, 2020 was not indicated.



d)	HP claims for dates beyond the ECQ period



At least four personnel of BU-Gubat Campus were paid with Hazard Pay on dates where ECQ was already lifted (May 27 and 29, 2020). 



The foregoing deficiencies are not in conformity with Sections 4 (6) and (7) of PD No. 1445 which requires that claims against government funds shall be supported with complete documentation. All laws and regulations applicable to financial transactions shall be faithfully adhered to.



Summary results of the audited HP claims covered by 108 DVs, in the amount of ₱1.75 million is presented in the table below:

b)	Submission of lacking documents, such as SAOs and/or DTRs for the period March 2020 to May 2020 for proper audit disposition of the subject HP with incomplete documentation;



c)	Observe proper account classification as prescribed under the latest Revised Chart of Accounts issued by the Commission; and



d)	For future issuance of SAO, as an internal control mechanism, issue pre-numbered orders duly indicated with specific purpose and inclusive dates of effectivity as necessary.







Management Comment:



As of writing, the Accountants of Clusters II and III have submitted the DTRs and SAOs to support the HP claims of personnel under them for proper audit disposition.





Scholarships



14)	Management has been unsuccessful in the enforcement of refund for breach of contracts by those grantees who were unable to complete their scholarship. 



The University’s updated Human Resource Development Program Policy Guidelines (HRDPPG) is embodied in its AO No. 292 dated June 13, 2016. Sanctions and Penalties for Violations of the Terms and Conditions of Scholarship Contract were discussed in Sections 14.1 and 16.1, quoted hereunder: 



Section 14.1 Any willful act or violation and/or breach of any of the terms and conditions stipulated in the BU-HRDP Guidelines and the Contract hereof, shall be considered a culpable violation thereof and shall render the grantee liable to the University for Breach of Contract. The grantee therefore shall be held liable for the immediate refund of the entire amount plus the legal rate of interest prevailing at the time of the cost granted within a year from the promulgation of the decision on the violation. The University reserves the right to institute appropriate legal and administrative action as may be warranted under the circumstances after having undergone due process.



Section 16.1 If the scholar fails to complete the degree stipulated in the contract through the scholars’ own fault or willful neglect or loss of confidence, resignation, or voluntary separation the scholar shall refund to the Bicol University the following:



a)	Actual amount defrayed to the study grant, and

b)	Salaries and other allowances and benefits while on scholarship



This is a reiteration of prior year’s audit observation. 



The University Management, in due consideration of the concerned scholar employees, opted in its letter dated April 12, 2019 to ‘recommend to finish their studies on their own within one school year, 2019-2020 on a condition that failure to finish would mean imposition of corresponding sanction as stipulated on the contract.’ However, this recommendation though permissible might be intolerable already for those who have ceased to study for more than decades. It also does not anticipate future events that would impede necessary refunds, such as resignation, retirement, health reasons, and others. 



The HRDP Status Report as of January 31, 2021, submitted by the HRMDO recorded a total of 194 grantees which despite requests for extensions, covering AYs 1996 to 2021, were not able to finish their chosen Masters, Doctoral, and Bachelors’ degree courses, as follows:

194





It was also learned that at least eight of the above scholars have already separated from the Office due to resignation, retirement, death, expiration of appointment, and dropped from the rolls, even without securing the necessary clearance, thus, was not able to make any refunds.



The report disclosed further that out of the 43 scholars recommended to make refunds in CY 2018 audit, 13 grantees have graduated and/or had attended training or bar review, thereby leaving 30 grantees to complete their scholarships with estimated cash grants of ₱7.53 million. It is restated that this amount was limited to the scholarship grants during AYs 2013 to 2018 of scholars who were not able to complete their scholarship program with a possible breach of contract. Due to the insufficiency of records, the Audit Team was not able to include the cost estimates for the scholarship grants of similarly situated scholars during AYs 1996 to 2012.

 

For the year under audit, one scholar with scholarship grants amounting to ₱174,345 for the academic period June 2008 to November 2009 was able to make refunds last July 3, 2020.  



Continuous deferment to promulgate a decision on the violation by the scholar employees of the terms and conditions stipulated on their contracts resulted in the delay to recover significant costs incurred for their scholarships that could be used in the furtherance of the University’s operation.



We recommended and Management agreed:



a)	To cause the promulgation of a decision to be able to recoup the financial assistance, salaries, and allowances relative to the scholarship grants from those scholars with breach of contracts; and



b)	That the respective Accounting Office/s, in coordination with the Campus Administrative Officer, come up with their computations of the monetary benefits for each employee grantee with a final decision of the violation.





30. The information on the probable refunds from grantees’ prior years’ scholarship benefits was not disclosed in the Notes to Financial Statements. 



Financial statements shall present fairly the financial position, financial performance, and cash flows of an entity.  Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in PPSASs. The application of PPSASs, with additional disclosures when necessary, is presumed to result in financial statements that achieve a fair presentation. (Paragraph 27, PPSAS 1).



A fair presentation requires an entity to present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable, and understandable information.



IPSAS 19 discussed provisions, contingent liabilities, and assets: (a) define provisions, contingent liabilities, and contingent assets, and (b) identify the circumstances in which provisions should be recognized, how they should be measured, and the disclosures that should be made about them. The Standard also requires that certain information be disclosed about contingent liabilities and contingent assets in the notes to the financial statements, to enable users to understand their nature, timing, and amount.

	Pertinent provisions on Contingent Assets are hereby enumerated:

	

	Paragraph 18

	A contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from past events, and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the entity.

	

	Paragraph 41

	Contingent assets are not recognized in financial statements, since this may result in the recognition of revenue that may never be realized. However, when the realization of revenue is virtually certain, then the related asset is not a contingent asset and its recognition is appropriate.

	

	Paragraph 42

	A contingent asset is disclosed, as required by paragraph 105, where an inflow of economic benefits or service potential is probable.

	

	Paragraph 43

	Contingent assets are assessed continually to ensure that developments are appropriately reflected in the financial statements. If it has become virtually certain that an inflow of economic benefits or service potential will arise and the asset’s value can be measured reliably, the asset and the related revenue are recognized in the financial statements of the period in which the change occurs. If an inflow of economic benefits or service potential has become probable, an entity discloses the contingent asset (see paragraph 105).

	

	Paragraph 44

	The amount recognized as a provision shall be the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the reporting date.

	

	Paragraph 105

	Where an inflow of economic benefits or service potential is probable, an entity shall disclose a brief description of the nature of the contingent assets at the reporting date, and, where practicable, an estimate of their financial effect, measured using the principles set out for provisions in paragraphs 44–62.

	

			Section 16.1 of the BU-HRDPPG and as stipulated in every scholarship contract provides that the scholar who fails to complete his/her degree through his/her own fault or willful neglect or loss of confidence, resignation, or voluntary separation the scholar shall refund to the Bicol University the actual amount defrayed to the study grant, including salaries and other allowances and benefits while on scholarship.

	

			Depending on the duration, a significant amount is usually involved in the scholarship program of the University for the academic and professional advancement of its qualified personnel and employees. Consequently, an initial audit of the program in prior years have disclosed a total cost estimate of more than ₱7.00 million pesos that may be demanded a refund from 30 grantees out of the 194 grantees identified to have not yet graduated from his/her course as of January 31, 2021. 

	

			No information pertaining to this scholarship program, however, was disclosed in the financial reports of the University.

	

		As explained above, Contingent Asset is not recognized, but a brief description of its nature shall rather be disclosed in the Financial Statements. 



Having no refunds being collected yet from those grantees who were not able to fulfill their obligation under scholarship contracts, it would be appropriate to disclose in the financial statements under the Contingent Assets the best estimate of the probable refund/collectible/receivable, as of the close of December 31, 2020. The disclosure will provide the University’s financial statement users relevant information that may produce good decisions for the success of the scholarship program.

	

We recommended and Management agreed to include a disclosure in the Notes to Financial Statements the best estimate amount of the probable receivable from prior years from those affected scholar grantees.





1)	Grant of scholarship was recorded as outright expense instead of Other Receivable account. 

	

COA Circular No. 2020-001 dated January 8, 2020 prescribes the Revised Chart of Accounts (Updated 2019) for NGAs. Other Receivable accounts are described as This account is debited to recognize amount due from debtors and other agencies not falling under any of the specific receivable account. This also includes receivables from individuals or entities intended for specific projects or purpose not falling under any of the specific receivable account. This account is credited for receipt of payment, liquidation, write-off, and/or adjustments.



Section 4.2.15 of the 2016 HRDP provides that trainees as grantees shall submit to the Head of the Agency report of the study/training within 30 days for local foreign training/scholarship grant after his return to duty copy furnished the Civil Service Commission. X x x. Scholarship grantees shall submit to the Head of Office his/her Official Transcript of Grades at the close of each quarter, term, and/or semester. Similar provisions were incorporated in the HRDP for the years 2004-2005, 2010-2011, and 2014, as well as in the contract/MOA entered into by the scholars/grantees with the University.



As in prior years, the payment of scholarship expenses, such as tuition fees, book allowance, transportation expenses, monthly stipend, thesis, and dissertation assistance is recorded as Scholarship Grants/Expenses, or any appropriate expense account. 



			It was also observed that the receivable account (Due from Officers and Employees) was set-up eight days before the actual date of receipt of the first-ever cash refund made by an employee for his scholarship grants this audit year. This asset account was closed to the Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) account to record receipt of the cash refund. 

		

Recording as an expense account would mean non-recognition of liability while recording as a receivable account would compel the grantees to abide by one’s obligation as stipulated in the scholarship contract. The use therefore of the Other Receivable account on the payment of related scholarship expenses to the grantees would serve as a reminder to them and to the University that this personnel benefit is not purely monetary but an HRD intervention for their personal development.



We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accounting Section to record the scholarship expenses granted to scholars-grantees under Other Receivables account effective CY 2021 and maintain subsidiary ledgers for the same. The Official Transcript of Record and/or Diploma shall be the supporting documents to close the Receivable account.





Results of the Cash Examination



2)	Series of cash advances totaling ₱10.62 million to pay students’ beneficiaries and honoraria claims of regular employees were granted without observing Section 89 of PD No. 1445 and DBM Circular Letter No. 2018-14 dated December 28, 2018.



Section 89 of PD No. 1445 provides for the limitation on cash advances. As stated therein: “No additional cash advance shall be allowed to any official or employee unless the previous cash advance given to him is first settled or a proper accounting thereof has been made.” 

		

Updated guidelines in the implementation of the Modified Direct Payment Scheme (MDPS) for the accounts payable of all NGAs have been released by the DBM under DBM Circular Letter No. 2018-14 dated December 28, 2018.  

 	

In said Circular, NGAs are mandated to pay using the Advice to Debit Account (ADA) to all creditors/suppliers. These payees are advised to open accounts with the government servicing banks (GSBs) wherein the agency concerned has an account.



This is a reiteration of the previous observation which was noted among the cash advances granted to AOs. 



We have analyzed the series of cash advances which amounted to ₱10.62 million, granted to the following AOs:



Campus

Amount

Average Cash Advance

No. of Days Outstanding

Gubat and East Campuses

₱7,048,500.00

₱704,850.00

38

Tabaco 

3,201,000.00

266,750.00

74

Daraga Campus

        365,664.58

              0.00



Total

₱10,615,164.58

₱971,600.00





Additional cash advances were granted despite non-settlement of the previous cash advance, and this constitutes disregard of Section 89 of PD No. 1445. As a result, a significant amount of funds remains in the custody of the AO for longer periods. Analysis showed that an average amount of ₱0.97 million in currencies was outstanding at an average of 38 to 74 days before full settlement.



Interview with the concerned AO disclosed that the student-grantees of BU-Gubat Campus were required by the OSAS to open an account with the AGDB after the lifting of the ECQ in May 2020. This is in due consideration of health protocols brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic which restricted the travel of the AO to BU-Gubat Campus who is presently stationed at BU Main Campus. However, the Automated Teller Machine (ATM) cards have yet to be released to the student-grantees. 



Also, the delay in the liquidation of cash advances is due to the late receipt of claims by these students-grantees as explained by the AO. This could have been addressed had Management opted to abide by our previous recommendation to require these student-grantees to open an account with the AGDB.



Similarly, verification of the liquidation reports of honoraria of regular University employees were made through cash advances of the AO, instead of the mandated ADA-MDPS. There were at least 14 payrolls, which the AO has to cash advance and eventually deposit the corresponding claims of at least 48 employees to their respective bank accounts. 



The AO justified that she resorted to have them deposited to their respective accounts because said claimants were not able to get said honorarium at a given time. Likewise, it is the Administrative Office who is responsible in the preparation of payroll.



Considering that the AOs have the capability to deposit (thru BU Payroll Fund) the amount due to employees directly to their respective bank accounts, said practice can be adopted to all payees following the ADA. Furthermore, said practice was inconsistent with the DBM’s purpose for a better cash management, and therefore put to risk of loss/misappropriation the cash in the custody of the AOs.

   

We reiterated our previous recommendation that Management adopt the ADA mode of disbursement in releasing funds to students-grantees wherein these student-grantees shall be required to open an account with the AGDB of the University and regular employees as well, so that all claims will be credited to their respective accounts, instead of having it cash advance by the AO.  

 

Management Comment:



		In a letter dated January 13, 2021, Management explained that occurrence of two cash advances at the same time is inevitable where AO handles at least two Colleges. Nonetheless, Management ensured that all cash advances are disbursed properly. The Accounting Section informed Management relative to the adoption of ADA mode of disbursement.



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



		The Audit Team strongly recommends the adoption of ADA mode of disbursements, both on the regular employees, job order status, and the student-grantees.





3)	The cash advance granted to the AO amounting to ₱35,000 was transferred to and utilized by another personnel and the liquidation thereof was delayed by 447 days after its utilization. 



Section 1.2 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012, prescribes that the accountable officer shall liquidate cash advances for special purpose as soon as the purpose of the cash advance has been served. 



Section 4.1.6 COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997, likewise, provides that, Transfer of cash advance from one Accountable Officer (AO) to another shall not be allowed.



Analysis of the cash advances granted to the Cashier in the amount of ₱35,000 for the gasoline and food allowance in fetching the Accreditors in Manila and for tarpaulin printing of the upcoming Accrediting Agency of Chartered Colleges and Universities in the Philippines, Inc. (AACCUP) Accreditation Survey Visit on October 21-25, 2019 disclosed that the liquidation thereof was not made within the prescribed period. According to the Accounting Office, it was initially liquidated on January 10, 2020, under Liquidation Report No. 01-2020- 01-002, but the documents were returned to the Cashier due to lack of attachments and other concerns. However, said liquidation report was resubmitted almost a year after which was only on January 6, 2021, together with the cash refund of ₱5,145. The total number of days delayed for its liquidation accumulated to 447 days. 



It was learned that the cash advance was entrusted to another personnel not authorized to receive the fund, thereby causing difficulty in liquidating the said cash advance. The practice of allowing other personnel to handle the utilization, disbursement, and settlement of cash advance is contrary to the abovementioned guidelines. 



The Cashier is reminded that the accountability for the liquidation of the cash advance within the prescribed period is her responsibility. When the purpose for which the cash advance was granted has been served, it should be properly liquidated or settled. There is no reason for the AO to keep the unspent balance for an extended period as this amount could not be used for other purposes. 



The above-mentioned practices are contrary to the rules and regulations in the granting, utilization and liquidation of cash advance, and the procedure applied exposes the government funds to possible risk of loss and/or misappropriations. 



We recommended that Management require the AOs to stop the practice of transferring the cash advances to other personnel and to liquidate the same as soon as the purpose for which they were granted has been served. 



Henceforth, strictly enforce the rules and regulations on the granting, utilization and, liquidation of Cash Advances in accordance with COA Circular Nos. 97-002 and 2012- 001.



Management Comment:



		In an undated letter received by the Audit Team on March 16, 2021, the AO expressed her good intentions, being the sole bonded officer at that time and assured compliance to aforesaid regulation.





4)	Submission of mandatory reports and its supporting documents by the Accounting Office is beyond the prescribed period with the delay ranging from 15 to 396 days.



Section 100 of PD No. 1445 provides that Disbursing Officers in any government agency shall render monthly reports of their transactions pursuant to regulations of the Commission to be submitted not later than the fifth day of the ensuing month to the auditor concerned who shall conduct the necessary examination and audit within thirty days from receipt thereof. 



Furthermore, Section 7.2.1(a) of the Rules and Regulations on the Settlement of Accounts (RRSA) as prescribed under COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009, placed the following responsibility, among others, on the Agency Accountant and other officials performing accounting and/or bookkeeping functions: The Chief Accountant, bookkeeper and/or other authorized official performing accounting and/or bookkeeping functions of the audited agency shall ensure that the reports and supporting documents by the accountable officers are immediately recorded in the books of accounts and submitted to the Auditor within the first ten (10) days of the ensuing month. 



We have evaluated the frequency of submission of the subject mandatory reports, all funds, covered by cash examination. As observed, the monthly reports for Campuses/Units are directly submitted by the Campus/Unit Accountants to the audit team whereas, for those GASS accounts, these are being submitted by the University Accountant. Frequent delays, however, were observed in the submission of the required reports from the Accounting Office to the Audit Team, as summarized in the table below:

The existing condition is not in conformity to the abovementioned provisions of law, rules, and regulations, thus, prevented the Audit Team from conducting a timely audit and verification of financial transactions. 



We recommended and Management agreed to remind the concerned Accountant to submit all the mandatory financial reports within the prescribed period to facilitate timely review and audit of the accounts. 











5)	Issuance of checks for projects was not made in chronological order.	



In any instances where a document is pre-numbered, issuance thereof shall be made in chronological order. While this was categorically required for ORs under Section 73 of the GAAM Volume I, similarly, this dictum can also be applied in the issuance of checks. 



Tabaco Campus has several projects. It was observed even in previous cash examinations that the issuance of checks for these projects was not made in sequential order. And this was already verbally brought to their attention. Accordingly, one stub of the check was distributed among the projects and assigned specific check numbers. The AO continued said practice. The problem, however, arises when one project with voluminous transactions has consumed the assigned checks, checks therefore from other projects was utilized instead, thus, the non-sequential issuance of checks. Presented below is the list of projects and its assigned check number: 



Check Balance/ Assignment

Projects

Issued to

758719 - 758738

Soft Shelled Crab

Soft Shelled Crab/Eel/ Banana

758800 - 758800

Banana Project

Eel

758815 - 758900

Upgrading

Eel

758700 - 758700

Squid Pot Project

Eel 



Eel Project has the most transactions that it utilized the checks from other projects. The practice of non-issuance of checks in sequential order not only created difficulty in tracing but likewise impairs the accuracy of the report of checks issued and the inventory for accountable forms. 



The foregoing practice does not promote early detection of missing series that may result in improper and unauthorized use of the accountable forms. 



We recommended and Management agreed to require the OIC-Cashier to issue checks in sequential order and the concerned Accountant to monitor compliance with this regulation. 





6)	The inability of Management to notify the Office of the Audit Team on the result/s of the inspection of accountable forms (AF No. 51-C) rendered the AO’s and Internal Audit Service (IAS) reports on missing/defective accountable forms doubtful. 



		Section 94 of the GAAM, Volume states that: Upon receipt of accountable forms from the National Printing Office, the Collecting Officer/Treasurer/Property Officer shall examine carefully each book or pad. He shall segregate any book or pad found to contain defects, such as incorrect series of numbers, or missing leaves or sheets, etc. and submit it to the COA Unit Auditor together with a statement of the defects or deficiencies noted.



The COA Unit Auditor shall examine the book or pad. If he finds that the defects are due to error in binding or printing, he shall make proper notations on the book or on the defective sheet itself. He shall also immediately furnish the Collecting Officer/Treasurer/Property Officer concerned with two copies of the certificate covering his action. The Collecting Officer/Treasurer/Property Officer shall use this certificate in support of a credit to his account for the missing or defective forms noted by the Unit Auditor. The agency, through the Unit Auditor, shall send two copies of the certificate to the Head of the National Printing Office. These copies shall contain the initials or numbers that are written on the respective card covers of the defective books or pads, or on a slip covering such information for the guidance of the National Printing Office in locating employees responsible for the error or deficiency.



Post audit of the ORs under the accountability of the AO disclosed that at least eight ORs were reported to have been missing. Said missing ORs were supported with a photocopy of the card covers of the defective book or pad, bearing the initial of the IAS inspector dated October 26, 2018, detailed below:

Procurement of 200 pads ORs (AF 51-C), including the above enumerated ORs, was made from the National Printing Office paid under check no. 2670899 dated April 23, 2018. The inspection was conducted from October 16, 2018 to February 19, 2019 by the University’s IAS as shown in the Inspection and Acceptance Report (IAR) consisting of 33 pages. Page six of said IAR disclosed that OR Nos. 2216980 to 2216985 (equivalent to six ORs) were missing. However, there seems to be inconsistency in the certification portion of the IAR by the Inspection Officer, which read as “inspected, verified and found in order as to quantity and specifications”. 



Moreover, OR Nos. 2218054 and 2218295 reported missing by the AO and supported by a photocopy of the card covers of the defective book or pad, bearing the initial of the IAS inspector dated October 26, 2018 did not reconcile with that of the IAR supporting the NPO. 



The practice of Management on the non-notification to the COA on the defects noted on the procured accountable forms casts doubt on the AO’s report as well as IAS’ certification in the IAR.  

		





We recommended and Management agreed on the following courses of action:



a)	Separate the pads with defective ORs and submit to the Office of the Audit Team, together with a statement of the deficiency/ies noted, such as incorrect series of numbers, or missing leaves or sheets, etc., for COA’s disposition; and 



b)	The AO shall examine carefully each pad of accountable forms issued for his/her accountability.





Request for relief from property accountability



7)	The BUTC Management did not immediately notify the Audit Team for the losses of government records and properties caused by fire and neither a request for relief from property accountability was submitted.



		Section 73 (1) of PD No. 1445 and Section 498, Volume 1 of the GAAM both provide:



		Credit for loss occurring in transit or due to casualty or force majeure – When a loss of government funds or property occurs while they are in transit or the loss is caused by fire, theft, or other casualty or force majeure, the officer accountable therefore or having custody thereof shall immediately notify the Commission or the auditor concerned and, within 30 days or such longer period as the Commission or auditor may in the particular case allow, shall present his application for relief, with the available supporting evidence. Whenever warranted by the evidence, credit for the loss shall be allowed. An officer who fails to comply with this requirement shall not be relieved of liability or allowed credit for any loss in the settlement of his account.



In addition, Section 499, Volume I of the GAAM enumerates the following documents in support of the request for relief from accountability for losses of property, whichever are applicable:



a)	Affidavit executed by the accountable officer stating the following facts:

1)	Property lost and its valuation;

2)	Actual date in which the absence was first noted;

3)	Manner of disappearance;

4)	Efforts put forth to recover the same;

5)	Provisions made to safeguard the property; and

6)	Date when the loss was reported to the auditor and the police authorities;

b)	Joint Affidavit of two (2) disinterested persons cognizant of the facts and circumstances about the loss. In case it is not possible to obtain the statement of two disinterested persons and only one is available, or none at all, such fact should be set forth in the affidavit of the person requesting relief, giving the reasons therefor;

c)	Final Police Report showing the steps taken by the police authorities to recover the property lost and to apprehend the suspect(s) and the present status of the case;

d)	Comments and/or recommendation of the agency head;

e)	Comments and/or recommendation of the auditor as a result of the investigation and evaluation of the causes of the loss and the evidences submitted, which shall be listed in his indorsement, taking into consideration the degree of diligence exercised by the accountable officer in the safekeeping of government property under his custody so that negligence on the part of the accountable officer is not an attributable factor to the causes of loss;

f)	Certification from Police/Fire Chief/Provincial Governor /Mayor or other competent authority as to the destruction brought by natural calamity and/or insurgency;

g)	Inspection Report on the extent of damage on insured property;

h)	Evidence of the immediate issuance of the notice of loss of accountable forms as required under COA Circular No. 84-233 dated August 2, 1984;

i)	Report on Cash Examination conducted immediately after the loss (For cash losses).

j)	Copy of Memorandum Receipt(s) for property losses.

k)	Certificate by the veterinarian as to the cause of death with a description of the animal, if the property is a government animal under the care of a veterinarian.



		Moreover, in Sections 102 of PD No. 1445, the primary and secondary responsible officials for government funds and property were identified:

1)	The head of any agency of the government is immediately and primarily responsible for all government funds and property pertaining to his agency.



2)	Persons entrusted with the possession or custody of the funds or property under the agency head shall be immediately responsible to him, without prejudice to the liability of either party to the government.



On August 23, 2020, a fire occurred at the Collaboration Building, BUTC, causing damages to the Dean’s stock room, equipment, furniture and fixtures, and documents stored therein. The itemized list of damages showed a total loss of ₱2.56 million. Insurance claims for the loss have been filed with the GSIS under Policy Number FI-NM-GSISLEG-0001277. This incident, however, was not reported to the COA. It was only discovered on January 19, 2021 upon the visit of the COA Audit Team of its temporary office at BUTC situated within that Collaboration building and adjacent to the room damaged by fire.  This office was also used as a COA storage room of prior year’s files received from the Campus. 



		On verbal request, a report of the fire incident was submitted by the BUTC Dean to the Audit Team on February 3, 2021. In her letter dated January 30, 2021, the BUTC Dean apologized for not immediately informing the Audit Team of the losses due to the fire incident as allegedly she was not aware that a COA Office was situated within the building. 



It is emphasized, however, that the presence of the COA office on that building is not a consideration in reporting the government losses due to fire incidents. The provisions of Section 73 (1) of PD No. 1445 and Section 498, Volume I of GAAM stress the obligation of the AO to immediately report to the COA the incident of loss of government properties and to file a relief from property accountability. As of this writing, however, no relief from property accountability was filed to this office.

		Upon inquiry, the BUTC Dean admitted that she was not aware of said regulations, hence, has not caused the filing of relief from property accountability for the lost property with COA. She further explained that they already filed an insurance claim from the GSIS and that the repair of the damaged building was already included in the programs to be funded and implemented by the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH). Successful claim from GSIS insurance and subsequent repair of the building, however, do not relieve those officials accountable for the property lost from the liability. Further, the delay in reporting the damaged properties due to the fire incident precluded the COA to immediately investigate while the clues are still fresh to satisfy itself that the alleged loss had occurred without negligence on the part of the AO. 



		Interestingly, ocular inspection showed that the fire did not reach the COA BUTC office, hence, raised questions on how the official records and documents which were supposed to be stored inside the room while kept inside the steel cabinets were caught on fire. Moreover, it was observed that these COA records and documents were not totally damaged by fire though burnt on the sides. It, however, underwent further deterioration as these documents were left fully exposed to rain, dust, and other natural elements. This condition suggested that the BUTC Officials did not apply due diligence in safeguarding these documents. Had the incident reported to the COA Office at the earliest time, the Audit Team could have taken immediate action to save these official documents.



At present, the subject steel cabinets were found being used at the Accounting Office of the Campus. Also, the campus official accountable to those damaged properties has yet to be identified.



The foregoing situation is not in observance of the existing law, rules and, regulations for property losses.









We recommended that Management: 



	a)	Instruct the Supply and Property Management official to determine based on records the campus officials accountable to the lost properties; 



a)	Remind the AO to file his/her application for relief from property accountability to the COA in accordance with Section 73 (1) of the PD No. 1445 and Sections 498 and 499, Volume I of GAAM, duly supported with the required documents and explanation for the delay in filing; and



b)	Require the BUTC Dean to provide a written explanation why the official records and documents in the custody of COA were damaged by fire considering that the fire did not reach the COA BUTC Office and how come the steel cabinets where said documents were stored/kept are already being used by the Accounting Office.

	

	Management Comment:

	

		In a letter dated March 22, 2021, the University President transmitted the application for the relief from property accountability of the accountable officers together with the supporting documents and an explanation for the delay thereof. 

	

		Management also furnished the Audit Team a copy of the Minutes of the Meeting discussing the results of the preliminary investigation on the fire incident in the former COA Office at the Collaboration Building, Tabaco Campus. This was duly supported by written statements of the concerned personnel of the Campus explaining their side on why the official records and documents in the custody of COA were damaged by fire.

	

	Auditor’s Rejoinder:

	

		Initial review of the transmitted application for the relief from accountability disclosed that it lacks certain documents enumerated in Section 499, Volume 1 of GAAM including the comments and recommendation of the University President. This deficiency was immediately communicated to BU Management for their appropriate action and compliance.

	

	

	Delay in the Account Submission

	

8)	At least 130 check disbursement transactions amounting to ₱10.79 million remained unsubmitted with 23 to 1590 days delay.



			Section 7 of COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009, identifies the responsible officials for the audit and settlement of agency accounts. Pertinent sub-sections are quoted as follows:



7.1.1 

The head of the agency, who is primarily responsible for all government funds and property pertaining to his agency, shall ensure that: (a) the required financial and other reports and statements are submitted by the concerned agency officials in such form and within the period prescribed by the Commission; X x x.



7.2.1

The Chief Accountant, Bookkeeper or other authorized official performing accounting and/or bookkeeping functions of the audited agency shall ensure that:



a) the reports and supporting documents submitted by the accountable officers are immediately recorded in the books of accounts and submitted to the Auditor within the first ten (10) days of the ensuing month; X x x.

	

Section 7 Chapter 2 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume 1 further states that the COA shall keep the general accounts of the Government and, for such period as may be provided by law, preserve the vouchers and other supporting papers pertaining thereto, pursuant to Section 2, par. (1), Article IX-D of the 1987 Philippine Constitution.



			As of May 15, 2021, all colleges/units/campuses have transmitted to the Audit Team the CY 2020 accounts pertaining to collection, disbursements and payrolls of the University. It was observed, however, that there were delays ranging 23 to 460 days in the submission thereof, not in observance with the existing COA regulations. Our monitoring showed that the accounts for the first semester 2020 were submitted mostly in December 2020 while for the second semester 2020, these were transmitted only during the first quarter of 2021.

	

			Further verification of the transmitted accounts for CY 2020 including prior years revealed that there were missing DVs paid by checks issued as early as December 2016, thus, already overdue with computed 441 to 1,536 days delay. The unsubmitted check disbursement accounts amounted to at least ₱10.79 million as of May 15, 2021:

			The submission of accounts to the Audit Team is done individually by the 10 accounting officials assigned on the 23 different campuses/colleges/units of the University.



		Incomplete and delayed submission of the University’s accounts precluded the timely verification of its cash transactions. Likewise, the accuracy and completeness of the recorded transactions in the books cannot be easily established, and reliability of the balances of the affected accounts in the financial statements cannot be ascertained.

	

We recommended that Management:



a)	Cause the immediate submission of all accounts including prior years; and 



b)	For succeeding months, monitor complete submission of accounts by the Accounting Offices through its College/Campus/Unit Deans and Directors within 10 days after the end of each month as mandated.

	

	Management Comment:



In a letter dated April 19, 2021, BU Management, in addition to the individual explanations of the cluster accountants, offered the following justification:



a)	The Accounting Section started the recording of CY 2020 transactions in March 2020 since the aforesaid section finished the FS 2019 in February 2020;

b)	The COVID-19 pandemic hinders the submission of CY 2020 accounts.



For CY 2021, Management consider it a a challenge for the Accounting Section to comply with the submission of the accounts within the prescribed period since recording of current transactions started only by March 2021.

	

	

	Advance PO’s and Contracts

	

9)	Copies of the approved contracts and purchase orders (POs) including its supporting documents were not submitted within the prescribed period. Likewise, no notice of delivery of all procured items was made during the year to the Office of the Audit Team.



		COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009 states that all government agencies are required to furnish the auditor with copies of perfected contracts, approved purchase orders, and supporting documents for review within the timeframe granted. Item 3.1.1 of the same Circular prescribed that within five (5) working days from the execution of a contract by the government or any of its subdivisions, agencies or instrumentalities, including government-owned and controlled corporations and their subsidiaries, a copy of said contract and each of all the documents forming part thereof by reference or incorporation shall be furnished to the auditor of the agency concerned. Item 3.2.1 of the same circular also prescribes that a copy of any purchase order, irrespective of the amount, and each and every supporting document, shall, within five (5) working days from issuance thereof, be submitted to the Auditor concerned.

	

		Likewise, COA Circular No. 96-010 dated August 15, 1996 requires that the agency officials responsible for accepting deliveries of procured items shall, within twenty-four (24) hours from acceptance, notify the Auditor of the time and date of the deliveries. In case of partial delivery of any item in the PO, the copy to be submitted shall indicate which items have been delivered, and which have not. This is further reiterated under paragraph 6.9 of COA Circular No. 2009-002 which requires the agency to furnish the auditor copies of the delivery documents within twenty-four (24) hours after acceptance of deliveries of goods and services, regardless of whether or not the transaction is subject to pre-audit.



		We have noted that Management, in compliance with the foregoing regulations, submits to the COA Office advance copies of the POs/Contracts. However, except for some of the contracts resulting from public bidding, it has been the practice of the University to furnish PO with Notice of Award only and mostly without any supporting documents necessary for the review of the document, such as Purchase Request, Abstract of Bids, Bids and Awards Committee Resolutions etc. Some of these POs were also not filled-up properly specifically the date of conforme/issuance by the supplier.



		Records of this Office also showed that the submission of advance POs covering the various acquisition of supplies and materials were mostly delayed ranging from 1-187 days beyond the prescribed period of five working days from the issuance of the same. As to the MOA, job order, and consultancy contract, these are not submitted in advance to the Audit Team as required:

The delay noted in the submission for the period covering March 16, 2020, to May 15, 2020, was no longer incorporated as consideration was taken for the limited movement of personnel on the health protocols being observed in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic. 



Likewise, notification of deliveries of various supplies and goods duly supported with an advance copy of IAR and photocopy of charge/delivery invoice was never made by concerned offices. For CY 2020, there were 1,359 noted deliveries of various items recorded in the books amounting to ₱42.06 million:

As part of our audit activity, the review and inspection of delivered goods and services may be undertaken by the Audit Team separately and independently based on the copies of the documents required to be submitted. Due to the delay in the submission of the said documents, the procured goods may no longer be available for inspection as these were already consumed or have been distributed to end-users. The certification of the Supply Officer and the Property Inspector in the IAR that the goods/services were inspected, verified, and found to be in accordance with specifications cannot be verified since the Audit Team was unable to conduct its own inspection.



The inability of Management to submit the said documents within the prescribed period prevented the Audit Team to immediately inform Management of any defect and/or deficiencies found in its review as well as conduct the ocular inspection of delivered goods or accomplished projects at the most opportune time, especially at the point of delivery of the items or during the implementation of the projects.





We recommended that Management:



a)	Direct the personnel-in-charge with the release of contracts/ POs to furnish the Auditor with copies of these documents, including the related supporting papers/attachments, within five days of execution; and



b)	Require the Supply Officer to inform the Auditor of the time and date of all deliveries within 24 hours from his acceptance.



Management Comment:



The late submission of the MOA in connection with the BU DSWD Skills Training Program was due to the oversight on the part of the personnel-in-charge of the documentation process of the project. 



Based on the records of the Procurement Management Office (PrMO), one major reason for the delay is the late retrieval of documents caused by delay also of acceptance from the suppliers and service providers’ end. Most of the suppliers would request for time extension before they finally accept the POs for them to secure first the assurance of their suppliers from Metro Manila or abroad to make the delivery. Seemingly, this process adds to the delay in the retrieval of the POs. 



On the observation that no notice of delivery of all procured items was made during the year, the Head of the Supply Office stated that the supply officers assigned in the different units or campuses are all aware of the subject COA regulation. However, consistency in performing this function was not fully observed during the year due to the following reasons. First, there were delays in the receipt of complete documents from BAC Office which resulted in inaccurate date of inspection by the inspector and acceptance by the Supply Officers. Second, there were instances when the Supply Office allowed the submission of the photocopy of PO/LO/Contract as advance copy to the Supply Office and said documents were used as the basis of the receipt of delivery. This is done particularly in case of catering services, printing services and accommodations in which the period to complete the documentation is very short. Third, due to lack of manpower and voluminous workload of the Supply Office, this regulation was overlooked. Lastly, as mentioned earlier, the circumstances brought about by pandemic have greatly affected almost all processes in the university, including that of the Supply Office.





10)	Significant delays in the procurement process 



		Annex C of the 2016 R-IRR of RA No. 9184, otherwise known as the Government Procurement Reform Act, summarizes the timelines in showing the recommended earliest possible time and maximum period allowed for the procurement of goods and services, infrastructure projects, and consulting services. 



		Section 32.4 of RA No. 9184 prescribes that the entire evaluation process for the procurement of Goods and Infrastructure Projects shall be completed within seven (7) calendar days from the deadline for receipt of proposals.

	

Further, Section 34.8 of the same RA on the post-qualification process shall be completed in not more than twelve (12) calendar days from the determination of the Lowest Calculated Bid/Highest Rated Bid. In exceptional cases, the post-qualification period may be extended by the HoPE, but in no case shall the aggregate period exceed forty-five (45) calendar days for Goods and Infrastructure Projects, or thirty (30) calendar days in Consulting Services.



		Section 37.1.2 also states that within a period not exceeding fifteen (15) calendar days from the determination by the BAC of the bidder with the LCRB, HRRB, SCRB, or SRRB, and the recommendation to award the contract, the HoPE or his duly authorized representative shall approve or disapprove the said recommendation.



		Moreover, Section 37.1.6 indicates that the BAC, through the Secretariat, shall post, within three (3) calendar days from its issuance, the Notice of Award in the PhilGEPS, the website of the Procuring Entity, if any, and any conspicuous place in the premises of the Procuring Entity.

While	Section 37.2.1 on the contract signing, provides that the winning bidder shall post the required Performance Security and enter into a contract with the Procuring Entity within ten (10) calendar days from receipt by the winning bidder of the Notice of Award. 



		We have evaluated the procurement of projects for CY 2020 including two projects with bid openings dated September 18, 2019, and October 7, 2019, but subsequently awarded in CY 2020 and noted significant delays in the procurement process. The total processing time from the date of Purchase Request (PR) and Program of Work (POW) to the date of issuance of Notice to Proceed (NTP) registered delays that ranged from eight to 95 days. We have considered excluding the delay incurred for the period covering March 16, 2020 to May 15, 2020, due to the declaration of ECQ brought by the COVID-19 pandemic.

  	Inquiry with the procurement personnel and the BAC revealed that the delay in the procurement process was due to the infrequent follow-ups by the end-users of the projects procured, the necessity to secure the prior approval of the Board of Regents for the procurement of projects and inaccessibility of Philippine Government Electronic Procurement System (PhilGEPS) website due to the unstable network connections caused by unforeseeable events such as typhoon. 



The long period of action on procurement activities delayed the delivery of goods and services that might hamper the effectiveness of government operations due to the unavailability of goods/services when urgently needed. Likewise, the delay in posting to PhilGEPS of Notice of Award will deter in promoting transparency and efficiency in government procurement in accordance with the IRR of RA No. 9184.



We recommended that Management:



a)	Evaluate in what processes the significant delays occurred in the procurement activities/process in coordination with the concerned Offices and institute improvements at the soonest possible time to achieve efficient delivery of goods and services; and



b)	Require the BAC and the personnel involved in the procurement of goods and infrastructure projects of the University to be mindful of the prescribed timelines set by RA No. 9184.



Management Comment:



In the letter dated May 27, 2020, BAC Chairman offered the following explanation for the noted delays:



a)	Lack of manpower in the BAC Infra Secretariat

b)	System maintenance of PhilGEPS

c)	Exceptional circumstances brought about by COVID-19, such as lockdowns, quarantine of personnel

d)	Limited mobility of personnel due to COVID-19



He also commented that the BAC noted the findings and the recommendations mentioned and hereby undertakes to strictly follow the timelines set forth in the IRR of RA No. 9184 in order to promote good governance, transparency, equity and economy in the procurement process.





11)	Various lapses were noted on the documentation of some of the procured projects during CY 2020.



Sections 4 (6) and 4 (7) of PD No. 1445 mandates that claims against government funds shall be supported with complete documentation and that all laws and regulations applicable to financial transactions shall be faithfully adhered to.



Section 13.1 of the R-IRR of RA No. 9184 pertains to the observers that to enhance the transparency of the process, the BAC shall, during the eligibility checking, shortlisting, pre-bid conference, preliminary examination of bids, bid evaluation, and post-qualification, invite, in addition to the representative of the COA, at least two (2) observers, who shall not have the right to vote, to sit in its proceedings where:



1)	At least one (1) shall come from a duly recognized private group in a sector or discipline relevant to the procurement at hand, for example:

a)	For Infrastructure Projects, national associations of constructors duly recognized by the Construction Industry Authority of the Philippines (CIAP), such as but not limited to the following:

1)	Philippine Constructors Association, Inc.; or

2)	National Constructors Association of the Philippines, Inc.

b)	For Goods, a specific relevant chamber-member of the Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

c)	For Consulting Services, a project-related professional organization accredited or duly recognized by the Professional Regulation Commission or the Supreme Court, such as, but not limited to:

1)	Philippine Institute of Civil Engineers (PICE);

2)	Philippine Institute of Certified Public Accountants (PICPA); or

3)	Confederation of Filipino Consulting Organizations; and



2)	The other observer shall come from a non-government organization (NGO).



Section 13.3 of the same RA states that the observers shall be invited at least five (5) calendar days before the date of the procurement stage/activity. The absence of observers will not nullify the BAC proceedings: provided that they have been duly invited in writing. The Procuring Entities should ensure that the invitation is received at least five (5) calendar days before each procurement activity. In the event that a procurement activity has to be postponed, the observers shall be notified immediately of the change in schedule.



Likewise, Section 23.4.1.3 states that the prospective bidder must have completed, within the period specified in the Invitation to Bid, an SLCC that is similar to the contract to be bid, and whose value, adjusted to current prices using the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) consumer price indices, must be at least fifty percent (50%) of the ABC. 

Under Section 23.4.1.4 of the same RA shows the computation of a prospective bidder’s NFCC must be at least equal to the ABC to be bid, calculated as follows: NFCC = [(Current assets minus current liabilities) (15)] minus the value of all outstanding or uncompleted portions of the projects under ongoing contracts, including awarded contracts yet to be started, coinciding with the contract to be bid. The values of the domestic bidder’s current assets and current liabilities shall be based on the latest Audited Financial Statements submitted to the BIR.



		In our review of the documentary requirements in the procurement of projects submitted to this office, we have found out that the invitations to at least two observers from the prescribed different sectors duly received as evidence were not included as attachment, aside from the invitation to COA. We have also noted that the notice of post-qualification of the bidder with the lowest calculated bid/highest rated bid was not attached. Non-inclusion of these notices and invitations cast doubt on the compliance of the University to this basic requirement which aims to promote transparency of the procurement process.



Further, we have found out that some documents included as an attachment to the corresponding procurement projects contain insufficient data and were not properly filled out. There was also a discrepancy in the Statement of Single Largest Completed Contract (SLCC) on the specification in the Invitation to Bid and the NFCC on one project, as follows:



No.

Supply, Delivery, and Installation of Laboratory Furniture- BUCS

--	No date indicated for the post-qualification period

--	SLCC is doubtful due to a discrepancy in the specified cover period of Invitation to Bid. As per ITB, SLCC must be completed within the last 2 years. On the SLCC, the date of completion was September 29, 2019, but the supporting Sales Invoice was dated September 29, 2016.

Letters requesting the submission of the lacking supporting documents for project nos. 3 to 5 have been transmitted to the University to complete its technical and auditorial review.



The noted deficiencies affected the regularity and propriety of the foregoing procurement transactions.



We recommended that Management:



	a)	Direct the BAC and the Accountant to cause the immediate submission of the lacking supporting documents to avoid possible suspension and/or disallowance in audit;



	b)	Direct the BAC and Accountants to ensure the completeness and accuracy of the data contained in the supporting documents of every procurement transaction before the Accountant process its payment; and



	c)	Instruct the BAC to strictly comply with the provisions of RA No. 9184 to ensure the regularity of the bidding process conducted by the University.



Management Comment:



In the letter dated May 27, 2020, BAC Chairman committed to submit the requested lacking documents.





Review of Financial Statement



12)	Inadequate disclosures and unreconciled figures were noted in the Year-end Financial Statements. 



IPSAS requires financial statements to present fairly the financial position, financial performance, and cash flows of an entity. The application of IPSASs, with additional disclosures when necessary, is presumed to result in financial statements that achieve a fair presentation. (Par. 27, IPSAS 1).



The notes to financial statements (NFS) shall provide additional information that is not presented on the face of the Statement of Financial Position (SFP), Statement of Financial Performance (SFPer), Statement of Changes in Net Assets/Equity (SCNAE), and Statement of Cash Flows (SCF), but that is relevant to an understanding of any of them. (Par. 127, IPSAS 1).



Likewise, the same standards require an entity to correct material prior period errors retrospectively, subject to limitations, in the first set of financial statements authorized for issue after their discovery by (1) restating the comparative amounts for the prior period(s) presented in which the error occurred; or (2.) if the error occurred before the earliest prior period presented, restating the opening balances of assets, liabilities and net assets/equity for the earliest prior period presented. (Par. 47, IPSAS 3).



In applying the above standards, the entity has to disclose the following:



a)	The nature of the prior period error;

b)	For each prior period presented, to the extent practicable, the amount of the correction for each financial statement line item affected;

c)	The amount of the correction at the beginning of the earliest prior period presented; and

d)	If retrospective restatement is impracticable for a particular prior period, the circumstances that led to the existence of that condition and a description of how and from when the error has been corrected. (Par. 54, IPSAS 3)



Our review of the year-end financial statements for CY 2020 of the University disclosed the following observations:



a)	Statement of Changes in Net Assets/Equity reported significant Prior period errors totaling ₱31.94 million. The comparative amounts of the affected accounts from the prior year should have been restated to enhance the comparatively of financial information of both periods. 



b)	Unreconciled Total Revenue reported under Statement of Financial Performance and FAR No. 5

The existence of the foregoing deficiencies affects the fair presentation of the University’s financial statements. It also does not ensure users complete and relevant information on which to base their fiscal decisions.



We recommended and Management agreed to restate the financial statements when necessary and see to it that accurate and sufficient financial information are disclosed in the Notes to FS.





Fund Utilization



13)	The combined percentage rate of obligations and disbursements for specific and off-budget funds at 82.89 per cent and 90.08 per cent, respectively, with zero utilization rates for trust funds, indicated a reasonable but not remarkable capability of the University to implement its programs, projects, and activities (PPAs). 



Executive Order (EO) No. 91 series of 2019 prescribes the adoption of a cash budgeting system beginning the fiscal year 2019. This order was issued due to the increasing need to improve fiscal planning by government agencies and to speed up the implementation of government projects. Consequently, under Section 1 of the said EO, all authorized appropriations shall be available for obligation and disbursements only until the end of each fiscal year. 



For CY 2020, RA No. 11464 dated December 20, 2019 was issued to extend the availability of 2019 appropriations up to the end of December 2020. 



Likewise, RA No. 11465 dated January 6, 2020, was enacted appropriating funds for the operation of the Philippine Government for CY 2020. Under this Act, the University was provided a total appropriation of at least ₱1 billion to support human capital development which is one of the four priorities of the 2020 Budget. With the passing, however, of the RA No. 11469 or the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act, the current budget of the University has been reduced to at most ₱888.00 million due to the transfers made in line with that Act.

As gleaned from the above table, despite the adverse effect of the COVID-19, the University was able to utilize most of its allotments from the current and continuing appropriations but not that much accomplishment for its off-budget funds. 



Further review of the BFARs disclosed that at least ₱94.08 million worth of capital expenditure projects programmed for CY 2020 remain unimplemented.

This is to update the prior year’s observation of the Audit Team.



The above information did not include the fund utilization for trust receipts pending the submission of FAR 6 - Statement of Approved Budget, Utilizations, Disbursement, and Balances for Trust Receipts for the quarter ending December 31, 2020. 



Nevertheless, even in the year-end Agency Performance Review, the University also reported a very low budget utilization rate from its income receipts due allegedly to sudden change of prices, delay in the delivery, and lack of personnel at the Procurement Management Office.

		The above figures showed that the funds of the University were not fully maximized and the planned PPAs for the year were not completely attained.



We recommended and Management agreed to undertake the following courses of action:



	a)	Cause the submission of FAR 6 for December 31, 2020, and for succeeding quarters, within 30 days after the end of each quarter along with other BFARs as mandated;



	b)	Revisit the existing procurement process to avoid delay and to expedite implementation of the University’s PPA; and



	c)	Devise a definite catch-up plan to improve the utilization of its fund allocation under the new normal setting.

	

	

	Gender and Development (GAD)

	

14)	The reported accomplishments of the Agency relative to GAD, which pertain only to the 11 out of the 21 colleges of the University, did not meet the required outputs.  Moreover, a comprehensive evaluation and assessment of the GAD plan and accomplishments could not be conducted. 



Section 31 of the General Provision of the GAA for FY 2020 mandated all agencies of the government to formulate a GAD Plan designed to address gender issues within their concerned sectors or mandate and implement the applicable provisions under RA No. 9710 of the Magna Carta of Women, Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, The Beijing Platform for Action, The Philippine Plan for Gender-Responsive Development (1995-2025) and the Philippine Development Plan (2011-2016).



The GAD Plan shall be integrated with the regular activities of the agencies, which shall be at least five per cent of their budgets.  



Item 4.1 of Philippine Commission on Women (PCW) Memorandum Circular No. 2020-03 enjoins all national government agencies to review and revise, as necessary, their FY 2020 Gender and Development Plan and Budget to implement measures to address gender issues and concerns arising from the unequal status of their women and men stakeholders due to the COVID-19 situation. Such measures should be in line with their respective agency mandates, RA No. 9710 or the Magna Carta of Women and the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act. Relative thereto, agencies shall observe several measures that include:



		1)	Disaggregate data related to the COVID-19 situation such as deployed personnel, program/project beneficiaries, and stakeholders by sex, age, disability, and other relevant status to be able to analyze gendered differences and inform decision making and program implementation; 

		2)	X

	

		The Commission on Audit, in line with its mandate, issued COA Circular 2014-01dated March 18, 2014, prescribing the revised guidelines in the audit of GAD Funds and Activities.



For CY 2020, the University had allocated funds for GAD activities at a rate exceeding the required percentage as presented below:



GAD Budget (Original)

-

₱76,814,000.00 

Agency GAD Budget (Revised)

Further, scrutiny of the submitted lists of the Annual GAD Expenses by the Accounting Offices and individual Statement of Appropriations, Allotments, Obligations, Disbursements, and Balances (SAAODB) attributed for GAD by the Budget Offices showed a very low utilization rate as consolidated below:

The data pertains only to the 11 colleges/campuses/units. It does not include the data from the following 12 colleges/campuses/units due to its inability to submit SAAODB for GAD: BUCAF, BUCENG, BUCIT, BUIA, BUGC, BUGS, BUOU, BUCL, JMRIGD, RDMD, STO, and BUCM.



Based on the above information, the total obligated amount of ₱1.88 million for GAD purposes represents only 25.72 per cent of the above total allotment received for GAD. Also, the total cost incurred reported by the Accounting offices is equivalent only to 43.83 per cent of the total obligations, thereby, resulting in poor utilization of the GAD funds.



It was also observed that the disaggregated data provided in the GPBs were limited to the genders of the intended program beneficiaries. Some of the Harmonized Gender and Development Guidelines (HGDG) tools used to attribute programs and other gender analysis tools were also not made available for verification to the audit team.



Comprehensive evaluation and assessment of the GAD plan and accomplishments cannot be easily made due to lack of gender statistics, disaggregated data, and documents showing results of gender analysis made. This deficiency raised doubts about whether the GAD programs and activities implemented during the year have addressed the actual and real gender gaps and issues presently faced by the women and men employees of the University and its clients.



We recommended and Management agreed that the GAD Focal Point System (GFPS):



	a)	Set up sufficient GAD Database and/or disaggregated data that will facilitate identification of existing gender gaps and issues present in the University, thus, enable them to formulate GAD plans and programs that are relevant, necessary, and accordingly accomplish them; and 



	b)	Ensure that GPB and GAD AR are duly supported with the reports and documents that could facilitate the conduct of an audit of the funds outlined under COA Circular No. 2014-01.



15)	The University continues to include the costs for Contingency Fund in the GPB and GAD AR. 



Item IV (B), paragraph (1) of COA Circular No. 2014-001 dated March 18, 2014, on the Specific Guidelines in the Financial and Compliance Audit on GAD, states that the audit of specific accounts on GAD (salaries, wages, expenditures, etc.) shall be in accordance with existing guidelines on financial and compliance audit. In particular, the rules and regulations on irregular, unnecessary, excessive, extravagant, and unconscionable expenditures shall be observed.



Annex A of PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01 provides the guide in completing the GAD Plan & Budget Template wherein under Column 7 thereof under GAD Budget, it enumerated expenses that cannot be charged to the GAD budget. Among which is the provision for contingency funds or "other services" for programs, activities, or projects.



This is a reiteration of the previous year’s audit finding. 

 

Our verification disclosed that the GPBs and GAD ARs of BUCGAD and BUCENG continue to include the costs for Contingency Fund as part of its budgetary requirements for certain GAD activities, as follows:

Inclusion of the above Contingency Fund as part of the cost of the GAD activities instead of reporting them under other funds resulted in the overstatement of the reported GAD expenditures.



We reiterated the previous year’s recommendation that the Director of CGAD reminds its GAD Coordinators to refrain from including prohibited expenses in its GPB and GAD AR specifically enumerated under PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01.

	

Management Comment:



		The GFPS and the BU Management will do its best to comply with the necessary output, i.e. having GAD expenditures equivalent to at least five per cent of the total University budget, through:

a)	Conducting research and establishing of GAD Database and/or disaggregated data. To date, the BUCGAD had just finished drafting the Sex and Aged Disaggregated Data (SADD) Survey Form to be released this year for approval and implementation of the BU Administration/CGAD; and



b)	Constant reminder to the BU Administration/Officials in the proper fora (e.g. University and GAD budget planning workshops) to allot at least five per cent of the total University budget for GAD, and for speedy and timely implementation of the GAD plans, activities and projects to meet the required output, as well as reporting of GAD AR with supporting documents. It has to be noted on one hand that the COVID-19 pandemic and community restrictions greatly impacted on the implementation of the GAD plans. Nevertheless, the GAD coordinators were already informed about the AOM, and were asked to reply and submit necessary documents.



			Management already reiterated to the respective GAD coordinators to refrain from including expenses in the GAD activities and AR those that are not allowed by the aforementioned Circular. If there were still inclusions as in the case of BUCGAD, the said contingency fund (perhaps a typographical error) was not in any way used.

The beginning balance of suspended transactions refers to the eight issued NS during the years 2011 to 2013. The monitoring report of the previous Audit Team revealed that the two NS issued in 2013 with the unsettled balance of ₱22,068.08 was for correction as these had been settled in full by Management. Adjustments will be made by the present Audit Team when corresponding files had been located and verified. 



The remaining unsettled six suspensions pertain to the payment of honoraria, professional fees of Board of Regents, and wages of contractual. Considering the lapse of time, these suspended transactions may have matured into disallowance. Notice of disallowance shall be issued when the received copies of NS had been located and duly verified by the present Audit Team. 



The above suspension issued during the year refers to the total costs of four infrastructure projects with lacking supporting documents prescribed under Section 301 of PD 1096 and Annex G of the Revised IRR of RA No. 9184. These were all settled by December 2020 upon verification of the submitted documents.



As to the beginning balance of disallowed transactions, it pertains to 13 issued NDs during the years 2011 to 2014. Four of these NDs totaling ₱729,084.37 have a pending appeal filed with the Commission. The remaining nine NDs refer to the disallowed COLA in 2011 and refund of 10 percent retention in 2012. The monitoring report of the previous audit team disclosed that the payment of these NDs is ongoing. However, an inquiry with the present University Accountant revealed that he has no idea on the status of the subject NDs because documents related to the transactions were not turned over to him by the previous Accountant. A detailed list of the NS and ND for settlement by Management will be provided to the University Accountant to facilitate the enforcement of the suspension and disallowance.
