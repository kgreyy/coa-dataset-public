C)	Scope of Audit and Objectives 



The audit covered the accounts, transactions and operations of PCAF for CY 2020. The audit was conducted to (a) ascertain the level of assurance that may be placed on the management’s assertions on the financial statements; (b) determine the propriety of transactions as well as extent of compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations; (c) recommend agency’s improvement opportunities; and (d) determine the extent of implementation of prior year’s audit recommendations.

		

D)	Independent Auditor’s Report

Also, there were still unliquidated cash advances in prior years amounting to ₱4.565 million or 53.94 percent of prior years’ balance of ₱8.463 million.   (Observation No. 5)



We recommended and Management agreed to continue sending demand letters to the officers and employees and AOs with unliquidated balances and require them to fully settle the cash advances.



	2)		Fund transfers to implementing agencies and NGOs/POs during the year for the implementation of the agency’s projects amounting to ₱28.532 million were not fully liquidated as of year-end, contrary to COA Circular Nos. 94-013 and 2007-001 dated December 31, 1994 and October 25, 2007, respectively.  Likewise, there were still unliquidated fund transfers in prior years amounting to ₱1,475.181 million or 98.94 percent of prior year’s balance of ₱1,490.909 million.(Observation No. 6)



        We reiterated our recommendations and Management agreed to: 



a)	periodically send confirmation and demand letters to the IAs and NGOs/POs concerned and require them to submit immediately the reports on the utilization of funds and return any unexpended/unutilized funds for completed projects;



b)	stop  the grant of additional funds to the IAs unless the previous funds transferred to them were accounted for or fully liquidated; and



c)	strictly enforce the provisions in the MOA on the submission of periodic reports of disbursements and refund of unutilized funds.



	3)		Fund transfers to Procurement Service-Department of Budget and Management (PS-DBM) during the year for the procurement of common office supplies, equipment and airline tickets amounting to ₱9.018 million or 100 percent of the funds transferred were not liquidated, contrary to COA Circular No. 94-013.  Also, there were still unliquidated fund transfers in prior years of ₱20.288 million or 96.18 percent of prior year’s balance of ₱21.092 million. (Observation No. 7)



        We reiterated our recommendations and Management agreed to: 

                

a)	direct the Accountant and Procurement Officer to closely coordinate with the PS-DBM for the: i) reconciliation for the undelivered goods to be delivered; ii) replacement of the undelivered goods and services with new items; and/or iii) refund of any excess balance; and 



b)	stop the transfer of funds to the PS-DBM unless the previous fund transfers were liquidated/utilized for the procurement of supplies and materials.



	4)		Dormant unliquidated cash advances and fund transfers amounting to ₱1,144.663 million were not requested for write-off as required under Section 8.2 of COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016. (Observation No. 8)



      We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to:



a)	monitor the settlement of the dormant accounts and continue coordinating with Regional Accountants for the submission of liquidation reports; and



b)	exhaust possible means to gather and complete the documents and information related to the dormant accounts and conduct a thorough review and evaluation of the same and request for authority for their write-off after complying with the documentary requirements prescribed under COA Circular No. 2016-005.



	5)		Unserviceable property with book value of ₱2.081 million remained not disposed of, contrary to Section 79 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445, thus, exposing them to loss, destruction and further deterioration and decreasing their realizable value.  (Observation No. 10)

		

We reiterated our recommendation and Management agreed to require the Chief of General Services Section and Disposal Committee to immediately initiate disposal proceedings of the unserviceable PPE in accordance with existing rules and regulations to avoid loss ,destruction and further deterioration and decrease in their realizable value and provide storage areas for other property. 



	6)		The agency allocated ₱3.000 million or 1.25 percent only which is less than five percent of its appropriation of ₱239.381 million for GAD programs and related activities, inconsistent with Section 31 of RA  No. 11465 or the General Appropriations Act (GAA) for FY 2020.   Moreover,  GAD Plan and Budget/Accomplishment Report were not submitted to the Auditor, hence, hindered the determination of whether the PCAF has complied with existing rules and regulations on gender and development and if funds were indeed allocated and properly utilized for the purpose. (Observation No. 18)



    We recommended and Management agreed to:

	

a)	allocate at least five percent of the Agency’s appropriation for the conduct of GAD-related programs, projects and activities to maximize the agency’s contribution towards the attainment of the GAD intended purpose or objectives; and 

	

b)	instruct the GAD Focal Person to strictly adhere to the deadlines set on the timely submission of GPB and AR with financial details to the Audit Team once approved/endorsed by the PCW.

F)	Enforcement of Settlement of Accounts



Of the ₱108.838 million audit disallowance for prior years, only ₱1.163 million was settled, due to lax enforcement by management of full settlement of disallowance within the six-month period as prescribed under Section 10.4 of COA Circular 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009, while no settlement was made on the prior year’s suspension of ₱37.673 million, leaving unsettled suspensions and disallowances amounting to ₱146.334 as of year-end including the Notice of Suspension (NS) amounting to ₱0.986 million  issued during the year..
