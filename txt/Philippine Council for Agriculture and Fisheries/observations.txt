PART II – OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



A)	Financial Audit



Unadjusted accounting errors/omissions and uncorrected accounting deficiencies



1)		A qualified opinion was rendered on the financial statements due to the accounting errors/omissions amounting to ₱1.632 million and accounting deficiencies with an aggregate amount of ₱140.886 million which prevented alternative audit procedures to be undertaken to obtain sufficient and appropriate evidence relating to various assertions on the accounts.



Section 27 of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) 1 provides that “Financial statements shall present fairly the financial position; financial performance, and cash flow of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in IPSASs.”



Accounting errors/omissions amounting to ₱1.632 million were not adjusted and corrected, which did not affect the reported total Assets, Liabilities, and Net Assets/Equity amounting to ₱1,709.540 million, ₱480.266 million and ₱1,229.274 million, respectively:

	Moreover, the non-maintenance of subsidiary ledgers and lack of complete accounting records on four accounts with an aggregate amount of ₱140.886 million prevented alternative audit procedures to be undertaken to obtain sufficient and appropriate evidence relating to various assertions on the accounts:

	In view of the non-maintenance of subsidiary ledgers and lack of complete accounting records on four accounts with an aggregate amount of ₱140.886 million, a qualified opinion was rendered on the Financial Statements.



We reiterated our recommendation and Management agreed to require the Chief Accountant to effect the necessary correction on the deficiencies observed and adjustments on the errors/omissions with the corresponding supporting documents.



B)	Compliance with Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements



High fund utilization/obligation rate



2)	Overall, the agency’s fund utilization/obligation of ₱148.603 million is 95.41 percent compared to its appropriation/allotment of ₱155.756 million with unutilized appropriation/allotment of ₱7.153 million  as a result of  the adoption of economy measures to respond to the crisis brought about by the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) wherein government instrumentalities concerned were advised that at least ten percent (10%) of the total released allotments for Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses and Capital Outlays shall no longer be available for obligation. Also, it registered a utilization rate of 95.40 percent for its major program, Agriculture and Fishery Policy Services, which were in accordance with the purpose of appropriation/allotment.



Cash utilization/disbursements



3)	Of the total cash allocation of ₱147.376 million received during the year, 95.68 percent or ₱141.014 million was utilized/disbursed for its lone program which is the Agriculture and Fishery Policy Services. The balance of ₱6.362 million was automatically reverted to the National Treasury in accordance with Section 3.4.5 of the National Budget Circular No. 578 dated January 6, 2020.

  

Reversion of dormant cash, unauthorized accounts and unnecessary fund



4)	The agency has no dormant cash, unauthorized accounts, unnecessary special and trust funds and related accounts for reversion as of year-end, in conformity with Permanent Committee Joint Circular No. 4-2012, dated September 11, 2012, implementing EO No. 431, dated May 30, 2005. All fees, charges, assessments, and other receipts or revenues collected, trust receipts and performance bonds and deposits, among others, except as unauthorized by law to be returned by the agency for its use, were deposited/remitted to the National Treasury pursuant to Section 4 to 14 of the General Provisions of the FY 2020 GAA (Receipts and Income).



Non-liquidation of cash advances



5)	Cash advance for special purpose/time-bound undertakings amounting to ₱0.004 million or 0.12 percent of the cash advances granted during the year amounting to ₱3.215 million was not liquidated, contrary to COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997.  Also, there were still unliquidated cash advances in prior years amounting to ₱4.565 million or 53.94 percent of prior years’ balance of ₱8.463 million.

 Note:  There was an adjustment of ₱0.021 million in the advances for payroll granted in CY 2019 bringing to ₱0.836 million the total unliquidated balances, which was forwarded in the GL of CY 2020.



There were no cash advances granted during the year for operating expenses, payroll and to officers and employees.  The cash advances granted in CY 2019 for payroll of contractual and job order personnel and to officers and employees for official local travels were fully liquidated in CY 2020.  Of the cash advances granted to Special Disbursing Officers for special purpose/ time-bound undertakings during the year amounting to ₱3.215 million, only ₱0.004 or 0.12 percent remained unliquidated. 



Except for the unliquidated balance of ₱0.004 million which is aged 36 days, the above cash advances were liquidated upon completion of the activities/purpose for which they were given and the unused balances were refunded by the Accountable Officers (AOs) within the prescribed period as required in the rules and regulations on the grant and liquidation of cash advances, which are provided under COA Circular Nos. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 and 97-002 dated February 10, 1997.  



Meanwhile, the prior years’ unliquidated balances of Advances for Operating Expenses and Advances to Officers and Employees in the amount of ₱1.341 million and ₱3.236 million, respectively, pertain to cash advances granted from CYs 1980 to 2006 and have been dormant for ten to 40 years, to various officers and employees and AOs of the then National Agricultural and Fishery Council (NAFC) and Livestock Development Council (LDC) which were merged in CY 2014,  now known as PCAF, and Regional Directors of the Department of Agriculture (DA) Regional Field Offices who are no longer connected with the Department and PCAF due to retirement, resignation, or transfer of office.   



The accumulation of unliquidated balances in prior years were due to the granting of additional cash advances to officers, employees and AOs even if their previous cash advances were not yet liquidated, laxity in sending demand letters to officers, employees and AOs with unliquidated balances and non-monitoring by Management on the submission of liquidation reports within the prescribed period which are not compliant with COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997, which provides among others, that:



--	No additional cash advances shall be allowed to any official or employee unless the previous cash advance given to him is first settled or a proper accounting thereof is made. 



--	A cash advance shall be reported on as soon as the purpose for which it was given has been served. 



--	All cash advances shall be fully liquidated at the end of each year. Except for petty cash fund, the AO shall refund any unexpended balance to the Cashier/Collecting Officer who will issue the necessary official receipt.



--	The AO shall liquidate his cash advance as follows: 



--	Salaries, Wages, etc. - within five (5) days after each fifteen (15) day/end of the month pay period



--	Official Travel - within sixty (60) days after return to the Philippines in the case of foreign travel or within thirty (30) days after return to his permanent official station in the case of local travel.   



Likewise, Section 4.1.3(ix) of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 provides that, “Cash advance for special time-bound undertaking shall be liquidated by the AO concerned within one month from the date the purpose of the cash advance was accomplished.”



It is noteworthy to mention that the liquidation rate of cash advances during the year of 99.87 percent is higher compared to 76.37 percent in CY 2019.  



We recommended and Management agreed to continue sending demand letters to the officers and employees and AOs with unliquidated balances and require them to fully settle the cash advances.



Non-liquidation of fund transfers to implementing agencies 



6)	Fund transfers to implementing agencies and NGOs/POs during the year for the implementation of the agency’s projects amounting to ₱28.532 million were not fully liquidated as of year-end, contrary to COA Circular Nos. 94-013 and 2007-001 dated December 31, 1994 and October 25, 2007, respectively.  Likewise, there were still unliquidated fund transfers in prior years amounting to ₱1,475.181 million or 98.94 percent of prior year’s balance of ₱1,490.909 million. 



COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 31, 1994 sets forth the rules in the grant, utilization and liquidations of funds transferred to implementing agencies.  Section 4.6 thereof states that within ten (10) days after the end of each month or end of the prescribed timeline, the IAs shall submit to the Source Agency (SA) the Report of Checks Issued and the Report of Disbursement to report the utilization of the funds.  Likewise, Section 4.9 thereof provides that the IA shall return to the SA any unused balance upon completion of the project.



COA Circular No. 2007-001 dated October 25, 2007 provides the revised guidelines in the granting, utilization, accounting and auditing of the funds released to NGOs/POs.  Section 5.4 of the said circular states that: “Within sixty (60) days after the completion of the project, the NGO/PO shall submit the final Fund Utilization Report certified by its Accountant and approved by its President/Chairman to the government organization (GO), together with the inspection report and certificate of project completion rendered/issued by the GO authorized representative, list of beneficiaries with their acceptance/acknowledgement of the project/ funds/ goods/ services received. The validity of these documents shall be verified by the internal auditor or equivalent official of the GO and shall be the basis of the GO in recording the fund utilization in its books of accounts. These documents shall support the liquidation of funds granted to the NGO/PO.”



The status of fund transfers to Implementing Agencies [National Government Agencies (NGAs), Local Government Units (LGUs) and Government Owned and/or Controlled Corporations (GOCCs)] and Non-Governmental Organizations/People's Organizations (NGOs/POs) and liquidations thereof in CY 2020 is shown as follows:

Records showed that during the year, PCAF has transferred funds to various IAs for the implementation of its programs and projects in the total amount ₱28.532 million, of which, ₱27.269 million or 95.58 percent were for NGAs.



The Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) entered into by and between the PCAF and recipient NGAs provides that the funds given to them were for the conduct of Agricultural and Fisheries Council (AFC), monitoring of various DA and PCAF-assisted projects/activities including the validation of Civil Society Organization (CSO) accreditation, Registry System for Basic Sectors in Agriculture and other similar initiatives and activities. 



It is also provided in the MOA that the IA shall submit a periodic Disbursement Report, including the Monitoring Reports and Physical Accomplishment Report, and to return or refund immediately to PCAF any unused funds at the end of December 31, 2020. 



Likewise, the MOA executed by and between PCAF and recipient LGU states that the LGU shall submit physical accomplishment reports and expenditure/liquidation report and failure to do so will result in the non-release of subsequent funds to them.



As can be gleaned from the data in the table above, there was a very low percentage of liquidation of fund transfers during the year of 26 percent or ₱0.074 million only, while for prior years, only 1.05 percent or ₱15.728 million were liquidated, thus, leaving a huge amount of unliquidated balance as of year-end of ₱1,503.639 million. 

  	The existence of long outstanding balances of fund transfers can be attributed to the laxity of Management in the:



	a)	granting of additional fund transfers despite the non-liquidation of previous ones and non-immediate refund of unused funds at the end of the year; 

	b)	monitoring of liquidation reports; and

	c)	implementation or enforcement of the provisions in the MOA, particularly in the accounting and/or liquidation of fund transfer and immediate refund of unused funds.



Comparison of liquidation of fund transfers showed a much lower liquidation rate of one percent during the year versus the liquidation rate of 2.90 percent in CY 2019.



We reiterated our recommendations and Management agreed to: 



a)	periodically send confirmation and demand letters to the IAs and NGOs/POs concerned and require them to submit immediately the reports on the utilization of funds and return any unexpended/unutilized funds for completed projects;



b)	stop the grant of additional funds to the IAs unless the previous funds transferred to them were accounted for or fully liquidated; and



c)	strictly enforce the provisions in the MOA on the submission of periodic reports of disbursements and refund of unutilized funds.



Non-liquidation of fund transfers granted  to PS-DBM



7)	Fund transfers to Procurement Service-Department of Budget and Management (PS-DBM) during the year for the procurement of common office supplies, equipment and airline tickets amounting to ₱9.018 million or 100 percent of the funds transferred were not liquidated, contrary to COA Circular No. 94-013.  Also, there were still unliquidated fund transfers in prior years of ₱20.288 million or 96.18 percent of prior year’s balance of ₱21.092 million.



COA Circular No. 94-013 dated Dec. 13, 1994 sets forth the rules and regulations in the grant, utilization and liquidation of funds transferred to implementing agencies.  This is to ensure that the transfer is properly taken up in the books of the Source Agency (SA) and Implementing Agency (IA) and used only for the intended purpose and that proper accounting and reporting is made of the utilization of the funds.



The status of fund transfers to PS-DBM and liquidations as of December 31, 2020 is shown as follows:

During the year, the agency transferred funds to PS-DBM amounting to ₱9.018 million for the procurement of common-use office supplies and equipment, however, there were no deliveries made by the PS-DBM.  Moreover, out of the total undelivered supplies and equipment in prior years of ₱21.092 million, only ₱0.804 million or 3.81 percent were delivered, leaving an unliquidated amount of ₱20.288 million or 96.18 percent.



Despite the unliquidated amount and non-delivery of goods and services, the agency continued to transfer funds, which resulted in the ballooning and accumulation of outstanding balances. 



No periodic reconciliation of records was made between the PCAF and PS-DBM as evidenced by the accumulating unliquidated balances. Efforts made by the Accounting Section in CY 2019 to reconcile their records did not succeed due to lack of manpower on the part of PS-DBM and phone calls made in CY 2020 were also not answered by the latter.



Considering that the PCAF is not the only agency being served by the PS-DBM, it is therefore imperative upon the procuring agency to monitor the undelivered goods and services and initiate the reconciliation of records to determine if there were discrepancies between the account balances recorded in agency’s books and that of the records of PS-DBM.  



We reiterated our recommendations and Management agreed to: 



a)	direct the Accountant and Procurement Officer to closely coordinate with the PS-DBM for the: (i) reconciliation of the undelivered goods and services; (ii) replacement of undelivered goods and services with new items; and/or (iii) refund of any excess balance; and 



b)	stop the transfer of funds to the PS-DBM unless the previous fund transfers were liquidated/utilized for the procurement of supplies and materials.







Dormant receivables not requested for write-off



8)	Dormant unliquidated cash advances and fund transfers amounting to ₱1,144.663 million were not requested for write-off, as required under Section 8.2 of COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016.



COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016 provides the Guidelines and Procedures on the Write-off of Dormant Receivables account, Unliquidated Cash Advances, and Fund Transfers of National Government Agencies (NGAs), Local Government Units (LGUs) and Government-Owned and Controlled Corporations (GOCCs). It provides, among others, that “all government entities shall conduct regular monitoring and analysis/reconciliation of receivable accounts; x x x.”



Item 4.0 thereof provides the coverage  of the Circular which includes dormant receivables arising from regular trade and business transactions, claims from entities' officers and employees and other dormant receivable accounts; dormant unliquidated cash advances for operating expenses, payroll, special purpose/time-bound activities or undertakings and travel as well as advances granted to Civil Society Organizations (CSOs)/NGOs/POs; and dormant unliquidated fund transfers to/from NGAs, LGUs, and GOCCs.



Section 5.5 – “Dormant unliquidated cash advances - advances granted to disbursing officers, agency officers and employees which remained non-moving for ten (10) years or more and where settlement/collectability could no longer be ascertained.” 



Section 5.6 –“Dormant unliquidated fund transfers - advances granted by the source entity to implementing entity for the implementation of programs/ projects which remained non-moving for ten (10) years or more and where settlement could no longer be ascertained.”



Section 8.2 “The Head of the government entity shall file the request for authority to write-off dormant receivable accounts, unliquidated cash advances, and fund transfers to the COA Audit Team Leader (ATL) and/or Supervising Auditor (SA).”



Records showed that the PCAF has dormant unliquidated cash advances and fund transfers to NGAs, LGUs, GOCCs and NGOs/POs amounting to ₱1,144.663 million as of December 31, 2020, broken down as follows:

Inquiry disclosed that the details of the dormant accounts could no longer be determined partly due to the loss of pertinent records through the fire that gutted the then NAFC Building in CY 2010. 



In CY 2020, the management sent requests for write-off of dormant accounts but were returned without action as additional evidence and documents were required to support the said requests. 



As of to date, the new requests for authority to write-off the dormant unliquidated cash advances and fund transfers were not made, contrary to COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016. 



The Accountant also informed that demand letters were sent to IAs and accountable officers with outstanding balances of cash advances, particularly to those who are no longer connected with the agency, but the same were returned without reply since the addressees could no longer be located in their last given addresses.  They are continuously coordinating with the Regional Accountants for the submission of liquidation reports.



The existence of dormant accounts for ten years and over indicates management’s inadequate monitoring of the settlement of the accounts.



This is a reiteration of prior years’ audit observation which remained not acted upon.



We reiterated our recommendations and Management agreed to require the Accountant to:



a)	monitor the settlement of the dormant accounts and continue coordinating with Regional Accountants for the submission of liquidation reports; and



b)	exhaust possible means to gather and complete the documents and information related to the dormant accounts and conduct a thorough review and evaluation of the same and request for authority for their write-off after complying with the documentary requirements prescribed under COA Circular No. 2016-005.



Insurance of physical assets with GSIS



9)	The agency insured with the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) property amounting to ₱81.784 million with corresponding insurance premiums paid in the amount of ₱0.266 million, in accordance with Republic Act (R.A.) No. 656, otherwise known as the “Property Insurance Law”, as amended by PD No. 245 dated July 13, 1973.



Non-disposal of unserviceable property



10)	Unserviceable property with book value of ₱2.081 million remained not disposed of, contrary to Section 79 of PD No. 1445, thus, exposing them to loss, destruction and further deterioration and decreasing their realizable value.  



Review of the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) as of December 31, 2020 showed unserviceable PPE with book value of ₱2.081 million, as follows:

The List of Unserviceable PPE provided by the General Services Section showed that these property were unserviceable since September 2018 but remained not disposed of up to the present. No request for disposal of the same was made during the year. 



Copy of memorandum dated September 3, 2019 provided by the General Services Section, showed that request for the conduct of bidding for the unserviceable property was made by the then Chairperson of Disposal Committee to the Chairperson of Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) on Disposal; however, said request was not acted upon.  Allegedly, the documents forwarded to the BAC were misplaced by personnel in the said office and remain missing up to the present.  



Bidding for the said unserviceable property was again not undergone in CY 2020 due to the prolonged lockdowns brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic.  



The continued non-disposal of the unserviceable property exposes them to loss, destruction and will cause their further deterioration and consequently the depreciation of its value, contrary to Section 79 of P.D. No. 1445 which provides that:

	

“When government property has become unserviceable for any cause, or is no longer needed, it shall upon application of the officer accountable therefore, be inspected by the head of the agency or his duly authorized representative in the presence of the auditor concerned and, if found to be valueless or unsalable, it may be destroyed in their presence.  If found to be valuable, it may be sold at public auction to the highest bidder under the supervision of the proper committee on award or similar body in the presence of the auditor concerned or duly authorized representative of the Commission, after advertising by printed notice in the Official Gazette, or for not less than three consecutive days in any newspaper of general circulation, or where the value of the property does not warrant the expense of publication, by notices posted for a like period in at least three public places in the locality where the property is to be sold.  In the event that the public auction fails, the property may be sold at a private sale at such price as may be fixed by the same committee or body concerned and approved by the Commission.”



The timely and immediate disposal therefore will not only result in higher appraised value of the unserviceable property but will enable the storage areas that these occupied, available for other purposes.



We reiterated our recommendation and Management agreed to require the Chief of General Services Section and Disposal Committee to immediately initiate disposal proceedings of the unserviceable PPE in accordance with existing rules and regulations to avoid loss, destruction, further deterioration and decrease in their realizable value and provide storage areas for other property. 



Emergency Procurement Activities during a State of Calamity



11)	There were no procurement of goods and services through negotiated (emergency purchase) during the year.



Delayed/Non-submission of government contracts



12)	Copies of 62 government contracts and their supporting documents with corresponding amount of ₱26.089 million were not submitted within the prescribed period with delays ranging from two to 139 days, inconsistent with Items 3.1.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009.



Sec. 3.1.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-001 states that “Within five (5) working days from the execution of a contract by the government or any of its subdivisions, agencies or instrumentalities, xxx, a copy of said contract and each of all documents forming part thereof by reference or incorporation shall be furnished to the Auditor of the agency concerned.”



Copy of 62 approved contracts/Memoranda of Agreement (MOAs) with corresponding amount of ₱26.089 million were not furnished the Audit Team within five (5) working days from their execution, contrary to Item 3.1.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-001. Records showed that the MOAs were submitted with delays ranging from two to 139 days.

The delayed submission of the contracts/MOAs and the corresponding supporting documents prevented the audit team on the timely review, evaluation of compliance with requirements of rules and regulations, completeness of documentary requirements and initial evaluation that the contract is not disadvantageous to the government. 



According to Management, the lockdowns imposed during the Community Quarantine periods and the frequent suspensions of work in the agency due to increasing number of employees who tested positive of the corona virus and the disinfection of the PCAF building greatly affected the timely submission of copy of contracts to the Audit Team.



In CY 2020, copy of contracts/MOAs were already submitted to the Audit Team, although with delays due to the aforecited reasons, as compared with CY 2019 wherein none were submitted. This showed that there was improvement despite the  frequent lockdowns. Also, copy of Purchase Orders were submitted within the prescribed period in compliance with the recommendation in previous year.



This is a reiteration of prior years’ audit observation.



We reiterated our recommendation and Management agreed to ensure submission of government contracts/MOA for review to the audit team upon their approval within the prescribed period.



Withholding and remittance of GSIS contributions, loans and employer’s share



13)	The agency withheld and remitted the GSIS personal share and loans of employees amounting to ₱5.820 million and remitted intact the amount of ₱5.820 million, including the government’s share of ₱1.479 million in accordance with RA No. 8291, the GSIS Act of 1997.  However, some withheld contributions amounting to ₱0.360 million were not remitted within the prescribed period.  Moreover, the balance of ₱0.005 million pertaining to prior years remained unremitted and unreconciled as of year-end.

	

Section 14.1, Rule III of the IRR of R.A No. 8291 states that:  “Each government agency shall remit directly to the GSIS the employees’ and government agency’s contributions within the first ten (10) days of the calendar month following the month to which the contributions apply.  The remittance by the government agency of the contributions to the GSIS shall take priority over and above the payment of any and all obligations, except salaries and wages of its employees.”



Section 5 of RA No. 8291 dated May 30, 1997 otherwise known as “The Government Service Insurance System Act of 1997” provides that “It shall be mandatory and compulsory for all employers to include the payment of contributions in their annual appropriations.  Penal sanction shall be imposed upon employers who fail to include the payment of contributions in their annual appropriations or otherwise fail to remit the accurate/exact amount of contributions on time, or delay the remittance of premium contributions to the GSIS.  The heads of offices and agencies shall be administratively liable for non-remittance or delayed remittance of premium contributions to the GSIS.”

Further, the agency did not deduct or withhold the payment for loan amortization of its officials and employees for the months of April, May and June in accordance with the moratorium program set by the GSIS on all loan payments of its members and pensioners affected by the COVID 19.   Although deductions were already made for the month of April 2020, the withheld loan amortizations for the said month were refunded to the officials and employees of the agency.



Pursuant to R.A. No. 11469 entitled “Bayanihan to Heal as One Act” the GSIS issued Memorandum Circular No. 015, s. of 2020 which gives moratorium or deferment of payment of loan amortization due for the months of March, April and May 2020 and that payment shall resume on June 2020.  The moratorium was further extended to June 2020 to provide relief to many government employees and pensioners who are having financial difficulties brought by the COVID 19 crisis.



Moreover, the balance of ₱0.005 million pertains to prior years that remained unremitted and unreconciled as of year-end.  According to the Accountant, they are still in the process of identifying the employees with unremitted contributions/ payments and analyzing the details of the unremitted amount. 



The delayed/non-remittance of GSIS contributions could result in penal sanctions as provided for under Section 5 of R.A. 8291. The heads of offices and agencies shall be held liable for non-remittance or delayed remittance of premium contributions to GSIS.



We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to:

	

a)		observe the timely remittance of withheld personal share and contributions of officials and employees, as prescribed by the law; and

	

b)		analyze and reconcile the prior year’s balance of ₱0.005 million either for remittance to GSIS or refund to employees.

	

Withholding and Remittance of Pag-IBIG Contributions and Loans Amortizations



14)	The agency deducted and remitted intact the Pag-IBIG personal contributions and loans amortizations of employees for the year amounting to ₱1.489 million and the government’s share of ₱0.120 million, in accordance with RA No. 9679 (Home Development Mutual Fund Law of 2009).  However, the balance of ₱0.099 million representing withheld contributions of prior years’ remained unremitted and unreconciled, thus, deprive the HDMF of additional resources to provide assistance for the needs of other members and finance its various programs and projects and may result in the forfeiture of the employee’s claims or benefits whose contributions were not remitted.  



Sections 1.b and 2.b, Rule V of RA No. 9679 prescribe that coverage under the Pag-IBIG Fund shall be mandatory for all employees who are subject to mandatory coverage by the Government Service and Insurance System (GSIS) regardless of their employment status and employers of employees subject of mandatory coverage by the GSIS.



Rule VII – Collection and Remittance provides that:



Section 2.  Method of Collection and Payment.  Monthly contributions of members to the Fund shall be collected through payroll deductions by their respective employers, who for this purpose shall act as agent both of the Fund and the member. 



Section 3.  Remittance of Collection.  



a)	All employers shall remit to the Fund their contributions and the contributions of their covered employees as well as the latter’s loan amortizations or payments to the Fund, as provided for under Section 2 of this Rule, when applicable, within fifteen (15) days from the date the same were collected unless another period is previously agreed upon between the employer and the Fund, or within such periods as the Fund may prescribe otherwise.  X…xxx.



b)	Every employer required to set aside and remit such contributions as prescribed under RA No. 9679 and these Rules shall be liable for their payment, and non-payment thereof shall further subject the employer to a penalty of three percent (3%) per month of the amounts payable from the date the contributions fall due until paid.  Every employer who actually deducts from the salary of his employee the latter’s loan amortization or payments to the Fund, as provided for under these Rules, shall be liable for their payment, and non-payments thereof shall likewise further subject the employer to a penalty of three percent (3%) per month of the amounts payable from the date the loan amortization or payments fall due until paid.



During the year, the agency withheld and remitted intact without delay the Pag-IBIG contributions and loan payments from its officials and employees amounting to ₱1.489 million, shown as follows:

However, the prior year’s balance of ₱0.099 million remained unremitted as of year-end. The existence of outstanding balance at the end of the year implies that the agency was not compliant with the provisions of the law as regards the full and timely remittance of contributions withheld from the employees in prior years.



According to the Accountant, the unremitted amount has been existing in the books for an undetermined time and that verification and reconciliation requires time, hence, could not be given preference and that the processing and recording of current transactions are given more priority.  Moreover, considering that there are only five (5) staff in the Accounting Section, no personnel can be spared or assigned to work on the analysis of unreconciled accounts and determination of personnel whose contributions remain unremitted up to the present.  



It was also reasoned out that due to the absence of list of employees with unremitted contributions, remittance of the same would not be possible since it cannot be determined into whose account the amount should be credited. 



The continued failure to remit the withheld contributions of previous years would deprive the HDMF of additional resources to provide assistance for the needs of other members and finance its various programs and projects.  Delayed or non-remittance may also result in the forfeiture of the employee’s claims or benefits whose contributions were not remitted.  Corresponding penalties and surcharges for delayed remittances may be also incurred or imposed to the agency on the withheld amount.



We recommended and Management agreed to:



a)		require the Accountant to earnestly locate the documents necessary in the reconciliation, facilitate the identification of employees whose contributions remain unremitted, and immediately remit such amounts to the HDMF; and  

	

b)		consider the hiring of job order on contract of service basis to augment the existing personnel, which could help in facilitating the recording of transactions and reconciliation of all outstanding and unreconciled balances.

	

Withholding and remittance of PhilHealth contributions and employer’s share



15)	The agency withheld properly the PhilHealth personal contributions of employees for the year amounting to ₱0.601 million and remitted the amount of ₱0.601 million, net of refunds, including the government’s share of ₱0.601 million in accordance with R.A. No. 7875, as amended by R.A. No. 9241 (National Health Insurance Act of 1995).  However, the balance of ₱0.024 million, representing withheld contributions of prior years’, remained unremitted and unreconciled, thus, may result in interest and penalties.



The National Health Insurance Program (NHIP) is a compulsory health insurance program of the government as instituted pursuant to the National Health Insurance Act of 1995 (R.A. No. 7875), as amended by R.A. No. 9241, which shall provide universal health insurance coverage and ensure affordable, acceptable, available and accessible health care services for all citizens of the Philippines.



All government and private sector employees, including household help and sea-based OFWs, are compulsory members of the NHIP.



          Section 11, Rule II, Title III of the Implementing Rules and Regulation of R.A. No. 7875, as amended, states that the Remittance of Premium Contribution shall be mandatory for all members.  It shall be made to all Philhealth offices or to any accredited collecting agents.  Failure to timely remit the appropriate premium contribution shall be subject to interest and penalties as prescribed by the Corporation without prejudice to other applicable penalties herein provided.



Shown in the table below were the amount of personal contributions withheld and remitted including that of the government share made in CY 2020.

Verification of the reports and records of the Council showed that it has deducted properly the PhilHealth personal contributions of employees for the year and remitted within the prescribed period the amount of ₱0.601million, net of beginning balance of ₱0.024 million, in accordance with R.A. No. 7875, as amended by R.A. No. 9241 (National Health Insurance Act of 1995).  Likewise, the government’s share amounting to ₱0.601 million was remitted without delay.  

 

However, the balance of ₱0.024 million, which pertains to carry-over balance of previous years’, withheld personal contributions, remained unremitted and unreconciled. 



According to the Accountant, the unremitted amount has been existing in the books even prior to her assumption in CY 2017 as Chief of the Accounting Section, and that the employees with unremitted contributions can no longer be identified due to non-availability of records. 



In our view, the unavailability of records could not be given as reason for the non- reconciliation of the outstanding balance or unremitted amount of PhilHealth contributions. Considering that reports and documents such as disbursement vouchers, payrolls and their supporting documents, which are needed in the verification and reconciliation, are submitted to the office of the auditor, copy therefore are available in the said office and they only need to request permission to access these records. 



Delayed or non-remittance may also result in penalties and surcharges imposed to the agency on the withheld amount.



We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to:



a)	exhaust possible means in locating the documents necessary in the analysis and reconciliation of balances; and



b)	facilitate the identification of employees whose contributions remain unremitted; and immediately remit such amounts to the PHIC.  

	

Withholding and remittance of taxes



16)	The agency properly withheld and remitted without delay the taxes from compensation income from officials and employees and government purchases and contract of services from suppliers/contractors amounting to ₱4.997 million, net of adjustments/refunds of ₱0.134 million, and ₱4.604 million, respectively, in accordance with Revenue Regulation No. 10-2008 dated July 8, 2008.  The amount of ₱0.353 million withheld in December 2020 was remitted on the 4th of January 2021.  



Hiring of and payments to job orders, contractual and consultants



17)	The agency hired 46 individuals covered with Contract of Service (COS) or Job Order on a monthly basis with corresponding payments amounting to ₱13.154 million in accordance with CSC-COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 1 dated June 15, 2017, as updated by CSC-COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2, s 2020, dated October 20, 2020, to augment the regular plantilla employees of 113 personnel and due to lack of manpower.  Their salaries were charged against Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses under the Other Professional Services as authorized under DBM Circular Letter (CL) No. 2013-5 dated July 22, 2013.



Non-allocation of required fund for GAD programs/activities and non-submission of GAD Plan and Budget/Accomplishment Report



18)	The agency allocated ₱3.000 million or 1.25 percent only which is less than five percent of its appropriation of ₱239.381 million for GAD programs and related activities, inconsistent with Section 31 of RA  No. 11465 or the General Appropriations Act (GAA) for FY 2020.   Moreover,  GAD Plan and Budget/Accomplishment Report were not submitted to the Auditor, hence, hindered the determination of whether the PCAF has complied with existing rules and regulations on gender and development and if funds were indeed allocated and properly utilized for the purpose. 



Section 31 of the GAA for FY 2020 provides that:

	

“All agencies of the government shall formulate a Gender and Development (GAD) Plan designed to address gender issues within their concerned sectors or mandate and implement the applicable provisions under RA No. 9710 or the Magna Carta of Women, Convention on the Elimination 0f All forms of Discrimination Against Women, the Beijing Platform for Action, the Philippine Plan for Gender-Responsive Development (1995-2025) and the Philippine Development Plan (2017-2022)



The GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of the agencies, which shall be at least five percent (5%) of their budgets. For this purpose, activities currently being undertaken by agencies which relate to GAD or those that contribute to poverty alleviation, economic empowerment especially of marginalized women, protection, promotion, and fulfillment of women’s human rights, and practice of gender-responsive governance are considered sufficient compliance with the requirement. Utilization of GAD budget shall be evaluated based on the GAD performance indicators identified by said agencies.”



Item 8 of PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01 provides that:

			

“All government instrumentalities shall formulate their annual GPBs within the context of their mandates. The NGA shall submit the GPBs and the corresponding GAD Accomplishment Reports (AR) to the PCW for the latter’s review and endorsement to the DBM in accordance with PCW Memorandum Circular No. 2016-05. The PCW shall then acknowledge receipt of the GPBs and review the same and inform the agency of its comments or actions on the GAD plans. The PCW shall then endorse all revised GPBs and return these to the NGAs for their submission to the DBM. Upon receipt of the PCW-endorsed GPBs, the agency shall submit the same to the DBM along with their annual GAD Accomplishment Report for the previous year in accordance with the budget call. Once the GAA has been approved and where budget and program adjustments have to be made based on final agency budgets, the agency shall submit an adjusted GPB to the PCW. The adjusted GPB shall be the basis for implementing the GPBs as well as for monitoring and reporting.”

	

Item V of COA Circular No. 2014-001 dated March 18, 2014 states that, 

	

“The Audited agency shall submit a copy of the Annual GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) to the COA Audit Team assigned to the agency within five (5) working days from the receipt of the approved plan from the PCW or their mother or central offices as the case maybe.”

		

PCW Memorandum Circular No. 2021-01 provides under Item 7.0 that:



“FY 2020 GAD ARs submitted to PCW shall be authenticated by the Gender Mainstreaming Monitoring System (GMMS) with a barcode. Concerned agencies shall print the GMMS-authenticated GAD AR for signature of their agency head and submit signed copies to PCW and their respective COA Audit Team.”



For CY 2020, the agency allocated only ₱3.000 million or 1.25 percent which is less than five percent of its appropriation of ₱239.381 million for GAD related activities, inconsistent with Section 31 of the General Provisions, General Appropriation Act (GAA), FY 2020.   



Moreover, the GAD Focal Person failed to submit the PCW-endorsed GAD Plan and Budget/Accomplishment Report to the Auditor, contrary to Item V of COA Circular No. 2014-001 dated March 18, 2014.



Likewise, the non-submission of the said GAD Plan and Budget and the corresponding Accomplishment Reports hampers the determination as to whether the agency was able to formally and fully addressed GAD issues and concerns and complied with the five percent threshold.

	

We recommended and Management agreed to:

	

a)	allocate at least five percent of the Agency’s appropriation for the conduct of GAD-related programs, projects and activities to maximize the agency’s contribution towards the attainment of the GAD intended purpose or objectives; and 

	

b)	instruct the GAD Focal Person to strictly adhere to the deadlines set on the timely submission of GPB and AR with financial details to the Audit Team once approved/endorsed by the PCW.



Senior Citizen and Person with Disability plans/programs



19)	The agency spent ₱0.305 million in the implementation of the activities for the Senior Citizen and Person with Disability (SCPD), through  provision of survival kits and wellness supply for them, in compliance with Section 32 of the General Provisions of the GAA for FY 2020.



Implementation of ODA Funded Projects



20)	The PCAF did not receive and disburse funds for the implementation of Official Development Assistance (ODA) Funded projects.





Receipt and utilization of Disaster Related Fund



21)	The agency did not receive and disburse funds for the Disaster Risk Reduction Management Fund and/or Quick Response Fund. 



Audit suspensions, disallowances and charges



22)	There were no disallowances and charges issued for the year. However, Notice of Suspensions issued during the year amounted to ₱0.986 million due to non-submission of required documents.  Moreover, only the amount of ₱1.163 million disallowances was settled with corresponding Notices of Settlement of Suspension, Disallowance and Charge (NSSDCs) issued during the year while no suspensions were settled, leaving unsettled suspensions and disallowances amounting to ₱146.334 as of year-end. 



COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009 prescribes the use of the 2009 Rules and Regulations on the Settlement of Accounts (RRSA) in which among others particularly in Chapter III states the guidelines in the issuance of AOM/NS/ND/NC/NSSDC and SASDC.



Section 7, Chapter II of the RRSA provides the responsibilities for audit and settlement of accounts, as shown below:

  

7.1.1	The head of the Agency, who is primarily responsible for all government funds and property pertaining to his agency, shall ensure that: (a)xxx; (b) the settlement of disallowances and charges is made within the prescribed period; (c) the requirements and transactions suspended in audit are complied with; xxx



7.1.2	The head of the Agency shall initiate the necessary administrative and/or criminal action in case of unjustified failure/refusal to effect compliance with the foregoing requirements by subordinate officials. Gross negligence in disciplining subordinates who are the subject of repeated adverse audit findings shall subject the officials concerned to disciplinary action by the proper authorities as the evidence may warrant.



Section 22.1 of the same Circular states that– a decision of the Commission Proper (CP), Director or Auditor upon any matter within their respective jurisdiction; if not appealed as herein provided, shall become final and executory.



Details of the total disallowances, suspensions as of December 31, 2020 and the settlements made during the year are shown as follows:

The beginning balance of suspensions in the amount of ₱37.673 million, which were issued in CY 2014, were for the Priority Development Assistance Fund transferred to various LGUs.  These suspensions remained unsettled due to failure of management to directly enforce settlement thereof, contrary to Sections 9.4 of COA Circular No. 2009-006.   



Out of the beginning balance of ND amounting to ₱108.838 million, ₱106.352 million pertain to disallowances issued for PDAF funds  while ₱2.486 million were for honoraria granted to officials and employees of the agency charged to Yolanda funds and ₱0.004 million for travel expenses of employees who are no longer connected with the agency. Fourteen NDs were issued for the ₱106.352 million disallowed PDAF funds, of which, 11 NDs amounting to ₱80.949 million were with Cluster decisions but no NFD were issued pending appeal/request for petition for review of the decisions. For the ND amounting to ₱2.486 million, a Notice of Finality of Decision and COA Order of Execution had been issued on October 9, 2019.  A request for authority to refund by installment was submitted to COA in October 2019.



The three (3) NSs issued during the year amounting to ₱0.986 million pertain to  non-submission of required documents on the purchased cell cards in CY 2019 such as the Special Order authorizing the receipt of cell cards by the recipients and the proof that these were actually received by them.



NSSDCs amounting to ₱1.163 million were issued for the refund of honoraria given to the officials and employees. The refunds were made through cash payments and salary deductions.  The NSSDC issued covers the payments made from October 2019 to November 2020.



During the year, settlements of disallowances amounting to ₱0.815 million were made through cash payments and deductions from the salaries and wages of agency officials and employees. Of this amount, ₱0.798 million was already remitted to the Bureau of the Treasury.  The Audit Team is yet to issue the NSDDC for the refunds/settlements made during the year.



We reiterated our recommendations and Management agreed to:



a)	ensure compliance with laws, rules and regulations to avoid audit suspensions, disallowances and charges; and



b)	direct the persons responsible and liable to settle the audit suspensions, disallowances and charges within the reglementary period by sending demand letter or by resorting to all other legal modes for the extinguishment of obligations as provided in Section 1231 of Civil Code; otherwise, legal action may be undertaken against those persons solidarily liable, particularly the certifying/approving officers and those no longer in the service as provided in Section 35 of P.D. No. 1445.
