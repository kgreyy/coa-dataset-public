E)	SUMMARY OF OTHER SIGNIFICANT AUDIT Observations and Recommendations



	Summarized below are the other significant audit observations noted during the audit and the corresponding recommendations, details of which are discussed in Part II of this report. Management views and comments including those offered during the exit conference were incorporated in the report, where appropriate.

	

1. 	The reliability of the Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) account with a carrying value of ₱301,531,338.99 as of December 31, 2020 was uncertain due to unfinished inventory-taking and inclusion of unserviceable property due for disposal, resulting in an unreconciled discrepancy of ₱17,683,163.37  between the  Report on Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) and the PPE Ledger Card (PPELC) contrary to Section 38, Chapter 10 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I.  (Observation No. 1)



		We recommended and the management agreed to direct the following officials to: 



a)		Accountant:

	

i)	Search for the pertinent documents, reports and records maintained in the previous years to facilitate the reconciliation of balances between the PPELC and the RPCPPE; and  



ii)	File a request for authority to derecognize non-existing/missing PPEs to the Office of the Auditor in accordance with the guidelines set under Item 8 of the COA Circular 2020-006 dated January 31, 2020.

	

b)		Supply Officer:

	

i)	Closely coordinate with the College Accountant for the reconciliation of the unreconciled balances of the PPE and thereafter, conduct periodic reconciliation of Accounting and Supply/Property records for PPE accounts; 



ii)	Revise the Property Number using the uniform property identification system for PPE prescribed under Item 5.6 of COA Circular No. 2020-006, and attach individual property tags to all PPEs of the College; and



iii)	Exert extra effort in locating the properties purchased in CYs 1994 to 2012, and accomplish the IIRUP as stated in the Instructions of Appendix No. 74 of GAM for NGAs, Volume II. 



(c) Inventory Committee:



i)	Conduct inventory of the PPE in accordance with COA Circular 2020-006 dated January 31, 2020 and include therein all items of PPE owned by the College, to come up with updated and complete RPCPPE.



1)		Both the Cashier and the Disbursing Officer (DO) were not adequately bonded contrary to Section 5.1 of the Treasury Circular No. 02-2009, dated August 6, 2009; thus, the risk that the College may not be appropriately indemnified in the event of loss of the cash handled by any of the accountable officers (AOs). (Observation No. 2)



We recommended and the management agreed to assess the risk associated with the cash accountabilities of the accountable officers (AOs) and consider increasing their fidelity bonds, especially that of the Disbursing Officer, corresponding to the amount of their actual accountabilities in order to provide adequate protection on the assets of the College.



2)	The discrepancies between the cashbooks and the accounting records have not been eliminated or adjusted, where appropriate, indicating lack of regular reconciliation between the accountable officers (AOs) and the Accountant which may result to the failure to detect and correct errors, and prevent probable losses or misappropriation. (Observation No. 3)



We recommended and the management agreed to undertake the following courses of action:



a)	Direct the Collecting and Disbursing Officers to record all transactions appropriately in their respective cashbook and make adjustments/corrections on the noted errors as mentioned above;



b)	Instruct the Accountant to draw an adjusting/reversing entry to correct JEV No. VCO/PCA-20-02-005 by debiting “Due to NGAs” account and crediting “Cash Collecting Officer” to reconcile the postings in the General Ledger and the balances of the accounts in the Trial Balance;



c)	Direct the accountable officers (AOs) and the Accountant to conduct monthly reconciliation of their books/records in order to identify and timely correct errors and/or immediately detect shortage or malversation, if any; and



d)	Advise the Accountant and the AOs to follow the Instructions provided in Appendices 1 to 5, 27 and 40 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume II, in the maintenance and keeping of accounting records and cashbooks. 



We reiterated our recommendation and the College President agreed to adopt strategies to upgrade the quality of education of the College, particularly the qualifications of the teaching personnel, which in turn will yield better performance of its graduates in the licensure examinations, making them more competitive in acquiring high paying jobs or decent means of livelihood.



3)	The academic courses offered by the College are aligned with the various memoranda issued by the Commission on Higher Education (CHED); however, the performance of the College for the past five years in the licensure board examinations given by the Professional Regulation Commission (PRC) was below the national passing grade attributable to the delayed hiring of teaching plantilla position and, therefore, did not speak well of the academic performance of the College. (Observation No. 4)



We reiterated our recommendation and the College President agreed to adopt strategies to upgrade the quality of education of the College, particularly the qualifications of the teaching personnel, which in turn will yield better performance of its graduates in the licensure examinations, making them more competitive in acquiring high paying jobs or decent means of livelihood.



1)			The College failed to recoup ₱7,121,688.80 of the  advance payment to the contractors and/or collect out of the forfeited performance bonds corresponding to three pre-terminated/abandoned projects way back in CY 2018, namely: Construction of Three-Storey Classroom and Office Building; Construction of Three-Storey Social Science and GAD Building; and Construction of Three -Storey Arts and Science Building Complex, all located in ASCOT, Zabali Campus, Baler, Aurora, thus, preventing the College from pursuing the projects due to insufficiency of funds to the detriment of the government. (Observation No. 5)



We recommended and the management agreed to undertake the following remedial measures:



a)	Require the BAC, in case of projects awarded to contractors with simultaneous projects, to consider the financial capability of the contractors to provide sufficient and available equipment and manpower to be pledged exclusively on each project;



b)	Seek legal assistance from the Office of the Solicitor General in pursuing the collection or forfeiture of the Performance Bonds and Advance Payment Bonds in relation to the abandoned projects, or in filing a civil action for indemnity and damages against the Insurance Company, if necessary, due to inordinate delay in processing the claims of the College; and



c)	Consult the Department of Works and Highways (DPWH) in developing a plan or other options to continue/complete the abandoned/terminated projects or modify the existing structures to prevent total wastage or loss of government resources and at the same time be beneficial to intended end-users.



2)		The acquisition of Office Equipment and Information and Computer Technology Equipment totaling to ₱904,447.00 and ₱1,434,355.00, respectively, was undertaken thru Small Value Procurement (SVP), but the items were not reflected in the Annual Procurement Plan (APP) as required by law, which rendered doubt on the necessity and regularity of the transactions and may also constitute splitting of contracts, in violation of Sections 7.2 and 54.1 of the Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (RIRR) of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9184, otherwise known as the Government Procurement Reform Act. Moreover, some of these contracts were awarded to bidders/suppliers who offered items with lower specifications than what were actually requested, to the disadvantage of the government. (Observation No. 6)

	

We recommended and the management agreed to adopt the following courses of action:



a)	Advise the Planning Director to (i) meticulously and judiciously plan the College budget and the timing of the procurement activities; and (ii) require the different end-user offices/units to present their programs, activities, and projects in their respective Project Management Procurement Plan (PPMP), which may be updated semi-annually or as often as may be required;



b)	Direct the BAC to (i) judiciously and carefully plan all procurement activities and conduct the same in accordance with the Annual Procurement Plan (APP) of the College and in strict compliance with the provisions of R.A. No. 9184 and its RIRR; (ii) justify their action in resorting to the alternative mode of small value procurement and in piecemeal instead of competitive public bidding as required under Section 54.1 of the same Act, to avail of the most advantageous prices available in the market; (iii) submit the Omnibus Sworn Statement (OSS) of the winning suppliers/contractors for all the completed procurement, ongoing and future conduct of SVP, otherwise, the said procurement may be deemed irregular in audit for non-compliance with the requirements of the said RIRR; (iv) in case of SVP when only one supplier responded to the Request for Quotation (RFQ), submit proof of invitation or sending of the RFQ to at least three suppliers, otherwise, the procurement may be disallowed for non-compliance with the requirements of the RIRR;  and



c)	Require all officials/personnel deemed responsible to submit justification for the awarding of contract and subsequent payment and acceptance of the equipment which did not meet the minimum specifications as stated in the Request for Quotation (RFQ), otherwise, we shall be constrained to disallow the transaction.



	

F)	SUMMARY OF TOTAL SUSPENSIONS, DISALLOWANCES AND CHARGES



	The balances of the Statement of Audit Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges (SASDC) for the period ended December 31, 2020 reflected suspensions and disallowances of ₱32,172,531.37 and ₱99,967,400.00, respectively. There were no charges issued during the year.





G)	STATUS of Implementation of Prior YearS’ AUDIT Recommendations
