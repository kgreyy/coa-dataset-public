December 6, 2000.  The PMO is the successor agency of the defunct Asset 

Privatization Trust which term ended on December 31, 2000 pursuant to Republic 

Act (RA) No. 8758. 

 

In addition to the powers, duties, and functions stated in Proclamation No. 50, as

other instruments, as may be necessary or appropriate to convey title to such assets; 

(3) take title to and possession and conserve assets transferred to it; (4) engage 

external expertise as necessary in the fulfillment of its tasks; (5) adopt internal rules 

and regulations; and, (6) submit periodic reports to the Council on the status of the 

disposition program. 

 

By virtue of EO No. 471 dated November 25, 2005, all the functions, rights, 

personnel, properties, assets, resources, technologies, materials, and records, as well 

as the obligations and the liabilities of the Board of Liquidators, were merged with 

the PMO. 

 

The PMO is headed by Chief Privatization Officer Atty. Gerard L. Chan, and

Management Services; Asset Management; Legal Services; and Marketing.

C. Scope and Objectives of Audit 
 

The audit covered the financial accounts and operations of the PMO for the period 

ended December 31, 2020.  The audit was conducted to: (a) verify the level of 

assurance that may be placed on Management’s assertion on the financial statements 

(FSs); (b) determine the propriety of transactions, as well as the agency’s 

compliance with laws, rules and regulations; (c) recommend agency’s improvement 

opportunities; and, (d) determine the extent of implementation of prior years’ audit 

recommendations. 

 

 

D. Audit Methodology 
 

We adopted a risk-based audit approach in the audit of the FSs of the PMO and in 

the review of compliance with laws, rules and regulations.  The Audit Team which 

carried out the audit, among others: (i) examined financial and accounting 

procedures adopted by the PMO and other relevant documentation; (ii) assessed 

internal controls regulating financial operations; (iii) conducted substantive testing of 

a representative sample of selected transactions;  (iv) carried out review, on test 

check basis, of a number of contracts and transactions related to movements in 

balances of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses; and, (v) conducted interviews 

and held discussions with the concerned officials and staff  of the agency. 

 

The results of the audit were communicated to the Head of the Agency and the 

concerned officials through the issuance of Audit Observation Memoranda.

E. Independent Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements 
      

        The Auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the 

PMO’s FSs as at December 31, 2020 due to material accounting errors that affected 

the balances of  Due from Government-Owned or Controlled Corporations, Due to 

NGAs, Interests Income, Divident Income, Operating Lease Receivable, and the 

related accounts, as discussed in Part I - Independent Auditor’s Report and in Part II 

- Observations and Recommendations of this report. 

 

 

F. Summary of Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations 
 

The audit observations and corresponding recommendations discussed in Part II of 

this report are summarized as follows: 

 

1. Various accounting errors in the keeping of accounts resulted in the misstatements 
of affected accounts reported in the FSs. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: (a) direct the Chief 

Accountant to effect the necessary adjustments to correct the reported 

balances of the affected accounts in the FSs; and (b) observe the 

proper/correct recording of accounts and transactions in accordance with the 

Government Accounting Manual for National Government Agencies and 

other applicable rules and regulations. 

 

a. Erroneous recognition of receipts of 10-year Agrarian Reform (AR) Bonds  
 

We recommend that Management require the Chief, Financial and 

Management Division (FMD) to furnish the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) - 

Miscellaneous Accounts Accounting Division (MAAD) the copies of the 

Journal Entry Vouchers (JEVs) and supporting documents on the 

recognition of the receipts of the 10-year AR Bonds and the maturity 

proceeds as soon as the same are recognized in the PMO books, for 

recognition of the corresponding reciprocal account in the BTr-NG books. 

  
b. Erroneous recognition of interest income on  the 10-year AR Bonds of 

P78,101.19 

 

We recommend that Management require the Chief Accountant to provide 

the BTr with the JEV and supporting documents on gross amount of the 

interest income on the AR Bonds and the related withholding taxes for 

recognition in the BTr-NG books of accounts. 

 

c. Erroneous recognition of Semirara Mining and Power Corporation (SMPC) 
shares of stocks of P396.162 million 

 



 

iv 

 

We recommend that Management require the Chief, Marketing Division 

(MD) and the Chief Accountant to coordinate with the BTr on the request 

with the SMPC for the segregation of the Certificate for the SMPC shares 

representing the National Development Company’s direct obligations to the 

NG and through the PMO to facilitate the recognition of the settlement of 

such obligations in the BTr-NG’s books and of any dividends to be derived 

thereon. 

  

d. Erroneous recognition of dividend income on the SMPC shares of stocks of 
P15.609 million 

 

We recommend that Management require the Chief Accountant to ensure 

that dividend income on the SMPC shares are not recognized in the PMO 

books as all income pertaining to assets for disposition by the PMO are for 

recognition in the BTr-NG books. 

 

e. Non-recognition of accrued receivables on properties under lease 
  

We recommended that Management require the Division Chief, MD to 

prepare and issue billing statements to lessees for the amount P60.768 

million, cause the issuance thereof to concerned lessees, and provide the 

FMD the copies of the duly received billing statements for the recognition of 

the receivables from the lessees and payable to the BTr under the 

appropriate accounts. 

 

We also recommend that Management direct the Chief Accountant to:  (a) 

transmit to the BTr the copies of the JEVs, together with billing statements 

and lease contracts for the recognition of the receivables from the PMO and 

income on the leases; and (b) agree with the BTr on the frequency of 

reconciliation of the Due to NGAs and Due from National Government 

Agencies to preclude discrepancies in the reciprocal accounts. 

  

2. Non-issuance of billing statements for leases/rentals due and the non-inclusion of 
rental charges for April and May 2020 as receivables did not enable the 

determination of the completeness and accuracy of the balance of Operating 

Lease Receivable of P29.250 million  and the recognition of the related 

receivables in the books of accounts. 

 

a. Non-issuance of billing statements for leases/rentals due 
 

We recommended that Management require the Division Chief, MD to: (a) 

formulate a systematic process on the preparation and issuance of pre-

numbered billing statement;  and (b) prepare and issue pre-numbered billing 

statements monthly to all lessees/debtors and provide the FMD with copy of 

the duly received billing statements together with contracts for recognition of 

receivables from lessees in the books.  



 

v 

 

 

We also recommend that Management direct the Chief Accountant, FMD to: 

(a)  recognize receivables upon receipt of the billing statements from the MD; 

and (b) transmit to the BTr-MAAD for the recognition of the receivables 

from the PMO and related income in the BTr-NG books. 

 

b. Non-inclusion of lease/rental charges for April and May 2020 in the 
receivables 

 

We recommended that Management require the Division Chief, MD to 

prepare and issue billing statements for April and May 2020 rental charges 

equally amortized for six months for the 106 Mile Long Complex lessees and 

provide the FMD with copy of the duly received billing statements. 

 

We also recommend that Management instruct the Chief Accountant, FMD 

to: (a)  consider and include rental charges for the months of April and May 

2020 in its Excel file for leases; (b) recognize receivables upon receipt of the 

duly received billing statements from the MD; and (c) transmit to the BTr-

MAAD the copies of JEVs, together with billing statements, for the 

recognition of receivables from the PMO and income on the leases/rents in 

the BTr-NG books. 

 

3. Reasonableness of terms and conditions of contracts for the lease of various 
government buildings and/or lands executed by the PMO with private 

entities/individuals was not ascertained due to non-submission of lease contracts 

and complete documentary requirements to the Commission on Audit (COA), thru 

the PMO Audit Team, for review and evaluation.   

 

We recommended that Management require the Division Chief, MD to submit 

the certified true copies of all existing lease contracts, together with complete 

documentary requirements, to the Audit Team for verification of 

completeness of documents for submission to COA-Technical Services Office, 

Systems Technical Services Sector, within 15 days upon execution of the 

contract. 

 

The aforementioned observations and the corresponding recommendations were 

discussed with concerned officials of the agency during the virtual exit conference 

on March 15, 2021.  Management’s views and comments were incorporated in the 

report, where appropriate.
