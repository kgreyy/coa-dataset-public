OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS  
 

 

Financial Audit 

 

Accounting Errors 

 

1. Various accounting errors in the keeping of accounts resulted in the 
misstatements of affected accounts reported in the financial statements (FSs). 

 

The International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSASs) 1 provides 

that the FSs shall present fairly the financial position, financial performance, and cash 

flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful presentation of the effects of 

transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with the definitions and 

recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in the IPSASs.  

The application of IPSASs, with additional disclosure, when necessary, is presumed 

to result in FSs that achieve a fair presentation. 

 

Sections 111 and 112, Chapter 2, Title III of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 

1445, require, among others, each government agency to record its financial 

transactions and operations conformably with generally accepted accounting 

principles and in accordance with pertinent laws and regulations. 

 

Proclamation No. 50 dated December 8, 1986 was issued for the expeditious 

disposition and privatization of certain government corporations and provides for the 

transfer to the National Government (NG) of certain assets and liabilities of these 

institutions. 

 

Pursuant to Administrative Order (AO) No. 141 dated February 3, 1987, the 

Deeds of Transfer were executed by and between the Government of the Republic of 

the Philippines and the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP), in consideration 

of the NG’s assumption of certain liabilities totaling P62.228 billion in exchange for 

various assets totaling P53.992 billion. The Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) is authorized 

and directed to take up in the books of the NG all transactions contemplated in AO 

No. 14. 

 

Review and verification of the accounts and transactions of the Privatization 

and Management Office (PMO) disclosed accounting errors that had affected the 

accuracy of the balances of some of the accounts reported at year-end, as summarized 

in Table 1.

We recommended and Management agreed to: (a) direct the Chief 

Accountant to effect the necessary adjustments to correct the reported balances 

of the affected accounts in the FSs; and (b) observe the proper/correct recording 

of accounts and transactions in accordance with the for GAM for NGAs and 

other applicable rules and regulations. 
 

a. Erroneous recognition of receipts of 10-year AR Bonds  
 

In a Trust Agreement dated February 27, 1987, the NG constituted the Asset 

Privatization Trust (APT) as its Trustee over the trust properties defined therein 

including, among others, the account of Northern Cement Corporation (NCC) with an 

original transfer price of P909.934 million as of June 30, 1986. 
  

When the APT2, now Privatization and Management Office (PMO) was in the 

process of disposing the NCC account in calendar year (CY) 1999, the DBP clarified 

that the transfer price for the NCC account should be P584.312 million and not 

P909.934 million as recognized in the BTr-NG books, thus, a discrepancy of P325.622 

million. The Committee on Privatization during its meeting on December 3, 1999 

                                                           
2 APT term ended on December 31, 2000 pursuant to RA No. 8758 



 

59 

 

decided that the difference in transfer price of P325.622 million will be collected from 

the DBP. 

 

On December 30, 2003, a Deed of Assignment of Right and Interest was 

executed between the DBP and the Government of the Republic of the Philippines 

through the PMO for the settlement of the discrepancy by way of cash payment of 

P53.371 million and the transfer/assignment of its receivables from the Department of 

Agrarian Reform (DAR)/Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) arising from the DBP’s 

transfer to the DAR of agricultural lands pursuant to  Executive Order (EO) No. 407 

dated June 14, 1990, recognized in the DBP’s books of accounts at P272.250 million 

as at December 15, 2003. 

 

Verification of the subsidiary ledgers (SLs) for the DBP-NCC showed that 

partial payments to the NG through the PMO for the difference in transfer price of 

P272.250 million for the NCC account, were paid by the DBP through remittances of 

proceeds from maturities of 10-year AR Bonds and transfers of 10-year AR Bonds in 

the name of the PMO. The details are presented in Table 2:

Balance of receivables as of December 31, 2020  P216,401,790.03 

 

The partial settlement of the receivables from the DBP in the form of 10-year 

AR Bonds represents the unexpired portion of the Bonds which were transferred by 

the DBP to PMO. The transfers of the 10-year AR Bonds to the PMO totaling P18.459 

million were recognized in the books of the PMO with a debit to Investments in Bonds 

and a credit to Other Deferred Credits.  

 

Further verification disclosed that on the anniversary date of the AR bonds, 

redemption and interest coupons were presented to the LBP for the receipt of proceeds 

from the 10-year bonds equivalent to one-tenth of its face value. The receipt of 

proceeds for the maturity was recognized with debits to Cash in Bank-Local Currency, 

Current Account and Other Deferred Credits and credits to Investment in Bonds and 

Trust Liabilities.  The amount recognized under Trust Liabilities pertain to the amount 

for remittance to the BTr, which was closed upon the said remittance. 

 

The proceeds of the AR Bonds are the income of the NG which are to be 

recognized in the books of the BTr-NG upon receipt of the remittance from the PMO.  



 

60 

 

However, the PMO recognized unearned income in its books under Other Deferred 

Credits.  

 

The recognition in the PMO and BTr-NG books of the receivables from the 

DBP for the settlement of the discrepancy in the transfer price of the NCC through the 

assignment of the AR Bonds, receipts of AR Bonds and its maturity proceeds as partial 

settlement of the receivables and related transactions were discussed and agreed to in 

a meeting with the concerned Government Accounting Sector (GAS) official and 

personnel. It was, thus, confirmed that the PMO had correctly recognized the receipt 

of the 10-AR Bonds under Investment in Bonds but had erroneously recognized such 

Bonds with the credit to Other Deferred Credits instead of Due to NGAs as it had 

recognized unearned income instead of a payable to the BTr for the proceeds of the 

Bonds.   The accounting entries shown in Table 3, among others, were not considered 

by the PMO in their recognition of the said AR Bond-related transactions as it had 

recognized unearned income in its books such that accounting errors affected the 

related accounts.

The erroneous recognition of various transactions relative to the 10-year AR 

Bonds resulted in the understatement of Due from Government-Owned or Controlled 

Corporations and Due to NGAs,  and the overstatement of Other Deferred Credits by 

P216.402 million, P219.591 million, and P3.189 million, respectively. 

 

Also, the Financial and Management Division (FMD) did not provide the BTr-
Miscellaneous Accounts Accounting Division (MAAD) with the Journal Entry 

Vouchers (JEVs) and supporting documents recognizing the receipts of AR Bonds and 

the maturity proceeds such that receivables from the PMO had not been recognized. 



 

61 

 

  

We recommend that Management require the Chief, FMD to furnish the 

BTr-MAAD the copies of the JEVs and supporting documents on the recognition 

of the receipts of the 10-year AR Bonds and the maturity proceeds as soon as the 

same are recognized in the PMO books, for recognition of the corresponding 

reciprocal account in the BTr-NG books. 

 

b. Erroneous recognition of interest income on  the 10-year AR Bonds of P78,101.19 

On the other hand, the 10-year AR Bonds include interest coupon which is to 

be presented to the LBP on the date indicated in the coupon and credited to the bank 

account of PMO with the LBP for the said interest.  For CY 2020, interest income on 

the AR Bonds based on the Bond Redemption and Interest Voucher from the LBP 

totaled P97,626.47, with withholding tax of P19,525.28, or a net interest income of 

P78,101.19.   

 

The interests earned from the AR bonds, net of withholding tax were 

recognized with a debit to Cash in Bank, Local Currency, Current Account and credit 

to Interest Income instead of a credit to Due to NGAs as the BTr and not the PMO is 

to recognize the interest income. However, interest income should be recognized at its 

gross amount and not at its net amount  Thus,  Interest Income and  Accumulated 

Surplus/(Deficit) were both overstated by P78,101.19.  

 

   Also, the PMO provided the BTr only with a breakdown of the nature of the 

remittances made and the corresponding amounts such that only the amount of the net 

interest income was provided.  Thus, the details of the interest income on the AR 

Bonds at its gross amount and the related withholding taxes could not be readily 

determined for recording in the BTr-NG books. As such, the BTr had not recognized 

the withholding taxes as the interest income were recognized at the net amount instead 

of at the gross amount.  

 

We recommend that Management require the Chief Accountant to 

provide the BTr with the JEV and supporting documents on gross amount of the 

interest income on the AR Bonds and the related withholding taxes for 

recognition in the BTr-NG books of accounts.  
 

c. Erroneous recognition of SMPC shares of stocks of P396.162 million 
 

On April 30, 1997, then APT, now PMO, recorded the remaining receivables 

from the transfer price of the National Development Company (NDC) for Elisteel 

(A&B) and Pasig Steel amounting to P529.129 million and P99.263 million, 

respectively, under Trust Receivable which was later reclassified under Other 

Receivables in the PMO books. Various payments totaling P232.229 million were 

made by the NDC for the Elisteel (A&B) and Pasig Steel accounts from CYs 1986 to 

1995, leaving a balance of P396.162 million as at March 31, 2015.  



 

62 

 

On December 18, 2015, a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) was executed 

among the Republic of the Philippines referred to as NG, through the Department of 

Finance (DOF), the PMO, BTr and NDC, and agreed on the obligations presented in 

Table 4: 

 

Table 4 - NDC Obligations to the NG and Through the PMO 

Particulars Amount 

1.  Dividends payable to the NG for CYs 1996 to 2014 P2,014,935,463.50 

2.  NDC outstanding obligation to the NG 1,942,018,788.12 

3.  NDC outstanding obligations to NG through PMO 396,162,423.94 

Total NDC Obligations P4,353,116,675.56 

 

The NDC obligations to the NG of P1.942 billion, consisting of: (i) NG 

Advances on the payment of NDC loan to the government financial institutions (GFIs) 

on account of First Centennial Clark Corporation consisting of principal and interest 

totaling P1.866 billion; (ii) payable to NG relating to National Steel Corporation of 

P35.929 million; and (iii) guarantee fee payable of P39.892 million.   

 

On March 31, 2016, the PMO recognized in its books the receipt of shares of 

stocks of the SMPC as settlement by the NDC equivalent only to the outstanding 

obligation to the NG through PMO of P396.162 million or about 3,121,847 shares 

(P135.00 closing rate less 6 per cent discount) with a debit to Investments in Stocks 

and a credit to Other Deferred Credits.  The remaining shares of about 30,972,127 

representing dividends payable to the NG and other NDC obligations to the NG were 

not recognized in PMO books.  As there was only one certificate for the NDC’s direct 

payables to the NG and through the PMO to the NG, the exact number of shares 

representing those payables could not be ascertained such that a pro-rated sharing of 

the SMPC shares was used only for purposes of discussion.  

 

As also discussed and confirmed during the meeting with GAS official and 

personnel, the credit to Other Deferred Credits for the receipt of the SMPC shares was 

erroneous as PMO should not recognize any income from disposition activities on 

acquired assets of the NG but rather a payable to the NG under Due to NGAs. 

 

The recognition of the SMPC shares in the PMO books with a debit to 

Investment in Stocks and a credit to Other Deferred Credits instead of a credit to Due 

to NGAs resulted in the overstatement of Other Deferred Credits and understatement 

of Due to NGAs, both by P396.162 million. 

 

Further, since the settlement of the NDC obligation to the NG totaling P3.957 

billion was also covered by the SMPC shares evidenced by only one Certificate in the 

name of the PMO, the settlement was not recorded in the BTr-NG books.   

Consequently, any dividends thereon will not also be recognized by the BTr. 

 

We recommend that Management require the Chief, Marketing Division 

(MD) and the Chief Accountant to coordinate with the BTr on the request with 



 

63 

 

the SMPC for the segregation of the Certificate for the SMPC shares 

representing the NDC’s direct obligations to the NG and through the PMO to 

facilitate the recognition of the settlement of such obligations in the BTr-NG’s 

books and of any dividends to be derived thereon.  

 

d. Erroneous recognition of dividend income on the SMPC shares of stocks of 
P15.609 million 

 

As of September 2014, the PMO had a total SMPC shares of 2,308,350 in its 

custody.   Stock Certificate Nos. 2527 and 2528 for 76,945 and 692,505 shares, 

respectively, or a total of 769,450 shares were from the Semirara Coal Corporation 

under the DBP transferred assets to the NG.  These shares were transferred under the 

name of the PMO on July 18, 2006.  On the other hand, Stock Certificate No. 2772 

for 1,538,900 shares pertains to a 200 per cent stock dividend on the 769,450 shares.  

Cash dividend for all the said shares totaled P2.885 million. 

 

On March 3, 2016, the PMO received additional shares of 34,093,974 as 

settlement of NDC obligation to the NG, while on September 15, 2017, the SMPC 

declared 300 per cent stock dividends totaling 109,206,972 to NG through PMO. As 

of December 31, 2019, the total SMPC shares in the PMO’s custody was 145,609,296 

(2,308,350 + 34,093,974 + 109,206,972) shares. 

 

On April 7, 2020, the PMO received a cash dividend totaling P182.012 million 

from the total SMPC shares of 145,609,296 @ P1.25 per share. The details are shown 

in Table 5:

Total 145,609,296 P182,011,647.00 

 

The PMO recognized the cash dividend for the shares applicable to the NDC 

obligation to the NG through PMO of 12,487,388 at P1.25 or a total P15.609 million 

under Dividend Income instead of under Due to NGAs although the dividend income 

was for remittance to the BTr. Thus, Dividend Income and Accumulated 

Surplus/(Deficit) were both overstated by P15.609 million. 

 

  Cash dividends for the other SMPC shares inadvertently placed under its 

name were also received by the PMO and were recognized under Trust Liabilities 

instead of under Due to NGAs. These cash dividends as well as those received for the 

SMPC shares pertaining to the settlement of the NDC obligations were not recognized 



 

64 

 

under the appropriate account although the error no longer exists with the remittance 

of the dividends to the BTr. 

 

We recommend that Management instruct the Chief Accountant to 

ensure that dividend income on the SMPC shares are not recognized in the PMO 

books as all income pertaining to assets for disposition by the PMO are for 

recognition in the BTr-NG books.  

 

e. Non-recognition of accrued receivables on properties under lease 
 

Based on the 161 lease contracts, receivables from rentals of various 

government properties managed by the PMO totaled P60.768 million as at December 

31, 2020.  The details are presented in Table 6.

Examination of the Excel file on leases disclosed that receivables from various 

lessees for rental fees, association dues and parking fees totaling P60.768 million 

remained unpaid and unrecognized in the books as at December 31, 2020.  The Chief, 

MD did not issue monthly billing statements to the lessees.  Hence, the FMD had not 

recognized receivables from rental charges since CY 2014 and a corresponding 

payable to the BTr thereon. Instead, it monitored all receivables from lessees using an 

excel file. The non-accrual of receivables arising from rental charges, and association 

and parking fees resulted in the understatement of Operating Lease Receivable and 

Due to NGAs, both by P60.768 million as at year-end. 

 

We recommended that Management require the Division Chief, MD to 

prepare and issue billing statements to lessees for the amount P60.768 million, 

cause the issuance thereof to concerned lessees, and provide the FMD the copies 

of the duly received billing statements for the recognition of the receivables from 

the lessees and payable to the BTr under the appropriate accounts. 

 

We also recommend that Management direct the Chief Accountant to:  (a) 

transmit to the BTr the copies of the JEVs, together with billing statements and 

lease contracts for the recognition of the receivables from the PMO and income 

on the leases; and (b) agree with the BTr on the frequency of reconciliation of the 



 

65 

 

Due to NGAs and Due from National Government Agencies to preclude 

discrepancies in the reciprocal accounts. 

 

 

Accounting Deficiencies 

 

2. Non-issuance of billing statements for leases/rentals due and the non-inclusion of 
rental charges for April and May 2020 as receivables did not enable the 

determination of the completeness and accuracy of the balance of Operating Lease 

Receivable of P29.250 million and the recognition of the related receivables in the 

books of accounts. 
 

a. Non-issuance of billing statements for leases/rentals due 
 

Internal Control Structure provides the composition of an internal control 

system which includes financial or accounting controls used to produce accurate 

records and safeguard assets designed to ensure that there are adequate checking and 

reconciling procedures. Accounting controls in producing accurate records include 

billing statements, that are pre-numbered and numerically accounted for and properly 

recorded, and statements of account (SOA).  A billing statement is a monthly bill that 

summarizes charges and payments over the preceding month while a statement of 

account lists all transactions for a customer for a particular period. 

 

Based on the illustrative entries in the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, receivable 

and income are recognized upon billing to the debtor/lessee. Normally, a billing 

statement is issued when the amount is due and demandable. Therefore, upon issuance 

of the billing statement by the PMO, a receivable from the lessees and a payable to the 

BTr should be recognized in the PMO books, and a corresponding receivable from the 

PMO and income on the lease/rental of NG properties should be recognized in the BTr-

NG books.  However, monthly billing statements were not issued by the MD to all 

lessees of government properties under the custody of PMO as well as to other debtors 

from which the PMO had receivables.  

 

Following the processing of the SOA specified in the PMO Quality Manual 

(QM), the FMD prepared one copy of the SOA as of a given date stated in the duly 

signed Request Form for SOA from the MD only upon receipt of such request and not 

as the receivables fall due from the lessees. Also, there is no prescribed process for the 

issuance of the SOA to the lessee included in the QM.  

 

According to the concerned MD personnel, the MD prepares a Demand Letter 

(DL) and orders a messenger to transmit the original DL and SOA, with a receiving 

copy, to the caretaker or administrator of the properties being leased and the latter 

issues the original DL and SOA to the lessee/debtor. In case the original DL and SOA 

were received by the lessee, the receiving copy will bear a signature of the 

lessee/debtor, otherwise, it will be returned to the MD without the signature of the 



 

66 

 

lessee/debtor. The MD will file the receiving copy of the DL and SOA without 

furnishing the FMD a copy. 

 

Since the basis for recognizing receivable and income is the issuance of the 

billing statement, the non-issuance thereof to the lessee/debtor by the MD resulted in 

the non-recognition of the receivables from the lessees and payable to the BTr in the 

PMO books which affected the completeness and accuracy of the balances of the 

related accounts as at year-end.  Moreover, a corresponding receivable from the PMO 

and income on the leases/rentals were not recognized in the BTr-NG books as JEVs 

were not drawn to recognize the transactions in the PMO books and the copies of the 

same JEVs and supporting documents were not sent to the BTr-MAAD. 
 

We recommended that Management require the Division Chief, MD to: (a) 

formulate a systematic process on the preparation and issuance of pre-numbered 

billing statement; and (b) prepare and issue pre-numbered billing statements 

monthly to all lessees/debtors and provide the FMD with copy of the duly received 

billing statements together with contracts for recognition of receivables from 

lessees in the books.  

 

We also recommend that Management direct the Chief Accountant, FMD 

to: (a) recognize receivables upon receipt of the billing statements from the MD; 

and (b) transmit to the BTr-MAAD copies of the JEVs, together with billing 

statements and contracts for the recognition of the receivables from the PMO and 

related income in the BTr-NG books. 

  

b. Non-inclusion of lease/rental charges for April and May 2020 in the receivables 

 

Paragraph 3 of various Lease Agreements executed between the PMO and 

lessees of the Mile Long Complex (MLC) properties provides that the term of the lease 

of the properties will continue on a month-to-month basis and payment of rent shall 

be made on the 1st day of each month. 

 

Moreover, Section 3.2 of the Department of Trade and Industry Memorandum 

Circular (MC) No. 20-12, series of 2020 states that for commercial rents of Micro, 

Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), the cumulative amount of rents falling due 

within the Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) shall be equally amortized in the 

six months following the end of the ECQ and shall be added to the rents due on those 

succeeding months, without interest, penalties, fees and charges. 

 

Verification of unpaid rental balances as at December 31, 2020 disclosed 

unreconciled balances  between the lease/rental charges of P60.768 million based on 

contracts and  of P49.962 million in the excel file of the FMD for the same contracts 

or a discrepancy of P10.806 million, as shown in Table 7:

Total P60,768,208.99 P49,962,372.05 P10,805,836.94 

 

Examination of the FMD’s excel file showed that the difference of P10,806 

million represents charges for April and May 2020 during the ECQ for the account of 

the 106 lessees of the Mile Long Complex properties which were not considered as 

collectibles/receivables from the lessees. According to the MD personnel, all 

establishments temporarily ceased operations because of the implementation of the 

ECQ and MECQ from March 16, 2020 to May 31, 2020. On the other hand, the Chief 

Accountant explained that all lessees of the Mile Long Complex will no longer be 

charged for rentals for April and May 2020, thus, the non-inclusion of the 

corresponding rental charges in its Excel file. 

 

Notwithstanding, lease/rental charges were still due and demandable during 

the period of the ECQ but may be equally amortized in the six months following the 

end of the ECQ, and added to the rents due on those succeeding months, without 

interest, penalties, fees and charges.   The non-inclusion of the rental charges for April 

and May 2020 as collectibles/receivables in the monitoring file of FMD resulted in 

inaccurate balances of unpaid rentals for recognition in the books.  

 

As the said lease/rental charges were not also recognized in the PMO books, 

there were no JEVs recognizing the related receivables and for transmittal to the BTr-

MAAD. Consequently, no receivables from the PMO and income from leases/rents 

were recognized in the BTr-NG books. 

 

     We recommended that Management require the Division Chief, MD to 

prepare and issue billing statements for April and May 2020 rental charges 

equally amortized for six months for the 106 MLC lessees and provide the FMD 

with copy of the duly received billing statements. 

 

We also recommend that Management instruct the Chief Accountant, 

FMD to: (a) consider and include rental charges for the months of April and May 

2020 in its Excel file for leases; (b) recognize receivables upon receipt of the duly 

received billing statements from the MD; and (c) transmit to the BTr-MAAD the 

copies of JEVs, together with billing statements, for the recognition of receivables 

from the PMO and income on the leases/rents in the BTr-NG books.

Management Comments: 

 

The recommendation to charge rentals for the months of April and May 2020 

and demand settlement through installment payments disregards the factual and legal 

basis of the nature of month-to-month lease contracts and expiration thereof. Since the 

leases expired at the end of the month in March 2020, the renewal thereof was subject 

to the lessees’ offer and the PMO’s acceptance. 

 

Moreover, the PMO claimed that those leases expired at the end of the month 

in March 2020 due to the circumstances brought by Presidential Proclamation No. 929, 

placing the entire Philippines under State of Calamity due to Coronavirus Disease 2019 

(COVID-19) pandemic and imposing an ECQ throughout Luzon beginning March 16 

until May 31, 2020, and by the lessees’ decision not to return or request for 

reinstatement of their leases. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

Under the provisions of Articles 1670 and 1687 of the Civil Code of the 

Philippines, when the period for the lease has not been fixed, it is understood to be from 

month to month if the rent agreed upon is monthly. Moreover, when the lessee should 

continue enjoying the thing leased for 15 days with the acquiescence of the lessor and 

unless notice to the contrary has previously been given at the end of the contract, it is 

understood that there is an implied new lease or tacita reconducion. 

 

The Audit Team interpreted that there are implied new leases for all lease 

contracts because there were no notices of termination of lease contacts given either by 

the PMO or by the various lessees. If indeed the PMO did not give acquiescence to the 

continued use of the leased premises, it should have issued notices to the lessees to 

vacate the leased premises or have demanded the return of such premises. 

Acquiescence may be inferred from the failure of the lessor to serve notice to vacate 

upon the lessee3. Also, lessees continued the enjoyment of the properties being leased 

since their personal things remained in the leased premises during the ECQ as 

confirmed with the MD. The mere fact that the personal things of the lessees in the 

subject properties were undisturbed and occupancy of the premises was uninterrupted, 

it can be said that there was a peaceful, adequate, and continued use and enjoyment of 

the leased premises. While the imposition of the ECQ limited the use of the leased 

premises, the lessees were still in the actual possession of the subject properties.

entities/individuals was not ascertained due to non-submission of lease contracts 

and complete documentary requirements to the COA, thru the PMO Audit 

Team, for review and evaluation.   
  

COA Circular No. 2019-005 dated August 7, 2019 requires that all government 

agencies which have an existing contract with private entities/individuals involving 

lease of government building and/or lands shall submit to the COA Technical Services 

Office, Systems and Technical Services Sector (TSO, STSS) a certified true copy of 

contracts for review by the said Office, within 15 days from the publication/posting of 

the Circular or upon the execution of the contract. 

 

COA TSO, STSS Memorandum No. 2019-003 dated November 28, 2019 

prescribes the documentary requirements for submission of contracts involving 

government buildings and/or lands leased to private entities/individuals for review by 

the TSO.  

 

Before submission of existing lease contracts to the COA TSO for review and 

evaluation of the terms and rental rates of said contracts, it is the basic obligation of the 

Audit Team to check the completeness of the documents to be transmitted to the COA- 

TSO.  

 

As at December 31, 2020, the PMO submitted certified copies of 85 of 158 

existing lease contracts executed between the PMO and private entities/individuals in 

CYs 1992, 2003, 2006, and 2017 to 2020. The contract executed in CY 1992 refers to 

the lease of CCP properties between PMO and Star Parks Corporation with a lease term 

of 25 years from the date of contract and renewable for the same period. While other 

contracts executed in CYs 2003, 2006 and 2017 to 2020 will continue on month-to-

month basis as stated in the lease contracts. These contracts were returned by the Audit 

Team to the PMO, requiring the submission of additional documents, as required under 

the said COA TSO, STSS Memorandum.  As at March 15, 2021, the PMO has not yet 

submitted the required additional documents.  

 

Moreover, the PMO did not furnish the Audit Team the certified true copies of 

the remaining 73 lease contracts for submission to the COA-TSO, STSS.  With the non-

submission of the existing lease contracts, together with the required documents, the 

same had not been forwarded to the COA-TSO,STSS for review to determine the 

reasonableness of the terms and rental rates of government properties. 

  

We recommended that Management require the Division Chief, MD to 

submit the certified true copies of all existing lease contracts, together with 

complete documentary requirements, to the Audit Team for verification of 

completeness of documents for submission to COA-TSO, STSS, within 15 days 

upon execution of the contract.

4. COVID-19-Pandemic Response and Recovery Interventions 
 

 For CY 2020, the PMO had not received funds specifically for COVID-19 

response and/or recovery but had utilized its budget for related expenses. The COVID-

19-related expenses charged to Personnel Services (PS) and Maintenance and Other 

Operating Expenses (MOOE) totaled P204,500.00 and P231,129.15, respectively. The 

results of audit of these COVID-related transactions are as follows: 
 

On the grant of hazard pay to employees during the ECQ  

 

Section 1 of AO No. 26 dated March 23, 2020 was issued authorizing the 

National Government Agencies (NGAs) to grant of COVID 19 Hazard Pay to 

government personnel who physically report for work during the period of 

implementation of ECQ relative to the COVID-19 Outbreak in an amount not 

exceeding P500.00 per day per person.  

 

Section 2 of the same AO provides the conditions on the grant of the COVID-

19 Hazard Pay and that the heads of government agencies may grant the COVID-19 

Hazard Pay to their personnel/workers without the need for further approval by the 

Department of Budget and Management (DBM), subject to the following guidelines 

and conditions:  

 

1. The personnel are occupying regular, contractual or casual positions, or 
are workers engaged through Contract of Service (COS), job order (JO), 

or other similar schemes. 

 

2. The personnel/workers have been authorized to physically report for work 
at their respective offices or work stations on the prescribed official 

working hours by the head of agency/office during the period of 

implementation of ECQ measures in the area of such office or work 

station. 

 

3. The total rate of the COVID-19 Hazard Pay shall be based on the number 
of days an employee/worker physically reports for work during the ECQ 

period using the formula under Section 1, which is P500.00 x No. of days 

physically reporting for work during the quarantine period. 
 

Whereas, Paragraph A of PMO Office Order No. 2020-03 dated March 13, 

2020 states that the office shall adopt a Skeletal Workforce in order to continue and 

maintain the operation of the Agency with the observance of flexible working hours. 

 

Review of the transactions recognized under Hazard Pay and Other 

Maintenance and Operating Expenses for CY 2020 disclosed that the PMO granted 

COVID-19 hazard pay at P500.00/day to 57 regular/plantilla officials and employees, 



 

71 

 

4 COS/Service Agreement and 1 job order (JO) personnel totaling P204,500.00, 

P10,000.00, and P3,000.00, respectively, who reported to office during the ECQ 

(March 17 to May 15, 2020) and Modified ECQ (MECQ) (May 16 to 31, 2020 and  

August 4 to 18, 2020). 
 

Verification of the relevant disbursement vouchers on the grant of hazard pay 

showed that the payments were supported with office order/s of PMO employees 

including COS/Service Agreement personnel and JO authorized to work during the 

ECQ and MECQ, Daily Time Records, summary of all PMO personnel who actually 

rendered service as Skeleton Workforce during the ECQ and MECQ, and 

accomplishment reports. 
 

On the provision of supplies/materials for hazard control 

 

Items 5.3 of Civil Service Commission (CSC) MC No. 18, s. 2020 dated 

October 15, 2020 provides that: a) disinfection should be part of the regular 

maintenance and upkeep of the agency; b)  conduct of health status survey to ensure 

that all those reporting to the office are in tip-top shape and that no one is exhibiting 

any of the symptoms of COVID-19 disease; and c) modification of the workplace 

layout to ensure observance of physical distancing requirements of those who will be 

reporting to the office. Item 5.5 of the same CSC MC provides that agencies shall 

implement minimum health standards protocol at all times such as wearing of face 

masks, face shield, taking of body temperature, and presence of sanitation stations and 

other appropriate personal protective equipment.  

 

Review of the transactions recognized under Office Supplies Expense, Other 

Supplies and Materials Expenses and Repairs and Maintenance-Buildings and Other 

Structures amounting to P22,880.00, P181,249.15 and P14,000.00, respectively, 

disclosed that such expenses pertain to various procurements of alcohol, face masks, 

disinfection supplies and materials and disinfection service, in compliance with CSC 

MC No. 18, s. 2020. 

 

 

5. Gender and Development (GAD) 
  

Item 6.1 of the PCW-NEDA-DBM JC No. 2012-01 provides that at least 5 per 

cent of the total agency budget authorized under the annual General Appropriation 

Acts (GAA) shall correspond to activities supporting GAD plans and programs. 

 

Verification of the PMO’s GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) revealed that P1.273 

million or only 1.56 per cent of the total appropriation of P81.540 million was 

allocated for GAD programs, activities and projects (PAPs).  With the issuance of the 

DBM NBC No. 580, Special Allotment Release Order (SARO) No. SARO-BMB-A-
20-0013133 dated June 24, 2020 for the discontinuance of appropriated PAPs of 

P3.128 million, the adjusted appropriation totaled P78.412 million. Hence, only 1.62 

per cent was allocated to GAD based on the adjusted total appropriation. The 



 

72 

 

attribution of costs to GAD activities had not been considered by the GAD Focal Point 

System (GFPS) in the formulation of the GPB. The actual expenditures for GAD 

projects and activities amounted to P141,360.05 or 11.10 per cent of the amount 

originally allocated to GAD. The non-attribution of costs to activities in the GPB 

resulted in GAD allocation below 5 per cent of the total appropriation for the year. 

 

The PMO’s CY 2020 GPB included 26 PAPs that were identified in the PMO 

GAD Strategic Plan (GADSP) for CY 2020-2025 which address gender-related issues 

and concerns of the agency. However, the PMO’s GAD Accomplishments Report 

(AR) showed that out of the 26 planned GAD PPAs, only nine were implemented, 

while 17 GAD-related projects and activities for 10 identified gender issues were not 

accomplished due to the issuance of DBM National Budget Circular (NBC) No. 580 

dated April 22, 2020, while some activities were agreed by the GFPS to be undertaken 

in CY 2021, as shown in Table 8.

With the non-implementation of planned PPAs, the related objectives to address 

the identified gender issues were not achieved as intended. 

 

 

6. Senior Citizens (SCs) and Persons with Disability (PWDs) 
 

The PMO formulated PAPs intended to address the concerns of SCs and PWDs 

in compliance with Section 32 of the GAA for FY 2020. However, the Plans, Programs, 

and Budget Report were not prepared at the beginning of the year.  

 



 

74 

 

Based on the submitted Plans, Programs, Budget, and Accomplishment Report 

related to SCs and PWDs for CY 2020, the PMO had a budget of P5.139 million for 

the benefit of SCs and PWDs. The said budget was utilized for the following 

plans/programs: (1) giving priority service to SCs and PWDs in business transactions 

with the PMO, and (2) providing employment opportunities to capable SCs and PWDs. 

The PMO maintained two gang chairs at the reception area, provided a drinking water 

station at the PMO lobby, and engaged the services of 13 capable SCs who were 

assigned under the different divisions of the PMO. The actual expenditures incurred by 

the PMO totaling P5.139 million were supported by complete documents as prescribed 

under COA Circular No. 2013-001 and were properly recognized in the books. 

 

The salaries paid to the 13 SCs, composed of Division Chief, Supervising 

Administrative Officer, Administrative Officer, six caretakers, three JO and one COS 

personnel, were attributed to the programs at a total cost of P5.127 milllion. 

 

 

7. Tax Laws and Regulations, GSIS and Pag-IBIG Premium Contributions and 
Loan Amortizations, and PhilHealth Premium Contributions 

 

The PMO generally complied with the provisions of the National Internal 

Revenue Code on withholding of taxes and prompt remittance of all taxes withheld in 

compliance with DOF-DBM-COA Joint Circular No. 1-2000 dated January 3, 2000, 

as amended, and with existing regulations on GSIS and Pag-IBIG premium 

contributions/loan amortization deductions, and PhilHealth contributions, deductions, 

and the related remittances, except for deductions on the unclaimed last pay of 

separated PMO employees which were remitted  to the concerned GOCCs on  March

8. GSIS Property Insurance Law 

 
In compliance with RA No. 656, insurable assets and properties of the PMO 

totaling P5.211 million were insured with the General Insurance Fund of the GSIS, 

with premium payments of P22,109.29.  Aside from assets and properties of the PMO, 

10 assets held for disposition totaling P749.453 million were insured, with premium 

payments of P4.900 million.  One of these assets is the North Davao Mining Corp. 

(NDMC) building where the office of the PMO is situated. The insurance policy of 

the said building covered all other property, equipment and furniture and fixtures of 

the PMO.  

 

 

9. Hiring of Casual, Job Orders, Contractual, and Consultant 
 

Despite the audit observation on COS personnel in the CY 2018 Annual Audit 

Report, the PMO had hired a total of 22 COS personnel as at December 31, 2020, 

representing additional workforce to the 68 regular plantilla employees, to provide 

administrative and technical assistance and such other related functions.  The Agency 

paid P9.067 million for the services of these contractual employees charged against 

MOOE. 

 

For CY 2020, the PMO executed COS for the hiring of Project Specialists even 

if the PMO is not conducting any special project. Such hiring was not in accordance 

with CSC-COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 1 s. 2017, as amended by Joint Circular No. 

1 s. 2018.   

 

 

10. Status of Audit Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges 
 

For CY 2020, Notices of Disallowance (NDs) totaling P74,503.90, pertaining 

to payments of group personal accident insurance to the GSIS for CYs 2017-2019, 

were issued while Notice of Settlement of Suspension/Disallowance/Charge (NSSDC)  

No. 2020-001 dated March 3, 2020 was issued for the settlement of ND No. 2011-10-
