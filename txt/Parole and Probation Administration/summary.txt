A)	Introduction



The Parole and Probation Administration (PPA), an attached agency under the Department of Justice (DOJ), is responsible in providing a less costly alternative to imprisonment of first-time offenders who are likely to respond to individualized community-based treatment programs. It was created by virtue of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 968, “The Probation Law of 1976”, to administer the probation system. Under Executive Order (EO) No. 292, “The Administrative Code of 1987,” the Probation Administration was renamed “Parole and Probation Administration” and given the added function of supervising prisoners who, after serving part of their sentence in jails are released on parole/pardon with parole conditions.

C)			Scope of Audit

		

The audit covered the operations and transactions of the Central Office (CO) and 16 Regional Offices (ROs) of PPA for CY 2020. 



D)			Independent Auditor’s Report

		

The Auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the consolidated financial statements of PPA as of December 31, 2020 due to accounting errors amounting to ₱17,350,711.56 or 1.91 percent of Total Expenditures which exceeded the materiality level of ₱4,543,183.82 as shown in Annex A of the report.



E)			Summary of Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations 

		

1)	The balance of the Cash and Cash Equivalents account amounting to ₱8,493,638.88 as of December 31, 2020 was inaccurate due to non-cancellation and reversion of stale and cancelled checks to the Cash-MDS, Regular account contrary to Treasury Circular No. 03-2017 dated October 20, 2017 and Sections 44 and 45, Chapter 6, Government Accounting Manual, Volume I; thus, affecting the fair presentation of Cash, Liability and Accumulated Surplus accounts in the financial statements.



We recommended and Management agreed to require the concerned Regional Accountants to prepare JEV to cancel stale check and communicate with the payee for its replacement and to revert the cancelled checks to the Cash account.



2)	The accuracy of the Inventories account balance of ₱7,179,056.83 as of December 31, 2020 is doubtful due to recognition of undelivered supplies and materials totaling ₱39,725.00 in the books of Region XIII contrary to Section 15, Chapter 8 of GAM Volume I and unreconciled Inventory balances between Accounting and Property records with discrepancy of ₱148,576.51 contrary to Sections 10 and 11, Chapter 8, Volume I, item A of Appendix 57 and items A and C of Appendix 66, GAM Volume II.



We recommended and Management agreed to: (a) ensure that all recorded inventories in Region XIII are already delivered, inspected, and accepted before recording the same in the books of accounts and to prepare necessary adjustments to reflect the correct balance of Inventory account; (b) direct the Regional Accountants and Supply/Property Officers to reconcile and investigate differences between their records before taking up necessary adjustments on affected Inventory and related Expense accounts duly supported with evidence/source documents; and (c) submit the Report of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI) and Report on the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) to the Audit Team and to maintain/update Stock Cards and Supplies Ledger Cards (SLCs to ensure proper accounting of inventories.



3)	The balance of the PPE accounts aggregating ₱202,252,458.66 as of December 31, 2020 was adversely affected by various accounting errors and deficiencies amounting to ₱272,306.06 and ₱3,251,676.56 respectively, which include non-provision of depreciation, erroneous recording of transactions, unreconciled accounting and property records, among others, contrary to the provisions of Chapter 5 and 19 of GAM Volume 1.



We recommended and Management agreed to: (a) prepare JEV to derecognize lost properties and set-up receivable from concerned accountable officers; (b) draw a JEV to adjust and correct the Accumulated Depreciation of Motor Vehicle in Region III; (c) draw a JEV to recognize the Allowance for Depreciation of procured Furniture and Fixtures, and Office Equipment in Region III; (d) use the proper account in recording transaction and make necessary adjustments to record correctly Loss on Sale of Unserviceable Property in the books of accounts; (e) direct the	concerned Regional Accountants and Supply/Property Officers to maintain and regularly update PPELC and PC to facilitate reconciliations of records as required under Section 42 of GAM Volume 1; (f) direct the concerned Inventory Committee to conduct periodic physical count of PPE to establish the actual condition/ existence of the reported PPE. Afterwards, prepare and submit the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) and Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) to the Audit Team within the prescribed period; (g) create Disposal Committee to facilitate disposal of unserviceable equipment to prevent further deterioration of the same which will lessen its residual value; and (h) upon disposal,  submit the IIRUP to the Accounting Division as basis in the derecognition  of the same from the books of accounts.



4)	The accuracy of the Accounts Payable balance of ₱2,336,298.72 as of December 31, 2020 could not be ascertained due to non-recognition in the books of various unpaid expenses contrary to Section 119 of PD 1145.



We recommended and Management agreed to take up all lawful expenditures and obligations incurred in Region V during the year in accordance with Section 119 of P.D. No. 1445.



5)	Various transactions were erroneously recorded and not properly classified in the books of accounts.



We recommended and Management agreed to direct the concerned Regional Accountant to record financial transactions under the proper accounts pursuant to the Revised Chart of Accounts.  



6)	The qualification standard for Volunteer Probation Assistants (VPAs) as provided in Section II of PPA Code of Ethics for VPAs dated January 23, 2018 was not observed by four Regional Offices based on the records of hired VPAs.



We recommended and Management agreed to: (a) use the Background Investigation Form in screening and selecting Volunteer Probation Assistants (VPAs) as prescribed in PPA Memorandum Order No. 17 dated February 24, 2016 and ensure strict compliance with required qualifications.  Moreover, maintain a complete personal file of VPAs for reference in screening and selection process; (b) submit Monthly Accomplishment Reports of VPAs and maintain a file for easy monitoring and assessment of their performances as basis in the renewal of their contract; (c) fully adhere to the guidelines set forth in PPA Memorandum No. 4 dated February 29, 2008 in the reimbursement of travelling expenses of appointed VPAs; and (d) ensure that VPAs have valid contract before paying their transportation allowance to avoid future disallowances.



7)	Various financial reports and its supporting documents were not submitted to the Audit Team within the prescribed period contrary to the existing regulations.



We recommended and Management agreed to immediately transmit the unsubmitted accounts and reports to the Audit Team and henceforth, adopt strategies taking into consideration the challenges posed by the current pandemic situation, to ensure that the required reports are submitted within the prescribed period of submission.



8)	Claims for various transactions totaling ₱16,860,503.17 were paid without complete documentations while unpaid obligations totaling ₱7,849,773.76 were recognized without adequate documentations contrary to Section 4.6 of PD 1445 and COA Circular No. 2012-001, rendering the regularity and validity of the transactions doubtful.   



We recommended and Management agreed to submit required documents to support claims for various transactions. For future similar claims, ensure that all disbursements of funds are supported with complete documentation to properly establish its propriety, validity and legality.



9)	Income generated from operations of dormitory was not remitted/deposited to the National Treasury as required under Section 4 of the General Provisions of RA No. 11465. Likewise, the agency has no authority to disburse the same in violation of Section 103 of PD 1445.
