2)	Section 44, Chapter 6, GAM Volume 1 for NGAs in relation to Treasury Circular No, 03-2017 dated October 20, 2017 entitled, “The Reduction in the Expiry Period of MDS Check from Six (6) Months to Three (3) Months from date of Issue” provides that: 



“Checks may be cancelled when they become stale, voided or spoiled. The depository bank considers a check stale, if it has been outstanding for over six months from date of issue or as prescribed. A stale, voided or spoiled check shall be marked cancelled on its face and reported as follows:



a)	Voided, spoiled or unclaimed stale checks with the Cashier shall be reported as cancelled in the List of Unreleased Checks that will be attached to the Report of Checks Issued (RCI).



b)	New checks may be issued for the replacement of stale/spoiled checks in the hands of payees or holders in due course, upon submission of the stale/ spoiled checks to the Accounting Division/Unit. A certified copy of previously paid Disbursement Vouchers (DVs) shall be attached to the request for replacement. A Journal Entry Voucher (JEV) shall be prepared to take up the cancellation. The replacement check shall be reported in the RCI."



3)	While, Section 45, Chapter 6, of the same Manual, prescribed the following Illustrative Accounting Entries for Cancelled Checks –



a)	Cancellation and Replacement of Stale/Voided/Spoiled MDS check issued in the current year:

To recognize the cancellation of stale/voided/spoiled MDS checks without replacement



4)	Examination of Cash-MDS, Regular account of PPA Region IV-A disclosed that JEV No. 100-2020-3-03 dated March 31, 2020 was drawn to take up the reversion of lapsed NCA in the 1st quarter of CY 2020 amounting to ₱2,085,132.49. Verification of bank statement for the month of April 2020 showed the amount of reverted NCA was only ₱1,782,226.66. The discrepancy pertained to the cancelled check per Advice of Checks Issued and Cancelled (ACIC) No. 20-03-024. 



5)	Further, check amounting to ₱2,143.03, remained outstanding for over nine months; hence, already stale and should be adjusted in the books of accounts.



6)	In Region VI, verification of the status of implementation of prior year’s audit recommendation on the Cash-in-Bank, MDS account revealed that stale check in favor of PPAMCO amounting to ₱3,842.00 has not yet been cancelled to date. The payee had already communicated with PPA but the check was not returned to the agency for cancellation and issuance of replacement. The Disbursing Officer issued the required certification that the check was not cleared by the bank and that the same has not been replaced. However, the same was not reverted to the Cash account at year-end. 



7)	Review of the bank reconciliation statement as of December 31, 2020 of Region VIII revealed that 10 checks totaling ₱17,000.00 have been outstanding for over three months. These checks become stale and due for cancellation, replacement, and/or adjustment in the books but remained unacted upon.



8)	This practice resulted in the understatement of Cash and Cash Equivalents by  ₱325,890.86, Accounts Payable by ₱22,985.03 and Accumulated Surplus by ₱302,905.83.



9)	We recommended and Management agreed to require the concerned Regional Accountants to prepare JEV to cancel stale check and communicate with the payee for its replacement and to revert the cancelled checks to the Cash account.



Management Comment



10)	Management commented that: 



a)	Regional Accountant of Region IV-A prepared JEV No. 2021/03/03 to set up liability for prior year cancelled check. In addition, cancelled check amounting to ₱302,905.83 was reflected in April-December 2020 Bank Reconciliation Statements; 



b)	Regional Accountant of PPA Region VI was advised to prepare JEV to recognize the cancellation of stale check and its replacement was made upon receipt of the check from the PPAMCO on May 12, 2021; and



c)	Regional Accountant of PPA Region VIII was advised to immediately prepare the necessary adjusting entries and replace the stale checks upon surrendering of the original issued checks.



Misstated Inventory accounts



2)	The accuracy of the Inventories account balance of ₱7,179,056.83 as of December 31, 2020 is doubtful due to recognition of undelivered supplies and materials totaling ₱39,725.00 in the books of Region XIII contrary to Section 15, Chapter 8 of GAM Volume I and unreconciled Inventory balances between Accounting and Property records with discrepancy of ₱148,576.51 contrary to Sections 10 and 11, Chapter 8, Volume I, item A of Appendix 57 and items A and C of Appendix 66, GAM Volume II.



a)	Incorrect recognition of inventory items



1)	Section 15, Chapter 8 of GAM Volume I provides the process of Receipt, Inspection, Acceptance and Recording Deliveries of Inventory Items.



2)	Item 7 of Section 15, Chapter 8 of GAM Volume I states that “Based on Copy 3 of the Inspection and Acceptance Report (IAR) and photocopy of Purchase Order (PO) and Delivery Receipt (DR), prepares JEV to recognize the receipt of inventory items in the books of account. Signs the “Prepared by” portion of the JEV and forwards the JEV and supporting documents (SDs) to the Chief Accountant/Head of the Accounting Division/Unit for approval.”



3)	Verification of records showed that inventories totaling ₱39,725.00 not yet delivered as to date were recorded in the books by debiting Inventory and crediting Accounts Payable even without the required documents contrary to Section 15, Chapter 8 of GAM Volume I. Breakdown of inventories is as follows:



Other Supplies and Material Inventory

₱17,150.00

Semi-Expendable ICT

11,000.00

Semi-Expendable Office Equipment

11,575.00

Total

₱39,725.00



4)	We recommended and Management agreed to ensure that all recorded inventories in Region XIII are already delivered, inspected, and accepted before recording the same in the books of accounts and to prepare necessary adjustments to reflect the correct balance of Inventory account.  



Management Comment



5)	Management advised the Regional Accountant of PPA Region XIII to strictly recognize and record inventories only upon delivery, duly inspected and accepted by the Property/ Supply Officer.  It was adjusted in February 2021.



b)	Unreconciled Inventory balances between Accounting and Property Records



6)	Paragraph 29(b) of IPSAS, provides that fair presentation requires an entity to present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable, and understandable information.  



7)	Verification and analysis of Inventory accounts as at December 31, 2020 disclosed difference totaling ₱114,297.45 between balances reflected in the books of accounts and submitted RPCI, contrary to Sections 10 and 11, Chapter 8, GAM Volume I, item A of Appendix 57 and items A and C of Appendix 66, GAM Volume II, to wit:

9)	Further, non-maintenance and updating of the required forms and reports added to the cause of unreconciled inventory balances between accounting and property records. The Report of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI) and Report on the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) were also not submitted to the Audit Team within the prescribed period contrary to existing regulations.

b)	submit the Report of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI) and Report on the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) to the Audit Team and to maintain/update Stock Cards and Supplies Ledger Cards (SLCs) to ensure proper accounting of inventories. 



Management Comment



11)	Management commented that:



a)	The Regional Accountant of Region IV-A prepared JEV No. 2021/03/03 to record Office Supplies Inventory and Semi-expendable Expenses. The Supply/Property Officer was instructed to include Accountable Forms Inventory in the RPCI and the Accounting Section to maintain Supplies Ledger Cards (SLC);



b)	In PPA Region IV-B, upon reconciliation of accounts and records, they found out that the variance of ₱21,152.00 relates to balances of Medical Supplies Inventory for Distribution of the Region, specially, drug testing kits from DOH. Management agreed to revise the  RPCI in order to correct balances of inventory accounts affected and reflect total ₱21,152.00 separately from Office Supplies Inventory; and



c)	The Regional Directors instructed the concerned officials to update and reconcile all records, conduct periodic physical count, and submit reports on time to the concerned Audit Team.



Errors and deficiencies affecting Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE)

 

3)	The balance of the PPE accounts aggregating ₱202,252,458.66 as of December 31, 2020 was adversely affected by various accounting errors and deficiencies amounting to ₱272,306.06 and ₱3,251,676.56 respectively, which include non-provision of depreciation, erroneous recording of transactions, unreconciled accounting and property records, among others, contrary to the provisions of Chapter 5 and 19 of GAM Volume 1.

The loss shall be charged to account “Loss of Assets” at an amount equal to its carrying amount.”



4)	The AOs have already submitted the Report of Lost, Stolen, Damaged, Destroyed Property (RLSDDP) along with supporting documents necessary to support their claim. However, they were not able to submit their application for relief from property accountability to the Audit Team.  



5)	We recommended and Management agreed to prepare JEV to derecognize lost properties and set-up receivable from concerned accountable officers.

14)	Loss on Sale of Unserviceable Property of PPA-CO was overstated by ₱1,200.44 due to erroneous recording of Accumulated Depreciation contrary to Section 27 Chapter 10 of GAM Volume I. Moreover, the use of Other Assets account was not in accordance with the GAM Volume III, the Revised Chart of Account (RCA).



15)	The fully depreciated unserviceable Office Equipment and ICT Equipment with carrying value of ₱284,790.00 and ₱1,430,174.24 respectively, were disposed through sale in CY 2020.

17)	Moreover, the Accountant debited the residual value of unserviceable properties to Other Assets account instead of Loss on Sale-Unserviceable Property amounting to ₱86,948.65 and credited the same amount to Other Assets. The use of Other Asset account was contrary to GAM Volume III the RCA. Details are as follows:

30)	The non-disposal of these unserviceable properties at the earliest possible time exposes such properties to further deterioration and loss of their value. It also deprived the National Government of possible income that could have been realized from sale of these unserviceable properties.



31)	We recommended and the Regional Directors agreed to:



a)	create Disposal Committee to facilitate disposal of unserviceable equipment to prevent further deterioration of the same which will lessen its residual value; and



b)	upon disposal, submit the IIRUP to the Accounting Division as basis in the derecognition of the same from the books of accounts.

h)	In other PPA Regional Offices, they acknowledged the audit observations and committed that they will immediately prepare necessary adjusting entry suggested by the Audit Team.



COMPLIANCE AUDIT



Volunteer Probation Assistants (VPAs)



6)	The qualification standard for Volunteer Probation Assistants (VPAs) as provided in Section II of PPA Code of Ethics for VPAs dated January 23, 2018 was not observed by four Regional Offices based on the records of hired VPAs.



	1)	Volunteerism is a program of PPA aimed at generating maximum, effective and efficient citizen participation and community involvement in the process of client rehabilitation, prevention of crime and overall administration of criminal justice.



	2)	PD No. 968 permits employment of Volunteer Probation Assistants (VPA) specifically under Section  28 which states: To assist the Provincial or City Probation Officers in the supervision of probationers, the Probation Administrator may appoint citizens of good repute and probity to act as probation aides as amended under RA 10707 as: To assist the Chief Probation and Parole Officers in the supervised treatment program of the probationers, the Probation Administrator may appoint citizens of good repute and probity, who have the willingness, aptitude, and capability to act as VPAs.



	3)	VPA is defined under Section 6 of RA 10707 as, persons that are trained and appointed to render various volunteer work and services to regional, provincial, and city probation office without pay.



	4)	Section II of the PPA Code of Ethics for VPAs dated January 23, 2018 enumerates the qualifications of a VPA, as follows:



		i)	Citizens of good repute and probity, who have willingness, aptitude and capability to act as VPA;

		ii)	Preferably twenty-five (25) years old and above;

		iii)	Preferably a resident of the same community as the client;

		iv)	Willing to serve without compensation;

		v)	Capable to prepare reports;

		vi)	No criminal conviction, however, former clients with exemplary behavior fit to be role models may be considered; and

		vii)	Of good health.



	5)	Based on the results of compliance audit performed by Audit Teams of PPA NCR, CAR, Region I, and XIII on the VPA program of the agency, it was found that they are not compliant in Section II of PPA Code of Ethics for VPAs.



	6)	During the audit, the following observations were noted: 



REGION

RESULTS OF AUDIT

NCR

Out of 123 VPAs, three are residing far from the place of assignment and one is under 25 years of age.



The database of VPAs lacked information as to qualifications of volunteers. Moreover, no complete file of Monthly Accomplishment Reports was submitted by VPAs to the Chief PPO.

CAR

Transportation allowances in PPA CAR amounting to ₱6,000.00 were paid to various VPAs despite expiration of their appointment contrary to Section 28 of PD No 968; thus, considered irregular.

I

Qualification standards (such as age, adequate source of income, proof of no criminal records, proof of adequate good health, and basic training course) in accepting VPAs were not followed as required under PPA Code of Ethics for VPAs.

XIII

Non-observance on the use of prescribed Background Investigation Form in the screening and selection process of VPAs  and non-maintenance of complete personal file/documents of VPAs rendering the evaluation of qualifications of would-be volunteers could not be easily ascertained;  hence, inconsistent with the provisions of Section 58 of the PPA Omnibus Rules on Probation Methods and Procedures  and PPA Memorandum No. 17 dated February 24, 2016.  



Payment of Traveling Expenses in PPA Region XIII amounting to ₱9,150.00 was issued directly to the Chief Parole and Probation Officers (CPPO)/OIC and paid traveling expenses to VPAs with an expired appointment, casting doubts on the regularity and validity of transactions.



	7)	We recommended and Management agreed to:



a)	use the Background Investigation Form in screening and selecting Volunteer Probation Assistants (VPAs) as prescribed in PPA Memorandum Order No. 17 dated February 24, 2016 and ensure strict compliance with required qualifications.  Moreover, maintain a complete personal file of VPAs for reference in screening and selection process;



b)	submit Monthly Accomplishment Reports of VPAs and maintain a file for easy monitoring and assessment of their performances as basis in the renewal of their contract;



c)	fully adhere to the guidelines set forth in PPA Memorandum No. 4 dated February 29, 2008 in the reimbursement of travelling expenses of appointed VPAs; and



d)	ensure that VPAs have valid contract before paying their transportation allowance to avoid future disallowances.



Management Comment



	8)	Management commented that:



a)	In NCR, Management explained that VPA whose address is in Misamis Oriental and assigned at Manila Parole and Probation Office No. 3 also resides in Sta. Mesa, Manila which made him qualified to be a volunteer for Manila Field Office. While the other two VPAs who are residing in Makati and Valenzuela acted as Resource Persons in the conduct of Therapeutic Community Trainings held in their affiliated church. Accordingly, they will revisit the application form given to applicants to have a comprehensive information of volunteers and committed to submit the Monthly Accomplishment Report of VPAs. 



b)	In CAR, they will make sure that VPAs have valid contracts/appointments before paying transportation allowance.



c)	In Region I, they will adhere to the guidelines set in the recruitment of VPAs. 



d)	In Region XIII, they will fully adhere to the guidelines set in PPA Memorandum No. 4 dated Feb. 29, 2008 on Reimbursement of Traveling Expenses of Appointed VPAs supervising clients.

f)	In other PPA Regions, they instructed the concerned officials to comply with the COA Circular 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012.



				Unremitted Income to the National Treasury

				

9)	Income generated from operations of dormitory was not remitted/deposited to the National Treasury as required under Section 4 of the General Provisions of RA No. 11465. Likewise, the agency has no authority to disburse the same in violation of Section 103 of PD 1445.



	1)	Section 4 of the General Provisions of RA No. 11465 GAA of 2020 states that: Receipts or Revenues Collected by the Agencies. As a general rule, all fees, charges, assessments and other receipts or revenues collected by departments, bureaus and offices of the National Government, including Constitutional Offices enjoying fiscal autonomy in the exercise of their mandated functions, at such rates as are now or may be approved by the appropriate approving authority shall be deposited to the National Treasury as income of the General Fund pursuant to Section 44, Chapter 5 Book VI of EO No. 292 s. 1987 and Section 65 of PD No. 1445.



Exceptions to the foregoing are:



a)	Receipts authorized by law to be recorded as a Special Account in the General Fund, Trust Fund, or a fund other than General Fund which shall be established in accordance with rules and regulations as may be issued by the Permanent Committee (the "Permanent Committee") created under Section 45, Chapter 5, Book VI of E.O. No. 292. The said special funds may be made available for expenditure, subject to any special provision of the agencies concerned; and



b)	Other instances authorized by law.

Disbursements on expenditures by agencies from use or retention of income absent the above legal authority or from income deposited outside of the National Treasury without legal basis shall be void and shall subject the erring officials and employees to disciplinary actions in accordance with Section 43, Chapter 5, and Section 80, Chapter 7, Book VI of E.O. No. 292, and to appropriate criminal action under existing laws.”



	2)	Section 103 of PD 1445 states that:



“General liability for unlawful expenditures. Expenditures of government funds or uses of government property in violation of law or regulations shall be a personal liability of the official or employee found to be directly responsible therefor.”



	3)	The PPA converted the former office of the abolished Commission on the Settlement of Land Problems (COSLAP) to a dormitory costing a total amount of ₱345,985.66. The said dormitory caters government officials and employees who need a temporary shelter. PPA charges a rate ₱200.00 per day per PPA employee and ₱300 per non- PPA employee as lodging fee to defray its operating and maintenance expenses. Most occupants were officials and employees of PPA who attended seminars or conferences in Manila.



	4)	Scrutiny of the Reports of Collections and Deposits for seven years (2013-2019) the annual average collections were ₱277,419.64. However, due to COVID 19 pandemic, most of the scheduled trainings for CY 2020 were cancelled/ converted to Webinars. Hence, for CY 2020 collections totaled to ₱29,700.00 only. The total collections since then amounted to ₱1,971,637.50 which are deposited to LBP Account No. 1872103550.



	5)	Further, the expenses related to maintenance and operations of the dormitory were charged from its collections. For eight years of operations, the dormitory incurred expenses totaling ₱1,619,394.64 leaving a balance of ₱352,242.86. These expenses pertained to Office Supplies Expense, Repairs and Maintenance – Building, and Other Maintenance and Operating Expenses. 



	6)	In addition, the Cashier was designated as Special Disbursing Officer under Special Order No. 362 s. 15 and granted Petty Cash Fund of ₱5,000.00 to cover expenses related to the operations of the dormitory and Multi-Purpose Hall.



	7)	This practice is contrary to the General Provisions of RA No. 11465 GAA of 2020 which require the remittance of revenues to the National Treasury. Likewise, the agency has no legal basis to utilize the same in violation of Section 103 of PD 1445.



	8)	We recommended that Management require the Cashier to remit all collections from lodging fees to the Bureau of the Treasury in compliance with Section 4 of the General Provisions of RA 11465. 



Management Comment



	9)	Management commented that collections are yet to be remitted to the BTr, because Management has decided to seek an authority to use the fund generated from the dormitory and Multi-Purpose Hall. While said request is on process, the collections remain in the PPA-CO trust account in LBP.

				

Gender and Development (GAD)



10)	Commendably, Management was able to mainstream or integrate its projects and programs for GAD related activities in compliance with Section 4.3 and 4.4 of Joint Circular No. 2004-1 of the DBM, NEDA and NCFRW.



	1)	DBM-NEDA-NCRFW Joint Circular No. 2004-1 dated April 5, 2004.



Section 4.3 states that: The conduct of massive information, education and communication campaigns on the gender issue/s being addressed by the agency and on corresponding agency programs, activities, and projects shall be given priority in terms of budget allocation.



	2)	Section 4.4 states that: GAD planning and budgeting shall be observed annually and incorporated in all programming and budgeting exercises of agencies. The GAD activities in the GAD plan and budget must be included in the agency budget proposal in accordance with the budget call. Agencies shall ensure that the cost of implementing the GAD activities is part of their approved budget. At least five percent (5%) of the total agency budget appropriations as authorized under the annual General Appropriations Act shall correspond to activities supporting GAD xxx.



	3)	The Agency spent a total of ₱57,359,679.87, representing 6.06 percent of the total appropriations of ₱946,162,000.00 for GAD Programs. Validation of compliance to the implementation of GAD related programs/activities disclosed the following:
