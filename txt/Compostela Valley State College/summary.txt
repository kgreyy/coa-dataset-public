EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

 

 

A. Introduction 
 

By virtue of Republic Act (RA) No.  10598, otherwise known as “An Act  

Establishing a State College in the Municipality of Compostela, Province of Compostela 

Valley,” the Compostela Valley State College (CVSC) was created.  The College was 

established on June 4, 2013 with the mandate of providing quality education to all, 

providing highly skilled, globally competitive, morally and socially responsive graduates.  

CVSC integrates as regular branches the Bukidnon State University External Study Centers 

in the Municipalities of Maragusan, Montevista and New Bataan.  To realize its core 

mandate, the College offered undergraduate programs like Bachelor of Secondary 

Education, Bachelor in Elementary Education, Bachelor of Science in Entrepreneurship 

and Bachelor of Science in Agriculture.   Its main campus is located at the center of the 

Municipality of Compostela, Compostela Valley Province. 

 

The College is headed by Dr. Christie Jean V. Ganiera, President.  She was 

appointed in June 2016 by the Commission on Higher Education Chairperson Patricia B. 

Licuanan and CVSC Board of Trustees vice Dr. Jonathan A. Bayogan, the Officer-in-

Charge and the incumbent President of Davao del Norte State College. 

 

 

B. Audit Methodology  
 

The Commission on Audit has been implementing risk-based audit in the conduct 

of its audit services.  However, to meet the evolving developments in public governance 

and fund management, the results-based audit approach was incorporated.  The integration 

of these two approaches, called the Integrated Results and Risk-Based Audit (IRRBA) 

Methodology was applied in the audit of the accounts and operations of the CVSC. 

 

 

C. Scope of Audit 
 

The audit covered the review of accounts and operations of CVSC for CY 2020. 

The audit consisted of review of operating procedures, evaluation of the CVSC’s programs 

and projects, interview of concerned government officials and employees, verification, 

reconciliation, analysis of accounts and such other procedures considered necessary. 

 

 

D. Financial Highlights 
 

1. Sources and Applications of Funds 
 

In the implementation of programs, projects and activities, the College has 

generated sufficient cash derived from grants and donations from other national agencies 



ii 

 

intended for the implementation of special projects and the subsidy it received from the 

national government. The College also derived its income from collection of tuition and 

other fees that were constituted as Special Trust Fund (164) by virtue of RA 8292. 

  

 The following is the summary of appropriations, allotments and obligations of 

CVSC for CY 2020 with comparative figures of CY 2019 by virtue of RA 11465 or the FY 

2020 General Appropriations Act including budgets approved by the Board of Trustees per 

BOT Resolution No. 38, s. 2019 and Resolution No. 11, s. 2020 for Program of Receipts 

and Expenditures (PRE) for CY 2020, viz:

Reverted 856,831.06 572,543.20 284,287.86 49.65% 

 

 The decrease in the FY 2020 GAA particularly on Capital Outlay appropriations 

was attributable to the discontinuance of appropriated P/A/Ps as of March 31, 2020 to fund 

the operations and response measures related to the COVID-19 emergency situation per 

National Budget Circular No. 580 dated April 22, 2020. 

 

2. The financial position and performance of the CVSC as at December 31, 2020, with 
comparative figures for 2019, are summarized as follows:

Surplus (Deficit) for the period 77,543,888.32 54,702,820.11 22,841,068.20 41.75% 

 

The assets, liabilities and net assets/equity of CVSC as at December 31, 2020, 

compared to last year's balances have significantly increased, thus indicating a relatively 

stable and fair financial position as at year-end.   The significant increase of the assets were 



iii 

 

attributable to the purchase/construction of infrastructure projects. The increase in 

liabilities resulted from the increase in Inter-Agency Fund Transfers. 

 

The increase in total revenue can be attributed mainly from the receipt of inter-

agency fund transfers and trust receipts for procurement of machineries and equipment, 

motor vehicles, construction of buildings and other structures. The significant increase in 

expenses was due to the increase in the payment of professional services, salaries of 

employees due to promotion and salary standardization, Communication Expenses, Other 

personnel benefits and terminal leave benefits. The decrease in Subsidy is due to reversal 

of unused Notice of Cash Allocation. (NCA). 

 

 

E. Auditor’s Opinion on the Financial Statements  
 

The Auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the 

financial statements of the Compostela Valley State College for CY 2020 because of the 

exception noted in audit as discussed in detail in Part II of this Report as follows: 

  

a. The delayed submission of the CY 2020 Report on the Physical Count of 

Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) prevented the Auditor from 

conducting timely verification on the existence, condition, ownership, and 

valuation of the PPEs, casting doubt on the accuracy of the balances reported 

in the books at P318,956,192.94.   

 

b. The delayed submission of the Report on Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) 

casts doubt on the integrity of property custodianship, as well as the accuracy 

and reliability of the balance of Inventories Held for Consumption as at 

December 31, 2020 in the total amount of P704,913.35. 

 

 

F. Summary of Significant Observations and Recommendations 
 

  The following are the significant audit observations and recommendations for the 

year 2020, which were duly discussed with CVSC officials concerned last February 26, 

2021.  Management’s views and comments were incorporated in the report where 

appropriate.  

 

1. The delayed submission of the CY 2020 Report on the Physical Count of 

Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) by the Supply Officer contravened 

Section 38, Chapter 10 of GAM Volume 1; hence, prevented the Auditor from 

conducting timely verification on the existence, condition, ownership, and 

valuation of the PPEs, casting doubt on the accuracy of the balances reported 

in the books at P318,956,192.94.   

 



iv 

 

We recommend that Management strictly comply with the submission of the Report 

on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) within the 

prescribed deadline pursuant to Section 38, Chapter 10 of the GAM Volume 1. 

Otherwise, the proper sanctions for inefficiency shall be imposed upon the 

personnel concerned. 

 

2. The balances of the Office Supplies and Other Supplies and Materials 

Inventory per actual verification were less than the balances per Stock Cards 

as reported by the Supply Officer, contrary to the applicable provisions of 

GAM Volume 1, an indication that movements of some inventory items were 

not properly and completely accounted for, thus resulting in an inaccurate 

reporting and affecting the reliability, accuracy and existence of the Inventory 

account balance amounting to P704,913.35 as at December 31, 2020.  

 

We recommended that Management: 

 

a. Require the Supply Officer to submit a written explanation on the variances 
noted between the audit team’s actual verification against his records. Annex A 

is herein provided for reference; 

 

b. Advise the Supply Officer to improve the Stock Cards and also maintain a soft 
copy thereof for easy referencing and record-keeping; and 

 

3. Failure to submit the Report on Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) within 

the prescribed deadline contravened Chapter 8, Volume 1 of the GAM, thus 

raising questions on the integrity of property custodianship, as well as the 

accuracy and reliability on the balance of Inventories Held for Consumption 

as at December 31, 2020 in the total amount of P704,913.35. 

 

We recommended that Management: 

 

a. Require the Supply Officer to submit the Report on the Physical Count of 
Inventories (RPCI) as soon as possible pursuant to Section 13, Chapter 8 of the 

GAM Volume 1. 

 

4. The FY 2020 GAD Plan and Budget totaling to P3,989,220.00 was belatedly 

prepared and submitted and not PCW-approved contrary to Section V of 

COA Circular No. 2014-001 dated March 18, 2014, PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint 

Circular 2012-01, and PCW Memorandum Circular No. 2019-02 dated August 

01, 2019, thereby resulting in uncertainty as to the determination of the 

Programs/Projects/Activities promoting gender equality and women 

empowerment of the University. 

 



v 

 

We recommend that Management strictly comply with PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint 

Circular No. 2012-01, COA Circular 2014-001 and always keep updated of yearly 

PCW-issued circulars and guidelines pertaining to GAD.
