OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

 

 

FINANCIAL AUDIT 

 

Property, Plant and Equipment 

 

1. The delayed submission of the CY 2020 Report on the Physical Count of Property, 
Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) by the Supply Officer contravened Section 38, 

Chapter 10 of GAM Volume 1; hence, prevented the Auditor from conducting timely 

verification on the existence, condition, ownership, and valuation of the PPEs, casting 

doubt on the accuracy of the balances reported in the books at P318,956,192.94.   

 

Section 38, Chapter 10 of GAM Vol. 1 requires that the entity shall have a periodic 

physical count of PPE, which shall be done annually and presented on the Report on the 

Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) as at December 31 of each 

year. This shall be submitted to the auditor concerned not later than January 31 of the 

following year. 

 

Section 58 of PD 1445 - Audit of Assets provides that: 

 

The examination and audit of assets shall be performed with a view to 

ascertaining their existence, ownership, valuation and encumbrances as well 

as the propriety of items composing the respective asset accounts, 

determining their agreement with records, proving the accuracy of such 

records; ascertaining if the assets were utilized economically, efficiently 

and effectively; and evaluating the adequacy of controls over the accounts. 

 

The Consolidated Financial Statements of the Compostela Valley State College 

showed a total of P318,956,192.94 for the Property, Plant and Equipment accounts, net of 

the Accumulated Depreciation as at December 31, 2020, details of such balance are 

presented as follows:

Subtotal 92,242,601.41 

Grand total P318,956,192.94 

 

The Property/Supply Officer submitted its RPCPPE to the Office of the Auditor 

only on February 10, 2021 which was already beyond the prescribed deadline despite 

several reminders made by the Office of the Auditor, in contravention to Section 38, 

Chapter 10 of GAM Vol. 1. This prevented the Audit Team from making further 

verifications on the assets’ existence, condition, ownership, valuation and determining 

their agreement with records, proving the accuracy of such records and the adequacy of 

controls over them. Had the report been rendered and submitted on time, any material 

deficiencies could have been discovered and corrected in a timely manner. 

 

With the foregoing condition, it can be concluded that the account balance of PPE 

in the financial statements cannot be relied upon. 

 

Recommendation/s: 

 

We recommended that Management strictly comply with the submission of the 

Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) within 

the prescribed deadline pursuant to Section 38, Chapter 10 of the GAM Volume 1. 

Otherwise, the proper sanctions for inefficiency shall be imposed upon the personnel 

concerned. 

 

Management’s Comments: 

  

The College through the Supply Officer committed to comply Section 38, Chapter 

10 of the GAM Volume 1 on the submission of the Report on the Physical Count of 

Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) within the reglementary period. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

Management’s action is well taken. The documents submitted were evaluated by the audit 

team and found in order.

Inventories 

 

2. The balances of the Office Supplies and Other Supplies and Materials Inventory per 
actual verification were less than the balances per Stock Cards as reported by the 

Supply Officer, contrary to the applicable provisions of GAM Volume 1, an indication 

that movements of some inventory items were not properly and completely accounted 

for, thus resulting in an inaccurate reporting and affecting the reliability, accuracy 

and existence of the Inventory account balance amounting to P704,913.35 as at 

December 31, 2020. 

 

Section 17(b) Chapter 8 Volume 1 of GAM for NGAs provides that: 

            

Stock Card (SC) shall be used to record all receipts and issues of supplies 

and the balance in quantity at any time.  It shall be maintained by the 

Property and /or Supply Division/Unit for each item in stock.  The IAR, 

RIS, PO and DR serve as the original sources of information for making 

entries on the card. 

 

To validate the existence on whether or not the stocks on hand as reflected in the 

Stock Cards tally with the actual inventory in stock, the audit team conducted a surprise 

verification of Inventories Held for Consumption at the bodega of the Compostela Valley 

State College-Main Campus last January 27, 2021. The sample items counted or 50% of 

them were compared to the balances reflected in the Stock Cards maintained by the Supply 

Officer and noted the following variances, viz:

Our inspection included checking if Stock Cards were maintained. Upon inquiry 

with the stockroom personnel, he said that their Stock Cards were not fully updated yet and 

they were still in the process of completing their inventory-taking activities and the 

preparation of the Report on the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) which will be due 

not later than January 31, 2021. Although we commend the Supply Office for maintaining 

Stock Cards, the cards could have been improved in such a way that it would be easier for 

the custodian/personnel-in-charge to refer to his records when preparing the RPCI as the 

Stock Cards are source documents needed in preparing the RPCI. Also, keeping a soft copy 

is advisable nowadays for a much easier data access instead of keeping a hard copy.  

 

It was observed in the previous year’s audit findings that the RPCI of the Supply 

Officer did not tally with the audit team’s actual verification of inventory and that 

according to the Supply Officer, the differences were attributed to those RISs not gathered 

as they were still at the various end-user units pending signature from the authorized 

personnel. For CY 2020, the same condition still exists which contributed to the non-

updating of the Stock Cards. This condition resulted in an overstated or inaccurate 

reporting of stocks on hand and an indication that movements of some inventory items may 

not be properly and completely accounted for. As summarized in the result of the audit 

team’s verification, quantity per count was less than the quantity per stock cards and no 

additional RISs between January 1 to 27, 2021, if any, were shown to account for the 

difference. 

 

3. Failure to submit the Report on Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) within the 
prescribed deadline contravened Chapter 8, Volume 1 of the GAM, thus raising 

questions on the integrity of property custodianship, as well as the accuracy and 

reliability on the balance of Inventories Held for Consumption as at December 31, 

2020 in the total amount of P704,913.35. 

            

Section 13, Chapter 8 of the GAM Volume 1 prescribes that: 

 

Physical count/inventory, which is required semi-annually, is an 

indispensable procedure for checking the integrity of property 

custodianship. 

  

The report shall be submitted to the COA Auditor concerned not later than 

July 31 and January 31 of each year for the first and second semesters, 

respectively. 

 

As at December 31, 2020, the Inventory Held for Consumption account showed the 

following balances: 

 

Account Fund Balance, 12/31/2020 

Inventory Held for Consumption 



56 
 

Office Supplies Inventory 101 P603,052.35 

Other Supplies and Materials Inventory 164 P101,861.00 

Total  P 704,913.35 

 

To date, there was no RPCI submitted yet to the Office of the Auditor which means 

that the Supply Officer incurred delay in the submission of said report contrary to 

prevailing rules and regulations. Without this report, there would be no basis for the 

College to check the integrity of property custodianship on the inventories because the 

report gives information about the whereabouts, conditions and other relevant information 

noted during the physical count and the College would have no means of verifying whether 

the book balance shown above actually exists since the RPCI must be reconciled regularly 

with the Accountant’s Supplies Ledger Card (SLC) and any discrepancy shall be verified 

and/or adjusted accordingly to reflect the correct balance of inventory. As a result, the 

accuracy and reliability of the balance as at December 31, 2020 is deemed questionable. 

  

Recommendation/s: 

 

We recommended that the Management: 

 

a. Require the Supply Officer to submit a written explanation on the variances 

noted between the audit team’s actual verification against his records. Annex 

C is herein provided for reference; 

 

b. Advise the Supply Officer to improve the Stock Cards and also maintain a soft 

copy thereof for easy referencing and record-keeping; and 

 

c. Require the Supply Officer to submit the Report on the Physical Count of 

Inventories (RPCI) as soon as possible pursuant to Section 13, Chapter 8 of 

the GAM Volume 1. 

 

Management’s Comments: 

  

The variances noted between the audit team’s actual verification against his records 

is there were issuances of office supplies and other supplies and materials between the 

months of December, 2020 and early part of January 2021 when the Audit Team conducted 

the actual verification in the stock room on January 27, 2021. 

 

The Property and Supply Management Section is in the process of improving the 

stock cards. For easy referencing, the Property and Supply Management Section will 

maintain a soft copy of all stock cards for a fast recording of the movements of inventory 

items and Supply Officer humbly asks for consideration for its delayed submission. 

  

 

 



57 
 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

Management’s action is well taken. 

  

 

COMPLIANCE AUDIT 

 

Gender and Development (GAD) 

 

4. The FY 2020 GAD Plan and Budget totaling to P3,989,220.00 was belatedly prepared 
and submitted and not PCW-approved contrary to Section V of COA Circular No. 

2014-001 dated March 18, 2014, PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular 2012-01, and 

PCW Memorandum Circular No. 2019-02 dated August 01, 2019, thereby resulting 

in uncertainty as to the determination of the Programs/Projects/Activities promoting 

gender equality and women empowerment of the University. 
 

Section V of COA Circular No. 2014-001 states that:  

 

Responsibility of the Audited Agency: The Audited Agency shall submit 

a copy of the Annual GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) to the COA Audit 

Team assigned to the agency within five (5) working days from the 

receipt of the approved plan from the PCW or their mother or central 

offices as the case maybe. Likewise, a copy of the corresponding 

Accomplishment Report shall be furnished the said Audit Team within 

five (5) working days from the end of January of the preceding year. 

(Emphasis ours) 

 

On the other hand, the preparation and submission of the Annual GPB and AR is 

prescribed by Joint Circular (JC) No. 2012-01 issued by the DBM, NEDA and PCW, as 

follows: 

 

8.0  SUBMISSION, REVIEW AND ENDORSEMENT OF AGENCY 

GAD PLANS AND BUDGETS 

 

8.1 Pursuant to Section 37A.1 of the MCW-IRR, all agencies, 

offices, bureaus and all government instrumentalities and 

others concerned shall formulate their annual GPBs within 

the context of their mandates. -xxx-  

 

8.1.2  SUCs with several constituent units shall observe the 

same process of submission. The Commission on 

Higher Education (CHED) or its designated regional 

offices or gender resource centers shall review the 

submissions of SUCs and forward the same to PCW 

for endorsement to DBM. -xxx- 

 



58 
 

10.0 PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION OF GAD 

ACCOMPLISHMENT REPORTS  

 

10.1 Attached agencies, bureaus, regional offices, constituent 

units and all others concerned shall submit their GAD ARs 

to their central offices. The agency GFPS shall prepare the 

annual GAD AR based on the PCW-endorsed GPB or the 

GPB adjusted to the approved GAA following the form 

prescribed in Annex B. Activities completed until the end 

of the year may be included in the final GAD AR of 

agency submitted to PCW in January. (Emphasis ours) 

  

Furthermore, PCW MC No. 2019-02 dated August 01, 2019 with the subject: 

Preparation and Online Submission of FY 2020 Gender and Development (GAD) Plans 

and Budgets prescribes the online submission through the Gender Mainstreaming 

Monitoring System (GMMS), to wit: 

 

Process of Submission 

 

1.2.2.3 In the case of state universities and colleges (SUCs), in line with 

CHED Memorandum Order No. 1, s. 2015, SUC GPBs shall first be 

submitted to and reviewed by the concerned regional office of the 

Commission on Higher Education (CHED). After which, the CHED 

regional office shall endorse the GPB to the CHED Central Office 

for validation. Once the GPBs are acceptable to the CHED Central 

Office, it shall submit the GPB to PCW, for review and 

endorsement. -xxx- 

 

1.2.4.1 PCW shall endorse the FY 2020 GPB if the agency complies with 

all the requested revisions (if any) in the GPB within the prescribed 

deadline. 

 

1.2.4.2 PCW-endorsed GPBs shall be authenticated by the GMMS with a 

QR code. Concerned agencies shall print the endorsed GPB for 

signature of their agency head and submit signed copies to PCW and 

their respective COA Audit Team within 5 working days from 

endorsement. 

  

2.1  The submission, review and endorsement of GPBs shall be 

coursed through the GMMS, PCW’s online system for managing 

GAD profiles, GPBs and GAD ARs, as well as for generating GAD-

related reports. (Emphasis ours) 

 

2.2  Agencies that do not have or need to update their user account/s in 

the GMMS may download the registration form found at the PCW 

website (www.pcw.gov.ph/gmms) and submit the filled-out 

http://www.pcw.gov.ph/gmms


59 
 

registration form for the online submission of the FY 2020 GPB. -

xxx- 

 

2.4  For SUC GPB submission, review and endorsement, CHED may 

also assign GFPS member/s as GMMS reviewer/s and endorser/s of 

SUCs to PCW. The GMMS reviewers have access to review and 

input their comments to the GPBs of SUCs. They will receive a 

system-generated email notice every time an SUC submits its GPB. 

The GMMS endorsers, on the other hand, are the account users who 

are authorized to transmit reviewed GPBs of SUCs to PCW. 

 

Section 4 of said Circular provides the following schedule of GPB Preparation, 

Submission, and Review: 

 

August to September* 2019 Agencies prepare and submit their FY 2020 GPB to 

PCW. 

SUCs prepare and submit their FY 2020 GPBs to 

CHED, for review. 

September 9, 2019 Deadline of SUCs for the encoding and submission of 

FY 2020 GPBs through the GMMS, for review of 

CHED. 

September 16, 2019 Deadline of encoding and submission to PCW of FY 

2020 GPBs of the following through GMMS: 

a. Executive departments 
b. Attached agencies 
c. Attached bureaus 
d. Constitutional bodies 
e. Legislative and judicial bodies 
f. Office of the President 
g. Office of the Vice-President 
h. Other Executive Offices (OEOs) 

September 30, 2019 Deadline of encoding and submission to PCW of FY 

2020 GPBs of GOCCs through the GMMS. 

October 14, 2019 Deadline for CHED to submit to PCW the reviewed FY 

2020 GPBs of SUCs through the GMMS. 

October 31, 2019 Deadline of encoding and submission to PCW of FY 

2020 GPBs of pilot agencies through the GMMS Ver. 3 

August – November 2019 PCW reviews submitted GPBs. 

Agencies shall resubmit their GPBs, if there are 

revisions to be made. 



60 
 

PCW endorses acceptable GPBs. 

 

This is a reiteration of our previous year’s audit observation. Based on the schedule 

above, the agency belatedly prepared its FY 2020 GAD Plan and Budget as this was 

prepared on May 25, 2020 and was subsequently submitted to the Auditor’s Office only 

on February 10, 2021. Likewise, the copy of the GAD Accomplishment Report (AR) was 

submitted also on the same date which was already beyond the deadline. The agency again 

failed to get the endorsement from PCW of its GPB as the GAD AR was not PCW-

reviewed as there was no indication of any authentication with GMMS barcode contrary 

to the prescribed regulations.  

 

The College Accountant admitted their lapses in the submission and that they really 

were not able to follow the schedule provided in the guidelines but assured the Audit Team 

that starting 2021 with the new GAD Focal Person designated last April 2020, they shall 

improve on preventing such deficiency to happen again. He updated the Audit Team that 

the FY 2021 GPB was already under review by the PCW. 

 

It must be noted that the failure of the University to prepare and submit the PCW 

indorsed/approved GPB has resulted in uncertainty as to the determination of the 

Programs/Projects/Activities related to the promotion of equality and women 

empowerment. 

 

Recommendation/s: 

 

We recommended that Management strictly comply with PCW-NEDA-DBM 

Joint Circular No. 2012-01, COA Circular 2014-001 and always keep updated of 

yearly PCW-issued circulars and guidelines pertaining to GAD. 

 

Management’s Comments: 

 

The College humbly asks for understanding and consideration for these lapses with 

regards to the submission of the College’s GAD Plan and Budget. With our new GAD focal 

person, we are still internalizing the processes relevant to the submission of the GAD Plan 

and Budget. We are also adapting to the Gender Mainstreaming Monitoring System 

(GMMS) of the PCW. The College already submitted its GAD Plan and Budget for the FY 

2021 to the PCW through the GMMS last October 2020 and still under review by the PCW. 

As for the GAD Accomplishment Report for FY 2020, the College is on the process of 

uploading the accomplishment report in the GMMS. As per inquiry with the PCW, the 

deadline for the submission of GAD Accomplishment Report is on February 26, 2021. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

 Management’s action is well taken.

Services of Job Order Workers as collecting Officer 

 

5. Job Order workers were hired to collect government funds like tuition fees and others 
fees of the College in behalf of the Accountable Officers, thus negating Sections 101 

and 105 of PD 1445, the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines, and thereby 

posing risks that the government funds might be exposed to theft, misuse and or 

misappropriation. 

 

 Section 101 and 105 of PD 1445, the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines 

provides that: 

 

Section 101 –  

 

(1) Every officer of any government agency whose duties permit or require 

the possession or custody of government funds or property shall be 

accountable therefore and for the safekeeping thereof in conformity with 

law.  

 

(2) Every accountable officer shall be properly bonded in accordance with 

law. 

 

Section 105 – Every officer accountable for government funds shall be 

liable for all losses resulting from the unlawful deposit, use or application 

thereof and for all losses attributable to negligence in the custodianship of 

the funds. 

 

Compostela Valley State College has three branches namely Montevista Branch, 

New Bataan Branch and Maragusan Branch, all of Davao de Oro to widely serve the 

constituents in nearby places.  Eventually, because of the far distance from the main 

campus in Compostela Valley, all Branch Directors were designated as Accountable 

Officers on top of their official functions. 

 

During the team’s visit in Compostela Valley State College, it was disclosed that 

the Accountable Officers who were assigned in the three branches used the services of the 

job order workers in collecting tuition fees and other fees belonging to the College in their 

behalf contrary to the above stated provisions of PD 1445.  Records showed that the 

accountable forms/Official Receipts to be used for collections and cash advances were 

requisitioned for use by the Accountable Officers/Branch Directors for the three branches, 

however, due to their official functions, apparently, they can no longer act as disbursing 

and/or collecting officers in their designated branches, otherwise collections during the 

period will be not collected on time.  

 

The amount of collections daily and the maximum amount of collections in the 

hands/custody of the person in possession by the three branches reached to thousands as 

illustrated below:

Maragusan 60.00 23,070.00 57,798.00 

 

The figures above explained the huge amount of collections daily and that the 

collections had accumulated in the hands or in the custody of a job order worker up to 

P57,798.00 in Maragusan Branch alone for 15 days.  Collections were not deposited right 

away because of the far distance from the branch to the government depository bank and 

there is always a possibility that the funds might be exposed to theft, misuse and or 

misappropriation especially if entrusted to non-government employees. 

 

Accordingly, the three Branch Directors have taken the risk by assuming the whole 

responsibility, being the accountable officers of the Agency aside from the fact that they 

are officially bonded by the government. For this reason, close monitoring was made with 

trust and confidence on their job order workers. Nonetheless, the actual possession and or 

custody of the government funds and the safekeeping thereof were not done by the 

Accountable Officers themselves because job order workers did it for them.  It must be 

noted that the job order workers’ employment status has no employer-employee 

relationship and/or they are not considered as government employees and even not 

qualified to apply for fidelity bond from the Bureau of Treasury. 

 

The Accountant commented that even if the practice is contrary to existing rules 

and regulations, the management opted with this kind of arrangement while waiting for the 

approval on their request from the Department of Budget and Management for additional 

regular positions to be assigned as regular Accountable Officers in the mentioned branches.  

As at December 31, 2021, though all collections have been deposited intact, the 

practice of using the services of the job order workers in collecting tuition fees and other 

fees imposed by the College negates Sections 101 and 105 of PD 1445, the Government 

Auditing Code of the Philippines, thereby posing risks that the government funds might be 

lost through theft, misuse and or misappropriation. 

 

Recommendation/s: 

 

We recommended that Management: 

 

a. Follow up the existing request for additional regular positions to Department 
of Budget and Management to avoid the possible incident of misappropriation 

of government funds; 

  

b. Advise the Accountable Officers/Branch Directors to be vigilant while there is 
no regular employees yet to assume the huge responsibility in case of any 

untoward incident, otherwise they are officially liable in case of cash shortage 

and/or deficiency of deposits. 



63 
 

 

c. Require the job order workers to turn over all collections daily to the Branch 
Director for safe-keeping and/or deposit the same daily to the authorized 

government depository bank. 

 

Management’s Comments: 

 

The College is now fortunate to have additional plantilla positions approved by the 

Department of Budget and Management. Among the approved positions will be designated 

as campus collecting officers and will be properly bonded. 

 

The Branch Directors are well aware of their accountability as collecting officers 

and their liability in case of untoward incident. They judiciously perform their duties as 

collecting officers and are vigilant in depositing 100% of their collections. It is worthy to 

note that during the cash examination conducted, all collections were deposited and as at 

December 31, 2020, the account Cash – Collecting Officers has zero balance, evidence that 

all collections were deposited at the end of CY 2020. 

 

Moreover, the distance of every campuses, specifically the Maragusan Branch, and 

availability of service vehicle poses difficulty on the part of the Branch Directors and the 

job order workers to deposit the collections daily. However, the job orders are required that 

all collections are turned over daily to the Branch Directors for safe-keeping and a safety 

vault is installed to the different campuses to safe keep all collections. The practice of 

College is to deposit the collections twice a week or as soon as the collection reaches the 

amount of P5,000.00. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

 Management’s action is well taken. 

  

 

Maintenance of Cashbooks/or Equivalent Records 

 

6. The Disbursing Officers of the College did not maintain their Cashbooks or the 
equivalent records to monitor the movements of their accountabilities contrary to 

Section 6 of COA Circular No. 97-002, thus hindering the timely reconciliation and 

determination of their accountabilities at any given time.  

 

Section 6 of COA Circular No. 97-002 HANDLING, CUSTODY AND 

DISPOSITION OF THE CASHBOOK  

 

6.1  A newly-appointed or designated AO shall start with a new 

cashbook. Before discharging his duties, the new AO shall be 

briefed by the Accountant and the Auditor on the proper recording 

of the transactions and other matters related to his work.  

 



64 
 

6.2  The AO shall maintain separate cashbooks for salaries, wages, 

allowances, etc. and for petty operating expenses. The AO shall 

record the transactions in the prescribed cashbook daily. He may 

record each invoice/ receipt/voucher individually or the total 

disbursements for the day depending on the volume of the 

transactions.  

 

6.3  The AO shall reconcile the book balance with the cash on hand 

daily. He shall foot and close the books at the end of each month. 

The AO and the Accountant shall reconcile their books of accounts 

at least quarterly.  

 

6.4  The cashbooks shall be kept at the Office of the AO and then placed 

inside the safe or cabinet when not in use. It may be taken from his 

custody only by the Auditor or an official duly authorized by the 

Agency Head, who shall issue the necessary receipt. 

  

Despite the threat brought about by the present Pandemic, the audit team conducted 

the examination of cash and accounts on all Accountable Officers (AOs) of the Compostela 

Valley State College on August 19, 2020.  During the examination of cash and accounts, it 

was disclosed that all Special Disbursing Officers did not maintain their cashbooks and or 

Cash Disbursements Records and Report of Cash Disbursements to show to the Audit 

Team that their records are being regularly reconciled with that of the records or subsidiary 

ledgers maintained by the Accountant.  

 

Apparently, the Accountant did not require each Disbursing Officer (DO) to 

maintain a Cashbook because the former has already done close monitoring on the DOs’ 

Cash Advances and Liquidations. Accordingly, the Accountant told the Audit Team that 

whenever the Disbursing Officer brought the liquidation reports to his Office, the latter 

would only require them to prepare Report of Disbursements and Cash Disbursement 

Records in support of the liquidation reports.   The Audit Team may find the action/efforts 

of the Accountant as commendable as he closely monitored the DOs Cash Advances, 

however it must be noted that the regulations as mentioned above require each Accountable 

Officer to maintain a Cashbook and have it regularly reconciled with that of the records of 

the College Accountant.   

 

As of this writing, each DO has already promised to maintain the required 

Cashbook and asked to be briefed by their College Accountant. 

  

To reiterate, the absence of each DO’s Cashbook has resulted in the difficulty and 

timely reconciliation of both records by the Accountable Officers and that of the College 

Accountant, at any given period. 

 

Recommendation/s: 

 

We recommended that Management:  



65 
 

 

a. Require all designated Accountable Officers/Disbursing Officers to maintain 
the Cashbooks and or Cash Disbursement Record (CDRec) to monitor the 

cash advances/payroll, current operating expenses, and special/time-bonded 

undertakings and prepare the Report of Cash Disbursements (RCDisb) to 

report fund’s utilization. 

  

b. Advise the AOs to regularly reconcile with the records maintained by the 
College Accountant. 

 

c. Require also the designated Disbursing Officers/Accountable Officers to 
certify the Cashbook/Cash Disbursement Record at the end of each month or 

when required to do so by the proper competent authority and certify also the 

Report of Cash Disbursements on the last sheet of the report after the totals 

or when required to do so by the proper competent authority. 

 

Management’s Comments: 

 

The College, through the Accounting Section, conducted a regular monitoring of 

the cash advances of all disbursing officers. Upon liquidation, the Accounting Section 

requires the attachment of the Cash Disbursement Record in the liquidation report. 

Unfortunately, the disbursing officers were not informed to keep a file copy of the Cash 

Disbursement Record as reference for reconciliation during cash audit. Nonetheless, the 

College ensures that all cash advances are accounted for and liquidated within the 

reglementary period. All disbursement officers are already advised to keep a file copy of 

the Cash Disbursement Record for efficient reconciliation of cash accountabilities. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

 Management’s action is well taken. 

 

 

Unsettled Notice of Disallowance 

 

7. The non-enforcement by the Agency on the COA issued Notice of Disallowance (ND) 
which became final and executory, contravened the pertinent provisions of COA 

Circular No. 2009-006 and PD 1445, hence resulting in the non-settlement of accounts 

in the total amount of P15,000.00. 

 

Section 7.1.1(b) and (c) of COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009, 

provides that the Head of the Agency, who is primarily responsible for all government 

funds and property pertaining to his agency, shall ensure that: 

 

(b) The settlement of disallowances and charges is made within the 

prescribed period.  

 



66 
 

(c) The requirements of transactions suspended in audit are complied 

with. 

  

Presidential Decree No. 1445, quoted the following provisions, to wit: 

  

Section 106. Liability for acts done by direction of superior officer. No 

accountable officer shall be relieved from liability by reason of his having 

acted under the direction of a superior officer in paying out, applying, or 

disposing of the funds or property with which he is chargeable, unless prior 

to that act, he notified the superior officer in writing of the illegality of the 

payment, application, or disposition. The officer directing any illegal 

payment or disposition of the funds or property shall be primarily liable for 

the loss, while the accountable officer who fails to serve the required notice 

shall be secondarily liable. 

 

This is a reiteration of the previous year’s audit finding because for the past four 

(4) years the Notice of Disallowance (ND) No. 16-008-164-(14) issued to CVSC has not 

been settled by the persons liable as at December 31, 2020 despite three (3) demands made 

by the Management of the College. 

 

The Accountant informed the Audit Team that all persons liable were no longer 

connected in the College since July 2015.  However, the Management still issued demand 

letters to the concerned persons liable. The 3rd demand letters were served and received by 

them last July 2020 but to no avail, there was no payment/settlement yet received by the 

college. 

 

With the above condition, the Audit Team commended the management for the 

efforts done by exhausting all means to reach out the persons liable, however, Section 106 

of PD 1445 provides that the officer directing any illegal payment or disposition of the 

funds or property shall be primarily liable for the loss. Therefore, it is undeniable that the 

responsibility and the liability thereof still lies directly with the Head of the Agency.  

 

Recommendation/s: 

 

The Audit Team hereby recommended that Management religiously 

assist/facilitate the persons liable in the processing of payments so that the long, 

overdue accounts will be settled the soonest possible time.   

 

Management’s Comments: 

 

The management committed to enforce and assist the persons liable so that this 

recommendation will be fully implemented the soonest possible time. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

 Management’s action is well taken.

In CY 2020, the College withheld taxes from the salaries of personnel as well as 

from the suppliers/creditors and professionals, and subsequently remitted them to the BIR 

on time.  

 

 

Unliquidated Cash Advances
