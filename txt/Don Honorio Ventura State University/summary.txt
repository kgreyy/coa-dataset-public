E)	Summary of Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations



Summarized below are the significant audit observations with their recommendations, the details of which are presented in Part II of this report. Management views and comments including those offered during the exit conference were incorporated in the report, where appropriate:



1)		Four parcels of land donated to DHVSU Satellite Campus situated at Sta. Catalina, Lubao, Pampanga were not recognized in the books of accounts of the University due to absence of cost/appraised values in the deed of donation contrary to the provisions of Chapter 3 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume III and Section 5, Chapter 10, Volume I of the same Manual, thus, understating the balance of the Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) accounts as at year-end. (Observation No. 3)

	

	We recommended and the University President agreed to instruct the (a) Property Custodian to exert effort in obtaining the cost of the four donated lots from the donor’s records. In case, there are no available information, procure the services of an independent appraiser to determine the appraised values thereof; and (b) the Accountant, thru the Director, Finance Management Services, to record the said lots in the books of the University based on the appraised values.

	

	2. 	The accuracy, existence and completeness of the Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) accounts with reported carrying amount of ₱1,555,032,968.10 as of December 31, 2020 were uncertain for failure of Management to a) conduct  complete physical inventory-taking of the PPE; b) maintain complete and properly accomplished Property, Plant and Equipment Ledger Cards (PPELCs) and Property Cards (PCs) in the prescribed form; c) maintain complete, updated, and properly accomplished PAR; and d) prepare and submit Inventory and Inspection Report for Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) to the Accounting Section for proper reclassification from the PPE accounts to Impairment Loss-PPE account, inconsistent with the pertinent rules and regulations of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I. (Observation No. 4)

	

	We recommended and the President agreed to undertake the following courses of action:



a)  cause the creation of an Inventory Committee under the supervision of the Property/Supply Officer who will be fully responsible for conducting a complete inventory-taking, maintenance and reconciliation of pertinent records as well as the submission of the Report on Physical Count of PPE (RPCPPE) to the Office of the Auditor; 

		

b) 	direct the Property/Supply Officer to (i) exhaust all possible means to complete the Property Card (PCs) in order to facilitate the regular reconciliation of the PPE accounts with accounting PPE Ledger Cards (PPELCs); (ii)   maintain complete and properly accomplished PAR instead of ARE to determine responsibility and accountability. The PAR shall be renewed every three years or every time there is a change in accountability; (iii) coordinate with all campuses in the preparation of the Inspection Report for Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) (Appendix 74) to document the inspection and appraisal of damaged/obsolete/worthless property by management in compliance with Section 40(d), Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I; and (iv) submit to the Accounting Section the IIRUP and other pertinent documents to facilitate disposal of unserviceable items and serve as basis for their proper reclassification from the PPE accounts to the Impairment Loss-PPE account; and

	

	c)   direct the University Accountant to maintain the PPELC for each category of PPE to record promptly the acquisition, description, custody, estimated useful life, depreciation loss, disposal and other information about the assets.

	

	3.	Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) with a total carrying value of ₱226,161,948.24 were not insured with the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS), thus, exposing the items to inherent insurable risks, inconsistent with Republic Act (R.A.) No. 656 and COA Circular No. 2018-002 dated May 31, 2018. (Observation No. 5)

	

We recommended and the University President agreed to (a) instruct the Chairman of the Inventory Committee to take charge of the monitoring, review and evaluation of all DHVSU’s existing insurable assets to ensure their coverage with the GSIS insurance; (b) require the Director of the OPPF to prepare and submit on time to the GSIS updated list of buildings and other insurable structures together with all mandatory requirements; and (c) instruct the University Accountant to provide the Property Officer with a list of all newly constructed buildings and all other insurable properties to facilitate regular updating of insurance coverage.  

	

	4.	The University paid honoraria totaling to ₱8,863,050.24 for Extra Teaching Load (ETL) to its faculty members in the Undergraduate Program without complete documentation contrary to Section 5.7.2 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012; thus, the propriety and reasonableness thereof could not be established. (Observation No. 8)

	

	We recommended and the University President agreed through the Vice President for Academic Affairs (VPAA) to require all those concerned to submit the required supporting documents for payment of extra teaching loads in compliance with Section 5.7.2 of COA Circular No. 2012-001.

	

	5.	The University Passing Rates (UPRs) obtained by the Don Honorio Ventura State University (DHVSU) on eight out of nine licensure examinations given during the years 2016 to 2020 were mostly below the National Passing Rates (NPRs), thus, casting doubt on the capability of the University to produce professionals from among its graduates, especially in the fields of Engineering, Architecture, Education, Psychometrician and Social Work. On the other hand, based on the latest monitoring done by the different offices of the Dean, out of 3,618 graduates in CY 2018, about 2,610 were employed, 204 were unemployed while the status of the remaining 804 were untracked in view of unreliable tool in the gathering and consolidation of data. Nonetheless, the number of unemployed which constitutes 5.64% of the graduates in the same batch still created a negative impact on the realization of its mandate to produce competitive and empowered individuals. (Observation No. 10)

	

	We recommended and the University President agreed to require the Vice President for Student Affairs (VPAA) to (a) take a study on the causes identified for the low performance in licensure examinations, especially for degrees with in-demand jobs such as Engineering, Architecture, Education, Psychometrician and Social Worker; (b) adopt applicable interventions to raise the UPR and make the University at par with other reputable learning institutions locally and in other countries to level up with the CHED standard for SUCs; (c) assign one specific office that will monitor and consolidate the report on the employability of the graduates which can be used effectively by the offices concerned for planning purposes and development of enhanced strategies; and (d) encourage all program deans to conduct in-depth studies on the employability of their respective graduates and submit the same to the Office in charge of consolidation. The study will provide valuable inputs to the Admissions, Guidance, Testing and Career Service Office on the proper matching of skills/competence with job opportunities at hand. Accordingly, the percentage of employment of graduates will increase.



		The other audit observations together with the recommended courses of actions are discussed in detail in Part II of the report. These, along with the prior year’s audit observations not yet or partially acted upon and included in Part III of the report, had been discussed with the officials and staff of the University.





F)	Summary of Audit Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges

	

	There were no unsettled notice of suspensions, disallowances and charges as of the end of CY 2020.

	

	

G)		Status of Implementation of Prior Year’s Unimplemented Audit Recommendations

	

Of the 23 audit recommendations in prior year’s audit report, 17 were fully implemented, five were partially implemented and one was not implemented.
