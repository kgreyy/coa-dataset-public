EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 

A. Introduction 
 

The National Printing Office (NPO) was created by virtue of Section 6 of 

Executive Order (EO) No. 285 on July 25, 1987 out of the merger of the 

Government Printing Office and the relevant printing units of the Philippine 

Information Agency (PIA), and is mandated to provide printing services to 

government agencies and instrumentalities.  Under EO No. 285, NPO has exclusive 

printing jurisdiction over all standard and accountable forms of national, provincial, 

city and municipal government, including government corporations; official ballots; 

and public documents, such as the Official Gazette, General Appropriations Act, 

Philippine reports and development information materials for the PIA. 

 

However, on October 25, 2004, Section 6 of EO No. 285 was amended by EO 

No. 378, where, NPO shall continue to provide printing services to government 

agencies and instrumentalities but shall no longer enjoy exclusive jurisdiction over 

the printing services requirements of the government over standard and accountable 

forms.   NPO shall have to compete with the private sector, except in the printing of 

election paraphernalia, which could be shared with Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas 

(BSP), upon the discretion of the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) consistent 

with the provisions of the Election Code of 1987.   

 

The Office may also accept other government printing jobs, including 

government publications, but not in an exclusive basis.  

 

Pursuant to Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB) Resolution No. 

05-2010 issued on October 29, 2010, prescribing the Implementing Guidelines on 

the Procurement of Printing Services, procuring entities have the option to engage 

the services of private printers for their printing and publication expenditures, 

subject to public bidding in accordance with Republic Act (RA) No. 9184 and 

pertinent accounting and auditing rules and regulations.  However, the printing of 

accountable forms and sensitive high quality/volume printing requirements shall 

only be undertaken by recognized government printers, namely: BSP, NPO and 

APO Production Unit, Inc.  

  

The NPO is headed by Director Francisco V. Vales, Jr., and assisted by nine 

Divisions Chiefs.

E. Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements 

The Auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of 

the financial statements of NPO as at December 31, 2020, in view of the material 

accounting errors and deficiencies as enumerated below: 

 

1. The Cash in Bank (CIB)-Local Currency, Current Account was 
understated by P43,944,590.30 due to unadjusted book reconciling items.  

 

2. The existence of dormant Accounts Receivable totaling P61,024,020.65; 
and inclusion of negative balances amounting to P7,601,887.53;  

 

3. Various Property, Plant and Equipment and Computer Software accounts 
were understated by P7,427,372.26 as a result of erroneous 

derecognition/adjustment of the cost of various assets; and  

 

4. The existence of negative balances amounting to P5,807,426.50 of 
Customers’ Deposits Payable account.  

 

 

F. Summary of Significant Observations and Recommendations 
        

The following are the other significant audit observations and the 

corresponding recommendations: 

 

1. Submission of Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS) to the Audit Team was 
delayed by 15 to 65 days, contrary to Section 7, Chapter 21, Volume I of GAM 

for NGAs; thus, reconciling items were not promptly detected for proper 

action. (Paragraph no. 2) 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Acting Chief, 

Financial Management Division (FMD):  

 

a. prepare the BRS based on the bank statements downloaded from the 
agency’s online access facility with the LBP; and 

b. submit the BRS to the Audit Team within the prescribed period 
 

2. The validity of the Accounts Receivable balance of P190,630,542.85 as at 
December 31, 2020 was doubtful because of the discrepancy in the balances 

between the NPO’s books and the client agencies’ records. (Paragraph no. 3) 

 

We recommended that Management require the: 

a. Chairman, Committee on Accounts Receivable to: 
i.   develop a time-bound plan/strategy for the reconciliation of the 

AR balances with counterparties’ records and 



v 

 

analysis/determination of the collectability of the ARs, detailing 

the activities to be undertaken, personnel to be assigned for the 

activity, duration and corresponding deliverables; 

ii.   oversee the proper implementation of the plan/strategy and 
monitor the progress of the activities; and  

iii.   demand the immediate payment/settlement by client agencies of 
the ARs that were found to be valid after the reconciliation 

process; and 

 

b. Acting Chief, FMD to: 
 

i.   provide client agencies with copy of bills or other pertinent 
documents for their ready reference and to facilitate the 

reconciliation process; and 

ii.   deduct the fines and penalties for late deliveries from the claims 
or any amount due to erring private printers; and 

 

3.    No Merchandise Inventory account was recorded upon delivery to NPO of 
specialized/accountable forms produced by private printers thru a Joint Venture 

Agreement (JVA), and the delivery thereof by NPO to client agencies, thus, any 

undelivered items in the custody of NPO at year-end were not recognized in the 

books, thereby affecting the faithful representation of the financial statements. 

(Paragraph no. 4) 

 

We recommended that Management require: 

 

a.  The Acting Chief, FMD to record the following transactions under the 

JVFA through the following journal entries: 

 

Upon delivery by private printer to NPO 

 

Merchandise Inventory xxx  

    Accounts Payable   xxx 

Note: The amount should be the production cost and share of private 

printer from the JV net profit 

 

Upon delivery by NPO to client agency 

 

With advance payment 

Customer’s Deposit Payable xxx  

     Merchandise Inventory  xxx 

     Other Business Income   

Purchase on account 

Accounts Receivable  xxx  

      Merchandise Inventory  xxx 



vi 

 

 

Payment to private printer 

 

Accounts Payable xxx  

     CIB - LCCCA  xxx 

 

c. The office responsible for the JV operations to furnish immediately the 
FMD with copy of pertinent documents upon delivery of accountable 

forms to NPO as well as the delivery thereof to client agencies so that the 

transactions could be promptly and properly recorded in the books.  

 

4. The validity of the reported year-end balance of Customers’ Deposits Payable 
account totaling P116,510,780.91 could not be relied upon due to presence of 

customers’ deposits amounting to P106,578,246.68 aged over two to 10 years, 

for which the corresponding printed materials could have already been 

delivered to NPO’s clients. (Paragraph no. 6) 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the: 

 

a.  Accounting Section to draw a Journal Entry Voucher to close/revert the 
CDP corresponding to the accomplished printing services in order to do 

away with maintaining accounts no longer valid; and 

 

b. SMD to immediately provide the Accounting Section the needed 
information to support the reversion/closing of the CDP accounts for 

which the corresponding printing requirements have already been served 

by NPO. 

 

5. Only printing project amounting to P2.5 million was undertaken by NPO as of 
December 31, 2020 out of the P12.6 million fund received from PCOO in 

November 2019 due to non-provision by the latter of the specifications of 

materials needed for the PhilSys Communications Campaign, thus, leaving the 

amount of P10.1 million idle for over a year. (Paragraph no. 7) 

 

We recommended that Management: 

 

a. follow up the specifications of the Information Education Communication 
(IEC) materials and constantly coordinate with PCOO so that the printing 

project could now be fully undertaken; 

 

b. request for amendment of the validity of MOA if the printing project will 
still be pursued or refund the unutilized balance of P10.1 million to PCOO 

so that NPO would be relieved from accountability over said fund. 

 



vii 

 

6. Fourteen private printers were engaged by NPO to undertake the printing 
requirements of its client agencies totaling P906,504,749.25, contrary to 

Section 4.6 of the GPPB Resolution No. 05-2010 and Section 22 of the GP of 

the GAA, FY 2020. (Paragraph no. 8) 

 

We recommended that Management:  

 

a. Strictly adhere to the pertinent provisions of GPPB Resolution No. 05-
2010 and the GAA by directly undertaking the printing services contracts 

entered into by NPO with client agencies, and refrain from 

engaging/assigning private printers to perform any portion thereof;  

 

b. Issue a certification, in case the NPO cannot accommodate or unable to 
meet the printing requirements of its client agencies pursuant to the 

pertinent provision of the GAA; and 

 

c. Instruct the: 
 

i.   Head, JV-Selection Committee to submit to the Audit Team copy of 

pertinent contracts/agreement and other documents to support the 

payments to the above-enumerated private printers, and for 

inspection/review as required by Section 39 (1) of PD No. 1445 on the 

submission of papers relative to government obligations; and 

 

ii.  Acting Chief, Financial Management Division (FMD) to ensure the 

completeness of the supporting documents of all disbursements 

relative to the NPO’s printing activities.  

 

The above findings and recommendations were discussed with Management 

officials concerned in the exit conference held on June 17, 2021. Management 

views and reactions were considered in the report, where appropriate.  The details 

of the above observations were discussed in Part II of this report.  

 

 

G. Implementation of Prior Years’ Audit Recommendations  
 

Of the 92 audit recommendations embodied in the CYs 2017, 2018 and 2019 

Annual Audit Reports (AARs), 67 were implemented and 25 were not 

implemented. Details are presented in the Part III of this report.
