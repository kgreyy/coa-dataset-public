OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

                                                                                                                                    

A. Financial Audit  
 

Understated cash in bank –P43,944,590.30  
 

1. The Cash in Bank (CIB)-Local Currency, Current Account (LCCA) balance 
of P407,834,953.88 was understated (net) by P43,944,590.30  due to unadjusted 

book reconciling items, contrary to the relevant provision of the Government 

Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), 

Volume I. 

 

Section 6, Chapter 21, Volume I of GAM, provides that “The Chief 

Accountant/Designated Staff shall prepare a JEV to recognize all reconciling items 

that require adjustment and correction in the books of accounts.” 

 

The table below shows the balances of the following CIB-LCCA maintained 

by NPO with the Landbank of the Philippines (LBP) as at December 31, 2020:  

 

LBP Bank Account No. Amount (P) 

1872-1004-46 407,642,934.34 

1872-1024-06 124,480.54 

1872-1026-94  67,539.00  

Total 407,834,953.88 

 

However, review of the Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS) disclosed that 

Management was unable to recognize the following reconciling items needing 

adjustments in the books which resulted in the net understatement of the reported 

year-end balance of CIB-LCCA by P43,944,590.30, details shown below:

On the other hand, there were deposits amounting to P56,750.00 recorded in 

the books in CYs 2009-2010 that were still not recognized by the bank. 

 

Management informed that the unrecorded deposits pertained to advance 

payments or settlement of accounts of NPO client agencies which were made either 

through direct deposit or fund transfer to NPO bank accounts. However, the details 

could not be identified due to lack of documents.  Management added that they 

already requested the bank for copy of documents such as deposit slips, credit/debit 

memos and other pertinent documents to support the recording of the reconciling 

items. 

 

The responsibility of the Accountant does not end in the preparation of the 

BRS and its submission to the Audit Team. Necessary adjustments should be 

immediately effected in the books of accounts and errors committed by the bank 

should be promptly communicated to the officials thereof for 

reconciliation/adjustment of the bank’s records in order to reflect the correct cash in 

bank balance. 

 

We recommended that Management instruct the Acting Chief, FMD to: 
 

a.   closely monitor the reconciling items and ensure that errors and 
other deficiencies noted in the BRS are immediately acted upon;  

 

b.   prepare adjusting entry/ies for reconciling items which details were 
already identified;  

 

c.   continuously follow up the debit/credit memos and other necessary 
documents to support the recording of said reconciling items in the 

books;  

 

d.   inform and provide the bank with pertinent documents for deposits 
amounting to P56,750.00 for proper adjustment of their records, and 

henceforth, immediately communicate to them the bank 

errors/reconciling items to correct their records.    

 

 



51 

 

Delayed submission of BRS 

 

2. Submission of BRS to the Audit Team was delayed by 15 to 65 days, contrary 
to Section 7, Chapter 21, Volume I of GAM for NGAs; thus, reconciling items 

were not promptly detected for proper action.  

 

Section 7, Chapter 21, Volume I of the GAM, provides that:  

 

The Chief Accountant shall submit the BRS within twenty days 

after receipt of the monthly BS to the following:  

  

Original – COA Auditor (xxx)  

Copy 2 – Head of Agency/Entity  

Copy 3 – Accounting Division/Unit file  

Copy 4 – Bank, if necessary 

 

Our records showed that Management incurred delays in the submission of 

BRS to the Audit Team, ranging from 15 to 65 days, as shown below:

Management commented that the printed copies of the bank statements were 

not immediately provided by the banks that preparation of BRS was delayed, and as 

a consequence, the late submission of the BRS to the Auditor.  As can be gleaned 

from the above table, the bank statements were received by Management two to six 

months after the covered month.  

 

With the delayed preparation of BRS, reconciling items/errors were not 

immediatedly detected and verified that proper adjustments were not promptly 



52 

 

effected in the books. Also, bank errors could not be immediately 

communicated/coordinated with the bank to correct their records.  Further,  late 

submission of BRS to the Audit Team prevented  the timely verification of the cash 

in bank accounts.  

 

It was learned that, to address the issue, the FMD requested the Cashier 

Section to submit a snapshot of weekly bank statements through the NPO’s online 

access facility with the LBP to be able to prepare weekly bank reconciliation.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Acting Chief, 

FMD:  

 

a. prepare the BRS based on the bank statements downloaded from the 
agency’s online access facility with the LBP; and 

 

b.   submit the BRS to the Audit Team within the prescribed period. 
 

 

Doubtful Accounts Receivable balance 

 

3. The validity of the Accounts Receivable balance of P190,630,542.85 as at 
December 31, 2020 was doubtful because of (a) existence of dormant 

receivables totaling P61,024,020.65; (b) discrepancy in the balances between 

the NPO’s books and the client agencies’ records; and (c) inclusion of negative 

balances amounting to P7,601,887.53; thus, affecting the faithful 

representation of the financial statements. 

 

The responsibility for the fair presentation and reliability of financial 

statements rests with the Management of the reporting entity, particularly the head 

of finance/accounting office and the head of entity or his authorized representative 

(Section 4, Chapter 19, GAM, Volume I).  Reliability means that reliable 

information is free from material error and bias and can be depended on by users to 

represent faithfully that which it purports to represent or could reasonably be 

expected to represent. (Section 6(e), Chapter 19, GAM, Volume I) 

 

a.     Long outstanding/Dormant Accounts Receivable – P61,024,020.65 

 

As defined in COA Circular No. 2016-005, dormant receivable accounts are 

accounts which balances remained inactive or non-moving in the books of accounts 

for ten (10) years or more and where settlement/collectability could no longer be 

ascertained.   

 

The same Circular also provides the guidelines and procedures on the write-

off of dormant receivable accounts. 

 



53 

 

Aging of the Accounts Receivable (ARs) with a balance of P190,630,542.85 

as at December 31, 2020, is presented below:

Percentage 0 1 49 2 17 32 

 

The dormant receivables were already raised in the CY 2018 Annual Audit 

Report (AAR) on NPO with recommendations for the Accounting Section to really 

exert effort, such as ensuring the existence and collectability, issuing demand 

letters, requesting for write-off, when necessary, and to thresh out issues with 

debtors, especially those whose indebtedness reached P500,000.00 and above.  

However, Management actions and collection efforts seemed to be inadequate with 

the accumulation of long overdue and dormant receivable accounts.  

 

According to a concerned accounting personnel, some of the ARs may not be 

valid as a result of accounting errors such as erroneous entries, misposting, and 

unrecorded transactions.    

 

It was also noted that the AR balance included fines and penalties for the 

delayed/late delivery of printed materials/ forms by private printers to NPO way 

back in CYs 2015 to 2016 which were covered by their previous leasing 

agreements, but were billed only in CY 2020 after reconciliation of the accounts, 

with details below:  

 

Name of Debtor Amount (P) 

Bestforms Inc.  1,441,600.00  

Topbest Printing Corporation  1,391,931.43  

Holy Family Printing Corporation  3,206,734.00  

 

Considering that the above-named private printers have been continuously 

transacting with NPO, the latest is through JV agreement, their corresponding fines 

and penalties should be deducted from their pending/succeeding claims. 

 

The non-collection of ARs depleted the NPO’s operating revolving fund. The 

long outstanding accounts, if collected, could have been used by NPO to purchase 

new printing machines/equipment in order to service the printing requirements of its 

client agencies without the need of engaging private printers, in any manner.     

 

Had there been close and adequate monitoring of the clients’ accounts, and 

efficient collection system in place, the existence and accumulation of long 

outstanding accounts could have been prevented, considering that the debtors are 

mostly government agencies which have the capacity to pay as they have available 

funds, hence, are expected to settle their accounts.  



54 

 

b.   Discrepancy between the recorded receivables and confirmed balances  

 

In CY 2020, Management sent confirmation letters (CLs) to NPO client 

agencies with overdue accounts as of July 30, 2020.  The Audit Team was furnished 

with copy of confirmation replies from 34 client agencies.  

 

Results of confirmation from 14 client agencies involving the amount of 

P5,769,357.50 yielded the following information:

Likewise, the other 20 client agencies responded that they have no 

outstanding payables to NPO but the AR balances subject of the confirmation were 

not stated in the reply form.  Some respondents claimed that they do not  have copy 

of the bills or other document relating to NPO’s receivables from them.  

 

Discrepancies signify the commission of recording errors and/or unrecorded 

transactions by either the debtor or the creditor or both; hence, must be thoroughly 

investigated to eliminate doubts on the financial statement’s reliability. 

 

c. Negative balances – P7,601,887.53 
 

Of the prior year’s negative balance of P26,892.35, only P23,922.07 was 

adjusted during the year. It was observed that the negative balance further increased 

to P7,601,887.53 in CY 2020, of which, P5,945,815.50 comprising 71.81 per cent 

pertained to COMELEC’s account, with details below:

56 

 

The increase in the negative balance reflect that errors were continuously 

being committed in the recording of transactions.  

 
We recommended that Management require the: 

 

a. Chairman, Committee on Accounts Receivable to: 
 

i. develop a time-bound plan/strategy for the reconciliation of the 
AR balances with counterparties’ records and 

analysis/determination of the collectability of the ARs, detailing 

the activities to be undertaken, personnel to be assigned for the 

activity, duration and corresponding deliverables; 

 

ii. oversee the proper implementation of the plan/strategy and 
monitor the progress of the activities; 

 

iii. demand the immediate payment/settlement by client agencies of 
the ARs that were found to be valid after the reconciliation 

process; 

 

iv. henceforth, intensify collection efforts of ARs as they become due 
to prevent occurrence and accumulation of long overdue 

accounts; and  

 

b. Acting Chief, FMD to: 
 

i. verify the cause/s of the negative balances and prepare necessary 
adjusting entries in order to present the correct account balance; 

 

ii. trace back the records/documents relative to the long 
outstanding/dormant accounts to determine their actual status so 

that appropriate adjustments could be effected in the books, thus, 

providing a more reliable financial information; 

  

iii. provide client agencies with copy of bills or other pertinent 
documents for their ready reference and to facilitate the 

reconciliation process;  

 

iv. exercise due diligence in the review of transactions to 
prevent/minimize accounting errors; 

 

v. periodically monitor, review and analyze the receivable accounts, 
at least on a quarterly basis, ensuring that these are promptly 

collected when become due;  
 

vi. deduct the fines and penalties for late deliveries from the claims 
or any amount due to erring private printers; and 



57 

 

vii. request authority to write off the dormant receivables in 
accordance with COA Circular No. 2016-005. 

 

We further recommended that Management consider requiring all client 

agencies to make advance payment for their printing orders.  

 

Management Comment: 

 

The Management commented in its reply letter dated June 01, 2021 that the 

outcome of the effort of AR Committee in tracing the validity of AR that 

aggravated the massive amount reveals the following: 

 

a. The Delivery Receipt (DR) coming from Sales and Marketing Division 
(SMD) were not submitted to Financial Management Division (FMD) in 

each period.  Said documents are required for the AR to be closed; 

b. Some clients are billed despite having an advance payment due to no 
Subsidiary Ledger (SL) or index maintained in FMD; 

c. The Agency Deposit Advise (ADA) only specified the account number 
of payees, the amount and the date thus, unable to distinguish the name 

of agency which is vital in the process of a payment to AR. 

 

The AR Committee with the help of a consultant designed an Order of 

Payment form for which will distinguish cash sales, payment for billing and 

customer’s deposit.  Likewise, the Management will post in the NPO’s website and 

distributed a memo the manner of payment for proper recording in the books of 

account.  Furthermore, the Management is working on the request for write-off as 

they already sent demand letter twice. 

 

 

Unrecognized inventory held for sale  

 

4. No Merchandise Inventory account was recorded upon delivery to NPO of 
specialized/accountable forms produced by private printers thru a Joint 

Venture Agreement (JVA), and the subsequent delivery thereof by NPO to 

client agencies, thus, any undelivered items in the custody of NPO at year-end 

were not recognized in the books, thereby affecting the fairness of presentation 

of the financial statements.  

 

As described in the Revised Chart of Accounts (RCA), Volume III of GAM 

for NGAs, “the account Merchandise Inventory is used to recognize cost of goods 

purchased/acquired/produced which are intended for sale in the ordinary course of 

business. This includes forest products and other merchandise. Credit this account 

for the sale, transfers or write-down of merchandise inventory.” 

 

Under the JV Framework Agreement (JVFA) entered into by the NPO with 

the private printers, NPO shall be responsible for marketing and client 



58 

 

relationships, which included but shall not be limited to collection and custody of 

payments from clients, and delivery of products to clients.  While the private printer 

undertakes to make available all equipment, supplies, and personnel as may be 

necessary for the commencement and accomplishment of  printing tasks received 

by NPO from its by client agencies.  

 

Review of Journal Entry Vouchers (JEV) showed the manner of recording 

transactions related to JV activities, illustrated as follows:

It could be noted that there was no inventory account recorded in the books 

for the delivery to NPO of accountable forms produced by private printers through 

their JV agreement. As a consequence, the subsequent delivery thereof by NPO to 

client agencies was not coursed through the inventory account.  

 

In the first case, no Accounts Payable was set up to recognize the NPO’s 

liability to the private printer upon delivery of accountable forms.  While in the 

second case, the setting up of liability account to private printer and the receivable 

account from client agency was lumped into one journal entry.  

  

Considering that the accountable forms printed under the JVFA were not 

properly accounted as inventory in the books, the undelivered accountable forms to 

client agencies in the custody of NPO as of December 31, 2020 were not reported 

in the financial statements. Management informed that there were indeed 

undelivered accountable forms in the custody of NPO at year-end, however, the 

report has yet to be provided to the Audit Team.   

 

The Acting Chief, FMD explained that the Accounting Division was not 

furnished with the necessary documents upon delivery of accountable forms by the 

private printers to NPO such that recording of deliveries was  not properly 

accounted for as inventory in the books.  He further added that due to lack of 

manpower, the recording of said deliveries in the books was not facilitated.  He, 

however, had already requested that the vacant position of Accountant III be filled-

in in order to address the issue.  

 

We recommended that Management require: 

 



60 

 

a. The Acting Chief, FMD to record the following transactions under the 
JVFA through the following journal entries: 

 

Upon delivery by private printer to NPO 

 

Merchandise Inventory xxx  

    Accounts Payable   xxx 

Note: The amount should be the production cost and share of private 

printer from the JV net profit 

 

Upon delivery by NPO to client agency

     Merchandise Inventory  xxx 

     Other Business Income

b.   The office responsible for the JV operations, to furnish immediately the 

FMD with copy of pertinent documents upon delivery of accountable 

forms to NPO as well as the delivery thereof to client agencies so that 

the transactions could be promptly and properly recorded in the books.  

 

Management Comment: 

 

The Management commented that there are three forms and structure of JV as 

stated in the GAM.  The nature of the JV entered into by the NPO and by its 

partners is a jointly controlled operation in which a venturer uses its own assets in 

the joint venture and because it controls those assets, it continues to recognize them 

in its financial statements.  The venturer also recognizes the liabilities and expenses 

that it incurs, and its share in the income from sales by the joint venture.  Each 

venturer records joint venture transactions in their own books of accounts.  The 

Management further replied that as defined in the GAM Volume III, Merchandise 

Inventory account as a cost of goods purchased/acquired/produced which are 

intended for sale in the ordinary course of business. 

 



61 

 

The Management’s viewpoint is that the transfer of goods to NPO is not 

tantamount to the transfer of ownership.  While it is true that these inventories were 

sold in the ordinary course of business, these inventories were neither purchased, 

acquired not produced by the NPO by itself.  These goods were merely physically 

delivered to NPO in order for them fulfill their responsibility in the joint venture 

and that is to sell, manage and deliver the good to the clients. 

 

Therefore, the goods delivered to NPO by the private printer, in the light of 

the latter’s responsibility under the joint controlled operations, will not be recorded 

in the books of NPO as there is no transfer of exclusive ownership in favor of the 

latter. 

 

Audit Team’s Rejoinder: 

 

It should be emphasized that the issue raised in the audit observation is not 

the ownership but the accounting treatment of printed materials delivered by the 

private printers to NPO, instead.   

 

As provided in the GAM, an asset shall be recognized in the financial 

position when it is probable that the future economic benefits are expected to flow 

to the entity.  Besides, in recognizing a payable/liability account, the receipt of 

goods or services rendered should also be recognized in the books. 

 

In the subject transaction, the future economic benefits involved from the 

delivered printed accountable forms is the cash flow generated from the sale 

thereof. Hence, the Audit maintains that all goods received by NPO acquired 

through JV operations should be recorded as inventory for sale.  

 

 

Understated PPE 

 

5. Various Property, Plant and Equipment and Computer Software accounts 
were understated by P7,427,372.26 as a result of erroneous 

derecognition/adjustment of the cost of various assets thus, affecting the 

faithful representation of the financial statements.  

 

Section 15, Chapter 2, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs, is quoted as follows: 

 

The FSs shall present fairly the financial position, financial 

performance and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation 

requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, 

other events, and conditions in accordance with the definitions 

and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and 

expenses set out in PPSAS. The application of PPSAS, with 

appropriate disclosures, if necessary, would result in fair 

presentation of the FS. 



62 

 

 

Section 2.k, Chapter 10 of Government Accounting Manual (GAM) Volume I, 

defines PPE as tangible assets that are: 

 

a.   Purchased, constructed, developed or otherwise acquired; 
b.  Held for use in the production or supply of goods or services or to 

produce program outputs; 

c.   For rental to others; 
d. For administrative purposes; 
e.  Expected to be used during more than one reporting period; and 
f.  Not intended for resale in the ordinary course of operations. 

 

Furthermore, stated under Section 39 of the same Chapter, GAM, Volume I are 

the following accounting policies on the derecognition of PPE, to wit:  

 

 The carrying amount of an item of PPE shall be derecognized on disposal or 
when no future economic benefits or service potential is expected from its use 

or disposal. 

 

 A JEV shall be prepared by the Accounting Division/Unit to derecognize the 
asset from the books of accounts only after its disposal. 

 

 Lost property and the related accumulated depreciation and impairment loss 
shall be derecognized in the books

Management claimed that that the subject properties were acquired for use in 

the production of official ballots for CY 2019 Election and were considered as part 

of the Cost of Sales, hence, were derecognized/adjusted in the books. 

  

The Audit Team disagreed with the Management contention since it is very 

clear in the above-said accounting policies that the PPE shall only be derecognized 

upon disposal or in case of loss.  The disposal could be through sale, 

transfer/donation or destruction. Nothing in the GAM mentioned that those PPE 



65 

 

used in the production of goods or services shall be derecognized from the books 

after completion of the activity.  

 

The erroneous derecognition of said equipment and software in the books 

understated the reported assets of the agency at year-end as well as the related 

depreciation/amortization expense.  

  

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Acting Chief, 

FMD to restore to the proper asset accounts the cost of PPE and software and 

the related depreciation/amortization that were erroneously derecognized in 

the books in order to fairly present the agency’s financial statements.   

 

 

Unreliable balance of Customers’ Deposit Payable  

 

6. The validity of the reported year-end balance of Customers’ Deposits Payable 
account totaling P116,510,780.91 could not be relied upon due to (a) presence 

of customers’ deposits amounting to P106,578,246.68 aged over two to 10 

years, for which the corresponding printed materials could have already been 

delivered to NPO’s clients; and (b) reduction of the account balance by the 

negative balances amounting to P5,807,426.50; thus, affecting the fair 

presentation of the financial statements.   

 

The Customers’ Deposits Payable (CDP) account of the NPO, which had a 

balance of P116,510,780.91 as at December 31, 2020, refers to the advance 

payments made by its client agencies for their printing requirements.  

 

As contained in the CY 2019 Annual Audit Report (AAR) on the NPO, the 

Audit Team recommended that the Accounting Section review, analyze and adjust 

where necessary, the long-outstanding customers’ deposits including dormant 

accounts.  

 

Examination of the detailed schedule of the CDP’s account revealed the 

presence of customers’ deposits aged more than two to 10 years amounting to 

P106,578,246.68, representing 91.48 percent of the account’s year-end balance.

According to the Acting Chief, FMD, they have already analyzed/reviewed 

the CDP accounts and sent confirmation letters to its clients.  He further added that 

CDP totaling P114,893,695.56 will be reverted as a result of confirmation by client 

agencies that they have no outstanding advance payments or any receivables from 



66 

 

NPO.  However, the FMD is still awaiting the certification from Sales and 

Marketing Division (SMD) of the NPO that there were no pending deliveries or 

undelivered accountable and specialized forms to said client agencies to 

substantiate the reversion.   

 

It may be mentioned that Executive Order (EO) No. 87 dated August 13, 

2019 directs that all accounts payable which remain outstanding for two years or 

more in the books of National Government Agencies (NGAs) be reverted to the 

Accumulated Surplus or Deficit of the General Fund, or the Cumulative Result of 

Operations of the National Government.  

 

As provided in Section 5 of the EO, the Order shall apply to all accounts 

payable of all NGAs except: (i) trust or fiduciary funds, for as long as the purposes 

for their creation have not been accomplished; and (ii) accounts payable 

corresponding to foreign-assisted projects for the duration of the said projects. 

 

Inquiry disclosed that it only took a few months for NPO to undertake the 

printing of accountable and specialized forms including the delivery thereof to 

client agencies. In this case, it could be safely considered that the printing services 

covered by CDP aged over two to 10 years had already been 

accomplished/completed and delivered by NPO to its clients as at year-end that said 

CDP should now be applied/closed.  Further, following the pertinent provision of 

EO No. 87, the CPD corresponding to the accomplished printing services could also 

be reverted.  

 

Moreover, the CDP account balance was reduced by P5,807,426.50 because

The presence of long outstanding CDP and negative balances is a 

manifestation of poor documentation and monitoring of the accounts, and 

commission of accounting errors.   The Audit Team was informed that the last 

posting of CDP transactions in the related subsidiary ledger (SL) was in CY 2019, 

and succeeding transactions were recorded/posted only in a spreadsheet in Excel 

file. 

 

The noted deficiencies rendered the CDP account balance unreliable that 

affected the fairness of presentation of the agency’s financial statements. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require   the: 

 

a. Accounting Section to:  
 

i. draw a Journal Entry Voucher to close/revert the CDP 
corresponding to the accomplished printing services in order to do 

away with maintaining accounts no longer valid;  

 

ii. verify the cause of the negative balances and make appropriate 
adjustments to reflect the correct account balance; and  

 

iii. properly monitor the accounts through updating the SL and 
prompt posting of transactions therein for early detection and 

adjustment of errors/deficiencies; and   

 

b. SMD to immediately provide the Accounting Section the needed 
information to support the reversion/closing of the CDP accounts 

for which the corresponding printing requirements have already 

been served by NPO. 

 

 

 

Idle fund transfer 

 

7. Only printing project amounting to P2.5 million was undertaken by NPO as of 
December 31, 2020 out of the P12.6 million fund received from PCOO in 

November 2019 due to non-provision by the latter of the specifications of 



68 

 

materials needed for the Philippine Identification System (PhilSys) 

Communications Campaign, thus, leaving the amount of P10.1 million idle for 

over a year. 
 

The PCOO and NPO entered into a MOA dated September 27, 2019 for the 

production, printing and supply of Information-Education-Communication (IEC) 

materials for the PhilSys Communications Campaign effective until December 31, 

2020. 

 

Under the MOA, PCOO shall provide NPO a budget amounting to P25.2 

million for the said undertaking.  The first tranche of P12.6 million was received by 

NPO on November 28, 2019.  

 

The MOA further stipulates that PCOO shall take charge in the 

conceptualization, development and production of IEC materials, and shall provide 

NPO the necessary and complete specifications, and shall issue a Notice to Proceed 

(NTP) immediately after approving the final sample of every printing project to be 

undertaken under the MOA. While NPO shall commence the printing only upon 

receipt of NTP issued by PCOO.  

 

A Supplemental Agreement dated February 5, 2021 was made to extend the 

validity of original MOA until May 31, 2021 and to give an additional budget of 

P15 million to NPO for the development and production of the multimedia 

communication requirements from Philsys Campaign.  

 

Per accounting records, only P2,500,000.00 had been utilized by NPO for the 

production of PhilSys campaign materials as of December 31, 2020 out of the first 

tranche of P12.6 million, leaving the amount of P10.1 million idle for over a year. 

Management informed that PCOO has yet to provide the specifications for the 

printing project required under the MOA. 

 

Considering that the extended validity of the MOA already expired on May 

31, 2021, NPO may no longer be able to undertake the printing of materials 

necessary for PhilSys Communications Campaign.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a) follow up the specifications of the IEC materials and constantly 
coordinate with PCOO so that the printing project could now be fully 

undertaken; and 

 

b) request for amendment of the validity of MOA if the printing project 
will still be pursued or refund the unutilized balance of P10.1 million to 

PCOO so that NPO would be relieved from accountability over said 

fund.

B. Compliance Audit 
 

8. Fourteen private printers were engaged by NPO to undertake the printing 
requirements of its client agencies totaling P906,504,749.25, contrary to 

Section 4.6 of the GPPB Resolution No. 05-2010 and Section 22 of the GP of 

the GAA, FY 2020.   Moreover, the covering Disbursement Vouchers were not 

supported by the related agreement or equivalent document to support the 

payments.  

 

GPPB Resolution No. 05-2010 providing the guidelines for the procurement 

of printing services was issued in pursuance to the President’s Veto Message on the 

provision of Section 29 of the General Provisions (GP) of GAA, FY 2010 stating 

that the implementation thereof should be subject to guidelines to be issued by the 

GPPB. The Resolution applies to succeeding GAAs.  

 

In addition, Section 22 of the GP of the GAA, FY 2020 states, among others, 

that: 

 

(a) The RGPs shall undertake the printing requirements themselves 
and shall not sub-contract any portion thereof to other printers; and 

 

(b) An agency may be allowed to engage private printers for the 
printing of accountable forms and sensitive, high quality or high 

volume requirements upon certification by the RGPs that they are 

unable to service the said requirements. Said engagement of 

private printers shall be in accordance with RA No. 9184, its IRR, 

and GPPB Guidelines.  

 

On the other hand, Section 4(6) of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 states 

that “Claims against government funds shall be supported with complete 

Documentation”. While Section 39 (1) of PD No. 1445 provides that “The 

Commission shall have the power, for purposes of inspection, to require the 

submission of the original of any order, deed, contract, or other document under 

which any collection of, or payment from, government funds may be made, 

together with any certificate, receipt, or other evidence in connection therewith. If 

an authenticated copy is needed for record purposes, the copy shall upon demand 

be furnished”. 
 

Our examination of the transaction documents relative to the printing 

activities of the NPO disclosed that various printing services contracted by NPO 

with requisitioning agencies were actually undertaken by private printers.  

 

Based on the Report of Checks Issued (RCI) covering the period from 

January to December 2020, the NPO had paid the total net amount of 

P715,821,198.21 to 14 private printers, as presented in the next page:

As stated in the Disbursement Vouchers (DVs), the payments made were for 

the production cost and the profit share of the private printers. The DVs were 

supported with the following documents: 

 

 Official Receipt (OR) issued by private printer  

 OR issued by NPO to client agency 

 Billing statement/invoice of the private printer  

 Schedule of Joint Venture (JV) Profit Sharing 

 Job Accomplishment Report issued by NPO  

 Delivery Receipt (DR) of NPO to client agency 

 NPO Sales Invoice issued to client agency 

 Purchase Order (PO) issued by client agency to NPO 

 NPO Routing Slip with note from the JV Secretariat  
 

The contract/agreement or equivalent document that would support the 

NPO’s obligations to the private printers was not included in the supporting 

documents. The Audit Team, through a letter dated November 4, 2020, requested 

for its submission to no avail.   

 

The action of NPO to engage the private printers to undertake the 

performance of the printing services indicated the NPO’s inability to service the 

requirements of client agencies.  Instead of assigning private printers to perform 

the printing service, NPO should have issued a certification that it is unable to 

service the requirements, in accordance with RA No. 9184, its IRR, and GPPB 

Guidelines, as provided in Section 22 of the GP of the FY 2020 GAA.   

 



71 

 

We recommended that Management:  

 

a. Strictly adhere to the pertinent provisions of GPPB Resolution No. 05-
2010 and the GAA by directly undertaking the printing services 

contracts entered into by NPO with client agencies, and refrain from 

engaging/assigning private printers to perform any portion thereof;  

 

b. Issue a certification, in case the NPO cannot accommodate or unable to 
meet the printing requirements of its client agencies pursuant to the 

pertinent provision of the GAA; and 

 

c. Direct the: 
 

i.  Head, JV-Selection Committee to submit to the Audit Team copy of 

pertinent contracts/agreement and other documents to support the 

payments to the above-enumerated private printers, and for 

inspection/review as required by Section 39 (1) of PD No. 1445 on the 

submission of papers relative to government obligations; and 

 

ii. Acting Chief, FMD to ensure the completeness of the supporting 

documents of all disbursements relative to the NPO’s printing 

activities.   

 

Management Comment: 

 

Management explained the engagement of private printers, to wit: 

 

a.   NPO, in the past, was conceptualized to bring in private printers through 
accreditation in accordance with its mandate under MO No. 38, s. 1998 

and MC No. 180, s. 2009.  

 

b.   Considering that the NPO was not granted any appropriations for Capital 
Outlay in the GAA for the FY 2010-2020, the office took the Public-

Private Partnership (PPP) route, through JV Agreements (JVAs) with 

private printers as a feasible undertaking to modernize the agency’s 

printing machines, equipment, and operations. 

 

c.   As part of NPO’s Six-Point Strategic Direction for FY 2018-2020 and as 
a matter of management prerogative, NPO will continue with the JV 

opportunity as a feasible undertaking to perform its mandate and to 

reinforce NPO’s capability and enlarge its operations through infusing 

resources with the private printers. NPO undertakes not only the 

modernization of its printing machines and equipment to increase 

production capability and provide quality printing for various agencies 

but also works hard towards going back to the basics of strengthening 



72 

 

NPO’s values, polishing our crafts, and enabling NPO to be more 

productive in the organization.  

  

Management added that NPO is aware of its statutory duty to uphold and 

adhere to existing laws, rules, and regulations.   

 

Audit Team’s Rejoinder: 

 

The Management comments only support the Audit Team’s observation that 

NPO is not capable of servicing all the printing requirements of its client agencies, 

thus, should have just issued a certification to that effect rather than engaging 

private printers, which is contrary to the rules and regulations of printing of 

accountable forms. 

 

Moreover, nothing in the above-mentioned issuances that NPO is allowed or 

authorized, in any manner, to engage the services of or partner with private entities 

for its printing activities. In the case at hand, the procuring entities/requisitioning 

agencies should have been the ones that directly engage the services of private 

printers, following the relevant provisions of GPPB Resolution No. 05-2010 and 

GAA.

Gender and Development (GAD) Plans and Programs 

              

10. Despite an allocation of P4,187,500.00 for GAD activities in CY 2020, the 
agency was able to fully implement only three activities out of 12 planned 

activities for the year incurring expenditures of P56,908.00 while the rest were 

not implemented thus, the objectives/purposes of the planned activities were 

not fully attained. 

 

Section 31 of the General Provisions (GP) of the General Appropriations Act 

(GAA) of Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 (RA No. 11260) requires “all agencies of the 

government to formulate a GAD Plan designed to address gender issues within 

their concerned sectors or mandate and implement applicable provisions under RA 

No. 9710 also known as the Magna Carta of Women, Convention on the 

Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Beijing Platform 

for Action, the Philippine Plan for the Gender-Responsive Development (1995-

2025) and the Philippine Development Plan (2017-2022)”. 

 

Moreover, the GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of the 

agency, which shall be at least 5 percent of their budgets.  For this purpose, 

activities currently being undertaken by the agency which relate to GAD or those 

that contribute to poverty alleviation, economic empowerment especially of 

marginalized women, protection, promotion, and fulfillment of women’s human 



74 

 

rights and practice of gender-responsive governance are considered sufficient 

compliance with said requirements. 

 

Evaluation of the submitted GAD accomplishments for CY 2019 showed that 

the following planned activities were executed and that the agency spent a total of 

P56,908.02, details below:

While we considered the efforts by Management in implementing its GAD 

program for CY 2020 despite the pandemic, it is incumbent upon us to invite 

attention to the pertinent provisions of prevailing laws and regulations requiring full 

utilization of available funds for the implementation of GAD programs. 

 

With the non-implementation of some Management’s GAD plans and 

programs, the intended clientele was deprived of benefits that could have been 

derived from the GAD-related activities.  In addition, the gender issues and 

concerns could not be fully addressed to ensure that women and men benefit 

equally and equitably. 

 

We recommended that Management continue to maximize the utilization 

of GAD fund to achieve the desired outcomes and goals.  

 

Programs and Projects Related to Senior Citizens and Persons with Disability 

 

11. The NPO continuously implemented and recognized the valuable contribution of 
the elderly in the society and supported the promotion of full participation and total 

integration of PWDs into the mainstream society.  The Management provided the 

following services and facilities for the benefit of the SCs and PWDs: 

 

a) Hiring of PWDs as a contractual support staff; 



76 

 

 

b) Maintenance of express lane wherein SCs and PWDs client are given priority 
services; 

 

c) Provision of wheelchair which reasonably enhance the mobility and safety of 
PWDs; 

 

d) Comfortable priority seats in the waiting area; 
 

e) Medical first-aid assistance for SCs and PWDs clientele. 
 

f) Testimonial program for retiring employees  
 

Tax Laws 

 

12. The NPO withheld and remitted the appropriate taxes due from agency 
personnel and private entities on government purchases and contracts such 

as VAT, EVAT and percentage taxes to the Bureau of Internal Revenue 

(BIR) in accordance with the Executive Order (EO) No. 651. 

 

EO No. 651 dated February 16, 1981 requires “every government office or 

agency to show full and faithful compliance with tax laws and regulations and 

serve as a model to the paying public.  Such directive was reiterated under 

Revenue Regulations 1-87 dated April 2, 1987 and Revenue Memorandum No. 8-

2003 dated March 3, 2001.” 

 

In CY 2020, the NPO withheld and remitted the appropriate taxes due from 

agency personnel and private entities on government purchases and contracts such 

as VAT, EVAT and percentage taxes. Of the total tax withheld amounting to 

P68,291,599.52, P60,127,710.93 was remitted leaving a balance of P16,237,710.05 

as at year-end.  The amount of P11,633,444.27 was remitted on January 28, 2020 

thru ADA leaving an unremitted balance of P4,604,265.78 which is the subject of 

on-going reconciliation with BIR.
