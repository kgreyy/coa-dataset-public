OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

 

Compliance Issues 

 

Suspension of seminar/training fee collections and non-posting of seminar/training fees 

 

1. Suspension of collection of seminar/training fees and non-posting of 
seminar/training fees in the agency’s website had not enabled the recovery of 

the actual training costs, thereby reducing the National Government’s revenues, 

and had not provided interested participants with information on the 

seminar/training fees for their planning considerations, respectively. 

 

All agencies shall ensure that fees, charges, and assessments collected cover 

the cost of services delivered to the public and are deposited with the National 

Treasury.  The fees and charges may be raised by the agencies in accordance with 

Administrative Order No. 31, s. 2012, Department of Finance-Department of Budget 

and Management-National Economic and Development Authority Joint Circular  

No. 1-2013 dated January 30, 2013 and such other guidelines issued by the agencies 

concerned. Such fees should be posted in the website of agencies for the information 

of the public.1  

 

The Government Procurement and Policy Board-Technical Service Office 

(GPPB-TSO) sources its fund for trainings expenses from their appropriations. 

Seminar/training fees collected are deposited to the National Treasury and are not 

utilized for training expenses.  

 

In CY 2020, the GPPB-TSO’s Annual Procurement Plan showed the details 

of the budgeted training costs for the seven training projects, such as, lease of venue 

with meals including accommodation, rental of LED Wall, lanyards, books, 

notepads, training bags, tokens and others totaling P6,909,500.00.  

 

In prior years, the GPPB-TSO charged participants a seminar/training fee of 

P1,500.00 per day.  In CY 2020, however, the GPPB-TSO suspended the collection 

of seminar/training fees on the ground that the private sector and government 

personnel may not be sent to attend trainings unless the related fees are for the 

participants’ personal account. Moreover, CY 2020 was an exploratory period for 

the transition to online learning and the Capacity Development Division (CDD) is 

still to observe the clients’ response to this. Thus, the CDD continued to deliver 

services to the public through the online method of training for free. 
 

Verification of the transactions under Training Expenses, however, disclosed 

that payments for the honoraria of resource persons and lease of venue and meals 

amounted to P2,066,380.00 and P96,452.46, respectively, or a total of 

P2,162,832.46.  

                                                 
1 Paragraph 3 Section 4 of the General Provisions of GAA for Fiscal Year 2020 



30 

 Prior to the suspension of the collection of the seminar/training fees, the 

GPPB-TSO did not undertake an analysis of the effect/s of such suspension on its 

revenues and expenses,  considering that it will incur actual costs for the conduct of 

the trainings. Since the collection of seminar/training fees was suspended, the actual 

costs for the trainings were not recovered, thus, reducing the National Government’s 

revenues. 

 

 Moreover, it was also observed that the seminar/training fee was not posted 

side-by-side with the training program per calendar of activities in the GPPB-TSO’s 

website.  As such, interested participants are not readily informed of the cost of 

attending seminars/trainings for their planning considerations.   

 

We recommended that Management instruct the Head, CDD to: (a) 

resume the collection of seminar/training fees from participants considering all 

costs incurred for the conduct of the seminars/trainings; and (b) post in the 

agency’s website the offered seminars/trainings and the corresponding fee per 

seminar/training for the information of the public. 

 
Compliance with Other Mandatory Accounts/Areas 

 

2. COVID-19-Pandemic Response and Recovery Interventions 
 

For CY 2020, the GPPB-TSO did not receive funds specifically for Corona 

Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) response and/or recovery but has utilized its budget 

for the related expenses.  

 

COVID-19 related expenses charged to Personnel Services (PS) and MOOE 

totaled P63,000.00 and P1,275,889.02, respectively. The results of audit on these 

COVID-related transactions are as follows: 

 

On the grant of hazard pay to employees during ECQ/MECQ 

 

Proclamation No. 929 dated March 16, 2020 placed the Philippines under a 

State of Calamity due to COVID-19. Consequently, Enhanced Community 

Quarantine (ECQ) was imposed effective March 16, 2020, and to be extended as 

warranted by events. 

 

With the health risks and hazards of being physically present in the offices, 

Administrative Order (AO) No. 26 dated March 23, 2020 authorized the grant of 

COVID-19 Hazard Pay to government employees and workers engaged through 

contract of service (COS) or job order (JO) basis who physically report for work 

during the implementation of the ECQ in an amount not exceeding P500/day per 

person. Budget Circular 2020-1 dated March 24, 2020 was issued providing the 

guidelines on the grant of the COVID-19 Hazard Pay.  

 



31 

Analysis of Hazard Pay  and Other General Services as at December 31, 2020 

disclosed the payments of hazard pay at P500/day or a total of P63,000.00  and 

P3,500.00 to 30 regular employees and one Job Order personnel, respectively, who 

reported to office during the ECQ (March 17 to May 15, 2020) and Modified ECQ 

(MECQ) (May 16 to 31, and August 4 to 18, 2020). 
 

Verification of the relevant documents showed that the payments of hazard 

pay were supported with office order/s of GPPB-TSO employees authorized to work 

during the ECQ/MECQ, Daily Time Records, and summary of all employees who 

actually rendered service as Skeleton Work Force during the ECQ and MECQ.    

 

On publication of GPPB-TSO issuances 
  

Executive Order No. 200, series of 1987, requires the publication of laws for 

their effectivity either in the Official Gazette or in a newspaper of general circulation 

in the Philippines.  
 

GPPB resolutions were printed in newspapers of nationwide circulation to 

attain the immediate widest possible dissemination of information. There were two 

entities, The Philippine Daily Inquirer and the PhilStar Daily Inc., which GPPB 

contracted to publish its resolutions. 

 

Analysis of the Advertising, Promotional and Marketing Expenses disclosed 

that the costs of publication of 13 resolutions on the procurement of supplies and 

equipment to combat the spread of COVID-19 amounted to P1,063,272.00.  
 

Verification of the disbursement vouchers showed that the payments for the 

publication costs of the resolutions were duly supported with purchase requests, 

APP, requests for quotation, evaluation reports, Bids and Awards Committee 

Resolutions, Notices of Award, Purchase Orders, advertising invoices, advertising 

contracts, inspection and acceptance report and physical copy of the newspaper 

publication. 

 

On the provision of supplies/materials for internal workplace protocols 

 

Pursuant to Civil Service Commission (CSC) Memorandum Circular No. 10, 

s. 20202 and Proclamation No. 9223, the GPPB-TSO issued Office Order No. 2020-

059 dated June 04, 2020 to implement internal workplace protocols to protect its 

employees reporting from work from COVID-19 while ensuring continuity of 

GPPB-TSO operations in light of COVID-19 pandemic.  

 

Internal workplace protocols include the submission of a Health Declaration 

form a day before the scheduled day to report/visit the Office. Employees and 

scheduled clients before entering the office have to wear face masks at all times, use

a foot bath to sanitize shoes, monitor body temperature, disinfect hands, among 

others. 

 

Analysis of Other Supplies and Materials Expenses and Semi-Expendable 

Machinery and Equipment Expenses totaling P32,705.76  and P9,204.00, 

respectively, or a total of P41,909.76 as at December 31, 2020 disclosed various 

procurements of surgical masks, face shield, head cover and  thermogun, inclusive 

of the regular supplies of alcohol and disinfectant spray from the Procurement 

Service and other suppliers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

 

  The supplies, except for the thermogun, were given to all GPPB employees 

on a quarterly based on the Reports of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMIs) 

attached to Journal Entry Vouchers (JEVs).  

 

Analysis of Fuel, Oil, and Lubricant Expenses disclosed fuel consumption 

totaling P167,207.26 for four service vehicles with conduction stickers: FOG 951, 

FOF 775, SLA 925, and YX 9848 used as shuttle services for GPPB-TSO 

employees  from March 17, 2020 to December 29, 2020. 

 
Gender and Development (GAD) 

 

3. Non-/partial implementation of a total of eight out of the 10 planned GAD 
activities due to the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in unaddressed gender issues. 

 

Section 31 of the General Provisions of the General Appropriations Act 

(GAA) for FY 2020 provides that all agencies of the government shall formulate a 

GAD Plan designed to address gender issues within their concerned sectors or 

mandate and implement the applicable provisions under Republic Act (RA) No. 

9710 or the Magna Carta of Women, Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 

Discrimination Against Women, the Beijing Platform for Action, the Philippine Plan 

for Gender-responsive Development (1995-2025) and the Philippine Development 

Plan (2017-2022). 
 

The GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of the agencies, 

which shall be at least five per cent of their budgets. The activities currently being 

undertaken by the agencies which relate to GAD or those which contribute to 

protection, promotion, and fulfillment of women’s human rights, and practice of 

gender responsive governance, among others, are considered sufficient compliance 

with the said requirement. 
 

Review of the GPPB-TSO GAD Plan for CY 2020 and the related 

Accomplishment Report (AR) disclosed that  of the ten planned activities, seven 

were not implemented  and one  was partially implemented for which P331,554.64 

or 60.55 per cent of the allotted budget of P547,550.00 was utilized, leaving an 

unutilized budget of P215,995.36 or 39.45 per cent.  Details are shown in Table 2:

Based on the AR for CY 2020, majority of GAD activities were not 

implemented in view of the major changes on work arrangement as a result of the 

Community Quarantine due to the COVID-19 pandemic in CY 2020.  

 

With the non-/partial implementation of a significant number of the planned 

GAD activities, the related gender issues were not addressed. 

  

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chairperson, 

GAD Focal Point System to adopt alternative means for conducting/attending 

the GAD activities, such as; conduct of virtual meetings, consultations, 

trainings, briefings surveys and other means, without compromising the health 

protocols being implemented by the government. 

 
4. Senior Citizens, Persons with Disability, and Youth  
 

All agencies of the government shall formulate plans, programs and projects 

intended to address the concerns of senior citizens and persons with disability, 

insofar as it relates to their mandated functions and integrated the same to their 

regular activities.4 

 

All of the agencies of the government, including government-owned and 

controlled corporations, shall provide allocations for the youth development projects 

and activities, which shall include government internships opportunities, within the 

framework of the Philippine Development Plan (2017-2022).5 

 

The building being leased by the GPPB-TSO for its office space has 

architectural and structural features which reasonably enhance the mobility, safety, 

and welfare of senior citizens and differently-abled persons. 

 

For the projects and activities involving the development of the youth, the 

GPPB-TSO was not able to accommodate student interns due to the restrictions in 

the prescribed health protocols, such as, social distancing and number of work force 

allowed to enter in the office premises.

5. Tax Laws, Rules, and Regulations, GSIS and Pag-IBIG Premium Contributions 
and Loan Amortizations, and PhilHealth Premium Contributions  

 

For CY 2020, the GPPB-TSO had faithfully deducted from the salaries of 

personnel the required taxes, premiums, contributions on personal share for Pag-

IBIG and PhilHealth and social insurance contributions; withheld taxes from 

contractors and creditable value-added taxes from suppliers/dealers, and remitted the 

same, as well as, the government share within the prescribed period to the respective 

institutions or agencies. The summary of withholdings/deductions and remittances is 

shown in Table 3.

Summary of Taxes Withheld and Electronic Tax Remittance Advises 

uncertified by the Accountant and unapproved by the Head of Head of Agency 

or his authorized representative for the remittances of taxes withheld to the 

BIR had not confirmed the correctness of the remittances and the authority to 

make the remittances in the amounts indicated therein.  

 

Section 60 of Chapter 6, Volume I,  Government Accounting Manual  for 

National Government Agencies  requires that the printed copy of the Tax Remittance 

Advice (TRA) accomplished on-line called an Electronic TRA (eTRA),  shall be 

certified correct by the Head of Accounting Division/Unit and approved by the Head 

of Agency/Authorized Official, and be used to record the remittance of taxes 

withheld to the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR).  

 

The eTRA shall be supported with the Summary of Taxes Withheld (STW) 

certified by the Head of Accounting.  The STW is a document which summarizes the 

type and amount of taxes withheld. 

 

Review of the tax remittances for CY 2020 revealed that eTRAs and STWs 

supporting  the JEVs for the remittances of taxes  showed that both documents were 

not certified by the Accountant and approved by the Head of agency.  



36 

Inquiry with the Accountant disclosed that the preparation of eTRAs is 

based on the STWs for taxes withheld from suppliers and the schedules generated 

from the Electronic New Government Accounting System (eNGAS) for taxes 

withheld from employees. The Accountant is the only user who can access the 

electronic Filing and Payment System (eFPS) online portal and has sole control over 

the transactions. The BIR portal issues the validated eTRA for printing by the 

agency, to be certified by the Accountant and approved by the Head of the Agency 

as supporting documents in the recognition of the remittances of taxes to the BIR. 

However, the eTRA is prepared and filed thru the eFPS of the BIR even without the 

STWs approval by the Head of the Agency. It was also informed that the Head, 

Finance Division is the authorized official to approve the STWs and eTRAs but 

there was no Office Order issued to show the said authority.   

 

All taxes withheld for CY 2020 were remitted to the BIR based on 

submitted eTRAs, and STWs schedules from the eNGAS.  

 

As the eTRAs and STWs were uncertified by the Accountant and 

unapproved by the Head of the agency, there was no confirmation of the correctness 

of the remittances and of the authority to make the remittances in the amounts 

indicated therein and appropriate supporting documents for the recognition of the 

remittances of the taxes in the books. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to issue the necessary 

Office Order to delegate the approval of the STWs and eTRAs by the Head of 

Agency to a designated authorized representative.    

 

We also recommended and Management agreed to require the 

Accountant to: (a) certify the eTRAs and STWs and forward the same to the 

Head of Agency or the authorized representative for approval before remitting 

the taxes withheld through the eFPS portal of the BIR; and (b) submit the 

printed eTRAs together with the approved STWs to the Head of Agency or the 

authorized representative for approval and to be used as supporting documents 

in the recognition of remittances of taxes in the books of the agency. 

 
6. Information and Publicity on Projects/Programs/Activities (PPA) 

 

Item 2.2 of COA Circular No. 2013-004 dated January 30, 2013 requires that 

notification to the public and other forms of announcement and/or publicity related 

to the PPAs shall be made at the least possible cost through posting relevant 

information on signboards, blackboards, whiteboards, among others, or similar 

materials in conspicuous places within the agency premises, and in the venue where 

the PPA is located or carried out. 

 

The GPPB-TSO has two PPAs, one is the development of audio visual 

presentations and information, education, and communication materials where the 

funds were only transferred to the GPPB-TSO from the Presidential 



37 

Communications Operations Office and the other is the GPPB-TSO building project 

of which funds were eventually transferred to the Department of Public Works and 

Highways. Verification of the Report of Quarterly Publicized PPAs showed that the 

publicity prescribed in COA Circular No. 2013-004 is not applicable to the GPPB-

TSO. 

 
7. Transparency in Infrastructure Projects 

 

Section 93 of the General Provisions, GAA for FY 2020 requires all agencies 

of government to post in their websites details regarding infrastructure projects, such 

as the project title, location, detailed description, detailed estimates in arriving at the 

Approved Budget for the Contract, and winning contractor and the detailed estimates 

of the bid as awarded, within 30 calendar days from entering into contract, among 

others. 

 

 The GPPB-TSO’s had posted the required information and details for its 

infrastructure projects in their website and were up to date. 

 
8. Transparency Seal on the Official Website 
 

Section 94 of the General Provisions, GAA FY 2020 states that in order to 

enhance transparency and enforce accountability, all agencies of government shall 

maintain a Transparency Seal (TS) to be posted on their website.  The TS shall 

contain vital information such as agency’s mandates and functions, names of its 

officials with their position and designation, and contact information, approved 

budgets and corresponding targets, among others. 

 

 The GPPB-TSO had complied with the posting requirements of all required 

reports/information in the TS of its website. 

 
9. GSIS Property Insurance Law 
    

Republic Act No. 656, otherwise known as the Property Insurance Law, as 

amended by Presidential Decree No. 245, requires, among others, that every 

government, except a municipal government below first class, to insure its properties 

with the Fund against any insurable risk and pay the premiums thereon, which, 

however, shall not exceed the premiums charged by private insurance companies. 
 

For CY 2020, in compliance with the above law, the GPPB-TSO insured 

with the General Insurance Fund of the GSIS, all properties and equipment listed in 

its Report on Physical Count on PPE totaling P4,839,285.29 for a total premium 

payment of P266,270.20. 

 

 

 

 



38 

10. Hiring of Casual, Job Orders, Contractual, and Consultants   
 

CSC-DBM-COA Joint Circular (JC) No. 2, s. 2020, allows agencies of 

government to contract the services of new COS and JO workers and renew the 

existing contracts until December 31, 2021. 

 

The GPPB-TSO hired nine COS and two JO personnel in CY 2020. The JO 

personnel served as utility workers while the COS personnel were assigned to 

provide clerical and administrative assistance in three Divisions. 

  

In compliance with the said JC, the agency had included in the contracts of 

COS and the JO personnel the payment of salary or wage equivalent to the daily 

salary or wage of comparable positions in the government and a premium of up to 20 

per cent of the salary wage. The hiring of JO and COS personnel was within the 

parameters provided for in the JC and no deficiency was noted. 

 

Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 50-2018 dated May 11, 2018 clarified 

that the public or government sector that hired individuals under a JO or COS 

scheme shall withhold both income and applicable business taxes, if any. However, 

if the individual JO’s or COS’ annual gross receipts will not exceed P250,000.00, the 

income payments may be exempted from both withholding tax on income upon 

submission of a Sworn Declaration of Gross Receipts/Sales, together with the copy 

of the Certificate of Registration, or copy of the BIR Form 1901, and withholding of 

percentage tax, if JO/COS personnel signified the option to avail the eight per cent 

income tax rate regime in the sworn declaration. 

 

The JO and COS personnel held various positions, with gross receipts not 

exceeding P250,000.00 per individual.  The individual JO/COS’ sworn declaration 

were also duly submitted and received by BIR on November 18, 2020. The 

Accountant had also submitted the sworn declaration as withholding agent and has 

certified that individual JO/COS’ gross income did not exceed P250,000.00.  

 
11. Status of Suspensions, Disallowances, and Charges 
 

The GPPB-TSO has no prior year’s balance of suspension, disallowance or 

charge.  The audit of transactions during the year did not disclose any deficiency that 

warrants the issuance of a Notice of Suspension/Disallowance/Charge.
