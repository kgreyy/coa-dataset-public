C. Scope and Objectives of Audit  
 

The audit covered the financial accounts and operations of the GPPB-TSO for the 

year ended December 31, 2020. The audit was conducted to: (a) verify the level of 

assurance that may be placed on Management’s assertions on the financial 

statements; (b) determine the propriety of transactions as well as the extent of 

compliance with pertinent laws, rules and regulations; (c) recommend agency’s 

improvement opportunities; and (d) determine the extent of implementation of prior 

years’ audit recommendations. 

 

 

D. Audit Methodology 
 

We adopted a risk-based audit approach in the audit of the financial statements of 

the GPPB-TSO and in the review of compliance with laws, rules, and regulations.  

The Audit Team which carried out the audit, among others, (i) examined financial 

and accounting procedures adopted by the GPPB-TSO and other relevant 

documentation; (ii) assessed internal controls regulating financial operations and 

carried out compliance testing for determining the extent of control in operation; 

(iii)  conducted substantive testing of a representative sample of selected 

transactions;  (iv) carried out review, on test check basis, of a number of contracts 

and transactions related to movements in balances of assets, liabilities, revenues, 

and expenses; and (v) conducted interviews and held discussions with the concerned 

staff  in the agency.  



 
 

 iii 

 

The results of the audit were communicated to the Head of the Agency and the 

concerned officials through the issuance of Audit Observation Memoranda.  

 

 

E. Independent Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements 
 

The Auditor rendered an unmodified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the 

financial statements as at December 31, 2020.  

 

 

F. Summary of Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations 

 
Among the audit observations and corresponding recommendations discussed in Part 

II of this report, the significant observations are summarized as follows: 

 

1. Suspension of collection of seminar/training fees and non-posting of 
seminar/training fees in the agency’s website had not enabled the recovery of the 

actual training costs thereby reducing the National Government’s revenues and 

had not provided interested participants with information on the seminar/training 

fees for their planning considerations, respectively. 
 

We recommended that Management instruct the Head, Capacity 

Development Division to: (a) resume the collection of seminar/training fees 

from participants considering all costs incurred for the conduct of the 

seminars/trainings; and (b) post in the agency’s website the offered 

seminars/trainings and the corresponding fee per training for the 

information of the public. 

 
2. Non-/partial implementation of a total of eight out of the 10 planned Gender and 

Development (GAD) activities due to the Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) 

pandemic resulted in unaddressed gender issues. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chairperson, 

GAD Focal Point System to adopt alternative means for 

conducting/attending the GAD activities, such as; conduct of virtual 

meetings, consultations, trainings, briefings surveys and other means, 

without compromising the health protocols being implemented by the 

government. 

 
The aforementioned observations and recommendations and Management comments 

were summarized in the Summary of Audit Observations and Recommendations and 

sent to Management on April 8, 2021 for their further comments in lieu of an exit 

conference.  Management’s response was received on May 10, 2021, and its views 

and comments were incorporated in the report, where appropriate.

G. Status of Audit Suspensions, Disallowances, and Charges 
 

The audit of transactions during the year did not disclose any deficiency that 

warrants the issuance of a Notice of Suspension/Disallowance/Charge.   

 

 

H. Status of Implementation of Prior Years’ Audit Recommendations 
 

Out of the 24 recommendations contained in the CY 2019 Annual Audit Report, 21 

were implemented and three have remained not implemented. The details are 

discussed in Part III of this report. 

 

We enjoin Management to ensure full implementation of all audit 

recommendations to improve the financial and operational efficiency of the 

agency.
