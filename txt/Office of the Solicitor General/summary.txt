The audit covered the financial and compliance of the OSG for CY 2020.

D)	Auditor’s Report 

			

The Auditor rendered an unmodified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the FS of the OSG as of December 31, 2020. 



E)		Summary of Observations and Recommendations

	

1)	The balance of the Cash in Bank, Local Currency, Current Account amounting to P52,086,192.00 as at year-end was not fairly presented due to the inclusion of stale checks totaling P211,360.95, contrary to Section 44 Chapter 6 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM). 

(Observation No. 1)

We recommended that Management direct the Cashier to cancel the stale checks and the Chief Accountant to prepare the necessary adjustments taking up the cancellation and replacement of stale checks.



2)	Performance bond/security deposit amounting to P140,000.00 was deposited to the local currency, current account maintained with the depository bank instead of the account of the National Treasury contrary to Section 7 of the General Provisions of the General Appropriations Act (GAA) of FY 2020. Consequently, this resulted in the overstatement of the Cash in Bank – Local Currency Current Account and the understatement of the Cash – Treasury/Agency Deposit-Trust Account both by P140,000.00.   

 (Observation No. 2)



We recommended that Management direct the Cashier to deposit the amount of P140,000.00 to the account of the National Treasury pursuant to the provision of Section 7 of the General Provisions of GAA 2020 and instruct the Chief Accountant to take up the necessary adjustment in the books.



3)	The balance of Inventories accounts aggregating P3,762,000.61 as at year-end was misstated due to: a) unrecorded deliveries amounting to P492,061.92; b) recognition of semi-expendable properties totaling P319,800.00 as Furniture and Fixtures and non-submission of the Report of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI) amounting to P97,600.00 to the Accounting Division. Furthermore, other deficiencies noted include: c) presence of impaired/ obsolete and non-moving office supplies inventories totaling P452,829.22; d) regular procurement of supplies amounting to P214,905.26 was not coursed through the inventory account but rather taken up as outright expense; and e) the Property Officer was not bonded contrary to Section 101 of PD No. 1445.

(Observation No. 3)



We recommended that Management instruct the a) Property Officer to promptly forward/transmit to the Accounting Division the Inspection and Acceptance Report and photocopy of Purchase Order and Delivery Receipt for timely recording of received/accepted goods;  b) Chief Accountant to prepare a JEV to adjust the PPE and Semi-Expendable accounts accordingly and Stock Card Keeper to regularly submit the RSMI to the Accounting Division as basis in the preparation of JEV;  c) Property Officer to regularly submit List of Obsolete/Non-Moving Supplies Inventories to the Financial and Management Services Accountant, copy furnished the Audit Team (AT) and prepare Waste Material Reports for all obsolete items in the Office Supplies Inventory account so that the same may be properly disposed of;  d) Chief Accountant to comply with the existing regulations and stop the practice of directly recording purchases as outright expense; and e) Property Officer to apply for fidelity bond with the Bureau of the Treasury to cover her accountability for inventories.



4)	The balance of the Computer Software account amounting to P12,658,124.44 as at December 31, 2020 was misstated due to erroneous recording of progress payment for project accomplishment amounting to P693,000.00 which resulted in the overstatement of the Computer Software and Advances to Contractor accounts both by P346,500.00 or a total of P693,000.00 and the understatement of the Development in Progress-Computer Software account by P693,000.00.  (Observation No. 4) 



We recommended that Management instruct the Chief Accountant to prepare a JEV necessary to correct/adjust the erroneous entries made and observe proper recording and usage of accounts in accordance with the GAM.



5)	The required publication of documents relative to procurement of medical supplies totaling P1,492,988.01 in the Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB) online portal, website of the procuring entity or at any conspicuous place pursuant to Section 4 of Republic Act No. 11494 or the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act was not complied with. Likewise, claims for said procurement were not supported with required documents contrary to Section 4(6) of Presidential Decree No. 1445.   (Observation No. 5)



We recommended that Management instruct the: a) concerned BAC Secretariat official/personnel to comply with the publication requirement of RA No. 11494 or the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act; and b) concerned Finance Management Services Official to ensure completeness of supporting documents before processing of claims.



6)	Warranty Security/Deposit was not imposed and collected from supplier to guaranty performance of obligation in the procurement of goods amounting to P9,346,600.00, contrary to Section 62.1 of RA No. 9184. (Observation No. 6)



We recommended that Management direct the: a)  Finance Management Services to collect/impose from supplier/contractor warranty security deposit equivalent to one percent of the contract price on every procurement of goods; and b) submit explanation why warranty/security deposit for subject procurement was not imposed or collected. 



7)	Remittance of membership dues amounting to P1,583,394.14 to OSG Employees Association (OSGEA) was not supported with Official Receipt (OR) issued by the OSGEA contrary to Section 4, (6) of PD 1445. (Observation No. 7)

8)	The Committee on Senior Citizen and Differently-Abled Employees failed to fully implement the programs, activities and projects amounting to P310,900.00 in the Work and Financial Plan for CY 2020 formulated in conformity with Section 32 of the GAA of 2020. (Observation No.8)

We recommended that Management direct the: a) GAD Committee to explore and adopt possible alternative modes of accomplishing PAPs in view of the current situation, such as zoom  meeting/virtual conferences and the like; and

 b) Planning Section to promptly submit WFP which should be in congruent with the approved budget advice for GAD. 



	The above findings and recommendations were brought to the attention of concerned officials of the agency in our letter dated April 13, 2021 for further comment.  Management’s views and reactions were considered in the report, where appropriate.
