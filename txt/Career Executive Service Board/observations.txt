OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS





FINANCIAL ISSUES



Delayed liquidations of Cash Advances



1)	Cash advances for special projects amounting to P315,400.00 were not liquidated as soon as the purpose for which these were granted have been served which is not in accordance with the existing rules and regulations. Likewise, additional cash advances of P66,750.00 were granted to the AO even if the previous cash advances were not settled/liquidated. 



	1)	Section 89 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 states that, “Cash advances shall be liquidated as soon as the purpose for which it was granted has been served.”



	2)	Paragraph 4.1.3 (ix) of COA Circular No. 2009-002 dated May 18, 2009 further state that “Cash advance for special time-bound undertaking shall be liquidated by the accountable officer concerned within one month from the date the purpose of the cash advance was accomplished.”  



	3)	On the other hand, COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 2, 1997 provides that “no additional cash advance shall be allowed to any official or employee unless the previous cash advance given to him is first settled or a proper accounting thereof is made”.



	4)	Analysis disclosed that the account Advances to Officers and Employees as of September 30, 2020 includes the amount of P315,400.00 which represents advances for special time-bound undertakings granted to officers and employees which remained outstanding even if the purpose had already been served.  It was noted that the outstanding cash advances were already beyond the prescribed period to liquidate the advances. This special time-bound cash advances were used for the conduct of CESB’s Annual Family Day on December 23, 2019 and for expenses to defray expenses relative to the purchase of 2019 CESB Institutional tokens. The amount should have been liquidated on or before December 31, 2019. 



1.5   The details of the unliquidated balance of cash advances of P315,400.00 are shown below:

	1)	As can be gleaned from the above data, there is a significant delay in the submission of the liquidation reports.  In addition, the Accountable Officer was granted additional cash advances in the amount of P66,750.00 (Table 2) despite having unliquidated cash advances, as shown below:

	2)	Such practice is not in accordance with the foregoing provisions.



	3)	We recommended that Management:

	

a)	Require the Accountable   Officer    concerned    to    liquidate    her cash advances so that proper accounting could be made thereof to ensure fairness of accounts presentation in the Financial Statements; and

	

b)	Instruct the Accountant to issue certification that previous cash advances have been liquidated and accounted for in the books before granting a new cash advance; and closely monitor the liquidation of cash advances granted to AOs within the prescribed period. 

			

	4)	Management in their reply letter dated November 23, 2020 to AOM No. 2020-001 dated November 17, 2020 informed the Audit Team that liquidations were already made on the said cash advances and attached the liquidation documents broken down as follows:

	5)	Management also informed the Audit Team that the balance of P2,309.50 was deducted from the salary of the Chief, Finance and Administrative Division (FAD) for the month of December 2020.



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



	6)	We took note of the Management’s reply to our AOM but upon examination of the liquidation documents submitted by the Chief Accountant to COA, we found out that the cash advance under Check No. 468277 is not yet fully liquidated. The Accountable Officer had overlooked that liquidation made was short in the amount of P5,000.00. The Chief Accountant was verbally informed about it and asked to relay to the accountable officer the settlement of said amount to fully comply with the AOM.



	7)	On January 5, 2021, the Chief Accountant submitted the Sales Invoice No. 1846 dated December 27, 2019 in the amount of P5,000.00 as additional supporting documents for the liquidation reports LRGF 2020-11-019 and LRGF 2020-11-020. 



	8)	During the exit conference, the CESB’s Executive Director committed to implement a system wherein before a new cash advance is granted, a certification that previous cash advances had already been liquidated/accounted shall be required from the Accountant. 





OTHER FINANCIAL ISSUES



Late submission of Financial Reports



2)	Due to non-submission of monthly financial reports, supporting schedules and corresponding supporting documents to the COA Auditor’s Office within the deadlines set by existing auditing rules and regulations, the Auditor was prevented from conducting timely audit and communicating the results to Management for immediate correction of deficiency/ies noted, if any.



	1)	Sub-sections 6.05 of COA Circular No. 95-006 dated May 18, 1995 provides “the official involved in the daily recording of transactions in the books of accounts shall turn over the receipts and the disbursement records with all paid vouchers and documents evidencing the transaction to the Auditor within 10 days from date of receipts of said documents”.  



	2)	Moreover, Section 60, Chapter 19, of the GAM, Vol. I, also provides that all Central Offices of National Government Agencies (NGAs) shall submit to the COA Auditor the following financial statements and schedules as follows, within the prescribed deadline:



Particulars

Due Date

Monthly Trial Balance/Supporting Schedules

Ten days after the end of                        the month

Quarterly Trial Balance/Financial Statements/                  Supporting Schedules 

Ten days after the end of the quarter



	3)	The delayed submission of the required reports/documents to the Audit Team affected the timely verification of the same, the communication of results to Management and the early correction of deficiency/ies noted, if any. 



	4)	The Management informed that strict observance of fifty percent (50%) operational capacity due to the declaration of the Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) greatly affected the preparation of reports. The financial documents (DVs, Liquidation Reports, etc.) are voluminous to be transported to and from the office. Thus, the process is affected by the availability of the employees. 



	5)	While we agree with Management’s explanation as regards the effect of COVID-19 in the preparations of reports, we also emphasize the fact that even before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the new normal, Management had already been having difficulties in meeting the set deadlines for the submission of various financial reports This practice, time and again, has been noted in prior years’ audit reports and this was mainly attributed to the lack of staff to assist the Chief Accountant.  To date, the Accounting Division remains to be a one-man unit.



	6)	With the limited manpower, the Management should consider hiring additional personnel to assist in the Finance Department considering that for many years, it has been their perennial problem. Taking for example in the Accounting Division wherein the Accountant III is the only Accounting personnel. This is counter-productive and in a way raised internal control concerns. With the DBM’s approval of one Accountant I (CY 2019 newly-created position), the Management may now embark in hiring a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) for the position.



	7)	For CY 2020, the CESB was not able to submit the required Reports to the Audit Team within the prescribed period namely: (a) journal entry voucher; (b) disbursement vouchers; and (c) journal entry voucher.  The number of days of delay in the submission ranged from 5 to 291 days.  Details are presented in Appendix B.



	8)	This observation has been in CESB prior years’ Annual Audit Reports (AARs) and Management Letters (MLs).





	9)	We reiterated our previous year’s recommendations that Management direct the Chief Accountant and other concerned personnel to submit:



a)	Regularly the disbursement records with all the paid vouchers, Report of Collections and Deposits with supporting documents evidencing the transaction to the Audit Team within 10 days from date of receipt of said documents in compliance with Section 6.05 of the COA Circular No. 95-006 dated May 18, 1995; and



b)	The Trial Balance within 10 days after the end of each month



	10)	Management admitted the delay in their submission of Financial Reports for Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 and committed not to repeat the same lapses in the succeeding years and to institute corrective measures/actions that would allow them to submit timely the required reports. 



	11)	Management also mentioned that the Financial Statements as of December 31, 2020 were submitted on February 8, 2021 or six days before the deadline on February 14, 2021. 



	12)	It was also informed during the exit conference, that Management is now in the process of hiring an Accountant I, having considered applicants for the said position.  For the past months, the hiring process was put to a halt because of the absence of a duly appointed Executive Director. After the appointment of the Executive Director in February 2021, the recruitment of an Accountant I began. 





 Delay in the submission of BRS



3)	The  accuracy  of  the     Cash in     Bank   account    with      year-end  balance of      P31.505 million  could     not be     ascertained         as      the    submission of the monthly    Bank     Reconciliation Statement (BRS) is not in accordance with existing, laws, rules and regulations.



  3.1   Section 74 of P.D. No. 1445 provides that, “At the close of each month, depositories shall report to the agency head, in such form as he may direct the condition of the agency account standing on their books.  The head of the agency shall see to it that a reconciliation is made between the balance shown in the report and the balance found in the books of the agency”.



	1)	COA Circular No. 92-125A dated March 4, 1992 requires that “the Chief Accountant/Head of Accounting Units of National Government Agencies shall prepare the Bank Reconciliation Statement and submit the same to the Auditor within fifteen days after the end of each month”.



	2)	This practice of not submitting the BRS within the timeline required resulted in difficulty ascertaining the accuracy of the total Cash in Bank balance of P31,504,806.29 reflected in the books of the Agency and in the depository banks.  Moreover, possible errors or items requiring adjustment by the bank or in the books of the Agency cannot be corrected or adjusted immediately.



	3)	Records disclose that in CY 2019, Audit Observation Memorandum No. 2020-001 (2019) dated January 28, 2020 was issued.  Audit revealed that the monthly financial reports, supporting schedules and corresponding supporting documents were submitted with delay ranging from 6 days to 152 days.  Moreover, the BRS was also transmitted beyond the prescribed period. 



	4)	Accordingly, Management was committed to ensure compliance and prompt submission of all requirements. Besides, systematic flow of work and distribution of tasks were put in place to keep up with deadlines and to avoid any delay.  However, until now some reports were not timely submitted.



	5)	For CY 2020, the BRSs were not submitted to the Audit Team within the prescribed period with delay ranging from 12 to 262 days as shown in Appendix C.



	6)	This is a reiteration of prior year’s audit observation.



	7)	We reiterated our previous year’s recommendations that Management direct the Chief Accountant and other concerned personnel to submit BRS regularly to the Auditor within 15 days after the end of each month, in compliance with Section 2.1.4 of COA Circular 92-125A dated March 4, 1992, for verification to establish correctness of the cash accounts.



	8)	Management admitted the delay in their submission of Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 and committed not to repeat the same lapses in the succeeding years.  Corrective measures/actions will be introduced to allow them to submit timely the required reports. 



	9)	As to the submission of Bank Reconciliation Statements, Management stated that banking transactions were likewise affected by the pandemic. They provided a matrix presenting the receipts by the CESB of the Bank Statements (Table 4) as follows:

	COMPLIANCE ISSUES

			

			Non-compliance with the requirement of observers in the procurement process 

			

4)	Relevant provision with regard to the invitation of observer/s, aside from the COA representative in the procurement of goods as provided in the 2016 Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (RIRR) of RA 9184 was not complied with. 



	1)	Section 13.1.  states that, to enhance the transparency of the process, the BAC shall, during the eligibility checking, shortlisting, pre-bid conference, preliminary examination of bids, bid evaluation, and post-qualification, invite, in addition to the representative of the COA, at least two (2) observers who shall not have the right to vote, to sit in its proceedings where:



1)	At least one (1) shall come from a duly recognized private group in a sector or discipline relevant to the procurement at hand, for example: xxx



2)	The other observer shall come from non-government organization (NGO)



	2)	Section 13. 2.  Observers shall be invited at least five (5) calendar days before the date of the procurement stage/activity. The absence of observers will not nullify the BAC proceedings: Provided, that they have duly invited     in writing.   The Procuring     Entities should      ensure      that the     invitation is received at least five (5) calendar days before each procurement activity.    In the event that a procurement activity has to be postponed, the observers shall be notified immediately of the change in schedule



	3)	In our review of the procurement procedures undertaken by the agency for the Pre-Bid Conference on December 29, 2020, to discuss the requirements and technical aspect of the following procurement projects: 



	a)	Procurement of Desktop Computers and Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS)

P2,990,000.00

	b)	Procurement of Laptop Computers

860,000.00

	c)	Procurement of Microsoft Licenses

2,562,000.00



         we noted that the forgoing provision to invite observers other than representative from Commission on Audit was not complied with.

  

	4)	CESB sent out invitation to the non-CESB personnel, the suppliers and the COA Representative but none to a duly recognized private group in the sector or discipline relevant to the procurement at hand and other observer from non-government organization (NGO).



	5)	We recommended that Management require the BAC to invite representatives from an NGO and duly recognized private sector entities, in addition to a COA representative, as observers to the various stages in the procurement process in compliance with Section 13.1 of the 2016 RIRR of RA 9184. 

	

	6)	Management explained that the provision in inviting two representatives from the private sector and the non-government organizations was then overlooked.



	7)	In addition, due to the pandemic and the urgency of meeting the deadline for early procurement, they had difficulty reaching out to private sector organizations or industry associations.  Management assured the Audit Team of strict adherence to Section 13.1 of RA 9184.

			

			Auditor’s Rejoinder:

			

	8)	We appreciated Management’s commitment to comply with the rules on mandatory observers despite the difficulties and limitations brought about by the pandemic. 





OTHER COMPLIANCE ISSUES 



Gender and Development (GAD)

	

5)	Despite an allocation of P6.492 million for GAD activities in CY 2020 or 8.82          percent of total appropriations, the agency was able to fully implement only            eight activities out of the 13 planned activities for the year  incurring   expenditures of P4.247 million or 65.41 percent of the total allocation, while the rest were either partially implemented or not implemented at all thus, the objectives/purposes of the plan activities were not fully attained. 



	1)	Section 31 of the General Appropriations Act (GAA) for Fiscal Year 2020, requires that “all government agencies shall formulate a GAD Plan and Budget designed to address the gender issues within their concerned sectors or mandate and implement applicable provisions under RA No. 9710 or the Magna Carta of Women, Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the Beijing Platform for Action, the Philippine Plan for Gender-Responsive Development (1995-2025), and the Philippine Development Plan (2017-2022)”. 

	

	2)	The GAD Plan is required to be integrated in the regular activities of the concerned government agency and shall be at least five percent of the total budget allocation. For this purpose, activities currently being undertaken by agencies which relate to GAD or those that contribute to poverty alleviation, economic empowerment especially of marginalized women, protection, promotion, and fulfilment of women’s human rights, and practice of gender-responsive governance are considered compliance with said requirement. Utilization of GAD budget shall be evaluated based on the GAD performance indicators identified by said agencies. 



	3)	Joint Circular No. 2012-1 of the PCW, NEDA and DBM provides that at least five percent of the total agency budget appropriations authorized under the annual GAA shall correspond to activities supporting GAD plans and programs. The GAD budget shall be drawn from the agency’s maintenance and other operating expenses (MOOE), capital outlay (CO), and personnel services (PS).



	4)	Based on a copy of the CY 2020 GAD Plan and Budget (GPB), a total of P6,492,000.00 or 8.82 percent of its total appropriations of P73,570,519.62 for CY 2020 was allotted for the implementation of GAD activities/program in compliance with Section 6.1 of PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01.  The actual expenditures incurred for the GAD activities for CY 2020 as reflected in the GAD Accomplishment Report totaled P4,246,652.30 or 65.41 percent utilization of the budget.



	5)	The Agency reported the GAD related activities during the year, with details in Appendix D, as follows:

	6)	While we considered the efforts exerted by Management in implementing its GAD program for CY 2020 despite the pandemic, it is incumbent upon us to invite attention to the pertinent provisions of prevailing laws and regulations requiring full utilization of available funds for the implementation of GAD programs.



	7)	With the non-implementation of some Management’s GAD plans and programs, the intended clientele was deprived of benefits that could have been derived from the GAD-related activities. In addition, the gender issues and concerns could not be fully addressed to ensure that women and men benefit equally and equitably. 

,

	8)	We recommended that Management:



a)	Ensure compliance with pertinent provisions of the GAA and the Magna Carta of Women by providing a more feasible GAD Plan to address the issues and concerns of intended clientele thus, achieving gender equality and women empowerment goals, and establish framework that enables CESB to monitor full implementation of  all GAD-related activities; and



b)	Efficiently and effectively utilize the amount allocated to GAD mainstreamed in the programs/projects/activities of the agency.

		



Senior Citizens (SC) and Persons with Disability (PWD)



6)	The CESB carried out various programs/projects/activities (PPA) for senior citizens and differently-abled persons with disability (PWD) and spent a total cost of P45,000. and P92,000., respectively, for each PPA that addressed their respective concerns.  



	1)	Section 32 of the GAA for FY 2020 provides that “all agencies of the government shall formulate plans, programs and projects intended to address the concerns of senior citizens and PWDs, insofar as these relate to their mandated functions, and integrate the same in their regular activities”.



	2)	The above provision also requires that all government infrastructures and facilities shall provide architectural or structural features, designs or facilities that will reasonably enhance the mobility, safety and welfare of PWDs pursuant to Batas Pambansa Blg. 344 and R.A. No. 7277, as amended. 



	3)	For CY 2020, the CESB provided the budget for specific plans, programs or projects to address the concerns of senior citizens and PWDs and reported the following accomplishments:

Tax Laws, Rules and Regulations



7)	The agency complied with tax regulations on withholding, filing of returns, and remittances in CY 2019. 

	

	1)	Revenue Regulations No. 10-2008 dated July 8, 2008 provides that “all government offices are constituted as withholding agents for purposes of the creditable tax required to be withheld on income payment from compensation, contractors, suppliers of goods and services.  As withholding agents, they are primarily liable for the payment of the taxes to the National Treasury through the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR)”.



	2)	Further, Section 7 of Revenue Regulations No. 1-2013 dated January 23, 2013 provides that “filing of returns and payment of taxes shall be made on or before the 10th day of the month following the month in which withholding was made, except for taxes   withheld for the month of December of each year, which shall be filed on or before January 15 of the succeeding year”.
