EXECUTIVE SUMMARY





A)	Introduction



The Career Executive Service Board (CESB) was created pursuant to the Integrated Reorganization Plan, which was enacted into law under Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1 on September 24, 1972 as amended by PD 336 dated November 14, 1973 and PD 367 dated January 5, 1974.



The CESB professionalizes and strengthens the Career Executive Service (CES) by creating a continuing pool of well-selected and development-oriented, service-focused and reform-driven career administrators in government.



It is attached to the Civil Service Commission (CSC) for the purpose of attaining policy and program coordination. As such, it is primarily responsible for the promulgation and implementation of rules, standards and procedures in the selection, classification, compensation and career development of members of the CES.



The CESB is headed by Executive Director (ED) and the term of office of the ED is dependent on the appointing authority. With the approval of the rationalization plan on October 23, 2006 and its implementation effective January 1, 2007, the Executive Director directly supervises the Finance and Administrative Division (FAD) and two services, namely the Policy, Planning, Legal Assistance and Information Services and the Recruitment and Career Development Services.



Atty. Maria Anthonette C. Velasco-Allones served as Executive Director of the CESB since 2007 until her transfer to the Tourism Promotions Board (TPB) on February 10, 2020 where she was appointed as the Chief Operating Officer (COO).



After Atty. Velasco-Allones’ transfer to the TPB, then Director III Hiro V. Masuda, DBA, CESO IV was designated by President Rodrigo R. Duterte as Officer-in-Charge of the agency. He assumed the said position only until July 8, 2020 due to his transfer to the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR).

	

Following Director Masuda’s transfer to the DENR, Ms. Maria Marcy Cosare-Ballesteros was designated as Officer-in-Charge (OIC) from July 9, 2020 to present. Before her designation as Officer-in-Charge, Ms. Cosare-Ballesteros was appointed as Director III of the CESB and assumed office on February 27, 2020. 



The policy making body of the CESB is composed of board members appointed by the President. As of December 31, 2020 the Board was led by Hon. Alicia de la-Rosa-Bala, current CSC Chairperson as Chairman, with the following as Members: 



1)	Engelbert C. Caronan Jr.

3)	Rolandos L. Metin

C)	Scope and Objectives of Audit



An audit was made on the accounts and operations of the CESB for CY 2020.  It was conducted to: (a) verify the level of reliance that may be placed on Management’s assertions on the financial statements; (b) determine the extent of compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations; (c) recommend agency improvement opportunities; and (d) determine the extent of implementation of prior years’ audit recommendations.





D)	Independent Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements



The auditor rendered an unmodified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the CESB’s financial statements as of December 31, 2020.





E)	Summary of Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations 



The following audit observations and the corresponding recommendations, which are presented in detail in Part II, were communicated through Audit Observation Memoranda (AOM) and issuance of Summary of Audit Observations and Recommendations (SAOR).  



1)	The accuracy of the Cash-in-Bank account with year-end balance of P31.505 million could not be ascertained as the submission of the monthly Bank Reconciliation Statement (BRS) is not in accordance with existing laws, rules and regulations. (Observation No. 3)



We reiterated our previous year’s recommendations that Management direct the Chief Accountant and other concerned personnel to submit BRS regularly to the Auditor within 15 days after the end of each month, in compliance with Section 2.1.4 of COA Circular 92-125A dated March 4, 1992, for verification to establish correctness of the cash accounts. 



2)	Despite an allocation of P6.492 million for GAD activities in CY 2020 or 8.82          percent of total appropriations, the agency was able to fully implement only            eight activities out of the 13 planned activities for the year incurring expenditures of P4.247 million or 65.41 percent of the total allocation, while the rest were either partially implemented or not implemented at all thus, the objectives/purposes of the plan activities were not fully attained.  (Observation No. 5)

	

We recommended that Management (a) ensure compliance with pertinent provisions of the GAA and the Magna Carta of Women by providing a more feasible GAD Plan to address the issues and concerns of  intended clientele thus, achieving gender equality and women empowerment goals, and establish framework that enables CESB to monitor  full implementation  all GAD-related activities; and (b) efficiently and effectively utilize the amount allocated to GAD mainstreamed in the programs/projects/activities of the agency.



3)	Cash advances for special projects amounting to P315,400.00 were not liquidated as soon as the purpose for which these were granted have been served which is not in accordance with the existing rules and regulations. Likewise, additional cash advances of P66,750.00 were granted to the AO even if previous cash advances were not settled/ liquidated. (Observation No. 1)

	

We recommended that Management (a) require the Accountable Officer    concerned    to    liquidate    her   cash advances so that proper accounting could be made thereof to ensure fairness of accounts presentation in the Financial Statements; and (b) instruct the Accountant to issue certification that previous cash advances have been liquidated and accounted for in the books before granting a new cash advance and closely monitor the liquidation of cash advances granted to AOs within the prescribed period. 

	

4)	Due to non-submission of monthly financial reports, supporting schedules and corresponding supporting documents to the COA Auditor’s Office within the deadlines set by existing auditing rules and regulations, the Auditor was prevented from conducting timely audit and communicating results to the Management for immediate correction of deficiency/ies noted, if any. (Observation No. 2)

	

We reiterated our previous audit recommendation for Management to instruct/direct the Chief Accountant and other concerned personnel to submit  (a) regularly the disbursement records with all the paid vouchers, Report of Collections and Deposits with supporting documents evidencing the transaction to the Audit Team within 10 days from date of receipt of said documents in compliance with Section 6.05 of COA Circular No. 95-006 dated May 18, 1995; and (b)  the Trial Balance within 10 days after the end of each month.
