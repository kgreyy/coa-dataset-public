COMMISSION ON AUDIT 

 Commonwealth Avenue, Quezon City 
 
 

 
May 12, 2021 

 
Atty. AGNES VICENTA S. TORRES-DEVANADERA 
Chairperson 
Energy Regulatory Commission 
16th Floor, Pacific Center Building 
San Miguel Avenue, Pasig City 
 
Dear Chairperson Devanadera: 
 
 

Management Letter (ML) on the Audit of the 
Energy Regulatory Commission 

For the Calendar Year (CY) ended December 31, 2020 
 
1. Pursuant to Section 2, Article IX-D of the Constitution of the Philippines and 
Section 43 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 or the Government Auditing Code of the 
Philippines, we have audited the accounts and operations of the Energy Regulatory 
Commission (ERC) for the year ended December 31, 2020.  The audit was conducted with 
applicable legal and regulatory requirements, and the International Standards of Supreme 
Audit Institutions (ISSAIs).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to 
obtain a reasonable basis for our conclusions. 
 
2. The audit was conducted to: (a) determine the propriety of transactions as well as 
the extent of compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations; (b) recommend 
agency improvement opportunities; and (c) determine the extent of implementation of prior 
year s audit recommendations. 
 
3. Deficiencies observed in the course of the audit were earlier communicated through 
Audit Observation Memoranda (AOMs).  Due to limitations in the holding of gatherings 
during Modified Enhanced Community Quarantine (MECQ) in Metro Manila, as a 
measure in fighting against the spread of Coronavirus Disease (COVID) 19, the Summary 
of Audit Observations and Recommendations (SAOR) was issued to Management on 
May 7, 2021 in lieu of the conduct of physical actual Exit Conference.  Management 
comments on the SAOR and the replies to AOMs previously issued were incorporated in 
this Management Letter, where appropriate. 

 
4. As of audit date, the ERC has not submitted to the Audit Team the financial 
statements for the period January 1 to December 31, 2020; hence, we are issuing this 
Management Letter in lieu of the Annual Audit Report.

I. Introduction 
 

5. The Energy Regulatory Commission was created pursuant to Section 38 of 

its place, created the ERC which is a purely independent regulatory body performing the 
combined quasi-judicial, quasi-legislative and administrative functions in the electric 
power industry. 
 
6. The mandate of the ERC pursuant to EPIRA is to promote competition, encourage 
market development, ensure customer choice, discourage/penalize abuse of market power 
in the restructured electricity industry and enforce the implementing rules and regulations 
of the aforesaid Act. 
  
7. The ERC has a total of 285 regular/permanent and 118 job order/contractual 
personnel.  It is headed by a Chairperson and Chief Executive Officer and assisted               
by: (a) four (4) Commissioners, who are all presidential appointees; (b) one (1) Executive 
Director, who heads the Office of the Executive Director which is primarily in charge of 
the execution and implementation of policies, decisions and orders approved by the 
Commission; and (c) seven (7) Directors of its operating offices/services, as follows:  
  

 Office of the General Counsel and Secretariat (OGCS); 
 Financial and Administrative Service (FAS); 
 Market Operations Service (MOS); 
 Legal Service (LS); 
 Consumer Affairs Service (CAS); 
 Regulatory Operations Service (ROS); and 
 Planning and Public Information Service (PPIS). 

  
8. For CY 2020, the ERC has total appropriations of P1,090,380,389.00 consisting of 
the authorized appropriations under the General Appropriations Act (GAA) of 
P794,035,252.00, automatic appropriations of P85,981,697.00 and continuing 
appropriations of P210,363,440.00.  It received allotments aggregating P760,826,817.00, 
of which, P583,549,704.00 was obligated, leaving an unobligated balance of 
P177,277,113.00 as at year-end. 
 
9. The  
  

Unit of Measure Target Accomplishment Variance 
Outcome Indicators    
1. Percentage of Power Supply Agreement (PSA) 

cases with prayer for provisional authority acted 
upon within 75 days from filing. 

82.00% 95.24% 13.24% 

2. Percentage of documents for external cases filed 
within the reglementary period. 

80.00% 50.00% (30.00%) 

3. Percentage of violators issued with Show Cause 
Order (SCO) within 45 days from the discovery of 

98.00% 100.00% 2.00% 



3

Unit of Measure Target Accomplishment Variance 
violation of rules relative to Certificate of 
Compliance (COC) and Retail Electricity 
Suppliers (RES). 

Output Indicators    
1. Percentage of applications for COC acted upon 

within 50 days from receipt of complete 
requirements. 

98.00% 73.54% (24.46%) 

2. Number of audits conducted on sites and facilities 
(subjected to rate audits and regulatory visits). 

836 1,617 781 

3. Percentage of consumer related cases 
resolved/decided within 60 days from the time the 
case was submitted for resolution. 

70.00% 66.67% (3.33%) 

4. Percentage of non-consumer related cases 
resolved/decided within 90 days from the time the 
case was submitted for resolution. 

60.00% 97.92% 37.92% 

5. Number of rules and resolutions promulgated. 14 12 (2) 
6. Number of new watt-hour meters tested and 

calibrated. 
2,197,492.00 1,867,053.00 (330,439.00) 

 
10. The above negative variances were due to the following:  

 
 Outcome Indicator No. 2 (-30.00 percent variance).  The 50.00 percent 

accomplishment (below target of 80.00 percent) on the percentage of documents 
for external cases filed within the reglementary period was due to delay in the 
filing caused by the lockdown and quarantine measures observed by the ERC, 
coupled by the closure of the Philippine Postal Office in relation to service of the 
pleading to other parties. 

 
 Output Indicator No. 1 (-24.46 percent variance).  The 73.54 percent 

accomplishment (below target of 98.00 percent) on the percentage of 
applications for COC acted upon was due to the imposition of Enhanced 
Community Quarantine (ECQ), several community quarantines, ERC 
lockdown, State of National Emergency declaration and ERC Advisory dated 
March 17, 2020 indicating that COCs/PAOs expiring during the quarantine 
period are extended for sixty (60) days from April 14, 2020, among others. 

 
 Output Indicator No. 3 (-3.33 percent variance).  On the 66.67 percent 

accomplishment (below target of 70.00 percent) on the percentage of consumer 
related cases resolved, the ERC was supposed to achieve three (3) out of three 
(3) or 100.00 percent for the indicator but the Order was not released for one 
(1) case due to Presidential Proclamation No. 929, s. 2020 imposing an ECQ. 

 
 Output Indicator No. 5 (-2 variance).  On the number of rules and resolutions 

promulgated, the ERC promulgated only 12 rules and resolutions which is short 
of its target of 14 rules and resolutions.  The ERC-MOS justified, among others, 
that in CY 2020, it was manned by four (4) personnel only.  Given that there 
are several rules that need to be developed, prioritization was made.  Most 
importantly, there was a set-back in the work schedule of the MOS due to the 



4

declaration of Community Quarantine and the adjustment to the alternative 
work arrangement. 

 
 Output Indicator No. 6 (-330,439 variance).  On the number of new watt-hour 

meters tested and calibrated, the ERC tested and calibrated only 1,867,053 watt-
hour meters which is below its target of 2,197,492 watt-hour meters.  This came 
about when the ERC was not able to continue its meter testing and calibration 
activities due to Presidential Proclamation No. 929, s. 2020 imposing ECQ and 
Executive Order No. 112 imposing a General Community Quarantine (GCQ) 
within the National Capital Region and ECQ in High Risk Geographic Areas in the 
Philippines. 

 
 

II.  Observations and Recommendations 
 
Non-submission of the CY 2020 Financial Statements, Trial Balances and Supporting 
Schedules within the prescribed period 
 
11. The ERC failed to submit its CY 2020 financial statements, trial balances and 
supporting schedules contrary to Sections 41(2) and 122(1) of PD No. 1445 and 
Section 60, Chapter 19, Volume I of the Government Accounting Manual for National 
Government Agencies (GAM for NGAs).  
 
12. Section 41.2 of PD No. 1445 provides that:  

 
 To carry out the purposes of this section, the chief accountant or the official in charge of 
keeping the accounts of a government agency shall submit to the Commission year-end 
trial balances and such other supporting or subsidiary statements as may be required by 
the Commission not later than the fourteenth day of February  
 

13. Section 122.1 of PD No. 1445 further provides that: 
 

  
regulations issued by it require the agency heads, chief accountants, budget officers, 
cashiers, disbursing officers, administrative or personnel officers, and other responsible 
officials of the various agencies to submit trial balances, physical inventory reports, 
current plantilla of personnel, and such other reports as may be necessary for the exercise 
of its functions  

 
14. In view of the above authority, COA promulgated the GAM for NGAs which, 
among others, requires the submission of documents and financial reports to COA within 
a prescribed timeline to enable the timely conduct of post audit of transactions and 
periodic/annual evaluation on the assertions relating to transactions and account balances 
reflected in the books. Accordingly, Section 60, Chapter 19, Volume I of GAM for NGAs 
requires Central/Head/Main Offices of all NGAs to prepare and submit the following 
Financial Statements (FSs) and schedules within the prescribed deadline:

15. Verification of records of documents received from Management revealed that as 
of audit date, the CY 2020 Year-end Financial Statements with corresponding CY 
2019 balances, consisting of the Statement of Financial Position, Statement of Financial 
Performance, Statement of Changes in Net Assets/Equity, Statement of Cash Flow, 
Statement of Comparison of Budget and Actual Amount and the Notes to Financial 
Statements comprising a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory 
notes, were not yet submitted to COA despite several follow-ups made. Except for January 
2020 Trial Balance (which was received only on March 3, 2021), other monthly/quarterly 
trial balances and supporting schedules were also not submitted.  
 
16. Consequently, the non-availability of the required financial reports hampered the 
timely and complete audit/review and evaluation of the financial transactions and account 
balances of the agency.  
 
17. We recommended that Management submit to COA the CY FSs, trial balances 
and supporting schedules to enable the latter to fully execute the financial audit and 
render an audit opinion on the fairness of presentation on the . 
 
18. In a letter dated March 8, 2021, Management commented that the Corona Virus 
Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic greatly affected the operations of the ERC especially 
the Financial and Administrative Service-Accounting Division (FAS-AD), where the 
nature of work, such as documentation, recording, vouching, filing and preparation of 
monthly, quarterly and year-end financial reports are needed to be done on-site.  Pursuant 
to Memorandum Circular (MC) No. 10, Series of 2020 issued by the Civil Service 
Commission (CSC) on Alternative Work Arrangements, the ERC adopted a combination 
of Skeleton Workforce and Work-from-Home work arrangements to comply with the 
social distancing and health protocols to ensure the safety of all its employees and officials.  
The limited office space of the ERC resulted in a limited number of staff that can be 
authorized to report to the office.  In addition to this, the ERC on many instances, declared 
total lockdown of its entire office to give way to the conduct of disinfection due to COVID-
19 positive cases and exposures.  Further, all staff under the FAS were mandatorily 
required to undergo home quarantine and to work-from-home as the whole FAS office was 
forced into a 2-week lockdown from March 5, 2021 to March 19, 2021 considering that 
one (1) of its employees tested positive for COVID-19. 
 
19. Management pointed out that the above-mentioned circumstances contributed 

inability to submit on time the CY 2020 Financial Statements and 
supporting schedules pursuant to Section 60, Chapter 19, Volume I of GAM for NGAs.

20. Management, however, assured that the ERC is doing its best to comply 
immediately and diligently with COA requirements.  To facilitate prompt and immediate 
preparation of the required reports, the ERC had recently filled-up the vacant position of 
the Chief Accountant of the FAS-AD, who had her mandatory retirement last June 2020, 
by appointing the incumbent Financial and Management Officer II. Moreover, the ERC 
recently designated an Officer-in-Charge Director of the FAS.  Both the Chief Accountant 
and the OIC-Director assumed office last March 1, 2021. 

 
21. Considering that the COVID-19 pandemic is not yet over, and with the limited 
workforce that can be allowed to physically report to the office, Management requested for 
an extension to submit the CY 2020 Year-End Financial Reports and its corresponding 
schedules until May 14, 2021. Accordingly, the following circumstances continue to 
hamper the operations of the FAS-AD:   
 

 March 14  Disinfection activity was conducted for the whole 14th Floor where 
the FAS office is located since one (1) of the employees tested positive for 
COVID-19. 

 March 19  The ERC was on lockdown to give way for another disinfection 
activity since another employee tested positive for COVID-19 last March 18. 

 March 22-26  The whole FAS-AD team was advised to undergo the mandatory 
self/home quarantine considering that all of the team members were identified 
as part of the contract tracing scheme due to exposure in relation to the above 
incident. 

 March 27-29  Two (2) key employees of AD team were again advised to 
continue to undergo the mandatory self/home quarantine considering that both 
were identified as part of the contact tracing scheme due to exposure to another 
COVID-19 case. 

 March 29 to present  declaration of ECQ in Metro Manila and its four (4) 
surrounding provinces namely, Rizal, Cavite, Laguna and Bulacan, which 
resulted in limited workforce of physically reporting in the Office. 

 April 1-2  These are official holidays in observance of the Holy Week. 
 
22. As of report date, the ERC has not yet submitted the CY 2020 Financial Statements, 
trial balances and supporting schedules, hence, the issuance of this Management Letter in 
lieu of the AAR. 
 

  
Compliance Audit 
 
Delayed submission of CY 2020 Financial Reports 
 
23. Financial reports with their supporting documents were not submitted to the 
Audit Team within the required period or were delayed by 23 days to 1 year and 63 
days which prevented the timely conduct of audit and evaluation of financial accounts 
and transactions.

24. Pursuant to Section 122 of PD No. 1445, the Commission may, whenever deemed 
necessary in the exigencies of the service and under regulations issued by it, require the 
agency heads, chief accountants, budget officers, cashiers, disbursing officers, 
administrative or personnel officers, and other responsible officials of the various agencies 
to submit trial balances, physical inventory reports, current plantilla of personnel, and such 
other reports as may be necessary for the exercise of its functions. 
 
25. In view of the above authority, COA promulgated the GAM for NGAs which, 
among others, requires the submission of documents and financial reports to COA within 
a prescribed timeline to enable the timely conduct of post audit of transactions and periodic/ 
annual evaluation on the assertions relating to transactions and account balances reflected 
in the books. 
 
26. Verification of records of documents received from Management revealed the 
significant number of days delayed ranging 23 days to 1 year and 63 days in the submission 
of various CY 2020 financial reports and documents vis-à-vis the respective prescribed 
timelines, as presented in the table.

27. The timely submission of the foregoing financial reports and supporting documents 
by Management to COA within the prescribed timeline is necessary to promptly conduct 
the 
transactions.  In this manner, fraud and errors, if any, be timely detected and 
implementation of corrective measures and other appropriate actions to address the 
discovered deficiencies is facilitated. 
 
28. We wish to remind that paragraphs 2 and 3 of Section 122 of PD No. 1445 provide 
that: 

 
(2) Failure on the part of the officials concerned to submit the documents and reports 

mentioned herein shall automatically cause the suspension of payment of their salaries 
until they shall have complied with the requirements of the Commission.

(3) No appropriation authorized in the General Appropriations Act shall be available to 
pay the salary or any official or employee who violates the provisions of this section, 
without prejudice to any disciplinary action that may be instituted against such official or 
employee.  

 
29. We recommended that Management comply with the prescribed periods of 
submission of financial reports, complete with relevant supporting documents 
required under the provisions of GAM for NGAs, to enable COA to fully execute its 
review, evaluation and audit functions and to avoid the issuance of Notice of 
Suspension and imposition of sanctions provided under paragraphs 2 and 3 of Section 
122 of PD No. 1445.  
 
30. On March 17, 2021, Management already submitted the required financial reports 
and documents except for the JEVs from February to December 2020 and the BRS for four 
(4) active bank accounts. 

 
 

Low Budget and Cash Utilization  
 
31. As authorized under RA No. 11465 or the GAA for Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 and 
as directed under RA No. 11469 or the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act, the ERC 
received a total allotment of P760,826,817.00, 76.70 percent or P583,549,704.00 of 
which were obligated, leaving an unobligated balance of 23.30 percent or 
P177,277,113.00 as at December 31, 2020. Of the obligated amount, only 79.56 percent 
or P464,254,347.00 were disbursed, leaving an unpaid obligation of 20.44 percent or 
P119,295,357.00 at year-end. Likewise, of the total cash allocations of P559,377,286.00 
received during the year, P499,914,536.34 was utilized and the balance of 
P59,462,749.66 remained unutilized and was reverted to the Bureau of the Treasury. 
 
32. Section 60 of the General Provisions of RA No. 11465 provides that all 
appropriations authorized in the said Act, including budgetary support to GOCCs, shall be 
available for release and disbursement for the purpose specified, and under the same 
general and special provisions applicable thereto, until December 31, 2020.  

 
33. Specifically, the guidelines on the release of funds for FY 2020 under paragraph 
3.4 of National Budget Circular (NBC) No. 578 dated January 6, 2020 provides that all 
appropriations authorized under the FY 2020 GAA, shall be valid for release and 
disbursement for the purpose specified, and under the same General and Special Provisions 
of said GAA applicable thereto until December 31, 2020.  
 
34. Further, RA No. 11469 or the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act enacted on March 24, 
2020, authorized the President to exercise powers to adopt certain emergency measures to 
respond to crisis brought by the pandemic, amongst which is to direct the discontinuance 
of appropriated programs, projects or activities of any agency of the Executive Department, 
in the FYs 2019 and 2020 GAAs, including unreleased appropriations and unobligated 
released allotments.  Relative thereto, NBC No. 580 dated April 22, 2020 was issued for 



9

the adoption of economy measures in the government due to the emergency health 
situation.  
 
35. On December 29, 2020, RA No. 11520 was enacted amending Section 60 of the 
General Provisions of RA No. 11465 which extended until December 31, 2021 the 
availability for release and disbursement of all appropriations authorized under the FY 
2020 GAA.  
 
36. Also, paragraph 4.2.2.2 of the NBC No. 578 provides that Notice of Cash 
Allocations (NCAs) issued and credited to Regular Modified Disbursement System (MDS) 
Sub-accounts of agencies/operating units for their regular operations, retirement 
gratuity/terminal leave benefits, foreign loans/grants and accounts payable shall be valid 
until the last working day of the 3rd month of the quarter.  
 
37. Review of appropriations, allotments and obligations reported in the Budget and 
Financial Accountability Reports (BFARs) of the ERC as of December 31, 2020 disclosed 
that of the total authorized appropriation amounting P1,090,380,389.00, the agency 
received allotments totaling P760,826,817.00.  
 
38. Out of the total allotment received as available for spending, P583,549,704.00 or 
76.70 percent was obligated, leaving an unobligated allotment/unutilized funds of 
P177,277,113.00 wherein only the current year regular agency fund amounting to 
P74,017,839.00 has been extended up to December 31, 2021. Correspondingly, out of the 
said total obligated amount, the ERC disbursed P464,254,347 or 79.56 percent, leaving an 
unpaid obligation of P119,295,357.00 or 20.44 percent of the obligated amount as at year-
end. Details are as follows:

disclosed that P56,805,658.00 or 32.04 percent of the total unobligated balance pertains to 
allotments that are either totally unutilized or utilized at less than 30.00 percent rate, 
majority of which are related to programs and projects for Information and Technology 
(IT) equipment, software, services, and repairs that may enhance the adaptability and 
digital readiness of the ERC to the new normal. Details are shown below:

40. Furthermore, verification of the utilization of NCAs for FY 2020 disclosed that of 
the total NCAs received by the ERC amounting to P559,377,286.00, 10.63 percent or 
P59,462,749.66 were not utilized and reverted to the Bureau of the Treasury. Details are as 
follows:

41. Based on the foregoing, it is apparent that the ERC has not fully utilized its budget 
during the year and was unable to maximize the use of its available funds and cash 
allocations resulting in the expiration of its unutilized funds/allocations and deferment of 
the intended benefits that could be derived from these resources.  
 
42. However, despite the situation brought by the COVID-19, the ERC has improved 
its overall budget utilization rate of 76.70 percent for FY 2020 as compared to prior year 
utilization rate of 69.74 percent.  

 
43. We recommended that Management maximize the spending of budget 
programmed in its appropriation through efficient and timely implementation of 
programs, activities and projects to optimize fund utilization, maximize the intended 
benefits from the resources of the government and avoid expiration and reversion of 
unobligated allotment and unused cash allocations.  
 
44. Management took note of the observations and recommendations and informed that 
the COVID-19 pandemic greatly affected the operations of the ERC particularly the 
spending of budget for programmed activities for FY 2020.  Management noted however, 
that through the continuing efforts of the Commission to address the challenges posed by 
the pandemic, the ERC implemented the Alternative Work Arrangements pursuant to MC 
10, series of 2020 issued by the CSC and adopted a combination of Skeleton Workforce 
and Work-from-Home work arrangements to enable them to perform and deliver their 
mandate since the start of the lockdown in March 2020.  Records reveal that despite the 
pandemic, the ERC was able to implement its planned programs, projects and activities 
(P/A/Ps) for FY 2020 which resulted in a higher overall budget utilization rate of 76.70 
percent as compared to FY 2 . 
 
45. The ERC is committed to continue exerting efforts in order to maximize the budget 
appropriations through the timely implementation of the P/A/Ps to avoid expiration and 
reversion of unobligated allotment, and will strictly comply with all the provisions 
implemented by the DBM and COA.

Lapses in Reporting of BFARs 
 
46. The revision of the Budget and Financial Accountability Reports 
(BFARs) as of December 31, 2020 correcting the reported incurrence of overdraft of 
P7,564,991.00 contrary to Section 38, Chapter 1 of the GAM for NGAs indicates 

on the Unified Reporting System which could 
affect the propriety of succeeding reports holding Agency officials liable therefor. 
 
47. Section 38, Chapter 1 of the GAM for NGAs provides: 

 
  Heads of departments, bureaus, offices and agencies shall not incur nor authorize the 
incurrence of expenditures or obligations in excess of allotments released by the DBM 
Secretary for their respective departments, offices and agencies. Parties responsible for 
the incurrence of overdrafts shall be held personally liable therefor. (Book VI, Chapter 5, 
Section 41 of EO No. 292)
not incur nor authorize the incurrence of expenditures or obligations in excess of 
allotments released by the DBM Secretary for their respective departments, offices and 
agencies. Parties responsible for the incurrence of overdrafts shall be held personally 

 
 

48. Review of obligations and disbursements reported in the BFARs of the ERC as of 
December 31, 2020 disclosed that the Commission has incurred overdraft totaling 
P7,564,991.00 which may indicate expenditures incurred that are not within the authorized 
appropriations/ allotments. Of the obligated amount of P27,171,307.00, a total of 
P13,581,496.00 was already disbursed. Details are shown below:

49. The Budget Division informed the Audit Team that they already revised the BFARs 
of the ERC for the period ended December 31, 2020 in the DBM Unified Reporting System 
(URS) reflecting the appropriate amount per object of expenditures. 
 
50. Management submitted to the Audit Team their justifications and revised the BFAR 
documents for reference. The Audit Team verified/validated the revised BFARs and noted 
the following proper adjustments made:    
 

a. Revised FAR1A  Current Appropriation for FY 2020 to reflect the adjustments 
made in the ICT Equipment.  The modifications were made due to inadvertent 
posting of obligation to ICT Equipment Outlay instead of Communication 
Equipment amounting to P5,589,788.00, both under Machinery and Equipment 
Outlay. 



13

 
b. Revised FAR1A  Continuing Appropriation for FY 2019 to reflect the adjustments 

made in Other Professional Services.  A review on the realignments made under 
Other Professional Services revealed that P806,487.00 was inadvertently posted 
under Professional Services which resulted in an understatement of the allotment 
for the Other Professional Services.  Further, obligations made both under 
Professional Services and Other Professional Service also revealed that there were 
two (2) obligations amounting to P3,480,000.00 which were inadvertently posted 
under Other Professional Services instead of Professional Services.

52. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Budget Division to 
observe prudence in its process of the Unified Reporting System to correctly capture 
the appropriate amounts per object of expenditure for proper reporting in the BFARs 
and avoid further corrections/revisions thereon.  

 
 

Non-compliance with the Internal Auditing Standards for the Philippine Public Sector 
(IASPPS) 
 
53. The existing ERC Internal Audit Division (IAD) could not be considered fully 
operational since it does not have a duly approved Internal Audit Charter and 
Internal Audit policies and procedures required under Internal Auditing Standards 
for the Philippine Public Sector (IASPPS) Standards 1000, 1010, and 2040.  



14

Moreover, the non-designation of Point Persons for each Division/Service constitutes 
interference in the performance of internal audit work under IASPPS Standard 
1110.1 in relation to Standards 2020 and 2030. 
 
54. Section 124 of PD No. 1445 provides that it shall be the direct responsibility of the 
agency head to install, implement, and monitor a sound system of internal control. 
 
55. In accordance with the policies on the establishment of an Internal Audit Service 
(IAS) under RA No. 4177 or the Internal Auditing Act of 1962, Administrative Order (AO) 
No. 278, series (s) 1992 and AO No. 70 s. 2003, all heads of the government departments 
and offices concerned, Government-Owned-and-Controlled Corporations (GOCCs), 
including Government Financial Institutions (GFIs), State Universities and Colleges 
(SUCs), and Local Government Units (LGUs) are mandated to organize an IAS to 
strengthen internal control system in their respective offices. 

 
56. Relative thereto, a study and review of the provisions of the International 
Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions Guidance for Good Governance (INTOSAI 
GOV), Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) 
Internal Control-Integrated Framework (ICIF), National Guidelines on Internal Control 
System (NGICS), Philippine Government Internal Audit Manual (PGIAM), International 
Professional Practices Framework (IPPF) promulgated by the Institute of Internal Auditors 
(IIA), and other relevant laws, rules and regulations were conducted, results of which, lead 
to the development and adoption of the Internal Auditing Standards for the Philippine 
Public Sector. 
 
57. The IASPPS provides authoritative guidance essential for the professional practice 
of internal auditing, thereby enhancing the quality and uniformity in internal auditing 
practices by Philippine government agencies. 
 
58. Evaluati
Internal Audit Charter and Internal Audit policies and procedures, and provision of internal 
audit resource requirements, in accordance with the IASPPS disclosed the following: 
 

Audit Observations Recommendations 
a) Lack of Internal Audit Charter and Internal Audit policies and procedures 
Verification disclosed that Internal Audit Charter 
was not yet approved and that IAD has no established Internal 
Audit policies and procedures. 
 
The IASPPS, on the establishment of an Internal Audit 
Charter and Internal Audit policies and procedures, provides: 
 
Standard 1000. Purpose, Authority and Responsibility 
The purpose, authority and responsibility of the internal audit 
service (IAS) must be formally defined in an internal audit 
charter, consistent with the Mission of Internal Audit, the 
Core Principles, the Code of Ethics, the IASSPs, and the 
definition of Internal Auditing.  The head of internal audit 
must periodically review the internal audit charter, present it 

We recommended that Management 
fully operationalize the IAD by:  
 
a) approving its Internal Audit Charter; 
and 
 
b) requiring the IAD to establish 
Internal Audit policies and procedures 
prescribed under the IASPPS, to assist 
the ERC in promoting compliance, 
efficiency, and effectiveness of its 
operations. 



15

Audit Observations Recommendations 
to senior Management, for additional input/enhancement, if 
any, and submit, for approval, to the head of agency or the 
governing body/audit committee. 

 
Standard 1010. Recognizing Guidance in the Internal 
Audit Charter 
The nature of the Core Principles, the Code of Ethics, the 
IASSPs, and the definition of Internal Auditing must be 
reflected in the internal audit charter.  The head of internal 
audit should discuss the mission of Internal Audit and the 
elements of the Philippine Internal Auditing Framework for 
Public Sector with senior management, and the head of the 
agency or the governing body/audit committee. 

 
Standard 2040. Policies and Procedures 
The head of internal audit must establish policies and 
procedures to guide the IAS. 
 
We emphasized that the internal audit charter is vital to 

internal audit will operate and allows the governing body to 

independence.  On the other hand, an audit manual (policies 
and procedures) outlines the authority and scope of the 
internal audit function, documents standards, and provides 
cohesive guidelines and procedures. These guidelines 
promote consistency, stability, continuity, acceptable 
performance standards, and a means of coordinating the 
efforts of audit staff effectively. 
 
b) Internal Audit resource requirements and freedom from interference in the performance of internal 

audit work 
The IASPPS, on internal audit resource requirements, among 
others, provides: 
 
Standard 2020. Communication and Approval of the 
Internal Audit Service Plans 

and resource requirements, including significant interim 
changes, to the senior management for 
enhancements/additional inputs, and to the head of the agency 
or the governing body/audit committee for review and 
approval.  The head of internal audit must also communicate 
the impact of resource limitations. 

 
Standard 2030. Resource Management 
The head of internal audit must ensure that internal audit 
resources are appropriate, sufficient, and effectively 
deployed to achieve the approved plan. 

 
Standard 1110.1 Organizational Independence 
The IAS must be free from interference in determining the 
scope of internal auditing, performing work, and 
communicating results.  The head of internal audit must 
disclose such interference to the head of the agency, or to the 

We commended the ERC for 
immediately addressing the resource 
requirement of IAD in compliance with 
IASPPS.  However, we recommended 
that Management comply with IASPPS 
Standard 1110.1 by designating Point 
Persons (1 Main and 1 Alternate) for 
each Division/Service to free the IAD 
from interference in the performance of 
its internal audit work. 
 



16

Audit Observations Recommendations 
governing body/audit committee, and discuss the 
implications. 
 
The IAD, through its Interim Audit Report dated October 1, 
2020, communicated, among others, the following needed 
resource requirements: 

 
1. The IAD respectfully proposes that Point Persons             

(1 Main and 1 Alternate) be designated for each 
Division/Service so that coordination will be 
straightforward and avert the pointing of staff from one 
to another. 
 

2. th Floor) is currently 

due to insufficient cables, as per MISD.  Thus, printing 
of necessary files and documents is improbable in its 
office, aside from the absence of its own printer/s and 
computer desktops.  

 
Verification disclosed that resource requirement No. 2 above 
was immediately addressed by Management.  The IAD is now 

own printers and computer desktops.  However, resource 
requirement No. 1 on the designation of Internal Audit Point 
Persons for each Division/Service was not yet addressed. 

 
As pointed out in the above Interim Audit Report, the 
designation of Point Persons will facilitate coordination and 
avert the pointing of staff from one to another.   

 
It must be emphasized that the non-designation of Point 
Persons, together with its implications, amounts to 
interference in the performance of internal audit work which 
constitutes non-compliance with Standard 1110.1 of the 
IASPPS as stated above. 
 
 
59. Management commented that its IAD has completed the preparation of the noted 
deficiencies, particularly the following: (1) Internal Audit Charter; (2) Internal Audit 
Policies and Procedures Manual; and (3) Designated Point Persons for each 
Division/Service.   
 
60. However, the said documents would still be reviewed and scheduled for the 

Internal Audit documents by the 2nd Quarter of 2021.  Management further assured that 
its IAD will adhere to the IASPPS and to the other requirements of COA.

Audit of Government Property Insurance 
 
61. The ERC substantially complied with the provisions RA No. 656, otherwise 

insurable risks with the General Insurance Fund of Government Service Insurance 
System (GSIS), except for the two (2) newly acquired motor vehicles which are not 
covered by a comprehensive insurance. 
 
62. In order to indemnify or compensate the Government for any damage to, or loss of, 
its properties due to fire, earthquake, storm, or other casualty, RA No. 656 otherwise known 

required every government, except municipal government below first class to insure its 
properties with the Fund against any insurable risk. 
 
63. Relative thereto, Administrative Order No. 33 dated August 25, 1987 was issued 
directing all heads of government agencies and their subsidiaries to secure from the General 
Insurance Fund (GIF) directly, all insurances or bonds covering properties, contracts, rights 
of action and other insurable risks and all those in which they have an insurable interest 
only. 
 
64. Evaluation of PPE insurance policies submitted by the ERC disclosed the 
following:

b) For Motor Vehicles - The 30 motor vehicles of the ERC with aggregate value 
of P49,495,856.05 were fully covered by Compulsory Third-Party Liability 
(CTPL). However, the two (2) motor vehicles that were newly acquired in CY 
2020 were not covered by a comprehensive insurance. Details are shown below:

65. Consequently, for the above unsecured motor vehicles, the government is at risk of 
being unprotected against incurrence of financial losses due to physical damage, bodily 
injury resulting from vehicle collision, theft, fire, or any damage that may arise from 
incidents in a vehicle. 
 
66. We commended the ERC for its substantial compliance with the provisions on 
property insurance under RA No. 656 and Administrative Order No. 33. However, 
we recommended that Management strictly monitor the insurance policies for all of 
its motor vehicles to ensure full coverage of ERC against vehicle-related insurable 
risks during the year. 
 
67. Management took note of the observations and recommendation and informed that 
as of March 10, 2021 the two (2) units of Yutong Bus were already covered by 
Comprehensive Insurance with the GSIS.  The Commission assured that it will strictly 
comply with all the provisions on property insurance under RA No. 656 and Administrative 
Order No. 33.  Further, the General Services Division (GSD) of the FAS committed to 

same are fully covered against any insurable risks for vehicle related accidents. 
 
 
Senior Citizens and Persons with Disability 

 
68. There were no submitted plans, programs and projects specifying the 
projected number of beneficiaries, timelines of implementation and allocated funds 
for CY 2020. Likewise, the ERC was not able to conduct/ implement any programs 
and activities intended to address the concerns of senior citizens (SCs) and persons 
with disability (PWDs) contrary to Section 32 of the General Provisions of the GAA 
for FY 2020. 
 
69. Section 32 of the General Provisions of GAA for FY 2020 requires that all agencies 
of the government shall formulate plans, programs and projects intended to address the 
concerns of senior citizens and persons with disability, insofar as it relates to their 
mandated function, and integrate the same in their regular activities. Moreover, all 
government infrastructures and facilities shall provide architectural or structural features, 



19

designs or facilities that will reasonably enhance the mobility, safety and welfare of persons 
with disability pursuant to Batas Pambansa Blg. 344 and RA No. 7277, as amended. 
 
70. 
for CY 2020, ERC did not undertake programs/ activities intended to address the concerns 
and welfares of senior citizens and persons with disability. 
 
71. Submitted Accomplishment Report of Financial and Administrative Service-
Human Resource Management Division (FAS-HRMD) dated February 11, 2021 disclosed 

 the said program was not conducted due to the COVID-
19   pandemic. Likewise, the plans and budget of the said program specifying the projected 
number of beneficiaries, timelines of implementation and allocated funds was not 
submitted to the Audit Team. 
 
72. We recommended that Management: 
 

a) endeavor to integrate specific plans and programs intended to address the 
concerns of senior citizens and persons with disability in its regular 
activities and in relation to its mandated functions pursuant to the specific 
provisions of the GAA of the ensuing year and ensure submission of such 
to the Office of the Auditor; and 

  
b) amidst the situation brought by COVID-19 pandemic, endeavor to adapt 

 
 

73. Management commented that the COVID-19 pandemic greatly affected the 
operations of the ERC and hampered the implementation of the plans and programs of the 
FAS-HRMD which include among others, the conduct of a wellness activity for Senior 
Citizens and Persons with Disability. 
 
74. In the meantime, Management informed that the FAS-HRMD has targeted the 
conduct of an upcoming Information Dissemination Campaign for the SCs and PWDs to 
be conducted via videoconferencing using the Zoom or MSTeams applications to the SCs 
and PWDs of the country, where such means is feasible, as end-users of electricity, by the 
second quarter of 2021.  This activity was part of the FAS-HRMD targets for 2020, 
however, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this activity was moved to 2021.  The FAS-
HRMD shall submit the detailed plans and programs and the corresponding budget to be 
used in relation to the said activity once approved by the Commission.  
 
75. Management assured that it will strictly comply with Section 32 of the General 
Provisions of the GAA for FY 2020 which requires that all agencies of the government 
shall formulate plans, programs and projects intended to address the concerns of SCs and 
PWDs, insofar as it relates to the mandated functions of the ERC, and integrate the same 
in their regular activities.

Gender and Development 
 

76. ERC was not able to comply with the minimum 5.00% requirement set by law for 
its GAD Plan and Budget (GPB), as it only allocated P24,479,724.00 or 3.08% of their 
FY 2020 adjusted appropriation of P794,035,252.00 contrary to Section 31 of Republic 
Act (R.A.) No. 11465 or the General Appropriations Act (GAA) of FY 2020 and Section 
36(a) of R.A. No. 9710 otherwise known as the Magna Carta of Women (MCW) in 
relation to Section 4.3 of Philippine Commission on Women (PCW) Memorandum 
Circular (MC) No. 2020-03.  Moreover, the ERC FY 2020 GPB was not submitted to the 
PCW contrary to PCW MC No. 2019-02 dated August 1, 2019.  Likewise, evaluation on 
the implementation and utilization of GPB could not be conducted since the FY 2020 
GAD AR was not submitted to the COA Audit Team contrary to Section 7.0 of PCW MC 
No. 2021-01, as amended by Section 3.0 of PCW MC No. 2021-03.  Furthermore, there 
is no existing GAD database, containing gender statistics and sex-disaggregated data, 
available for gender analysis contrary to Section 36(c), Chapter VI, R.A. No. 9710 or the 
Magna Carta of Women. 
 
77. Evaluation of Management plans, programs, projects and activities for Fiscal 
Year (FY) 2020 relative to Gender and Development (GAD) disclosed the following: 

 
Audit Observations Recommendations 

a) Failure to comply with the 5.00% minimum requirement set by law 

Section 31 of R.A. No. 11465 or the GAA of FY 
2020 provides, among others, that the GAD Plan 
shall be integrated in the regular activities of the 
agencies, which shall be at least five percent (5%) 
of their budgets.  Moreover, Section 36(a) of R.A. 
No. 9710 otherwise known as the Magna Carta of 
Women specifies that the total budget 
appropriation be the basis in the computation of 
the minimum 5.00% GAD budget, to wit:  
 

programs shall be the agency's or the local 
government unit's GAD budget which shall 
be at least five percent (5%) of the agency's 
or the local government unit's total budget 
appropriations (emphasis ours) 

 
Relative thereto and in order to address the 
COVID 19 pandemic, National Budget Circular 
No. 580, dated 22 April 2020, provided measures 
for the discontinuance of appropriated programs, 
activities and projects (PAPs).  Corollary, PCW 
issued MC No. 2020-03 dated April 27, 2020 for 
the adjustment of the FY 2020 GPB in view of the 
Coronavirus Disease 2019 situation.  Section 4.3 
of the said PCW MC No. 2020-03 specified that 

We recommended that Management direct the 
ERC GAD Focal Point System (GFPS) to 
a
total budget appropriation; and aside from 
implementing direct GAD PAPs, it may 

major programs or projects to the GAD budget 
using the HGDG tool to comply with the 
minimum 5% GAD budget provision.  
 



21

the computation of the minimum five percent 
(5%) GAD budget as provided under Section 
36(a) of the MCW shall be based on the total 
adjusted budget of the agency following 
National Budget Circular No. 580. 
 
Evaluation of the ERC FY 2020 GPB vis-à-vis 
Statement of Appropriations, Allotments, 
Obligations, Disbursements and Balances (FAR 
No. 1) as of December 31, 2020 disclosed that 
ERC used its adjusted allotment of 
P481,497,000.00 (exact amount is 
P481,497,252.00) instead of its adjusted 
appropriation of P794,035,252.00 in determining 
whether its allocated GAD budget is at least of the 
required 5.00% minimum.  
 
As a result, ERC only allocated P24,479,724.00 
or 3.08% of its FY 2020 adjusted appropriation of 
P794,035,252.00.  This is way below 
P39,701,762.60 (P794,035,252 x 5%) or the 5% 
minimum requirement of the law. 
 
To comply with the minimum 5% GAD budget 
provision, agencies are highly encouraged to use 
the Harmonized Gender and Development 
Guidelines (HGDG) tool.1  Aside from 
implementing direct GAD PAPs to address 
organization- or client-focused gender issues or 
GAD mandates, agencies may attribute a portion 

programs or projects to the GAD budget using the 
HGDG tool.  Assessing major programs/project 
using the HGDG tool enables the agency to 
identify strengths and areas for improvement to 
gradually increase the gender-responsiveness of 
its program/ project.2 

 
b) Failure to submit ERC FY 2020 GPB to PCW, and ERC FY 2020 GAD AR to COA 

Section 4.0 of PCW MC No. 2019-02 dated 
August 1, 2019 set the deadline of the executive 
departments, attached agencies/bureaus, 
constitutional bodies, judicial and legislative 
bodies, Office of the President/Vice President and 
other executive offices for the encoding and 
submission to PCW of FY 2020 GPBs through 
Gender Mainstreaming Monitoring System 
(GMMS) on September 16, 2019.  

We recommended that Management direct the 
ERC GFPS to submit henceforth the GPB to 
PCW and the GAD AR to the COA Audit Team 
by strictly observing the set deadline for GPB 
and GAD AR encoding and submission in the 
GMMS per PCW issued memorandum 
circulars, including submission of replies/ 
comments and necessary revisions as required 
by PCW. 

1 Section 4.6 of PCW MC No. 2020-03 
2 Section 1.2.3.2.1 of PCW MC No. 2019-02 



22

 
Moreover, Section 7.0 of PCW MC No. 2021-01 
dated January 20, 2021, as amended by Section 
3.0 of PCW MC No. 2021-03 dated March 15, 
2021, stated that FY 2020 GAD ARs submitted to 
PCW shall print the GAD AR for signature of 
their agency head and submit signed copies to 
PCW and their respective COA Audit Team. 
 
Verification of the documents submitted to this 
Office disclosed that ERC failed to submit its FY 
2020 GPB to PCW for its review and 
endorsement. Likewise, ERC failed to submit a 
signed copy of its FY 2020 GAD AR3 to the COA 
Audit Team. 
 
It must be emphasized that a GPB reviewed and 
endorsed by PCW (if agency complies with all the 
requested revisions in the GPB within the 
prescribed deadline)4 ensures the alignment of an 

and/or other related GAD laws, and the 
correctness and alignment of the entries in each 
column of the GPB template/form, e.g. if the 
proposed activities respond to the identified 
gender issue or cause of the issue, if the issues are 
correctly identified or formulated, if there are 
clear indicators and targets, if the proposed 
budget is realistic, and if the number of proposed 
activities are doable within the year, among 
others.  
 
On the other hand, submission of the GAD AR to 
the COA Audit Team enables it to conduct its 
annual audit on the use of the GAD budget for the 
purpose of determining its judicious use and the 
efficiency, and effectiveness of interventions in 
addressing gender issues towards the realization 
of the objectives of the country's commitments, 
plans, and policies on women empowerment, 
gender equality, and GAD.5 
 
It is worthy of note that the submission of GPB 
and GAD AR are among the criteria to be eligible 
for GADtimpala  
system. Coined to mean as Gender and 

 

3 Section 8.0 of PCW MC No. 2021-01 clarified that PCW does not endorse GAD ARs unlike the GAD Plans 
and Budgets. 
4 Section 1.2.4.1 of PCW MC No. 2019-02 provides that PCW shall endorse the FY2020 GPB if the agency 
complies with all the requested revisions (if any) in the GPB within the prescribed deadline. 
5 Section 36(a) of MCW

Development Transformation and 
Institutionalization through Mainstreaming of 
Programs, Agenda, Linkages and Advocacies 
(GADtimpala), one integral component of this 
awards system is the recognition of deserving 
national government agencies for their 
outstanding achievement and performance in 
mainstreaming gender in the bureaucracy, 
upholding the rights of women and effective 
implementation of gender-responsive programs.6 
 

c) No Existing GAD Database containing gender statistics and Sex-disaggregated Data 

Section 36(c) Generation and Maintenance of 
GAD Database, Chapter VI, of R.A. No. 9710 
provides that all departments, including their 
attached agencies, offices, bureaus, state 
universities and colleges, government-owned and 
controlled corporations, local government units, 
and other government instrumentalities shall 
develop and maintain a GAD database containing 
gender statistics and sex-disaggregated data that 
have been systematically gathered, regularly 
updated; and subjected to; gender analysis for 
planning, programming, and policy formulation. 
 
Verification disclosed that as of December 31, 
2020, ERC has no existing GAD database 
containing gender statistics and sex-
disaggregated data.  
 
It is important to note that a GAD database/sex-
disaggregated data is one of the essential elements 
in GAD planning and budgeting as it enables 
agencies to more effectively plan and implement 
its sectoral programs on GAD7. 
 

We recommended that Management direct the 
ERC GFPS to establish and regularly update a 
GAD database containing gender statistics and 
sex-disaggregated data, to enable ERC to more 
effectively plan and implement its GAD sectoral 
programs. 
 

 
78. Management commented that the ERC is committed to complying to such 
recommendation and was able to allocate GAD Budget to at least 5% of its budget 
appropriation in FY 2020.  Management expounded the reason why they indicated the 
amount of P481,497,000.00 as the Total Budget of Organization instead of the amount 
P794,035,252.00 as indicated in the AOM.  The Approved Budget per the General 
Appropriations Act was P849,778,000.00 including the Congressional Insertion amounting 
to P312,538,000.00 but was not released by the Department of Budget and Management 
(DBM), as this was subject   Hence, only the P537,240,000 was 
released to ERC for FY 2020.

7 Section 4.0, PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01 



24

 
79. Nevertheless, ERC noted that pursuant to DBM National Budget Circular No. 580, 
all government agencies were required to discontinue at least 10% of its released allotments 
due to emergency health situation brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, a total of 
P55,742,747.55 was given up by ERC from the released allotments from MOOE and CO. 
As a result, only P486,762,114.45 was the remaining balance of allotment for ERC for FY 
2020. 
 
80. Moreover, the Pension and Gratuity Funds in the amount of P80,716,835.00 were 
not included since these were requested quarterly to DBM thru Special Budget Request 
(SBR) under the Special Purpose Fund (SPF).  Likewise, the Continuing Appropriations 
amounting to P193,347,868.30 was not included in the computation of the GAD Budget 
since it was already included in the GAD Plan and Budget for FY 2019.  Due to the above 
considerations, the 5% GAD Budget amounting to Php 24,479,724.00 was computed based 
on the total Budget of Php 481,497,000.00. 

 
81. Management further commented that the present GFPS has now been granted 
access to  Mainstreaming Monitoring System (GMMS) where the GPB 
and GAD AR are to be officially encoded. At the time of submission of the GPB 2020, the 
ERC GFPS were composed of different persons.  As best effort on the part of the present 
GFPS to address the lacking GPB 2020, one was formulated for the  
guidance. 
 
82. At the moment, the ERC has met both deadlines set by the PCW for the submission 
in the  GPB 2021 and GAD AR 2020.  The ERC submitted, in its reply 
to the AOM, its GPB 2021 and GAD AR 2020 for the .  
The ERC will continue to strengthen the GFPS members and will make sure that a 
dedicated staff be assigned to make sure that these GAD reportorial requirements are 
submitted on time. 

 
83. Lastly, management commented that the ERC is taking the initial steps on the 
establishment of its GAD database with sex-disaggregated data. Among the activities in 

GPB 2021 is the conduct of a Workshop on Agency Needs Assessment on the 
Generation of Sex-Disaggregated Data. The most recent gathered bit of sex-disaggregated 
data of the ERC was made on July 30, 2020 as part of a webinar on Economic 
Empowerment which was transmitted to the resource speaker of the activity. 
 
84. Management assured that it is doing its best to comply with existing laws and 
issuances in the interest of accelerating gender mainstreaming in the agency towards the 
promotion of gender equality. 

 
 

Compliance with Other Government Laws, Rules and Regulations (LRRs) 
 
85. Audit of compliance of the following LRRs is limited only as to whether the ERC 
remits the amount withheld/contributed.  The amount of contributions however, as well as 



25

completeness of the amount remitted, cannot be ascertained due to, among others, time 
constraints, the sheer volume of raw data involve, and the lack of Financial Statements and 
supporting schedules.
