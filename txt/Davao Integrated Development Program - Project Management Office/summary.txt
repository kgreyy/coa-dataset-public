EXECUTIVE SUMMARY





A.    	Introduction



The Davao Integrated Development Program-Project Management Office (DIDP-PMO) was formally organized on July 15, 1994 with the signing of the Memorandum of Agreement in socio-economic cooperation and development. The legal basis for such creation was extracted from Article X, Section 13 of the 1987 Philippine Constitution and from Section 33, Chapter 3, Article 3, of the Republic Act 7160.



	The DIDP is a development strategy anchored in the concerted effort to pursue an integrated development by mustering the various strengths and resources of Local Government Units (LGUs) in the area. The planning and coordinating functions at the local level is strengthened at the proper regional level to provide technical support and guidance to all LGUs. 



	Owing to its significant role in the attainment of the development goals and objectives of the National Government, then President Joseph Estrada signed Executive Order (E.O.) No. 144 dated August 23, 1999, “Establishing the Coordinative and Integration Mechanism for the Implementation of the Davao Integrated Development Program”.  It mandates the DIDP to promote harmonious working relationship and maintain an effective coordination and integration mechanism among the development players in the DIDP Area.  However, E.O. No. 144 was effectively abolished per E.O. No. 72 dated February 11, 2002, and since then the member local government units had been self-sufficient, willingly performed and funded the functions of the DIDP without any funding support or subsidy from the National Government.



		The DIDP-PMO is headed by Engr. Josie Jean R. Rabanoz, CE, MPA, EnP, Executive Director. The PMO serves as the Secretariat of the Board and at the same time provides technical and staff support. 



	B.   	Audit Methodology



	The Commission has been implementing the risk-based audit in the conduct of its audit services. However, to meet the evolving development in public governance and fund management, the results-based approach in audit was incorporated. The integration of these two approaches, called the Integrated Results and Risk-Based Audit (IRRBA) Methodology was applied in the audit of the accounts and operations of the Agency.



	C.  	Scope of Audit



The audit covered the review of accounts and operations of DIDP-PMO, Davao City for CY 2020.  The audit consisted of review of operating procedures, evaluation of the Agency’s programs and projects, interview of concerned government officials and employees, verification, reconciliation, analysis of accounts and such other procedures considered necessary. 



	D.  	Financial Highlights

E.	Auditor’s Opinion on the Financial Statements

	

		The Auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of the presentation of the financial statements of the Agency as at December 31, 2020 because (1) the existence, completeness and accuracy of the reported year-end balances of the PPE accounts totaling  P729,448.83  could not be ascertained due to the non-conduct of the annual physical count of the agency’s Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) for CY 2020 and the non-submission of the Report on the Physical Count of PPE (RPCPPE); and (2) Erroneous computation and recording of the GSIS and Philhealth Premium Contributions of the DIDP-PMO employees amounting to P24,299.44 and P1,268.18, respectively, were noted thus resulting in the understatement/overstatement of the affected accounts. 

	

	

	F.	Summary of Significant Observations and Recommendations  



	The following are the audit observations and corresponding recommendations, which were discussed with Management Officials concerned during an exit conference on February 19, 2021, details of which were discussed in Part II of this Report.  Management’s views and comments were incorporated in the report where appropriate.

	

1)	Erroneous computation and recording of PHIC Premium Contributions of the DIDP-PMO employees were noted in the audit of the Due to Philhealth account due to non-observance of the Budget Circular No. 2018-4 dated October 16, 2018, the Salary Standardization Law of 2019, Philhealth Circular No. 2019-0009 dated October 25, 2019 and Item 27 of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) No. 1, thus resulting in the understatement/overstatement of the affected accounts by P1,268.18.

	

We therefore recommended the Head of the Agency to require/direct the personnel concerned of the following actions:



	a)	The Designated Administrative Officer to strictly observe the rules in the determination of the Basic Salary of the employees based on the BC No. 2018-4 and Salary Standardization Law of 2019 and to ensure that the PHIC premium contributions of the DIDP employees to be specified in the prepared Payroll are correctly computed to avoid being penalized under the IRR of the Universal Health Care Act; 



	b)	The Accountant to review the propriety of the payroll computation so as to ensure that the pertinent laws, rules and regulation on the mandatory deductions are strictly observed as well as to review the accuracy and completeness of the transactions reported in the books of accounts of the Agency and the adjustments must be properly documented;

 

	c)	The Accountant to prepare the necessary adjustments on computations and supporting documents, whether to refund or to reimburse salaries and wages of the affected personnel as well as the related mandatory deductions to ensure that any understatement/overstatement of the accounts are corrected in the books of account of the Agency; and



	d)	Remind all responsible personnel to keep abreast of the recent developments and government issuances to ensure that all guidelines are strictly implemented

		

	2. 	Erroneous computation,  recording and remittance of GSIS Premium Contributions and Loans of the DIDP-PMO employees were noted in the audit of the Due to GSIS account due to non-observance of the Budget Circular No. 2018-4 dated October 16, 2018, the Salary Standardization Law of 2019, NBC No. 579 dated January 24, 2020, Sections 5, 6 and 7 of the Republic Act No. 8291 and Item 27 of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) No. 1, thus resulting in the understatement/ overstatement of the affected accounts by P24,299.44.



We therefore recommended the Head of the Agency to require/direct the personnel concerned of the following actions:



		a.	The Designated Administrative Officer to strictly observe the rules in determination of the Basic Salary of the employees based on the BC No. 2018-4 and Salary Standardization Law of 2019 and to ensure the withholding of GSIS premium contributions/RLIP and GSIS loan payments to be specified in the prepared Payroll are correctly computed to avoid being penalized under the IRR of the Government Service Insurance Act of 1997;



			b.	The Designated Administrative Officer to prepare Notice of Salary/Wage Adjustment (NOSA) under Annex B-2 of National Budget Circular No. 579 dated January 24, 2020 and to likewise furnish the copy of the NOSA as duly approved by the Head of the Agency to GSIS;



			c.	The Accountant to review the propriety of the payroll computation so as to ensure that the guidelines related to the transactions are followed as well as review the accuracy and completeness of the financial transactions;

		

1)			The Accountant to prepare the necessary adjustments on computations and supporting documents, whether to refund or to reimburse salaries and wages of the affected personnel as well as the related mandatory deductions to ensure that any understatement/ overstatement of the accounts are corrected in the books of account of the Agency; and

		

2)			Remind all responsible personnel to keep abreast of the recent developments and government issuances to ensure that all guidelines are strictly implemented.



	3.	The non-conduct of the annual physical count of the agency’s Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) for CY 2020 and the non-submission of the Report on the Physical Count of PPE (RPCPPE) contravened Section 38, Chapter 10 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), thus the existence, serviceable conditions and accuracy of the PPE account totaling P729,448.83 could not be ascertained.



		We recommended that Management:



a)	Direct all personnel concerned to immediately conduct the physical count of PPE and to submit the RPCPPE



b)	Strictly observe the time frame for the conduct of annual physical count of PPE at the end of every year and the corresponding RPCPPE is submitted to the Auditor not later than January 31 of the following year; and



c)	Provide assistance to the Designated Property Custodian/Officer to complete the crucial tasks on the physical counting and reporting.
