PART II – OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



Unrecognized Revenue



1)	Rent Income	from the conduct of Resistivity Survey totaling P76,400.00 was not recognized in the books although this was already earned but not yet collected contrary to Sections 6 and 33, Chapter 2 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) Volume I, and Section 111 of P.D. 1445, hence understating the Accounts Receivable and Rent Income accounts by the same amount as at period covered.



	The Geo Resistivity Survey is a service offered by the Davao Integrated Development Program which helps its member –LGUs and other LGUs, NGAs or private entities who are in need of technical and scientific equipment for groundwater development. This is an inclusive service out of the rental income/maintenance fees collected by the agency on the usage of the Resistivity Meter. The revenue generated are recorded as Rent Income in CY 2019 but was subsequently termed by the Board as Maintenance Fees and deposited under a separate bank account as prescribed by DIDP Resolution No. 4, Series of 2020.

	Section 6 (a) and (b) of Chapter 2- General Provisions, Basic Standards and Policies of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume I states:

	Sec. 6. Basic Government Accounting and Budget Reporting Principles. Each entity shall recognize and present its financial transactions and operations conformably to the following:

a)	Generally accepted government accounting principles in accordance with the PPSAS and pertinent laws, rules and regulations;

b)	Accrual basis of accounting in accordance with the PPSAS;



	Section 33 (a) of Chapter 2- General Provisions, Basic Standards and Policies of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume I provides the accounting standards for revenue which is as follows, “a. Revenue includes only the gross inflows of economic benefits or service potential received and receivable of the entity in its own account. (PPSAS 9)”  

Section 111 of P.D. 1445 on Keeping of Accounts also states that:

(1) The accounts of an agency shall be kept in such detail as is necessary to meet the needs of an agency and at the same time to be adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or control agencies of the government.

	(2) The highest standard of honesty, objectivity and consistency shall be observed in the keeping of the accounts to safeguard against inaccurate and misleading information.

	Under the scope of International Public Sector Accounting Standard (IPSAS) 9 – Revenue from Exchange Transactions provides:

Par. 1. An entity which prepares and presents financial statements under the accrual basis of accounting should apply this Standard in accounting for revenue arising from the following exchange transactions and events:

a)	The rendering of services; 

(b) The sale of goods; and

(c) The use by others of entity assets yielding interest, royalties and dividends. (Emphasis supplied)



The Audit Team has obtained the list of ongoing and completed Geo Resistivity Surveys from the Designated Groundwater Development Officer (DGDO) from December 1, 2019 to September 30, 2020, as well as the Trial Balance/ Financial Statements and Billing Statements prepared and issued respectively by the Accountant; however, we have observed the following deficiencies:

Unrecorded Rent Income, 9/30/2020

As can be gleaned from the table above that out of the rental income of P156,400.00, only P80,000.00 was recorded in the books of accounts as at September 30, 2020 thus understating  both Accounts Receivable and Rent Income accounts by P76,400.00 which is contrary to PPSAS 9.  

Further verification also revealed that, except for geo resistivity conducted in Brgy. Adecor, IGACOS, Davao del Norte which was previously issued with an Audit Observation Memorandum (AOM) and was included in the CY 2019 Annual Audit Report (AAR), the Management failed to submit to the Office of the Auditor the following documents that would support the recording of the rental income, to wit:

a)		Original copy of duly notarized Resistivity Meter Rental Contract between renters and the agency indicating the rate to be charged which are to be prepared by the DIDP PMO as provided under paragraph F.5 of the Financial Requirements of DIDP Resolution No. 4, s. 2020;

	

b)		Request letter of the requesting party/ DIDP-member Local Government Units (LGUs) as required by the DIDP Resolution;

	

c)		Letter of confirmation of DIDP PMO on the finalized survey schedule and invitation and invitation of requesting party personnel for the survey;



	

d)		Billing Statements duly received by the renters as provided under paragraph F.7 of the Financial Requirements of the same DIDP Resolution; and



e)		Hard copies of the accomplished resistivity reports duly received by the renters.

		

				It was further noted based on the submitted list of ongoing and completed Geo Resistivity Surveys as at December 31, 2019 that the survey in Brgy. Caputian, Malalag, Davao del Sur conducted on December 9-11, 2019 was also not supported with the above-mentioned documents but the corresponding income was properly recorded in the books of accounts of DIDP.

		

Inquiry with the accountant revealed that they were not able to timely discuss the proper procedures in the recording of the rent income especially on the supporting documents that are needed to be attached to the Journal Entry Voucher (JEV) as well as its subsequent collections because of the following reasons:

1)	The records pertaining to geo resistivity survey transactions as well as its monitoring were previously maintained only by the Designated Groundwater Development Officer (DGDO). The submission of the pertinent reports such as letter requests, letter of confirmation of geo resistivity schedule, contracts and geo resistivity reports, among others, to the Accountant for recording was only observed recently;



2)	The Statement of Accounts (SOA) prepared by the Acting Accountant were just recently turned over to the accountant as he also failed to record the transactions in the books, hence were not included in the preparation of the financial statements as at September 30, 2020; and  



3)	The prescribed health protocols imposed during the Community Quarantine to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic has also hindered the employees from coordinating with each other as face to face contact is kept at bare minimum especially if the person/employee belongs to the vulnerable sector.  It was noted that the Accountant has availed her maternity leave from June 9, 2020 to September 22, 2020. 



The Audit Team would like to remind the Management of its responsibility for all information and representations contained in the financial statements. In this regard, the Management should maintain a system of accounting and reporting which provides for the necessary internal controls to ensure that transactions are properly authorized and recorded.



Recommendations:

We therefore recommended that Management:

		

1)			Create a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)/ Process Flow Chart of the Groundwater transactions starting from the receipt of requests from stakeholders to its revenue collection and recording, taking into account the responsible personnel for each of the identified processes, based on the existing DIDP Resolution and the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) to provide clear-cut procedures of the transactions;

		

2)			Direct the Accountant to strictly adopt the accrual method in recording of the rent income; prepare the Journal Entry Voucher (JEV) to adjust the balances in the books of accounts of DIDP;

		

3)		Immediately submit all the lacking supporting documents such as the original contract, billing statements and resistivity reports received by renters as discussed above in order for the Auditor to conduct a timely review and evaluation as part of post-audit; and



4)	Remind the personnel concerned to exhaust other means of communication such as e-mails and teleconferencing to ensure that duties and responsibilities are still promptly conducted.

		

			Management’s Comment:

		

			Management informed during the exit conference and in its letter reply that a Process Flow for Groundwater transaction was created and to be implemented in the ensuing year. They further stated that an accrual method of accounting will be adopted and assured that the new process flow will be complied with accordingly. 

		

		Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

		

		All of the Geo Resistivity Surveys conducted by the Designated Groundwater Development Officer (DGDO) as at December 31, 2020 were reported in the books, however, the related supporting documents were not yet submitted to the Audit Team for review and scrutiny. 

	

		In addition, the supporting documents for the Geo Resistivity Survey conducted in Brgy. Caputian, Malalag, Davao del Sur were also subsequently received by the Audit Team on February 26, 2021.



		The Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)/ Process Flow Chart, although existing per comment made by Management during the exit conference, was neither submitted nor emailed to the Audit Team.

	

	

	

  Erroneous computation and recording of PHIC Contributions



2)	Erroneous computation and recording of PHIC Premium Contributions of the DIDP-PMO employees were noted in the audit of the Due to Philhealth account due to non-observance of the Budget Circular No. 2018-4 dated October 16, 2018, the Salary Standardization Law of 2019, Philhealth Circular No. 2019-0009 dated October 25, 2019 and Item 27 of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) No. 1, thus resulting in the understatement/overstatement of the affected accounts by P1,268.18 





Item 27 of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) No. 1 provides: 

	

Financial statements shall present fairly the financial position, financial performance, and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful presentation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria of the assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in IPSASs. The application of IPSASs, with additional disclosures when necessary, is presumed to result in financial statements that achieve a fair presentation.



	Paragraphs (A), (B) and (C) of Section V of the Philhealth Circular No. 2019-0009 dated October 25, 2019 prescribing the Premium Contribution Schedule in the National Health Insurance Program (NHIP) Pursuant to R.A. 11223 Known as the “Universal Health Care Act” provides the agency of the legal basis on the premiums to be paid by the employees as well as of their employers. 



A)		Premium Contribution Table for Direct Contributors.



Effective the applicable month upon effectivity of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of the UHC Act, the monthly premium contributions shall be in accordance with the premium rates and monthly income/basic salary floor and ceiling prescribed in the said Act as follows: 



----media/image1.png----



B)	The Premium of Employed members in the government and private sector, including household help and sea based OFWs, shall be computed straight based on the monthly basic salary of the employee to be equally shared between the employee and employer. 



C)	For those whose basic salary is below the income floor, the premium contribution shall be computed based on the income floor, while those whose basic monthly income is above the income ceiling, the premium contribution shall be computed based on the income ceiling in accordance with the DBM Circular No. 2019-8 (Re: Employer (Government) Share in the Health Insurance Corporation Effective FY 2019).



The basis for the computation of the Basic Salary of government employees are governed by the following laws and regulations: 



i)	The Republic Act No. 11466 or the Salary Standardization Law of 2019 is an Act modifying the Salary Schedule for Civilian Government Personnel and Authorizing the Grant of Additional Benefits, and for other Purposes. 



ii)	Section 7 of the same Act prescribes the Salary Schedule, Including Step Increments to which the First (1st) tranche is applicable starting January 1, 2020, as follows: 

----media/image2.png----



iii)	The Budget Circular No. 2018-4 dated October 16, 2018 prescribes the updated Index of Occupational Services (IOS), Occupational Groups, Classes and Salary Grades [IOS], CY 2018 Edition which contains the list of classes or position titles existing in the government that are grouped by occupation. The IOS is being used by the National Government Agencies (NGAs), Government-Owned and Controlled Corporations (GOCCs) and Local Government Units (LGUs), as a guide in determining the appropriate positions that will comprise their respective staffing pattern. 



	The Audit Team has reviewed the computation of the PHIC premium contributions of the employees of Davao Integrated Development Program- Project Management Office (DIDP-PMO) as at December 31, 2020 and noted the following observations:



A)	Failure of the Management to adjust the Monthly Basic Salary of one (1) employee of the Agency based on the Salary Standardization Law of 2019 (First Tranche) and the Budget Circular No. 2018-4 which resulted in net understatement of the Due to Philhealth account amounting to P1,099.08, viz:

**Payroll was based on Salary Grade 15 wherein per Budget Circular No. 2018-4, Position of Accountant II is at Salary Grade 16



The above said condition did not only affect the PHIC premium contribution of the employee but it has also affected the computation of the Salaries and Wages paid to the employee concerned as well as the computation for all other mandatory deductions such as Home Development Mutual Fund (HDMF) contributions, Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) premium contributions and tax withheld due to the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR).

B)	Failure of the accountant to record the Due to Philhealth account in a timely manner has resulted in following discrepancies in the balances in the books, to wit:

	As can be gleaned from the forgoing table, the balance of the Due to Philhealth account per Trail Balance fluctuates frequently that has even led to an abnormal negative balance of P43.17 as at November 30, 2020 due to the following reasons:

1)	Disbursements for the month of April 2020 was not timely recorded by the Accountant and showed a variance of P6,423.63. This has been sufficiently discussed in our AOM No. 2020-003-101 dated November 25, 2020; 



2)	The monthly premium contributions to Philhealth will be shared equally by both employer and employee, but the Accountant has recorded PHIC Contribution -employees share and employer share in the amount of P3,211.83 and P3,148.87 respectively, for the month of August. It can be noted that the employer share has been reduced by P62.96 in order to make up the overstatements and erroneous recording made by the Agency. 



3)	The Due to Philhealth account disclosed an abnormal negative balance of P43.10 as at October 31, 2020 per Trial Balance due to adjustment made which has reduced the said account by P62.96 for the month of September 2020 but not covered with a Journal Entry Voucher. 



Due to the numerous errors committed by the Accountant and the failure to timely record the transactions at a certain period, it has casted doubt as to the accuracy of the balances presented in the financial statements at a given period, contrary to Item 27 of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS).

C)	Failure of the Accountant to properly compute and recognize the employee and employer shares which has resulted in the understatement of the Due to Philhealth account by P1,205.22, viz:

Month (CY 2020)

Monthly Credits per books- Employee Share

Monthly Credits per books- Employer Share

Total Monthly  Credits per books-(Set up of Payables)

	The noted observations contravened Item 27 of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) and the Philhealth Circular No. 2019-0009 dated October 25, 2019.  

	We would like to remind Management of the offenses which may be punishable under the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of the Universal Health Care Act (R.A. No. 11223) which state among others, viz: 

Failure or Refusal to Accurately and Timely Remit Contributions

38.13 Any employer, officer, or responsible employee who deliberately or through inexcusable negligence fails or refuses to accurately and timely remit contributions from the employee’s compensation shall be punished, after due notice and hearing with a fine of Fifty thousand pesos (Php50,000.00) for every violation per affected employee, or an imprisonment of not less than six (6) months but not more than one (1) year, or both such fine and imprisonment, at the discretion of the court.”  

		Recommendations:	

		

				We therefore recommended the Head of the Agency to require/direct the personnel concerned of the following actions:

		

1)			The Designated Administrative Officer to strictly observe the rules in the determination of the Basic Salary of the employees based on the BC No. 2018-4 and Salary Standardization Law of 2019 and to ensure that the PHIC premium contributions of the DIDP employees to be specified in the prepared Payroll are correctly computed to avoid being penalized under the IRR of the Universal Health Care Act;

		

2)			The Accountant to review the propriety of the payroll computation so as to ensure that the pertinent laws, rules and regulation on the mandatory deductions are strictly observed as well as to review the accuracy and completeness of the transactions reported in the books of accounts of the Agency and the adjustments must be properly documented; 



3)			The Accountant to prepare the necessary adjustments on computations and supporting documents, whether to refund or to reimburse salaries and wages of the affected personnel as well as the related mandatory deductions to ensure that any understatement/ overstatement of the accounts are corrected in the books of account of the Agency; and



4)			Remind all responsible personnel to keep abreast of the recent developments and government issuances to ensure that all guidelines are strictly implemented.

		

		Management’s Comment:

		

			The Management commented during the exit conference and in its letter reply that an erroneous salary grade was awarded to the Accountant because it was noted by the Civil Service Commission upon the supposed renewal of contract this year 2021. Prior to the unnoticed difference in salary grade, the Agency has been disbursing the payroll based on the Salary Grade approved in the Appointment of the Accountant. In addition, the Management committed to send a letter to the Philhealth Office for clarification on how to remit the unremitted mandatory deduction brought by the understatement of the salaries and wages paid to the employee, while the Philhealth online facility purportedly does not provide an option for the aforesaid matter. They further stated that the Accountant will review and strictly observe all the guidelines in compensation payment as well as remittance of the Management to the Philhealth.

		

		

		Auditor’s Rejoinder:

		

			Query with the Accountant on the letter to be sent to Philhealth on the manner of remitting the mandatory deduction disclosed that a letter will be sent on March 2, 2021. Nevertheless, the Audit Team duly noted the appropriate actions need to be done by Management and will continue to monitor the actions to be taken by the personnel concerned.

		

		Erroneous computation on the remittance of GSIS Premium Contributions and Loans

		

3)	Erroneous computation,  recording and remittance of GSIS Premium Contributions and Loans of the DIDP-PMO employees were noted in the audit of the Due to GSIS account due to non-observance of the Budget Circular No. 2018-4 dated October 16, 2018, the Salary Standardization Law of 2019, NBC No. 579 dated January 24, 2020, Sections 5, 6 and 7 of the Republic Act No. 8291 and Item 27 of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) No. 1, thus resulting in the understatement/ overstatement of the affected accounts by P24,299.44.



Item 27 of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) No. 1 provides: 

	

	Financial statements shall present fairly the financial position, financial performance, and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful presentation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria of the assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in IPSASs. The application of IPSASs, with additional disclosures when necessary, is presumed to result in financial statements that achieve a fair presentation.

	Republic Act No. 8291 or “The Government Service Insurance Act of 1997” is an Act amending Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1146, as amended, expanding and increasing the coverage and benefits of the Government Service Insurance System, instituting reforms therein and for other purposes. 

	Sections 5, 6 and 7 of the abovementioned Act provides the prescribed contributions of the GSIS members and employers, manner of collection and remittance of contributions as well as the Interests on Delayed Remittances which are quoted as follows: 

SECTION 5. Contributions. — (a) It shall be mandatory for the member and the employer to pay the monthly contributions specified in the following schedule:



	Monthly Compensation

(b) The employer shall include in its annual appropriation the necessary amounts for its share of the contributions indicated above, plus any additional premiums that may be required on account of the hazards or risks of its employees’ occupation.

(c) It shall be mandatory and compulsory for all employers to include the payment of contributions in their annual appropriations. Penal sanctions shall be imposed upon employers who fail to include the payment of contributions in their annual appropriations or otherwise fail to remit the accurate/exact amount of contributions on time, or delay the remittance of premium contributions to the GSIS. The heads of offices and agencies shall be administratively liable for non-remittance or delayed remittance of premium contributions to the GSIS.

SECTION 6. Collection and Remittance of Contributions. — (a) The employer shall report to the GSIS the names of all its employees, their corresponding employment status, positions, salaries and such other pertinent information, including subsequent changes therein, if any, as may be required by the GSIS; the employer shall deduct each month from the monthly salary or compensation of each employee the contribution payable by him in accordance with the schedule prescribed in the rules and regulations implementing this Act.

(b) Each employer shall remit directly to the GSIS the employees’ and employers’ contributions within the first ten (10) days of the calendar month following the month to which the contributions apply. The remittance by the employer of the contributions to the GSIS shall take priority over and above the payment of any and all obligations, except salaries and wages of its employees.

SECTION 7. Interests on Delayed Remittances. — Agencies which delay the remittance of any and all monies due the GSIS shall be charged interests as may be prescribed by the Board but not less than two percent (2%) simple interest per month. Such interest shall be paid by the employers concerned.

The bases for the computation of the Basic Salaries and Wages of government employees are governed by the following laws and regulations: 



i.     The Republic Act No. 11466 or the Salary Standardization Law of 2019 is an Act modifying the Salary Schedule for Civilian Government Personnel and Authorizing the Grant of Additional Benefits, and for other Purposes. 



----media/image2.png----ii.  Section 7 of the same Act prescribes the Salary Schedule, Including Step Increments to which the First (1st) tranche is applicable starting January 1, 2020, viz::





iii. The Budget Circular No. 2018-4 dated October 16, 2018 prescribes the updated Index of Occupational Services (IOS), Occupational Groups, Classes and Salary Grades [IOS], CY 2018 Edition which contains the list of classes or position titles existing in the government that are grouped by occupation. The IOS is being used by the National Government Agencies (NGAs), Government-Owned and Controlled Corporations (GOCCs) and Local Government Units (LGUs), as a guide in determining the appropriate positions that will comprise their respective staffing pattern. 



iv. National Budget Circular No. 579 dated January 24, 2020 provides for the rules and procedures in the Implementation of the First Tranche of the Modified Salary Schedule for Civilian Personnel in the National Government Pursuant to Republic Act (RA) No. 11466. 



	In addition, Sections 6.1.5 and 11 of NBC No. 579 dated January 24, 2020 provide the Rules for the Adjusting of Salaries of Contractual/ Casual Personnel as well as the Procedural Guidelines which are applicable to the Agency, viz: 



6.1.5 The salaries/wages of contractual/casual personnel shall be adjusted to the rates corresponding to Step 1 of the salary grade allocations of their positions in the Salary Schedule in Annex “A”. The adjusted daily wage rates of casual personnel shall be computed by dividing the monthly rates by 22 work days per month.”



11.0 Procedural Guidelines 



11.1. The Human Resource Management Officer (HRMO)/ Administrative Officer (AO) of the National Government Agency (NGA) or GOCC shall prepare Notices of Salary Adjustments (NOSAs) for incumbent civilian personnel by following the format marked as Annex “B-1” or Annex “B-2”, whichever is applicable, for approval by the Head of the Agency.



For personnel whose actual monthly salaries as of December 31, 2019 exceed the rates corresponding to Step 8 of the salary grade allocations of their positions in Annex “A”, the HRMO/AO shall no longer prepare NOSAs.



11.2 The NOSAs shall be issued to the personnel concerned, copy furnished the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) if they are members thereof.



11.3 The salary adjustment under this Circular shall be subject to the usual accounting and auditing rules and regulations, and to prepare re-adjustment of found not in order. The personnel concerned shall refund any overpayments received.” (Emphasis supplied)



	The Audit Team has reviewed the computation of the GSIS premium payments of the contractual employees as well as the related government share of the Davao Integrated Development Program- Project Management Office (DIDP-PMO) and the various loans availed as at December 31, 2020 and noted the following deficiencies:



A)	Failure of the Management to observe the Sections 6.1.5 and 11 of NBC No. 579 and to set the correct Basic Salary of the Accountant II based on the Budget Circular No. 2018-4 and Salary Standardization Law of 2019 (First Tranche) has resulted in the net understatement of the Due to GSIS account specifically on the Retirement and Life Insurance Premium (RLIP) amounting to P7,693.56 with which breakdown is as follows:

*Payroll was based on Salary Grade 15 wherein per Budget Circular No. 2018-4, Position of Accountant II is at Salary Grade 16



The foregoing condition did not only affect the GSIS premium contribution of the employee concerned but has also affected the computation for all the other mandatory deductions that are dependent on the Basic Salary such as Home Development Mutual Fund (HDMF) contributions, and Philhealth premium contributions and the tax withheld due to Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR). 

B)	Failure of the accountant to compute the proper premium contributions/RLIP based on the eBilling and Collections Systems (eCBS) of the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) and its related remittance to GSIS has led to an abnormal negative balance of the Due to GSIS account amounting to P708.92, to wit:

Debit Balance of Due to GSIS as at 11/30/2020

	As can be gleaned from the forgoing table, the Agency has remitted an amount of P709.09 more than what was deducted from the employees’ salaries and wages.  Moreover, the agency has a remaining P0.17 from the beginning balance which was not yet adjusted by the Accountant, thus resulted in an aggregate over remittance or debit balance of Due to GSIS in the amount of P708.92. 

The failure of the Accountant to properly record the transactions and to recognize the correct GSIS premium contributions of the employees at a certain period has led to abnormal negative balance in the books of accounts of the Agency as at November 30, 2020.  This has casted doubt as to the accuracy of the balances presented in the Financial Statements at a given period which is not in compliance with Item 27 of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS). 

C)	Failure of the personnel responsible to correctly withhold the Retirement and Life Insurance Premium (RLIP) or GSIS premium contribution of both employee and employer share, has resulted in a net understatement of the Due to GSIS account amounting to P24,299.43, to wit:

The net under remittance of P24,299.43 as shown in the Table 3.1 was mainly due to the incorrect Salaries and Wages of the Accountant II and failure of the Management to strictly observe the Salary Standardization Law of 2019. Thus the erroneous computation of the mandatory deduction resulted in the understatement of the Due to GSIS account by the same amount. 

In summary, the effect of the foregoing errors/conditions has understated the Due to GSIS account as follows:

	The noted observations contravened with Item 27 of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS),  Sections 5, 6 and 7 of the Republic Act No. 8291 or “The Government Service Insurance Act of 1997” and the Sections 6.1.5 and 11 of NBC No. 579. In addition, the under remittance may deprive the employees of the benefits in the long run which may redound upon them upon retirement. 

Recommendations:

				We therefore recommended the Head of the Agency to require/direct the personnel concerned of the following actions:

		

1)			The Designated Administrative Officer to strictly observe the rules in determination of the Basic Salary of the employees based on the BC No. 2018 -4 and Salary Standardization Law of 2019 and to ensure the withholding of GSIS premium contributions/RLIP and GSIS loan payments to be specified in the prepared Payroll are correctly computed to avoid being penalized under the IRR of the Government Service Insurance Act of 1997;

		

2)			The Designated Administrative Officer to prepare Notice of Salary/Wage Adjustment (NOSA) under Annex B-2 of National Budget Circular No. 579 dated January 24, 2020 and likewise furnish the copy of the NOSA as duly approved by the Head of the Agency to GSIS;



3)			The Accountant to review the propriety of the payroll computation so as to ensure that the guidelines related to the transactions are followed as well as review the accuracy and completeness of the financial transactions; 



4)			The Accountant to prepare the necessary adjustments on computations and supporting documents, whether to refund or to reimburse salaries and wages of the affected personnel as well as the related mandatory deductions to ensure that any understatement/overstatement of the accounts are corrected in the books of account of the Agency; and



5)			Remind all responsible personnel to keep abreast of the recent developments and government issuances to ensure that all guidelines are strictly implemented.

		

		Management’s Comment:

		

			During the exit conference, the Management commented that Notice of Salary/Wage Adjustment (NOSA) of the Accountant was recently approved by the Head of the Agency and subsequently furnished the copy to the GSIS. The update on salary increase/adjustment of the DIDP personnel was already communicated to the GSIS. 

		

		Auditor’s Rejoinder:  

		

			Scrutiny of the documents has revealed that during the year 2020, only the Salaries of the Driver and Utility Worker has been successfully updated with GSIS which took effect last April 2020, however, deductions  from their salaries and wages were only corrected on October 2020. No additional withholding of salaries for the payment of GSIS was made to correct the errors on under withholding and under remittance on December 2020. Details for the payment of December 2020 accounts were not yet post-audited by the Audit Team as these were paid in January 2021 to which paid Disbursement Vouchers (DVs) were not yet submitted to the COA Office. Nevertheless, the Audit Team duly noted the appropriate actions need to be done by Management as well as monitor the actions to be taken by the personnel concerned.



The Audit Team has conducted validations on Management’s subsequent actions taken by from previously issued audit findings that are expected to be completed by Management in Calendar Year (CY) 2020 in which the Audit Team has noted the following deficiencies:



Non-disposal of unserviceable property



4.   The delay in taking action on the disposal of unserviceable property with a carrying amount of P90,963.78 is contrary to Section 79 of PD 1445, PPSAS Nos. 1 and 17, and item (e), Section 39 and item (d), Section 40, both on Chapter 10 - PPE, Volume I, GAM, which would result in its further deterioration and devaluation, congestion of storage space, and deprivation of opportunity to earn additional revenue from its sale.  



Section 79 of PD 1445 provides on the destruction or sale of unserviceable property, quoted as follows:



  Section 79. Destruction or sale of unserviceable property. When government property has become unserviceable for any cause, or is no longer needed, it shall, upon application of the officer accountable therefore, be inspected by the Head of the agency or his duly authorized representative in the presence of the Auditor concerned and, if found to be valueless or unsalable, it may be destroyed in their presence.  If found to be valuable, it may be sold at public auction to the highest bidder under the supervision of the proper committee on award or similar body in the presence of the auditor concerned or other duly authorized representative of the Commission, after advertising by printed notice in the Official Gazette, or for not less than three consecutive days in any newspaper of general circulation, or where the value of the property does not warrant the expense of publication, by notices posted for a like period in at least three public places in the locality where the property is to be sold. In the event that the public auction fails, the property may be sold at a private sale at such price as may be fixed by the same committee or body concerned and approved by the Commission.   



The salient features of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) no.17, state among others that:



          Paragraph 82 - The carrying amount of an item of property, plant and equipment (PPE) shall be derecognized:  (a) on disposal, or (b) when no future economic benefits or service potential is expected from its use or disposal.



  	Paragraph 83 - The gain or loss arising from the derecognition of an item of property, plant and equipment shall be included in surplus or deficit when the item is derecognized. xxx” 



Item 27 of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) No. 1 provides: 

	

Financial statements shall present fairly the financial position, financial performance, and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful presentation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria of the assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in IPSASs. The application of IPSASs, with additional disclosures when necessary, is presumed to result in financial statements that achieve a fair presentation.



In addition, item (e), Section 39. Derecognition, Chapter 10 - Property Plant and equipment (PPE) , Volume I, Government Accounting Manual (GAM), provides - 



 (e) Disposal procedures of unserviceable property shall be in accordance with applicable rules and regulations on Supply and Property Management Manual, and Sec. 79 of P.D. No. 1445. 	



Relative thereto, item (d), Section 40. Idle, Unserviceable and Fully Depreciated PPE, Chapter 10 - PPE, Volume I, GAM, provides the guidelines on the form to be utilized relative to the disposal of unserviceable property and the corresponding journal entry-



            (d) All unserviceable property shall be reported in the Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) (Appendix 74).  PPE reported in the IIRUP shall be dropped from the books by debiting Impairment Loss-Property, Plant and Equipment (cost of the PPE less Accumulated Depreciation).



In the determination of the disposable property, National Budget Circular (NBC) No. 425, specifically Item B, Part I provides management of the following criteria which shall constitute disposable properties: 



1)	Property which can no longer be repaired or reconditioned; 

2)	Property whose maintenance cost/costs of repair more than outweighs the benefits and services that will be derived from its continuous use;

3)	Property that has become obsolete or outmoded because of changes in technology;

4)	Serviceable property that has been unnecessary due to changes in the agency’s functions or mandate;

5)	Unused supplies, materials and spare parts that were procured in excess of the requirements;

6)	Unused supplies and materials that has become dangerous to use because of the long storage or use which is determined to be hazardous.  

		

				Out of P733,397.44, Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) of the agency per Pre-Closing Trial Balance,  as at December 31, 2020, the amount of P90,963.78 pertained to unserviceable properties which were already determined to be unserviceable in the physical count conducted sometime in Calendar Year 2020.  This physical count was conducted to prove existence and condition of reported PPE as at December 31, 2019. The unserviceable properties were as follows:

P90,963.78

		

				Upon inquiry with the Designated Property Custodian, these items were not disposed during the year and have remained in storage as of the time of query. The delay on disposal of unserviceable properties was due to the reconciliation of the balances of the PPE accounts that were noted in CY 2019.

		

The failure of the Management to dispose the said unserviceable PPE items has resulted in the further deterioration and devaluation of the same. The delay of Management in taking action also deprived the Government of the opportunity to earn additional income from the sale thereof. This condition has also caused congestion of office space that could have been used for other purposes and may cause potential health hazards to the employees.

		

		Recommendations:

		

			We therefore recommended that Management adhere with Section 79 of PD 1445 by initiating the proper disposal of all unserviceable properties promptly by conducting the following:

		

1)			The Disposal Committee to conduct an inspection of the property to be appraised to assess its physical condition and shall likewise prepare the corresponding Appraisal Report;

		

2)			The Property Officer to prepare Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Properties (IIRUP) (Appendix 74) of the GAM Volume II, pictures (2 views), Property Ledger Cards, among others, for the unserviceable PPE items subject to disposal;



3)			The Property Officer to prepare Report of Waste Material Report (Appendix 65) of the GAM Volume II for remnants of destroyed or damaged PPE items and semi expendable items; and



4)			The Property Officer to file an application for disposal with the appropriate documents to the COA Auditor.

		

		Management’s Comment:

		

			Management has committed during the exit conference and in its letter reply that they will apply for the disposal of unserviceable PPEs once the documentary requirements such as the Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Properties (IIRUP) and Waste Material Reports (WMRs) together with the supporting documents such as pictures, among others, and the related Appraisal Report are accomplished. Meanwhile, the Management has also disclosed that they will initially perform the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) so as to update their records and the IIRUP accordingly.

		

		

		Auditor’s Rejoinder:



An application for disposal with the appropriate documents to the COA Auditor must be filed upon completion of the Inventory taking and inspection of agency PPEs. The Audit Team will validate the extent of the actions taken by the Management on the implementation of the audit recommendations. 



Non-maintenance of Property Acknowledgement Receipt

		

	5.   Property, Plant and Equipment with a total acquisition cost of P3,221,722.17 were not maintained with Property Acknowledgement Receipt (PAR), contrary to Sections 21 and 42, Chapter 10 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume I, thereby casting doubt on the completeness of established accountability over assets entrusted to the Accountable Officers.

		

			Section 21 of Chapter 10 – Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) of GAM Volume I states: 

		

	Sec. 21. Issue of PPE. Based on approved RIS, the Supply and/ or Property Custodian shall prepare the Property Acknowledgement Receipt (PAR) (Appendix 71) to support the issue of property to end-user. The PAR shall be renewed at least every three years or every time there is a change in accountability or custodianship of the property.” (Emphasis supplied)

		

			Section 42 of the same Chapter provides the Accounting and Property Records to be maintained for PPE to which Property Acknowledgement Receipt was defined as follows: 

		

	f. Property Acknowledgment Receipt (Appendix 73)- This form shall be used by the Supply and/or Property Division/ Unit to report the issuance of PPE and the acknowledgement of the end-user.

		

			The Management provided the copies of Property Acknowledgment Report (PAR) to support accountability of the presented PPE balance as at Calendar Year (CY) 2019 in compliance with the previous observation memorandum issued by the Audit Team. However, review of the submitted documents disclosed that several PPE items in the books were not maintained with Property Acknowledgement Receipts (PARs) to which details are presented as Annex A in this report.

		

		

		 	Inquiry with the Designated Property Custodian (PC) revealed that some of the PPE items which were returned by the previous users had their Property Acknowledgment Report (PAR)/ Acknowledgement Receipt Equipment (ARE)/ Memorandum Receipt of Property cancelled; however, the Receiving end-users/Accountable Officers of the PPE item were no longer issued with new PARs. 

		

			It should be noted by the Management that transfer of Property, Plant & Equipment (PPE) from one accountable person to another must be supported with proper documentation to keep track of the custody of the PPE item. This is to ensure that custodianship over the assets is properly monitored and that internal control on its maintenance is in place. In this case, the GAM provides the following documents together with the instructions for transfers of property from one Accountable Officer to another Accountable Officer, viz:

		 

1)		Property Transfer Report (PTR) (Appendix 76) – This form shall be used when there are transfers of property from one Accountable Officer/Agency/Fund Cluster to another Accountable Officer/Agency/Fund Cluster;

	

2)		Updated PAR to reflect additional PPE received by the Accountable Officer; and other related documents relevant to the transaction.

		

			The non-conduct of transfer of accountability from one person to another has resulted in the following conditions:

		

1)			Accountability over PPE items not covered with PAR are not established; and

		

2)		Inconsistencies in the documentation and non-preparation of PAR may arise hence the property records cannot be relied upon by the users. 



			An updated PAR may be used in the following circumstances, among others: (1) the preparation of the RPCPPE, (2) documentary requirement in the Filing of Relief from Accountability if later on, property items may become lost.



			In addition, two (2) PPE items noted in the PARs have different amounts with those reported in the books, to wit:

			PPE items which were neither maintained nor issued with PAR cast doubt on the accuracy and completeness of established accountability over assets entrusted to the accountable officers which is not in compliance with Sections 21 and 42, Chapter 10 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume I. 

		

		Recommendations:

		

				We therefore recommended that Management instruct the Designated Property Custodian:

		

1)			To adhere with Section 42, Chapter 10 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume I which requires the Management to update the Property Acknowledgement Receipt (PAR) based on the reported PPE balance of the agency to ensure that accountabilities over assets are properly established; 

		

2)			To secure the copy of Property Transfer Report (PTR) on the transferred properties from one Accountable Officer to another Accountable Officer to ensure its proper documentation which will serve as a reference for the updates on the PAR; and

		

3)			To submit Revised and updated Property Acknowledgement Receipt as at December 31, 2020, likewise the PAR of the additional procured PPE items during CY 2020.

		

		Management’s Comment:

		

			Management has committed during the exit conference and in its letter reply that they will update the Property Acknowledgment Receipts (PARs) in order to establish the accountabilities of the assets, secure Property Transfer Receipts (PTRs), if any, and submit the Revised and Updated Property Acknowledgement Receipts to the Audit Team upon accomplishment of the said form.  

		

		Auditor’s Rejoinder:



			The Audit Team will conduct regular monitoring on the implementation of audit recommendations to ensure the establishment of accountabilities over their PPE to the Property Custodian/Accountable Officer. 

		

		

		Weak internal control over the assets

		

	6.  Derecognition of two (2) PPE items with a carrying amounts of P4,475.00 were reported in the books without undergoing the process prescribed under Sections 4(5) and 79 of the P.D. 1445 which indicates weak internal control over the maintenance of agency assets. 

	

			Section 4 (5) of P.D. 1445 states: 

		

		Disbursements or disposition of government funds or property shall invariable bear the approval of the proper officials. (Emphasis supplied)

		

			In order to verify the propriety and accuracy of the adjustments made by the Accountant pertaining to the inconsistencies noted in the balance of PPE accounts as at November 30, 2019, the audit team has requested for the submission of the Journal Entry Vouchers (JEVs) for the month of December 2019. 

		

			However, the Accountant has failed to submit the copies of the JEVs as well as the hard copies of the supporting documents but instead provided a soft copy of the adjusted PPE Lapsing schedule for CY 2019. The Audit Team then verified the adjustments made and noted that there were two (2) PPE items which were not included in the revised PPE Lapsing schedule for CY 2019 to which prescribed disposal procedures prescribed by Sections 4(5) and 79 P.D. 1445 were not conducted, to wit:

			The failure of the Accountant to submit the Journal Entry Vouchers (JEVs) and their supporting documents that would support the adjustments made has hindered the Audit Team from promptly verifying the propriety of the actions taken by the Management. In addition, the dropping of PPE items from the books without proper authority indicates weakness of internal control over the assets of the agency as the Management did not conduct the prescribed procedures in the disposal of PPE items in accordance with Sections 4(5) and 79 of P.D. 1445.

		

		Recommendations:

		

		We therefore recommended that Management:

		

1)		 To review adjustments made and adhere to the prescribed rules and regulations with regards to the disposal of Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) of the agency; and 

	

2)		Submit the Journal Entry Vouchers (JEVs) and its supporting documents covering transactions made by Management last December 2019.  

	

	Management’s Comment:

	

		Management disclosed in its letter reply that the adjustments were already made in accordance with the prescribed rules and regulation. The difference between the Agency’s record and the amount per audit will be initially considered for adjustments to facilitate timely and accurate balance in the Financial Statements. The Management also committed to submit the adjusting journal entries immediately to the COA Office. 

	

	

	

	

	Auditor’s Rejoinder:

		

			The Audit Team duly noted the adjustments made by the Accountant. We have also requested for the submission of the adjusting journal entries as well as its supporting documents, however, no documents were submitted to the COA Office. Thus, we were precluded from validating the propriety and accuracy of the entries made. Further, we will continue to monitor the Management’s action plan on implementation of audit recommendations.

		

		Erroneous computation of Depreciation Expense

		

	7.   Erroneous computation of the accumulated depreciation of one (1) of the PPE items reported in CY 2019 has resulted in the net understatement of the carrying amount of the  ICT Equipment by P2,850.00 which is not in compliance with Section 2 (c ), Chapter 10- Property, Plant and Equipment of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume I.

	

			Section 2 (c), Chapter 10- Property, Plant and Equipment of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume I defines depreciation as “a systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its estimated useful life.” (Emphasis supplied)

		

			Review of the submitted PPE Lapsing Schedule for CY 2019 revealed that there was one (1) ICT Equipment which was reported with an abnormal balance of P1,387.50 to which details are presented as Annex B in this report.

		

As can be gleaned from the table, the depreciation expense was not systematically allocated throughout its useful life as accumulated depreciation as at CY 2018 was overstated by P2,850.00. This has resulted to an abnormal balance of the presented ICT Equipment amounting to P1,387.50.



This condition is not in compliance with Section 2 (c), Chapter 10- Property, Plant and Equipment of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume I.



Recommendation:



We therefore recommended that Management direct the Accountant to adjust the overstated accumulated depreciation to properly present the balance of the account per the computation prescribed by the GAM.



Management’s Comment:



	During the exit conference, the Management informed the Audit Team that the Accountant will adjust the PPE account to present a more reliable balance. 



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



Per scrutiny with submitted Financial Statements of DIDP, the Accountant has a total adjustment of PPE amounting to P16,719.05 which pertained to adjustments due to errors in the computation of the Accumulated Depreciation for CY 2019. However, breakdown of this adjustment was not provided to the Audit Team as of to date. Nevertheless, the Audit Team duly noted the appropriate actions need to be done by Management as well as monitor the implementation of audit recommendation by the personnel concerned.





Non-conduct of annual physical count on PPE



1)	The non-conduct of the annual physical count of the agency’s Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) for CY 2020 and the non-submission of the Report on the Physical Count of PPE (RPCPPE), contravened Section 38, Chapter 10 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), thus the existence, serviceable conditions and accuracy of the PPE account totaling P729,448.83 could not be ascertained.

Pertinent provisions of Chapter 10 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) Volume I provide that:



Section 38.  Physical Count of PPE.

During the Calendar Year (CY) 2019, the Agency has conducted the physical count of Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) and was able to submit the related Report of Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE). In CY 2020, the Accountant was able to submit an electronic copy of the adjusted PPE Lapsing Schedule related to CY 2019 balances and the related adjusting journal entries made after the reconciliation with the Designated Property Custodian. However, the Management was not able to conduct the physical count of these PPE items for CY 2020 as prescribed by Section 38 of the GAM, Volume I. 

The non-conduct of the physical count of PPE for CY 2020 and non-submission of the related RPCPPEs has precluded Management and the audit team from identifying whether reported PPE items in the books as adjusted were indeed existing as well as monitoring their present conditions. 

It is emphasized that the physical inventory-taking which is required annually should be regarded with importance as it is an indispensable procedure for checking the integrity of property custodianship.

 The aforementioned conditions casted doubt as to the existence, serviceable conditions and accuracy of the PPE account which is not in compliance with Section 38, Chapter 10- Property, Plant and Equipment of the GAM, Volume I.



Recommendations:



We recommended that the Management:



1)	Direct all personnel concerned to immediately conduct the physical count of PPE and to submit the RPCPPE;



2)	Strictly observe the time frame for the conduct of annual physical count of PPE at the end of every year and the corresponding RPCPPE is submitted to the Auditor not later than January 31 of the following year; and



3)	Provide assistance to the Designated Property Custodian/Officer to complete the crucial tasks on the physical counting and reporting.



Management’s comment:



During the exit conference, the Management expressed and committed to conduct a physical count of PPE items of the Agency. The Management further commented that they will inform the Office of Auditor once the schedule is set.



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



The Audit Team duly noted the appropriate actions need to be done by Management as well as monitor the actions to be taken by the personnel concerned. We further expressed that the letter request must be submitted to the Office of the Auditor to witness the physical count of PPEs.



	 Non-remittance of taxes withheld

	

2)	Non-remittance of withheld tax dues amounting to P220,700.61 as at December 31, 2020 due to lack of monitoring by personnel concerned on the tax remittances thru eFPS contravened Sections 123 and 124 of P.D. 1445, Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 23-2012 dated February 14, 2012 and other related tax laws, thereby depriving the government of the income that it would have collected to fund its operations and incurring penalties, surcharges and interests, without prejudice to the criminal liabilities associated with the said infraction.



Sections 123 and 124 of P.D. 1445 provide for the definition and the responsibility of installing a sound internal control over processes being adopted by the agency in fulfillment of their mandate, viz;



Section 123. Definition of Internal Control. – Internal control is the plan of organization and all the coordinate methods and measures adopted within an organization or agency to safeguard its assets, check the accuracy and reliability of its accounting data, and encourage adherence to prescribed managerial policies.

Section 124. Installation. – It shall be the direct responsibility of the agency head to install, implement, and monitor a sound system of internal control.”



RMC No. 23-2012 dated February 14, 2012 reiterated the responsibilities of all government withholding agents, particularly their accountable officers, for the correct withholding of taxes as well as the penalties that will be imposed for the violation thereof. Under the National Government Agencies, Heads of Offices (officials holding the highest position) and Chief Accountant/s or other person/s holding similar positions in departments, bureaus, agencies, instrumentalities official designated as such by the head of office are personally charged with the duty to correctly withhold taxes and remit the same.

Under Item B of the same RMC, Responsibilities of the Government Officials/ Employees as Withholding Agents were enumerated. Item B (4) and (5) emphasizes on the due dates as to when specific withheld taxes are remitted and the corresponding BIR Certificates Issued as well as its legal basis:

Further, Item B (6) also prescribes that government withholding agents shall compute for the year-end adjustment of all its employees, every December of each year and every time an employee will be separated from the employment for the particular separated employee, to ensure that taxes withheld from each employees is equivalent to his tax due. Deficiency in taxes withheld as against the tax due for the calendar year shall be deducted from the December salary while excess of taxes withheld over tax due for the calendar year shall be refunded to the concerned employee not later than January 25 of the following year. In case of separation from employment before December, the refund shall be given to the separated employee upon payment of the last compensation during the year. Taxes refunded by the employer-government agency can be deducted from the remittable amount of taxes withheld in the current month in which the refund is made and in succeeding months thereafter until the full amount refunded is fully recovered.



Furthermore, Item B (7) also requires to timely file with BIR, the annual information return and alphabetical lists of employees/ payees if applicable. The government officials and employees should ensure that the Annual Information Return of Income Taxes Withheld on Compensation and Final Withholding Taxes (BIR Form No. 1604-CF) and the required Alphabetical List of Employees/ Payees and Annual Information Return of Creditable Income Taxes Withheld (Expanded)/ Income Payments Exempt from Withholding Tax (BIR Form No. 1604-E) and the required Alphabetical List of Payees are filed with their respective RDOs on or before January 31 and March 1 of the following year, respectively.

Inquiry with the Accountant on the non-remittance of withheld taxes has revealed the following:



1)	The Accountant has encountered errors in the use of the Electronic Filing and Payment System (eFPS), wherein a system generated email notification has been received by the Agency from the BIR confirming the filing of the agency’s tax liabilities through eFPS. An excerpt of the system generated email notification is as follows: 



For Mode of Payment Using Bank Transfer, your Tax Payment Instruction ([see below], eFPS Payment Summary) has been forwarded to the BIR-Authorized Agent Bank (BIR-AAB) for processing. Please note that the said eFPS Payment Summary does not reflect the completion of your tax payment transaction yet.  Xxx

You may receive several of this email notification with the same Filing Reference Number depending on the number of Tax Payment Instruction you have submitted. To ensure that the tax payment/s were processed, please inquire your eReturn's Payment Details thru the eFPS Tax Return Inquiry” (Emphasis supplied)

2)	She also disclosed that she was not able to use the eFPS outside of the office premises because the password/s were already stored in her office computer. A laptop was also provided to her but it was provided on the later part of the year; and 



3)	Although she committed to settle the matter with BIR sometime in December 2020, she was not able to do so because of the escalating cases of COVID-19; however she committed to settle with BIR in the middle of February 2021.



Inquiry with the Designated Administrative Officer revealed that the matter is being settled by the accountant with BIR.



However, the Audit Team has observed the following circumstances as regards the matter:



1)	The accountant has filed for her maternity leave on June 9, 2020 despite the fact that she was not able to remit first withheld taxes from March to April 2020; 



2)	She was also not able to train, enroll or ensure to provide the Designated Accountant of an access to eFPS so the newly Designated Accountant could assume the responsibility to withhold and remit withheld taxes for the required periods; 



3)	That the email notification from the BIR did not confirm of the agency’s tax remittances but merely confirmed the filing of the tax dues and the subsequent forwarding of the Tax Payment Instruction to BIR AAB, in fact, it has also provided an instruction to the withholding agent on how to inquire and obtain the eReturn’s Payment Details thru eFPS Return Inquiry. Had this been performed, the agency would have known that the transaction has been unsuccessful, and would perhaps asked BIR of any possible means to remit the same; and



4)	That the Accountant was also reminded by the Audit Team to settle the matter with BIR upon her return from her maternity leave to prevent the incurrence of additional penalties and surcharges to which she committed to personally undertake, however receipt of the financial reports and their supporting documents for the months of November, December 2020 on February 2, 2021 has indicated that it was not done.



The aforementioned condition would show that the lack of monitoring by the persons responsible on tax remittances, has led to the piling up of unremitted withheld taxes which indicates a weak internal control over this process, thereby violating Sections 123 and 124 of P.D. 1445, RMC No. 23-2012, the Revenue Regulations extending the deadline for eFiling and ePayment of withheld taxes as well as the Tax Code. 



In addition, the non-remittance of the withheld taxes has also deprived the government of the income that it would have collected from the agency to fund its operations. The imposition of penalties, surcharges and interests as well as the criminal liabilities associated with the violation would also place a great burden to the responsible personnel which would have been prevented if immediate attention was made.





Recommendations:



We therefore recommended that Management:



	a)	Submit justification on the failure to remit withheld taxes from the months March to December 2020 and to submit related supporting documents;



	b)	Direct persons responsible to perform regular review and monitoring of the account to ensure not only of the correctness of the computed withheld taxes but also of the timeliness of the remittances to BIR;



	c)	Remit all remaining tax dues to BIR after the required year-end adjustments as required by relevant rules and regulations;  



	d)	Henceforth, direct the Designated Administrative Officer to strictly monitor the withholding and subsequent remittance of taxes due to the government to avoid being penalized in accordance with the law; and 



	e)	Ensure that proper turnover of accountabilities between employees or officers are observed whenever such cases arise to prevent delayed or non-remittance of the same.



Management’s Comment:



	The Management informed during the exit conference that upon inquiry from the BIR to get an authority to pay via manual payment, they were advised that a letter from Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) must be secured for the BIR to cater/proceed with the manual payment. Nevertheless, the Management assured to comply with the Audit Recommendations.



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



The Audit Team duly noted the appropriate actions need to be done by Management as well as monitor the actions to be taken by the personnel concerned. The Audit Team further reminded that the Accountant promptly remits the tax withheld to avoid imposition of penalties, surcharges and interests as well as the criminal liabilities associated with the violation.





Other Audit Results



Non-compliance with the procedures on recording of receipts and disbursements



The Audit Team has issued AOM No. 2020-003-PMO dated November 25, 2020 to report the non-compliance with the procedures on recording of receipts and disbursements in the books of accounts of the Agency which resulted in under/overstatement of Cash in Bank-Local Currency Current Account (LCCA) as at September 30, 2020 due to  late recording, contrary to Section 27 of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) and pertinent provisions of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), thus casting doubt on the accuracy and reliability of the reported balances in the financial statements.



The Management has timely reported agency transactions and has made the necessary adjustments which concerned recognition of collections and disbursements.
