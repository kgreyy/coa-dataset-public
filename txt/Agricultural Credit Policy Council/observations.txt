Their salaries were charged against Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE) in the total amount of ₱60.206 million, as authorized under DBM Circular Letter No. 2013-5 dated July 22, 2013.  



GAD Budget, Utilization and Accomplishments



18)	The agency allocated P132.500 million or 4.67 percent of its appropriation of P2,840.181 million which was not in accordance with the five percent mandatory rate for GAD activities.  Moreover, the submitted ACPC GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) was not approved/endorsed by PCW. Also, the GAD Accomplishment Report was not submitted on time, thus, affecting the timely audit of GAD related activities.



For CY 2020, the agency prepared its Gender and Development (GAD) Plan with an estimated budget of P132.500 million or 4.67 percent of its appropriation of P2,840.181 million which is not in accordance with the five percent mandatory rate for GAD activities as stated in Section 31 of RA No. 11465, otherwise known as the General Appropriations Act for FY 2020. 



The submitted 2020 GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) was reviewed by the Philippine Commission on Women (PCW) and was returned to ACPC together with PCW’s comments/questions. However, the agency failed to resubmit the CY 2020 GPB due to the difficulty in application of the attribution cost using the Harmonized Gender and Development Guidelines (HGDG), thus, resulted in the unapproved/unendorsed GPB.



Moreover, the GAD Accomplishment Report was not submitted to the audit team, hence, planned activities implementation and the amount utilized for GAD related activities cannot be ascertained. 



The delay in the submission of the accomplishment report was principally due to the re-scheduling of the training on the HGDG for Project Development, Implementation, Monitoring, and Evaluation wherein the scoresheet for the attribution of GAD-related activities will be determined using the HGDG tool as prescribed by PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01.



Item V of COA Circular 2014-001 dated March 18, 2014 states that “The Audited agency shall submit a copy of the Annual GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) to the COA Audit Team assigned to the agency within five (5) working days from the receipt of the approved plan from the PCW or their mother or central offices, as the case maybe. 



Section 1.0 of the PCW Memorandum Circular No. 2021-01 dated January 20, 2021 provides that March 12, 2021 is the deadline of encoding and submission to PCW of FY 2020 GAD Accomplishment Report (AR) of executive departments and their attached agencies through Gender Mainstreaming and Monitoring System (GMMS). Moreover, Section 7.0 of the same circular further states that “FY 2020 GAD ARs submitted to PCW shall be authenticated by the GMMS with a barcode. Concerned agencies shall print the GMMS-authenticated GAD AR for signature of their agency head and submit signed copies to PCW and their respective COA Audit Team”. 



We recommended and Management agreed to: 



a)	instruct the GAD chairperson to ensure that GPB is at least five percent of their budget; and 

 

b)	capacitate GAD focal point system personnel on the use of HGDG to enable submission of GPB and GAD AR within the prescribed time.  



Senior Citizens and Persons with Disability plans/program



19)	The ACPC spent ₱0.721 million in the implementation of the activities for the Senior Citizen and Person with Disability (SCPD), in addition to providing ramps, a wheelchair and priority lane for them, in compliance with Section 32 of the General Provisions of the GAA for FY 2020. 

		

Implementation of ODA Funded Projects

20)	The ACPC has no Official Development Assistance (ODA) Funded Projects for CY 2020.



Receipt and utilization of Disaster Related Fund



21)	The ACPC did not receive Disaster Risk Reduction and Management (DRRM) Fund and/or Quick Response Fund (QRF) for CY 2020.



Audit suspensions, disallowances, charges and settlements



22)	There were no audit suspensions, disallowances and charges during the year  however, partial settlement of ₱0.049 million has been made on the audit disallowance of ₱0.084 million for prior years. Moreover, the unsettled amount of ₱0.035 million as of year-end has been fully settled on February 3, 2021.   

 

Section 7.1.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-006 or the Revised Rules of Settlement of Accounts dated September 15, 2009 provides that “The head of the agency, who is primarily responsible for all government funds and property pertaining to his agency, shall ensure that: (a)  the  required financial and other reports and statements are submitted by the concerned agency officials in such form and within the period prescribed by the Commission; (b) the settlement of disallowances and charges is made within the prescribed period; (c)  the requirements of transactions suspended in audit are complied with; and (d) appropriate actions are taken on the deficiencies noted as contained in the AOM.” 

	

	The total audit suspensions and disallowances of various transactions as of December 31, 2020, as well as the settlement during the year, is summarized below:

There were no audit suspensions, disallowances and charges issued during the year, deficiencies noted were either complied with or settled immediately upon communicating to the concerned officials and employees of such findings.  



The beginning balance of ND pertains to the disallowance of excessive monetization of leave credits in CYs 2016-2017 of four ACPC employees, of which three are still connected with the agency who settled their liabilities thru partial payment in the amount of ₱0.034 million, leaving a balance of ₱0.035 million, which remained outstanding as of year-end. It is worthy to mention that full settlement has been made on February 3, 2021 and corresponding NSSDC has been issued. 



We recommended and Management agreed to ensure strict compliance with laws, rules and regulations to avoid audit suspensions, disallowances and charges and to require settlement of the same within the prescribed time. 





C)	Compliance with Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements on the Audit of COVID-19 Funds



23)	Funds transferred to GFIs and NGFIs for the implementation of SURE COVID-19 program amounting to ₱4,937.484 million as of December 31, 2020 is unreliable due to: a) lack of the identified supporting documents to confirm compliance with Memorandum Order No. 22; and b) difference of ₱68.869 million between the amount per books and results of confirmation and unconfirmed fund transfers of ₱1,356.100 million.  



Memorandum Circular No. 77 s. 2020 dated March 17, 2020 was issued by the Office of the President “Directing all government agencies, offices and instrumentalities, as well as Local Government Units, to implement and ensure compliance with the issuances of the Department of Health and Department of Agriculture on the prices of essential emergency medicines and supplies, and selected agriculture and fishery commodities.” 

	

In response to the above issuance, Memorandum Order No. 22, Series of 2020 dated April 8, 2020 was issued by the DA with the subject: Expanded SURE Aid and Recovery Project Guidelines for AHON LAHAT, Pagkaing Sapat Kontra sa COVID-19 (ALPAS sa COVID-19) Program aimed to enhance food production and availability, food accessibility and affordability, and food price stability.



The Expanded SURE Aid and Recovery Project (SURE COVID 19), a credit assistance program implemented by ACPC has the objectives to: 



	a)	Finance the emergency and production capital requirements of marginalized, small farmers and fisherfolk (MSFF) whose incomes were affected by the Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ), due to COVID-19, thereby, helping them regain their capacity to continue their agricultural activities and contribute to sustained food production; and 



	b)	Provide the working capital requirements of micro and small enterprises (MSEs) engaged in agriculture and fisheries food production, delivery of produce/products/commodities, and other activities in the supply chain to ensure the availability of food supply.

SURE COVID-19 Program was a collaboration between: a) DA (DA-Regional Field Offices and ACPC); b) Local Government Units (LGUs) thru the Provincial/City/ Municipal Agricultural Offices; and c) Government Financial Institutions (GFIs) and Non-Government Financial Institutions (NGFIs) as Lending Conduits. This credit assistance program provides eligible SFF-borrowers to avail of a non-collateralized loan of ₱0.025 million per household at zero percent interest payable in ten years while eligible MSEs may avail of working capital loans of up to ₱10.000 million also at zero percent interest payable in five years. 

    

During the year, the agency received COVID-19 fund amounting to ₱4,937.484 million, with a utilization rate of 100 percent, to wit:

Pursuant to R.A. No. 11469 also known as “Bayanihan to Heal as One Act” and 11494 or the “Bayanihan to Recover As One Act”, the DBM released the amount of ₱257.988 million and ₱2,500.000 million to ACPC to cover the funding requirements for the implementation of various programs/activities/projects (P/A/P) in support to COVID-19 and in the Agriculture Stimulus Package under Bayanihan II, respectively.  Both Special Allotment Release Order (SARO) indicated that the fund shall be valid until December 31, 2020.



The DA Secretary directed all Operating Units (OUs) to refocus their P/A/Ps to enhance food production under the COVID-19 environment. Responding to the directive, ACPC refocused its remaining loan fund under the FY 2020 budget appropriation amounting to ₱2,179.496 million and launched the SURE COVID-19.



Under the SURE COVID-19 and in reference with Memorandum Order No. 22, ACPC transferred funds amounting to ₱4,937.484 million to a) Land Bank of the Philippines as GFIs and b) rural bank, cooperative bank and cooperatives as NGFIs amounting to ₱1,000.000 million and ₱3,937.484 million, respectively, to provide loans assistance to eligible beneficiaries. The fund transfers were covered with Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) by and between ACPC as source agency and GFIs/NGFIs as partner lending conduits (PLCs) for the implementation of the SURE COVID 19. 



In the audit of the fund transfers, the following deficiencies were noted:



a)	lack of the identified supporting documents to confirm compliance with Memorandum Order No. 22



Section V of Memorandum Order No. 22 provides among others the Role of Program Partners, of which ACPC derived its process flow for the implementation of the SURE COVID-19 presented as follows:



----media/image1.jpeg----



Also, in reference with the Section V of Memorandum Order No. 22, the following documents were identified to determine compliance whether the Role of Program Partners were followed and done: 

 

1)	List of Eligible MSFF from the LGU

2)	Validated List of Eligible MSFF from DA-RFOs

3)	Endorsement of potential NGFIs/conduits from DA-RFOs

4)	ACPC Disbursement Vouchers for the transfer of fund

5)	List of borrowers who have availed the loan assistance from the GFIs/NGFIs

6)	Monitoring Report on the borrowers from the ACPC



Audit of the Disbursement Vouchers (DVs) and its supporting documents pertaining to fund transfers amounting to ₱2,549.030 million to 102 NGFIs disclosed that the documents identified as basis for the fund transfer were not attached as follows:

The absence of the said documents constitutes non-compliance with the role of program partners in the implementation arrangement provided under Section V of Memorandum Order No. 22 and may cast doubt on the procedure undertaken for the release of fund to NGFIs.



The Policy, Planning and Program Development and Advocacy Staff (PPPDAS) Director explained that most of the list of eligible MSFF and duly validated list were attached in the files maintained at their office while the endorsement of potential NGFIs/conduit from DA-RFO were not secured due to the urgency of the implementation of the program and to provide immediate assistance to farmers/fisherfolks affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. 



b)	difference between amount per books and results of confirmation and unconfirmed fund transfers



Item 23 Section 3 of the Financial Audit Manual provides that “External Confirmation is a procedure adopted in substantive tests. This procedure is used to address assertions associated with account balances and their elements and to confirm terms of agreement, contracts, or transactions between an agency and other parties.” 



The audit team sent confirmation letters to 51 PLCs, out of the 130 PLCs to determine the existence and correctness of the recorded funds transferred amounting to ₱2,082.363 million as of December 31, 2020. Considering the restrictions on people’s movement due to the community quarantine, the confirmation letters were sent to PLCs through electronic mail and corresponding replies have been incorporated in this memorandum, presented as follows:

Of the 51 confirmation letters sent, 39 or 76 percent replied with total fund receipt of ₱795.132 million, of which, nine conduits reported discrepancies amounting to ₱68.869 million. 



On the other hand, the audit team did not receive any reply/confirmation from 12 lending conduits on the receipt of funds transferred amounting to ₱1,356.100 million. 



An unreconciled response/non-response to a confirmation request may indicate possible risk of material misstatement and which may affect the existence assertion, wherein all assets like fund transfers to GFIs and NGFIs actually exist. 



The Director, PPPDAS explained that most of the difference may have been caused by the unreleased checks as of year-end and confirmation letters sent through courier and registered mail were not received by the PLCs due to the community quarantine restrictions in some areas. 



Verification of the list of unreleased checks as of December 31, 2020 disclosed that out of the total difference amounting to ₱68.869 million, ₱35.000 million was included in the list, hence, was not received by the concerned PLCs as of year-end.   



We recommended that Management instruct the Accountant and the PPPDAS Director to coordinate with the PLCs concerned to: a) secure and attach the identified documents in reference with the Role of the Program Partners under Memorandum Order No. 22; b) facilitate reconciliation on the amount of differences noted per list of fund transfer and per confirmation reply; and            c) remind PLCs to reply to confirmation letters sent to them.
