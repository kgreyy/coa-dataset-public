EXECUTIVE SUMMARY



A)	Introduction

	

	

The Agricultural Credit Policy Council (ACPC), an attached agency of the Department of Agriculture (DA), was created on December 24, 1986, by virtue of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 113 replacing the Presidential Committee on Agricultural Credit (PCAC) and the Technical Board for Agricultural Credit (TBAC).  



ACPC is mandated to (a) assist the DA in synchronizing all credit policies and programs in support of the Department’s priority programs; (b) review and evaluate the economic soundness of all ongoing and proposed agricultural credit programs; (c) receive all reports and documents of all programs with agricultural credit and financing components; and (d) undertake measures of increasing its fund base and adopt other liquidity interest stabilization and risk cover mechanisms for its various financing programs in consultation with the Monetary Board. 



The mandate of ACPC was expanded with the issuance of the following:                    (a) Republic Act (RA) No. 7607 or the Magna Carta for Small Farmers in 1992; (b) RA No. 8435 or the Agriculture and Fisheries Modernization Act [AFMA] of 1997; (c) DA Administrative Order No. 6 (Implementing Rules and Regulations [IRR] of the AFMA) dated July 10, 1998; and (d) DA Special Order No. 605, series of 2011, dated September 21, 2011, which designated ACPC to implement Section 7 of the IRR of RA No. 10000 or the Agri-Agra Reform Credit Act of 2009. Thus, ACPC was tasked further to recommend policy changes on agricultural credit programs for farmers; strengthen farmers’ organizations, cooperatives and credit organizations to improve credit access by farmers and fisherfolk, promote credit awareness thru training and extensive information drive in collaboration with the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP), Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), and other government agencies and private organizations.



  The ACPC is governed by a Council composed of the DA Secretary as Chairman, BSP Governor as Vice-Chairman, the Secretaries of the Department of Finance (DoF), Department of Budget and Management (DBM), and the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) Director-General as Members.  The agency operation is headed by Ms. Jocelyn Alma R. Badiola, Executive Director, assisted by a Deputy Executive Director.  Pursuant to Executive Order (EO) No. 366, the ACPC Rationalization Plan was approved effective May 2, 2013, which abolished the former position of a Deputy Director and reduced from six to four the operating services.  The present operating services each headed by a Director are renamed as (a) Policy, Planning and Program Development and Advocacy Staff (PPPDAS); (b) Program Monitoring and Information Systems Management Staff (PMISMS); (c) Fund Management Staff (FMS); and (d) Administrative, Financial and Management Staff (AFMS).



As of December 31, 2020, ACPC had 31 employees, out of 34 plantilla positions, and four personnel holding co-terminus with the incumbent positions to be abolished once vacated.  The workforce is supported by 154 individuals hired through Contract of Service (COS) during the year.

C)	Scope and Objectives of Audit



The audit covered the accounts, transactions and operations of ACPC for CY 2020. The audit was conducted to (a) ascertain the level of assurance that may be placed on management’s assertions on the financial statements; (b) determine the propriety of transactions as well as the extent of compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations; (c) recommend agency improvement opportunities; and (d) determine the extent of implementation of prior years’ audit recommendations.



D)	Independent Auditor’s Report



	An unmodified opinion was rendered on the financial statements of ACPC. 

 

E)	Significant Observations and Recommendations  

		

1)	The agency allocated ₱132.500 million only or 4.67 percent of its appropriation of ₱2,840.181 million which was not in accordance with the five percent mandatory rate for GAD activities.  Moreover, the submitted ACPC GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) was not approved/endorsed by PCW. Also, the GAD Accomplishment Report was not submitted on time, thus, affecting the timely audit of GAD related activities. (Observation No. 18)

		

We recommended and Management agreed to: 



a)	instruct the GAD chairperson to ensure that GPB is at least five percent of their budget; and  



b)	capacitate GAD focal point system personnel on the use of HGDG to enable submission of GPB and GAD AR within the prescribed time.  

	

2)	Funds transferred to GFIs and NGFIs for the implementation of SURE COVID-19 program amounting to ₱4,937.484 million as of December 31, 2020 is unreliable due to: a) lack of the identified supporting documents to confirm compliance with Memorandum Order No. 22; and b) difference of ₱68.869 million between the amount per books and results of confirmation and unconfirmed fund transfers of ₱1,356.100 million. (Observation No. 23)



We recommended that Management instruct the Accountant and the PPPDAS Director to coordinate with the PLCs concerned to: a) secure and attach the identified documents in reference with the Role of the Program Partners under Memorandum Order No. 22; b) facilitate reconciliation on the amount of differences noted per list of fund transfer and per confirmation reply; and            c) remind PLCs to reply to confirmation letters sent to them. 

 

The observations and recommendations were communicated with the agency officials through the issuance of Audit Observation Memoranda and discussed with concerned Management officials and staff in an exit conference on April 26, 2021. Management views and comments were considered in the report, where appropriate.









F)	Enforcement of Settlement of Accounts



Of the ₱0.084 million audit disallowances for prior years and CY 2020, only ₱0.049 million was settled, leaving an unsettled amount of ₱0.035 million as of end of the year.



G)	Implementation of Prior Year’s Audit Recommendations



Out of 22 prior year’s audit recommendations, 10 were implemented and 12 were not implemented by management as of December 31, 2020, which were reiterated with modifications, where applicable.
