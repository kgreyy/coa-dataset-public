D)	Independent Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements



	A qualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the consolidated financial statements of PSAU-All Funds was rendered due to the material accounting errors and deficiencies noted in the audit of different accounts such as (a) non-reversion of unreleased commercial checks back to the Cash in Bank account as at year-end amounting to ₱1,443,188.88 resulted in the understatement of both Cash in Bank and Accounts Payable accounts by ₱1,443,188.88; (b) non-recognition of book reconciling items in the Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS) with a net positive amount of ₱19,205,167.57 resulted in the understatement of both Cash in Bank and Accumulated Surplus accounts by ₱19,205,167.57; (c) existence of negative balances on the subsidiary accounts of Other Payables aggregating to ₱3,993,068.35 resulted in the reduction on the reported amount of Other Payables; (d) non-elimination of intra-agency payables (Due to Other Funds) amounting to ₱14,346,058.38 overstated the Other Payables account; (e) erroneous recognition of the inter-agency remittances totalling to ₱2,643,981.43 as expense instead of deduction from the Inter-Agency Payables account; (f) non-adjustment of taxes withheld on checks aggregating to ₱241,476.51 that were still unreleased as of year-end resulted in the overstatement of the Due to Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) account; (g) lack of supporting details on the ₱2,184,825.33 balance of the inter-agency payables accounts raised doubts on the validity of the reported balance of the Inter-Agency Payables account; and (h) recorded Impairment Loss totalling to ₱21,733,990.08 that was determined and recognized in lump without any evidences of a systematic assessment and measurement of impairment of the University’s non-cash-generating assets resulted in the understatement of the reported amounts of Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) and Accumulated Surplus accounts by ₱21,733,990.08.

	

	In view of the foregoing, we recommended and the Management agreed to undertake the following courses of action:



--	On Cash in Bank account



a)	ensure that all unreleased checks as of reporting date are reverted back to Cash in Bank accounts;



b)	analyze all book reconciling items reported in the Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS) and thereafter effect adjusting entries to correct the understatement of Cash in Bank accounts;



c)	regularly resolve and recognize in the books of accounts all reconciling items identified in the BRS;



d)	expedite the analysis of accounts and fund balances to derecognize the Cash in Bank accounts in the General Fund (GF) and, henceforth recognize the transfer in the Trust Fund (TF); 



e)	prepare a separate BRS for every bank depository account of the University vis-à-vis individual fund cluster.









--	On Other Payables account



f)	determine and analyze the causes of the negative balances on the subsidiary accounts of the Other Payables and thereafter make the necessary adjustments;



g)	expedite the inter-fund transfers to zero out the intra-agency payables accounts or, if not practicable, ensure that intra-agency accounts are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements;



h)	determine the remaining balances of funds collected from students and receipts from income-generating projects (IGPs) that were incorporated in the Other Payables account and, henceforth make correcting entries; 



i)	discontinue the accounting policy of recognizing as liabilities the receipts from service operations and business-related activities of the University and thereafter carefully analyze the economic substance of transactions prior to the recognition on the accounts to safeguard against inaccurate or misleading information.



--	On Inter-Agency Payables



j)	draw correcting journal entries on the erroneous recognition of remittances of withheld payroll deductions;



k)	ensure non-recognition as Due to Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) of taxes due on payment to suppliers and creditors whose checks are not yet released at reporting date; and



l)	expedite the analysis of the Inter-Agency Payables accounts and, thereafter effect adjusting entries on the accounts.



--	On Impairment Loss account



m)	establish a systematic approach in assessing, estimating and recognizing the impairment losses on the University’s Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) to ensure fair presentation of accounts in the financial statements; and



n)	require the Head of Accounting Office to effect adjusting entries to correct the erroneously recorded impairment loss and accumulated impairment losses amounting to ₱21,733,990.08 and thereafter comply with the provisions of International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) 21 and Section 28 (b), Chapter 10 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I.









E)	Summary of Other Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations



	Summarized below are the other significant audit observations with their recommendations, the details of which are presented in Part II of this report.



1)	The University’s fund structure as embedded in the Integrated School Management System remained unadjusted and non-compliant with the Unified Accounts Code Structure (UACS) prescribed by the Commission on Audit-Department of Budget and Management-Department of Finance (COA-DBM-DOF) Joint Circular Nos. 2013-1 and 2014-1, dated August 6, 2013 and November 7, 2014, respectively, and Section 13, Chapter 2 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I, thus resulting in the (a) split recording of the fees collected from the students amounting to ₱20,191,496.32 in two inappropriate fund clusters and (b) dispersed recognition of receipts from income-generating projects (IGPs) in the sum of ₱14,471,178.53 in four different fund clusters. (Observation No. 5)



We recommended and the University President agreed to instruct the Vice President for Administration and Finance to (a) coordinate with the Director of Management Information System (MIS) the review of the existing fund structure of the Integrated School Management System (ISMS) by outlining the fund clusters of each fee currently maintained in the database; (b) lead the Finance Unit in the mapping out of every fee collected by the University with the applicable fund clusters in accordance with the Unified Account Code Structure (UACS) and the Government Accounting Manual (GAM); (c) discontinue the split recording of fees collected from students and/or fees that are nonetheless subject to same budget and disbursement authority; and (d) merge Auxiliary Fund with the Revolving Fund and thereafter utilize the sustained fund in recognizing in that fund all business-type activities of the University.



We recommended further that the President initiate a collaborative project between the Finance Unit, MIS Unit and representative(s) from the system developer for the reprogramming and enhancement of the ISMS, particularly on the fund structure as required by the UACS and the GAM.



2. 	The University has yet to offer new degree programs related to the other academic disciplines explicitly listed in its governing charter or the Republic Act (R.A.) No. 10605, limiting its capacity to satisfy the increasing needs of the locality for in-demand jobs related to business, health services and accountancy. Moreover, technical issues of the 17 lapsed Certificates of Program Compliance (COPCs) have yet to be resolved by the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) pursuant to CHED Memorandum Order (CMO) No. 14, s. 2019 while six undergraduate programs were not yet accredited by an external accreditor under CMO No. 01, series of 2005; thus, impinging on the University’s pursuit of its primary mission of bestowing relevant academic degrees to graduates characterized by quality education that is essential to stimulate socio-economic development in the Province of Pampanga. (Observation No. 7)



We recommended and the University President agreed to undertake the following courses of action: (a) instruct the Council of Deans/Academic Council to conduct feasibility studies on the likelihood to offer new degrees related to the other mandated fields of academic discipline vis-a-vis relevant reports on labor market information; (b) require the Vice President for Academic Affairs (VPAA) to (i) ensure that all academic offerings of the University are in compliance with program requirements prescribed by CHED by securing valid and specific Certificates of Program Compliance (COPCs) therefrom; and (ii) work out for the accreditation of all program offerings of the University.



3.	The actual outcomes of the University’s Higher Education Program (HEP), particularly the graduates’ employability factor and the passing rates of graduates in licensure examinations, were not utilized as inputs for the strategic refinement of curricular program contents and/or on the improvement of academic support services that is ultimately beneficial in the attainment of the University’s goals and objectives. Also, the relevance and quality of tertiary education provided by the University have not been ensured in the absence of an institutional, structured and periodic assessment of risks and management of the threats to graduates’ employability and performance in licensure examinations. (Observation 8)



We recommended and the University President agreed to undertake the following courses of action: (a) instruct the Vice President for Academic Affairs (VPAA) to: (i) encourage all College Deans to take a comprehensive study on the employability of graduates for submission to the Office in-charge of consolidation and reporting; (ii) administer a comprehensive study that will identify all factors correlated to the low performance in the licensure examinations, especially for Professional Teacher - Secondary, Registered Agriculturist, Agricultural and Biosystems Engineer, Forester, and Fisheries Technologist; and (b) Require the Director of Planning and Project Development Office to (i) lead a performance risk committee that will take charge on the monitoring, tracing, and consolidating the data on the graduates’ employability to ensure consistency of reported figures; and (ii) utilize the reports and studies prepared by the College Deans and the VPAA in introducing measures on how to effectively address the identified threats with the end view of elevating the performance of the University’s graduates in licensure examinations and improving further the employment statistics of graduates.





F)	Summary of Total Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges as of year-end



	Audit suspensions and disallowances amounting to ₱1,156,613.18 and ₱1,787,964.88, respectively, remained unsettled as of December 31, 2020. Moreover, audit disallowances issued prior to the effectivity of the Revised Rules on Settlement of Accounts (RRSA) totaling to ₱190,394.01 were still outstanding as at year-end 2020.
