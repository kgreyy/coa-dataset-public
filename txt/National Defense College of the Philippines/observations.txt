PART II – OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS





Implementation of Design and Build Projects



1)	Gaps in planning, monitoring and supervision of two Design and Build projects of the agency with contract cost of P521,729,673.46 resulted in delayed implementation of the projects caused by change of project site. Moreover, mobilization fees amounting to P78,259,451.01 were paid to contractor in 2018 and 2019 but the project construction works have not yet been started as of December 31, 2020.



	1)	Non-Policy Matter (NPM) No. 090-2013 of GPPB issuance dated November 25, 2013 states that the change of project site after the issuance of Notice of award amounts to modification of bidding documents and is not allowed under RA 9184 and its IRR.



	2)	Section 7-Preliminary design and construction studies under Annex “G” - Guidelines for the procurement and implementation of contracts for Design and Build Infrastructure Projects of RA 9184 and its revised IRR states among others: 



   No bidding and award of design and build contracts shall be made unless the required preliminary design and construction studies have been sufficiently carried out and duly approved by the Head of the Procuring Entity that shall include, among others, the following:

 

i)	Project Description

vii.   Approved Budget for the

Contract

viii.  Proposed Design and 

        Construction Schedule

ix.  Minimum requirements for a Construction Safety and Health Program for the project being considered

x.    Tender/Bidding

ii)	Conceptual Design

iii)	Performance Specifications and Parameters



iv)	Preliminary Survey and Mapping

v)	Preliminary Investigations

vi)	Utility Locations





The acquisition of right-of-way and the conduct of eminent domain proceedings shall still be the responsibility of the procuring entity, which shall include a preliminary budget for this purpose.



	3)	GCC Clause 1.28 of Special Condition of Contract which specifically states that:  The start date - Date of approval of the final design. The contractor shall submit the final plan and design within 15 calendar days upon receipt of the notice to proceed (NTP). Construction works shall commence within seven (7) days after approval of the Final Plan and Design.



	4)	Sections 8.1 and 8.4 of Annex “E” of the Revised IRR of RA 9184, otherwise known as the Government Procurement Reform Act (GPRA)” provide that:



Section 8.1 – Where the contractor refuses or fails to satisfactorily complete the work within the specified contract time, plus any time extension duly granted and is hereby in default under the contract, the contractor shall pay the procuring entity for liquidated damages, and not by way of penalty, an amount, as provided in the conditions of contract, equal to at least one tenth (1/10) of 1 (one) percent of the cost of the unperformed portion of the works for every day of delay.

 

Section 8.4 – In case that the delay in the completion of work exceeds a time duration equivalent to ten percent (10%) of the specified contract time plus any time extension duly granted to the contractor, the procuring entity concerned may rescind the contract, forfeit the contractor’s performance security and takeover the prosecution of the project or award the same to a qualified contractor through negotiated contract.



	5)	In CY 2018, DND-BAC conducted bidding for the two Design and Build projects of NDCP: (i) one International Student Dormitory (ISD) with amenities and multi-level parking and one staff/transient quarters with amenities (Dorm and Quarters buildings); and (ii) one Academic Building with Amphitheater Classroom, including outside amenities and facilities (Academic Building). In same year, both projects were awarded to Legazpi Premium Development Corporation (LPDC) and the contracts were signed by the Secretary of National Defense (SND) because the amount of contract exceeded the threshold of the signing authority of the NDCP President. Details are as follows:

	6)	In the review of projects documents, it was noted in the planning stage that NDCP failed to secure the availability and approval of the project site where the two projects shall be constructed. Also, lack of proper monitoring and supervision during implementation precluded the NDCP to immediately initiate termination of the contract. Likewise, request for termination of contracts from DND was made only on September 10, 2020 when the projects had already incurred a slippage of negative 95.96 percent for Academic Building and negative 79.52 percent for International Dormitory with Multi-Level Parking and Transient/ Staff Building Project. 



a)	Change in the project site after the issuance of Notice of Award



	7)	The Proposed Site Development Plan, which form part of the bidding documents of Dorm and Quarters project, disclosed that the project is to be constructed at the NDCP compound or at the area between the Intelligence Service of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (ISAFP) and the existing NDCP dormitory building.



	8)	Interview with the NDCP personnel and members of the TWG revealed that ISAFP objected on the construction of projects at the above-mentioned site for security reasons. On August 13, 2018, NDCP was informed by DND Assistant Secretary for Logistics and Acquisition (ASLA) that the area being occupied by Joint Special Operation Group (JSOG) and partly CGEA Driving Range will be the new site of the Academic building. 



	9)	On October 8, 2018 or four days before the issuance of NOA for Dorm and Quarters project, NDCP requested from the SND that the two projects, the Dorm and Quarters and the Academic building, be constructed adjacent to each other which was consequently approved on the same date.  The approved transfer of construction site for Dorm and Quarters project from NDCP/ISAFP area to JSOG and Camp Aguinaldo Driving Range, did not form part of the bidding documents (Invitation to Bid, Drawing, Site Plan, etc.) since the bidding was conducted prior to the said approval. 



	10)	The approved Detailed Architectural and Engineering Plan (DAEP) showed that Dorm and Quarters project will be constructed at the new project site which is at the area occupied by Joint Special Operation Group (JSOG) and partly by Camp General Emilio Aguinaldo (CDEA) Driving Range.



	11)	The change of project site leads to a substantial change and non-applicability of the preliminary plan and design, construction studies and other parameters stated in the bidding documents; therefore, the conduct of bidding and awarding of contract was considered invalid.



	12)	Moreover, NPM No. 090-2013 dated November 25, 2013 issued by the GPPB states among others, that the change of project site after the issuance of NOA amounts to modification of bidding documents which is not allowed under RA 9184 and its IRR. Likewise, modification of government contracts after the same had been awarded after a public bidding, is not allowed because such modification serves to nullify the effect of public bidding and whatever advantages the Government had secured thereby and may also result in manifest injustice to other bidders.



	13)	We recommended that Management strictly comply with Section 7-Preliminary Design and Construction Studies under Annex "G" - Guidelines for the procurement and implementation of contracts for the Design and Build infrastructure projects of RA 9184 and its Revised IRR.



	14)	Management commented that the request dated 19 September 2018 for new location of the projects - NDCP ISD with Multi-Level Parking and Staff/ Transient Quarters was approved by the SND on 08 October 2018 – the date before the issuance of NOA dated 12 October 2018.

 

	15)	Auditor’s Rejoinder:



We maintain our position that the transfer of the buildings to the new site will result in the change of specifications and soil configuration.  Furthermore, changing the project site after the issuance of the NOA is not allowed under NPM No. 090-2013 dated November 25, 2013.



b)	Non-implementation of the projects within the prescribed period



	16)	Section 2 of GPPB Resolution No. 05-2019 prescribes the calibrated actions to ensure timely implementation of infrastructure projects and effective management of the performance of contractors.



Delayed submission of Final Plan and Design



	17)	Based on several communications submitted by the NDCP and interview with the TWG members, the DAEP was submitted on January 31, 2020 and was approved on February 21, 2020. A copy of such document to prove the date of receipt and approval was not presented to the audit team. 



	18)	The Plan and Design of the two projects (located between JSOG and the Golf Range or in front of NDCP main building) was revised and combined into one Final Plan and Design (FPD) which was approved by the SND. It was noted that the FPD was submitted to NDCP on January 31, 2020 only, which is far behind from the deadline cited in the GCC Clause 1.28 of the Special Condition of Contract, or delay of 401 CDs and 335 CDs for Dorm and Quarters, and Academic Buildings, respectively. Details are as follows:

Non-commencement of Construction works after approval of the FPD



	19)	Interview also revealed that due to declaration of Enhanced Community Quarantine in Metro Manila on March 16, 2020, the construction works commenced only in January 2021; thus, the delay in the commencement and completion of construction works. As of December 31, 2020, the two projects have incurred huge negative slippages based on the PERT-CPM.   It should be noted that under GCC Clause 1.28 of Special Conditions of Contract, the commencement of construction works shall be seven days after approval of the FPD. Likewise, on June 1, 2020, Metro Manila was placed under General Community Quarantine. Public and private construction projects are allowed to commence in the areas placed under GCQ and MGCQ subject to strict compliance to the construction safety guidelines for the implementation of infrastructure projects during the COVID 19 pandemic. 



	20)	Inquiry further disclosed that the contractor did not request for contract time extension. 

 

	21)	Despite the failure of the contractor to perform their obligations on time, the NDCP/DND did not impose any sanctions to the defaulting contractor such as forfeiture of security bonds and termination of contracts, among others.



	22)	Further verification revealed that the contractor posted performance security bond totaling ₱521,729,673.00 for Dorm and Quarters buildings and Academic Building to guarantee the performance of its obligation which expired on October 16, 2020 and December 28, 2020, respectively. NDCP then requested that the contractor renew the security bond but the contractor agreed to renew the same provided the contracts will not be terminated.  As of to date, there is  no document to show the renewal of security bond.



	23)	It is informed that Management had already recommended the termination of contract for the project during a meeting on 22 November 2019 and through a Memorandum forwarded to the SND on 10 September 2020 re: Termination of Contract with Verified Report on the Design and Build Projects of NDCP Academics Building, ISD with Amenities and Multi-Lever Parking Building and Transient/Staff Quarters Building with Amenities. However, the SND decided for the continuance of the said projects per recommendation of the Contract Termination Review Committee (CTRC), DND.



c)	Payment of mobilization fees totaling ₱78,259,451.01 as early as 2018 



	24)	Evaluation of documents disclosed that 15 percent mobilization fee for the design and construction of Dorm and Quarters buildings and Academic Building was paid to contractor amounting to ₱20,996,960.41 and ₱57,262,490.60, respectively, or a total of ₱78,259,451.01. Details are as follows:

	25)	We requested for a copy of the project accomplishment to determine the progress of construction activities but said document is yet to be received.  It should be emphasized that project accomplishment is necessary to assist the Management to monitor the status of project implementation and guide in decision making to avoid the wastage of government resources. Based on the submitted documents, only the FPD has been accomplished by the contractor.



	26)	Due to the delay in the completion of the projects, the mobilization fees amounting to ₱78,259,451.01 remained in the custody of the contractor for more than one year. 



	27)	We recommended that Management:



a)	ensure the implementation of projects, monitor closely project accomplishments and address immediately cause/s of delay; 



b)	require the contractor to renew the security bond to guarantee the performance of its obligation; and



c)	enforce liquidated damages from the claim of the contractor equal to at least one tenth (1/10) of one percent of the cost of the unperformed portion of works for every day of delay pursuant to Section 8.1, Annex E of the 2016 RIRR of RA No. 9184



	28)	The Management submitted the following comments:

 

a)	Per DND Memorandum dated 26 July 2018, the SND approved the Preliminary Design and Construction Studies of various projects (Design and Build of the NDCP Staff Quarters and ISD with Multi-Level Parking) for the NDCP.



b)	Per DND Memorandum dated 28 September 2018, the SND approved the Preliminary Design Construction of NDCP Academic Building and Amphitheater Classroom including Outside Utilities and Amenities through Design and Build scheme. The authority for the project is pursuant to No.7, Annex 'G" of the Revised IRR of RA 9184.



c)	On the enforcement of LD, the NDCP will comply on the provisions regarding the liquidating damages based on the date of receipt of the contractor of the SND approved Design Architectural and Engineering Plan (DAEP) dated 21 February 2020 or the approved for construction by the AFP Building Official on 8 March 2020.

Procurement of COVID response items through piecemeal basis



2)	Procurement of COVID-19 response items from Joneco Tech Marketing Corp. and Medstation Biologicals Inc. totaling ₱678,100.00 was conducted through piecemeal basis instead of bulk purchase as required in Section 8, Article III of RA 9184; thus, the government was not able to take advantage of the volume discount and lower prices. 



	1)	Section 8 Article III of RA 9184 provides that:



Xxx To take advantage of the significant built-in efficiencies of the G-EPS and the volume discounts inherent in bulk purchasing, all procuring entities shall utilize the G-EPS for the procurement of common supplies in accordance with the rules and procedures to be established by the GPPB. With regard to the procurement of non-common use items, infrastructure projects and consulting services, agencies may hire service providers to undertake their electronic procurement provided these service providers meet the minimum requirements of the GPPB. 



	2)	In the review of the procurement of COVID-19 response items/supplies totaling ₱678,100.00, it was noted that three Purchase Orders (POs) were prepared.

	3)	The procurement of COVID-19 response items was in reference and compliance to the: a) DOH AO No. 2020-0015 dated April 27, 2020 re: Guidelines on the Risk-Based Public Health Standards for COVID-19 mitigation; b) DND Memorandum dated May 12, 2020 on Minimum Health Standards (MHS) for COVID-19 Mitigation and Establishment of AWA; and 3) SOP on Internal Guidelines on NDCP Health Standards dated June 5, 2020.



	4)	Evaluation of procurement of COVID-19 response items/supplies intended for the NDCP employees and offices showed that three POs were prepared instead of consolidating it in one PO.



	5)	As a result, the Management lost its chance or opportunity to get more items in less or reduced price and maybe freebies when buying in bulk rather than on a piecemeal basis, which could have been more advantageous on the part of the Agency.



	6)	Management explained that the procurement of COVID-19 response items was made to ensure NDCP’s adherence to the guidelines of the Department of Health (DOH), DND, and NDCP internal guidelines to control the spread of the COVID-19.



	7)	We recommended that Management stop the practice of purchasing on a piecemeal basis to avail of a better price/offer from prospective suppliers.





Programs and Projects Related to Gender and Development (GAD), Senior Citizens (SC) and Persons with Disability (PWD), and the Youth



3)	The NDCP failed to comply with the mandatory requirement of allocating at least five percent of the total appropriations for GAD programs, projects and activities contrary to Section 31 of the General Provisions of the GAA for FY 2020. Moreover, three activities with budget allocation of ₱290,000.00 reported no physical and financial accomplishments for the year while expenses for one activity exceeded its approved budget. 





	1)	Section 31 of the General Provisions of GAA FY 2020 states that all agencies of the government shall formulate a GAD Plan designed to address gender issues within their concerned sectors or mandate and implement applicable provisions under R.A. No. 9710 or the Magna Carta of Women, Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the Beijing Platform for Action, the Philippine Plan for Gender-Responsive Development (1995-2025), and the Philippine Development Plan (2017-2022).



	2)	The GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of the agencies, which shall be at least five percent of their budgets. For this purpose, activities currently being undertaken by agencies which relate to GAD or those that contribute to poverty alleviation, economic empowerment especially of marginalized women, protection, promotion, and fulfilment of women's human rights, and practice of gender-responsive governance are considered sufficient compliance with said requirement. Utilization of the GAD budget shall be evaluated based on the GAD performance indicators identified by said agencies.



	3)	Analysis of GAD AR revealed that the NDCP allocated only ₱1,705,000.00 or 1.92 percent of its total appropriations amounting to ₱88,609,000.00 for GAD programs, projects and activities contrary to the afore-cited provisions.  Out of the allocated amount, only ₱768,378.24 or 45.07 percent of the budget was utilized; thereby, leaving an unutilized amount of ₱936,621.76.  Details of accomplishments and corresponding expenditures are as follows:

	4)	As can be gleaned from the above table, three of the programmed activities were not implemented; one activity (Drafting and presentation of the GAD/NAPWPS/MOVE 1st-3rd Quarters ARs) was implemented but not among the programmed activities; and expenses for Conduct research/policy briefs on current gender issues such as women in conflict areas amounting to ₱320,657.48 exceeded its budget of ₱170,000.00.



	5)	In addition, the GAD AR submitted for CY 2020 was only a draft copy of the report and not the final copy, as endorsed and approved by PCW.



	6)	We reiterated our recommendations that Management: 



a)	instruct the GAD focal person to submit copy of the endorsed/approved GPB by the PCW to COA; 



b)	instruct the officials concerned to submit explanation why expenses for one activity exceeded its approved budget; and



c)	allocate at least five percent of the total annual budget for the implementation of GAD related activities as required under Section 36 (a) of RA No. 9710 or the Magna Carta of Women and Section 31 of the GP of GAA for FY 2020. 

	7)	Management submitted the following comments:



	a)	To justify why the allocated budget was far below the five percent, Management explained that while recognizing the mandatory requirement of allocating at least five percent of the total appropriations for GAD-related activities, the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the normal functions of the College, affecting the conduct of programs, fora, lectures, and services dedicated to GAD.



	b)	On the submission of the endorsed/approved GPB to COA, the Management commented that the College drafted a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Institutionalization and Mainstreaming of GAD Mandates and Advocacy of NDCP.  The policy aims to ensure the timely procedure of endorsing the NDCP GAD Plan and Budget to the PCW and the COA.



	c)	On the activities with no actual output, the Management explained that they struggled adjusting to the new normal due to the personnel limitations which ultimately affected the implementation of the programmed activities. As the pandemic limits the mobility, however, the College maximized the fulfillment of its mandate as a research institution by publishing an Executive Policy Brief (EPB) on the “Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Filipino Women in the Security Sector: Implications to Policy”, producing EPB on “AFP Women Peacekeepers: Contribution to UN Peacekeeping Operations”, and conducting the “Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) Book Project.







Programs for Senior Citizen (SC) and Persons with Disability (PWD) and the Youth

	9)	Also, Section 33 of the GP of the GAA 2020 provides that all agencies of the government shall provide allocation for youth development projects and activities, which shall include government internship opportunities, within the framework of the Philippine Development Plan (2017-2022).



	10)	NDCP was able to formulate, allocate budget, and implement one activity related to SCs and PWDs while three activities were instigated for youth development projects.
