C)	Scope of Audit



The audit covered the accounts and operations of the NDCP for CY 2020.





D)	Independent Auditor’s Report



An unmodified opinion was rendered on the fairness of presentation of the financial statements of the NDCP as of December 31, 2020. 



   

E)	Significant Observations and Recommendations 



1)	Gaps in planning, monitoring and supervision of two Design and Build projects of the agency with contract cost of ₱521,729,673.46 resulted in delayed implementation of the projects caused by change of project site. Moreover, mobilization fees amounting to ₱78,259,451.01 were paid to contractor in 2018 and 2019 but the project construction works have not yet been started as of December 31, 2020.



We recommended that Management: (a) strictly comply with Section 7-Preliminary Design and Construction Studies under Annex "G" - Guidelines for the procurement and implementation of contracts for the Design and Build infrastructure projects of RA 9184 and its Revised IRR; (b) ensure the implementation of projects, monitor closely project accomplishments and address immediately cause/s of delay; (c) require the contractor to renew the security bond to guarantee the performance of its obligation; and (d) enforce liquidated damages from the claim of the contractor equal to at least one tenth (1/10) of one percent of the cost of the unperformed portion of works for every day of delay pursuant to Section 8.1, Annex E of the 2016 RIRR of RA No. 9184.



2)	Procurement of COVID-19 Response Items with Joneco Tech Marketing Corp. and Medstation Biologicals Inc.  totaling ₱678,100.00 was conducted through piecemeal basis instead of bulk purchase as provided in Section 8, Article III of RA 9184; thus, the government was not able to take advantage of volume discount and lower prices. 



We recommended that Management stop the practice of purchasing on a piecemeal basis to avail of a better price/offer from prospective suppliers.



3)	The NDCP failed to comply with the mandatory requirement of allocating at least five percent of the total appropriations for GAD programs, projects and activities contrary to Section 31 of the General Provisions of the GAA for FY 2020. Moreover, three activities with budget allocation of ₱290,000.00 reported no physical and financial accomplishments for the year while expenses for one activity exceeded its approved budget. 



We reiterated our recommendations that Management: (a) instruct the GAD focal person to submit copy of the endorsed/approved GPB by the PCW to COA; (b) instruct the officials concerned to submit explanation why expenses for one activity exceeded its approved budget; and (c) allocate at least five percent of the total annual budget for the implementation of GAD related activities as required under Section 36 (a) of RA No. 9710 or the Magna Carta of Women and Section 31 of the GP of GAA for FY 2020. 



The foregoing observations and recommendations were discussed with concerned officials of the agency during the virtual exit conference conducted on March 5, 2021.  Management’s views and comments were incorporated in this report, where appropriate.





F)	Status of Implementation of Prior Year’s Audit Recommendations



The nine audit recommendations contained in the CY 2019 Annual Audit Report were fully/considered implemented. Details are shown in Part III of this report.
