Chairman of the Board of Trustees



HERBERT GLENN P. REYES, Ph.D

SUC President I



Northwestern Mindanao State College of Science and Technology

Labuyo, Tangub City



Dear Chairman Darilag and SUC President Reyes:



We are pleased to transmit the Annual Audit Report (AAR) of the Northwestern Mindanao State College of Science and Technology, Tangub City, for the Calendar Year 2020 in compliance with Section 2, Article IX-D of the Philippine Constitution and Section 43 of Presidential Decree No. 1445, otherwise known as the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines.



The audit was conducted to: (a) ascertain the degree of reliance that may be placed on Management’s assertions on the financial statements; (b) determine the propriety of transactions as well as the extent of compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations; (c) recommend agency improvement opportunities; and (d) determine the extent of implementation of prior years’ audit recommendations.



The attached report consists of Part I – Audited Financial Statements, Part II – Observations and Recommendations, and Part III – Status of Implementation of Prior Years’ Audit Recommendations, which were discussed with the officials and staff concerned last February 17, 2021.



We conducted our audit in accordance with applicable International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAIs) and we believe that these standards provided a reasonable basis for our opinion.



The auditor rendered a modified-qualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the financial statements of the College for the calendar year, due to the following:



1)	A discrepancy of ₱55,180,596.00 between the balance per general ledger and subsidiary ledgers of the Accounts Receivable account was found thereby unfavorably affected its accuracy which is inconsistent with the fair presentation and completeness requirements of the Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standard 1; 

2)	A total of ₱14,735,053.44 were obligated without proper supporting documents, thus overstating the Accounts Payable and Expense accounts which is inconsistent with Section 4 of PD 1445 and with the fair presentation and completeness requirements of the Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standard 1; and



3)	Unserviceable items of Property, Plant and Equipment are still maintained in the books of accounts of the College which is inconsistent with the requirement under Paragraph d, Section 40, Chapter 10 of the Government Accounting Manual for National Government Agencies, thus overstating the account by ₱6,204,753.57.



The details of the above and other observations and recommendations are discussed in detail on Part II of the report.



We request that the recommendations be immediately implemented and we will appreciate being informed of the action(s) taken thereon by duly accomplishing the attached Agency Action Plan and Status of Implementation (AAPSI) and submit it within 60 days from receipt of this report, pursuant to Section 89 of the General Provisions of the General Appropriations Act of 2019.



We express our appreciation for the invaluable support and cooperation extended by the officials and staff of that Agency to the Audit Team which facilitated the completion of the report.

ANNUAL AUDIT REPORT





ON THE 





NORTHWESTERN MINDANAO STATE COLLEGE

OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY

Tangub City, Misamis Occidental



 













For the Year Ended December 31, 2020





EXECUTIVE SUMMARY



A)	  INTRODUCTION



The Northwestern Mindanao State College of Science and Technology (NMSCST) located in Labuyo, Tangub City, was created on July 30, 2001 through Republic Act (RA) No. 9146.  On January 10, 2019, the College was conferred university status through RA 11186, to be known as the University of Northwestern Mindanao. The College is in the process of complying with the requirements of the Commission on Higher Education pertinent to universityhood as of this writing. To carry out its functions, programs and activities, the State College is headed by Herbert Glenn P. Reyes, Ph.D as the SUC President, who assumed office on October 18, 2019, with a total workforce of 277 personnel composed of 128 teaching staff and 149 administrative staff.



Effective January 1, 2014, NMSCST has implemented the Unified Accounts Code Structure for all financial transactions and adopted the Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standards (PPSAS) for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure requirements of financial reporting.



Audit Methodology



The Commission on Audit has been implementing risk-based audit in the conduct of its audit services.  However, to meet the evolving developments in public governance and fund Management, the results-based approach in audit was incorporated.  The integration of these two approaches, called Integrated Results and Risk-Based Audit (IRRBA) Methodology, was applied in the audit of the accounts and operations of the NMSCST.



Scope of Audit



Financial and compliance audit was conducted on the accounts and operations of NMSCST covering the period January 1 to December 31, 2020.  The audit consisted of review of operating procedures, evaluation of the NMSCST’s programs and projects, interview of concerned government officials and employees, verification, reconciliation, and analysis of accounts, and such other procedures considered necessary.  



B)	FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS



For CY 2020, the total allotments received by the NMSCST was P173,513,619.00 out of which total obligations of P172,983,532.74 were incurred, leaving an unexpended balance of P530,086.26 as at year-end, the details of which are presented below:

D)	INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



The Auditor rendered a modified-qualified opinion on the fairness of the presentation of the financial statements of the College for calendar year 2020 due to the inconsistencies between general and subsidiary ledgers of the Accounts Receivable by ₱55,723,096.00 and in the Property, Plant and Equipment by ₱6,204,753.57.

			

E)			SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



In addition to the above findings on which the modified-qualified opinion was based, the following are other significant audit observations and recommendations which were discussed with the concerned Management officials in the exit conference conducted on February 17, 2021:



1)	Specific budgetary allocation of the Special Trust Fund as required by Section 6 of CHED Memorandum Order No. 20, s. 2011 was not observed by the College thereby rendering obligations and eventual disbursements thereof in excess of the budgetary allocation. 



We recommended Management to (1) observe the prescribed budgetary allocations in the preparation of the program of receipts and expenditures; and (2) submit documents showing the declaration of savings and the approval of the Board of Trustees for their use as recommended by the College President in consultation with the Administrative Council.



2)	Payments of per diem to the members of the board of trustees for their attendance in meetings for the purpose of policy making, expenses of the same meetings, and payments of professional fees to members of the finance committee totaling ₱317,665.00 were charged to the Special Trust fund thereby falling inconsistent with Paragraph d, Section 4 of RA 8292 and the clarification made in Benguet State University vs. COA, G.R. No. 169637. 



We recommended Management to obligate payments of similar nature or those related to the subject transactions against the appropriation of the College.  



3)	Goods and services procured during the year through alternative modes of procurement totaling ₱2,790,695.62 were not duly supported with the mandatory documentary requirement as per Appendix A, Annex H of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of RA 9184 thus, adversely affecting the validity of the payments thereto. 



We recommended Management to attach complete supporting documents in the purchase, acquisition, and payment of goods and services in accordance with the mandatory requirements of the procurement law, and require the above-enumerated suppliers to submit the necessary documents within 30 days from receipt hereof.



4)	Payments for fuel totaling ₱454,267.52 did not undergo competitive in violation of Section 10 of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of RA 9184, or the Rule XVI of the same IRR on alternative methods of procurement. Moreover, payments were made on supporting documents which have various deficiencies due to weak internal control.



We recommended Management to procure fuel through competitive bidding or through the alternative method of procurement in order to extend equal opportunity to enable private contracting parties who are eligible and qualified to participate. Likewise, we recommended to strengthen the internal control over fuel consumption.



F)	STATUS OF AUDIT SUSPENSIONS, DISALLOWANCES AND CHARGES



Total suspensions at the beginning of the year was ₱3,549,859.05 while total suspensions issued during the year is ₱24,680,089.78, of which ₱3,549,859.05 was settled during the year, leaving an unsettled amount of ₱24,680,089.78 at year-end.  On the other hand, total disallowances issued during the year is ₱1,169,683.68, in addition to the beginning balance of ₱2,027,250.00, bringing the total disallowances to ₱3,196,933.68, all awaiting resolution from the Office of the Regional Director of the appeal memoranda filed by the College. No notice of charge was issued during the year. The details of this status is shown on page 75 of this audit report.





G)	STATUS OF IMPLEMENTATION OF PRIOR YEARS’ AUDIT RECOMMENDATIONS



Of the 37 prior years’ audit recommendations, 14 was fully implemented, 7 partially implemented, 3 not implemented, and 13 were reiterated in this report. Out of the 13 reiterated findings, 8 were partially implemented and 5 were not implemented.

Independent Auditor’s Report





The President and the Board of Trustees

Northwestern Mindanao State College of Science and Technology

Labuyo, Tangub City



Modified - Qualified Opinion



We have audited the financial statements of the Northwestern Mindanao State College of Science and Technology, which comprise the statement of financial position as at December 31, 2020, and the statement of financial performance, statement of changes in net assets/equity, statement of cash flows and statement of comparison of budget and actual amounts for the year ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.

	

In our opinion, except for the effects of the matters described in the Bases for Audit Modified-Qualified Opinion section of our report, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Northwestern Mindanao State College of Science and Technology as at December 31, 2020, and its financial performance, its cash flows, and its comparison of budget and actual amounts for the year then ended in accordance with International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSASs).

	

Basis for Audit Modified - Qualified Opinion



The Accounts Receivable of the College are carried in the statement of financial position at ₱100,522,296.47 while the total balance of its subsidiary ledgers is ₱155,702,892.47. The discrepancy of ₱55,180,596.00 remained unreconciled as at year-end while ₱3,555,122.13 of which pertain to negative balances. Also, the disposal of unserviceable items still lodged in the Property, Plant and Equipment totaling ₱6,204,753.57 has not been acted thereby overstating the account by the same amount, and understating Impairment Loss by ₱367,182.22. All of these are a departure from the International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (IISSAI).  

	

	We have conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAI). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the agency in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our modified-qualified opinion.

	

	Key Audit Matters

	

	









Except for the matter prescribed in the Basis for Modified-Qualified Opinion section, we have determined that there are no key audit matters to communicate in our report. 

	Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial Statements



Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standards (PPSASs), and for such internal control as Management determines necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.



Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the College’s financial reporting process.



Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements



Our objective is to obtain a reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with PPSSAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of user taken on the basis of these financial statements.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

ALL FUNDS

FOR THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020





1)	General Information/Agency Profile



The consolidated financial statements of Northwestern Mindanao State College of Science and Technology (NMSCST) were authorized for issue on February 4, 2021 as shown in the Statement of Management Responsibility for Financial Statements signed by Dr. Herbert Glenn P. Reyes, SUC President I.



NMSCST is a state college established on 1971 through Republic Act (RA) No. 4878 which was formerly known as Tangub Agro-Industrial School and by virtue of RA 9146 approved on July 30, 2001, the school was converted into a state college and operates under the authority of RA No. 8292, as approved June 6, 1997 which is the Higher Education Modernization Act of 1997 that provides for the uniform composition and powers of the governing boards, the manner of appointment and term of office of the president of chartered state universities and colleges, and for other purposes. The mandate of the state college is to primarily offer higher professional, technical instructions for special purposes and promote research and extension services, advanced studies and progressive leadership in education, agriculture, fishery, engineering, arts and sciences, short-term vocational-technical and other continuing courses as may be relevant.  It shall also provide primary consideration to the integration of researches/studies for the development of the Province of Misamis Occidental. The Agency’s registered office is located in Labuyo, Tangub City.



On January 10, 2019, NMSCST is hereby converted into a state university to be known as the University of Northwestern Mindanao (UNM), hereinafter referred to as the University through Republic Act No.11186. However, the conversion of the institution into a University shall become effective only upon determination and declaration by the Commission on Higher Education (CHED), based on the recommendation of a panel of experts that the institution has complied with the requirements for university status.



As of December 31, 2020, the College is still on the process of complying with the requirements provided by CHED. Therefore, the institution shall retain its status prior to the effectivity of Republic Act No.11186.



2)	Statement of Compliance and Basis of Preparation of Financial Statements



The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with and comply with the Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standards (PPSAS) issued by the Commission on Audit per COA Resolution No. 2014-003 dated January 24, 2014. The financial statements have been prepared on the basis of historical cost, unless stated otherwise.  The Statement of Cash Flows is prepared using the direct method.



3)	Summary of Significant Accounting Policies



	1)	Basis of accounting



The financial statements are prepared on an accrual basis in accordance with the Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standards (PPSAS).



	2)	  Cash and cash equivalents



Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and cash at bank. For the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term deposits as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.



	3)	 Inventories



Inventory is measured at cost upon initial recognition. To the extent that inventory was received through non-exchange transactions (for no cost or for a nominal cost), the cost of the inventory is its fair value at the date of acquisition.



Costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location and conditions are accounted for, as follows:



--	Raw materials: purchase cost using the weighted average cost method

--	Finished goods and work in progress: cost of direct materials and labor and a proportion of manufacturing overheads based on the normal operating capacity, but excluding borrowing costs



After initial recognition, inventory is measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. However, to the extent that a class of inventory is distributed or deployed at no charge or for a nominal charge, that class of inventory is measured at the lower of cost and current replacement cost. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of operations, less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale, exchange, or distribution.

 

Inventories are recognized as an expense when deployed for utilization or consumption in the ordinary course of operations of the state college.



	4)	Property, Plant and Equipment



Recognition



An item is recognized as property, plant, and equipment (PPE) if it meets the characteristics and recognition criteria as a PPE.



The characteristics of PPE are as follows:



--	tangible items;

--	are held for use in the production or supply of goods or services, for rental to others, or for administrative purposes; and

--	are expected to be used during more than one reporting period.



An item of PPE is recognized as an asset if: 



--	It is probable that future economic benefits or service potential associated with the item will flow to the entity; and

--	The cost or fair value of the item can be measured reliably.



Measurement at Recognition



An item recognized as property, plant, and equipment is measured at cost.

A PPE acquired through non-exchange transaction is measured at its fair value as at the date of acquisition.



The cost of the PPE is the cash price equivalent or, for PPE acquired through non-exchange transaction its cost is its fair value as at recognition date. 



Cost includes the following:

--	Its purchase price, including import duties and non-refundable purchase taxes, after deducting trade discounts and rebates;

--	expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items; and

--	Initial estimate of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site on which it is located, the obligation for which an entity incurs either when the item is acquired, or as a consequence of having used the item during a particular period for purposes other than to produce inventories during that period.



Measurement after Recognition



After recognition, all property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.



When significant parts of property, plant and equipment are required to be replaced at intervals, NMSCST recognizes such parts as individual assets with specific useful lives and depreciates them accordingly. Likewise, when a major repair/replacement is done, its cost is recognized in the carrying amount of the plant and equipment as a replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied. 



All other repair and maintenance costs are recognized as expense in surplus or deficit as incurred.



Depreciation



Each part of an item of property, plant, and equipment with a cost that is significant in relation to the total cost of the item is depreciated separately.



The depreciation charge for each period is recognized as expense unless it is included in the cost of another asset.



Initial Recognition of Depreciation



Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use such as when it is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.  



For simplicity and to avoid proportionate computation, the depreciation is for one month if the PPE is available for use on or before the 15th of the month.  However, if the PPE is available for use after the 15th of the month, depreciation is for the succeeding month.



Depreciation Method



The straight line method of depreciation is adopted unless another method is more appropriate for agency operation.



Estimated Useful Life



NMSCST uses the Schedule on the Estimated Useful Life of PPE by classification prepared by COA.



NMSCST uses a residual value equivalent to at least five percent (5%) of the cost of the PPE.



Impairment



An asset’s carrying amount is written down to its recoverable amount, or recoverable service amount, if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable service amount.



Derecognition



NMSCST derecognizes items of property, plant and equipment and/or any significant part of an asset upon disposal or when no future economic benefits or service potential is expected from its continuing use. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the surplus or deficit when the asset is derecognized.



	1)	Changes in accounting policies and estimates



NMSCST recognizes the effects of changes in accounting policy retrospectively. The effects of changes in accounting policy were applied prospectively if retrospective application is impractical.



NMSCST recognizes the effects of changes in accounting estimates prospectively by including in surplus or deficit.



NMSCST correct material prior period errors retrospectively in the first set of financial statements authorized for issue after their discovery by:



--	Restating the comparative amounts for prior period(s) presented in which the error occurred; or

--	If the error occurred before the earliest prior period presented, restating the opening balances of assets, liabilities and net assets/equity for the earliest prior period presented.



	1)	Budget Information



The annual budget is prepared on a cash basis and is published in the government website. 



A separate Statement of Comparison of Budget and Actual Amounts (SCBAA) was prepared since the budget and the financial statements were not prepared on comparable basis.  The SCBAA was presented showing the original and final budget and the actual amounts on comparable basis to the budget.   Explanatory comments are provided in the notes to the annual financial statements.



3.7    Measurement Uncertainty



The preparation of financial statements in conformity with PPSAS, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reporting amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of the revenues and expenses during the period.



Estimates were based on the best information available at the time of preparation of the financial statements and were reviewed annually to reflect new information as it becomes available. Measurement uncertainty exists in these financial statements. Actual results could differ from these estimates.



1)	Changes in Accounting Policies



NMSCST adopted the following new accounting policies:



	a)			Implementation of UACS and adoption of PPSAS



On January 1, 2014, Northwestern Mindanao State College of Science and Technology has implemented the Unified the Accounts Code Structure for all financial transactions, and adopted the PPSAS for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure requirements of financial reporting. This accounting change had no significant impact on NMSCST’s financial statements.

AUDIT OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS





















































AUDIT OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



Financial and Compliance Audit





Inconsistent balances between general and subsidiary ledgers – P55.18 million 



1)	A discrepancy of ₱55,180,596.00 between the balance per general ledger and subsidiary ledgers of the Accounts Receivable account was found, thus, unfavorably affected the accuracy of the Accounts Receivable balance which is inconsistent with the fair presentation and completeness requirements of the Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standard 1. 

	

In line with one of the objectives of general purpose financial statements of providing information about the financial condition of the entity and changes in it, Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standard (PPSAS) 1 requires that financial statements shall present fairly the financial position, financial performance, and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in PPSASs. Complementary, the completeness characteristic of financial reporting is likewise prescribed by the same standard and thus mandates that the information in financial statements should be complete within the bounds of materiality and cost.



Comparison of the Accounts Receivable account balance per general ledger and the total balance as per subsidiary ledgers found a material discrepancy of ₱55,180,596.00 as shown hereunder:

Discrepancy

(₱    55,180,596.00)



Further, examination of the subsidiary ledgers, and analysis of management reports and billing statements and their relation with the Accounts Receivable account revealed that the subsidiary accounts of the Income Generating Project carry negative balances. totaling ₱3,555,122.13. Also, the total balance under Fund 161 carries an unreconciled balance of ₱17,245,237.28. 



Inquiry into the cause of these audit observations disclosed that there was a lapse in updating the subsidiary ledgers of the Accounts Receivable of the STF in the years 2016, 2017, and 2018 which resulted to the material discrepancy between records. The subsidiary ledgers of the same account of the IGP, on the other hand, were not kept prior to the assumption of the new Accountant. It has only been in the CY 2020 wherein efforts have been made to properly establish the balances.  



In view of the findings, the accuracy of Accounts Receivable balances presented in the financial statements could not be relied upon due to material differences between records. 



We recommended Management to designate a special committee which will specifically reconcile the discrepancies between relevant Accounts Receivable ledgers, and the negative balances therein.



Management Comment:



Management committed to adhere to the recommendation. 





Accounts payable recorded without supporting documents – ₱14.73 million 



2)	A total of ₱14,735,053.44 were obligated without proper supporting documents thereby overstating the Accounts Payable and Expense accounts which is inconsistent with Section 4 of PD 1445 and with the fair presentation and completeness requirements of the Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standard 1. 

	

Section 4 of P.D. No. 1445 provides that all financial transactions and operations of any government entity shall be governed by the fundamental principles in the disbursement of public funds which include, among others, that claims against government funds shall be supported with complete documentation.



In line with one of the objectives of general purpose financial statements of providing information about the financial condition of the entity and changes in it, Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standard (PPSAS) 1 requires that financial statements shall present fairly the financial position, financial performance, and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in PPSASs. Complementary, the completeness characteristic of financial reporting is likewise prescribed by the same standard and thus mandates that the information in financial statements should be complete within the bounds of materiality and cost.



Verification of individual items included in establishing Accounts Payable at year-end revealed that a number of these were not duly supported with the necessary documents to support its validity. Instances of deviation were found across all funds maintained by the College:

13,969,675.20

328,377.11

TOTAL

₱ 14,735,053.44



The bulk of the accounts payable pertains to purchases of inventory and supplies and acquisition of equipment. Determining the cause of the audit observation revealed that the Accounting unit merely accounts for the reports and documents that the Supply unit, which is primarily responsible for the receipt and issuance of inventory, supplies, and equipment, will submit to them. The Accounting unit saw it necessary for it to record the payables notwithstanding the want in proper documentation since failure to record the same will likewise understate the account and deprive suppliers the timely payment of their goods and services. 



Due to the failure by Management to fully support the transactions recorded as payable for CY 2020, the assertion that the expenses actually occurred in the year is thereby rendered doubtful. 



We recommended Management to require all units of the College to submit complete supporting documents to warrant the recording of these as Accounts Payable and require also the Accounting unit to be more prudent and cautious in recording the payables. 



Management Comment:



Management interposed that they ensured that all transactions including its supporting documents are complete, proper and in order, before obligating and recording them as Accounts Payable. However, the transactions cited in the audit findings were nonetheless recorded despite the lack of a few documents in order not to understate the account and to ensure that suppliers are not deprived timely payments for the services rendered and/or goods delivered. Management assured that no payment shall be made without securing the completeness of documents. For future similar transactions, Management committed to strictly follow the rules on the completeness of documents by issuing memorandum to all offices requiring their commitment on the matter. Specifically, the Accounting Unit will exert effort to ask concerned offices to submit documents on a timely basis otherwise appropriate sanctions will be imposed as to be determined by Management. 





Unserviceable items still maintained in the books of account - ₱6.20 million



3)	Unserviceable items of Property, Plant and Equipment are still maintained in the books of accounts of the College which is inconsistent with the requirement under Paragraph d, Section 40, Chapter 10 of the Government Accounting Manual for National Government Agencies thereby overstating the account by ₱6,204,753.57. 

	

Paragraph d, Section 40, Chapter 10 of the Government Accounting Manual for National Government Agencies provides, “All unserviceable property shall be reported in the Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) (Appendix 74). PPE reported in the IIRUP shall be dropped from the books by debiting Impairment Loss-Property, Plant and Equipment (cost of the PPE less Accumulated Depreciation).”



Review of the status of the of items of the Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) as presented in the PPE ledger cards as well as in their respective lapsing schedules found that a material amount representing unserviceable property are still lodged in the subject account consisting of the following balances:

TOTAL

₱  6,204,753.57

₱  367,182.22 



It has not been the practice of the Accounting unit to cause the derecognition of items of PPE which has been evaluated by the Inventory Committee as unserviceable. In effect, based on available records and reports, the total PPE balance is overstated by ₱6,204,753.57, and the Impairment Loss-Property, Plant and Equipment is understated by ₱367,182.22.



We recommended Management to determine actual unserviceable property and prepare the Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property which shall contain such properties. Thereafter, disposal procedures of unserviceable property should be implemented in accordance with applicable rules and regulations on Supply and Property Management Manual, and Sec. 79 of P.D. No. 1445. Also, it is recommended that Management record the necessary adjusting entries to the relevant accounts to achieve faithful representation of the financial statements after the implementation of such procedures. 



Management Comment:



The determination of the subject PPE items as unserviceable was made in CY 2019 in line with the physical count procedures. Based thereon, Management intended to submit request to COA for comment and recommendation of proper action pursuant to the proposed disposal of the PPE items in the first quarter of CY 2020. However, due to some constraints, this was not realized. Thus, in CY 2021, Management committed to conduct physical count in the second quarter and prepare the IIRUP to implement disposal procedures pursuant to the applicable rules and regulations cited.





Long outstanding items of Accounts Payable - ₱511 thousand



4)	A total of ₱511,458.55 in the Accounts Payable account has been outstanding for over 2 years, thus may be reverted to the Accumulated Surplus/Deficit consistent with Section 98 of PD 1445. 

	

Section 98 of PD 1445 provides that the Commission, upon notice to the head of agency concerned, may revert to the unappropriated surplus of the general fund of the national government, any unliquidated balance of accounts payable in the books of the national government, which has been outstanding for two years or more and against which no actual claim, administrative or judicial, has been filed or which is not covered by perfected contracts on record. This section shall not apply to unliquidated balances of accounts payable in trust funds as long as the purposes for which the funds were created have not been accomplished.



Examination of the aging of accounts payable revealed that a number of accounts therein have been outstanding for over two years totaling ₱511,458.55. Also, balances under Funds 164 and 161 of ₱635,053.96 and ₱792,256.87 outstanding for over the same period do not have supporting documents. 



The Accounting unit is in the process of further evaluating the individual items contained in the balance of its Accounts Payable. In prior years, maintaining the documents supporting the validity of claims has not been faithfully observed thereby resulting to the audit observation.  



Keeping these balances in the Accounts Payable result to the overstatement of the said account when no valid documents would warrant the maintenance of the same. 



We recommended Management to revert the individual items of accounts payable which have been outstanding for more than two years to the Accumulated Surplus/Deficit.

Management made sure that all efforts to retrieve the documents will be taken and, thereafter, revert the cited items of Accounts Payable under Fund 101 to the Accumulated Surplus/Deficit. 





Overstated inventory expenses – ₱1.01 million



5)	An understatement of ₱1,008,815.24 in various inventory accounts was found due to the recording as expenses related items which still remained in the custody and control of the Property and Supply Officer, thereby unfavorably affecting the fair presentation of the subject accounts in the financial statements which is inconsistent with the fair presentation and completeness requirements of the Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standard 1.

	

In line with one of the objectives of general purpose financial statements of providing information about the financial condition of the entity and changes in it, Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standard (PPSAS) 1 requires that financial statements shall present fairly the financial position, financial performance, and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in PPSASs. Complementary, the completeness characteristic of financial reporting is likewise prescribed by the same standard and thus mandates that the information in financial statements should be complete within the bounds of materiality and cost.



Section 9, Chapter 8 of the Government Accounting Manual for National Government Agencies also states that supplies and materials purchased for inventory purpose shall be recorded using the perpetual inventory system, resulting in a more accurate inventory records and a running total for the cost of goods sold in each period. It further prescribes that Regular purchases shall be coursed through the inventory account and issues thereof shall be recorded as they take place except for supplies and materials purchased out of PCF for immediate use or on emergency cases which shall be charged directly to the appropriate expense accounts.



Analysis of the inventories and its related accounts, tracing to source documents, physical count of inventories on a test basis, and verification of records found the following audit exceptions:



a)	An approximate total discrepancy of ₱1,008,815.24 between actual inventory of Office Supplies Inventory, Other Supplies and Materials Inventory, and Construction Materials Inventory, as per physical count on a test basis and balances per general ledger of the same accounts;

b)	Direct recording of the following expenses:

a)	Semi-expendable Office Equipment Expenses (Fund 164) of ₱755,460.00;

b)	Semi-expendable Other Machinery and Equipment Expenses (Fund 164) of ₱49,600.00;

c)	Food Supplies Expenses (Fund 161) of ₱147,612.00; and

d)	Other Supplies and Materials Expenses (Fund 161) of ₱13,257.00;

c)	Subsidiary ledger cards are not maintained for regularly purchased inventory items which hindered verification of costing method; and

d)	Stock cards are not updated and are not completely filled with relevant details.



Although the Accounting unit relatively observes the requirements of the manual, these audit observations exist primarily due to the failure on the part of the College to conduct timely physical count procedures. The Accounting unit could have been facilitated by such procedures in the recording of expenses in the proper period had there been a report based thereon that the unit could utilize for the purpose. 



The above-enumerated findings thereby resulted to the understatement of Inventory accounts by ₱1,008,815.24.



We recommended Management the following points:



a)	Indicate in the RSMI such actual issuance of items which should faithfully reflect the actual expense incurred for the period; and

b)	Implement the preparation and maintenance of the subsidiary ledger cards and stock cards duly filled up. 



Management Comment:



Management planned to conduct physical count but, due to some constraints, they failed to do so which was attributed as the cause of the audit finding. However, Management asserted that the expenses recognized in the books of account were duly supported by the RSMI as prepared by the supply unit. Nonetheless, Management manifested that the recommendations are well taken and committed to adhere thereto. 



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



Management’s contention that the supplies expenses recognized in the books were duly supported by RSMI which allegedly warranted their recording as such and supported the credits made against the related inventory accounts thus showing accurate balances in the financial statement while actual physical count showed the existence of a number of items inventories items under the custody and control of the Property and Supply Officer, reduces the issuance of the RSMI a mere formal requirement and negates the qualitative characteristics of financial reporting of substance over form.  





Understated Property, Plant and Equipment - ₱946 thousand



6)	Total net understatement of ₱946,253.98 was found between the balances per general ledger and subsidiary ledgers of the Property, Plant and Equipment account thereby unfavorably affected the accuracy of the related balances which is inconsistent with the fair presentation and completeness requirements of the Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standard 1. 

	

In line with one of the objectives of general purpose financial statements of providing information about the financial condition of the entity and changes in it, Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standard (PPSAS) 1 requires that financial statements shall present fairly the financial position, financial performance, and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in PPSASs. Complementary, the completeness characteristic of financial reporting is likewise prescribed by the same standard and thus mandates that the information in financial statements should be complete within the bounds of materiality and cost.



Comparison of the Property, Plant and Equipment account balances as per general ledger and the corresponding balances as per Property, Plant and Equipment Ledger Cards (PPELC) found material discrepancies as shown hereunder:

The net understatement of ₱459,815.63 found under Fund 101 was derived from an overstatement of ₱21,150.01 and an understatement of ₱480,965.64 in the items therein. The said overstatement in the general ledger balance was due to one Reception Counter, TD1-QT01, 1.8M under the Furniture and Fixture account which has already been derecognized per PPELC in December 2019 but is still maintained in the general ledger. On the other hand, the net understatement of ₱486,438.35 found under Fund 164 was derived from an overstatement of ₱34,000.00 and an understatement of ₱520,438.35 in the items therein. The said overstatement in the general ledger balance was due to four Cubicle Table 2's 120x240x110 under the Furniture and Fixture account which was recorded in the general ledger while only three of such item is supported by the PPELC.



Further, a number of PPE items subjected to inspection on a test basis were not under the custody of their respective accountable officers. 



Inquiry into the cause of these audit observations disclosed that there was a lapse in keeping the PPELC considering that it was only recently when the preparation of the ledger cards was implemented by Management. 



Audit findings account to a net understatement in the Property, Plant and Equipment account by ₱946,253.98. 



We recommended Management the following points:



a)	Review the details contained in the PPELC and record the proper adjusting entries to eliminate the discrepancies noted that may be made to correct the balances; and

b)	Place under the custody and control of the respective accountable officers the PPE items inspected and found to be under the custody of another employee. 



Management Comments:



Management manifested that the observation on the custody and controls of PPE are well taken. 





No proof of title over parcels of land – P581 thousand



7)	The College does not possess any document of conveyance pertaining to the parcels of land costing ₱581,524.91 recorded in the Agency’s Books, thereby casting doubt as to the agency’s rights over the property and reliability of the Land account. 

	

In line with one of the objectives of general purpose financial statements of providing information about the financial condition of the entity and changes in it, Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standard (PPSAS) 1 requires that financial statements shall present fairly the financial position, financial performance, and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in PPSASs. Complementary, the completeness characteristic of financial reporting is likewise prescribed by the same standard and thus mandates that the information in financial statements should be complete within the bounds of materiality and cost.



Tracing to source documents of the balances presented in the financial statements found that the College does not possess any documents of conveyance covering the parcels of land the College has recorded in the accounting books. The details of the balances consist of the following parcels of land:

Based on the above-enumerated details, the College apparently showed nine parcels of land that are currently in the latter’s possession and use. Despite the list of the land titles, such list cannot be weighted as a conclusive evidence of ownership since some of the names appearing on the titles are not in favor of the College. 



Accounting principles necessitate that asset accounts should have the attributes of existence, proper valuation and ownership of items. Thus, the balances must be supported by, among others, legal documents of ownership of property. The documents of conveyance (deed of sale, deed of donation, etc) are prima facie evidences of ownership of land. Such ownership is confirmed by the land title named in favor of the owner. Along with the ownership over the property is the right to possess, use and dispose of the property which is enforceable against the whole world. Ultimately, land improvements and buildings erected on the parcels of land are at stake as the ownership of land maybe contested.



We recommended Management the following points:



a)	Exhaust earnest efforts in retrieving documents of conveyances over the parcels of land evidencing the College’s ownership and their respective amounts booked up; and

b)	Should the titles over the properties appear not yet named in the College’s favor, institute an action for the transfer of title over the parcels of land. 



Management Comment:



Management explained that they have taken initial action on the matter in CY 2019. An employee, who is a Geodetic Engineer, had been designated to determine the necessary course of action needed for the settlement of real property issues. Corresponding budget allocation and time frame of action had likewise been given to said employee, however, due to some constraints, the activities were not realized. Management nevertheless assured that they will exhaust earnest efforts to process the documents of the subject parcels of land in accordance with the approved schedule of activities in CY 2021 to 2023. 





Beyond mandatory budgetary allocation - ₱93 million



8)	Specific budgetary allocation of the Special Trust Fund as required by Section 6 of CHED Memorandum Order No. 20, s. 2011 was not observed by the College thereby rendering obligations and eventual disbursements thereof in excess of the budgetary allocation. 



Section 6 of CHED Memorandum Order (CMO) No. 20, s. 2011 provides the corresponding budgetary allocation for the following functions and relevant areas of the State Universities and Colleges.

Inquiry with Management disclosed that the procedures followed in the preparation of the PRE have been those which were observed in prior years in which compliance with the memorandum order was not implemented. Since the assumption of new officers, the requirements of the memorandum order have yet to be met. The procedure also revealed a discrepancy of ₱8,459,065.13 between balance presented in the Statement of Approved Budget, Utilization and Disbursements and Balances (FAR No. 2) and the PRE of the total STF budget.



It is also worth noting that facilities development was allocated with ₱93,056,934.87 as per PRE which is equivalent to 209% of tuition fees which is far beyond the limit of 12.5% or the equivalent amount of ₱5,576,375.00. Also, a discrepancy of ₱1,699,989.99 was also noted between the total budget for capital outlay per Project Procurement Management Plan and PRE where the former was higher in amount. Management explained that such allocation for capital outlay was funded by Accumulated Savings. The audit team required the submission of documents showing the approval of the Board of Trustees thereof as recommended by the College President in consultation with the Administrative Council. Such submission has not been complied with.



Failure to observe the provisions of the memorandum circular rendered the obligation and disbursement of STF in excess of the prescribed budget allocations. 



We recommended Management the following points:



a)	Observe the prescribed budgetary allocations in the preparation of the program of receipts and expenditures; and

b)	Submit documents showing the declaration of savings and the approval of the Board of Trustees for the use thereof as recommended by the College President in consultation with the Administrative Council.



Management Comment:



Management submitted to the audit findings and committed to comply with the recommendation in the preparation of the CY 2021 Program of Receipts and Expenditures. 





Erroneous obligation of expenses.  – ₱318 thousand



9)	Payments of per diem to the members of the board of trustees for their attendance in meetings for the purpose of policy making, expenses of the same meetings, and payments of professional fees to members of the finance committee totaling ₱317,665.00 were charged to the Special Trust fund thereby falling inconsistent with Paragraph d, Section 4 of RA 8292 and the clarification made in Benguet State University vs. COA, G.R. No. 169637. 



Paragraph d, Section 4 of RA 8292 provides,”…Any provision of existing laws, rules and regulations to the contrary notwithstanding, any income generated by the university or college from tuition fees and other charges, as well as from the operation of auxiliary services and land grants, shall be retained by the university or college, and may be disbursed by the Board of Regents/Trustees for instruction, research, extension, or other programs/projects of the university or college: Provided, That all fiduciary fees shall be disbursed for the specific purposes for which they are collected…”



Consistent thereto, Ricardo E. Rotoras v. COA, G.R. No. 211999 held the decision of COA LAO-National Decision and Resolution which established that the per diem of the governing boards for their attendance in board meetings partakes of the nature of compensation categorized under personal services and thus may only be sourced from an agency's appropriation.



Further, Benguet State University vs. COA, G.R. No. 169637 clarified that meetings of the state university and colleges' governing boards cannot be considered as instruction, research, extension, or any other similar project or program.



Verification of disbursement vouchers relative to expenses found that per diems paid to the members of the board of trustees of their attendance in board meetings and the expenses incurred for the same meetings totaling ₱260,165.00 were charged against the Special Trust Fund (STF). Also, professional fees paid to members of the finance committee were charged to the same fund.

Inquiry with Management as regards the basis for the payment of the subject claims disclosed that they relied upon the provisions of the CHED Memorandum Order No. 20, s. 2011 which prescribes the budget allocation and utilization of the STF. 



The payments of expenses of this nature are inconsistent with the provisions of law and jurisprudence, including clarifications made therein, thus unfavorably affecting the validity of the same. 



We recommended Management to obligate payments of similar nature or those related to the subject transactions against the appropriation of the College.  



Management Comment:



Management interposed that they were under the belief that the subject expenses can be charged under STF as stated in the provisions of the CHED Memorandum Order No. 20, s. 2011 which prescribes the budget allocation and utilization of the STF. In prior years, they have obligated the payments of similar nature pursuant to the same memorandum order. Nevertheless, Management assured faithful compliance with the recommendation in CY 2021. 





Lapses in internal control over employees’ attendance – P7.5 million



10)	Lapses in the internal control on employees’ attendance monitoring resulted to various deficiencies on the Daily Time Records thus, rendering doubtful the propriety of the Daily Time Records as basis for payment of Salaries, and future possible inaccurate payment of leave credit commutation due to unreliable leave credit balances.



Section 2 of P.D. 1445, the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines, provides that it is the declared policy of the State that all resources of the government shall be managed, expended or utilized in accordance with law and regulations, and safeguard against loss or wastage through illegal or improper disposition, with a view to ensuring efficiency, economy and effectiveness in the operations of government. The responsibility to take care that such policy is faithfully adhered to rests directly with the chief or head of the government agency concerned.



Section 123 of the same Presidential Decree defines internal control as “the plan of organization and all the coordinate methods and measures adopted within an organization or agency to safeguard its assets, check the accuracy and reliability of its accounting data, and encourage adherence to prescribed managerial policies.” Further, Section 124 further states that it shall be the direct responsibility of the agency head to install, implement, and monitor a sound system of internal control.



Civil Service Commission (CSC) Memorandum Circular No. 16, s. 2010 dated August 6, 2010 states that:



a)	Any officer or employee who incurs undertime, regardless of the number of minutes/hours, ten (10) times a month for at least two months in a semester shall be liable for Simple Misconduct and/or Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service, as the case may be; and



b)	Any officer or employee who incurs undertime, regardless of the number of minutes/hours, ten (10) times a month for at least two (2) consecutive months during the year shall be liable for Simple Misconduct and/or Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service, as the case may be.



Examination of the payments of salaries and wages to employees disclosed the following instances of deviation out of 246 sample payments totaling ₱7,512,155.48 under the account:



Areas of Deviation

Percentage of Deviation

a)	Manual/Handwritten entries on the DTR of certain employees

89.84%

     Insufficiency of compensating 



     controls:



a)	Certificate of attendance/pass slips

41.87%

i)	Original log entry from the device

2.44%

ii)	Logbook/Certificate of appearance

78.05

b)	No attached Approved Leave Applications

78.05%

c)	No attached Travel Orders/ Pass Slips as well as the Certificates of Appearance for official travels

21.24%

d)	Undertime above 10 times

17.07%



Re-computation of the deduction for undertimes incurred was likewise undertaken on the sample payments which resulted to various instances of deduction of leave credits beyond and below the actual undertime or a net under-deduction with an equivalent value of ₱61,452.83.



Management has formulated policies for the installation of proper internal controls to address such instances of deviation but has yet to faithfully adhere to the provisions of the said policy. Inquiry with Management relative to the reasons for these deviations disclosed that there is no clear assignment as to which office the review of the daily time records is designated, thus leading either office to expect the other to review such records, and resulting to a weak system of review of the supporting documents thereof and the propriety of entries therein.



Due to the insufficiency of documents and controls, the validity of the payments of salaries to employees is not convincingly established. 



We recommended Management the following points:



a)	Strengthen its system of internal control by specifically designating the proper office tasked to review the sufficiency of the supporting documents and the correctness and accuracy of the entries in the daily time record, and to certify the same to that effect; and

b)	Review the undertimes herein noted specifically those corresponding to the equivalent value of ₱61,452.83 and deduct accurate credits corresponding to such undertimes from the vacation leave credits.



Management Comment:



Management manifested that it has existing policies for the installation of proper internal controls relative to the subject transactions. However, for the past years, they admitted to have met some challenges that hindered the faithful compliance with the said policy. Nonetheless, Management, through the Accounting and Human Resources Units, committed to exhaust all means to strengthen the system of internal controls to address the lapses and deficiencies noted. In line with such objective, the Joint Administrative and Academic Council likewise issued Policy No. III on the rules, regulation and procedures in the disbursement of employees’ payroll, among other initiatives.





Leave monetization not in accordance with prescribed conditions - ₱459 thousand



11)		Leave monetization amounting to ₱459,209.05 were paid under reasons which are beyond the contemplation of those considered valid and justifiable thus falling inconsistent with Sections 22 and 23 of the Omnibus Rules on Leave.



Section 22 of the Omnibus Rules on Leave (Rule XVI of the Omnibus Rules Implementing Book V of Executive Order No. 292) states that officials and employees in the career and non-career service, whether permanent, temporary, casual or coterminous, who have accumulated 15 days of vacation leave credits shall be allowed to monetize a minimum of 10 days, provided that at least 5 days is retained after monetization and provided further, that a maximum of 30 days may be monetized in a given year.



CSC Memorandum Circular No. 16, series of 2002 provides the amendment of Section 23 of the Omnibus Rules on Leave on monetization of 50% or more of accumulated vacation/sick leave credits which may be allowed for valid and justifiable reason, such as:



a)	Health, medical and hospital needs of the employee and the immediate members of his family;

b)	Financial aid and assistance brought about by force majeure events such as calamities, typhoons, fire, earthquake and accidents that affect the life, limb and property of the employee and his/her immediate family;

c)	Educational needs of the employee and the immediate members of his/her family;

d)	Payment of mortgages and loans which was entered into for the benefit or which inured to the benefit of the employee and his/her immediate family;

e)	In cases of extreme family needs of the employee of his/her immediate family where the present sources of income are not enough to fulfill basic needs such as food, shelter and clothing; and

f)	Other analogous cases as may be determined by the CSC.



Further, CSC Resolution No. 00-0034 clarifies on the subject of leave monetization that as a general rule what is allowed to be monetized are the accumulated vacation leave credits. Section 23, on the other hand, is an extraordinary measure to relieve an employee from financial difficulties that may be allowed only for valid and justifiable reasons subject to the discretion of the agency head and the availability of funds. Hence, Section 23 should be construed as an exception to the general rule as provided under Section 22. Consequently, for purposes of monetization, vacation leave credits must be exhausted first before sick leave credits may be used. 



Verification of the disbursement vouchers and its supporting documents relative to the payments of leave monetization disclosed the following deficiencies:



a)	Sick leave credits were deducted with a portion of those applied for monetization prior to the exhaustion of the vacation leave credits;  

b)	Three payments amounting to ₱341,680.55 for leave monetization exceeded the maximum of 30 days. 

c)	Three payments totaling ₱148,013.36 for leave monetization accounted for 50% of accumulated vacation/sick leave credits of the individual employee thus subject to the relevant conditions. However, the reason presented to support the application for leave monetization was for home renovation which is not among those contemplated by the rules as valid and justifiable.



Inquiry with Management as to the reason for these deficiencies disclosed that there was a mistaken appreciation of the provision relative to the fulfillment of basic needs such as shelter when the rule contemplates such reason to be grounded on extreme financial necessity, which is not the case presented in the applications. 



Moreover, on the subject of the keeping of leave cards, the Paragraph b, Section 25 of same rules state that the mandatory annual five-day vacation leave shall be forfeited if not taken during the year. Section 9 thereof likewise defines teacher’s vacation service credits as such which refer to the leave credits earned for services rendered on activities – during summer or Christmas vacation, as authorized by proper authority. In view of these provisions, the examination of the leave cards found the following deficiencies:



a)	22 out of the 42 presented leave cards of employees of the administrative office and of faculty members with administrative designation do not reflect the mandatory forfeiture of the annual five-day vacation leave;

b)	Days out of the 14 days of Christmas vacation not spent for such vacation due to early opening of classes were credited as service credits earned by faculty members;

c)	27 out of the 39 leave cards which presented service leave credits earned were found to be inconsistent with the certification of service leave credits earned issued by the Human Resources Officer.   



The existence of the deficiencies against the government rules and regulations cast doubt as the validity of the payments of the subject claims.  



We recommended Management to observe the 30-day maximum monetization and, if applicable, carefully evaluate payments for leave monetization especially on such reasons submitted by applicants to properly support their disbursement. Also, we recommend Management to implement the mandatory deduction of the annual five-day vacation leave and to stop accruing automatic leave credits to faculty members on the mere basis that the number of actual vacation days were less than those stated by the rules.



Management Comment:



Management explained that they were under the belief that the reasons asserted by the concerned employees for the application of leave monetization of 50% or more of the accumulated sick/leave credits were valid and justifiable. Taking reference to the auditing finding noted, Management admitted to have a mistaken appreciation of the relevant provisions. Nonetheless, Management committed to take careful evaluation of payments of leave monetization, and to adhere to the recommendations.  





Compensation for additional services - ₱173 thousand



12)	Job Order personnel were paid compensation for services rendered beyond the expected working hours and days totaling P173,819.60 contrary to Paragraph 6.3.1 of CSC-COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 1, s. 2017. 



Paragraph 6.3.1 of CSC-COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 1, s. 2017 provides that the services of a job order (JO) worker is either paid according to an agreed contract amount for the piece of work or on a daily wage basis. 



Result of verification of payments made for services rendered by job order personnel showed that the College paid for those rendered beyond the expected working hours which constitute the payment of additional compensation contrary to the aforementioned legal provision. The sample subjected to audit by this team disclosed total payment of this nature totaling P39,080.64 (See Appendix A).



Further, it was found in the same audit procedure that compensation totaling P134,738.96 (See Appendix B) for additional services rendered beyond the expected working days in a week were likewise paid absent any legal basis thereof and any stipulation to that effect in the contract entered into between the College and the individual JO worker. Also, there is no showing in the supporting documents that the services rendered were indeed beyond their regular or routine work, or beyond such work as are deemed included in the piece of work required in the aforesaid contract. For evaluation purposes as regards the necessity of these services and as to whether these were grounded on reasonable cause, the policy on overtime and the requirements of COA Circular No. 2012-001 were applied in the audit procedure which revealed the following percentages of deviation in key areas found in the sample disbursement vouchers:



Areas

Percentage of Deviation

a)	Nature of Service



a)	Regular/routine work or such work deemed included in the piece of work required in the JO contract;

43.01%

i)	Due to unforeseen event and emergency situations, will the avoiding the rendition of services result to financial loss to the government?

83.94%

ii)	Due to unforeseen event and emergency situations, will the avoiding the rendition of services result to embarrassment to the government due to its inability to meet its commitments?

80.83%

b)	Due to unforeseen event and emergency situations, will the avoiding the rendition of services result to the negation of the purpose for the which the work was conceived?

80.83%

c)	Approved Request

34.20%

d)	Stated necessity and urgency of the work to be done

21.24%

e)	Date of rendition of work to be done

20.21%

f)	Work program

100%

g)	Quantified accomplishment duly signed by the employee and supervisor

99.48%



It is also worth noting that there were five payments for additional services which do not have supporting documents. Also, there were 39 instances amounting to P22,975.00 (See Appendix C) of the sample payments that were charged to the Special Trust Fund (STF) when the transactions therein pertain to Income Generating Project (IGP) operation. This is contrary to the fundamental principle for disbursement of public funds in the aspect of trust funds which must be spent only for the specific purpose for which the trust was created, and to Section 12, CHED Memorandum Order No. 20, s. 2011 which states that maintenance expenses shall be financed out of its collections as soon as the IGP becomes viable, which is obtaining in the case. 



Moreover, with respect to payments to faculty members, who are under contracts of service, payments to them for units in excess of their assigned teaching load remained to be paid even on a few days when the semester ended for school year 2019-2020. Such date was reckoned based on certification, which indicates the last day of the semester, as obtained from the Office of the Vice President for Academic Affairs. Compensation of the such hours or units purportedly served presupposes actual rendition of teaching services. Thus, the absence of any showing supporting such actual occurrence of service unfavorably affects the validity of the transaction. The audit procedure presented total excess payments of P36,197.81 (See Appendix D) as per sample. 



Likewise, the same audit procedures disclosed instances of inaccurate deduction of tardiness, unsupported blank/manual entries to the daily time record, non-deduction of days where employees substantially did not work a certain day due to personal transactions and the like which amounted to P38,407.50.



As per representation with Management, the subject payments were made since these were grounded on valid reasons notwithstanding the want of legal basis therefor. They are also under the contention that no audit finding in this regard has been noted thus warranting their honest belief that the payments were regular. However, the basis of payments for these services nonetheless stands unsubstantial.  



We recommended Management the following points:



a)	Discontinue payment of additional services rendered on weekdays in an amount exceeding their daily wage rate, and of excess teaching load/units on days on which actual services therefor are not rendered or where no proof justifies payment;

b)	Provide in the contract the specific pieces of work and such further details (work hours e.g., 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM, work days e.g., Monday to Friday, and the like) required of the job order personnel, to aid in the determination of what constitutes their regular or routine work, and what are those deemed included in such piece of work required, or provide such details in any official document attached to the contract and forming an integral part thereof;

c)	In similar transactions in succeeding contract periods, incorporate in the contract the payment of additional services for work which must be clearly beyond their regular or routine work, or beyond such work as are deemed included in the piece of work required in the contract subject to the requirement of Item b hereof, and formulate proper control policies therefor;

d)	Subject the payments in Item c to the provisions of Paragraph 6.3.1 of CSC-COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 1, s. 2017 where wages are to be made on a daily basis and not on an hourly basis regardless of the hour requirement of the job; and

e)	Replenish from the IGP funds the total amount of P22,975.00 to the STF for expenses improperly charged against the latter fund;

f)	Properly obligate expenses against the appropriate budget; and

g)	Formulate and implement proper control policies as regards the attendance requirements of employees. 



Management Comment:



Management committed to incorporate in the contract of service the points of the audit recommendation starting CY 2021 as to the inclusion of the specific number of hours and their work in consultation with their legal counsel. 





Lacking mandatory documentary requirements – ₱2.8 million



13)	Goods and services procured during the year through alternative modes of procurement totaling ₱2,790,695.62 were not duly supported with the mandatory documentary requirement as per Appendix A, Annex H of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of RA 9184 thus, adversely affecting the validity of the payments thereto. 



Appendix A, Annex H of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of RA 9184 prescribes for the documents that the BAC shall require from suppliers, contractors and consultants for Alternative Methods of Procurement, except for Repeat Order, Shopping under Section 52.1(a), and Negotiated Procurement under Sections 53.1 (Two-Failed Biddings), and 53.5 (Agency-to-Agency) of the IRR of RA 9184.



The rules require for procurement through shopping and small value procurement the following documents:



	Shopping:

a)	Mayor’s/Business Permit; and

b)	PhiGEPS Registration Number.



Small Value Procurement:

a)	Mayor’s/Business Permit;

b)	Professional License/Curriculum Vitae (Consulting Services);

c)	PhilGEPS Registration Number;

d)	PCAB License (Infra.);

e)	Income/Business Tax Return; and

f)	Omnibus Sworn Statement



Verification on a test basis of the payments of the procurement of goods and services totaling ₱2,790,695.62 revealed these were not supported with the documentary requirements mandated by the rules. There was also no showing that these payments partake the nature of an emergency procurement made during this time of pandemic which could have warranted more lenient documentary requirements since there was no BAC resolution to that effect. The audit team conducted further audit procedures by ascertaining whether these documents were on file but were merely not attached. However, the procedure revealed that these were indeed not on file as well as of those pertaining to suppliers not subjected to this post-audit but whole files were nonetheless verified as shown on the table below:

Inquiry with Management as regards the reason for this practice disclosed that they observe a reckoning amount of P50,000.00 and above only at which amount do they observe the attachment of these requirements. However, the review of these disbursements proved the contrary.



The existence of the deficiencies against the law, rules and regulations unfavorably affected the validity of the payments for the procured goods and services.



We recommended Management to completely support the purchase, acquisition, and payment of goods and services in accordance with the mandatory requirements of the procurement law, and require the above-enumerated suppliers to submit the necessary documents within 30 days from receipt of this report. 



Management Comment:



Management assured to act on the recommendation by communicating with and requiring the identified suppliers to submit the lacking documents, and by assisting those who do not have PhilGEPS certificate to process their registration. Management committed to be more vigilant as regards transactions of similar nature starting in CY 2021, and to correct the cited deficiencies by requiring the submission of the mandatory documents relative to the procurement through SVP and Shopping. 





Rules on cash accountability not faithfully complied with – ₱2.6 million



14)	The Petty Cash Fund reached beyond the set maximum accountability of ₱225,000.00 due to the successive replenishments of the fund which is inconsistent with the Imprest System prescribed under Section 35, Chapter 6 of the Government Accounting Manual for National Government Agencies; while cash advances granted to Special Disbursing Officers totaling P2,613,795.00 were liquidated beyond the reglementary period falling inconsistent with the provisions of COA Circular No. 97-002.



Section 35, Chapter 6 of the Government Accounting Manual for National Government Agencies states that the Petty Cash Fund (PCF) to be set up shall be sufficient for the recurring petty operating expenses of the agency for one month. It shall be maintained using the Imprest System. All replenishments shall be directly charged to the expense account and, at all times, the PCF shall be equal to the total cash on hand and the unreplenished expenses.



COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 sets forth pertinent amended rules and regulations in order to provide for a more efficient and effective control over the granting, utilization and liquidation of cash advances.  It contains, among others, the following provisions:

		

“4.1.1  No cash advance shall be given unless for a legally specific purpose.

4.1.2 No additional cash advances shall be allowed to any official or employee unless the previous cash advance given to him is first settled or a proper accounting thereof is made.

4.1.3 A cash advance shall be reported on as soon as the purpose for which it was given has been served.”



The cash examination of the accounts of the Cashier and one of the Special Disbursing Officers of the Income Generating Project (IGP) unit of the College found that a number of checks representing replenishments of the Petty Cash Fund of the same unit were released while a previous replenishment has not been exhausted thereby resulting to the balance of the fund going beyond the established Petty Cash Fund at ₱225,000.00. The examination found that the balance of the fund ranged from ₱225,018.01 to ₱378,054.16 under the accountability of the Cashier, while, under the accountability of the said SDO, it ranged from ₱225,273.97 to ₱369,848.60. It is also worth noting that the supporting documents of the replenishments showed dates which do not correspond to the periods within which the Petty Cash Fund was deemed to have been expended.  

                

Moreover, the examination of the cash advances revealed that the following grants of which totaling P2,613,795.00 were not timely liquidated:

It should be noted that the date of submission of liquidation reports and supporting documents is based merely on the date indicated in said reports and not based on the official stamp of receipt by the Accountant while such procedure is not integrated in the present accounting system observed by the College. Also, other grants of cash advance were not included in the table pending the submission of their liquidation reports where one of which involved one accountable officer (AO) not appropriately bonded for disbursement functions. 



Further, funds are exposed to risks of misuse, misappropriation and loss due to the subject delay and which risk is further magnified by the amounts of refund by SDOs in excess of cash advances granted. Until submitted to the Accountant for compliance with the requirement of proper accounting for the cash advance, the following amounts remained at the disposal of the AOs thus, the existence of the identified risk.

We recommended Management to:



a)	Strictly monitor the replenishments of the Petty Cash Fund through careful verification of the supporting documents in order to prevent the attachment of official receipts and invoices which do not pertain to the period covered by such replenishment, except in reasonable and justifiable cases involving minimal number of receipts and invoices;

b)	Avoid granting cash advance to the AO who is not appropriately bonded for the purpose;

c)	Require the concerned AOs to strictly adhere to the rules and regulations on cash advances provided under Section 89 of PD No. 1445 and COA Circular No. 97-002 with emphasis on prompt liquidation and on ensuring that the Accountant properly acknowledges receipt of the liquidation reports; and

d)	Reduce the amount of cash advance to such level as would be reasonably necessary through sound planning of costs of activities. 



Management Comment:



Management attributed the audit finding to the transfer of accountability of the petty cash fund while a number of paid official receipts have not been turned over by the former IGP Director. Successive replenishments of paid official receipts were made under the name of the new AO without prior liquidation of the fund still under the accountability of the former IGP Director. Nevertheless, Management assured that the funds were incurred under the purpose for which they were granted, and disbursements of which were supported with complete documents. As regards the audit finding on the grant and liquidation of cash advances, Management interposed that, despite close monitoring of the same, a number of employees still failed to meet internally set deadlines due to uncertain reasons. The implementation of the issuance of demand letters and quick response notice had been implemented to enforce concerned employees to liquidate. 





Procurement did not undergo competitive bidding - ₱454 thousand



15)	Payments for fuel totaling ₱454,267.52 did not undergo competitive bidding thereby wanting compliance with Section 10 of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of RA 9184, or the Rule XVI of the same IRR on alternative methods of procurement. Moreover, payments were made on supporting documents which have various deficiencies due to weak internal control.



Section 10 of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA 9184 provides that all procurement shall be done through competitive bidding, except as provided in Rule XVI of the same IRR. 



Section 48.1 of the same IRR likewise states, subject to the prior approval of the HoPE, and whenever justified by the conditions provided in this Act, the Procuring Entity may, in order to promote economy and efficiency, resort to any of the alternative methods of procurement provided in this Rule. In all instances, the Procuring Entity shall ensure that the most advantageous price for the Government is obtained.



Paragraph B.1 of COA Circular No. 77-61 mandates that the use of government vehicles shall be properly controlled and regulated. 



Verification on a test basis of the payments of fuel expenses totaling ₱400,528.52 for the year found that all of these transactions did not undergo competitive bidding or subjected to alternative methods of procurement. 



Further, examination of the supporting documents of these subject payments disclosed the following deficiencies:



a)	Driver’s trip tickets were not attached to the disbursement vouchers;

b)	46 invoices were in such form which is not in Annex C, RMC 12-2013;

c)	155 charge invoices were signed by NMSC employees or job order personnel;

d)	19 instances of alterations which were not countersigned by the approving officer;

e)	10 charge invoices were not stamped as paid;

f)	Gas slips, which were used for the approval of the request and issuances of fuel, had the following specific deficiencies:

i)	Not in prescribed form as per Appendix B of the manual on audit for fuel consumption;

ii)	Not prenumbered;

iii)	13 instances where plate numbers were not indicated therein;

iv)	30 instances where purposes were not indicated therein;

v)	4 instances where signatures of requesting personnel were not affixed therein;

vi)	170 instances where names of requesting personnel were not printed therein;

vii)	26 instances where signatures of approving officers were not affixed therein;

viii)	21 instances where names of approving officers were not affixed therein;

g)	The reports of fuel consumption were not in prescribed form.



Inquiry with Management as to the basis for not resorting to competitive bidding or the alternative methods of procurement disclosed that they have attempted to do the same in prior years but no supplier were willing to enter into contract with the College on an account basis. Documents evidencing that indeed procurement procedures were undertaken to that effect were required from Management but none could be submitted. The deficiencies noted in the supporting documents however were due to a weak implementation of a system of control with proper consideration on the specific guidelines of the relevant circular. Management interposed that driver’s trip ticket were prepared but are merely not attached on the vouchers subjected to audit.  



The existence of the deficiencies against the law, rules and regulations rendered the payments of fuel expenses inconsistent with the relevant law and rules.  



We recommended Management to procure fuel through competitive bidding or through the alternative method of procurement in order to extend equal opportunity to enable private contracting parties who are eligible and qualified to participate. Likewise, we recommended to strengthen the internal control over fuel consumption. 



Management Comment:



Management committed to adhere to the recommendation. 





Bond amounts do not correspond accountabilities – ₱68 thousand



16)	Amounts of fidelity bond applied by the College to cover the accountabilities of the Special Disbursing Officers were excessive in relation to the average amount of cash advances granted to them over the period covered by the cash examination thus, paying more for benefit unrealized in violation of Section 7.1 of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997.



Paragraph 7.1 of COA Circular No. 97-002 states that, “Each accountable officer with a total cash accountability of P2,000.00 or more shall be bonded. The amount of bond shall depend on the total accountability of the officer as fixed by the Head of the Agency. An official or employee who has both money and property accountability, shall be bonded only once to cover both accountabilities, but the amount of the bond shall be in accordance with the schedule.”



The cash examination of the accountabilities of the special disbursing officers (SDOs) of the College revealed that a few of these officers have not been granted cash advances over the period of cash examination while a number are covered by fidelity bonds with amounts in excess of their average cash advances as shown below:

Inquiry as to the cause of the audit observation disclosed that the limiting effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the operations of the College contributed to the decreased amounts granted as cash advances. However, details on the movement of accountabilities of SDOs Dagot and Ogdol showed that they have had minimal to no transaction within the period examined even before the onset of the pandemic. 



The existence of the audit finding rendered the application for and the payment of premiums of fidelity bonds to fall short in fulfilling the purpose for which these were availed. Also, payments for fidelity bonds were evaluated to have been made in amounts more than what is necessary based on the needs of the College while taking into account related past transactions.

We recommended to Management to reduce the amount of bond as prescribed in Section 9.1 of the aforementioned Circular, and conduct careful evaluation of proposed applications for fidelity bond to ascertain the practical necessity of availing of the coverage especially so that such applications entail the incurrence of cost.  



Management Comment:



Management contented that practical necessity was ascertained in determining the insurance of the bondable public official. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the planned activities, in consideration of which the amounts of bond were set for each AO, were not realized. Nonetheless, Management committed to adhere to the recommendation. 





Physical count not conducted



17)	Physical count of items of Supplies and Materials Inventory and Property, Plant and Equipment were not conducted by the College thus, falling inconsistent with Section 13 of Chapter 8 and Section 38 of Chapter 10, respectively, of the Government Accounting Manual for National Government Agencies. 



Section 102 of PD 1445 provides for the primary and secondary responsibility for government funds and property. It states that:



“1. The head of any agency of the government is immediately and primarily responsible for all government funds and property pertaining to his agency.

2. Persons entrusted with the possession or custody of the funds or property under the agency head shall be immediately responsible to him, without prejudice to the liability of either party to the government.”



On the subject of physical count of items of Supply and Materials Inventory and Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE), Section 13 of Chapter 8 and Section 38 of Chapter 10 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) dictates that the entity shall have a periodic physical count of such items, which shall be done semi-annually and annually, respectively. Further, as prescribed by the Handbook on Property and Supply Management System, the Inventory Committee shall reconcile the results of the count with the property and accounting records after the physical count. Consistent thereto, the inventory listing of the supplies and materials shall be checked against the stock cards (SC) maintained by the supply officer and to the supplies/ledger cards (SLC) and control accounts maintained by the accounting. On the other hand, the inventory listing of the equipment shall be compared with the property card (PC) maintained by the property/supply officer as against the equipment ledger cards (PPELC) maintained by the accounting and the total thereof shall be reconciled with the control accounts in the general ledger. Thereafter, the results of the foregoing procedures shall be presented on the Reports on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) and Inventories (RPCI) as at December 31 of each year or at a given date. This shall be submitted to the Auditor concerned not later than January 31 of the following year. Equipment found at station and losses discovered during the physical count shall be reported to the Accounting Division/Unit for proper accounting/recording. 



Verification of the preparation and keeping of the control cards, slips and reports by the Accounting and Supply units resulted to the following observations:



a)	The RPCPPE and RCPI has not been submitted as of writing;

b)	No physical count of inventory items was conducted for the first semester of the CY 2020;

c)	The SLCs were not prepared which is necessary for the checking of the inventory sheet against the same cards and the reconciliation with Property and Supply unit records;

d)	The Stock Cards, Requisition and Issue Slips, and Report of Supplies and Materials Issued were not filled with the necessary reference numbers which should afford coherence between records and grant ease in tracing of transactions; and

e)	Report of Supplies and Materials Issued was prepared on a monthly basis. The GAM requires that it be prepared on a daily basis. 



Accounting principles necessitate that asset accounts should have the attributes of existence, proper valuation and ownership of items. Thus, the balances must be supported by, among others, legal documents of ownership of property, e.g. accurate and correct control cards, and proper physical inventory count report. The findings identified herein were due to the lack of a proper property and supply management system which should have been observed in support of the accounting system. Some required procedures are overridden at certain times by personnel of the Property and Supply unit to achieve their desired level of efficiency in the issuance of supplies.



Hence, the aforesaid findings cast doubt on the reliability of the balances presented in the financial statements for the related accounts. Likewise, the integrity of property custodianship could not be attested as a result of the audit exceptions. 



We recommended Management to:



a)	Issue an office order to create an Inventory Committee to conduct complete periodic physical count of Inventory semi-annually and for PPE, once a year, and submit the report of the same duly reconciled with the Accounting unit particularly for the second semester of CY 2020;

b)	Prepare the inventory count sheet and conduct the count in such a manner that will permit the counting of items of PPE and Inventory found at site but not found per record, such as the preparation of an individual count sheet specifically for each room/area. A column in such sheet should be provided where the reference number as to the account code and fund to which an item relates may be indicated;

c)	Prepare and maintain the SLCs and PCs;

d)	Completely fill in the necessary details e.g., reference numbers, in the control card, slips and reports; and

e)	Require the inventory team to record all unserviceable properties in the IIRUP for submission to COA office for inspection and, ultimately, for disposal. 



Management Comment:



Management failed to conduct physical count due to conflicting work from home arrangements of the members of the inventory committee. Management committed to conduct physical count not later than April 30, 2021. 



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



Conflicting work from home arrangement of the members of the inventory committee does not justify the failure to conduct physical count of inventories and PPE. Simple coordination among members could have very well sufficed to address the problem. 





Property, Plant and Equipment not insured - ₱361 million 



18)	A total of ₱361,634,104.73 of School Buildings and its contents are not placed under insurance coverage as required by Republic Act No. 656 thereby exposing government property to risks of damage or loss due to fortuitous events. 

	

Republic Act No. 656, otherwise known as the Property Insurance Law, that every government, except a municipal government below first class, insure its properties to indemnify or compensate the Government any damage to or loss of, its properties due to fire, earthquake, storm or other casualty there is. This includes vessels and craft, motor vehicles, machineries, permanent buildings, properties stored therein, or in buildings rented by the Government, or properties in transit.



Verification as to whether the property, which is defined by the Act as such which includes vessels and crafts, motor vehicles, machineries, permanent buildings, properties stored therein, or in buildings rented by the Government, or properties in transit, of the College are covered by appropriate insurance found that only two of 4 motor vehicles were insured. Thus, all other insurable property were not placed under insurance coverage for CY 2020 with the following balances:

The failure of the College to comply with the requirements of the law due to mere omission on the Property and Supply Officer’s end exposed government property to risks of damage or loss due to fortuitous events and may render the fidelity bond availed for the Property and Supply Officer for his property accountability defeated through remiss in his responsibility. 



We recommended Management to immediately file an application for insurance over the aforementioned property as required by RA 656, and to follow the procedures set forth in COA Circular No. 2018-002. 



Management Comment:



Management committed to submit their application for insurance at the Government Service Insurance System, Dipolog City, not later than March 31, 2021. 





Compliance with Tax Laws



The agency complied with the internal revenue regulations in the withholding and remitting of taxes withheld from the salaries of the employees of the College and its suppliers. As of December 31, 2020, the agency was able to withhold the amount of ₱9,976,349.15 and remitted ₱10,280,130.38, which included the amount of ₱889,067.00 pertaining to the net balance as of the year 2019, thereby arriving a net balance of ₱585,285.77 as Due to BIR.

	Gender and Development

	

	The College attributed a total of ₱4,050,055.00 to various activities for CY 2020 which is ₱4,546,825.96 less than the required amount of attribution based on at least five percent of the total agency budget appropriations authorized under the annual GAA. Further, out of 13 related activities planned for CY 2020, only 2 were implemented due to restrictions primarily brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. Both of these observations deprive the stakeholders of the benefits afforded by the law consistent with the objective of achieving gender equality.

	  

	

	Disaster Risk Reduction and Management

	

	The College had procured a number of semi-expendable equipment in line with disaster risk reduction and Management. However, it is still recommended that the agency formulate substantive programs related thereto or participate in any disaster activities conducted by accredited organizations in compliance with Section 36 of the GAA for FY 2020.





Senior Citizens and Differently-abled Persons

	

	Most buildings of the college were not designed with ramp to cater to the needs of senior citizens and differently-abled persons. Also, the College has yet to operate the elevator in the new administrative building. 

	

	

Disbursement Acceleration Program (DAP) Fund

	

	No DAP Fund was received by the NMSCST during the year.

Observations and Recommendations

Reference

Action Taken By Management

Results of Auditor’s Validation

CY 2019







1.	The balances and transactions between entities/funds within the University were not eliminated as a matter of accounting practice thus failing to meet the requirements of Paragraph 46 of the Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standard 6 thereby overstating Accounts Payable by ₱3,578,042.06, and eventually producing the effect of overstated expenses, liabilities and income in the consolidated financial statements for CY 2019.



AAR CY 2019



Finding No. 1

Management updated subsidiary ledgers which it considered key to reconcile the subject transactions. 



Also, Management is working on the formulation of policies for the preparation of the IGP Manual. 

Fully Implemented



Intra-agency transactions duly accounted and related accounts properly eliminated in line with financial statement consolidation.  

Identify intra-agency transactions and thereafter comply with the requirements of Paragraph 46 of the PPSAS 6 in the preparation of consolidated financial statements;



Effect the suggested accounting entries; and 



Implement a proper inventory and cost monitoring systems in the IGP operation. Costs for each event served or for any IGP activity for that matter must be specifically and accurately accounted for.









2.	Semi-Expendable Machinery and Equipment, and Furniture, Fixture and Books totaling ₱12,401,238.85 were still maintained in the accounting records as asset when these have already been issued to end-users in CY 2019 which is inconsistent with the fair presentation requirement of PPSAS 1 thereby overstating total assets and understating total expenses by the same amount.



AAR CY 2019



Finding No. 2

Management prepared the necessary adjusting entries based on the issuance of Report of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI). 



Monthly submission of RSMI was also observed. 





Fully Implemented



JEV Nos. GF-20202-04-357, TF-2020-04-717, and IGP-2020-04-171 verified based on RSMI. 



ICS issued and kept by the Supply Office.

While an Accounting unit representative is part of the inventory count committee, require such representative to report any observation which may find relevance to the financial statements such as the subject finding; 



Require the Property and Supply unit to promptly and accurately report the movements of supplies and inventory to Accounting unit; and



Strictly observe the issuance and keeping of ICS in order to establish accountability over semi-expendable assets.









3.	A total of ₱12,348,055.49 were obligated without proper supporting documents which is inconsistent with the requirement of valid claims documents of Section 4 of PD 1445.



Require the Supply unit to submit complete supporting documents to warrant the recording of these as Accounts Payable; and



Submit to this Office the Schedule of Accounts Payable with each item supported with proper documents. If payment has been made in January 2020 and related documents have been attached to its disbursement voucher, an indication of the disbursement voucher number may be indicated as reference in said schedule to do away with the re-submission of the same supporting documents.



AAR CY 2019 



Finding No. 3

Management practiced procedures to ensure that all transactions recorded are duly supported. However, the Accounting unit nonetheless recorded payments without complete supporting documents so as not to deprive the suppliers timely payment of goods and services.  

Management however assures that no payment of these payables shall be made unless with complete supporting documents. 



Partially Implemented



Payments of Accounts Payable were monitored during CY 2020 especially those noted in this finding. 



Reiterated in this audit report.  

4.	A total of ₱1,420,934.49 in the Accounts Payable account has been outstanding for over 2 years thus may be reverted to the Accumulated Surplus/Deficit consistent with Section 98 of PD 1445.



Revert the individual items of accounts payable to the general fund and the accumulated surplus of the special trust fund upon certification that these are not covered by perfected contracts on record.



AAR CY 2019



Finding No. 4

Management traced the transactions to make sure that there will be no claims before the Accounting unit will revert it to Accumulated Surplus/Deficit. 

Not Implemented



Consisting items of the Accounts Payable noted were reverted in CY 2020 but recorded back in the same year. 



Reiterated in this audit report. 





5.	A discrepancy of ₱1,161,335.60 was found between the Due to NGAs account of the College and the Due from NGAs/Other Receivables of other national government agencies, among other related audit observations, thereby affecting the reliability of the balance as required under the Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standard 1.



AAR CY 2019



Finding No. 5

Management planned to conduct reconciliation with CHED Regional Office No. 10 records. 

Not Implemented



Management was unable to reconcile the discrepancy. 

Conduct representation with CHED Regional Office No. 10 in order to identify in which areas their records differ; and



Submit to this Office the result of the comparison of records.











6.	A substantial amount of collections for cash sales in the University food court and food outlet was not remitted by the concerned Income Generating Project Director within the cash examination period September 1, 2017 and July 11, 2019, respectively, which resulted to the total net unremitted collection of ₱7,838,536.38 as of cash count date, July 11, 2019, thereby falling inconsistent with Section 69 of Presidential Decree 1445.



Remit immediately the outstanding cash collections of ₱7,838,536.38;



Immediately formulate and implement proper inventory system to monitor merchandise inventory received and finished goods made, and those sold therefrom and formulate an official policy relative to the monitoring of dishes served at both food stations and the corresponding percentage of mark-up on cost to be observed and the like; 



Likewise, immediately formulate and implement proper system of placing orders which must be supported with pre-numbered order slips, when practicable, the procurement of which must be in accordance with law and that the blank sets of which must be received upon delivery by the Supply Officer who shall likewise monitor the issuance of such sets; 



File an application for the permit to use CRM to the Bureau of Internal Revenue and procure a serviceable CRM for FC operation, otherwise, AF 51 must be issued for every cash sales transaction;



Summarize total daily collections with corresponding items of sales in a Cash Receipts Record;



Remit collections from FC and FO sales to the University Cashier on a daily basis. Pick up or transport of collections from the FO must be done by a regular employee who is covered with appropriate fidelity bond or by an authorized employee who should act upon said task under the accountability of the former;



Submit official statements prepared by the Cashier and the Accountant as to the actions they took relative to the non-remittance by the IGP Director particularly treating on the subject of lack of or poor action, as the case may be, on their part from first month of non-remittance; and



Relieve the IGP Director from acting on the responsibilities pertaining to the office only. The subject liabilities however subsist.  



AAR CY 2019 



Finding No. 6

Management matched income and expenses. Also, Management is working on the formulation of policies for the preparation of the IGP Manual. 

Management likewise processed the compliance of documents needed for the pending open cases in BIR. After which, management plans to proceed with the application for the permit t use CRM. 



The Vice President for Administration issued directive to required daily remittance of collections from IGP operation. 



The former Accountant asserts that Management has never failed to follow up and remind the former IGP Director on the matter. 



The former IGP Director was relieved on August 1, 2019 as per Memo Order No. 66, s. 2019.

Partially Implemented



Neither restitution of the shortage nor the submission of the report of matching income and expenses has been submitted to the auditor. 

7.	A total of ₱196,256,151.70 of School Buildings and its contents are not placed under insurance coverage as required by Republic Act No. 656 thereby exposing government property to risks of damage or loss due to fortuitous events.



Immediately file an application for insurance over the relevant property as required by RA 656.



AAR CY 2019



Finding No. 7

Management submitted the application in CY 2020. However, no response has yet been made by GSIS. 

Partially Implemented



Although Management has no control over the timeliness of action of GSIS of applications made to it, it was but appropriate for the former to have requested an update thereon. 



Reiterated in this audit report. 





8.	Cash advances granted to Special Disbursing Officers totaling ₱5,505,494.50 were liquidated beyond the reglementary period and additional cash advances were granted to one officer despite unsettled balances thereby falling inconsistent with the provisions of COA Circular No. 97-002, and resulting to the non-recording of expenses totaling ₱573,518.01.



AAR CY 2019 



Finding No. 8

The Accounting unit closely monitored all cash advances of special disbursing officers. Demand letters were issued by the unit for all those due. 

Partially Implemented



Reiterated in this audit report. 

Require the concerned AOs to strictly adhere to the rules and regulations on cash advances provided under Section 89 of PD No. 1445 and COA Circular No. 97-002 with emphasis on prompt liquidation and on ensuring that the Accountant properly acknowledges receipt of the liquidation reports;



Refrain from granting additional cash advances to those employees who failed to liquidate their previous cash advance in accordance with the Section 89 of PD No. 1445 and COA Circular No. 97-002; and 



Reduce the amount of cash advance to such level as would be reasonably necessary through sound planning of costs of activities.









9.	Total collections made by the Cashier not deposited on the day of collection were not kept in a safe, and the work area of the same officer is not properly enclosed which is inconsistent with the requirement of a sound internal control to be installed and implemented in an agency as prescribed by Section 14 of PD 1445.



AAR CY 2019 



Finding No. 9

Management procured and utilized a safe/vault. Management also transferred to their new Administration building where the work area of the Cashier is secure.  

Fully Implemented
