C. 	OPINION OF THE AUDITOR ON THE FAIRNESS OF PRESENTATION OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

	

We rendered an unmodified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the financial statements of Kalinga State University for the year ended December 31, 2020.





D.	SIGNIFICANT OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

	

		The following are the observations and recommendations:

	

1)	The balance of the Accounts Receivable includes the amount of P6,623,858.24 which were dormant or long outstanding receivables resulting in the unreliability of the account. Also, allowing receivables to remain uncollected for any given period deprives the University of additional funds for its operations.



We recommended that Management intensify its efforts to collect the outstanding receivables to obtain additional funds for the University.



We also recommended that Management request for write-off the account balances which were considered dormant or determined to be non-collectable pursuant to COA Circular No. 2016-005.



2)	Past due loans in the total amount of P1,502,435.50 under the Student Financial Assistance Program (STUFAP) and Student Assistance Fund for Education for Loan (SAFE Loan) remained uncollected due to failure of management to exhaust all means to collect the same contrary to CHED Memorandum Order No. 4, series of 2004 and CHED Memorandum Order No. 25, series of 2008.



We recommended that Management strictly observe the guidelines set in CHED Memorandum Order No. 4, series of 2004 and CHED Memorandum Order No. 25, series of 2008 and enforce the provisions contained in the loan agreement/promissory note signed by the student-borrowers in order to collect the overdue accounts.



We also recommended that Management apply all remedies in order to collect past due accounts especially those granted way back in 2004 and onwards, such as but not limited to the issuance of demand letters not only to the student-borrowers but also to the identified co-makers.



3)	The delayed preparation/submission of the bank reconciliation statements by the Accountant is not in accordance with Sections 4 & 5, Chapter 21 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies, Volume I, which may result in non-detection of errors or non-adjustment of reconciling items, if any, on time.



We recommended that Management instruct the University Accountant to immediately process the enrollment to the bank’s “We Access” system and to prepare and submit on time the monthly Bank Reconciliation Statements for all bank accounts maintained by the University with the depository banks.



4)	Petty Cash Fund (PCF) was used for the payment of regular expenses contrary to the pertinent provisions of COA Circular No. 97-002; thus, taxes that should have been withheld from such expenditures were foregone. In addition, charges to the PCF were not supported with complete documentation as required under Section 4(6) of PD 1445 and COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012, hence, were suspended in audit.





We recommended that Management:

	a)	Refrain from charging representation expense to PCF, and to see to it that charging of meals and snacks to its proper account are supported with complete documentation to justify the claim. 

	b)	Institute stricter policies pertaining to reimbursement or the charging of meals, snacks and other representation costs to the account of the University especially by those officers already receiving Representation Allowances. The head of the agency shall ensure that there is a system of internal control and it should be adequate to ensure proper disbursements of funds.

	c)	Discontinue the payment of regular expenses out of the PCF but instead issue checks or pay thru ADA to the concerned payees. Such shall be included in the normal purchases of the University made following the prescribed procurement rules and procedures in accordance with provisions of RA 9184.

	d)	Instruct the petty cash custodian to ensure that payments out of the PCF are properly and completely supported with the required documents.

	e)	Decrease the amount of the PCF sufficient for one month transaction to discourage charging of regular expenses and those which are not considered petty.
