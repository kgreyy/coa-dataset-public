Part II – Observations and Recommendations



Financial and Compliance



1)	The balance of the Accounts Receivable included the amount of P6,623,858.24 which were dormant or long outstanding receivables resulting in the unreliability of the account balance. Also, allowing receivables to remain uncollected for any given period deprived the University of additional funds for its operations.



	1)	COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016 defines Dormant Receivable Accounts as accounts which balances remained inactive or non-moving in the books of accounts for ten (10) years or more and where settlement/collectability could no longer be ascertained.



	2)	On the procedures to write-off dormant accounts, Section 8 of the same COA Circular provides that:



“The head of the government entity shall file the request for authority to write-off dormant receivable accounts, unliquidated cash advances, and fund transfers to the COA Audit Team Leader and/or Supervising Auditor (SA). No filing fee is required. 



The request shall be supported by the following documents:



a)	Schedule of dormant accounts by accountable officer/debtor/government entity and by account, certified by the accountant and approved by the Head of the government entity.



b)	Certified relevant documents validating the existence of the conditions, as applicable, such as:



Xxx



b.6 Proof of exhaustion of all remedies to collect the receivables and demand to liquidate the cash advances and fund transfers, such as but not limited to copies of served or returned demand letters;



b.7 Certification by the responsible officials of the entity to effect that there are no records/documents available to validate claim; and



b.8  Other justifications, like in the case of request for write-off due to loss of documents, the circumstances of the loss should be stated in the letter-request”



	3)	Analysis of the Accounts Receivable account disclosed that Internally Generated Income (IGI) Fund, amounting to P6,623,858.24 which constitute 30.08% of the account balance, remained outstanding in the books of accounts for more than ten years, to wit:

The dormant and long-outstanding receivables which are no longer collectible should be requested for write-off pursuant to COA Circular No. 2016-005.



	4)	Interview with the university accountant disclosed that most of these accounts were from students that were no longer enrolled in the university, some dropped out of school without paying their obligations and some were unpaid balances of students that have already graduated. One of the reasons of the increase in the unpaid balances of the students was due to CHED Memorandum Order No. 02, series of 2010 dated January 22, 2010, which provides that “HEIs shall extend utmost flexibility in the implementation of the “No permit, no examination” Policy they are adopting, if any, and any such policy/ies that prohibit/s students from taking their periodic or final examination due to unpaid school accounts.” Another reason was, students who graduated with unpaid balances didn’t come back to get their credentials or they were allowed to get their credentials by signing a promissory note. The whereabouts of these former students were unknown because the address indicated in their school records was incomplete.



	5)	The non-collection of a considerable amount of receivables deprived the agency of additional funds while the presence of dormant receivables affects the accuracy of the Accounts Receivable account and may affect the fairness of presentation of the financial statements of the university.



	6)	We recommended that Management intensify its efforts to collect the outstanding receivables to obtain additional funds for the University.

 

	7)	We also recommended that Management request for write-off the account balances which were considered dormant, or determined to be non-collectable, pursuant to COA Circular No. 2016-005.



Management Comment:



	8)	The Management already issued Demand Letters to students with unsettled/unpaid fees to the University that were dormant for more than ten (10) years, but majority can no longer be located, while the others did not respond. It is for these reasons that the Management will request for the write-off of the account balances which are considered dormant, or determined to be non-collectible pursuant to COA Circular No. 2016-005.

	

1)	Past due loans in the total amount of P1,502,435.50 under the Student Financial Assistance Program (STUFAP) and Student Assistance Fund for Education for Loan (SAFE Loan) remained uncollected due to failure of management to exhaust all means to collect the same, contrary to CHED Memorandum Order No. 4, series of 2004, and CHED Memorandum Order No. 25, series of 2008.



	1)	Article XIV, Section 2 (3) of the Philippine Constitution mandates the State to establish and maintain a system of scholarship grants, student loan programs, subsidies and other incentives which shall be available to deserving students both private and public schools, especially the underprivileged.



	2)	The Commission on Higher Education (CHED) pursued the goal to broaden the access of deserving and qualified senior students, to the student loan schemes intended to contribute to the long term objectives of enhancing the nation’s human capital, competitiveness and economic development.



	3)	CHED Memorandum Order No. 4, series of 2004 and CHED Memorandum No. 25, series of 2008 stipulates the guidelines for the implementation of STUFAP and SAFE loan programs. These programs cater to students in financial need who are in their 3rd, 4th, 5th or graduating year of study. The loan grant may be used for tuition and other school fees, books and course projects, thesis writing, board and lodging, graduation fees and other valid related educational expenses. Qualified loan grantees can borrow as much as four thousand (P4,000.00) to eight thousand pesos (P8,000.00), depending on individual circumstances and requirements. The loans granted to students shall be interest free and will be paid within two to ten years after graduation.



	4)	The loan collections may have been affected by non-adherence to certain provisions of CHED Memorandum Order No. 4 series of 2004, and CHED Memorandum Order No. 25 series of 2008, both of which requires the execution of a loan agreement between the borrower/s and the HEI, stated as follows:



“Draw corresponding duly notarized promissory note for repayment within 2 to five years after graduation, duly notarized by the student borrower when grant of loan is awarded”; (CHED Memo Order No. 25 s. 2008)



“Enter into loan agreement with the borrower.” (CHED Memo Order No. 04 s. 2004)



	5)	As of December 31, 2020, the Loans Receivable – Others account of the University has a balance of P1,499,286.50, of which P1,488,465.50 or 99.28% of the total loan balance represents overdue receivables, ranging from one to twelve years, as detailed below:

	6)	Review of the collections made disclosed that most of the receivables already due for collection were not paid by the student grantees, contrary to the above mentioned guidelines. The outstanding balance per book is indicative that the University has not collected the loan repayments from the students, despite the fact, that fourteen years had already passed since the supposed graduation of the first borrowers. Upon inquiry with the University Accountant, the reason why they cannot collect these loan balances was that, they can no longer locate these students, and the co-makers/co-borrowers in the promissory note they have executed. He also added, that not all the promissory notes executed have co-makers/co-borrowers.



	7)	The Student Services and Admission Scholarship office, now called Student Development and Placement Services, has (i) no record to show that repayment is being diligently and regularly undertaken, (ii) no updated records of the student borrowers as to their addresses, and (iii) no updated reports submitted to CHED. There were no demand letters issued by the unit to the grantees.



	8)	Management likewise failed to maintain separate accounting records for the program that will be subjected to periodic monitoring by CHED and/or COA Audit Teams. It also failed to monitor or track the whereabouts of the scholars/grantees after graduation in order that the students properly comply with their obligation to refund the loan at the intended period of repayment.



	9)	As a result, the government was deprived of funds that could have been channeled to similarly beneficial programs as the implementation of these programs was already stopped by the University. Also, according to the accountant, CHED RO has advised the University thru a letter to return the unused balance including interest earned.



	10)	This observation was embodied in the Annual Audit Report (AAR) of the University for Calendar Year (CY) 2013. However, the recommendations were not implemented by Management resulting in a very minimal loan repayment. Our post-audit of Official Receipts (ORs) showed that only five grantees paid the amount of seventeen thousand nine hundred seventy pesos (P17,970.00) for CY 2020, hence, this finding was reiterated.



	11)	We recommended that management strictly observe the guidelines set in CHED Memorandum Order No. 4, series of 2004, and CHED Memorandum Order No. 25, series of 2008; and enforce the provisions contained in the loan agreement/promissory note signed by the student-borrowers in order to collect the overdue accounts.



	12)	We also recommended that management apply all remedies in order to collect past due accounts especially those granted way back in 2004 and onwards, such as but not limited to the issuance of demand letters not only to the student-borrowers but, also to the identified co-makers.



Management Comment:



	13)	Management will issue demand letters to the student grantees/borrowers and/or co-makers/co-borrowers.



2)	The delayed preparation/submission of the bank reconciliation statements by the Accountant was not in accordance with Sections 4 & 5, Chapter 21 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies, Volume I, which may result in non-detection of errors or non-adjustment of reconciling items, if any, on time.



	1)	Sections 4 and 5 of Chapter 21 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume I, for NGAs provides that the monthly BRS shall be prepared by the Chief Accountant/designated staff for each of the bank accounts maintained by the agency/entity using the Adjusted Balance Method. The Chief Accountant/Designated Staff shall within ten days from receipt of the monthly Bank Statement together with the paid checks, original copies of Debit Memoranda (DM)/Credit Memoranda (CM) from the GSB, reconcile the BS with the GL and prepare the BRS.



	2)	The monthly bank reconciliation statements have not been submitted on time. As of December 31, 2020, bank reconciliation statements are yet to be submitted as follows:

	3)	Upon inquiry, the Accountant informed the audit team that the main reason for the delay was due to the bank’s late furnishing of bank statements. For this reason, the audit team conferred with the bank manager to find resolution on the matter. In that informal meeting, the team was informed about the newly installed system of the bank called “We Access” wherein such technology requires enrollment of duly authorized agency personnel to provide real time access to government depositary accounts. This would in turn cure the late transmittal of bank statements (hard copies) to different agencies, because authorized accountable officers such as the Agency Accountant can already view their accounts through the internet without having to wait for the hard copies of bank statements.



	4)	While the audit team accepts the justification for now pending the Agency’s enrollment to the “We Access”, still it was emphasized the necessity of the bank reconciliation statement to be prepared on time. The delay in the preparation thereof, may result in non-detection of errors or non-adjustment of reconciling items, if any, on time.



	5)	We recommended that management instruct the University Accountant to immediately process the enrollment to the bank’s “We Access” system and to prepare and submit on time the monthly Bank Reconciliation Statements for all bank accounts maintained by the University with the depository banks.







Management Comment:



	6)	Management have already applied for “We Access” for all of their accounts and they can now access their bank accounts thru the internet but two of their bank accounts were not yet enrolled because of some bank issues especially the MDS account.



3)	Petty Cash Fund (PCF) was used for the payment of regular expenses, contrary to the pertinent provisions of COA Circular No. 97-002; thus, taxes that should have been withheld from such expenditures were foregone. In addition, charges to the PCF were not supported with complete documentation, as required under Section 4(6) of PD 1445 and COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012; hence, for suspension in audit.



	1)	Section 4.3.1 of COA Circular No. 97-002 states that, “The cash advance shall be sufficient for the recurring expenses of the agency for one month.  The AO may request replenishment of the cash advance when the disbursements reach at least 75%, or as the need requires, by submitting a replenishment voucher with all supporting documents duly summarized in a report of disbursement.



	2)	Section 4.3.2 of the same circular states that, “The cash advance should not be used for payment of regular expenses, such as rentals, subscriptions, light and water and the like. Payments out of the cash advance shall be allowed only for amounts not exceeding ₽15,000.00 for each transaction, except when a higher amount is allowed by law and/or specific authority by the Commission on Audit. Splitting of transactions to avoid exceeding the ceiling shall not be allowed.”



	3)	Section 4(6) of PD 1445 or the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines states that claims against government funds shall be supported with complete documentation.



	4)	COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 was issued to prescribe the revised guidelines and documentary requirements for common government transactions. Section 1.2.2 of the said circular provides the required documentation in replenishing the Petty Cash Fund, such as:



a)	Petty Cash Replenishment Report

b)	Approved Purchase Request with Certificate of Emergency Purchase, if necessary

c)	Bills, receipts, sales invoice

d)	Certificate of Inspection and Acceptance

e)	Report of Waste Materials in case of replacement/repair

f)	Approved Trip ticket, for gasoline expenses

g)	Canvass from at least three suppliers for purchases involving P1,000 and above, except for purchases made while on official travel

h)	Summary/Abstract of Canvass

i)	Petty Cash Vouchers duly accomplished and signed



	5)	Section 124 of PD 1445 provides that it shall be the primary responsibility of the head of the agency to install, implement and monitor an adequate system of internal control.



	6)	Review of the replenished expenses paid out of PCF for CY 2020 disclosed the following:



a)	Numerous meals and snacks and groceries totaling P122,061.50 were charged to Representation Expense and Other Supplies and Materials Expense accounts out of Petty Cash Fund for activities which were not supported with activity/program designs. (Annex A)



b)	Expenses with P1,000.00 and above totaling P240,544.20 were not supported with canvass from at least three suppliers. (Annex B)



c)	Expenses totaling P8,075.00 for repairs and replacement of parts were not supported with the Report of Waste Materials. (Annex C)



d)	Recurring and regular expenses totaling P159,965.20 were charged to the PCF. (Annex D)



e)	It was also observed that the Petty Cash Vouchers were not properly filled up by the petty cash custodian especially the PCV number portion.



	7)	Meals and snacks may be served during meetings, conferences and other office activities but these should be carefully planned and supported with budget, board resolutions, agenda for the meetings and conferences, activity design/proposal for office activities, attendance sheets, minutes of meetings/conferences and brief post-activity reports, and these shall be duly approved by authorized officials.



	8)	Meals and snacks provided during meetings and other office activities shall be limited to necessary and important activities only. Moreover, meals provided during conduct of inspection and repair works, including the rendition of overtime work, are regular activities inherent in the duties and responsibilities of the personnel concerned.



	9)	The concerned officers and employees were able to charge, or reimburse such amount and type of expenses despite the absence of policies restricting or limiting the claims for food, meals and other similar expenses. As a result, the university incurred expenses which unduly decreased the University’s funds.



	10)	Repairs of vehicles and spare parts needed were easily bought using the petty cash fund. The Petty Cash Vouchers were supported only with Official Receipts/Sales Invoices and Purchase Requests. Other required documents such as Certificate of Emergency Purchase, Waste Materials Report and Certificate of Inspection and Acceptance were not attached.



	11)	Other regular expenses were also charged to the PCF which resulted in incomplete documentation. Purchases of items categorized as Other Supplies and Materials showed that they were not emergency in nature and resulted in incomplete documentation of government transactions.



	12)	Further, the purchase of common use supplies shall be properly planned. All government agencies shall procure their common-use supplies directly from the DBM-PS without need of public bidding.



	13)	Taxes shall supposedly be withheld for purchases of supplies and materials however, procuring them on piecemeal or reimbursement basis thru PCF deprived the government of such taxes.



	14)	We recommended and management agreed to:



		1)	Refrain from charging representation expense to PCF, and to see to it that charging of meals and snacks to its proper account are supported with complete documentation to justify the claim.



		1)	Institute stricter policies pertaining to reimbursement or the charging of meals, snacks and other representation costs to the account of the University especially by those officers already receiving Representation Allowances. The head of the agency shall ensure that there is a system of internal control and it should be adequate to ensure proper disbursements of funds.



		2)	Discontinue the payment of regular expenses out of the PCF but instead issue checks or pay thru ADA to the concerned payees. Such shall be included in the normal purchases of the University made following the prescribed procurement rules and procedures of RA 9184.



		3)	Instruct the petty cash custodian to ensure that payments out of the PCF are properly and completely supported with the required documents.



		4)	Decrease the amount of the PCF sufficient for one month transaction to discourage charging of regular expenses and those which are  not considered petty.



Gender and Development



1)	In CY 2020, the KSU utilized the amount of P22,751,097.84 or 93.75% of the allocated amount of P24,266,686.43 for the implementation of planned GAD activities that addressed gender issues within the University in accordance with Joint Circular No. 2012-01 of the Philippine Commission on Women (PCW), Department of Budget and Management (DBM) and National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA).

 

	1)	Joint Circular No. 2012-01 of the Philippine Commission on Women (PCW), Department of Budget and Management (DBM) and National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) dated July 20, 2012 states that Pursuant to the Magna Carta of Women (MCW) and the General Appropriations Act (GAA), all government departments, including their attached agencies, offices, bureaus, state universities and colleges (SUCs), government-owned and controlled corporations (GOCCs), local government units (LGUs) and other government instrumentalities shall formulate their annual GAD plans and budgets within the context of their mandates to mainstream gender perspectives in their policies, programs and projects.
