Scope of Audit



            Financial and Compliance Audits were conducted on the accounts and operations of the PSU for CY 2020.  It included analysis of accounts in the financial statements, review of transactions and test of compliance with financial rules and regulations. The objectives of the audit are to ascertain the fairness and reliability of the Agency’s financial position and results of operations, and to determine whether the Agency’s operations were conducted in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations.





Audit Opinion on the Financial Statements



	The Auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of the presentation of the financial statements of the University due to the following:



--	The accuracy, validity and existence of the reported balances of Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) accounts totaling P1,657,037,516.84 is doubtful due to a) total discrepancy of P277,338,281.46 between the accounting records and the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) and other deficiencies noted, contrary to the prescribed policies and procedures in the recording, reporting and maintenance of the PPE accounts under Volume I of  the Government Accounting Manual (GAM)  for National Government Agencies (NGAs),  hence misstating the PPE account as presented in the Statement of Financial Position (SFP). 



--	The accuracy, reliability and existence of the balance of Cash and Cash Equivalents account of all funds totaling P288,703,274.87 as of December 31, 2020, is doubtful due to a) discrepancy between the book and the bank balances of  Cash in Bank account in the net amount of P76,878,228.57;  b) discrepancy of P2,601,434.17 between the book and Report of Collections and Deposit (RCD)   c) non/delay preparation  of  Bank Reconciliation Statement (BRS) for Funds 164-Senior High and Fund 401,  contrary to Section 112 of Presidential Decree (PD) No 1445, Section 27 of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS),  Sections 5 to 7, Chapter  21 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I, thereby affecting the fair presentation of the Cash accounts in the financial statements.



--	 The aggregate balance of the Land account totalling P377,480,913.00 as of December 31, 2020 is unreliable and of doubtful validity due to a) absence of Transfer Certificate of  Title (TCT) as proof of ownership of 38 parcels of land, and b) 21 parcels of land were not recorded in the books of accounts,  contrary to Section 39 of Presidential Decree (PD)  No. 1445 and Section 6, Chapter 19 of  Government Accounting Manual (GAM), resulting in the misstatement  of the account in the financial statements and exposing these lots to possible third party claims.



--	The accuracy and reliability of the balance of Trust Liabilities account under Fund 401 totaling P69,513,599.18 as of December 31, 2020 could not be ascertained due to inclusion of (a) accounts for reconciliation totaling P105,964,955.17; (b) accounts with abnormal/negative balance amounting to  P59,586,916.68; (c) erroneous classification of various transactions such as  collection of various fiduciary fees from students amounting to P8,730,783.36, receipt of funds from other government agencies subject for liquidation totaling P11,837,797.09 and receipts/collections  of registration fees from seminars and workshop conducted by the University amounting to P1,166,272.62,  resulting to misstatement  of the amount of the said account as stated  in the financial statements.



--	 The accuracy and reliability of the Due to National Government Agencies (NGAs) account amounting to P59,619,843.44 as of December 31, 2020, could not be ascertained due to a) discrepancy of P10,638,001.43 between General Ledger (GL) and Subsidiary Ledgers; b) inclusion of  dormant accounts of  P10,948,610.83; and c) abnormal/negative balance amounting to P8,870,914.89 in violation of the provisions of Section 111 and 112 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 and COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994,  resulting to misstatement of the Due to NGAs account as presented in the financial statements.   



--	Non-compliance with the rules and regulations on the grant, utilization and liquidation of Cash Advances (CAs) as prescribed under Section 89 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445, COA Circular Nos. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997and 2012-004 dated November 28, 2012 resulted in the accumulation of the unliquidated cash advance balances account amounting to P15,267,102.28 as of December 31, 2020.





Significant Observations and Recommendations



	For the exceptions cited above, we recommended that the University President instruct the (a) University Accountant to effect the necessary corrections/adjustments on the noted deficiencies to present fairly the value of the PPE accounts in the financial statements and to resolve the timing differences in the recording of PPE in General Ledger and in the PPELC; (b) OIC Property Custodian to use the appropriate PPE accounts as provided in the Revised Chart of Accounts (RCA) in the RPCPPE; (c) University Accountant to exhaust all possible means to determine the dates of acquisition of the PPE in order to compute and record the depreciation in the books for fair presentation of the value of PPE in the financial statements; (d) The University Engineer and the Inspectorate Team to conduct assessment /evaluation on construction of Mathivation Training Center/Science and Computer Laboratory Building and accomplish a report on deficiencies/errors noted.



--		We recommended that the University President require the University Accountant to: (a) Ensure that all reconciling items are properly identified and adjusted in the books; (b) Adjust book errors if any to correct discrepancies between book and bank balances; (c) Assign personnel who will   prepare monthly BRS for each bank account of the University every end of the month or within ten days from receipt of the Bank Statement.

	

--			We recommended that the University President:  (a) Require the Vice President for Finance & Administration thru the Focal Person to facilitate/manage the immediate transfer of the title of the parcels of lot in the name of the University in order to assure the government of its absolute ownership;  (b) Instruct the Directors of the respective CCRD/external campuses to submit the updated Tax Declaration of the parcels of land under their jurisdiction; and (c) Instruct the University Accountant to cause the immediate recording of the parcels of land in the books of accounts taking into consideration the respective market values as reflected in the tax declaration.

	

--			We recommended that the University President instruct the University Accountant to: (a) Analyze and reconcile the items under the Trust Liabilities account specifically those without supporting schedules and with negative balances; (b) Determine the proper classification of the items under Trust Liabilities as provided under Volume III of GAM for NGAs in the recognition of  transactions in the books of accounts; and (c) Effect necessary adjusting entries to properly classify the receipts/collections to the proper Income accounts and to transfer the funds to the Special Trust Fund in compliance with CHED MO No. 20-2011.

	

--			We recommended that the University President instruct the University Accountant to: (a) Evaluate the completed projects and initiate the immediate return of the unused and dormant funds to the Source Agencies/National Treasury; and (b) Reconcile the negative balances and the difference between the general and subsidiary ledgers balance and schedule of Due to NGAs and adjust any discrepancies noted.

	

--			We recommended that the University President instruct the concerned officials through the University Accountant to: (a) Refrain from giving additional CAs to officials and employees with unliquidated CAs; (b) Direct the Accountable Officers concerned to liquidate CAs as soon as the purpose of the CA has been served or within the prescribed period; (c) Cause the immediate liquidations/settlement of long outstanding cash advances by exhausting all possible remedies provided by existing regulations.

		

		In addition, hereunder are the other significant audit observations and the corresponding recommended courses of action:

	

1)	The hiring of Job Order workers to perform regular function of the University is contrary to Item 7.2 of CSC-COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 1 series of 2017, hence salaries and wages paid to them   totalling  P28,600,473.60 may be considered   irregular.    



We recommended that the University President instruct the Vice President for Finance and Administration (VPFA)/Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) /HRMO to a) facilitate the hiring of personnel and fill up all vacant positions to complement work load of both supervisory and clerical functions; b) assess current organizational structure and consider requesting additional  plantilla  positions from the DBM to lessen the hiring of JOs; and c) adhere strictly with the rules and regulations in the hiring of JOs under existing regulations.



2. 	Payment of  honoraria to Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) members, BAC Secretariat and Technical Working Group (TWG) amounting to P1,208,500.00 under Fund 101 and P1,674,500.00 under Fund 401 were not  in accordance with the provisions under Section 5.7.1 of Commission On Audit (COA) Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012, COA Circular No. 2003-04 dated July 30, 2003, Department of Budget and  Management (DBM)  Budget Circular (BC) No. 2004-5A and DBM BC No. 2007-3 or the Guidelines on the Grant of Honoraria to Government Personnel Involved in Government Procurement,  and BIR Revenue Regulation No. 11-2018  dated January 31, 2018 on withholding of taxes on compensation.







We recommended that the University President should: (a) Require the University Accountant/BAC Secretariat to submit the additional supporting documents necessary for the claims of honoraria; (b) Cause the personnel concerned to refund the excess honoraria paid to them; (c) Instruct the University Accountant to determine the legitimate personnel who should be allowed to claim honoraria;  (d) Require the University Accountant to ensure that withholding taxes are deducted from payments of honoraria, made in accordance with Revised Withholding Tax Table  and the same are remitted to the BIR within the prescribed period.  



3.	Distribution and use of prepaid cellular cards and postpaid subscription plans were not properly monitored and controlled due to the absence of policy in the grant and utilization of communication allowance,  hence its economical  use was not ensured, contrary to Section 2 of Presidential Decree (PD) No.  1445.



We recommended that the University President: (a) Adopt a policy on the grant of communication allowance to be approved by the BOR taking into consideration the following matters: (i) officials/employees entitled to communication allowance should not be lower than Division Chief rank; (ii) reasonable amount of cell card/ load allowance to be provided in addition to available landlines/mobile phones and internet connection; and (iii) use of mobile phone plans with unlimited calls/text to all networks offered by various telecommunication companies and one unit postpaid line subscription policy for proper monitoring. (b) Limit the use of postpaid lines provided by the University to employees/persons who were not given communication allowance.



4.   Out of the Gender and Development (GAD) Plan and Budget of P27,778,000.00 or 5.87%  of its annual appropriations in the General    Appropriations    Act   (GAA) of P473,157,000.00  for Calendar Year (CY) 2020,  only P380,234.20 was utilized, hence affected the University’s goals to attain GAD objectives.  Moreover, the University failed to  utilize the Harmonized Gender and Development Guidelines (HGDG) tool in attributing major programs of the University to the GAD Budget under  Joint Circular (JC) No. 2012-01 of Philippine Commission on Women (PCW), National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA), and Department of Budget and Management (DBM),  thus actual costs/expenditures reflected in the submitted GAD Accomplishment   Report  (AR) are unreliable and unverifiable as to their gender responsiveness.



We recommended that the University President as the head of the GAD Focal Point System (GFPS) instruct the GAD Director to:  (a) ensure full implementation of the planned GAD programs and activities as stated in the GPB; (b) regularly assess the GAD plans through the use of the HGDG tool as prescribed in PCW/NEDA/DBM Joint Circular No.2012-01; (c) conduct on line teleconferencing training/seminars for all faculty and administrative personnel involve in GAD mainstreaming through the use of HGDG and other tools mandated by GAD regulations.

	

The above audit findings and recommendations were discussed with concerned officials and staff.  Management’s views and comments were incorporated in the report, where appropriate.
