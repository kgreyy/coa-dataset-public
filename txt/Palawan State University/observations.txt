PART II –OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS





A)	Financial and Compliance Audit



	1)	The accuracy, validity and existence of the reported balances of Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) accounts totaling P1,657,037,516.84 is doubtful due to a) total discrepancy of P277,338,281.46 between the accounting records and the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) and other deficiencies noted, contrary to the prescribed policies and procedures in the recording, reporting and maintenance of the PPE accounts under Volume I of  the Government Accounting Manual (GAM)  for National Government Agencies (NGAs),  hence misstating the PPE account as presented in the Statement of Financial Position (SFP). 



As of year - end the Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) account has a balance of P1,657,037,516.84 in the Statement of Financial Position (SPF). Comparison of the reported balance with the result of the physical count reported in the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) as submitted by the University with a total amount of P1,379,699,235.38, disclosed a discrepancy of  P277,338,281.46, as presented in the following table:

*Proper accounts for the difference of P404,190,424.40 could not be determined due to the discrepancy as mentioned above. 



b)	Discrepancies of P462,235,887.66 (Annex A) between the General Ledger (GL) totaling P1,657,037,516.84 and the PPE Ledger Cards (PPELC) totaling P1,194,801,629.18.  



According to the Accounting Staff, the variance maybe due to the use of different documents as basis in recording, as PPEs are recorded in the GL upon receipt of Purchase Order (PO) while in the PPELC, recording is upon receipt of the Inspection and Acceptance Report (IAR).  The said practice is contrary to Section 20, Chapter 10 of GAM, Volume I, which provides that “deliveries of PPE shall be recorded immediately in the Property Card (Appendix 69) maintained by the Supply and/or Property Division/Unit on the basis of the IAR and other supporting documents. The IAR and other supporting documents shall be forwarded to the Accounting Division/Unit for the recording of deliveries in the books of accounts through JEV and in the Property, Plant and Equipment Ledger Card (PPELC) (Appendix 70). Based on the IAR and other supporting documents, the Supply and/or Property Division/Unit shall prepare the DV and submit to the Accounting Division/Unit for the processing of payment”.



c)			Discrepancy of P26,991.927.68 between the GL and the RPCPPE due to unrecorded/ unreconciled balances of Buildings and School Buildings account.

		In addition, the Accounting Office cannot provide for the breakdown of the balances of the Buildings and School Buildings accounts amounting to P71,505,017.97 and P152,402,663.27, respectively, thus preventing further reconciliation of the two accounts.



d. 	Various unserviceable properties totaling P2,111,039.75 were included in the RPCPPE, contrary to Sec. 40 of GAM Vol. I, which provides that “all unserviceable property shall be reported in the Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP). PPE reported in the IIRUP shall be dropped from the books by debiting Impairment Loss-Property, Plant and Equipment (cost of the PPE less Accumulated Depreciation)”.



e. 	Semi-expendable items totalling P92,000.00 with costs below the capitalization threshold were classified as PPE, contrary to Section 10, Chapter 8 of GAM, Volume I, which provides “that tangible items below the capitalization threshold of P15,000.00 shall be accounted as semi-expendable property”. 



f. 	The Accounting Office failed to provide depreciation to PPEs valued at P9,598,881.17.  The table below shows the PPE accounts that were not provided with Allowance for Depreciation.

The failure of the Accounting Office to provide depreciation is contrary to Section 27 of Chapter 10 of GAM, Vol. I, which states that “PPE gradually loses its ability to provide service over the course of time. Because of this, its cost needs to be distributed on a systematic basis over its useful life. The allocated cost is referred to as depreciation. The depreciation charge for each period shall be recognized as expense unless it is included in the carrying amount of another asset”.



The Accounting Office stated that they failed to compute for the depreciation of the assets because of the absence of documents that would show the description, number of units, acquisition cost and date of acquisition.  



The non-provision of depreciation understated the Depreciation Expense and the Accumulated Depreciation of the affected accounts as of year-end, thereby overstating the PPE and Government Equity accounts.  



g.	The  physical existence of the Mathivation  Training Center, constructed on June 6, 2017  with contract amount of P1,949,990.58 and included in the RPCPPE under the Land and Buildings account as of year-end  could no longer be verified because the  said building is already part of the Science and Computer Laboratory Building constructed/completed on December 31, 2020, costing P32,024,473.91.  This was discovered during the physical inspection of the Audit Team, together with the newly designated University Engineer.  



The University Engineer informed that evaluation/assessment of both buildings will be conducted for proper recording.          



	          The above deficiencies were also noted in the prior year’s audit.  However, the University did not yet implement our previous audit recommendations. 

	

	The noted deficiencies and the discrepancy of P277,338,281.46 between the books and the RPCPPE as presented above rendered the accuracy, validity and existence of the PPE accounts doubtful.  

	

	We recommended that the University President instruct the: 

	

a)	University Accountant to effect the necessary corrections/adjustments on the noted deficiencies to present fairly the value of the PPE accounts in the financial statements and to resolve the timing differences in the recording of PPE in the General Ledger and in the PPELC;



b)	OIC Property Custodian to use the appropriate PPE accounts as provided in the Revised Chart of Accounts (RCA) in the RPCPPE;



c)	University Accountant to exhaust all possible means to determine the dates of acquisition of the PPE in order to compute and record the depreciation in the books for fair presentation of the value of PPE in the financial statements; and



d)	The University Engineer and the Inspectorate Team to conduct assessment /evaluation on construction of Mathivation Training Center/Science and Computer Laboratory Building and accomplish a report on deficiencies/errors noted.



	The Management informed that the Accounting Section was not able to review the correctness of the accounts used due to the delay by the Property Office to submit the RPCPPE, but committed to use RCA in the next reporting period.  The Management also committed to direct the concerned personnel to exert effort to trace back PPE transactions in order to reconcile the noted discrepancies and drop from the RPCPPE Unserviceable properties upon submission of the IIRUP by the Property Office and that source documents of PPEs is now on-going tracing for proper allocation of depreciation expense.  



	2)	The accuracy, reliability and existence of the balances of Cash and Cash Equivalents accounts for all funds totaling P288,703,274.87 as of December 31, 2020 is doubtful due to a) discrepancy between the book and the bank balances of  Cash in Bank account in the net amount of P76,878,228.57;  b) discrepancy of P2,601,434.17 between the book and Report of Collections and Deposit (RCD); c) non/delay preparation  of  Bank Reconciliation Statement (BRS) for Funds 164-Senior High and Fund 401, contrary to Section 112 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445, Section 27 of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS), and Sections 5 to 7, Chapter 21, Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I, thereby affecting the fair presentation of the Cash accounts in the financial statements. 



Section 112 of PD No. 1445 states that “each government agency shall record its financial transactions and operations in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and in accordance with pertinent laws and regulations”.



Likewise, Section 27 of the IPSAS, also provides that “financial Statements shall present fairly the financial position, financial performance and cash flow of an entity.  Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of the transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses set out in IPSAS”. 



Sections 5-7, Chapter 2I of GAM for NGAs, Volume I, further provides the following: 



Sec. 5 - The Chief Accountant/Designated Staff shall within ten days from receipt of the monthly Bank Statement (BS) together with the paid checks, original copies of Debit Memoranda (DM)/Credit Memoranda (CM) from the GSB, reconcile the BS with the GL and prepare the Bank Reconciliation Statement (BRS) in four copies.



Sec. 6. Recognition of Adjustments.  The Chief Accountant/Designated Staff shall prepare a JEV to recognize all reconciling items that require adjustment and correction in the books of accounts.  



Sec. 7. Reporting.  The Chief Accountant shall submit the BRS within twenty days after receipt of the monthly BS to the following:  



Original – COA Auditor (with all the supporting documents and JEVs) 

Copy 2 – Head of Agency/Entity 

Copy 3 – Accounting Division/Unit file 

Copy 4 – Bank, if necessary

Detailed review of the discrepancies revealed the following: 



a)	Unreconciled discrepancies between the book and the bank balances of Cash in Bank account in the net amount of P76,878,228.57 pertained to the following:  

	

i)	Fund 101 – The discrepancy of P10,786,032.33 represents the outstanding checks pending for encashment; 

ii)	Fund 401- The discrepancy of P1,702,578.92 was due to the accumulation of unrecorded deposits totalling P1,544,347.65, outstanding checks of P179,997.01 and erroneous recordings in CYs  2017 to 2020 which resulted in a net amount of P (21,765.74)

iii)	 Fund 164- The discrepancy of P 12,307,229.77 was due to outstanding checks amounting to  P 10,548,032.58, unrecorded  credit memo of P 2,198,850.82 and long outstanding bank reconciling items amounting to P439,653.63;   

iv)	Fund 164 LBP-Senior High School Fund- the discrepancy of P1,174,357.63 was due to unrecorded deposit of P1,172,500.00 made by DepEd for the Senior High School of  Taytay, Palawan Campus and interest income of P1,857.63; 

v)	Fund 164 – Infrastructure Project Fund - The discrepancy of P50,489,100.00 is the unrecorded amount of fund transfers from CHED related to Tertiary Education Subsidy (TES) and ESGP-PA;

vi)	Fund 164 Hostel, Canteen, and Bookstore –The discrepancies were due to long outstanding book and bank reconciling items amounting to  P20,600.00.84,  P437,634.71 and P 39,305.63 respectively. 



Pursuant to Section 6, Chapter 21, GAM for NGAs, Volume I, the University Accountant should have prepared a Journal Entry Voucher (JEV) to recognize all reconciling items that require adjustments and/or corrections in the books of accounts to present the accurate and reliable balance of the Cash in Bank account in the financial statements.   



b)	Discrepancy between the RCD and Cash-Collecting Officers account balance of P2,601,434.17. 



The account Cash- Collecting Officers has a balance of P2,629,864.83 in the Financial Statement of the University as of December 31, 2020.  Comparison of the balances of the funds under the said account against the Report of Collections and Deposits (RCD) disclosed a discrepancy of P2,601,434.17, as presented below.

	  As per the certification signed by the collecting officer in the RCD, its balance should agree with the balance appearing in the Cash Receipts Record (CRR). The bookkeepers explained that the discrepancy might be due to unreconciled beginning balances that were transferred from the manual system to the computerized system of the office and that reconciliation of the balances is now on-going.   



c)	Non/Delay preparation of the BRS for Fund 164-Senior High Fund and Fund 401. 



     Records showed that the accounting department failed to prepare the BRS for Fund 164-Dep Ed Senior High account while there was delay of six months in the preparation and submission of BRS for Fund 401.  According to the Accounting Office, preparation of the BRS was not given priority due to the numerous reports being required by the Board of Regents (BOR) and the Department of Budget Management (DBM), thus there was no available personnel to prepare the BRS for the said funds. 



The BRS, as a mandatory accounting report, is a tool to determine the propriety of the recorded Cash in Bank account.  Reconciliations help ensure that the cash in bank balance is correct, determine what outstanding payments have not yet cleared, establish any discrepancies and aid in preparing  necessary adjustments to arrive at the accurate cash balance at the end of the year. The delay/non preparation of BRS for the two funds is contradictory to sound internal control policies intended to safeguard assets and records, promote operational efficiency and  encourage adherence to prescribed policies.   



Due to the deficiencies noted, the accuracy, reliability and existence of the reported balances of the Cash and Cash Equivalents accounts totalling P288,703,274.87 as stated in the Financial Statements as of year-end is doubtful.







We recommended that the University President require the University Accountant to:



a)		 Ensure that all reconciling items are properly identified and adjusted in the books; 

	

b. Adjust book errors, if any, to correct discrepancies between book and   bank balances; and

	

c. Assign personnel who will prepare monthly BRS for each of the bank accounts of the University within ten days from receipt of the Bank Statement.





The Management committed to direct the Accounting Section to facilitate adjustment of reconciling items and to coordinate with the bank for the timely submission of debit/credit memo and paid cheques.  Letter request on bank reconciling items shall likewise be monitored for confirmation to effect timely adjustment in the books. The discrepancy between the report of the cash collecting officer against the RCD, pertains to prior years that would require extra time and effort due to difficulty in the retrieval of documents, thus will be the prioritized in CY 2021.





	3)	The aggregate balance of the Land account totalling P377,480,913.00 as of December 31, 2020 is unreliable and of doubtful validity due to a) absence of Transfer Certificate of  Title (TCT) as proof of ownership on 38 parcels of land; and b) 21 parcels of land were not recorded in the books of accounts,  contrary to Section 39 of Presidential Decree (PD)  No. 1445 and Section 6, Chapter 19 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), resulting in the misstatement  of the account in the financial statements and exposing these lots to possible third party claims.



	Section 39 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 provides that “In the case of deeds to property purchased by any government agency, the Commission shall require a certificate of title entered in favor of the government or other evidence satisfactory to it that the title is in the government. It shall be the duty of the officials or employees concerned, xxx, to comply promptly with these requirements.  xxx”

		

		Section 6, Chapter 19 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume 1, provides that “one of the qualitative characteristics of financial reporting is reliability, defined as free from material error and bias, and can be depended on by users to represent faithfully that which it purports to represent”.     

		

		As of December 31, 2020, the Land account as stated in the Statement of Financial Position (SFP) under Property, Plant and Equipment comprising of the 19 recorded parcels of land amounted to P377,480,913.00  (Annex B).

		

	Review of records and inventory of lots showed that the University acquired a total of 40 parcels of land through purchase, donation, and Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) applied lot, as follows:

		Further review and verification of records and documents disclosed that:

		

a)		38 out of the 40 parcels of land with an area of 7,392,365 square meters have no TCT.

			

	The report on the status of the land holdings submitted by the Land Use Development Plan (LUDEP)  focal person revealed that 38 out of the 40 parcels of land with total area of 7,392,365 square meters were not supported with TCT. Only two lots were duly supported with TCT in the name of the University.  The focal person informed that as of December 31, 2020, applications for the titling of six lots were already submitted to DENR and City Environment and Natural Resources Office (CENRO).  For the other parcels of land, the focal person is still gathering the necessary documents needed for the application of TCT such as the original copy of the deed of donation, owner’s copy of the title, tax declaration, clearances and other documents required by the other agencies such as Land Registration Authority (LRA)/Register of Deeds (RD) and the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR).   

	

			    The land title is the evidence of the right of the owner or extent of his interest where he can maintain control and right to exclusive possession and enjoyment of the property. Thus, failure to secure titles for all the land owned by the University exposed the same to the risk of disputes or claim by third/other parties. 

	



b.  21 parcels of land with an area of 6,785,356 square meters were not recorded in the books of accounts.



The accounting office disclosed that out of the 40 lots, 21 parcels of land with total area of 6,785,356 (Annex B) square meters were not yet recorded in the books due to the absence of Tax Declaration of Real Property as basis of the current market and assessed values of the land.  



The accounting office further declared that a Focal Person in charge for the titling of land owned by the University was already designated in the last quarter of 2020 to secure the Tax Declaration and Zonal Valuation as basis of costing for the 21 parcels of land with total area of 6,785,356 square meters.  



	The foregoing deficiencies rendered the Land account in the financial statement as unreliable and/or misstated.



	We recommended   that the University President:   



a)	Require the Vice President for Finance & Administration thru the Focal Person to facilitate/manage the immediate transfer of the title of the parcels of lot in the name of the University in order to assure the government of its absolute ownership;  



b)	Instruct the Directors of the respective CCRD/external campuses to submit the updated Tax Declaration of the parcels of land under their jurisdiction; and  



c)	Instruct the University Accountant to cause the immediate recording of the parcels of land in the books of accounts taking into consideration the respective market values as reflected in the tax declaration.



The management informed that Memorandum Letter dated January 5, 2021 was already issued, directing all campus directors to update and submit documents needed in the processing of titles for all the lands owned by the University.





	4)	The accuracy and reliability of the balance of Trust Liabilities account under Fund 401 totaling P69,513,599.18 as of December 31, 2020 could not be ascertained due to inclusion of (a) accounts for reconciliation totalling P105,964,955.17; (b) accounts with abnormal/negative balance amounting to  P59,586,916.68; and (c) erroneous classification of various transactions such as  collection of various fiduciary fees from students amounting to P8,730,783.36, receipt of funds from other government agencies subject for liquidation totalling P11,837,797.09 and receipts/collections  of registration fees from seminars and workshops conducted by the University amounting to P1,166,272.62,  resulting in misstatements of the account  in the financial statements.

		

		Records showed that as of December 31, 2020, the balance of the Trust Liabilities account under Fund 401 amounted to P69,513,599.18 (Annex C) or 14.78 percent of the total liabilities of P470,245,087.60. Review and analysis of the account disclosed that it includes the following:

		

a)	Accounts for Reconciliation amounting to  P105,964,955.17	

		

	Review of the schedule prepared by the Accounting Staff showed that the Trust Liabilities account, included an amount for reconciliation totalling P105,964,955.17.  To validate, the audit team requested a copy of the corresponding Subsidiary Ledger (SL).  The Accounting Staff in charge of the account disclosed that SLs and/or other records showing the details of the amount for reconciliation were not maintained, contrary to Section 111 of PD No.1445 which provides that:

			

		

			  Section 111. Keeping of accounts.

		

		1)			 The accounts of an agency shall be kept in such detail as is necessary to meet the needs of the agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or control agencies of the government.

		

		(2) The highest standards of honesty, objectivity and consistency shall be observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate or misleading information.

		

b)		Abnormal/Negative Balance of P59,586,916.68

		

		

		Review of the Trust Liabilities Account balance showed that it also included a negative amount of  P 59,586,916.68.  When the audit team requested for the details of the said amount, the Accounting Staff in-charge of the account informed that Subsidiary Ledgers (SL) and/or other records were not maintained. It was also disclosed that the negative balances already existed when the former Accounting Staff handling the said account turned over the records.  The inclusion of these negative balances rendered the accuracy and reliability of the Trust Liabilities account doubtful, contrary to Section 112 of PD No. 1445 which provides that “Each government agency shall record its financial transactions and operations conformably with generally accepted accounting principles and in accordance with pertinent laws and regulations”.

		. 

		

c)		Erroneous inclusion of misclassified accounts totalling P21,734,853.07

		

Further review of the Trust liabilities account showed that a total of P21,734,853.07 misclassified transactions should have been recorded in the following specific accounts:

		

--			Special Trust Fund (Fund 164) - P8,730,783.36

		

		Article I, Section 3 (v) of CHED Memorandum Order No. 20, series of 2011, provides that Special Trust Fund (STF) refers to income of the SUC arising from the collection of tuition fees, miscellaneous fees, service and other income. This is broken down into:

		

			(1) Tuition Fees for use by the SUC in carrying out its trifocal function; instruction, research and extension, and production, as well as defray its administrative costs;

	     (2) Fiduciary Fund;

		    (3) Revenues collected by self-liquidating units;

		    (4) Revenues generated by IGUs;

			    (5) Regular and other Trust Fund without separate depository account

		

	Likewise, Article I, Section 3(e) of CHED MO No. 20-2011 defines Fiduciary Fund as funds to which collection of fees for specific purpose shall accrue and shall be used solely for the purpose for which it was authorized to be collected.  

	

	Section 18(d), Rule V of the IRR of RA No. 8292 further provides that “any income generated by the university or college from tuition fees and other charges, as well as from the operation of auxiliary services and land grants, shall be retained by the university or college; and may be disbursed by its Governing Board for instruction, research, extension or other programs/projects of the university or college”. 	

		

		Item 2 of COA Circular No. 2000-02 dated April 4, 2000 provides: 

	

	2.1 The following provisions of R.A. No. 8292 and R.A. No. 8745, the General Appropriations Act for CY 1999 are hereby reiterated:       

	

	2.1.1 All income of SUCs from tuition fees and other necessary charges such as: matriculation fees, graduation fees, laboratory fees, medical and dental fees, library fees, athletic fees and other similar fees shall be deposited in an AGDB and constituted as STF. All interests that shall accrue therefrom shall form part of the same Fund.       

	

	 xxx

	

	2.1.3 All fiduciary fees shall be disbursed for the specific purposes for which they are collected.       

		

		Verification of documents showed that receipts and collections of various fees  from the students, and income from special projects of the University totalling P8,711,640.43 were recorded as Trust Liabilities under Trust Fund 401 instead of Business Income under the Special Trust Fund (Fund 164) as required under Article I, Section 3 of CMO No. 20-2011 and Volume III of GAM for NGAs requiring agencies to use the Revised Chart of Accounts to properly recognize and present financial transactions which includes:

			

		

		Account

		Description

		

		 Business Income -

		    School Fees

		This account is used to recognize the fees imposed to students of state universities, colleges and public schools.  It includes tuition, registration, athletic, cultural, diploma and graduation, transcript of record, library, training, entrance examination fee, comprehensive examination fee, and the like.  The account shall be closed to Revenue and Expense Summary Account.  

		

		The said amount should have been part of the Special Trust Fund as fiduciary fees to be used solely for the purpose for which they were collected.

		

--		Due to National Government Agencies (NGAs) - P11,837,797.09

		

		Receipt of funds from other government agencies and other offices for other purposes that were subject to liquidation amounting to P11,837,797.09 were also recorded as Trust Liability instead of recording them as Due to National Government Agencies (NGAs), thus also resulted in the overstatement of the Trust Liabilities account.  Chapter III of GAM Volume III, which requires agencies to use the RCA states that “Due to NGAs account is used to recognize the receipt of funds for delivery of goods/services as authorized by law, fund transfers from NGAs, other than the BIR, for implementation of specific programs or projects and other interagency transactions”. This account is debited for delivery of goods /services, liquidation of funds received and settlement of liabilities. 

		

		Inquiry from personnel concerned revealed that it has been the practice of the Accounting office to classify the said accounts as Trust Liabilities.  While these funds were not reported to the BOR upon receipt from various agencies, the University seeks the approval of procurement of goods and infrastructures from the BOR for transactions chargeable against the said fund. 

		

--			Income-Seminar/Training Fees - P1,166,272.62

		

	Receipts and collections of registration fees for seminars and workshops conducted by the University amounting to P1,166,272.62 were recorded as Trust Liabilities under Fund 401 instead of income under the account Seminar/Training Fees for Fund 164 as provided under Chapter III of GAM, Volume III, which states, among others, that  Seminar/Training Fees account is used to recognize the fees collected or billed for attendance in short course trainings and seminars/workshops. 

	

	The Accounting Staff in charge of the account also declared that it has been the practice of the Accounting office to record the receipts and collections of registration fees for seminars and workshops conducted by the University as Trust Liabilities.  

		

		Paragraph 3 of the IPSAS 1 states that the responsibility for the fair presentation and reliability of financial statements rests with the management of the reporting agency, particularly the head of finance/accounting office and the head of agency or his authorized representative.

		

		The foregoing noted deficiencies, rendered the reported balance of the Trust Liabilities account as of year-end inaccurate and unreliable, thus affecting the fair presentation of the said account in the Financial Statements.

		

		

		We recommended and management agreed to instruct the University Accountant to:

	

	a. Analyze and reconcile the items under the Trust Liabilities account specifically those without supporting schedules and with negative balances; 

	

b)		Determine the proper classification of the items under Trust Liabilities as provided under Volume III of GAM for NGAs in the recognition of  transactions in the books of accounts; and

	

c)		Effect necessary adjusting entries to properly classify the receipts/collections of funds to appropriate accounts and transfer them to the Special Trust Fund in compliance with CHED MO No. 20-2011.



	

	5)	The accuracy and reliability of the Due to National Government Agencies (NGAs) account amounting to P59,619,843.44 as of December 31, 2020 could not be ascertained due to a) discrepancy of P10,638,001.43 between the General Ledger (GL) and the Subsidiary Ledgers; b) inclusion of  dormant accounts of  P10,948,610.83; and c) abnormal/negative balance amounting to P8,870,914.89 in violation of the provisions of Section 111 and 112 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 and COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994,  resulting in the  misstatement of the Due to NGAs account as presented in the financial statements.   



The Due to NGAs represents fund transfers of other government agencies specifically for purposes indicated in the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between the University and the granting agencies.



	Section 111 (1) of PD No. 1445 states that “the accounts of an agency shall be kept in such detail as is necessary to meet the needs of the agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or control agencies of the government. Section 114 (2) thereof, states that subsidiary records shall be kept where necessary”.



	Likewise, paragraphs 4.9 and 6.7 of COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994 on the grant, utilization and liquidation of funds transferred to implementing agencies states that “the Implementing Agency shall return to the Source Agency any unused balances upon completion of the project”.



		Review of the Due to NGAs account for all funds totaling P59,619,843.44 as of December 31, 2021 revealed the following deficiencies:



a. 	Discrepancy of P10,638,001.43 between the balances per General Ledger (GL) and Subsidiary Ledgers (SL):



Comparison of both the GL and the SLs disclosed a discrepancy amounting to  P10,638,001.43, as shown in detail in the following table:

The Accounting Staff stated that the discrepancy was a carryover from prior years’ unreconciled balances and that review and reconciliation of the accounts are currently being performed.



b. 	Inclusion of dormant accounts of   P10,948,610.83 



Of the total Due to NGAs of P59,619,843.44 as of December 31, 2020,  P10,948,610.83 refers to unutilized funds that remained dormant for three to ten years, as follows: 

	

Age of Due to NGAs Account

Amount

3 to 5 Years

P 983,227.45

6 to 10 Years

9,965,383.38

Total

P10,948,610.83



Considering the length of time that these balances remained dormant, the University should have returned them to the respective source agency/ies and/or National Treasury so that the payable account shall be  recognized as closed and fully liquidated in the books. 



Included also in the Due to NGAs account are balances amounting to  P59,052.50  and P1,338,875.39 under the  General Fund (GF) and  Special Trust Fund (STF), respectively, and considered dormant for undetermined period.  According to the accounting personnel, the length of existence of these balances cannot be determined since records to support the amounts are not available.



Section 10 of the General Provisions of the General Appropriations Act of Fiscal Year 2020, provides for the “Reversion, Closure, and Transfer of Balances of Special Accounts, Fiduciary or Trust Funds, Revolving Funds, and Unauthorized Accounts. Departments, bureaus, offices, and instrumentalities of the National Government, including Constitutional Offices enjoying fiscal autonomy and SUCs are mandated to close and revert all balances of Special Accounts, Fiduciary or Trust Funds, and Revolving Funds to the General Fund in any of the following instances; (i) when there is no legal basis for its creation; (ii) when their terms have expired; or (iii) when they are no longer necessary for the attainment of the purposes for which said funds were established”.  



Pursuant to the above quoted provisions, the University should have returned the dormant accounts under the STF and GF to the National Treasury to close the account. 



c.       Abnormal/Negative Balances of   P8,870,914.89



	Section 112 of PD No. 1445 provides that “each government agency shall record its financial transactions and operations conformably with generally accepted accounting principles and in accordance with pertinent laws and regulations”. 



	Further review of the Due to NGAs account disclosed that there were negative balances of transferred funds for some projects in the amount of P8,870,914.89 as of December 31, 2021, presented in the following table:

			

Due to NGAs with Negative Balances

BFAR-Aquasilviculture

(58,850.00)

DA-BFAR

(58,184.43)

Total

(8,870,914.89)



As can be gleaned from the above table, aside from the negative balances in CHED ESGPPA and Microalgaes, there are other four transferred funds with negative/abnormal balances at the end of CY 2020. According to the accounting personnel, the negative balances were due to errors in recording funds from granting agencies as Trust Liabilities instead of Due to NGAs and committed to review and reconcile the negative balances.  



	The inclusion of unreconciled and negative/abnormal and misclassified balances rendered the balance of the Due to NGAs account as of December 31, 2020 unreliable thus, affecting the fair presentation of the said account in the financial statements.



	We recommended that the University President instruct the University Accountant to:

	

	a) evaluate the completed projects and initiate the immediate return of the unused and dormant funds to the Source Agencies/National Treasury; and

	

	b) reconcile the negative balances and the difference between the general and subsidiary ledgers and schedule of Due to NGAs and adjust any discrepancies noted.



The Management commented that the standing reconciliation from last year to current year are still in progress. Confirmation of balances from the granting agencies and aging of accounts shall be prioritized.  





	6)		Non-compliance with the rules and regulations on the grant, utilization and liquidation of Cash Advances (CAs) as prescribed under Section 89 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445, COA Circular Nos. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 and 2012-004 dated November 28, 2012 resulted in the accumulation of unliquidated cash advance balances amounting to P15,267,102.28 as of December 31, 2020.



COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 provides the guidelines and limitations on the granting, utilization and liquidation of cash advances, to wit:



Section 5.1	The AO shall liquidate his cash advance as follows:



5.1.1 Salaries, Wages, etc. - within five (5) days after each fifteen (15) day/end of the month pay period.



5.1.2 Petty Operating Expenses and Field Operating Expenses - within twenty (20) days after the end of the year; subject to replenishment as frequently as necessary during the year.



5.1.3 Official Travel - within sixty (60) days after return to the Philippines in the case of foreign travel or within thirty (30) days after return to his permanent official station in the case of local travel, as provided for in EO 248 and COA Circular No. 96-004.



Failure of the AO to liquidate his cash advance within the prescribed period shall constitute a valid cause for the withholding of his salary and the instruction of other sanctions as provided for under paragraphs 9.2 and 9.3 hereof.



Section 4.1.2	No additional cash advances shall be allowed to any official or any employee unless the previous cash advance given to him is first settled or a proper accounting thereof is made

	

Section 4.1.3	A cash advance shall be reported on as soon as the purpose for which it was given has been served



Likewise, Item No. 1 of COA Circular No. 2012-004 dated November 28, 2012 provides that, “xxx. Included among operating expenses are cash advances for the payment of honoraria and similar payments to officials and employees; operating expenditures for special projects and activities like anniversary celebration; and special purpose and time bound activity like cultural and athletic activities. These must be liquidated within twenty (20) days from accomplishment of the purpose”. 



Further, Section 89 of PD No. 1445 provides that “no cash shall be given unless for a legally authorized specific purpose. A cash advance shall be reported on and liquidated as soon as the purpose for which it was given has been served. No additional cash advance shall be allowed to any official or employee unless the previous cash advance given to him is first settled or a proper accounting thereof is made”.



Breakdown of the Advances account as of December 31, 2020 in the Statement of Financial Position (SFP) of the University is shown in the following table:

		Analysis of the grant, utilization and liquidation of CAs revealed the following deficiencies:

	

a)		CAs were granted to faculty members and employees of the University despite non-liquidation of the previous CAs contrary to Item 4.1.2 of the said COA Circular 97-002 which provides that “no additional CAs shall be allowed to any official or employee unless the previous CAs given is first settled or a proper accounting thereof is made”.

	

b)		Cash advances for official local and foreign travels were liquidated beyond the prescribed 30 and 60 days period, respectively, stated under item 5.1.3 of the same COA Circular No. 97-002. The table below shows the aging of unliquidated cash advance for local and foreign travels amounting to P3,498,495.13 as of December 31, 2020:

c.    CAs for traveling expenses were granted to personnel hired through job order contracts contrary to Item 3.2.2 of the same COA Circular No. 97-002 which provides that travel expenditures, including transportation fare, travel allowance, hotel room/lodging expenses and other expenses may be granted to officials and employees with official travel duly authorized by the Head of the Agency. The grant of CAs to contractual employees and/or Job Order personnel exposed the University to possible loss of government funds in view of the nature and uncertainty of employment of the said employees/personnel. Contractual employees’ tenure of service largely depends on the possible renewal of their Contracts of Service (COS) with the University.  As observed in the past, some of the AOs with COS status who were given cash advances left the University without settling their obligations by reason of resignation or termination of contract. 



d.   Advances to Special Disbursing Officers (SDO) for the payment of incidental expenses, activities and undertakings such as sports, meetings, programs, and hazard pay which were already completed/accomplished remained unliquidated as of cut-off date contrary to the said COA Circular No. 2012-004 which states that cash advances for specific undertakings should be liquidated within twenty (20) days from accomplishment of the purpose.  While clearance was not issued to the former Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) upon her retirement on October 2020, liquidation/return of her outstanding CA amounting to P120,000.00 for sports activities should have been enforced/demanded even before the date of her retirement.  



e.	Employees with long outstanding cash advances were allowed to pay through salary deduction, contrary to the provisions of the same COA-Circular 97-002, which requires liquidation of CAs in full amount.



The above observations reflected the University’s laxity in the granting, utilization and liquidation of CAs, resulting in the accumulation of CAs to P15,267,102.28 as of December 31, 2020.  



We recommended that the University President instruct the concerned officials, through the University Accountant to:

	

a)		Refrain from giving additional CAs to officials and employees with unliquidated CAs; and

	

b)		Direct the Accountable Officers concerned to liquidate CAs as soon as the purpose of the CA has been served or within the prescribed period; and



c)		Cause the immediate liquidation/settlement of long outstanding cash advances by exhausting all possible remedies provided by existing regulations.





The Management committed to direct the accounting office to strictly enforce/require the liquidation of previous CAs before processing of new CAs.   For the Disbursing Officers of the external campuses, an allowance of five days in the submission of liquidation reports shall be implemented.  Extra effort shall be exerted to locate accountable officers with outstanding CAs.





	7)	The hiring of Job Order workers to perform regular function of the University is contrary to Item 7.2 of CSC-COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 1, series of 2017, hence salaries and wages paid to them totaling  P28,600,473.60 may be considered irregular.    



Sections 7.2 of CSC-COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 1, series of 2017, were among the limitations provided in the hiring of Job Orders, quoted as follows:



7.2 Hiring of Job Order workers shall be limited to emergency or intermittent work, such as clearing of debris on the roads, canals, waterways, etc. after natural man-made disasters/occurrences; other trades and crafts, and manual tasks such as carpentry, plumbing, painting, electrical, and the like which are not part of the regular functions of the agency.” 



Contract of service and job order workers should not, in any case, be made to perform functions which are part of the job description of the agency’s existing regular employees.



Audit of CY 2020 transactions showed that the University incurred a total amount of P28,600,473.60  for payment of salaries of JOs with equivalent salary grades 4 to 14, as follows ( Annex D):

As can be gleaned from the preceding tables, the hired JO workers performed the regular functions of the University personnel, contrary to Section 7.2 of CSC-COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 1, series of 2017.  It was also noted that those receiving lower salary rates performed functions that required special skills such as accounting and bookkeeping as they were the ones who prepare reports to be submitted to the Board of Regents (BOR), Commission On Audit (COA), and Department of Budget Management (DBM). It was likewise noted that there were hired JOs who received salary rates more than or twice the amount of a permanent employee whose positions are under Salary Grade (SG) 6 and below.  



Interview with the designated HRM Officer disclosed that the University did not use any criteria in the designation of positions to the JOs and the salary rates/grades.  JOs with higher salary rates were the results of the department/office requests of personnel,   approved by the University President without the review and evaluation of the HRM office of the qualifications of the applicant,  contrary to Section 11 of CSC-COA-DBM JC which provides that “In accordance with Section 90 of the General Provisions of the FY 2017 General Appropriations Act, government agencies shall review their functions, systems and procedures, organizational structure and staffing to determine the appropriate manpower complement for their programs/ activities/projects. Creation of permanent positions may be considered for regular functions, while hiring of casual or contractual personnel may be considered for projects and activities that are temporary in nature, subject to approval of the oversight agencies concerned and to existing budgeting and accounting rules and regulations.” 



The hiring of JOs to perform the functions of regular position is strictly prohibited under CSC-COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 1, series of 2017.  Hence, the salaries paid to the JOs can be considered as irregular expenditures defined in Section 3 of COA Circular 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012 as “Those incurred without adhering to established rules, regulations, procedural guidelines, policies, principles or practices that have gained recognition in laws. Irregular expenditures are incurred if funds are disbursed without conforming with prescribed usages and rules of discipline. xxx .  A transaction which fails to follow or violates appropriate rules of procedure is likewise irregular.”



We recommended that the University President instruct the Vice President for Finance and Administration (VPFA)/Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) /HRMO to a) facilitate the hiring of personnel and fill up all vacant positions to complement work load of both supervisory and clerical functions; b) assess current organizational structure and consider requesting additional  plantilla  positions from the DBM to lessen the hiring of JOs; and c) adhere strictly with the rules and regulations in the hiring of JOs under existing regulations.



The OIC-HRMO stated that there is no available plantilla for administrative staff, hence, the University cannot hire additional permanent employees to augment the present inadequate number of personnel.  Management cited Chapter 7, Book VI , Section 58 of  EO No. 292,  that the University may hire contractual personnel including job orders and contract of service workers when the agency itself cannot provide the daily services needed of its administrative operation.

	

The Management was hopeful for the approval of the Revised Organizational Structure and Staffing Standards for SUCs (ROSS) which will provide additional plantilla items thus, avoiding the employment of JOs. Currently, the PSU undertakes measures to address issues relative to the noted observation. Filling up of vacant positions, assessment of current plantilla items and strict adherence to existing regulations are among the   proposed solutions of the HRMO on the audit issue.



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



 Section 58, Book VI, Chapter 7 of EO 292 states that “Contracting of Activities.—Agencies may enter into contracts with individuals or organizations, both public and private, subject to provisions of law and applicable guidelines approved by the President: Provided, that contracts shall be for specific services which cannot be provided by the regular staff of the agency, shall be for a specific period of time, and shall have a definite expected output: Provided, further, That implementing, monitoring and other regular and recurring agency activities shall not be contracted for, except for personnel hired on an individual and contractual basis and working as part of the organization, or as otherwise may be approved by the President:”



The above regulation did not specifically provides that agencies can hire job order   workers to provide services needed in the daily course of its administration as it is contrary to Section7.2 of CSC-COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 1, series of 2017.





	8)	Payment of  honoraria to Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) members, BAC Secretariat and Technical Working Group (TWG) amounting to P1,208,500.00 under Fund 101 and P1,674,500.00 under Fund 401 were not  in accordance with the provisions under Section 5.7.1 of Commission On Audit (COA) Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012, COA Circular No. 2003-04 dated July 30, 2003, Department of Budget and  Management (DBM)  Budget Circular (BC) No. 2004-5A and DBM BC No. 2007-3 or the Guidelines on the Grant of Honoraria to Government Personnel Involved in Government Procurement,  and BIR Revenue Regulation No. 11-2018  dated January 31, 2018 on withholding of taxes on compensation.



Honorarium is a form of compensation granted to individuals for the performance of tasks or involvement in activities beyond their regular functions.  Section 15 of the IRR of RA No. 9184 states that the procuring entity may grant payment of honoraria to the BAC members in an amount not to exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of their respective basic monthly salary subject to availability of funds, for this purpose, the DBM shall promulgate the necessary guidelines.  The procuring entity may also grant payment of honoraria to the BAC Secretariat and the TWG members, subject to the relevant rules of the DBM.



 As mandated by the above cited law, DBM BC No. 2004-5A dated October 7, 2005 and DBM BC No. 2007-3 dated November 29, 2007 was promulgated to provide guidelines on the grant of honoraria and overtime pay to government personnel involved in government procurement activities.     



For CYs 2019 to 2020, payments of BAC honoraria under Funds 101 and 401 amounted to P1,208,500.00 and P1,674,500.00, respectively, as shown in the following table:

Total

Review of the above payments showed that:



a)	Disbursement Vouchers (DVs) on payment of BAC honoraria totaling P2,883,000.00 were not supported with the documentary requirements as specifically enumerated under   Section 5.7.1 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 such as the minutes of the BAC meeting, notice of award to the winning bidder of procurement activity being claimed, certification that the procurement involves competitive bidding as well as the attendance sheet listing the names of attendees to the BAC meeting.  Although the disbursement vouchers on the payments of honoraria were supported with the office orders creating/designating the BAC members with authority to collect honoraria and lists of procured of goods and services, there was no clear presentation of who among the BAC members were present in each completed/awarded procurements.



b)	The amount of honoraria claimed by five  personnel involved in the procurement activities of the University exceeded the rates indicated under Item 5.3 of the DBM Budget Circular which prescribed the allowed amount of honoraria for completed project. Pursuant to Section 7 of the Implementing Rules and Regulations Part A (IRR-A) of RA No. 9184, a procurement project refers to the entire project identified, described, detailed, scheduled and budgeted for in the Project Procurement Management Plan (PPMP) prepared by the agency.   A procurement project shall be considered successfully completed once the contract has been awarded to the winning bidder as stated under Item 5.1 of DBM BC No. 2004-5A. Item 5.3 of DBM BC No. 2004-5A  provides the allowed rates of BAC honoraria, as follows:







5.3    The honoraria of each person shall not exceed the rates indicated below per completed procurement project:



BAC Chair		        P 3,000.00

BAC Members                         2,500.00

TWG Chair Members               2,000.00 



5.4 The average amount of honoraria per month over one year shall not exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of the basic monthly salary. The honoraria, however, shall be paid only upon the successful completion of each procurement activity. 



Review of the amount of honoraria granted to each member of the BAC, TWG and Secretariat, showed that five personnel consisting of three Job Orders, one Faculty member and one administrative employee exceeded the 25 percent of   their annual salary limitation (Annex E), as follows:

c)	The Accountant, Cashier and Supply Officer were paid honoraria amounting to P448,000.00(Annex E), contrary to Item 5.6 of DBM BC No. 2004-5A 



Item 5.6 of DBM BC No.2004-5A specifically states that the members of the BAC Secretariat who are performing the attendant functions in addition to their regular duties in other non-procurement units of the agency may likewise be paid honoraria at the same rate as the TWG Chair and Members subject to the same regulations.  



      Under the Special Order signed by the University President dated November 19, 2018, both the University Accountant and the Cashier were designated as Technical Assistants to the BAC who will work closely with the Procurement Office to ensure that documentary requirements in the payment of projects reported to be completed are strictly observed. 



COA Circular 2003-004 dated July 30, 2003 clearly emphasized that the Chief Accountant and personnel of the Accounting Unit of any agency of the government are prohibited from being regular members of the agency's BAC as contemplated under the Implementing Rules and Regulations of R.A. No. 9184. However, they may serve as provisional members when the Unit is the end-user of the items, subject of the bidding. Since they are tasked to approve the vouchers in payment for such goods and services procured and of the infrastructure prosecuted and to certify to the availability of funds for the project subject of the bidding, it becomes necessary to ensure that the procurement and payment functions are segregated in keeping with the rules and principles of good internal control and to avert the possibility of conflict of interest that may arise.



Likewise, the Supply Officer who occupies a position involved in the procurement activities of the University, is not entitled to receive honoraria.



In lieu of honoraria, the payment of overtime services may be allowed for the administrative staff, such as clerks, messengers and drivers supporting the BAC, the TWG and the Secretariat, for procurement activities rendered in excess of official working hours. 



d)	Review of payrolls covering payment of honoraria to University officials and employees involved in procurement activities disclosed that withholding taxes were not deducted as required under Revenue Regulation No. 11-2018 dated January 31, 2018.





There is indeed nothing wrong in granting additional benefits to government personnel in the performance of activities or discharging duties in addition to or over and above their regular functions as long as it is guided by existing regulations.  Equity calls for equal compensation for performance of substantially similar duties, with substantially similar degrees of responsibility. Propriety dictates that only persons who have successfully completed their tasks or participated in accomplished activities ought to be compensated (Item 4 DBM BC 2004-5A).  





       	We recommended that the University President:



a.	Require the University Accountant/BAC Secretariat to submit the additional supporting documents necessary for the claims of honoraria;



b.	Cause the personnel concerned to refund the excess honoraria paid to   them;



d)	Instruct the University Accountant to determine the legitimate personnel who should be allowed to claim honoraria; and 



e)	Require the University Accountant to ensure that withholding taxes are deducted from payments of honoraria in accordance with the Revised Withholding Tax Table and the same are remitted to the BIR within the prescribed period. 



The Management informed that it already reminded the Accounting Office to strictly require the complete supporting documents in the processing of disbursements of BAC Honoraria, agreed to limit the attendance of legitimate BAC members to the bidding process and to strictly observe the 25percent of the annual salary limit of honoraria.





9.   Distribution and use of prepaid cellular cards and postpaid subscription plans were not properly monitored and controlled due to the absence of policy in the grant and utilization of communication allowance,  hence its economical  use was not ensured, contrary to Section 2 of Presidential Decree (PD) No.  1445.



Section 2 of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1445 states that "it is the declared policy of the State that all resources of the government shall be managed, expended or utilized in accordance with law and regulations, and safeguard against loss or wastage through illegal or improper disposition, with a view to ensuring efficiency, economy and effectiveness in the operations of government. The responsibility to take care that such policy is faithfully adhered to rests directly with the chief or head of the government agency concerned. 



On October 15, 2018, the University President issued an unnumbered   memorandum amending the allocation of communication allowance of specific university officials and employees and their respective offices ranging from P 300.00 to actual expense per month, as follows:

The above mentioned personnel are provided with communication allowance, both for prepaid cards and postpaid subscription plans with their preferred telecommunications network which incurred expenses amounting to  P1,678,165.49 (Annex F) as of December 31, 2020.   On top of these, expenses for 44 PLDT landlines (Annex G) amounting to P1,074,503.42 (Annex F) and internet connections in the offices of the University were maintained, hence the University incurred total Telephone Expenses of P2,752,668.91for the year 2020.  



Further review of the Telephone Expenses under the Communication Expenses account as of December 31, 2020, disclosed the following: 



a)	All postpaid subscriptions were in the name of the University Officials and employees instead of the name of the University.  Since the contracts of subscriptions were in the personal account/names as confirmed from the Statement of Account, this denotes that the agreement was personal in nature;



b)	Post-paid subscriptions were also reimbursed without the certification that only official calls were made for the plan;



c)	Two post-paid mobile phone lines were allowed to 44 (Annex H) officials and employees who were granted communication allowance which can be considered as excessive expenditures;



d)	37 offices are provided PLDT landlines and internet connections,  thus  provision of prepaid and postpaid line subscriptions to personnel with ranks lower than Division Chiefs is unnecessary;        



e)	The grant of communication allowance based on actual expenses of the University President was not approved by the BOR, hence self-serving in nature;



f)	Detailed review of  the Billing Statement of  line subscriptions further revealed that:





			i)	Prepaid Loading Services to other cellphone numbers was incurred ranging   from    P300.00   to P500.00  monthly; 

			ii)	Entertainment add-ons such as   entertainment and mobile games   formed part of the plan on top of the regular plan;

			iii)	 Additional charges for voice call roaming while outside the country  were paid by the University aside from the  data charges;

			iv)	Random confirmation  of postpaid plan revealed that  2 postpaid plans  was used by  employees other than the personnel granted with communication allowance;

			v)	There are officials who do not attach the detailed billing statement to the reimbursement of postpaid plans which hindered the accounting section to determine any unofficial calls.



	The lack of mechanism to ensure that communication allowance granted to officers and employees were economical and used for official purpose only runs contrary to Section 2 of PD No. 1445.





We recommended that the University President: 



a.	Adopt a policy on the grant of communication allowance to be approved by the BOR taking into consideration the following matters:



i)	officials/employees entitled to communication allowance should not be lower than Division Chief rank;



ii)	reasonable amount of cell card/ load allowance to be provided in addition to available landlines/mobile phones and internet connection; and



iii)	use of mobile phone plans with unlimited calls/text to all networks offered by various telecommunication companies and one unit postpaid line subscription policy for proper monitoring.

To cut-off and avoid the continuity of bill service to lines no longer used, and/or transfer to other departments.



A)	GENDER AND DEVELOPMENT (GAD) IMPLEMENTATION



10)	Out of the Gender and Development (GAD) Plan and Budget of P27,778,000.00 or 5.87 percent  of its annual appropriations in the General    Appropriations    Act   (GAA) of P473,157,000.00  for Calendar Year (CY) 2020,  only P380,234.20 was utilized, hence affected the University’s goals to attain GAD objectives.  Moreover, the University failed to  utilize the Harmonized Gender and Development Guidelines (HGDG) tool in attributing major programs of the University to the GAD Budget under  Joint Circular (JC) No. 2012-01 of Philippine Commission on Women (PCW), National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA), and Department of Budget and Management (DBM),  thus actual costs/expenditures reflected in the submitted GAD Accomplishment Report (AR) are unreliable and unverifiable as to their gender responsiveness.



Executive Order (EO) No. 273,  Approving and Adopting the Philippine Plan for Gender Responsive  Development (PPGD 1995-2025) mandates agencies to take appropriate steps to ensure the full implementation of the policies/strategies and programs/projects  to incorporate and reflect GAD  concerns in their agency performance commitment contracts, annual budget proposals, and work and financial plans.  



Pursuant to Republic Act 9710 or the Magna Carta of Women (MCW) and the General Appropriations Act (GAA), State Universities and Colleges (SUCs), shall formulate their annual GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) within the context of their mandates to mainstream gender perspective in their policies, programs and projects.  GAD planning shall be integrated in the regular activities of the agencies, the cost of implementation of which shall be at least 5 percent of their total budgets.  



Section 6.4 of PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01 prescribed the HGDG tool and the following score card that can be utilized by an agency in determining the extent of the existing and major activities that can be attributed to GAD budget, to wit:



Below 4.0

GAD is invisible

0% or no amount of the program budget for the year may be attributed to the GAD budget

4.0-7.9

Promising GAD Prospects(conditional Pass)

25% of the budget for the year of the program may be attributed to the GAD budget

8.0-14.9

Gender Sensitive

50% of the budget for the year of the program may be attributed to GAD 

15.0-19.9

Gender Responsive

75% of the budget for the year of the program may be attributed to the GAD budget

20.0

Fully gender responsive 

100% of the budget for the year of the program may be attributed to the GAD budget



Depending on the score on the HGDG, a percentage of the budget of the existing and proposed major program may be attributed to the GAD budget.  The University will set a target score in the HGDG, and whatever is the score that it wants to achieve, it should plan and estimate the cost of interventions (or gender mainstreaming) to achieve its target and include them in the GAD plan.      



In the preparation of the GAD Accomplishment Report (AR), the agency will again administer the HGDG test to determine the extent that the targeted HGDG score is attained.  This score will be the basis in determining actual expenditures   that can be attributed to the GAD budget.  



For CY 2020, the University’s total appropriation amounted to P473,157,000.00.  Of the said appropriation, P27,778,000.00 or 5.87 percent was allotted for GAD activities consisting of 15 major programs as shown in the CY 2020 GAD Plan and Budget (GPB).  Of the 15 major programs in the GPB, eight were Organization Focused with total budget of P13,578,000.00 while seven were Client Focused amounting to P14,200,000.00 or a total of P27,778,000.00.       



 The University’s GAD AR showed that out of the total GAD budget of P27,778,000.00, only P380,234.20 or 1.37 percent was utilized/expended.  Most of the planned GAD activities were not undertaken, as presented in the following table:

Based on the above accomplishments, the University failed to implement fully the planned GAD activities and projects, contrary to EO No. 273. 



The reported GAD AR mostly include the conduct of the same activities such as attendance to seminars related to GAD, celebration of Women’s Month, conduct of trainings/seminars for students and employees on GAD issues, posting of GAD materials in the GAD bulletin boards and other similar activities.  The Team likewise noted that the construction of the GAD building which was 100 percent completed as per the Government Programs, Projects and Activities (GPPA) Report as of September 23, 2019 was not included in the GAD AR for CYs  2019 or 2020.    



It was also observed that for the past four years, only one  to six percent of the annual GBP budget was utilized, as shown as follows:

Based on the GAD AR, the HGDG Tool was not utilized in determining the percentage of expenses of the University’s programs that can be attributed to GAD budget, as it   reflected only the actual cost/expenditures that are identifiable as GAD activity.



Item 3.3 of JC 2012-01 of PCW/DBM/NEDA provides that mainstreaming gender perspectives in agency PAPs to attain the desired outcomes for GAD shall be a priority in GAD planning and budgeting.  Using the 5 percent GAD budget for gender mainstreaming is a way for agencies to influence the entire agency program, plan and budget.  Activities to address these concerns through capacity development on GAD or GAD focused activities should be included in agency GPBs.



According to the GAD Director, the GAD Focal Point System (GFPS) of the University have not been strengthened and fully functional because there is no clear understanding and appreciation of gender mainstreaming in the GPB.  The GFPS, as agency personnel responsible for implementing programs, activities and projects addressing gender issues, it is the GFPS who advocates for, coordinates, guides and monitors the development and implementation of the agency's GAD plan and GAD-related Programs, Activities and Projects (PAPs).



 As emphasized in the Revised Guidelines in the Preparation of GAD Agenda, the vision and mission of the University may be achieved through formulation of direction and determining the purpose based on mandate, priorities and thrust to achieve gender equality and women empowerment.  The   application of the HGDG tool is necessary in the analysis of the GPB to attribute the major programs and projects of the University in assessing gender responsiveness. 



We recommended that the University President as the head of the GAD Focal Point System (GFPS) instruct the GAD Director to:  



a)	ensure full implementation of the planned GAD programs and activities as stated in the GPB;



b)	regularly assess the GAD plans through the use of the HGDG tool as prescribed in PCW/NEDA/DBM Joint Circular No.2012-01; and



c)	conduct on line teleconferencing training/seminars for all faculty and administrative personnel involve in GAD mainstreaming through the use of HGDG and other tools mandated by GAD regulations.



The Management informed that the GAD Office consistently abides in the monitoring by the PCW on the required submission of the Annual GAD Plan every 3rd quarter, evaluated and returned for implementation.  The 2020 GAD Plan and budget was not undertaken due to the sudden COVID-19 pandemic that stopped the conduct of face to face GAD activities.   The GAD Director also committed to continue to serve the PSU Organization and client-based GAD PAPs towards achieving a successful and working GAD. The unit has not been remiss in pushing for its campaigns, however, without the support from the GAD Focal Point System/University President, the office is limited in the performance of its duties. 



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



The Audit Team appreciates the plan of action of the GAD Directors office,    however the GAD Focal Point System must be fully functional and  all concerned officials must work together to attain the desired outcomes for gender mainstreaming.
