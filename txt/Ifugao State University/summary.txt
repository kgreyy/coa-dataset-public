IFSU started in 1920 as a Farm Settlement School. In 1972, it was elevated into Ifugao Agricultural and Technical College (IATC) offering secondary and tertiary/undergraduate courses. In 1982, it was further expanded into Ifugao State College of Agriculture and Forestry (ISCAF) offering various Baccalaureate and Masters courses. 



On October 14, 2009, Republic Act No. 9720 was signed into law formally converting ISCAF into what is now known as Ifugao State University (IFSU) with campuses in Lamut (Main Campus), Aguinaldo, Hapao (in Hungduan), Lagawe, Potia (in Alfonso Lista) and Tinoc. 



Formal launching and operation of IFSU started on January 6, 2010 with the adoption of its Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR), the University Code and University Development Plan.

C)	Independent Auditor’s Report



We rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the financial statements of Ifugao State University, for the year ended December 31, 2020, due to the following:



1)	The balance of the Cash In Bank-Local Currency, Current Account (CIB-LCCA) as of yearend amounting to Ꝑ129,355,783.87 was understated by Ꝑ18,294,150.18 due to unrecorded deposits, disbursements, credit and debit memos and cancelled/stale checks, erroneous adjusting entries and misstated amounts, among others, which also   understated the Trust Liabilities account by Ꝑ15,285,200.00; thus, affecting their fair presentation in the financial statements. 



2)	Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) accounts listed in the Financial Statements at a total cost of Ꝑ872,206,237.97 (excluding Construction in Progress), were not adequately supported by the Report on the Physical Count of PPE (RPCPPE) and other property records; such that, no reconciliation of balances was made, including the variance of Ꝑ565,719,566.33 between the previous year’s financial statements and RPCPPE; casting doubt on the accuracy of the recorded accounts’ balances at yearend.  



3)	A parcel of land was recorded under the Land account even without clear ownership rights and without proper disclosure in the Notes to FS; thus, the Land account was overstated by Ꝑ1,879,150.00.



4)	A total of 1,067 disbursement vouchers issued and recorded during the year were not verified due to non-submission to COA; thereby, affecting the propriety and validity of the transactions and the accuracy of the recorded account balances in the financial statements in the aggregate amounts of P9,317,150.67, P42,557,534.93 and P37,991,824.55 under the Assets (excluding Cash), Liabilities, and Expenses accounts, respectively.  



5)					Undocumented past due Accounts Payable (AP) and Due to Officers and Employees amounting to ₱354,305.00 and ₱13,014.82, respectively, remained in the IGP books; affecting the reliability of the account balances. 



D)	Summary of Significant Observations and Recommendations

 

Other than the bases for the modified opinion on the financial statements, the following are some of the significant observations and recommendations, which were discussed with management in an exit conference on March 10, 2021 and whose comments were incorporated in the report, where appropriate:



1)					A total of ₱436,646.97 past due Accounts Receivable (AR) has accumulated under the Income Generating Projects (IGP) Fund due to inadequate monitoring and laxity of persons managing these IGPs; thereby, depriving the latter of the much needed funds for their operation. 



			We recommended that management cause the following:

	

				1.1. 	Collect the overdue receivables and impose the corresponding surcharges where applicable; and trace the nature of the other unknown accounts;

				

	1)					Conduct regular monitoring of all Receivable accounts, through the Accountant, to ensure that these are collected when they become due and demandable;

	

	2)					Strictly implement the provisions stipulated in the Lease Contracts for the Commercial Center and Food Court IGPs, specifically, the non-renewal of contracts unless balances are fully paid, and imposition of surcharges to late payees, respectively; and

	

	3)					Collect from officers who approved the purchase on account of IGP products by former University employees.



1)	Long outstanding Loans Receivable under the Student Assistance Fund for Education (SAFE) Loan Program amounting to Ꝑ1,562,160.24 remained uncollected as of yearend due to failure of Management to track the whereabouts of the student-borrowers and impose the provisions of the contract; thereby, depleting the revolving fund of the program. 

We reiterated our prior years’ recommendation that management locate the whereabouts of the students who are no longer with the University to settle their loans. 



We also recommended that management:

	1)	exhaust all measures of collection which include the issuance of demand letters not only to the student borrowers but also to the co-makers indicated in the contract; and 



	2)	consider requesting for write- off of dormant receivables following strictly the procedures under COA Circular 2016-005.



1)	Fund transfers amounting to Ꝑ1,578,742.59 received from other National Government Agencies remained unliquidated despite completion of the projects due to lack of monitoring; contrary to Chapter 6 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) and COA Circular No. 94-013.  Moreover, Fund Utilization Reports (FURs) were not timely submitted to the Source Agencies; resulting in discrepancies of the reciprocal account balances, Due To/From NGAs, between the source and implementing agencies in any particular period.



We recommended that management: 



	1)	return all unutilized balances of completed projects to the source agencies, and thereafter, submit the liquidation reports the soonest;



	2)	require the Accounting Office to regularly call for and monitor the liquidation of fund transfers for programs/projects under the Due to NGAS account; and 



	3)	submit FURs to source/funding agencies timely or as prescribed in the MOA, Project Implementation Guidelines and GAM. 



2)	Disbursements incurred under Inter-Agency Transferred Funds were not initially recognized under the appropriate asset or expense accounts, but directly debited to Due to NGAs; contrary to the prescribed accounting treatment under the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume 1.  This may result in exceeding the cost limitations in the Line Item Budget per project.



We recommended that management require the Accountant to strictly conform with the prescribed accounting entries of recording transactions for externally-funded projects, specifically those provided in the Government Accounting Manual for National Government Agencies, Volume 1. 



3)	Unutilized funds of five (5) extension programs to address the COVID 19 threat totaling Ꝑ840,814.65, were not returned immediately to the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) after their completion due to slow processing of liquidation documents, contrary to the provision in the Memoranda of Agreement; thus, depriving the CHED and other state universities and colleges of the immediate use of the fund.



We recommended that management refund immediately the unexpended Ꝑ840,814.65 to CHED in adherence to the provision of the MOA; and henceforth, require the Project Leaders of projects funded from transferred funds, to strictly follow the timelines in the MOA.
