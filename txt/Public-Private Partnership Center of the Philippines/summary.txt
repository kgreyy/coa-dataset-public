EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 

 

A. Introduction 

 

The Build-Operate and Transfer (BOT) Center was reorganized and renamed as 

the Public-Private Partnership Center of the Philippines (PPPCP) by virtue of 

Executive Order (EO) No. 8, series of 2010.  It was transferred as an attached 

agency from the Department of Trade and Industry to the National Economic and 

Development Authority (NEDA).  The PPPCP shall cover all Public-Private 

Partnership (PPP) programs and projects including all the variants or 

arrangements under Republic Act (RA) No. 7718, otherwise known as the BOT 

Law. 

 

Under EO No. 8, the PPPCP exercises, among others, the following powers and 

functions: 

 

a) Conduct project facilitation and assistance to the national implementing 
agencies, including government owned and controlled corporations and Local 

Government Units (LGUs) in addressing impediments or bottlenecks in the 

implementation of PPP programs and projects; 

 

b) Provide advisory services, technical assistance, trainings and capacity 

development to agencies/LGUs in PPP project preparation and development; 

 

c) Recommend plans, policies and implementation guidelines related to PPP in 

consultation with appropriate oversight committees, implementing agencies, 

LGUs and the private sectors; 

 

d)  Manage and administer a revolving fund to be known as the Project 

Development and Monitoring Facility for the preparation of business case, 

pre-feasibility and feasibility studies and tender documents of PPP programs 

and projects; and, 

 

e)   Perform such other function, which may be critical in expediting and 

implementing effectively the PPP programs and projects of the government. 

 

The PPPCP is headed by Executive Director Ferdinand Jesus A. Pecson and has 

128 plantilla positions of which 119 are filled-up as at December 31, 2020. One 

Contract of Service was hired during the year. 

 

Project Development and Monitoring Facility (PDMF) 

 

The PPPCP manages and administers the PDMF, formerly known as the Project

The PDMF fund is used to finance the conduct of business case, pre-feasibility 

and feasibility studies and preparation of tender documents of PPP programs and

implementation.

D. Audit Methodology 
 

We adopted a risk-based audit approached in the audit of the financial statements 

(FSs) of PPPCP and in the review of compliance with laws, rules and regulations.  

The Audit Team which carried out the audit, among others, (i) examined financial 

and accounting procedures adopted by the PPPCP and other relevant 

documentation; (ii) assessed internal controls regulating financial operations and 

carried out compliance testing for determining the extent of control in operation; 

(iii) conducted substantive testing of a representative sample of selected 

transactions; (iv) carried out review, on test check basis, of a number of contract 

and transactions related to movements in balances of assets, liabilities, revenues 

and expenses; and (v) conducted interviews and held discussions with the 

concerned officials and staff of the PPPCP.  

 

The results of the audit were communicated to the Head of the Agency and the 

concerned officials through the issuance of Audit Observation Memoranda. 

 

 

E. Independent Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements 
 

The Auditor rendered an unmodified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the 

FSs as at December 31, 2020. 

 

 

F. Summary of Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations 
 

The audit observations and corresponding recommendations discussed in Part II 

of this report are summarized, as follows: 

 

1. Obligations for undelivered  services and/or without complete and adequate 
supporting documents as at year-end  and those based only on Job Order (JO) 

contracts totaling P1.105 million and P228,100.00, respectively, were 

recognized under Accounts Payable which resulted in the overstatement of 

Accounts  Payable by P1.333 million and Janitorial Services, Other General 

Services, Printing and Publication Expenses, Repairs and Maintenance - 

Machinery and Equipment, Office Equipment and Rent/Lease Expenses by  

P28,287.63, P114,543.33, P1.107 million, P20,800.00 and P62,150.00 

respectively, and the understatement of Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) by 

P1.333 million. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief 

Administrative Officer, Finance Division to: (a) ensure that recorded 

payables in the books of accounts are for services rendered and goods 

delivered, and with complete and appropriate supporting documents; and 

(b) establish the validity of obligations/payables, analyze entries made 



 

v 

 

and make the necessary adjustments to correct the balances of the 

affected accounts.   

 

2. Erroneous recognition of 22 units of pocket Wi-Fi totaling P55,000.00 under 
Telephone Expenses resulted in the overstatement of the said account and the 

understatement of Semi-Expendable Communications Equipment, both by the 

same amount. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief 

Administrative Officer, Finance Division to reclassify the pocket Wi-Fi 

totaling P55,000.00 to Semi-Expendable Communications Equipment and 

make the corresponding adjustment to Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit). 

  

3. Non-reconciliation and/or non-confirmation of balances of receivables 
with/by Implementing Agencies (IAs) under Due from National Government 

Agencies, Due from Government-Owned or Controlled Corporations and 

Other Receivables totaling P1.095 billion, P176.952 million and P150.964 

million, respectively, had precluded the determination of the existence, 

completeness and accuracy of the balances of the said accounts at year-end. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief 

Administrative Officer, Finance Division to: (a) provide the 

Accountant/Finance Officer of the concerned IAs with the details of 

receivables and relevant documents to facilitate reconciliation of the 

reciprocal accounts between the PPPCP and IAs; (b) follow up the results 

of reconciliation with the Accountants/Finance Officers and settlements 

thereon; and (c) analyze and verify reconciling items and effect 

adjustments, as necessary, based on pertinent documents. 

 

The aforementioned observations and recommendations were discussed with 

concerned Management officials and personnel through virtual exit conference on 

March 24, 2021. Management’s views and comments were incorporated in the 

report, where appropriate. 

 

 

G. Status of Audit Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges 
 

As at December 31, 2020, the PPPCP’s unsettled disallowances amounted to 

P7.218 million.  The details are shown in Part II of this report.  

 

 

H. Status of Implementation of Prior Years’ Audit Recommendations 
 

Out of 18 prior years’ audit recommendations, 14 were implemented and 4 were 

not implemented.  The details are discussed in Part III of this report. 

 



 

vi 

 

We enjoin Management to ensure full implementation of all audit 

recommendations to improve the financial and operational efficiency of the 

agency.
