OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

Financial Audit 

 

Accounting Errors 

 
1. Obligations for undelivered  services and/or without complete and adequate 

supporting documents as at year-end  and those based only on Job Order (JO) 

contracts totaling P1.105 million and P228,100.00, respectively, were recognized 

under Accounts Payable which resulted in the overstatement of Accounts  

Payable by P1.333 million and Janitorial Services, Other General Services, 

Printing and Publication Expenses, Repairs and Maintenance - Machinery and 

Equipment, Office Equipment and Rent/Lease Expenses by  P28,287.63, 

P114,543.33, P1.107 million, P20,800.00 and P62,150.00 respectively, and the 

understatement of Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) by P1.333 million 

Section 2, Chapter 6, Volume I of the Government Accounting Manual for 

National Government Agencies (GAM) defined Accounts Payable as valid and legal 

obligations of national government agencies/operating units (NGAs/OUs), for which, 

goods/services/projects have been delivered/rendered/completed and accepted, 

regardless of the year when those obligations were incurred. 

      

Verification of the schedule of Accounts Payable as at December 31, 2020 

revealed that obligations totaling P1.333 million, covered by various Journal Entry 

Vouchers (JEVs), pertain to goods and services which have not yet been 

delivered/accepted/rendered as at year-end, as summarized in Table 1:

As shown in Table 1, goods and services rendered totaling P1.105 million 

appeared to be valid obligations based on the supporting documents. Examination of 

the attached billing statements, sale/service invoices, and/or Inspection and 

Acceptance Reports (IARs), however, revealed that the goods and services were 

delivered/rendered and accepted after December 31, 2020, hence, there were no bases 

for recognizing obligations to suppliers/contractors as at year-end.  

 

The Audit Team requested for additional supporting documents from the 

Finance Division for services totaling P228,100.00 that were recognized under 

Accounts Payable, but was informed that the recognized payables were based only on 

JO contracts. However, the JO contracts alone are not adequate bases for recognizing 

payables to suppliers/contractors as there should actually be delivery of services 

within the reporting period for obligations, as evidenced by Statement of Accounts 

and Invoices, and IAR, among others.   

 

The Management’s practice of recognizing payables without complete and 

adequate evidences of actual delivery of services overstated Accounts Payable by 

P1.333 million and Janitorial Services, Other General Services, Printing and 

Publication Expenses, Repairs and Maintenance - Machinery and Equipment, Office 

Equipment and Rent/Lease Expenses by P28,287.63, P114,543.33, P1.107 million, 

P20,800.00, and P62,150.00, respectively, and understated Accumulated 

Surplus/(Deficit) by P1.333 million. 

  We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief 

Administrative Officer, Finance Division to: (a) ensure that recorded payables in 

the books of accounts are for services rendered and goods delivered, and with 

complete and appropriate supporting documents; and (b) establish the validity 



 

38 
 

of obligations/payables, analyze entries made and make the necessary 

adjustments to correct the balances of the affected accounts.   

 

2. Erroneous recognition of 22 units of pocket Wi-Fi totaling P55,000.00 under 
Telephone Expenses resulted in the overstatement of the said account and the 

understatement of Semi-Expendable Communications Equipment, both by the 

same amount. 

 

Section 10, Chapter 8, Volume I of GAM provides that tangible items below 

the capitalization threshold of P15,000.00 shall be accounted as semi-expendable 

property. 

 

Verification of the Telephone Expenses as at December 31, 2020 revealed 

that this account includes the purchase of 22 units of pocket Wi-Fi to support the 

internet connectivity of those employees who are on a work-from-home arrangement 

during this pandemic period. Each unit of the pocket Wi-Fi costs P2,500.00, which is 

below the capitalization threshold of P15,000.00, hence, should have been accounted 

for as semi-expendable property. 

 

The recognition of the pocket Wi-Fi under Telephone Expenses overstated 

the said account by P55,000.00 and understated Semi-Expendable Communications 

Equipment by the same amount.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief 

Administrative Officer, Finance Division to reclassify the pocket Wi-Fi totaling 

P55,000.00 to Semi-Expendable Communications Equipment and make the 

corresponding adjustment to Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit). 

  

 

Accounting Deficiencies 

 

3. Non-reconciliation and/or non-confirmation of balances of receivables with/by 
IAs under Due from National Government Agencies, Due from Government-

Owned or Controlled Corporations and Other Receivables totaling P1.095 billion, 

P176.952 million and P150.964 million, respectively, had precluded the 

determination of the existence, completeness and accuracy of the balances of the 

said accounts at year-end. 
 

Section 6 (e), Chapter 19, Volume I of GAM provides that an entity shall 

present information including accounting policies in a manner that are reliable, free 

from material error and bias, and can be depended on by users to represent faithfully 

that which it purports to represent or could reasonably be expected to represent.  
 

Paragraph C, Section 2.7 of the Project Development Monitoring Facility 

(PDMF) Guidelines dated October 2011 states that, “xxx However, there are some 



 

39 
 

cases where the reimbursements will need to be recovered directly from the 

Government through the normal budgetary process, to wit:  

 

c.  The cost of conducting such pre-feasibility or feasibility study will 

be reimbursed by the IA, thru the budgetary process, to the 

PDMF when:  

 

     The pre-feasibility or feasibility study of a Project approved 
for PDMF funding demonstrates that the project will not be 

feasible; or  

 

  The project fails to obtain ICC or NEDA Board approval and 
will no longer be pursued. xxx ” 

 

As at December 31, 2020, the accounts Due from National Government 

Agencies, Due from Government-Owned or Controlled Corporations and Other 

Receivables have balances of P1.095 billion, P176.952 million and P150.964 million, 

respectively. The Due from National Government Agencies and Due from 

Government-Owned or Controlled Corporations represent receivables from NGAs 

and GOCCs, respectively, which availed of the PDMF funds for the conduct of 

feasibility studies for their projects, but the same were terminated or not pursued. On 

the other hand, the account Other Receivables refers to the payments for consulting 

services of Transaction Advisors/Consultants that will be reimbursed by either the 

winning bidder or implementing agency (IA) depending on the outcome of the 

project.   

 

Comparative analysis of the receivable accounts as at December 31, 2020 

disclosed a net increase of P21.592 million, as presented in Table 2:

Although there was a net increase in the total receivables under Due from 

National Government Agencies by P26.391 million for the reimbursement of the 

PDMF support for six projects of the Department of Transportation (DOTr), the 

PPPCP had collected a total of P12.163 million from the DOTr for the reimbursement 

of the cost of feasibility study conducted for C5 Transport Service Project and Motor 

Vehicle Inspection Project of P7.161 million and P5.002 million, respectively. The 

decrease of P4.799 million in the Other Receivables pertains to the reclassification of 

fund transfer under Due from National Government Agencies at year-end to recognize 



 

40 
 

the receivable from the DOTr for the payment of consultancy services by the winning 

bidder or the IA depending on the outcome of the project.  

 

Confirmation Letters (CLs) were sent to all NGAs and GOCCs with payables 

to the PPPCP to verify the existence and correctness of the balances of the related 

receivable accounts as at December 31, 2020. Replies to CLs showed total 

discrepancies between the PPPCP books and that of the concerned IAs, for Due from 

National Government Agencies and Due from Government-Owned or Controlled 

Corporations of P662.474 million and P157.520 million, respectively, as shown in

The differences noted in the Due from National Government Agencies were 

brought about by the discrepancies in the number of projects recorded in the books of 

PPPCP and IAs.  The DOTr recognized payables to the PPPCP for five projects out of 

10 projects recognized in the books of the PPPCP, hence, a total difference of 

P467.843 million.  On the other hand, the DPWH recognized payables to the PPPCP 

for only one project while four projects were in the PPPCP books, thus, the difference 

of P127.581 million. The DOH and DOJ confirmed to have no records of payables to 

the PPPCP in their books. 



 

41 
 

 Under the Due from Government-Owned or Controlled Corporations, no 

record was found in the books of the PNOC. The MWSS confirmed the payables to 

the PPPCP for the two projects recognized in the books of the PPPCP, however, the 

cost of project for New Centennial Water Source Project (IDCA 03) was recognized 

for the account of the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) due to the 

change in the manner of funding from the PPPCP to Official Development Assistance 

as approved by the NEDA Board. Hence, there was no record in the MWSS books of 

the payable to the PPPCP for the project. 

 

In view of the unreconciled discrepancies and unconfirmed balances of 

receivables totaling P662.474 million and P157.520 million under the Due from 

National Government Agencies and Due from Government-Owned Controlled 

Corporations, respectively, the existence, completeness and accuracy of the balances 

of the said accounts at year-end were not ascertained. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief 

Administrative Officer, Finance Division to: (a) provide the Accountant/Finance 

Officer of the concerned IAs with the details of receivables and relevant 

documents to facilitate reconciliation of the reciprocal accounts between the 

PPPCP and IAs; (b) follow up the results of reconciliation with the 

Accountants/Finance Officers and settlements thereon; and (c) analyze and 

verify reconciling items and effect adjustments, as necessary, based on pertinent 

documents. 

 

 

Compliance with Other Mandatory Accounts/Areas 

 

4. COVID-19 Pandemic Response and Recovery Interventions 
 

For CY 2020, the PPPCP had not received funds specifically for Coronavirus 

Disease 2019 (COVID-19) response and/or recovery but had utilized its budget for 

related expenses. COVID-19-related expenses charged to Personnel Services and 

Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses amounted to P60,000.00 and 

P226,600.00, respectively. The results of audit of these COVID-related transactions 

are as follows: 

 

On the grant of hazard pay to employees during ECQ and MECQ   

 

Administrative Order (AO) No. 26 dated March 23, 2020 of the Office of the 

President authorized the NGAs to grant COVID-19 Hazard Pay to personnel who 

physically reported for work during the implementation of Enhanced Community 

Quarantine (ECQ) in their respective work stations, in an amount not exceeding 

P500.00 per day per person. 

 

Pursuant to the AO, the PPPCP issued Special Order Nos. 036 and 037, series 

of 2020, to formally adopt the guidelines in the skeleton workforce system at the 



 

42 
 

PPPCP and the reporting of employees to the office during the extended ECQ period 

until April 30, 2020. 

 

Review of the transactions recognized under Hazard Pay for  

CY 2020 disclosed that the PPPCP granted COVID-19 hazard pay at P500.00/day or 

a total of P60,000.00 to 20 PPPCP regular/plantilla employees who reported to office 

during the ECQ (March 17 to May 15, 2020) and modified ECQ (MECQ) (May 16 to 

31, and August 4 to 18, 2020).  

 

Examination of the pertinent disbursement vouchers on the grant of hazard 

pay showed that the payments were supported with special orders, permits to report to 

office, accomplishment reports, and copies of guard’s log sheet, payroll and summary 

of attendance for skeletal workforce. 

 

On the grant of Wi-Fi/Connectivity Support  

 

Section 3.1.e.3 of Civil Service Commission (CSC) Memorandum Circular 

(MC) No. 10, series of 2020, provides that the agency head shall ensure that the 

employees have access to or is provided with any communication equipment or 

facilities, such as computer/laptop, internet or e-mail, facsimile, telephone or mobile 

phone in order to facilitate the implementation of work-from-home arrangement.  In 

response, the PPPCP issued Special Order No. 108, series of 2020, prescribing the 

guidelines on the provision of Wi-Fi/connectivity to support the PPPCP officials and 

employees during the State of National Emergency due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

 

Semi-expendable communication equipment and supplies such as pocket Wi-

Fi, prepaid cards, sim cards and headsets, with total cost of P226,600.00, were 

procured by the Management to support the limited internet access/connectivity of 

PPPCP officials and employees who are on a work-from-home arrangement.  

 

Procurements of the said equipment and supplies were supported with all the 

necessary documents and Inventory Custodian Slips were issued to the employees 

who were provided with semi-expendable items.  

 

 

5. Gender and Development (GAD) 
 

Section 31 of the General Provisions of Republic Act (RA) No. 11465, or the 

General Appropriations Act (GAA) for FY 2020 provides that all agencies of the 

government shall formulate a Gender and Development (GAD) Plan designed to 

address gender issues within their concerned sectors or mandate. 

 

The PPPCP had implemented all the 18 GAD programs, projects and activities 

(PPAs) identified in its GAD Plan and Budget in compliance with the provisions of 

PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01. Among the significant activities 

accomplished were presented in Table 4:

budget of P4.068 million for GAD-related projects mainstreamed in the Agency’s 

regular activities for CY 2020.  

 

 

6. Senior Citizens (SCs) and Persons with Disability (PWDs) 
 

Section 32 of the General Provisions of the GAA for FY 2020 provides, 

among others that, all agencies of the government shall formulate plans, programs 

and projects intended to address the concerns of SCs and the PWDs, insofar as it 

relates to their mandated functions, and integrate the same in their regular activities.  

 

The Agency carried out five activities intended to address the health and 

financial concerns of the employees, including SCs and PWDs and spent P10,962.77 

for activities participated in by SCs and PWDs, as summarized in Table 5:

7. Compliance with  Tax  Laws,  GSIS  and  Pag-IBIG  Premium  Contributions  
and   Loan Amortizations, and PhilHealth Premium Contributions 

 

The PPPCP had complied with the tax rules and regulations on withholding of 

taxes, deductions and remittances of mandatory deduction pursuant to the regulations 

issued by the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR), Government Service Insurance 

System (GSIS), Pag-IBIG and PhilHealth, as shown in Table 6:

February 10, 2021.  

 

 

8. GSIS Property Insurance Law 

Republic Act No. 656, otherwise known as the Property Insurance Law, as 

amended by Presidential Decree No. 245, requires, among others, that every 

government, except a municipal government below first class, to insure its properties 

with the Fund against any insurable risk and pay the premiums thereon, which, 

however, shall not exceed the premiums charged by private insurance companies. 

 

In CY 2020, Property, Plant and Equipment totaling P80.154 million were 

insured with the GSIS General Insurance Fund at a total premium of P365,841.11 in 

compliance with the above-cited law. 

 

 

9. Hiring of Casual, Job Order and Contractual Personnel and Consultants

consultants in CY 2020. 

 

 

10. Status of Audit Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges
