EXECUTIVE   SUMMARY 

 
 

A.  INTRODUCTION 

The Mindanao State University (MSU), Marawi City is an institution of higher 

learning. It was created on September 1, 1961 by virtue of Republic Act 1387, as amended 

and approved in 1957 and of Republic Act 1893. It strives to be the premier supra-regional 

university geared towards the agro-industrial, ecological, socio-economic and political 

development of Mindanao while achieving international recognition as a leading institution 

of higher learning. Unlike other universities in the Philippines, it aims to set the standards 

of excellence in science, arts, technology and other fields; accelerate the economic, 

cultural, socio-political, and agro-industrial development of the Muslim and other cultural 

groups, thereby facilitating their integration into the national community; preserve and 

promote the cultural heritage of the region and conserve its rich natural resources; and, 

infuse moral and spiritual values. 

From its Main Campus in Marawi City, it has now grown into a University System 

that comprises seven (7) autonomous campuses, namely:  

1. MSU-Main Campus in Marawi City; 

2. MSU-IIT in Iligan City; 

3. MSU-Maguindanao, in Maguindanao; 

4. MSU-Gensan in General Santos City;  

5. MSU-Sulu in Jolo;  

6. MSU-TCTO in Tawi-Tawi; and  

7. MSU-Naawan in Misamis Oriental. 

 

In addition, four (4) former CHED supervised institutions of higher learning are 

integrated into the university system under the control and supervision of the MSU Main 

Campus, also known as MSU Supervised Institutions (MSIs) namely:  

 

1. Lanao National College of Arts and Trade (LNCAT); 
2. Lanao del Norte Agricultural College (LNAC); 
3. Maigo School of Arts and Trade (MSAT); and 
4. MSU Buug, a former external unit of the University.  

 

  These MSU Supervised Institutions (MSIs) are receiving their funds from the 

MSU-Main Campus thru sub-allotment. Thus, their financial reports are consolidated in 

the reports of MSU Main. 
  

The governing body of the university is vested on the Board of Regents as 

constituted by law composed   Chairman, Vice Chairman and Members as follows:

D.  AUDIT OPINION ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT 

 

The Auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the 

consolidated financial statements of the Mindanao State University Main Campus and 

MSIs as of December 31, 2020 due to the exceptions noted in audit which are stated in the 

Independent Auditor’s Report and discussed in detail in Part II of the report. 

 

E.  SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS  

The following are the significant audit observations with the corresponding audit 

recommendations for remedial measures to wit:  

 

1. Sixty-five (65) infrastructure projects were not completed within the contract 

period, nine (9) of which were not put into use thereby depriving the intended 

beneficiaries of its immediate use. 

 

We recommended the University President to: 

 

a. Instruct the Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) Secretariat to submit to the 
Audit Team the approved letter of requests for time extensions by the 

contractors and other project-related documents for the sixty-five (65) 

infrastructure projects which were not completed within the contract period 

(as enumerated in the attached Annex A); 

 

b. Make sure that all infrastructure projects are strictly monitored in 
accordance with the plans and schedules of implementation so that available 

actions or remedies can be imposed against the responsible officials or 

contractors; and 

 

c. Immediately address the reasons on why the above-cited infrastructure 
projects are still idle so that the intended users can use it. 

 

2. The reported year-end balance of the account CIB-LCCA of ₱234,095,721.39  is 

unreliable due to: (a) the absence of adequate subsidiary ledgers for each of the 

Campuses’ thirty-eight (38) depository bank accounts with an aggregate amount of 

₱233,552,834.39 or 99.77% of the total cash-in-bank balance; (b) non-preparation 

and non-submission of the Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS) on a regular 

basis; and (c) the inability of the MSU-Main Campus to authorize and facilitate the 

bank confirmation requests of the Commission on Audit (COA), contrary to Section 

2 (2), Article IX-D of the 1987 Philippine Constitution and pertinent provisions of 

Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 and the Government Accounting Manual 

(GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs). 

 



vi 

 

We recommended that: 

a. The Campus Heads instruct their Accountants to:  
 

i. Maintain separate subsidiary ledger for each depository account in 
compliance with the Section 114, par. 2 of PD No. 1445 and 

Appendix 6, Volume II of the GAM for NGAS; and 

 

ii. Prepare the BRSs for all existing depository accounts on a regular 
basis, and submit the same to the Audit Team, together with the 

necessary supporting documents so that reconciling items could 

be determined and analyzed to establish the accuracy and 

reliability of the reported cash balances in the financial statements, 

in compliance with Sections 5 and 7 of Chapter 21, Volume I of 

the GAM for NGAs; and 

 

b. The Management of MSU-Campus submit their reasons/justifications 
for their inability to authorize and facilitate the bank confirmation 

requests of the COA, otherwise, administrative disciplinary action 

may be imposed to those officials responsible thereof. 

 

3. The validity, existence and accuracy of records of the various inventory and related 

expense accounts amounting to ₱12,176,296.99 and ₱52,349,709.71, respectively 

as of year-end could not be relied upon due to the following reasons: a) expenses 

amounting to ₱41,078,690.44 were recorded based on a percentage and not on the 

actual supplies and materials used/issued due to non-submission of Report of 

Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI); b) direct charging of procured inventory 

items to the expense account totaling ₱11,271,019.27; c) non-existence of 

inventories in-stock amounting to ₱2,213,713.70; d) non-maintenance of required 

records/forms and other deficiencies in the receipt, recording, requisition and 

issuance of delivered inventory items ; and e) failure to conduct physical count of 

inventory accounts and non-preparation of the prescribed Report of Physical Count 

of Inventories (RPCI), contrary to pertinent provisions of the Volumes I and II of 

the  Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies 

(NGAs).

accounts and balances. 

 

4. The existence, ownership and accuracy of the PPE accounts amounting to 

₱1,958,807,318.72 as of year-end were doubtful due to: (a) the absence of adequate 

subsidiary and property records containing details and breakdown for some

Regulations of RA 9184, thus, transparency and equal opportunities were not given 

to all qualified suppliers and the most advantageous price for the University may 

not be obtained. 

 

 We recommended the Campus Heads to instruct their respective BAC, 

through its BAC Secretariat to observe the proper posting of the Request for 

Quotations (RFQs), Purchase Orders (POs), Notices of Awards (NOAs) and Notice 

to Proceed (NTPs) in the PhilGEPS, in their website and at any conspicuous place

Sections 54.2 and 54.3 of the Revised IRR of RA 9184. 

 

8. Non-inclusion of non-infrastructure projects in the Report of 

Projects/Programs/Activities (PPAs) submitted by the Campus and failure to notify 

the Audit Team before the start of any program/activity as required in COA Circular 

No. 2013-004 dated January 30, 2013 precluded the timely auditorial review and 

evaluation thereof. 

 

 We recommended and the Management of the concerned Campuses agreed 

to instruct the personnel assigned to prepare their quarterly Report of PPA to 

include non-infrastructure projects and to inform the Audit Team within ten (10) 

days before the start of their programs/activities for validation purposes, in 

compliance with COA Circular No. 2013-004 dated January 30, 2013. 

 

9. The Management’s failure to install, implement, and monitor a sound internal

Republic of the Philippines 
Mindanao State University-Main Campus and MSIs 

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
For the Calendar Year 2020 

Note 1 - General Information/Agency Profile 

The consolidated financial statements of the Mindanao State University-Main Campus and 
its Supervised Institutions (MSIs) composed of MSU-LNCAT, MSU-LNAC, MSU-Buug 
and MSU-MSAT were authorized for issue on December 31, 2020 as shown in the 
Statement of Management Responsibility for Financial Statements signed by the MSUS 
President Habib W. Macaayong, DPA.  

Mindanao State University (MSU) was established through R.A. Nos. 1387 and 1893, on 
September 1, 1961 in Marawi City. It was mandated to accelerate the “integration” of the 
cultural communities, especially the Muslims, into the mainstream of the national body 
politics and to accelerate the development of the area through the traditional functions of 
a university along instruction, research and extension.  

From a one-campus university in Marawi City, MSU has now grown into a multi-campus 
university with seven (7) autonomous campuses, namely: MSU-Main Campus in Marawi 
City; MSU-IIT in Iligan City; MSU-TCTO in Tawi-Tawi; MSU- Sulu in Jolo; MSU-
Maguindanao in Datu Odin Sinsuat in Maguindanao, MSU-Gensan in General Santos City 
and MSU Naawan in Misamis Oriental.   

In addition, four (4) former CHED supervised institutions of higher learning are integrated 
into the university system under the control and supervision of the MSU-Main Campus, 
also known as MSU Supervised Institutions (MSIs) namely Lanao National College of 
Arts and Trade (LNCAT), Lanao Norte Agricultural College (LNAC), Maigo School of 
Arts and Trade (MSAT) and MSU Buug, a former external unit of the university which 
was granted semi-autonomous personality to operate. These MSU Supervised Institutions 
(MSIs) are receiving their funds from the MSU-Main Campus thru sub-allotment, thus, 
their financial reports are consolidated in the reports of the Main Campus.  

Note 2 - Statement of Compliance and Basis of Preparation of Financial Statements 

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with and in 
compliance with the Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standards (PPSAS) issued by 
the Commission on Audit per COA Resolution No. 2014-003 dated January 24, 2014.  

The financial statements have been prepared on the basis of historical cost, unless 
otherwise stated. The Statement of Cash Flows is prepared using the direct method.  



12 

Note 3 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

3.1. Basis of Accounting 

The financial statements are prepared on an accrual basis in accordance with the 
Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standards (PPSAS)  

Assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses of the university are reflected in the 
financial statements.  

3.2. Financial Instruments 

a. Financial Assets

 Initial recognition and measurement 

Financial assets within the scope of PPSAS 29-Financial Instruments: 
Recognition and Measurement are classified as financial assets at fair value 
through surplus or deficit, held-to-maturity investments, loans and receivables 
or available-for-sale financial assets, as appropriate. MSU determines the 
classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.  

Purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a 
time frame established by regulation or convention in the marketplace (regular 
way trades) are recognized on the trade date, i.e., the date that MSU commits 
to purchase or sell the asset.  

The MSU’s financial assets include: cash and short-term deposits; trade and 
other receivables; loans and other receivables.  

Subsequent measurement 

The subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on their 
classification.  

Loans and receivables 

Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or 
determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.  

Derecognition 

The MSU derecognizes a financial asset or, where applicable, a part of a 
financial asset or part of MSU of similar financial assets when: 



13 

▪ The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired or are
waived; and

▪ The MSU has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset
or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full
without material delay to a third party; and either: (a) MSU has
transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset; or (b)
MSU has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks.

b. Financial Liabilities

Initial recognition and measurement 

Financial liabilities within the scope of PPSAS 29 are classified as financial 
liabilities at fair value through surplus or deficit or loans and borrowings, as 
appropriate. The entity determines the classification of its financial liabilities 
at initial recognition.  

All financial liabilities are recognized initially at fair value and, in the case of 
loans and borrowings, plus directly attributable transaction costs.  

MSU’s financial liabilities include trade and other payables. 

Subsequent measurement 

The subsequent measurement of financial liabilities depends on their 
classification.  

Derecognition 

A financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is 
discharged or cancelled or expires.  

3.3. Cash and Cash Equivalents 

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and cash at bank. For the 
purpose of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents 
consist of cash and short-term deposits as defined above, net of outstanding bank 
overdrafts.  

3.4. Inventories 



14 

Inventory is measured at cost upon initial recognition. To the extent that 
inventory was received through non-exchange transactions (for no cost or for a 
nominal cost), the cost of the inventory is its fair value at the date of acquisition. 

Inventories are recognized as expenses when deployed for utilization or 
consumption in the ordinary course of the operations. 

3.5. Property, Plant and Equipment 

Recognition 

An item is recognized as property, plant and equipment (PPE) if it meets the 
characteristics and recognition criteria as a PPE.  

The characteristics of PPE are as follows: 

▪ Tangible item;
▪ Are held for use in the production or supply of goods or services, for

rental to others, or for administrative purposes; and
▪ Are expected to be used during more than one reporting period.

An item of PPE is recognized as an asset if: 

▪ It is probable that future economic benefits or service potential
associated with the item will flow to the entity; and

▪ The cost or fair value of the item can be measure reliably.

Measurement at Recognition 

An item recognized as property, plant, and equipment is measured at cost. 

A PPE acquired through non-exchange transaction is measured at its fair value 
as at the date of acquisition.  

The cost of the PPE is the cash price equivalent or, for PPE acquired through 
non-exchange transaction its cost is its fair value as at recognition date.  

Cost includes the following: 

▪ Its purchase price, including import duties and non-refundable purchase
taxes, after deducting trade discounts and rebates;

▪ Expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items;
and



15 

▪ Initial estimate of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and
restoring the site on which it is located, the obligation for which an entity
incurs either when the item is acquired, or as a consequence of having
used the item during a particular period for purposes other than to
produce inventories during that period.

Measurement after Recognition 

After recognition, all property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.  

When significant parts of property, plant and equipment are required to be 
replaced at intervals, the MSU recognizes such parts as individual assets with 
specific useful lives and depreciates them accordingly. Likewise, when a major 
repair/replacement is done, its cost is recognized in the carrying amount of the 
plant and equipment as a replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied.  

All other repair and maintenance costs are recognized as expense in surplus or 
deficit as incurred  

Depreciation 

Each part of an item of property, plant, and equipment with a cost that is 
significant in relation to the total cost of the item is depreciated separately.  

The depreciation charge for each period is recognized as expense unless it is 
included in the cost of another asset.  

Initial Recognition of Depreciation 

Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use such as when it is in 
the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the 
manner intended by management.  

For simplicity and to avoid proportionate computation, the depreciation is for 
one month if the PPE is available for use on or before the 15th of the month. 
However, if the PPE is available for use after the 15th of the month, depreciation 
is for the succeeding month.  

Depreciation Method 

The straight line method of depreciation is adopted unless another method is 
more appropriate for agency operation.  



16 

Estimated Useful Life 

MSU uses the Schedule on the Estimated Useful Life of PPE by classification 
prepared by COA.  

MSU uses a residual value equivalent to at least ten percent (10%) of the cost of 
PPE.  

Impairment 

An asset’s carrying amount is written down to its recoverable amount, or 
recoverable service amount, if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its 
estimated recoverable service amount.  

Derecognition 

MSU derecognizes items of property, plant and equipment and/or any significant 
part of an asset upon disposal or when no future economic benefits or service 
potential is expected from its continuing use. Any gain or loss arising on 
derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal 
proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the surplus or 
deficit when the asset is derecognized.  

3.6. Changes in Accounting Policies and Estimates 

MSU recognizes the effects of changes in accounting policy retrospectively. The 
effects of changes in accounting policy were applied prospectively if 
retrospective application is impractical.  

MSU recognizes the effects of changes in accounting estimates prospectively by 
including in surplus or deficit.  

MSU corrects material prior period errors retrospectively in the first set of 
financial statements authorized for issue after their discovery by:  

▪ Restating the comparative amounts for prior period(s) presented in which
the error occurred; or

▪ If the error occurred before the earliest prior period presented, restating
the opening balances of assets, liabilities and net assets/equity for the
earliest prior period presented.

3.7. Revenue from Non-Exchange Transactions 

Recognition and Measurement of Assets from Non-Exchange Transactions 



17 

An inflow of resources from a non-exchange transaction, other than services in 
kind, that meets the definition of an asset were recognized as an asset if the 
following criteria were met:  

▪ It is probable that the future economic benefits or service potential
associated with the asset will flow to the entity; and

▪ The fair value of the asset can be measured reliably.

An asset acquired through a non-exchange transaction is initially measured at its 
fair value as the date of acquisition.  

Recognition Revenue from Non-Exchange Transactions 

An inflow of resources from a non-exchange transaction recognized as an asset 
is recognized as revenue, except to the extent that a liability is also recognized 
in respect of the same inflow.  

As MSU satisfies a present obligation recognized as a liability in respect of an 
inflow of resources from a non-exchange transaction recognized as an asset, it 
reduces the carrying amount of the liability recognized and recognizes an 
amount of revenue equal to that reduction.  

Measurement of Revenue from Non-Exchange Transactions 

Revenue from non-exchange transactions is measured at the amount of the 
increase in net assets recognized by the entity, unless a corresponding liability 
is recognized.  

Measurement of Liabilities on Initial Recognition from Non-Exchange 

Transactions  

The amount recognized as a liability in a non-exchange transaction is the best 
estimate of the amount required to settle the present obligation at the reporting 
date.  

Gifts and Donations 

MSU recognizes assets and revenue from gifts and donations when it is probable 
that the future economic benefits or service potential will flow to the entity and 
the fair value of the assets can be measured reliably.  

Goods in-kind were recognized as assets when the goods were received, or there 
is a binding arrangement to receive the goods. If goods in-kind were received 



18 

without conditions attached, revenue is recognized immediately. If conditions 
were attached, a liability is recognized, which is reduced and revenue recognized 
as the conditions were satisfied.  

On initial recognition, gifts and donations including goods in-kind were 
measured at their fair value as at the date of acquisition, which were ascertained 
by reference to an active market, or by appraisal. An appraisal of the value of an 
asset is normally undertaken by a member of the valuation profession who holds 
a recognized and relevant professional qualification. For many assets, the fair 
value as ascertained by reference to quoted prices in an active and liquid market. 

Transfers from other government entities 

Revenues from non-exchange transactions with other government entities and 
the related assets were measured at fair value and recognized upon obtaining 
control of the asset (cash, goods, services and property), if the transfer is free 
from conditions and it is probable that the economic benefits or service potential 
related to the asset will flow to the MSU and can be measured reliably.  

3.8. Revenue from Exchange Transactions 

Measurement of Revenue 

Revenue was measured at the fair value of the consideration received or 
receivable.  

Sale of Goods 

Revenue from the sale of goods is recognized when the significant risks and 
rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer, usually on delivery of 
the goods and when the amount of revenue can be measured reliably and it is 
probable that the economic benefits or service potential associated with the 
transaction will flow to the MSU.  

Rental income 

Rental income arising from operating leases on investment properties is 
accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease terms and included in 
revenue.  

3.9. Budget Information 

The Annual Budget is prepared on a cash basis and is published in the 
government website.  



19 

A separate Statement of Comparison of Budget and Actual Amounts (SCBAA) 
was prepared since the budget and the financial statements were not prepared on 
comparable basis. The SCBAA was presented showing the original and final 
budget and the actual amounts on comparable basis to the budget.  

3.10. Employee Benefits 

The employees of MSU are members of the Government Service Insurance 
System (GSIS), which provides life and retirement insurance coverage.  

MSU recognizes the undiscounted amount of short term employee benefits, like 
salaries, wages, bonuses, allowances, etc., as expense unless capitalized, and as 
a liability after deducting the amount paid.  

MSU recognizes expenses for accumulating compensated absences when these 
were paid as terminal leave benefits. Unused entitlements that have accumulated 
at the reporting date were not recognized as expense. Non-accumulating 
compensated absences, like special leave privileges, were not recognized.

OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

PART II - OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

VALUE-FOR-MONEY AUDIT 
 
1. Sixty-five (65) infrastructure projects were not completed within the contract 

period, nine (9) of which were not put into use thereby depriving the intended 
beneficiaries of its immediate use. 
 

1.1 Section 10.1, Annex E of the 2016 Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations  
(RIRR) of RA No. 9184 provides:  
 

Should the amount of additional work of any kind or other special 

circumstances of any kind whatsoever occur such as to fairly entitle the 

contractor to an extension of contract time, the procuring entity shall 

determine the amount of such extension; provided that the procuring 

entity is not bound to take into account any claim for an extension  of time 

unless the contractor has, prior to the expiration of the contract time 

and within thirty (30) calendar days after such work has been 

commenced or after the circumstances leading to such claim have 

arisen, delivered to the procuring entity notices in order that it could 

have investigated them at that time. Failure to provide such notice shall 

constitute a waiver by the contractor of any claim. Upon receipt of full 

and detailed particulars, the procuring entity shall examine the facts and 

extent of the delay and shall extend the contract time completing the 

contract work when, in the procuring entity's opinion, the findings of facts 

justify an extension. (emphasis supplied) 

 
1.2  Further, COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012, provides for the 

updated guidelines for the prevention and disallowance of irregular, unnecessary, 
excessive, extravagant and unconscionable expenditures. Item 4.1 thereof defines 
the expenditures that are considered “Unnecessary” Expenditures or Uses of 
Government Funds or Property. 
 

1.3  As set-forth in Annex C of the above-cited Circular, construction of buildings 
and/or procurement of equipment not actually needed or without any intended 
purpose, not put to use or used for purposes other than the intended purpose, not 
completed and could not be properly maintained or operations sustained are 
among the cases that fall in the category of Unnecessary Expenditures or Uses of 
Government Funds and Property. 
 

1.4  Review of the Report on Project, Program and Activities (PPA) of the MSU-
Main Campus as of December 31, 2020 revealed that sixty-five (65) 
infrastructure projects were not completed within the contract period, with delays 
ranging from 21 to 2,540 days (See Annex A for details). However, the Audit 
Team could not examine the reasonableness and exact causes of the delays 
because the Management failed to submit the approved contractors’ letter of 



48 

 

requests for time extension and other project-related documents, despite several 
requests in writing. This could have afforded the Audit Team to validate if the 
time extensions, if any, conform with the conditions by which extension of 
contract of time may be allowed or prohibited as enumerated in Annex E of the 
2016 RIRR of RA No. 9184.  
 

1.5  Furthermore, ocular inspections conducted by the Audit Team showed that nine 
(9) of these completed projects are yet to be used by the intended users as of 
December 31, 2020, details summarized in the table below:

1.6 As can be observed from the above-table, three (3) of the completed infrastructure 
projects located in MSU Main-Campus and six (6) in the other Campuses 
remained idle/non-operational for almost one to more than four (4) years after 
their dates of completion due to the reasons indicated therein. 

1.7 Infrastructure projects should be implemented and completed within the 
scheduled timeframe so that the social and economic benefits may be enjoyed by 
the intended beneficiaries. The prime consideration of the government for 
entering into contract is the completion of the project within the stipulated 
period, thus, its delayed implementation not only deprived the end-users of 
enjoying the facilities but also put the government funds into waste. It may also 
affect the University’s attainment of its mission and thrust relative to the nature 
of its operations. 

1.8 We recommended the University President to: 

a. Instruct the BAC Secretariat to submit to the Audit Team the
approved letter of requests for time extensions by the contractors and
other project-related documents for the sixty-five (65) infrastructure
projects which were not completed within the contract period (as
enumerated in the attached Annex A);

b. Make sure that all infrastructure projects are strictly monitored in
accordance with the plans and schedules of implementation so that
available actions or remedies can be imposed against the responsible
officials or contractors; and

c. Immediately address the reasons on why the above-cited
infrastructure projects are still idle so that the intended users can use
it.

Management Comments: 

1.9 The Management of MSU-Main Campus assured that they will immediately 
address the reasons of the projects’ idleness so that the intended users can enjoy 
their benefits. 

FINANCIAL AND COMPLIANCE AUDIT 

Unreliable Cash-in-Bank-Local Currency, Current Account (CIB-LCCA)- 

₱234,095,721.39 

2. The reported year-end balance of the account CIB-LCCA of ₱234,095,721.39  is
unreliable due to: (a) the absence of adequate subsidiary ledgers for each of the
Campuses’ thirty-eight (38) depository bank accounts with an aggregate



50 

 

amount of ₱233,552,834.39 or 99.77% of the total cash-in-bank balance; (b) 
non-preparation and non-submission of the Bank Reconciliation Statements 
(BRS) on a regular basis; and (c) the inability of the MSU-Main Campus to 
authorize and facilitate the bank confirmation requests of the Commission on 
Audit (COA), contrary to Section 2 (2), Article IX-D of the 1987 Philippine 
Constitution and pertinent provisions of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 and 
the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies 
(NGAs). 

2.1. Section 2 (2), Article IX-D of the 1987 Philippine Constitution states that: 

The Commission shall have exclusive authority, subject to the 

limitations in this Article, to define the scope of its audit and 
examination, establish the techniques and methods required therefor, 
and promulgate accounting and auditing rules and regulations, 
including those for the prevention and disallowance of irregular, 
unnecessary, excessive, extravagant, or unconscionable expenditures, 

or uses of government funds and properties. 

2.2. Review of the cash-in-bank account balances showed the following 
deficiencies: 

a) The absence of adequate subsidiary ledgers containing details and 
breakdown of the balance of each of the University’s thirty-eight (38) 
depository bank accounts with an aggregate amount of ₱233,552,834.39 or 
99.77% of the total cash-in-bank balance 

2.3. Section 111 of PD 1445, otherwise known as the State Audit Code of the 
Philippines, states that: 

“KEEPING OF ACCOUNTS – (1) The accounts of an agency shall be 

kept in such detail as is necessary to meet the needs of the agency and 

at the same time be adequate to furnish the information needed by 

fiscal or control agencies of the government. (2) The highest standard 

of honesty, objectivity and consistency shall be observed in the 

keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate or misleading 

information. (Section 111)” 

2.4. Section 114, par. 2 of PD No. 1445 requires the accounting unit of each agency 
to maintain subsidiary records, where necessary, whereas, Appendix 6, Volume 
II of the GAM for NGAs on the instruction of accomplishing the Subsidiary 
Ledger (SL) states that a) the SL should show detail for each control account in 
the General Ledger (GL) which is maintained per account and fund cluster by 
the Accounting Division/Unit and b) the totals of the SL balances shall be 
reconciled with the corresponding GL controlling account regularly or at the 
end of each month. 



51 

 

2.5. As of December 31, 2020, the consolidated cash-in-bank account of the MSU-
Main Campus and MSU Supervised Institutions (MSI) amounted to 
₱234,095,721.39. Of this amount, 99.77% or ₱233,552,834.39, which 
comprises thirty-eight (38) depository accounts, has no subsidiary ledgers 
showing therein the details and breakdown of each of the bank accounts, as 
summarized below: 

Campus No. of Depository Accounts Depository Bank Balance 

Main

₱216,640,233.91

MSAT 7 LBP-Iligan City 15,465,636.51 
Total 38   ₱233,552,834.39  

 

2.6. Per verification, the Campuses maintain only the GL of their respective Cash-
in-Bank-LCCA accounts, and were not supported with subsidiary ledger for 
each depository bank account as shown in the above-table, in violation of 
Section 114, par. 2 of PD No. 1445 and Appendix 6, Volume II of the NGAS 
Manual. 

2.7. The non-maintenance of subsidiary records for each bank account did not 
allow easy analysis of the accounts and reconciliation with bank balances may 
not be facilitative because transactions for each of the depository bank 
accounts are intermingled. 

2.8. Despite the Audit Team’s repeated verbal reminders and audit 
recommendations in the previous years, the Accountants of the said Campuses 
still failed to prepare and maintain SLs for their cash accounts. 

b)  Non-preparation and non-submission of the BRS on a regular basis 

2.9. Bank Reconciliation, as defined under Section 2.b, Chapter 21, Volume I of the 
GAM for NGAs, is a settlement of differences contained in the Bank Statement 
(BS) and the Cash account in the agency’s/entity’s books of accounts. Non- 
preparation of BRS defeats the purposes why it is required, which are to: 

i. Check the correctness of both the bank’s and agency’s/entity’s 
records; 

ii. Serve as a deterrent to fraud; and 
iii. Enable the agency/entity or bank to take up charges or credits 

recognized by the bank or agency/ entity but not yet known to the 
agency/ entity or bank. 

 
Sections 5 and 7 of the same Chapter and Manual also provide that: 



52 

Section 5. The Chief Accountant/ Designated Staff shall 
within ten days from receipt of the monthly Bank Statement (BS) 

together with the paid checks original copies of the Debit 

Memoranda (DM)/Credit Memoranda (CM) from the GSB, 

reconcile the BS with the GL and prepare the Bank 

Reconciliation Statement (BRS) in four copies. 

Section 7. The Chief Accountant shall submit the BRS 
within twenty (20) days after receipt of the monthly Bank 

Statement (BS) to the following: 

Original - COA Auditor (with all the supporting 

documents and JEVs)  

Copy 2   - Head of Agency/Entity 

Copy 3   - Accounting Division/Unit file 

Copy 4   - Bank, if necessary 

2.10. Records showed that as of December 31, 2020, the Accountants of MSU-
LNAC, MSU-Buug and MSU-MSAT failed to conduct regular reconciliation 
of book and bank balances for their respective agencies, which constitute 
₱16,912,600.48 or 7.22% the total year-end balance of the account CIB-LCCA. 

2.11. Further interview with the Accountants of the said Campuses revealed the 
following: 

Campus Reasons for Non-Compliance 
LNAC • The non-preparation and non-submission of BRS have

been the subject of audit findings since 2011. During
the exit conference in Calendar Year (CY) 2018, the
Bookkeeper/Acting Accountant admitted having a hard
time submitting the BSs because the bank gives or
releases the said document on a quarterly basis.
Nevertheless, she committed to submit a snapshot of the
statement every month, and subsequently, the Bank
Statement when the bank releases it.

• The Acting Accountant has partially submitted the BRS
for CYs 2018 and 2019. During the exit conference, she
partially submitted the BRS for the months of August
2020 to December 2020 without the corresponding BSs.

Buug • Inquiry made with the Acting Accountant revealed that
for CY 2020, no BRS was prepared due to difficulties
in obtaining the monthly Bank Statements from the
LBP, since the said bank was always closed due to the
pandemic.



53 

 

Campus Reasons for Non-Compliance 
MSAT • The Acting Accountant admitted that the reason for the 

non-preparation and submission of the BRS was due to 
the lack of manpower in the Accounting Office. 

 
 

2.12. The BRS helps identify differences between the bank balance and book 
balance in order to process necessary adjustments or corrections and to 
ascertain that the amount of cash reported on the Statement of Financial 
Position is the correct amount. Hence, non-preparation prevented the review 
and verification of the Cash-in-Bank account’s reconciling items as well as 
adjustments or corrections, if any, casting doubt as to the validity and existence 
of the cash balance per books. 

c) MSU-Main Campus failed to authorize and facilitate the bank 
confirmation requests of the COA 

 
2.13. Sections 55 and 127 of PD 1445 provides that: 

Section 55. The auditor shall obtain through inspections, observation, 

inquiries, confirmation and other techniques, sufficient competent 
evidential matter to afford himself a reasonable basis for his opinions, 
judgments, conclusions, and recommendations. 

Section 127. Administrative disciplinary action. Subject to rules and 

regulations as may be approved by the President (Prime Minister), 

any unjustified failure by the public officer concerned to comply with 

any requirement imposed in this Code shall constitute neglect of duty 

and shall be a ground for administrative disciplinary action against 

the said public officer who, upon being found guilty thereof after 

hearing, shall be meted out such penalty as is commensurate with the 

degree of his guilt in accordance with the Civil Service Law. Repeated 

unjustified failure to comply with the requirements imposed in this 

Code shall be conclusive proof that the public officer concerned is 

notoriously undesirable. 

2.14. Step 3.2.1 (b), Test of Details of Account Balances and Disclosures, Audit 
Execution Phase of the Financial Audit Manual of the COA states that external 
confirmation is one of the procedures adopted in substantive tests. This 
procedure is used to address assertions associated with account balances and 
their elements and to confirm terms of agreements, contracts, or transactions 
between an agency and other parties. 

2.15. On February 8, 2021, the Audit Team sent a written request to the Management 
of MSU-Main Campus to authorize and facilitate the distribution of bank 



54 

 

confirmation letter requests to the Land Bank of the Philippines-Marawi City 
Branch and the Philippine National Bank-Marawi City Branch in order to 
examine the accuracy and existence of the balances of twenty (20) depository 
accounts amounting to ₱216,640,233.9, which constitute 92.54% of the year-
end balance of the account CIB-LCCA. However, the Management was unable 
to authorize and facilitate the said requests for reasons unknown to the Audit 
Team. 

2.16. Bank confirmation is a valuable source of audit evidence because they provide 
independent evidence regarding the reliability of an Agency’s records. Aside 
from confirming the actual account balances per bank records as of a given 
date, bank confirmation can also be used to verify reconciling items on the 
Agency’s year-end bank reconciliation and ensure that all bank accounts held 
by the Agency are included in the financial statements, all interest payable or 
receivable has been correctly accounted for in the financial statements and all 
security that may be held be the bank is correctly disclosed in the financial 
statements. 

2.17. The inability of the MSU-Main Campus to authorize and facilitate said bank 
confirmation requests precluded the Auditor from conducting review and 
verification of the accuracy and existence of the Cash-in-Bank account 
balances as of December 31, 2020. 

2.18. In view of the above-noted deficiencies, reliability of the balance of the Cash-
in-Bank account could not be ascertained. 

2.19. We recommended that: 

a. The Campus Heads instruct their Accountants to:  
 

i. Maintain separate subsidiary ledger for each depository 
account in compliance with the Section 114, par. 2 of PD No. 
1445 and Appendix 6, Volume II of the GAM for NGAS; and 
 

ii. Prepare the BRSs for all existing depository accounts on a 
regular basis, and submit the same to the Audit Team, together 
with the necessary supporting documents so that reconciling 
items could be determined and analyzed to establish the 
accuracy and reliability of the reported cash balances in the 
financial statements, in compliance with Sections 5 and 7 of 
Chapter 21, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs; and 
 

b. The Management of MSU-Campus submit their reasons/justifications 
for their inability to authorize and facilitate the bank confirmation 
requests of the COA, otherwise, administrative disciplinary action 
may be imposed to those officials responsible thereof. 



55 

 

 

Management Comments: 

 
2.20. During the exit conferences, the Management of each Campus agreed to 

comply with the recommendations to maintain SLs for each of their depository 
bank accounts, to regularly prepare the BRS and to submit the same to the 
Audit Team. 

2.21. The Management of MSU-Main Campus neither commented nor submitted 
their reason/justification for their inability to authorize and facilitate the bank 
confirmation letter requests of the Audit Team. 

 

Inadequate documentation for Receivables Accounts -₱4,313,824.58 

 

3. The accuracy and validity of the receivables account amounting to 
₱4,313,824.58 could not be ascertained due to lack of documents and detailed 
information to substantiate the account, rendering the accounts doubtful. 
 
3.1. Sections 110 of PD 1445, otherwise known as the 

State Audit Code of the Philippines, state that: 
 

“OBJECTIVES OF GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTING – Government 
Accounting shall aim to (1) produce information concerning past 

operations and present conditions; (2) provide a basis for guidance 
for future operations; (3) provide for control of the acts of public 
bodies and officers in the receipt, disposition and utilization of funds 
and property; and (4) report on the financial position and the 
results of operations of government agencies for the information of 
all persons concerned. (Section 110)” (emphasis supplied) 

 
3.2. Verification of receivables accounts disclosed that a total of ₱4,313,824.58 

remained in the books of MSU-MSAT for more than three (3) years, among 
which are the following:

56 

 

3.3. It was noted that the above receivables lacked the necessary documents and 
supporting papers to substantiate the claims, rendering the accounts doubtful. 
The Accountant informed the Audit Team of his lack of information on the 
composition of the said receivable accounts since the figures were already 
there when he assumed office in March 2021. 
 

3.4. Poor record keeping violates PD No. 1445, Section 111 (1) which states that 
the accounts of an agency shall be kept in such detail as is necessary to meet 
the needs of the agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish the 
information needed by fiscal or control agencies of the government. 
 

3.5. We recommended the Campus Head of MSU-MSAT to instruct the 
Accountant to exert more efforts in establishing the accuracy of the 
recorded receivables and pursue collection efforts to recover the funds due 
the government. 

 
Management Comment: 

 

3.6. The Accountant of MSU-MSAT assured that their Office is already exerting 
efforts to establish the accuracy of the recorded receivables. 

 

Unreliable Inventories and related expenses accounts - ₱12,176,296.99 and 

₱52,349,709.71 

 
4. The validity, existence and accuracy of records of the various inventory and 

related expense accounts amounting to ₱12,176,296.99 and ₱52,349,709.71, 
respectively as of year-end could not be relied upon due to the following 
reasons: a) expenses amounting to ₱41,078,690.44 were recorded based on a 
percentage and not on the actual supplies and materials used/issued due to non-
submission of Report of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI); b) direct 
charging of procured inventory items to the expense account totaling 
₱11,271,019.27; c) non-existence of inventories in-stock amounting to 
₱2,213,713.70; d) non-maintenance of required records/forms and other 
deficiencies in the receipt, recording, requisition and issuance of delivered 
inventory items ; and e) failure to conduct physical count of inventory accounts 
and non-preparation of the prescribed Report of Physical Count of Inventories 
(RPCI), contrary to pertinent provisions of the Volumes I and II of the GAM 
for NGAs. 
 
4.1. Section 58 of PD No. 1445 provides: 

 
Section 58. Audit of Assets. The examination and audit of assets shall 

be performed with a view to ascertaining their existence, ownership, 

valuation and encumbrances as well as the proprietary of items 

composing the respective asset accounts, determining their agreement 



57 

 

with records, proving the accuracy of such records; ascertaining if the 

assets were utilized economically, efficiently and effectively; and 

evaluating the adequacy of controls over the accounts. 
 

4.2. Chapter 8, Volume I of the GAM provides for, among others, the following 
guidelines and procedures pertaining to Inventories:  
 

Sec. 7. Recognition as an Expense. when inventories are sold, 

exchanged, or distributed, their carrying amount shall be recognized 

as an expense in the period in which the related revenue is 

recognized. If there is no related revenue, the expense is recognized 

when the goods are distributed or the related service is rendered. 

 

Sec. 9. Perpetual Inventory Method. Supplies and materials 

purchased for inventory purpose shall be recorded using the perpetual 

inventory system, resulting in a more accurate inventory records and 

a running total for the cost of goods sold in each period. The system 

requires accounting records to show the amount of inventory on hand 

at all times through the maintenance of the SLC (Appendix 57) by the 

Accounting Division/Unit and Stock Card (SC) (Appendix 58) by the 

Supply and/or Property Division/Unit for each item in stock. Regular 

purchases shall be coursed through the inventory account and issues 

thereof shall be recorded as they take place except for supplies and 

materials purchased out of PCF for immediate use or on emergency 

cases which shall be charged directly to the appropriate expense 

accounts. 

 

Sec. 11. Accountability over Semi-expendable Property. Inventory 

Custodian Slip (ICS) (Appendix 59) shall be issued to end-user of 

Semi-expendable Property to establish accountability over them. 

Accountability shall be extinguished upon return of the item to the 

Property and Supply Division/Unit or in case of loss, upon approval 

of the relief from property accountability. 

 

Sec. 13. Inventory Accounting System. Xxx Physical count/inventory, 
which is required semi-annually, is an indispensable procedure for 

checking the integrity of property custodianship. 

 

Sec. 17. Records, Forms and Reports to be prepared and/or 

maintained. The following records, forms and reports are prescribed 

for use: 

  

b. Stock Card (SC) (Appendix 58) – shall be used to record all 

receipts and issues of supplies and the balance in quantity at 

any time. It shall be maintained by the Property and/or Supply 

Division/Unit for each item in stock. The IAR, RIS, PO and DR 



58 

 

serve as the original sources of information for making entries 

on the card. 

 

c. Supplies Ledger Card (SLC) (Appendix 57) – shall be used 

to record materials received, issued and the balance both in 

quantity and amount at any time. It shall be maintained by the 

Accounting Division/Unit for each kind of supplies and 

materials. The IAR, RIS, RSMI, PO and DR serve as the 

original sources of information for making entries on the card. 

 

d. Requisition and Issue Slip (RIS) (Appendix 63) – shall be 
used by the end-user to request issue of supplies and materials 
that are carried on stock. It is also used by the Property 
and/or Supply Division/Unit to indicate availability or non-

availability of items requisitioned and/or to record issues of 
item/s requisitioned. 

 

g. Report of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI) (Appendix 
64) – shall be prepared by the Property and/or Supply 
Custodian based on the RIS and shall be used by the 
Accounting Division/Unit as basis in preparing the JEV to 

record the supplies and materials issued. 
 

i. Report on the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) 

(Appendix 66) – shall be used to report the physical count of 

supplies by type of inventory as at a given date. It shows the 

balance of inventory items per card and per count and 

shortage/overage, if any. These include the semi-expendable 

property wherein the issue is covered by ICS. 

 
4.3. Appendix 66, Volume II of GAM for NGAS states that the: “RPCI shall be 

prepared semi-annually by the Inventory Committee; and shall be submitted to 

the COA Auditor concerned not later than July 31 and January 31 of each year 

for the first and second semesters, respectively.” 
 

4.4. As of December 31, 2020, the recorded inventories of supplies and materials 
and those issued/used amounting to ₱12,176,296.99 and ₱52,349,709.71, 
respectively, of the MSU-Main Campus and three (3) of its Supervised 
Institutions namely MSU-Buug, MSU-MSAT and MSU-LNAC, were as 
follows:

Grand Total   ₱12,176,296.99  ₱52,349,709.71  

 
4.5. Examination of the inventory accounts disclosed several deficiencies, as 

discussed below: 
 

a) Expenses totaling ₱41,078,690.44 were recorded based on a percentage 
and not on actual supplies and materials used/issued due to non-
submission of RSMI – MSU-Main Campus 

 
4.6. Verification of the inventory accounts of MSU-Main Campus showed that 

issued/used supplies and materials including semi-expendable machinery and 
equipment totaling ₱41,078,690.44 were not recorded by preparing a Journal 
Entry Voucher (JEV) based on RSMI as required by the GAM on NGAs, but 
rather, on adjustments that were made every quarter using a percentage ranging 
from 20% to 25% of the total inventory at hand, rendering the inventory and 
related expense account balances as of the given date erroneous and unreliable. 

 
4.7. Per inquiry from an Accounting personnel, it was learned that no RSMI was 

ever submitted by the Supply Division to their Office thus, recording the 
expenses for the used/issued inventory of supplies and materials had to be 
estimated rather than based on the actual supplies and materials 
consumed/utilized per RSMI. 
 

4.8. The Supply Officer informed that the RSMI was prepared for the period of CY 
2020 but not submitted to the Accounting Office due to their unawareness of 
the inventory accounting process. 
 

4.9. As audit references, the Audit Team has requested for the schedule of 
computation for the recorded issued/used supplies and materials and the RSMI 
for CY 2020 from the Accounting Office and Supply Division, respectively, 
but said reports are still not submitted to the Audit Team as of this date. 

 
4.10. The practice of the Accounting Office of recording expenses based on 

percentage and not on the actual supplies and materials consumed/utilized per 
RSMI has been the practice of the Campus for years, which is a clear 
indication of poor inventory management and lack of coordination between the 
concerned Offices.  
 



60 

 

b) Direct charging of procured inventory items to the expense account 
totaling ₱8,301,204.27 - MSU-MSAT, MSU-Buug and MSU-LNAC 

 
4.11. Verification of the transactions in the check disbursement journals of MSU-

MSAT, MSU-Buug and MSU-LNAC for CY 2020 disclosed that regular 
procurement of supplies and materials totaling ₱7,946,968.42 were recorded as 
outright expenses. As such, the receipt of the deliveries and the issuances of the 
supplies and materials were not recorded in the Inventory accounts of the 
agency. The balances of each of the inventory expense account of each 
Campus are shown in the table below:

4.12. Inquiry made with the Accountants of the three (3) Campuses disclosed that 

the procurement of supplies and materials were intended for immediate use by 
end-users; hence, were not coursed through inventory account.  
 

4.13. Moreover, the above supplies and materials were regular purchases and not 
purchased out of Petty Cash Fund (PCF); thus, should have been coursed 
through inventory account, as provided in Section 9, Chapter 8, Volume I of 
the GAM, as follows: 
 



61 

 

Regular purchases shall be coursed through the inventory account 
and issues thereof shall be recorded as they take place except for 
supplies and materials purchased out of PCF for immediate use or 

on emergency cases which shall be charged directly to the 
appropriate expense accounts. 

 
4.14. The practice of directly charging to the expense account the procurement of 

inventory items did not allow proper and accurate recording of the issuances of 
the inventories in their corresponding expense accounts since the JEVs were 
drawn based on the Disbursement Vouchers (DVs) of the actual purchases, and 
not on the RIS and the RSMI as required by GAM. 
 
c) Non-existence of inventories in stock, non-moving accounts for a period 

ranging from two to four years amounting to ₱2,213,713.70 – MSU-
MSAT   

 
4.15. Review of records disclosed that the Inventories account of MSU-MSAT 

include sub-accounts for Inventory Held for Consumption and Semi-
Expendable Machinery and Equipment. These are assets that should be fairly 
valued and should have actual physical existence as presented in the Financial 
Statements (FS). The physical inventory of these assets should be undertaken 
every semester to ensure the correctness of records and integrity of property 
custodianship.  
 

4.16. Verification of the GLs combined balance of ₱2,213,713.70 disclosed that a 
total of ₱1,657,918.77 of GL account balances were non-moving accounts for a 
period ranging from two to four years, as shown in the next table. If there were 
movements during the year, ending balances remain the same as those of 
beginning balances.

Total ₱1,657,918.77  ₱1,657,918.77    
 

4.17. The Accountant of MSU-MSAT disclosed his awareness of the abnormal 
condition of the accounts. He asserted that the amounts reported in the books 
no longer exist or were already issued/consumed but were not derecognized in 
the book due to absence of regular reconciliation between the Accounting and 
Property records, thus, the amounts are being carried forward every year 
without verification.  
 

4.18. The Supply Officer, who just assumed office in 2017, informed that there are 
no stocks or there was none left of any of the stocks for CY 2020 and previous 
years at the Supply Office, pertaining to not only the non-moving inventory 
accounts in question but to the total inventories account.  
 

4.19. The Audit Team suggests that the Supply Office gather the Purchase Orders 
and other related documents from which they can identify to whom or to which 
office/unit the non-existing inventories were issued, to come up with the RISs 
and RSMIs that will be the basis in the preparation of JEV dropping the 
amount from the inventory account. 
 

4.20. The assertion on the physical existence of the account balances of the 
inventories is clearly negated by its non-existence, thus rendering 
misstatements of the asset accounts consequently affecting the faithful 
representation of the year-end FS. 

 
d) Non-maintenance of required records/forms and other deficiencies in the 

receipt, recording, requisition and issuance of delivered inventory items – 
Main, Buug, MSAT and LNAC 

 
4.21. Examination of the inventory records and interview made with the personnel of 

the Accounting Offices and Supply Divisions of the four (4) Campuses 
revealed several deficiencies in their procedures involving the receipt, 
recording, requisition and issuance of inventory items, to wit: 

Responsible 
Office Campus Internal Control Weakness/Deficiency 

Supply 
Division 

Main, 
Buug, 
MSAT, 
LNAC 

a. Non-preparation and non-maintenance of 
Stock Cards (SCs) to record supplies 
received. Some items delivered directly to 
the end-users were no longer recorded and

4.22. The practice of automatic issuance of inventories to end-users upon 
delivery/receipt from suppliers should not preclude the concerned Accountants 
and the Supply Officers from maintaining the SLC and SC respectively. The 
maintenance of these records is intended to show not only the history of 
purchases and issuances but also the frequency of procurement, which is 

were not monitored. In MSU-Main Campus, 
deliveries to be stored in the stockroom were 
recorded in a logbook; 

Main, 
Buug, 
MSAT, 
LNAC 

b. Non-preparation of summary report of all 
the purchased and delivered inventory items 
at any given time, thus, the inflow/outflow 
of supplies in the Inventory Account was 
unreliable since this did not reflect the actual 
supplies that the Agency procured; 

Main, 
Buug, 
LNAC 

c. Absence of the Inventory Custodian Slips 
(ICS), thus, the accountability over the 
issued Semi-Expendable Machinery and 
Equipment could not be validated. 

Main d. Laxity in the use of the Requisition and 
Issue Slip (RIS) as some end-users/units 
were allowed to request the issuance of 
supplies and materials on stock by using 
forms other than the prescribed RIS such as 
a sheet of paper. Their personnel admitted 
that they were aware of the said violation but 
still allowed the said end-users/units to use 
forms other than the RIS due to the 
persistence and intervention of some 
Management Heads. 

Accounting 
Office 

Main, 
Buug, 
MSAT, 
LNAC 

e. Non-preparation and non-maintenance of 
Supply Ledger Cards (SLCs). The SLCs as 
prescribed by the GAM shall be used in the 
Accounting Division/Unit to record all 
receipts and issuances made for each type of 
supplies; and 

Main, 
Buug, 
MSAT, 
LNAC 

f. Non-application of the weighted average 
method to compute the cost of supplies and 
materials issued by the Agency, instead, the 
cost of supplies expense was based on a 
certain percentage of the total inventory 
amount per quarter (Main Campus) or 
purchases were directly charged to the 
expense accounts (Buug, MSAT and 
LNAC).

valuable in management’s monitoring, controlling and guide to future 
decisions in assessing the necessity in future procurement of inventories. 
 

4.23. Furthermore, the failure of the Campuses to adopt the perpetual inventory 
records such as stock cards and supplies ledger cards resulted to difficulties in 
the reconciliation of records between their respective Accounting Offices and 
Supply Divisions, and in the determination of the amount of inventory at hand 
at any given time. 
 
e) Failure to conduct physical count of inventory accounts and non-

preparation of the prescribed RPCI – Main, Buug and LNAC 
 

4.24. The RPCI was also sought from the Supply Offices of the MSU-Main Campus, 
MSU-Buug and MSU-LNAC for their respective agencies, however none was 
prepared and submitted by their Inventory Committees since no physical count 
of inventory was conducted for several years up to December 31, 2020. 
 

4.25. Whether there are stocks or none to physically count, the conduct is important, 
more so the preparation and submission of the RPCI. The RPCI validates the 
accuracy of both the Supply and the Accounting records after the reconciliation 
procedures to avoid misstatements in the reported FS balances. 
 

4.26. The above noted deficiencies affected the reliability of the balances of Inventory 
accounts as at December 31, 2020 and the fairness of presentation of the accounts 
in the financial statements. Further, the balance of accountability of the 
Property/Supply Officer accountable thereof could not be accurately established 
exposing government assets to risk of loss or misuse. 
 

4.27. We recommended and the Management agreed to:

Unreliable Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) Accounts -₱1,958,807,318.72 

5. The existence, ownership and accuracy of the PPE accounts amounting to 
₱1,958,807,318.72 as of year-end were doubtful due to: (a) the absence of 
adequate subsidiary and property records containing details and breakdown for 
some properties totaling ₱1,604,064,013.75, which is 81.89% of the total PPE 
balance; (b) non-conduct of complete annual physical count of PPE and non-



67 

 

reconciliation of Property and Accounting records resulting in material 
discrepancies in balances between the year-end FS and the Report on the 
Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) amounting to 
₱369,740,435.74; (c) non-recognition of on-going infrastructure projects in the 
Construction-in Progress (CIP) account amounting to ₱11,180,343.06; and (d) 
failure to provide for allowance for depreciation for depreciable assets with cost 
of ₱5,151,445.94, casting doubt on the reliability of the account balances 
presented in the FS. 

 
5.1. Sections 38 and 42, Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs provide the 

following:  
 

Section 8(g). Construction of PPE. During the construction period, 

all expenses incurred in relation to the construction of the PPE shall 

be taken up in the books as Construction in Progress (CIP) with the 

appropriate asset classification. As soon as the construction is 

completed, the “Construction in Progress” account shall be 

reclassified to the proper asset account. Likewise, all expenses such as 

interests, license fees, etc., during the construction period shall be 

capitalized. Xxx 

 

If the project is to be constructed by administration, the 

procurement of labor and materials shall be in compliance with the 

provisions of R.A. No. 9184 and its Revised Implementing Rules and 

Regulations. If by job order contracts, refer to relevant COA and CSC 

rules and regulations. 

 

Section 27. Depreciation.  PPE gradually loses its ability to provide 

service over the course of time. Because of this, its cost nee ds to be 

distributed on a systematic basis over its useful life. The allocated cost 

is referred to as depreciation.  The depreciation charge for each 

period shall be recognized as expense unless it is included in the 

carrying amount of another asset. Xxx 

 
Section 38. Physical Count of PPE. The entity shall have a periodic 

physical count of PPE, which shall be done annually and presented on 

the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment 

(RPCPPE) (Appendix 73) as at December 31 of each year. This shall 

be submitted to the Auditor concerned not later than January 31 of the 

following year. Equipment found at station and losses discovered 

during the physical count shall be reported to the Accounting 

Division/Unit for proper accounting/recording. 

 

Section 42. Accounting and Property Records to be maintained for 

PPE. The Chief Accountant shall maintain the PPELC for each 

category of PPE including work and other animals, livestock, etc. The 



68 

 

PPELC shall be kept to record promptly the acquisition, description, 

custody, estimated useful life, depreciation, impairment loss, disposal 

and other information about the asset. For check and balance, the 

Property and Supply Office/Unit shall likewise maintain PC for PPE 

in their custody to account for the receipt and disposition of the same. 

The balance per PC shall be reconciled with PPELC maintained by 

the Accounting Division/Unit. They shall also be reconciled with other 

property records like Property Acknowledgement Receipt (PAR). 

 

5.2. The year-end balance of the PPE accounts amounted to ₱1,958,807,318.72, 
broken down as follows:

5.3. Examination of the account as of year-end disclosed the following: 

 
a) The absence of adequate subsidiary and property records containing 

details and breakdown for some properties totaling ₱1,604,064,013.75, 
which is 81.89% of the total PPE balance 

 
5.4. The aggregate total of the PPE accounts of ₱1,958,807,318.72 comprises the 

bulk of the agency’s total assets which is 84.16%. 
 

5.5. Of this amount, 81.89% or ₱1,604,064,013.75 has inadequate details and 
records. The subsidiary ledger (SL) of some of these PPE accounts shows 
beginning balances only in lump-sum amounts, with no particulars to describe 
a particular asset or the composition of the lumped amount in violation of 
Section 4(l), Volume I and Section 12, Volume II of the NGAS Manual, which 
provide: 
 

“Sec. 4. Basic Features and Policies. The NGAS has the following 

basic features and policies, to wit: 
 

xxx

5.6. Likewise, in handling and recording the government properties, the GAM for 

NGAs specifically requires the preparation and maintenance of reports by the 
Property Division and Accounting Office. As discussed in detail in Section 42, 
Chapter 10 of the Manual, the following are the responsibilities of each office, 
alongside with overlapping responsibility as to the reconciliation of both 
records: 
 
                  Responsibilities of Property Division and Accounting Office

the same. 

Both Offices (Accounting 
Office and Property 
Division) 

Reconciliation of both records 

• For check and balance, the balance per PC 
shall be reconciled with PPELC maintained

5.8. Further interview with the Accountants and Property Officers of the concerned 
Campuses revealed the following:  
 

Campus Deficiency 
Main a. The Property Cards were not prepared and maintained by the 

Property Division (PD). In lieu of the PCs, the PD provided the 
Audit Team with the summary of their records for non-
expendable properties/equipment purchased as of December 31, 
2020. However, those records did not provide data on the 
description, acquisition, transfer, disposal, and other information 
about the PPE items. Hence, preparation and maintenance of 
updated and prescribed PCs per PPE category is still required. 

 
b. Further, it was noted that the PD only keeps records on items for 

the PPE accounts Machinery and Equipment, Furniture and 
Fixtures and Books, and Transportation Equipment, excluding 
items for the accounts Buildings and Other Structures, Land and 
Other Land Improvements, Other PPEs, and Construction-in-
Progress. Per inquiry, it was found out that the custody of 
records for the said excluded PPE items was transferred to the 
Property Planning Division (PPD). However, interview made 
with the personnel from PPD revealed that the only records 
being prepared and maintained in their Office were that of the 
University’s on-going construction projects. 

 
c. The two Divisions were reminded by the Audit Team that per 

mandated function, the PPD is only responsible for the records 
pertaining to on-going infrastructure projects and once 
completed, to forward the data pertaining thereto to the PD for 
proper recording in its Property Cards. This conflict of function 
resulted to non-maintenance of records for several PPE items, 
thus made it difficult to reconcile the amounts in the FS. 
 

d. Moreover, the Accounting Office did not maintain the required 
PPELC for all PPE categories. Alternatively, the Accounting 
Office maintains Lapsing Schedule of PPE which contains 
pertinent accounting data regarding the PPE items. However, 
several information required by the GAM for NGAs for a 
PPELC were not contained in the said Lapsing Schedule, such as 
the PPE items’ description, custody, Issuance/ Transfer and 
Adjustments and the adjusted cost, among others. 

 
MSAT a. The Accounting Office did not maintain the required PPELC for 

all PPE categories. Alternatively, the Accounting Office 
maintains a summary schedule of the PPE in which the 
computation of depreciation expense was taken up. However, 



72 

 

Campus Deficiency 
several information required by the GAM for NGAs for a 
PPELC were not contained in the said schedule, such as the PPE 
items’ description, custody, Issuance/ Transfer and Adjustments 
and the adjusted cost, among others. 

 
5.9. The absence of subsidiary ledgers (PPELC) by the Accounting Office and 

property cards by the PD did not allow easy analysis of the account and made 
the reconciliation between two PPE accounting records impracticable. The 
concerned offices should start with the maintenance of the required PCs and 
PPELCs in order to arrive at a reconciled property records with that of the 
accounting records. 
 
b) Non-conduct of complete annual physical count of PPE and non-

reconciliation of accounting and property records resulting in material 
discrepancy of ₱369,740,435.74 in balances between the year-end FS and 
the Report on Physical Count of PPE (RPCPPE) 

 
5.10. Of the ₱2,321,423,910.98 year-end balance (at cost) of PPEs, only 

₱716,094,822.26 or 30.85% was covered by the physical count actually 
conducted by the Inventory Committees of MSU-Main Campus and MSU-
MSAT. Comparison of records between the financial statements and the PPEs 
actually counted per RPCPPEs submitted disclosed variances totaling 
₱369,740,435.74, as shown in the table below:

5.11. Per inquiry, reconciliation between property records maintained by the 

Accounting Offices and the RPCPPE by the PDs were never conducted due to 
inadequate coordination between the said Offices, hence, there existed a 
material discrepancy in the reported balances.  
 

5.12. Further, several items of PPE included in the RPCPPEs of both the Main 
Campus and MSU-MSAT could not be identified in the items presented in the 
financial statements due to differences in account titles, posing difficulties in 
reconciling the balances between the Books and the RPCPPE.    
 

5.13. In addition, deficiencies and weaknesses in the valuation and reporting of 
physical inventory-taking in MSU-Main Campus were noted, as follows:  

 
i. No physical count was ever conducted for the PPE items lodged in 

the accounts Buildings and Other Structures, Land and Other Land 
Improvements, Other PPEs, and Construction-in-Progress because 
the custody of records was transferred to the Physical Plant Division 
(PPD);  

 
ii. The presented RPCPPE was not in the prescribed format and not 

submitted to the Audit Team within the prescribed period which is 
on or before January 31, 2020; 

 
iii. Transfer of property from one location to another, or from one 

accountable officer to another, were not properly documented; and 
 

iv. The RPCPPE was not verified by the COA representative, thus it is 
doubtful as to whether there was an actual count taken.  

 



74 

 

5.14. The conduct of annual physical inventory count as well as the preparation of 
the inventory report are indispensable procedures for checking the integrity of 
property custodianship and validating the accuracy of the book balances. Thus, 
it is important that PPE balances per physical inventory reports and per books 
are in agreement at all times in order to ensure reliability of the reported 
balances in the FS.  
 

5.15. Considering the materiality of the amount of discrepancy, a thorough 
examination of the accounting and property records and an extensive physical 
count of all the agency’s properties should be conducted. 
 
c) The non-recognition of on-going infrastructure projects in the 

Construction-in-Progress (CIP) account amounting to ₱11,180,343.06  
 

5.16. Per records, MSU-LNAC has two (2) on-going infrastructure projects as of 
December 31, 2020, to wit: 
 

Name of Project Project Cost Name of Contractor Remarks 

Repair and Rehabilitation 
of Academic Building ₱5,289,885.00 By admin On-going/75% 

Gymnasium   5,890,458.06 Johairy Builders 
Phase I 
complete 

Total Project Cost ₱11,180,343.06   
 

5.17. Verification of the related reports and documents for these on-going 
infrastructure projects showed that none of their progress billings were 
recognized in the CIP account and its corresponding payable or cash accounts. 
 

5.18. Hence, the year-end balance of the PPE account and its corresponding payable 
or cash account were misstated. 
 
d) Failure to provide for allowance for depreciation for depreciable assets  
 

5.19. For CY 2020, the Accountant of MSU-MSAT still failed to provide the 
allowance for depreciation of two (2) class of property, plant and equipment 
amounting to ₱5,151,445.94 contrary to Section 27, Volume I of the GAM, as 
shown in the table below:

75 

 

 
5.20. The absence of depreciation for the said PPE accounts affected the 

completeness and accuracy of the balance of Depreciation Expenses and 
Accumulated Depreciation for various PPE as of December 31, 2020. 
Furthermore, the failure to record the depreciation expenses for these assets 
understated expenses and overstated the book value of the fixed assets and 
equity accounts by still an undetermined amount, mainly due to the inadequate 
subsidiary accounting records maintained for the property and equipment. 
 

5.21. The above noted deficiencies casted doubt on the existence, ownership and 
accuracy of the reported PPE accounts balance, thus, affecting the fair presentation 
of the agency’s financial statements. 
 

5.22. We recommended and the Management agreed to:

Absence of SL and itemized listing for the Other Assets account - ₱28,406,108.07 

 

6. The existence and reliability of the year-end balance of the Other Assets 
accounts totaling ₱28,406,108.07 could not be ascertained due to absence of 
subsidiary ledgers or itemized listing to support the balance thereof, of which 
₱12,519,408.07 or 44.07% have been dormant for more than 5 years. 

6.1. One of management’s assertions in its financial statements is Existence of its 
assets. This assertion conveys that management’s assets presented in its 
financial statements actually exists. 



77 

 

6.2. The Revised Chart of Accounts for NGAs prescribed under COA Circular No. 
2015-007 dated October 22, 2015, provides that Other Assets account is used 
to recognize assets not falling under any of the specific assets accounts 
determined/stated in the GAM. 

6.3. COA Circular No. 97-001 February 5, 1997 sets the guidelines on the proper 
disposition/closure of dormant funds and/or accounts of NGAs. It also defines 
dormant accounts as individual or group of accounts which balances remained 
nonmoving for more than five years. 

6.4. The GL of the Other Assets account of as of year-end consists of the following 
items: 

  Fund 01 Fund 05  Fund 06  Total 
Cost ₱7,088,609.89  ₱18,128,758.18  ₱3,188,740.00  ₱28,406,108.07

6.5. Verification from the Accounting personnel of MSU-Main Campus disclosed 
that the Other Assets account aggregating to ₱28,406,108.07 as of year-end 
includes items of PPE that were fully depreciated but still serviceable. 
However, there were no subsidiary ledgers (SLs) or itemized listings to support 
the balances thereof, and said items were not included in the Report on the 
Physical Count of Plant, Property and Equipment (RPCPPE), hence, their 
existence could not be determined.  

6.6. Further verification also disclosed that this account includes items of PPE 
amounting to ₱12,519,408.07, or 44.07% of the total account balance, which 
had been non-moving since CY 2016. Aside from inadequate records, the non-
moving balance was caused by the negligence of the assigned Accounting 
personnel in keeping and updating the records for the said account.  

6.7. Based on the foregoing, the total Other Assets account of ₱28,406,108.07 was 
unreliable due to inadequate records and supporting documents to validate the 
account balances, thereby, affecting the over-all fair presentation of the 
financial position of the agency.  

6.8. We recommended the Management of MSU-Main Campus to: 

a. Instruct the Accountant to prepare, maintain and regularly update 
the SLs and itemized listings for the Other Assets account; and 

 
b. Establish the existence of the Other Assets account and conduct 

physical count thereof, and make the necessary adjustments, or if 
these are found to be inexistent then request for write-off of dormant

accounts as set forth under COA Circular No. 97-001 dated February 
5, 1997. 

 
Unliquidated Cash Advances - ₱13,598,806.74 

f) Advances to Special Disbursing Officers and Advances to Officers and 
Employees account balances of ₱5,640,665.30 and ₱7,958,141.44, respectively or 
a total of ₱13,598,806.74, remained unliquidated at year-end due to 
management’s continuous non-compliance with the rules and regulations in the 
grant, utilization and liquidation of cash advances as provided for under COA 
Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997, hence, the reliability of the year-
end balance of the said accounts could not be ascertained. 

 
7.1. COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 restates with amendments 

the rules and regulations on the granting, utilization and liquidation of cash 
advances under COA Circular No. 90-331 dated May 3, 1990, which provides 
for, among others the following: 

Section 4.1.3 A cash advance shall be reported on as soon as the 

purpose for which it was given has been served. 

Section 4.1.6. Transfer of cash advance from one Accountable Officer 
(AO) to another shall not be allowed. 

Section 5.1 Xxx. Failure of the AO to liquidate his cash advance 

within the prescribed period shall constitute a valid cause for the 

withholding of his salary and the instruction of other sanctions as 

provided for under paragraphs 9.2 and 9.3 hereof. 

Section 5.8. All cash advances shall be fully liquidated at the end of 

each year. Except for petty cash fund, the AO shall refund any 

unexpected balance to the Cashier/Collecting Officer who will issue 

the necessary official receipt. 

7.2. Analysis of the balance of the accounts Advances to Special Disbursing 
Officers (SDOs) and Advances to Officers and Employees (O&Es) showed 
that as of December 31, 2020, cash advances lodged in the said accounts 
amounting to ₱5,640,665.30 and ₱7,958,141.44, respectively or a total of 
₱13,598,806.74 remained unliquidated. Furthermore, 80.28% or 
₱10,916935.14 of this outstanding balance pertain to advances granted in the 
previous years, details summarized as follows:

Advances to SDOs - ₱5,640,665.30 

7.3. Examination of the account Advances to SDOs showed an outstanding balance 
of ₱5,640,665.30 as of year-end, of which 88.72% or ₱5,004,493.30 remained 
unliquidated for over one to two (2) years. The cash advances pertained to 
those granted to SDOs for special purposes/undertakings that had been 
undertaken/served as of December 31, 2020.  

7.4. Records disclosed that most of the cash advances were in connection with the 
payment of meals, snacks, supplies, materials, travelling allowance and 
registration fees for trainings, projects/research papers, meetings and other 
school activities or programs.  

7.5. The CAs were then transferred to non-bonded employees of the Campuses who 
were directly involved in the implementation of the related 
activities/undertakings. As a result, the liquidations of the CAs were often 
delayed as settlement and recording in the books of accounts depend upon the 
submission of the supporting documents by the concerned employees to the 
AO, exposing government funds to risks of misuse and losses. 

7.6. Moreover, no approved petty cash voucher or any document was presented 
showing proof that transfer of said funds were duly authorized by designated 
approving officers and properly received by the non-bonded employees. 

7.7. Interview with some of the SDOs revealed that these cash advances were all 
granted to them in as much as the concerned employees are not bonded. 

7.8. The records also showed that the SDOs had several cash advances granted 
even when the previous one has not been liquidated. The Audit Team reminded 
the concerned SDOs that this action is a violation of the prescribed guidelines 
on the rules and regulations on the granting, utilization and liquidation of cash 
advances. 



80 

 

Advances to Officers and Employees (O&Es)- ₱7,958,141.44 

7.9. Further review of the schedules submitted by the Accounting Offices showed 
that officials/employees of the Campuses failed to liquidate their cash advances 
made for local travel that were lodged in the Advances to Officers and 
Employees account amounting to ₱7,958,141.44, of which 74.30% or 
₱5,912,541.84 remained outstanding for over one to two (2) years. 

7.10. Since the CAs were unliquidated at year-end, the expenses incurred out of the 
CAs were not recorded resulting to the overstatement of the Advances to SDOs 
and Advances to O&Es accounts and the understatement of the related expense 
accounts. The failure of SDOs/AOs to liquidate CAs received within the 
prescribed period exposes the funds to the risks of loss and 
misappropriation/misapplication. 

7.11. Unliquidated cash advances may be considered proofs of misuse of public 
funds. In addition, unsettled ones are proper subjects of disallowance during 
post-audit by reason of failure to account for the utilized funds aside from 
serving as valid grounds for legal measures. Further, it has to be stressed that 
since utilization of the funds need recording, if omitted as to what had 
transpired in the actual set-up, their existence in the financial statements will 
render said records inaccurate. 

7.12. This is a reiteration of previous years’ audit findings and recommendations, 
which the Management of each Campus continuously failed to take any action 
of compliance. 

7.13. We recommended the Management of MSU-Main Campus and MSU-
MSAT to:  

a. Exhaust all options to demand for the settlement of long outstanding 
CAs that are due for liquidations including the withholding of 
salaries;  
 

b. Instruct the AOs to stop the practice of transferring cash advances to 
non-bonded employees which violates Section 4.1.6 of COA Circular 
No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997; 
 

c. Minimize the granting of cash advances to the Disbursing Officers 
and resort to direct payment to the respective accounts of internal 
payees and/or bank accounts of other creditors; and 
 

d. Henceforth, strictly enforce the provisions of COA Circular No. 97-
002 on the existing rules and regulations on the granting, utilization 
and liquidation of cash advances.

7.14. Below are the Management’s comments/responses relative to the 
aforementioned deficiencies and corresponding Audit Team’s Rejoinder:

In CY 2020, Management evaluated their 
current practices in the granting, utilization 
and liquidation of cash advances to ensure a 
more efficient and effective control over 
their cash advance (CA) system, as 
manifested in the significant decrease of the 
balances of their unliquidated cash 
advances as of year-end, as follows:

The Management further assured that they 
will comply with the recommendation to 
liquidate all outstanding CAs as of year-
end. 

The Audit Team 
commended the 
Management for 
exhausting efforts to 
demand from the 
erring AOs the 
submission of records 
regarding the 
outstanding CAs 
especially those 
pertaining to prior 
years, thus decreasing 
their unsettled CAs as 
of year-end. 
 
Nevertheless, they are 
still reminded to 
ensure that all CAs are 
liquidated as of year-
end to avoid the 
overstatement of the 
Advances to SDOs 
and Advances to 
O&Es accounts and 
the understatement of 
the related expense 
accounts.  

MSAT The Accountant of MSU-MSAT informed 
that in compliance with the audit 
recommendations for CY 2019, the Campus 
Head had issued a Memorandum dated 23 
July 2020 directing all AOs with 
unliquidated CAs to settle their 
accountabilities not later than August 15, 
2020, otherwise, their salaries will be 
withheld. Thus, he assailed that most of the 
AOs have already liquidated their CAs in 
compliance with the Campus’ 
Memorandum, but the personnel-in-charge 
did not submit the liquidation reports to the 
Accounting Office due to his heavy 

The Management was 
reminded that Section 
5.3 of COA Circular 
No. 97-002 dated 
February 10, 1997 
states that cash 
advances shall be 
considered liquidated 
upon the recording 
thereof by the 
Accountant in the 
books of accounts. 
Thus, notwithstanding 
their claim that the

workload. Nevertheless, they committed to 
fast-track the liquidation of the CAs. 
 

AOs have already 
settled their 
accountabilities, the 
failure of the 
Accounting Office to 
record the liquidations 
in the books does not 
relieve them from their 
liabilities. 

 

Irregular Expenditures – Honoraria amounting to ₱1,116,000.00 

8. MSU-Main Campus continuously paid honoraria amounting to ₱1,116,000.00 
to its officials and employees designated as chairpersons or members of 
various special committees for purposes in line with the exercise of their 
mandated functions in violation of the provisions of Administrative Order No. 
103, s. 2004 and COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012, thereby 
incurring irregular expenditures. 
 
8.1. Section 3 of the Administrative Order (AO) No. 103, s. 2004 dated August 

31, 2004 provides for the limitations on the granting of honoraria as follows: 
 

“SEC. 3. All NGAs, SUCs, GOCCs, GFIs and OGCEs, whether 

exempt from the Salary Standardization Law or not, are hereby 

directed to:  

 

(a) Limit grant of honoraria and other forms of allowance to the 

following:  

 

(1) Teaching personnel of the Department of Education, 

Commission on Higher Education, Technical Education and Skills 

Development Authority, SUCs and other educational institutions 

engaged in actual classroom teaching whose teaching load is 

outside the regular office hours or in excess of the regular load; 

 

(2) Lecturers, resource persons, coordinators and facilitators in 

seminars, training programs, and other similar activities in 

training institutions, including those conducted by entities for their 

officials and employees; 

 

(3) Chairs and members of commissions, boards, councils, or other 

similar entities who are not paid salaries but compensated in the 

form of honoraria as provided by law, rules and regulations; and 

 



83 

 

(4) Those who are involved in government procurement in 

accordance with Republic Act No. 9184 and DBM Budget Circular 

2004-5. 
 

8.2. Likewise, Sections 3.1 and 5.1 of COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 
29, 2012 with subject: Updated Guidelines for the prevention and 
disallowance of Irregular, Unnecessary, Excessive, Extravagant and 
Unconscionable Expenditures defines Irregular Expenditures as follows: 
 

Section 3.1 Definition. The term “irregular expenditure” signifies an 

“expenditure incurred without adhering to established rules, 

regulations, procedural guidelines, policies, principles of practices 

that have gained recognition in laws. Irregular expenditures are 

incurred if funds are disbursed without conforming with prescribed 

usages and rules of discipline. Xxx” 
 

8.3. Further, Item 1.2, Annex A of the same Circular provides that honoraria 
granted to members of special committees such as an Executive Committee, 
Program on Awards and Incentives for Service Excellence and Regional 
Selection and Promotions Board, which are performing functions inherent in 
the regular functions of the agency (COA Decision No. 2008-126 dated 
December 24, 2008.) are among those cases that are considered “Irregular” 
Expenditures. 
 

8.4. Review of DVs, summary reports, and other documents submitted by the 
Accounting Office for the months of July to December 2020 showed 
continuous payment of honoraria to chairpersons and members of various 
special committees amounting to ₱1,116,000.00, summarized as follows:

  Total       ₱1,116,000.00  
 

8.5. As can be gleaned from the above-table, recipients who were chairpersons 
and members of the five (5) special committees were continuously paid 
monthly honoraria ranging from ₱3,000.00 to ₱6,000.00 each, or a total of 
₱1,116,000.00, for the months of July to December of CY 2020, despite our 
previous year’s audit recommendation to stop the same. The recommendation 
was made on the premise that the activities performed by the special 
committees were regular functions of the Campus and the outputs were part 
of their inherent activities, as discussed in the table below:

Special Human 
Resources 
Merits 
Promotion and 
Selection Board 
(SHRMPSB); 
Promotion and

(HRMPSB);  

To facilitate the 
implementation of policies 
pertaining to the

The functions and outputs of 
these committees are considered 
regular functions and outputs of 
the Campus considering that 
government agencies are

Book V of Executive Order No. 
292 to establish a Merit 
Promotion Plan which stipulates 
their systems and procedures in 
the selection and promotion of

Committee Purpose/Function Audit Remarks 

Memorandum Circular No. 24, 
series of 2017 re: 2017 Omnibus 
Rules on Appointments and 
Other Human Resource Actions 
(ORAORHA), has already 
provided for the guidelines, 
policies and procedures, rules 
and regulations governing the 
appropriate legal qualifications 
and competency requirements in 
the deep selection, evaluation 
and assessment, hiring, 
recruitment and promotion 
processes to be 
adopted/implemented by the 
government agencies.  

Student 
Disciplinary 
Board 

 Section 22, Article VIII of 
CHED Memorandum Order No. 
9, Series of 2013 mandates HEIs 
to formulate gender and 
disability sensitive rules and 
regulations that will define 
appropriate student conduct and 
prescribe sanctions for 
misconduct, establish a 
discipline committee to ensure 
due process in dealing with 
student misconduct and have 
timely mechanisms to address 
student grievance.  

Land Use 
Committee 

To formulate policies, 
rules and regulations in the 
utilization of the land of 
the University and to 
safeguard the land of the 
MSU and its rights over its 
land area 

The said function is inherent to 
the duties of the Head of the 
Agency as stated in Section 2 of 
PD 1445: “Declaration of 
Policy. It is the declared policy 

of the State that all resources of 

the government shall be 

managed, expended or utilized 

in accordance with law and 

regulations, and safeguarded 

against loss or wastage through 

illegal or improper disposition, 

with a view to ensuring 

efficiency, economy and 

effectiveness in the operations of 

government. The responsibility 



86 

 

Name of 
Committee Purpose/Function Audit Remarks 

to take care that such policy is 

faithfully adhered to rests 

directly with the chief or head of 

the government agency 

concerned. 
Project Review 
Evaluation 
Committee 

To review,  evaluate and 
monitor various University 
projects. 

The review, evaluation and 
monitoring of projects are 
regular functions of the Agency, 
specifically the Office of the 
Vice President for Planning and 
Development.  
 
Further, R.A. 9184 provides that 
only the chairman and the 
members of the BAC and TWG 
are entitled to honoraria and 
only upon successfully 
completed procurement projects.  

 
8.6. Moreover, there were no attached supporting documents in the DVs to justify 

any work done or accomplished by the said committees, such as 
accomplishment reports, attendance sheets or minutes of meetings. The 
absence of said documents did not permit the Audit Team to perform other 
review procedures pertaining to the payment of honoraria. 
 

8.7. Section 2.1 of DBM Budget Circular No. 2007-002 dated October 1, 2007 
defines honorarium as a form of compensation given as a token of 
appreciation or reward for gratuitous services on account of one’s broad and 
superior knowledge or expertise in a specific field for which, going by 
custom, tradition or propriety, no fixed price is set. With this principle, the 
continuous payment of honoraria to the chairpersons and members of the five 
(5) special committees whose activities are already inherent or regular 
functions of the Agency and do not require a certain expertise are deemed 
irregular, thus should be discontinued.  
 

8.8. We recommended the Management to submit legal justifications for the 
continuous payment of honorarium to chairpersons and members of the 
said special committees, including supporting documents such as 
accomplishment reports, attendance sheets or minutes of meetings to 
justify any work done or accomplished by the said committees, 
otherwise, discontinue the said practice and cause the refund of the 
honoraria paid to said chairpersons and members of the special 
committees. 

 
Management Comments: 



87 

 

 

8.9. As of this date, the Management of MSU-Main Campus has not yet submitted 
their legal justifications for the continuous payment of honorarium to 
chairpersons and members of the said special committees to the Audit Team, 
including supporting documents such as accomplishment reports, attendance 
sheets or minutes of meetings.  

 
 

Inadequate documentation – Terminal Leave Benefits, ₱44,269,440.67 

 

9. Payment of Terminal Leave Benefits to fifty-three (53) retired employees 
amounting to ₱44,269,440.67 were not adequately supported with documents 
required under COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012, thus, the 
regularity of the said expenditure could not be ascertained. 
 
9.1. Paragraph 5.13 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 provides 

that payment of Terminal Leave Benefits (TLB) for purposes of retirement or 
voluntary resignation shall be supported with, among others, the following 
documents: 
 

a. Certified photocopy of employees leave card as at last date of service 
duly audited by personnel division and COA/Certificate of leave credits 
issued by the Admin/Human Resource Management Office (HRMO); 

 
b. Computation of terminal leave benefits duly signed/certified by the 

accountant; 
 

c. Applicant’s authorization (in affidavit form) to deduct all financial 
obligations with the employer/agency; and 

 
d. Affidavit of applicant that there’s no pending criminal investigation or 

prosecution against him/her (RA No. 3019). 
 

9.2. Post-audit of the DVs revealed that the TLB paid to fifty-three (53) 
employees of MSU-Main Campus totaling ₱44,269,440.67 for CY 2020 
(Annex B) were paid without the supporting documents enumerated in 
Paragraph 5.13 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012. 
 

9.3. The lacking documents such as the certified photocopy of leave cards duly 
audited by COA and the Accountant’s computation of TLB were necessary in 
order to ascertain the correctness of the paid accumulated leave credits and 
the computation of their corresponding money value. 
 

9.4. Likewise, the retirees’ authorization to deduct all financial obligations with 
the agency against the TLB is needed to ensure settlement of his/her 
accountabilities, while the affidavit that there is no pending criminal 



88 

 

investigation or prosecution against the employee is necessary to comply with 
RA No. 3019, which stipulate among others, that no public officer shall be 
allowed to resign or retire pending an investigation, criminal or 
administrative, or pending a prosecution against him, for any offense under 
the Act. 
 

9.5. In view of the lack of required documents, the regularity of the payment for 
the TLB could not be ascertained. 
 

9.6. We recommended the University President to require: 
 

a.  The Human Resource Development Office (HRDO) to submit first 
the leave cards of the retirees to the Audit Team for auditing before 
processing the TLB; and 
 

b.   The Chief Accountant and/or HRDO to submit to the Audit Team 
the lacking documents for review to ascertain the validity/regularity 
of the payments made; and henceforth, ensure that claim for TLB is 
duly supported with the required documents pursuant to the said 
COA Circular.  

 
 
 
 
Management Comments: 

 
9.7. The HRDO of MSU-Main Campus assured that their Office has complied 

with all the required supporting documents and duly attached them to the 
DVs of the TLB claims before submitting the same to the Accounting Office, 
for processing.  
 

9.8. The Management committed to trace the whereabouts of the supporting 
documents and to comply with the recommendation to submit first the leave 
cards of the retirees to the Audit Team for auditing before processing the 
TLB. 

  
 

Compliance with RA 9184 
 

Incomplete submission of contracts and attachments for infrastructure projects 

 
10. Comprehensive auditorial and technical review of various infrastructure 

projects amounting to ₱106,998,924.23 could not be conducted due to non-
submission of the copies of the approved contract and each of all the 
documents forming part thereof, Detailed Breakdown of the Approved Budget 
for the Contract (ABC) and Contract Cost including detailed breakdown of 



89 

 

estimates, complete set of Approved Plans/Drawings and other pertinent 
documents, in violation of COA Circular No. 2009-01 dated February 12, 
2009.  
 
10.1. Sections 3.1.1, 3.1.2, 3.1.4, 3.1.5 and 3.1.6 of COA Circular No. 2009-001

Section 3.1.4. The Auditor shall review the contract within a period 

ranging from five (5) to twenty (20) working days from receipt, 
depending on the complexity of the contract. The auditorial review 



90 

 

shall consist in the evaluation of compliance with the requirements of 
applicable laws, rules and regulations, completeness of documentary 
requirements and an initial evaluation that the contractual covenants 
are not disadvantageous to the government. Without waiting for the 
lapse of the period herein established, the Auditor concerned shall call 
the immediate attention of management regarding defects and 
deficiencies noted in the contract and suggest such corrective 
measures as are appropriate and warranted. Where the defect or 
deficiency is not susceptible of rectification and renders the contract 
totally or partially void, the head of the agency shall be notified within 
twenty-four (24) hours from such determination indicating the reasons 
therein.  

 
Section 3.1.5. Within five (5) working days after the auditorial review, 

the Auditor shall forward the contract and its supporting documents 

for technical review to the Technical Audit Specialist (TAS) assigned 

in the auditing unit/cluster or to the Regional Technical Services

10.2. The same Circular also provides a checklist for Technical Evaluation of 

Infrastructure Contracts in its “Annex A”, to wit: 
 

1. Copy of approved contracts and all of its integral parts necessary for 
review. 

2. Copy of complete set of approved plans/drawings including the

10.3. In CY 2020, MSU-Main Campus and MSU-MSAT had the following on-

going infrastructure projects:

10.4. Post-audit of the pertinent DVs of the above-projects of MSU-Main Campus 

showed that bidding documents including a copy of approved contract and all 
of its integral parts were made an attachment to the mobilization and progress 
payment instead of submitting it in advance which negated the Audit Team 
for an advance review. In the detailed evaluation of the same, we noted that 
the other five (5) documents enumerated in Annex A of the IRR of RA 9184 
were not attached. Non-submission of these documents is a recurring issue 
subjected to previous audit findings which the Management continuously 
failed to address.  
 

10.5. Similarly, despite the project completion of MSU-MSAT’s infrastructure 
project in March 2021, no auditorial and technical review has been conducted 



92 

 

yet by the Audit Team due to the Management’s non-submission of 
documents vital for review such as the copies of the approved contract and all 
of its integral components, Detailed Breakdown of its ABC and Contract Cost 
including detailed breakdown of estimates and complete set of Approved 
Plans/Drawings prepared and approved by Management. Furthermore, the 
DVs pertaining to the advance payment, progress and final billings of the said 
infrastructure project are not yet submitted to the Audit Team.  
 

10.6. As a consequence, the said implemented infrastructure projects were not 
subjected to Technical Evaluation by the Technical Audit Specialist (TAS) 
from COA Regional Office. Thus, review of the reasonableness of the ABC 
and contract cost, validation of the Physical Accomplishment Reports as well 
as determination on whether the said infrastructure project was built in 
accordance with plans and designs could not be done. 
 

10.7. Non-submission of the contract with all of its attachment prior to payment of 
advance payment and other progress billing is a fatal flaw which will warrant 
suspension in audit of the transaction should there be lacking documents and 
unfavorable review by the technical specialist of the Region.  
 
 
 

10.8. We recommended the Management to:  
 

a. Immediately submit to the Audit Team the copies of the approved 
contracts and each of all the documents forming part thereof, 
Detailed Breakdown of the ABC and Contract Cost including 
detailed breakdown of estimates, complete set of Approved 
Plans/Drawings and other pertinent documents of the completed 
infrastructure projects, as well as the DVs pertaining to the 
advance payment, progress and final billings; 
 

b. Re-visit the composition of their BAC/SBAC for possible additional 
competent personnel or re-organize the entire SBAC including its 
TWG to give rise to new set of officers who can comply with the 
minimum requirement set-forth in the bidding proceeding; and 
 

c. Henceforth, strictly adhere to the above-cited provisions of COA 
Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009 in the prompt 
submission to the Audit Team of the copies of perfected contracts 
and each of all the documents forming part thereof as mentioned in 
Section 3.1.2 and the specific documentary requirements for 
technical evaluation as enumerated in Annex A. 

 
Management Comments: 

 



93 

 

10.9. The Planning Officer of MSU-Main Campus informed that their Office is 
already in the process of compiling the required documents for the on-going 
infrastructure projects and committed to submit the same to the Audit Team 
as soon as possible. 
 

10.10. The BAC Chairman of MSU-MSAT also committed to submit the required 
documents for their completed infrastructure project. 

 
 
Non-posting to PhilGEPS 

 
11. Procurement of office supplies, materials and equipment totaling 

₱89,324,145.47 made through shopping and small value procurement were not 
posted in the PhilGEPS, in the agencies’ website and at any conspicuous place 
in their premises, contrary to Sections 54.2 and 54.3 of the IRR of RA 9184, 
thus, transparency and equal opportunities were not given to all qualified 
suppliers and the most advantageous price for the University may not be 
obtained. 
 
11.1. Sections 54.2 and 54.3 of the 2016 Revised IRR of RA 9184 provides that: 

 
Section 54.2. For alternative methods of procurement, the procuring 

entity may dispense the advertisement in the newspaper and posting 

requirement as prescribed in section 21.2.1 of this IRR. 

 

For the following modalities, however, through its BAC Secretariat, 

shall post invitation or request for submission of price 

quotations/proposals in the philGEPS website, the website of the 

Procuring Entity concerned, if available, and at any conspicuous 

place reserved for this purpose in the premises of Procuring Entity for 

a period of at least three (3) calendar days: 

 

1. Section 52.1 (b) Shopping for ordinary supplies and equipment 
not available in DBM-PS (for ABC above Fifty Thousand 

(P50,000.00)); 

2. Section 53.1 Two Failed Biddings; and 
3. Section 53.9 Small Value Procurement (For ABC of Above Fifty 

Thousand (P 50, 000.00). 

 

Section 54.3 of the same further provides that in all instances of 

alternative methods of procurement, the BAC, through the Secretariat, 

shall post, for information purposes, the notice of award, contract or 

purchase order, including notice to proceed if necessary, in the 

PhilGEPS website, the website of the Procuring Entity concerned, if 

available, and at any conspicuous place reserved for this purpose in 



94 

 

the premises of the Procuring Entity, except for contract with ABC of 

Fifty Thousand Pesos (₱50,000.00) and below. 

 
11.2. Review of the procurement transactions of MSU-Main Campus, MSU-

LNAC, MSU-Buug and MSU-MSAT made thru Shopping and Small Value 
Procurement for CY 2020 showed that the posting requirements for contracts 
with ABC of more than Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) aggregating to 
₱89,324,145.47 (Annex C) were not complied by their respective BAC 
Secretariats, contrary to the above-cited provisions of the Revised IRR of RA 
9184. 
 

11.3. The non-posting of the required documents such as the Request for 
Quotations (RFQs), Purchase Orders (POs), Notices of Awards (NOAs) and 
Notices to Proceed (NTPs) in the PhilGEPS website, the website of the 
Procuring Entity concerned, if available, and at any conspicuous place 
reserved for this purpose in the premises of the Procuring Entity as required 
under Sections 54.2 and 54.3 of the Revised IRR of 9184 did not permit 
transparency and equal opportunities to all qualified suppliers and the most 
advantageous price for the Campus may not be obtained, defeating the very 
purpose of the rules and regulations provided in RA9184 and its IRR.  
 

11.4. We recommended the Campus Heads to instruct their respective BAC, 
through its BAC Secretariat to observe the proper posting of the RFQs, 
POs, NOAs and NTPs in the PhilGEPS, in their website and at any 
conspicuous place in their premises for procurement contracts with ABC 
of more than Fifty Thousand Pesos (₱50,000.00) made thru shopping and 
small value procurement, pursuant to Sections 54.2 and 54.3 of the 
Revised IRR of RA 9184. 

 
Management Comments: 

 
11.5. During the exit conferences, the Management of the concerned campuses 

commented the following: 
 

Campus Comments 
MSU-Main Campus The Management of MSU-Main 

Campus informed that their failure to 
observe the posting requirements for 
the procurement of office supplies, 
materials and equipment made 
through shopping and small value 
procurement for CY 2020 was due to 
the inability of their BAC Secretariat 
to regularly report to Office due to the 
COVID-19 Pandemic. However, they 
assured that for future procurements, 



95 

 

Campus Comments 
they will attach their proof of posting 
in the DVs. 

MSU-MSAT The Management of MSU-MSAT was 
amenable that their failure to comply 
with the posting requirements in the 
PhilGEPS, their website and at any 
conspicuous place in their premises 
was due to the heavy workload of the 
BAC Secretariat, who is also 
designated as the Campus Dean. 
 
The BAC Chairman informed the 
Audit Team that their agency had just 
recently re-registered their PhilGEPS 
account and committed to comply 
with the audit recommendation. 

MSU-Buug and MSU-LNAC The Management of both Campuses 
also committed to comply with the 
audit recommendation to observe the 
proper posting of the RFQs, POs, 
NOAs and NTPs in the PhilGEPS, in 
their website and at any conspicuous 
place in their premises. 

 
 

Incomplete Report of Projects/Programs/Activities (PPAs) 

  

11. Non-inclusion of non-infrastructure projects in the Report of PPAs submitted 
by the Campus and failure to notify the Audit Team before the start of any 
program/activity as required in COA Circular No. 2013-004 dated January 30, 
2013 precluded the timely auditorial review and evaluation thereof. 

11.1. Section 2.1 of COA Circular No. 2013-004, dated January 30, 2013 
provides that “at the beginning of the year, all government agencies shall 
provide their respective assigned supervising Auditor and Audit Team 
Leader with the list of on-going projects, programs or activities and those 
that are to be implemented during the year.  

11.2. The non-infrastructure PPAs is understood to include the procurement of 
goods and activities such as but not limited to medical and dental missions; 
distribution of relief goods and services; feeding programs; sports, athletic, 
and cultural/social events; employment and livelihood fairs and training; 
workshops and seminars; and office anniversary celebrations.  



96 

 

11.3. Further, Section 3.0 of the same Circular requires that the Head of the 
Agency shall inform its Supervising Auditor (SA) and Audit Team Leader 
(ATL) within ten (10) days after the award of the infrastructure or before 
the start of the programs/activities and the SA or ATL shall validate the 
same. (emphasis supplied) 

11.4. In the course of our audit, it was observed that non-infrastructure projects 
such as the procurement of goods and conduct of other programs and 
activities like cultural and social events, trainings, foundation days and 
commencement exercises were not included in the Report of PPAs 
submitted to the Audit Team by the MSU-Main Campus and three (3) of its 
Supervised Institutions namely MSU-LNAC, MSU-Buug and MSU-MSAT. 
Consequently, the list of PPA submitted to the Audit Team is incomplete. 

11.5. Furthermore, the Management did not notify the Audit Team within ten (10) 
days before the conduct of their programs/activities, thus, precluded the 
timely auditorial review and evaluation thereof. 

11.6. The incomplete submission of the list of PPAs and the failure to notify the 
Audit Team before the start of any program/activity did not promote 
transparency and accountability of MSU-Main Campus and its Supervised 
Institutions’ transactions involving public interest.  

11.7. We recommended and the Management of the concerned Campuses 
agreed to instruct the personnel assigned to prepare their quarterly 
Report of PPA to include non-infrastructure projects and to inform the 
Audit Team within ten (10) days before the start of their 
programs/activities for validation purposes, in compliance with COA 
Circular No. 2013-004. 

 

Absence of an Income Generating Projects (IGP) Manual and weak internal control over 
operations of IGPs 

 

12. The Management’s failure to install, implement, and monitor a sound internal 
control system in the various operations of IGP and other Business Operations 
(under STF) contrary to the provisions of Sec 3.4.3 of NBC No. 331, Sec 36 of 
CHED Memo Order No. 20, Series of 2011, Sec. 123 and 124 of PD 1445, 
rendered the reported income and other financial information from IGPs 
unreliable.  
 

12.1. Section 123 of PD 1445 defines Internal Control as the plan of organization 
and all the coordinate methods and measures adopted within an organization 
or agency to safeguard its assets, check the accuracy and reliability of its 
accounting data, and encourage adherence to prescribed managerial policies. 



97 

 

 

12.2. While, Section 32 of the Government Accounting and Auditing Manual 
defines Internal Control as follows: 
 

Internal Control comprises the plan of organization and all the 

methods and measures adopted within an agency to ensure that 

resources are used consistent with laws, regulations and policies; 

resources are safeguarded against loss, wastage and misuse; 

financial and nonfinancial information are reliable, accurate and 

timely; and operations are economical, efficient and effective. 

 

12.3. Furthermore, Section 124 of PD 1445 provides: “It shall be the direct 
responsibility of the agency head to install, implement, and monitor a sound 
system of internal control.” 
 

12.4. Review of the operations of the various Income Generating Projects and 
other Business Operations of the Campus disclosed the absence of an IGP 
Manual which is the responsibility of the SUCs as set-forth under Sec. 36 of 
CHED Memorandum Order No. 20, Series of 2011. The said Manual could 
have been the basis of the IGPs in their internal procedures and process 
flows to implement their operations, and to make sure these are allied with 
the functions and mandate of the SUC. 
 

12.5. Further, as gathered during interviews and validation conducted in the 
offices of the various IGPs of the Campus, inadequate internal control, 
specifically in its reporting and collection system, was observed. The 
following weaknesses in the internal control system were identified in some 
IGPs and other business operations: 

 
1. The IGPs did not have formal and official records for their 

sales/income and expenses incurred. The records kept were 
inadequate; 

 
2. Some IGPs maintain cashbooks but they were not maintained or 

updated regularly and were not in the prescribed format; 
 
3. Collections made by the IGPs were not remitted intact to the 

Campus’ Collecting Officer contrary to the provisions of Sec. 69 
(1) of PD 1445. The IGP Heads admitted that they were not aware 
of the said requirement of remitting their collection intact to the 
Collecting Officer of the Campus. It was also learned that most of 
the IGPs’ collections were used to defray the operating expenses of 
their respective units; and 
 

4. Collections for sales were not issued with Official Receipts, 
instead, acknowledgement slips or temporary receipts were being 



98 

 

used because the IGPs were not provided with the Official Receipts 
of the Campus. This practice violates Section 72, Volume I of the 
GAAM, which states that: “At no instance shall temporary receipts 
be issued to acknowledge the receipt of public funds.” 

 

12.6. The conditions cited above indicate weaknesses or lapses in the internal 
control system over these IGPs and other Business Operations, hence, 
reliability of sales or income reported was not assured. 
 

12.7. No Notice of Suspension was issued on this observation since this pertains 
to evaluation of existing internal control on the agency’s operation of IGPs 
and other business establishments. 
 

12.8. We recommended the Management to: 
 

a. Cause the creation of a committee to prepare an IGP Manual to 
serve as a guide for facilitating all processes and transactions, most 
particularly in starting and managing IGPs; and 
 

b. Adopt the necessary methods and measures to ensure that 
operations of IGPs are consistent with laws, regulations and 
policies so that the university’s resources are safeguarded against 
loss, wastage and misuse; income reported are reliable, accurate 
and timely; operations are economical, efficient and effective.  

 
 
Failure to allow an access to the University’s Information System 

 
13. Mindanao State University-Main Campus did not allow the Audit Team to 

access its Information System despite formal written request which is not in 
consonance with Paragraphs 4.1 and 4.2 of COA Circular No. 2020-10 dated 
December 2, 2020. 
 
13.1. Paragraphs 4.1 and 4.2 COA Circular No. 2020-10 dated December 2, 2020 

state that: 
 
4.1 COA auditor shall transmit a written request to the audited entities 

for a read/review, extract, and print access right to the information and 

communication systems, electronic data messages an source documents 

with adherence to the general data privacy principles of transparency, 

legitimate purpose and proportionality. The request shall state the 

purpose and the specific data which are necessary to be accessed to 

meet its audit objectives. 

 

4.2 within five (5) days after the receipt of the request, the audited 

entities shall provide COA auditors a unique users account to establish 



99 

 

accountability in accessing information and communication system and 

electronic data. The Audited entity may also share the electronic data 

electronically or provide the same through back up file created in the 

entity’s environment and shared on a removable media with COA 

auditors. The user account profile should have a read,view, print, and/or 

download capability. 

 
13.2. During audit, a written request was sent to the University President to allow 

the Audit Team to access their Information System with the purpose of 
accessing data such as the Report of Checks Issued (RCI) and Cash Receipt 
Records (CRR) which will serve as audit references, but said request was 
denied.  
 

13.3. The non-compliance of the MSU-Main Campus with the above-cited 
provisions shall be a basis for filing appropriate administrative sanctions 
pursuant to its penal clause. 
 

13.4. We recommended the University President to instruct the Director of 
Information and Communications Technology Center (ICTC) to grant 
the Audit Team an access to their Information System. 
 
 

Management Comments: 
 

13.5. In their response letter dated March 29, 2021, the University Legal Counsel 
denied the said request of the Audit Team to access the University’s 
Information System for the following reasons: a) the purpose of the request 
and the specific data to be accessed were not stated in the Audit Team’s 
request letter dated January 19, 2021; b) the Budget and Accounting 
Divisions are already compliant with all existing COA regulations of which 
an additional access the University’s information system will be considered 
redundant; and c) their Information System is sensitive, and access to the it 
is strictly regulated not only for the protection of the data of the university 
but also under the Data Privacy Act of the Philippines and other relevant 
laws. 
 

Audit Rejoinder:  
 

13.6. In our response letter dated April 15, 2021, the Management was informed 
that: a) the main purpose of the said request is to obtain timely and relevant 
references in the conduct of audit of the Campus’ disbursement and 
collection transactions including, but not limited to Cash Receipts Record 
(CRRec) and RCI; b) the Audit Team has been encountering difficulties in 
gathering data for audit due to the voluminous, unorganized and incomplete 
documents being submitted by the Management. In addition, these 
documents were always submitted beyond the prescribed period, a recurring 



100 

 

issue that has been addressed to the Management thru various AOMs in the 
previous years; c) Paragraph 4.2 of COA Circular No. 2020-10 dated 
December 2, 2020 specifies that COA’s unique user account profile is 
limited to a read/view, print, and/or download capability, as such, we 
neither have the right nor intend to modify or alter any existing data in their 
information system; and d) any data to be obtained from the information 
system will be handled with utmost confidentiality by our Office, in 
accordance with Paragraphs 4.4 and 4.5 of COA Circular No. 2020-10 dated 
December 2, 2020 which state that: 
 

Paragraph 4.4. COA auditors shall treat all information gathered 

with appropriate level of confidentiality pursuant to existing laws, 

rules, and regulations, particularly those concerning data security 

and personal data protection. The Data Protection Officer of the 

audited entity should be informed before collection of pertinent 

personal data. 

 

Paragraph 4.5. COA shall implement appropriate organizational, 

physical and technical security measures to protect the electronic 

data messages and documents obtained in carrying out their 

mandated functions. 

 
13.7. With these, the Audit Team maintains its request for the Management to 

allow access to its Information System by providing a unique user account 
profile for COA, or if not feasible as of the moment, to facilitate the process 
of having the needed data shared to the Audit Team electronically through a 
back-up file created in the entity’s environment and shared on a removable 
media as prescribed in Section 4.2 of COA Circular No. 2020-10, anytime 
such data is needed for audit purposes. 
  

13.8. The Management did not response to our letter as of this date. 
 

 

Compliance with RA No. 9710 for Gender and Development (GAD) Plan and Budget 

 
14. All Campuses were not able to formulate its GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) for 

CY 2020 contrary to existing laws, rules and regulations, thus attainment of 
GAD objective to address gender concerns and issues of the agency was not 
ensured. 
 
14.1 Section 31 of the General Provisions of RA No. 11465 for FY 2020 reads: 

 
All agencies of the government shall formulate a Gender and 

Development Plan designed to address gender issues within 

their concerned sectors or mandate and implement the 

applicable provisions under Republic Act No. 9710 or the 



101 

 

Magna Carta of Women, Convention on the Elimination of All 

Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Beijing Platform 

for Action, the Philippine Plan for Gender-Responsive 

Development (1995-2025), and the Philippine Development 

Plan. 

 

The Gender and Development Plan shall be integrated in the 

regular activities of the agencies, which shall be at least (5%) of 

their budgets. For this purpose, activities currently being 

undertaken by agencies which relate to Gender and 

Development or those that contribute to poverty alleviation, 

economic empowerment especially of marginalized women, 

protection, promotion, and fulfillment of women’s human rights, 

and practice of gender-responsive governance are considered 

sufficient compliance with said requirement. Utilization of the 

Gender and Development budget shall be evaluated based on 

the Gender and Development performance indicators identified 

by said agencies. 

 
14.2 Likewise, the Philippine Commission on Women (PCW), National 

Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) and Department of Budget 
and Management (DBM) Joint Circular No. 2012-01 provides that: 
 

Item 2.3 -  X x x all government departments, including their 

attached agencies, offices, bureaus, state universities and 

colleges (SUCs), government-owned and controlled 

corporations (GOCCs), local government units (LGUs) and 

other government instrumentalities shall formulate their annual 

GPBs within the context of their mandates to mainstream 

gender perspectives in their policies, programs and projects.  

Item 3.2 - “GAD planning and budgeting shall be conducted 
annually as part of all programming and budgeting exercises of 

agencies. The PAPs in the GPB shall be included in the agency 

budget proposal and they shall be reflected in the Annual Work 

and Financial Plan (AWFP) of concerned offices or units within 

the agency or department. 

14.3 In the course of our audit, it was noted that all campuses still failed to 
formulate and submit an approved GAD Plan and Budget for CY 2020, 
despite previous years’ audit recommendations. 

 

14.4 As the required submission of GPB to PCW for review and approval was 
not observed, campuses were not assured that gender issues were fully 
addressed during the year, while intended GAD beneficiaries were deprived 
of the opportunity to avail of the benefits expected therefrom.   



102 

 

 
14.5 The absence of a GAD Plan and Budget is contrary to existing laws, rules 

and regulations, thus, attainment of GAD objective to address gender issues 
and concerns of the agency was not ensured. 
 

14.6 This is a reiteration of previous year’s audit findings. 
 

14.7 We recommended and the Management of the concerned Campuses 
agreed to: 

 
a. Ensure adherence to existing laws, rules and regulations on the 

preparation, submission, review, endorsement and approval of the 
Agency’s GPB to the PCW and other oversight government 
agencies; and 

b. Include/Allocate in the Annual Budget the needed funds for the 
implementation of GAD programs/activities pursuant to PCW-
NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01. 

 

 

Compliance with Tax Laws 

 
15. The non-submission of the FY 2020 schedule of taxes withheld and remittances 

along with supporting documents of all Campuses delayed the timely audit of 
the Due to BIR account. 

15.1 Section 69 of PD 1445 as well as BIR Revenue Regulations No. 2-98 requires 
that public officers authorized to receive and collect moneys arising from 
taxes shall remit or deposit intact in full amounts so received and collected, 
and shall thereafter be remitted in full on or before the 15th day of the 
following month.  
 

15.2 Despite the Audit Team’s verbal and written requests to all Campuses, their 
respective Accountants failed to submit the required FY 2020 schedule of 
taxes withheld and remittances along with supporting documents to COA as 
of date. Hence, delaying timely audit of the taxes withheld and remittances of 
the Due to BIR Account.  
 

15.3 This is a reiteration of previous year’s audit findings. 
 

15.4 We recommended and the Management of the concerned Campuses 
agreed to require their respective Accountants to submit to the Audit 
Team the duly accomplished schedule of taxes withheld and remittances 
along with supporting documents to facilitate audit thereof. 

 



103 

 

 

Compliance with RA No. 8291 on Proper Deductions and Remittances of Government 

Service Insurance System (GSIS) Premiums  
 

16. The non-submission of the FY 2020 schedule of monthly deductions and 
remittances of insurance premiums and repayments of loans to GSIS along 
with supporting documents delayed the timely audit of the Due to GSIS 
account. 
 
16.1 Section 14.1, Rule III of RA No. 8291, the GSIS Act of 1997, requires that 

each government agency shall remit directly to the GSIS the employees’ 
and government agency’s contributions within the first ten days of the 
calendar month following the month to which the contributions apply. The 
remittance by the government agency of the contributions to the GSIS shall 
take priority over and above the payment of any and all obligations, except 
salaries and wages of its employees.  
 

16.2 Despite the Audit Team’s verbal and written requests to all campuses, their 
respective Accountants failed to submit the required FY 2020 schedule of 
monthly deductions and remittances of insurance premiums and repayments 
of loans to GSIS along with supporting documents to COA as of date. 
Hence, delaying timely audit of the withheld and remitted premiums/loan 
repayments of the Due to GSIS Account. 
 

16.3 This is a reiteration of previous year’s audit findings. 
 

16.4 We recommended and the Management of the concerned Campuses 
agreed to require their respective Accountants to submit to the Audit 
Team the duly accomplished schedule of monthly deductions and 
remittances of insurance premiums and repayments of loans to GSIS 
along with supporting documents to facilitate audit thereof. 

 

 

Compliance with RA No. 9679 on Proper Deductions and Remittances of PAG-IBIG 

Premiums 

 

17. The non-submission of the FY 2020 schedule for Pag-IBIG contributions, 
short-term loan amortization and remittances along with supporting 
documents delayed the timely audit of the Due to Pag-IBIG account.  
 

17.1 Section 3 (b and c), Rule VII of RA No. 9679, Home Development Mutual 
Fund Law of 2009, states that:  
 

“Every employer required to set aside and remit such 

contributions as prescribed under R.A. No. 9679 and these Rules shall 

be liable for their payment, and non- payment thereof shall further 



104 

 

subject the employer to a penalty of three percent (3%) per month of 

the amounts payable from the date the contributions fall due until 

paid. Every employer who actually deducts from the salary of his 

employee the latter’s loan amortization or payments to the Fund, as 

provided for under these Rules, shall be liable for their payment, and 
non-payment thereof shall likewise further subject the employer to a 
penalty of three percent (3%) per month of the amounts payable from 

the date the loan amortizations or payments fall due until paid. 

It shall be mandatory and compulsory for all government 

instrumentalities, agencies, including government-owned and 

controlled corporations, to provide the payment of contributions in 
their annual appropriations. Penal sanctions shall be imposed upon 

these employers who fail to include the payment of contributions on 

time, or delay the remittance of the required contributions to the 

Fund. The heads of offices and agencies shall be administratively 
liable for non-remittance of the required contributions to the Fund.” 

17.2 Despite the Audit Team’s verbal and written requests to all Campuses, their 
respective Accountants failed to submit the required FY 2020 schedule for 
Pag-IBIG contributions, short-term loan amortization and remittances along 
with supporting documents to COA as of date. Hence, delaying timely audit 
of the withheld and remitted premiums/loan repayments of the Due to Pag-
IBIG Account. 
 

17.3 This is a reiteration of previous year’s audit findings. 
 

17.4 We recommended and the Management of the concerned Campuses 
agreed to require their respective Accountants to submit to the Audit 
Team the duly accomplished schedule for Pag-IBIG contributions, 
short-term loan amortization and remittances along with supporting 
documents to facilitate audit thereof. 

 
 
Compliance with RA No. 7875 on Proper Deductions and Remittances of PhilHealth 

Premiums 

 

18. The non-submission of the FY 2020 schedule for PhilHealth contributions and 
remittances along with supporting documents delayed the timely audit of the 
Due to PhilHealth account.  
 

18.1 Section 28, Article VII of RA No. 7875, National Health Insurance Act of 
1996, states that:  
 

Section. 28. Contributions. – All members of the Program shall 

contribute to the Fund, in accordance with a reasonable, equitable 



105 

 

and progressive contribution schedule to be determined by the 

Corporation on the basis of applicable actuarial studies and in 

accordance with the following guidelines. 

 

a) Formal sector employees and current Medicare members and 

their employers shall continue paying the same monthly 

contributions as provided for by law until such time that the 

Corporation shall have determined the contribution schedule 

mentioned herein: Provided, that their monthly contributions shall 

not exceed three percent (3%) of their respective monthly salaries. 
 

18.2 PhilHealth Circular No. 2019-009 which was published on November 23, 
2019 provides the new premium contribution schedule effective December 
7, 2019. It states that the new PhilHealth contribution rate for employees for 
the year 2020 is 3.00% of the monthly basic salary, with a salary floor of 
₱10,000 and a ceiling of ₱60,000. The premium contribution shall be 
equally shared by the employee and the employer. 
 

18.3 Despite the Audit Team’s verbal and written requests to all Campuses, their 
respective Accountants failed to submit the required FY 2020 schedule for 
PhilHealth contributions and remittances along with supporting documents 
to COA as of date. Hence, delaying timely audit of the withheld and 
remitted premiums of the Due to PhilHealth Account. 
 

18.4 We recommended and the Management of the concerned Campuses 
agreed to require their respective Accountants to submit to the Audit 
Team the duly accomplished schedule for PhilHealth contributions 
remittances along with supporting documents to facilitate audit thereof. 

 

 

Compliance with Section 32 of the RA No. 11465 (GAA for FY 2020) for Programs and 

Projects Related to Senior Citizens and Persons with Disability 

  
19. The Campuses failed to integrate in their regular activities at least one percent 

of their budget for plans/programs/projects that will address the concerns of 
senior citizens and differently-abled persons as required under Section 32 of 
the General Provisions of RA No. 11465 (GAA for FY 2020).  
 
19.1. Section 32 of the General Provisions of RA No. 11465 (GAA for FY 2020) 

states that: 
 

“All agencies of the government shall formulate plans, programs and 

projects intended to address the concerns of senior citizens and 

persons with disability, insofar as it relates to their mandated 

functions, and integrate the same in their regular activities. Moreover, 

all government infrastructures and facilities shall provide 



106 

 

architectural or structural features, designs or facilities that will 

reasonably enhance the mobility, safety and welfare of persons with 

disability pursuant to Batas Pambansa Blg. 344 and R.A. No. 7277”. 
 
19.2. We recommended the Management of the Campuses to integrate in 

their regular activities at least one percent of their budget for 
plans/programs/projects that will address the concerns of senior 
citizens and differently-abled persons as required under Section 32 of 
the General Provisions of RA No. 11465 (GAA for FY 2020). 
 
 

Status of Settlements of Audit Suspensions and Disallowance  

 
20. Audit Suspensions and Audit Disallowances amounting to ₱51,367,829.26, and 

₱1,792,123.85 respectively, remained unsettled as of December 31, 2020, 
contrary to COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009, on the 
settlement of government accounts.  

 
20.1 COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009 prescribes the use of the 

2009 Rules and Regulations on the Settlement of Accounts. It provides among 
others, that the Auditor shall issue a Notice of Disallowance/Notice of Charge for 
differences/balances resulting from the audit of accounts. A Notice of Suspension 
may be issued pending compliance with various requirements for transactions 
which may result in pecuniary loss to the government.  

 
20.2 As of December 31, 2020, the MSU System has remaining unsettled balances of 

Notice of Suspensions (NSs) and Notice of Disallowances (NDs) totalling    
₱51,367,829.26 and ₱1,792,123.85, respectively, with breakdown as follows:

requirements of transactions suspended in audit are complied with and that 
the liability arising from the disallowances/charges be enforced against those 
liable persons and approving/certifying officials who are still with the Agency. 
In case of refusal/failure to settle the obligations, legal proceedings may be 
undertaken pursuant to Section 35 of PD No. 1445.

1. Several deficiencies were 
noted in the 

implementation of the 

Tertiary Education 

Subsidy program, to wit: 

(a) non-utilization of the 

budget allocated amount 

of ₱6,460,000.00 for 

Academic Year (AY) 

2018-2019; (b) utilization 

of funds for the payment 

of honorarium of 

personnel amounting to 

₱1,118,000.00; (c) lack of 

documentary requirements 

in the disbursement 

vouchers of honoraria and 

training expenses totaling 

₱1,646,000.00; and (d) 

other deficiencies 

observed with respect to 

the responsibilities of the 

University, thus the 

efficient implementation 

of  

the scholarship program 

was not attained which 

deprived its qualified 

beneficiaries of the 

immediate use of the 

funds for their educational 

needs and affecting its 

compliance with the 

pertinent laws and 

regulations provided 

under UniFAST 

Memorandum Circular 

No. 2018-004, tripartite 

Memorandum of 

Agreement signed on June 

13, 2018 by and between 

CHED, UniFAST and the 

MSU System, COA 

We recommended the 

Management to:  

 

1. Maximize the use of the 
appropriated budget and 

utilize the same to fully 

implement the scholarship 

program through 

substituting/replacing the 

232 (91 unpaid + 141 

partially paid) student-

beneficiaries for A.Y. 2018-

2019 who already graduated, 

or are receiving other forms 

of government allowances; 

 

2. Refund the excess 
administrative cost of 

₱273,107.00 and ensure that 

the expenses incurred for 

administrative costs do not 

exceed the 3% allowed 

amount by the UniFAST; 

 

3. Refrain from giving 
honorarium to their 

personnel involved in the 

implementation of the TES 

program; 

 

4. Submit the documentary 
requirements to support the 

payment of the honoraria of 

TES Committee Members 

amounting to ₱1,118,000.00 

and the training expenses 

paid to the members of

accounting and reporting 

system starting from the 

determination of an 

accounting transaction, 

recording of the 

transactions, posting the 

transactions to the journals, 

registries, subsidiary and 

general journals, preparation 

of trial balance to the
