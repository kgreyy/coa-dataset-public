EXECUTIVE SUMMARY



A)	Introduction



The Davao Oriental State College of Science and Technology (DOSCST) was created on December 13, 1989 by virtue of Republic Act 6807 in response to the need for quality education in the province.  It was a conversion of the old Mati Community College (MCC) founded in 1972 by then Mayor Thelma Z. Almario, who eventually became congresswoman and authored the law creating the DOSCST. Its mandate is to provide academic programs in science and technology, agriculture, engineering, teacher education, technical education and other areas as may be instituted on the basis of national, regional and local development goals.



DOSCST with extension campuses located in the Municipalities of San Isidro, Cateel and Banaybanay, all in the Province of Davao Oriental offers curricular programs for undergraduate & graduate studies. Degree programs include education and teacher training, aquatic and life science, business and public administration, and computing and engineering. Graduate school programs include Master of Science in Teaching major in Mathematics and General Science and Master of Arts in Education major in Educational Management & Teaching English. The main campus is located in Guang-guang, Dahican, City of Mati, Davao Oriental.



The College’s main thrust is stated in the College vision as “A University of Innovation, Excellence and Inclusion”



On May 28, 2018, President Rodrigo R. Duterte signed into law, Republic Act No. 11033, converting Davao Oriental State College of Science and Technology into Davao Oriental State University.  At present, DOSCST is preparing for its transition into becoming a state university. 



B)	Audit Methodology



The Commission has been implementing risk-based audit in the conduct of its audit services. However, to meet the evolving developments in public governance and fund management, the results-based approach in audit was incorporated. The integration of these two approaches, called the Integrated Results and Risk-Based Audit (IRRBA) Methodology, was applied in the audit of the accounts and operations of the DOSCST.



C)	Scope of Audit



The audit covered the review of accounts and operations of the Davao Oriental State College of Science and Technology for CY 2020.  The audit was aimed to ascertain the propriety of the disbursements, the adequacy of recording of the transactions in the books of accounts and the fairness and reliability of the financial reports.  Transactions of the agencies were also examined to determine whether existing laws, rules and regulations were complied with.
