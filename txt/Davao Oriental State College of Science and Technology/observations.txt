	As shown above, Year-end Financial Statements/Reports were not submitted as at February 15, 2021. As discussed during the entrance conference, Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with IPSAS. Moreover, one of the audit objectives of the Audit Team is to express an opinion on whether the financial statements are fairly presented, in all material respects, in accordance with International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS). Failure to submit such FSs constitutes scope limitation and affects the audit opinion to be expressed by the Auditor. 



	Also, review of the monthly and quarterly financial reports revealed that supporting schedules were not submitted, hence monthly/quarterly confirmation of balances to debtors/creditors/payees/payers cannot be performed. To date, only the supporting schedules for Cluster 1 December 2020 balances were partially submitted.



Further, it can be gleaned above that ALL Monthly Trial Balance Reports were submitted late, way beyond the prescribed date, thus timely audit cannot be performed and it impedes the Audit Team’s mandate to obtain a reasonable basis to attest to management’s accountability on government resources which were entrusted to its care. 



Although it is understandable that the country is under a state of national emergency arising from Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), which limits the number of workforce in the office, there is no directive extending the deadlines on submission of financial reports. Hence, February 14, 2021 is still the legal deadline.



Recommendations:



In view of the foregoing, we recommended that Management:



1)	Submit the CY 2020 consolidated year-end financial statements/reports and supporting schedules;



2)	Submit the lacking Trial Balances, Quarterly Financial Reports and their supporting schedules; 



3)	Observe timely submission of monthly, quarterly and year-end financial statements/reports and supporting schedules as prescribed by GAM for NGAs per COA Circular 2015-007; and



4)	Continue to identify and install various mechanisms that would address the issue.



Management’s Comment:



	The Accounting Unit submitted the Financial Statements in piecemeal, as follows:

	The Accounting Unit explained that they were challenged to meet the deadlines because of series of Work-From-Home pronouncements and departmental lockdown declarations due to possible exposure to a COVID19 victim, and some computer system glitches on the third week of February 2021.



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



	The Management and the Accounting Personnel, in particular, failed to strategize and perform alternative procedures/techniques that would assist them in completing the Financial Statements even on a Work from Home scheme, such as on-line access of the eNGAS. There were also numerous reportorial backlogs, especially in Cluster 5, that were only addressed and completed in January and early February of 2021. Had the transactions been recorded on time, the months following the year-end could have been allotted on the recording of adjustments so that the Office will not be bombarded with workloads, and could complete the Financial Statements before February 14, 2021. 



	The Audit Team conducted the exit conference on February 24, 2021, the same date that the Notes to Financial Statements were electronically submitted, hence impeded the Audit Team from reviewing the fair presentation and sufficient disclosures of the accounts in the financial statements. Also, the condition hampered the Audit Team from cross-footing the amounts presented in the Statements of Financial Position, Performance, Cash Flows, Changes in Equity and Comparison of Budget and Actual Amounts, to the Notes to the Financial Statements. A clear scope limitation, as the Financial Statements were prepared and completed earlier than the prescribed deadline.





Non-submission of 396 Paid Disbursement Vouchers on/before February 14, 2021



2)	The Accountant did not observe the timely and proper submission of 396 paid disbursement vouchers and all their supporting documents totaling to P60,120,929.51 as prescribed in Section 59(20), Chapter 19, Government Accounting Manual (GAM) Volume I, and Section 122(1) of P.D. No. 1445, thus raising doubts on the regularity, propriety and legality of the related transactions of the Agency as at year-end. 



Section 59(20), Chapter 19, Volume I, GAM states that the frequency of submission of Yearend Pre-Closing Trial Balance/Post-Closing Trial Balance and other reports – on or before February 14 of the following year to the COA Resident Auditor, DBM and Government Accountancy Sector, COA. (emphasis ours)



Section 122 of P.D. No. 1445 states that whenever deemed necessary in the exigencies of the service, the Commission may under regulations issued by it require the agency heads, chief accountants, budget officers, cashiers, disbursing officers, administrative or personnel officers, and other responsible officials of the various agencies to submit trial balances, physical inventory reports, current plantilla of personnel, and such other reports as may be necessary for the exercise of its functions. “Failure on the part of the officials concerned to submit the documents and reports mentioned herein shall automatically cause the suspension of payment of their salaries until they shall have complied with the requirements of the Commission.”



Review of the transactions for the calendar year 2020 revealed that as at February 15, 2021, 396 paid disbursement vouchers and all their supporting documents were not submitted to the Office of the Auditor for post-audit and safekeeping, these are summarized per cluster (Please refer to Annex A), viz:



Cluster

No. of Unsubmitted Paid 

Disbursement Vouchers

Amount

123

43,385,350.00

07

107

5,596,863.44

Total

396

60,120,929.51



The non-submission of these documents precludes the Auditor from performing timely audit and verification of the accounts which resulted in the non-determination of the regularity, propriety and legality of the related transactions. Further, failure to submit such paid disbursement vouchers constitutes scope limitation and affects the audit opinion to be expressed by the Auditor.



In view of this and in pursuance with PD 1445 on suspending the salaries of the officials concerned for failure to submit the documents and reports, the issuance of a Notice of Suspension is in order. 



Recommendations:



We recommended that Management:



1)	Direct the Accountant to immediately submit the 396 paid disbursement vouchers and their supporting documents; and

 

2)	Comply with the requirements set forth under Section 59(20), Chapter 19, Volume I, GAM and Section 122(1) of P.D. No. 1445 in the submission of financial records in order to have a reliable basis in the verification and analysis of the financial transactions of the agency.



Management’s Comment:



	During the exit conference, the Accountant admitted the observation and updated the Audit Team that portion of the 396 Paid Disbursement Vouchers were submitted after the prescribed deadline.



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



The Audit Team reiterated that aside from the custodial function, COA is mandated to examine, audit, and settle all accounts pertaining to the revenue and receipts of, and expenditures or uses of funds and property, owned or held in trust by, or pertaining to, the Government, or any of its subdivisions, agencies, or instrumentalities. The late and non-submission of the Paid Disbursement Vouchers preclude the Audit Team from performing timely audit and verification of the accounts which resulted in the non-determination of the regularity, propriety and legality of the related transactions, thus constitutes scope limitations.





Unreported Collections



3)	Contrary to Paragraph 27 of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) 1 – Presentation of Financial Statement, 429 issued official receipts (ORs) with an aggregate amount of P264,324.00 were unreported since March 2019 resulting in an understatement of Cash-Collecting Officer account of the said amount, Other Payables by P258,434.00, School Fees by P3,100.00 and Accumulated Surplus/Deficit by P3,000.00 as at December 31, 2019.



	Section 27 of the IPSAS 1- Presentation of Financial Statements provides that:



Financial statements shall present fairly the financial position, financial performance, and cash flow of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of the transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses set out in IPSASs. The application of IPSASs, with additional disclosures when necessary, is presumed to result in financial statements that achieve a fair presentation. (Emphasis supplied)



	Section 16 of the IPSAS 29-Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement prescribes that:



An entity shall recognize a financial asset or a financial liability in its statement of financial position when, and only when, the entity becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.



	Further, Application Guidance (AG) 10 of the IPSAS 28-Financial Instruments: Presentation states that:



AG10. Currency (cash) is a financial asset because it represents the medium of exchange and is therefore the basis on which all transactions are measured and recognized in financial statements. A deposit of cash with a bank or similar financial institution is a financial asset because it represents the contractual right of the depositor to obtain cash from the institution or to draw a check or similar instrument against the balance in favor of a creditor in payment of a financial liability.



Likewise, sections 46, 47 and 54 of IPSAS 3- Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors describes that:



Errors



46. Errors can arise in respect of the recognition, measurement, presentation, or disclosure of elements of financial statements. Financial statements do not comply with IPSASs if they contain either material errors, or immaterial errors made intentionally to achieve a particular presentation of an entity’s financial position, financial performance, or cash flows. Potential current period errors discovered in that period are corrected before the financial statements are authorized for issue. However, material errors are sometimes not discovered until a subsequent period, and these prior period errors are corrected in the comparative information presented in the financial statements for that subsequent period.



47. Subject to paragraph 48, an entity shall correct material prior period errors retrospectively in the first set of financial statements authorized for issue after their discovery by:



a)	Restating the comparative amounts for prior period(s) presented in which the error occurred; or

b)	If the error occurred before the earliest prior period presented, restating the opening balances of assets, liabilities and net assets/equity for the earliest prior period presented.



Limitations of Retrospective Restatement



48. A prior period error shall be corrected by retrospective restatement, except to the extent that it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the error.



49. When it is impracticable to determine the period-specific effects of an error on comparative information for one or more prior periods presented, the entity shall restate the opening balances of assets, liabilities, and net assets/equity for the earliest period for which retrospective restatement is practicable (which may be the current period).



50. When it is impracticable to determine the cumulative effect, at the beginning of the current period, of an error on all prior periods, the entity shall restate the comparative information to correct the error prospectively from the earliest date practicable.



Disclosure of Prior Period Errors



54. In applying paragraph 47, an entity shall disclose the following:



a)	The nature of the prior period error;

b)	For each prior period presented, to the extent practicable, the amount of the correction for each financial statement line item affected;

c)	The amount of the correction at the beginning of the earliest prior period presented; and

d)	If retrospective restatement is impracticable for a particular prior period, the circumstances that led to the existence of that condition and a description of how and from when the error has been corrected.



The Audit Team issued AOM No. 2020-018-(19) dated December 07, 2020 narrating that on November 18, 2020, the Audit Team conducted a count on the cash and accounts, and accountable forms under the accountability of the current Banaybanay Extension Campus (BEC) Coordinator, Mr. Felix U. Sansaet, Jr, who was designated as Collecting/ Special Disbursing Officer and Petty Cash Custodian since January 22, 2020 without proper turn-over and that the Office of the Auditor was not also informed about the redesignation. During the inspection, it was found out that 429 ORs presented as unused per Report of Accountability for Accountable Forms (RAAF) as of October 2020 were actually used/issued on March 7-10, 2019 during the time of the previous BEC Coordinator/Collecting/ Special Disbursing Officer and Petty Cash Custodian, Dr. Edna B. Bagcal. In her letter received by the Audit Team on December 4, 2020, Dr. Bagcal expressed that she was not aware about the collections because it was Ms. Chandie B. Romero, Cashiering Aide and a Job Order Personnel, who actually received the collections and issued the corresponding ORs in her behalf, but did not report the transactions. Dr. Bagcal confronted Ms. Romero and the latter confirmed the condition and acknowledged that it was her fault. Ms. Romero submitted her duly notarized explanation stating that the collections pertained to miscellaneous fees particularly for physical facilities and improvements received from various students. The campus was instructed not to collect the said miscellaneous fee anymore since the CHED, with the implementation of the Free Higher Education, already paid the fee. Ms. Romero accordingly believed that the collections were unauthorized, just kept the collections and waited for the COA Auditor to visit the campus to ask for some advice.



Scrutiny of the aforementioned ORs revealed that these were actually undated, Ms. Romero just mentioned that the actual collections were made some time March 7-10, 2020. Ms. Romero summarized the ORs dated as follows:



No. of Official Receipts

OR Series

Date

135

329072 - 329206

March 7, 2019

105

329207 - 329311

March 8, 2019

120

329312 - 329431

March 9, 2019

69

329432 - 329450

329501 - 329550

March 10, 2019



	Per Report of Collections and Deposits (RCD) last March 2019, the last OR reported on March 7, 2019 was 329071, consistent to the first OR series shown above, but doubtful for March 9, 2019 and March 10, 2019 as these were Saturday and Sunday. Also, 56 of the 429 ORs were collections for “completion” and not for miscellaneous fee-physical facilities and improvements, and one OR was issued for the collection of a student’s previous balance, inconsistent again of Ms. Romero’s claim that the collections pertain to miscellaneous fee-physical facilities and improvements. Further, if Ms. Romero believed that the collections were unauthorized, she should have still reported and deposited the collections as these will just be refunded to the respective students.



	During the actual cash count, Ms. Romero presented a cash totaling P258,365.00 with no corresponding Report of Collection, hence the accuracy of the amount presented by her could not be readily validated. The Audit Team demanded that the cash be deposited immediately which Ms. Romero did the next banking day. Upon verification of the duplicate copies of the ORs, it was found out that the total amount should have been P264,534.00, hence short of P6,169.00. The Audit Team immediately demanded the production of the variance and directed the immediate deposit of the amount. Thus, the total amount of P264,534.00 was already deposited to DOSCST-BEC DBP account on November 20, 2020.



The unreported collections are broken-down as follow:



Accounts

Amounts

School Fees

3,100.00

Other Payables 

258,434.00

Accumulated Surplus/Deficit

3,000.00

Total

264,534.00



Due to the conditions described above the accounts Cash-Collecting Officer, School Fees, Other Payables, Accumulated Surplus/Deficits and Cash in Bank-Local Currency Current Account are understated. Hence, below are the proposed adjusting journal entries.



Cash-Collecting Officer    				 264,534.00

	School Fees				    		    3,100.00

	Other Payables					258,434.00

	Accumulated Surplus/Deficit		   		    3,000.00

>To record the collection. (Restated CY 2019 FS)

	

	Cash in Bank- Local Currency Current Account	264,534.00

		Cash-Collecting Officer     			264,534.00

	>To record the deposit.



Recommendations:



In view of the foregoing, we recommended that Management:



1)	Instruct the Accountant to draw the following adjusting journal entries:



Cash-Collecting Officer    				 264,534.00

	School Fees				    		    3,100.00

	Other Payables					258,434.00

	Accumulated Surplus/Deficit		   		    3,000.00

>To record the collection. (Restated CY 2019 FS)

	

	Cash in Bank- Local Currency Current Account	264,534.00

		Cash-Collecting Officer     			264,534.00

	>To record the deposit.



2)	Restate the FY 2019 Financial Statements, as practicable.



Management’s Comment:



	During the exit conference, the Accountant affirmed the observation and informed the Audit Team that collections and the corresponding deposits were already recorded in the books of the Agency.



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



	Proposed adjustments were already recorded but the effect of the error was not properly presented in the Comparative Financial Statements, as the prior year’s affected accounts were not amended. 





Non-submission of All Bank Reconciliation Statements on/before February 14, 2021	



4)	Despite prior year’s recommendations, timely submission of Monthly Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS) with complete supporting documents was not observed, contrary to Section 74 of PD 1445 and Chapter 21 of GAM, thus casting doubt on the accuracy and completeness of the cash transactions and cash in bank balances with an aggregate amount of P51,306,554.71 as at December 31, 2020.



Section 74 of P.D. 1445, the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines states:



Monthly reports of depositories to agency head. At the close of each month, depositories shall report to the agency head, in such from as he may direct, the condition of the agency account standing on their books. The head of the agency shall see to it that reconciliation is made between the balance shown in the reports and the balance found in the books of the agency. (Underscoring supplied)



In addition, Chapter 21 of Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies, Volume I set the general guidelines on the preparation and submission of the Bank Reconciliation Statement, to wit:



Section 5. The Chief Accountant/Designated Staff shall within ten days from receipt of the monthly Bank Statement (BS) together with the paid checks, original copies of Debit Memoranda (DM)/Credit Memoranda (CM) from the GSB, reconcile the BS with the GL and prepare the BRS in four copies.”



Section 6. The Chief Accountant shall submit the BRS within twenty days after receipt of the monthly BS to the following:



Original – COA Auditor (with all the supporting documents 

                  and JEVs)

Copy 2 – Head of Agency/Entity

Copy 3 – Accounting Division/Unit file

Copy 4 – Bank, if necessary



    Further, National Guidelines on Internal Control Systems, as circularized in DBM Circular Letter No. 2008-8 dated October 23, 2008, specifically listing reconciliation of financial and non-financial data among the most common control policies and procedures that are part of the coordinated measures and procedures that every office should have: “Operating procedures of every office require that the cash records of the Accounting and Cash units should be regularly reconciled. The records of the depository banks pertaining to the cash accounts of the agency should be reconciled with the records of the Accounting and Cash units. This process will detect errors or fraud either by the bank, the Accounting unit or the Cash unit” (underscoring ours)

	As displayed above, ALL BRS were not submitted on time or worst, there were no submission at all, thus failing to immediately record the related book reconciling items. 



	One of the causes on the late preparation and submission of BRS is the late submission and preparation of Trial Balance and General Ledger, since the BRS can only be prepared when the TBs and GLs are already available. The condition precluded the Audit Team from timely ascertaining the accuracy and completeness of the cash transactions as the balances of the Cash in Bank-LCCA and Cash- MDS accounts could not be readily established and ascertained.



To emphasize, timely preparation of the bank reconciliation statements should reduce the risk of undetected errors on the agency and/or bank records. Without effective accounting control, general ledger accounts may be inaccurate or incomplete, funds may not be properly accounted for, and cash balances may not be reliable. Monthly bank reconciliation is an important internal control measure for detecting fraudulent transactions.



Although it is understandable that the country is under a state of national emergency arising from Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), which limits the number of workforce in the office, there is no directive extending the deadlines on submission of bank reconciliation statements. Hence, prescribed deadlines are still the legal deadline.



Recommendations:



We recommended that Management:



1)	Require the Head, Accounting Unit to immediately submit the  remaining BRS with complete supporting documents; and



2)	Strictly observe the timely preparation and submission of BRS pursuant to the provisions of Section 74 of PD 1445 and the GAM.



Management’s Comment:



	During the exit conference, the Accountant affirmed the observation and informed the Audit Team that some of the Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS) were submitted on the 3rd week of February except on the remaining BRS of the Account Number 5-5700-940-8 that were still not submitted as of February 26, 2021.



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



	The Audit Team emphasized that preparation of the Bank Reconciliation Statements were indispensable procedure to ascertain the accuracy of the Cash in Bank balance as at year-end, non-submission of which hampered the Audit Team in establishing the same.





Unbooked Cash in Bank Reconciling Items 	



5)	Despite prior year’s recommendation, the non-recognition of book reconciling items per Bank Reconciliation Statements of the Four Bank Accounts contravened the applicable provisions of the GAM and the Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standards, hence resulting in the total net misstatement by P31,062,807.17 of the Cash in Bank-Local Currency, Current Account as at year-end.



	Section 4, Chapter 21 of the Government Accounting Manual for National Government Agencies provides that:



Method of Bank Reconciliation. The monthly Bank Reconciliation Statement (BRS) shall be prepared by the Chief Accountant/designated staff for each of the bank accounts maintained by the agency/entity using the Adjusted Balance Method. Under this method, the book balance and the bank balance are brought to an adjusted cash balance that must appear on the Statement of Financial Position. (Underscoring ours)



	Likewise, procedures for the preparation of the Bank Reconciliation Statement for Authorized Government Depository Bank accounts require that a Journal Entry Voucher (JEV) shall be prepared to record the necessary adjustments affecting balance per books.



	Furthermore, Section 27 of the Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standards (PPSAS) Volume 1 provides that: “Financial statements shall present fairly the financial position, financial performance, and cash flow of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of the transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses set out in IPSASs.”



	Verification of the December Bank Reconciliation Statements revealed that ALL book reconciling items were not recorded in the books of account as at December 31, 2020 by the Accountant. Details are summarized below: (Please refer to Annex B)

	The Accounting Unit did not regularly prepare and submit the required Bank Reconciliation Statement to the COA Office and book reconciling items were not immediately provided with necessary journal entries to effect the adjustment. Thus, the accuracy of the balance of Cash in Bank-Local Currency, Current Account is understated by P31,062,807.17.

	

Recommendations:



	We recommended that Management:



1)	Direct the Accountant to journalize the necessary adjustments that affect the book balance’ Cash in Bank accounts; and



2)	Require explanation/justification on why the Accountant did not record/adjust the reconciling items of the four Cash in Bank accounts as at December 31, 2020.



Management’s Comment:

	

	The Accounting Unit agreed with the observation and promised to immediately record the Cash in Bank Reconciling Items on January 2021 reports.



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



	Failure of the Accounting Unit to record the Cash in Bank Reconciling Items misstated the account by P31,062,807.17 as at year-end. Hence, affected the fair presentation of the account in the Financial Statements.





Unreliable and Unverifiable Receivable Account Balances



6)	Unreliable Subsidiary Ledgers, negative and long outstanding balances caused difficulty in ascertaining the accuracy and valuation of the Loans and Receivables, Inter-Agency Receivables and Other Receivable accounts totaling to P51,584,913.06 as at December 31, 2020, contrary to Sections 111 and 121 of PD 1445 and Sec. 15, Chapter II, Volume I of the GAM.



	Sections 111 and 121 of the P.D. 1445, otherwise known as the State Audit Code of the Philippines provide that:



Section 111. Keeping of accounts.



1)		The accounts of an agency shall be kept in such detail as is necessary to meet the needs of the agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or control agencies of the government. 

	

2)		The highest standards of honesty, objectivity and consistency shall be observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate or misleading information.

	

	Section 121. Financial reports and statements.

	

1)		The financial reports prepared by the agencies shall comply with the specific requirements of applicable laws and regulations as to nature, accounting basic, content, frequency, and distribution as well as with all applicable restrictions pertaining to information that is classified for national security purposes.

	

2)		The financial statements shall be based on official accounting records kept in accordance with law and the generally accepted accounting principles and standards.



Sec. 15. Fair Presentation, Chapter 2, Volume I of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) of COA Circular No. 2015-007 dated October 22, 2015, states that:



The FSs shall present fairly the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in IPSAS. The application of IPSAS, with appropriate disclosures, if necessary, would result in fair presentation of the FS.



The Accounting Unit did not submit detailed schedules of the Loans and Receivables, Inter-Agency Receivables and Other Receivable Accounts as at December 31, 2020, hence the Audit Team performed alternative procedures by directly exporting copies of the Subsidiary Ledgers (SLs) from the e-NGAS. However, review of the SLs revealed that several transactions relative to the aforementioned Receivable accounts were posted in the name of the College’s various bank account numbers, instead of the particular officers/employees/creditors. Also, several SLs had negative balances (highlighted in red), were long outstanding and non-moving, and some were not accounted accordingly, viz:

The conditions on improper posting of the Receivable related transactions that resulted in their negative balances, inaccurate SLs, long outstanding, non-moving and unaccounted Receivable account balances and inaccurate Schedules of the Receivable accounts, limit the Audit Team from performing confirmation of balances to all officers/employees/debtors, hence accuracy and valuation of the Receivable account balances in the total amount of P51,584,913.06, except intra-agency receivables, cannot be confirmed and relied upon.



Recommendations:



In view of the foregoing, we recommended that Management:



1)	Explain in writing what caused the improper posting of the Receivable related transactions that resulted in negative balances and inaccurate SLs; 



2)	Explain in writing what caused the long outstanding, non-moving and unaccounted Receivable account balances; 



3)	Repost the existing Receivables’ Subsidiary Ledgers to the appropriate officer/employee/debtor accounts for proper reporting; 



4)	Submit a detailed and corrected Schedules of the Receivable Accounts as at December 31, 2020; and



5)	Direct the Accountant to closely monitor the proper posting of transactions to the appropriate ledgers.





Management’s Comment:

	

	The Management affirmed the observation that several Receivable ledger balances were unaccounted, non-moving and long outstanding, and ended with negative amounts. The Accounting Unit committed to prioritize the tracing of the improper posting in the Subsidiary Ledgers and effect the necessary adjustments.

	

Auditor’s Rejoinder:



	The Audit Team stressed that the Failure of the Accounting Unit to provide a reliable and verifiable ledger balances of the Receivable accounts hampered them in sending confirmation letters to the officers/employees/debtors to ascertain the accuracy of the Receivable year-end balance of P51,584,913.06, except intra-agency receivables. Hence, the scope limitation.





Failure to conduct Physical Counting of Inventories



7)	Despite the prior year’s recommendations, the College failed to submit the Report of Physical Count of Inventories and Schedule of Inventories as at December 31, 2019 contrary to Sections 111 and 121 of PD 1445 and Sec. 15, Chapter II, Volume I of the GAM, hence casting doubt on the existence and completeness of the Inventory accounts’ balance of P38,026,981.70 as this could not be relied upon.



Sections 111 and 121 of the P.D. 1445, otherwise known as the State Audit Code of the Philippines provide that:



Section 111. Keeping of accounts.



1)		The accounts of an agency shall be kept in such detail as is necessary to meet the needs of the agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or control agencies of the government. 

	

2)		The highest standards of honesty, objectivity and consistency shall be observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate or misleading information.

	

	Section 121. Financial reports and statements.

	

3)		The financial reports prepared by the agencies shall comply with the specific requirements of applicable laws and regulations as to nature, accounting basic, content, frequency, and distribution as well as with all applicable restrictions pertaining to information that is classified for national security purposes.

	

4)		The financial statements shall be based on official accounting records kept in accordance with law and the generally accepted accounting principles and standards.



Likewise, Sec. 15. Fair Presentation, of Government Accounting Manual (GAM) Volume I under COA Circular No. 2015-007 dated October 22, 2015, provides that:



The FSs shall present fairly the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in PPSAS. The application of PPSAS, with appropriate disclosures, if necessary, would result in fair presentation of the FS.



		Further, Appendix 66 of the Government Accounting Manual instructs the preparation of the Report of Physical Count of Inventories and states that:

	

	The RPCI is a form used to report the physical count of inventory items by type such as Office Supplies Inventory; Accountable Forms Inventory; Medical, Dental and Laboratory Supplies Inventory; Food Supplies Inventory, etc. which are owned by the agency/entity. It shall be prepared semi-annually by the Inventory Committee and by fund cluster.



		Section 17 (i) Chapter 8 of the GAM also adds that “Report on the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) (Appendix 66) – shall be used to report the physical count of supplies by type of inventory as at a given date. It shows the balance of inventory items per card and per count and shortage/overage, if any. These include the semi-expendable property wherein the issue is covered by ICS”. Also, Section 13 emphasizes that “Physical count/inventory, which is required semi-annually, is an indispensable procedure for checking the integrity of property custodianship”.

	However,  both the Supply Officer and the Head, Accounting Office did not submit the Reports on the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) and the Schedule of Inventories, respectively. Hence, limiting/preventing the Audit Team from validating the existence and completeness of the P38,026,981.70 Inventory balance as at year-end.



The aforementioned observation was already communicated in previous year, yet not fully acted upon by the Supply and the Accounting Units. 



Recommendations:



In view of the foregoing, we recommended that Management:



1)	Explain in writing on why the Audit Recommendation on the submission of the Report on Physical Count of Inventories was not fully acted upon;



2)	Direct the Accountant to submit the Schedule of Inventories as at December 31, 2020;



3)	Direct the Supply Officer to conduct physical count of Inventories semi-annually and prepare the corresponding report duly reconciled with the accounting records to establish the correct value of Inventories in accordance with Appendix 66 and Section 13 Chapter 8 of the Government Accounting Manual; and 



4)	Enjoin the Accountant and the Supply Officer to reconcile the RCPI and the Schedule of Inventories as at December 31, 2020. 



Management’s Comment:



	The Accounting and the Supply Units affirmed the observation and committed to coordinate between themselves to reconcile the balances.



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



The Audit Team emphasized that physical counting is an indispensable procedure to ascertain the physical existence and condition of the inventories as at year-end. The Supply Office submitted a schedule of office supplies only on February 23, 2021 but amounted only to P317,896.45, as compared to the P38,026,981.70 Inventory balance in the Financial Statements. Due to the material amount, failure of the Accounting and Supply Units to provide a reconciled and reliable schedule hampered the Audit Team in ascertaining the accuracy and completeness of the Inventory balance as at year-end. Hence, the scope limitation.





Failure to conduct Physical Counting of Property, Plant and Equipment



8)	The existence of the PPE accounts with a total carrying amount of P877,251,868.73 as at December 31, 2020 could not be readily verified due to  unreliable Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) as submitted contrary to Section 38, Chapter 10 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), thus casting doubt on the reliability of the balances of PPE accounts in the financial statements.

 

	Volumes I and II of the GAM for National Government Agencies (NGAs) provide the following:



Chapter 10- Property, Plant and Equipment



	Sec. 38. Physical Count of PPE. The entity shall have a periodic physical count of PPE, which shall be done annually and presented on the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) (Appendix 71) as at December 31 of each year. This shall be submitted to the Auditor concerned not later than January 31 of the following year. Equipment found at station and losses discovered during the physical count shall be reported to the Accounting Division/Unit for proper accounting/recording. 



The following are the forms/reports necessary to account for PPE:



g. Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (Appendix 73) – this form shall be used to report the physical count and condition of PPE by type as at a given date, including those which are unrecorded and those which could not be accounted for. It shows the balance of PPE per property cards and per count and the shortage/overage, if any. It shall be rendered by the Inventory Committee, on its yearly physical count of properties owned by the entity.  



Appendix 71 Instructions-RPCPPE provides in part the following:



E. It shall be submitted to the Auditor concerned and Accounting Division/Unit not later than January 31 of each year. (Emphases ours)



Inquiry with the Chairperson of the Inventory Committee disclosed that they did not conduct the physical counting of PPE for CY 2020 due to the unavailability of the Accountable Officers caused by the pandemic (COVID 19), and conveyed that the latter just suggested to carry-over their accountabilities.



On February 3, 2021, the Committee submitted a Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) for CY 2020, yet the Chairperson already disclosed that they failed to conduct the prescribed physically counting, thus the submitted RCPPE was unreliable. The Chairperson explained that they just carried-over the CY 2019 RPCPPE balances plus the 2020 additions and deducted the returned items. The condition is contrary to the objective of the report since it did not validate the existence and conditions of the properties as at December 31, 2020. The Committee had the sufficient time and chances to conduct the physical counting due to minimal workforce and there were no students in the campuses, yet were not maximized. Also, despite prior year’s recommendations, the submitted RPCPPE still did not tally with the Accounting Records. 



On January 31, 2020, COA issued Circular No. 2020-006 Guidelines and Procedures in the Conduct of Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE), Recognition of PPE Items Found at Station, and Disposition for Non-existing/Missing PPE Items, for the One-Time Cleansing of PPE Account Balances of Government Agencies which directs that:



5.0 GENERAL GUIDELINES



5.1 Each government agency shall conduct physical count of all its PPE, whether acquired through purchase or donation, including those constructed by administration and found at station.



5.2 The Head of the Agency shall create an Inventory Committee composed of adequate number of members to be able to complete the physical inventory in three months or less. The Inventory Committee shall have at least one member each from the Accounting and Property Divisions/Units of the agency.



5.3 The members of the Inventory Committee shall be temporarily relieved of all their regular duties to devote their full time in the conduct of the physical inventory taking until the same is completed.



5.4 The entire inventory taking shall be witnessed by the Commission on Audit (COA) Auditor. The Audit Team Leader and/or any of his/her audit team members may be assigned for the purpose.



5.5 The Head of the Agency may also require a representative from the agency's Audit Service/Unit to witness the inventory taking.



5.6 Each government agency shall adopt a uniform property identification system for PPE wherein a unique Property Number shall be assigned for each PPE item, using the following numbering system:



----media/image1.png----



The codes for the PPE sub-major account group and General Ledger account correspond to those provided in the Revised Chart of Accounts prescribed under the Accounting Manuals of the respective Sectors (National, Local and Corporate).



Additional digits may be used for serial number and location/office, as necessary.



5.7 For easy identification, the Property Number shall be prominently shown in the property sticker, in addition to the following vital information on the PPE item:



a. Description of the property

b. Model Number

c. Serial Number

d. Acquisition Date/Cost

e. Person Accountable

f. Space for the validation/signature of the Inventory Committee



5.8 The Inventory Committee shall be responsible for the actual count to ascertain the existence, completeness and condition of all PPEs owned by the government agency.



5.9 In coordination with the Property Division/Unit, the Inventory Committee shall plan/strategize on how to conduct and complete the physical inventory within the prescribed period. It shall prepare a Physical Inventory Plan (PIP) containing, at the least, the specific assignments/duties of the Committee members, the cut-off date and a schedule specifying the dates and locations of the inventory taking activities from start up to the targeted completion of the physical inventory.



5.10 The PIP shall be approved by the Head of the Agency.



5.11 The Inventory Committee shall submit the approved PIP to the COA Audit Team at least ten (10) calendar days before the scheduled start of inventory activities.



5.12 Property records shall be updated based on the results of the physical inventory and reconciled with accounting records to come up with the reconciled balances of PPE accounts to be considered as the correct balance of the agency's PPEs.



Recommendations:



In view of the foregoing, we recommended that Management:



1)	Reconstitute the composition of the Inventory Committee with adequate number of members to be able to complete the physical inventory in three months or less; 



2)	Prepare a Physical Inventory Plan (PIP) and submit a copy of the duly approved PIP to the COA Audit Team at least ten (10) calendar days before the scheduled start of inventory activities; 



3)	Enjoin the Inventory Committee, the Property and the Accounting Units to be acquainted of their roles and responsibilities provided in Sections 5 to 9 of the COA Circular No. 2020-006 on the one-time cleansing of PPE account balances; and



4)	Submit a corrected copy of the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE).



Management’s Comment:



	During the exit conference, the Head of the Agency was informed that the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment were prepared and forwarded to his office for approval yet no actual physical counting was performed.



	The Management then proactively committed to reconstitute a dependable Inventory Committee, to implement the audit recommendations and to avail the one-time cleansing of PPE accounts.



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



	The Audit Team emphasized that physical counting is an indispensable procedure to ascertain the physical existence and condition of the PPE that would validate and/or measure the appropriate valuation of the properties as at year-end. Due to the material amount, failure of the Accounting and the Property Units to provide a reconciled and reliable schedule hampered the Audit Team in ascertaining the accuracy, completeness valuation of the PPE balance as at year-end. Hence, the scope limitation.





Unreconciled PPE Lapsing Schedule against the PPE Balances per FS



9)	Several PPE classes and their corresponding Accumulated Depreciation Accounts as shown in the Detailed Statement of Financial Position differ from the Lapsing Schedule with a net aggregate amount of (P7,925,588.39), contrary to Sections 111 and 121 of PD 1445 and Sec. 15, Chapter II, Volume I of the GAM,  thus casting doubt on the accuracy of the affected PPE account balances as at December 31, 2020.



	Section 111 and 121 of the P.D. 1445, otherwise known as the State Audit Code of the Philippines provide that:



Section 111. Keeping of accounts.



1)		The accounts of an agency shall be kept in such detail as is necessary to meet the needs of the agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or control agencies of the government. 

	

2)		The highest standards of honesty, objectivity and consistency shall be observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate or misleading information.

	

	Section 121. Financial reports and statements.

	

1)		The financial reports prepared by the agencies shall comply with the specific requirements of applicable laws and regulations as to nature, accounting basic, content, frequency, and distribution as well as with all applicable restrictions pertaining to information that is classified for national security purposes.

	

2)		The financial statements shall be based on official accounting records kept in accordance with law and the generally accepted accounting principles and standards.



Sec. 15. Fair Presentation, Chapter 2, Volume I of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) of COA Circular No. 2015-007 dated October 22, 2015, states that:



The FSs shall present fairly the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in IPSAS. The application of IPSAS, with appropriate disclosures, if necessary, would result in fair presentation of the FS.

	As presented above, the PPE account balances were not supported with accurate and duly reconciled schedules, hence cannot be relied upon. Moreover, several PPE accounts in Cluster 5 were not identified as to specific item, thus cannot be readily verified.



	Unreliable Accounting Records will cause difficulty in reconciling with the Property Records in relation to the one-time cleansing of PPE account balances. Also, it caused difficulty in ascertaining and in re-computing the accuracy of the recorded Depreciation Expenses for the year.



	Lastly, aside from the undocumented existence and conditions of the properties as communicated in AOM No. 2021-016 (20), the undependable PPE Lapsing Schedules affected the fair presentation of the Property Plant and Equipment Accounts with a Net Carrying Value of P877,251,868.73 as at December 31, 2020.



Recommendations:



In view of the foregoing, we recommended that Management:



1)	Direct the Bookkeepers to immediately reconcile the PPE Lapsing Schedules with the PPE account balances; and



2)	Direct the Accountant to closely monitor the reconciliation to be performed by the Bookkeepers



Management’s Comment:



The Accounting Unit confirmed the discrepancies and committed to trace the accounts in the respective Subsidiary Ledgers.



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



	The Audit Team accentuated that the unreliable PPE Lapsing Schedule of the Accounting Unit as at December 31, 2021 hampered them in ascertaining the breakdown of the PPE balance per Accounting Records and in re-computing the Depreciation Expenses recognized during the year. Hence, the scope limitation.





Unverified Recognition of Biological Assets



10)	Assistance from the Municipality of San Isidro of ten (10) farm animals with an acquisition cost of P60,000.00 for research purposes were not reported by the farm-in-charge and unrecorded in the College’s book of accounts, thus resulting in the understatement of the Biological Asset and Assistance from Local Government Units’ Accounts of the same amount as at December 31, 2020.



Paragraphs 13, 14, 16 and 17 of IPSAS 27 Agriculture, prescribing the accounting treatment and disclosures for agricultural activity provide that:



13. An entity shall recognize a biological asset or agricultural produce when and only when:

(a) The entity controls the asset as a result of past events;

(b) It is probable that future economic benefits or service potential associated with the asset will flow to the entity; and

(c) The fair value or cost of the asset can be measured reliably. 



	14. The fair value of an asset is based on its present location and condition. As a result, for example, the fair value of cattle at a farm is the price for the cattle in the relevant market less the transport and other costs of getting the cattle either to that market or to the location where it will be distributed at no charge or for a nominal charge.

	

16. A biological asset shall be measured on initial recognition and at each reporting date at its fair value less costs to sell, xxx.



17. Where an entity acquires a biological asset through a non-exchange transaction, the biological asset is measured on initial recognition and at each reporting date in accordance with paragraph 16. (emphasis provided)



	COA Circular 2020-001 dated January 08, 2020, otherwise known as Prescribing Volume III- Revised Chart of Accounts (Updated 2019) to replace Volume III- The Revised Chart of Accounts (Updated 2015) of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs) define the following, viz:



Account Title		Breeding Stocks

Account Code		10701010

Normal Balance	Debit

Description 	This account is debited to recognize the fair value less cost to sell, or the cost, if the fair value cannot be measured reliably, of breeding stocks when they relate to agricultural activity. It includes cattle, horse, swine, and other animals that produced offsprings. It also includes offsprings intended for breeding, and those intended for sale/distribution/consumption at the point of harvest. This account is credited upon sale, transfers, loss, death, and/or adjustments.



Account Title		Livestock

Account Code		10701020

Normal Balance	Debit

Description	This account is debited to recognize the fair value less cost to sell, or the cost, if the fair value cannot be measured reliably, of livestock when they relate to agricultural activity. It includes carabao, cow, goat, chicken, sheep and other animals that produced milk, eggs, wools, and the like. This account is credited upon sale, transfers, loss, and/or adjustments.



Account Title		Assistance from Local Government Units

Account Code		40301030 

Normal Balance	Credit 

Description 	This account is credited to recognize the amount of funds/assets transferred from LGUs (Province, City, Municipality or Barangay). This account is debited, at year end, to close to the Revenue and Expense Summary account, and/or adjustments.



GAM Volume II, Chapter 11 of the COA Circular No. 2015-007 dated October 22, 2015 “Prescribing the GAM for Use of All NGAs” directs that upon receipt of biological asset and based on the approved IAR, Delivery Receipt and other supporting documents, records the farm-in-charge in coordination with property office record the biological asset in the Biological Assets Property Card and submit copies of the approved IAR with the required supporting documents to the Accounting Division/Unit, who will prepare Journal Entry Voucher (JEV) to recognize the receipt of the biological asset.



	At the end of every quarter, the farm-in-charge in coordination with the property office shall prepare Quarterly Report of Biological Assets (QRBA) containing, among others, the balances at the beginning of the quarter and the changes in fair value of the biological assets due to physical changes such as: a) growth, b) degeneration, c) production, and d) procreation, and price change. Submit the QRBA to the Accounting Division/Unit who will prepare JEV to recognize the gain or loss on fair value of the biological asset due to physical and price changes.



On February 9, 2020, an ocular visit was conducted at the San Isidro Extension Campus, several farm animals for research purposes were found in the piggery and goatery sites, as follows:

Inquiry with SIEC personnel disclosed that the above farm animals were received from the Municipality of San Isidro as part of the latter’s assistance to sustain the operation of the campus in December 2020. The Campus provided the valuation of the said animals, as follows:

	However, review of the accounting records revealed that the farm animals were not recorded, thereby understating the biological asset and the assistance from LGUs’ accounts by P60,000.00.



Recommendations:



In view of the foregoing, we recommended that Management:



1)	Direct the farm-in-charge in coordination with the property office to prepare a Biological Assets Property Card and submit a copy to the Accounting Office;



2)	Direct further the farm-in-charge in coordination with the property office to prepare a Quarterly Report of Biological Assets (QRBA) and submit a copy to the Accounting Office;



3)	Direct the Accountant to Draw a Journal Entry Voucher to recognize the Biological Assets; and



4)	Enjoin the Farm-in-Charge, the Property Officer and the Accountant to coordinate among themselves and be adept with Chapter 11 of GAM Volume II for the standards, policies, procedures and guidelines on the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure requirements of agricultural activity prescribed under IPSAS 27, Agriculture



Management’s Comment:



During the exit conference, the Accounting Unit affirmed the audit observation and informed the Audit Team that the Biological Assets were included in the year-end adjustments.

	

Auditor’s Rejoinder:



Although the aforementioned Biological Assets were already recorded in the books as claimed by the Accountant, the same were not submitted on/before February 14, 2021, hence impeded the Audit Team in reviewing the appropriateness of the recording. Thereby, the scope limitation.





Unreliable and Unverifiable Due to National Government Agencies Account Balances



11)	Despite the prior year’s recommendations, the erroneous entries in the Subsidiary Ledgers of the Due to NGAs account, as well as the inaccuracies of figures posted therein and the presence of abnormal negative balances contravened Sections 111 and 121 of PD 1445 and Sec. 15, Chapter II, Volume I of the GAM, hence rendering questions on the accuracy and reliability of the balance and fair presentation of the Due to NGAS account with a net amount of P53,911,738.86 as at December 31, 2020.

 

Section 111 and 121 of the P.D. 1445, otherwise known as the State Audit Code of the Philippines provide that:



Section 111. Keeping of accounts.



1)		The accounts of an agency shall be kept in such detail as is necessary to meet the needs of the agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or control agencies of the government. 

	

2)		The highest standards of honesty, objectivity and consistency shall be observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate or misleading information.

	

	Section 121. Financial reports and statements.

	

1)		The financial reports prepared by the agencies shall comply with the specific requirements of applicable laws and regulations as to nature, accounting basic, content, frequency, and distribution as well as with all applicable restrictions pertaining to information that is classified for national security purposes.

	

2)		The financial statements shall be based on official accounting records kept in accordance with law and the generally accepted accounting principles and standards.



Likewise, Sec. 15. Fair Presentation, of Government Accounting Manual (GAM) Volume I under COA Circular No. 2015-007 dated October 22, 2015, provides that:



The FSs shall present fairly the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in PPSAS. The application of PPSAS, with appropriate disclosures, if necessary, would result in fair presentation of the FS.



	Further, GAM Volume III define “Due to NGAs” as: 



This account is used to recognize the receipt of funds for delivery of goods/services as authorized by law, fund transfers from NGAs, other than the BIR, for implementation of specific programs or projects and other interagency transactions. Debit this account for delivery of goods /services, liquidation of funds received and settlement of liabilities. (emphasis ours)



Analysis of the “Due to NGAs account” with 116 Subsidiary Ledgers (SLs) revealed that 62.835% or 71 SLs have abnormal/negative balances in an aggregate amount of negative P89,515,633.99 or (P89,515,633.99). 

	Also, several SLs as presented in Annex C showed that the accounts were named to some College employees and to the College’s bank account numbers. GAM is clear that the due to NGAs account is used to record fund transfers from national government agencies, and not from employees, private entities nor College’s bank account numbers. 



	The aforementioned observation was already communicated in previous year, yet not fully acted upon by the Accounting Unit.



The conditions limit the Audit Team from performing confirmation of balances to the respective NGAs, hence accuracy and valuation of the account cannot be confirmed and relied upon.



Recommendations:



In view of the foregoing, we recommended that Management:



1)	Explain in writing on why the Audit Recommendation on the tracing of affected transactions was not fully acted upon;



2)	Ensure that all personnel involved in the encoding of accounting reports through eNGAS are knowledgeable enough of the system; 



3)	Check and balance mechanism must be in place before the related transactions are posted; and



4)	Trace all transactions within the affected subsidiary ledgers and effect corresponding adjustments to correct the numerous errors.



Management’s Comment:



During the exit conference, the Accounting Unit affirmed that despite the prior year’s recommendation there were still several Due to NGAs ledger balances that were unaccounted, non-moving and long outstanding, and ended with negative amounts. The Accounting Unit committed to prioritize the tracing of the improper posting in the Subsidiary Ledgers and effect the necessary adjustments.

	

Auditor’s Rejoinder:



The Audit Team emphasized that the Failure of the Accounting Unit to provide a reliable and verifiable ledger balances of the Due to NGAs accounts hampered them in sending confirmation letters to the source National Government Agencies to ascertain the accuracy of the account’s year-end balance of P53,911,738.86. Hence, the scope limitation.





Unreliable and Unverifiable Other Payables Balance



12)	Unreliable Subsidiary Ledgers caused difficulty in ascertaining the accuracy of the Other Payable account totaling to P1,654,853.32 as at December 31, 2020, contrary to Sections 111 and 121 of PD 1445 and Sec. 15, Chapter II, Volume I of the GAM.



	Section 111 and 121 of the P.D. 1445, otherwise known as the State Audit Code of the Philippines provide that:



Section 111. Keeping of accounts.



1)		The accounts of an agency shall be kept in such detail as is necessary to meet the needs of the agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or control agencies of the government. 

	

2)		The highest standards of honesty, objectivity and consistency shall be observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate or misleading information.

	

	Section 121. Financial reports and statements.

	

1)		The financial reports prepared by the agencies shall comply with the specific requirements of applicable laws and regulations as to nature, accounting basic, content, frequency, and distribution as well as with all applicable restrictions pertaining to information that is classified for national security purposes.

	

2)		The financial statements shall be based on official accounting records kept in accordance with law and the generally accepted accounting principles and standards.



Sec. 15. Fair Presentation, Chapter 2, Volume I of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) of COA Circular No. 2015-007 dated October 22, 2015, states that:



The FSs shall present fairly the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in IPSAS. The application of IPSAS, with appropriate disclosures, if necessary, would result in fair presentation of the FS.



The Accounting Unit did not submit the detailed schedule of the Other Payable account as at December 31, 2020, hence the Audit Team performed alternative procedures by directly exporting copies of the Subsidiary Ledgers (SLs) from the e-NGAS. However, review of the SLs revealed that transactions relative to the Other Payables account were posted in the name of the College’s various bank account numbers, except on the payables to Solazone and 375 students, instead to the particular payees/creditors, to wit:

The condition limits the Audit Team in performing confirmation of balances to the respective payees/creditors, hence accuracy of the Other Payable balances cannot be confirmed and relied upon.



Recommendations:



In view of the foregoing, we recommended that Management:



1)	Explain in writing what caused the improper posting of the Other Payables related transactions; 



2)	Repost the existing Other Payables’ Subsidiary Ledgers to the appropriate payee/creditor account for proper reporting; 



3)	Submit a detailed and corrected Schedule of Other Payables as at December 31, 2020; and



4)	Direct the Accountant to closely monitor the proper posting of transactions to the appropriate ledgers.



Management’s Comment:



During the exit conference, the Accounting Unit affirmed the audit observation and committed to prioritize the tracing of the improper posting in the Subsidiary Ledgers and effect the necessary adjustments.

	

Auditor’s Rejoinder:



The Audit Team emphasized that the Failure of the Accounting Unit to provide a reliable and verifiable ledger balances of the Other Payables account hampered them in sending confirmation letters to the creditors to ascertain the accuracy of the account’s year-end balance of P1,654,853.32. Hence, the scope limitation.





Erroneous Computation of Year-End Bonus and Cash Gift



13)	Misinterpretation of Sections 6.1 and 6.3 of the DBM BC No. 2016-004 dated April 28, 2016 resulted in the erroneous computation of the year-end bonus and cash gift of the five newly-hired employees in CY 2020 with an overpayment of P37,306.70.



	Sections 6.1 and 6.3 of the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) Budget Circular (BC) No. 2016-004 otherwise known as the Updated Rules and Regulations on the Grant of the Year-end Bonus and Cash Gift for FY 2016 and Years Thereafter dated April 28, 2016 provide that:



6.1 The Year-End Bonus equivalent to one (1) month basic pay as of October 31 and Cash Gift of P5,000.00 shall be given to entitled government personnel not earlier than November 15 of the current year, subject to the following conditions:



	6.1.1 Personnel has rendered at least a total or an aggregate of four (4) months of service from January 1 to October 31 of the current year; and



	6.2.2 Personnel remains to be in the government service as of October 31 of the same year.

6.3 Those who have rendered a total or an aggregate of less than four (4) months of service from January 1 to October 31 of the current year and are still in government service as of October 31 of the same year, shall be entitled SOLELY to a pro-rated Cash Gift pursuant to Section 2 of RA No. 8441, as follows:

an expenditure incurred without adhering to established rules, regulations, procedural guidelines, policies, principles or practices that have gained recognition in laws. Irregular expenditures are incurred if funds are disbursed without conforming with prescribed usages and rules of discipline. There is no observance of an established pattern, course, mode of action, behavior, or conduct in the incurrence of an irregular expenditure. A transaction conducted in a manner that deviates or departs from, or which does not comply with standards set is deemed irregular. A transaction which fails to follow or violates appropriate rules of procedure is, likewise, irregular. (emphasis supplied)



	Review of paid disbursement voucher nos. 01-2020-11-1229 and 01-2020-11-1230 both dated Novembers 16, 2020 on the payment of year-end bonus and cash gift for CY 2020 revealed the following discrepancies, viz:

	As shown above, the personnel in-charge inadvertently included the five (5) newly-hired employees in the computation of Year-end Bonus for CY 2020 despite the failure to satisfy the requirement in sec 6.1.1 of the aforementioned budget circular that Personnel has rendered at least a total or an aggregate of four (4) months of service from January 1 to October 31 of the current year. The said employees should have been entitled SOLELY to a pro-rated Cash Gift. Further, two (2) employees were unintentionally given a higher amount of pro-rated cash gift than they were entitled to.



	Per inquiry, the management is amenable of the above observation and explained that the personnel in-charge in the computation of the year-end bonus and cash gift have assumed her post effective August 1, 2020 only thus still acquainting herself of her duties and responsibilities.



	In view of this irregular expenditure, a notice of disallowance will be issued to all persons liable.



Recommendations:

	

We recommended Management to:	



1)	Refund the overpayment of year-end bonus and cash gift in the total amount of P37,306.70; and 



2)	Direct the personnel in-charge to acquaint herself of DBM BC. No 2016-004 to be guided on the computation of year-end bonus and cash gift.



Management’s Comment:



	The HRMO immediately held a meeting to the personnel concerned. Settlement of the overpayment will be made through payroll deduction and will start on February to April 2021.



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



	The Audit Team commended the proactive response by the Management.	





Non-payment of Productivity Enhancement Incentives 



14)	Laxity of the personnel-in-charge caused non-payment of Productivity Enhancement Incentives (PEI) to the five (5) qualified newly hired employees totaling to P11,500.00, contrary to Section 4.2 of DBM BC No. 2017-4 dated December 4, 2017.



	Sections 4.1 and 4.2 of the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) Budget Circular (BC) No. 2017-004 otherwise known as the Guidelines on the Grant of the Productivity Enhancement Incentives (PEI) to Government Employees for Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 and Years Thereafter dated December 4, 2017 provide that:



4.1 The Productivity Enhancement Incentive of P5,000 shall be given to personnel not earlier than December 15 of the current year, subject to the following conditions:



	4.1.1 The employees are still in the service as of November 30 of the current year; and



	4.2.2 The employees have rendered at least a total or an aggregate of four (4) months at least satisfactory service as of November 30 of the current year including leaves of absence with pay.



4.2 Those who have rendered less than the total or aggregate of four (4) months of service but still in the service as of November 30 of the current year shall be entitled to pro-rated PEI (emphasis supplied), as follows:

	Per inquiry, the personnel-in-charge explained that the aforementioned employees were not included in the general payroll because they were not able to meet the requirement on rendering service in an aggregate of four (4) months at least satisfactory service as of November 30 of the current year, without taking consideration on the other provisions/sections of the guideline. 



Recommendations:

	

In view of the foregoing, we recommended Management to:	



1)	Pay the five (5) qualified newly hired employees of their Productivity Enhancement Incentive (PEI) for CY 2020 totaling to P11,500.00; and 



2)	Direct the personnel in-charge to acquaint herself of DBM BC. No 2017-004 to be guided on the computation of Productivity Enhancement Incentive (PEI).



Management’s Comment:



	The HRMO immediately acted on the recommendation and prepared a payroll for the release of the Productivity Enhancement Incentives.



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



	The Audit Team commended the proactive response by the Management.	





Incomplete Documentation on the Release of Mid-Year Bonus



15)	Contrary to Section 4.6 of P.D. 1445 and Section 57 of the General Provisions of the FY 2020 GAA, payments of Mid-Year Bonus for FY 2020 totaling to P7,452,972.00 were not supported with complete documentation, thereby casting doubt on the validity of the claims.

 

Section 4.6 of the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines (P.D. 1445) states that:



Claims against government funds shall be supported with complete documentation.



Section 57 of the General Provisions of the FY 20202 General Appropriations Act (GAA) provides the following: 



Mid-year Bonus. The Mid-year Bonus equivalent to one (1) month basic salary, shall be granted to all National Government personnel, whether under regular, temporary, casual or contractual status, on full-time or part-time basis, subject to the following:



a)	Personnel have rendered at least a total or an aggregate of four (4) months of service from July 1 of the immediately preceding year to May 15 of the current year and who are still in the government service as of May 15 of the current year; 



b)	Personnel have obtained at least a satisfactory performance rating in the immediately preceding rating period; and (emphasis supplied)



c)	The provisions of B.C. No. 2017-2 dated May 8, 2017 and such other guidelines issued by the DBM."



Review of the paid disbursement vouchers revealed that the College released the Mid-Year Bonus equivalent to one (1) month basic salary to their 197 regular and casual employees. Details as follows:

940,801.00

However, the list of qualified employees indicating their performance ratings in the immediately preceding rating period of at least satisfactory was not attached. Despite the lacking document, the Accountant signed the disbursement voucher certifying that the supporting documents were complete and amount claimed was proper. The Audit Team demanded the immediate submission of the said document from the Office of the Human Resource Management, and it was disclosed that 29 of the 197 employees did not furnish the latter of their O/IPCR for the 2nd Semester of FY 2019, contrary to the College’s Strategic Performance Management System (SPMS) which prescribes that the accomplished O/IPCR with final ratings be submitted to the HRMO not later than the 15th day after the rating period. Please refer to Annex D for the details of the 29 employees. 



	The condition casted doubts on the entitlement of the 29 employees who received the Mid-Year Bonus for FY 2020, and failure to comply the requirement will render the transaction as an irregular expenditure. Section 3.1 of COA Circular No. 2012-003 also known as the Updated Guidelines for the Prevention and Disallowance of Irregular, Unnecessary, Excessive, Extravagant and Unconscionable Expenditures dated October 29, 2012 define Irregular Expenditure as:



an expenditure incurred without adhering to established rules, regulations, procedural guidelines, policies, principles or practices that have gained recognition in laws. Irregular expenditures are incurred if funds are disbursed without conforming with prescribed usages and rules of discipline. There is no observance of an established pattern, course, mode of action, behavior, or conduct in the incurrence of an irregular expenditure. A transaction conducted in a manner that deviates or departs from, or which does not comply with standards set is deemed irregular. A transaction which fails to follow or violates appropriate rules of procedure is, likewise, irregular. (emphasis supplied)



Recommendations:



We recommended Management to:	



1)	Immediately submit a copy of the O/IPCR of the 29 employees for the 2nd Semester of FY 2019 with final numerical and adjectival ratings;



2)	Direct the HRMO who prepares the general payroll and document the claim for the release of Mid-Year Bonus annually to attach the list of qualified employees indicating their performance ratings in the immediately preceding rating period of at least satisfactory; and



3)	Direct the Accountant to review all disbursement vouchers and their attachments, and certify only those DVs with complete supporting documents to preclude payments of irregular disbursements.



Management’s Comment:



	The HRMO immediately acted on the recommendations and informed the Audit Team that one I/OPCR copy remained not yet submitted. 



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



	The Audit Team commended the proactive response by the Management.





Unreported In-House Review Class Collections and Disbursements



16)	Inefficient administration and financial management of the In-House Criminologist Licensure Examination (CLE) Review Class resulted in control lapses such as non-issuance of Official Receipts (ORs), non-reporting of collections received from reviewees and outright utilization of the collections without proper approval, contrary to Section 1, Book V, Title 1-B of EO No. 292 and Sec. 2 of PD 1445.



Sec. 1 of EO No. 292 [Book V, Title 1-B, Chapter 1-General Provisions] instituting the Administrative Code of 1987 and Sec. 2 of PD 1445, otherwise known as the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines declared that:



All resources of the government shall be managed, expended or utilized in accordance with law and regulations and safeguarded against loss or wastage through illegal or improper disposition to ensure efficiency, economy and effectiveness in the operations of government. The responsibility to take care that such policy is faithfully adhered to rests directly with the chief or head of the government agency concerned.



	Further, various provisions of the PD 1445 on the Receipt and Disposition of Funds and Property provide that:



Section 63. Accounting for moneys and property received by public officials. Except as may otherwise be specifically provided by law or competent authority all moneys and property officially received by a public officer in any capacity or upon any occasion must be accounted for as government funds and government property. Government property shall be taken up in the books of the agency concerned at acquisition cost or an appraised value.



Section 64. Designation of collecting officers for government agencies. The head of an agency may designate such number of collecting officers or agents may be deemed necessary. They shall render reports of their collections, under the regulations of the Commission, to be submitted promptly to the auditor concerned who shall conduct the necessary examination land audit within thirty days from receipt thereof.



Section 65. Accrual of income to unappropriated surplus of the General Fund.

1)	Unless otherwise specifically provided by law, income accruing to the agencies by virtue of the provisions of law, orders and regulations shall be deposited in the National Treasury or in any duly authorized government depository, and shall accrue to the unappropriated surplus of the General Fund of the Government.

2)	Amounts received in trust and from business-type activities of government may be separately recorded and disbursed in accordance with such rules and regulations as may be determined by a Permanent Committee composed of the Secretary (Minister) of Finance as Chairman, and the Commissioner of the Budget and the Chairman, Commission of Audit, as members.



Section 66. Special, Fiduciary and Trust Funds. Receipts shall be recorded as income of Special Fiduciary of Trust Funds or Funds other than the General Fund only when authorized by law as implemented by rules and regulations issued by the Permanent Committee created in the preceding section.



Section 68. Issuance of Official receipt.

1. No payment of any nature shall be received by a collecting officer without immediately issuing an official receipt in acknowledgment thereof The receipt may be in the form of postage, internal revenue or documentary stamps and the like, or officially numbered receipts, subject to proper custody, accountability, and audit.

Public officers authorized to receive and collect moneys arising from taxes, revenues, or receipts of any kind shall remit or deposit intact the full amounts so received and collected by them to the treasury of the agency concerned and credited to the particular accounts to which the said moneys belong. The amount of the collections ultimately payable to other agencies of the government shall thereafter be remitted to the respective treasuries of these agencies, under regulations which the Commission and the Department (Ministry) of Finance shall prescribe.



Xxx



4. The respective treasuries of those agencies shall in turn deposit with the proper government depository the full amount of the collections not later than the following banking day.



	Moreover, Section 84 of the PD 1445 on the Disbursement of government funds prescribes that:



1. Revenue funds shall not be paid out of any public treasury or depository except in pursuance of an appropriation law or other specific statutory authority.



2. Trust funds shall not be paid out of any public treasury or depository except in fulfillment of the purpose for which the trust was created or funds received, and upon authorization of the legislative body, or head of any other agency of the government having control thereof, and subject to pertinent budget law, rules and regulations.



	On February 08, 2021, in view of the implementation of the Criminologist Licensure Examination (CLE) Review Class (1st and 2nd Batches), the Audit Team demanded the immediate submission of the following, viz:



1)	Special Order of the personnel-in-charge, as Review Director, as Collecting Officer and as Special Disbursing Officer;

2)	List of Reviewees (1st and 2nd Batches) and the corresponding duly accomplished registration/ enrollment forms (or equivalent);

3)	Reports of Collection  (1st and 2nd Batches) and copies of the corresponding Official Receipts (ORs) Issued;

4)	Report of Disbursement / Liquidation Reports and copies of the corresponding attachments/ supporting documents;

5)	List of Review Masters and their corresponding contract, if any;

6)	Attendance Sheets during orientation, diagnostic test and in every class/session; and 

7)	Photo Documentation during the implementation of the Review Class, if available.



On February 11, 2021, the personnel-in-charge submitted the following documents, to wit:



1)	CLE Review Program;

2)	Partial Accomplishment Report (1st Batch, November 2019 Schedule); and

3)	List of Students.



Also, the personnel-in-charge clarified and attested the following:



--	That he did not receive any Special Order (SO) to formally designate him as the Review Class Director (RCD), as he was just verbally informed about his role as the RCD;



--	That the actual review class did not have any enrolment forms, as the same was not provided in the CLE review program proposal signed and approved on March 18, 2019, that commenced operation on June 2019 for the November 2019 CLE schedule, potential reviewees were just advised to pay their down-payment through the College Cashier with a corresponding endorsement letter from the program head;



--	That the CLE review class did not successfully have 2nd Batch of reviewees (June 2020 CLE schedule) due to the threat arising from Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19);



--	That as an acting RCD, he had to shell-out from his own pocket some expenses of the review program, such as, professional fees to the reviewers/lecturers right after their lectures. He justified that he did it to ensure the smooth operation of the Review program until he can no longer sustain and resorted him to personally collect the remaining balances of the reviewees’ review fees; and 



--	That the Financial Reports with acknowledgement receipt of each lecture will be submitted on February 16, 2021.



Inquiry and initial validation of the available documents disclosed the following:



--	That the College neglectfully designate an employee as Review Class Director without proper documentation;

--	That the acting RCD as a newly-hired Instructor was not informed nor oriented on the proper management and utilization of government funds, as he acted as Collecting and Disbursing Officer without Special Order, Fidelity Bond and no proper records that should be maintained as an Accountable Officer;

--	That the submitted List of Students was incomplete;

--	That there were no Reports of Collection for the review fees collected and no authorization by the personnel-in-charge;

--	That the 2nd Batch of the CLE Review Class claimed to be not started has actually commenced their classes and orientation inside the campus in the earlier days of the year 2020 before restriction of face-to-face classes, as inquired from the 2nd batch reviewee. Hence, down-payment may have been collected; and

--	That the Report of Disbursement / Liquidation Reports (1st and 2nd Batches) and copies of the corresponding attachments/ supporting documents, the List of Review Masters and their corresponding contract, if any, the Attendance Sheets during orientation, diagnostic test and in every class/session, were not submitted as of February 17, 2021.



Moreover, the corresponding income and disbursements were not recorded in the Accounting book which resulted in the understatement of the affected accounts. The condition precluded the Audit Team from performing timely audit and review of cash transactions. 



Attention is invited to Sections 101 and 105 of PD 1445 which provide that:



Section 101 – “Every officer of any government agency whose duties permit or require the possession or custody of government funds or property shall be accountable therefore and for the safekeeping thereof in conformity with law.”



Section 105 – “ Every officer accountable for government funds shall be liable for all losses resulting from the unlawful deposit, use or application thereof and for all losses attributable to negligence in the custodianship of the funds.”



Recommendations:



In view of the foregoing, we recommended that Management:



1)	Explain on why the condition on non-reporting of collections, utilization of collections and other lapses in the administration of cash existed;



2)	Conduct an in-depth investigation and evaluation of the matter and while investigation is ongoing, relieve the personnel-in-charge from his duties and responsibilities as Review Director/Collecting and Disbursing Officer;



3)	Direct the personnel-in-charge to justify on why no administrative and criminal charges be filed against him and submit the lacking documents; and



4)	Be reminded with Sections 101 and 105 of PD1445 or the Government Auditing Code of the Philippine on the extent of liability of every accountable officer.



Management’s Comment:



	The Management acknowledged the observation and yet to submit a written explanation on the matter.



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



	The Audit Team reminded the Management that the non-submission of the aforementioned documents hampered the Audit Team in performing timely audit. Hence, the scope limitation.





Delay Deposits of Collections 



17)	Due to weak internal control and lack of monitoring, approximately 623 calendar days of delayed deposits were incurred for 429 official receipts (ORs) issued on March 7-10, 2019 with an aggregate amount of P264,324.00, contrary to Section 69-Item 4 of PD 1445 that collections be deposited not later than the following banking day, thus exposing the fund to higher risk of loss or misuse.



	Section 69-Item 4 of PD 1445 otherwise known as the “Government Auditing Code of the Philippines” states that:



The respective treasuries of those agencies shall in turn deposit with the proper government depository the full amount of the collections not later than the following banking day. (Emphasis ours)



Paragraph 32, Chapter 2 of the COA Memorandum No. 2014-003 dated July 9, 2013, prescribing the use of the Revised Cash Examination Manual states further: 



All COs shall deposit intact all their collections, as well as collections turned over to them by sub-collectors/tellers, with authorized government depository bank (AGDB) daily or not later than the next banking day. Where collections are minimal and daily deposit thereof becomes costly and impractical, the COs shall deposit their collections at least once a week, or as soon as the collections reach P10,000.00. They shall record all deposits made in the CRR. (Emphasis supplied)



Likewise, section 75 of PD1445 directs that transfer of government funds from one officer to another shall, except as allowed by law or regulation, be made only upon prior direction or authorization, of the Commission or its representative.



On November 18, 2020, the Audit Team conducted a count on the cash and accounts, and accountable forms under the accountability of the current Banaybanay Extension Campus (BEC) Coordinator, Mr. Felix U. Sansaet, Jr, who was designated as Collecting/ Special Disbursing Officer and Petty Cash Custodian since January 22, 2020 without proper turn-over and that the Office of the Auditor was not also informed about the redesignation. During the inspection, it was found out that 429 ORs presented as unused per Report of Accountability for Accountable Forms (RAAF) as of October 2020 were actually used/issued on March 7-10, 2019 during the time of the previous BEC Coordinator/Collecting/ Special Disbursing Officer and Petty Cash Custodian, Dr. Edna B. Bagcal. In her letter received by the Audit Team on December 4, 2020, Dr. Bagcal expressed that she was not aware about the collections because it was Ms. Chandie B. Romero, Cashiering Aide and a Job Order Personnel, who actually received the collections and issued the corresponding ORs in her behalf, but did not report the transactions. Dr. Bagcal confronted Ms. Romero and the latter confirmed the condition and acknowledged that it was her fault. Ms. Romero submitted her duly notarized explanation stating that the collections pertained to miscellaneous fees particularly for physical facilities and improvements received from various students. The campus was instructed not to collect the said miscellaneous fee anymore since the CHED, with the implementation of the Free Higher Education, already paid the fee. Ms. Romero accordingly believed that the collections were unauthorized, just kept the collections and waited for the COA Auditor to visit the campus to ask for some advice.



	Scrutiny of the aforementioned ORs revealed that these were actually undated, Ms. Romero just mentioned that the actual collections were made some time March 7-10, 2020. Ms. Romero summarized the ORs dated as follows:



No. of Official Receipts

OR Series

329072 - 329206

329207 - 329311

March 10, 2019



	Per Report of Collections and Deposits (RCD) last March 2019, the last OR reported on March 7, 2019 was 329071, consistent to the first OR series shown above, but doubtful for March 9, 2019 and March 10, 2019 as these were Saturday and Sunday. Also, 56 of the 429 ORs were collections for “completion” and not for miscellaneous fee-physical facilities and improvements, and one OR was issued for the collection of a student’s previous balance, inconsistent again of Ms. Romero’s claim that the collections pertain to miscellaneous fee-physical facilities and improvements. Further, if Ms. Romero believed that the collections were unauthorized, she should have still reported and deposited the collections as these will just be refunded to the respective students.



	During the actual cash count, Ms. Romero presented a cash totaling P258,365.00 with no corresponding Report of Collection, hence the accuracy of the amount presented by her could not be readily validated. The Audit Team demanded that the cash be deposited immediately which Ms. Romero did the next banking day. Upon verification of the duplicate copies of the ORs, it was found out that the total amount should have been P264,534.00, hence short of P6,169.00. The Audit Team immediately demanded the production of the variance and directed the immediate deposit of the amount. Thus, the total amount of P264,534.00 was already deposited to DOSCST-BEC DBP account on November 20, 2020.



	Ms. Romero as a Job Order Personnel has mentioned in her notarized justification that she will file a resignation as her contract will likewise end on December 31, 2020.



	Management is reminded of section 75 of PD 1445 that transfer of government funds from one officer to another shall, except as allowed by law or regulation, be made only upon prior direction or authorization of the Commission or its representative. Currently, the College practices the designation of Campus Coordinators as Collecting/Disbursing Officer and Petty Cash Custodian but other personnel will actually hold the fund and prepare/maintain the corresponding reports/records. Had management not allowed the transfer of government funds especially to a non-regular employee, the condition on much delayed deposits would have been avoided, as the accountable officer will be extra-cautious as he/she will primarily be liable for his/her actions and his/her earned-government benefits may be at stake. 



	Lastly, management is not prohibited to assign an accounting personnel who shall (1) monitor the timely deposit of collections made by each Accountable Officer (AO) and (2) prepare an Analysis of Report of Accountability for Accountable Forms for each AO periodically to ascertain the completeness of issued and unissued Official Receipts as at year-end.



Recommendations:



We recommended that Management:



1)	Designate a regular administrative personnel to act as collecting/ disbursing officer and petty cash fund custodian who will primarily hold the fund and who will prepare/maintain the necessary reports/records; and



2)	Direct the Accountant to assign an accounting personnel to (1) monitor the timely deposit of collections made by each Accountable Officer (AO) and (2) prepare an Analysis of Report of Accountability for Accountable Forms for each AO periodically to ascertain the completeness of issued and unissued Official Receipts as at year-end.



Management’s Comment:



	The Accounting Unit informed that an accounting personnel was already assigned to monitor the collections and timely deposits of the extension campuses’ Accountable Officers. On the designation of a regular administrative personnel in Banaybanay and Cateel Extension Campuses, the Management will still have to review the existing manpower of the College.



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



	The Audit Team commended the proactive response of the Management.	





Monthly Payment of Honorarium to the Office of the Solicitor General 



18)	Payments to the Office of the Solicitor General for the Legal Services rendered in the total amount of P583,200.00 (net of tax) have no legal basis in violation of RA 9417, thereby depriving the College of the opportunity to finance other projects and activities beneficial to the public.



Section 1 of PD 478, reiterated in Chapter 12, Section 35 of E.O. 292 and R.A. 9417, or the Act to Strengthen the Office of the Solicitor General by Expanding and Streamlining its Bureaucracy, Upgrading Employee Skills and Augmenting benefits, and Appropriating Funds therefor and for other purposes, the OSG is the law office of the Government.



The Office of the Solicitor General shall represent the Government of the Philippines, its agencies and instrumentalities and its officials and agents in any litigation, proceeding, investigation or matter requiring the services of a lawyer. When authorized by the President or head of the office concerned, it shall also represent government-owned or controlled corporations. The Office of the Solicitor General shall constitute the law office of the Government and, as such discharge duties requiring the services of a lawyer. (emphasis supplied)

	

			

Sections 8 and 10 of RA No. 9417 provides monetary benefits and allowances to officers and employees of the Office of the Solicitor General as follows: 



Section 8. Other Benefits. – Consistent with the provisions of Executive Order No. 292, otherwise known as the Revised Administrative Code of 1987, the legal staff of the Office of the Solicitor General are allowed to receive honoraria and allowances from client departments, agencies, and instrumentalities of the Government.



Section 10. Grant of Special Allowances. – The Solicitor General, Assistant Solicitor General, Senior State Solicitor, State Solicitors I and II and Associate Solicitors I to III shall be granted special allowances in amount to be determined by the Secretary of the Department of Budget and Management and the Solicitor General. 



The grant of special allowances shall be implemented uniformly in such sums and amounts and up to the extent only that can be supported by the funding source specified in Section 11 hereof: Provided, That the said special allowance shall not exceed One Hundred percent (100%) of the basic salary of solicitors as provided in Republic Act No. 6758, otherwise known as the Salary Standardization Law.” (Underscoring and emphasis ours)



	It is clear from the above-mentioned provisions of law under Section 8 of RA 9417, that the basis on which the subject honoraria and allowances are anchored on, should only grant such benefits to the Legal Staff of the OSG. The said provision should be distinguished from the Special Allowance, as provided under Section 10, specifically given to the Solicitor General, Assistance Solicitor General, State Solicitors and Associate Solicitors.



The above-cited provisions readily show that Senior Officials of the OSG are already excluded from the grant of honoraria and allowances under Section 8 of RA 9417, since the same is expressly given only to the OSG Legal Staff. The applicable provision to the said officials, therefor, is Section 10, which deals with the Special Allowance given specifically to the senior officials of the OSG, subject to certain conditions and requirements. Ruling otherwise would be tantamount to double or excessive remuneration, since the said senior officials are already entitled to Special Allowance, on top of their basic salaries.

	

Further, P.D. 478 and its subsequent amendments E.O. 297 and R.A. 9417, should conform to P.D. 985, as amended by P.D. 1597, which mandates prior consent and approval from the Office of the President, thru the budget secretary, to wit: 



Section 5. Allowances, Honoraria, and Other Fringe Benefits. Allowances, honoraria and other fringe benefits which may be granted to government employees, whether payable by their respective offices or by other agencies of government, shall be subject to the approval of the President upon recommendation of the Commissioner of the Budget. For this purpose, the Budget Commission shall review on a continuing basis and shall prepare, for the consideration and approval of the President, policies and levels of allowances and other fringe benefits applicable to government personnel, including honoraria or other forms of compensation for participation in projects which are authorized to pay additional compensation

	

Likewise, the same issue was decided and ruled upon by the Commission Proper in Commission on Audit (COA) Circular No. 88-289, dated July 19, 1988, wherein, in the letter of then DBM Secretary, Guillermo N. Carague, it was mentioned that:



The Assistant Solicitor General and the Solicitors are covered by Executive Order No. 152 hence are disqualified by operation of law from receiving allowances except representation and transportation allowances.



It may be added in this connection that handling of court cases is a regular function and responsibility of the Office of the Solicitor General, hence OSG lawyers are not entitled to the Counsel allowance under Section 34 of EO No. 87 or Section 31 of R.A. No. 6642.



All requests from agencies of government for payment to OSG lawyers, Government Corporate Counsel Lawyers Prosecution Staffs of the Department of Justice, of allowance/honorarium should be disapproved on the aforediscussed grounds.

	

			On October 15, 2018 and November 22, 2019, Memoranda of Agreement (MOA) were entered by and between the Davao Oriental State College of Science and Technology (DOSCST) and the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) both duly confirmed by the College’s Board of Trustees wherein the College will give monthly allowances to OSG lawyers in exchange for the legal services and advice to DOSCST and its officials and represent them in litigations, covering the period January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019 and January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020, respectively.

	As shown above, aside from the questionable payment as a whole, the College paid particularly the October to December 2019 allowance using the Statutory Trust Fund. Section 2.2 of COA Circular No. 2000-002 dated April 04, 2000 “Accounting Guidelines and Procedures on the Use of Income of SUCs Pursuant to RA 8292” states that:



2.2 The STF shall be used to augment the maintenance and other operating expenses and capital outlays of the university and to pay authorized allowances and fringe benefits to teachers and students who render services to the school.	



	COA Decision No. 2011-067 in Detera, et al. vs COA RO No. V the CP explained that it was clear that the STF may be used only for the purposes stated in Item 2.2 of COA Circular No. 2000-002, thus, any expense not in accord with the same may be disallowed in audit. 

		

				Moreover, in years 2019 and 2020 Contracts for Legal Consultancy were entered into by and between the College and Maduay Law Office, both duly approved by the OSG and duly concurred by the Commission on Audit. Hence, both the College and OSG have the knowledge of the said retainership agreement, yet both parties still proceeded with the subject MOA. Thus, considering the legal services rendered by Atty. Maduay under the retainership agreement, the MOA with the OSG were unnecessary.        



	These unauthorized payments having a total amount of P648,000.00 deprived the government of the opportunity to use the money to finance other projects or activities more beneficial to the public.



	In OSG’s exercise of their primary function, there is no need to retain or otherwise give additional benefits for the services rendered or to be rendered by the OSG, as it is their basic duty, mandate and function to provide legal services or otherwise represent the Government and its officers in all courts / tribunals and in all civil and special proceedings in which the Government or any of its officers, in their official capacity, is a party.



Recommendations:



We recommended that Management:



1)	Refund the monthly allowance paid in January 2019 to June 2020 totalling to P583,200.00; 



2)	Stop paying allowance to the Office of the Solicitor General for lack of legal basis; and



3)	Revisit R.A. 9417 otherwise known as the Act to Strengthen the Office of the Solicitor General by Expanding and Streamlining its Bureaucracy, Upgrading Employee Skills and Augmenting benefits for guidance.



Management’s Comment:



	The Management provided a detailed justification on the matter that the Office of the Solicitor General is entitled to payments for legal services. That under Section 1(i) of PD No. 478 and Section 35(9), Chapter 12, Title III, Book IV of EO No. 292, OSG lawyers are authorized to receive allowances and honoraria for the legal services they render without qualifications, thus:



Departments, bureaus, agencies, offices, instrumentalities and corporations to whom the Office of the Solicitor General renders legal services are authorized to disburse funds from their sundry operating and other funds for the latter Office. For this purpose, the Solicitor General and his staff are specifically authorized to receive allowances as may be provided by the Government offices, instrumentalities and corporations concerned, in addition to their regular compensation.



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



	With the legal implication of the observation, a Notice of Disallowance will be issued and the due process as described in the Rules and Regulations on Settlement of Accounts will be observed.





Non-submission of a Surety Bond



19)	Advance Payment for Mobilization cost equivalent to 15% of the contract price was released to Spurway Enterprises amounting to P6,678,159.58 as at October 31, 2020 despite non-submission of an irrevocable standby letter of credit of equivalent value from a commercial bank, a bank guarantee or a surety bond callable upon demand, issued by a surety or insurance company and confirmed by the College, thus exposing to risk of loss of government funds in case the contractor would not perform their responsibilities.



	Section 4 on the Advance Payment and Annex E on the Contract Implementation Guidelines for the Procurement of Infrastructure Projects of RA 9184 otherwise known as the Government Procurement Reform Act provides that:

                                                                      

4.1. The procuring entity shall, upon a written request of the contractor which shall be submitted as a contract document, make an advance payment to the contractor in an amount not exceeding fifteen percent (15%) of the total contract price, to be made in lump sum or, at the most, two installments according to a schedule specified in the Instructions to Bidders and other relevant Tender Documents; 



4.2. The advance payment shall be made only upon the submission to and acceptance by the procuring entity of an irrevocable standby letter of credit of equivalent value from a commercial bank, a bank guarantee or a surety bond callable upon demand, issued by a surety or insurance company duly licensed by the Insurance Commission and confirmed by the procuring entity; (emphasis supplied)



The same provisions were also stated in Section 9.1.1.1 of COA Circular 2012-001 on the Revised Documentary Requirements for Common Government Transactions dated June 14, 2012.



	Review of paid disbursement vouchers revealed that an advance payment was released to Spurway Enterprises as mobilization cost on the Completion of Existing Oval Track with a contract price of P44,521,063.87 despite non-submission of an irrevocable standby letter of credit of equivalent value from a commercial bank, a bank guarantee or a surety bond callable upon demand, issued by a surety or insurance company and confirmed by the College. What was attached was a copy of the performance bond already submitted by the contractor as a requirement before the execution of the related contract. Details as follow:

P6,678,159.58

	

	Review of other related paid disbursement vouchers on the release of advance payment to four contractors disclosed compliance on the aforementioned provisions, as the four contractors submitted surety bonds equivalent to 15% of their respective contract prices in each project.



Per inquiry, the management had just overlooked the copy of the bond submitted by Spurway Enterprises treating the same as the prescribed one, hence the 15% mobilization cost was released. As a consequence, the condition is disadvantageous to the government as it is in the losing end if the contractors would not perform their responsibility vis-à-vis the Program of Work for civil works.  



Recommendations:



We recommended Management to:	



1)	Demand submission from Spurway Enterprises the prescribed irrevocable standby letter of credit of equivalent value from a commercial bank, a bank guarantee or a surety bond callable upon demand, issued by a surety or insurance company and confirmed by the College; and 



2)	Direct the Accountant to review all disbursement vouchers and their attachments, and certify only those DVs with complete supporting documents to preclude payments of irregular disbursements.



Management’s Comment:



	The Accounting Unit immediately demanded the submission of the surety bond from the contractor and submitted to the Office of the Auditor.



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



	The Audit Team commended the proactive response of the Accounting Unit.





Late Release of Stipends to Scholars



20)	Lapses and lack of sense of urgency caused the inefficient and non-release of the 1st Semester of Academic Year 2019-2020 stipends to 699 student-beneficiaries under the Tertiary Education Subsidy (TES) for Filipino Students totaling to P14.9Million, thus depriving the beneficiaries from timely entitlement of the benefits derived therefrom as six months have elapsed but no releases yet, and defeating the purpose of the TES program.



Tertiary Education Subsidy (TES) for Filipino Students is one of the five components of R.A. No. 10931, known as the Universal Access to Quality Tertiary Education Act of 2017. The purpose for the establishment of the program is to support the cost of tertiary education or any portion thereof. (emphasis supplied)



The Memorandum Circular No. 2018-0004 dated October 15, 2018 was issued by the UniFAST’s governing board as guidelines on the implementation of the TES for Filipino Students. The TES, among others, support the cost of tertiary education or any part or portion thereof, and covers the following:



a)	Xxx

b)	All allowance for books, supplies, transportation and miscellaneous personal expenses, including a reasonable allowance for the documented rental or purchase of a personal computer or laptop and other education-related expenses;



c)	An allowance for room and board costs incurred by the student;



d)	For a student with disability, an allowance for expenses related to the student’s disability including special services, personal assistance, transportation, equipment, and supplies that are reasonably incurred; and



e)	For a student in a program requiring professional license or certification, the one (1)-time cost of obtaining the first professional credentials or qualifications, which may include: application fees, notarial fees, review classes fees, insurance premiums and documentation fees. 



The TES benefits awarded to qualified students shall correspond to the institution and programs they are enrolled in. For students enrolled in SUCs, the full-year grant for TES – 2 shall be equivalent to P40,000.00 for the academic year or P20,000.00 per semester.



Moreover, in view of the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic which brought unprecedented disruptions to the lives of people all over the world, and the increasing number of cases, avoiding and limiting the risks of infection of the academic community has become primordial concerns for higher education institutions. The Commission on Higher Education (CHED) issued Memorandum Order No. 04 series of 2020 as Guidelines on the Implementation of Flexible Learning.



Flexible Learning is a pedagogical approach allowing flexibility of time, place, and audience including but not solely focused on the use of technology. Although it commonly uses the delivery methods of distance education and facilities of education technology, this may vary depending on the levels of technology, availability of devices, internet connectivity, level of digital literacy, and approaches.



Section 8 of the aforementioned order provides that Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) shall establish means for student and teacher engagement or communication which may include Short Message Service (SMS), electronic mail (email), online chat, instant messaging, and other means whichever is convenient, appropriate, and available in order to ensure personalized, effective, efficient, and timely mentoring and feedback mechanisms.



Further, sec. 10(a) of the same order encouraged HEIs to maximize the use of technology to support learning and teaching, which may include the following:



a)	Determination of the level of technology to be used for the delivery of programs based on connectivity of students. Example:

Categories

Availability of Devices

Internet Connectivity

Level of Digital Literacy

Approaches

High Level Technology

Laptops, mobile phones, tablets, desktops

Fast

Proficient 

Online learning or Blended learning

Medium Level Technology

Mostly available phones

Slow

Advanced

Macro and micro learning approach (a mix of online and offline activities)

Low Level Technology

Some mobile phones or no technology

Poor or no Internet connection

Beginner

Self-instructional modules/ mostly offline activities.



Monitoring on the implementation of the Tertiary Education Subsidy (TES) for Filipino Students revealed that on August 20, 2020, P15,367,600.00 (including 3% administrative cost) was credited in the account of the College from CHED, intended for the 1st Semester of A.Y. 2019-2020 (August to December 2019). However, due to the lack of sound coordination by the College (Implementing Agency) to the CHED (Source Agency) particularly the UniFAST, and on the late preparation of bank reconciliation statements, the amount was known and identified only on the preceding months. An Official Receipt (OR) No. 0333570 was issued to recognize the collection dated October 02, 2020 or almost 2 two months from the date of actual fund transfer. 



On the second week of October, in coordination with the Development Bank of the Philippines (the DBP), the student-beneficiaries applied for an ATM account that will be used on the downloading of their respective stipends. As of February 2, 2021, several grantees were already given an external account number but none were paid yet.



Inquiry with the cashiering unit disclosed that the general payrolls and their corresponding disbursement vouchers were already prepared and the in-charge was just working-out with the DBP to collate the 100% account numbers of the grantees before it will be disbursed. 



The cashiering unit should have released the stipend to students with available account numbers and ATM cards via direct debit scheme, and release the remaining stipends through other modes, like cash advance to authorized personnel, with due consideration of the health protocols and mechanisms.



The lack of sound coordination and sense of urgency among offices/units, caused the late release of the stipends to the student-beneficiaries, which should have offered a relief to the grantees to support their educational outlays, such as but not limited to purchase of mobile phones and cellular loads for communication, researches and online classes, daily sustenance, transportation and the like.



Recommendations:



In view of the foregoing, we recommended Management to:	



1)	Immediately release the 1st Semester, A.Y. 2019-2020 stipends to 699 student-beneficiaries of the Tertiary Education Subsidy (TES) for Filipino Students; 



2)	Direct the Head, Financial Assistance Scholarship and Studentship Unit, the Accountant and the Cashier  to coordinate among themselves and have at least a sense of urgency, to eliminate delays in releasing of scholarship benefits; and



3)	Direct the Head, Financial Assistance Scholarship and Studentship Unit, the Accountant and the Cashier to explain/justify in writing on why no disciplinary measure shall be meted against them for inefficiency and incompetence in the performance of official duties in accordance with Section 46 of the Administrative Code.



Management’s Comment:



	During the exit conference, the Cashier informed the Audit Team that stipends were already released to scholars with available bank accounts. The Management committed to look for other means in order to fully release the stipends since the 2nd Semester AY 2019-2020 is also available for release.



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



The Audit Team emphasized that the purpose for the establishment of the program is to support the cost of tertiary education or any portion thereof, failure to timely release the stipend would defeat its purpose.





Unqualified B2HELP Recommended Scholars



21)	22 out of the 91 recommended-grantees of Bayanihan 2 for Higher Education Tulong Program (B2HELP) did not meet the qualification requirements stipulated in CHED Memorandum Order (CMO) No. 10 series of 2020 with a total grant of P81,644.31, hence depriving other qualified students from availing the same.



	On March 24, 2020, President Rodrigo Roa Duterte signed RA 11469, otherwise known as “Bayanihan to Heal as One Act”, declaring a “state of national emergency arising from Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) situation” and to implement “temporary measures to respond to the crisis brought about by the pandemic”. The President then signed RA 11494, also known as “Bayanihan to Recover as One Act”, on September 11, 2020 to implement interventions and mechanisms that could “accelerate the recovery and bolster the resiliency of the Philippine economy.



	One of the interventions implemented by the national government was the provision of subsidy and allowance to qualified students in private and public higher education institutions (HEIs). Pursuant to this, the Commission on Higher Education issued CMO No. 10, series of 2020, otherwise known as the Implementing Guidelines for Bayanihan 2 for Higher Education Tulong Program (B2HELP) as provided in Section 4(n) of Republic Act 11494.



	The objective of B2HELP is to provide a one-time fixed grant of five thousand pesos (P5,000.00) to qualified students “whose families are now facing financial difficulties brought about by work stoppage and closure of establishments due to the community quarantine. Qualified Students in public HEIs can use the subsidy/allowance to cover some of their flexible learning expenses such as connectivity expenses.

	

	Section IV-Coverage of the guidelines provides the qualification requirements of grantees studying in public HEI are as follows:



1)	Must be a Filipino citizen;

2)	Must be enrolled in a CHED recognized Bachelor’s degree program (with Permit, Recognition, or COPC) this First Semester, AY 2020-2021 (emphasis ours); and

3)	Must be a 3rd year, 4th year, or graduating students this First Semester, AY 2020-2021



To expedite or fast track the disbursement of the B2HELP fund, HEIs shall file applications on behalf of the recommended qualified grantees. On December 21, 2020, CHED ROXI transferred fund to DOSCST amounting to P263,829.54 for the 91 grantees of the B2HELP. However, review of the application filed by the College and from the Master list provided by the CHED ROXI revealed that 22 of the 91 grantees are not enrolled in the First Semester of A.Y. 2020-2021, thus did not meet the 2nd qualification requirement mentioned above. Please refer to Annex E for the List of Disqualified Grantees. Out of the 22 grantees, 20 already graduated by 2nd Semester of AY 2019-2020 and the remaining 2 are enrolled only this 2nd Semester of AY 2020-2021. Step 5 of the application process directs that in identifying the recommended grantees, the HEI must ensure that the qualification provided in Section IV are complied with.



One of the columns of the pro-forma HEI List of Recommended B2HELP Grantees requires data regarding the Outstanding Balance of the recommended grantees that will be used for the ranking and evaluation process. Since B2HELP shall prioritize students in private HEIs and students in public HEIs shall be considered only when there are still remaining unutilized fund, inquiry with the scholarship-in-charge disclosed that CHED ROXI verbally instructed them that for public HEIs, payments to the approved-grantees will be limited only to their outstanding balance or P5,000.00 whichever is lower, hence the approved list showed that several students were granted less than P5,000.00 corresponding to their actual remaining/outstanding balances with the College as of 2nd Semester of AY 2019-2020. 



Section VIII of the aforementioned guideline states that partner institutions found to violate any provision in the CMO shall, after compliance with due process, be required to return the full amount given to them. Provided, that sanction/s imposed against the HEIs for violation/s committed under the CMO shall be without prejudice to the interest of the concerned students.



Recommendations:

	

In view of the foregoing, we recommended Management to:	



1)	Direct the Head of the Financial Assistance Scholarship and Studentship Unit to coordinate with CHED ROXI to address the observation noted and reconcile both records or return the amount of the grant to CHED RO XI due to violations of the provision in the CMO, such as the failure to thoroughly screen the grantees because 22 of them were granted subsidy/allowance even if not enrolled in the first semester of AY 2020-2021; and



2)	Direct further the Head of the Financial Assistance Scholarship and Studentship Unit to strictly adhere to the provisions of the scholarship guidelines, and always secure written communication (if possible) for instructions not within/stipulated in the guidelines.



Management’s Comment:



	The Head of the Financial Assistance Scholarship and Studentship Unit acknowledged the observation and immediately communicated to the CHED ROXI to address the observation.



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



	The Audit Team commended the proactive response of the Management and reiterated on the strict adherence to the scholarship guidelines.





Non-submission of Budget and Financial Accountability Reports as of January 30, 2021



22)	The Budget and the Accounting Sections failed to submit the final, complete and duly signed 4th Quarter Budget and Financial Accountability Reports (BFARs) for FY 2020 contrary to Section 4.3 of COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2019-1 and Sections 90 and 91 of the General Provisions of Fiscal Year 2020 General Appropriations Act, thus preventing the Auditor from conducting timely review and suggesting corrective measures as are appropriate and warranted. 



	Section 4.3 of the COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2019-1 dated January 01, 2019, otherwise known as Updated Guidelines Relative to Budget and Financial Accountability Reports (BFARs) Starting FY 2019 provides that:

	The budget section explained that they failed to complete the encoding in the URS as of report date because the system is now under maintenance to give way to the on-going online submission of budget proposal for FY 2022. They explained further that the unwanted exposure to a COVID-19 positive employee and the prompt declaration of Work-From-Home Scheme starting 5 P.M. of January 8, 2021 (Friday) also caused them not to complete the encoding in the system. On the contrary, we have observed that although the official deadline of the reports was January 30, 2021, SUCs were scheduled to encode in the URS on the 8th to 9th of January 2021, thus the BFARs working papers would have been completed already before January 8, 2021 and may be encoded in the URS even under a Work-From-Home Arrangement, but none was performed.



	After 14-day mandatory home quarantine, the College resumed office on January 26, 2021 on skeletal basis, yet BFARs were still not completely encoded, and thus marked as on a “pending” status. Due to the lapse of the prescribed deadline, as stipulated in DBM BC 2018-9 that encoding access at the URS by departments/agencies/government entities concerned shall be automatically disabled before or beyond the respective scheduled dates, more so that online submission of budget proposal for FY 2022 per DBM NBM No. 138 is already on-going.



	Section 8 of the COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2019-1 dictates that failure to submit reports required under the Circular shall be subject to the provisions of Section 57, Chapter 6, Book VI of Executive Order No. 292 (Administrative Code of 1987) that reads:

	

SECTION 57. Failure to Submit Reports.—Failure on the part of agency heads, chief accountants, budget officers, cashiers, disbursing officers, administrative and personnel officers, and other responsible officers of departments, bureaus, offices and agencies to submit trial balances, work and financial plans, special budgets, reports of operation and income, plans, special budgets, reports of operation and income, current agency plantilla of personnel and such other reports as may be necessary and required by the Department of Budget shall automatically cause the suspension of payment of their salaries until they have complied with the requirements of the Department of Budget. No appropriation authorized in the General Appropriations Act shall be made available to pay the salary of any official or employee who violates the provisions of this section, in addition to any disciplinary action that may be instituted against such erring official or employee.



 Lastly, the foregoing observation hindered the Audit Team from conducting timely review of budget reports, communicate possible deficiencies and suggest corrective measures as are appropriate and warranted.



Recommendations:



We recommended that Management:



1)	Immediately encode the Budget and Financial Accountability Reports in the URS, once already accessible;



2)	Immediately furnish a copy of the final, completed, and duly signed BFARs to DBM, COA, and to BTr; and



3)	Strictly observe the timely submission of BFARs pursuant to the COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2019-1 dated January 01, 2019 and pursuant to the particular General Provisions of the General Appropriations Act. 



Management’s Comment:



The Budget Unit explained that they were challenged to meet the deadlines because of the series of Work-From-Home pronouncements and departmental lockdown declarations due to possible exposure to a COVID19 victim, and some system maintenance that caused them difficulty to access.



BFARs were submitted on February 17, 2021.



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



The Audit Team commended the Budget Office on the submission of the BFARs but reminded them to strictly observe the timely submission of the budget reports so that the Audit Team could communicate possible deficiencies and suggest corrective measures as are appropriate and warranted.





Failure to Request for Relief from Accountability within 30 Days



23)	The College failed to request for relief from accountability within 30 days from the occurrence of loss for the death of two swine animals with an acquisition cost of P15,000.00, contrary to Section 73 of the PD 1445, otherwise known as the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines. 



Section 73 of the Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 or the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines provides that:



Credit for loss occurring in transit or due to casualty or force majeure.



(1) When a loss of government funds or property occurs while they are in transit or the loss is caused by fire, theft, or other casualty or force majeure, the officer accountable therefor or having custody thereof shall immediately notify the Commission or the auditor concerned and, within thirty days or such longer period as the Commission or auditor may in the particular case allow, shall present his application for relief, with the available supporting evidence. Whenever warranted by the evidence credit for the loss shall be allowed. An officer who fails to comply with this requirement shall not be relieved of liability or allowed credit for any loss in the settlement of his accounts. (emphasis supplied)



(2) The Commission shall promulgate rules and regulations to implement the provisions of this section. 



	COA Memorandum No. 92-751 dated February 24, 1992, prescribes the Documentation on Petition/Requests for Relief from Accountability and directs that the following requirements are first duly complied with and that the documents called for thereunder accompany the pertinent requests for relief to be submitted to the Commission, to wit:



1)	The  basic notice of loss to be filed immediately  after the discovery of the loss and the request  for  relief from accountability which should be filed by the  proper accountable officer within the reglementary period of 30 days  from the occurrence of the loss, with the  Auditor concerned or the Commission, as the case may be.



	1)	In case of delay in the filing of the aforesaid notice and request, satisfactory explanation or the reason(s) for such delay should be submitted, after which the reasons/explanation given should be verified or confirmed by the Auditor concerned.



	2)	If the occurrence of the loss has also been reported to other police agencies, like the N.B.I., C.I.S., etc., the progress/final investigation report thereon should be submitted.



2)	Copy of the Investigation, Inventory and Inspection report of the proper COA personnel on the facts and circumstances surrounding the loss;



3)	Affidavit or Sworn Statement of the proper accountable officer on the facts and circumstances surrounding the said loss, supported by the Affidavit of two  (2) disinterested  persons  who have personal knowledge of such fact of loss;



4)	Comment and/or recommendation of the Agency Head concerned on the request;



5)	Comment and/or recommendation of the COA Director/OIC and/or Unit Head on the  propriety  of  the  request, together with a full statement of material facts;



6)	Exact or accurate amount of government cash or book value of the property, subject of the request for relief;



7)	Memorandum Receipts covering the properties subject of the request, if any; and



8)	A categorical determination by the Director/Auditor concerned on the absence of fault or negligence on the part of the accountable officer in the handling, safekeeping, etc. of the funds and properties under his custody as evidenced by a recital of the precautionary/security measures adopted to protect or safeguard them and the like.



Additionally, in case of the death of large cattle and other livestock:



1)	Certificate of Death of the large cattle issued by the proper official, duly verified by the Auditor concerned; and

2)	Necropsy report of the proper Veterinarian, if any.



On January 28, 2021, the Audit Team was informed by the property officer on the loss of two swine animals last January 3 and 4, 2021, with an acquisition costs of P5,000.00 and P10,000.00 per property card, respectively. As of February 9, 2021, the Audit Team did not receive any application for request for relief of accountability, more than 35 days from the occurrence of the actual loss.



Inquiry with the farm-in-charge disclosed that he is not aware of the aforementioned guidelines and further declared that another swine died on February 6, 2021, and has already been buried. 



As a matter of procedure, the officer accountable for any government property or having custody thereof is required to give notice to the Commission on Audit. The filing of such notice immediately upon occurrence of the loss or within the reglementary period of thirty (30) days therefrom is a condition precedent to the grant of relief. The requirement is mandatory, hence, if the application for relief is filed beyond the 30-day period, the same cannot be entertained unless the delay is satisfactorily explained. The rationale for this strict requirement is to enable the Commission to conduct its own investigation of the reported loss while the clues are still fresh to satisfy itself that the alleged loss or other casualty had actually occurred. In addition to the Notice, there must be sufficient evidence of loss, and it must be established that the loss was not on account of the negligence or fault of the accountable officer (Francisco S. Tantuico, Jr., State Audit Code Annotated, page 408).



The justification of the accountable officer that he is not aware of a ruling that there is a need to apply for relief from property accountability is not meritorious. Ignorance of the law excuses no one from compliance therewith (Article 3, New Civil Code). Moreover, it has been clearly ruled that "[A]s an accountable officer, respondent cannot profess ignorance of the above-cited circular for it is required that he must update his knowledge with whatever laws or any memorandum circular that may be issued by the Commission on Audit." (Office of the Court Administrator vs. Judge Deogracias K. del Rosario, A.M. No. MTJ-94-949, December 13, 1994).



The 30-day period within which to file the Notice of Loss cannot be dismissed as a mere procedural rule. "Well-rooted is the principle that procedural rules are not to be belittled or dismissed simply because their non-observance may have resulted in prejudice to a party's substantive rights. Like all rules, they are required to be followed except only for the most persuasive of reasons when they may be relaxed to relieve a litigant of an injustice not commensurate with the degree of his thoughtlessness in not complying with the procedure prescribed" (Ysmael Zepeda vs. Court of Appeals and Tobacco Bel-Air Realty Corp., G.R. No. 139286, August 16, 1999). 



Recommendations:



In view of the foregoing, we recommended that Management:



1)	Immediately submit the application of request for relief from accountability with complete documentation;



2)	Provide enough and valid justification on the failure to submit the application of request for relief from accountability with complete documentation within 30 days from the occurrence of the actual loss; and



3)	Be adept with Section 73 of PD 1445, COA Memorandum No. 92-751 and other related guidelines and issuances.



Management’s Comment:



	The personnel-in-charge acknowledged the observation and submitted the request for relief from accountability praying to be considered since it was filed beyond the 30-day requirement from the occurrence of the loss. The Personnel-in-Charge shared that he was unaware of the guidelines.



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



	The Audit Team commended the Management on the proactive response and reminded to be adept with Section 73 of PD 1445, COA Memorandum No. 92-751 and other related guidelines and issuances relevant to the request for relief from accountability. 





Unliquidated Cash Advances 



24)	Despite the prior year’s recommendations, the College did not strictly enforce the control over the grant and liquidation of cash advances as prescribed in Section 89 of Presidential Decree No. 1445 and pertinent provision of COA Circular No. 97-002, which resulted in the unliquidated cash advances totaling to P269,292.28 as at December 31, 2020.



		Section 89 of PD 1445 provides limitations on cash advances as:



	xxx. A cash advance shall be reported on and liquidated as soon as the purpose for which it was given has been served. No additional cash advance shall be allowed to any official or employee unless the previous cash advance given to him is first settled or a proper accounting thereof is made.

	

		Items 5.8 to 5.9 of COA Circular No. 97-002 clearly states that:

		

	5.8 All cash advances shall be fully liquidated at the end of each year. Except for petty cash fund, the AO shall refund any unexpended balance to the Cashier/Collecting who will issue the necessary official receipt. (Underscoring ours)

	

	5.9 At the start of an ensuing year, a new cash advance may be granted provided that a list of expenses against the previous cash advance is submitted.  However, when no liquidation of the previous cash advance is received on or before January 20, the accountant shall cause the withholding of the AO’s salary.    

	

		For Calendar Year 2020, the outstanding cash advances are broken down as follows (Please refer to Page 234):

	

	   Advances to Operating Expenses

	P      81,393.20 

	   Advances for Payroll

	    28,875.00 

	   Advances for Officers and Employees

	  159,024.08 

	                         Total

	        P   269,292.28 

	

	Inquiry with the Accountant disclosed that communications were made to the personnel concerned to hasten the liquidation of their respective cash advances, yet they still have not completely liquidated as at December 31, 2020. Hence, contrary to the aforementioned Circular which states that “All cash advances shall be fully liquidated at the end of each year,” the COA Office already issued demand letters to the Accountable Officer concerned requesting for the immediate liquidation of their outstanding cash advances.  

	

		Moreover, the liquidation of Dr. Edna B. Bagcal received by the Accounting Office on April 5, 2019 amounting to P144,000.00 was not recorded in the book. The Accountant explained that the liquidation report and supporting documents were misplaced. 

	

		Also, several Subsidiary Ledgers have unaccounted balances and three of which ended with negative balances as at year-end, viz:

		

	Accountable Officers

	Amount

	Tuballa, Vicente Nino

	(3,125.00)

	Ceniza, Rose Anelyn V.

	(0.60) 

	Macusi, Edison Roi D.

	(600.00) 

	Unaccounted

	     9,320.00 

	

		Lastly, the Management is reminded with the Civil Service Commission Resolution No. 12-00103 promulgated on January 12, 2012 and reiterated under CSC Memorandum Circular No. 12, s.2012 dated July 10 2012 which provides:

	

			“Rule V. Administrative Liability



“Section 8. The failure of an Accountable Officer to render an account in full within the periods prescribed and after formal demand shall constitute the administrative offense of Gross Neglect of Duty punishable by dismissal from the service for the first offense. Full liquidation/settlement/payment of the subject cash advance outside the given periods shall constitute the offense of Simple Neglect of Duty punishable by suspension from the service for one (1) month and one (1) day to six (6) months for the first offense, and dismissal from the service for the second offense.”



Recommendations:



	In view of the foregoing, we recommended that Management:

	

1)			Compel the immediate liquidation by the Accountable Officers of their outstanding cash advances; 

		

2)			Direct the Accountant to locate and record the liquidation report of Dr. Edna B. Bagcal; 



3)			Direct further the Accountant to trace and effect appropriate adjustment for cash advances with negative balances and the unaccounted balance of P9,320.00; and



4)			Strictly adhere to Section 89 of PD No. 1445, various provisions of COA Circular No. 97-002 in granting cash advances to employees and in monitoring their subsequent liquidation, especially when it is close to year-end.



Management’s Comment:



	The Accounting Unit acknowledged the observation and committed to strictly enforce the liquidation of all cash advances as at year-end. The Accounting Unit committed further to locate the liquidation records/reports of Dr. Bagcal.



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



The Audit Team reminded again the Management to strictly adhere to Section 89 of PD No. 1445, various provisions of COA Circular No. 97-002 in granting cash advances to employees and in monitoring their subsequent liquidation, especially when it is close to year-end.



Also, the non-submission of the Accounting Unit of the liquidation reports of Dr. Bagcal amounting to P144,000.00 hampered the Audit Team in auditing the same. Hence, scope limitation.

	

	

Gender and Development



Unendorsed GAD CY 2020 GAD Plan and Budget



25)	Failure of the Gender and Development (GAD) Focal Person to complete the online resubmission of the GAD Plan and Budget for FY 2020, after the review conducted by CHED and PCW, caused the College’s GPB to be marked as unendorsed, thus casting doubt on the appropriateness of the GAD Programs, Activities and Projects (PAPs) and their corresponding budgets in the total amount of P24,566,350.00.



Section 8 of the Philippine Commission on Women (PCW) National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) and Department of Budget and Management (DBM) Joint Circular (JC) No. 2012-01, also known as the Guidelines for the Preparation of Annual Gender and Development (GAD) Plans and Budgets and Accomplishment Reports to Implement the Magna Carta of Women provides that:



8.0 	SUBMISSION, REVIEW AND ENDORSEMENT OF AGENCY GAD PLANS AND BUDGETS



8.1	Pursuant to Section 37A.1 of the MCW-IRR, all agencies, offices, bureaus and all government instrumentalities and others concerned shall formulate their annual GPBs within the context of their mandates.



		8.1.1 Xxx



8.1.2 SUCs with several constituent units shall observe the same process of submission. The Commission on Higher Education (CHED) or its designated regional offices or gender resource centers shall review the submissions of SUCs and forward the same to PCW for endorsement to DBM.



8.2 The GFPS of the agency shall review all submitted GPBs and as needed, provide comments or recommendations for revision. Agency review of GPBs shall focus on the alignment of the GAD plan with the GAD agenda and the correctness and alignment of the entries in each column of the GPB template, e.g. if the proposed activities respond to the identified gender issue or cause of the issue, the issues are correctly identified or formulated, if there are clear indicators and targets, if the proposed budget is realistic, if the number of proposed activities are doable within the year, among others. The GFPS shall then submit the final GPBs and the corresponding GAD ARs to PCW for review and endorsement to DBM.



Moreover, section 4 of the PCW MC No. 2019-02 dated August 01, 2019 on the Preparation and Online Submission of Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 Gender and Development (GAD) Plans and Budgets prescribes the following schedules, viz:



August to September 2019

Agencies prepare and submit their FY 2020 GPB to PCW

October 14, 2019

October 31, 2019

PCW reviews submitted GPBs.

August – November 2019

Agencies shall resubmit their GPBs, if there are revisions to be made.



PCW endorses acceptable GPBs.



	Excerpts from the conversation between the GAD focal person and PCW representative disclosed that on November 01, 2019, the PCW returned the GPB of the College for the former to effect whatever corrections/ remarks made. However, the GAD focal person failed to resubmit the revised 2020 GPB, thus marked as “unendorsed” in the Gender Mainstreaming Monitoring System (GMMS). This impedes reliance upon the prepared GPB for FY 2020 that will be used as reference in the audit and review of the corresponding GAD Accomplishment Report for FY 2020.



	Hence, the GAD Fund in the total amount of P24,566,350.00 (under by P75,000.00) which is equivalent to at least five percent (5%) of P492,827,000.00 total appropriation of the Agency and the corresponding utilization thereof or GAD PAPs attributed on the total appropriations of the Agency, which totaled P26,738,989.00 could not be properly evaluated as to PAPs’ appropriateness/applicability because there were no duly endorsed/authorized PAPs by the proper authority. 



Recommendations:



In view of the foregoing, we recommended Management to:	



1)	Immediately submit a copy of the supporting documents/references used in the formulation and preparation of the corrected FY 2020 GPB; 



2)	Retrieve and immediately submit a corrected copy based on the corrections/remarks made by the CHED and PCW in the proposed FY 2020 GPB; and



3)	Direct the GAD Focal Person to strictly comply with PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01, PCW MC No. 2019-02, and other PCW-issued guidelines particularly on the preparation and online submission of GAD Plan and Budget. 



Management’s Comment:



	The Director for Gender and Development acknowledged the observation, submitted a corrected copy of the GAD Plan and Budget but review notes of CHED and PCW, if any, were not attached. The Management committed to comply with the guidelines on CY 2021 GPB.
