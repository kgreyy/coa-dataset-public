OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

 

A. Financial and Compliance Audit  
 

Unrecorded issuances of semi-expendable 

 

1. In HSAC-NLRO, the issuance to end-users of various semi-expendable 
furniture and fixtures totaling P868,710.00 were not recognized in the books of 

accounts, overstating the account Semi-Expendable Furniture and Fixtures 

and understating the account Semi-Expendable Furniture, Fixture and Books 

Expenses. 
 

Section 10, Chapter 8, Volume I of GAM for NGAs provides that semi-

expendable property shall be recognized as expense upon issue to the end-user.  

 

During the year, the agency purchased various semi-expendable furniture and 

fixtures totaling P868,710.00, with the following details: 

 

Particulars Unit Cost (P) Amount (P) 

Office table, custom steel (30 pcs) 14,950.00 448,500.00 

Executive Chair, Junior Executive (30 pcs) 6,000.00 180,000.00 

Steel Visitorial Chairs, 5-person capacity (4 units) 11,000.00 44,000.00 

Filing cabinets, steel, lateral, 4 drawers (8 units) 12,450.00 99,600.00 

Aluminum Door Sliding Door Panel (1 pc) 14,985.00 14,985.00 

Table Shield-COVID-19 5,187.50 10,375.00 

Top Glass 1,700.00 1,700.00 

Curtain Rod (3 pcs) 850.00 2,550.00 

Office Chair, chrome base, gas lift (10 pcs) 3,800.00 38,000.00 

Office Table without drawers (2 pcs) 5,000.00 10,000.00 

Power Signs and Ads Signage (2 units) 9,500.00 19,000.00 

     Total  868,710.00 

 

Verification and physical inspection revealed that the aforementioned semi-

expendable properties have already been issued to end-users during the year, 

however, their issuance was not recognized in the books of accounts inconsistent 

with Section 10, Chapter 8, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs, resulting in the 

overstatement of the account Semi-Expendable Furniture and Fixtures and 

understatement of the account Semi-Expendable Furniture, Fixture and Books 

Expenses by P868,710.00. 

 

Moreover, no documents were prepared in the issuance of the semi-

expendable items i.e., Requisition and Issue Slip (RIS), Inventory Custodian Slip 

(ICS) and Report of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI) as enumerated under 

Section 17, Chapter 8, Volume I of the same Manual. 

 

 



 

39 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 

  

a. instruct the Regional Acting Accountant to prepare adjusting entry to 
record the issuance of the semi-expendable furniture and fixtures 

consistent with the provision of the GAM for NGAs by debiting the 

Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) account and crediting the Semi-

Expendable Furniture and Fixtures account; and 

 

b. henceforth, observe the proper accounting policies, procedures and 
preparation of documents in the issuance of semi-expendable properties. 
 

Management comment: 

 

The Property/Supply Officer would be advised to prepare the RIS, ICS and 

RSMI for the issuance of inventory items to end-users as basis of the Accountant to 

prepare the necessary journal entry to record such issuance in the books of 

accounts. All unissued semi-expendables will still be accounted as inventory until 

such time that they will be issued to end-users.   

 

 

Unreliable balance of PPE 

 

2. In HSAC-CO, ENCRO, NLRO, BRO, WVRO, CVRO and SMRO, the 
reliability and accuracy of the carrying amount of their PPE accounts totaling 

P1,336,899,996.19 is doubtful due to the: (a) failure to update/renew PARs and 

issue PTRs for the transfers to DHSUD of PPE totaling P35,631,413.44; (b) 

discrepancy of P7,554,192.25 between the GL and the RPCPPE; and (c) failure 

to establish the existence of the recorded PPE balance totaling P5,985,875.85.  

 

a) Failure to update/renew PARs and issue PTRs - P35,631,413.44 
 

Sound property management dictates that appropriate steps should be taken by 

Management to manage its assets, which includes standard procedures, as provided 

in the GAM for NGAs.  

 

Section 21, Chapter 10, Volume 1 of the GAM for NGAs states that based on 

approved RIS, the Supply and/or Property Custodian shall prepare the PAR to 

support the issue of property to end-user. The PAR shall be renewed at least every 

three years or every time there is a change in accountability or custodianship of the 

property.  

 

Further, Section 42(j) of the same Chapter of the GAM for NGAs describes 

the PTR as a form that is used every time there is a transfer of property from an 

outgoing officer to his successor or from one accountable officer/employee to 

another of the same or another entity. 

 



 

40 

 

Review of the property records/Inventory Count Form showed that various 

PPE totaling P35,631,413.44 were already in the custody and possession of 

DHSUD employees who transferred from HLURB pursuant to the implementation 

of the RA No. 11201 but without proper cancellation of PARs and corresponding 

issuance of PTRs, inconsistent with the afore-mentioned Sections 21 and 42(j).  

 

The details are as follows: 

 
Regional Office Amount (P) 

Central Office  6,682,165.95 

ENCRO 4,173,466.87 

NLRO  7,214,306.25 

BRO 4,940,334.84 

WVRO 4,594,589.01 

SMRO 8,026,550.52 

Total  35,631,413.44 

 

In HSAC-CO: 

 

It was noted that 21 employees were transferred to DHSUD and brought with 

them their assigned properties with a total cost of P6,682,165.95 without securing 

clearance from the agency to relieve them from their accountabilities in their former 

office. Unaware of the circumstances, the issued PARs were not cancelled and the 

PTRs were not prepared by the General Services Division (GSD).  

 

It was gathered that these properties are serviceable and are being used by the 

concerned employees in their new post in DHSUD. The Audit Team did not have 

information whether HSAC-CO still needs these properties for their day-to-day 

operation. Item 4, Section V of COA Circular No. 89-296 dated January 27, 1989 

provides that the transfer of property to another government agency without cost is 

allowed upon authorization of the head of agency and upon accomplishment of an 

Invoice Receipt of Property. 

 

In HSAC-ENCRO: 

 

The former Property Custodian of HLURB disclosed the following:  

 

a. Pursuant to the implementation of RA No. 11201, various employees of the 
former HLURB were transferred/assigned to DHSUD bringing with them 

their issued properties to be used in their new work assignments without 

observing the proper procedure of PAR cancellation and PTR issuance.  

b. Said employees were issued their clearance despite non-cancellation of 
PARs.   

c. Transfer of PPE to DHSUD-ENCRO was done in February 2021 but the 
Regional Accountant did not record them yet in the books of accounts 

because the former Property Custodian of HLURB prepared only the 



 

41 

 

Invoice Receipt of Property forgetting the issuance of PTR, and they lack 

the date of transfer.  

d. The PARs of the PPE with the HSAC-ENCRO employees are not updated. 
e. There was no proper instruction from the HSAC-CO for the disposition of 

the properties from HLURB. Accordingly, the formal transfer of the 

properties to DHSUD-CO and IV-B, together with the update of PARs and 

issuance of PTRs will be done during this year.  

f. Only in May 2021 was the agency able to designate a Property Officer. 
Before that, HSAC-ENCRO has no designated Property Officer to monitor 

and facilitate the transfer of PPEs. 

 

In HSAC-NLRO: 

 

The issued PARs were not renewed/updated despite changes in the agency. 

The new Property Custodian explained that the PARs were not properly turned over 

by the previous Property Officer.  

 

Further, the movement of the following equipment totaling P72,234.09 from 

HSAC-NLRO to DHSUD-STRO were not accounted for: 

 
Description Property Number Amount (P) 

Laptop 23-15-013 37,898.00 

PC Desktop, Lenovo PCO 7XRBN 17,236.09 

Epson Printer 23-16-06 17,100.00 

Total   72,234.09 

 

We were informed that these equipment were issued to an official who was 

later assigned to DHSUD-STRO bringing with her these equipment issued to her 

but without proper issuance of PTR. These PPE items were still recorded in the 

books of HSAC-NLRO. 

 

In HSAC-BRO: 

 

It was noted that properties recorded in the books of accounts totaling 

P4,940,334.84 were not found at station since they were already transferred to 

DHSUD without the PTR being prepared and issued.  

 

In HSAC-WVRO: 

 

Various employees transferred to DHSUD bringing with them their assigned 

properties totaling P4,594,589.01 without securing clearance of accountability from 

their former office; hence, it was unable to cancel the issued PARs and prepare the 

corresponding PTRs.  

 

Inquiry with Management revealed that there have been no official 

instructions from the HSAC-CO regarding the disposition of the HLURB 

properties.  



 

42 

 

In HSAC-SMRO: 

 

Verification of the distribution of the PPE showed that all the PPE and 

computer software previously under HLURB totaling P9,127,202.85 and 

P143,600.00, respectively, were recorded as transferred to HSAC books of 

accounts. However, further verification revealed that only P1,100,652.33 worth of 

PPE were in the possession of the HSAC as evidenced by the issued PARs dated 

September 30, 2020. 

 

The computer software and the remaining PPE items totaling P143,600.00 and 

P8,026,550.52, respectively, were physically transferred to DHSUD but without 

PTRs being issued; hence, the recording of the transfer was not done.  

 

Inquiry with the former Acting Accountant revealed that she was verbally 

instructed by HSAC-CO to record to the HSAC all the PPE balances of the former 

HLURB to the HSAC. She, however, failed to record the eventual transfer of the 

bulk of properties to DHSUD.  

 

The afore-mentioned deficiencies are clear manifestations of weak property 

management that put the agency at risk of incurring loss and misuse of the subject 

PPE due to lack of accountability trail.  Moreover, pertinent officials were shown to 

be negligent and remiss of their duties and responsibilities.  

  

Consequently, the accuracy of the carrying amount of the PPE accounts could 

not be relied upon, affecting the fair presentation of the financial statements. 

Paragraph 27 of IPSAS 1 and Section 15, Chapter 2, Volume I of the GAM for 

NGAs, require that:  

 

The Financial Statements shall present fairly the financial position, 

financial performance and cash flows of an entity.  Fair 

presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of 

transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with the 

definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, 

and expenses set out in IPSAS. xxx 

 

b) Discrepancy between the GL and the RPCPPE - P7,554,192.25 
 

Section 42(g), Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs describes the 

RPCPPE as the form to report the physical count and condition of PPE by type as at 

a given date, including those which are unrecorded and those which could not be 

accounted for. It shows the balance of PPE per property cards (PC) and per count 

and the shortage/overage, if any. It shall be rendered by the Inventory Committee, 

on its yearly physical count of properties owned by the entity.   

 

Section 42 requires that the Chief Accountant shall maintain the ledger card 

(LC) for each category of PPE. The LC shall be kept to record promptly the 



 

43 

 

acquisition, description, custody, estimated useful life, depreciation, impairment 

loss, disposal and other information about the asset. For check and balance, the 

Property and Supply Office/Unit shall likewise maintain PC of PPE in their custody 

to account for the receipt and disposition of the same. The balance per PC shall be 

reconciled with the LC. They shall also be reconciled with the PAR. 

 

In HSAC-NLRO, comparison of the GL and the RPCPPE disclosed a 

discrepancy of P7,554,192.25 as of December 31, 2020, with the following details: 

 

PPE Accounts 
Amount (P) 

Per GL Per RPCPPE Discrepancy 

Office Equipment 926,865.18 20,700.00 906,165.18 

Information and Communication 

Technology Equipment 

 

4,453,970.77 

 

888,958.89 

 

3,565,011.88 

Communication Equipment 169,692.19 28,000.00 141,692.19 

Technical and Scientific Equipment 141,000.00 20,700.00 120,300.00 

Motor Vehicles 5,069,260.00 2,311,380.00 2,757,880.00 

Furniture and Fixtures 98,827.00 161,970.00 63,143.00 

Total  10,859,615.14 3,431,708.89 7,554,192.25 

 

Inquiry with the Accountant and the Property Officer revealed that the 

discrepancy was due to the inclusion in the GL of properties not found at station, 

since they are already in the custody and possession of DHSUD, totaling 

P7,214,306.25, as discussed in letter (a). It was explained that as of year-end, the 

Asset Management Sub-Committee of DHSDU-CO had no final decision yet as to 

the partition and transfer of assets between DHSUD and HSAC. Further, according 

to the Property Officer, who have the details of PPE, there was no proper turnover 

of accountabilities and records by the previous officers of the former HLURB.  

 

Section 43.2 of Rule VI of the Transitory Provisions of RA No. 11201 

provides, among others, the allocation of equipment, funds and other assets, to wit: 

 

The allocation of existing equipment, funds, and other assets of 

HUDCC and HLURB shall be subject to the distribution of 

personnel to the Department and the Commission. 

 

Inquiry, however, on the reason why the Accountant was unable to segregate 

yet the PPE, disclosed that a separate DHSUD Department Order (DO) No. 2020-

008 dated July 23, 2020 was issued to facilitate, expedite and ensure the partition 

and actual transfer of assets of the dissolved agencies (HUDCC and HLURB) to the 

DHSUD and HSAC, but which the HSAC-CO refused to recognize and did not 

concur with the DO instruction; therefore, not obligated to follow it.  

 

c) Failure to establish the existence of PPE totaling P5,985,875.85 
 

Section 38, Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs provides for a 

periodic physical count of PPE, which shall be done annually and presented on the 



 

44 

 

RPCPPE (Appendix 71) as at December 31 of each year. This shall be submitted to 

the Auditor concerned not later than January 31 of the following year. Equipment 

found at station and losses discovered during the physical count shall be reported to 

the Accounting Division/Unit for proper accounting/recording. 

 

In HSAC-CVRO, review of records and inquiries made disclosed that the 

annual physical count of PPE for CY 2020 was not conducted, contrary to the 

mentioned Section 38, because they have been preoccupied with other functions left 

by personnel after the implementation of RA No. 11201.,  

 

Physical count, which is required annually, is an indispensable procedure for 

checking the integrity of property custodianship; hence, such failure of the agency 

to establish the existence of PPE totaling P5,985,875.85 casted doubt on its 

accuracy. Section 102(1) of PD No. 1445 states that “The head of the agency of the 

government is immediately and primarily responsible for all government funds and 

property pertaining to his agency”. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require:  

 

HSAC-CO, NLRO and WVRO 

 

a. all the employees that were transferred to DHSUD to obtain from the 
agency clearance from fund and property accountabilities; 

 

HSAC-CO, ENCRO, NLRO and WVRO 

 

b. all the employees that were transferred to DHSUD to return their issued 
properties to the Property Officer who, in turn, must update/cancel the 

related PAR, and determine whether subject PPE would be retained by 

the agency or be transferred;  

   

HSAC-NLRO, SMRO 

 

c. the Property Custodian to prepare the list of transferred and turned-over 
properties and submit the same to the Accountant for her reference and 

appropriate action;  
 

HSAC-CO, ENCRO, NLRO, BRO, WVRO and SMRO 

 

d. the Property Custodian to prepare a PTR for the transfer of PPE, and 
update/issue a new PAR to HSAC employees for their issued properties;  

 

HSAC-NLRO, BRO and CVRO 

 

e. Inventory Committee to establish the existence of the recorded PPE 
through periodic conduct of physical count, as prescribed by the GAM for 



 

45 

 

NGAs, or other means/procedures they deem proper to check the integrity 

of property custodianship, and to submit the RPCPPE to the Audit Team; 

 

f. Accountant and the Property Officer to periodically reconcile their 
records; and  

 

HSAC-ENCRO, NLRO, WVRO and SMRO 

 

g. the concerned Accountants to prepare the necessary adjusting entries for 
the transfer of properties to DHSUD.   

 

Management Comment: 

 

In HSAC-ENCRO – 

 

The agency is in the process of preparing the PTR in coordination with 

DHSUD-CO, ENCRO and IV-B to formally transfer the PPE. The PARs are 

likewise being updated and prepared for the issuance to new end-users. The said 

reports will be submitted to the Audit Team once issued and signed by the 

concerned officials and employees. Accordingly, necessary adjusting entries will be 

made upon completion and issuance of the PTRs.    

 

In HSAC-BRO – 

 

The agency is constrained to prepare the PTR, conduct complete physical 

count of all transferred properties, and prepare the RPCPPE pending the approval of 

the guidelines for the transfer of PPE by the Asset Management Division of HSAC-

CO. In the meantime, the Supply/Property Officer was instructed to prepare/renew 

PARs for all properties in the custody of its employees to establish accountability. 

 

In HSAC-WVRO – 

 

The agency will be closely coordinating with DHSUD with regard to the 

official transfer of the properties. The Designated Accountant also informed the 

Audit Team that she will be consulting the HSAC-CO Accountant as to the proper 

accounting treatment of the transfer of properties. 

 

In HSAC-CVRO – 

 

The Supply Officer of former HLURB-CVRO has not yet turned over any 

record pertaining to PPE in December 2020. However, on February 5, 2021, partial 

inventory of PPE was done pending the final decision of the Asset Management in 

the separation/assignment of properties for DHSUD-CVRO and HSAC-CVRO.  

 

Further, with limited staff of the newly reconstituted HSAC-CVRO, 

comprising of four personnel headed by their OIC Chief Regional Adjudicator, OIC 



 

46 

 

Administrative and Finance, one Legal personnel and one Cashier, they will create 

an Inventory Committee, with the OIC Administrative and Finance to act as the 

temporary Supply Officer to conduct the necessary inventory count of PPE in 

accordance with the provisions in the GAM for NGAs and to submit the RPCPPE 

to the Audit Team as soon as possible. 

 

In HSAC-SMRO – 

 

The office will coordinate with DHSUD-SMRO in securing the list of 

properties and its corresponding PARs, and PTRs to determine the amount of PPE 

to be transferred to DHSUD-SMRO and PPE to be retained in HSAC-SMRO 

subject to the guidelines set out by the HSAC-Central Office with regards to 

transfer of PPE. 

 

The Chief Accountant commented during the exit conference on June 17, 

2021 that the transfer of assets is one of the dilemma of the agency especially the 

transfer of PPE. The Secretary, DHSUD issued a department order for the transfer 

of all the properties in the books of DHSUD.  

 

Further, according to the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA 

No. 11201, the real property of HUDCC and HLURB will go the DHSUD and 

HSAC, respectively. Thus, they interpreted that the real and personal properties of 

the HLURB should go to HSAC but until now there is disagreement on the issue 

that needs to be resolved together with the DHSUD. 

 

 

Erroneous computation of amortization 

 

3. In HSAC-CO, the carrying amount of the Computer Software totaling 
P1,512,518.60 was overstated by P185,138.93 due to the erroneous computation 

of its amortization, inconsistent with Section 10, Chapter 12, Volume I of the 

GAM for NGAs, affecting its fair presentation in the financial statements.  

 

Section 10, Chapter 12, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs states that the 

residual value of an intangible shall be assumed to be zero, to wit: 

 

The residual value of an intangible with a finite useful life shall be 

assumed to be zero unless: 

  

a. There is a commitment by a third party to acquire the asset at 
the end of its useful life; or 

 

b. There is an active market for the asset, and: (1) residual value 
can be determined by reference to that market; and (2) it is 

probable that such a market will exist at the end of the asset’s 

useful life.  



 

47 

 

Examination of the Schedule of the account Computer Software disclosed that 

a residual value of five percent was assigned by the Accounting Section in the 

computation of its amortization, in nonconformance with Section 10, Chapter 12, 

Volume I of the GAM for NGAs.  

 

Recomputation of the amortization revealed that the Computer Software’s 

carrying amount of P1,512,518.60 was overstated by P185,138.93 as at December 

31, 2020 due to the erroneous computation of its amortization. Said erroneous 

computation also resulted in the understatement by P50,301.57 and P185,138.93 of 

the amortization expense and the accumulated amortization, respectively, and the 

overstatement of the Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) by P134,837.37. The summary 

is shown below:

     Total  134,837.37 50,301.57 185,138.93 

 

The Chief Accountant disclosed that the Accounting Section overlooked that 

the computer software was assigned a residual value, which lead to the erroneous 

computation of amortization, affecting the fair presentation of the account in the 

financial statements, contrary to Section 15, Chapter 2, Volume I of the GAM for 

NGAs requiring that financial statements shall present fairly the financial position, 

financial performance and cash flows of an entity. 

 

It was also noted that a computer software amounting to P3,468,080.00 has 

remained idle since its acquisition in November 2016; hence, the HSAC-CO was 

unable to realize its expected economic benefits.   

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief 

Accountant to: 

 

a. correct the recorded amortization of the computer software and the 
related Accumulated Amortization, as well as the Accumulated 

Surplus/(Deficit); and 

 

b. henceforth, observe the amortization of intangible assets in accordance 
with the policy provided by the GAM.  



 

48 

 

We further recommended and Management agreed to submit an 

explanation on the non-utilization of the computer software that remained idle 

since its acquisition in November 2016. 

 

Management Comment: 

 

The Chief Accountant prepared Journal Entry Vouchers (JEVs) No. 2021-04-

0087 dated April 30, 2021 for the necessary adjustment of the amortization. Proper 

computation of amortization of intangible assets will be observed in the succeeding 

months. 

 

Regarding the Computer Software, Management explained that in CY 2017, 

the HLURB procured the ArchSys in order to efficiently track, monitor, and 

generate reports on the HLURB’s mandates. Users in its Central Office and 

Regional Field were trained and obstacles encountered were tackled. 

 

However, on February 14, 2019, RA No. 11201 took effect. During the 

transition period, the Asset Management Committee was created to determine 

whether the real and personal properties of the HLURB and the HUDCC, including 

the computer systems, properly belong to DHSUD or HSAC. Until now, the 

Committee is yet to decide as to the ownership of the ArchSys.  

 

Meanwhile, HSAC promulgated its own Rules of Procedures and Internal 

Rules. Consequently, these new rules shall be incorporated into the computer 

system.  

 

After consultation with the information technology experts within and outside 

the HSAC, two options were presented:  

 

1. Remove the regulation and land use planning functions in the system, and 
update the adjudication features to include the new rules; or  

2. Turn over the ArchSys to DHSUD, and HSAC shall create a new system.  
 

There is a very high possibility that the second option is the more viable one. 

The first option entails a much higher cost than the second one. In contrast, a new 

system is more economical, effective, and efficient, given the rapid technological 

changes that happened since the creation of ArchSys, and the significant changes in 

HSAC’s rules of procedure and organizational structure. 

  

During the exit conference on June 17, 2021, the Management explained that 

the ArchSys would be turned over to the DHSUD, and the HSAC will create a new 

system to monitor and track its cases. The decision was arrived at considering all 

factors, such as the technological advancement and the significant changes in 

HSAC’s rules of procedure and organizational structure. The necessary 

documentary requirements to effect the transfer will be coordinated with the 

DHSUD.

Inefficient monitoring and dormant consignation fees 

 

4. The completeness and accuracy of the balance of trust liabilities of HSAC-CO, 
ENCRO and STRO aggregating P94,830,655.81 could not be ascertained 

because of (a) the nonsystematic recordkeeping and monitoring of the 

consignation fees totaling P33,530,568.69 for all cases received in HSAC-CO 

and STRO, contrary to Item 1, Section 111 of PD No. 1445; and (b) the 

inclusion of dormant trust liabilities equivalent to 41.38 percent or 

P32,644,813.32 of HSAC-CO and ENCRO’s trust liabilities of P78,896,643.34. 

 

The following are the Trust Liabilities book balances of the HSAC-CO, 

ENCRO and STRO as of December 31, 2020: 

 
Regional Office Trust Liabilities (P) 

HSAC-CO 17,596,556.22 

ENCRO 61,300,087.12 

STRO 15,934,012.47 

Total 94,830,655.81 

 

a) Nonsystematic recordkeeping and monitoring 
   

The agency is receiving consignation in the form of cash and/or surety bonds 

for cases filed, and refund the same upon its final disposition. The consignation fees 

are recorded under the Trust Liabilities account. 

 

Consignation is defined in civil law as a deposit, which debtor makes for the 

thing that he owes, into the hands of a third person, and under the authority of a 

court of justice. In the case of the HSAC, a certain amount of consignation is made 

by a party involved in a litigation case lodged in the agency, upon the order of an 

arbiter, as a manifestation of readiness and ability to comply and perform the 

obligation under a contract. 

                          

 Item 1, Section 111 of PD No. 1445 states that: 

 

The accounts of an agency shall be kept in such detail as is 

necessary to meet the needs of the agency and at the same time be 

adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or control 

agencies of the government. 

 

In HSAC-CO and STRO, the recorded consignation fees totaling 

P33,530,568.69 could not be relied upon because of nonsystematic recordkeeping 

and monitoring of cases received as demonstrated by the following: 

 

1) The Office of the Executive Clerk/Chief Administrative Officer maintains 
the records of the cases received and disposed; however, they fail to 

include in their record the corresponding amount of consignation fees; 



 

50 

 

hence, from the Accounting records, the comparison of balances could not 

be done. 

 

2) The Chief/Acting Accountant is not being furnished with the copies of 
resolved cases; hence, the immediate refund of consignation fees is 

impeded. 

 

It was, however, observed that should the Office of the Executive 

Clerk/Chief Administrative Officer need to report the status or progress of 

each case, it could be readily provided since the dockets they maintain 

contain supporting documents that show the events that has taken place in 

handling of the case, from its inception up to its final disposition. The 

dockets also serve as monitoring tool in determining the latest 

development of each case being handled. 

 

3) In HSAC-CO, the dockets of the unresolved cases and the dockets of 
resolved cases are filed in different floors. 

 

4) In HSAC-STRO, the dockets of unresolved cases and dockets of resolved 
cases are filed in the same office premise, however, the agency does not 

maintain an inventory report or lists of both unresolved and resolved 

cases; hence, their completeness could not be ascertained. 

   

The preceding deficiencies pose difficulty on the part of the Chief/Acting 

Accountant in reconciling the balance of the Trust Liabilities account versus the 

corresponding number of unresolved/resolved cases. 

 

b) Inclusion of dormant trust liabilities 
 

COA Circular No. 97-001 dated February 5, 1997 provides the guidelines and 

procedures on the proper disposition/closure of dormant accounts. Dormant 

accounts refer to individual or group of accounts which balances remained non-

moving for more than five years. Section III.A.10 of the said Circular provides for 

the write-off of dormant accounts, to wit: 

 

If the analysis/review of the accounts/funds is not possible due to 

absence of records and documents, the agency head concerned 

should request for write-off and/or adjustment of account balances 

from the COA, supported by: 

 

10.1. List of available records and extent of validation made on 
the accounts; and 

10.2. Certification and reasons why the books of 
accounts/records, financial statements/schedules and 

supporting vouchers/ documents cannot be located. 

 



 

51 

 

Further, Section III.B provides that the Chief Accountant is required to 

review, analyze and reconcile the dormant accounts together with the other related 

accounts in the trial balance, and prepare the adjusting journal entry for the 

settlement of all liabilities and/or reversion/adjustment of the same to the 

Cumulative Results of Operations (CRO) account, if necessary.  

 

Review and examination of the Aging of the Trust Liabilities account as of 

December 31, 2020 showed the following dormant consignation fees totaling 

P32,644,813.32:

2011-2015 13,941,468.78 12,258,986.14 26,200,454.92 

Total 13,941,468.78 18,703,344.54 32,644,813.32 

 

In HSAC-CO, the P13,941,468.78 represents 79.23 percent of its account 

balance of P17,596,556.22. This has been dormant for more than five years but no 

proper disposition/closure thereof has been done. Moreover, it was disclosed that 

the dormancy was a result of deficient recordkeeping and monitoring of cases 

received.  

 

Likewise, in HSAC-ENCRO, the observation on long outstanding 

consignation fees has already been pointed out since CY 2016 AAR on HLURB. To 

address the issue, the Management created a team tasked to perform the 

reconciliation of the accounts between the Accounting records and the list of 

resolved and unresolved cases. Each docket was examined to determine the status 

of the case and evaluated whether it is due for refund. In case of resolved cases, 

letters were prepared and sent to the concerned parties informing them that their 

consigned monies are available for refund. Thus, various refunds were made during 

CYs 2017 to 2018.  

 

Since dormant amounts still remained, the observation was reiterated in the 

CY 2019 AAR on HLURB; thus, in CY 2020, the Accounting Section has 

conducted thorough review and analysis of the details of the account. Management 

have instructed the Regional Accountant to prepare aging schedule to determine the 

remaining dormant accounts subject for reversion to the National Government.  

    

Despite Management efforts and actions taken on the observation, the Aging 

of the Trust Liabilities account as of December 31, 2020 disclosed that 

P18,703,344.54 or 30.51 percent of the account balance of P61,300,087.12 has been 

dormant for more than five years, and P6,299,224.64 or 10.28 percent is nearing 

dormancy, reflecting the agency’s poor monitoring on prior years’ accounts. 



 

52 

 

Inquiry with the former Regional Accountant disclosed that the Accounting 

Section processes the refund of consignation fees only upon issuance of order of 

release by the Arbiter. Further, the Accounting Section was not furnished with a 

copy of the status of cases filed, impeding the immediate refund of consignation 

fees. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to strengthen the HSAC-CO 

and ENCRO’s internal control and monitoring of the accounts through the 

following:  

  

HSAC-CO and STRO 

 

a. head of the Office of the Executive Clerk/Acting Regional Director to 
create a committee to monitor and reconcile the resolved and unresolved 

cases to update the agency’s records;  

 

b. Chief/Acting Accountant to request copy of the records of the cases 
received and disposed/resolved from the Office of the Executive 

Clerk/Chief Administrative Officer to facilitate the reconciliation of 

balances with the recorded Trust Liabilities account;   

 

HSAC-CO 

 

c. Chief Accountant to review, analyze, and reconcile the dormant 
consignation fees;  

 

HSAC-ENCRO 

 

d. the Arbiter of the Adjudication Division to provide the Accounting 
Division with the copy of the status of cases filed; hence, the Regional 

Accountant could determine the resolved cases; 

 

e. henceforth, inform the Arbiter to prepare and issue order of release of 
consignation fees of those resolved cases; and  

 

f. the Regional Accountant to request for write-off of the dormant accounts, 
when necessary, strictly in accordance with the requirements of COA 

Circular 97-001; and prepare the necessary adjusting entries.    

 

Management Comment: 

 

In HSAC-CO – 

 

The amounts referred to in the AOMs, which were accumulations from CYs 

2011 to 2014, were posted by parties as a requirement of their pending cases before 



 

53 

 

the HLURB, the precursor of HSAC, in the exercise of HLURB’s quasi-judicial 

function. 

 

It bears noting that such adjudicatory function forms part of the judicial 

system. In HLURB’s case (now HSAC), it starts from the Arbiter level (now 

Adjudicator) and can reach as high as the Supreme Court. Admittedly, the entire 

period that such system takes to finally resolve a case, from the administrative to 

the judicial, is often more than five years. Not only that, it must be understood that 

even after the finality of a Decision, the bond still has to be effective until the 

judgment is fully satisfied. This is to ensure that the judgment creditor receives 

what is due to him instead of a mere paper victory. Consequently, HLURB/HSAC 

requires bonds to be valid until a case is final and the award is satisfied.  

 

Also, as a matter of practice, it is the winning parties who file a Motion for 

Execution before HLURB/HSAC, considering that it is they who are aware of the 

status of their cases before the higher courts and are the ones notified of its finality. 

It is for the above reasons that a “write-off”, on the basis of the supposed dormancy, 

may yet be premature.  

 

Be that as it may, Management took the findings as an excellent feedback to 

improve their systems, particularly those of the Finance Service. Consequently, they 

adopted the following measures:  

 

a. The Executive Commissioner issued Office Order No. 55, s. 2021, dated May 
6, 2021, which created a committee to update and reconcile the trust liabilities 

of HSAC with that of its resolved or pending cases.  

b. The Committee has already started its review and obtained substantial partial 
results.  

c. Pursuant to Memorandum dated May 18, 2021 issued by the Executive 
Commissioner, records of the Finance Service/Accounting relative to trust 

liabilities will be looked into in order to insure that the Commission’s case 

records are reconciled with the recorded Trust Liabilities.  

 

In HSAC-ENCRO – 

 

The Chief Regional Adjudicator commented that they are still in the process 

of reviewing and analyzing the lists of Trust Liabilities and also the status of those 

cases. Once the process of reviewing of those cases is done, they will inform the 

concern Adjudicator to prepare and issue the order of release. In case there is a 

bond that needs to be written-off, they will inform the Audit Team and request for 

its write-off.  

 

In HSAC-STRO – 

 

The OIC Chief Regional Adjudicator commented that he has already directed 

the Acting Accountant to maintain the record of cases with consignation of appeal 



 

54 

 

and cash bond and resolved cases to facilitate the reconciliation of balances with the 

recorded Trust Liabilities account and to have a check in balance on the records of 

the regional office.  

 

The inventory report of all unresolved and resolved cases as of year-end was 

already submitted by the Legal Support staffs/personnel. Said Inventory Report is 

now on file. As to the archived Case Dockets and such other cases from the former 

HLURB-STRO and the recently transferred case dockets/records from the Province 

of Rizal, which is originally within the jurisdiction of HSAC-ENCRO, the RO is 

exerting its best effort to reconcile its case records/dockets (archived, resolved and 

unresolved) and eventually release the Inventory Report of all archived, resolved 

and unresolved cases.  

 

The OIC Chief Regional Adjudicator instructed and designated the Legal 

Support staffs/personnel to update the branch’s case records and work for the 

reconciliation of the archived, resolved and unresolved cases. 

 

 

Deficiencies in handling collections 

 

5. In HSAC-ENCRO, the handling of its collections was characterized by 
deficiencies, such as: (a) incurrence of delays ranging from four to 298 days in 

the deposit of collections; and (b) the designated CO in HSAC-ENCRO is also 

the designated cashier in DHSUD-ENCRO, inconsistent with Sections 32 and 

9, Chapter II of the RCEM, and a breach of the sound internal control system 

over cash. 

 

a) Delayed deposit of collections 
 

Section 32, Chapter II of the RCEM provides that “All COs shall deposit 

intact all their collections, as well as collections turned over to them by sub-

collectors/tellers, with authorized government depository bank (AGDB) daily or not 

later than the next banking day. Where collections are minimal and daily deposit 

thereof becomes costly and impractical, the COs shall deposit their collections at 

least once a week, or as soon as the collections reach P10,000.00. They shall record 

all deposits made in the Cash Receipts Record (CRR)”.  

 

Examination of the undeposited collections totaling P71,324.35 revealed that 

only P5,072.00 of which were collected on the date of cash examination, while the 

remaining P66,252.35 were collected in previous days/months; with delays ranging 

from four to 298 days, inconsistent with Section 32, Chapter II of the RCEM.  

 

The details of the delayed deposits are as follows: 

 
Date Collections (P) Deposits (P) Balance (P) Days Delayed 

January 02 47,992.25 - 47,992.25 298  

January 31 23,223.10 23,222.86 0.24 269

March 16 66,776.23 63,869.03 2,907.20 225  

June 17 2,424.00 - 2,424.00 132  

June 19 37,900.84 37,416.04 484.80 130  

August 28 147,546.72 147,543.83 2.89 60  

September 30 60,801.85 60,801.77 0.08 27  

October 23 10,685.50 - 10,685.50 4  

October 26 1,454.40 - 1,454.40 1  

October 27 5,072.00 - 5,072.00 - 

Total  71,324.35   

 

Inquiry from the CO disclosed that the collections were not deposited daily to 

the bank or the next banking day due to the unavailability of vehicle. 

 

Contrary, however, to the CO’s claim, the collections for the period October 

23 to 27, 2020 totaling P17,211.90 were deposited on November 6, 2020, excluding 

the collections for the period January 2 to September 30, 2020 totaling P54,112.45, 

which were only deposited on November 13, 2020.   

 

The delay in the deposit of collections is a clear indication of a poor internal 

control, exposing the agency to the risk of incurring losses and possible misuse or 

misappropriation of government funds. 

 

Internal Control is defined in Section 32, Volume III of the Government 

Accounting and Auditing Manual (GAAM), as follows: 

 

Internal control comprises the plan of organization and all the 

methods and measures adopted within an agency to ensure that 

resources are used consistent with laws, regulations and policies; 

resources are safeguarded against loss, wastage and misuse; 

financial and non-financial information are reliable, accurate and 

timely; and operations are economical, efficient and effective. 

 

b) Designation of the CO in HSAC-ENCRO is also the cashier in DHSUD-
ENCRO 

 

Sound internal controls dictate that effective cash management provides 

adequate safeguards of government funds against fraud and losses. To ensure that 

cash, which is the most liquid asset of an agency; hence, most susceptible to theft 

and misappropriation,  is adequately protected, controls such as segregation of 

duties, accountability, reconciliations and monitoring should be in place. The head 

of the agency shall be directly responsible for installing, implementing and 

monitoring safeguards and procedures particularly those in connection with the 

control over agency’s assets and resources.  

 



 

56 

 

Cash examination of the cash and accounts of the CO revealed that his safety 

deposit box both contained his collections for HSAC-ENCRO and collections for 

DHSUD-ENCRO since he is both the CO of HSAC-ENCRO and the Cashier of 

DHSUD-ENCRO, contrary to Section 9, Chapter II of the RCEM, which provides 

that “Government cashiers are prohibited from holding positions as cashiers or 

treasurers of savings and loan associations or any other association or 

organization”. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a. instruct the CO to deposit intact all his collections daily or not later than 
the next banking day;  

 

b. monitor strict adherence of the CO with Section 32, Chapter II of the 
RCEM;  

 

c. designate immediately a new CO for HSAC-ENCRO; and  
 

d. establish adequate internal control measures in the handling of 
collections. 

 

Management Comment: 

 

A Memorandum dated December 2, 2020 was issued addressed to Executive 

Commissioner Melzar P. Galicia, requesting the immediate designation of a 

Temporary CO for the HSAC-ENCRO and eventually, a new cashier will be hired.  

 

During the exit conference on June 17, 2021, the Regional Accountant of 

HSAC-ENCRO commented that as of May 2021 they have already hired/designated 

a new cashier/CO. However, the application for bond of the new cashier is still in-

process.    

 

 

Incomplete documentation and unauthorized expenditure  

 

6. The agency’s grant of EEA and payment of expenditures to Govern the 
Provision of Support Mechanisms to its officers and employees (CO and ROs) 

totaling P7,050,000.00 and P7,080,000.00, respectively, were not properly 

supported with complete documentation, contrary to Section 4(6) of PD No. 

1445; thus, their propriety and validity could not be determined. Moreover, 

COS Personnel, Janitors and Security Guards were also granted the same 

benefits totaling P816,000.00, in violation of GPPB Resolution No. 09-2012 

dated April 27, 2012 and COA-DBM JC No. 2, s. 2020 dated October 20, 2020; 

thus, irregular.   

 



 

57 

 

Section 4(6) of PD 1445 states that “Claims against government funds shall be 

supported with complete documentation”. 

 

Our verification of the grant in December 2020 of EEA and payment of 

expenditures to Govern the Provision of Support Mechanisms to its officers and 

employees (CO and ROs) totaling P7,050,000.00 and P7,080,000.00, respectively, 

showed non-adherence to Section 4(6) of PD No. 1445. The DVs and JEVs relative

GPPB Resolution No. 09-2012 provides that “The employees involved in the 

COS and Job Orders do not enjoy benefits enjoyed by government employees, such 

as Personnel Economic and Relief Allowance (PERA), Cost of Living Allowance 

(COLA) and Representation and Transportation Allowance (RATA)”.   

 

Likewise, Section 7.5 of the COA-DBM JC No. 2, s. 2020 states that:  

 

The services of the COS and JO workers are not covered by Civil 

Service laws, rules, and regulations, thus, not creditable as 

government service. They do not enjoy the benefits being received 

by government employees, such as leave, Personnel Economic 

Relief Allowance, Representation and Transportation Allowances, 

and other bonuses and incentives.  

 



 

59 

 

COS is defined in Section 5.1 of the COA-DBM JC No. 2, s. 2020 as “refers 

to the engagement of the services of an individual, private firm, other government 

agency, non-governmental agency or international organization as consultant, 

learning service provider or technical expert to undertake special project or job 

within a specific period”. 

 

Case 1.5, Annex “A” on Irregular Expenditures under COA Circular No. 

2012-003 dated October 29, 2012 cites as irregular the “Grant of amelioration 

allowance or any similar benefits to private employees of service contractors 

contrary to Administrative Order (A.O.) No. 365 dated October 10, 1997 xxx”.

Moreover, we noted that there were no taxes withheld from the payments of 

EEA and Support Mechanisms as required by the Tax Reform for Acceleration and 

Inclusion Law (TRAIN Law) or the RA No. 10963 on de minimis benefits in excess 

of the P90,000.00 limitation. 

 

Section 79 of the General Provisions (GP) of the General Appropriations Act 

(GAA) for FY 2020 states that:  

 

Incurrence or Payment of Unauthorized or Unlawful Obligation or 

Expenditure.  Disbursements or expenditures incurred in violation 

of existing laws, rules and regulations shall be rendered void. Any 

and all public officials and employees who will authorize, allow or 

permit, as well as those who are negligent in the performance of 

their duties and functions which resulted in the incurrence or 

payment of unauthorized and unlawful obligation or expenditure 

shall be, personally liable to the government for the full amount 

committed or expended and, subject to disciplinary actions in 

accordance with Section 43, Chapter 5 and Section 80, Chapter 7, 

Book VI of E.O. No. 292. 

 

Due to the incomplete supporting documents and some undisclosed recipients, 

the Audit Team could not fully ascertain the propriety and validity of the 

transactions, and the accuracy of the affected accounts.  

 

We recommended that Management: 

 

a. instruct the Chief Accountant to submit to the Audit Team the 
supporting documents on the payment of EEA and Support Mechanisms 

to agency’s officers and employees (CO and ROs), such as the: (a) legal 

basis of the payment, (b) basis of the amount paid to each recipients, (c) 

office order or resolution on the grant approved by the head of the 

agency, and (d) original List of Recipients with proof of receipt;   

 

b. require the refund of the Support Mechanisms that were granted and paid 
to the agency’s COS Personnel, Janitors and Security Guards without 

legal basis;  

 

c. withhold taxes on de minimis benefits in excess of the P90,000.00 
limitation, in accordance with the TRAIN Law or the RA No. 10963; and 

 

d. refrain from granting benefits and paying unauthorized expenditures.   
 

Management Comment: 

 

During the exit conference on June 17, 2021, it was committed that all the 

supporting documents that will validate the payment will be submitted.  The Audit 



 

62 

 

Team was requested to give them ample time to submit said documents especially 

those related to the grant of Support Mechanism to the Contract of Service 

Personnel, Janitors and Security Guards. 

 

 

Non-submission of POs and Contracts within the prescribed period 

 

7. In HSAC-NTRO and STRO, perfected POs and Contracts that were issued 
during the year were not submitted to the Audit Team within the prescribed 

period, in violation of Sections 3.1.1 and 3.2.1 of the COA Circular No. 2009-

001 dated February 12, 2009, preventing the auditorial review that would 

detect deficiencies early, and the immediate communication to Management of 

the results of audit for appropriate remedial action.  

 

Section 3.1.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-001 requires that “Within five (5) 

working days from the execution of a contract by the government or any of its 

subdivisions, agencies or instrumentalities, including government-owned and 

controlled corporations and their subsidiaries, a copy of said contract and each of all 

the documents forming part thereof by reference or incorporation shall be furnished 

to the Auditor of the agency concerned. xxx”.  

 

Likewise, Section 3.2.1 of the same COA Circular provides that “A copy of 

any purchase order irrespective of amount, and each and every supporting 

document shall within five (5) working days from issuance thereof, be submitted to 

the Auditor concerned. Within the same period, the Auditor shall review and point 

out to management defects and/or deficiencies, if any, in the same manner provided 

in the second and third sentences of items 3.1.4 hereof.” 

 

In HSAC-NTRO, review of the CY 2020 transactions disclosed that various 

supplies and equipment totaling P541,200.30 were procured and services amounting 

to P98,719.91 were contracted. However, copies of the POs and Contracts were not 

submitted to the Audit Team within five days from perfection, contrary to Sections 

3.1.1 and 3.2.1 of the COA Circular No. 2009-001, but were attached to the DVs, 

which were submitted monthly to the Audit Team.  

 

Verification and interviews made disclosed that the total work force of the 

agency consisted only of five permanent employees and one contractual employee, 

and due to this limited personnel, the Regional Budget Officer of DHSUD is the 

one in charge of the preparation and processing of the POs.  

 

On the other hand, in HSAC-STRO, verification showed that the agency did 

not submit copies of the POs totaling P1,152,600.30 to the Audit Team within five 

working days from issuance thereof, with delays ranging from nine to 61 days, 

contrary to the aforementioned COA rules and regulations.  This deficiency was 

admitted by the Supply Officer.  

 



 

63 

 

The failure to submit copies of POs and Contracts together with its supporting 

documents within the prescribed period, affected the timeliness of auditorial review 

that would detect early any deficiencies, and immediately communicate to 

Management the results of audit for their appropriate remedial action. 

 

We recommended and HSAC-NTRO and STRO Management agreed to 

direct the concerned employees to monitor the submission of all perfected POs 

and Contracts to the Audit Team within the prescribed period.   

 

We further recommended and to HSAC-NTRO Management agreed to 

make representations with the appropriate authorities for the augmentation of 

personnel necessary in the operations of the agency.  

 

Management Comment: 

 

In HSAC-STRO – 

 

The OIC, Chief Administrative Officer commented that the delay in the 

submission of POs was due to the transition period of HLURB to HSAC, the full 

implementation of DBM’s Notice of Organization, Staffing and Compensation 

Action (NOSCA) and the absence of HSAC Supply Officer to monitor the 

submission of all perfected PO’s to the Audit Team.  

 

 

Absence of designation order of the Regional Accountant and Collecting/Disbursing 

Officer  

 

8. The Regional Accountant, the Disbursing Officer and the CO of the DHSUD-
STRO who were temporarily assigned in the handling and disposing of HSAC-

STRO funds lack authority or proper assignment order to discharge such 

functions, in violation of the Sections 2 and 4.4 of PD No. 1445. 

 

Section 2 of PD No. 1445 provides that “It is the declared policy of the State 

that all resources of the government shall be managed, expended or utilized in 

accordance with law and regulations, and safeguard against loss or wastage through 

illegal or improper disposition, with a view to ensuring efficiency, economy and 

effectiveness in the operations of government. xxx”. 

 

Likewise, Section 4.4 of the same PD states that “Fiscal responsibility shall, to 

the greatest extent, be shared by all those government exercising authority over the 

financial affairs, and operations of the government agency”.  

 

Moreover, pursuant to the implementation of RA No. 11201, the HLURB was 

reconstituted as HSAC. In view of these changes, most of the personnel of the 

former HLURB were transferred to the DHSUD including the Accountant, the 

Disbursing Officer and the CO. The only permanent employees of HSAC-STRO 



 

64 

 

are the OIC Regional Director, the Administrative Officer and two Administrative 

Aides who perform paralegal functions. Hence, all accounting, disbursing and 

collecting functions of the agency is administered by the employees of DHSUD.  

 

It was also observed that the DVs and accounting records and reports on the 

agency’s transactions were prepared and signed by the Chief Administrative Officer 

(CAO) and Regional Accountant of DHSUD. While the checks issued were signed 

by DHSUD CAO and the Disbursing Officer. Likewise, the Special Collecting 

Officer of DHSUD prepares and signs the report on collections and deposits of 

HSAC, and is the signatory of the official receipt.  

 

The Audit Team has often times called the attention of the Acting Regional 

Director of HSAC-STRO regarding this setup, however, no office order has been 

provided by the DHSUD.   

 

Interview with the Acting Regional Director disclosed that he has already 

requested for a special order from DHSUD-STRO and accordingly, this has already 

been requested to the DHSUD’s CO. 

 

Since the aforementioned personnel of DHSUD do not have proper authority 

or designation order to perform vital functions for the HSAC-STRO, all 

accountability and liability in cases of irregular, illegal or improper disposition of 

agency’s funds fall to the Acting Regional Director.  

 

We recommended and the OIC Regional Director agreed to secure from 

DHSUD-CO or DHSUD-STRO Regional Director a special order for the 

Accountant, the Disbursing Officer and the CO authorizing them to perform 

the duties and functions of their position in HSAC-STRO, until such time that 

the plantilla positions has been filled up. 

 

Management Comment: 

 

The OIC Regional Adjudicator Officer commented that for the time being that 

plantilla positions has not yet been filled up, all accounting, disbursing and 

collecting functions of the agency will be administered by the Accountant and the 

Disbursing Officer and the COs of DHSUD. He also commented that he will 

immediately coordinate the issue with HSAC-Central Office in order to secure such 

designations; hence, duties and functions of their position for HSAC could be 

officially discharged. 

 

The Chief Accountant of HSAC-CO commented during the exit conference on 

June 17, 2021 that the HSAC-STRO has already hired a new Accountant.  

 

 

 

 



 

65 

 

Delayed and non-submission of BRSs 

 

9. In HSAC-STRO and NMRO, BRSs were submitted late with delays ranging 
from 60 to 183 days, and the BRSs for the months of July to December were 

still unsubmitted, contrary to Section 7, Chapter 21, Volume I of the GAM for 

NGAs, preventing the identification on time of any reconciling items requiring 

adjustments.  

 

Section 7, Chapter 21, Volume I of the GAM, provides that “The Chief 

Accountant shall submit the BRS within twenty days after receipt of the monthly 

BS to the xxx:”. 

 

In HSAC-STRO, the BRSs were not submitted to the Audit Team within the 

stipulated date of submission, with delays ranging from 60 to 183 days and still 

unsubmitted for the months of November and December, as shown below: 

 
Month Date Received by COA Due Date Days Delayed

November not yet submitted 12/07/2020  

December not yet submitted 01/07/2020   

 

Interview with the Acting Accountant disclosed that the delay in the 

preparation and submission of BRS was due to the late receipt of the bank 

statements and the absence of accounting staff in the Accounting Section. It was 

also observed that the Regional Accountant of DHSUD is the one who handles the 

accounting for HSAC. 

 

In HSAC-NMRO, records show that the agency has not submitted its monthly 

BRS for the period from July to December 2020 together with its supporting 

documents, such as the accompanying bank statements, schedule of reconciling 

items, copy of advice of NCA issued, and general and subsidiary ledgers because 

the agency is also still waiting for the bank statements from its depository bank. 

 

The delay may also be attributed to the fact that the HSAC-NMRO’s 

Accountant assists in the preparation of the accounting reports of the DHSUD-

NMRO while waiting for the appointment of additional personnel. 

 

It is also worth mentioning that the Accountant committed to prepare and 

submit the said BRSs as soon as the bank statements are received. 



 

66 

 

The timely preparation of the BRS and the recognition of the adjustments are 

necessary to ensure the correctness of the book and bank balances, and to prevent or 

to discover fraud or errors detrimental to the operations of the agency. Unaccounted 

receipts and disbursements, undetected fraudulent transactions, unwarranted bank 

charges or errors may cause undue delay in the performance of 

projects/programs/activities. 

 

The failure of the Accountant to submit the BRS on time prevented the timely 

recording of reconciling items that requires adjustments, if any.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to:  

 

HSAC-STRO and NMRO 

 

a. require the Acting/Regional Accountant to prepare and submit to the 
Audit Team copy of BRS within the prescribed period together with the 

supporting documents;  

 

b. Henceforth, prepare the adjusting entries for any reconciling items 
requiring adjustments;  

 

HSAC-STRO 

 

c. advise the Acting Accountant to make representation with the bank 
officials to secure access to online banking for the real time bank 

statement and balances;  

 

d. require the Acting Regional Director to immediately hire accounting 
personnel; and  

 

HSAC-NMRO 

 

e. advise the Accountant to coordinate with cashier in the follow up of the 
bank statements from the agency’s depository bank.  

 

Management Comment: 

 

In HSAC-STRO – 

 

The Accountant commented that the delay in the preparation and submission 

of BRSs was due to the late receipt of the bank statements and the absence of 

accounting staff/personnel in the Accounting Section to handle such duties. Also, 

the Accountant of DHSUD is also the Accountant of HSAC; thus, giving her 

voluminous work to perform her functions. However, the Management promised 

that they will exert their best effort to comply with the recommendations and rectify 

the noted deficiencies as they are now waiting for the appointment of HSAC 



 

67 

 

Regional Accountant and support personnel to perform the said duties and 

responsibilities.  

 

HSAC-NMRO – 

 

The delay in the submission of BRS was due to the delayed receipt of the 

bank statements. Further, the Accountant committed to prepare and submit the 

monthly BRS as soon as the bank statements are already available and will take into 

consideration the auditor’s rejoinder contained in the CY 2020 Management Letter 

(ML) of the Audit Team on the HSAC-NMRO, as follows: 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder:  

 

In HSAC-NMRO, the Audit Team pointed out that Management 

should have taken earlier initiative in retrieving the bank 

statements through making a representation with the agency’s 

depositary banks on a regular monthly schedule and try to make 

use of the agency’s electronic or screenshot copy of the account 

statement of their bank accounts in order to observe the prompt 

preparation and submission of monthly BRS while waiting for the 

bank’s print out copies.  

 

Also, it is noteworthy to mention that all BRSs of HSAC-NMRO for CY 2020 

were completely submitted to the Audit Team on March 12, 2021.  

 

 

Undisposed Unserviceable PPE Items 

  

10. In HSAC-BRO, various unserviceable PPE items with total cost of P696,935.60 
were still reported in the RPCPPE, contrary to Section 40(d), Chapter 10, 

Volume I of the GAM for NGAs, and were not disposed of as of December 31, 

2020 due to the pending transfer/distribution of properties to respective 

regional offices of DHSUD and HSAC, which is not in accordance with Section 

79 of PD No. 1445, depriving the government of income that may have been 

derived from the sale thereof.  

 

Section 40(d), Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs provides that “All 

unserviceable property shall be reported in the Inventory and Inspection Report of 

Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) (Appendix 74). PPE reported in the IIRUP shall be 

dropped from the books xxx”. The IIRUP is a report prepared by the Supply and/or 

Property Unit as basis to record dropping from the books the unserviceable 

properties in the PPE accounts. 

 

In addition, Section 79 of PD No. 1445 on the destruction or sale of 

unserviceable property, provides that “When government property has become 

unserviceable for any cause, or is no longer needed, it shall, upon application of the 



 

68 

 

officer accountable therefore, be inspected by the head of the agency or his duly 

authorized representative in the presence of the auditor concerned and, if found to 

be valueless or unsalable, it may be destroyed in their presence. If found to be 

valuable, it may be sold at public auction to the highest bidder under the supervision 

of the proper committee an award or similar body in the presence of the auditor 

concerned or other duly authorized representative of the Commission, xxx”. 

 

Further, Section G of the Manual on Disposal of Government Property states 

that “The Disposal Committee shall recommend to the head of the agency the 

proper mode of disposal. Property may be disposed in any of the modes, as 

appropriate and deemed most advantageous to the government”.  

  

Review of the RPCPPE showed that various PPE items costing P696,935.60 

were included in the report and remarked as unserviceable. The details are as 

follows:

     Total    696,935.60  

 

Moreover, said unserviceable PPE remained undisposed as of audit date due 

to the pending transfer/distribution of properties to respective regional offices of 

DHSUD and HSAC, causing further deterioration and occupying the already 

limited storage space that could have been used by the agency for other purposes. 

Likewise, the Property Officer has to perform tedious task of accounting for the 

said PPE items every time a physical inventory is conducted.   

 

 

 

 



 

69 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the:  

 

a. Property Officer to account the unserviceable PPE and prepare the 
IIRUP;  

 

b. Disposal Committee to immediately undertake the disposal of said PPE in 
accordance with Section 40(d), Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM for 

NGAs and Section 79 of PD No. 1445 to maximize their realizable value 

and to clear the storage space they occupy; and  

 

c. henceforth, furnish the Accountant with a copy of the IIRUP as basis for 
dropping from the books the cost of disposed PPE. 

 

Management comment: 

 

The Asset Management Committee of Central Office is still in the process of 

finalizing the guidelines regarding the transfer/distribution of properties to 

respective regional offices of DHSUD and HSAC. Pending thereof, they cannot 

prepare the IIRUP since they do not have the physical custody of the said 

unserviceable PPEs. However, they shall comply with the recommendations once 

the transfer/distribution of assets is completed.   

 

 

Unreliable Leave Credit Balances of Personnel 

 

11. In HSAC-WVRO, the agency’s practices in the accrual and use of COCs are 
not in accordance with the provisions of CSC-DBM JC No. 2, s. 2004 dated 

October 4, 2004, thereby casting doubts on the accuracy and reliability of the 

leave credit balances of its personnel. 

 

CSC-DBM JC No. 2, s. 2004 dated October 4, 2004 with subject matter “Non-

monetary Remuneration for Overtime Services Rendered” prescribes the guidelines 

on the availment of compensatory time-off (CTO) in lieu of overtime pay. It 

provides the following definition of relevant terms: 

 

COC refers to the accrued number of hours an employee earns as a 

result of services rendered beyond regular working hours, and/or 

those rendered on Saturdays, Sundays, Holidays or scheduled days 

off without the benefit of overtime pay. 

 

CTO refers to the number of hours or days an employee is excused 

from reporting for work with full pay and benefits. It is a non-

monetary benefit provided to an employee in lieu of overtime pay. 

 

Moreover, Section 5.2 of the JC states that “The Head of Office shall 

determine the need for overtime services. In this regard, the Office concerned shall 



 

70 

 

issue an office order specifying the date and time for rendition of overtime, and its 

purpose”. 

 

Section 5.5 provides the pertinent rules on the accrual and use of COCs, as 

follows:  

 

5.5.1 Each employee may accrue not more than forty (40) hours of 

COCs in a month. In no instance, however, shall the 

unexpended balance exceed one hundred twenty (120) hours.  

 

5.5.2 The COCs shall be used as time-off within the year these are 

earned. The unutilized COC should not be carried over in the 

ensuing year, hence, are non-cumulative.  

 

Section 5.6.1 provides that “The COCs cannot be used to offset undertime/s or 

tardiness incurred by the employee during regular working days”. 

 

With regard to the relevant forms involved, Section 5.8 provides that “An 

employee who has earned COC shall be granted a Certificate of COC Earned 

(Annex B) duly approved and signed by the Head of Office. The certificate 

indicates the number of hours of earned COC by the employee in a month. The 

certificate would be issued at the end of the month”. 

 

The procedure to be observed in the rendition of overtime services and 

availment of CTO are provided in Section 6, to wit: 

 

6.1 The Head of Office/authorized official issues an Office Order 

authorizing the rendition of overtime services xxx. 

 

6.2 The employee renders overtime services as stipulated in the 

Office Order.  

 

6.3 The Human Resource Management Office prepares a summary 

of overtime services rendered in a month, and computes the 

equivalent COCs xxx.  

 

6.4 The Head of Office issues the Certificate of COCs Earned, 

specifying the number of COCs earned in a month.  

 

6.5 The employee requests approval from the Head of Office on 

the schedule of CTO.  

 

6.6 The employee avails of the CTO. 

 

 



 

71 

 

Verification of sample leave cards of four personnel of the agency disclosed 

the following deficiencies: 

 

a. COCs were used to offset undertime(s)/tardiness incurred by employees 
during regular days; 

b. Absences charged to COCs were not supported with the required 
Certificates of COCs Earned and Leave Forms; and 

c. Mathematical errors were noted in the computation of leave balances. 
 

Perusal of the agency’s existing records revealed that the rendition of 

overtime services, as well as the accrual of COCs was authorized by the Agency 

Head through issuance of special office order at the start of every calendar year. 

These documents stated that services rendered by personnel on weekends and 

holidays, when covered by travel orders/authorities, shall be treated as overtime and 

shall therefore accrue to COCs. The corresponding CTOs may be then availed by 

personnel as half or full day leave from work or used to offset their undertimes and 

tardiness. 

 

In addition, the COCs do not expire and are continuously accrued and made 

available for use over several years, which started in CYs 2012. This practice was 

also authorized through issuance of special office order citing the extension of 

validity as fair treatment to workers who could not avail of CTOs within the year 

due to the exigency of service. It was also discovered that no Certificates of COCs 

Earned were issued to personnel who rendered overtime services and no Leave 

Forms for the availment of CTOs were attached to the DTRs. COC balances were 

maintained and updated by the former CAO/concurrent Human Resource 

Management Office (HRMO) personnel, who was in charge of recording the 

changes in the balances. 

 

The former CAO/HRMO personnel revealed that these practices were done 

with the best of intentions, as a means of giving the regional personnel some non-

monetary motivation for working beyond the regular office hours/days required by 

law. While the special office orders issued were meant to authorize remuneration 

for personnel working overtime. Lapses in the procedures and inability to make use 

of the required forms were attributed to heavy workload and concurrent functions. 

 

The issuance of special office orders should not be an excuse for Management 

to not ensuring proper implementation of the existing guidelines under the CSC-

DBM JC No. 2, s. 2004 and not to act accordingly should violations or irregularities 

are committed. 

 

The deficiencies observed in the review of the sampled leave cards suggested 

that there is a high probability for the other leave cards to have inaccurate balances, 

rendering doubts on the reliability of personnel leave credit balances.  

 

 



 

72 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the: 

 

a. Acting Personnel Officer to: 
 

i. backtrack and review postings and computations of leave balances 
in the leave cards, and ensure that COCs are not used to offset 

undertimes/tardiness of employees, and that absences charged to 

COCs are duly supported with Certificates of COCs Earned and 

Leave Forms; 

 

ii. ensure that unutilized COCs are forfeited upon expiration of their 
validity; 

 

iii. maintain and submit a monthly report on summary of overtime 
services rendered and the equivalent COCs to the Head of Office; 

 

iv. regularly review the DTRs, Applications for Leave and supporting 
documents, and the postings made to the leave cards; 

 

b. Head of Office to: 
 

i. appropriately authorize employees to render overtime services by 
issuing office orders specifying the date and time for rendition and 

its purpose; 

 

ii. grant Certificates of COCs Earned, and set safeguard measures to 
prevent any form of fraud and/or duplicity; 

 

iii. approve/disapprove applications for CTO (Leave Forms) based on 
duly approved and unexpired Certificates of COCs Earned, without 

compromising the delivery of services to clientele; and 

 

iv. ensure proper implementation of all the guidelines set forth in CSC-
DBM JC No. 2, s. 2004 dated October 4, 2004. 

 

Management Comment: 

 

During the exit conference of HSAC-WVRO, Management disclosed that the 

Acting Personnel Officer is already in the process of back tracking the computation 

of leave balances.  

 

 

Non-submission of DVs 

 

12. In HSAC-WVRO and NMRO, the DVs with total amounts of P5,765,049.77 
and P2,784,845.97 for the CY 2020 and for the months of November and 



 

73 

 

December 2020, respectively, together with the corresponding supporting 

documents and related reports were not submitted to the Audit Team within 

the prescribed period, in nonconformance with Section 7 of the COA Circular 

No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009, precluding the timely review and 

verification of the validity, propriety and legality of the transactions. 
 

Section 7.1.1 of the COA Circular No. 2009-006 states that “The head of the 

agency, who is primarily responsible for all government funds and property 

pertaining to his agency, shall ensure that: (a) the required financial and other 

reports and statements are submitted by the concerned agency officials in such form 

and within the period prescribed by the Commission; xxx”.  

 

Likewise, Section 7.2.1 provides that “The Chief Accountant, Bookkeeper or 

other authorized official performing accounting and/or bookkeeping functions of 

the audited agency shall ensure that: a) the reports and supporting documents 

submitted by the accountable officers are immediately recorded in the books of 

accounts and submitted to the auditor within the first ten (10) days of the ensuing 

month; xxx”.  

 

Moreover, Section 7.3.1 states that “The Auditor shall enforce submission of 

receipt and disbursement records with all paid vouchers, official receipts, reports 

and supporting documents as prescribed by the Commission and the related laws, 

rules and regulations, and as necessary in the course of audit”. 

 

In HSAC-WVRO, verification of the status of submission of DVs revealed 

that the Acting Accountant failed to submit the DVs for CY 2020 to the Audit Team 

within the prescribed period. The details are as follows:

Interview with the Acting Accountant/OIC-Administration and Finance 

disclosed that the concurrent responsibilities of the designated cashier had 

precluded her from submitting the DVs to the accounting unit within the prescribed 

deadlines. Also, pursuant to the implementation of RA No. 11201, the 

reconstitution of HLURB as HSAC and the alternative work arrangements caused 



 

74 

 

by the COVID-19 pandemic have adversely affected the workload of the agency’s 

personnel; hence, there were significant delays in the submission of reports and 

supporting documents.  

 

In HSAC-NMRO, verification of compliance on the submission of DVs and 

analysis of Advice to Debit Account (ADA) and Check Disbursement Journals 

(CKDJs) revealed that the Accountant failed to submit the DVs for the months of 

November and December 2020 with a total amount of P2,784,845.97.  

 

It was also observed that the agency was late in the submission of DVs for CY 

2020, with delays ranging from 50 to 182 days. The details follow:

Further analysis of the ADA and CKDJs revealed the following disbursements 

in December 2020 totaling P1,562,869.00 that necessitate immediate review and 

audit. But without the complete DVs, Report of Advice to Debit Account Issued 

(RADAI) and Report of Checks Issued (RCI) which could have provided 

information as to the nature of the transactions, the propriety, validity and legality 

could not be ascertained:  

 

 

Despite reminders and follow up made by the Audit Team on the submission 

of the said DVs and its supporting documents, the same remained unsubmitted.

The failure of the Accountant to comply with the submission of DVs and their 

supporting documents, and related reports precluded the Audit Team from 

rendering a timely review and verification; hence, any deficiency noted could not be 

communicated to the Management for immediate action/correction. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the: 

 

a. Regional Accountant to immediately submit the DVs and their 
supporting documents, and related reports to the Audit Team;  

 

b. designated Cashier for HSAC-WVRO to prepare and regularly submit 
all monthly financial reports and DVs to the Accounting Section within 

the prescribed deadlines for recording; and  

 

c. henceforth, Regional Accountant to strictly observe the submission of 
accounting reports and its supporting documents within the prescribed 

period.   

 

Management Comment: 

 

HSAC-WVRO – 

 

Instruction was given to the designated Cashier to fast track the compilation of 

DVs and supporting documents, and to submit the same to the Accounting Section. 

 

It is noteworthy to mention that the Regional Accountant of HSAC-WVRO 

has submitted already to the Audit Team the DVs from January to November 2020. 

 

HSAC-NMRO – 

 

The late submission of the DVs was due to the prioritization of the preparation 

of the annual reports for CY 2020. Furthermore, the agency appointed a new 

Accountant who will now facilitate the timely submission of the upcoming DVs and 

other financial reports. 

 

The Regional Accountant of HSAC-NMRO has submitted already to the 

Audit Team the DVs for months of November to December 2020 on March 31, 

2021.   

 

 

Manually-Prepared DTRs 

 

13. In HSAC-WVRO, entries in the DTRs for the months of April to October 2020 
were recorded manually, despite the availability of time sheet reports for 

timekeeping generated by the biometric machine, contrary to CSC MC No. 21, 



 

76 

 

s. 1991 dated June 4, 1991, inviting suspicion on the authenticity of the 

manually entered attendance information. 

 

CSC MC No. 21, s. 1991 provides that all officers and employees shall record 

their daily attendance on the proper form or, whenever possible, have them register 

on the bundy clock. Any other means of recording attendance may be allowed 

provided their respective names and signatures as well as their time of arrival to and 

departure from their respective office are indicated, subject to verification. All other 

officials including presidential appointees who are not required to use bundy clock 

shall hereinafter record their attendance in the manner prescribed by the Office and 

their absences shall be covered with requisite leaves of absence. 

 

In addition, in line with Malacañang’s reminder to government employees to 

follow regulations on work hours, the CSC has also urged all government agencies 

to adopt appropriate mechanisms to strictly monitor and record attendance of 

employees, such as the use of biometric time clocks and other forms of attendance 

systems. Biometric verification of an individual’s unique biological characteristic, 

like a fingerprint, prevents fraudulent attendance entries and encourages employees 

to report on time; thus, increasing productivity. 

 

Review of DTRs revealed that the entries therein for the months from April to 

October 2020 were recorded manually, despite the availability of time sheet reports 

to record timekeeping generated by the biometric machine. It was also observed that 

Certificates of Appearance of personnel on official business were not attached to 

support the DTRs. 

 

Inquiry with various personnel revealed that they were instructed not to use 

the biometric machine as a health protocol due to the current pandemic. Instead, a 

logbook was maintained to record the attendance, however, no specific personnel 

was designated to verify and review the entries made therein. Moreover, the 

logbook or copies of its pages were not attached to support the submitted DTRs. 

 

The practice, of manually recording attendance information in the DTRs, is 

highly susceptible to manipulations; hence, unreliable. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to direct the:  

 

a. agency employees to register their daily attendance in the biometric 
machine and logbook; 

 

b. Acting Personnel Officer to: 
 

i. utilize and submit DTRs generated by the biometric machine 
together with complete supporting documents; and 

 



 

77 

 

ii. regularly verify and review the attendance entries made in the 
logbook. 

 

 

Deficiencies in handling PCF 

 

14. In HSAC-SMRO, various deficiencies were observed in the transactions 
involving the P15,000.00 PCF, such as: (a) the amount that was setup was way 

beyond the recurring expenses for one month; and (b) utilizations were not in 

accordance with the purposes for which the PCF was granted, contrary to the 

various provisions of the GAM for NGAs on the accounting policies on PCF, 

raising doubts on the necessity of having a PCF.  

 

a) PCF was way beyond the recurring expenses for one month 
 

Section 35, Chapter 6, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs provides that: 

 

The Petty Cash Fund (PCF) to be set up shall be sufficient for the 

recurring petty operating expenses of the agency for one month. 

xxx. The PCF shall be replenished as soon as disbursements reach 

at least 75% or as needed. 

 

Verification of the PCF showed that the amount setup was far beyond the 

recurring expenses for one month, contrary to the preceding Section 35.  

                

The data gathered showed that the average monthly utilization of the PCF was 

only 11 percent, which means that the PCF Custodian (PCFC) has in her possession 

a PCF good for nine months’ use, as illustrated below: 

 

ADA / JEV No. Month Date

Total Utilization     15,000.00  

Monthly Average (9 months)   1,666.67 11 

  

Moreover, as herein Table shows, there were no replenishments made during 

the year, and it took more than six months to use/utilize and liquidate the PCF.  

 

b) Inappropriate utilization  
 

Section 35(a), Chapter 6, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs specifically states 

that the fund shall not be used for payment of regular expenses, as stated in the next 

page: 

 



 

78 

 

The fund shall be kept separately from the regular cash 

advances/collections and shall not be used for payment of regular 

expenses such as rentals, subscriptions, light and water bills, 

purchase of supplies and materials for stock purposes,  xxx  

 

Verification of the PCF’s purpose disclosed the following: 

 
Particulars  Amount (P) 

Supplies and Materials Expenses 5,000.00 

Training Expenses 3,000.00 

Fuel, Oil & Lubricants Expenses 4,000.00 

Postage and Courier Expenses 3,000.00 

Total  15,000.00 

 

However, it was observed that some expenses paid out of the PCF were not 

recurring petty operating supplies expenses.  Moreover, they were not included as 

one of the purposes, for which the PCF was granted. The details are as follows:  

 
Particulars Amount (P) 

Accountable Forms Expenses 800.00 

Taxes, Duties & Licenses 669.06 

Water Expenses 275.00 

Internet Subscription Expenses 600.00 

Printing and Publication Expenses 300.00 

Travel Expenses-Local 430.00 

Repairs and Maintenance- 

Transportation Equipment  640.00 

Total 3,714.06 

 

Inquiry with the Administrative Officer who certified to the necessity of the 

cash advance disclosed that due to the transition period of the HSAC, it was thought 

that the funds granted for the months of January and February 2020 will only be 

intended for personal services. However, in March 2020, they were advised by the 

CO that the funds were for their operation. Hence, a PCF was established. Since it 

was the initial year of full operation, they find it necessary to allocate P15,000.00.   

 

The Administrative Officer admitted that she constantly remind the PCFC to 

liquidate her cash advances. They even decided not to replenish the liquidations 

because they have already observed that PCF is not necessary. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the 

Administrative Officer to: 

  

a. review the monthly recurring petty operating expenses of its office to be 
able to setup a realistic PCF sufficient for one month; and  

 



 

79 

 

b. ensure that the PCF is utilized and liquidated in accordance with the PCF 
guidelines.  

 

 

Appealed cases not resolved within the 90-day period 

 

15. The HSAC failed to resolve 71 out of 180 Appealed cases within the 90-day 
period incurring a delay ranging from four to 230 days, contrary to Section 99 

of the 2019 HLURB Rules and Procedures. 

 

Section 99 of the HLURB Rules and Procedures states that: 

 

The Board of Commissioners shall resolve the appeal within ninety 

(90) days from the date the appeal is deemed submitted for 

resolution. All pending motions as well as those unresolved 

incidents filed after the submission of the appeal for resolution 

shall be resolved in the judgment. 

  

The Office of the Executive Clerk is in charge to receive and file all dockets 

of cases endorsed by the RABs including pleadings related to cases appealed and 

other papers properly submitted to the Commission, and conducts mediation 

conference in cases appealed as may be ordered by the Commission-en-Banc acting 

through divisions, to consider the possibility of an amicable settlement, under such 

rules as may be duly promulgated. 

 

Review and verification of the list of Appealed cases obtained from the Office 

of the Executive Clerk revealed that 180 Appealed cases were elevated to the Board 

of Commissioners from January 01 to December 31, 2020. Of the 180, 61 cases 

were resolved, while the remaining 119 cases were unresolved.  

 

Of the 61 resolved cases or 33.89 per cent of the 180 Appealed cases, 10 cases 

were decided within the prescribed period of 90 days, while the remaining 51 cases 

were decided beyond the prescribed period, with delays ranging from six to 230 

days. 

 

For the 119 unresolved cases, while 48 cases are still considered current and 

within the prescribed period, 71 were already from four to 230 days beyond the 

prescribed period. 

 

Based on the foregoing evaluation, Management appears to be not fully 

compliant with its rules and procedures. Delays of up to 230 days in enforcement of 

actions and resolution of disputes were seen. 

 

However, in 2019, agency records disclosed that 593 appeals were handled by 

the Board of Commissioners, 391 or 66 per cent of which has been resolved with 

the assistance of the then Appeals Review Group. 



 

80 

 

Management disclosed that delays in the disposition of cases in CY 2020 were 

attributed to various factors, to wit: 

 

a. Declaration of lockdown of the national government from March 16 - 
May 31, 2020; 

b. Second declaration of lockdown from August 4 - August 18, 2020; 
c. Implementation of Alternative Work Arrangement (AWA) from June 1, 

2020 up to present; 

d. Reduction of adjudicators caused by death of one lawyer due to COVID-
19 and a number of transfers  of  lawyers to DHSUD; and 

e. Prioritization of backlogs in the previous years. 
 

Furthermore, based on our interview we discovered that the recruitment/hiring 

of additional personnel   to   complement   and  support the agency’s expected 

output is snail-paced due also to movement and change  of designation of some 

personnel in the HRS; thus, affecting the agency’s performance to meet its target  

for the year. 

 

As a result of the above-mentioned factors, the agency failed to carry the 

expected mandate and deprived its stakeholders of their rights and privileges. These 

uncontrollable/unpredictable factors causing the delays, may justify HSAC’s poor 

performance for the year. 

 

We recommended and the Executive Commissioner agreed to: 

 

a. enforce compliance of the Board of Commissioners with the guidelines set 
forth under Section 99 of the 2019 HLURB Rules and Procedures in the 

next and coming years to improve agency’s compliance of its mandate; 

and 

 

b. closely monitor and instruct other capable personnel in the 
Administrative Office to assist the HRS to expedite the filling up of 

vacant positions to complement the existing workforce to achieve the 

agency’s expected output. 

 

Management Comment: 

 

The HSAC new rules and procedures have already been promulgated. With 

regards to the backlogs, the Management’s target is September 2021 but they can 

finish it earlier by the end of July or August 2021. Also, they commented that based 

on the new rules and regulations, HSAC will resolve the appeal cases within 120-

day period but they will not allow anymore production of backlogs.  

 

Commissioner Exconde, Jr. further commented that the HSAC have 

considerably improved as compared to the last year’s percentage of unresolved 

cases. 



 

81 

 

B. Others  
 

NTF-ELCAC expenditures 

 

16. During the year, the HSAC did not receive funds for NTF-ELCAC nor utilize any 
of its funds for the purpose. 

 

 

COVID-19-Related Expenses 

 

17. During the year, the HSAC-CO expended a total of P8,790,726.47 out of its own 
fund for the procurement of COVID-19-related various needs of its employees, and 

for the payment of support mechanisms.

Gender and Development (GAD) Plans and Programs 

 

18. For CY 2020, HSAC had implemented GAD activities utilizing P4,150,698.66 
or 1.57 percent of the total adjusted budget of agency of P263,704,968.00, 

contrary to Section 31 of the GP of the GAA for Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 (RA No. 

11465), as revised by Section 4.3 of the Philippine Commission on Women 

(PCW) MC No. 2020-03. Moreover, the FY 2020 GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) 

and GAD Accomplishment Report of the agency were not submitted to PCW, 

in violation of Section 1.2.2.1 of the PCW MC No. 2019-02 and Section 1 of the 

PCW MC No. 2021-01, respectively. As a consequence, the submitted GPB to 

the Audit Team was not endorsed by PCW. 

 

Section 31 of the GPs of the GAA of FY 2020 (RA No. 11465) requires all 

agencies of the government to formulate a GAD Plan designed to address gender 

issues within their concerned sectors or mandate and implement the applicable 

provisions under RA No. 9710 or the Magna Carta of Women, Convention on the 

Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Beijing Platform 

for Action, the Philippine Plan for the Gender-Responsive Development (1995-

2025) and the Philippine Development Plan (2017-2022). 

 

Moreover, the GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of the 

agency, which shall be at least five percent of their budgets. For this purpose, 

activities currently being undertaken by the agency, which relate to GAD or those 

that contribute to poverty alleviation, economic empowerment especially of 

marginalized women, protection, promotion, and fulfilment of women’s human 

rights, and practice of gender-responsive governance are considered sufficient 

compliance with said requirements. 

 

In line with the current situation of a pandemic, Section 4.3 of PCW MC No. 

2020-03 dated April 27, 2020 states that “The computation of the minimum five 

percent (5%) GAD budget as provided under Section 36(a) of the MCW shall be 

based on the total adjusted budget of the agency following National Budget Circular 

No. 580”. 

 

Evaluation of the submitted GAD Accomplishment Report for CY 2020 

showed that HSAC allocated a total GAD budget of P12,500,000.00 for its GAD- 

related activities out of the GAD budget of P13,185,248.40 (equivalent five percent 

of the total adjusted budget for CY 2020 of P263,704,968.00).  

 

During the year, a total of P4,150,698.66 or 1.57 percent of the total adjusted 

budget was spent for the implementation of the GAD activities. Furthermore, the 

total amount spent was only 33.21 percent of the GAD-allocated budget; thus, 

HSAC was not able to maximize the utilization of the GAD-allocated budget.

Based on the above table, HSAC-ENCRO, NLRO, WVRO and SMRO were 

not able to submit their GAD Accomplishment Report to their respective Audit 

Team, contrary to Item V of COA Circular No. 2014-001 dated March 18, 2014, to 

wit:  

 

The Audited Agency shall submit a copy of the GAD Plan and 

Budget (GPB) to the COA Audit Team assigned to the agency 

within five (5) working days from the receipt of the approved plan 

from the PCW or their mother central offices, as the case may be. 

Likewise, a copy of the corresponding Accomplishment Report 

shall be furnished to the said Audit Team within five (5) working 

days from the end of January of the preceding year. 

 

The HSAC included in their GAD Accomplishment Report those activities 

conducted to address the COVID-19 situation in line with Section 4.1 of PCW MC 

2020-03, which allows all national government agencies and instrumentalities to 

review and revise, as necessary, their FY 2020 GPB to implement measures to 

address gender issues and concerns arising from the unequal status of their women 

and men stakeholders due to the COVID-19 situation. 

 

However, it was observed that the submitted GPB was not forwarded to PCW, 

in violation of Section 1.2.2.1 of the PCW MC No. 2019-02 dated August 1, 2019, 

which states that “All line departments, constitutional bodies, judicial and 

legislative bodies, attached agencies/bureaus, other executive offices (OEOs), and 

government-owned and/or – controlled corporations (GOCCs) shall prepare and 

submit their agency-consolidated GPB directly to PCW, for review and 

endorsement”.  

 



 

84 

 

On the other hand, the failure of the concerned regional offices to utilize the 

allocated budget for GAD-related activities, and to submit GAD Accomplishment 

Report to the HSAC-CO resulted in the failure of the agency to submit the 

consolidated Accomplishment Report to the PCW, in compliance with Section 1 of 

the PCW MC No. 2021-01 dated January 20, 2021. Consequently, the submitted 

GPB to the Audit Team lacks the endorsement from PCW. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to ensure the implementation 

of the GAD programs, project and activities and maximize the utilization of 

the allocated budget for its GAD-related activities to comply with Section 31 of 

the GPs of the GAA of FY 2020 (RA No. 11465), as revised by Section 4.3 of 

PCW MC No. 2020-03.  

 

We further recommended and Management agreed to instruct the: 

 

a. concerned official of the regional office to submit to the HSAC-CO the 
GAD Accomplishment Report of their respective regions for 

consolidation and submission to PCW and to the Audit Team; and  

 

b. OIC, Human Resource Development Division to strictly observe the 
prescribed deadline on the submission of GPB and its revision, if any and 

GAD Accomplishment Report to the PCW, and to the Audit Team.    

 

 We commended Management for the implementation of GAD activities 

despite the COVID-19 situation. 

  

Management Comment: 

 

The concerned regional offices commented that the non-compliance with the 

rules and regulations relative to GAD Plans and Programs were due to the 

following:  

 

a) The reconstitution of the HSAC from the HLURB pursuant to RA No. 
11201, which requires selection and placement of employees for HSAC 

and DHSUD. The recruitment, selection and placement (RSP) process is 

still on-going as of date.  

b) The declaration of a State of Calamity throughout the Philippines due to 
COVID-19 on March 16, 2020 pursuant to Proclamation No. 929. As a 

result, Luzon, including the NCR was placed under ECQ and followed 

by different types of quarantine restrictions as of date, which requires 

the government offices to implement an Alternative Work Arrangement.  

c) Limited number of personnel in the regional offices.  
 

The recommendations of the Audit Team will be complied with. 

 

 



 

85 

 

Programs and Projects Related to Senior Citizens and Persons with Disability (PWDs) 

 

19. Most of the ROs of HSAC failed to prepare and formulate specific plans, 
program and activities that would address the concerns of Senior Citizens and 

PWDs due to the effect of the transition period from HLURB to HSAC 

pursuant to the implementation of RA No. 11201 and the COVID-19 

pandemic.   

 

Section 32 of the GP of the GAA of FY 2020 (RA No. 11465) provides that 

“xxx. All agencies of the government shall formulate plans, programs and projects 

intended to address the concerns of senior citizens and persons with disability, 

insofar as it relates to their mandated functions, and integrate the same in their 

regular activities.” 

 

The observation on the compliance of the agency for Senior Citizen and 

PWDs plans and programs has already been pointed out in the CYs 2018 to 2019 

AARs with recommendation for the Management to instruct all the concerned 

officials to prepare and formulate plans, programs and projects intended for Senior 

Citizens and PWDs to address their concerns, and integrate the same in the regular 

activities of the agency.  

 

Verification disclosed that HSAC-CO continued the implementation of the 

following services and facilities: 

 

a) Provision of first-aid assistance to transacting public clientele especially 
Senior Citizens. 

b) Renders full assistance to PWDs and senior citizens by facilitating their 
official requests through the Public Affairs Division. 

c) Consider the recruitment and screening of PWDs. 
d) Continuous provision of priority lanes for transacting public.  
e) Senior citizen employees were given priority assistance preparatory to 

their retirement in government service, e.g., coordination with GSIS and 

PhilHealth as to change of membership status from Formal Economy 

Members to Lifetime Members. 

 

In addition, the following were implemented during the year:    

 

a) Hiring of consultant who is a senior citizen to formulate training design 
for continuing capacity building for adjudicators. 

b) Due to constraints caused by COVID-19 Pandemic, provision of shuttle 
services to employees, including senior citizens and PWD personnel. 

c) Provision of supplement, such as Vitamin C with Zinc, to employees 
including senior citizens and PWD personnel. 

 

On the other hand, in HSAC-ENCRO and WVRO, Management have 

integrated in their regular activities the plans, programs and projects intended to 



 

86 

 

address the concerns of the senior citizens and the PWD, while other ROs failed to 

prepare and formulate specific plans, program and activities for  Senior Citizens and 

PWDs due to the effect of the transition period from HLURB to HSAC and the 

COVID-19 pandemic.  

 

We reiterated our recommendation and Management agreed to instruct 

all the concerned officials to prepare and formulate plans, programs and 

projects intended for Senior Citizens and PWDs in accordance with Section 32 

of the GP of the GAA of FY 2020.  

 

 

Disaster Risk Reduction and Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation Projects 

 

20. Most of the ROs of HSAC failed to prepare and formulate plans, program and 
activities designed to enhance climate change, adaptation and mitigation and 

disaster risk reduction due to the effect of the transition period from HLURB 

to HSAC and the COVID-19 pandemic, contrary to Section 36 of the GPs of 

the GAA for FY 2020 (RA No. 11465).   

 

Section 36 of the GP of the GAA of FY 2020 (RA No. 11465) provides that 

“All agencies of the government shall plan and implement programs and projects, 

taking into consideration measures for climate change adaptation, mitigation, and 

disaster risk reduction, based on climate and disaster risk assessments. xxx”. 

 

In HSAC-CO and ENCRO, verification disclosed that the Management have 

been coordinating with the DHSUD for the conduct of Earthquake and Fire Drills in 

the newly-constructed HLURB Building in Kalayaan Avenue, Quezon City. 

 

The other ROs failed to prepare and formulate plans, program and activities 

designed to enhance climate change, adaptation and mitigation and disaster risk 

reduction due to the effect of the transition period from HLURB to HSAC and the 

COVID-19 pandemic.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct all the concerned 

officials to prepare and formulate plans, programs and projects taking into 

consideration measures for climate change adaptation, mitigation, and disaster 

risk reduction, based on climate and disaster risk assessments.  

 

Management comment: 

 

The Planning and Management Service (PMS) will be reminded to comply 

with the audit recommendation.

General Insurance of Government Properties (RA Np. 656) 

 

25. Some of the ROs of HSAC failed to insure all of their insurable assets and 
properties with the General Insurance Fund (GIF) of the GSIS, contrary to 

Section 5 of RA No. 656, as amended by PD No. 245 dated July 13, 1973; hence, 

exposing the agency’s properties from not being indemnified or compensated 

in cases of loss through fire, earthquake, storm or other casualties.  

 

Section 5 of RA No. 656, known as the “Property Insurance Law”, as 

amended by PD No. 245 dated July 13, 1973 provides that “Every government, 

except a municipal government below first class, is hereby required to insure its 

properties, with the Fund against any insurable risk herein provided and pay the 

premiums thereon, xxx”. 

 

Verification disclosed that HSAC-CO, STRO, BRO and WVRO were able to 

insure all their insurable assets and properties with the GIF of the GSIS, while the 

other regional offices such as HSAC-ENCRO, NLRO and CVRO failed to do so.   

 

It was disclosed that due to the transition period of HLURB to HSAC, various 

transfers of properties were observed; however, there was no formal partition of 

properties or guidelines from the Management on how the transfers will be done. 

Moreover, it was noted that various properties were still recorded in the books of 

account but the custody and possession were transferred to DHSUD. Hence, 

concerned officials cannot insure all its properties unless there is final partition.  

 

In HSAC-NTRO, NMRO and SMRO, there were no reports about the 

compliance on RA No. 656.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct all the concerned 

officials to ensure that all insurable assets and properties of the agency are 

properly insured with the GIF in compliance with Section 5 of RA No. 656, as 

amended by PD No. 245 after its final partition.  

 

Management comment: 

 
The non-compliance was due to the issues related in the settlement of 

ownership of PPE between HSAC and DHSUD.

Status of Audit Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges 

 

26. There was no audit suspensions, disallowances and charges issued for 2020.  
 

In HSAC-CO, the balance of the Receivables-Disallowances/Charges account 

as December 31, 2020 amounting to P1,080,190.00 pertained to the payment of 

COLA back pay to HLURB employees and payment of honorarium without proper 

authority.  

 

Likewise, audit disallowances in the amount of P162,881.34 with remaining 

balance P158,890.34 representing payment of travelling expenses incurred relative 

to cross posting of Regional Officers of the HLURB was not yet recognized in the 

books of accounts due to pending decision on the appeal and motion for 

reconsideration. 

 

In HSAC-ENCRO, the Notice of Disallowance amounting to P485,144.00, for 

the payment by the HLURB Board of its 2009 obligation with 2010 appropriations 

without the approval of the DBM, was fully settled by the persons liable during the 

year.  

 

Moreover, the issued Notice of Charge amounting to P6,370,000.00 in 

previous year was transferred to DHSUD pursuant to the implementation of RA No. 

11201.
