Dear Executive Director Perez: 

 
Management Letter (ML) on the Audit of the 

Commission on Population and Development (CPD) 

for the period January 1 to December 31, 2020 

 

 

1. Pursuant to Section 2, Article IX-D of the Philippine Constitution and Section 43 of 
the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines (PD No. 1445), we have audited the 
accounts and operations of the CPD for the period ended  December 31, 2020. The audit was 
conducted in accordance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, and the 
International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAIs).  Those standards require that 
we plan and perform the audit to obtain a reasonable basis for our conclusions. 
 

2. The audit  covered the financial accounts and operations of the CPD for the year ended 
December 31, 2020.  The audit was conducted to:  (a) verify the level of assurance that may be 
placed on management’s assertions on the financial statements (FSs); (b) determine the 
propriety of transactions, as well as the extent of compliance with laws, rules and regulations; 
(c) recommend measures to improve agency’s operations; and (d) determine the extent of 
implementation of prior year’s audit recommendations.  This ML covers the results of audit of 
the CPD Central and Regional Offices (RO), except for RO  IVB, where an ML was not 
submitted as of the date of this report. 
 

3. As at  July 16, 2021, the agency’s FSs as at year-end of calendar year (CY) 2020 were 
not submitted, hence the Audit Team was unable to express an opinion on the FSs of the CPD,  
and this ML was prepared in lieu of an Annual Audit Report for CY 2020. 
  
4. Deficiencies observed in the course of the audit were communicated to Management 
through Audit Observation Memoranda and also discussed with concerned Management 
officials and employees during the conferences including the unsubmitted audit report of RO

IVB. The significant audit observations and recommendations, including Management’s views 
and comments were incorporated in the report, where appropriate. 
 
 

A. OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

 

Financial Audit 

 
Non-submission of the consolidated FSs, other financial reports, supporting 
schedules/documents (SSs/SDs) 
 

Non-submission of the consolidated FSs, other financial reports, SSs/SDs as at year-end 

did not enable the performance of the necessary audit procedures to verify 

management’s assertions on the FSs and to render an opinion thereon. 

 

5. Section 60, Chapter 19, Volume 1, Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for 
National Government Agencies (NGAs) requires that all NGAs shall prepare and submit the 
year-end Trial Balance, FSs, supporting schedules as follows: 
                    

Office Deadline To be Submitted to 

Regional/Branches On or before January 31, of the 
following year 

 Regional Auditor 
 Central Office Chief 

Accountant 
Central/Head/Main February 14, of the following 

year 
 COA Auditor 
 Department of Budget and 

Management 
 COA- Government 

Accountancy Sector   
   
6. For the ROs, the deadlines are shown in Table 1:1 
 

Table 1. Deadlines of Submission of FSs, SSs and SDs

7. Verification revealed that of the 16 regional FSs, nine were submitted within the set 
deadline while six were submitted after the deadline. As a result, the consolidated FSs had not 
been prepared.

8. Further,  delays in the submission of the required financial reports/documents for CY 
2020 in the ROs IVA, VII, IX and XIII  are presented in Table 2 below:

within 10 days after 
the end of the month 

10 to 306 days CY 2020 TBs, JEVs, 
DVs and BRS were 
delayed; DVs for the 
period covering the 
months of November to 
December 2020 were 
not yet submitted 

IX 18 days September to December 
2020 TBs and SDs were 
not yet submitted 

XIII 16 to 355 days 408 out of 684 DVs 
were delayed 

 
9. According to the Accountant, the Central Office (CO) is still waiting for the copies of 
the audited FSs as at December 31, 2020 from the RO IVB, thus,  the specific date of 
submission of the consolidated FSs of the CPD could not be committed.  Only the unaudited 
FSs from the regions were available, except for the unsubmitted FSs of the RO IVB.  

 
10. We informed the CO Accountant that the submission of the audited regional FSs is not 
required for the preparation of the consolidated FSs, to which the Accountant agreed to and 
promised to comply. 
 
11. The non-availability of the ROs’ FSs and SDs did not enable the CO Accountant to 
prepare and submit on time the consolidated FSs as at year-end.  Consequently, the Audit 
Team was also precluded from verifying and ascertaining management’s assertions on the 
FSs, and from rendering an opinion on the same.  
 
12. We recommended and Management agreed to direct the CO Accountant to:  (a)  
follow-up the submission of the FSs from the RO IVB Accountant; and   (b)  prepare 

and submit to the Audit Team the complete set of consolidated FSs of the CPD for audit 

and verification. 

 

13. We also recommended that the CO Management require the Regional 
Accountants to submit the year-end TB, FSs and SS to the CO Accountant on or before 

January 31 of each year to ensure the preparation of the consolidated FSs and its 

submission to the Audit Team on or before February 14 of each year.

Accounting errors and omissions 
 
Accounting errors and omissions in the keeping of the accounts had resulted in the 

misstatements of some assets, liabilities and equity accounts.   

 

14. Section 15, Chapter 2, Volume I, GAM for NGAs requires the presentation in the FSs 
of the financial position, financial performance, and cash flows of an entity.  Fair presentation 
requires faithful presentation of the effects of the transactions, other events, and conditions in 
accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenues and 
expenses set out in applicable public sector accounting standards. 

 

15. Analysis and examinations of the accounts and transactions of the CO and ROs 
disclosed various accounting errors and omissions that misstated the year-end balances of 
assets, liabilities, expenses and net assets/equity, as shown in Table 3.

Accounting Deficiencies 
 

The completeness, accuracy, and existence of several assets and liabilities was not 

ascertained due to variances between the books and the property records and non-

compliance with accounting standards and other relevant issuances. 

 

17. Analysis of the accounts and related transactions of the CPD CO and 15 ROs disclosed 
various deficiencies that have affected the related accounts,  as summarized in Table 4:

a. Unliquidated fund transfers – P95,000.00 
 
18. On March 2, 2012, the RO V transferred P95,000.00 to Milaor, Camarines Sur for the 
implementation of the Responsible Parenthood-Family Planning (RP-FP) Program in CY 
2012.  The due date of liquidation based on the Memorandum of Agreement was one year 
from the date of release of the fund transfer.  The project was already completed, however, the 
fund transfer remained unliquidated in the books for more than six years as at  December 31, 
2020. 
 



9 
 

19. According to the RO V Management, follow-up of the Liquidation Report (LR) from 
Milaor, Camarines Sur was made when the Municipal Accountant and the Population Worker 
in charge of the RP-FP implementation was visited. The RP-FP Assistant took photos of the 
liquidation documents for the fund transfer. However, the concerned Population Officer did 
not submit the LR and refund the unutilized RP-FP fund.  
 
20. Whereas in RO VI, the original amount granted to the Process Foundation Panay, Inc. 
in November 2012 of P450,000.00 has a remaining balance of P64,700.00 as at December 31, 
2020 which had not been refunded as at year-end.   
 
21. With the non-submission of the LRs  and the failure to refund of the unexpended 
balances of the fund transfers by the Implement Agency (IA), the existence, completeness and 
accuracy of the account balances of the affected accounts were not determined.  
 

22. We recommended and Management of the ROs V and VI agreed to require the  
Accountant to demand from the IAs the immediate submission of the required LRs 

and/or the refund of any excess or unutilized balance of the fund transfers for 

liquidation. 
 

 

b. Unreconciled discrepancies in the PPE balances  between  the books and RPCPPE –
P42.653 million 

 

23. Comparison of the CO, NCR and ROs V, VIII and IX PPE balances per books against 
the RPCPPE as at December 31, 2020, disclosed a net unreconciled discrepancy of P42.464 
million. Details are shown in Table 5.

24. The non-reconciliation of accounting records and RPCPPE was caused, among others, by 
the following: 
 
 Unrecognized Asus laptop of P29,495.00 procured in prior years (NCR); 

 
 Lack of periodic reconciliation and GL balance included undetermined amount of 

disposed properties (RO V); 
 

 Unaccounted other transportation equipment of P15,600.00 reported in the RPCPPE 
with undertermined details (RO VIII); 

 
 Variance of P45,119.65 of Office Equipment still for reconciliation (RO IX); 

 
 RPCPPE reported repairs of the Motor Vehicles from CYs 1996 to 2020 already 

recognized in the books of accounts as expenses, and unreported procured shields of 
P44,700.00 recognized under Furniture and Fixtures in the books of accounts (NCR); 
  

  Office Equipment of P60,586.42 recognized under Other Assets  reclassified under 
Office Equipment in the books because the items were still serviceable unreported in 
the RPCPPE  (NCR); 

 
 Honda generator with property no. E101-001 erroneously reported in the RPCPPE 

under Office Equipment instead of under Other Machinery and Equipment (RO VIII); 
 

 Installation of a new transformer of P79,376.85 recognized in the GL in CY 2020 but 
not reported in the RPCPPE (RO IX); 

 
 No physical count conducted for property items recognized in the books under 

Communications Equipment, Books and Other PPE of P46,000.00, P57,671.50, and 
P50,387.40, respectively (RO IX);   

 
 Un-updated PPELCs (ROs V, IX and XIII),  non-maintenance of PCs (RO VIII); and 

 
 No proper turnover of PPELCs from the former to the incumbent Accountant (ROs 

VIII and XIII). 
 

25. With the non-reconciliation of PPE balances in the books of the CO, NCR, ROs V, 
VIII and IX with that of the physical count, the  existence, completeness and accuracy of the 
year-end balances of the affected PPE accounts were not determined. 



11 
 

 
26.  We recommended and Management of CO, NCR and ROs V, VIII and IX 
agreed to instruct the Accountants and Property/Supply Officers to properly maintain, 

regularly update, and reconcile their respective records, and effect the necessary 

adjustments/corrections in their respective books/records, if warranted. 

 
27. We also recommended and Management of the RO IX agreed to instruct the 
Inventory Committee to complete the conduct of physical inventory-taking and to 

submit the complete RPCPPE to the Audit Team and the Accounting Unit. 
 

c. Unreconciled discrepancies  of inventory balances between the books and RPCI-P10.242 
million 

 
28. Comparison of  the Accounting and Property records on inventories disclosed  a net 
discrepancy of P10.273 million, as shown in Table 6.

  Total 14,046,497.32 3,773,219.18 10,273,278.14 

 

29. The discrepancies between the accounting records and the RPCI were due to, among 
others, the following: 
 

 Unrecognized issuances of semi-expendable items such as the printer, usb wifi 
adapter, computer and executive tables, chairs, and filing cabinets (RO IX); 

 
 Ongoing reconciliation of the accounting and property records for Office Supplies 

Inventory and Other Supplies and Materials Inventory (RO IX); 
 
 Incomplete submission of RPCIs to the  Audit Team (RO XIII); 



12 
 

 
 Non-maintenance and non-updating of Supplies Ledger Cards (SLCs) (NCR and 

RO IX); and 
 
     Non-updating of Stock Cards (SCs) (NCR). 
 

30. The non-reconciliation of Inventory account balances in the books of the CO, NCR, 
ROs VIII and IX with that of the physical count did not enable the determination of the 
existence, completeness and accuracy of the year-end  balances of the affected inventory 
accounts. 
 
31. We recommended and Management of the CO, NCR and ROs VIII and IX 
agreed to direct the Accountants and the Property/Supply Officers to reconcile the 

inventory balances and make the necessary adjustments in their respective records. 

 

32. We also recommended and Management of the CO and concerned ROs agreed to 
require: (a) the Inventory Committee to complete the submission of the RPCIs to the 

Audit Team and the Accounting Unit; and (b) the Accountant to maintain and regular 

update the SLCs. 

 

33. We further recommended and Management agreed to require the Supply Officer 
to regularly update the SCs for each inventory item. 

 
d. Undetermined urecognized unserviceable/disposed properties 

 

34. Analysis of  Other Assets of the CO of P1.752 million at year-end revealed that there 
were reclassified unserviceable properties from the PPE accounts based on the Inventory and 
Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) as at June 30, 2014.  However, the 
composition/breakdown of the account balance could not be provided to the Audit Team for 
audit and verification.   
 
35. In CY 2020, the CO disposed unserviceable equipment and other materials of P0.593 
million reported in the approved IIRUP in CY 2020 which remained unrecognized in the 
books as at year-end because it was not determined if the disposed unserviceable items were 
recognized under Other Assets or the appropriate PPE accounts.   
 
36. In the RO VIII, included under Other Assets are unserviceable properties of P3.154 
million which were destroyed during the onslaught of Typhoon Yolanda.  A request for 
inspection and appraisal of the unserviceable assets were made in CY 2013. However, this 
was not acted upon and returned because of incomplete documentary requirements. In CY 
2020, the RO VIII submitted an IIRUP of P187,950.00 but was returned due to incompletely 
accomplished  IIRUP, where the details on the date of acquisition and property numbers not 
provided.  Accordingly, the unserviceable properties of P187,950.00 items were found in the 
premise but those totaling P2.966 million were already non-existent since these were washed 
out during the typhoon Yolanda. 
 



13 
 

37.  With the undetermined unrecognized unserviceable/disposed properties, the existence 
and accuracy of the balances of Other Assets and the related PPE accounts could not be 
determined. 

 

38. We recommended and Management of the CO agreed to require the Chief, Asset 
Management Section (AMS) to: (a) conduct a complete inventory and inspection of all 

unserviceable properties duly witnessed by the Audit Team; and (b) cause the immediate 

disposal of the unserviceable properties. 

 

39. We also recommended and Management of the CO agreed to direct the 
Accountant to:  (a) determine the composition of the  unserviceable properties of P1.752 

million recognized under Other Assets in CY 2014;  (b) recognize in the books the 
disposed unserviceable items after determination of whether the same were recognized 

under Other Assets or the appropriate PPE accounts. 
 

40. We recommended and Management of the RO VIII agreed to require the 
Property/Supply Officer to refile request for the disposal pertaining to located items 

with the duly accomplished IIRUP and file the application for relief from the property 

accountability for the non-existing properties destroyed by Typhoon Yolanda. 

 

e. Undetermined misclassification of program-related expenses under Subsidies-Others 
 
41. Analysis of the  general ledger of Subsidies-Others  and verification of the JEVs and 
the Advice to Debit Account Disbursements Journal (ADADJ) for the period January 1 to 
December 31, 2020  in the CO showed that recorded transactions were composed of expenses 
incurred for the implementation of regular agency programs, such as issuances of family 
planning commodities, payment for services rendered by Contract of Support/Technical 
Service employees, purchase of supplies and meals served during the conduct of various 
trainings, and adjustments for misclassification of accounts, among others. The use of 
Subsidies-Others in the recognition of the project-related expenses was also observed in RO 
VI. 

 
42. As explained by a personnel of the Government Accountancy Sector, this 
Commission, such expenses should be itemized and recognized  under the appropriate 
accounts.  Subsidies-Others is used to recognize financial assistance given to indigents and 
other NGOs/CSOs as beneficiary such that it is not the appropriate account to use for 
recognizing project-related expenses.  

 
43. As a result, the misclassification of project-related expenses under  Subsidies-Others 
affected the completeness and accuracy of its account balance and that of the related accounts 
to which project-related expenses should have been recognized.  
 

44. We recommended that Management of the CO and RO VI require the 
Accountants to recognize  project-related expenses under the appropriate accounts.  

 



14 
 

45. During the exit conference, the CO officials explained that it followed only what was  
the approved budget in the General Appropriations Act (GAA). Management wanted to clear 
the issue with the Department of Budget and Management (DBM). 
 
Auditor’s Rejoinder 

 
46. Accounting for disbursements does not necessarily follow the budget line items. The 
Commission prescribes the accounting standards and policies for government transactions and 
such is not within the mandate of the DBM.   

 
 

Compliance Issues  

 

Unauthorized medical benefits 
 
Grant of  annual medical services to the CPD CO personnel, with partial payments of 

P215,207.00, as additional allowance or compensation in the form of medical packages 

without authority from the Office of the President unnecessarily increased the expenses 

of the agency.  

 

47. Section 8, Article IX-B of the 1987 Constitution states that, “No elective or appointive 
public officer or employee shall receive additional, double the consent of Congress, any 
present, emolument, office or title of any kind from any foreign government.” 

 
48. Moreover, Section 12 of R.A. No. 6758 or the Salary Standardization Law provides 
that all allowances, except for representation and transportation allowances; clothing and 
laundry allowances; subsistence allowance of marine officers and crew on board government 
vessels and hospital personnel; hazard pay, allowances of foreign service personnel stationed 
abroad; and such other additional compensation not otherwise specified herein as may be 
determined by the DBM, shall be deemed included in the standardized salary rates herein 
prescribed.  Such other additional compensation, whether in cash or in kind, being received by 
incumbents only as of July 1, 1989 not integrated into the standardized salary rates shall 
continue to be authorized. 

 
49. Section 5(A) of PhilHealth Circular No. 2019-003 states that "All members under 
the Formal Economy (employed), Lifetime members, and Senior Citizens and their qualified 
dependents shall be eligible to avail of the expanded primary care benefit in accredited 
Expansion of the Primary Health Care Benefit (EPCB) Health Care Institutions (HCIs)." 

 
50. Section 5(B) of the said circular also states that "The expanded PCB shall include 
health screening and assessment, diagnostic services, follow up consultations, and medicines." 
 
51. Section 5 of PD No. 1597 states that the President has the exclusive legal authority to 
grant additional allowances and other fringe benefits, upon recommendation of the DBM 

 



15 
 

52. Review of the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) entered into by and between the 
CPD CO and the Philippine Heart Center (PHC) revealed that the latter will provide and 
render medical services to its 88 personnel in the amount of P10,000.00 for each employee.  

 
53. The mode of payment shall be on a send bill arrangement based on the actual 
procedures conducted on the employee with a total amount of package per employee not to 
exceed P10,000.00.  It shall consist of mandatory medical procedures of P6,173.00 and 
P3,827.00 for the follow up.  A separate amount of P11,000.00 shall be paid to cover the cost 
of the mandatory random drug testing of 44 CPD-CO employees at P250.00 per employee.  
The contract covered medical services which included hospital charges and professional fees 
as mentioned in the same MOA.  The certification as to the availability of fund to cover these 
medical services totaled P0.891million.   
 
54. Moreover, the said MOA rests on Administrative Order (AO) No. 402, series of 1998 
on the establishment of a medical check-up program for government personnel, and Civil 
Service Commission Memorandum Circular 33, series of 1997 on the policy on working 
conditions at the workplace which we do not conform with.  Under AO No.  402, however, the 
provision of an annual medical check-up for government officials and employees was 
authorized in the meantime that the benefit is not yet integrated under the National Health 
Insurance Program (NHIP) being administered by the Philippine Health Insurance 
Corporation (PHIC). The benefit package includes physical examination, chest x-ray, 
complete blood count (CBC), urinalysis, stool examination and ECG.    

 
55. The medical services, which is the subject of the said contract, constitutes additional 
allowance or compensation in the form of medical services to the employees considering that 
the same was not specifically provided under the Salary Standardization Law, hence, a 
violation of Section 8, Article IX-B of the 1987 Constitution.   

 
56. As at  December 31, 2020, the CO already paid to the PHC the total amount of 
P215,207.00 which covered a cash bond of P100,000.00 based on another Hospital 
Accreditation Agreement between the PHC and CPD and medical services for 17 personnel 
totaling P115,207.00. The payment was recognized under Other Professional Services. The 
cash bond may be utilized for the hospital and professional services extended to the regular 
employees of the CPD and any liabilities for such hospital bills arising from the said 
agreement is in no way limited to such sum. Any remaining amount upon termination, shall be 
returned by the PHC to CPD without interest within 30 days from the date of termination. 

 
57. The NCR granted its employees a similar package in the amount of P117,800.00  
which was paid  to the PHC under Check No. 23383 dated  December 22, 2020.  For RO IVA, 
Management informed that it has not disbursed any amount related to the medical services in 
CY 2020. 

 
58. The payment for medical services for CPD employees without authorization from the 
Office of the President had unnecessarily increased the CPD’s expenses as at year-end.   

 



16 
 

59. We recommended that Management of the CO (a)  discontinue the grant of  
medical services to its employees at the agency’s expense; and  (b) advise all the regions 

which similarly granted/paid medical services, to discontinue said transaction.  

 
60. Management did not agree with our recommendation and believed that the grant of the 
annual medical check-up for CY 2020 is not a grant of an additional allowance or 
compensation that runs counter with Section 8, Article IX-B of the 1987 Constitution and 
Section 12 of RA No. 6758.  AO No. 402 on the establishment of a medical check-up program 
for government personnel was pointed out also.  And it also pointed out that this is similar to 
the case of the Philippine Institute for Development Studies (PIDS) vs. COA wherein the 
grant of the annual medical check-up program of the PIDS, was granted pursuant to the 
approval of the Office of the President on March 1, 2000. 
 
Auditor’s Rejoinder  
 
61. The Audit Team expressed their stand that the grant of medical and health care 
benefits constitutes additional benefit, which is prohibited under RA No. 6758. JR No. 04, s. 
2009, which was further enacted to revise the Compensation and Position Classification 
System established under RA. No. 6758.  The CPD cannot just unilaterally use government 
funds in the absence of prior recommendation of the DBM and most importantly the approval 
of the President, hence the case of the Philippine Institute for Development Studies (PIDS) vs. 
COA  cannot be applied because it involved the establishment of the annual medical check-up 
program of the PIDS, pursuant to the approval of the Office of the President on March 1, 2000 
or before the implementation of the Universal Health Care PCB1 Package. The letter dated 
July 13, 2007 of the PhilHealth stating that it has not yet included the annual medical check-
up in the benefit package was also issued before the implementation of the PCB1.  

 
62. Moreover, Section 9 Chapter 3 of RA No. 11223 states that “Every member shall be 
granted immediate eligibility for health benefit package under the Program.” This shall mean 
that the CPD employees, being direct contributors are already qualified to avail of the health 
benefits under the NHIP. 
 
 
Delayed submission of procurement documents 
 
Delayed submission of the procurement documents and improperly accomplished 

Purchase Order (POs) precluded the timely verification and conduct of technical and 

auditorial review of procurements of goods and services.   

 

63. Section 3.2.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated 12 February 2009 on the 
submission and review process of Purchase Orders (POs) provides that a copy of any PO 
irrespective of amount, and each and every supporting document, shall, within five working 
days from issuance thereof, be submitted to the Auditor concerned. Within the same period, 
the Auditor shall review and point out to management defects and/or deficiencies, if any. 
 
64. Appendices 61 and 62, Volume II of the GAM for NGAs, prescribes the guidelines in 
the preparation of the POs and the Inspection and Acceptance Report (IAR), respectively.  



17 
 

Stated at the back of the said appendices are clear guidelines on how to accomplish the said 
forms. 

 
65. Verification of documents received from the Management of the CO, NCR and ROs 
III and IVA showed the following delays in the submission of the PO and POs in CO, NCR, and 
RO IVA were not properly accomplished.  Details of delays in the submission of the POs are 
shown in Table 7.

66. The delays in the submission of POs precluded the Audit Team from conducting 
auditorial review of the  POs and related documents for the procurement of goods and 
services, and the timely communication of the results of audit to Management. 
 
67. We recommended and Management agreed to require the CO and NCR, ROs III, 
IVA Property/Supply Officer to ensure that complete POs are submitted within the 

prescribed period. 

 

 
Non-submission of documents for disbursements 
 
Non-submission of disbursement vouchers and supporting documents for disbursements 

totaling P10.212 million for seven ROs did not enable the determination of the validity, 

regularity and propriety of the related transactions.   

 
68. Review of the CPD’s submitted financial documents relative to various disbursements 
disclosed that payments of some expenditures were not duly supported with DVs and the 
related SDs, as shown in Table 8.

70. We recommended and Management of concerned ROs agreed to require the 
Accountants to comply with the submission of the DVs and other documentary 

requirements to provide the bases for the determination of the validity, regularity and 

propriety of the related transactions.  
 
 
Compliance with Other Mandatory Accounts/Areas  

 
COVID-19-Pandemic Response and Recovery Interventions 
 
71. For CY 2020, the CPD had not received funds specifically for Coronavirus Disease 
2019 (COVID-19) response and/or recovery but had utilized its budget for related expenses.   

 
72. The COVID-19-related expenses of the CO and ROs I to IVA, V to IX, XII and XIII 
charged to Personnel Services (PS) and Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE) 
totaled P1.121 million and P9.902 million, respectively. The results of audit of these COVID-
related transactions are as follows: 

 
On the provision of supplies/materials for hazard control 

 
73. Paragraph B, Section VI of Administrative Order (AO) No. 2020-0015 of the 
Department of Health (DOH) on Risk-based Public Health Standards Across Settings provides 
that at the minimum, all actors shall implement the prescribed interventions in various settings 
as presented under Annex A-Required Public Health Standards Across All Settings as of April 
27, 2020, depending on their Risk Severity Grading.  For each prescribed intervention, 
concrete examples of corresponding hazard controls (e.g. engineering control, administrative 
control, and Personal Protective Equipment are provided. Column D-Offices/Workplaces of 
Annex A listed the administrative controls and Personal Protective Equipment for 
offices/workplace, such as the provision of tissues, masks, among others.  On the other hand, 
engineering and administrative controls include placement of hand washing facilities, hand 
sanitizers and dispensers with alcohol-based solution in all entrances, exits and areas with 
high foot traffic and facilities. 

 
74. Whereas, Paragraph B, Section VII of the same AO provides that NGAs shall develop 
and submit their sector-specific plans and guidelines on the operationalization of the risk-
based public health standards to the DOH. 

 
75. The CO issued Memorandum No. 2020-259 dated May 26, 2020 on the Guidelines on 
the CPD Health and Safety Protocols to be adopted by all ROs during the Community 
Quarantine in the Philippines due to COVID-19 Pandemic.  In addition, Memorandum No. 
2020-503 dated August 24, 2020 was issued regarding the Work Arrangement and Health and 
Safety Protocols during the General Community Quarantine (GCQ) to be observed by all CPD 
officials and employees. 
 
76. As at December 31, 2020, the CPD incurred a total of P5.995 million for the 
procurement of essential supplies from various suppliers in response to the COVID-19 
pandemic, such as facemasks, face shields, alcohols, hand sanitizers, foot baths, disinfectants, 



20 
 

among others.  These were used in the office premises and distributed to all CPD personnel, 
COS/JO workers and program beneficiaries like the Senior Citizens (SCs) and Person With 
Disability (PWD). Moreover, Information, Education and Communication (IEC) materials 
totaling P0.581 million, such as tarpaulins for COVID-19 Information, health advisories and 
program promotions to the public during the pandemic, were produced. 
 
On the provision of transportation facilities to employees on skeleton workforce  
 
77. Item C, Section 4.0 of Civil Service Commission (CSC) Memorandum Circular (MC) 
No. 18, s. 2020 states that reasonable transportation facilities and housing quarters shall be 
provided to employees assigned as skeleton workforce, whenever practicable, and subject to 
budgeting, accounting and auditing rules and regulations. 

 
78. The CPD provided transportation services for mobility support to employees during 
the pandemic and incurred fuel expenses totaling P474,776.40.   In addition, rented shuttle 
services were provided to the regular/JO employees of the RO X at a total rental cost of 
P216,938.51 and reimbursement for traveling expenses incurred by the RO XIII in the 
installation of COVID-19 IEC materials totaled P1,200.00.  
 
On the grant of hazard pay to employees during the ECQ 
 
79. Section 1 of AO No. 26 dated March 23, 2020 of the Office of the President authorized 
the NGAs to grant COVID-19 Hazard Pay to personnel who physically reported for work 
during the implementation of the Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) in their respective 
work stations, in an amount not exceeding P500.00 per day per person.  
 
80. Personnel who are already entitled to Hazard Pay, Hazardous Duty Pay, Hazard 
Allowance or other similar benefits under existing laws, issuances, rules and regulations, such 
as public health workers, public social workers, science and technology personnel and military 
and uniformed personnel, shall continue to be entitled to such benefits or the COVID-19 
Hazard Pay, whichever is higher. 
 
81. Section 2 of the same AO provides the conditions on the grant of the COVID-19 
Hazard Pay and that the heads of government agencies may grant the COVID-19 Hazard Pay 
to their personnel/workers without the need for further approval by the DBM, subject to the 
following guidelines and conditions:  

 
a) The personnel are occupying regular, contractual or casual positions, or are workers 

engaged through COS/JOs, or other similar schemes. 
 
b) The personnel/workers have been authorized to physically report for work at their 

respective offices or work stations on the prescribed official working hours by the 
head of agency/office during the period of implementation of ECQ measures in the 
area of such office or work station. 

 
c) The total rate of the COVID-19 Hazard Pay shall be based on the number of days an 

employee/worker physically reports for work during the ECQ period using the 



21 
 

formula under Section 1, which is P500 multiplied by the number of days physically 
reporting for work during the quarantine period. 

 
82. Review of the transactions recognized under Hazard Pay and Other Professional 
Services for CY 2020 disclosed that the CPD granted COVID-19 hazard pay at P500/day to 
regular/plantilla officials and employees and COS/Service Agreement personnel totaling 
P1.199 million and P2.064 million, respectively, who reported to office during the ECQ and 
Modified ECQ in the country. 
 
83. Examination of the relevant DVs on the grant of hazard pay showed that the payments 
were supported with office orders of employees including COS/Service Agreement  for 
personnel authorized to work during the ECQ and MECQ, Daily Time Records (DTRs) and 
summary of all personnel who actually rendered service as Skeleton Work Force during the 
ECQ and MECQ.   The CPD also took into consideration the payments of hazard pay to 
regular employees in relation to the Magna Carta Benefits and recognized whichever is higher 
between the grant of COVID-19 Hazard Pay or Magna Carta Benefits-Hazard Pay as provided 
in AO No. 26.  

 
Other expenses incurred in relation to COVID-19 pandemic response 

 
84. The CPD incurred a total of P166,943.30 for the meals distributed to employees who 
reported for work during the ECQ and on the conduct of various COVID-19 orientations. In 
addition, a total amount of P9,309.00 was paid for the honoraria of resource persons for the 
orientations on Basic Concepts, Principles, and Tips on Handling and Managing a Helpline on 
RP-FP during the COVID-19 Health Crisis and COVID-19 Work from Home and Mental 
Health. The RT-PCR tests totaling P187,700.00 were also conducted on some CPD personnel 
and COVID-related communication expenses amounting to P127,167.99 were provided.  
 
 

Gender and Development (GAD) 

 
The annual GPB of  the CO and its 15 ROs were prepared for the implementation of 

GAD activities in CY 2020, except in RO VI wherein, the GPB was not PCW-endorsed 

and the GAD AR was not submitted to the Audit Team within the prescribed period, 

precluding the timely evaluation of the implementation of the  GPB. 

 
85. Section 31 of the GAA for FY 2020 (RA No. 11465) provides that, all agencies of the 
government shall formulate a GAD Plan designed to address gender issues within their 
concerned sectors or mandate and implement the applicable provisions under RA  No. 9710 or 
the Magna Carta of Women, Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
Against Women, the Beijing Platform for Action, the Philippine Plan for Gender Response 
Development (1995-2025) and the Philippine Development Plan (2017-2022). 
 
86. It also provides that the GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of the 
agencies, which shall be at least five per cent of their budgets. 

 



22 
 

87. The Audited agency shall submit a copy of the Annual GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) 
to the COA Audit Team assigned to the agency within five working days from the receipt of 
the approved plan from the PCW (Philippine Commission on Women) or their mother or 
central office, as the case maybe. Likewise, a copy of the corresponding Accomplishment 
Report (AR) shall be furnished the said Audit Team within five working days from the end of 
January of the preceding year.2 
 
88. The CO and 15 of its ROs had prepared the annual GPB for the implementation of 
GAD-related activities for CY 2020 and implemented their programs/activities.  The CPD 
mainstreamed GAD activities in the conduct of its mandated functions by integrating issues 
and concerns into the program areas, especially on Responsible Parenthood and Family 
Planning and Adolescent Health and Development activities.  

 
89. On the other hand, in  the RO VI, the CY 2020 GPB was not endorsed by the PCW 
and was not submitted to the Audit Team on due date. The RO VI’s GAD Focal Person for 
Support submitted the consolidated regional CY 2020 GPB and the CY 2020 GAD AR only 
on March 12, 2021, after the request made by the Audit Team.  It was also noted that the CY 
2020 GPB and CY 2019 GAD AR, submitted together with the CY 2020 AR, were not also 
authenticated by the Gender Mainstreaming Monitoring System (GMMS). 

 
90. The delay in the submission of the GPBs and GAD ARs precluded the timely conduct 
of audit on the utilization of GAD funds for the purpose of determining its judicious use. Non-
submission of PCW-endorsed GPBs and ARs had not confirmed that the plans, budget and 
accomplishments were properly reviewed to address the gender issues towards the realization 
of the country’s commitments, policies on women empowerment and gender equality 
depending on the thrusts set by the PCW. 
 
91. We recommended and Management of RO VI agreed to make representation 
with the CO to furnish the RO VI with the copy of PCW-endorsed, GMMS-

authenticated with barcode, CY 2020 GPB and CY 2019 GAD AR, and once available, to 

submit a copy thereof to the Audit Team, for audit and verification.  

 

92. During the exit conference, GAD Focal Person showed a copy of the PCW-endorsed, 
GMMS-authenticated and barcoded, consolidated GAD Plan and Budget for CY 2020 of the 
CPD, for transmittal to the Audit Team. Relative to the GAD AR of CY 2019, a letter will be 
sent to CPD-CO to inquire the submission of such report. 
 

 

Senior Citizens and Persons with Disability 

 
93. Section 32 of the General Provisions of the GAA for FY 2020 (RA No. 11465) 
provides that all agencies of the government shall formulate plans, programs and projects 
intended to address the concerns of senior citizens and persons with disability, insofar as it 
relates to their mandated functions, and integrate the same in their regular activities.  
 

                                                           
2 Item V of COA Circular 201-001 dated March 18, 2014 



23 
 

94. Moreover, all government infrastructure and facilities shall provide architectural or 
structural features, designs or facilities that will reasonably enhance the mobility, safety and 
welfare of persons with disability pursuant to the Batas Pambansa Blg. 344 and RA No. 7277, 
as amended. 
  
95. For CY 2020, the CO, NCR and ROs I to III, V and VI, and IX to XIII have 
formulated and accomplished their respective plans and programs intended to address the 
concerns of SCs and PWDs such as conduct of Responsible Parenthood and Family Planning 
orientations,  SCs’ activities, and distribution of Nutrition Health tips, among others. 
 
Programs Related to Youth  

 

96. Section 33 of the General Provisions of the FY 2020 GAA (RA No. 11465) provides 
that all agencies of the government shall provide allocations for youth development projects 
and activities within the framework of the Philippine Youth Development Plan (2017-2022). 
 
97. The Adult Health and Youth Development aims to improve the well-being of 
adolescents 15-24 years old and hope to reduce the incidence of teenage pregnancy and early 
marriages, substance abuse and HIV aids. 

 
98. For CY 2020, the CO, NCR and ROs I, IVA, V, X, and XIII had conducted various 
activities for youth development, such as online sessions with Facebook live, Adolescent 
Health and Development Films and teenage pregnancy symposium, among others, despite the 
pandemic situation in the country. Innovative ways and strategies to reach the adolescents, by 
maximizing the online and social media platform due to the restrictions in a face-to-face 
activity, had been made.  
 
 
Tax Laws and Regulations, GSIS and Pag-IBIG Premium Contributions and Loan 
Amortizations, and PhilHealth Premium Contributions 
 

Non-remittance of taxes withheld in RO III and delay in remittances of the mandatory 

contributions to GSIS in RO XII  may affect the employees’ entitlements to the related 

benefits.  

 

 

99. The CPD had substantially complied with the withholding and remittances of 
mandatory deductions and loan amortizations, pursuant to the rules and regulation issued by 
the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR), Government Service Insurance System (GSIS), Pag-
IBIG and PhilHealth Contributions except for some deficiencies noted in the ROs III and XII.  
For CY 2020, the withholding taxes and mandatory deductions and remittances to the BIR, 
GSIS, Pag-IBIG and PhilHealth are summarized in Table 9.

           The above figures excluded the amounts, if any, in the unsubmitted ML of RO IVB. 
 

100. The ending balances of Due to BIR  were all remitted on January 5 to 9, 2021. In RO 
III, taxes withheld in prior years were not remitted as at year-end in the amount of 
P132,368.89 which  remained outstanding in the books of accounts. 

 
101. The  amounts during the year for Due to GSIS, Pag-IBIG and PhilHealth were all 
remitted within the prescribed period, except  for the GSIS remittance of RO XII. 

 
102. In the RO XII, there was a delay in the remittance of the GSIS premium contributions 
of P4,760.91 due to the late updating of the GSIS web-based system wherein the premium 
contributions were not updated for individual accounts for the salary increase under the Salary 
Standardization Law and for the new recruits.  Thus, the premium contributions were only 
remitted on  April 22, 2021. 

 
103. We recommended and Management of the RO III agreed to: (a) coordinate with 
the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) South Pampanga 21B and submit all required 

forms and documents to the said office to facilitate reconciliation in determining any tax 

dues of the agency, if any, and copy furnish the Audit Team; (b) require the Accountant 

to effect the necessary adjustments in the books; and (c) remit all taxes due to the BIR 

within the prescribed period.  

 

104.  We also recommended and Management of RO XII agreed to require the 
Accountant to ensure the timely remittances of withheld amounts with the GSIS and to 

have the premium contributions of new recruits updated in the GSIS web-based system 

for individual accounts to ensure timely remittance of the said contributions to the GSIS. 

 
 

GSIS Property Insurance Law  
 

105. RA No. 656 or the Property Insurance Law, as amended, requires all properties of the 
government to be insured with the Government Insurance Fund (GIF) administered by the 
GSIS. Section 5 of the said law states that, every government, except a municipal government 
below first class, is required to insure its property with the fund against any insurable risk 
therein and pay the premiums thereon. 
 
106. The CO, NCR and ROs I, IVA, VI, VIII to XII, and XIII had fully complied with the 
requirement of the insurance law, with the PPE insured with the GIF of the GSIS for a total 
premium of P0.584 million paid in CY 2020.  However, the properties of the RO V were 
insured on a selective basis due to limited budget.  
 



25 
 

107. On the other hand, no information about compliance with property insurance law was 
reported for the CAR, ROs II, III and VII.   
 
 
Hiring of Contractual/ Job Order Personnel 

  
108. The CSC-COA-DBM JC No. 1, series of 2017 and DBM and COA JC No. 2, s. 2020 
dated  October 20, 2020 provides the rules and regulations governing Job Order (JO) workers 
and consultants of the government.  Results of the audit on the payrolls for the services of the 
JO workers and consultants in the CO and ROs disclosed that the concerned personnel 
remitted their share directly to the SSS, PhilHealth and Pag-IBIG as specified in their contract.  
Copy of the Official Receipt was furnished the Human Resource Development (HRD) unit 
every 5th day of the month following the end of each quarter. 
 
109. As at  December 31, 2020, CPD hired a total of 285 JOs and consultants, representing 
an additional workforce to the existing regular plantilla personnel in the CO and ROs.  These 
personnel provide administrative and technical assistance, and such other related functions as 
may be assigned.  The salaries of these JOs and consultants were charged against the MOOE 
of the regular appropriations. 
  
 
Status of Settlement of Disallowances, Suspensions and Charges 
 
110. For CY 2020, several disallowances were issued in the CO, NCR and ROs IVA and 
XIII which covered the payments on Magna Carta benefits totaling P14.370 million and 
reimbursement of travelling expenses of P93,355.00 to the RO XIII employees. A 
disallowance on terminal leave benefits of P459.13 was also issued to an employee in the RO 
II.  Settlements  of P105,602.72 in the CO and five regions were made. Of the said 
settlements, P50,175.78 pertains suspensions in ROX III under NS Nos. 2019-001, 2019-002
