Part II – Observations and Recommendations





Financial and Compliance Audit



1. 	The Scale Model of a traditional Kankana-ey Village costing ₱895,000.00 for the IPED-based Research Center in MPSPC Tadian Campus was not accepted by the Inspection Team due to several deficiencies noted in its fabrication because of “rushed workmanship” as claimed by the project leader which resulted in the project’s non-completion within its target due date. 

	1)	Item IV of the approved project proposal for the Enhancing the Engineering/Cultural Education through an IPED-based Research Center states, among others, that, “The proposed project aims to strengthen the role of MPSPC in the conservation and promotion of the Igorot culture and traditions but it will also serve as the educational immersion venue for students and other interested individuals in effectively understanding the Kankana-ey culture and traditions at the same time connecting such culture with the present generation.”

1.2. 	The project’s work plan and team composition, qualifications and terms of reference specified the following activity, among others, as part of its milestones, viz:



Activitiy

Person Involved

Responsibility

Time Frame/Duration of Involvement

Fabrication of a traditional Kankana-ey Village Scale Model

Project Leader

Work closely with the architect in the setting up of the scale model

Month 1 to 11



1.3.	The total project cost requested for funding from the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) is ₱4,900,000.00.  Of this amount, the detailed line item budget indicated that the amount allotted for the Fabrication of a traditional Kankana-ey Village Scale Model is ₱2,300,000.00.  



1.4.	The CHED approved the aforementioned project proposal and released the corresponding fund transfer to the College on September 2019 for the total amount of ₱4,900,000.00.  The target implementation period was pegged at twelve (12) months, i.e. October 2019 to September 2020.



1.5.	Perusal of PO No. 19-Oct-287TC dated December 12, 2019 revealed that the Fabrication of a Scale Model of a traditional Kankana-ey Village was awarded to a contractor with business address at Poblacion, Basista, Pangasinan.  The total project cost was ₱895,000.00.



1.6.	The project leader stated that the winning bidder had sufficient experience in the fabrication of similar miniature works and that he recommended their services since the other two contractors who submitted their quotations had no previous experience in the fabrication of scale models whatsoever.



1.7.	The Chairperson of the Inspection Team revealed that during their initial inspection on June 25, 2020, they noted various deficiencies in the work accomplishments which did not conform to the specifications per purchase order.  The project leader and representative of the supplier were with them during that time so they had first-hand knowledge of such defects.  The supplier requested to be given time to make necessary corrections which was subsequently granted.



1.8.	However, the succeeding inspection still yielded blatant defects in the workmanship.  Hence, the Inspection Team decided not to accept the scale model.  Review of the observations noted during the subject inspection showed that there were more than twenty deficiencies noted. 



1.9.	Moreover, verification of the Liquidation Report on the said fund transfer as of December 31, 2020 showed that there is still an unutilized balance of ₱1,108,680.55 even after the lapse of the 12-month time frame for the project’s implementation.



1.10.	The project leader explained that the contractor may have inadvertently “rushed his work accomplishment” since he was in a hurry to go home to his business address and there were several restrictions on travel during the construction period due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  He admitted that these delays have affected the implementation of the project so they had requested for a six-month extension from CHED.  Approval, however, is still pending since the Board of Trustees have yet to act on the matter.



1.11.	The non-acceptance of the Scale Model of a traditional Kankana-ey Village due to its technical deficiencies because of alleged “rushed workmanship” resulted in delayed procurement of a key project activity in the establishment of the IPED-based Research Center and was also contributory to the non-implementation of the same within the prescribed time frame.



1.12. 	We recommended and the project leader of the Enhancing the Engineering/Cultural Education through an IPED-based Research Center, as the end-user, agreed to coordinate with the supplier for the immediate rectification of the noted deficiencies in the Scale Model of a traditional Kankana-ey Village. 







1.13.	We further recommended and Management agreed to compel the supplier to promptly deliver the said scale model pursuant to the specifications in the Purchase Order and institute remedial measures against the erring entity, when deemed appropriate.

1)	The cost of six landholdings of the College was not recorded in the books of accounts, resulting in understatement of the land account by the commensurate value of the subject real properties.



2.1.	Section 3, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume states, among others, that, “The cost of an item of PPE shall be recognized as assets if, and only if xxx c. beneficial ownership and control clearly rest with the government.”



	1)	Section 5 of the same Manual further provides, that, “PPE that qualifies for recognition as an asset shall be measured at cost. However, where the PPE is acquired through a non-exchange transaction, its cost shall be measured at its fair value as at the date of acquisition.”



	2)		Verification of the subsidiary ledger of the Land account and perusal of the Status Report of the College’s Landholdings, together with its supporting documents, revealed that there were six landholdings of the College which were not recorded in the books of accounts, viz:

Not recorded in the books; MPSPC Barlig Campus is not operational at present



	3)	The Vice President for Administration and Finance explained that due to the on-going processing of the ownership documents for the 28 hectare lot at Tadian, Mountain Province and the 0.1624 hectare lot at Baang, Banao, Bauko, there was no basis for Management to record their corresponding costs in the books of accounts.



	4)	In the case of the 100 hectare lot at Balidong, Lubon, Tadian, Mountain Province and the 7.3881 hectare lot at Mount Data, Bauko, the MOA entered into between the College and Barangay Lubon and DENR, respectively, also did not provide for any costs, these being non-exchange transactions.  Moreover, the demo farm established at Balidong is no longer operational while the College of Forestry originally put up in Mount Data, Bauko was closed for several years already.



	5)	For the 0.9604 hectare lot at Barlig, Mountain Province, he claimed that talks for its development did not push through so the ownership documents were not processed by Management.    Proclamation No. 519, s. 1940 signed by then President Manuel L. Quezon, reserved three parcels of the public domain situated in Poblacion, Barlig, Mountain Province for school purposes.



	6)	He further attested that the Taskforce on Landholdings has been doing its best to expedite the transfer procedures and resolve related disputes to secure the final ownership documents, i. e. Title Certificates under the name of the College.  



	7)	The non-recording in the books of accounts of these six landholdings, which the College has clear control and ownership, understated the land account by their commensurate fair value as at the date of acquisition.



	8)	We recommended and the Director for Accounting Services agreed to record the 0.4206 hectare lot at Poblacion, Bontoc, Mountain Province where the Academic Building of MPSPC, Bontoc Campus is located, at its fair market value of ₱1,116,000.00 by debiting the land account. 



	9)	We further recommended and Management agreed that for the other five landholdings, it shall promptly coordinate with the concerned government agencies and other stakeholders to expedite the release of the ownership documents and subsequently, record the corresponding fair market values of these properties in the College’s books of accounts.



3.	Eighty-one job order (JO) personnel rendered continuous service for a maximum of eleven months, contrary to Section 1.a.2 of CSC Resolution No. 02-0790 dated June 5, 2002, while 73 other JO workers served for three to six months, rendering inconsistency in the application of the policies and guidelines regarding contracts of service of JOs that may lead to adverse human resource issues.



3.1.	Section 1.a.2 of CSC Resolution No. 02-0790 dated June 5, 2002 states that, “The Job Order covers piece of work or intermittent job of short duration not exceeding six months and pay is on a daily basis.”



3.2.	Verification of the List of Job Order Personnel submitted by Management and their corresponding service contracts revealed that 81 of the 154 Job Order personnel rendered continuous service for eleven months while the remaining 73 had services lasting up to a maximum of six months.  Details of these are shown in the Annexes “A” and “B”.



3.3.	Most of the said 81 job order workers had an initial contract of six months from January 1 – June 30, 2020. Consequently, they were rehired for the same position, functions and daily rates from July 1 – September 30, 2020.  Thus, resulting in a continuous rendition of job order services for nine months.



3.4.	The Director of the Human Resource Development Office admitted that the aforementioned JO personnel reported for work on the next day after their initial six-month service contracts expired.  Their service contracts were instantaneously approved upon submission of their clearances.



3.5.	She further explained that this has been the usual practice of the College since letters of intent were already submitted by the subject JOs and their respective Supervisors also endorsed the immediate need of their services.



3.6.	She also claimed that since two service contracts were executed for said JO workers during the nine-month period, there was no violation of six-month guideline.



3.7.	Her claim, however, is deemed inconsistent with the fact that there were 73 job order personnel who were hired pursuant to the maximum period prescribed in Section 1.a.2 of CSC Resolution No. 02-0790.



3.8.	The inconsistent application by Management of Section 1.a.2 of CSC Resolution No. 02-0790 may lead to adverse human resource issues since the College’s JO personnel constantly deal with each other on a daily basis and have common office colleagues.



3.9.	We recommended and Management agreed to consistently observe the prescribed maximum length of Job Order service contracts pursuant to Section 1.a.2 of CSC Resolution No. 02-0790 dated June 5, 2002.	

4. 	A cash advance for the purchase of supplies and materials for milk processing totaling ₱63,800.00 was not liquidated as at year-end even after the purpose for which it was drawn has been served, contrary to the provisions of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012. This resulted in the non-adjustment of the corresponding asset or expense accounts at year end.



4.1. 	COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 provides, among others, that, “A cash advance shall be reported and liquidated as soon as the purpose for which it was granted has been served. xxx All cash advances shall be fully liquidated at the end of each year.  Except for petty cash fund, the AO shall refund any unexpended balance to the Cashier/Collecting Officer who will issue the necessary official receipt.”



4.2. 	In line with the operation of its Baang Dairy Farm, the College through its Research and Development Unit decided to bottle the excess from its cattle milk production and initially sell this at the College Canteen, Bontoc Campus in May 2020.  In support of this venture, the Resource Generation and Linkages Unit then passed a proposed Working Capital Investment for Milk Processing amounting to ₱125,960.00 which was approved in June 9, 2020 with details shown below:

	4.3. 	Post-audit of DV No. 20-06-280 dated June 19, 2020 showed that a cash advance of ₱63,800.00 was granted to the Vice President for Resource Generation and Linkages for the purchase of item nos. 1-6 above.  The remaining items were acquired using the College’s Digital Heritage services.

	

	4.4.	Verification of the Status of Unliquidated Cash Advances as of December 31, 2020 revealed that said cash advance was not yet liquidated even if the milk production was already in full swing and collections had been recorded for the sales derived therefrom.  

	

	4.5.	The personnel in charge of the subsidiary ledgers for cash advances at the Accounting Services informed that up to the present, the said cash advance remains outstanding.  The Director for Accounting Services also admitted that no demand letter was issued relative to the liquidation of the same.



	4.6.	The non-liquidation of the cash advance, even after the purpose for which it was granted has been served, resulted in non-review of the transaction and its corresponding liquidation documents for the adjustment of the affected asset or expense accounts.



4.7.	We recommended and Management agreed to issue a demand letter to the accountable officer for the immediate liquidation of the ₱63,800.00 cash advance granted for the purchase of supplies and materials for milk processing and henceforth, strictly enforce the timely liquidation of cash advances granted for special purposes pursuant to COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012.



1)		Several provisions in the contract of lease for the commercial space for Water Refilling Station, Bontoc Campus were not enforced by Management and the lessee was allowed to continue occupying the said space even after the expiration of the initial lease contract which may have been contributory to the facility’s discontinued operation for almost three years.   

	

	5.1. 	Article 1315 of the Civil Code of the Philippines (RA No. 386) provides that, “Contracts are perfected by mere consent, and from that moment the parties are bound not only to the fulfillment of what has been expressly stipulated but also to all the consequences which, according to their nature, may be in keeping with good faith, usage and law.”

	

	5.2.	On September 3, 2013, the College entered into an initial Contract of Lease Agreement with a private individual for a commercial space in its Bontoc Campus intended as a water refilling station for income generating purposes.  The following were the terms and conditions agreed upon:

	

	“a. 	That the duration of the lease will be for a period of two (2) years effective October 1, 2013 to September 30, 2015 and that the monthly rental will be Five Thousand pesos (₱5,000.00) payable within the last five days of every month.  Said contract of lease may be renewed with the mutual consent of the parties hereof;

	b.   That the Lessee will use the said Space as a Water Refilling Station. That the Lessee will be responsible for her own electric bills;

	c.      That the Lessee does not have the right to sublease the same;

	d.    That the Lessor will be responsible for major repairs but minor repairs will be shouldered by the Lessee;

	e.  	The Lessor must be notified personally whenever major improvements within the leased premises will be undertaken by the Lessee.”

	

		5.3.   		As stated above, the initial term of the lease was only up to September 30, 2015. However, after its expiration, no request for renewal was made by the lessee and the College also did not offer the said commercial space for bidding to other interested parties. 

		

		5.4.		Verification of the summary of collections of the water refilling station revealed that rent was paid until February 27, 2018.  Thus, the monthly rate of ₱5,000.00 was applied by the College and availed of by the lessee from October 2015 to February 2018 with no legal basis since the initial lease contract already ended on September 30, 2015.

	5.5.    Moreover, perusal on the official receipts of rent payments showed that the name of the lessee in the official receipt was different from the name indicated on the contract of lease.  It indicated that the lessee per contract of lease was not the actual occupant of the commercial space,  hence, subleasing was probable.  Such situation is in violation of Item (c) of the contract and a ground for its termination. 

	

	5.6.	The Vice President for Resource Generation and Linkages (VPRGL) claimed that they had issued a notice of eviction to the tenant.  However, no copy of the said notice can be produced by Management.  

	

	5.7.	The VPRGL also informed that they included in their Strategic Plan for AY 2019-2020 a program to re-establish and sustain the water refilling station under its resource generation and linkage services for student immersion.

	

	5.8.	The lapses of Management in allowing the lease extension of the commercial space for water refilling station without a duly-approved contract of lease and its non-termination of the lease contract even with evidences of subleasing, may have contributed to the lessee’s non-operation for almost three years already.  

	

	5.9.	We recommended and Management agreed, henceforth, to strictly monitor the observance of the terms and conditions of its lease contracts and enforce termination of the same, if warranted.

	

2)		 	Accounts Receivables from commercial spaces amounting to ₱41,800.00 as of December 31, 2020, remained outstanding, thereby, depriving the College of additional funds for the operation of other IGP programs.

	

	6.1.	The GAM for NGAs, Volume III, prescribes, among others, that the Accounts Receivables account is used to recognize the amount due from customers from regular trade and business transactions.  This is then credited upon collection, transfer or write-off.

	

	6.2.	Review of the College’s Income Generating Projects’ Schedule of the Accounts Receivables as of December 31, 2020 showed that the following accounts are outstanding:

	TOTAL

	₱  41,800.00

	  

	6.3.	The Director for Production and Entrepreneurial Affairs claimed that a collection notice was issued to the lessee of the commercial space for Water Refilling Station, Bontoc Campus.  However, no payment was made despite its being long overdue.

	

	

	6.4.	The non-collection of accounts receivables due from the lease of commercial spaces resulted in the tying up of funds in the hands of the lessees instead of it being used by the College for its income generating programs.

	

	6.5.	As of February 28, 2021, accounts receivables from the lease of the commercial space for Loading Machine amounting to ₱1,800.00 and lease from the commercial space for Canteen, Tadian Campus amounting to ₱34,000.00 were collected.

	

	6.6.	We recommended and Management agreed to intensify its collection efforts to ensure that receivables from lease of commercial spaces due the College are promptly realized for use in its income generating programs. 

	

7.	The Program Leader of the MPSPC – Dairy and Rural Development Program at the Baang Dairy Farm performed collection functions without being designated as a Special Collecting Officer, and was not properly bonded, contrary to the provisions of Item 4.1 of Treasury Circular No. 02-2009; thus, exposing his collections to risk of loss and misuse.



	1)		The Research and Development Unit of the MPSPC started planting napier grass to determine the capacity consumption of carabaos at their Dairy Farm in Baang, Bauko, Mountain Province in 2014. This was under the care of the Program Leader and Assistant Professor II.   Due to the abundant supply of these fodders, a proposal to acquire cattle was submitted to the Philippine Carabao Center in 2015 and was approved in 2017.

	

	2)	In that same year, two carabaos were donated by the Philippine Carabao Center. To further jumpstart its Dairy Farm operations, four cows were procured from the Department of Agriculture – CAR on June, 2019.



	3)		 The College also purchased three heads of female cross breed buffalo for experimental research on dairy milk.  The milk produced by the cattle were used for food of the lactating buffalo and the calves. It was observed, however, that lactating bufallos and the calves could not consume all of the milk produced.

	

	4)	Hence, the excess milk was sold to customers as far as Bauko, Bontoc and Sagada municipalities. Due to this demand, the Director of the Research and Development Unit foresaw that the income derived from the milk production may be able to sustain the dairy farm expenses, including wages of workers.



	5)	Since there was no permanent employee assigned at the Baang Dairy Farm, the Program Leader was tasked to be in charge of the sales of the milk production which started in May 23, 2020.



7.6.	Item 4.1 of Treasury Circular No. 02-2009 provides that:



 “Public Officers Covered - Every officer, agent and employee of the Government of the Philippines or of the companies or corporations of which the majority of the stock is held by the National Government (NG), regardless of the status of their appointment shall, whenever the nature of the duties performed by such officer, agent or employee permits or requires the possession, custody or control of funds or properties for which he is accountable, be deemed a bondable officer and shall be bonded or bondable and his fidelity insured.” 



7.7. 	Verification of records at the Human Resources Office disclosed that the Program Leader had no official designation as Special Collecting Officer (SCO) to handle the collections from the operations of the Dairy Farm.



7.8.	Since the accountable officer had no designation as SCO, he had been performing collection functions without the requisite legal authority and was not able to avail of corresponding privileges entitled to an accountable officer.

 

	1)	Moreover, perusal of the Bond Confirmation Letters from the Bureau of Treasury, Mountain Province for accountable officers employed at the College, revealed that the Program Leader was not bonded.



	2)	As of December 31, 2020, total collections from milk sales reached an aggregate amount of ₱165,305.00 with details shown below:

	3)	As shown above, the Program Leader’s maximum cash accountability reached as high as ₱35,000.00 which is subject to a premium rate of ₱393.75 for a bond of ₱26,250.00 per Annex C of the same Treasury Circular.



	4)	Allowing the Program Leader to handle collections was in violation of Item 4.1 of Treasury Circular No. 02-2009. Further, absence of the collector’s fidelity bond may result in the non-replacement of loss of government funds in cases of defalcations, shortages and unrelieved losses, and non-payment of incidental fees and costs in cases of civil proceedings to recover sums paid on their accounts as stated in Item 4.8 of the said Circular.



7.13. 	We recommended and Management agreed to officially designate the Program Leader as a Special Collecting Officer for milk production at the Baang Dairy Farm to enable him to fully discharge his functions.

 

	1)	We recommended further and Management agreed to assign a personnel who is duly-bonded with the Bureau of Treasury to handle collections of milk sales at its Dairy Farm in Baang, Bauko, Mountain Province pursuant to Item 4.1 of Treasury Circular No. 02-2009.



1)	The college failed to properly set up records to provide a comprehensive financial report on the Dairy Milk operations at the Baang Dairy Farm contrary to Section 111(1) of PD 1445; hence, Management was unable to determine if it is deriving income from the said enterprise. 



	1)	Section 111(1) of PD 1445 sets the basic guidelines for the keeping of accounts by government agencies, which states that, “The accounts of an agency shall be kept in such detail as is necessary to meet the needs of the agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or control agencies of the government.”



	2)	As stated earlier, the Director for Research and Development Unit foresees that the income derived from the milk production may be able to sustain the dairy farm expenses, including wages of workers.



	3)	Review of the schedule of collections of milk sales prepared by the Accounting Office disclosed that the deposits made on such collections were not included; thereby, no cash balance is being reported.  Further, there was no report being prepared on the related expenses incurred in the operations of the Dairy Farm.



	4)		The College Accountant admitted that only the schedule of collections is being prepared by their Office upon receipt of the report of collections from the Cashier’s Office. 



	5)	Due to the incomplete reports, there is no comprehensive presentation on whether the dairy milk production is deriving income from its operations.



8.6.	Complete and detailed financial records as prescribed in the regulation mentioned earlier, are necessary for an updated monitoring and evaluation of the Baang Dairy Farm and will serve as a basis in making decisions and formulating policies.



8.7.	Likewise, Management will only be able to accurately determine the performance of the dairy milk operations, if a complete set of financial reports are regularly prepared.  Since the Resource Generation and Linkages Unit of the College is already preparing similar reports for the IGPs, the Research Department and Accounting Office may benchmark with them.



	1)	The absence of complete and detailed financial records, precluded Management from generating the Dairy Milk operation’s financial statements and comprehensively evaluating their performance.



	2)	We recommended and Management agreed to maintain complete financial records and prepare separate financial statement for the Baang Dairy Milk Operation to enable a comprehensive presentation of its financial status. 



1)	The College is selling dairy milk not registered with the Food and Drug Administration which may result in health hazards to customers.

  

	1)	Section 3.B.1 of Book II (Licensing of Establishments and Registration of Health Products) of Department Circular 2011-0101 of the Department of Health states that, “An approved application for a health product registration shall be issued a proper authorization or a corresponding Certificate of Product Registration (CPR).  An authorization or CPR covering a particular health product shall be prima facie evidence of the registrant’s marketing authority for said health product in connection with the activity/ies permitted pursuant to the License to Operate (LTO).  Only establishments with a valid LTO from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) may apply for certificate of product registration.”



	2)	Before an LTO is issued, one of the requirements is the establishment of a processing facility by the agency concerned.  In the case of dairy products, the processing facility usually consists of the pasteurization room where the said products are sterilized according to standards.



	3)	The Special Research Analyst revealed that they had already submitted to the Engineering Office a proposal for the improvement of the pasteurization room at the Baang Dairy Farm.  Scrutiny of the floor plan showed that spaces were provided for the required pasteurization area, as well as receiving, releasing and storage areas.  According to the College Engineer, the proposal was already approved. However, the fund from the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) for its implementation was not yet received by the College. 



	4)	As discussed in the preceding paragraphs, Management was already pasteurizing dairy milk at the Baang Dairy Farm and subsequently, selling the excess milk.  Nevertheless, since the pasteurization room had not yet undergone improvement, the College was unable to apply for a LTO. Hence, it was also precluded from seeking for a certificate of product registration for its dairy milk.



	5)	During the exit conference, the Vice President for Administration and Finance (VPAF) informed that they decided not to continue the improvement of the pasteurization room at the Baang Dairy Farm since the Research Development and Extension (RDE) department determined that the said project was not yet ripe to be of commercial operations.



	6)	The Director for Research and Development Unit admitted that there was no CPR for the College’s dairy milk but mentioned that it had undergone microbial testing for mastitis from the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) – CAR on June 19, 2020.  The result revealed that the milk produced in the particular sample submitted was safe to drink since no salmonella was detected.  This was their basis for continuing to market the dairy milk to interested patrons.



	7)		Moreover, the dairy milk was pasteurized before being sold and have a shelf life five days, when refrigerated.

	

	8)		It is noteworthy that the DOST-CAR gave a positive review of the dairy milk from the College’s Baang Dairy Farm.  However, a Certificate of Product Registration from the Food and Drug Administration is still the best proof that such dairy product is safe for the consumption of customers.

	

	9)	We recommended and Management agreed that upon compliance with requirements of the FDA, Management shall process the initial Certificate of Product Registration to ensure the safety of its dairy products. 



1)		 The fire and earthquake insurance for the College’s buildings and their contents were not renewed with the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) when they expired in July 2020; thus, exposing such assets to the risk of non-protection against damages or losses in cases of the said natural calamities.

	

	1)	Section 5 of Republic Act No. 656 otherwise known as an Act to Create and Establish a “Property Insurance Fund” and to Provide for its Administration and for other Purposes” provides among others that, “Every government, except a municipal government below first class, is hereby required to insure its properties, with the Fund against any insurable risk herein provided and pay the premiums thereon, which, however, shall not exceed the premiums charged by private insurance companies; x x x . . .”

  

	2)	Perusal of the fire/earthquake insurance quotation dated July 10, 2019 showed that the College paid ₱60,291.06 for its insurance coverage for buildings and its contents worth ₱64,862,406.73.   



	3)	Review of transactions for July to November, 2020 revealed that the College did not renew its fire/earthquake insurance with the GSIS.



	4)	As of December 31, 2020, the following were the comparative figures for the properties covered by the aforementioned expired fire/earthquake quotation:

	5)	The SPMO Director admitted that they were not able to renew the fire and earthquake insurance of the properties presented in the table due to the declaration of a national state of calamity earlier in 2020 which caused the restriction of travels outside the province. Hence, they overlooked the need to renew the said fire and earthquake insurance policy with the GSIS. Nevertheless, he promised that they will renew the insurance this CY 2021.



	6)	The non-renewal of fire and earthquake insurance policy deprived the College’s properties from protection against damages or losses in cases of the occurrence of the said natural calamities.  It also deprived the GSIS from collecting the commensurate premium payment for its General Insurance Fund (GIF).  



	7)	We recommended and Management agreed to renew the fire and earthquake insurance with the GSIS to ensure the protection of the College’s buildings and its contents from the occurrence of the said natural calamities pursuant to Section 5 of RA No. 656.



11. 	Insurance for ten motor vehicles of the College were contracted with private companies instead of the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS), in violation of Section 5 of RA 656 due to the non-conversion of the vehicles’ plates from private to government plates.



11.1. 	Verification of the Report on Insurance of Vehicles of the College prepared by the General Services Office (GSO) showed that of the 25 motor vehicles of the College, ten were insured with private companies in 2020 as shown below:

11.2.	The aforementioned vehicles were among those sourced out from the various infrastructure projects implemented by the College under the non-civil work items classified as “Engineering Facilities and Equipment.” Upon completion of the said projects, these motor vehicles were transferred to the agency through Deeds of Donation.  



11.3.	The College’s GSO explained that they already submitted to the Land Transportation Office (LTO), Mountain Province, the documents needed for the applications for government plate registration of these donated private vehicles.  However, upon follow-up with the officer-in-charge at the LTO Mountain Province, they were informed that such Office was still waiting for the required confirmations from their LTO counterparts at the localities where the said vehicles were previously registered.



11.4.	The said confirmations were needed to ensure that these motor vehicles were not involved in any unlawful/illegitimate undertakings before registration is transferred to the College.  LTO Mountain Province is waiting for confirmations from its colleagues in Nueva Ecija, Pangasinan, Benguet, La Union, Caloocan City, and Quezon City.



11.5.	The GSO further stated that since these vehicles still bore private plates, the College could not apply for insurance with the GSIS.  Hence, they had no other option but to avail of the insurance provided by private companies.



11.6.	The insurance by private companies for the ten motor vehicles of the college may not ensure the same adequate and reliable protection against damages or losses as provided by the Property Insurance Fund of the GSIS.  Moreover, this practice is contrary to Section 5 of Republic Act No. 656, as mentioned earlier.



11.7.	According to the GSO, as of February 18, 2021, three (3) out of the ten (10) vehicles were already granted temporary plates from the Land Transportation Office (LTO), while one (NCC 5686) was already in the name of the College and can be insured with GSIS in 2021.

11.8. 	We recommended and Management agreed to diligently follow-up with LTO Mountain Province the conversion of the private plates of its ten motor vehicles into government plates and subsequently insure the same with the GSIS. 



Gender and Development

1)		  A GAD Learning Hub and work area for female employees with special needs with a total budgeted cost of ₱1,770,850.00, were not established to the disadvantage of students, personnel and other clients of the College.

	

	1)	Review of the 2020 Annual Gender and Development Plan and Budget (GPB) disclosed that among the Gender and Development (GAD) Activities were the following:



GAD Activity

Establishment of GAD Learning Hub

One Learning Hub established

₱     695,850.00

Maintenance of a work area for female employees with special needs

Maintained and sustained work area for female employees with special needs

1,075,000.00

T O T A L

₱   1,770,850.00



	2)		According to the OIC Director and GAD Focal Person, the amount approved for the Learning Hub would be used to purchase GAD-related books and other materials of the same theme for the College Library.

	 

	3)	Validation of the GAD accomplishment report as of December 11, 2020, however, revealed that both of the said GAD facilities remained unestablished. 



	4)		The GAD Focal Person also explained that due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, most of the procurement for capital outlay items of the College were not accomplished, including the aforementioned projects.

	

	5)	The non-purchase of GAD-related books deprived the students and other clients of the College of references to enhance their knowledge on GAD issues and concerns.



	6)	In the case of the maintenance of a work area for female employees with special needs, the Focal Person admitted that this was for further study since the present employee profile did not show any female personnel who fit this category.



	7)	Therefore, there may be a need to revisit such plan to evaluate if it were still a gender concern for the College.





12.8.	We recommended and Management agreed to establish its Learning Hub at the College Library per approved GAD Plan and Budget and revisit its plan to maintain a work area for female employees with special needs since this may no longer be appropriate for the present employees.

Value-for-Money Audit

	18.   The fund transfer of ₱418,000.00 representing advance payment equivalent to 40% of the total amount approved for the Financial Literacy Program (FLP) partnership of the college with the Landbank Countryside Development Foundation, Inc. (LCDFI) remain unutilized as of December 28, 2020 to the detriment of target beneficiaries.

	

	1)	Section 1, Article I of the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) forged between the college and LCDFI on June 19, 2020 states that the Financial Literacy Program partnership aims to, “train farmers in the unbanked municipalities to become profitable and bankable.”  It further provides that such objective will specifically include the following:



--	Teaching the farmers practical and prudent methods of managing finances and income including savings and credit;

--	Helping them understand the value chain of their crops and its impact on their income;

--	Developing entrepreneurship among the said farmers; and

--	Impacting the importance of crop insurance in risk mitigation.



	2)		The identified target beneficiaries are 3,600 farmers in the Municipalities of Barlig and Natonin, Mountain Province and the timelines identified were third to fourth quarter of 2020 for the conduct of financial literacy training and other interventions and monitoring of training activities.  The program assessment and evaluation was pegged to be done in the first week of December 2020.

	 

	3)	As part of its extension services, the College President designated the former OIC-Chairperson of the Accountancy Department as Project Coordinator. 



	4)		However, review of the subsidiary ledger for Due to NGAs as of December 15, 2020 disclosed that the ₱418,000.00 fund transfer remained unutilized.

	

	5)	The project coordinator explained that they were not able to conduct the Financial Literacy Program which was scheduled from December 3-12, 2020, due to the strict implementation of the COVID 19 community quarantine in the Municipalities of Barlig and Natonin, Mountain Province where the target beneficiaries reside.



	6)	Moreover, the same lockdown procedures prevented the entry of all travelers from Bontoc, Mountain Province to the said Municipalities during the aforementioned period due to the increase in COVID 19 positive cases in the capital town.  Hence, they decided not to continue with the FLP.



	7)	The former OIC-Chairperson further revealed that they received a letter from the Program Head of the Financial Literacy Training Department of LCDFI informing that the last day of training for the FLP is on December 5, 2020 and that the last day of submission of partial/full liquidation of program fund is on December 15, 2020.



	8)	Pursuant to this, Management refunded the ₱418,000.00 to the LCFDI through check no. 753554 dated December 29, 2020.



	9)		Perusal of the same letter also revealed that, “all training partners with unused program funds are requested to return the program funds.”  Likewise, the LCDFI stated that, “…we would like to extend the program partnership to 2021…” 

	

	10)	The non-conduct of the Financial Literacy Program deprived the target farmer beneficiaries from learning about practical and prudent methods of managing their finances, understanding the value chain of their crops and its impact on their income and developing their entrepreneurial skills to make them more profitable and bankable.



18.11.	We recommended and Management agreed to coordinate with LCDFI for the continuity of the college’s provision of financial literacy services in 2021 to the farmer beneficiaries, pursuant to the extension granted for the program partnership between the two parties.



1)		A commercial space in the MPSPC Bontoc Campus intended as a water refilling station remained idle for almost three years already; thus, depriving the College of additional income and causing opportunity losses from non-utilization of government facilities.

		

	19.1.    Section 2 of P.D. 1445 states that, “It is the declared policy of the State that all resources of the government shall be managed, expended or utilized in accordance with law and regulations, and safeguarded against loss or wastage through illegal or improper disposition, with a view to ensuring efficiency, economy and effectiveness in the operations of government. The responsibility to take care that such policy is faithfully adhered to rests directly with the chief or head of the government agency concerned.”

	

	19.2.  	A commercial space in the MPSPC Bontoc Campus intended as a water refilling station for income generating purposes was initially leased to a private individual with a monthly rent of ₱5,000.00 on September 3, 2013. From October 2013 to December 2017, it earned an aggregate amount of ₱239,000.00 in rent income. However, in March 2018, it closed shop.  

	

	19.3.	Since then, Management did not offer the same space for rent to other interested individuals.  Neither was the space utilized for alternative income-generating projects; thus, defeating the purpose for which it was constructed.  

	

	19.4. 	Ocular inspection revealed that the facility remained idle up to the present. The non-utilization of the space may lead to its physical deterioration since no one maintained it after it was abandoned by the lessee.   Consequently, any plans to revive its operation will eventually lead to repairs and/or renovation entailing additional expenses on the part of Management. 

	

	19.5.	The prolonged idleness of the commercial space which is ideally situated for business operation also resulted in opportunity losses since the College was deprived of at least ₱150,000.00 in rent income.  This represents rent from March 2018 to October 2020 at the initial monthly rate of ₱5,000.00 agreed upon on September 2013, which was not realized since the water refilling station ceased to operate.

	

	19.6.	Inquiry made with the Vice President for Administration and Finance disclosed that the water refilling station was programmed for improvement/renovation in CY 2020.  However, due to insufficient funds, the project did not push through. Nonetheless, he assured that the project will push through once cash will be available. 	

	

	19.7.	The continued non-utilization of the subject commercial resulted in damages to the College’s facilities and will subsequently lead to additional expenses to make it operational again.  As such, Management failed to fully realize the income generating potentials of its water refilling station.

	

	19.8.	As of January 2021, Management had contracted the services of a contractor to perform repairs and maintenance on the door, windows and walls of the commercial space.

	

	19.9.  	We recommended and Management agreed to promptly utilize its commercial space at the Bontoc Campus originally intended as a water refilling station for income generation purposes to prevent further physical deterioration and opportunity losses.
