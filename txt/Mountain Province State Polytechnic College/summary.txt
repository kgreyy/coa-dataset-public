EXECUTIVE SUMMARY



A)	Introduction

	

The Mountain Province State Polytechnic College was created by virtue of Republic Act No. 7182 enacted on January 17, 1992, which converted the then Mountain Province College, a community college established in 1969 in Bontoc, Mountain Province, into a state college.  The College has three campuses: the main campus in Bontoc, offering the College of Arts and Sciences; the Tadian Campus, offering the College of Engineering and Technology and the College of Forestry; and the Paracelis Campus, offering the College of Agriculture.  The College also operates a research center in Ba-ang, Bauko, Mountain Province.



As of December 31, 2020, the College had a total personnel complement of 443 composed of 235 regular plantilla positions and 208 job order staff.  Of these personnel, 228 belong to the teaching while 215 were in the non-teaching.



Pursuant to COA Resolution No. 2011-009 dated October 20, 2011 the integrated results and risk based audit methodology has been adopted in the audit of the accounts and operations of the College for the period ended December 31, 2020.



The audit was aimed at verifying the level of assurance that may be placed on management’s assertions on the financial statements, ascertaining compliance with rules and regulations, checking the legality and propriety of the transactions and determining whether financial resources were managed economically, efficiently and effectively.

C)	Independent Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements 

	

			A qualified opinion was rendered on the fairness of presentation of the financial statements for CY 2020 since several of the Agency’s Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) accounts are not adequately supported by their respective Property, Plant and Equipment Ledger Cards (PPELCs) resulting in a variance of ₱12,982,717.38 when compared against the General Ledger balances.  This constitutes a departure from Section 42, Chapter 10 of Volume I of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs).  



D)	Summary of Significant Observations and Recommendations 

	

	1.		The Scale Model of a traditional Kankana-ey Village costing ₱895,000.00 for the IPED-based Research Center in MPSPC Tadian Campus was not accepted by the Inspection Team due to several deficiencies noted in its fabrication because of “rushed workmanship” as claimed by the project leader which resulted in the project’s non-completion within its target due date.

	

	We recommended and the project leader of the Enhancing the Engineering/Cultural Education through an IPED-based Research Center, as the end-user, agreed to coordinate with the supplier for the immediate rectification of the noted deficiencies in the Scale Model of a traditional Kankana-ey Village. 

	

	We further recommended and Management agreed to compel the supplier to promptly deliver the said scale model pursuant to the specifications in the Purchase Order and institute remedial measures against the erring entity, when deemed appropriate.

	

	2.		The cost of six landholdings of the College is not recorded in the books of accounts resulting in understatement of the land account by the commensurate value of the subject real properties.

	

	We recommended and the Director for Accounting Services agreed to record the 0.4206 hectare lot at Poblacion, Bontoc, Mountain Province where the Academic Building of MPSPC, Bontoc Campus is located, at its fair market value of ₱1,116,000.00 by debiting the land account. 

	

	We further recommended and Management agreed that for the other five landholdings, it shall promptly coordinate with the concerned government agencies and other stakeholders to expedite the release of the ownership documents and subsequently, record the corresponding fair market values of these properties in the College’s books of accounts.

	

	3. 	The fund transfer of ₱418,000.00 representing advance payment equivalent to 40% of the total amount approved for the Financial Literacy Program (FLP) partnership of the college with the Landbank Countryside Development Foundation, Inc. (LCDFI) remain unutilized as of December 28, 2020 to the detriment of target beneficiaries. 

		

		We recommended and Management agreed to coordinate with LCDFI for the continuity of the college’s provision of financial literacy services in 2021 to the farmer beneficiaries, pursuant to the extension granted for the program partnership between the two parties.

			

		4.	A commercial space in the MPSPC Bontoc Campus intended as a water refilling station remained idle for almost three years already; thus, depriving the College of additional income and causing opportunity losses from non-utilization of government facilities.

			

			We recommended and Management agreed to promptly utilize its commercial space at the Bontoc Campus originally intended as a water refilling station for  income generation purposes to prevent further physical deterioration and opportunity losses.

	

	5.		Eighty-one job order (JO) personnel rendered continuous service for a maximum of eleven months contrary to Section 1.a.2 of CSC Resolution No. 02-0790 dated June 5, 2002 while 73 other JO workers served for three to six months, rendering inconsistency in the application of the policies and guidelines regarding contracts of service of JOs that may lead to adverse human resource issues.

	

	We recommended that Management agreed to consistently observe the prescribed maximum length of Job Order service contracts pursuant to Section 1.a.2 of CSC Resolution No. 02-0790 dated June 5, 2002.

			

E)	Implementation of Prior Years’ Audit Recommendations



	Out of the 48 audit recommendations embodied in the CY 2019 Annual Audit Report, 26 were fully implemented, 9 were partially implemented, and 13 were not implemented.
