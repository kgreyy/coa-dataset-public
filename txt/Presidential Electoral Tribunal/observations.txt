OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS





FINANCIAL ISSUE



Dormant Receivables for more than 10 years



1)	Receivable accounts with year-end balances totaling P2,832.10 have been dormant or non-moving in the books of accounts for more than 10 years caused by lack of monitoring in the collection thereof thus,  leading to loss of fund in case of a write-off.



1)	COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016 defines Dormant Receivable Accounts as accounts which balances remained inactive or non-moving in the books of accounts for ten (10) years or more and where settlement/collectability could no longer be ascertained.  The same circular provides the guidelines, procedures and requirements on the write-off of dormant receivable accounts, unliquidated cash advances, and fund transfers to the National Government Agencies (NGAs), Local Government Units (LGUs), and Government-Owned and Controlled Corporations (GOCCs).



2)	As of December 31, 2020, Receivable accounts totaling P2,832.10 remain uncollected for more than 10 years as follows:

      Due from National Government Agencies (NGAs)

P  1,732.10

Due from Officers and Employees

Total

P  2,832.10





3)	The Due from NGAs account above pertains to the balance of undelivered goods procured from the Procurement Service – Department of Budget and Management (PS-DBM) which has been recorded in the books since CY 2003, while the Due from Officers and Employees account refers to the overpayment of salaries of Ms. Olivia de Leon Ponce which remain unrefunded despite demand letters sent on        February 1, 2013, November 7, 2013, and November 25, 2016.



4)	The foregoing Receivable accounts are therefore considered dormant due to lack of monitoring in the collection/refund thereof for more than 10 years.



5)	We recommended that Management require the Chief Accountant to consider the filing of the request for write-off of the dormant Receivable accounts in case the amounts can no longer be collected but subject to the requirements/conditions in COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016.
