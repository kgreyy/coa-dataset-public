C)	Scope and Objectives of Audit



	The audit was focused on the PET’s accounts and financial operations for CY 2020.  It was made through selective tests on the accounts in the financial statements and accordingly included other audit techniques and procedures deemed necessary under the circumstances.

	

         The objectives of the audit were:



1)	To express an opinion on whether the financial statements are fairly presented, in all material respects, in accordance with International  Public Sector Accounting Standards/International Financial Reporting Standards. 



2)	Communicate whether the internal control, particularly those affecting accounting and financial reporting systems, are operating effectively to provide reasonable assurance that misstatements, losses, or non-compliance would be reported in a timely basis.



3)	Communicate the results of tests of compliance with selected provisions of laws and regulations, including budgets and accountability issues, and details of audit suspensions, charges and disallowances identified during the audit.  

	



D)	Audit Methodology

The Audit Team conducted the audit in accordance with International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAIs) issued by the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI) to which the Commission is a member. Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement and comply with applicable laws and regulations. 

The Audit Team performed procedures to obtain audit evidence about amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depended on the auditor’s judgment, including assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements; whether due to fraud or error.  In making those risk assessments, the Audit Team limited internal control testing to those controls over financial reporting and compliance issues which we considered critical based on our experienced professional judgment.  



The procedures included internal control review; examination of documents/ records/ reports; analysis, confirmation and inspection of selected accounts, transactions and projects, as necessary.



The Audit Team communicated in writing any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses that come to our attention as a result of the audit. In addition, we communicated suggestions to improve agency operations and addressed control deficiencies identified during our audit. 



The Audit Team shall assess the agency’s financial management performance.  The results of such assessment shall be communicated to the Agency in a separate report. 



Although the audit was designed to provide reasonable assurance of detecting errors and irregularities that are material to the financial statements, it is not designed and cannot be relied upon to disclose all fraud, defalcations, or other irregularities. However, the Audit Team informed the Agency of any material errors, and all irregularities or illegal acts, unless these are clearly inconsequential, that come to their attention.





E)	Independent Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements



We rendered an unmodified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the PET’s financial statements for CY 2020. 



F)	Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations  



No significant audit observation was noted for CY 2020. 



The observation on the dormant Receivable accounts amounting to P2,832.10 was immaterial in amount and has no material effect on the fair presentation of the financial statements of the PET for CY 2020.  Nonetheless, such observation has been discussed with concerned officials and staff of the agency and their comments were incorporated in this report, where appropriate.





G)	Status of Audit Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges



There was no Notice of Disallowance, Suspension and Charge issued by the Audit Team as of December 31, 2020.





H)	Implementation of Prior Year’s Audit Recommendations



	One of the four audit recommendations embodied in the prior year’s Annual Audit Report (AAR) was implemented, while three were not implemented as of year-end.
