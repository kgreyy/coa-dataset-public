a)	Double recording of asset in Region 1 – ₱2,856,553.04



		i)	Analysis of Disaster Response and Rescue Equipment account under General Fund - Regular of the BFP Region 1 revealed that 58 units of fire nozzle received from the BFP National Headquarters (NHQ) amounting to ₱1,437,240.00 and two units of ambulance acquired through foreign grants totaling ₱1,419,313.04 were recorded twice in the books;  thus, overstating the account by ₱2,856,553.04 caused by over computation of Accumulated Depreciation and Depreciation Expense from the time of issuance to end-users up to December 31, 2020. According to the Regional Accountant, the two units of ambulance were recorded in 2019 and again included in JEV No. GF01-2020-06-058 dated June 30, 2020. Similarly, the 58 units of fire nozzles were included both in JEV No. 01-2020-06-058 and JEV No. 01-2020-12-137 both dated December 31, 2020.



b)	Unrecorded receivables from LGUs in CAR – ₱14,253,227.75



		i)	The BFP entered into a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with the Local Government Unit (LGU) of Baguio City on January 16, 2020 for the collection of Fire Safety Inspection (FSI) Fees pursuant to Republic Act No. 11032, otherwise known as the “Ease of Doing Business Act”. Under the MOA, the Agency deputized the LGU as its assessor and Collecting Agent for Fire Safety Inspection Fees in view of the implementation of the Ease of Doing Business Act. Based on the Certification issued by the City Treasurer, the LGU collected a total of ₱14,253,227.75 FSI Fees for CY 2020, broken down as follows:

		ii)	Verification of journal entries for the Other Service Income account under the Special Account - Locally Funded/Domestic Grants Fund revealed that the recorded income amounting to ₱14,253,227.75 pertains only to collections made by Collecting Officers of the Fire Stations. Thus, the above collections of the LGU were not yet recorded as of December 31, 2020 and considered as receivable by the Agency.



		iii)	Inspections were already conducted by BFP personnel and corresponding Fire Safety Inspection Certificates were issued by Baguio City Fire Stations for FSI Fees. It is therefore proper to recognize income from collections made by LGU on behalf of the Agency. Interview with Collecting Officer of Baguio City Fire Station disclosed that the above collections were not yet remitted to the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) as of December 31, 2020.  



c)	Lost Collections of Fire Code Fees in NCR– ₱129,242.67



		i)	Scrutiny of collections and remittances of BFP Manila City and inquiry from the Accounting Section of BFP – NCR disclosed that collections of fire code fees (i.e. Fire Safety Inspection Fees, Storage Clearance, etc.) from July 10, 2020 to July 16, 2020 amounting to ₱2,206,791.02 of a Collecting Agent were lost while in transit for deposit to the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) – Tayuman Branch, Manila on July 17, 2020.

		ii)	In the months of August to December 2020, the Collecting Agent notified the payors of checks for the immediate stoppage of payment and requested for replacement of lost checks which payors granted the request of the Collecting Agent; hence, restituted the lost checks in the amount of ₱2,077,548.35 leaving a balance of ₱129,242.67.



		iii)	The balance of undeposited collections as of December 31, 2020 of the Collecting Agent amounting to ₱129,242.67 was recorded in the books of accounts of BFP – NCR as Cash – Collecting Officers despite absence of cash in the possession of the concerned Collecting Agent resulting in the overstatement of Cash-Collecting Officers account by ₱129,242.67.



d)	Lost Properties/Assets in CAR-₱1,827,460.92



		i)	The submitted Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant, and Equipment (RPCPPE) of BFP - CAR for CY 2020 includes 21 missing properties totaling ₱1,827,460.92.

		ii)	In effect, the reported balance of PPE accounts as of December 31, 2020 is overstated by ₱1,827,460.92 while Loss of Assets is understated by ₱1,827,460.92. Of the 21 missing items, only nine portable fire pumps have request for relief from property accountability. The application for relief from property accountability of the 12 items were not yet submitted due to difficulty in securing supporting documents particularly the investigation report since these items were found missing in CYs 2016 and 2017.



e)	Unrecorded receipt of PPE in various Regions - ₱124,424,241.21



		i)	These refers to various PPEs such as Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus, computers, firefighter coats and trousers, communication equipment, and building of some BFP Regional Offices not recorded in the books of the Agency due to non-submission of complete supporting documents by Supply and Property Accountable Services to Accounting Service as basis in recording inventory and PPE.

		iii)	Verifications showed that the assigned BFP personnel already occupied the facilities right after the turnover ceremony, thereby, the above completed projects had satisfied the requirement on recognition and depreciation criteria set under IPSAS 17 at the date of turnover.  Reclassification of completed projects from Construction in Progress account to its proper PPE account should have been made and the corresponding Depreciation Expense should have been recognized.

j)	Unreverted Payable in CAR -  ₱410,000.00

		

		i)	Verification of BFP-CAR Accounts Payable Schedule revealed that a liability obligated in 2016 amounting to ₱410,000.00 remained outstanding as of December 31, 2020, or four years from its obligation. This pertains to repair of a Hino fire truck of the Tabuk City Fire Station which cannot be processed for payment because the claim was supported only with photocopies of the original documents. Efforts had been exhausted to gather original copy of documents, but no such file was found.  Absence of original documents to support the liability rendered the recorded payable invalid which necessitates reversion of the same to the Accumulated Surplus/Deficit. Moreover, administrative or judicial claim has not been filed by the payee since 2016 for the repair of fire truck.



k)	Error in recording (NHQ) - ₱1,135,110,354.50



		i)	BFP NHQ erroneously recognized Accounts Payable amounting to ₱1,134,982,025.31 despite absence of SARO for the acquisition of 76 Rosenbauer firetrucks (Phase 1) through loan availment from Unicredit Bank of Austria in CY 2013. This remains an audit observation for the last seven years.



l)	Error in recording of Trust Receipts – Regional Offices

 

		i)	Collections from sale of bid documents and receipt of guaranty/security deposits were remitted to the current account instead of the account of the BTr which resulted in erroneous recording of trust receipts in the books of concerned BFP Regional Offices.

Moreover, the BFP-NCR AS prepared JEV No. 2021-02-006 to correct the misstatement of Cash-Collecting Officers account amounting to ₱129,242.67.

d)	Lost Properties/ Assets



CAR

Ongoing compliance on the recommendations with concerned fire stations; the CAR Regional Office already issued Memorandum to concerned fire stations to apply for relief for relief from property accountability to derecognize lost properties.

e)	Unrecorded receipt of PPE



		 

NCR

Accounting Section is retrieving supporting documents from Supply and Property Accountable Section to recognize unrecorded PPEs in the book of accounts.



3

Accounting Section is still waiting for supporting documents (i.e. liquidation report from DPWH) to recognize unrecorded Building in the books of accounts.



5

Accounting Section stated that the recognition of seven Fire Trucks physically received by their office is under the direct instruction of the NHQ- Accounting.



BARMM

			Management acknowledged errors and improper treatment of certain accounts. The Regional Accountant was already instructed to prepare adjustment in accordance with the GAM for fair presentation of the financial statements. Major repairs and renovations made at Office of the Provincial Fire Director Maguindanao and Shariff Aguak Fire Station shall be properly capitalized. Reclassifying of cost of projects under Construction in Progress shall also be made only upon submission of Certificate of 100 percent Completion and Final Certificate of Acceptance with proper turn-over from contractors/suppliers hence adjustments will be made.

f)	Unrecorded issuances of Inventories

NCR

2

Management agreed to give their utmost attention and comply strictly with the recommendations. Further, the Regional Director instructed the Head of Logistics Division and Accounting Section to coordinate closely to settle the matter.



5

Accounting Section explained that, at the start of CY 2020, records of the Supply and Property Accountable Section and Accounting Section are reconciled. Further, adjusting entry of more than ₱13 million was also provided by the Accounting Section to recognize proper Accounting Rules (GAM).  Supply and Property Accountable Section also has a master list/record of all Semi- Expendable Supplies and Materials readily available for checking.  As to the noted discrepancies, these pertain to purchases and transfers from NHQ, which according to Supply and Property Accountable Section were already issued with Inventory Custodial Slip from NHQ while RHQ 5 Accounting Section   claimed that he did not receive the property transfer JEV from the Accounting NHQ; hence, records were not yet reconciled. 

g)	Non-recognition of Asset and Depreciation

9

Management agreed during the exit conference that they will comply with the audit recommendations.



The Regional Accounting Section corrected the misstatement and prepared adjusting entries under:  Regular Fund thru JEVs No. 21-01-006 and 21-01-007; and SAGF thru JEV No. 21-01-004 on January 2021 report.

Management also provided detailed justification for other concerns raised in this audit.

i)	Unrecorded adjustments in the Inter-Agency Fund Transfer 



NCR

Management commented that the amount of ₱24,495.10 from DBM-PS Delivery Receipt (DR) No. M19-000251-CSE was erroneously recorded twice by AS. An amount of ₱991,444.48 from the same DR was not recorded as delivery due to confusion by the Chief Accounting Section because the related approved Agency Procurement Request intended for purchase of Dot Matrix Printer was not yet paid during the time of delivery.



The double entry of ₱24,495.10 was corrected under JEV No. 2021-03-42. The amount of ₱991,444.48 was not recorded as Due from NGAs because it was already delivered instead recorded as Semi-expendable item. Moreover, the error in beginning balance is not yet adjusted. The error/reconciling item should be adjusted in the DBM-PS books. Management already requested and is waiting for corresponding ledger from DBM-PS to scrutinize other variances, make necessary adjustments in BFP-NCR records, if any, to arrive at reconciled and reliable balances.



In relation to fund transferred to PITC, BFP-NCR made an adjustment under JEV No. 2021-03-41 for the service fee and return of savings totaling ₱2,648,768.75.

2)	Two BFP Regional Offices are non-compliant with Section 11 of Rule IX of the Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (RIRR) of RA No. 11032 due to gaps and/or absence of Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) on the collection and remittance of Fire Safety Inspection Fees (FSIF) by Local Government Units (LGUs). Thereby, exposing to risk of loss, possible misapplication and utilization of collected income.  



	1)	The Revised Fire Code of the Philippines of 2008 (RA 9514) provides the sources of income of the Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP) as follows:



	a)	Fees to be charged for the issuance of certificates, permits and licenses as provided for in Section 7 of RA 9514;

	b)	One-tenth of one percent of the verified estimated value of buildings or structures to be erected from owner thereof but not to exceed P50,000.00, at least fifty percent to be paid prior to issuance of building permit and the balance after final inspection and prior to issuance of Cert. of Occupancy;

The Chief, BFP shall prescribe procedural rules for such purpose, subject to approval of the Secretary, DILG.



	4)	For utilization of Fire Code revenues, BFP shall prepare an annual program subject to approval of the DILG Secretary. Based on the approved program, DBM shall release to BFP the full amount remitted as certified by BTr thru issuance of Special Allotment Release Order (SARO) and Notice of Cash Allocation (NCA), or equivalent issuances. The 80 percent of all revenues collected by BFP shall be used for its modernization, subject to approval of the DILG Secretary, for the procurement and improvement of fire protection, fire investigation, rescue, and paramedics equipment, facilities, supplies and materials; related technical services necessary for BFP; and abatement of fire hazards. The remaining 20 percent shall be allocated by BFP to LGUs in accordance with the guidelines as set forth in a Memorandum Circular (MC) issued by the DILG Secretary or a Joint Circular (JC) with other concerned government agencies through issuance of funding checks. The 20 percent LGU share shall be appropriated exclusively for the use of the operation and maintenance of its local fire station, including but not limited to the construction and repair of the fire station.



	5)	To streamline procedures for issuance of local business licenses, clearances, permits, certifications or authorizations by LGUs, as well as issuance of Fire Safety Inspection Certificate (FSIC) by BFP and in congruence with RA 9514 and its RIRR, Section 11 of Rule IX of the IRR of RA No. 11032 or the Ease of Doing Business and Efficient Government Service Delivery Act of 2018 provided the following:



a)	For one-time assessment of business-related fees for Business Permit, LGUs may be designated to assess “the ordinary” Fire Safety Inspection Fees (FSIF), provided that BFP is able to check accuracy of computation and to certify tax order of payment.



b)	For one-time payment of business-related fees, BFP may allow designation of city or municipality as Collecting Agents for FSIF provided that remittance of said fee to BFP shall be made not later than two days after the transaction is made. BFP is not precluded from collecting additional fees required after their assessment, subject to existing laws and regulations.



c)	LGU and BFP thru Local Fire Marshal, may enter into a MOA giving authority to LGU Officers collection and automatic remittance of applicable fees.

	7)	Among the eight LGUs above, only Valenzuela and Marikina Cities have MOA with BFP NCR while the six LGUs collected FSIF without the required MOA deputizing the LGU’s collecting agent to collect the same. In addition, out of the remaining nine LGUs, two have MOA with BFP but reported no collection while seven LGUs neither entered an agreement with BFP-NCR nor collected FSIF during CY 2020. Collection of FSIF in these nine LGUs is being performed by the Collecting Agents of BFP-NCR City/Municipal Fire Stations.

 

	8)	Subsequently, after remittance of LGUs of collected FSIF to BFP-NCR designated Collecting Agents, the latter shall issue official receipt and deposit the same to BFP Special Account in the General Fund in BTr thru LBP.



	9)	Inquiry from the concerned officials of BFP-NCR and based on gathered data, it was noted that five BFP- NCR Fire Stations thru City Fire Marshals have entered into MOA or Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with LGUs giving authority to collect FSIF as required by RA 11032.

	10)	Examination of MOAs and MOUs revealed gaps in remittance of collected FSIF such as: (a) absence of clear provision on the percentage of collection to be remitted by LGUs to BFP -NCR; and (b) schedule or frequency of remittance of FSIF is not in accordance with period of remittance in RA 11032.  



LGU

Gaps in MOA/MOU

Valenzuela City

Non-inclusion or no clear provision on percentage of collection to be remitted by LGUs to BFP- NCR

Remittance of collected FSIF by LGUs to BFP-NCR is on a  weekly basis

Marikina City

Non-inclusion or no clear provision on percentage of collection to be remitted by LGUs to BFP- NCR

Remittance of collected FSIF by LGUs to BFP-NCR is on a monthly basis

Pasay City

Non-inclusion or no clear provision on percentage of collection to be remitted by LGUs to BFP-NCR

Quezon City

Non-inclusion or no clear provision on the percentage of collection to be remitted by LGUs to BFP-NCR

Navotas City

Possible risk of unrecorded or unrecognized income by BFP – NCR due to direct remittance by LGU to BFP depository account



a)	Non-inclusion or no clear provision on the percentage of collection to be remitted by LGUs to BFP-NCR



	11)	The basis of amount remitted by LGUs to BFP could not be ascertained due to absence of provision in the MOA/MOU on the percentage (100 percent or 80 percent) of collections to be remitted. Usually collected FSIF by LGUs were remitted to BFP through issuance of check by the former. However, the accuracy thereof could not be determined due to non-submission or late submission of report of collections. The same is true with regard to direct remittance of FSIF to BFP bank account where concerned LGU did not submit report of collection to support the amount deposited.  This set up may result in the double payment of 20 percent LGU share due to absence of information that the amount remitted represents 100 percent or 80 percent of the amount collected.



	12)	Review of the Monthly RCD of BFP-NCR disclosed that some LGUs only remits 80 percent of the collected FSIF, to wit:



LGUs

Pasig City



Taguig City



             

b)	 The schedule or frequency of remittance indicated is not in accordance with the prescribed two days period



	13)	Further verification of MOA and MOU disclosed that the schedule or frequency of remittance of FSIF by LGU of Valenzuela and Marikina City is on a weekly and monthly basis, respectively, instead of not later than two days after transaction is made, contrary to Section 11 of Rule IX of the IRR of RA No. 11032. Moreover, we also noted possible risk of unrecorded or unrecognized income by BFP-NCR due to direct remittance by LGU of Navotas City to BFP depository account; thus, may result to possible loss and omission of obligation.



	14)	In BFP RO 7, it was observed that remittances are always delayed by two to six months after collections by LGUs. Delayed remittances violated the two- day prescribed period of collection and untimely recording of transactions distorted agency’s income account.

	15)	Based on the foregoing discussions, we conclude that BFP-NCR and BFP-RO 7 are not compliant to Section 11 of Rule IX of the IRR of RA No. 11032 or the Ease of Doing Business and Efficient Government Service Delivery Act of 2018, due to:



a)	Absence of MOA between BFP-NCR thru City Fire Marshals and six LGUs of (i) Las Piñas City; (ii) Makati City; (iii) Parañaque City; (iv) Mandaluyong City; (v) Pasig City; and (vi) Taguig City despite reported collections and remittances of FSIF for CY 2020 by concerned LGUs to BFP- NCR, contrary to Paragraph c of Section 11 of Rule IX of the IRR; and 



b)	Agreement between BFP- NCR thru City Fire Marshall and LGUs of (i) Valenzuela and Marikina City provides the remittance of FSIF on a weekly and monthly basis respectively, instead of the minimum period of not later than two days after transaction is made, contrary to Par. b of Section 11 of Rule IX of the IRR.



c)	Likewise, BFP-RO 7 is non-compliant due to delayed remittance of FSIF by two to six months instead of the required period of not later than two days after the transaction is made which is not in conformity with Paragraph b of Section 11 of Rule IX of the IRR.



	16)	The non-compliance of BFP-NCR and BFP-RO 7 with Section 11 of Rule IX of the IRR of RA No. 11032 may pose risk on loss of income and possible misapplication and utilization of funds.



	17)	We recommended that Management:



a)	require the City/Municipal Fire Stations thru Fire Marshals to enter into MOA with concerned LGUs giving authority to assess and collect FSIF;



b)	require the concerned City/Municipal Fire Marshals to initiate the revision of MOA pertaining to the schedule or frequency of remittance of FSIF to BFP which is not later than two days after transaction is made; and



c)	for uniformity, include in existing MOA between LGUs and BFP clear provision on percentage of FSIF remittance by the former (LGUs) to the latter (BFP).



	18)	Management commented the following: 



BFP -NCR already complied with the first recommendation and that the MOA described by the recommendation is not a mandatory MOA as evidenced by the use of the word “may” in Section 12(h) of RA No. 11032 and Section 11 Rule IX of its IRR. Hence, in compliance with the recommendation and considering the cited pertinent provisions, BFP-NCR issued a memorandum with subject template for MOA between BFP and LGUs.



In relation to the second and third recommendations, Management directed the Fire Directors/Marshals of BFP-NCR to submit copy of their existing MOA and an After Activity Report/Comment in order to initiate necessary revisions. 



Management agreed and committed to comply with the above recommendation and to the provisions of Section 11 of Rule IX of the IRR of RA No. 11032.



BFP RO 7 immediately coordinated and notified the City Treasurer of Lapu-lapu LGU who reasoned out that the preparation of voucher for the remittance of FSIF will be made after the Office of the City Accountant completed the monthly Recapitulation of CRJ to make said remittances accurate since they are also collecting on behalf of other agencies aside from BFP. Further, all unremitted collections were already deposited in January 2021. Management will continue to coordinate and remind the City Treasurer on the monthly deposits of FSIF so that the same deficiency will not happen again in the future. There are personnel assigned in City Hall to check the accuracy of computation so that underpayments could be billed and collected.  



	19)	Auditor’s Rejoinder:



During Exit Conference, the Audit Team emphasized that the MOA stated in Section 11 of Rule IX of the IRR of RA No. 11032 is mandatory in deputizing LGUs as assessors and Collecting Agents of FSIF. Further, the assessment of Fire Code taxes, fees/charges and fines as revenue is vested upon the BFP as stated in RA 9514.  However, BFP may enter into agreement with LGUs allowing the latter to be deputized as assessors/collectors of FSIF.





Collection of Fire Code Fees (FCF)



3)	Accuracy and completeness of collections and remittances of Fire Code Fees (FCF) of BFP Regional Office Nos. 4B and 5 were doubtful due to:  a) delayed remittance of FCF by Collecting Agents to Authorized Government Depository Bank; b) inaccurate or unsupported Report of Collections and Deposits; and c) unvalidated and/or blurred deposit slips of remittances, contrary to the pertinent provisions of PD No. 1445 and GAM Volume 1.



	1)	Under RA 9514, the assessment of Fire Code taxes, fees, charges and fines as revenue is vested upon BFP and shall be undertaken by the Office of the City/ Municipal Fire Marshall having jurisdiction.



	2)	Likewise, Section 4 of DILG MC No. 2009-188 dated December 29, 2009 and Section 12.0.05 of the BFP Fire Code provides that the City/Municipal Fire Stations having jurisdiction shall collect through its COs and CAs the prescribed Code Revenues, and shall deposit same in an AGDB.



a) delayed remittances of collected FCF



	3)	Section 69 PD No. 1445 requires: Public officers authorized to receive and collect moneys arising from taxes, revenues, or receipts of any kind shall remit or deposit intact the full amounts so received and collected by them… The respective treasuries…shall in turn deposit with the proper government depository the full amount of the collections not later than the following banking day.



	4)	In BFP RO 4B, examination of deposits revealed that remittance of FCF to AGDB was delayed by one to 19 days in violation of the above cited provisions. 



	5)	In an inquiry, Management claimed that delays in deposit of collections were due to distance of  depository bank from the location of the fire stations especially those in separate islands. However, it was noted that, despite proximity from the bank of some fire stations  in Oriental Mindoro (Pinamalayan, Roxas, Calapan, Baco, Bansud, Bongabong, Gloria, Mansalay, Naujan, Pola, San Teodoro, Socorro and Victoria), Occidental Mindoro (Sablayan, San Jose, Abra de Ilog, Calintaan, Magsaysay, Paluan, Sta. Cruz), Marinduque (Boac, Buenavista, Gasan, Mogpog), Romblon (Odiongan, Romblon, Alcantara, Calatrava, Ferrol, Looc, San Andres, Sta. Fe), and Palawan (Puerto Princesa City, Brooke’s Point, Coron, Bataraza, SofronioEspaňola), which are less than 50 kms. away from nearest depository bank, there were still noted delays in their deposits. 



b) inaccurate, absence of and/or unsupported RCDs



	6)	Section 39 Chapter 5 of the GAM Vol 1 states that: a) At the close of the business day, the Collecting Officers shall prepare the Report of Collections and Deposits (RCD) (Appendix 26) for submission to Accounting Office/Unit. The report lists all the ORs issued in numerical sequence including cancelled ones; b) The RCD shall be supported by documentary evidence such as duplicate copies of ORs and validated deposit slips. 



	7)	Audit of collection of FCF in BFP ROs disclosed the following:

Results of Cash Examination (CE) of Cash Advances



4)	Deficiencies in handling, recording and disposition of cash advances of the designated Special Disbursing Officer and Petty Cash Custodian in NHQ and in Regional Offices were noted, such as: a) cash advances totaling ₱23,716,546.16 remained unliquidated as of year-end even if the purpose for which it was given has already been served; b) additional cash advances were granted even if previous ones were not yet liquidated resulting in overlapping of cash advances; c) cash transactions were not recorded daily in the prescribed Cash Disbursements Record; d) non-conduct of trainings/briefings/seminars to newly appointed Accountable Officers; e) non-reconciliation of Accountable Officers and Accounting Office’s records; f) expired fidelity bond of Accountable Officers; and g) no proper turnover of government funds and property from outgoing to incoming officers. These practices are contrary to the provisions of COA Cir. No. 97-002, Revised Cash Examination Manual and GAM Vol. 1.



	1)	Certain requirements in determining adequacy of internal control practices involving handling, recording and disposition of cash account were not complied by NHQ and various BFP Regional Offices, to wit:

BFP Regional Office





Management Comment

NHQ

--	Unliquidated Cash Advances -



In its letter dated March 25, 2021, Management commented that Advances to Officers and Employees and Advances to Special Disbursing Officers with balances of P601,600.00 and P1,347,559.75 had reduced and with remaining balance of ₱18,640.00 and ₱1,193,475.00, respectively. Moreover, cash advance balance pertaining to Fire Rescue Boat Training was affected by pandemic; thus, moved to a later date.  Demand Letter was issued to AO who failed to liquidate their cash advances.

Delay in the liquidation of cash advances was unintentional and inadvertent, and the setback exacerbated by health crisis.  At the height of the lockdown, BFP-NHQ workforce was severely abated with imposed restrictions in human movement, suppression of public transport, deployment of BFP-NHQ personnel to field offices, and spread of Covid 19 infection in BFP-NHQ and in local communities.  With the limited personnel, the AO worked mostly unaided.



--	Additional cash advances were granted even if previous ones were not yet liquidated -

Subject AO is not only the SDO/PCC of the Directorate for Logistics but also, the Chief, Motor Vehicle Section.  Several cash advances were requested by his office on honest and sincere desire to comply with LTO registration and pay the TPL and Comprehensive Insurance on time of all BFP-NHQ service vehicles and fire trucks nationwide amidst Covid 19 pandemic.  The AO assures adherence to COA’s recommendation.



--	Cash transactions were not recorded daily in the prescribed CDRec -

The AO regrettably acknowledge his failure in preparing his daily CDR being a new SDO/PCC.  AO assures to adhere to COA’s recommendation.



--	Appropriate training/briefing/seminars were not provided to designated AO as SDO and PCC



Management will adhere to COA’s recommendations pertaining to grant, utilization, liquidation of cash advances as well as records maintenance.



NHQ commits to adhere to audit recommendations and strictly comply with Section 75 and 77 of PD 1445 to establish proper accountability and enhance internal control.



4A

Management commented during Exit Conference that Advances to Special Disbursing Officer account amounting to P364,000.00 and Advances to Officers and Employees amounting to P54,000.00 at year-end were already liquidated and adjusted in the books in CY 2021 under JEV Nos. 2021-02-0035 and 2021-02-0036, respectively, both dated February 28, 2021. Management also agreed to call the attention and send demand letter to the AO of Perez Fire Station in Quezon Province to settle immediately his cash accountability amounting to P3,000.00.  

6

Management commented that PCC was already informed of policies involving utilization of PCF during mentoring sessions.  Memoranda were issued reminding PCC to replenish the Fund as soon as disbursement has reached 75 percent.  Delays in replenishment were due to factors such as transfer of PCC, lacking documents, corrections after review and pandemic. Provincial Fire Marshalls were also advised to closely monitor frequency of replenishment by operating units within their AOR.



12

Management recognized the importance of establishing proper accountability and strengthening internal control to protect not only collection of government funds but also their cash advances. In effect, cash advances of Cotabato City Fire Station were directed to have separate sets of ORs for issuance and prepare separate RCDs.



Management agreed to the audit recommendation and promised strict observance of procedures in issuing accountable forms. For CY 2021, Management implemented a uniform policy in the distribution of ORs to easily monitor accountability and strengthen its commitment to having an effective internal control to provide reasonable assurance in financial reporting.



Management strongly agrees on establishing proper accountability and strengthening internal control to protect not only collection of government funds but also the Collecting Agent. In effect, through issuance of a memorandum, all Fire Marshals are reminded of the guidelines on assignment and designation of Collecting Agents and to strictly observe proper turnover of government funds and property from outgoing to incoming Collecting Agent.



CAR

Reassignment of AO shall be under the control of the Regional Director. Though Turnover and Acceptance Form was already prepared, it shall be revised to include serial numbers and quantity of accountable forms being turned over. This policy shall also be discussed during the ongoing orientation with the Provincial and Municipal Finance Officers. 



It was also committed that a system wherein Turnover and Acceptance Form and the Property Transfer Report shall be mandatory attachments to the No Money and Property Accountability Clearance.



BARMM



Management humbly recognized lapses indicated in the audit observation. Per COA recommendations, a memorandum shall be downloaded to the respective Provincial Fire Directors reiterating if not establishing proper protocol to be observed with regard to the transfers of AOs giving emphasis on the conduct of a mandatory cash examination as part of their relief from accountability with respect to the designation that the City/Municipal Fire Marshal or SDOs shall vacate.  Appropriate and timely notice shall be provided to regional office. 





Non-remittance of trust receipts to BTr



5)	Collections from sale of bid documents and receipt of guaranty/security deposits of nine BFP-Regional Offices were deposited to the local currency current account instead of the account of the Bureau of the Treasury contrary to Section 6 of the General Provisions of RA No. 11465 or the GAA for FY 2020. 



	1)	Section 6 of the General Provisions of RA No. 11465 states that the following shall be deposited with the National Treasury and recorded as TR in accordance with E.O. No. 338, s.1996, as implemented by COA-DBM-DOF J.C. No. 1-97 dated January 2, 1997, and such other guidelines issued thereon:

Any excess in amount collected shall be remitted by NGAs to the BTr.



	3)	Moreover, performance bonds and deposits filed or posted by private persons or entities with department, bureaus, offices, and instrumentalities of the NG, including Constitutional Offices enjoying fiscal autonomy and SUCs shall be deposited with the National Treasury and recorded as trust receipts. 



	4)	The Cash in Bank - Local Currency Current Account disclosed a balance of ₱7,457,902.85 as at year-end which is maintained solely for the proceeds from sale of bid documents and guaranty/security deposits arising from receipt of cash or cash equivalents to guaranty that the winning bidder shall enter into contract with the procuring entity; and performance by the contractor of the terms of the contract.



	5)	Analysis disclosed that collections from sale of bid documents and receipt of guaranty/security deposits were collected by BFP ROs thru Collecting Officer and were subsequently deposited to the local currency current account instead of the account of the BTr as required by the abovementioned provisions.

Management Comment

1

Management replied that they will review the Trust Fund Account to identify and classify underlying issues such as if there are still unpaid honoraria, unidentified deposit and unclaimed refundable warranty securities from previous years that were included in the amount and effect necessary adjustment before remitting it to BTr.

2

Aside from deposits of proceeds from sale of bid documents and Guaranty/Security deposits, Region 2 also maintains the account for financial assistance from LGUs.  Financial assistance from Provincial Office of Cagayan is recorded as Assistance from LGUs and being reimbursed by Office of the Provincial Fire Marshall Cagayan for implementation of various plans and programs with the province.  Thus, the Regional Accounting Office requests for time to liquidate the remaining balance of financial assistance so as to comply with recommendations and remit the balance of Cash in Bank -LCCA.

Management justified that BFP-NCR has been in its practice of disbursing payments of honoraria of BAC members and refunds of guaranty/warranty deposits payable directly against the Cash in Bank -LCCA since the opening of said account dated December 7, 2011. 



Moreover, BFP-NCR already remitted the cash balance to the BTr and was able to close the said LBP account. JEV No. 2021-01-003 was made by Accounting Section to record closure of Cash in Bank – LCCA.





Inter-Agency Receivables – Unliquidated Fund Transfers (FTs)



6)	Funds transferred to PS-DBM and PITC totaling ₱4,137,007,323.39 for procurement of supplies, materials, equipment and infrastructure projects remained outstanding for several years due to failure of said agencies to deliver the items procured. Thus, depriving the agency of its immediate use which are crucial in the operation of the agency.

	6)	BFP could have maximized the utilization of funds had they procured much needed firefighters trucks, equipment, supplies, gears and even construction of fire stations from eligible and qualified suppliers thru BFP Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) instead of transferring funds to PS-DBM and PITC without certainty of  period of delivery thus, making the funds idle in the custody of these two government agencies and depriving BFP of immediate use of items which are crucial in the agency’s operation.  



	7)	Furthermore, due to continuous increase in prices and fast evolution of technology the purchasing power of funds transferred may weaken and consequently force reduction in quantity of items to be procured.



	8)	We recommended that Management:



a)	make a strong representation with PS-DBM and PITC for the immediate delivery of all long outstanding balances of fund transfers, otherwise, demand the refund of unutilized fund transfers; and



b)	make use of or utilize the BFP-NHQ’s BAC in procurement of firefighting equipment, trucks, gears and construction of fire stations.



	9)	Management commented that they are in constant coordination with PS-DBM and PITC for procurement projects on which fund transfers were made. Relative to the recommendation that the Agency will demand immediate refund of fund balances, Management expressed that instead of refund, they be allowed to continue the projects because it will entail additional time for Management to again get hold of the fund or secure new fund for subsequent procurement. Moreover, the project forwarded to the two agencies are in the process of procurement.



As of March 2021, the balances of outstanding fund transfers of NHQ under RAF amounted to P747,996,998.32 and P936,669,285.90, respectively, while balances under SAGF, TF, Region 3 and NCR remained the same as of March 2021.









Gaps in the implementation of Repairs and Maintenance of PPEs



7)	Gaps in the implementation of repairs and maintenance of fire stations, buildings and fire trucks in BFP Regional Offices were noted such as:  a) abandonment by the contractor of the repair/improvement of fire station; b) late release of funds by BFP-NHQ intended for completion of repairs and maintenance of fire trucks; and c) inappropriate approval and non-submission of documentary requirements on request for work suspension and extension of time, contrary to the pertinent provisions of RA 9184 and GAM Vol. 1.



	1)	Sec. 24 Chapter 10 PPE of GAM Vol. 1 provides that repair and maintenance primarily maintain or improve functionality and capacity of PPE; increase its service life; improve the quality of its output; or reduce operating cost. 



	2)	Section 2 of PD 1445 requires that all resources of the government shall be managed, expended or utilized in accordance with law and regulations, and safeguarded against loss or wastage through illegal or improper disposition with a view to ensuring efficiency, economy and effectiveness in operations of government. 



	3)	Sections 10. 2 and 10.4 under Annex E, Paragraph 10 of the IRR of the Government Procurement Act (RA 9184), state that: 



a) No extension of contract time shall be granted the contractor due to (a) ordinary unfavorable weather conditions and (b) inexcusable failure or negligence of contractor to provide the required equipment, supplies or materials”. (Underscore supplied), and;



b) No extension of contract time shall be granted when the reason given to support the request for extension was already considered in the determination of the original contract time during the conduct of detailed engineering and in the preparation of the contract documents as agreed upon by the parties before contract perfection. (Underscore supplied)



	4)	Annexes A to H of COA Circular No. 2009-01 dated February 12, 2009 enumerate the required documents to support request for suspension of works before granting or approving extension of contract time, such as, but not limited to the following:

a)	Copy of the approved Change Order (C.O./Extra Work Order (EWO);



b)	Copy of the agency's report establishing the necessity/justification(s) for the need of such CO and/or EWO which shall include (a) the computation as to the quantities of the additional works involved per item indicating the specific stations where such works are needed, (b) the date of inspection conducted and the results of such inspection, and (c) a detailed estimate of the unit cost of such items of work for new unit costs, including those expressed in volume/area/lump sum/ lot;

c)	Copy of the approved detailed breakdown of contract cost for the variation order;



d)	Copy of the approved Time Extension;



e)	Copy of contractor's/consultant's request for Time Extension;



f)	Copy of Evaluation Report by the agency concerned establishing the need for time extension including the computation showing in sufficient detail how the number of days of extension was determined;



g)	Certification or reports establishing the existence of the grounds for the contract time extension; and



h)	Copy of the approved revised PERT/CPM Network Diagram ref1ecting the effect of the subject time extension on the original contract time and all previously issued Time Extensions, Suspension/Resumption Orders, and variation Orders (for infrastructure projects), if any.



	5)	DILG MC No. 2016-003 directed BFP to adopt its new vision of a modern fire service fully-capable of ensuring a fire-safe nation by 2034 and its new mission to prevent and suppress destructive fires, investigate its causes, enforce fire code and other related laws, and respond to man-made and natural disasters and other emergencies.



	6)	For CY 2020, BFP entered into contract agreement with various suppliers/contractors for the repair and maintenance of BFP’s assets. Details are as follows:



Region

Observation

Reason

	NCR

Buildings and Other Structure- Fire Station

Repair/improvement of the Pateros Fire Station (PFS) with a total contract price of ₱4,870,451.11 was abandoned by the contractor; thus, exposing the uncompleted structure to further deterioration and eventually condemnation leading to wastage of government resources. 

The contract for repair/improvement of PFS was abandoned by the contractor due to lack of manpower.  However, this should have been taken into consideration during post-qualification of technical and financial requirements to avoid such predicament.

CAR

Motor Vehicles -Fire Trucks

Incomplete history of repairs was noted in PPPE Ledger Cards maintained by Accounting Section resulting in unreliable information in determining the reasonableness of proposed repairs by Management.



3

Motor Vehicles -Fire Trucks

Timely implementation and completion of the repairs of fire trucks was not attained due to late releases of funds from the BFP-NHQ to BFP-Region III

Repairs of fire trucks for CY 2019, started on Dec. 6, 2019 and completed on Feb. 4, 2020 while for CY 2020 repairs of fire trucks started on Dec. 10, 2020 and will be completed on March 12, 2021.  No reason was given for late releases of funds from NHQ to RO 3



















4A

Motor Vehicle – Fire Trucks

Reasons for request for extension of contract time for completion of various repairs of fire trucks with contract amount of P1,647,388.40 do not fall under the provisions of Annex E, Paragraph 10 of the IRR of the RA 9184. 

Completion of works was requested for time extension of additional 38 to 45 days due to unavailability of spare parts. These requests were approved by the former Regional Director; however, approval of extension of contract time should be limited under Annex E, Par. 10 of the IRR of RA 9184.



Buildings and Other Structures –Fire Stations and Various Buildings

Management was not able to submit necessary documents to support request for suspension of works by the contractor and approved extension of contract time for construction and/or repairs and maintenance of buildings and fire stations for  15 projects with total contract cost of ₱22,189,054.99, as required under Annexes A to H of COA Circular No. 2009-01 dated February 12, 2009



Required documents to support request of suspension of works and approved extension of contract time as enumerated in Annexes A and H of COA Cir. No. 2009-01 dated Feb. 12, 2009, if any, were not submitted or attached to DVs as part of the documentary requirements before payment to the contractor.



	7)	 We recommended that Management:



	a)	for NCR, require the Logistics Division to facilitate blacklisting of CDJ Builders and Construction Supplies for abandonment of construction project in Pateros Fire Station, in accordance with GPPB Uniform Guidelines for blacklisting of manufacturers, suppliers, distributors, contractors and consultants; 



	b)	for CAR, instruct the Accounting Section to:



		i)	consolidate and update the ledger cards by recording all major and minor repairs conducted in CY 2019 and prior years;



		ii)	record in the ledger cards all repairs conducted for the year even if not yet paid; and



		iii)	furnish a copy of updated ledger cards the Fire Stations for reference in succeeding repair transactions.



	c)	for RO 3, make a representation with BFP-NHQ for the early release of funds to hasten implementation of projects considering the necessity of fully operational firetrucks in the performance and delivery of services being the mandate of the agency; and



	d)	for RO 4A, require the Chief, Logistics Division to strictly observe provisions of Annex A to E, Par. 10 of the IRR of RA 9184 and A to H of COA Cir. No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009 in recommending approval of request for extension of contract time by contractors and submission of required documents on specific transactions, otherwise, impose appropriate liquidated damages against erring contractors for unreasonable delays under existing or awarded contracts

Unregistered Motor Vehicles with LTO and incurrence of Penalties/Surcharges 



8)	Seven BFP Regional Offices failed to initially register or renew registration of 421 fire trucks and other vehicles with the Land Transportation Office for CY 2020, contrary to Section 5 Article 1, Chapter II of RA No. 4136 or the Land Transportation and Traffic Code. This resulted in incurrence of penalty and other unnecessary expenses amounting to ₱75,522.06 upon renewal inconsistent with COA Circular No. 2012-003.



	1)	Section 3, Chapter 2, GAM Vol. I  on  responsibility, accountability and liability over government funds and property states: it is the declared  policy of the State that all resources of the government are managed or utilized in accordance with laws and regulations and that the same are safeguarded against loss to ensure the efficient, effective  and economical  operations of government.  It  is also provided  that the head of Agency is immediately and primarily responsible  for all government funds and property  pertaining to his agency. 



	2)	Section 5, Article 1, Chapter II of RA No. 4136 or the Land Transportation and Traffic Code provides, among others, the following:



	a)	No motor vehicle shall be used or operated on or upon any public highway of the Philippines unless the same is properly registered for the current year in accordance with the provisions of this Act.



	b)	Any registration of motor vehicles not renewed on or before the date fixed for different classification, as provided hereunder shall become delinquent and invalid.



	3)	Unnecessary expenditures, as defined under Item 4.1 of COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012, pertain to expenditures which could not pass prudence or diligence of a good father of a family thereby, denoting non-responsiveness to exigencies of the service.  This also include incurrence of expenditures not dictated by demands of good government and expenditure that is not essential or that which can be dispensed with without loss or damage to property.



	4)	Review and verification of PPE accounts revealed the status of registration of various motor vehicles including fire trucks of the agency.

	5)	Based on the above data, one of the reasons why these fire trucks, such as Jiangte, Anos Kia Ceres Mini, Isuzu Patriot Anos, Isuzu Water Tender, and Dongfeng, have remained unregistered is due to lack of documents upon transfer and/or turn-over of the assets by BFP NHQ to Regional Offices.



	6)	For several years, documents required by LTO in the registration of motor vehicle remained unavailable to various BFP offices; thus, ownership of these assets is uncertain.

Audit of Inter-Agency Payables



9)	The balance of the account Due to NGAs totaling ₱5,125,901.73 representing inter-agency fund transfers from two national government agencies remained unliquidated and unutilized as of December 31, 2020, contrary to COA Cir. No. 94-013. Moreover, non-utilization of funds intended for major programs related to the agency mandate reflects inefficiency in its operational functions and non-delivery of planned results.   



	1)	BFP, attached agency of DILG is responsible for implementing national policies related to firefighting and fire prevention as well as implementation of the New Fire Code of the Philippines (RA 9514). The Bureau now is in charge of management, administration, and implementation of fire and emergency services all over the country.



	2)	The Department of Energy (DOE), recognizing expertise of the BFP and its complementary role in implementing the program, transferred funds amounting to ₱2,000,000.00 to BFP in 2015 to:



a)	develop a manual on emergency response protocol and basic and enhanced knowledge and skills in firefighting techniques involving public vehicles fuels by alternative fuels;



b)	develop training module on emergency response protocol and firefighting techniques for alternative fuel program TWG members/trainors;

c)	provide training on emergency safety measures for TWG members; and 

d)	conduct simulation training on emergency response and firefighting techniques involving alternative fuel vehicles.



	3)	Also, BFP as one of responders to the National 911 Program received another inter-agency fund transfer from DILG last 2017 amounting to ₱50 million. MOA between DILG and BFP requires that BFP shall deliver the following outputs:



a)	Conduct of Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) training for BFP-EMS personnel; 

b)	Program and develop and information database of 911 emergency responders on a GIS (Geographic Information System) platform;

c)	Develop and provide hosting service for emergency information database; 

d)	Develop call & case analytics as required by National 911 program set-up;

e)	Facilitate and undertake the network leasing for the National 911 Program; 

f)	Organize and mobilize a Technical Experts Group to provide over-all technical guidance to the project; and 

g)	Submit to DILG monthly/quarterly/annual progress report and liquidation report in accordance with existing accounting and auditing rules and regulations.



	4)	Likewise, BFP received funds from DILG on December 10, 2019 amounting to ₱2.3 million which will be used for the roll-out campaign of ease of doing business for BFP Officers, Marshalls and Personnel Nationwide.  



	5)	COA Cir. No. 94-013, prescribes the rules and regulations in the grant, utilization and liquidation of funds transferred to IAs. Section 6 requires that IA should:



i)	within ten (10) days after receipt from the AO, the Accountant shall verify the Reports, provide accounting entries, record and submit the duplicate copies of the Reports with all the originals of vouchers/payrolls and all supporting documents to the IA Auditor.  The Accountant shall ensure that only expenses for the project are included in the Reports.  He shall submit the original copy of the Reports to the SA



ii)	record the disallowance in audit after receipt of the CSB and the CN issued by the IA Auditor and require the settlement of any suspension and disallowance;



iii)	return to the SA any unused balance and refund of disallowance upon completion of the project.



	6)	Remaining balances of funds transferred to BFP as of December 31, 2020 are summarized as follows:

The balance remained idle for five years up to this date.  It can be recalled that DOE has been requesting for liquidation or refund of the fund in its letter dated December 6, 2016 but to date, the same has not yet been acted upon, no liquidation or refund was made to DOE.  The unexpended balance should be remitted back to the Source Agency (SA) to settle fund transfer, considering the number of years for which the fund was not utilized.



	8)	On the other hand, ₱951,544.90 or two percent of fund received from DILG remains unexpended for the purpose it was transferred. Review of disbursements under this program showed that fund transferred was used for the conduct of training of BFP-EMS.



	9)	For funds intended for the roll-out campaign of Ease of Doing Business Law for BFP Officers, Marshalls and Personnel Nationwide, the same has not yet been utilized to date. 



	10)	Ageing of funds received showed that the total unutilized balance amounting to ₱5,125,901.73 as of December 31, 2020 has been outstanding from one to more than two years. Details are shown below.

	11)	Although the MOA between DILG and BFP does not provide a definite time frame for project to be executed, non-utilization of funds deprives the firefighters and the public of much-needed improvement in emergency response protocol and safety measures as well as necessary developmental training for National 911 Program and roll out campaign for ease of doing business for BFP personnel.



	12)	The slow utilization of funds resulted to delayed implementation of projects and accumulation of unutilized fund balances.



	13)	This is a reiteration of prior years’ audit observation in view of Management’s failure to take action. 



	14)	We recommended that Management:



a)	require the responsible office to closely monitor implementation and utilization of funds received from source agencies;



b)	 require the Accounting Service to submit to the Audit Team latest report of disbursements to DOE and DILG showing current status/balances of the inter-agency transferred funds; and



c)	immediately refund to DOE the balance of P1,874,356.83 which remained unutilized since 2017.



	15)	Management commented that as of March 2021, fund amounting to P2,300,000.00 pertaining to DILG Project Name:  Roll-out Campaign of Ease of Doing Business Law has been returned to said agency.





Audit of COVID 19 Funds and related expenses



10)	The propriety of disbursements amounting to ₱605,824,714.08 made by BFP in response to COVID 19 pandemic is doubtful due to: a) lacking supporting documents and deficiencies noted in the transactions amounting to ₱88,880,198.73; b) difference between the cost of procured goods against the price ceiling set by DOH pursuant to Department Memoranda Nos. 2020-0058-B and 2020-0131; and c) grant of Meal Allowance to BFP personnel amounting to ₱41,001,099.31 inconsistent with existing regulations.



	1)	Corona Virus Disease (COVID 19) is an infectious disease caused by a new strain of corona virus where outbreak began in Wuhan, China.  World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID 19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020. 



	2)	Seeing the lives of Filipino people which shall be endangered Congress, in response to the call of times passed the bill entitled “Bayanihan to Heal as One Act” or RA No. 11469.  The Act granted the President to carry out effective national policy in stopping spread of COVID 19.  It enabled all government agencies to discontinue some projects and reallocate portion of their appropriations in respond to the crisis.  



	3)	DBM allotted and released billions of pesos for COVID 19 related expenses to various government agencies and LGUs sourced from CY 2019 and 2020 national budgets.



	4)	DBM issued Special Allotment Release Order (SARO) to BFP amounting to ₱3,545,000.00 as aid in the Agency’s response against Covid 19.

	5)	Due to reported transmission of Covid-19, community quarantine was imposed and was strictly implemented in NCR and all parts of Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao but as more cases of community transmissions were recorded, the entire country was placed in the expanded quarantine.

b)	Difference of price of medical supplies, tools and equipment from the price set by DOH 



	12)	On March 9, 2020, the GPPB issued Res. No. 03-2020 on Adoption of Efficient, Effective and Expedient Procurement Procedures during State of Public Health Emergency, simplifying rules in the Negotiated Procurement under Emergency Cases modality.



	13)	This was then followed by issuance of Joint MC No. 1 of COA and GPPB on March 26, 2020 allowing Negotiated Procurement (Emergency Cases) under Section 53(b) of RA No. 9184, Section 53.2 of its 2016 IRR and associated issuances for the procurement of Goods, Infrastructure Projects and Consulting Services that are directly related to mitigation and containment of transmission of COVID-19 for Procuring Entities to properly and timely respond to Public Health Emergency.



	14)	Despite relaxation of procurement procedures, DOH was mandated to monitor and regulate drug price as well as ensure consumers adequately protected against profiteering, hoarding, cartels and the like that compromise public access to essential pharmaceutical products. 



	15)	Shown below are BFP-NHQ’s procurement of various personal protective equipment and other supplies and materials to combat Covid 19 found to be relatively high contrary to price ceiling set by DOH.

	16)	With regard to procurement of Cover All Hazmat, DOH Dept. Memo No. 0144 dated March 30, 2020 was then amended by Dept. Memo No. 0144-A dated April 14,2020 increasing price ceiling of cover-all gown (hazmat) to ₱1,200.00 per unit. However, the contract between BFP-NHQ and supplier Stone of David was perfected last April 7, 2020 and was delivered April 13, 2020; hence not yet covered by the amended Dept. Memo. Thus, contract should have followed existing price freeze as of March 30, 2020.



	17)	Meanwhile, it was noted that there is difference of safety goggles and thermal scanner prices against the price ceiling set by DOH Dept. Memo No. 2020-0058-B and Dept. Memo No. 2020-0131 regarding Price Freeze of Essential Emergency Medicines due to 2019 NCOV Health Event



	18)	The Office of the President directed all government agencies, offices and instrumentalities, as well as LGUs to implement and ensure compliance with issuances of DOH and Department of Agriculture (DA) on prices of essential emergency medicines and supplies and selected agriculture and fishery commodities through MC No. 77 last March 17, 2020. Hence, existing price control should have been strictly implemented.



c)	Inconsistent grant of Meal Allowance



	19)	BFP NHQ issued an Unnumbered Memo dated March 24, 2020 with addendum/clarification dated April 3, 2020 signed by Dir. Jose Segundo Embang, Jr., Chief, BFP regarding authority to utilize MOOE allotments for meals requirements of BFP personnel dedicated on COVID-19 response. It authorizes provision of an amount not exceeding ₱500.00 (breakfast, lunch and dinner) per day per personnel actually performing COVID-19 related tasks. It also specifically provides that meal allowance must be provided in kind (actual food) and not in cash on the notion that they cannot leave their posts to personally buy or secure their food as provided in paragraph 3 of the addendum/clarification dated April 3, 2020. 



	20)	Section 3.9.15, Chapter 3 of the Manual on Position Classification and Compensation System (PCCS) of the Phil. Govt. established under RA No. 6758 or Compensation and Position Classification Act of 1989 states that Subsistence Allowance is allowance for meal or sustenance of government personnel who, by the nature of their duties and responsibilities, have to make their services available in their places of work even during mealtimes.



	21)	It was noted during examination of paid expenses submitted by various BFP ROs that ₱41,001,099.31 was used to pay for meals of BFP personnel assigned in various locations.

	22)	Currently, BFP personnel are given Subsistence Allowance (SA) of ₱4,500.00 per month or ₱150.00 per day for the purpose stated in Section 3.9.15, Chapter 3 of the Manual on PCCS. Payment of said allowance would render the grant of meals to BFP personnel as double payment since they have the same nature and purpose.



	23)	Moreover, it was disclosed that meals paid by BFP Region 4B amounting to ₱1,836,000.00 was paid through reimbursement as evidenced by Payrolls instead of providing actual food (in kind) as prescribed by the internal guidelines issued by the BFP. 



	24)	We recommended that Management:



a)	instruct the Regional Directors to require concerned and responsible offices to submit the specific and original copies of lacking documents and submit explanation on deficiencies noted on certain transactions and refrain from processing claims not adequately supported with valid documents;



b)	submit justification for procurement of PPEs with relatively higher than the price ceiling set by DOH pursuant to Dept. Memo No. 2020-0144; No. 2020-0058-B and No. 2020-0131; and



c)	submit justification on grant of meals to BFP personnel despite receipt of Subsistence Allowance and grant of meal allowances in cash instead of in kind in BFP RO 4B.

	Comments

	NHQ

	Submission of Summary/List of Donations Received, Distributed and Balances for donations in-kind received, Management submitted required report, however, it was found to be not properly accomplished, thus, Audit Team (AT) requested for its resubmission.  Acting Chief, Logistics Support Service submitted the corrected report.

	NCR

	Resolved the observations while justifications pertaining to Covid issues of NCR have been submitted to the Audit Team.

	5

Management is enjoined to submit the required documents per said matrix to avoid suspension of the transaction. 

	6

Management commented that requested deployment plan and duty details are being collated and checked by FMD personnel to determine actual dates of duties of personnel.  As soon as all documents are complete, the same will be submitted to Audit Team immediately.

	7

	Management will retrieve all required documents to support payments of meal allowances for personnel who performed COVID19-related tasks.

	

	Auditor’s Rejoinder:

	

	The guideline is very specific that only those assigned in the choke/checkpoint areas can avail meal allowance/provision. Those who are performing other COVID19 related tasks but can leave their post are not included. 

	11

	During Exit Conference, the Chief of Supply and Property Accountable Service commented that dates encoded or reported were typographical errors and gave assurance to look into the completeness of supporting documents in all procurement transactions.

	

	b)		Difference of price of medical supplies, tools and equipment from the price set by DOH 

	

	BFP NHQ commented that:  

	

i)		Management is in good faith and with due regard to procurement laws.  Procurement was immediate and necessary under the circumstances, to protect BFP personnel in the performance of their mandated task thus, negating luxury of time to look for supplier who offered lower price since there are only few suppliers.  Even this time, when PPE supplies are overflowing and suppliers are already readily available, price of Cover All Suit is still much higher than the price set forth under Dept. Memo No. 2020-0144 dated March 30, 2020.

	

ii)		At the time of procurement of said PPE and other medical devices, it is common knowledge that supplies were scarce as the whole world was scrambling to get hold of them in order to curtail the spread of the virus.  To make the matter worse, suppliers of PPE are limited due to movement restrictions brought by community quarantine and if there are any, same is committed to DOH as they prioritize the latter, since hospitals were overwhelmed by Covid patient and runs out of PPE.  Contract price for eye goggles and thermal scanners was the prevailing prices at the time of its procurement due to shortage as those were in-demand commodities.  Considering that BFP is in need of it to be used in control points, it has no choice but to buy at such price, otherwise it cannot effectively discharge its mandated task.

	

	c)		Inconsistent grant of Meal Allowance amounting ₱41,001,099.31.

	

	Region

	Comments

	NCR

Management justified that grant of meals is grounded on necessity for health safety purposes. BFP granted meals to IATF members for them to mainly focus on their assigned task in their dispatched area to keep them active while on post. This is also a way of BFP to show and express esprit de corps among BFP frontliners to keep them physically, mentally, emotionally, and psychologically fit and able to perform their daily task.



During Exit Conference, Management emphasized that BFP – NCR, thru the directive of BFP-NHQ took initiative to give meals (in kind) to their personnel as it was very difficult time caused by Covid-19. BFP-NCR personnel were not able to buy their meals because of their assigned task in the control points of NCR moreover, businesses engaged in food within the location of each control points are closed.

	4B

Management explained that meal allowances were paid in cash instead of in kind due to the following: (1) availability and usefulness of BFP personnel to prepare in kind food will be impractical in local fire station setting; (2) considering shifting hours and geographical location of check point deployments, no catering or food service providers were readily accessible and resources were also limited; and (3) to give personnel preference to provide for their own meal anywhere. In any time of day, allowing convenience and practicality but without compromising and leaving their duty post. Further, Management commented that they will adhere with the recommendation that all succeeding disbursements of the same kind conform to guidelines set for the purpose.

Audit of SEAGAMES expenses



11)	Daily Travel Expenses (DTE) totaling ₱8,929,500.00 paid to 1,183 BFP-NCR personnel during deployment in the 30th Southeast Asian Games (SEAGAMES) deviates from maximum allowable DTE rates prescribed under Section 6 of EO No. 77 dated March 15, 2019.



	1)	Government agencies and instrumentalities, including GOCCs and LGUs are encouraged and directed thru MC No. 56 dated January 25, 2019 to extend their support to the Philippine SEA Games Organizational Committee Foundation Inc. in the preparation, organization and holding of the 30th SEAGAMES.



	2)	In response thereto, Chief BFP issued Bureau Order SO-2019-632 dated November 15, 2019 directing BFP officers and personnel to participate as contingents of the BFP Task Force to the 30th SEAGAMES on November 15, 2019 to December 14, 2019. BFP officers and personnel were deployed to various venue in NCR and where events/games such as billiards, basketball, volleyball, bowling and etc., including hotels and/or places of accommodation of athletes and delegates coming from Southeast Asian countries.



	3)	As a support to BFP-NCR contingents, Management granted meal allowance totaling ₱8,929,500.00 thru payment of DTE by Special Disbursing Officer at a rate of ₱500.00 per day each contingent. 



	4)	DTE is the amount authorized to cover expenses for local travel, consisting of: (i) costs for hotel accommodation or lodging, including prescribed taxes and service charges; (ii) meals; and (iii) incidental expenses, including cost for local or inland transportation and reasonable miscellaneous expenses at the place of assignment.



	5)	Maximum allowable DTE of government personnel, regardless of rank and position as prescribed by EO No. 77 shall be at the following rates:



	Destination

	Regions VI, VII, X, XI and CAR

	₱1,800.00

	Cluster III

	Regions IV-A, IV-B, NCR

	₱2,200.00



	6)	Section 6(a) (Travel Within the 50-Kilometer Radius from the Permanent Official Station) of EO No. 77 dated March 15, 2019 states that personnel on official travel who commute daily from place of assignment to place of residence or permanent official station shall be allowed the following expenses:



i)	Actual fare at prevailing rates of authorized modes of transportation from permanent official station to place of assignment and back;



ii)	Meals in an amount not exceeding the 30 percent of authorized meal component of DTE as indicated in Section 5 hereof. (Emphasis supplied)

	

	7)	Examination of Liquidation Report (LR) No. 2020-01-002 and 2020-01-003 with supporting documents disclosed that BFP-NCR personnel were granted meal allowance thru payment of DTE for their deployment within NCR, of which the travel distance is within 50-kilometer radius. 



	8)	Further examination revealed that the rate of ₱500.00 for DTE paid to each contingent exceeded the allowed rate of ₱198.00 prescribed in Section 6 of EO 77.  Hence, paid DTE totaling ₱8,929,500.00 exceeded by ₱5,393,418.00. Computation is shown below:

	9)	Scrutiny of supporting documents of LR Nos. 2020-01-002 and 2020-01-003 showed that 1,183 BFP-NCR personnel deployed within NCR on 16 November 2019 to 14 December 2019, rendered one to 24 days of duty as contingents in the 30th SEAGAMES. Recipients acknowledged receipt of paid DTE of ₱500.00/day thru various payrolls. See Annex C for details.

	

	10)	It is declared policy of the State that all resources of the government shall be managed, expended or utilized in accordance with law and regulations and safeguarded against loss or wastage through illegal or improper disposition, with a view to ensuring efficiency, economy and effectiveness in the operations of government. 



	11)	The payment of DTE to BFP -NCR personnel by more than the allowable rate pursuant to EO 77 resulted in overpayment of ₱5,393,418.00.



	12)	We recommended that Management submit explanation on why excess payment of DTE amounting to ₱5,393,418.00 should be allowed in audit; otherwise, require the refund of excess payment from concerned BFP-NCR personnel.



	13)	Management commented that the meal allowance as provided in Section 6(b)(ii) does not apply to SEAGAMES deployment for the reason that officers and personnel did not commute daily from place of assignment to place of residence or permanent official station; hence, DTE under Section 5(b) not exceeding the rates provided therein, may be authorized. Further, the BFP-NCR personnel rendered 24/7-hour duty as evidenced by itinerary of travel and attendance sheet in liquidation reports.



	14)	Auditors Rejoinder:



The grant of Daily Travel Expenses within the 50 kilometer radius from the permanent official station under Section 6(a) of EO 77, as invoked by the Management, requires the personnel concerned to stay in the place of assignment and should not commute daily from the place of assignment to the place of residence or permanent official station and back. Section 6(a) of EO 77 presupposes that stay in hotel/lodge is implied, and should be substantiated by hotel bill or invoice to prove that the personnel stayed in the place of assignment for the whole duration of the deployment. 



Notwithstanding that concerned BFP-NCR personnel did not claim the amount for hotel/lodging expense, the hotel bills or invoices should be attached in the liquidation report of the accountable officer as required by Section 6(a) of EO 77 to prove their stay in the venue for the whole duration of their deployment, despite the submission of Itinerary of Travel.



Examination of liquidation reports disclosed that the concerned BFP-NCR personnel did not stay in any hotel/lodge for the whole duration of deployment nor evidence/s (such as hotel bill/invoices) was submitted to substantiate the stay of the personnel in their assignment. Thus, Section 6(b) of EO 77 as indicated above, should be used as basis in the grant of meal allowance.

Gaps in the implementation of Infrastructure Projects



12)	Various BFP infrastructure projects implemented by BFP-NHQ and BFP Regional Office Nos. 4B, 5, and 6 totaling to ₱160,221,177.29 were unsatisfactorily executed due to gaps and/or deficiencies in the project implementation and departure from the provisions of RA No. 9184. 



	1)	It is the declared policy of the State that all resources of the government shall be managed, expended or utilized in accordance with laws, rules and regulations, and safeguarded against loss or wastage through illegal or improper disposition, with a view of ensuring efficiency, economy and effectiveness in the operations of government.  The responsibility to take care that policy is faithfully adhered to rest directly with the head of the government agency concerned.



	2)	RA No. 9184 shall be applied to the Procurement of Infrastructure Projects, Goods and Consulting Services regardless of source of funds whether local or foreign by all branches and instrumentalities of government, its departments, offices and agencies, including GOCCs and LGUs, subject to the provisions of Commonwealth Act No. 138. Any treaty or international or executive agreement affecting the subject matter of this Act to which the Philippine government is signatory shall be observed.



	3)	Validation and evaluation of BFP infrastructure projects amounting to ₱160,221,177.29, we noted gaps and deficiencies that cause its unsatisfactory execution such as inoperable or not fully functional Digital Radio System, implementation of construction of fire stations even without the necessary building permit, 10 percent retention money project was not withheld, and delayed completion of the project, among others (Annex D for details).



	4)	We recommended that Management: 



a)	For BFP-NHQ, require the contractor of radio system to look into the installation of Digital Radio System (DRS) especially in far flung areas and re-installation or repair to be able to sustain the project and achieve effectiveness of the Bureau’s operations in their quick response during disasters and emergencies;

														

b)	 For RO 4B and RO 6 – 



i)	ensure that contract extension shall be granted only on conditions provided under Annex E of the 2016 Revised IRR of RA 9184;

ii)	strictly and properly check capability of contractors prior to award of contract to ensure full compliance to stipulations in the contract; and

iii)	instruct the Regional Accountant to compute for liquidated damages on contracts with delayed implementation;



c)	For RO 5 –



i)	require the Contractors to submit Building Permits and Fire Safety Evaluation Clearances (FSEC), in compliance with the provisions of National Building Code and Fire Code of the Philippines;

ii)	ensure that contracts submitted to COA are supported with complete documentation pursuant to COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 24, 2012 and provisions of DOLE; and

iii)	direct the Accounting Unit to determine unrecouped amount and require Contractor to secure required irrevocable stand by letter of credit covering unrecouped amount. Henceforth, ensure submission by the Contractor of an irrevocable stand by letter of credit of equivalent value as advance payment to be made as required by the law on procurement.



	5)	Management submitted the following comments:

													

													Region

													Management Comment

													NHQ/11

	Management commented that they are going to look into actual status of radio communication equipment. As to functionality and other technical concern, they contacted Railworks Corporation and forwarded their request to the Main Office and also to BFP NHQ in Quezon City for reconfiguration but up to now they are still waiting for their reply.

													4B

													Management concurred with all recommendations. As such, Management already disapproved the latest request for extension of some contractors due to lack of merit. Also, liquidated damages were already imposed to contractor for the delay in the construction of El Nido Fire Station as evidenced by OR No. 3389987 dated December 3, 2020 amounting to ₱8,781.15.

													5

Management assured the Audit Team that all construction projects are compliant with various rules and regulations on government construction projects and that the building permit shall be submitted upon final inspection/payment.   It justified that it has been a long-standing industry practice that contractors automatically start construction and incur no delay and within date of contract implementation. In said regard, they shall incur little to no liquidated damages.  However, they are willing to pay penalties insofar as the Building Code is concerned to their respective LGUs.   Nevertheless, the said contractors are already notified by Management to expeditiously apply and update application for building permit. Finally, Management assured the Audit Team that final payment shall not be released unless all documentary requirements including building and occupancy permits are submitted.

													

													

On construction of Aroroy Fire Station



Management stated that subject documents were inadvertently excluded from the file for submission to COA.  It further stated that said documents are on file with the BAC Secretariat and shall be submitted immediately.  Henceforth, it will observe the timelines and ensure completeness of the supporting documents of the contracts submitted.



On construction of Del Gallego, Cam Sur Fire Station



Management explained that BAC Secretariat failed to include in the Contract copies of Notice of Disqualification on the eligibility status of the Bidder, Motion for Reconsideration filed by Contractor duly received by Management and Construction Safety and Health Program duly approved by DOLE.  Subject documents shall be submitted immediately.  As to Certificate of Acceptance, Management stated that in the Certificate of Completion submitted as support to its SLCC, it showed owner’s acceptance since it takes custody of the completed project.



Auditor’s Rejoinder



Certificate of completion is undated and not approved by the District Engineer of DPWH Masbate III Engineering Office, San Fernando, Masbate and that “Since the Contractor has satisfactorily complied with requirements of QAU Team, this Certificate of Completion is hereby issued.  This warranty Period commences from date of completion.” It further provides obligations of Contractor during the one year Defects Liability Period.  It did not mention of possession of owner of the project that could be equated as Certificate of Acceptance.



On Viga Fire Station



Management stated that the Construction Health and Safety Programs duly approved by DOLE and CARI were inadvertently omitted by BAC Secretariat.  It will submit subject documents immediately.  As to the Certificate of Acceptance, Management explained that they believed that the Certificate of Completion and Turn-Over for Custody of DPWH Projects was substantial compliance with the said requirement.  It was only during Exit Conference that Management was enlightened on the appropriate document.  Henceforth, submission of certificate of acceptance in support to SLCC shall strictly be observed in the subsequent projects.



Auditor’s rejoinder:



As provided under said DPWH DO, Certificate of Acceptance is issued after one-year defects liability period, after all defects and failures, if any, shall be repaired by the Contractor to the satisfaction of the same Inspectorate Team and upon submission of Warranty Certificate by the Contractor in accordance with the provisions of Sections 62.2.3.3 and 62.2.3.4. after liability defects period.  Thus, the Certificate of Completion and Turn-Over for Custody of DPWH Projects is not substantial compliance with the Certificate of Acceptance.

													

On construction of Fire Stations in the Municipalities of Ragay and Pasacao, Camarines Sur



Management explained during Exit Conference that the BAC Secretariat was not able to attach subject documents to contracts submitted.  It shall submit the documents immediately.

													

On advance payment of 15 percent of contract cost for infrastructure projects of 3 municipalities



Management agreed to comply with recommendation and the requirement of providing a surety bond for the 15 percent mobilization and promises that all other future contractors who shall claim mobilization be required with the submission of such.



													6

BFP-6 BAC and TWG are properly observing post-qualification procedure to those contractors declared as the Lowest Calculated Bidder (LCB).  Some LCBs were post-disqualified in recently concluded bidding for various construction of Fire Stations;



Imposition of Liquidated Damages is strictly observed by the Regional Accountant to erring contactor at a rate stipulated by law; and



All delayed projects will be closely monitored to ensure continuous progress and all ongoing projects are closely supervised by Projects Engineers. 



													7

													Management will coordinate with the Lessor and ask for any other way that Management’s request be granted and would not also be a burden to the Lessor. Management will also exhaust all possible ways to renew Contract of Lease on time and make sure that this will not happen again. Further, Accounting Section will prepare journal entry to recognize guarantee deposits. 

													

													Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

													

													Only those damages caused by fortuitous event and not those minor repairs being pointed out by the in-charge during the Exit Conference.

													

													

													

													

Information System Strategic Plan (ISSP) Phase II



13)	The objective of Information System Strategic Plan to automate interior processes of integrated system in either web-based or using Global System for mobile communication integration intranet accessible to both BFP personnel and the public was not fully achieved on its sixth year of implementation despite its high utilization rate of funds for the purpose which could be attributed to: a) partial completion of  ISSP Phase I with budget allocation of ₱206,686,233.68 already transferred to PITC and PS-DBM; b) undelivered information and Communication Technology (ICT) Equipment for Phase II valued at ₱54,765,176.09; c) failure to conduct trainings in 2019 to 2020 as programmed; and d) lax monitoring of ICT projects.

	6)	On the other hand, the Fire Command and Control Operation System Projects targets to:

 

a)	Establish and integrated and optimized operational efficiency that shall ensure expeditious response to fire and related medical and rescue emergencies;

b)	Build up database Management of BFP assets and relevant information;

c)	Establish linkages with other law enforcement and emergency disaster responder agencies and medical facilities;

d)	Establish Incident Command System Protocol; and

e)	Establish Command Center Mobile Command Post including equipage of all deployable BFP units



	7)	These projects were expected to deliver the following results by the end of 2020:

5)	Trainings





	8)	To date, the Fire Code Revenue System was already developed and undergoing pilot testing in Muntinlupa City Fire Station (NCR), Batangas City Fire Station (Region 4A) and Legazpi City Fire Station (Region 5). Further, Digital Radio System is being established and will be functional in Regions 4A and 11. However, despite these accomplishments, ICT projects are already delayed from its original implementation schedule and is far from being completed.  This can be attributed to the following reasons:



a)	Partial completion of ISSP Phase I – ₱206,686,233.68

b)	Undelivered ICT Equipment for Phase II 

c)	Failure to conduct trainings in 2019 to 2020 as programmed

d)	Lax monitoring of the ICT Projects



a)	Partial completion of ISSP Phase I – ₱206,686,233.68



	9)	As of October 31, 2020, various trainings were already conducted for end-users of ICT systems to keep them abreast with latest technology and ICT specialization trends. However, most of the much-needed ICT equipment from PITC and DBM-PS remain undelivered and uninstalled to wit:

	10)	Due to undelivered items by PITC and DBM PS, laptops, desktops and tablets already procured by BFP are not being fully utilized for its intended purpose. Prolonged non-use or utilization of these equipment for other purposes may not be favorable for this project as said ICT Equipment are already depreciating while the system is not yet fully operational.



	11)	Non-delivery by PITC of ICT equipment for Phase I has been a recurring observation embodied in CAAR for CYs 2017, 2018 and 2019 and recently reiterated in this report. 



b)	Undelivered ICT Equipment for Phase II - ₱54,765,176.09



	12)	By the end of CY 2020, all equipment and software should have been fully delivered and installed in NHQ and in priority regions as planned, while pilot trainings should have been conducted. In the evaluation of ISSP vis-à-vis plans and targets, we noted that although funds were almost fully utilized (with high financial delivery rate), the project was not fully implemented (with low physical delivery rate). As per Registry of Allotments, Obligations and Disbursements Capital Outlay (RAODCO) as of March 31 2020, 98.29 percent of funds have been obligated to wit:

	16)	Using the information above, it can be inferred that only 25.20 percent (₱2,298,500.00/₱9,120,000.00) of programmed activities for two years were implemented. To date, the Registry of Allotments, Obligations and Disbursements for Maintenance and Other Operating Expense (RAODMOOE) was not submitted to this Office to verify utilization of funds allocated for training expenses of ISSP Phase II from CYs 2018 to 2020.



d)	Lax monitoring of the ICT Projects



	17)	During the course of audit, it was revealed that Management does not maintain consolidated database of status of development for ISSP Project both Phase I and II. Information is difficult to extract from records of ICT and Logistics Division as well as from the Budget, Accounting and Logistics Support Services.



	18)	Starting from the Budget Services, differentiating one project from the other is easily identifiable for project evaluation purposes. However, to facilitate and expedite procurement process, items for ISSP Projects are being merged to regular items for procurement. Hence, delivery, distribution and recording of items procured for ISSP Projects are also being merged to regular items for distribution and recording



	19)	Inquiry with Directorate for Information and Communication Technology Management personnel also revealed that they are having a hard time in monitoring the project as records from Phase I and II are being mixed up. 





	20)	We recommended that Management:



a)	make a strong representation with PITC and PS DBM for immediate delivery of long overdue equipment and software to be able to complete the IMSP Project since component ICT equipment procured for the purpose are already depreciating while the system is not yet fully operational; 



b)	closely monitor delivery of Railworks Corporation for the Supply, Delivery, Installation, Testing and Commissioning of Digital Radio System for BFP Region 10 as it should already be delivered per work order;



c)	submit explanation as to why trainings are not conducted despite availability of funds; and 



d)	strictly monitor implementation of ISSP Project Phase II through close coordination with Directorate for Information and Communication Technology Management, Logistics, Budget, Accounting and Logistic Support Service, and prioritize procurement of communication network and ICT software and systems vital to implementation of the projects before procurement of depreciable assets to avoid wastage of government funds.



	21)	Management commented that procurement amounting to ₱9,212,00.00 at PS-DBM is under procurement process. Meanwhile procurement for supply, delivery and installation of ICT Machinery and Equipment/computer software for ICT; and testing and commissioning of communication network and equipment, the PITC had scheduled pre-bid conference and opening of bids in December 2020 and January 202, respectively.  Further, they already procured hardware and software that were put into use to boost capability of fire stations nationwide in its day-to-day operations, noting the fact that most of fire stations are not sufficiently equipped with hardware such as desktop computers, laptops, printers and scanners.  



	22)	Management added that the supply, delivery, installation testing and commissioning of DRS for BFP Region 10 commenced its work after issuance of Notice of Award to supplier, however, due to declaration of ECQ due to COVID 19, requests for work suspensions were made by supplier.  



	23)	Furthermore, with regard to budget for trainings, the amount pertained to  travel expenses realigned to training expenses; mobile expenses and internet subscription realigned for procurement of spare batteries for radios of  R4A and R11.  On the issue of laxity in monitoring of ICT projects, BFP ensures that ICTMS will be more aggressive in its monitoring and evaluation of all Agency’s projects.



Mandatory Submission of Contracts/POs



1)	Copies of contracts and/or purchase orders (PO)/work orders (WO) of infrastructure projects, goods or services with supporting documents of five BFP Regional Offices were not submitted to the Audit Team for review contrary to COA Cir.

	Management agreed in the Exit Conference to comply with the rules and regulations on submission of advance copies of contracts and/or POs/WOs and necessary supporting documents for procurement of goods or services and/or infrastructure projects within the prescribed period.

	

5

Management assured the Audit Team that contracts for said projects shall be submitted immediately.  It will observe timelines on submission of contracts and supporting documents.



6

Management commented that failure to notify the Audit Team of accepted deliveries and submission of POs within prescribed period could be attributed to placing Iloilo and nearby provinces under ECQ wherein travel restrictions and cancellation of flights from Iloilo-Manila and vice versa resulted in delay in mailing of signed POs from suppliers located in Luzon area.

  

11

	Management committed to take heed on the recommendations and ensure timely submission of all perfected contracts within the time prescribed. Accordingly, proper coordination between the BAC Secretariat and the Infrastructure Unit is being made on the submission of supporting documents of all contracts entered into by Management.

	

	

	

	

	





Gender and Development (GAD)



2)	BFP was not able to implement programs and activities for Gender and Development (GAD) due to: a) delayed/non-submission by some Regional Offices of GAD Plans and Budget (GPB) and corresponding Accomplishment Report (AR) for CY 2020; and b) failure to fully utilize GAD appropriations for the year contrary to PCW-NEDA-DBM JC No. 2012-01, C OA Circular No. 2014-001 dated March 18, 2014 and Section 31 of RA No. 1165 (GAA).   



	1)	Section V of COA Cir. No. 2014-001 dated March 18, 2014 requires submission of a copy of Annual GPB to Audit Team assigned to the agency within in five working days from receipt of approved plan from PCW or their Central Offices, as the case maybe. Likewise, copy of corresponding Accomplishment Report shall be furnished to Audit Team within five working days from end of January of the preceding year.



	2)	Section 8.1 of PCW-NEDA-DBM JC No. 2012-01 provides that pursuant to Section 37A.1 of the MCW-IRR, all agencies, offices, bureaus and all government instrumentalities and others concerned shall formulate their annual GPB within the context of their mandate.



	3)	Section 31 of R.A. No. 11465, GAA of FY 2020 states that all agencies of the government shall formulate a GAD Plan designed to address gender issues within their concerned sectors or mandate and implement applicable provisions under RA No. 9710 or the Magna Carta of Women, Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the Beijing Platform for Action, the Philippine Plan for Gender-Responsive Development (1995-2025), and the Philippine Development Plan (2017-2022).



a)	Non-submission of GAD Plan and Budget and Accomplishment Report



	4)	For CY 2020, the GAD Focal Persons of the following Regions did not submit within the timelines set by PCW copies of duly approved GAD Plan and Budget and the corresponding Accomplishment Report to their respective Audit Teams.



Region

Observation

Reason

NHQ

NHQ did not submit within the timelines set by PCW copies of its duly approved GPB and AR to the NHQ Audit Team

-

NCR

BFP NCR failed to submit copies of its duly revised GPB; thus, evaluation of its targeted programs, activities and projects could not be made to determine whether the Agency implements GPB as endorsed by PCW.  The submitted AR to the Audit Team was not in accordance with the prescribed form by the PCW, NEDA and DBM, rendering the Agency non-compliant with the provisions of the PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular 2012-01.







BFP-NCR reported that they realigned their funds for urgent social concern for the protection of its personnel who serve as frontliners during pandemic. They procured PPE and distributed to all fire stations/substations, Emergency Medical Service Units and Special Rescue Units.



Procurement of PPEs amounting to ₱6,830,143.00 may not be relevant on GAD programs and activities in addressing gender issues within their concerned sectors or mandate due to insufficiency of data and lack of supporting documents.

1

The GAD Focal Person did not submit within the timelines set by PCW copies of duly approved GPB and the corresponding AR to the Regional Audit Team.



According to the Focal Person, they really intend to prepare the GPB but due to COVID-19 Pandemic, failed to do so because several personnel were assigned as frontliners to man the boundary checkpoints of LGUs and also, BFP RO1 was locked down several times because of COVID-19 infected personnel.

4B

Gender responsiveness of reported programs and activities in the GAD AR for CY 2020 could not be ascertained due to:

--	Absence of PCW-endorsed or Central Office-reviewed GPB

--	GAD AR include programs not included in the submitted GPB

--	COVID-19 related activity attributed to GAD not properly reflected in the AR

BFP MIMAROPA did not revise its GPB and that there are no available data to ensure that reported COVID-related activity in GAD AR addresses gender issues and concerns arising from unequal status of their women and men stakeholders due to the COVID-19 situation.



	5)	Section 31 of R.A. No. 11465, or GAA of FY 2020 further requires that GAD Plan shall be integrated in regular activities of the agencies which shall be at least five percent of their annual budget.  For this purpose, activities currently being undertaken by agencies which relate to GAD or those that contribute to poverty alleviation, economic empowerment especially of marginalized women, protection, promotion, and fulfillment of human rights, and practice of gender-responsive governance are considered sufficient compliance with said requirement.  Utilization of GPB shall be evaluated on the GAD performance indicators identified by said agencies.



b)	GAD appropriation not fully utilized



	6)	In Region 3, the GPB and AR were accomplished and submitted to concerned agencies in accordance with Section 31 of RA No. 1165 (GAA).  However, amount appropriated for GAD programs, projects and activities for CY 2020 was not fully utilized at year end; thus, defeating the intent of the programs to pursue women’s empowerment and gender equality. 



	7)	Total appropriations of BFP-Region III for FY 2020 amounted to ₱147,382,132.69 where ₱7,723,614.24 or 5 percent of total appropriations were allocated for GAD program, projects and activities. Actual cost incurred in implementation of activities amounted to ₱3,441,946.50 or 44.56 percent of the allotted budget.

	8)	It was noted that the amount appropriated for GAD programs, projects and activities in CY 2020 was not fully utilized leaving an unexpended balance of ₱4,281,667.74 at year-end. 



	9)	According to Management there were two GAD activities which were cancelled due to pandemic that hit the country; thus, the reason for non-utilization. 



	10)	In Region 5, it allocated the amount of ₱4,814,540.00 for GAD programs and activities for CY 2020, however, only 48.67 percent of the GAD budget or ₱2,343,416.64 were spent on client and organization focused activities.  Other planned programs were not implemented to give priority to activities in response to COVID 19 pandemic crisis.



	11)	In BARMM, GAD budget for various activities amounted to ₱2,983,000.0 while the amount disbursed totaled to ₱810,414.84, leaving a balance of  ₱2,172,585.16.



	12)	Consolidated BFP GAD Plan and Budget and related reports/documents were not submitted to the Audit Tem for review and evaluation.  Below is the matrix showing GAD allocation or 5 percent of total appropriations and utilization/actual expenditures of other BFP ROs.

	13)	BFP-NHQ’s non-compliance with timely submission of required documents precluded the Audit Team from verifying the implemented programs, activities and projects and determining whether the Agency implemented GAD Plan and Budget as endorsed by PCW in accordance with aforementioned Circular and whether corresponding Accomplishment Report has been received and reviewed by PCW.



	14)	We recommended that Management instruct the Regional Directors to require their respective GAD Focal Person to:



a)	submit agency’s GAD Plan and Budget to BFP NHQ for review and/or consolidation for subsequent submission to PCW for review and endorsement to DBM, to ensure that programs, activities and projects in the GPB are within the context of the agency mandate and GAD agenda; 

b)	submit Accomplishment Report based on PCW endorsed GAD Plan and Budget to the Audit Team in accordance with COA Circular No. 2014-001; 



c)	observe the essential elements in preparing the annual plan and budget and timeline in the submission of mandatory reports;

d)	maximize utilization of GAD funds by adopting allowable and doable strategies considering constraints brought about by current pandemic. 



	15)	Management submitted the following comments:



Region

Management Comment

NCR

Management commented that PPEs were procured for adequate suitable protective equipment of personnel especially female firefighters composed the IATF Covid-19 contingents during the period of March 18, 2020 to June 13, 2020. 



1

Management has not submitted GAD Plan for CY 2020 due to frequent changes in the composition of their GAD Committee members which affected efficiency and effectiveness of implementation of GAD Plans and even its responsiveness on compliances required by other agencies. In addition, significant amount of attention, manpower, and financial resources were focused more on the response to Covid-19 Pandemic. On the other hand, BFP Region 1 has its GPB for CY 2020 which was submitted to BFP NHQ. Management also commented that the recommendations will be put into action.



4B

Management commented that programs in GAD Accomplishment Report that were not included in the submitted GAD Plan and Budget were programs not conducted from the 2019 GPB and were accomplished only in CY 2020. Nevertheless, BFP MIMAROPA GFPS will take into consideration the audit recommendation.







Senior Citizens (SCs) and Persons with Disability (PWD)



3)	BFP was not able to implement programs and activities that will address the concerns of senior citizens and persons with disability due to failure of some Regional Offices to allocate funds for the purpose contrary to Section 32 of RA No. 11465 otherwise known as GAA FY 2020.  



	1)	Section 32, General Provisions of GAA for 2020, RA No. 11465 requires that:

		

  All agencies of the government shall formulate plans, programs and projects intended to address the concerns of senior citizens and persons with disability, insofar as it relates to their mandated functions, and integrate the same in their regular activities.



Moreover, all government facilities, including infrastructure, non-infrastructure and civil works projects of the government as well as office buildings, streets and highways shall provide architectural or structural features, designs or facilities that will reasonably enhance the mobility, safety and welfare of persons with disability pursuant to Batas Pambansa Blg. 344 and R.A. No. 7277.



	2)	Likewise, Section 4.2 of Joint DBM and DSWD Circular No. 2003-01 dated April 28, 2003 provides that, all government agencies, departments, bureaus, offices, commissions and state universities and colleges shall allocate at least one percent (1%) of their respective budget for the implementation of plans, programs, projects, activities and services for older persons and persons with disabilities.



	3)	Verification of agency’s compliance on the above stated provisions revealed that for CY 2020, some of the ROs as listed below failed to allocate funds and formulate programs, projects and activities for senior citizens and differently-abled persons, to wit:



Region

Observations

Reasons

NHQ

No information nor document was provided to Audit Team whether the Agency allocated budget for senior citizen and PWD contrary to Section 32 of RA No. 11465, GAA FY 2020.



NCR

No information nor document is provided to Audit Team whether BFP-NCR has allocated budget for SC and PWD contrary to Section 32 of RA No. 11465 otherwise known as GAA FY 2020

BFP – NCR failed to submit its program for SC and PWD for CY 2020 due to limitation of funds but commits to allocate budget for the said program on 2021.

1

No SC and PWD Program included in their report.



2

The agency failed to formulate plans, programs and projects for SCs and PWDs which is not compliant with Section 32 of the General Provisions of RA 11465 otherwise known as GAA FY 2020.

Failed to fully integrate plans, programs and projects related to SCs and PWDs in its regular activities, budget and Annual Work and Financial Plan for CY 2020 particularly in the design and construction of Fire Station buildings to accommodate safety and welfare of PWDs.

3

The BFP-RO III failed to allocate funds and formulate plans, programs and projects that will address concerns of SCs and PWDs as required under Section 32 of RA No. 11465 otherwise known as GAA, FY 2020.

Plans, programs and projects were not formulated due to failure of BFP-NHQ to provide budget for the RO, hence said programs, projects and activities were not implemented as of end of year.

4B

Although the Region implemented its programs and projects for this Sector, the total amount disbursed of ₱305,339.80 or 0.51 percent of its total appropriations of P60,154,566.40,   was far below one percent requirement as required in Joint DBM-DSWD Circular No. 2003-01 dated April 28, 2003. 15.4.



5

No SCs and PWD Program included in their report



11

Non-preparation of plans, programs and projects for Senior Citizens and PWDs

	A recurring situation almost every 2 years in the agency due to the high rate of turn-over or change of positions and assignments of uniformed personnel or Non-Commissioned Officers (NCOs) who are usually designated as in-charge for projects and activities related to SCs and PWDs. Usually newly designated officials either completely overlooked what to do and implement with regard to the objective or they just assume that they will not be asked about their accomplishments at the end of the year.

BARMM

The BARMM had no plans/programs/projects related to the differently-abled persons and senior citizens for the year 2020.

Management had not formulated any plans and projects related to SCs and PWDs. Verification of Advices of Allotment revealed that there were no funds provided by BFP-NHQ to this Region specifically for SCs and PWDs for the year.



	4)	However, it is noteworthy to mention that other ROs were able to comply with GAA provisions of providing projects and programs for SCs and PWDs, to wit:



Region

Programs and Projects

CAR

The Agency has provided priority lanes for SCs, pregnant women and PWDs in BFP RO, the Provincial Fire Marshall and Fire Stations.

4A

Region provided covered walkways and priority lane or front-line desk services to address t concerns of their clients especially SCs, PWDs, as well as pregnant women.

4B

The agency disbursed the amount of ₱305,339.80 or 0.51 percent of its total appropriations for the provision of comfort rooms in every floor of the new BFP MIMAROPA building which provides priority clients easy access to comfort rooms, and provision of ramp in construction of Magsaysay and El Nido Fire Station to provide ease of entry for clients transacting with wheel chair. 

6

The Agency provided comfort rooms intended for females and PWDs at Fire Stations in 10 municipalities of the Region.

12

BFP XII provided signages and facilities in all of their fire stations to provide assistance to SCs and PWDs, expedite their transactions, and remind them of their privileges.



	5)	We recommended that Management:



a)		for NHQ, allocate at least one percent of agency’s budget for implementation of programs and projects for SCs and PWDs at regional level; and 

	

b)		strictly require all regions to formulate plans, programs and projects (PPAs) intended to address concerns of SCs and PWDs, insofar as it relates to agency’s mandated functions and integrate the same in its regular activities as required by law to enhance mobility, safety, and welfare of SCs and PWDs.

	

	6)	Management commented the following:



Region

Management Comment

NCR

Management commented that due to limitation of its budget allocation and implementation of IATF protocols in relation to Covid-19, BFP – NCR failed to submit its program for SCs and PWDs for CY 2020.

1

No SC and PWD Program included in their report

2

	Management agreed to give their utmost attention and comply strictly to the recommendations. Regional Director stressed that they intend to put up facilities, projects and implement programs and activities that could accommodate the needs of SC and Differently- Abled Persons.

3

	Management commented that they incorporated in project designs of its infrastructure projects facilities that address concerns of SCs and PWDs.  In CY 2020, four construction projects of typical design fire stations with ramps and comfort rooms were successfully completed.  With said facilities, these fire stations benefit SCs and PWDs in accessing BFP frontline services.  However, no certain amount can be allocated to the said accomplishment.

5

No SCs and Persons with Disability Program included in their report

11

During exit conference, Focal Person committed to prioritize and provide PPAs for SCs and PWDs to integrate in their regular activities.  

BARMM
