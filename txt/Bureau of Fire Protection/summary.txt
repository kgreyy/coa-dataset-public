C)	 SCOPE OF AUDIT



The audit covered the operations and financial transactions for CY 2020 of the BFP NHQ and 17 Regional Offices .





D)	INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT



The Auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the financial statements of the Bureau of Fire Protection as at December 31, 2020, in view of the accounting errors which constituted 6.71 percent of total assets and accounting deficiencies as shown in the Matrix of Analysis on the Effects of Misstatements on the Financial Statements marked as Annex A.



E)	SUMMARY OF AUDIT OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



1)	Fair presentation of several accounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements was affected due to accounting errors and accounting deficiencies totaling ₱1,357,051,183.49 and ₱4,101,875,607.06, respectively, which include double recording of assets, unrecorded receivables and Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE), misclassification of accounts, unrecorded adjustment on fund transfers and non-maintenance of PPE Ledger Cards, Supplies Ledger Cards, Property Cards and Stock Cards, among others. (Observation No. 1)

		

We recommended that Management: (a) effect necessary adjustments on errors among others, erroneous recording of transactions and misclassification of accounts to correct reported balances of affected accounts in the financial statements;            (b) observe highest objectivity and consistency in keeping of accounts in accordance with the GAM and other existing accounting rules and regulations to safeguard against inaccurate/misleading information; (c) expedite reconciliation on the variance noted between records of Accounting Service and Supply and Property Section;      (d) cause immediate disposal of unserviceable properties to prevent further deterioration and decrease in value.  Submit Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property and all necessary documents to the Chief, Accounting Section to serve as basis in derecognition in the books of account; and (e) submit lacking and/or original copies of necessary documents to support affected transactions.



2)	Two BFP Regional Offices are non-compliant with Section 11 of Rule IX of the Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (RIRR) of RA No. 11032 due to gaps and/or absence of Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) on the collection and remittance of Fire Safety Inspection Fees (FSIF) by Local Government Units (LGUs). Thereby, exposing to risk of loss, possible misapplication and utilization of collected income. (Observation No. 2)

	

We recommended that Management: (a) require the City/Municipal Fire Stations thru Fire Marshals to enter into MOA with concerned LGUs giving authority to assess and collect FSIF; (b) require the concerned City/Municipal Fire Marshals to initiate the revision of MOA pertaining to the schedule or frequency of remittance of FSIF to BFP which is not later than two days after transaction is made; and (c) for uniformity, include in existing MOA between LGUs and BFP clear provision on percentage of FSIF remittance by the former (LGUs) to the latter (BFP).



3)	Accuracy and completeness of collections and remittances of Fire Code Fees (FCF) of BFP Regional Office Nos. 4B and 5 were doubtful due to: (a) delayed remittance of FCF by Collecting Agents to Authorized Government Depository Bank;              (b) inaccurate or unsupported Report of Collections and Deposits; and c) unvalidated and/or blurred deposit slips of remittances, contrary to the pertinent provisions of PD No. 1445 and GAM Volume 1. (Observation No. 3)

	

We recommended that Management require the: (a) concerned Regional Directors to closely monitor their respective Collecting Officers/Agents’ compliance with existing laws and regulations on proper handling, custody and reporting of collections to safeguard government funds from misuse or misapplication; and (b) concerned Collecting Agents to submit complete and accurate mandatory reports with supporting documents to Accounting Unit for proper accounting and recording. 



4)	Deficiencies in handling, recording and disposition of cash advances of the designated Special Disbursing Officer and Petty Cash Custodian in NHQ and in Regional Offices were noted, such as: (a) cash advances totaling ₱23,716,546.16 remained unliquidated as of year-end even if the purpose for which it was given has already been served; (b) additional cash advances were granted even if previous ones were not yet liquidated resulting in overlapping of cash advances; (c) cash transactions were not recorded daily in the prescribed Cash Disbursements Record; (d) non-conduct of trainings/briefings/seminars to newly appointed Accountable Officers; (e) non-reconciliation of Accountable Officers and Accounting Office’s records; (f) expired fidelity bond of Accountable Officers; and (g) no proper turnover of government funds and property from outgoing to incoming officers. These practices are contrary to the provisions of COA Cir. No. 97-002, Revised Cash Examination Manual and GAM Vol. 1. (Observation No. 4)

	

We recommended that Management: (a) require concerned Accountable Officers to submit liquidating documents to settle their accountabilities and instruct the Accountants to monitor closely the liquidation of outstanding cash advances and issue demand letters to Accountable Officers for immediate settlement of their accountabilities; (b) require the Chief Accountant to monitor closely Accountable Officers cash advances to avoid overlapping of the same; and refrain from granting additional cash advances to Accountable Officers unless previous ones are settled or proper accounting thereof is made in conformity with Section 46 Chapter II of the RCEM; (c) require the Accountable Officers to strictly record all cash transactions in the Cash Disbursement Record on a daily basis; (d) require the Accountable Officers to attend training or briefing on grant, utilization and liquidation of cash advances as well as records maintenance for Petty Cash Fund and other disbursement transactions in accordance with COA Cir. No. 97-002; (e) require the Accountable Officers to reconcile Cash Disbursement Record with accounting records (GL/SLs) periodically to arrive at an accurate and reliable cash balance; (f) require the concerned Accountable Officers to apply for renewal of fidelity bond; and (g) strictly comply with Sections 75 and 77 of PD 1445 I on proper turnover of government funds and property from outgoing to incoming officers; and require the Provincial Fire Marshals to furnish the Finance Section, RO, with copy of all orders of transfers/ assignment of Accountable Officers. Inform promptly the Audit Team of such movements so that mandatory cash examination be conducted before outgoing Accountable Officers are relieved of their cash accountabilities.



5)	Collections from sale of bid documents and receipt of guaranty/security deposits of nine BFP-Regional Offices were deposited to the local currency current account instead of the account of the Bureau of the Treasury contrary to Section 6 of the General Provisions of RA No. 11465 or the GAA for FY 2020. (Observation No. 5)

	

We recommended that Management require the concerned BFP Regional Offices to close the current account maintained for collections from the sale of bid documents and receipt of guaranty/security deposits and thereafter, remit the balance to the BTr.

	

6)	Funds transferred to PS-DBM and PITC totaling ₱4,137,007,323.39 for procurement of supplies, materials, equipment and infrastructure projects remained outstanding for several years due to failure of said agencies to deliver the items procured. Thus, depriving the agency of its immediate use which are crucial in the operation of the agency. (Observation No. 6)



We recommended that Management: (a) make a strong representation with PS-DBM and PITC for the immediate delivery of all long outstanding balances of fund transfers, otherwise, demand the refund of unutilized fund transfers; and (b) make use of or utilize the BFP-NHQ’s BAC in procurement of firefighting equipment, trucks, gears and construction of fire stations.



7)	Gaps in the implementation of repairs and maintenance of fire stations, buildings and fire trucks in BFP Regional Offices were noted such as:  (a) abandonment by the contractor of the repair/improvement of fire station; (b) late release of funds by BFP-NHQ intended for completion of repairs and maintenance of fire trucks; and            (c) inappropriate approval and non-submission of documentary requirements on request for work suspension and extension of time, contrary to the pertinent provisions of RA 9184 and GAM Vol. 1. (Observation No. 7)

	

We recommended that Management: (a) for NCR, require the Logistics Division to facilitate blacklisting of CDJ Builders and Construction Supplies for abandonment of construction project in Pateros Fire Station, in accordance with GPPB Uniform Guidelines for blacklisting of manufacturers, suppliers, distributors, contractors and consultants; (b) for CAR, instruct the Accounting Section to: (i) consolidate and update the ledger cards by recording all major and minor repairs conducted in CY 2019 and prior years; (ii) record in the ledger cards all repairs conducted for the year even if not yet paid; and (iii) furnish a copy of updated ledger cards the Fire Stations for reference in succeeding repair transactions; (c) for RO 3, make a representation with BFP-NHQ for the early release of funds to hasten implementation of projects considering the necessity of fully operational firetrucks in the performance and delivery of services being the mandate of the agency; and (d) for RO 4A, require the Chief, Logistics Division to strictly observe provisions of Annex A to E, Par. 10 of the IRR of RA 9184 and A to H of COA Cir. No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009 in recommending approval of request for extension of contract time by contractors and submission of required documents on specific transactions, otherwise, impose appropriate liquidated damages against erring contractors for unreasonable delays under existing or awarded contracts



8)	Seven BFP Regional Offices failed to initially register or renew registration of 421 fire trucks and other vehicles with the Land Transportation Office for CY 2020, contrary to Section 5 Article 1, Chapter II of RA No. 4136 or the Land Transportation and Traffic Code. This resulted in incurrence of penalty and other unnecessary expenses amounting to ₱75,522.06 upon renewal inconsistent with COA Circular No. 2012-003. (Observation No. 8)



We reiterated our prior years’ recommendation that Management formulate specific guidelines in the registration of motor vehicles by the NHQ and ROs consistent with existing rules and regulations. We also recommended that Management require the Motor Vehicle Section of ROs to request status/update on fire trucks owned and/or donated by LGUs and other government agencies. If not yet registered, request for records and documents to facilitate initial registration of motor vehicle. 



9)	The balance of the account Due to NGAs totaling ₱5,125,901.73 representing inter-agency fund transfers from two national government agencies remained unliquidated and unutilized as of December 31, 2020, contrary to COA Cir. No. 94-013. Moreover, non-utilization of funds intended for major programs related to the agency mandate reflects inefficiency in its operational functions and non-delivery of planned results. (Observation No. 9)



We recommended that Management (a) require the responsible office to closely monitor implementation and utilization of funds received from source agencies;      (b) require the Accounting Service to submit to the Audit Team latest report of disbursements to DOE and DILG showing current status/balances of the inter-agency transferred funds; and (c) immediately refund to DOE the balance of P1,874,356.83 which remained unutilized since 2017.



10)	The propriety of disbursements amounting to ₱605,824,714.08 made by BFP in response to COVID 19 pandemic is doubtful due to: (a) lacking supporting documents and deficiencies noted in the transactions amounting to ₱88,880,198.73; (b) difference between the cost of procured goods against the price ceiling set by DOH pursuant to Department Memoranda Nos. 2020-0058-B and 2020-0131; and (c) grant of Meal Allowance to BFP personnel amounting to ₱41,001,099.31 inconsistent with existing regulations. (Observation No. 10)



We recommended that Management: (a) instruct the Regional Directors to require concerned and responsible offices to submit the specific and original copies of lacking documents and submit explanation on deficiencies noted on certain transactions and refrain from processing claims not adequately supported with valid documents; (b) submit justification for procurement of PPEs with relatively higher than the price ceiling set by DOH pursuant to Dept. Memo No. 2020-0144; No. 2020-0058-B and No. 2020-0131; and (c) submit justification on grant of meals to BFP personnel despite receipt of Subsistence Allowance and grant of meal allowances in cash instead of in kind in BFP RO 4B.



11)	Daily Travel Expenses (DTE) totaling ₱8,929,500.00 paid to 1,183 BFP-NCR personnel during deployment in the 30th Southeast Asian Games (SEAGAMES) deviates from maximum allowable DTE rates prescribed under Section 6 of EO No. 77 dated March 15, 2019. (Observation No. 11)



We recommended that Management submit explanation on why excess payment of DTE amounting to ₱5,393,418.00 should be allowed in audit; otherwise, require the refund of excess payment from concerned BFP-NCR personnel.



12)	Various BFP infrastructure projects implemented by BFP-NHQ and BFP Regional Office Nos. 4B, 5, and 6 totaling to ₱160,221,177.29 were unsatisfactorily executed due to gaps and/or deficiencies in the project implementation and departure from the provisions of RA No. 9184. (Observation No. 12)



We recommended that Management: (a) For BFP-NHQ, require the contractor of radio system to look into the installation of Digital Radio System (DRS) especially in far flung areas and re-installation or repair to be able to sustain the project and achieve effectiveness of the Bureau’s operations in their quick response during disasters and emergencies; (b) For RO 4B and RO 6 – (i) ensure that contract extension shall be granted only on conditions provided under Annex E of the 2016 Revised IRR of RA 9184; (ii) strictly and properly check capability of contractors prior to award of contract to ensure full compliance to stipulations in the contract; and (iii) instruct the Regional Accountant to compute for liquidated damages on contracts with delayed implementation; (c) For RO 5 – (i) require the Contractors to submit Building Permits and Fire Safety Evaluation Clearances (FSEC), in compliance with the provisions of National Building Code and Fire Code of the Philippines; (ii) ensure that contracts submitted to COA are supported with complete documentation pursuant to COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 24, 2012 and provisions of DOLE; and (iii) direct the Accounting Unit to determine unrecouped amount and require Contractor to secure required irrevocable stand by letter of credit covering unrecouped amount. Henceforth, ensure submission by the Contractor of an irrevocable stand by letter of credit of equivalent value as advance payment to be made as required by the law on procurement.



13)	The objective of Information System Strategic Plan to automate interior processes of integrated system in either web-based or using Global System for mobile communication integration intranet accessible to both BFP personnel and the public was not fully achieved on its sixth year of implementation despite its high utilization rate of funds for the purpose which could be attributed to: (a) partial completion of  ISSP Phase I with budget allocation of ₱206,686,233.68 already transferred to PITC and PS-DBM; (b) undelivered information and Communication Technology (ICT) Equipment for Phase II valued at ₱54,765,176.09; (c) failure to conduct trainings in 2019 to 2020 as programmed; and (d) lax monitoring of ICT projects. (Observation No. 13)



We recommended that Management: (a) make a strong representation with PITC and PS DBM for immediate delivery of long overdue equipment and software to be able to complete the IMSP Project since component ICT equipment procured for the purpose are already depreciating while the system is not yet fully operational;          (b) closely monitor delivery of Railworks Corporation for the Supply, Delivery, Installation, Testing and Commissioning of Digital Radio System for BFP Region 10 as it should already be delivered per work order; (c) submit explanation as to why trainings are not conducted despite availability of funds; and (d) strictly monitor implementation of ISSP Project Phase II through close coordination with Directorate for Information and Communication Technology Management, Logistics, Budget, Accounting and Logistic Support Service, and prioritize procurement of communication network and ICT software and systems vital to implementation of the projects before procurement of depreciable assets to avoid wastage of government funds.



14)	Copies of contracts and/or purchase orders (PO)/work orders (WO) of infrastructure projects, goods or services with supporting documents of five BFP Regional Offices were not submitted to the Audit Team for review contrary to COA Cir. No. 2009-01 dated February 12, 2009.   Moreover, Notice of Delivery, Inspection and Acceptance Reports and other supporting documents were not submitted within 24 hours from receipt or acceptance of goods delivered or services rendered which hindered timely audit, review and evaluation of contracts and inspection of deliveries. (Observation No. 14)



We recommended that Management: (a) submit copies of all contracts and its supporting documents to the Audit Team in accordance with COA Cir. No. 2009-001 to allow timely review and evaluation; and (b) require the Regional Director to instruct the BAC Chairman to furnish the Audit Teams with advance copies of approved POs/WOs, Notice of Deliveries as well as IARs and supporting documents within five days and 24 hours upon delivery, respectively.



15)	BFP was not able to implement programs and activities for Gender and Development (GAD) due to: (a) delayed/non-submission by some Regional Offices of GAD Plans and Budget (GPB) and corresponding Accomplishment Report (AR) for CY 2020; and (b) failure to fully utilize GAD appropriations for the year contrary to PCW-NEDA-DBM JC No. 2012-01, C OA Circular No. 2014-001 dated March 18, 2014 and Section 31 of RA No. 1165 (GAA). (Observation No. 15)



We recommended that Management instruct the Regional Directors to require their respective GAD Focal Person to: (a) submit agency’s GAD Plan and Budget to BFP NHQ for review and/or consolidation for subsequent submission to PCW for review and endorsement to DBM, to ensure that programs, activities and projects in the GPB are within the context of the agency mandate and GAD agenda; (b) submit Accomplishment Report based on PCW endorsed GAD Plan and Budget to the Audit Team in accordance with COA Circular No. 2014-001; (c) observe the essential elements in preparing the annual plan and budget and timeline in the submission of mandatory reports; and (d) maximize utilization of GAD funds by adopting allowable and doable strategies considering constraints brought about by current pandemic. 



16)	BFP was not able to implement programs and activities that will address the concerns of senior citizens and persons with disability due to failure of some Regional Offices to allocate funds for the purpose contrary to Section 32 of RA No. 11465 otherwise known as GAA FY 2020. (Observation No. 16)



We recommended that Management: (a) for NHQ, allocate at least one percent of agency’s budget for implementation of programs and projects for SCs and PWDs at regional level; and (b) strictly require all regions to formulate plans, programs and projects (PPAs) intended to address concerns of SCs and PWDs, insofar as it relates to agency’s mandated functions and integrate the same in its regular activities as required by law to enhance mobility, safety, and welfare of SCs and PWDs.



The foregoing observations and recommendations were brought to the attention of concerned officials of the agency in our letter dated April 26, 2021.  Management’s views and reactions were incorporated in this report, where appropriate.
