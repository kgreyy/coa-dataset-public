AUDIT OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
 
FINANCIAL AUDIT 
 
Accounting Errors / Omissions and deficiencies   
 
1. The reported balance as of December 31, 2020 of Assets and Liabilities is 

understated by ₱0.488 million and ₱2.971 million, respectively, while Net 
Assets/Equity is overstated by ₱2.483 million; included various deficiencies in 
the keeping of accounts that have significant impact on Management’s assertion 
on accuracy, completeness and existence of the reported account balances 
thus, affecting the fair presentation of the accounts in the financial statements.   

 
1.1 Section 15 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) states that “The 

Financial Statements (FS) shall present fairly the financial position, financial 
performance and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful 
representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in 
accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, 
revenue, and expenses set out in IPSAS.” 
 

1.2 Our audit of the College’s FS disclosed misstatements and deficiencies in the 
keeping of accounts in several of its accounts and discussed in detail in the 
succeeding paragraphs and summarized as follows:

Understatement of Cash in Bank – Local Currency and Inter-Agency Payables (Due to 
National Government Agencies) - ₱1.051 million 
 
2. Reconciling items identified in the Bank Reconciliation Statement (BRS) for 

Special Trust Fund (STF) amounting to ₱1.051 million were not adjusted in the 
Agency’s book of accounts, contrary to Chapter 21 of the GAM, thus 
understating the accounts Cash in Bank – Local Currency and Inter-Agency 
Payables (Due to NGAs) by the same amount as of December 31, 2020.   

 
2.1 Item C, Section 3, Chapter 21 of GAM Volume I, states that the BRS shall be 

prepared in order to enable the agency/ entity or bank to take up charges or 
credits recognized by the bank or agency/entity but not yet known to the 
agency/entity or bank. 
 

2.2 Section 6 of the same provision provides that the Chief Accountant/Designated 
Staff shall prepare a journal entry voucher to recognize all reconciling items that 
require adjustment and correction in the books of accounts. 

 
2.3 Section 68 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 provides that no payment of 

any nature shall be received by a Collecting Officer without immediately issuing 
an official receipt in acknowledgement thereof.  The receipt may be in the form 
of postage, internal revenue or documentary stamps and the like, officially 
numbered receipts, subject to proper custody, accountability, and audit. 

 
2.4 We have reviewed the College’s BRS and performed an inspection of bank 

statements for all depository accounts of the College, as follows:

2.6 Our audit showed that as of December 31, 2020, the College received funds from 
Commission on Higher Education (CHED) for the payment of tuition fee and 
stipend allowance of CHED’s Tulong Dunong (TD) Program and Tertiary 
Education Subsidy (TES) scholars amounting to ₱1.051 million per credit memos

2.7 We noted that these credit memos were only included in the Report of Collections 

and Deposits for the month of January 2021 and were taken up in the books as 
Due to NGAs – CHED – TES and Due to NGAs – CHED – TD amounting to 
₱329,600.00 and ₱0.721 million, respectively. 
 

2.8 Inquiry with the preparer of the BRS revealed that these reconciling items were 
not taken up in the books as of CY 2020 since these were only receipted in 
January 2021. 

 
2.9 The non-adjustment of the reconciling items determined during the preparation 

of the BRS in the books of the College understates by ₱1.051 million the Cash 
in Bank – Local Currency and the Inter-Agency Payables (Due to NGAs) 
accounts presented in the Statement of Financial Position (SFP) and in the 
Statement of Cash Flows (SCF) as of December 31, 2020.  Moreover, the non-
adjustment of reconciling items in the books of the College defeats the purpose 
of preparing the bank reconciliation statements. 



29 
 

Recommendations 
 

2.10 We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 

a. Record all reconciling items that require adjustment and correction in the 
books of accounts in the period to which they relate; and, 
 

b. Coordinate with the Cashier Unit for the proper disposition of reconciling 
items. 
 

Unreconciled balances of Inventories - ₱1.410 million 
 

3. Balance of the inventory account as of December 31, 2020 amounting to ₱2.539 
million could not be relied upon due to unreconciled/unadjusted variance of 
₱1.410 million between the balances reported in the FS and in the Report of 
Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI). 
 
3.1 As of December 31, 2020, the FS of the College disclosed a balance of ₱2.539 

million.   A comparison between the balance per FS and the balance per  RPCI 
disclosed a variance of ₱1.410 million, as follows: 
 

Fund Per FS Per RPCI Variance 

Fund 101 ₱ 2,373,467.10 ₱ 1,055,646.19 ₱ 1,317,820.91

Total ₱ 2,539,381.70 ₱ 1,129,323.94 ₱ 1,410,057.76 

 
3.2 We conducted a test check of the Inventory accounts which disclosed the 

following circumstances/ reconciling items between the FS and RPCI balances:

These inventory balances 
came from the period prior 
to the implementation of the 
New Government 
Accounting System 
(NGAS), which up to the 
present issuances 
remained unrecorded due 
to non-preparation of the

were not yet included in the 
RPCI since the 
corresponding Inspection

were only approved on the 
ensuing year. This amount

3.3 We also noted the following: 

 
3.3.1 Inventories amounting to ₱133,770.47 purchased through the 

Procurement Service were recorded in the books of account under Other 
Supplies and Materials Inventory and Semi-Expendable Other Machinery 
and Equipment – GF but were reported under Office Supplies Inventory 
per RPCI.  Some of these inventories were already issued as reported in 
the Stock Cards (SCs). 
 

3.3.2 Various inventories, amounting to ₱364,585.71, issued from January to 
December 2020 were charged to Accumulated Surplus/ Deficit 
understating expense by the same amount.  Issuance of these inventories 
were from prior year purchases.  When inventories are distributed, their 
carrying amount shall be recognized as an expense in the period in which 
the goods are distributed or the related service is rendered. 
 

3.4 As shown in the above table, there is still an unreconciled variance of ₱23,989.51 
between the FS and RPCI balance while the amount presented in the FS of 
₱2.539 million is over by ₱0.563 million, after considering the reconciling items. 

 
Recommendation 



31 
 

3.5 We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Accounting and Supply 
Unit to reconcile their records to properly adjust the Inventory Account. For those 
items already issued in prior years, to direct the Supply Unit to prepare and 
submit to the Accounting Unit the RSMI/RIS or other supporting documents and 
require the Accounting Unit to prepare the necessary adjusting entry. 
 

No physical count of inventory and non-maintenance of Supply Ledger Card 
 
4. The non-conduct of physical count of inventory and non-maintenance of  

Supplies Ledger Cards (SLCs) by the Accounting Unit  cast doubt on the 
existence and accuracy of reported inventory. 

 
4.1 Pertinent rules and regulations mentioned in the GAM which governs property 

and supplies management and accounting are as follows: 
 

4.1.1 Section 13, Chapter 8 of GAM Volume I states that physical 
count/inventory, which is required semi-annually, is an 
indispensable procedure for checking the integrity of property 
custodianship. 
 

4.1.2 Supplies Ledger Card (SLC) (Appendix 57) – shall be used to 
record materials received, issued and the balance both in quantity 
and amount at any time.  It shall be maintained by the Accounting 
Division/Unit for each kind of supplies and materials.  The 
Inspection and Acceptance Report (IAR), Requisition and Issue 
Slip (RIS), RSMI, Purchase Order (PO) and Delivery Receipt (DR) 
serve as the original sources of information for making entries on 
the card. 
 

4.1.3 Appendix 66 of GAM Volume II states that the RPCI is a form used to 
report the physical count of inventory items by type such as Office 
Supplies Inventory; Accountable Forms Inventory; Medical, Dental and 
Laboratory Supplies Inventory; Food Supplies Inventory, etc. which are 
owned by the agency/entity. It shall be prepared semi-annually by the 
Inventory Committee and by fund cluster.  The report shall be reconciled 
with the SLCs and SCs maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit, and 
Property and/or Supply Division/Unit, respectively.  Any discrepancy 
shall be verified and/or adjusted accordingly. 

 
4.2 The conduct of physical count of inventory which is required semi-annually 

should be regarded with importance since this serves as the basis for the 
preparation of the FS. In all cases, this is vital in the planning of additional 
acquisitions and, if applicable, to ascertain the reliability of the College’s 
perpetual inventory system. 

 
4.3 Management disclosed that they were not able to conduct a physical count of 

inventory for the year due to the pandemic.  The data reflected in the RPCI were 
only based on the records of the Supply Unit, specifically the SCs and SLCs. 
 

4.4 To verify the existence of the reported inventories, we conducted a test check 
of the reported inventory.  Out of the ₱ 1.129 million reported inventory in the 
RPCI, we test checked the existence of inventories amounting to ₱0.984 million.  



32 
 

Results of test counts made on various items of supplies and materials 
conducted on January 11 & 26, 2021 are as follows:

Total ₱984,716.04 ₱894,522.35 ₱90,193.69 

 
4.5 We also noted that various items of supplies and materials inventory were also 

found in the stock room of the College that were not reported in the RPCI.  
Supplies and materials stored in the stock room are segregated by Supplier and 
not strategically segregated by nature, amount, size, weight, shape, turnover 
and perishability. 
 

4.6 As shown in the above table, there is a variance of P90,193.69 between the 
amount reported as against those actually found during the conduct of the test 
count. Resulting variances noted during the physical count by the Audit Team 
cast doubt on the inventories reported in the RPCI. 
 

4.7 The coronavirus (CoVid-19) pandemic has caused significant disruptions in the 
operations of Government Agencies.  These disruptions also pose significant 
accounting and auditing challenges.  One of those challenges is the conduct of 
physical inventory count, including attendance by auditors, due to significant 
health and safety concerns, varying quarantines, ever-changing restrictions, 
alternative work arrangements, and the fear caused by CoVid-19. 
 

4.8 Management can consider the physical count of Inventories at a date when it is 
practical and possible to do the same. They should revisit their inventory count 
strategy, plan and discuss the best possible course of action, with due regard to 
the observance of safety and health protocols. 
 

4.9 Under the provisions of GAM, SLC is maintained by the Accounting while the 
SC is maintained by the Supply Section. We noted that the SLCs for each type 
of supplies and materials are maintained by the Supply Unit instead of the 
Accounting Unit, which is contrary to the provisions of the GAM and sound 
internal control practices dictate that there should be proper monitoring and 
reconciliation of receipts and issuances of inventories for check and balance.  
This practice defeats the purpose of check and balance because the Accounting 
Unit should have its own records which are to be reconciled with records of the 
Supply Unit as a means of proving the existence and accuracy of the recorded 
inventories in the books of accounts maintained by the Accounting Unit. 

 
Recommendations 

 
4.10 We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 
a. Formulate a policy for the proper storing and handling, control, monitoring 

and recording of inventories; and, 
 



33 
 

b. Direct the Accounting Unit to maintain the SLCs and the Supply Unit to 
maintain SCs for each kind of supplies and materials; reconcile both records 
regularly and with the result of the physical count at the end of each year. 

 
Unreconciled Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) records 

 
5. The year-end balance of PPE amounting to P255.929 million 

 could not be relied upon due to unreconciled variance amounting to ₱27.425 
million between the balances reported in the FS and in the Report of Physical 
Count of Property Plant & Equipment (RPCPPE).   

 
5.1 Pertinent rules and regulations in the GAM which governs the property and 

supplies management and accounting are as follows: 
 
5.1.1 Section 20 of Chapter 10, Volume I state that deliveries of PPE shall be 

recorded immediately in the Property Card (PC) maintained by the 
Supply and/or Property Division/Unit which in turn shall be forwarded to 
the Accounting Division/Unit for the recording of deliveries in the books 
of accounts and in the PPELC. 
 

5.1.2 Section 42 thereof provides that for check and balance, the balance per 
PC shall be reconciled with PPELC maintained by the Accounting 
Division/Unit. The PPELC shall also be reconciled with the RPCPPE, 
the PC and the control accounts. Any discrepancies shall be 
immediately verified and adjusted. 

 
5.2 Review of the PPE balances of the College as of December 31, 2020 and 

comparison between the balances per FS and per RPCPPE showed an 
unreconciled variance amounting to ₱27.425 million, as follows:

5.5 Based on the foregoing, there still exist an unreconciled variance amounting to 

₱6.911 million between the FS and RPCPPE balance after considering the 
reconciling items.  The records of the Supply Office pertinent to properties of the 
College are supposed to prove the correctness and accuracy of the recorded 
assets in the books of accounts maintained by the Accounting Office. Existing 
variances of these two reports renders the balances of these accounts doubtful. 
 

5.6 The PPE account comprises 60.32 per cent of the total assets of the College.  
The existence of a significant amount of discrepancies in the PPE account 
balances is a perennial issue and casts doubt on the accuracy of the PPE 
balances presented in the FS.  Such condition, if not properly addressed will also 
be a qualification on the fairness of presentation of the financial position of the 
College.  It will deprive the public of reliable and useful information in decision-
making and accountability for these assets.  Thus, it is important for Management 
to come up with reliable PPE balances that are verifiable as to existence, 
condition and accountability. 

 
Recommendations 
 

5.7 We recommended to Management the following: 
 
a. Conduct physical count for the one-time cleansing of all its PPE in 

accordance with COA Circular 2020-006 dated January 31, 2020, whether 
acquired through purchase or donation, including those constructed by 
administration and found at station, which shall be witnessed by the COA 
Auditor; 
 

b. Adopt a uniform property identification system for PPE wherein a unique 
Property Number shall be assigned for each PPE item, using the numbering 
system prescribed in COA Circular 2020-006; 

 
c. Instruct the Inventory Committee to prepare a Physical Inventory Plan (PIP) 

to plan/strategize on how to conduct and complete the physical inventory 
within the prescribed period which shall be approved by the Head of Agency; 

 



38 
 

d. Instruct the Inventory Committee to submit to the COA Audit Team the 
approved PIP at least 10 calendar days before the scheduled start of 
inventory taking activities; 

 
e. Update property records based on the results of the physical inventory and 

reconcile the same with the accounting records to come up with the 
reconciled balances of PPE accounts to be considered as the correct balance 
of the College’s PPE; 

 
f. Instruct the Accounting Unit to maintain PPELC for each class of PPE, by 

fund cluster instead of the Inventory List of PPE; and, 
 

g. Restore fully depreciated PPE amounting to ₱3.98 million recorded under 
Other Assets to its proper PPE account. 

 
Management Comment 
 

5.8  Management acknowledges the observations and recommendations, and 
provides the following responses as its action plan: 
 
(i) The Office of Procurement, Inventory, and Assets (OPIA)/Supply Office is 

gradually conducting the physical count of different buildings.  It was just 
relaxed since the pandemic started but the office will warrant to increase 
the velocity in the inventory to take the one-time cleansing of all PPEs; 

 
(ii) Management issued a special order for the creation of its Inventory 

Committee and the Committee head prepared the PIP for the approval of 
the President and that the same will be submitted to the Office of the 
Auditor; and 

 
(iii) The management will monitor the action plan herein and warrant to take 

extra effort to comply with all the observations and recommendations. 
 

Understatement of Payables 
 
6. Expenses incurred in CY 2020 and prior year/s were not recognized in the books 

thus, understating Payables accounts by ₱1.92 million or 12.94 per cent of the 
total reported balance as of December 31, 2020, contrary to Section 119 of PD 
No. 1445. 

 
6.1 Section 119 of PD No. 1445, states that, all lawful expenditures and obligations 

incurred during the year, shall be taken up in the accounts of that year. 
 

6.2 Section 2, Chapter 6 of GAM Volume I defines accounts payable as valid and 
legal obligations of NGAs/ Operating Units, for which, goods/services/projects 
have been delivered/rendered/completed and accepted, regardless of the year 
when these obligations were incurred. (Emphasis added) 

 
6.3 Appendix III of GAM describes Due to Officers and Employees as the account to 

recognize incurrence of liability to officers and employees for salaries, benefits 
and other emoluments including authorized expenses advanced by the officers 
and employees.  On the other hand, Other Payables is the account used to 
recognize other liabilities not falling under any of the specific payable accounts. 
 



39 
 

6.4 Verification of CY 2020 financial transactions of the College – both GF and STF, 
showed that as of year-end the College has unrecorded payables amounting to 
₱1.92 million or 12.94 per cent of the total reported payables in the SFP, as 
presented in the following table:

6.5 During our audit, we noted the following deficiencies: 

 
i. The transactions above were obligated and disbursed by the College in the 

following year, January 2021, as well as the corresponding liabilities for 
these transactions which were charged to Accumulated Surplus/ Deficit. 

 
ii. Payment of salary differential for the period January to March 2020 and CNA 

for CY 2020 amounting to ₱2,817.37 and ₱25,000.00, respectively, were 
debited to DOE without prior recorded credits thus understating the DOE 
account as well as the Salaries & Wages – Regular and OBA – CNA 
accounts amounting to ₱2,817.37 and ₱25,000.00, respectively. 

 
iii. Payables incurred for the services rendered by personnel under contract of 

services (JO and VL), student laborers and payment of stipend allowance to 
CHED scholars were taken-up in the books under the DOE account. The 
following transactions remains outstanding in the account as of year-end:

6.6 Charges to DOE account should only cover liabilities to officers and employees 

for salaries, benefits and other emoluments including authorized expenses 
advanced by the officers and employees.  However, it was noted, that the 
reported balance of the DOE account does not only reflect the actual financial 
obligation/liability to officers/employees of the College.  Moreover, services from 
various payees which had already been rendered as of year-end were not 
recognized.  These unrecorded payables as of year-end understates the 
liabilities and the corresponding expense accounts affecting the fairness of the 
presentation of the FS. 
 

Recommendations 
 

6.7 We recommended that Management:  
 
a. Comply with the correct accounting treatment for payables and recognize 

valid and legal claims in the books, for which goods/services have been 
delivered/rendered, duly approved by head of office and supported with 
complete documentation; and, 
 

b. Instruct the Accounting Unit to reclassify payments of salaries and wages for 
services rendered by personnel under contract of services to AP and 
reclassify payments of allowance to student laborers and stipend allowance 



42 
 

to scholars to other payables, which remained outstanding under DOE as of 
year-end. 

 
Management Comments 
 

6.8 Management commented that the recommendation on the proper used of DOE, 
AP and Other Payable will be taken into strict consideration effective March 2021. 
Necessary adjusting entries will be prepared should there be recorded 
transactions that needs to be rectified. 

 
Erroneous recording of Other Receipts  
 
7. Remittances to the Bureau of Treasury (BTr) for CY 2020 amounting to 

₱273,384.35 were debited erroneously to Subsidy from National Government 
and/or directly to Accumulated Surplus/ (Deficit) without coursing through the 
Cash–Treasury/Agency Deposit accounts. Furthermore, constructive receipts 
and remittances of Notice of Cash Allocation (NCA) for Tax Remittance Advice 
(TRA) of  ₱15.981 million for CY 2020 were debited to account Due to Bureau of 
Internal Revenue (BIR) and credited to Subsidy from National Government, 
which are  inconsistent with the provisions of GAM 

 
7.1 Pertinent rules and regulations in the GAM, which governs the accounting for 

revenue and other receipts, remittance of collections to the National Treasury 
(NT) and deposits with the Authorized Government Depository Bank (AGDB) 
are as follows: 
 
7.1.1 Section 3 of Chapter 5, Volume I states that unless otherwise specifically 

provided by law, all revenue (income) accruing to the departments, 
offices and agencies by virtue of the provisions of existing laws, orders 
and regulations shall be deposited in the NT or in the duly authorized 
depository of the Government and shall accrue to the xxx General Fund 
of the Government: Provided, that amounts received in trust and from 
business-type activities of government may be separately recorded and 
disbursed in accordance with such rules and regulations as may be 
determined by the Permanent Committee. (Sec. 44, Chapter V, Book VI, 
E.O. No. 292 
 

7.1.2 Item d, f to h of Section 38, of the same Chapter of the Manual provides 
list of Other Receipts of NGAs which is composed of the following: 

 
d. TRA 
f. Refund of excess cash advances granted to officers and employees; 
g. Performance bond/security deposits; 
h. Refund of overpayment of expenses; 

 
7.2 Collections of the above-mentioned other receipts are debited to Cash-

Treasury/Agency Deposit accounts upon remittance to the BTr. Volume III of 
GAM describes these accounts as follows: 
 
i. Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, Regular, with account code 10104010, is 

used to recognize in the agency books the amount of collections remitted 
to the BTr under the General Fund, either directly or thru the AABs and 
AGDBs. At year end, credit this account to close to the Accumulated 
Surplus/(Deficit). 
 



43 
 

ii. Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, Special Account, with account code 
10104020, is used to recognize the amount of collections remitted to the 
BTr under the Special Account in the General Fund (SAGF). Credit this 
account to recognize receipt of NCA and upon closing of the SAGF. 

 
iii. Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, Trust, with account code 10104030, is 

used to recognize the amount of trust receipts/collections and trust funds 
remitted to the BTr and adjustments for lapsed NCA. Credit this account to 
recognize receipt of NCA and upon closing of the trust account. 

 
iv. Cash-Tax Remittance Advice, with account code 10104070, is debited for 

constructive receipts of NCA for TRA and credited for constructive 
remittances of taxes to BIR through TRA.  In the BIR books, this account is 
debited for the constructive receipt of tax revenue through TRA and 
credited for the yearend closing to Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit).  In the 
BTr books, this account is credited for the constructive utilization of NCA 
for TRA by the remitting agencies and debited upon closing to Accumulated 
Surplus/ (Deficit). 

  
7.3 Records show that from January to December 2020 remittances made to BTr 

were directly debited to Subsidy from National Government and Accumulated 
Surplus/ (Deficit) accounts, as follows:

Total ₱ 71,289.64  ₱ 202,094.71  ₱ 273,384.35 

 
7.4 Review on the transactions above showed that these remittances are for the 

collections of refund of excess cash advances of officers and employees, for 
payroll, excess salary payments, etc. under the general fund.  The account 
Subsidy from National Government is debited when the collections pertain to 
refund of cash advances or excess payment of salary in current year.  Otherwise, 
Accumulated Surplus/ (Deficit) is debited when the collections pertain to prior 
years’ transactions.  As a result, Subsidy from National Government account and 
Surplus for the period presented in the Statement of Financial Performance  as 
well as in the Statement of Changes in Net Assets/Equity is understated by 
₱71,289.64, as shown in the table next page:

7.5 On the other hand, we also noted that remittance to NT as presented in the SCF 

is overstated by ₱1,041.00 as follows: 
 

Remittance to NT per Detailed SCF (All Funds) ₱ 527,447.10 
Less: Total amount remitted to NT 526,406.10 

Overstatement – adjustment made for excess recording of 
deposit to BTR for the month of June 2020 ₱     1,041.00 

 
7.6 All collections under the general fund shall be deposited to the BTr by debiting 

Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, Regular or Special Account or Trust.  Cash-
Treasury/Agency Deposit, Regular shall be close to Accumulated Surplus/ 
(Deficit) at year-end.  Debiting the Subsidy from National Government and 
Accumulated Surplus/ (Deficit) accounts for such transaction is not in 
consonance with proper accounting/recording. 
 

7.7 Likewise, it has been noted that the College did not recognize in the books the 
constructive receipt of tax revenue.  Instead of debiting the Cash-Tax Remittance 
Advice account for constructive receipts of NCA for TRA and crediting for 
constructive remittances of taxes to BIR through TRA, the College directly debits 
the Account Due to BIR and credits Subsidy from National Government.  Total 
TRAs received and remitted to BIR from January to December 2020 amounted 
to ₱15.981 million. These constructive receipts of NCAs for TRA and remittances 
of taxes thru TRA were not included in the SCF. 

 
7.8 The Revised Chart of Accounts, GAM Volume III and the provisions of GAM 

Volume I are prescribed to facilitate proper recognition of financial transactions 
in the books of accounts and preclude misuse of accounts to ensure that 
balances presented in the FS are true and correct. 

 
Recommendations 
 

7.9 We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 
a. Instruct the Accounting Unit to: 

 
i. Properly use the accounts Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposits accounts in 

the books to recognize remittance of collections to BTr; 
 



45 
 

ii. Recognize the constructive receipt and remittance of NCA for TRA in the 
book of accounts; and, 

 
b. Strictly conform to the above-stated provisions of GAM for revenue and 

other receipts for proper recognition/accounting of transactions of the 
College. 

 
COMPLIANCE AUDIT   
 
Reversion of Notice of Cash Allocation - ₱2.85 million 
 
8. The College failed to maximize the utilization of its cash allocation as 

programmed in their Monthly Disbursement Program (MDP) resulting in the 
reversion of ₱2.853 million to the BTr for CY 2020. 
 
8.1 Department of Budget and Management (DBM) National Budget Circular No. 

578 dated January 6, 2020 provides guidelines on the release of funds for FY 
2020 which requires, among others, the following: 
 

3.6.2 Release of funds, i.e., Obligational Authority and 
Disbursement Authority shall be in accordance with the targets set 
forth under the DBM-evaluated Budget Execution Documents 
(BEDs) for FY 2020 prepared and submitted by agencies/OU 
through the Unified Reporting System (URS) pursuant to DBM 
Circular Letter (CL) Nos. 2016-9, 2017-12, and 2019- 13. 

 
3.6.3 The Monthly Disbursement Program (MDP) or BED No. 3 
shall serve as basis for the DBM's release of disbursement 
authorities including the comprehensive Notice of Cash Allocation 
(NCA)…xxx. 

 
8.2 Moreover, DBM Circular Letter No. 2019-3 dated January 4, 2019 which 

provides procedures covering the crediting and validity of NCA effective first 
quarter of FY 2019 and onwards specifies in Section 2.1 that, “All NCA releases 
for Regular MDS Sub-Accounts, to be credited for any month, whether part of 
the comprehensive releases or constituting additional NCA releases, shall 
continue to be valid until the last working day of the 3rd month of the quarter 
covered.” 
 

8.3 On the other hand, GAM, Volume I state, among others, that: 
 

Section 3. Notice of Cash Allocation. The NCA shall be the authority of an 
agency to pay operating expenses, purchases of supplies and materials, 
acquisition of PPE, AP, and other authorized disbursements through the issue 
of MDS checks, ADA or other modes of disbursements. 
 

a. “Xxx… 
 

b. Xxx…The NCA shall be monitored through the maintenance of the 
Registry of Allotments and Notice of Cash Allocation (RANCA) 
(Appendix 30) by the Accounting Division/Unit”. 

 
8.4 The College received a total cash allocation of ₱219.774 million for CY 2020, 

expended ₱ 216.921 million and reverted a total amount of ₱2.853 million to the 
BTr as shown in the following table:

TOTAL ₱219,774,000.00 ₱216,921,323.74 ₱2,852,676.26 

 
8.5 According to Management, the lapsed 3rd quarter NCA was supposed to be for 

payment of an on-going project but the College did not receive any billing from 
the contractor while the reverted NCA for the 4th quarter was due to the double 
preparation of check that was not immediately cancelled which the Cashier 
discovered at a later date. Management further disclosed that they do monitor 
the quarterly status of the NCA consequently, we requested for the RANCA, the 
said registry has not been prepared as required in Section 3.b of GAM Volume I. 
This Registry would have afforded timely and easy monitoring of allotments, 
NCAs and balances. 

 
8.6 While a total of ₱2.853 million was reverted to the BTr during the year, the Aging 

of Due and Demandable Obligations as of December 31, 2020 (FAR No. 3), 
showed that Management still has unpaid obligations of ₱7.107 million, 
summarized per expense class as follows:

8.7 Records show that as of December 31, 2020, the outstanding obligations of the 

College represent replenishment of petty cash fund, claims of employees and 
suppliers/contractors for various expenses such as salaries and wages, loyalty 
pay, training expenses, office supplies, billing of contractors, among others, 
which remained unpaid at the end of the year due to insufficient documentation 
and error in the Cashier’s available NCA balance. 

 
8.8 The same obligations could have been reduced or fully paid had the 

Management effectively managed the balances of cash allocations received and 
corresponding disbursements made. 

 
8.9 The reverted amount of ₱2.853 million implies that the College had not 

maximized the utilization of its cash allocation as programmed in their MDP or 
BED No. 3 during the year. 



47 
 

Recommendations 
 

8.10 We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 
a. Have an effective and efficient cash management so as to optimize the 

utilization of cash allocation taking into consideration valid and due 
obligations; 
 

b. Direct the Budget, Accounting and Cashier Offices to take concerted effort in 
informing other offices/departments of the available cash allocations to fast-
track the processing of the claims supported with complete documents as 
programmed in the MDPso that the funds received are fully utilized as 
intended and reversion are minimized; and, 
 

c. Require the Accounting Unit to prepare and maintain the RANCA for proper 
monitoring of the available NCA and amount of allotments not covered by 
NCA. 

 
Payment of Overtime Services Contrary to CSC and DBM JC No. 1, series of 2015 
 
9. Payment of Overtime Services of the Administrative Aide III/Driver I during the 

period of Community Quarantine from March 23 to May 31, 2020 is contrary to 
the provisions of Civil Service Commission (CSC) and the DBM Joint Circular 
(JC) No. 1, series of 2015. 
 
9.1 CSC-DBM JC No. 1, s. 2015 dated November 25, 2015 which governs the 

policies and guidelines on overtime services and overtime pay for government 
employees states, among others, the following: 

 
“Section 3.2 As a general rule, the remuneration for overtime 
services shall be through Compensatory Time-Off (CTO), in 
accordance with the guidelines under the CSC-DBM JCs no. 2, s. 
2004 and 2-A, s. 2005; 

 
Section 3.3 The payment in cash of overtime services through 
Overtime Pay may be authorized only in exceptional cases when 
the application of CTO for all overtime hours would adversely affect 
the operations of the agency. 

 
Section 13 Agency Heads shall: 

 
13.1 Formulate and adopt internal rules and procedures on the 
rendition of overtime services of their respective personnel 
which shall be circumscribed within the policies and guidelines 
under this JC.  Copies of these internal rules and regulations 
shall be submitted to the DBM and CSC. 
 
13.2 Approve requests for authority to render overtime services 
indicating the names of personnel, the purpose or expected 
outputs, and the specific period of such services.” 

 
9.2 Audit of the disbursement voucher for the payment of overtime services of the 

Admin. Aide III/Driver I, showed that the College issued an inter-office 
memorandum to him dated March 23, 2020 for the adoption of flexible working 
hours during the community quarantine as his alternative work arrangement, 



48 
 

pursuant to CSC memorandum no. 25, s. 2019.  In the exigency of his service as 
a driver of the College, he was advised to pick-up and drop-off the skeletal 
workforce employees along with the employees for mass production of face 
masks and face shields since March 23, 2020. In line with this, he is entitled to 
overtime pay as well as hazard pay during the Enhanced Community Quarantine. 
 

9.3 In the course of our audit, we noted that the payment of overtime services was 
not supported with approved request for authority to render overtime services 
indicating the name of personnel, the purpose or expected outputs and the 
specific period of such services. 

 
9.4 Additionally, review of the daily time record (DTR) revealed that there are time 

differences/gaps between the time-in and time-out in the DTR and the Departure 
Time and Arrival Time of Vehicle as long as 4 hours and 39 minutes. 
 

9.5 Moreover, inquiry with the Supervising Administrative Officer disclosed that the 
College has no internal rules and procedures, of its own, on the rendition of 
overtime services instead they abide with the rules and regulations related 
thereto. 
 

9.6 The absence of authority to render overtime services and the lack of internal 
rules and procedures on overtime services adopted by ZCSPC is not in keeping 
with CSC-DBM JC No. 1, s. 2015 dated November 25, 2015. 

 
Recommendations 
 

9.7 We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 

a. Formulate and adopt internal rules and procedures on the rendition of 
overtime services of their respective personnel in accordance with CSC-
DBM JC No. 1, s. 2015 dated November 25, 2015; 
 

b. Ensure that approved requests for authority to render overtime services by 
employees are obtained first from the Agency Head (indicating the names 
of personnel, the purpose or expected outputs, and the specific periods of 
such services) prior to rendering overtime services; and, 
 

c. Apply the remuneration for overtime services through CTO, except in cases 
when it would adversely affect the operations of the agency. 

 
Insurable properties not adequately covered with property insurance 
 
10. Insurable properties with net book value of ₱159.111 million are not adequately 

covered with property insurance with the General Insurance Fund (GIF) of the 
Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) contrary to Republic Act (RA) No. 
656, as amended by PD 245 and COA Circular 2018-002 dated May 31, 2018. 
 
10.1 Section 5 of RA No. 656, otherwise known as the Property Insurance Law, as 

amended by PD No. 245, states, among others, that: 
 

“Every government, except a municipal government below first class, is 
hereby required to insure its properties, with the Fund against any insurable 
risk herein provided and pay the premiums thereon, which, however, shall 
not exceed the premiums charged by private insurance companies: …xxx.” 

 



49 
 

10.2 Additionally, COA Circular 2018-002 dated May 31, 2018 was issued to assist 
in the implementation of the provisions of RA 656, as amended, on the 
insurance and bonding of risks on insurable government assets and properties 
with the GIF. Section 5.1 (b to c) of this circular provides the following: 
 
b. Prepare the Property Inventory Form (PIF) listing of all the insurable 

properties and other assets, …xxx; 
 

c. Extract from the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and 
Equipment, as well as from the Report on the Physical Count of Inventories, 
prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Government Accounting 
Manual, the data for the PIF pertaining to the insurable assets and interest 
of the government (excluding impaired properties for disposal); 

 
10.3 Property as defined in Section 4.1 of the same COA Circular includes vessels 

and craft, motor vehicles, machineries, permanent buildings, properties stored 
therein (i.e. furniture, fixtures, equipment, supplies and materials, etc.) or in 
buildings rented by the government, or in transit, the ownership of which had 
already passed to the government.” 
 

10.4 Accounting records showed that as of December 31, 2020, properties and 
equipment acquired by the College have a net book value of ₱159.111 million, 
broken down as follows 

 

Buildings & Other Structures ₱   80,393,675.63  

Machinery and Other Equipment 65,989,473.76  

Transportation Equipment 4,545,871.50  

Furniture, Fixtures & Books 809,400.48  

Other Property Plant & Equipment 7,372,202.55  

Total ₱ 159,110,623.92  

 
10.5 Review of the insurance policies and RPCPPE showed that only 24 out of the 34 

buildings reported in the RPCPPE and 4 motor vehicles were insured with the 
GIF of GSIS. Moreover, the computer hardware (simulator) installed at the 
Student Technology Lockers Building is the only building content covered with 
insurance. 
 

10.6 The net book value of the insured property excluding the CIP and 2 buildings 
which the Accounting Unit had difficulty in identifying and was not able to update 
in their records is ₱91.431 million, as shown below: 

 
 Net Book Value 

21 Buildings ₱ 72,638,318.38 
1 Computer Hardware – Simulator 14,246,607.14 
4 Motor Vehicles 4,545,871.5 

Total ₱ 91,430,797.02 

 
10.7 The contents of the building, such as but not limited to, equipment, furniture and 

fixtures, books, machineries, were not insured by the College. Management 
disclosed that they still have to conduct inventory of the building contents. In 
addition, description of some buildings in the insurance policy differs from the 
RPCPPE. Likewise, computer hardware installed at the Student Technology 
Lockers Building were categorized as building instead of building contents or 
equipment. 



50 
 

10.8 Government agencies are required by law, under RA No. 656, to insure all 
properties, assets and interests of their respective offices with GSIS.  The non-
compliance with this requirement, denies the government adequate and reliable 
protection against any damage to or loss of its properties or assets and interests 
due to fortuitous events/casualty. 
 

Recommendations 
 

10.9 We recommended that Management: 
 
a. Conduct inventory of all its insurable properties and submit the list to the 

GSIS using the Property Inventory Form, for evaluation/appraisal of the 
property insurance coverage; 
 

b. Insure all insurable properties with the GIF of the GSIS in compliance with 
the provisions stated above; and, 
 

c. Ensure that insured properties are properly categorized and have the same 
description in the insurance policy and PIF/RPCPPE/RPCI for easy 
identification/verification. 

 
Management Comment 

 
10.10 Management commented that the OPIA/Supply Office is gradually conducting 

the physical count of different buildings, it was just relaxed since the pandemic 
started but the office will warrant to increase the velocity in the inventory to 
ascertain the insurable properties. The office warrants to fast track all insurable 
properties in compliance to the required law under RA 656. Management will 
guarantee that the list of buildings in the RCPPE therein is in consonance with 
the buildings listed in the insured buildings in the GSIS policy including the 
buildings not in the RPCPPE or submit an updated name of buildings to GSIS. 
However, the adjustments will take effect on the FY 2021 reports. 

 
Utilization of Tuition Fees Not in Accordance with CHED Memorandum Order No. 20, 
series of 2011 
 

11. The prescribed allocation percentages on the utilization of tuition fees per CHED 
Memorandum Order No. 20, series of 2011 were not adhered to. Consequently, 
allocation and payment of services rendered by visiting lecturers exceeded the 
limit set under the memorandum by ₱16.035 million or 374.93 per cent. 

 
11.1 CHED Memorandum Order (CMO) No. 20, series of 2011 seeks to establish 

and institutionalize uniform fiscal policies that will serve as guidelines in the use 
and disposition of internally generated funds accruing to the State 
University/College (SUC), as well as to integrate a system of accountability for 
all fund administrators.  The policy and guidelines shall be observed by the SUC 
for all receipts and collections accruing to the general income for use in 
operations, fiduciary funds, income generating or self-liquidating operations or 
activities, and regular trust funds. 
 

11.2 Article III of the CMO for the Specific Budgetary Allocation is summarized next

11.3 Relevant specific provisions are as follows: 
 

11.3.1 “Curriculum Development (12.5% of Tuition Fees) – Budget Allocation 
shall be used for honoraria of part time faculty members (with duly 
approved contract of employment), subscription to journals (trade 
journals), books, reviewers, reproduction of instruction materials, shop 
tools and other instructional equipment educational field trip assistance, 
industry immersion, seminar workshops and curriculum review and 
development, and such other maintenance and operating expenses as 
may be deemed directly and indirectly related and necessary to 
accomplish delivery of curricular requirements.”  (Sec 6, item b, CMO 
No. 20) 
 

11.3.2 “Limitation on adjustment or modification of percentage allocation for 
instruction.  The above percentages assigned to the components of 
instruction may be adjusted in accordance with the expenditure trends 
established in the preceding year.  However, the adjustment resulting to 
reduction in the allocation of one or more component shall not fall below 
7.5%, in order not to unduly curtail developmental goals and regular 
operations therein.”  (Sec 7, CMO No. 20) 
 

11.3.3 “Mandatory Reserve (10% of tuition fees) – A budget allocation of 10% 
for Mandatory Reserve shall be made by the SUC main campus, satellite 
branches or external campuses as contingency fund for any unexpected 
event which may adversely affect the institution and its operations.”  (Sec 
16, CMO No. 20) 
 

11.3.4 “Projects or object of expenditures that may be financed by resorting to 
the scheme using the mandatory reserve shall include emergency 
construction of structures destroyed by natural or man-made calamities.  
This is a provision made in response to emergency circumstance beyond 
the control of the SUC or campus administrators.”  (Sec 17, CMO No. 
20)

Total Obligations 19,221.00 

Total Obligations in excess of appropriations ₱   (2,721.00) 

 
11.6 A significant amount equal to ₱16.500 million or 48.22 per cent of the total 

projected receipts/collections of Tuition Fees for the year is allocated for 
Professional Services, payment of services rendered by Visiting Lecturers.  
However, total appropriation and obligation for Professional Services amounted 
to ₱20.312 million and ₱19.221 million, respectively, which exceeds the total 
appropriation and the prescribed allocation per CMO No. 2020 amounting to 
₱16.035 million and ₱15.239 million, respectively. 

 
11.7 Moreover, we noted that the unexpended balance reflected in the PRE only 

amounted to ₱1.590 million or 4.65 per cent of the projected total receipts for 
FY 2020, which is less than the prescribed 10 per cent mandatory reserve. 

 
11.8 With the budget limitation the expenditure trend on Professional Services, it 

appears that there is a need to review the fund establishment in accordance 
with the Specific Budgetary Allocation per CMO No. 20, s. 2011 in order not to 
unduly curtail developmental goals and regular operations therein, and to 
ensure the accomplishment of the College’s mandate. 

 
Recommendation 
 

11.9 We recommended that Management: 
 

a. Formulate an internal procedure/s and process flows to implement the 
provisions in the CMO N0. 20, series of 2011, which shall be modified 
periodically in compliance with rules and regulations that may be passed 
by other concerned national government agencies from time to time; 
 

b. Require the Budget Unit of the College to submit budget proposals for the 
use of income to the Board of Trustees following the prescribed Specific 
Budgetary Allocation on the utilization of Tuition Fees per CMO No. 20, 
series of 2011; 
 

c. Strictly allocate 10 per cent of the total Tuition Fees for Mandatory Reserve 
for any unexpected event which may adversely affect the College and its 
operations; and 
 



54 
 

d. Require the Office of the Board Secretary to furnish a copy of the BOT 
approved budget to the COA Audit Team and to the DBM and attach thereto 
the excerpt of minutes of the board meeting and the Board Resolution with 
control number thereon for reference of the users of the budget document. 

 
11.10  We also recommended that the Board approve budgetary appropriations under 

the STF with due consideration on the Tuition Fees allocation as mandated in 
CMO No. 20, series of 2011, to ensure that Management spending shall be 
delimited by authorized appropriations falling within thresholds set by 
regulations. 

 
Management Comment 
 

11.11 Management commented as follows: 
 
11.11.1 This has actually been a continuing challenge since the time the 

President assumed office in this Institution. Management did try their 
very best to strictly conform with CHED Order No. 20, s 2011. 
However, as much as they want to, there are circumstances beyond 
their control that hinder them from strictly complying with the order. 
The student population has been continually increasing every 
semester but the plantilla items for Instructor I position remain the 
same. The increase in enrolment with no corresponding increase for 
plantilla item positions forced them to hire Visiting Lecturers. Ideally, 
they should only allocate 12.5 per cent for Curriculum Development 
which includes the payment of honoraria for part time faculty 
members. But due to the number of teachers needed to meet the 
desirable student to teacher ratio, the College is constrained to hire 
additional Visiting Lecturers the salary payment of which consumes 
more than the 12,5 per cent percentage allocation. As a result, the 
mandatory reserve of 10 per cent is likewise affected with this budget 
constraint. 

11.11.2 Management have taken several actions to resolve this matter but the 
success of these actions also depend upon the approval of the DBM. 
Every year, the budget proposal constantly includes an allocation for 
222 Instructor I items with the hope that, if approved, finally this 
problem will be solve. However, every year, this proposal is also 
always disapproved. This number (222 Instructors I) is based on the 
data given by DBM stating that this is the number of additional 
teachers the school needs in order to meet their growing population. 

11.11.3 Management have also sought other channel to remedy this problem. 
About more than a year ago, they were able to secure from PASUC 
10 Instructor I items. However, this number is not significant enough 
to effect and solve the problem. Management is continually seeking 
for means to solve this matter. Now that the school has recently been 
approved and converted into a University, they are of high hopes that 
the Instructor I Plantilla items will be increased. 

11.11.4 In the meantime, Management will comply with the recommendations 
as best as they can and within the limits of the circumstance. 
Management hope for understanding regarding this matter. 

 
Absence of Gender Analysis and Sex-Disaggregated Data (SDD) 
 



55 
 

12. The College did not conduct Gender Analysis, nor did it maintain its own SDD in 
identifying Gender Issues and formulating its Gender and Development (GAD) 
Plans, Programs and Budget which is not in conformity with Section 36(c) of RA 
No. 9710 and Section 37.A.1.a of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) 
of the same Act. 

 
12.1 Section 36 (c) of RA No. 9710 or the Magna Carta for Women (MCW) provides 

that: 
 

“All departments, including their attached agencies, offices, 
bureaus-state universities and colleges, government-owned and –
controlled corporations, local government units, and other 
government instrumentalities shall develop and maintain a GAD 
database containing gender statistics and sex-disaggregated date 
that have been systematically gathered, regularly updated, and 
subjected to gender analysis for planning, programming, and policy 
formulation.” 
 

12.2 Moreover, Section 37 A.1.a of the IRR of the same RA provides that: 
 

“Following the conduct of a gender audit, gender analysis, and/or 
review of sex-disaggregated data, each agency or LGU shall 
develop its GAD Plans, Programs, and Budget in response to the 
gender gaps or issues faced by their women and men employees, 
as well as their clients and constituencies. Along with the Act and 
these Rules and Regulations, the Philippine Plan for Gender-
Responsive Development (PPGD), the Beijing Platform for Action 
(BPfA), and the CEDAW, among others, shall serve as key 
documents to guide the identification of gender issues and the 
formulation of GAD Plans, Programs and Budget.” 
 

12.3 Additionally, Section 5 or the Declaration of Policy of the same IRR states that: 
 

“Recognizing that economic, political, and sociocultural realities 
affect women's current condition, the State affirms the role of 
women in nation building and ensures the substantive equality of 
women and men. It shall promote empowerment of women, pursue 
equal opportunities for women and men, and ensure equal access 
to resources and to development results and outcome. Further, the 
State realizes that equality of men and women entails the abolition 
of the unequal structures and practices that perpetuate 
discrimination and inequality. To realize this, the State shall 
endeavor to develop plans, policies, programs, measures, and 
mechanisms to address discrimination and inequality in the 
economic, political, civil, social, and cultural life of women and men.” 

 
12.4 Lastly, Section 3.2 of PCW Memorandum Circular No. 2011-01 defines Gender 

Analysis as follows: 
 

“refers to a framework to compare the relative advantages and 
disadvantages faced by women and men in various spheres of life, 
including the family, workplace, school, community and political 
system. It also takes into account how class, age, race, ethnicity, 
culture, social and other factors interact with gender to produce 
discriminatory results;”

12.5 For CY 2020, GAD related programs/activities implemented by the College 

amounted to ₱2.735 million or only 1.45 per cent of its total budget 
appropriations. The Focal Point Person disclosed that they were not able to fully 
accomplish the activities per their GAD Plan and Budget due to the pandemic. 
The GAD Programs, Activities and Projects (PAPs) as reported in the CY 2020

The College through the research and extension 
office conducted series of short trainings 

Capacity building on 
gender sensitivity, 
gender-based violence 
and GAD 

Continuing gender-sensitivity seminars, trainings 
and other activities: 

 National Women’s Month 

 Webinars on Psychological Safety in the 
workplace 

 
12.6 In addition, the GAD Focal Person provided SDD but it pertains to the number 

of male and female participants to the GAD Activities. She also disclosed that 



57 
 

the number of male and female students/enrollees can be obtained at the Office 
of the Registrar. 

12.7 Although the activities were related to GAD, these activities were not 
implemented as a result of Gender Analysis and the maintenance of SDD. 

 
12.8 It must also be noted that SDD should pertain to data regarding the agency’s 

employees (Organization-Focused) and clients (Client-Focused). Although the 
data given is technically “Sex-Disaggregated”, it lacks data necessary for the 
identification of gender issues and ultimately the formulation of GAD Plans, 
Programs and Budget. 

 
12.9 The above-mentioned provisions in the MCW and its IRR emphasize the 

importance of SDD in the identification of gender issues and the formulation of 
GAD Plans, Programs and Budget. As such, the College’s SDD should not just 
be a simple statistic of males and females but must include data regarding the 
following, among others: 

 
1. Families and Households 
2. Employment and Livelihood 
3. Education 
4. Health 

 
12.10 Absence of these data in the agency’s SDD will result in unrealistic and 

unresponsive   gender issues necessary in the formulation of GAD Plans, 
Programs and Budget and ultimately, in addressing discrimination and 
inequality in the economic, political, civil, social and cultural life of women and 
men. 

 
Recommendation 
 

12.11 We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 

a. Collect SDD regarding Families and Households, Employment and 
Livelihood, Education and Health thru sending out questionnaires to its 
employees and students via pen and paper questionnaires or through 
online surveys/questionnaires like Google Forms and Survey Monkey; and, 

 
b. Collate the above-mentioned SDD, regularly update and maintain it at the 

College’s GAD database and use them in analyzing and identifying gender 
issues in the formulation of GAD Plans, Programs and Budget.
