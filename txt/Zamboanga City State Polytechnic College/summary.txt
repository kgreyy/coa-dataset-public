EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 

 
Introduction 
 
The Zamboanga City State Polytechnic College (ZCSPC) found its beginning from a small 
workshop classroom of the Zamboanga Central School in July 1905.  In 1937, by virtue of 
Commonwealth Act No. 39, it became Zamboanga City Trade School which offered 
secondary curriculum.  In 1959, it became a national school under the name of Zamboanga 
School of Arts and Trade (ZSAT) by virtue of Republic Act (RA) No. 2300.  Three years 
later, RA 3286 authorized the school to offer a degree program, a four-year Teacher 
Education Curriculum leading to the degree of Bachelor of Science in Industrial Education 
with different major fields of specialization.  In 1992, the ZSAT was converted into the 
Zamboanga City Polytechnic College (ZCPC) under the supervision of the Commission on 
Higher Education (CHED).  In July 20, 2001, pursuant to RA 9142, the ZCPC became a 
state college and its name was changed to ZCSPC. 
 
The ZCSPC is a government educational institution governed by RA 8292, otherwise 
known as the “Higher Education Modernization Act of 1997”, and its implementing rules 
and regulations contained in CHED Memorandum Circular No. 4, series of 1997. 
 
The governance of ZCSPC rests on its Board of Trustees, composed of the Chairman and 
ten members, by virtue of RA 8292.  Policies are laid down by the Board and the 
observance and administration of such are vested in the College President who is assisted 
by two Vice Presidents (VP), namely the VP for Research, Extension and Production and 
VP for Administration and Finance. 
 
The College is mandated to provide advanced instruction and professional training in 
science and technology and other related fields, undertake research and extension 
services, and provide progressive leadership in these areas. 
 
For 2020, the ZCSPC has a total workforce of 517 consisting of 211 permanent 
employees, 180 instructors under contract of service, 4 casuals and 122 job order 
personnel. 
 
 
Audit Objective 
 
The audit was primarily aimed at ascertaining the reliability of the financial reports and the 
adequacy of the books of accounts in order to express an opinion on the fairness of 
presentation of the financial statements (FS).  It also aimed to ascertain the propriety of 
the financial transactions and compliance of the agency to prescribed laws, rules and 
regulations 
 
 
Audit Methodology 
 
The audit was conducted as a result of the risk assessment made and in compliance with 

the identified audit thrust of the National Government Sector (NGS) including State 

Universities and Colleges (SUCs).

Independent Auditor’s Report on the FS 
 
We rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the FS of ZCSPC for 
the year then ended December 31, 2020, taking exception on the effects of the following: 
 
1. The reported balance as of December 31, 2020 of Assets and Liabilities is understated

overstated by ₱2.483 million, as presented below:

2. Various deficiencies discussed below were noted in the keeping of accounts that   
have significant impact on Management’s assertion on accuracy, completeness and 
existence of the reported account balances thus, affecting the fair presentation of the 
accounts in the FS.   

 
a. Unreconciled/unadjusted variance of ₱1.410 million between the balances 

reported in the FS and in the Report of Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI). 
 
b. Physical count of inventory was not conducted by Management and Supplies 

Ledger Cards (SLCs) were not maintained by the Accounting Unit hence, proper 
control on the management of inventory is not adequately provided. 

 
c. The year-end balance of Property Plant and Equipment (PPE) amounting to 

₱255.93 million could not be relied upon due to unreconciled variance 
amounting to ₱27.425 million between the balances reported in the FS and in 
the Report of Physical Count of PPE. 

 
Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations 
 
In addition to the above-noted deficiencies, below are the significant audit observations 

and recommendations noted in the course of the audit:  

1. The College failed to maximize the utilization of its cash allocation as programmed in 
their Monthly Disbursement Program (MDP) resulting in the reversion of ₱2.853 
million to the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) for CY 2020. 

 
 We recommended that Management improve its cash management so as to optimize 

the utilization of cash allocation taking into consideration valid and due obligations; 
direct the Budget, Accounting and Cashier Offices to take concerted effort in 
informing other offices/departments of the available cash allocations to fast-track the 
processing of the claims supported with complete documents as programmed in the 



iv 
 

MDP so that the funds received are fully utilized as intended and reversion are 
minimized; and, require the Accounting Unit to prepare and maintain the Registry of 
Allotments and Notices of Cash Allocation (RANCA) for proper monitoring of the 
available Notice/s of Cash Allocation (NCA) and amount of allotments not covered 
by NCA. 

 
2. Insurable properties with net book value of ₱159.111 million are not adequately 

covered with property insurance with the General Insurance Fund (GIF) of the 
Government Service Insurance System (GSIS), contrary to RA 656, as amended by 
Presidential Decree (PD) No. 245 and COA Circular No. 2018-002 dated May 31, 
2018. 
 
We recommended that Management conduct inventory of all its insurable properties 
and submit the list to the GSIS using the Property Inventory Form (PIF), for evaluation/ 
appraisal of the property insurance coverage; insure all insurable properties with the 
GIF of the GSIS in compliance with the provisions stated above; and, ensure that 
insured properties are properly categorized and have the same description in the 
insurance policy and PIF/RPCPPE/RPCI for easy identification/ verification. 
 

3. The prescribed allocation percentages on the utilization of tuition fees per CHED 
Memorandum Order (CMO) No. 20, series of 2011 were not adhered to.  
Consequently, allocation and payment of services rendered by visiting lecturers 
exceeded the limit set under the memorandum by ₱17.08 million, or 798%. 
 
We recommended that Management formulate internal procedures and process flows 
to implement the provisions of CMO N0. 20, s. of 2011, which shall be modified 
periodically in compliance with rules and regulations that may be passed by other 
concerned national government agencies from time to time; require the Budget Unit 
of the College to submit budget proposals for the use of income to the Board of 
Trustees (BOT) following the prescribed Specific Budgetary Allocation on the 
utilization of Tuition Fees per CMO No. 20, s. of 2011; strictly allocate 10 per cent of 
the total Tuition Fees for Mandatory Reserve for any unexpected event which may 
adversely affect the College and its operations; and require the Office of the Board 
Secretary to furnish a copy of the BOT approved budget to the COA Audit Team and 
to the Department of Budget and Management (DBM), and attach thereto the excerpt 
of minutes of the board meeting and the Board Resolution with control number thereon 
for reference of the users of the budget document. 
 
We also recommended that the Board approve budgetary appropriations under the 
Special Trust Fund  with due consideration on the Tuition Fees allocation as mandated 
in CMO No. 20, s. of 2011, to ensure that Management spending shall be delimited 
by authorized appropriations falling within thresholds set by regulations. 
 

4. The College did not conduct Gender Analysis, nor did it maintain its own Sex-
Disaggregated Data (SDD) in identifying Gender Issues and formulating its Gender 
and Development (GAD) Plans, Programs and Budget which is not in conformity with 
Section 36(c) of RA 9710 and Section 37.A.1.a of the Implementing Rules and 
Regulations of the same Act. 

 
We recommended that Management collect SDD regarding Families and Households, 
Employment and Livelihood, Education and Health thru sending out questionnaires to 
its employees and students via pen and paper questionnaires, or through online 
surveys/ questionnaires like Google Forms and Survey Monkey; and, collate the 
above-mentioned SDD, regularly update and maintain it at the College’s GAD 



v 
 

database and use them in analyzing and identifying gender issues in the formulation 
of GAD Plans, Programs and Budget.
