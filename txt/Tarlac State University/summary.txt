EXECUTIVE SUMMARY



A)	Introduction



The Tarlac State University (TSU) is a chartered state university with more than 100 years of educational service to the people of Tarlac and the Central Luzon Region.  It started as an elementary trade school in 1906.  It became a secondary school in 1919 and progressed into a collegiate technical school, the Tarlac School of Arts and Trades, in 1959.  In the year 1965, it was converted into a full-fledged college, Tarlac College of Technology (TCT), through the passage of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 4337, merging it with the Tarlac National Agricultural School in Camiling, Tarlac.  With the passage of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 609 in 1974, TCT was separated from its agricultural component, which became the Tarlac College of Agriculture in Camiling, Tarlac.  TCT was converted into a university, Tarlac State University, on October 13, 1989 by virtue of R.A. No. 6764.



The TSU is committed to continually strive for global competitiveness and excellence in the delivery of education, research, extension, training and consultancy services, hotel operation and administrative support services, compliant to regulatory and statutory requirements for the utmost satisfaction of its valued customers.

E)	Summary of Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations



Summarized below are the significant audit observations with their recommendations, the details of which are presented in Part II of this report. Management views and comments were incorporated in the report, where appropriate.  



1)	The procedures in the disbursement, recording and reporting of the Petty Cash Fund (PCF) were not properly observed inconsistent with Section 35 of Chapter 6 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I and Appendix 48, Volume II of the same Manual, resulting in the improper use of the PCF in the payment of Fund 01 payables amounting to ₱153,895.94 and the use of the Fund for the defrayment of regular operating expenses of ₱30,350.60. Moreover, in the absence of necessary check marks in Boxes C and D on the Petty Cash Vouchers (PCVs), the responsibility and accountability of the requesting personnel/certifying officers were not established posing the risk of misuse of University Funds. (Observation No. 1)  	

We recommended and management agreed to undertake the following courses of action: (a) stop the practice of using the PCF in paying Fund 01 payables for the withheld employees’ healthcare and association’s contributions; (b) ensure that disbursements are directly made under Fund 01 to avoid the circuitous recording of financial transactions, since intra-fund transfers are not eligible for payment out of the PCF; (c) stop the practice of using the PCF in paying mandatory obligations and/or regular operating expenses. Bear in mind that the PCF is maintained for payment of authorized petty or miscellaneous expenses which cannot be conveniently paid through checks/LDDAP-ADA; (d) substantiate all disbursement claims, though petty in nature, with the required documentation; (e) observe the proper use and accomplishment of the PCF Voucher as directed in the Instructions of Appendix 48, GAM for NGAs, Volume II to identify responsibility and accountability on the use of the Fund; and (f) strictly follow the procedures in the utilization and liquidation of PCF as provided under Section 35, Chapter 6 of the same Manual, Volume I.



2)	The validity and collectability of some items included under Accounts Receivable  amounting to ₱7,344,551.61  were doubtful due to (i) lack of supporting documents to prove the balance of ₱3,227,950.95  in the subsidiary records; (ii) failure of the University personnel concerned to exhaust available remedies to collect long outstanding student loans of  ₱782,300.00 and unpaid student tuition fees of ₱3,334,300.66; and (iii) failure of management  to file request for authority to write-off dormant receivables contrary  to COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016, depriving the University of the funds for its operation and affecting the fair presentation of the accounts in the financial statements. (Observation No. 2)



We recommended and  Management agreed to undertake the following courses of action: (a) direct the Chief of Finance to (i) ensure that the recorded receivables are substantiated by valid and complete documents to prove their existence and propriety; (ii) conduct regular and periodic verification, analysis, and validation of receivables to determine the debtors concerned; and (iii) monitor past due/dormant accounts for appropriate write off supported with the required documents under Item 8.3 of COA Circular No. 2016-005; (b) require the personnel in charge of collecting the STUFAP loan to exhaust all possible remedies in collecting the receivables, both active and inactive accounts, in order to raise more funds to assist the needy but deserving students who are financially challenged; (c) re-assess the University’s provision for impairment based on current and historical data and in accordance with the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSASs); and (d) pursue the filing of request from the Commission on Audit for write-off  of dormant receivable accounts, supported with the required documents enumerated in Item 8.0, supra, thru the Office of the Audit Team Leader and/or Supervising Auditor.



3)	The reliability of the year-end balance of the  Property, Plant and Equipment accounts remained doubtful because of the (a) misclassification of PPE accounts; (b) inclusion of missing/unlocated items of ₱782,795.99; (c) non-derecognition of already demolished structures and unserviceable motor vehicles of ₱1,162,024.20; and (d) unrecorded buildings and equipment found in station inconsistent with Section 111 of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1445 and Section 38, Chapter 10 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I. (Observation No. 3)



We recommended that Management take the following courses of action: (a) direct the Chief of Finance and the Inventory Team to discuss the deficiencies noted and take the necessary steps to segregate the PPE by fund cluster and reclassify the misclassified PPE based on the account descriptions under the Revised Chart of Accounts, GAM for NGAs, Volume III, as amended;  (b) require the Head of the SPMU to inform all accountable officers with missing property accountabilities following the procedures provided under Item 7 of the COA Circular No. 2020-006 dated January 31, 2020;  (c) Require the Chief of Finance to observe the procedures in Items 7, 8 and 9 of the same COA Circular for the disposition and derecognition of non-existing/missing PPEs and the required accounting entries and disclosures in the financial statements; and (d) take the initiative to implement COA Circular No. 2020-006 which is the authority given by the Commission on Audit for a one-time cleansing of PPE accounts of government agencies to establish PPE balances that are verifiable as to existence, condition, and accountability.



4)	The accuracy and correctness of the balances of the Inventories accounts  amounting to ₱20,038,386.38 as at year-end were uncertain due to (a) inconsistent classification of inventory items; (b) overstatement of the account balance by ₱368,694.05 due to unadjusted recording errors; and (c) the inclusion of expired, defective, damaged and idle or non-moving items  no longer needed in the operation of the University, resulting to inaccurate and misleading inventory data and information inconsistent with Section 111 of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1445. (Observation No. 4)



We recommended and Management agreed to implement the following courses of action: (a) direct the Supply Officer and the Chief of Finance to (i) strictly use and maintain the inventory account names prescribed under COA Circular No. 2020-001 in recording and reporting received and issued inventories; (ii) refrain from using different inventory accounts for items with the same description.  If necessary, personnel in charge of recording inventory in the Accounting and Supply Units regularly check the consistent use of inventory accounts to prevent misleading balances and information; and (iii) make the necessary adjustment in the inventory accounts that were misclassified; (b)  direct the Chief of Finance and the accounting personnel concerned to (i) check the mathematical accuracy of the weighted moving average cost before applying to issued inventories to avoid the accumulation of immaterial amount of miscalculated cost; (ii) draw the corrective entry for unused Hostel inventories amounting to ₱289,178.43 that were already issued and in the hands of the end-users; (iii) refrain from adjusting in the accounting books unused inventories from the different Units, unless a proof that the items have been physically returned to the Supply Officer; (iv) Quantity of inventory on hand per accounting records should be reconciled with the Supply’s inventory record on a quarterly basis in order to immediately check  possible  errors in recording receipts of delivered and accepted items of inventories and undocumented or delayed documentation of issued inventories; (v) adjust all valid recording errors committed; (vi) document and properly dispose of the inventories that are obsolete, expired and deteriorated; and (vii)  furnish the Commission on Audit with copies of the Journal Entry Vouchers (JEVs) drawn to adjust the inventory account balances for audit reference; and (c) instruct the Inventory Committee to conduct the semi-annual physical count of inventories regularly as a measure of check and balance of the receipt and issuance of inventories and facilitate reconciliation of inventory on hand with the inventory records for the early detection of recording errors, unnecessary obsolescence, and expiration of inventories during the accounting period.

 As of year-end, the unsettled disallowances amounted to ₱2,399,839.07. There were no outstanding suspensions and charges.
