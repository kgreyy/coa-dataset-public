OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

 

 

A. Financial Audit 
 

Non-recording of the Inventory issued – P113.597 million 

1. There were unrecorded issued Inventory totaling P113,597,619.48 due to the non-
preparation and monthly submission of the Report of Supplies and Materials 

Issued by the Property and/or Supply Custodian to the Accounting Division as 

basis in preparing the Journal Entry Voucher to record the supplies and 

materials issued, resulting in overstatement of the Inventories and Accumulated 

Surplus accounts by the same amount as at December 31, 2020. 

 

Section 7, Chapter 8 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) Volume I, in 

consonance with Paragraph 43 of IPSAS 12 provides that “when inventories are sold, 

exchanged or distributed, the carrying amount of those inventories shall be 

recognized as an expense in the period in which the related revenue is recognized. If 

there is no related revenue, the expense is recognized when the goods are distributed 

or the related service is rendered.” 

 

Other applicable provisions under Chapter 8, of the GAM, Volume 1 are as 

follows: 

 

Section 13. Inventory Accounting System. The Inventory Accounting System 

consists of the system of monitoring, controlling and recording of acquisition 

and disposal of inventory. Physical count/inventory, which is required semi-

annually, is an indispensable procedure for checking the integrity of property 

custodianship. 

 

Section 17 – Records, Forms and Reports to be prepared and/or maintained.  

The following records, forms and reports are prescribed for use: 

 

a. Stock Card (SC) – shall be used to record all receipts and issues of 
supplies and the balance in quantity at any time. It shall be maintained by the 

Property and/or Supply Division/Unit for each item in stock. 

 

b. Supplies Ledger Card (SLC) – shall be used to record materials received, 
issued and the balance both in quantity and amount at any time.  It shall be 

maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit for each kind of supplies and 

materials. 

 

c. Report of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI)– shall be prepared by 
the Property and/or Supply Custodian based on the Requisition and Issue Slip 



37 

  

and shall be used by the Accounting Division/Unit as basis in preparing the 

Journal Entry Voucher (JEV) to record the supplies and materials issued. 

 

Likewise, Appendix 64 requires that the Accounting Division/Unit and Supply 

and/or Property Division/Unit shall conduct periodic reconciliation of the SLC 

and SC to identify and adjust any discrepancy. 

 

As at December 31, 2020, PDEA had a booked Inventory balance of 

P141,248,104.71, which shows a discrepancy of P113.597,619.48 from the Report on 

the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI), broken down as follows:

Total 141,248,104.71 27,650,485.23  113,597,619.48 

 

Our audit showed that the discrepancy between accounting records and the RPCI 

amounting to P113,597,619.48 is composed of inventories already issued in the prior 

years but still not recorded in the books. The failure of the Accounting Division/Unit 

to record the issuance of the inventory was due to the non-preparation and monthly 

submission of the RSMI by the Property and/or Supply Custodian. 

 



38 

  

In addition, SLC were not regularly prepared/updated by Accounting 

Division/Unit, resulting to difficulty in conducting a periodic reconciliation of the 

SLC and SC to identify and adjust any discrepancy. 

 

The non-recording of the issuance of inventory and non-preparation of the 

required records and reports are contrary to the Section 7, 13 and 17 of the Chapter 8 

of GAM Volume I and Paragraph 43 of IPSAS 12 and thus rendered Inventory 

accounts overstated by P113,597,619.48 with corresponding overstatement of the 

Accumulated Surplus account by the same amount. 
 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the: 

 

(a) Logistics and Administrative Management Services to monitor the 
Property and/or Supply Office the preparation of the RSMI for all 

issued inventory to be submitted to the Accounting division/Unit for 

recording; and 

 

(b) Accounting Division/Unit to: (i) regularly prepare/update the SLC for 
each kind of supplies and materials; and (ii) prepare JEV to adjust the 

unrecorded issuance of inventory upon submission of the required 

documents by the Property and/or Supply Custodian. 

 

 

B. Compliance Audit 
 

Delayed liquidation of cash advances (CAs)   

 

2. The balance of the Advances for Operating Expenses account had accumulated 
to P11,356,694.19 as at year-end due to the delayed liquidation of CAs contrary 

to the1 COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 on the grant, 

utilization and accounting of CAs; thus, making the CA susceptible to loss or 

misuse or theft, while long-kept supporting documents might be misplaced. In 

addition, the practice of waiting for the full utilization of the CA and refund of 

the unused balance to close their accountabilities resulted to the total refunded 

amount of P261,976.25 to the Bureau of the Treasury which reduced the cash 

allocation of the agency. 

 

COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 requires that “the 

Accountable Officer (AO) liquidate his cash advance for Petty Operating Expenses 

and Field Operating Expenses within twenty days after the end of the year; subject to 

replenishment as frequently as necessary during the year.” 

 

Limitations on Cash Advance are provided under Section 89 of PD No. 1445 

which states that “a cash advance shall be reported on and liquidated as soon as the 

purpose for which it was given has been served.  No additional cash advance shall be 



39 

  

allowed to any official or employee unless the previous cash advance give to him is 

first settled or a proper accounting thereof is made.”  

 

Advances for Operating Expenses of the agency were granted to the accountable 

officers with the following timeline of utilization: 

 

Kinds of Advances for OE Estimated Length of Utilization 

MOOE  monthly 

Gas allocation monthly 

Petty cash solely for travel expenses 
As soon as 75 percent was 

disbursed 

Cash advance for specific purpose 
as soon as the purpose for which it 

was given has been served 

 

The amount of allocation for the CAs were estimated based on historical data. 

Under PDEA internal policy, CAs for regular MOOE and Gas should be liquidated on 

5th to – 8th day of the succeeding month, Petty Cash may be liquidated once 75 percent 

was already disbursed and for Cash advance for specific purpose be liquidated as soon 

as the purpose has been served. 

 

For CY 2020, the agency granted 567 cash advances totaling P660,846,975.95 to 

32 AOs of which, at year-end, 53 CAs amounting to P11,356,694.19 granted to 13 AO 

remained unliquidated having delayed at an average of 182 days, as follows:

The delay in the liquidation were caused by delayed implementation of the 

activities; incomplete supporting documents of the payments and existence of huge 

unutilized balances after completion of the activity.  

 

For the year, AOs had refunded a total of P261,976.25 unutilized balances in 

order to close their accountabilities. This refunded amount reduced the available cash 

allocation of the agency having returned to the general fund in the Bureau of the 

Treasury. 

 

The granting of numerous cash advances for specific purposes which piled up the 

cash in the hands of the AOs may also lead to: 

 

 the availability of huge balances at the hand of the AOs is susceptible to 
misuse of funds; 

 difficulty in the safekeeping of cash on hands and supporting documents; 

 CAs cannot be liquidated until all activities are completed; and 

 difficulty in tracking the transactions pertaining to specific cash advance 
 

We reiterated our prior year’s recommendation and Management agreed to 

study the possibility of assigning one AO per region instead of different AO for 

different purposes and maintain the CA on replenishment method of liquidation 

for the regular cash advances. 

 

Management’s study for the possibility of granting one AO per region to maintain 

the CA on replenishment method instead of different AOs for different purposes, 

which was the Audit Team’s recommendation in prior years, is still on-going. In 

preparation, management conducted a workshop attended by different AOs and 

Administrative Officers from the regional offices regarding the liquidation of cash 

advances. 

 



42 

  

 

Dormant Accounts 

 

3. The accuracy and reliability of the year-end balance of the Due from GOCCs 
account amounting to P5,549,046.83 is doubtful due to Management’s failure to 

conduct a periodic verification and analysis of the unliquidated fund transfer 

resulting to its being dormant which remained unsettled and outstanding in the 

books for more than 10 years with no possibility of collection and were not acted 

upon contrary to COA Circular No. 2016-05. 

 

COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016 prescribed guidelines and 

procedures on the write-off of dormant receivable accounts, unliquidated cash 

advances and fund transfer of NGAs, Local Government Units (LGUs) and GOCCs 

with the following applicable provisions: 

 

Item 6.1 - All government entities shall conduct regular monitoring and analysis 

of receivable accounts to ensure that these are collected when these become due 

and demandable…x x X” 

 

Item 7.1 and 7.2 – The Accountant shall conduct regular and periodic 

verification, analysis, and validation of the existence of the receivables, 

unliquidated cash advances, and fund transfers, and determine the concerned 

debtors, accountable officers (Regular and Special Disbursing Officers, 

Collecting Officers, Cashiers) and the source and implementing government 

entities concerned; Reconcile the unliquidated fund transfers between the source 

and implementing government entities, prepare the adjusting entries for the 

reconciling items noted, and require liquidation of the balances; 

 

Item 8.2 and 8.3 - the Head of the Agency shall file the request for authority to 

write-off dormant receivable accounts, unliquidated cash advances, and fund 

transfers and shall be supported by the following documents: 

 

a. Schedule of dormant accounts by accountable officer/debtor/government 
entity and by account, certified by the accountant and approved by the 

Head of the government entity;  

b. Certified relevant documents validating the existence of the conditions, as 
applicable, such as: 

c. Death Certificate issued by Philippine Statistics Authority (formerly 
National Statistics Office) 

d. Proof of Insolvency 
e.   Certification from the Department of Trade and Industry that the debtor has 

no registered business 

f. Certification from the Securities and Exchange Commission that the 
Corporation is no longer active 



43 

  

g. Certificate of no residence in the barangay of the municipality/city of last 
known address 

h. Proof of exhaustion of all remedies to collect the receivables and demand to 
liquidate the cash advances and funds transfer, such as but not limited to 

copies of served or returned demand letters  

i. Certification by Legal Officer of the entity of no pending case relative to 
the account 

j. Certification by the responsible officials of the entity to the effect that there 
are no records/documents available to validate claim 

k. Other justifications, like in the case of request for write off due to loss of 
documents, the circumstances of the loss should be stated in the letter 

request 

    

As of December 31, 2020, the year-end balance of Due from GOCCs accounts 

amounting to P5,549,046.83 is composed of advance payment for the procurement of 

various items from Philippine International Trading Corporation (PITC) which 

remained outstanding for more than 10 years presented as follows:

23/12/2008    1,280,690.30  12 years  

Total       5,549,046.83    

 

Management stated that the above cash advance to PITC were already liquidated, 

however, the amounts per liquidation together with supporting documents are not 

reconciled with the total CA leaving an unliquidated balance which remain 

outstanding for more than 10 years. 

 

This could have been prevented if the Management did not fail to regularly 

coordinate with the PITC to fully utilize the outstanding balance and/or require the 

submission of remaining liquidating documents. 

 

The inclusion of the above dormant accounts results to doubt the accuracy, 

reliability and fair presentation of the Due from GOCCs account in the Financial 

Statements. 



44 

  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to expedite the evaluation of all 

overdue accounts to determine proper disposition and request authority to write-

off, if warranted. 

 

 

Compliance with the Gender and Development (GAD) Program 

 

4. For CY 2020, PDEA accomplished its targeted GAD activities, thus, attaining its

RA. No. 656, as amended by PD No. 245, mandates all government agencies to 

insure all their insurable properties, assets and interests with the General Insurance 

(GIF) of the GSIS in order to indemnify the government from any loss or damage to 

property against loss due to fire, earthquake, storm or other fortuitous event. 

 

Sec. 17 of RA No. 10607 states that the measure of an insurable interest in 

property is the extent to which the insured might be indemnified by loss or injury 

thereof. 



46 

  

 

The abovementioned rules and regulations emphasized Management’s 

responsibility for safeguarding its assets from loss and wastage with the due diligence 

of a good father of family. 

 

Verification disclosed that all insurable properties, assets and interests of PDEA 

were adequately insured with GIF administered by GSIS. 

 

 

Compliance with Tax Laws 

 

7. PDEA complied with the requirements under DBM and Department of Finance (DOF) 
Joint Circular No. 1-2000A dated July 31, 2001 on the withholding and remittance of 

taxes.  For CY 2020, PDEA withheld P118,975,730.92 and remitted P96,286,335.15 

on salaries and other compensation and P22,689,395.77 on procurement of goods and 

services for a total of P118,975,730.92 leaving an unremitted tax withheld of P0.
