EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

 

A. Introduction 
 

Republic Act (RA) No. 9165, also known as The Comprehensive Dangerous 

Drugs Act of 2002 bolsters the role of the Philippine Drug Enforcement System. It 

also redefines the Dangerous Drugs Board (DDB) as a policy and strategy-

formulating body by creating the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) as 

the leading agency amongst all other law enforcement agencies in the fight against 

illegal drugs. 

 

As an implementing arm of the DDB, among its mandate is to exercise 

operational supervision over drug enforcement units of other law enforcement 

agencies and to coordinate the participation of other sectors in the national anti-drug 

campaign.  

 

The PDEA is headed by Director General Wilkins M. Villanueva with the rank 

of Undersecretary. He is assisted by two Deputy Director Generals, one for Operation 

and the other for Administration, both with the rank of Assistant Secretary. 

 

As provided under RA No. 9165, PDEA has 10 national staff services, namely: 

 

1. Administrative and Human Resource Service 
2. Financial Management Service 
3. Logistic Management Service 
4. Intelligence and Investigation Service 
5. Internal Affairs Service 
6. Plans and Operations Service 
7. Legal and Prosecution Service 
8. Compliance Service 
9. International Cooperation and Foreign Affairs Service 
10. Preventive Education and Community Involvement Service 

 

The law also provides the establishment of the PDEA Academy to oversee the 

recruitment and training of all its agents and personnel, as well as the formulation of 

programs of instruction for career and specialized anti-drug training courses. PDEA 

also maintains and supports 17 Regional Offices (ROs) and 31 Satellite Offices 

nationwide. 

    

As of December 31, 2020, a total of 3,133 personnel composed the 

organizational structure of PDEA, of which 2,814 were permanent, 161 job orders 

and 158 contractual personnel.

D. Scope of Audit 
 

 The audit covered the accounts and operations of the PDEA for CY 2020.  It 

was conducted to: (a) ascertain the level of assurance that may be placed on 

Management’s assertions on the Financial Statements; (b) determine the propriety of 

the transactions as well as extent of compliance with laws, rules and regulations; and 

(c) determine the extent of implementation of prior year’s audit recommendations. 

Moreover, the audit was conducted in accordance with International Standards of 

Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAIs). 

 

E. Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements 
 

  The Auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the 

Financial Statements of PDEA as at December 31, 2020 because of the unrecorded 

issued Inventories totaling P113,597,619.48 due to the non-preparation and monthly 

submission of the Report of Supplies and Materials Issued by the Property and/or 

Supply Custodian to the Accounting Division as basis in preparing the Journal Entry 

Voucher (JEV) to record the supplies and materials issued, resulting in overstatement 

of the Inventories and Accumulated Surplus accounts by the same amount as at 

December 31, 2020. 

 

F.   Other Significant Audit Observation and Recommendations 

 

The following are the other significant audit observations and the 

corresponding recommendations. 

 

1. The balance of the Advances for Operating Expenses account had accumulated to 
P11,356,694.19 as at year-end due to the delayed liquidation of CAs disregarding 

the provisions of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 on the grant, 

utilization and accounting of   CAs; thus, making the CA susceptible to loss or 

misuse or theft, while long-kept supporting documents might be misplaced. In 

addition, the practice of waiting for the full utilization of the CA and refund of 

the unused balance to close their accountabilities resulted to the total refunded 



 

 

iv 

amount of P261,976.25 to the Bureau of the Treasury which reduced the cash 

allocation of the agency. (Paragraph No. 2) 

 

We reiterated our prior year’s recommendation and Management agreed to study 

the possibility of assigning one AO per region instead of different AO for 

different purposes and maintain the CA on replenishment method of liquidation 

for the regular cash advances. 

 

The above findings were discussed with Management Officials concerned in the 

exit conference held on June 9, 2021. Their views and comments were incorporated 

in the report, where appropriate. Details are presented in the Part II of this report. 

 

G. Implementation of Prior Year’s Audit Recommendations 

          Of the six audit recommendations embodied in the Annual Audit Report 

(AAR) of CY 2019, five were implemented and one was not implemented. The 

details are presented in Part III of this report.
