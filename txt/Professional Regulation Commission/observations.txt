PART II - OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

 

FINANCIAL AUDIT 

 

Accounting Errors and Omissions 

 

1. Errors and omissions in the recording of financial transactions resulted in 
misstatements on Assets, Liabilities and Equity accounts totaling 

P306,353,562.35, thus affecting the fair presentation thereof in the financial 

statements (FSs) of the PRC as at December 31, 2020. 

 

1.1. Section 15, Chapter 2 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for 
National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I, states that: 

 

The financial statements shall present fairly the financial position, 

financial performance and cash flows of an entity.   Fair 

presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of 

transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with the 

definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, 

and expenses set out in PPSAS.1  Xxx . 

 

1.2. Section 111 of PD No. 1445 provides that the accounts of an agency shall be 
kept in such details as is necessary to meet the needs of the agency and at the 

same time be adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or control 

agencies of the government. Moreover, the highest objectivity and 

consistency shall be observed in the keeping of the accounts to safeguard 

against inaccurate or misleading information. 

 

1.3. Audit of the accounts and related transactions showed various misstatements, 
omissions and errors totaling  P306,353,562.35 as of December 31, 2020,  

summarized  in the table below and discussed in detail in the succeeding 

paragraphs.

1.4. The amount of misstatements of P306,353,562.35 exceeded by 
P289,558,333.69 the established materiality threshold of P16,795,228.66 or 

two percent of the total Revenue  of P839,761,432.99 for a revenue-driven 

entity, resulting in the unreliability of the existence, completeness, and 

accuracy of the reported balances of affected accounts in the FSs of  the PRC 

as at December 31, 2020. 

 

Inter-Agency Receivables 

 

1.5. The balance of the Inter-Agency Receivables totaling P68,725,748.17 as of 
December 31, 2020 is misstated by P2,447,579.92 due to the following errors 

and omissions: 

 

a) Unrecorded savings/unutilized amount of P2,356,989.32 from various 
completed projects already remitted by PITC to the BTr, thereby 

overstating the Due from GOCCs account while understating Cash – 

Treasury /Agency Deposit, Regular. 

 

1.6. Section 7.3.3 of the 2016 Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations 
(RIRR)-- of RA No. 9184 states that in order to hasten project 

implementation, Procuring Entities which may not have the proficiency or 

capacity to undertake a particular procurement as determined by the Head of 

Procuring Entity (HoPE) concerned, may outsource the procurement tasks by: 



37 

 

 

a. Requesting other Government of the Philippines (GoP) agencies to 
undertake such procurement for them through the execution of a 

memorandum of agreement containing specific arrangements, 

stipulations and covenants, in accordance with government budgeting, 

accounting and auditing rules; 

 

b. Engaging private procurement agents to directly undertake the 
procurement for them, subject to the guidelines to be issued by the 

Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB); or 

 

c. Recruiting or engaging consultants to assist them directly and/or train 
their staff in the management of the procurement function. 

 

1.7. Item 4.9 of the COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13,1994 provides 
that the Implementing Agency (IA) shall return to the Source Agency (SA) 

any unused balance upon completion of the project. 

 

1.8. Under Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) 12-2017-83 dated December 29, 
2017, PRC appoints and engages PITC to render one or all of the following 

services to PRC in its procurement needs: 

 

a. PITC as provider of Procurement Outsourcing Services; and 
b. PITC as a supplier of PRC’s goods and services requirements. 

 

1.9. Furthermore, Article IV.10 Procurement Outsourcing Services states that 
upon completion of each procurement project, PITC shall submit to PRC a 

Liquidation Report and return to PRC the unexpended balance of funds 

transferred and/or deposited in the MOA Account for that particular project 

including any and all income earned in accordance with Article II.3 thereof. 

 

1.10. The balance of the Due from GOCCs account as shown in the Statement of 
Financial Position of PRC as at December 31, 2020 amounts to 

P11,116,677.33 and consists of the following:

Total 11,116,677.33 

 

1.11. Verification of the SL of the PRC and the Confirmation Reply and SL from 
PITC disclosed a net difference of P2,354,662.33 in the ending balance as 

follows:

1.12. Analysis, however, revealed that part of the net difference of P2,354,662.33 
represents savings from completed projects totaling P2,356,989.32, details as

1.13. The ABCs were the amount transferred by PRC to PITC funded by Check 
No. 9918061417 dated June 1, 2018. The savings generated were due to the 

differences between the ABC and the actual contract price as offered by the 

winning bidders. These savings, however, were not recognized since the 

Accounting Division based the recording of deliveries, and the corollary 

reversal of the Due from the GOCCs account, on the amount of the contract. 

As validated and per inquiry with PITC Accounting Division, the amount was 

already remitted to the BTr. under Official Receipt (OR) No.7061639 dated 

December 11, 2020. However, such remittance was not made known to PRC, 

hence the non-adjustment of the Due from GOCCs account, resulting in 

overstatement thereof.  

 



39 

 

1.14. The absence of reconciliation procedures by the Accounting Division with the 
PITC records contributed to these unrecognized discrepancies making the 

balance of Due from GOCCs account doubtful. 

 

b) Unrecorded Interest earned on deposit of PRC with DBP-PITC-PRC for 
the 4th Quarter ending December 31, 2020 - P2,327.00 

 

1.15. Based on the MOA 12-2017-83 dated December 29, 2017, between PRC and 
PITC, PRC has authorized PITC to open an account with authorized 

government depository bank under the account name Philippine International 

Trading Corporation (“PITC-PRC MOA”) to facilitate PRC fund transfers for 

payment of all goods and services to be procured through or from PITC. 

Under Article II.3 Fees Payable of the same MOA,  it is provided that interest 

earned, based on the prevailing interest rate on the PITC-PRC account at the 

time of transfer of the funds by PRC to PITC shall be for the account of PRC. 

 

1.16. We also noted that the foregoing difference between the SL of PRC and PITC 
included interest income amounting to P2,327.00 earned on the account 

opened, which remained unrecorded in the PRC books. 

 

c) Unreconciled difference between PRC books and DPWH - RO No. V – 
P88,263.60 

 

1.17. Item 4.9 of the COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994 provides 
that the IA shall return to the Source Agency (SA) any unused balance upon 

completion of the project. 

 

1.18. Chapter 3, Description of Accounts of GAM for NGAs, Volume III - 
describes the Due from NGAs as the account used to recognize advances for 

purchase of goods/services as authorized by law, fund transfers to the NGAs 

for implementation of projects and other receivables from NGAs. Credit this 

account upon receipt of goods/services, liquidation of fund transfers, receipt 

of payment, settlement, write-off, and/or adjustments. 

 

1.19. Verification of the SL and Confirmation Replies and Statement of Account 
(SOA) from the DPWH RO No. V disclosed a difference of P88,263.60 in the 

ending balance, as follows:

Amount (in Pesos) 

DPWH RO No. 5 ˗ 88,263.60  88,263.60 

 

1.20. As per inquiry with the Accounting Division, the balance of Due from NGAs 
- DPWH account represents the unexpended portion of the fund transferred 



40 

 

to DPWH RO V. Results of confirmation procedure revealed that the 

unexpended balance was returned by the DPWH RO V to PRC thru Check 

No. 0001973811 dated April 15, 2011. Despite this return, however, the same 

remained unadjusted by the Accounting Division, resulting in the 

overstatement of the Due from NGAs account balance.  

 

1.21. We recommended, and Management agreed, to require the Accounting 
Division to adjust the Due from GOCCs and Cash – Treasury /Agency 

Deposit, Regular accounts to reflect the savings from completed 

procurements remitted by PITC to the BTr. and the interest earned; and 

to coordinate with DPWH RO V and request for a copy of the deposit 

slip and effect the adjustment to arrive at correct balance at yearend. 

 

1.22. Management commented that PITC, being the IA or procurement agent of 
PRC, has not submitted the required reports (Report of Disbursements and 

Report of Checks Issued) to the Accounting Division as required under COA 

Circular No. 94-013 dated  December 13, 1994. Hence the Accounting 

Division was not aware of the unutilized funds and the savings generated for 

the procured items that remained in the books as of December 31, 2020. 

However, an appropriate Journal Entry Voucher (JEV) was already prepared 

to reflect the remittance of PITC to BTr of savings from various PRC 

completed projects. Adjusting entry to reflect the interest earned on the 

deposit with DBP-PITC-PRC for the 4th Quarter ending December 31, 2020, 

was also prepared. Moreover, ICTS was already apprised with the 

recommendation during the meeting held with the Technical Working Group 

– Audit Observation Memorandum (TWG-AOM). Furthermore, the 

Commission takes cognizance of the recommendation, and reconciliation of 

the subject GOCC account shall be done every year thereafter. Lastly, the 

Commission will be sending a letter to PITC seeking an explanation on the 

actions taken by them and an update on the status of projects. 

 

         Inventories 

 

d) Inclusion of Semi-expendable Items below P15,000.00 capitalization 
threshold in the PPE accounts - P32,439.00. 

 

1.23. Section 3, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAS, Volume I, provides that the 
cost of an item of PPE shall be recognized as asset if, and only if: 

 

a. It is probable that the future economic benefits or service potential 
associated with the item will flow to the entity; 

 

b. The cost or fair value of the item can be measured reliably; 
 

c. Beneficial ownership and control clearly rest with the government; 
 

d. The asset is used to achieve government objectives; and  



41 

 

 

e. It meets the capitalization threshold of P15,000. 
 

1.24. Various PPE items totaling P32,439.00, which have an original cost of less 
than the P15,000 capitalization threshold remained recorded in the books as 

PPE instead of as semi-expendable property as prescribed in the above 

regulation.  These resulted in the overstatement of the PPE accounts and 

understated the Inventories accounts by the same amount.

Technical and Scientific 

Equipment 2 28,175.00 

Furniture and Fixtures 3 4,264.00 

Total 5 32,439.00 

 

1.25. We recommended, and Management agreed to require the Accounting 
and Procurement and Supply Divisions to reclassify the items of PPE 

account costing less than the P15,000.00 threshold to their proper 

classification in accordance with the GAM for NGAs. 

     

    PPE 

 

1.26. The balance of the PPE account of P670,717,714.18 as of December 31, 2020 
is misstated by P299,322,843.73 due to the following errors and omissions: 

  
e) Completed Building and Information Technology (IT) projects totaling 

P57,987,887.21 and P22,396,358.91, respectively, still recorded in the 

CIP- Buildings and Other Structure account, which  overstated the same 

and understated the appropriate PPE account/s. 

 

1.27. Chapter 10 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I which states that: 
 

“During the construction period, all expenses incurred in relation to the 

construction of the PPE shall be taken up in the books as Construction in 

Progress (CIP) with appropriate asset classification. As soon as the 

construction is completed, the “Construction in Progress” account shall be 

reclassified to the proper asset account. Likewise, all expenses such as 

interests, license fees, etc., during the construction period shall be 

capitalized.  

 

If the project is to be constructed by administration, the procurement of labor 

and materials shall be in compliance with provisions of R.A. No. 9184 and its 

Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations…xxx” 

 



42 

 

1.28. Under Chapter 3 of GAM for NGAs, Volume III, the CIP-Buildings and Other 
Structures account is used to recognize the accumulated cost or other 

appropriate value of buildings and other structures which are still in the 

process of construction or development. Credit this account for 

reclassification to the appropriate Buildings and Other Structures account 

upon completion. 

 

1.29. Verification of Schedule of the CIP- Buildings and Other Structure, contracts, 
disbursement vouchers (DVs), and other supporting documents disclosed that 

despite Management’s issuance of Certificate of Completion and Acceptance 

(CCA), projects totaling P57,987,887.21 that were already completed as of 

December 31, 2020 were still recorded in the CIP - Buildings and Other 

Structures account, resulting in the overstatement thereof and understatement 

of proper PPE and Depreciation accounts in the books. The copies of the 

CCAs were not provided to the Accounting Division, hence the non-reversal 

of the related CIP account. Details are as follows:

f) Direct Labor Cost of completed building projects recorded in CIP-
Buildings and Other Structure account- P4,739,427.31. 

 

1.30. Moreover, it was also observed that the cost of labor totaling P4,739,427.31 
relative to the building renovation and electrical system administered by the 

PRC, which is deemed to be capitalized upon completion of the projects were 

still recorded in the CIP - Buildings and Other Structures accounts thereby 

overstating the said account and understating the affected PPE and 

Depreciation accounts.

PRC Laborers -  Electrical System 1,867,450.37

1.31. We recommended, and Management agreed, to require the Accounting 
Division to effect the necessary adjusting entries to transfer to the 

appropriate asset account the cost of completed and accepted projects as 

well as labor costs for the building renovation and the provision of 

depreciation for depreciable completed projects. 

 

1.32. Management commented that the Accounting Division will coordinate with 
Administrative Service (AS) to request the latter to provide the copies of 

CCAs and serve as basis in preparing the necessary reclassification entry to 

their appropriate PPE account.    

 

g) Erroneous computation of Accumulated Depreciation and Depreciation 
Expense resulted in the overstatement of PPE accounts and 

understatement of non-cash expenses amounting to P214,023,372.56 and 

P6,208,693.75, respectively. 

 

1.33. Section 27, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I,  provides that PPE 
gradually loses its ability to provide service over the course of time. Because 

of this, its cost needs to be distributed on a systematic basis over its useful 

life. The allocated cost is referred to as depreciation. The depreciation charged 

for each period shall be recognized as expense unless it is included in the 



44 

 

carrying amount of another asset.  Xxx.  The following are policies regarding 

depreciation of PPE: 

 

a. There are three factors an entity must consider in determining 
depreciation: 

 

1. Initial Cost, 
2. Useful life, and 
3. Expected residual value at the end of its useful life. 

 

b. Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use such as when 
it is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of 

operating in the manner intended by Management. For simplicity and to 

avoid proportionate computation, depreciation shall be for one month if 

the PPE is available for use on or before the 15th of the month. However, 

if the PPE is available for use after the 15th of the month, deprecation 

shall be for the succeeding month. 

 

c. The straight-line method of depreciation shall be adopted unless another 
method is more appropriate for entity operation. That method is applied 

consistently from period to period unless there is a change in the expected 

pattern of consumption of those future economic benefits or service 

potential. 

 

d. The estimation of the useful life of the asset is a matter of judgment based 
on the experience of the entity with similar assets. 

 

e. A residual value equivalent to at least five percent of the cost shall be 
adopted unless a more appropriate percentage is determined by the entity 

based on its operation subject to the approval of COA. 

 

1.34. Our audit revealed that the Agency has not provided the correct depreciation 
expense and accumulated depreciation for most of the items of PPE during 

the assets’ useful lives. There are PPE items not subjected to depreciation 

even if still in use and there are fully depreciated items still being reported at 

cost with understated accumulated depreciation or none at all resulting in an 

overstatement of the Agency’s PPE accounts. 

 

1.35. Analysis of the PPE accounts showed discrepancies in the computation of the 
depreciation expense and accumulated depreciation for the following items of 

PPE:

1.36.  The erroneous computation of  depreciation resulted in the understatement of 
the Non-Cash Expenses or Depreciation Expenses by P6,208,693.75, 

Accumulated Depreciation and Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) by 

P214,023,372.56 and P207,814,678.81, respectively. 

 

h) Existence of PPE items without acquisition cost subjected to 
depreciation amounting to P175,797.74 thereby overstating the Non-

cash expenses and understating the PPE accounts. 



46 

 

 

1.37.  Verification of the PPE Schedule reveals that there were PPE items with zero 
acquisition cost but were provided with depreciation, thus resulting in the 

understatement of the carrying amount of PPE Accounts and overstatement 

of the related Depreciation Expenses of P175,797.74, as shown below:

Total 175,797.74 

 

1.38. We recommended, and Management agreed to require the Accounting 
Division to make the necessary adjustments to correct the 

understatements of recorded Accumulated Depreciation and 

Depreciation Expenses. 

 

1.39.  Management commented that preliminary analysis of the PPE Schedule for 
Motor Vehicles (MV) disclosed that indeed a system error in electronic New 

Government Accounting System (e-NGAS) was one of the factors which 

contributed to the erroneous computation of Depreciation Expense resulting 

in an understatement of the Accumulated Depreciation.  Initial analysis has 

shown that there was no corresponding Depreciation Expense generated by 

the system for property numbers labeled as letters f,g,h, and i, when compared 

to the same property number labeled as number 6,7,8 & 10. Hence, the new 

e-NGAS discontinued generating depreciation expense for the PPEs that were 

procured before the year 2015 which resulted in the understatement of 

Depreciation Expenses and Accumulated Depreciation for 2015 and years 

thereafter. 

   

   Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

1.40. Initial inspection of the given data for the MVs provided by Management 
showed that these were fully depreciated items as of December 31, 2015, thus 

the system could be correct in not providing depreciation therefor. We further 

recommend that the same system error be referred to COA-ASDOSO for 

technical assistance on the matter.   

 

Accounts Payable 

 

i) Unreverted  dormant Accounts Payable - P1,319,509.69 



47 

 

 

1.41.  Section 98 of PD No. 1445 provides the following: 
 

“Reversion of unliquidated balances of accounts payable. The 

Commission, upon notice to the head of agency concerned, may 

revert to the unappropriated surplus of the general fund of the 

national government, any unliquidated balance of accounts payable 

in the books of the national government, which has been outstanding 

for two years or more and against which no actual claim, 

administrative or judicial, has been filed or which is not covered by 

perfected contracts on record. This section shall not apply to 

unliquidated balances of accounts payable in trust funds as long as 

the purposes for which the funds were created have not been 

accomplished.” 

 

1.42. Subsequent claims of these dormant payables will be subject to Section 3 of 
Executive Order (EO) No. 87 dated August 13, 2019, which states that: “In 

the event that reverted accounts payable are subsequently validated by 

competent authorities or by final and executory decisions, the funding 

therefor shall be determined by the Department of Budget and Management 

(DBM) subject to the applicable laws, rules and regulations.” 

 

1.43. The balance of Accounts Payable of P62,518,193.43 is misstated by 
P1,319,509.69 due to the presence of accounts which are outstanding for more 

than two years, which remained unreverted to Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit), 

details are as follows: 

 

    Table 12. Accounts Payable Outstanding for More Than Two Years 

 

1.44. Considering that the payable accounts have been non-moving for more than 
two years and no valid claims have been filed with PRC, these accounts 

should be adjusted pursuant to Section 98 of PD No. 1445. 

 

1.45. We recommended that Management require the Chief Accountant to 
revert the Accounts Payable that have been outstanding for more than 

two years pursuant to  Section 98 of P.D. No. 1445 and EO No. 87 dated 

August 13, 2019. 

 

1.46. Management commented that the reconciliation for the subject account is 
already being undertaken by the Accounting Division. The Accounts Payable 

to PhilHealth amounting to P814.01 was recorded erroneously in the set-up 

of Accounts Payable in December 2019; hence, it should not be considered as 

Payees Amount (in Pesos) 

PhilHealth 814.01 

Land Bank (Payroll Account) 1,318,695.68 

Total 1,319,509.69 



48 

 

long outstanding for more than two years as of  December 31, 2020. On the 

other hand, the Accounts Payable to Landbank (Payroll Account) amounting 

to P1,318,695.68 resulted from erroneous crediting of such instead of Due to 

Officers and Employees during the procedure of recording accruals of salaries 

and wages at yearend. Moreover, it may be recalled that it was a practice 

allowed before, which was also the same observation in AOM No. 2020-010 

(2019), that we immediately discontinued in the ensuing year. Nonetheless, 

pending the outcome of fully completed reconciliation due to unavailability 

of books of accounts of 2014 and prior years, except for the findings for 2015 

and years thereafter, we might not be able to revert the ending balance, if any, 

to Accumulated Surplus as we need to refer to actual recorded JEVs for the 

subsequent payment made for every recorded accrual of expenses. 

Furthermore, since PhilHealth and Landbank are neither Supplier nor 

Creditor, it will require the reconciliation of the amount of P121,124.68. 

 

    Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

1.47. Management comments were duly noted. We wish to clarify, however, that 
the applicability of EO No. 87 covers all accounts payable of all the National 

Government Agencies with the exception of trust or fiduciary funds and 

accounts payables pertaining to foreign-assisted projects. Thus, payables to 

PhilHealth and other government agencies are also included in the scope of 

the EO. 

 

Other Payables  

 

j) Proceeds from the sale of bid documents totaling P1,338,208.75 were 
recorded as Other Payables account instead of Trust Liabilities account, 

contrary to the DBM-BC  No. 2004-5A, thereby  overstating the Other 

Payables account. 

 

1.48. DBM-BC No. 2007-3 dated November 29, 2007, which amends Item 6.1 of 
DBM-BC No. 2004-5A dated October 7, 2005, provides the funding source 

for payment of Honoraria and overtime pay to government personnel 

involved in government procurement as authorized under RA No. 9184. 

Section 3.1 states that the amount necessary for payment of Honoraria and 

overtime pay authorized under BC No. 2004-5A shall be sourced from the 

following: 

 

3.1.1 Collections from successfully completed procurement projects 
limited, however, to activities prior to awarding of contracts to 

winning bidders: 

 

 Proceeds from sale of bid documents 

 Fees from contractor’s/supplier registry 



49 

 

 Fees charged for copies of minutes of bid openings, BAC 
Resolution and other BAC documents 

 Protest fees; and 

 Proceeds from bid /performance security 
 

3.1.2 Savings realized from the current year specific budget of the agency 
under the General Appropriations Act (GAA) 

 

1.49. In addition, Section 6.2 of DBM BC No. 2004-5A provides that pursuant to 
the DOF DBM-COA Permanent Committee Resolution No. 2005-2 dated 

June 2005, all agencies are authorized to treat collections from sources 

identified in Section 6.1 as trust receipts to be used as exclusively for the 

payment of Honoraria and overtime pay authorized. Agencies may utilize up 

to one hundred percent (100%) of the said collections for the payment of 

Honoraria and overtime pay subject to the guidelines in Item 5.0 of the same 

Circular. Any excess in the amount collected shall be remitted by NGAs to 

BTr. In the case of GOCCs and LGUs, the same shall form part of their 

corporate or local government funds, respectively. 

 

1.50. Moreover, Chapter 3 of GAM for NGAs, Volume III defines Other Payables 
and Trust Liabilities as follows: 

 

Account Title   Other Payables 

Account Number 29999990 

Normal Balance Credit 

Description This account is used to recognize other liabilities not 

falling under any of the specific payable accounts. Debit 

this   account for settlement of liabilities. 

            

Account Title   Trust Liabilities 

Account Number 20401010 

Normal Balance Credit 

Description This account is used to recognize the amount held in trust 

for specific purpose. Debit this account for payment or 

settlement of liability. 

    

1.51. We have noted that as of December 31, 2020, the SLs of Other Payables 
account totaling P2,498,627.36 included a total of P1,338,208.75 excess on 

the proceeds from the sale of bid documents after payment of Honoraria. The 

same should have been recorded as Trust Receipts under  the Trust Liabilities 

account  pursuant to the Revised Chart of Accounts and in conformity with 

the provisions of DBM-BC No. 2004-5A. Moreover, the excess amount was 

not remitted to the BTr. as required by the foregoing Circular.  

 

1.52. We recommended and Management agreed to reclassify the proceeds 
from the sale of bid documents as Trust Liabilities account and remit to 



50 

 

the BTr the remaining balance of the proceeds per Section 6.2 of DBM 

BC No. 2005-4A. 

 

         Operating Expenses  

 

1.53. The total Operating Expenses for the period ended December 31, 2020 of 
P236,086,386.82 is misstated by P1,892,981.26 due to the following 

deficiencies: 

 

k) Payment of Honoraria amounting to P130,910.68 was debited to Due to 
Officers and Employees account instead of the Honoraria Expenses 

account.  

 

1.54. The DBM – PRC Joint Circular (JC) No. 2009-1 dated December 29, 2009 
prescribed the revised guidelines for the implementation of Section 10 of RA 

No. 8981, “The PRC Modernization Act of 2000,” as implemented by Section 

2, Rule III of its Implementing Rules and Regulations, on the compensation 

of Chairpersons and Members of various Professional Regulatory Boards 

(PRBs). 

 

1.55. Section 2.1 of the JC states that the Chairpersons and Members of the PRBs 
shall be granted compensation in the form of Honoraria. The maximum 

Honoraria rates that may be granted are as follows: 

 

Table 13. Maximum Rate of PRB Members’ Honoraria per Month 

 
Maximum Rate of Honoraria per Month 

a. Chairperson Equivalent to the current monthly basic salary of the 
third (3rd) step of Salary Grade 28 

b. Member Equivalent to the current monthly basic salary of the 
first (1st) step of Salary Grade 28 

 

1.56. The total of the expenses for Honoraria account as shown in the Statement of 
Financial Performance of PRC for the period December 31, 2020 amounted 

to P226,906,195.96, however, our audit revealed that there was a discrepancy 

of P242,041.11, details are as follows:

Total 226,906,195.96 227,148,237.07 242,041.11 

 

1.57. Our analysis showed that out of the discrepancy of P242,041.11, the amount 
of  P130,910.68 was debited to Due to Officers and Employees account 

instead of the Honoraria account, while the P111,130.32 was actually unpaid 

as of yearend and was already coordinated with Human Resource 

Development Division (HRDD) for their appropriate action.  

 

1.58. We recommended, and Management agreed, to make the necessary 
adjustment for the accounts Honoraria and the Due to Officers and 

Employees to correct the noted understatement of P130,910.68. 

 

l) Recording of the prior year’s expenditures as current expenses totaling 
P1,762,070.58, thus overstating the affected expense accounts in CY 

2020 

 

1.59. Paragraph 7 of International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) 1 
defines accrual as “a basis of accounting under which transactions and other 

events are recognized when they occur (and not only when cash or its 

equivalent is received or paid). Therefore, the transactions and events are 

recorded in the accounting records and recognized in the financial statements 

of the periods to which they relate. The elements recognized under accrual 

accounting are assets, liabilities, net assets/equity, revenue, and expenses.” 

(Emphasis supplied). 

 

1.60. Section 119 of PD No. 1445, otherwise known as the State Audit Code of the 
Philippines, states that: “All lawful expenditure and obligations incurred 

during the year shall be taken up in the accounts of that year.” 

 

1.61. Our audit, however, showed transactions in the total amount of 
P1,275,863.50, which includes reimbursement and liquidations of expenses 

for the conduct of various examinations and trainings, and payment of 

Honoraria incurred as of December 31, 2019, were recognized as 

expenditures in CY 2020 under account Other General Services, thus materially 

affecting the latter account. Details are as follows:

Total 1,275,863.50 

 

1.62. Moreover, our account analysis also revealed that the same condition was also 
present in other Expense accounts such as Salaries and Wages – Regular, 

Security Services and Personal Economic Relief Allowance (PERA), details 

as follows: 

 

            Table 16. Prior Year Expenditures Recorded as Expenses in CY 2020 

Account  Amount (in Pesos) 

Salaries and Wages - Regular 344,867.65 
Security Services 125,591.72 
Personal Economic Relief Allowance (PERA) 15,747.81 

Total 486,207.18 

 

1.63. The above expenses of prior years were recognized in the books in CY 2020, 
contrary to Paragraph 7 of IPSAS 1 and Section 119 of PD No. 1445. This 

resulted in the overstatement of the current year’s Expense accounts which 

affected the reliability of the FSs as at yearend. The proper recognition of 



53 

 

expenses in the period these were incurred is necessary to have reliable 

financial information for the Agency’s stakeholders.  

 

1.64. We recommended, and Management agreed, to consider the period in 
which the expenses were incurred in recording the same in the books; 

and restate the FSs of CYs 2019 and 2020 accordingly. 
 

 

Accounting and Property Controls Deficiencies 

 

2. Deficiencies totaling P686,719,197.52 observed in the recording and reporting of 
financial transactions such as: a) absence of reconciliation of accounting 

records, b) late recording of transactions, c) existence of dormant accounts, and 

d) unsupported prior year balances, thus affecting the reliability of the reported 

balances of the Assets, Liabilities and Revenue in the FSs as of December 31, 

2020. 

 

2.1. Section 6.e, Chapter 19 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, on Qualitative 
Characteristics of Financial Reporting, states that an entity shall present 

information including accounting policies in a manner that meets reliable 

information, which is free from material error and bias, and can be depended 

on by users to represent faithfully that which it purports to represent or could 

reasonably be expected to represent.

a) The Cash and Cash Equivalents account balance of P7,296,383.09 cannot 
be ascertained due to the: i) unreconciled negative /abnormal SL 

balances ; ii) undeposited collections per COs’ SLs not reflected in the  

RCD; iii) unreconciled differences due to non-preparation of BRS; and 

iv) existence of dormant or inactive Trust accounts. 

 

2.3. Section 32 of COA Memorandum No. 2013-004 dated July 9, 2013 clearly 
states that all Collecting Officers (COs) shall deposit intact all their 

collections, as well as collections turned over to them by sub-

collectors/tellers, with authorized government depository bank (AGDB) daily 

or not later than the next banking day. Where collections are minimal and 

daily deposit thereof becomes costly and impractical, the COs shall deposit 

their collections at least once a week, or as soon as the collections reach 

P10,000.00. They shall record all deposits made in the Cash Receipts Record 

(CRR). 
 

2.4. Section 69 of  PD No. 1445, the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines 
provides that: 

 

(1) Public officers authorized to receive and collect moneys arising from 
taxes, revenues, or receipts of any kind shall remit or deposit intact the 

full amounts so received and collected by them to the treasury of the 

agency concerned and credited to the particular accounts to which the 

said moneys belong. (xx) 

 

(4)  The respective treasuries of these agencies shall in turn deposit with the 

proper government depository the full amount of the collections not later 

than the following banking day.

i. Unreconciled negative/ abnormal SL balances of accountabilities in the 
SLs of six COs totaling P1,734,114.68; 

 

2.5. The Cash – Collecting Officers account represents over-the-counter 
collections of the Central and ROs which are due for deposit to the BTr. on 

the same day or the next banking day. The CO prepare the RCD for 

submission to the Accounting Division who reviews and records the same in 

the books of the agency. As of year-end, the account’s balance of P356,302.93 

consists of the following:

Balance as of December 31, 2020 356,302.93 

 

2.6. Verification of the concerned COs’ SL’s showed that there were significant 
unreconciled negative/abnormal balances totaling P1,734,114.68. It was 

noted that the negative balances were treated as an offset against the balance 

of the account by decreasing the undeposited collections for the year ended 

December 31, 2020. However, there was no reconciliation being done by the 

Accounting Division on the noted abnormal balances. Details are as follows:

total of P1,007,234.56 was not reflected as collections to be deposited as per 

Report of Collections and Deposits, although reported as outstanding 

collections per COs’ Subsidiary Ledgers thus rendering the Cash-Collecting 

Officer doubtful. Details are as follows:

2.8. Section 5, Chapter 21 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, provides the 
preparation of the Bank Reconciliation Statement. The Chief 

Accountant/Designated Staff shall within ten days from receipt of the 

monthly Bank Statement (BS) together with the paid checks, original copies 

of Debit Memoranda (DM)/Credit Memoranda (CM) from the Government 

Servicing Bank (GSB), reconcile the BS with the GL and prepare the BRS in

closing and the reversion to the General Fund in compliance with COA 

Circular No. 2015-001 dated January 29, 2015. 

 

2.12. We recommended, and Management agreed, to require the: 
 

a. Accounting Division to reconcile and determine the cause of the 
negative balances in the SLs of the COs; 

 

b. prepare and submit regularly the BRSs for all bank accounts 
together with the JEVs taking up the reconciling items; and 

 

c. make the necessary reconciliation of the dormant Trust accounts 
and transfer the remaining balance thereof to the BTr. 

 

2.13. Management commented as follows: 
 

 The Accounting Division has already issued a Memorandum dated  
March 18, 2021 requesting the concerned COs to reconcile their 

respective SL transactions. To date, Ms. Juanita Domogen and Ms. 

Divinia Ramos already submitted reconciliation and supporting 

documents to be validated by the Accounting Division and shall be the 

basis to prepare the appropriate adjusting entry, if any.  

 

 The Accounting Division was unable to start the reconciliation due to the 
unavailability of records from the database of old e-NGAS which 

covered the transactions of CY 2014 and prior years. We already seek 

assistance from our ICT Division and COA-ASDOSO as well, but to no 

avail. The Commission will send a letter before the COA Proper to 

inform them and elevate the matter for any intervention/assistance that 

may be extended. 

 

 The Accounting Division has already requested an electronic copy of the 
BRS from Landbank on  March 19, 2021 for the transactions covering 

the period from 2015-2020 to aid the reconciliation process. A 

reconciliation of the available records shall be immediately started and 

appropriate adjusting entry prepared, if any, including the reversion of 

unutilized remaining balance as mentioned in the comment of 

observation letter b. Pending the retrieval of the old e-NGAS database, 

the Accounting Division will exert effort to locate the available 

documents that may be of help in the reconciliation process. 

 

Inter-Agency Receivables 

 

b) The balance of the account Due from NGAs of P57,609,070.84 as of 
December 31, 2020, is doubtful due to unreconciled differences between 

the books of PRC and with the DBM - PS totaling P32,365,829.44.  



59 

 

 

2.14. Executive Order No. 359 (1989) provides among others that the appropriation 
for the Annual Procurement programs of Agencies shall be identified in their 

annual Work and Financial Plan. Said Work and Financial Plan shall serve as 

the basis of the DBM in the release of Agency’s allotments and monthly 

funding warrants. The agencies shall remit in advance to the PS the funds 

needed to service their requirements for supplies, materials and equipment as 

reflected in said Work Financial Plan. 

 

2.15. Section 20 of the GAA, FY 2020 requires all agencies in the government to 
purchase common-use supplies from the PS as mandated under LOI No. 755 

dated October 18, 1978, E.O.359, s.1989, A.O. No.17, s.2011 and such other 

guidelines issued thereon. Common supplies shall refer to those included in 

the Electronic Catalogue of the PS and those which shall be regularly updated 

to include all items commonly procured by agencies of the government. 

 

2.16. Moreover, Chapter 3 of GAM for NGAs, Volume III describes Due from 
National Government Agencies as follows: 

 

Account Title   Due from National Government Agencies 

Account Number 10303010 

Normal Balance Debit 

Description This account is used to recognize advances for purchases of 

goods/services as authorized by law, fund transfers to the 

NGAs for implementation of projects and other receivables 

from NGAs. Credit this account upon receipt of 

goods/services, and liquidation of fund transfers/receivables. 

 

2.17. Verification of the SL and the Confirmation Replies and Statement of 
Account (SOA) from DBM - PS disclosed a net difference of P32,365,829.44 

in the ending balance as follows:

2.19. Comparison of the SL of the PRC and SOA from DBM-PS showed a 
difference of P35,540,003.65 in the beginning balance. This represents 

various unreconciled advance payments by PRC as well as advances with no 

corresponding deliveries.  

 

2.20. As reiterated in the previous year’s observation, one of the deficiencies noted 
in the carried over balances in CY 2019 was the unrecorded deliveries in the 

books of the PRC totaling P146,314.40, details as follows: 

 

         Table 24. CY 2019 List of Unrecorded Deliveries in the PRC Books

GFA19-04270 29,420.67 

Total 146,314.40 

 

2.21. As per inquiry with the Accounting Division, the unrecorded deliveries refer 
to Delivery Receipts (DRs) for the procurement of plane fare which are 

subject to verification with PS due to variances between their Sales Invoice 

(SI) and attached DR from the airline service provider. 

 

2.22. Further, it was also noted that fund transfers of the previous years were 
recorded only in CY 2020 by the DBM-PS as follows:

2.23. Furthermore, the Accounting Division recorded the deliveries of the previous 
years in CY2020 hence, were not charged to corresponding accounts thereat 

resulting from neglect of procedural guidelines stated in Chapter 3, GAM for 

NGAs, Volume III. Details are as follows:

2.24. We therefore reiterate our recommendations that Management require 
the:  

 

a. Property Officer to reconcile their records with the PS-DBM and 
request offsetting of the balances with the succeeding purchases; if 

warranted; and 

 

b. Accounting Division to make the necessary adjustments in the books 
of accounts to record the deliveries and perform the procedures 

stated in Chapter 3, GAM for NGAs, Volume III. 

 

 



62 

 

2.25. Management comments are as follows: 
 

 The Accounting Division was unable to start the reconciliation due to 
unavailability of records from the database of old eNGAS which covered 

the transactions of CY 2014 and prior years. We already seek assistance 

from our ICT Division and COA-ASDOSO as well, but to no avail. The 

Commission will send a letter before the COA proper to formally inform 

them and elevate the matter for any intervention/assistance that may be 

extended. Nonetheless, the reconciliation of the books of accounts from 

year 2015 and years thereafter are already being addressed by the 

Accounting Division.  

 

 Further, the deliveries (liquidation) by DBM-PS amounting to 
P146,314.40 represents DRs issued for the procurement of plane fare 

which remained unrecorded due to discrepancies to its corresponding SI 

issued by the Philippine Airlines (PAL). This was already coordinated by 

PSD to DBM-PS sometime last year, but to no avail. A follow-up shall 

be made regarding the matter.  

 

 The Accounting Division strictly adheres to the provisions set forth in 
Chapter 3, Volume III, GAM for NGAs.  However, there may be 

instances that DBM-PS was delayed in transmitting the concerned DRs 

for items procured from them which could be one of the factors of 

discrepancies between our records. 

 

Inventories 

 

c) The balances of two Inventories accounts totaling Ᵽ79,189,404.93  are 
unreliable  due to the i) variance of P33,075,665.87 between the Inventory 

Schedule and the Report on the Physical Count of Inventory (RPCI); ii) 

unaccounted Inventory items of P25,148,237.30; iii) unrecorded 

Inventory items per Accounting records of P2,391,129.61; iv) 

unreconciled CY 2004 SL carry-over balance of the account Office 

Supplies Inventory of P5,400,962.07; and v) existence of negative 

quantity and unit cost in the Inventory Schedule of P1,499,281.32 . 

 

2.26. Sections 6 and 9, Chapter 8 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, state that: 
 

 Sec. 6. Weighted Average Method. The weighted average method shall 

be used for costing inventories. This method calls for the re-calculation 

of the average cost of all items in stock after every purchase. Therefore, 

the weighted average cost is the total cost of all units subsequent to the 

latest purchase, divided by their total number of units available. 

 

Sec. 9. Perpetual Inventory Method. Supplies and materials purchased 

for inventory purpose shall be recorded using the perpetual inventory 



63 

 

system, resulting in a more accurate inventory records and a running total 

for the cost of goods sold in each period.  The system requires accounting 

records to show the amount of inventory on hand at all times through the 

maintenance of the SLC (Appendix 57) by the Accounting Division/Unit 

and Stock Card (SC) (Appendix 58) by the Supply and/or Property 

Division/Unit for each item in stock. Regular purchases shall be coursed 

through the inventory account and issues thereof shall be recorded as they 

take place except for supplies and materials purchased out of Petty Cash 

Fund (PCF) for immediate use or on emergency cases which shall be 

charged directly to the appropriate expense accounts. 

 

i. Variance between the Inventory Schedule and RPCI – P33,075,665.87 

2.27. The Inventories held for Consumption account balance totaling 
P79,253,833.04 as of December 31, 2020 consists of the Office Supplies 

Inventory, Accountable Forms, Plates and Stickers Inventory, Medical, 

Dental and Laboratory Supplies Inventory and Construction Materials 

Inventory amounting to P24,716,190.65, P54,473,214.28, P23,125.00 and 

P41,303.11, respectively. 

 

2.28. Audit of the Inventories account balances shows discrepancies between the 
records of the Accounting Division and the Procurement and Supply Division 

(PSD) totaling P33,075,665.87.  Details are as follows:

2.29. One of the causes of the discrepancy is due to the different inventory valuation 
methods used by the Accounting Division and PSD. It is noted that while 

Accounting Division applied the weighted average method in the current and 

prior years, the PSD is using specific identification method and started to use 

the weighted average method just recently for its inventory valuation on the 

last purchased items per PSD record. 

 

ii. Unaccounted Inventory items – P25,148,237.30 

 

2.30. A review of the balances per books and per RPCI also disclosed Inventory 
items totaling P25,148,237.30, which were not found during the year-end 

inventory count but were recorded in the Accounting records.  

 



64 

 

iii. Unrecorded Inventory items per Accounting records -  P2,391,129.61 

 

2.31. We also noted items of Inventory in the RPCI totaling P2,391,129.61, which 
were not included in the Inventory Schedule per Accounting Division. Some 

of the items have no corresponding items in the Unified Accounts Coding 

System (UACS) Object Codes to credit such issuances and others were 

recorded in different account descriptions, thus resulting in the 

understatement of the Inventories account balance.

iv. Unreconciled CY 2004 SL carry-over balances of the account Office 

Supplies Inventory– P5,400,962.07 

2.32. As reiterated in the CY 2019 and still not yet addressed is the balance in the 
SL for Office Supplies Inventory account described as “Unreconciled 

Balance” without detailed breakdown. The breakdown as to the type of 

Inventories accounts cannot be determined due to the absence of SLC prior to 

the implementation of the e-NGAS. 

 

v. Existence of negative quantity and unit cost in Inventory Schedule 
amounting to P1,499,281.32, understating the appropriate Inventories  

account. 

2.33. Sections 9 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I states that: 
 

Sec. 9. Perpetual Inventory Method. The supplies and materials purchased 

for inventory purpose shall be recorded using perpetual inventory system, 



65 

 

resulting in a more accurate inventory records and a running total for the 

cost of goods sold in each period. The system requires accounting records 

to show the amount of inventory on hand at all times through the 

maintenance of the SLC by the Accounting Division/Unit and Stock Card 

(SC) by the Supply and/or Property Division/Unit for each item in stock. 

Regular purchases shall be coursed through the inventory account and 

issues thereof shall be recorded as they take place except for supplies and 

materials purchased out of Petty Cash Fund (PCF) for immediate use or on 

emergency cases which shall be charged directly to the appropriate expenses 

accounts.  

 

2.34. Verification of the Inventory Schedule disclosed that there were Inventory 
items with negative balances and unit cost amounting to P1,499,281.32. 

Existence of some of the items were also doubtful as some were not included 

in the RPCI.   

 

2.35. We recommended that Management require the Accounting Division 
and PSD to: 

 

a. reconcile regularly their respective records and effect the 
adjustments to arrive at reliable balances at yearend; 

 

b. record the receipt and issuance of inventory items on time and keep 
the detailed records thereof; and 

 

c. coordinate to ensure that inventories are recorded in the appropriate 
Inventories account or Expenses account when an item of inventory 

is delivered or issued. 

 

2.36. Management comments are as follows: 
 

 Since the concerned accounts are real or permanent accounts wherein the 
beginning balances are cumulative balances resulting from previous 

years’ transactions, reconciliation of those would require records of prior 

years’ transactions to aid the process. The earliest available records are 

from the year 2015; hence, it entails difficulty in attaining reconciled 

SLC and SC records. An email was sent to COA-ASDOSO on  

November 16, 2020 to seek assistance from them in retrieving the old e-

NGAS back-up database.  

 

 The lack of dedicated personnel in the Accounting Division who can be 
exclusively assigned to the reconciliation of the accounts has affected the 

completion of the reconciliation.  

 

 A meeting with the TWG–AOM was conducted on  March 30, 2021, 
which was participated by the various concerned officials and 



66 

 

employees. Among the discussion was the proposal to seek assistance 

from Regional Accountants in recording JEVs in e-NGAS while on 

remote to give ample time for the Accounting Division to focus in 

reconciliation of records from CY 2015 and years thereafter as a strategy 

to address this matter promptly and fully. 

 

    Auditor’s Rejoinder 

 

2.37. Management comments are duly noted. The emphasis given by the 
Management on the reconciliation of inventory records can strengthen its 

accountability over the Agency’s asset. Moreover, improving the accuracy of 

asset records will affect positively its stewardship of government funds not 

only in the aspect of accountability, but in the areas of fund use and decision-

making. 

 

Construction in Progress – Buildings and Other Structures 

 

d) The Construction in Progress – Building and Other Structures of 
P124,311,914.16 is of doubtful validity  due to the inclusion of: i) DPWH-

undertaken projects with unknown status of P31,328,577.89; ii) non-

moving projects from CY 2015-2020 totaling P6,968,602.00; and iii) 

undocumented unreconciled balance of P891,060.84. 

 

2.38. Section 8 (g), Chapter 10 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I, which states that: 
 

“During the construction period, all expenses incurred in relation 

to the construction of the PPE shall be taken up in the books as 

Construction in Progress (CIP) with appropriate asset 

classification. As soon as the construction is completed, the 

“Construction in Progress” account shall be reclassified to the 

proper asset account. Likewise, all expenses such as interests, 

license fees, etc., during the construction period shall be capitalized.  

 

If the project is to be constructed by administration, the procurement 

of labor and materials shall be in compliance with provisions of RA 

No. 9184 and its Revised Implementing Rules and 

Regulations…xxx” 

 

2.36. Chapter 3, Description of Accounts, of GAM for NGAs, Volume III, provides 
that CIP-Buildings and Other Structures account is used to recognize the 

accumulated cost or other appropriate value of buildings and other structures 

which are still in the process of construction or development. Credit this 

account for reclassification to the appropriate Buildings and Other Structures 

account upon completion. 

 



67 

 

2.37. Verification of Schedule of CIP- Buildings and Other Structure, contracts, 
vouchers and other supporting documents disclosed the following 

observations: 

 

i.    Inclusion of DPWH-undertaken projects  with unknown status  
 

2.39. We noted the existence of PRC projects undertaken by the DPWH that were 
recorded in the CIP- Buildings and Other Structures account totaling 

P31,328,577.89 with no status report. Details are as follows:

ii. Non-moving projects from CY 2015- 2020 -  P6,968,602.00 
 

2.40. Review of the SLs disclosed projects totaling P6,968,602.00, which remained 
in the CIP account and have not yet been reclassified to their appropriate PPE 

accounts due to inadequate Accounting records as basis of validating the 

completeness and the  proper recording thereof.

iii. Undocumented and “Unreconciled balance” of  P891,060.84 
 

2.41. Finally, we noted an account described as “Unreconciled Balance” amounting 
to P891,060.84 which nature can no longer be determined due to the absence 

of documents, thus the balance of CIP- Buildings and Other Structures 

accounts in the Accounting records is of doubtful validity. 

 

2.42. We recommended, and Management agreed, to require the 
Administrative Division, End-user, and Accounting Division to 

coordinate on the submission of documents on completed projects and 



68 

 

locate pertinent records regarding the dormant projects, DPWH 

projects, and unreconciled balances for proper recording in the books. 

 

2.43. Management commented as follows: 
 

 The Accounting Division will coordinate with Administrative Service to 
request the latter to provide us the copies of Certificates of Completion 

and serve as our basis in preparing the necessary reclassification entry to 

record them to their appropriate PPE accounts. 

 

 The amounts included in the CIP account are the cumulative balance of 
progress payments made amounting to P1,361,520.00 and P5,607,082.00 

for the contractors MC Torio Construction and Melda Madrid Hardware 

Center, Inc. for the labor and materials, respectively, concerning the 

construction of RO No. II Office Building located at Regional 

Government Center, Carig Sur, Tuguegarao City, Cagayan. Further 

clarification with the concerned RO was made by the Planning, 

Management and Financial Service in its email message on December 

14, 2020, for the submission of additional documents for reference and 

recollection due to the lapse of time.  

 

 The unreconciled amount is the beginning balance since the 
implementation of e-NGAS way back year in 2004. The Accounting 

Division was unable to validate the existence of the said completed 

infrastructure project due to the unavailability of source documents. The 

Commission is also looking into requesting the write-off of the various 

unreconciled beginning balance accounts and may seek guidance from 

your good office. 

 

PPE Accounts 

 

e) The PPE account balance of P565,142,339.94 is unreliable as it includes:   
i) an account labeled as “Unreconciled Balance”  with negative carrying 

amount of P23,060,857.52; ii) PPE items with no acquisition dates 

amounting to P98,868.40; and iii) PPE items with erroneous/negative  

acquisition costs of P3,019,563.87. 

 

2.44. Chapter 2, Section 58 of PD No. 1445 provides that:  
 

 “Audit of Assets - the examination and audit of assets shall be performed 

with a view to ascertaining their existence, ownership, valuation and 

encumbrances as well as the propriety of items composing the respective 

asset accounts; determining their agreement with records; proving the 

accuracy of such records; ascertaining if the assets were utilized 

economically, efficiently and effectively; and evaluating the adequacy of 

controls over the accounts.” 
 



69 

 

2.45. Section 3, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, provides the criteria 
for the recognition that the cost of an item of PPE shall be recognized as assets 

if, and only if: 

 

 It is probable that the future economic benefits or service potential 
associated with the item will flow to the entity; 

 The cost of fair value of the item can be measured reliably; 

 Beneficial ownership and control clearly rest with the government; 

 The asset is used to achieve government objectives; and  

 It meets the capitalization threshold of P15,000.00. 
 

i. Unreconciled balance with negative carrying amount of P23,060,857.52 
 

2.46. We noted a balance in the PPE accounts described as “Unreconciled Balance” 
which existence can no longer be determined rendering the balance of PPE in 

the Accounting records doubtful, as follows:

iii. PPE items with erroneous/negative  acquisition cost – P3,019,563.87 
 

2.48. Further, we noted that there were items in the PPE accounts that have zero or 
negative acquisition cost, resulting in positive/negative net book value as 

summarized below:

Furniture and Fixtures (231,246.51) 

Total 3,019,563.87 

 

2.49. We recommended and Management agreed to require the:  
 

a. Accounting Division and PSD to reconcile the balances of the PPE 
accounts, provide the relative information on the acquisition cost 

and date of the identified PPE and after the review/ reconciliation, 

effect the correction/adjustments to arrive at reliable balances at 

yearend; and 

 

b. Accountant to identify the unreconciled and negative balances by 
referring to the earliest available records. 

 

2.50. Management comments are as follows: 
 

 A meeting with the TWG–AOM was conducted on  March 30, 2021, 
which was participated by the various concerned officials and 

employees. Among the discussion was the proposal to seek assistance 

from Regional Accountants in recording JEV in e-NGAS while on 

remote to give ample time for the Accounting Division to focus in the 

reconciliation of records from CY 2015 and years thereafter as a strategy 

to address this matter promptly and fully.  

 

 Aside from the errors that might have been committed in the encoding 
of the JEVs in the derecognition of the PPE, the Commission is also 

looking into the possibility that the property number was not made 

available, mismatched or incorrectly supplied, particularly for items that 

were procured way back. Thus, the recording was not properly done on 

the already disposed items, leaving as such, which still exists in the 

books. Nonetheless, the reconciliation of the record for 2015 and years 

thereafter are being handled by the Accounting Division and shall 



71 

 

submit a report to your office to address that noted observations not later 

than  April 19, 2021. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder 

 

2.51. Management comments are duly noted. The Audit Team will expect 
Management to exercise strong oversight over the implementation of our 

recommendations as well as the actions that Management has committed to 

address the audit issues noted. 

 

Advances 

 

f) Agency’s insufficient observance of the laws, rules, regulations in the 
granting, utilization, and liquidation of cash advances under COA 

Circular No. 97-002 and Section 6 of COA Circular No. 2016-005 

resulted in the a.) discrepancy of P16,013.16 between the Unliquidated 

Cash Advance Report and FSs as at December 31, 2020 and b.) presence 

of unreconciled/negative balances totaling P579,317.27 in the accounts’ 

subsidiary ledgers. 

 

i. Discrepancy of P16,013.16 between Unliquidated Cash Advance Report 
and FSs 

 

2.52. Section 6 of COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016 provides 
the following: 

 

6.1    All government entities shall conduct regular monitoring and analysis 

of receivable accounts to ensure that these are collected when these 

become due and demandable and that cash advances and fund transfers 

are liquidated within the prescribed period depending upon their 

nature and purpose; and 

 

6.2   All government entities shall prepare the schedule of all receivables, 

unliquidated cash advances, and fund transfers as of December 31, 

2015 and quarterly thereafter.  

 

2.53. Comparison between the submitted Status of Unliquidated Cash Advances 
(SUCA) and the corresponding balances per Statement of Financial Position 

showed discrepancy amounting to P16,013.16,   details as follows:

ii. Presence of unreconciled/negative balances totaling P 579,317.27 in the 
accounts’ subsidiary ledgers 

 

2.54. Section 6 of COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016 provides 
that: 

 

6.2 All government entities shall prepare the schedule of all receivables, 

unliquidated cash advances, and fund transfers as of December 31, 2015 and 

quarterly thereafter. (see Appendix 55 of, GAM for NGAs, Vol. II). 

 

2.55. The Advances account has a balance of P19,691,304.21 as of December 31, 
2020, however, examination of the SLs of the Advances accounts disclosed 

negative balances totaling P579,317.27 as shown below: 

 

                       Table 35. Schedule of Advances Accounts with Abnormal/Negative Balances

Advances to Special Disbursing Officer (0.50) 
Advances to Officers and Employees (1,763.00)

2.56. These negative balances have been offset against the total balance of the 
Advances of P19,691,304.21 as of December 31, 2020, resulting in  its 

doubtful accuracy. Based on inquiry the negative balances are for 

reconciliation to the respective Accountable Officers’ (AO) records. 

 

2.57. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief 
Accountant to reconcile the negative balances noted and determine the 

nature thereof. 

 

2.58. Management commented that the Accounting Division, Central Office issued 
a Memorandum on March 19, 2021, requesting the concerned AO (providing 

copies of their SLs as reference) to reconcile their respective SL transactions. 

Thereafter, the Accounting Division will validate their submitted compliances 

and prepare the appropriate adjusting entry, if any. They also commented that 

during reconciliation of the FSs and SUCA, the variance has been identified 

as an adjustment in the liquidation. A corrected SUCA shall be submitted by 



73 

 

the Accounting Division to coincide with the correct account balance in the 

books of accounts. 

 

   Auditor’s Rejoinder 

 

2.59. The Audit Team will look into the results of the initial plan of continuously 
working with the AOs in the reconciliation procedure. 

 

Liabilities 

 

g) The reliability of the Liabilities totaling P83,077,445.53 cannot be 
ascertained as it included Accounts Payable and Other Payables with 

combined  negative balances of P(121,124.68) and Inter-Agency Payables 

Inter-Agency Payables with unreconciled/abnormal debit balances in 

SLs totaling P170,058,599.07 due to insufficient analysis and 

reconciliation of the recorded transactions. 

 

i. Accounts Payable and Other Payables with negative balances – 
P(121,124.68) 

 

2.60. Our analysis showed debit balances included in the accounts as of December 
31, 2020. These abnormal or debit balances for payable accounts are 

indicative of overpayments of expenses or goods already delivered and/or 

services already rendered. It also indicates non-set-up of payable and 

corresponding expense, which is contrary to generally accepted accounting 

principles. Details are as follows:

2.61. Section 2.80 of the BIR Revenue Regulations No. 2-98 provides that “(1) In 
general, the employer shall be responsible for the withholding and remittance 

of the correct amount of tax required to be deducted and withheld xxx. (2) The 

employer who required to collect, account for and remit any tax imposed by 

the NIRC, as amended, who willfully fails to collect such tax, or account for

thereof, shall in addition to other penalties, provided for in the code, as 

amended, be liable, upon conviction, to penalty equal to the amount of the tax 

not collected nor accounted for or remitted.” 

 

2.62. Furthermore, paragraph 4 of the Revenue Memorandum Circular (RMC) No. 
23-2012 requires that the responsible officials and employees, as withholding 

agents, “should see to it that taxes withheld are accordingly remitted on or 

before their due dates using the prescribed monthly/quarterly withholding tax 

remittance returns, together with other attachments, where applicable” 

 

2.63. Sections 5(c), 6(b) and 7 of RA No. 8291 known as the Government Service 
Insurance Act of 1977, respectively, state: 

 

2.64. Sections 5(c). It shall be mandatory and compulsory for all employers to 
include the payment of contributions in their annual appropriations. Penal 

sanctions shall be imposed upon employers who fail to include the payment 

of contributions in their annual appropriations or otherwise fail to remit the 

accurate/exact amount of contributions on time, or delay the remittance of 

premium contributions to the GSIS. The heads of offices and agencies shall 

administratively liable for non-remittance or delayed remittance of premium 

contributions to GSIS. 

 

2.65. Section 7. Agencies which delay the remittance of any and all monies due to 
the GSIS shall be charged interest as may be prescribed by the Board but not 

less than two (2%) simple interest per month. Such interest shall be paid by 

the employers concerned. 

 

2.66. Section 23 of RA No. 9679 dated July 21, 2009 or An Act Further 
Strengthening the HDMF, and for Other Purposes provides, among others, 

the immediate remittance of the contributions and HDMF Circular No. 275 

dated January 22, 2010 states that “Employers shall remit the required 

monthly employer and employee contributions to the nearest Pag-IBIG 

branch or its authorized collecting banks, together with the duly 

accomplished Membership Contribution Remittance Form (MCRF), in 

accordance with the following remittance schedule: xxx Failure or refusal of 

the employer to pay or to remit the contributions herein prescribed shall not 

prejudice the right of the covered member to the benefits under the Fund. 

Such employer shall be charged a penalty equivalent to 1/10 of 1% per day 

of delay of the amount due starting on the first day immediately following the 

due date until the date of full settlement.” 

 

2.67. Paragraph b of Title III of the Revised IRR of the National Health Insurance 
Act of 1995 (RA No. 7875, as amended by RA No. 9241) states that “the 

monthly premium contribution of employed members shall be remitted by the 

employer on or before the tenth (10th) calendar day of the month following 

the applicable month for which the payment is due and applicable.” 



75 

 

 

2.68. Further, Title III, Rule II of the revised IRR of the National Health Insurance 
Act of 2013, remittance of contribution shall be mandatory for all members. 

It shall be made to PhilHealth offices or to any of the accredited collecting 

agents. Failure to timely remit the appropriate premium contribution shall be 

subject to interest and penalties as prescribed by the corporation without 

prejudice to other applicable penalties herein provided. 

 

2.69. Our account analysis revealed that the Due to BIR, Due to Pag-IBIG and Due 
to PhilHealth accounts totaling P3,462,962.17 included unadjusted negative 

balances in their individual SLs in the sum of P170,058,599.07, broken down 

as follows:

2.70. The presence of abnormal or negative balances of accounts in the financial 
reports does not only render the validity and reliability of the various accounts 

doubtful but also presents misleading or inaccurate information to intended 

users. The negative balances decrease the exact actual outstanding payables 

as at reporting period. Moreover, these negative balances warranted 

reconciliation and adjustments because of the materiality of the amount and 

their dormancy.  

 

2.71. We recommended, and Management agreed, to require the Accounting 
Division to analyze the accounts with abnormal or debit balances, 

determine the causes of negative balances in the SLs,  make necessary 

reconciliation and make the necessary adjustments to come up with the 

corrected balance in the FSs. 

 

2.72. Management commented that one of the procedures in the pre-audit, which 
the Accounting Division strictly observes is the correctness and 

appropriateness of the amount of DV being processed. The said observation 

of accounts with negative balances does not result from overpayment of 

expenses but perhaps under recording of amounts as payable. We shall 

prepare the required adjusting entry after the reconciliation of available 

records have been completed. 

 

2.73. Management further commented that in CY 2018, with the objective of 
making the reconciliation easier, recording the establishment of payable and 

subsequent remittances for the abovementioned statutory contributions was 

improved utilizing the SL features of e-NGAS for each officer and employee. 

The recording of remittances to the SL account which is different from the SL 

where the establishment was originally posted might be one of the factors 

which contributed to the negative balances noted in the SLs. Likewise, due to 

various types of loan which a member can avail, it would entail a high 

probability that an error might have been encountered in recording the 

establishment and remittances to two different SLs but will never decrease 

the exact actual outstanding payables as at reporting period as these would 

still be recorded within the same general ledger (GL) account contrary to the 

noted exceptions as mentioned. Prospectively, to prevent a repetition of this, 

the personnel in-charge of recording payments shall validate first the SL 

account used in the establishment of payable. The reconciliation is already 

being undertaken by the Accounting Division to address this observation. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder 

 

2.74. Management comments noted. The abnormal balances may not have an effect 
on the total balance of the GL account, however, the mispostings to the wrong 

SL could result  in  the  inaccuracy of the account of the affected creditor/s. It 

should be emphasized that the SLs are the subsidiary records or details of the 

balance in the GL, hence should always be reconciled.

Service and Business Income 

 

h) Internal control weaknesses in the recording/accounting of online 
collections and deposits resulted in the: i) unreconciled difference 

of P24,922.00 between Landbank ePayment Facility (Link.BizPortal) 

reported collections from successful transactions and Landbank List of 

Deposits; and ii) discrepancy of P1,620.00 in the amount reported by the 

NCR Cash Division and recorded per e-NGAS.  Also, the recording of 

remittances with the BTr  from Electronic Payment Service Providers 

and over-the-counter collections totaling P331,862,533.73  were not 

supported by Certifications  of Remittance to validate the receipt thereof 

by the BTr and the accuracy of recording made by PRC. Moreover, the 

Service and Business Income account is rendered doubtful due to the 

current practice of recording income from online collections based on the 

List of Deposited Collection. 
 

2.75. Section 15, Chapter 2 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, provides the fair 
presentation of the FSs. 

 

i. Unreconciled difference of P24,922.00 between Landbank ePayment 
Facility (Link.BizPortal)-reported collections from successful 

transactions and Landbank List of Deposited Collections 

 

2.76. Comparison between the generated reports of collection from Link.BizPortal 
and the List of Deposited Collections from Landbank We Access System 

showed unreconciled discrepancies of P24,922.00. Details as follows:

December  1,138,316.00   1,055,046.00   83,270.00  

Total  5,974,646.00   5,949,724.00   24,922.00  

 

2.77. Regular reconciliation between the records coming from both systems is 
needed to determine the nature of the variances and to facilitate proper 

recording of income. As noted, the basis of the Accounting Division in 

recording income is the actual amount of deposit per List of Deposited 

Collections instead of the Daily Report of Collection, thus undeposited 

collections could not be determined.  



78 

 

 

ii. Discrepancies in the amount reported by the NCR Cash Division and 
recorded per e-NGAS 

 

2.78. The Audit Team noted that income from Verification and Authentication Fees 
and other Service Income reported by the NCR Cash Division for the month 

of July 2020 and deposits for the month of September 2020 were incorrectly 

recorded by the Accounting Division as of December 31, 2020. Details are 

shown below:

iii. Absence of Certifications of Remittance of remitted collections with  the 
BTr. totaling P331,862,533.73 

 

2.79. Collections of fees and charges were reported by CO-Cash Division as 
remitted to the account of BTr.-PRC Clearing Account No. 3402-2696-09 

with Landbank. 

 

2.80. Out of the total reported collections of P459,616,558.73 by Cash Division, 
remittances to BTr of collections amounting to P281,988,879.67 and 

P49,873,654.05 from electronic payment service providers and over-the-

counter collections, respectively, appeared to be not acknowledged by the 

BTr due to the absence of BTr. certifications of remittance as of this date.  

 

iv. Doubtful balance of Service and Business Income accounts– Examination 
Fees, Registration Fee, Licensing Fees, Fines and Penalties – Service 

Income, Verification and Authentication Fees, Other Service Income, and 

Legal Research Fee of P6,024,000.37 caused by recording of collections 

based on the Report of Deposits instead of the Consolidated Daily Report 

of Collection.  

 

2.81. Section 39, Chapter 5 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I, provides that “at the 
close of the business day, the Collecting Officers shall prepare the Report of 

Collections and Deposits (RCD) for submission to Accounting Office/Unit. 

The report lists the ORs issued in numerical sequence including cancelled 

ones.” 

 



79 

 

2.82. While Item 10, Section 40, Chapter 5 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I, further 
provides that based on the RCD, the Bookkeeper prepares the JEV for the 

recording of collections and deposits. 

 

2.83. Under the current processing set-up, clients who availed of PRC services have 
to apply and pay the same online using the available payment channels thru 

Landbank, GCash, and PayMaya. These Electronic Payment Service 

Providers (EPSPs) remit on behalf of PRC the total daily collections of PRC 

fees not later than 10:00AM of the next banking day to BTr-PRC Clearing 

Account with Landbank of the Philippines.   Moreover, the EPSPs have the 

obligation to prepare and submit to PRC the Daily Report of Collections and 

List of Deposited Collections (LDC) also on a daily basis. Currently, the Daily 

Report of Collections generated thru the portals of LandbankLinkbiz and 

PayMaya do not tally with the List of Deposited Collections. Hence, the 

current practice of the PRC Accounting Division in recording 

collections/income based on the deposits reported resulted in inaccurate 

reporting thereof as the same may cover previous periods/months’ 

collections. For instance, cut-off procedures conducted revealed that 

collections for the period ended December 31, 2020 were understated 

by P3,036,574.87 as a result of recording collections based on the LDC. 

Details are as follows:

2.84. Moreover, verification of the monthly JEVs taking up the collections thru 
Link.BizPortal and PayMaya Online Checkout Services (POCS), for the 

period January to December 2020 also showed discrepancies/variances 

between the Online Collection Reports and the recorded amounts totaling 

P2,987,425.50 likewise understating the Business Income by the same 

amount. Summary of variances is shown below:

2.85. The variance was also due to the failure of the Accounting Division to record 
collections based on the Daily Reports of Collections generated from 

Link.BizPortal and from Paymaya. Instead, collections were recorded based 

on the actual amount of deposits as shown in the List of Deposited Collection.  

 

2.86. The effects on the income accounts of the above deficiencies are summarized 
in the following table:

101,170.37      6,024,000.37  

 

2.87. We recommended, and Management agreed, to require the Accounting 
and Cash Divisions to: 

 

a. effect the necessary corrections/accounting entries   for the 
deficiencies noted on the collections and income   to come up with the 

correct balance in the FSs; 

 

b. reconcile the discrepancy found on the unremitted collections of 
P24,922.00 with Landbank and demand immediately to deposit the 

same to the BTr.; and 

 

c. follow up the Certifications of Remittance with the  BTr  and submit 
the same to the Audit Team. 

 

2.88. Management comments are as follows: 
 

 Previously, PRC had the Over-the-Counter (OTC) payment as a mode of 
payment offered only to transacting public in PRC premises. Thus, the 

entries to record the Collections and Deposit in eNGAS are as follows:  

 

Cash - Collecting Officer (CCO) xxx  

Income / Revenue xxx  

To record collection of service income for the month.  

 

Cash – Treasury/Agency Deposit, Regular xxx  

Cash - Collecting Officer xxx  

To record deposit of collection to AGDB.  

 

 Upon the adoption of Electronic Payment and Collection System (EPCS) 
sometime in 2015, the accounting entry to record online collection is as 

follows;  

 

Cash – Treasury/Agency Deposit, Regular xxx  

Income / Revenue xxx  

To record the deposit of online collection to AGDB. 

 

 Since there was no identified accountable CCO for the online collection, 
we believed that the above cited entry was correct as a logical conclusion. 



82 

 

Further, the Accounting Division greatly relied upon to the List of 

Deposited Collection submitted by the Cash Division for the 

completeness and correctness of Collection/Deposit being recorded since 

they have the access to the Link.biz and POCS portal. It is worthy to note 

also that a system error with Link.bizPortal was noted by the Cash 

Division upon generation of report from their system. Likewise, the Cash 

Division will be submitting a separate response to further elaborate the 

error and to address the noted deficiencies.  

 

 The Commission takes cognizance of the recommendation cited and 
respectfully seek the concurrence of COA on the illustrative entries as 

shown below to record the online collection prospectively and as 

reference by the Accounting Division in the preparation of the necessary 

adjusting entries. 

 

Other Receivables xxx  

Income / Revenue xxx  

To record the online collection for the month.  

 

Cash – Treasury/Agency Deposit, Regular xxx  

Other Receivables xxx  

To record the deposit of online collection to AGDB.  

 

  A separate SL account for all Payment Channel will be maintained to 
monitor the collection and deposit thereof. The Accounting Division will 

be requesting also for the access to Link.biz and POCS for verification 

purposes. 

 

 Anent the issue of non-recognition by the BTr of the collections, they 
will communicate with the BTr. and request for its recognition of the 

total reported collection and the corresponding issuance of a BTr 

certification thereof. 

 

 In relation to the incorrect classification of income, they informed that 
the amount recorded in the eNGAS is reconciled with the revised RCD 

submitted by PRC-NCR (FAD). 

 

          Auditor’s Rejoinder 

 

2.89. We note Management’s comments. In addition to its proposed measure of 
recording online collections, PRC should also bring to the attention of the 

Service Providers the discrepancies in the reported collections and the actual 

remittance/deposits to the BTr. As per MOA, these discrepancies should also 

be reported to the BTr and should be deducted from the service providers’ 

Guaranty Funds, if appropriate.

COMPLIANCE AUDIT 

 

Incomplete documentation of financial transactions 

 

3. Financial transactions of NCR, ROs II, V, VIII and XI totaling P1,995,026.69 
were recorded in the PRC books despite the lack of documentary requirements, 

contrary to Section 4(6) of PD No. 1445, Sections 15 and 16, Chapter 8, Section 

39, Chapter 5 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, and pertinent provisions of COA 

Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012, thus casting doubts on the legality 

and propriety of the transactions. 

 

3.1. Section 4(6) of PD No. 1445 provides that “Claims against government funds 

shall be supported with complete documentation.” 

3.2. GAM for NGAs, Volume I, states the following: 

 Section 39, Chapter 5, on Reporting of Collections and Deposits, 
provides that RCD shall be supported by documentary evidence such as 

duplicate copies of ORs and validated deposit slips. 

 

 Sections 15 and 16, Chapter 8, on Procedures in the Receipt, Inspection, 
Acceptance and Recording of Inventory Items, provide that delivered 

inventory items are inspected and supported by Inspection and 

Acceptance Report (IAR). Meanwhile, Purchase Request is prepared for 

items not available on stock. 

3.3. COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 provides the revised 
guidelines and documentary requirements for common government 

transactions and states that sufficient documentations are to be submitted to 

establish validity of claim. 

3.4. COA Circular No. 77-61 dated September 26, 1977, otherwise known as the 

Manual of Fuel Consumption of Government Vehicles, also provides, thus: 

Par. 1 – Section 2: The use of government motor vehicles should be 

controlled through properly accomplished and duly approved Driver’s Trip 

Tickets (Appendix A) which will be serially numbered, a summary of 

which shall be made at the end of the month in a Monthly Report of Official 

Travels, for audit purposes; 

 

Section 4: Monthly Report of Fuel Consumption of government motor 

transportation (Appendix G) shall be submitted to the Auditor for 

verification purposes to determine the reasonableness of fuel consumed 

during the period.” 

 



84 

 

3.5. Examination and verification of the NCR-Cash Division’s collections and 
remittances disclosed deposits totaling P1,836,562.00, which were not 

supported by bank-validated deposit slips. Moreover, audit of paid 

transactions of  ROs V, VIII and XI disclosed that disbursements totaling 

P191,939.69 were not supported with necessary documents/information, 

which rendered the transactions of doubtful validity.  The details are as

4. Non-submission/preparation of property reports by the CO and RO V and 
improperly maintained Registries of Allotment and Obligations and 

Disbursements (RAOD) – MOOE and the Obligation Request and Status (ORS) 

by RO XI are  contrary to PD No. 1445, Sections 15 and 16, Chapter 3 and 

Sections 38 and 40.d,  Chapter 10 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I and pertinent 

COA Circulars, thus affecting the timely evaluation of the ROs’ property 

accountabilities during the year and the accuracy of  disclosure of budget 

information in the financial reports. 

 

4.1. Section 122 of PD No. 1445 states the power of the Commission and the 

penalty clause/consequence of non-submission of documents/reports needed. 

a. Whenever deemed necessary in the exigencies of the service, the 
Commission may under regulations issued by it require the agency heads, 

chief accountants, budget officers, cashiers, disbursing officers, 

administrative or personnel officers, and other responsible officials of the 

various agencies to submit trial balances, physical inventory reports, 



86 

 

current plantilla of personnel and such other reports as may be necessary 

for the exercise of its functions. 

 

b. Failure on the part of the official concerned to submit the documents and 
reports mentioned herein shall automatically cause the suspension of 

payment of their salaries until they shall have complied with the 

requirements of the Commission.  

 

c. No appropriation authorized in the GAA shall be available to pay the 
salary of any official or employee who violates the provisions of this 

section, without prejudice to any disciplinary action that may be 

instituted against such official or employee. 

 

4.2. GAM for NGAs, Volume I, states the following:  

 Chapter 3 – 
 

 Section 15 provides for the procedures in recording obligations in 
the appropriate RAOD through the ORS. 

 Section 16 also provides that the disbursement shall be posted under 
the “Payment” column Section C of the ORS based on the Report of 

Checks Issued/Report of ADA Issued (RADAI) and recorded in the 

appropriate RAOD. 

 

 Chapter 10 – 
 

 Section 38 provides that the entity shall have a periodic physical 
count of PPE, which shall be done annually and presented in the 

Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment 

(RPCPPE) as at December 31 of each year. This shall be submitted 

to the Auditor concerned not later than January 31 of the following 

year. Equipment found at station and losses discovered during the 

physical count shall be reported to the Accounting Division/Unit for 

proper accounting/recording. 

 

 Section 40.d requires, among others, that all unserviceable property 
shall be reported in the Inventory and Inspection Report for 

Unserviceable Property (IIRUP), which is shown as Appendix 74 in 

GAM for NGAs, Volume II. 

4.3. For CY 2020, the CO and RO V have not complied with the preparation of 
the updated prescribed reports and the timely submission of documents and 

reports that prevented the timely verification of property accountabilities and 

other related transactions, thus, casting doubt on the completeness and 

propriety of the recorded PPE in the books.

4.4. Moreover, in RO XI, Section/Box C of the ORS and the RAOD-MOOE for 
recording of Disbursements and Adjustment of Obligations was not properly 

filled out and updated, respectively, inconsistent with the foregoing Sections 

15 and 16 of the GAM for NGAs, Vol. I, thus resulting in improper 

monitoring of budgets and inaccurate disclosure and presentation of the 

budget in the financial reports. 

4.5. We recommended, and Management agreed, to direct the: 

 

a. Property Officers of the CO and RO V to strictly comply with the 
preparation and submission of property reports in compliance with 

GAM for NGAs and other relevant COA rules and regulations within 

the prescribed period and suspend the payments of salaries of those 

responsible AOs who failed to submit reports on time until they have 

complied with the requirements on the submission of reports. 

 

b. Budget Officer of RO XI to properly fill out the ORS and update 
RAOD-MOOE for monitoring and appropriate disclosure in the 

financial reports. 

 

Unremitted  excess BAC Fund to the BTr 

 

5. The balance of CIB-LCCA with an ending balance of P1,703,196.54, designated 
as “BAC Fund,” was unremitted to the BTr. contrary to Section 6.2 of Budget 

Circular No. 2004-5A dated October 7, 2005. 

 

5.1. Section 6.2 of Budget Circular No. 2004-5A provides that pursuant to the 
DOF-DBM-COA Permanent Committee Resolution No. 2005-2 dated June 

2005, all agencies are authorized to treat the collections from the sources 

identified in Item 6.1, hereof as trust receipts to be used exclusively for the 

payment of Honoraria and overtime pay herein authorized. Agencies may 

utilize up to one hundred percent (100%) of the said collections for the 

payment of Honoraria and overtime pay subject to the guidelines in Item 5.0 

of this Circular. Any excess in the amount collected shall be remitted by 

NGAs to the BTr. In the case of GOCCs and LGUs, the same shall form part 

of their corporate or local government funds, respectively. 

 



88 

 

5.2. Our audit revealed that the CIB - LCCA with an ending balance of 
P1,703,196.54 under BTr.-PRC LBP Current Account No. 0012-1171-24 was 

designated as “BAC Fund” wherein the receipt of proceeds from sale of bid 

documents and the payment of Honoraria of BAC members were recorded. 

However, the year-end balance of the account representing excess collection 

was not remitted to BTr, contrary to DOF-DBM-COA Permanent Committee 

Resolution No. 2005-2 dated June 2005.   

 

5.3. We recommended, and Management agreed, to remit to the BTr the 
remaining balance of BAC Fund in accordance with Section 6.2 of DBM 

BC No. 2004-5A. 
 

 

Deficiencies in the Grant, Utilization and Liquidation of Cash Advances  

 

6. The Agency’s insufficient observance of the laws, rules, and regulations in the 
granting, utilization, and liquidation of cash advances (CAs) under COA 

Circular No. 97-002 and Section 6 of COA Circular No. 2016-005 resulted in: a) 

unsettled balance from employees who resigned or no longer connected with the 

agency totaling P287,798.78; b) granting of additional CAs despite unliquidated 

previous advances; and c) disbursement for MOOE were paid in cash instead of 

using checks; d) Cash advances for MOOE deposited in the AOs personal 

account; and e) grant of cash advance in excess of two-month requirement, thus 

exposing public funds to possible risk of misuse and recording errors. 

 

6.1. Section 89 of PD No. 1445 provides that “No cash advance shall be given 
unless for a legally authorized specific purpose. A cash advance shall be 

reported on and liquidated as soon as the purpose for which it was given has 

been served. No additional cash advance shall be allowed to any official or 

employee unless the previous cash advance given to him is first settled or a 

proper accounting thereof is made. 

 

6.2. Section 2 of COA Circular No. 97-002 on the Restatement with amendment of 
rules and regulations on the granting, utilization and liquidation of cash 

advances states that: 

 

“Ideally cash should be handled under the general principles of imprest 

fund system, to wit: 

1.  xxx 

2.  All payments must be made by check; and 

3. Only payment in small amounts may be made through the petty 

cash fund. Xxx” 

6.3. Treasury Circular No. 02-2014 dated June 16, 2014 provides guidelines in the 
opening of bank accounts for receipts and MDS disbursements of NGAs. 

 



89 

 

6.4. As per Management’s submitted Status of Unliquidated CAs as of December 
31, 2020, the age of the CAs ranges from less than 90 days to more than three 

years. Details are as follows:

VIII 

The submitted monthly/quarterly budget proposals for the 

field office MOOE is higher than what is actually needed, thus 

excessive. CAs were granted to the SDO of the RO with 

disbursements therefrom being inadequately controlled 

resulting in lapses such as:  

a) utilization of CAs to pay for prior year/month expenses; b) 

use of CA for expenses beyond the indicated months for 

which the funds were intended; and 

c) failure to liquidate the same within the prescribed period 

No data 

 

6.6. We recommended, and Management agreed, to direct the concerned 
Offices to: 

 

a. require the AOs concerned to immediately liquidate/settle their CAs 
and demand the refund of their unused balances; 

 

b. exert immediate settlements of long-overdue unliquidated CAs of 
employees who resigned/are no longer connected with the Agency;  

 

c. refrain from granting additional CAs to the AOs with unliquidated 
balances; and 

 

d. open an MDS account with any authorized government depository 
bank (AGDB) to which fund transfers for MOOE will be deposited; 

use the prescribed DV or Payroll with complete details, instead of 

the PCV in paying the regular and recurring expenses of the Agency. 

 

6.7. Management comments are as follows: 
 

Office Management Comments  

CO A Notice of Unliquidated CA will be sent to AO who have resigned/are no longer 

connected with the PRC thru registered mail or email to the last known address of such 

AO to demand immediate settlement of long overdue unliquidated CAs and further 

comply with COA Circular No. 2016-005. 

Due to limited AO designated by the NCR-FAD and urgency of the purpose of CA, it 

is being allowed provided that the total CA to be requested will not exceed the allowed 

maximum cash accountability pursuant to Cash Management and Control System. 

However, the matter was already coordinated with NCR-FAD and was advised of the 

actions need to be taken in order to prevent this from happening again. Prospectively, 

the Accounting Division will strictly adhere to the Circular. 

RO V The Management commented that they have already opened an MDS account and 

awaiting for the CO’s approval to use the said account. 



91 

 

Office Management Comments  

RO VIII Management already opened an MDS account with LBP, however, they are still 

waiting for further instruction from CO with respect to its implementation. 

 

With regard to the non-submission of budget proposal, the recommendations will be 

presented to the new Budget Officer who assumed his post on January 8, 2021, to 

regulate budgetary requests, utilization, and monitoring. 

 

The underutilization of the cash advances was due to the cancellation of scheduled 

licensure examinations. 

CAR 

The Regional Director, who was previously the Regional Coordinator of PRC Region 

1, requested for the opening of their bank account from PRC CO on February 28, 2019.   

A follow-up was made on March 13, 2019 and November 25, 2020 through the 

Planning, Management and Financial Services (PMFS).  However, up to this date, 

PRC-CAR continuously receives CAs for PRC-Region I. 

 

Further, the electronic Modified Disbursement System (eMDS) for all PRC ROs has 

already been approved but  still waiting for  activation. 

RO II 

Management explained that the weakness in the control system particularly the grant, 

replenishment, utilization and liquidation of the PCF is a room for improvement in the 

procurement process, however, for some Programs, Activities and Projects, the RO was 

only notified by the CO a week before the said activity, thus giving the former 

insufficient time to prepare and procure the materials needed thereby using the Petty 

Cash Fund for immediate purchase. 

 

The Management shall review its current procedures and internal control policies to 

implement changes and commit to comply with your recommendations the soonest. 

 

 

 

Compliance with RA No. 9184 or the Government Procurement Reform Act 

 

7. The procurement process by the CO showed various omissions and practices 
which are not strictly in compliance with the Revised Implementing Rules and 

Regulations (RIRR) of RA No. 9184 and existing COA rules and regulation, thus 

affecting the propriety of the procurement activities for five projects of the 

Agency. 

 

7.1. Clause 17.3 of General Conditions of Contract (GCC) of the bidding 
documents provides that in order to assure that the manufacturing defects 

shall be corrected by the Supplier, a warranty shall be required from the 

Supplier for a minimum period specified in the Special Conditions of the 

Contract (SCC). 

 

7.2.     Moreover, Clause 17.4 of the GCC of the bidding documents provides that 
“xxx. Upon receipt of such notice, the Supplier shall, within the period 

specified in the SCC and with reasonable speed, repair or replace the defective 

Goods or parts thereof, without cost to the Procuring Entity.” 

 



92 

 

7.3. Clause 15.1 of Section II, Instructions to Bidders, provides that “The Bidder 
shall complete the appropriate Schedule of Prices included herein, stating the 

unit prices, total price per item, the total amount and the expected countries 

of origin of the Goods to be supplied under this Project.” 

 

7.4. Moreover, Clause 15.2 of the same Section provides “The Bidder shall fill in 
rates and prices for all items of the Goods described in the Schedule of Prices. 

Bids not addressing or providing all the required items in the Bidding 

Documents including, where applicable, Schedule of Prices, shall be 

considered non-responsive and thus, automatically disqualified.” 

 

7.5. Section 37.2.1 and Section 37.4.1, Rule XI of the RIRR of RA No. 9184 
provide: 

 

Section 37.2.1 The winning bidder shall post the required 

Performance Security and enter into contract with the Procuring Entity 

within ten (10) calendar days from receipt by the winning bidder of the 

Notice of Award. 

 

Section 37.4.1 The concerned Procuring Entity shall issue the 

Notice to Proceed together with the copies of the approved contract to 

the successful bidders within seven (7) calendar days from the date of 

approval of the contract by the appropriate government approving 

authority. All notices called for by the terms of the contract shall be 

effective only at the time of receipt thereof by the successful bidder. 

 

7.6. Section 39.4 of the RIRR of RA No. 9184 provides that the performance 
security shall remain valid until issuance by the Procuring Entity of the 

Certificate of Final Acceptance. 

 

7.7. Section 11.2.5 of the IRR of RA No. 9184 clearly states that in no case shall 
the HOPE and/or the approving authority be the Chairperson or a member of 

the BAC. 

 

7.8. Also, Paragraph 2 of COA Circular No. 2003-004 dated July 30, 2003 
provides that:  

 

“On the other hand, the Chief Accountant and the personnel under him 

are tasked to approve voucher in payment of such goods and services 

procured and of the infrastructure prosecuted and to certify to the 

availability of funds for project of the bidding. Thus, it becomes 

necessary to ensure that the procurement and payment functions are 

segregated in keeping with the rules and principles of good internal 

control and to avert the possibility of conflict of interest that may arise 

under the circumstances. 

 



93 

 

Xxx for the strengthening of internal control in the operations of the 

government, it is hereby directed that the Chief Accountant and the 

personnel of the Accounting Unit of any agency of government are 

prohibited from being regular members of the agency’s Bids & Awards 

Committee as contemplated under the Implementing Rules and 

Regulations of R.A. No. 9184. xxX” 

 

7.9. The following five contracts with a total contract price of P28,708,475.63 
awarded by the CO to various contractors/suppliers in CY 2019 were 

reviewed by the Audit Team:

815,871.00  

Total 28,708,475.63  

 

7.10. The purpose of the review is to determine BAC’s compliance with the 
requirements of RA No. 9184 and its Revised IRR in the performance of 

procurement activities from pre-procurement to contract signing.   

 

i. Lapses in Writing Warranty Conditions 
 

7.11. We have noted that the warranty period and the period to remedy the defects 
as provided in the foregoing Clauses were not specified in the corresponding 

SCCs for the Contract Nos: CS-06-2019-19, CS-06-2019-20, CS-10-2019-42 

and CS-11-2019-52. 

 

7.12. Instead, the respective SCCs of these contracts only provided for the 
following: “GCC Clause 17.2 – Any violation of this clause shall entitle the 

Procuring Entity to liquidated damages in the amount specified in Item No.19 

of this SCC.”. 

 

7.13. The specification of the warranty period as provided in Clause 17.3 of GCC 
is material to the release of the retention money as the same depends on the 



94 

 

lapse of the warranty period. In addition, the period to correct any defects or 

damages in the goods determines whether or not the Supplier could be made 

liable for any action that the PRC could take under the Contract and the 

applicable law. 

 

ii. No attached Schedule of Prices in the Financial Bid Forms 
 

7.14. We have noted that the Financial Bid Forms of all the contracts reviewed 
lacked the Schedule of Prices as required by the foregoing Clauses. Despite 

this non-submission, the bidders were not rated failed in the initial bid 

evaluation, thus raising the assumption that the Procuring Entity did not 

observe this requirement strictly. 

 

iii. Procuring activities not within the mandatory timelines 
 

7.15. It was noted that for the following contracts, contract signing from the date of 
Notice to Award took 17-22 days, contrary to the above Section of the RIRR. 

It is also observed in the same contracts that the dates of actual receipt of the 

Suppliers of the Notice of Award (NOA) were not indicated. Details are as 

follows: 

 

Table 48. Approved Contracts with Delays in Issuance of NOA 

Contract No. Date of Contract 
Date of Notice of 

Award 
Time Elapsed 

CS-11-2019-52 11/21/2019 10/30/2019 22  

CS-09-2019-25 09/06/2019 08/20/2019 17 

 

7.16. Moreover, in the following contracts, the issuance of the Notice to Proceed 
(NTP) to the Suppliers were made after 9-12 days from the date of the 

approval of the contract. Details are as follows: 

 

Table 49. Approved Contracts with Delays in Issuance of NTP

Proceed

CS-09-2019-25 09/06/2019 09/18/2019 12 

CS-06-2019-19 06/11/2019 06/20/2019 9 

 

7.17. Furthermore, as in the case of the NOA above, the dates of receipt of the 
Suppliers were not indicated in the NTP for the contract numbers CS-06-

2019-20, CS-11-2019-52 and CS-10-2019-42. 

 

7.18. It should be noted that the actual date of receipt of the Notice to Proceed is a 
crucial requirement as it becomes the basis of the contract completion date. It 

is where the number of days to complete the project is being reckoned with. 

(e.g., 150 days from date of receipt of NTP).  



95 

 

iv. Performance Security expiring ahead of the completion of contract 
 

7.19. In our documentation, we have noted that the Performance Security in the 
form of Bank Guarantee posted by the supplier, Metasystems Development 

Inc., in the Procurement of Interactive Archival Storage and Retrieval of 

Record System, has an expiration date earlier than the estimated contract 

completion date. Details as follows:

v. Internal control weakness noted due to lack of segregation of duty 
manifested by the approval of BAC Chairman of payment to suppliers  

 

7.20. In the post-audit of payments, the Audit Team noted that the Box D 
“Approved for Payment” portion of DVs representing the payments to the 

following Suppliers were signed by an official who happened to be the BAC 

Chairman:

Total 1,297,791.00  

 

7.21. It is important to note that the prohibition in the above COA Circular also 
applies to an official authorized to sign DVs. Moreover, under Non-policy 

Memorandum of Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB-NPM) 

No.059-2012, it provides that “the “approving authority” in Section 11.2.5 of 

the IRR and the Generic Procurement Manual includes a person who 

undertakes payment since the approval contemplated therein also includes 

approval of disbursements.” 

 

vi. Non-submission of documents as integral part or as support to the 
approved contract as required in COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated 

February 12, 2009 



96 

 

 

7.22. For all the contract reviewed, we have noted that the following documents 
were lacking in the submitted contract documents: 

 

1. Minutes of pre-procurement conference; 

2. Printout of the web pages where ITB was posted in the PhilGEPS website 

and the PRC Website; 

3. Photocopy of Newspaper clippings for invitation; and  

4. Copy of Post-Qualification Report 

 

7.23.   We recommended that Management require the BAC/ PSD to: 

 

a. review the bid documents as to consistency of the provisions therein 
prior to issuance to prospective bidders; 

 

b. provide explanation as to the: 
 

 non-submission of bidders of Price Schedule with their Financial 
Bid Forms; 

 non-compliance with the procurement timelines in the contract 
and the discrepancy noted in the date of posting of Performance 

Security and the date of contract signing; 

 deficiencies in the NOA and NTP; 

 Performance security expiring before contract completion 
 

c. inspect carefully the documents being submitted by the bidders 
especially the dates and arithmetical corrections thereof; 

 

d. stop the practice of appointing the BAC Chairman as the approver of 
the payments to suppliers to avoid conflict of interest and maintain 

the integrity of the procurement process and contract 

implementation; and 

 

e. submit all the lacking documents noted in accordance with COA 
Circular No. 2009-001.  

 

7.24. Management commented as follows: 
 

 The specification of the warranty period was inadvertently omitted in the 
SCC of the abovementioned projects. However, the inclusion of GCC 

Clause 17.2 in the Special SCC, with the supplier warranting that the 

goods being supplied for the contract shall have no defects, may still 

suffice to protect the Commission’s interest, or government in general. 

Such term was also acknowledged by the bidder. The retention money 

from the amount due the supplier may also answer for any deficiencies 

later on. As for other procurement activities conducted, the warranty 



97 

 

period was specified in the SCC of the original bidding documents. It is 

only that they might have been unintentionally deleted during the process 

of editing of the bidding documents for the abovementioned projects. 

Most assuredly, we will further enhance the review process in order to 

avoid similar incident in the future; 

 

 Out of the five contracts reviewed by your office, only two were 
considered goods while the rest are services. It is the BAC’s 

understanding that the Schedule of Prices is applicable only for contracts 

with quantifiable items, and not for contracts requiring services. 

Nevertheless, we will transmit to your office the Schedule of Prices for 

the contracts which were inadvertently not included in the prior 

submission of BAC to your office.  

 

 As to the procurement timelines, it was an honest belief of the BAC that 
it has complied with the provision of Section 37.2.1, Rule XI of the 

Revised IRR of RA No. 9184. For instance, the winning bidder entered 

into a contract with the Commission within 10 days from receipt of the 

Notice of Award, pursuant to the 2016 Revised IRR of RA No. 9184. It 

is our understanding that the timeline for the winning bidder to enter into 

a contract with the Commission will be reckoned from the receipt of the 

NOA and not from the date thereof. It has been the practice of the BAC 

to require the bidder to sign on the Notice to Proceed upon receipt 

thereof, and indicate the date of the actual receipt therein. Unfortunately, 

the copies forwarded to COA office are the scanned file copies of the 

BAC prior to the signing of the bidder. Nevertheless, we are furnishing 

your office, with the copies of the Notice to Proceed with date of receipt 

of the bidder.  

 

 The BAC/Secretariat is aware that the Performance Security should 
remain valid until the completion and final acceptance of the Project. It 

is, however, possible that an error was committed by the issuing bank as 

to the year of the validity indicated on the Performance Bond. Though 

the project was successfully completed, the BAC had likewise called the 

attention of the supplier through the end-user of the project on the noted 

observation. Rest assured that from hereon the BAC/ Secretariat will be 

more circumspect in accepting Performance Security submitted by 

bidders, though by reason of an honest mistake, to avoid similar incidents 

from happening in the future; 

 

 It is our previous understanding, as explained by the former Executive 
Director for technical Support of the GPBB, that the “approving 

authority” pertains, and is only confined to the BAC activities. That is, 

the HoPE cannot be the Chairman or a member of the BAC. However, 

with the Non-policy Memorandum of Government Procurement Policy 

Board (GPPB-NPM) No. 059- 2012, and to avoid any taint of 



98 

 

impropriety, the BAC Chairman of the CO, upon notice of this AOM, 

though within his budgetary threshold, already inhibited himself from 

signing approval of disbursements for suppliers which underwent 

bidding. There will also be changes with regard to the RO wherein the 

HoPE is the Regional Director and also the approving authority of DVs; 

 

 As to the lacking contract documents the BAC/Secretariat noted that 
there was no mention in COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 

2009 with respect to the submission of the Minutes of the Pre-

Procurement Conference or the print-out of web pages where Invitation 

to Bid (ITB) was posted, hence the same were not included in our 

submission. As to the photocopy of newspaper clippings for invitation, 

the BAC believes that the posting of the Invitation to Bid in the 

PhilGEPS website suffices per RA No. 9184. 

 

           Auditor’s rejoinder: 

 

7.25. We noted and accepted Managements’ comments . However the Audit Team 
would like to clarify the following: 

 

Only contracts for procurement of goods were required to submit Schedule 

of Bid Prices 

 

 Section 5 (r) of the Revised IRR of R.A No. 9184 defines goods as “all 
items, supplies, materials and general support services except Consulting 

Services and Infrastructure projects, which may be needed in the 

transaction of public businesses or in the pursuit of any government 

undertaking, project or activity, including non-personal or contractual 

services Xxx”. Hence, in the procurement of services, the submission of 

Price Schedule is indispensable as it helps in the evaluation of bids on an 

equal footing to ensure fair and competitive comparison. 

 

There was no mention in COA Circular No. 2009-001 with respect to the 

submission of the Minutes of the Pre-Procurement Conference or the print-

out of web pages where Invitation to Bid (ITB) was posted. 

 

 Specifically, Sub-section 3.1.2 (g) of the above COA Circular requires the 
submission of Minutes of Pre-Procurement conference; and 

 As to the submission of other documents, the same were being required 
by the Audit Team to evaluate PRC’s compliance with the requirements 

of RA No. 9184 from pre-procurement to contract signing and 

implementation. Thus may we remind the BAC to forward the documents 

covering or supporting these procurement stages. 

 

There will also be changes with regard to the RO wherein the HoPE is the 

Regional Director and also the approving authority of DVs. 



99 

 

 

 We would like to clarify that there is no need to make changes in the 
current set-up in the RO as long as the Regional Director who approves 

the DVs is not the BAC Chairman or a member of the BAC. 

 

 

OTHER COMPLIANCE ISSUES 

 

Compliance with Property Insurance Law (RA No. 656) administered by the Government 

Service Insurance System (GSIS) 

 

8. The PRC has insured its properties with the General Insurance Fund (GIF) of 
the GSIS for CY 2020 as required under RA No. 656 and COA Circular No. 92-

390 dated November 17, 1992. 

 

8.1. Section 5 of RA No. 656, as amended by PD No. 245, requires government 
properties, assets and interests to be insured with the GIF, as administered by 

the GSIS, against any insurable risk.   

 

8.2. COA Circular No. 92-390 dated November 17, 1992 was issued in support of 
the implementation of the GIF and Property Replacement Fund of the GSIS 

in: 

 

a)   determining the physical assets of the national and local governments 

including those of government-owned and/or controlled corporations and 

their subsidiaries and affiliates; and 

 

b)   ensuring that all insurable assets and properties of the Government are 

adequately covered/ insured with the GIF of the GSIS. 

 

8.3. Verification of the GL for the account Insurance Expenses revealed that PRC 
made payments totaling P994,408.00 for insurance premiums for all of its 

vehicles and buildings including those in the ROs with insurable assets.  

 

 

Remittances to GSIS, Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR), PhilHealth and Pag-IBIG Fund 

 

9. For CY 2020, the Agency has faithfully complied with the requirement of 
deducting from the salaries of its personnel the required taxes and premiums, 

and remitted the same as well as the government share within the prescribed 

period to the concerned institutions or agencies. However, the prior year’s 

statutory deductions of P3,706,000.67and balance of P1,593,968.26 in favor of 

GSIS and BIR; respectively, remained unremitted and/or subject to verification 

and reconciliation. 

 



100 

 

9.1. The table below shows the Agency’s status of compliance with respect to the 
required deductions and remittance of premiums/contributions to the 

aforementioned government institutions: 

 

Table 52. Summary Status of Remittances to Concerned Institutions 

Area Account Affected Status 

Compliance with Tax 

Laws 

Due to BIR A total of P70,642,310.97 was withheld by the Agency 

for the compulsory taxes and remitted P68,228,641.07 

to the BIR. Included in the unremitted balance of 

P2,765,028.50 for CY 2020 is the amount of 

P1,171,060.24, which pertains to recorded accrual of 

payables as of December 31, 2020 which are expected 

to be remitted in the ensuing year and prior years’ 

balances that need to be reconciled amounting to 

P1,593,968.26. 

Deduction and Remittance 

of GSIS Premiums 

Due to GSIS A total of P47,963,109.31 was withheld by the Agency 

for the appropriate employees' personal premium, loan 

amortizations and government share and remitted 

P46,646,570.86, leaving a balance of P3,706,000.67, 

representing statutory deductions in prior years for 

verification and reconciliation.  

Deduction and Remittance 

of PhilHealth Premiums 

Due to PhilHealth A total of P9,187,688.11 was collected for PhilHealth 

premiums and remitted P9,352,979.03, leaving an 

unremitted amount of P567,543.99 as of yearend. 

Deduction and Remittance 

of Pag-IBIG Premiums 

Due to Pag-IBIG The PRC complied with the mandatory deductions of 

Pag-IBIG contributions as of December 31, 2020 from 

its employees totaling P1,804,300.00, its share of 

P925,900.00 and employees’ loans and repayment 

amortization of P3,005,503.07. Total remittances for 

the year amounted to P5,947,669.11. However, there 

still a balance of P130,389.68, which remained 

unremitted as of yearend. 

 

9.2. We recommended and Management agreed to facilitate the 
reconciliation and eventual disposition of the noted PY’s unremitted 

contributions/withholding as of yearend. 

 

 

Gender and Development Plan (GAD) 

 

10. The agency implemented programs, projects and activities supporting GAD 
plan designed to address gender issues, allocating P75,795,999.68  or 5.37 

percent of the total Agency budget, in compliance with the General Provisions 

of the GAA for FY 2020.  The GAD expenditures, as attributed to the regular 

operations and accomplishments of the Agency and  reported in the GAD 

Accomplishment Report (AR),  amounted to P79,928,219.56 which exceeded the 

GAD budget by P4,132,219.88.  However, the GAD AR submitted was not 

authenticated by the PCW Gender Mainstreaming Monitoring System (GMMS) 

in accordance with PCW Memorandum Circular No.2021-01, doubting the 

correctness and validity of the Report. 



101 

 

 

10.1. Section 6.1 of Philippine Commission on Women (PCW)-NEDA-DBM 
Joint Circular (JC) No. 2012-01 provides that: 

 

“At least five percent (5%) of the total agency budget appropriations 

authorized under the annual GAA shall correspond to activities 

supporting GAD plans and programs.  The GAD budget shall be drawn 

from the agency’s Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses 

(MOOE), Capital Outlay (CO), and Personal Services (PS).  It is 

understood that the GAD budget does not constitute an additional 

budget over an agency’s total budget appropriations.” 

 

10.2. Section 31 of the General Provisions of the FY 2020 GAA provides that: 
 

All agencies of the government shall formulate a Gender and 

Development (GAD) Plan designed to address gender issues within 

their concerned sectors or mandate and implement applicable 

provisions under R.A. No. 9710 or the Magna Carta of Women, 

Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against 

Women, the Beijing Platform for Action, the Philippine Plan for 

Gender-Responsive Development (1995-2025), and the Philippine 

Development Plan.  

 

The GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of the 

agencies, which shall be at least five percent of their budgets. For this 

purpose, activities currently being undertaken by the agencies related 

to GAD are those that contribute to poverty alleviation, economic 

empowerment especially of marginalized women, protection, 

promotion, and fulfillment of women’s human rights and practice of 

gender-responsive governance are considered sufficient compliance 

with said requirement.  Utilization of the GAD budget shall be 

evaluated based on the GAD performance indicators identified by said 

agencies. 

 

10.3. Verification of the Agency’s GAD AR for CY 2020 submitted to the PCW 
showed that the GAD Budget of P75,795,999.68 allotted amount was 

compliant with the five percent requirement from the 2020 Budget 

appropriations of P1,410,570,000.00 for CY 2020. 

 

10.4. However, the Agency utilized budget for GAD amounted to P79,928,219.56, 
which exceeded the GAD budget by P4,132,219.88. Breakdown of the 

reported actual expenses for each program is as follows: 

 

 

 

 



102 

 

          Table 53. Report of Actual Expenses Attributed to GAD Programs 

 

10.5.   We recommended that Management submit justification and basis for 

the incurrence of expenditures in excess of the GAD budget and submit 

to the Audit Team the duly authenticated GAD AR by the PCW GMMS. 

 

Senior Citizens and Persons with Disability 

 

11. The Agency implemented programs and projects intended to address the 
concerns of Senior Citizens (SCs) and Persons with Disability (PWD), as 

contained in the GAD Plan and Budget, with its integration and attribution to 

the planned operations and accomplishments of the agency during the year, 

pursuant to Section 32 of the General Provisions of the FY 2020 GAA.  The 

unauthenticated GAD AR by the PCW GMMS reported related expenses of 

P1,410,570,000.00 or two percent of the total agency budget. 

 

11.1. Section 32 of the General Provisions of RA No. 10924 provides that “All 
agencies of the government shall formulate plans, programs and projects 

intended to address the concerns of SCs and PWDs insofar as it relates to 

their mandated functions and integrate the same in their regular activities.” 

 

11.2. Moreover, all government infrastructures and facilities shall provide 
architectural or structural features, designs or facilities that will reasonably 

enhance the mobility, safety and welfare of persons with disability pursuant 

to “Batas Pambansa Blg. 344 and RA No. 7277.” 

 

11.3. No. 7277 of the Magna Carta for PWDs mandates the rehabilitation, self-
development and self-reliance of disabled persons and their integration into 

the mainstream of society and for other purposes. It further defines the rights 

and privileges of disabled persons such as equal opportunity for employment, 

access to quality education, national health program, auxiliary social services, 

telecommunications, accessibility (barrier-free environment), political and 

civil rights. 

 

11.4. The activities for the implementation of the aforesaid Act were incorporated 
in the GAD program for the concerns of the SCs and the PWDs using two 

percent of the total budget of the Agency. Actual disbursements on the regular

Status of Settlement of Audit Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges 

 

12. Audit suspensions, disallowances and charges totaling P18,607,421.47, 
P46,059,011.46 and P149,464,894.35, respectively, remained unsettled as of 



105 

 

December 31, 2020, contrary to COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 

15, 2009. 

 

12.1. COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009 prescribes the use of 
the 2009 Rules and Regulations on the Settlement of Accounts (RRSA). It 

provides, among others, that the Auditor shall issue a Notice of 

Disallowance/Notice of Charge (ND/NC) for difference/balances resulting 

from the audit of accounts. A Notice of Suspension (NS) may be issued 

pending compliance with various requirements for transactions which may 

result in pecuniary loss to the government. The suspensions, disallowances 

and charges existing at the effectivity of these Rules, which is October 6, 

2009, shall continue to be monitored and enforced by the COA. 

 

12.2. The following table summarizes the Agency’s suspensions, disallowances
