EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 

 

A. Introduction 
 

The Professional Regulation Commission (PRC) was created under Presidential 

Decree (PD) No. 223 but was repealed on December 5, 2000 upon signing into law of 

Republic Act (RA) No. 8981, known as the PRC Modernization Act of 2000, that created 

a three-man Commission. In 2006, Executive Order (EO) No. 565, as amended by EO No. 

565-A, attached the PRC to and placed it under the administrative supervision and control 

of the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE).  

 

In fulfillment of its legal mandate, the PRC performs two important functions, 

which are: 1) to conduct and administer licensure examinations to aspiring professionals, 

and 2) to regulate and supervise the practice of the professions exercised in partnership 

with the 44 Professional Regulatory Boards (PRBs) in the fields of health, business, 

education, social sciences, engineering and technology. The PRBs govern their respective 

professions’ practice and ethical standards and accredit the professional organization 

representing the professionals. 

 

The Commission is headed by Chairperson Teofilo S. Pilando, Jr. and 

Commissioners Yolanda D. Reyes and Dr. Jose Y. Cueto, Jr. The Commission Proper is 

assisted by Assistant Commissioner Aristogerson T. Gesmundo. The members of the PRBs 

are all presidential appointees who are tasked to supervise the 43 accredited professional 

organizations. 

 

The Office of the President through the Executive Secretary issued a Memorandum 

on May 16, 2017 informing the Commission of the approval of the creation of PRC new 

offices/services:  Regional Offices (ROs) in National Capital Region (NCR), Regions I, 

III, IV-B, XII and XIII, Legal Services, International Affairs Office, Information and 

Communications Technology Services, and Planning, Management and Financial 

Services.  The Notice of Organization, Staffing and Compensation Action (NOSCA) 

formalizing the approved Organizational Structure and Staffing Pattern (OSSP) of 

approved new offices and positions and reclassification of key positions was issued by the 

Department of Budget and Management (DBM) on August 2, 2017.

reorganizational structure as approved by DBM, as shown below:
