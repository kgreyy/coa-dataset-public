agency’s improvement opportunities; and d) determine the extent of implementation of

E. Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements 
 

The Auditor rendered an unqualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the 

financial statements of NIB as at December 31, 2020. 

 

 

F. Summary of Significant Observations and Recommendations 
 

 The following are the significant audit observations and the corresponding 

recommendations: 

 

1. Laxity in the enforcement of COA rules and regulations on cash advances 
prescribed under Section 89 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 and COA 

Circular No. 97-002 resulted in the delayed/non-liquidation of cash advances 

despite completion of the purpose that past due outstanding accounts had 

accumulated to ₱692,788.99 and ₱137,092.89 for advances to SDO and Advances 
for travels, respectively, at year-end. (Paragraph No. 1) 

 

We recommended that Management instruct the Accountant to: 

 

a. Demand the immediate liquidation of the past due outstanding cash advances; 
b. Cause the suspension/withholding of salaries of the concerned 

employees/accountable officers who will fail to liquidate their cash advances 

despite the demand; and 

c. Closely monitor the cash advances and strictly enforce the COA rules and 
regulations on the liquidation of cash advances to prevent the occurrence of 

long outstanding accounts. 

 

2. Lapses were noted in property management system such as: (a) discrepancy of 
P53,820,789.21 between the books and Report on Physical Count of PPE 

(RPCPPE); and (b) absence of reconciliation of the Accounting and Property 

records due to non-maintenance of Property Cards (PCs) and Property, Plant and 

Equipment Ledger Card (PPELC) required under Sections 38 and 42 of the 

Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies 

(NGAs), Volume 1. (Paragraph No. 2) 

 

 We recommended that Management require the: 

 

a.  Inventory Committee to: (i) undertake best efforts to reconcile the result of 
physical inventory with the accounting records, and accordingly make 



iv 
 

appropriate adjustments, if warranted; and (ii) include all the agency’s PPE in 

the physical count; and 

b.  Accounting and the Property and Supply Sections to maintain the prescribed 
PPELC and PC, respectively, and to reconcile their records periodically for 

early detection of discrepancy/error, if any. 

 

3. Procurement for the rental of eight laptops and supply of two cameras totaling 
P1,278,480.00 were done through Small Value Procurement, instead of public 

bidding, thus, NIB was not ensured that it had obtained the most advantageous 

price to the government. (Paragraph No. 3) 

 

We recommended that Management require the BAC to: 

 

a. Justify the conduct of separate procurement for the rental of eight units of 
laptop and supply of two cameras;  

b. Conduct public bidding for procurements beyond the threshold for SVP; and 
c. Ensure that procurements will not constitute splitting of contracts. 

 
4. Deficiencies were noted in the utilization of fund transfer and implementation of the 

activities for the PhilSys project under the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) 

entered by NIB with the PCOO such as: a) NIB did not liquidate to PCOO the 

related expenses on a monthly basis; and b) non-submission of the required monthly 

progress reports. Moreover, a total of P1,504,550.65 had lapsed at year-end and was 

returned to the Bureau of Treasury (BTr) due to NIB’s delayed implementation of 

the activities required under the MOA; thus, impacting on the timely completion of 

said project. (Paragraph No. 4) 

 

We recommended that Management: 

 

a. adhere to the terms of MOA on the submission of the required monthly 
liquidation and progress reports to the PCOO in relation to the Philsys Project; 

b. follow up the request from the DBM for the release of NCA corresponding to 
the unutilized balance of the fund transfer from PCOO; and  

c. request from the PCOO for an extension of the validity of the related MOA and 
the implementation period of the NIB activities for the PhilSys Project.   

 
5. Various properties with carrying amount totaling P11,228,280.04 were not insured 

with the General Insurance Fund (GIF) of the GSIS; thus, placed the NIB of not 

being indemnified in the event of loss of or damage to said properties. (Paragraph 

No. 13) 

 

We recommended that Management secure adequate insurance coverage for all its 

insurable assets with the GIF of the GSIS, in compliance with the Property 

Insurance Law.  

 



v

concerned in the exit conference held on June 4, 2021. Management views and comments

G. Implementation of Prior Year’s Audit Recommendations

Report (AAR), 11 were implemented and 3 were not implemented. Details are
