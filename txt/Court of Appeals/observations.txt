FINANCIAL ISSUES



Unliquidated Advances to Special Disbursing Officers



1)		Cash advances totaling ₱330,597.09 for the accounts Advances for Payroll and Advances to Special Disbursing Officer (SDO) remained unliquidated as at December 31, 2020 as Accountable Officers (AOs) were not able to immediately refund the excess/unexpended balance of cash advances at the end of the year when the purposes for which they were granted have been served thus, making it susceptible to possible loss or probable misuse. 



	1)	Section 5.8 of Commission on Audit (COA) Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 requires that all cash advances shall be fully liquidated at the end of each year.  Except for petty cash fund, the Accountable Officer (AO) shall refund any unexpended balance to the cashier/collecting officer who will issue the necessary official receipt.



	2)	Records show that cash advances were granted as  Advances for Payroll - ₱5,885,000.00 and Advances to SDO - ₱1,802,500.00 or  a total of ₱7,687,500.00 in December 2020, a total of ₱7,356,902.91 was liquidated while the excess cash advances in the total amount of ₱330,597.09 remained unliquidated as of December 31, 2020, broken down in Table No. 1:

	3)	The unliquidated amount of ₱330,597.09 represents the unexpended balance of cash advances granted in December 2020 but were not refunded to the cashier at year end.



	4)	Inquiry with the Accountant disclosed that the liquidation reports were submitted together with the ORs of the refunds in January 2021. However, since the liquidation vouchers were dated December 2020 and the books   were still open at the time of submission, the liquidations were recorded/booked-up as of December 2020, except for the refunds which were made only in January 2021. 



	5)	The practice of not being able to refund the excess/unexpended/unutilized balance of cash advance to the cashier/collecting officer at the end of the year, even if the purpose for which the said cash advance was granted had already been served is inconsistent with Section 5.8 of the COA Circular No. 97-002.



	6)	It is noteworthy to mention however, that the unliquidated amount of ₱330,597.09 was already refunded and liquidated as of January 2021, as evidenced by official receipts, details shown in Table No. 2:

	7)	The excess was refunded only in January 2021 because of the early Christmas break in the agency with the last working day being December 17, 2020.



	8)	The excess/unexpended cash ranging from ₱354.00 to ₱80,000.00, in the AO’s possession might be susceptible to possible loss or probable misuse when not immediately refunded though the purpose for which they were granted have been served.

	9)	We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountable Officers to fully liquidate their cash advances as soon as the purposes for which they were granted have been served through the submission of the liquidation documents and the corresponding official receipts evidencing refund of the unexpended/excess balances at the end of each year.





Error in recording advances



2)		Cash advances granted for the operational requirements of the Offices of the Commission on Appointments (CA) Members were recorded as Advances to Special Disbursing Officer (SDO) account instead of Advances for Operating Expenses thus, affecting the accuracy of the Advances to SDO and Advances for Operating Expenses accounts at any given time during CY 2020 or prior to the liquidation of the advances. 



	1)	Chapter 3 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume III describes Advances for Operating Expenses as the account used to recognize in the agency books the amount of advances granted to accountable officers for payment of operating expenses of operating/field units and foreign posts not maintaining complete set of books of accounts.

 

	2)	On the other hand, Chapter 3 of the same Manual describes Advances to Special Disbursing Officer as the account used to recognize the amount granted to agency’s accountable officers and employees for special purpose/time-bound undertakings to be liquidated within a specified period. It also includes labor payroll for projects undertaken by administration.



	3)	Post audit of transactions revealed that cash advances were granted to cover the monthly Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE) of the Offices of the CA Members from January to December 2020. These expenses include travelling, communication, office supplies and other maintenance and operating expenses.



	4)	However, records show that in CY 2020, cash advances for the operational requirements of the Offices of the CA Members totaling ₱72,602,800.00 were granted and recorded as Advances to SDO account instead of Advances for Operating Expenses account, which is not in keeping with Chapter 3 of the GAM, Vol III. 



	5)	Of the total cash advances granted, ₱72,577,202.91 were liquidated which were likewise recorded as credit to the Advances to SDO account, leaving a balance of ₱25,597.09 as of December 31, 2020.



	6)	The error in recording affected the accuracy of the Advances to SDO and Advances for Operating Expenses accounts at any given time during CY 2020 or prior to the liquidation of the advances. 



	7)	As of December 31, 2020, the balance of Advances to SDO account is overstated by ₱25,597.09 while the Advances for Operating Expenses account is understated by the same amount, which represent the unliquidated cash advances of the Offices of the CA Members at year-end.



	8)	We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to record properly the granting of cash advances for the operational requirements of the Offices of the CA Members as Advances for Operating Expenses account instead of Advances to SDO, in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 3 of the GAM, Vol. III.





Unreconciled discrepancies in the Inventory accounts



3)		The accuracy of balances of Office Supplies, Drugs and Medicines and Other Supplies and Materials Inventory accounts as of December 31, 2020 amounting to ₱424,726.79, ₱157,300.00 and ₱75,362.80, respectively, cannot be assured due to the unreconciled discrepancy of ₱226,641.38 in the balances of accounts and 11,130 in the quantity of items between the Accounting records and the Report on Physical Count of Inventory (RPCI).



	1)	Appendix 66 of the GAM, Vol. II instructs that the RPCI shall be reconciled with the Supplies Ledger Cards (SLCs) and Stock Cards (SCs) maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit, and Property and/or Supply Division/Unit, respectively. Any discrepancy shall be verified and/or adjusted accordingly.



	2)	Comparison of Accounting records for inventory accounts of ₱657,389.59 and the RPCI prepared by the Inventory Committee totaling ₱430,748.21, disclosed a total discrepancy of ₱226,641.38. Details are shown in Table No. 3:

	4)	Inquiry with the concerned personnel disclosed that discrepancies were caused by non-reconciliation of the RPCI with the records of the Accounting Service (AS).



	5)	Consequently, the non-reconciliation of the RPCI with the SLCs affects the accuracy of account balances of the Office Supplies Inventory, Drugs and Medicines Inventory and Other Supplies and Materials Inventory as of December 31, 2020, considering the existence of unreconciled difference of ₱226,641.38 in the balances of accounts and 11,130 in the quantity of items.



	6)	It is worthy to mention that the same audit observation was included in the 2019 Annual Audit Report, wherein unreconciled quantity of items totaling 1,558 between the AS and the RPCI was noted in the Office Supplies Inventory as well as Other Supplies and Materials Inventory accounts. The AS and the Property and Procurement Service (PPS) were able to reconcile said 2019 discrepancy, but failed to undertake reconciliation in CY 2020. 



	7)	We recommended and Management agreed to require the:



a)	AS and PPS to reconcile the difference of ₱226,641.38 in the balances of inventory accounts and 11,130 in the quantity of items between the Accounting records and RPCI; and



b)	Inventory Committee to regularly conduct physical count/inventory and prepare the RPCI semi-annually and, any discrepancy noted, should be immediately investigated and reconciled with the records maintained by the AS and PPS, as required in Appendix 66, of the GAM, Vol II.





Property, Plant and Equipment account balances could not be ascertained



4)		The accuracy and reliability of the Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) account balances totaling ₱38.299 million could not be ascertained due to unreconciled differences between the accounting and property records in the amount of acquisition cost/unit value aggregating to ₱4.742 million.



	1)	Section 42, Chapter 10 of the GAM, Vol. I provides that the Chief Accountant shall maintain PPE Ledger Card (PPELC) for each category of PPE.  The PPELC shall be kept to record promptly the acquisition, description, custody, estimated useful life, depreciation, impairment loss, disposal and other information about the asset.  For check and balance, the Property and Supply Office/Unit shall likewise maintain Property Card (PC) for PPE in their custody to account for the receipt and disposition of the same. The balance per PC shall be reconciled with PPELC maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit.  They shall also be reconciled with other property records like the Property Acknowledgement Receipt (PAR).



	2)	Further, Section 42(g) thereof states that the Report on Physical Count of PPE (RPCPPE) shall be used to report the physical count and condition of PPE by type as at a given date, including those which are unrecorded and those which could not be accounted for.  It shows the balance of PPE per property cards and per count and the shortage/overage, if any.  It shall be rendered by the Inventory Committee, on its yearly physical count of properties owned by the entity.



	3)	For CY 2020, the CA created an Inventory Committee pursuant to CA Special Order No. 020-024. The Inventory Committee prepared the RPCPPE and was approved by the Head of the Agency and submitted to the Auditor. 



	4)	Comparison of the accounting records and the RPCPPE showed a difference of ₱4,741,800.00 in the amount of acquisition cost/unit value, as shown in Table No. 5:

	5)	Further verification disclosed that the discrepancy/difference was caused, among others, by the different format of the property numbers used by the Accounting Service (AS) and Property and Procurement Section (PPS).  As a result, property numbers do not match hence, the difficulty for its reconciliation. Presented in Table No. 6 is a sample of comparison of the property numbers between the accounting records and RPCPPE:

	6)	As seen in Table 5, the AS and the PPS do not use a uniform format in assigning property numbers. This practice may cause recording errors and inefficiency in reconciliation. Likewise, timely audit/verification of the reports was also affected.



	7)	Alternative procedures were taken by the audit team to filter, match and trace the property numbers.  Upon formatting the property numbers into uniform format, discrepancies were noted between the accounting records and the RPCPPE property numbers of 43 PPE items, as shown in Table No. 7.

	9)	Inquiry with the concerned personnel disclosed that discrepancies were caused by non-reconciliation of records between accounting and the PPS.



	10)	The non-reconciliation of AS and PPS records rendered the PPE accounts inaccurate and unreliable thus, affecting the fair presentation of the accounts in the Financial Statement of the CA.



	11)	We recommended and Management agreed to require the AS and the PPS to verify and reconcile the difference of PPE account balances, assign uniform property numbers to each item of PPE and make necessary adjustments in their respective books/records.



Non-reversion of Due to Officers and Employees and Other Payables



5)		The Due to Officers and Employees and Other Payables accounts balances of ₱5.992 million and ₱38,427.49, respectively, as at December 31, 2020 included payables that have remained outstanding for two years or more amounting to ₱21,138.50 and ₱2,265.40, respectively, which were not reverted to the Accumulated Surplus or Deficit.

COMPLIANCE ISSUES



Non-compliance with COA Order of Execution



6)		The Commission on Appointments (CA) was still not able to enforce Commission on Audit (COA) Order of Execution (COE) dated November 2, 2011 on the settlement of unliquidated cash advances totaling ₱3.496 million which remained outstanding for more than 20 years as at December 31, 2020.



	1)	Section 23.4, Chapter V of the 2009 Rules and Regulations on the Settlement of Accounts (RRSA) states that the Auditor shall monitor the implementation of the COE and report to the Director the action taken by the agency thereon. Unsettled COEs shall be referred to the General Counsel for appropriate action including referral to the Office of the Solicitor General and the Ombudsman.



	2)	The unliquidated amount of ₱3,496,199.99 represents cash advances of which records were razed by fire that gutted the CA Office on February 22, 2001 and were requested for write-off in 2002. This amount is broken down as shown in Table No. 10.

Total

₱3,496,199.99



	3)	The COA Commission Proper denied the request for write-off under COA Decision No. 2010-094 dated October 21, 2010, due to Management’s non-compliance with COA Resolution No. 80-122, the specific provision is quoted thus:





On the Cash Advances – Disbursing Officer amounting to ₱3,496,199.99, the guidelines under COA Resolution No. 810-122 dated April 23, 1980, provide that, only unliquidated cash advances not exceeding P10,000.00 which remained outstanding for more than ten years, in the books of an agency despite diligent efforts to collect by the accountable officer, may be written off.  The death or unknown whereabouts of respondent employees, incapacity to pay or insolvency are circumstances that may justify the write-off.  However, there is no showing that these conditions are present in the instant request.  Hence, the requested write-off in this regard cannot be given due course.  Accordingly, extra diligent efforts should be exerted towards the identification of officers/employees accountable therefor, by resorting to the records of other offices where the funds were given and include the reconstruction of abstract of issuances or releases of funds based on bank records to establish proper accountability.



	4)	Since no motion for reconsideration was filed on the above CP Decision, the COE dated November 2, 2011 was issued by the COA General Counsel to enforce the withholding of salaries or any amount due to the concerned accountable officers for the settlement of their liabilities.   The then Audit Team Leader served the subject COE to the CA Management on November 28, 2011, with a request to return the acknowledged COE with the names and designation of the recipients and the dates of receipts thereof.



	5)	In view of the Management’s inability to act on the COE, the cash advances remained outstanding for more than 20 years already.











	6)	We recommended that Management:



a)	Require the Deputy Secretary for Administration and the Chief, Accounting Service to explain why the CA did not immediately act for the implementation of the COE issued on November 2, 2011; and



b)	Consider to enforce the COE issued by the COA General Counsel against identified concerned responsible official/employee for the unliquidated cash advances totaling ₱3,496,199.99.



	7)	Management explained that they encountered difficulties in implementing the COE since the identity of accountable persons and their specific accountabilities cannot be conclusively ascertained in view of the fact that they no longer have existing records which they can use to establish liability. They added that even the COA Decision No. 2010-094 dated October 21, 2010, and COA Order of Execution, dated November 2, 2011, did not explicitly identify the officers/employees who were accountable.



	8)	Management also explained that previous efforts have been made to resort to the records of other offices. However, it proved futile since all of the financial documents and records, which will be the basis for their inquiries, have been destroyed by the fire which totally razed the offices, specifically the Accounting Service, Budget Service, General Service, Cash Section, Office of the Resident Auditor, Office of the Deputy Secretary for Administration, on February 22, 2001.



	9)	Nevertheless, Management assured that they will continue with their efforts to resolve the matter promptly.





Delayed submission of Contracts and Purchase Orders



7)		Copies of Purchase Orders (POs)/Contracts issued/perfected for the procurement of supplies, goods, property, services and other items were not submitted thus, precluding the Auditor from the timely review of these documents and the prompt communication of results to Management.



	1)	COA Circular No. 2009-001 states that the audited agencies are required to furnish the Auditor with a copy of perfected contracts and POs within five working days upon approval together with the supporting documents for review.



	2)	Under the same Circular, a penalty clause is provided which states that any unjustified non-compliance with the requirements, the officials and employees concerned shall be subject to the administrative disciplinary action provided in (a) Section 127 of Presidential Decree No. 1445; (b) Section 55, Title I-B, Book V of the Revised Administrative Code of 1987; and (c) Section 11 of Republic Act No. 6713.



	3)	Verification showed that for CY 2020, copies of Purchase Orders (POs)/Contracts issued/perfected for the procurement of supplies, goods, property, services and other items were only submitted to COA on March 10, 2021, with delay of 77 to 423 days as shown in Table No. 11.

	4)	Non-submission of the contracts/POs within the prescribed period is not in compliance with COA Circular No. 2009-001 thus, precluded the Auditor from the timely review and prompt communication of results to Management.



	5)	However, it is noteworthy to mention that for the first quarter of CY 2021, copies of POs were already submitted to the Office of the Auditor within the prescribed period.



	6)	We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief, General Service Office and other concerned offices to submit to the Auditor the POs/contracts and their corresponding supporting documents within five working days from conformity/acceptance of the supplier/perfection of the contract in compliance with COA Circular No. 2009-001.





OTHER COMPLIANCE ISSUES



Gender and Development



8)	The agency budget allocated for Gender and Development (GAD) was ₱18.654 million which represents only 1.96 percent of its total agency appropriation of ₱952.909 million or 3.04 percent lower than the five percent requirement. Likewise, only ₱5.237 million or 28.07 percent was utilized out of the approved GAD budget. Further, out of the 14 programmed activities during the year, only one activity was fully implemented, seven partially implemented and six not implemented at all, thus affecting the strengthening of GAD mainstream in the agency operations and the attainment of agency’s goal in promoting gender equality and women empowerment.



	1)	Philippine Commission on Women (PCW), National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA), and Department of Budget and Management (DBM) Joint Circular (JC) No. 2012-01 provides the Guidelines for the Preparation of Annual GAD Plans and Budgets and Accomplishment Reports to Implement the Magna Carta of Women.



8.2    Paragraph 6.1 of the aforementioned Joint Circular also provides that at least five percent of the total agency budget appropriations authorized under the annual GAA shall correspond to activities supporting GAD plans and programs. The GAD budget shall be drawn from the agency’s MOOE, capital outlay (CO) and personnel services (PS). It is understood that the GAD budget does not constitute an additional budget over an agency’s total budget appropriations.



8.3    Likewise, Section 31 of the General Provisions of RA 11465, also known as the 2020 General Appropriations Act (GAA), requires that the GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of the agencies, which shall be at least five per cent of their budgets. For this purpose, activities currently being undertaken by agencies which related to GAD or those that contribute to poverty alleviation, economic empowerment especially of marginalized women, protection, promotion, and fulfillment of women’s human rights, and practice of gender-responsive governance are considered sufficient compliance with said requirement.



8.4	The total appropriations of the CA for CY 2020 was ₱952,909,000.00 of which the approved budget allocated to GAD totaled ₱18,653,705.00, representing 1.96 percent of the agency appropriations, a slight increase from 1.70 percent in CY 2019. However, the allocated GAD budget in CY 2020 is still 3.04 percent less than the required minimum of 5 percent of the agency appropriations which is not in keeping with Section 31 of the 2020 GAA and Paragraph 6.1 of the PCW/NEDA/DBM JC 2012-01.



8.5 	Review of the Annual GAD Accomplishment Report for CY 2020 showed that of the 14 programmed activities, only one was fully implemented, seven were partially implemented and six were not implemented, with actual expenditure of ₱5,236,918.00 or 28.07 percent of the ₱18,653,705.00 approved GAD budget, details are shown in Table No. 12.

Total Expenses



₱5,236,918.00

Unexpended Balance



13,416,787.00

Total GAD Budget



₱18,653,705.00



	2)	From Table 8, it can be noted that of the ₱18,653,705.00 total appropriated budget for GAD activities, only ₱5,236,918.00 was utilized, leaving an unexpended balance of ₱13,416,787.00 or 71.93 percent, which may affect the strengthening of GAD mainstream in the agency operations and the attainment of the agency’s goal in promoting gender equality and women empowerment.



	3)	Further, we noted that for GAD activity number 10, the actual expenditure amounted to ₱1,681,465.00, exceeding the ₱695,943.00 approved budget by ₱985,522.00, which was attributed to the increase in the number of participants.



	4)	It was disclosed that several GAD activities were not fully implemented and/or not implemented at all due to restrictions caused by the pandemic.



	5)	We recommended that Management, in adherence with the pertinent provisions of the 2020 GAA and the PCW/NEDA/DBM JC No. 2012-01 to:



a)	Allocate at least five percent of the total agency budget appropriations authorized under the annual GAA which correspond to activities supporting GAD plans and programs and the GAD Plan be integrated in the regular activities of the Commission on Appointment; and



b)	Direct the GAD Focal Person to ensure the implementation of the programmed activities in the GAD Annual Plan and Budget in order to achieve the objective of strengthening GAD mainstream in the agency operations as well as addressing gender issues and other concerns.



	6)	Management commented that they have always been aware of the GAD mandate to allocate the 5% of the agency’s budget to its GAD plan and budget, however, the separation of executive decisions between the CA Secretariat and the CA Proper makes it impossible to fully comply with the 5% allocation of GAD budget for the entire Commission. Since the CA Proper is bicameral in structure, Management finds it difficult to cover those in the Senate and House contingent in the implementation of plans and programs as they do not hold office in the CA, and most of the activities are office-based or usually held within the CA premises. Nevertheless, Management assured that the GAD Focal Point will do its best to come up with plans and programs that will also include those in the CA Proper.



	7)	Management also said that they have always been aware of the pertinent provisions in the 2020 GAA and the PCW/NEDA/DBM JC 2012-01 and through its GAD Focal Point as lead, they shall see to it that the amount appropriated for GAD programs, projects, and activities shall be fully utilized.



	8)	They added that they are now more aware of the necessity of the full implementation of all set GAD Plans. They assured that despite the setbacks caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the GAD mainstreaming efforts remain on  top of CA’s priority in accordance with the goal to promote gender equality and women empowerment within their jurisdiction.











Senior Citizens (SCs) and Persons with Disability (PWD)



9)		The CA provided facilities, such as elevators, ramps, wheelchair and priority lane for the benefit of SCs and PWD clients, in compliance with Section 31 of RA 11465, or the General Provisions of the GAA for FY 2020.





Tax Laws and Regulations



10)		The agency withheld taxes from compensation of officials and employees and from payments to creditors/suppliers in the amount of ₱37.959 million and ₱8.176 million, respectively, and were remitted fully and promptly to the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR). 



	1)	Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 10-2008 dated July 8, 2008 provides that “all government offices are constituted as withholding agents for purposes of the creditable tax required to be withheld on income payment from compensation, contractors, supplier of goods and services. As withholding agents, they are primarily liable for the remittance of the taxes to the National Treasury through the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR)”.



	2)	Further, Section 7 of RR No. 1-2013 dated January 23, 2013, provides that “filing of returns and payment of taxes shall be made on or before the 10th day of the month following the month in which withholding was made, except for taxes withheld for the month of December each year, which shall be filed on or before January 15 of the succeeding year”.



	3)	However, on March 27, 2020,  the BIR issued RR No. 7-2020 which provides that the Monthly Remittance Return of Value-Added Tax and Other Percentage Taxes Withheld (Form 1600 with MAP), Withholding Tax Remittance Return for National Government Agencies (Form 1600) and Monthly Remittance Return of Income Taxes Withheld on Compensation (Form 1601C) for the month of March, 2020 with an original due date on April 10, 2020 is extended on May 11, 2020. 



	4)	Review of financial records showed that the taxes due to the government from payments of goods and services to creditors/suppliers, including compensation of employees, were withheld and remitted to the BIR in accordance with the said regulations.



	5)	For CY 2020, the CA withheld and promptly remitted taxes pertaining to compensation of officials and employees and payments to suppliers in the total amount of ₱37,958,522.32 and ₱8,176,088.29, respectively, shown in details in Table Nos. 13 and 14 below:
