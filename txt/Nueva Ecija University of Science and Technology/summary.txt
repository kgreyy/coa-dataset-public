D)	Independent Auditor’s Report 



    As discussed in Part II of this Report, the Auditor rendered a qualified opinion due to unadjusted errors and uncorrected deficiencies affecting the accuracy and reliability of the different accounts in the financial statements such as (a) continued  failure of the University to conduct physical inventory-taking of all properties; (b) non-reconciliation of the discrepancy of ₱854,514.37 between the records of the Accounting Division and those of the Supply/Property Unit; (c) non-maintenance of complete subsidiary records such as Property Cards (PCs), PPE Ledger Cards (PPELCs) and properly accomplished and updated Property Acknowledgement Receipts (PARs); (d) erroneous classification of semi-expendable items under the PPE accounts; e) inclusion as PPE of unserviceable  property costing ₱15,895,812.69, overstating the PPE accounts and the related Accumulated Depreciation by ₱15,895,812.69 and ₱15,106,622.06, respectively. Meanwhile, the related Impairment Loss-PPE was understated by ₱789,190.63; f) non-maintenance of complete and updated Stock Ledger Cards (SLCs) contrary to the  Perpetual Inventory Method; g) recorded issuances of supplies/materials amounting to ₱20,298,578.80 without proper documentation; and h) absence of Report of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI) to substantiate the consumption/issuances for every accounting period, thus, rendering doubt on the accuracy and reliability of the year-end inventory account balances totalling to ₱25,717,084.59 as at year-end.



	For the above exceptions, we recommended and Management agreed to:



--	On Property, Plant and Equipment



a)	Require the Inventory Committee to conduct and complete the annual physical count of PPE and render a Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) as required pursuant to the pertinent provisions in Chapter 10 of GAM for NGAs, Volume 1; and



b)	Direct the Accounting and the Property/Supply Units to (i) maintain and regularly update PPELCs and PCs, respectively, as prescribed in the GAM for NGAs, Volume 1; (ii) conduct regular reconciliation of their records to facilitate adjustments or make corrections, where applicable; (iii) reclassify PPE items costing below ₱15,000.00 to the appropriate Semi-Expendable Property account.  For current year issuances to end-users, debit the appropriate Semi-Expendable Expense account and the Accumulated Surplus/Deficit account for items issued in prior years; (iv) reclassify/derecognize unserviceable property from the related PPE account in accordance with Section 40 of the same Manual; and 5) observe complete and proper documentation of PPE account balances and other adjustments related thereto.



--	On Inventories



c)	Require the University Accountant to strictly comply with the accounting policy and specific guidelines/procedures on the acquisition, issuance, and disposal of inventory items. 



E)	Summary of Other Significant Observations and Recommendations



		 Summarized below are the other significant audit observations with their recommendations, the details of which are presented in Part II of this report. Management views and comments including those offered during the exit conference were incorporated in the report, where appropriate:



1)			No journal entry voucher (JEV) was drawn to take up the funds receipted by the Nueva Ecija University of Science and Technology (NEUST) in the amount of ₱150,649,885.00, representing direct deposit made by the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) under Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) Current Account No. 0022-1120-90 of the NEUST; thus, the bank transaction remained a reconciling item in the Bank Reconciliation Statement (BRS) contrary to Section 6, Chapter 21 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I. Consequently, the Cash Collecting Officer account was overstated while Cash in Bank, Local Currency Current Account (LCCA) was understated by that amount. (Observation No. 1)



We recommended and the University President agreed to require the Accountant to prepare the necessary journal entry voucher (JEV) to correct/adjust the Cash Collecting Officer and Cash in Bank-LCCA accounts in order to present them fairly in the year-end financial statements of the University. 



2)		The composition/breakdown of the Cash in Bank, Local Currency Current Accounts (LCCA)-Trust Fund (TF), with a General Ledger (GL) controlling account balance of  ₱253,819,842.74 as at year-end, could not be determined and fully accounted for due to the absence of subsidiary ledgers (SLs) and delayed/non-submission of related Journal Entry Vouchers (JEVs) and financial reports, inconsistent with Section 111(1) of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1445 and Section 12 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I, thus, affecting the reliability of the recorded amount. (Observation No. 2)



We recommended and the University President agreed to instruct the Finance Management Officer, thru the Accounting Clerk, to turn over to the University Accountant the complete set of SLs for Cash in Bank, LCCA- TF account to effectively monitor the movement of each trust receipt and ensure the reliability of the recorded cash in the books of the Trust Fund.  If no SLs are still maintained, instruct both the MFO and the University Accountant to coordinate in reconstructing the same which shall be tallied with the General Ledger (GL) controlling account balance every end of the accounting period in accordance with the provisions of Section 12 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I.



3)		The accuracy of the Other Receivables-Special Trust Fund (STF) account amounting to ₱4,571,018.11 was uncertain due to non-adjustment of errors committed in 1,091 computer-generated student ledgers/records, out of which a total of ₱3,076,776.21, aged three to 15 years, has doubtful collectability, thus, affecting the fairness of presentation of the account balance in the year-end financial statements. (Observation No. 3)



We recommended and the University President agreed to render the following courses of action:



a)	Require the MISO to generate an updated/corrected report on the actual unpaid fees of students as of December 31, 2020 and furnish a copy thereof to the Audit Team and the Accountant; and



b)	Instruct the University Accountant to (i) draw a journal entry voucher (JEV) adjusting erroneous set-up of receivables and incorrect balances of the accounts on the basis of the updated MISO report, including those identified as fully settled as indicated in the student ledgers; and (ii) monitor the receivables and reconcile with the schedule generated by the University Collection System (UCS) regularly to ensure accurate financial reporting. 



4. 	Various errors/omissions in the recognition of the Accounts Payable resulted in the net overstatement of Assets, Liabilities and Equity accounts by ₱2,104,686.90, ₱3,491,986.68 and ₱1,387,299.58, respectively, contrary to pertinent accounting policies prescribed in the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume 1, and International Public Sector Accounting Standard (IPSAS) No.  17, thus, affecting the fairness of presentation of the accounts in the year-end financial statements. (Observation No. 6)   



We recommended and the University President agreed to require the Accountant to (i) prepare the necessary journal entry voucher (JEV) to correct/adjust the errors/omissions in the recognition of the Accounts Payable and other affected accounts to ensure fairness of presentation in the Financial Statements; (ii) strictly comply with the basic government accounting procedures and principles, particularly the Accrual Basis as prescribed in GAM for NGAs, Volume 1 and IPSAS No. 17.  



1)	The University failed to submit the required financial reports and the corresponding supporting documents thereof within the prescribed period, with delays ranging from one to two months, despite prior recommendations to submit the same; thus, hindering the timely review of financial records and transactions.  As a consequence, the propriety and validity of the reported/recorded Disbursement Vouchers (DVs) and Official Receipts (ORs) in the books of accounts totalling to ₱206,260,717.40 and ₱2,492,749.23, respectively, could not be ascertained contrary to COA Circular Nos. 95-006 and 2009-006 dated May 18, 1995 and September 15, 2009, respectively.  (Observation No. 7)



We reiterated our recommendations and the University President agreed to (a) require the Accountant to closely monitor and supervise the submission of accounts, financial reports and the related supporting documents to meet prescribed deadlines; and (b) enforce the suspension of salaries of responsible officials and employees in case of their continuous failure to abide by the reporting requirements as provided for in Section 122 (2) of P.D. No. 1445. 



6. 	Out of the 23 Curriculum Programs offered by the University, only 14 were aligned with the priority courses under the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) Scholarship Programs (CSPs) for Academic Year (AY) 2019-2020 prescribed under CHED Memorandum Order No. 05, series of 2019 dated August 16, 2019. Moreover, 42% of the total number of students for the same period were enrolled in courses not included in the list of priority courses resulting to over population of enrollees in certain courses and minimal enrollees in other priority courses, which may interfere later with the supply and demand for employment. (Observation No. 10)



	We recommended and the University President agreed to instruct the Director of Admission and Registration to (i) conduct an annual monitoring and assessment of the population of students for each curriculum program; and (ii) align the incoming freshmen students to priority courses as recommended by CHED to avoid overpopulation of enrollees in certain courses and minimal enrollees in priority courses. 

	

2)	For the Academic Years 2016 to 2019, the general average passing rate of 37.15% obtained by the University was relatively lower by 9.05% as compared with the national average passing rate of 46.20% indicating the low performance of graduates in nine out of 12 courses with licensure examinations, thus, impinging on their job employability and may affect the status of the University from the national ranking of Higher Education Institutions (HEIs).  (Observation No. 11)

	

	We recommended and the University President agreed to instruct:

	

	a. The faculty members to exert their best performance in imparting knowledge to their students and pay more attention on their learning progress to make them fully equipped for the licensure examinations; and

	

	b. The Vice President for Academic Affairs (VPAA) to develop and implement strategies towards the development and excellence of the University in terms of improved performance of its graduates in licensure examinations.
