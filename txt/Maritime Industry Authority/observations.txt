A. FINANCIAL AUDIT 
 
1. Of the total misstatements of P732.014 million found in audit due to accounting 

errors and improper accounting treatment of transactions that are considered 
departure from the International Public Sector Accounting Standards, 
P676.027 million have been adjusted, while P55.987 million remained 
uncorrected as at year-end. Hence, based on the material impact of the 
uncorrected misstatements, the reported balances of the affected accounts 
could not be fully relied upon which affect the fairness of the financial 
statements of MARINA as at year-end.   
 

   
Accounting Errors and Improper Accounting Treatment of Transactions 

 
1.1 International Public Sector Accounting Standard (IPSAS) 1, paragraph 27 provides 

that, “Financial statements shall present fairly the financial position, financial 
performance and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful 
representation of the effects of transactions, other events and conditions in 
accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, 
revenue and expenses set out in IPSASs. The application of IPSASs, with additional 
disclosures when necessary, is presumed to result in financial statements that 
achieve a fair presentation.” 

 
1.2 Management, in its submitted Statement of Management Responsibility, declares 

that it is responsible for a faithful representation of the effects of transactions as 
well as the appropriate assertions regarding the recognition, measurement and 
presentation of assets, liabilities, equity, income, expenses and disclosures in 
accordance with the IPSAS. 
 

1.3 Accounting errors and misclassifications aggregating P732,014,163.96 were noted 
in audit of the accounts and related transactions of MARINA. Of the total 
misstatements, P676,027,335.36 were adjusted in the books of accounts, leaving an 
uncorrected total misstatement of P55,986,828.60 (See Annex A). 
 

1.4 The uncorrected misstatements in four (4) accounts are summarized in Table 1 with 
details in the succeeding paragraphs.

1.6 COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009 prescribes the use of the 

Rules and Regulations on the Settlement of Accounts (RRSA). Section 7.2.1(c) of 
the RRSA provides that the Chief Accountant, Bookkeeper or other Authorized 
Official performing accounting and/or bookkeeping functions of the audited agency 
shall ensure that the audit suspensions, disallowances and charges including their 
settlements, are properly monitored and reconciled with the Statement of Audit 
Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges (SASDC) issued by the Auditor. 
Moreover, Section 22.6 of the RRSA requires the Chief Accountant to record in the 
books of accounts the disallowance and/or charge as a receivable on the basis of the 
NFD.  
 

1.7 The year-end balance of the Receivables-Disallowances/Charges account totaling 
P26,561,876.49 as at December 31, 2020 was understated by P790,753.84 due to 
non-recording of NDs with NFD and COE that have remained unsettled in 
MARINA Regional Office (MRO) No. IX. Review of the available records of the 
Notice of Disallowances (NDs), NFDs, COEs, and Notice of Settlement of 
Suspension/Disallowance/Charge (NSSDCs) disclosed that the balance of 
Receivables-Disallowances/Charges account in the books of MRO No. IX should 
reflect a balance of P1,336,599.58 instead of the recorded balance of P545,845.74.  

 
1.8 We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Accountant of MRO 

No. IX to record the unsettled NDs with NFDs to correct the year-end balance 
of the account Receivables-Disallowances/Charges.

1.10 Section 7, Chapter 8, Volume I of Government Accounting Manual for National 

Government Agencies (GAM for NGAs) provides that when inventories are sold, 
exchanged, or distributed, their carrying amount shall be recognized as an expense 
in the period in which the related revenue is recognized. If there is no related 
revenue, the expense is recognized when the goods are distributed or the related 
service is rendered.   
 

1.11 Verification of the Report of Physical Count of Inventories, Reports of Supplies 
and Materials Issued (RSMI), Requisition and Issue Slips (RIS) and Inventory 
Custodian Slips disclosed that the RSMI and RIS of the purchased non-accountable 
forms amounting to P95,000.00 and semi-expendable inventories aggregating to 
P2,656,801.87 were not yet prepared and submitted by the Supply Section to the 
Accounting Division of MARINA CO as basis for recording. As a result, the 
issuances of the non-accountable forms inventory and semi-expendable inventory 
items were overstated by P95,000.00 and P2,561,801.87, respectively. 
Consequently, there was an overstatement in the related expense accounts by the 
same amounts. 

 
1.12 We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Supply Officer of 

MARINA CO to: 
 
a. submit the RSMIs together with copies of the RIS of all issued accountable 

forms and semi-expendable items to the Accounting Division to make the 
necessary adjustments in the Non-Accountable Forms Inventory and 
Semi-Expendable Inventory and the related expense/accumulated surplus 
accounts; and 
 

b. henceforth, submit the RSMI and RIS of all issued inventories to the 
Accounting Division on a monthly basis as required under the GAM for 



53 
 

NGAs to ensure the correctness of the year-end inventory account 
balances.

(19,386,929.39) 
 

1.14 The MRO No. V engaged the service of the DPWH RO No. V to manage the 
implementation of the construction of its office building per Memorandum of 
Agreement (MOA) signed and approved by both parties on December 27, 2018. 
Under the MOA, the DPWH shall implement the project in accordance with the 
plans and specifications prepared by MARINA. Funds transferred to the DPWH 
RO No. V for this project amounted to P55,300,000.00. 
 

1.15 Section 8(g), Chapter 10, Volume I of GAM for NGAs provides that, “During 
construction period, all expenses incurred in relation to the construction of the PPE 
shall be taken up in the books as Construction in Progress (CIP) with the appropriate 
asset classification. As soon as the construction is completed, the CIP account shall 
be reclassified to the proper asset account. xxx” 
  

1.16 Verification of the CIP–Building account as of December 31, 2020 disclosed that 
it still included a completed building amounting P31,077,512.72 in MRO No. V 
which was not reclassified or transferred to the Building account. Based on the 
status and progress of works, construction was already completed last November 
29, 2019 per Certificate of Completion issued by the contractor. It was then 
inspected by the MRO No. V’s inspectorate team on September 11, 2020 with the 
corresponding Certificate of Turn-Over and Custody of the Completed Project on 
the same date, signed by the former Regional Director of MRO No. V. Further, the 
completed building is already occupied and used by MRO No. V. 
 

1.17 However, the liquidation reports corresponding to an additional amount of 
P19,386,929.39 for the completed building was not yet submitted by DPWH RO 
No. V to the MRO No. V. According to the Accountant, this hindered the 
reclassification of the CIP–Building to the appropriate PPE account. 

 



54 
 

1.18 Considering that the project was already completed, accepted, turned over and 
being utilized, MRO No. V could have already recognized in its books the Building 
account.  
 

1.19 The non-recognition of the completed capital asset resulted in the understatement 
of the Building account by P50,464,442.11 and overstatement of the accounts CIP–
Building by P31,077,512.72 and Due from NGAs by P19,386,929.39. 

 
1.20 We recommended and Management agreed to require the MRO No. V 

Accountant to reclassify the cost of MARINA Building from Construction in 
Progress-Buildings and Other Structures to the appropriate Building and 
Other Structures account.

1.22 Section 11, Volume I of GAM for NGAs provides that incurrence of obligations 
shall be made through the issuance of Obligation Request and Status (ORS). The 
ORS shall be prepared by the Requesting/Originating Office supported by valid 
claim’s documents like disbursement voucher, payroll, purchase/job order, itinerary 
of travel, etc. The Head of the Requesting/Originating Office or his/her authorized 
representative shall certify in Section A of the ORS as to the necessity and legality 
of charges to the budget under his/her supervision, and validity and propriety of 
supporting documents. The Head of the Budget Division shall certify to the 



55 
 

availability of allotment and such is duly obligated by signing in Section B of the 
ORS. 
 

1.23 Executive Order No. 109 dated June 10, 1999, as implemented by COA–DBM Joint 
Circular No. 99-06 dated November 13, 1999, requires the reversion, among others, 
of all undocumented payables and unliquidated obligations, irrespective of age. 
 

1.24 In MRO No. IX, review of the Accounts Payable account revealed that payments 
of unpaid obligations for CY 2019 totaling P1,781,062.69 were inadvertently 
debited to other accounts instead of the Accounts Payable account. 
 

1.25 Verification also revealed that all salaries and wages, benefits, and other 
emoluments that are due to the officers and employees of MRO No. IX have already 
been settled but Due to Officers and Employees account still showed a balance of 
P257,114.66 without any valid claims, hence, overstating the account balance by 
the same amount.  Similarly, review of the Accounts Payable revealed that the 
amount of P46,486.00 were not supported with the necessary documents to vouch 
for the propriety of the transactions which have remained outstanding as of the end 
of CY 2020. 
 

1.26 Further, review of budgetary report submitted as of December 31, 2020 disclosed 
that unpaid obligations with filed valid claims for CY 2020 totaling P9,832.57 were 
not recognized as payable/liability at year-end. 
 

1.27 The erroneous accounting entries, recognition of liability without valid claims, 
unrecognized payables and lacking supporting documents resulted in the 
overstatement and understatement of the affected accounts. 
 

1.28 We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Accountant of 
MRO No. IX to prepare the necessary adjusting entries to correct the noted 
errors in the books of accounts and record the unpaid obligation for proper 
recognition of liability account. 

 
 
Accounting Deficiencies Affecting Reliability of Account Balances 

 

2. Accounting deficiencies amounting to P609.399 million due to the failure of 
agency officials concerned to implement the controls required under existing 
regulations in the reconciliation and validation of account balances were 
noted. Based on the possible/potential effects of the various accounting 
deficiencies, the reported balances of the affected accounts could not be relied 
upon.  

 
2.1 Section 6, paragraph (e) Chapter 19, Volume I of GAM for NGAs on Qualitative 

Characteristics of Financial Reporting states that an entity shall present information 
including accounting policies in a manner that meets reliable information which is 



56 
 

free from material error and bias, and can be depended on by users to represent 
faithfully that which it purports to represent or could reasonably be expected to 
represent. 

 
2.2 Audit of the accounts disclosed that there were accounting deficiencies in five (5) 

financial accounts with an aggregate amount of P1,892,237,870.96 which requires 
further analysis, reconciliation, physical count/verification, coordination and future 
corrective actions as these have possible effects on the accuracy and reliability of 
the reported account balances of the agency’s financial statements. Details of these 
are as follows:

2.3 The deficiencies in recording and reporting financial transactions resulting from 

lack of reconciliation of records which affected the reliability of the reported 
account balances in the financial statements are shown in Table 7:

a. Unreliable Cash balance due to unreconciled items in the BRS – P164,520.40 

 
2.4 Audit of the BRS and Cash in Bank accounts revealed discrepancy of P164,520.40 

between the book and bank balance as of December 31, 2020.  
 

2.5 The P164,520.40 is composed of prior period reconciling items amounting to 
P95,488.25 in the Cash in Bank-Local Currency Current Account (CIB-LCCA) 



57 
 

Payroll account and P69,032.15 discrepancy on lapsed Notice of Cash Allocation 
(NCA) under Cash in Bank–Modified Disbursement System (CIB-MDS), Regular. 
 

2.6 The P95,488.25 has been the subject of the previous year’s audit observation. 
Inquiry with the concerned personnel of the Finance Services Division (FSD) 
disclosed that as of audit date, the said amount is yet to be determined because of 
unavailability of supporting documents, thus adjustment could not be made. While 
the P69,032.15 pertains to the difference between the reversion recorded by book 
and by bank due to outstanding checks which became stale in the next quarter. 

 
2.7 Management commented that the discrepancies noted pertain to various reconciling 

items that had occurred from previous years. The reconciliation of these amounts 
requires retrieval of prior years’ documents and tedious and painstaking detailed 
work. Management committed however, to continuously exert their best effort and 
find available options to be able to fully adjust and reconcile those items. 
 

2.8 We recommended and Management agreed to require the MARINA CO 
Accountant to analyze the nature of the unreconciled balance in the payroll 
account and effect the necessary adjustments. 

 
 

b. Dormant Accounts Receivable - P21,939,346.42 
 
2.9 IPSAS 29 paragraph 67 provides that, “An entity shall assess at the end of each 

reporting period whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or 
group of financial assets is impaired. Xxx.” 
 

2.10 Also, IPSAS 29 paragraph 72 provides that, “If there is objective evidence that an 
impairment loss on loans and receivables or held-to-maturity investments carried at 
amortized cost has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the 
difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated 
future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred) 
discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate (i.e., the effective 
interest rate computed at initial recognition). The carrying amount of the asset shall 
be reduced either directly or through use of an allowance account. The amount of 
the loss shall be recognized in surplus or deficit.” 
 

2.11 Section 10, Chapter 17, Volume I of GAM for NGAs provides that “In case of 
Accounts Receivable, the Allowance for Impairment shall be provided in an amount 
based on collectibility of receivable balances and evaluation of such factors as aging 
of accounts, collection experiences of the agency, expected loss experiences and 
identified doubtful accounts.” 

 
2.12 Review of the monitoring of payments and analysis of Accounts Receivable 

account in MARINA CO disclosed that out of the year-end balance of 
P28,519,524.42, only P294,588.50 was collected. Of the P294,588.50 collections, 



58 
 

only P43,444.70 was credited to Accounts Receivable due to the Accounting 
Section’s failure to accrue and record the income in the period to which they relate. 

 
2.13 Per inquiry with the Accounting Division, P21,939,346.42 of the P22,292,471.42 

year-end balance of Accounts Receivable under Fund 101 pertains to unpaid 
Supervision Fees of various shipping companies including related 
interests/penalties which have been dormant for more than five (5) years to over 10 
years. 
 

2.14 Verification revealed that the Management did not provide an allowance for 
impairment for the dormant Accounts Receivable amounting to P21,939,346.42 
aged five (5) years to more than 10 years pursuant to the above provisions, 
rendering the account balance unreliable. 
 

2.15 Moreover, it bears emphasis that on November 20, 2020, a letter from Management 
was received by COA requesting for the write-off of the dormant balances due to 
non-collectability and unavailability of documents which were gutted by fire on 
May 30, 2007. The request for write-off was returned to Management without 
action on December 9, 2020, for submission of the necessary documents for 
evaluation of the Audit Team but remained not submitted as of report date. One of 
the essential documents that was required from Management was the proof of 
exhaustion of all remedies to collect the receivables which they already coordinated 
with the Domestic Shipping Service (DSS) but of no avail. 
 
 

c. Discrepancy between the balances per Subsidiary Ledger balances and the 
Confirmation Replies of Accounts Receivable – P252,970.90 

 
2.16 On January 13, 2021, eight (8) confirmation letters on the Accounts Receivables 

were sent to various ship owners to verify the correctness of their subsidiary ledger 
balances. Of the eight (8) confirmation letters, only one (1) ship owner replied 
(Loadstar International Shipping Inc.) with confirmation balance of P0.00 against 
MARINA CO subsidiary ledger of P252,970.90, or reporting difference in the 
account balances totaling to P252,970.90. 
 

2.17 According to the confirmation reply of Loadstar International Shipping Inc., it has 
no unsettled obligation to MARINA. Further, the ship owner commented that 
Sinulog vessel is not registered under its name contrary to what is recorded in 
MARINA’s books of accounts. 

 
2.18 We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 

a. evaluate the collectability of receivables and provide allowance for 
impairment for receivables aged more than five (5) to 10 years and comply 
with the additional documents in relation to its request for write-off of 
dormant accounts to facilitate audit action thereon; 



59 
 

b. direct the DSS to intensify its efforts to collect the long outstanding 
receivables for tonnage fees by sending demand letters and initiate legal 
actions to delinquent shipping companies, if warranted; and 

 
c. examine the discrepancies between the balances in the subsidiary ledger 

and the Confirmation Reply and accordingly adjust the MARINA CO 
accounting records, as necessary. 

 
 
d. Unreliable Inventory account due to non-reconciliation of accounting and property 

records and non-maintenance of SCs and SLCs – P25,671,368.53 
 

2.19 Section 13, Chapter 8, Volume I of GAM for NGAs requires physical count of 
inventory to be conducted semi-annually for checking the integrity of property 
custodianship. In addition, Section 17, Chapter 8, Volume I of GAM for NGAs 
prescribes the use of the Report on the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) to 
report the physical count of supplies by type of inventory as at a given date, and 
showing the balance of inventory items per card and per count and 
shortage/overage, if any. The report includes semi-expendable property wherein the 
issue is covered by the Inventory Custodian Slip (ICS). 
 

2.20 Appendix 66, Volume II of the same manual also requires that the report shall be 
submitted to the COA Auditor concerned not later than July 31 and January 31 of 
each year for the first and second semesters, respectively. 

 
2.21 The recorded inventories in MARINA CO, MRO Nos. VII and XI showed a 

discrepancy of P25,671,368.53 when compared against the RPCI, as presented in 
Table 8:

Total   113,640,988.20    87,969,619.67    25,671,368.53   

 
2.22 Audit disclosed that in MARINA CO, the RPCI for the 1st semester of CY 2020 

was submitted by the Supply Division on November 27, 2020 and the 2nd Semester 
was submitted only to the Audit Team on March 25, 2021 or 53 days delayed. 
Consequently, the reconciliation of the Inventory accounts balances between the 
General Ledger (GL) and the actual physical count of inventories to examine the 
difference of P22,333,619.86 was, likewise, delayed. No reconciliation to identify 
the discrepancies on inventories was initiated by the Accounting Division and the 
Supply Division during the year.   
 



60 
 

2.23 In MRO Nos. VII and XI, the verification and reconciliation of the Inventory 
accounts balances with inventory count was not made due to the non-submission of 
the RPCI as required by the GAM for NGAs.  
 

2.24 Query with the concerned personnel of the Accounting and Supply Divisions 
commented that the non/late submission of the RPCI was due to voluminous 
workload, lack of manpower and time limitation caused by the Corona Virus 2019 
(COVID-19) pandemic. 

 
2.25 It was also noted that there were other lapses in accounting and property control 

which affected the accuracy and completeness of the Inventory accounts balances:

2.26 The personnel concerned of MARINA CO and the MROs did not comply with the 

provisions of Section 17, Chapter 8, Volume I of GAM for NGAs, which prescribes 
the preparation and maintenance of the following records (i.e., Stock Cards (SC) 
and Stock Ledger Cards (SLC), forms (i.e., RSMIs) and reports (i.e., RPCIs).  The 
non-observance of the said provisions caused lapses in the controls in monitoring 
the acquisitions and issuances, thereby affected the integrity of the Inventory 
accounts balances in the financial statements. 

 
2.27 We recommended and Management agreed to require the concerned 

Accountant and Supply Officer of the MROs concerned to: 
 

a. facilitate the completion of the reconciliation, identify and accordingly 
adjust the reconciling items disclosed to reflect the correct balance of each 
Inventory account; 
 

b. keep updated SLCs and SCs for each type of supplies; 
 
c. promptly prepare and submit the RSMIs to the Accounting Division for 

recording and posting in the SLCs; and 
 



61 
 

d. properly accomplish the RPCI within the prescribed period in accordance 
with Appendix 66, Volume II of GAM for NGAs. 

 
 
e. Unreliable PPE account due to discrepancy of book balance against the RPCPPE – 

P560,980,419.55 
 
2.28 Section 42, Chapter 10, Volume I of GAM for NGAs provides that the Property 

and Supply Office/Unit shall maintain Property Card (PC) for each class of PPE in 
their custody to account for the receipt and disposition of the same. The balance per 
PC shall be reconciled with PPE Ledger Card (PPELC) maintained by the 
Accounting Division/Unit. Section 38 of the same chapter of GAM for NGAs 
requires the conduct of periodic physical count of PPE, which shall be done 
annually and presented on the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and 
Equipment as at December 31 of each year. 
 

2.29 In MARINA CO, MROs IV, VI, VII, IX, XI and XIII, the accuracy and existence 
of reported book balances totaling P935,605,656.84 cannot be fully ascertained due 
to the reported unreconciled difference of P560,980,419.55 with the RPCPPEs of 
the property office or non-submission thereof to support validity of PPEs existence 
and accurate book balances; while in some MROs, PPELCs and PCs are not 
properly maintained to account for the details of receipt and disposition of PPEs to 
facilitate reconciliation.  Details are shown in Table 10.

continue to be part of the Property, Plant and Equipment account of MRO No. X 
even though they no longer provide the entity with future economic benefits or 
service potential. The amount includes properties amounting P1,505,860.42 
allegedly disposed of but still in the books for lack of basis in dropping from the 
books of accounts and considered to be properties that are missing or non-existent. 
 

2.31 We recommended and Management agreed to require the: 
 

a. accountants and the Property Officers of MARINA CO, MRO Nos.  IV, IX 
and XIII to reconcile their respective records and further direct the 
Accountants to prepare the necessary adjusting entries resulting from the 
said reconciliation. Also, require the concerned Property Officers to 
maintain and update the required Property Cards and reconcile these 
records with the RPCPPE; 
 

b. inventory Committee and Property Custodian of MRO Nos. VI and VII to 
prepare inventory listing of depreciable PPEs issued per 
Department/District Office to facilitate conduct of physical count;  



63 
 

c. designated Property Officer of MRO Nos. VI and XI to submit the 
RPCPPE for CY 2020 to the Office of the COA Auditor; and 
 

d. MRO No. X Disposal Committee to (i) immediately carry out the disposal 
of the reported unserviceable properties and the corresponding de-
recognition of the same after the disposal; (ii) follow the procedures for 
missing/non-existent properties despite exhaustion of diligent efforts as 
prescribed under Section 7.11 of COA Circular No. 2020-06 dated January 
31, 2020. 

 
 

f. Unreliable Expense accounts - P389,968.74 
 
2.32 Section 4 (1) of PD No. 1445 states that: “No money shall be paid out of any public 

treasury of depository except in pursuance of an appropriation law or other specific 
statutory authority.” While Section 119 provides that: “All lawful expenditures and 
expenditures incurred during the year shall be taken up in the accounts of that year.” 
 

2.33 Likewise, Section 6(b), Chapter 2, Volume I of GAM for NGAs pertaining to the 
Basic Government Accounting and Budget Reporting Principles provides that: 
“Each entity shall recognize and present its financial transactions and operations in 
conformity to: (b) accrual basis of accounting in accordance with the International 
Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS).” 
 

2.34 It was noted that the MRO No. V recorded the amount of P514,367.81 as Accounts 
Payable as of December 31, 2019.  However, there were CY 2019 expenses in the 
total amount of P389,968.74 that were not included as Accounts Payable, instead 
these were charged to current year’s appropriation as regular expenses. 
 

2.35 The charging of prior year’s expenses to current year appropriation resulted in the 
understatement of prior year’s expenses and Accounts Payable accounts and 
overstatement of related expense accounts of the year under audit. Moreover, it is 
not in accordance with the aforementioned regulations, thus, affected the validity 
and propriety of the transactions. 
 

2.36 The Accountant and the Budget Officer of MRO No. V commented that they can 
no longer set-up those prior year’s expenses as Accounts Payable due to non-
availability of allotment to obligate the said expenditures. They made an advanced 
request from the Central Office and had a series of follow ups for the additional 
allotment but none was received until year end, hence, the charging of the said 
expenditures to the current year’s appropriation. The Accountant further stated that 
she could not set-up those expenses as Accounts Payable because the Statement of 
Accounts were not yet available at year-end. 
 

2.37 But it was noted that several of the prior year’s expenses charged to the current year 
were fixed expenses, like rent, internet and payment of the monthly contributions 



64 
 

for the maintenance and security of the Regional Government Center. For some 
fixed expenses, the amounts may slightly vary, as in the case of utilities, but they 
are due on a regular basis, thus can be validly set-up as payable during year-end 
without the need of the Statement of Account. Therefore, it is proper that the 
Accounting Unit should have a monitoring procedure on those fixed expenses not 
yet paid as of year-end for inclusion to the Accounts Payable.  
 

2.38 In the case of unpaid salaries of JO personnel, it can be computed reliably at year 
end because the basic document, which is the DTR as basis for the number of days 
to be paid, is available in the Office.  
 

2.39 Lastly, those purchases already delivered by the supplier, inspected and accepted 
by the agency, and with approved and obligated Purchase Order but not yet paid as 
of year-end due to non-availability of cash, were valid claims that should also be 
included as Accounts Payable.  
 

2.40 Payment for prior year’s expenses, though charged to current year’s appropriations, 
should be appropriately taken up in the books of accounts using the account 
Accumulated Surplus/Deficit–Prior Year’s Adjustment, to observe the proper 
recording and recognition of expenses, in accordance with Section 6(b), Chapter 2, 
Volume I of GAM for NGAs to ensure fair presentation and reliability of the 
Expense account balances in the Financial Statements. 
 

2.41 We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant and Budget 
Officer of MRO No. V to: 

 
a. properly coordinate to have all the expenditures obligated and recorded 

in the year these were incurred. Unpaid obligations/expenses incurred 
during the year should be recorded as Accounts Payable to validate their 
payments in the succeeding year and in order to have a fair presentation 
of the financial statements at year end; and 

 
b. discontinue the practice of charging prior year’s expenditures to current 

year’s appropriations and observe the proper matching of expenses 
against appropriations pursuant to applicable provisions of law and 
regulations.  

 
 
B. COMPLIANCE AUDIT 
 
Utilization of allotments and cash allocations 

 
3. Of the total allotments of P759.133 million received by MARINA in CY 2020, 

P723.626 million or 95.32 percent thereof was obligated leaving an unobligated 
balance of P35.507 million. Disbursement rate based on obligations was 93.46 
percent in the amount of P676.279 million. Moreover, only 34.61 percent was 



65 
 

obligated and 57.09 percent was disbursed from the continuing appropriations 
of P13.431 million resulting in the reversion of P8.783 million to the 
unappropriated Surplus of the General Fund.  As a result, the expected 
outputs and benefits that could have been derived from the full utilization of 
the allotments were not accomplished and fully attained. 
 

3.1  Section 60 of the General Provisions of Republic Act (RA) No. 11465 or the 
General Appropriations Act (GAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 provides that, “All 
appropriations authorized under FY 2020 GAA, including budgetary support to 
GOCCs and SAGF, shall be available for release and disbursement for the purpose 
specified, and under the same General and Special Provisions of said GAA 
applicable thereto until December 31, 2020. All unreleased appropriations or 
unexpended or undisbursed funds shall revert to the unappropriated Surplus of the 
General Fund.” 
 

3.2 Likewise, Section 70 of the General Provisions of RA No. 11465 provides that “As 
a general rule, departments, bureaus and offices of the national government xxx 
shall spend what is programmed in their respective appropriations.” 
 

3.3  Further, Paragraph 3.4 of the National Budget Circular No. 578 dated January 6, 
2020 provides that, “With the adoption of the Cash Budgeting System (CBS) and 
consistent with Section 60, GPs of the FY 2020 GM, all appropriations authorized 
under the FY 2020 GM, including budgetary support to GOCCs and SAGF, shall 
be available for release and disbursement for the purpose specified, and under the 
same General and Special Provisions of said GM applicable thereto until December 
31, 2020.” 
 

3.4 Review of MARINA’s Budget and Financial Accountability Reports (BFARs) 
showed that of the total appropriations of P809,133,135.17 for CY 2020, the 
amount of P759,133,135.17 was received as allotments including funds from 
Continuing Appropriations. Of the total allotments received, P759,133,135.17 or 
95.32 percent was obligated, leaving an unobligated balance of P35,507,441.70.      
A total of P676,278,732.17 or 93.46 percent was disbursed, as summarized in

3.6 As shown in Table 12, the obligation rate of the MOOE based on current year’s 
appropriations was 91.12 percent and 34.61 percent based on continuing 
appropriations.  

 
3.7  On the other hand, the disbursement rate of MOOE based on current year’s 

appropriations was 86.10 percent while disbursement rate was only 50.39 percent 
for Capital Outlay (CO) based on the continuing appropriations. 



67 
 

 
The low obligation rates were largely attributed to the following: 
 PS – retired and resigned personnel 
 MOOE – late procurement of Accountable Forms  
 CO – excess/savings from CY 2019 

 
3.8 Inquiry with the Budget Division disclosed that the unobligated balance on the PS 

was intended for personnel of MROs who resigned and retired during the year. The 
fund for Miscellaneous Personnel Benefit Fund (MPBF) was not used by the MROs 
because the first tranche of the Salary Standardization Law of 2019 was sourced 
from the current PS appropriations. While the non-obligation of the excess or 
savings from CY 2019 of CO was due to programs proposed but did not progress 
because of limited time for the procurement activities due to the COVID-19 
pandemic that beset the country. 
 

3.9 Also, based on the CY 2020 Annual Procurement Plan (APP) of the agency, the 
procurement of the Accountable Forms was scheduled in the 1st Quarter of CY 
2020 but was pursued only in the 3rd and 4th quarters of CY 2020.  
 

3.10 Notwithstanding the high overall obligation and disbursement rates, MARINA was 
not able to maximize the utilization of its allotments pursuant to Section 70 of 
General Provisions of RA No. 11465. 
 

3.11 In relation to the foregoing paragraphs, Sections 4.0 and 5.0 of DBM Circular Letter 
No. 2013-12 dated November 21, 2013 states in part the following to further 
enhance the ability of agencies to fully utilize their NCAs by extending their 
validity to a quarterly basis instead of a monthly basis: 
 

“Starting January 1, 2014, all NCAs for crediting to Regular MDS sub-accounts 
for any month, whether part of the comprehensive releases or constituting 
additional NCA releases, shall be valid until the last working day of the 3rd 
month of that quarter. NCAs released during the quarter, e.g., February and 
March, shall be valid up to March 31, etc. 

 
The NCA shall be credited by the MDS-GSB to the agency's/OUs MDS sub-
account on the first working day of each month, consistent with the supporting 
monthly schedule of the agency's/OU's cash requirements. The MDS-GSB shall 
automatically credit any unutilized NCA, corresponding to the book balance at 
the end of the month, to the immediately succeeding month within the same 
quarter.” 

 
3.12 Out of the P783,669,484.55 NCA and Notice of Transfer of Allocation (NTA) 

received by MARINA for CY 2020, the amount of P764,714,708.04 was utilized 
and P18,954,776.51 or 2.42 percent was reverted to the unappropriated Surplus of 
the General Fund, details in Table 13:

3.13 Shown differently, the chart below viewed the graphical representation of the 

MARINA Offices’ NCA/NTA utilization in CY 2020. 
 

 
 

3.14 It can be noted from Table 13 that the overall utilization rate of NCA/NTA by 
MARINA is high at 97.58 percent. Despite the relatively high NCA/NTA 
utilization rates, substantial amounts of P14,014,328.99 and P2,995,167.06 were 
reverted to the BTr by the MARINA Central Office and MRO No. VIII, 
respectively.  
 

3.15 Inquiry with the Accounting Division of MARINA CO revealed that the 
P14,014,328.99 pertains to the NCA intended for the programs not pursued during 
the 2nd quarter due to the Enhanced Community Quarantine imposed by the 
government. 

 
3.16 Management commented that the bulk of the unobligated allotment was due to 

failed bidding for the procurement of Seafarers Record Book (SRB) which 
amounted to a total of P24,987,419.30. The CY 2019 residual savings from Capital 
Outlays were left unused and reverted back to the BTr due to the present COVID-
19 pandemic situation. 
 



69 
 

3.17 We recommended and Management agreed to consider other approaches, 
ways and strategies to ensure the full utilization of MARINA’s allotments and 
NCAs through adequate planning and monitoring of the Agency’s programs 
and projects and the timely execution of all planned activities despite the 
challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.  
 

 
Lapses on internal control on cash management 
 
4. Lapses on internal control on cash management system of MRO Nos.  IV, VII 

and XI were noted due to non-adherence with government laws, rules and 
regulations on the establishment and maintenance of controls over collections 
and deposits, and on the grant and utilization of PCF, which exposes 
government funds to   possible risks of loss and misuse. 

 
4.1 Review of the MARINA Offices’ compliance with government laws, rules and 

regulations on the establishment and maintenance of controls over collections and 
deposits, grant and utilization of PCF revealed the following: 

 
Table 14 - Lapses on Internal Controls on Cash Management 

Office/ 
Region Observations 

LRRs/Specific Requirements/ 
Provisions Remarks 

IV a. Collections 
were not 
deposited 
intact and daily 
by the AO 

Section 69 of PD No. 1445 
provides that public officers 
authorized to receive and collect 
moneys arising from taxes, 
revenues, or receipts of any kind 
shall remit or deposit intact the 
full amounts so received and 
collected by them with the 
proper government depository 
not later than the following 
banking day. 

Audit disclosed that daily collections 
of the Lucena Extension Office were 
not deposited intact with the Land 
Bank of the Philippines Lucena 
Branch, with delays ranging from two 
(2) to six (6) days. The Special 
Collecting Officer (SCO) rationalized 
that the recent late deposits were the 
result of the ongoing COVID-19 
pandemic, thus, deposit of collections 
were done once a week to limit the risk 
of exposure to COVID-19. 
 
Failure of the SCO to deposit her 
collections intact and on a daily basis 
resulted in the accumulation of cash 
amounting to P103,821.12 in her 
possession thereby exposing 
government funds to risk of loss or 
misuse. 

b. AO was not 
properly 
bonded 

Section 4.9 of Treasury Circular 
No. 02-2009 dated August 6, 
2009 or the Revised Omnibus 
Regulations Governing Fidelity 
Bonding of Accountable Public 
Officers provides that – “xxx. 
The Fidelity bond shall be 
subject to renewal yearly before 
the expiration of the present 
bond coverage while the 

Audit revealed that the Petty Cash 
Fund Custodian (PCFC), who is 
performing disbursing functions, has 
an expired fidelity bond since June 4, 
2020 and the application for renewal 
was only transmitted to the Regional 
Office on June 17, 2020, thus, any loss 
incurred within the uninsured period 
shall not be covered by the Fidelity

such position for which he was 
bonded. Failure to renew shall 
consider such bond as 
automatically cancelled and 
shall have no legal effect.” 
 

Fund, consequently, to the 
disadvantage of the Agency. 

c. PCF was more 
than the 
average 
monthly petty 
operating 
expenses 
 

Section 35, Chapter 6 of GAM 
for NGAs, Volume I, provide 
that – “PCF to be set up shall be 
sufficient for the recurring petty 
operating expenses of the 
agency for one (1) month. It 
shall be maintained using the 
Imprest System. All 
replenishments shall be directly 
charged to the expense account 
and at all times, the PCF shall be 
equal to the total cash on hand 
and the unreplenished expenses. 
The PCF shall be replenished as 
soon as disbursements reach at 
least 75% or as needed.” 
 

Evaluation of PCF Liquidation/ 
Replenishment Reports and the 
supporting Petty Cash Vouchers 
(PCVs) of the PCF Custodian revealed 
that for the period July to December 
2019 and January to June 2020 
amounted to P5,487.00 and 
P5,363.20, respectively, totaling to 
P10,850,20, or an average of P904.18 
per month. Further audit disclosed that 
the common monthly recurring 
expenses were for water refill and 
transportation. Evidently, the 
P20,000.00 PCF allocated for one (1) 
month is deemed excessive for such 
disbursements. 
 
Excessive amount of PCF in the hands 
of the PCFC exposes the funds to 
possible risk of loss or misuse and 
which could have been used by the 
agency for other purpose/s. 
 

d. Other Internal 
Control 
Weaknesses 

Assessment on the soundness of 
internal control in the 
disbursement, handling and 
custody of cash of all the AOs 
who were audited using Internal 
Control Questionnaire 
prescribed in the Revised Cash 
Examination Manual 

a. The SCO does not maintain Cash 
Receipts Register or its equivalent; 

b. The SCO does not prepare a 
Report of Accountability of 
Accountable Forms (RAAF) in the 
prescribed format and frequency; 
and 

c. Paid PCVs awaiting for 
replenishments were approved 
without properly filling out the 
details. 

 
XI 

 
e. Regular 

expenses were 
paid from PCF 

Section 35(a) Chapter 6 of 
GAM for NGAs, Volume I, 
provides that – “the fund shall 
be kept separately from the 
regular cash advances/ 
collections and shall not be used 
for payment of regular expenses 
such as rentals, subscriptions, 
light and water bills, purchase of 
supplies and materials for stock 
purposes, and the like. xxx” 
 

For CY 2020, total disbursements 
made through PCF amounted to 
P218,939.06. Of this amount, 
P153,505.46 pertains to payments for 
regular expenses, as follows:  
 

Account Amount 
Telephone Expenses – 
Mobile 27,375.00 

Fuel, Oil and 
Lubricants Expenses 

112,809.94

charging of the above related expenses 
to PCF has been the practice of the 
agency. 
 

IV, VII 
& XI 

f. Certain 
Disbursements 
were found 
lacking of 
documentary 
requirements. 

Item c of Section 36, Chapter 6 
of GAM for NGAs, Volume I, 
prescribed the documentary 
requirements for liquidation of 
PCF by requesting offices, such 
as, but not limited to approved 
purchase request with certificate 
of Emergency Purchase if 
necessary, Inspection and 
Acceptance Report (IAR), 
Waste Materials Report (WMR) 
in case of replacement/repair, 
Approved Trip Ticket, for 
gasoline/fuel expenses, PCVs 
duly accomplished and signed. 
 

In MRO No. IV, review of the 
supporting documents for the 
disbursements made out of PCF 
disclosed that some disbursements 
paid PCVs awaiting for 
replenishments were approved 
without properly filling out the details. 
Further, traveling expenses were not 
supported by the required Itineraries 
of Travel.  
 
In MRO No. VII, reimbursement and 
liquidation amounting to P8,754.91 
were not supported with Approved 
Trip Ticket for gasoline/fuel expenses. 
 
In MRO No. XI, disbursements 
totaling P34,261.95 were not 
supported with approved Purchase 
Request with certificate of Emergency 
Purchase, IAR and WMR. 
 

 
4.2 We recommended and MRO Nos.  IV, VII and XI agreed to: 

 
a. deposit intact all collections with the Authorized Government Depository 

Bank (AGDB) daily or not later than the next banking day to effectively 
strengthen the internal control in the collection, deposit, handling and 
custody of cash. If it is not possible due to the community quarantines and 
restrictions, the agency can make arrangement with the AGDB for online 
banking deposit, if available; 
 

b. comply with the Treasury Circular No. 02-2009 dated August 6, 2009 or 
the Revised Omnibus Regulations Governing Fidelity Bonding of 
Accountable Public Officers; 
 

c. reduce the amount of PCF to appropriate amount based on average 
monthly petty operating expense; 
 



72 
 

d. direct the disbursing officers to: 
 
 discontinue paying regular expenses out of the PCF such as light and 

water; 
 accomplish properly the PCVs and follow the procedures prescribed 

under Section 38, Chapter 6, Volume I of GAM for NGAs, in relation 
to the handling of PCF; 

 support the liquidation of cash advances from the PCF with  complete 
documentation;  
 

e. implement other measures to address the internal control weaknesses and 
ensure that a strong internal control in the disbursement, handling and 
custody of cash is consistently maintained, as follows: 

 
 instruct the AOs to maintain a cash book or Cash Receipts Register 

reflecting daily transactions with proper certifications; and 
 prepare and submit monthly the Report of Accountability for 

Accountable Forms in the prescribed format in accordance with 
Appendix No. 67, Volume II of GAM for NGAs.  

 
 
Long outstanding Inter-Agency Receivables – P66,558,742.62 
 
5. Funds transferred by MARINA CO to the Philippine International Trading 

Corporation (PITC) totaling P63.259 million as at December 31, 2020 
remained outstanding in the books from over two (2) years to more than six 
(6) years, while in MRO Nos. I and II, three (3) units of Multi-Purpose Vehicle 
worth P3.3 million procured through PITC remained undelivered as at 
December 31, 2020, thus the purposes intended for the fund transfers were not 
attained on time. 
 

5.1 COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 3, 1994 provides for the Rules and 
Regulations in the Grant, Utilization and Liquidation of Funds Transferred to 
Implementing Agencies (IAs) which specifically requires that: 
 
a. Within 10 days after the end of each month or after the end of the project, the 

IA shall submit to the Source Agency (SA) the Report of Checks Issued (RCI) 
and the Report of Disbursements to report the utilization of funds or the actual 
project expenses.  The reports shall be approved by the Head of the IA.   

 
b. The IA shall return to the SA any unused balance upon completion of the 

project. 
 
c. One of the duties and responsibilities of the SA is to require the IA to submit 

the reports and furnish the IA with a copy of the JEV taking up the 
expenditures. 



73 
 

 
5.2 Moreover, COA Circular 2016-002 dated May 31, 2016 requires that the 

Accountant shall certify that funds previously transferred to the IA has been 
liquidated and accounted for in the books. 
 

5.3 The aging of the Inter-Agency Liabilities of the MARINA CO and MRO Nos. I and 
II is presented in Table 15:

noted in the audit of said accounts: 
 

Table 16 – Deficiencies noted on Funds Transferred to PITC 
Office/

CO i. Unliquidated Fund Transfers to PITC – 
P63,258,742.62 

 
The transferred balance to PITC of P63,258,742.62 
remained unliquidated as at December 31, 2020 due to 
failure of the responsible persons to submit the required 
documents to PITC, lack of consistent follow-ups and 
monitoring with PITC by the end-user  and slow 
procurement process of PITC. Breakdown are as 
follows: 
 

Particulars Amount  (In PhP) 
Capacity Building Activities 1,617,080.10 
ICT Equipment for STCW 36,740,000.00 
Development and Installation of 
Seafarer’s Identity Document (SID) 
System (Retention Fee and Service 
Charge)

Shipping System 

9,400,000.00 

Digitization of Records 4,850,000.00 
Total 63,258,742.62 

 
The accumulation of the above outstanding fund transfer 
to PITC are due to the following: 
 
a. The project on the procurement of Information and 

Technology (IT) equipment amounting to 
P36,740,000.00 transferred on December 7, 2015  

We reiterated our prior year’s 
recommendation that 
Management  consistently follow-
up and coordinate with PITC on 
the required documents to be 
submitted and requirements to be 
complied with, to facilitate the 
liquidation of the completed 
projects, and the start of the 
procurement process of the 
unimplemented projects. 

 
Management of MARINA CO 
commented that a follow-up letter 
was sent to PITC for the liquidation 
of the P1,617,080.00 remaining 
balance for STCWO capacity 
building activities, and the 
P36,740,000.00 was already 
reverted back to the Bureau of 
Treasury. Management also 
commented that they are 
coordinating with PITC regarding 
the P9,400,000.00 transferred funds 
which will be used to procure  the 
hardware component of the project 
since the software component was 
developed already by the 
Management Information System 
Service of MARINA.

was not yet started despite our previous 
recommendations to revise the Agency Outsourcing 
Request and/or evaluate the necessity of the 
procurement project. 

 
b. The fund transferred for the project, Development 

and Installation of an Integrated Domestic Shipping 
System (IMDSS) in the amount of P9,400,000.00 
with an original project cost of P19,000,000.00 has 
not been implemented due to incomplete transfer of 
the total amount of the project cost.  Per information 
gathered from the OIC-Director of Management 
Information Systems Service, the system has been 
developed by their Office and scheduled for pilot 
testing. 
 

c. The procurement on the digitization of documents 
amounting to P4,850,000.00 was not yet started by 
PITC even if MARINA already submitted the 
documents required by PITC. 

 
The foregoing audit observations were already 
mentioned in the previous Annual Audit Reports, 
however, there seems a lack of effort in addressing the 
issues, particularly the refund/return of the remaining 
balance of the STCWO Capacity Building Activities 
amounting to P1,617,080.10 which is outstanding for 
more than six (6) years.  
 
The lack of consistent follow-ups and monitoring by the 
end-user with PITC and slow procurement process of 
PITC deprived the whole MARINA and the public of the 
benefits that could have been derived therefrom if only 
the projects have been completed/delivered on time. 
 

 

I and II ii. Undelivered Multi-Purpose Vehicle (MPV) – 
P3,300,000.00  
 

This has been an audit observation since 2018 and we 
deemed it important to reiterate it for the current year due 
to non-implementation of the audit recommendations 
previously communicated. 

 
Three (3) units Multi-Purpose Vehicle worth 
P3,300,000.00 procured through PITC remained 
undelivered as at December 31, 2020 depriving the 
Agency of the immediate use and benefits of the assets. 

 
MARINA deviated from the stipulations in the 
Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) as it had already 
transferred the entire amount of P3,300,000.00, inclusive 
of service fee and VAT, to PITC on December 28, 2018 
under Check No. 1568482 dated December 27, 2018, 

We recommended and 
Management agreed to: 
 
a. demand for the immediate 

delivery of the ordered motor 
vehicles to be able to enjoy the 
benefits of a roadworthy 
vehicle for the effective 
implementation of its 
programs and projects; 
 

b. direct the Accounting 
Division to issue a 
confirmation letter to the 
AGDB where the MOA 
account was opened to 
establish the interest earned 
of the funds transferred and 



75 
 

Office/ 
Region Observations Recommendations 

without satisfying the agreed conditions by PITC which 
is detrimental on the part of MARINA.  
Despite payment/fund transfer of the full amount of 
ABC for the Multi-Purpose Vehicles and service fee 
including VAT to PITC, no delivery was made as at 
December 31, 2020 since no stipulated timeline of 
delivery was stated in the MOA which the Audit Team 
finds disadvantageous to the Agency, considering its 
need of the said vehicles to effectively accomplish its 
mandate. Delays in the delivery of procured items 
deprived the Agency of immediate expected benefits for 
the effective implementation of its programs and 
projects. 
 

record the same as receivable; 
and 
 

c. refrain from availing of the 
services of PITC and entering 
MOA with conditions which 
are disadvantageous to the 
Agency. 

 
Management informed the Audit 
Team that the procurement of three 
(3) MPVs by PITC was suspended 
because the latter required the 
Agency to change the Terms of 
Reference which is being done by 
Management. 
 
The Audit Team reiterated the audit 
recommendations to the 
Management to hasten the 
immediate procurement and 
delivery of the vehicles. 
Management concurred with our 
audit recommendations and 
promised to take action in 
compliance with our 
recommendations. 
 

 
 
Procurement activities not in accordance with the Revised Implementing Rules and 
Regulations of RA No. 9184  
 

6. MARINA CO and MRO Nos. I, II, V and XIII did not faithfully adhere to 
laws, rules and regulations on government procurement prescribed under 
Republic Act No. 9184 and its Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations 
(RIRR), hence, casting doubts on the integrity and reliability of the 
procurement processes and/or reasonableness of cost of the awarded 
contracts. 

 
6.1 RA No. 9184 otherwise known as the “Government Procurement Reform Act” and 

its RIRR was enacted to ensure that all procurement of the National Government, 
its department, bureaus, offices and agencies shall be governed by the principles of 
transparency in the procurement process and implementation, employs 
competitiveness, streamlined, and follows a simple and modern-technology 
adaptable procurement process that will uniformly apply to all government 
procurement. Moreover, the Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB) issued 
Manual of Procedures for different modes of procurement to provide detailed 
guidelines to government agencies in the conduct of procurement activities.

6.2 Review of contracts on procurement of goods and services in CY 2020 disclosed 

that MARINA CO and MRO No. V have not strictly complied with the provisions 
of RA No. 9184 and its RIRR. The noted deficiencies are presented in Table 17.

6.3 MARINA CO commented that they did not impose liquidated damages on one (1) 

contractor since the delay was attributed to the declaration of ECQ due to the 
COVID-19 pandemic. However, it is to be pointed out that the said contractor 
already incurred delays prior to the imposition of ECQ, hence, liquidated damages 
must be imposed pursuant to Section 8.1 of Annex “D” of the RIRR of RA No. 
9184. 
 

6.4 In MRO Nos. I, II and XIII, the concerned audit teams noted that there were no 
Annual Procurement Plan (APP) prepared for Non-Common Use Supplies contrary 
to the requirements provided under Section 7.2 of the RIRR of RA No. 9184 stating 
that no procurement shall be undertaken unless it is in accordance with the approved 
APP and must be consistent with the duly approved yearly budget of the Procuring 
Entity. 
    

6.5 The non-compliance with the prescribed rules and regulations on government 
procurement had defeated the purpose of the law on transparency, competitiveness 
and accountability. 

 
6.6 We recommended and Management agreed to require all those concerned to 

observe strict compliance with the applicable provisions of the RIRR of RA 
No. 9184 and of other rules and regulations on government procurement. Also, 
for MARINA CO to impose the liquidated damages on the defaulting 
contractors in accordance with Section 8.1 of Annex “D” of the RIRR of RA 
No. 9184. 
 

 
Inactive bank account – P86,497.15 
 
7. One (1) bank account maintained by MRO No. VII with an outstanding 

balance of P86,497.15 was not closed despite being inactive for more than five 
(5) years contrary to the COA Circular 2015-001 dated January 29, 2015 and 
DOF-DBM-COA Joint Circular No. 4-2012 dated September 11, 2012. 

 
7.1 DOF, DBM, COA (Permanent Committee) Joint Circular No. 4-2012 dated 

September 11, 2012 provides the rules and regulations implementing Executive 
Order No. 431 dated May 30, 2005 directing the reversion of all dormant accounts, 
unnecessary special and trust funds to the General Fund and for other purposes. 

7.2 Relatively, COA Circular No. 2015-001 dated January 29, 2015 prescribes the 
guidelines and procedures in the reversion to the General Fund of all dormant cash, 



79 
 

unauthorized accounts, unnecessary special and trust funds and related accounts 
without valid claimants in conformity with the Permanent Committee Joint Circular 
No. 4-2012. 

 
The procedural guidelines require the thorough analysis of the cash accounts, 
preparation of the disbursement voucher and check for the withdrawal of the 
dormant/unauthorized cash balances, and their deposit to the National Treasury. 
 

7.3 On the other hand, as defined under Section 3.2 of DOF-DBM-COA Joint Circular 
No. 4-2012 dated September 11, 2012, unnecessary special and trust funds refer to 
the authorized special and trust funds maintained by government agencies with 
Authorized Government Depository Banks (AGDBs) but which are no longer 
necessary for the attainment of the purposes for which said funds were established 
i.e., specific projects/programs, the implementation of which have completed or 
abandoned.  

 
7.4 Review showed that the Cash in Bank–Local Currency, Current Account (Account 

No. 1452-1024-35) represents the balance of the amount deducted from retired 
employees’ claims in prior years with interest pending requests for compliance of 
documents needed due to suspensions and disallowances. The balance worth 
P86,497.15 remained inactive since December 31, 2015.   

 
7.5 We recommended and Management of MRO No. VII agreed to cause the 

closure of the identified dormant bank account, remit the unexpended balance 
to the Bureau of the Treasury following the prescribed procedures under COA 
Circular No. 2015-001, and furnish the Audit Team of the documentations 
thereof. 

 
Delayed/Non-submission/Non-preparation of Various Financial Reports and Documents 
 
8. Accounting and budgetary reports with their supporting documents were not 

submitted to the MROs audit teams within the prescribed period which 
prevented the timely conduct of audit and evaluation of financial accounts and 
transactions. 

 
8.1 Pursuant to Section 122 of PD No. 1445, COA may, whenever deemed necessary 

in the exigencies of the service and under regulations issued by it, require the 
agency heads, chief accountants, budget officers, cashiers, disbursing officers, 
 administrative or personnel officers, and other responsible officials of the various 
 agencies to submit trial balances, physical inventory reports, current plantilla of 
 personnel, and such other reports as may be necessary for the exercise of its 
 functions. 

 
8.2 In view of the above authority, COA promulgated the GAM for NGAs which, 

among others, requires the submission of documents and financial reports to COA 
within a prescribed timeline to enable the timely conduct of post audit of 



80 
 

transactions and periodic/annual evaluation on accuracy and completeness of 
balances reflected in the books. 
 

8.3 Verification of records of documents received from MROs Management revealed 
non-submission or delayed submission of various Accounting and Budgetary 
reports and documents vis-à-vis the respective prescribed timelines, as presented in

Commission on Women-
National Economic 
Development Authority-
Department of Budget and 
Management (PCW-NEDA-

01 require, among others, all 
agencies of the government to 
integrate GAD Plan in the 
regular activities of the agencies 
and allocate at least five percent 
(5%) of their budgets. 
 
PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint 
Circular No. 2012-01 requires 
that the GPB and 
Accomplishment Report must be 
endorsed by the PCW. 
 
Item V of COA Circular No. 
2014-001 dated March 18, 2014 
requires that the Audited agency 
shall submit a copy of the 
Annual GAD Plan and Budget 
(GPB) to the COA, Audit Team 
assigned to the agency within 
five (5) working days from the 
receipt of the approved plan 
from the PCW or their mother or 
central offices, as the case 
maybe. 
 

Of the 12 MARINA Offices, only seven (7) were able to allocate 
and utilize at least five percent (5%) of their budget for 
implementation of GAD activities as provided in Section 32 of RA 
11260 and PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01.  
 
The MARINA Offices implemented GAD-related activities. However, 
only seven MARINA Offices reported at least 5 percent allocation and 
utilization of budget for GAD Programs/Activities, as shown below:

Review on the compliance with PCW Memorandum Circular No. 
2020-03 disclosed that MARINA-CO did not revise its FY 2020 GPB, 
thus, failed to implement measures to address gender issues and 
concerns arising from the unequal status of their women and men 
stakeholders due to the COVID-19 situation. Interview with the 
personnel concerned disclosed that due to limited time and workforce 
of the GFPS-TWG, the revision of the FY 2020 GPB was not 
implemented. 
 
Further, it was noted that MARINA CO and MRO No. IV have not yet 
established a GAD sex-disaggregated data system as required under 
PCW Memorandum Circular No. 2014-05.  
 
On the other hand, objectives to promote gender equality of MARINA 
CO and MRO Nos. VI, VII, X and XII were not fully achieved because 
they were unable to fully implement their programmed activities. 
 
We recommended that Management require the concerned 
MARINA Offices to: 
 



83 
 

LRRs Observations and Recommendations 
a. comply with the PCW Guidelines to address gender issues and 

concerns arising from the unequal status of women and men 
stakeholders due to the COVID-19 situation; 
 

b. ensure that an accurate and timely sex-disaggregated data 
system will be established as required under PCW 
Memorandum Circular No. 2014-05; 

 
c. see to it that GAD planned activities are gender-responsive in 

its design, implementation and monitoring of the program 
through the application of Harmonized Gender and 
Development Guidelines (HGDG); and 

 
d. maximize the utilization of GAD funds through the full 

implementation of GAD identified programs, projects and 
activities in the GAD Plan and Budget in order to attain the 
objective of which the fund was provided and to address the 
prevailing gender issues and concerns in MARINA Offices 
and its stakeholders. 

 
MARINA CO commented that the CY 2020 GPB was not revised due 
to the re-focusing of MARINA’s measures on COVID-19 emergency 
situation at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 
Moreover, Management of MARINA CO and MRO No. XII 
commented that the unimplemented activities were due to the limited 
time and workforce of the GFPS-TWG to execute the planned 
activities, and the limitations and challenges brought about by the 
COVID-19 pandemic. 
 
Management of MRO No. IV agreed to the audit recommendations. 
The GAD Focal Person presented to the Audit Team a survey 
questionnaire as initial action in establishing gender statistics/sex 
disaggregated data and committed to exert their best efforts to establish 
GAD gender statistics/sex disaggregated data in order to properly 
address the gender concerns and gaps in the agency. 
 

Programs/Projects for Senior Citizens (SCs) and Persons with Disabilities (PWDs) 
Section 32 of the General 
Provisions of the GAA FY 2020, 
provides: “All agencies of the 
government shall formulate 
plans, programs and projects 
intended to address the concerns 
of senior citizens and persons 
with disability, insofar as it 
relates to their mandated 
functions, and integrate the same 
in their regular activities.” 
 
Section 25, Chapter VI of RA 
No. 7277 or the “Act providing 
for the Rehabilitation, Self-
Development and Self-reliance 
of Disabled Persons and their 

Of the 12 MARINA Offices, only eight (8) formulated plans, 
programs and projects were allocated with funds to address the 
concerns of Senior Citizens (SCs) and Differently-abled Persons 
and no focal persons were designated for these endeavors. 
 
Audit revealed that only the following MARINA Offices have 
integrated activities for the benefits of SCs and Differently-abled 
Persons in their regular activities, as shown below: 
 

Office/ 
Region Integrated Activities 

I & II Providing courtesy/priority lane for pregnant women, clients 
with infant/children, senior citizens and person with disability

Regional Council on Disability Affairs (RCDA) and DSWD 
ROV. 
 
Its Office has also provided appropriate signage and ramps 
which enhance the mobility, safety and welfare of differently-
abled persons who visit the office, including the designation 
of courtesy lane for PWDs, Senior Citizens and Pregnant 
Women.

Trade”, which require MARINA RO IX shall only issue 
Compliance Certificate by shipping operators on the service 
standards, which include among others, amenities and 
privileges for PWD, pregnant women, children, senior citizens 
and other similarly situated passengers. Moreover, they also 
enforced Shipping operators to implement Memorandum 
Circular No. 2017-03 re: “Omnibus Rules and Regulations on 
the Grant of Privileges for Students, persons with Disability 
(PWDs) and Senior Citizens on board Domestic Passenger 
Ships.

Ships. 
 

XI Offers Priority Lane to SCs and Differently-Abled Persons 
when they transact business with MARINA. 
 
Has successfully negotiated an elevator access for all senior 
citizens and differently abled persons. 



85 
 

LRRs Observations and Recommendations 
 
Continuously monitored the implementation by owners/ 
operators of interisland and liner vessel/ motor banca of 
MARINA Memorandum Circular Nos. 65-A, 76 and 134, 
issued for the benefit of the senior citizens and differently 
abled persons. 
 

XII Implemented programs which enhanced the mobility, safety 
and welfare of senior citizens and differently – abled persons 
such as Implementation of Priority Lanes and campaigns on 
related laws for the welfare of persons with disabilities. 
 

XIII Programs, projects and activities for the Senior Citizens and 
Differently-abled persons were integrated in the 
implementation of the agency’s regular plans, programs and 
activities especially in the conduct of mobile registrations in 
the remote areas all over CARAGA Region and related 
activities geared towards promoting awareness and 
involvement of Senior Citizens and Differently-abled persons. 
 

 
We commended the above MROs for integrating activities for the 
benefit of Senior Citizens and Differently-abled Persons in their 
regular activities. However, we recommended that Management 
of MARINA CO and other concerned MROs to: 
 
a. comply with the provisions of RA No. 7277 and Section 32 of 

RA No. 11465 through allocation of funds and formulation of 
plans, programs and projects for Senior Citizens and 
Differently-Abled Person; and 
 

b. assign focal persons to prepare and formulate plans, 
programs and projects and ensure the implementation 
thereof. 

 
The Management of MRO No. IV commented that they concur with 
the audit observation and recommendations.  They informed the Audit 
Team that the concerns, rights and privileges of Senior Citizens and 
PWDs were already incorporated and part of their mandated functions  
particularly, in the conduct of inspection of vessels as they always 
ensure that all vessels shall address the welfare and privileges of Senior 
Citizens and PWDs. 
 
MRO No. X is in the stage of reviewing the GAD plans drafted for 
CYs 2019 and 2020. 
 

Compliance with Tax Laws

The unremitted balances of all MRO were subsequently remitted 
within the prescribed period on January 2021. 
 
In MARINA CO, out of the unremitted balance of P6,605,913.41, the 
amount of P 6,439,099.77 was remitted in January 2020, leaving an 
unremitted balance of P166,813.64 which is subject for reconciliation 
of accounting records 
 
Further examination of Tax Remittance Advice (TRA) of MARINA-
CO revealed that the taxes withheld from suppliers for January 2020 
was filed and remitted on February 12, 2020 instead of February 11, 
2020 resulting in payment of penalties totaling P17,567.87. 
Verification with Accounting Division revealed that they will request 
BIR to waive the penalties paid for late filing. Late filing and 
remittance of taxes withheld has been noted in prior years.  
 
Verification also revealed that the applicable Tax Credit Certificate 
(TCC) for penalties paid in CY 2019 totaling P100,463.29 had not 
been received by Management as of audit date, therefore, was not 
applied as tax payment in CY 2020. 
 
We commended MARINA Offices that complied with the BIR 
regulations and encouraged continued timely withholding of taxes 
and remittance thereof. However, we recommended that 
Management of MARINA CO to: 
 
a. identify the accountable or responsible personnel on the 

incurrence of penalties due to late filing and remittance of 
taxes withheld and make them personally accountable thereof, 
if warranted; and 
 

b. facilitate the reconciliation of the unremitted balance and 
remit the same to BIR, if necessary. 

 
MARINA CO commented that the late filing and remittance of taxes 
withheld was due to the intermittent internet connection. It was filed 
immediately the day after through eFPS but was charged with the 



87 
 

LRRs Observations and Recommendations 
corresponding penalty for the late filing. The penalty was requested to 
be waived as per advised by BIR since no cash payment was involved 
but a Tax Remittance Advice. If BIR would not grant the request, the 
accountable employee will be held personally liable for the penalty 
charges. 
 
Moreover, as of December 31, 2020, the total amount subject for 
reconciliation was reduced by 70 percent or from P599,058.78 to 
P166,813.64. The Accounting Division of MARINA CO commits for 
continual reconciliation of the Due to BIR account with the accounting 
records despite the time limitations brought about by this pandemic. 
 

Compliance with the Government Insurance Act of 1997 
Section 14 of the IRR of RA No. 
8291 states the following: 
 
“Each government agency shall 
remit directly to the GSIS the 
employees’ and government 
agency’s contributions within 
the first Ten (10) days of the 
calendar month following the 
month to which the contributions 
apply. The remittance by the 
government agency of the 
contributions to the GSIS shall 
take priority over and above the 
payment of any and all 
obligations, except salaries and 
wages of its employees. 

 

Except for MARINA CO, MRO Nos. VII and X, all other MROs 
were compliant with Section 14 of the IRR of RA No. 8291 or the 
GSIS Act of 1997 on the remittance to GSIS of the CY 2020 
government agency’s premium contributions and payment of 
loans by its employees. 
 
In CY 2020, the hereunder MARINA Offices made total premium 
contributions and withheld deductions from salaries of their employees 
amounting to P54,281,326.47, of which the total amount of 
P53,720,751.96 was remitted to the GSIS within the prescribed period.

VII  39,703.49  This was caused by the salary increase of the 

employees and uncleared resigned employees. 
X  11,576.82  This pertains to old balance which is still in the process of verification. 
Total 192,666.41   

 
Further, in MRO No. VII, staggered remittances were made within the 
month or in the following months when taxes were withheld, thus, 
resulting in the difficulty in determining whether monthly 
contributions withheld were fully remitted. 
 
We commended MARINA Regional Offices for their efforts to 
consistently collect and remit the appropriate premium 
contributions of MARINA personnel to GSIS. Nevertheless, we 
recommended Management of MARINA CO, MRO Nos. VII and 
X to expedite the completion of the reconciliation of the 
unremitted balance and remit the same to GSIS, if necessary. We 
also recommended that Management of MARINA CO and RO VII 
remit contributions within the prescribed period. 
  
The MARINA CO Management during exit conference committed for 
the reconciliation of the remaining balance and remit the verified 
unremitted taxes based on the reconciliation undertaken and  that the 
established rules on withholding and remittance of GSIS premiums 
and loans will be strictly followed. 
 

Compliance with Property Insurance Law and COA Circular No. 2018-002 
COA Circular No. 92-390 dated 
November 17, 1992 and RA No. 
656, otherwise known as 
Property Insurance Law, as 
amended by PD No. 245, require 
all government agencies for the 
inventory of physical assets and 
to insure with General Insurance 
Fund of GSIS all its insurable 
property against any insurable 
risk and pay the corresponding 
premiums thereon. 
 

MRO Nos. VI and X were not compliant with the RA No. 656 or 
the Property Insurance Law on securing insurance for its 
insurable Property, Plant and Equipment and inventories while   
MARINA CO and MRO No. VI failed to submit to the Office of 
the Auditor the consolidated Property Insurance Form (PIF) in 
violation of Section 5.1.e of COA Circular No. 2018-002 dated May 
31, 2018. 
 
Examination of the property insurance policies of MRO Nos. VI and 
X for the CY 2020 disclosed that except for motor vehicles, all other 
properties of the agency have not been insured. 
 
In MARINA CO and MRO No. VI disclosed that the consolidated PIFs 
for all its insurable properties were not submitted on the prescribed 
period. Moreover, it was noted that MARINA’s insurable PPEs,  
except Motor Vehicles,  were not appraised, thus, the current worth of 
properties based on factors such as, area, location, improvements, and 
amenities  could not be determined. Further, non-appraisal of insurable 
PPEs precluded the validation on the accuracy of the valuation of the 
insured properties. 
 
We recommended that Management strictly review and monitor 
the insurance coverage of all its PPE to ensure that all insurable 
properties are adequately protected/covered against possible 
losses in the event of damage or loss due to fortuitous events like 
fire, earthquake, storm or other casualties. Henceforth, require 
the Property/ Supply Division to cause the appraisal of all 



89 
 

LRRs Observations and Recommendations 
insurable properties and other assets and submit PIF to the Office 
of the Auditor on or before April 30 of each year. 
 
Management of MARINA-CO acknowledged the observation and 
informed the Audit Team that corrective measures had been done by 
the Supply Section by updating, recording and registering the 
MARINA service vehicles to the Property Inventory Form in 
compliance with the COA Rules and Regulations. 
 

Compliance with the Home Development Mutual Fund Law 
Rule VII, Section 3, Paragraph 
(a) of the IRR of RA No. 9679 
states the following: 
 
“All employers shall remit to the 
Fund their contributions and the 
contributions of their covered 
employees as well as the latter’s 
loan amortizations or payments 
to the Fund, as provided for 
under Section 2 of this Rule, 
when applicable, within fifteen 
(15) days from the date the same 
were collected unless another 
period is previously agreed upon 
between the employer and the 
Fund, or within such periods as 
the Fund may prescribe 
otherwise. The Fund may 
prescribe a different remittance 
schedule for Filipinos employed 
by foreign based employers 
depending on the nature of their 
contracts or manner of their 
deployment abroad. 
 

All MARINA Offices, except CO substantially complied with the 
withholding of contributions and loan deductions from the salaries 
of MARINA officials and employees and its corresponding 
remittance to Pag-IBIG Fund. 
 
The Pag-IBIG contributions withheld amounting to P9,770,382.76 and

The unremitted balances of MRO Nos. IV, VII and XIII were 
subsequently remitted within the prescribed period on January 2021 
 
In MARINA CO, the balance of P16,412.93 is composed of P1,400.00 
unremitted balance for CY 2020 and P15,012.93 which is still for 
reconciliation by the Accounting Division with Pag-IBIG. Out of the 
P1,400.00 unremitted balance as of December 31, 2020, only P700.00 
was remitted on January 2021. 
 
We commended all MARINA Offices for complying with the 
requirements and provisions of RA No. 9679. Nevertheless, we 
recommended Management of MARINA-CO to immediately 
remit the P700.00 contributions withheld, and reconcile with Pag-
IBIG the remaining previous years’ balance of P15,012.93.   
 
Management of MARINA CO commented that the Accounting 
Division is already reconciling the amount of P15,012.93 with Pag-
IBIG. The balance refers to accumulated unremitted balance from

2016. Adjustments shall be prepared in accordance with the results of 
the reconciliation and Management committed to finish the 
reconciliation before the end of 2021. 
 

Compliance with the National Health Insurance Act of 2013 
Section 18 (a) and (b) of 
National Health Insurance Act of 
2013 states that, “The member’s 
monthly contribution shall be 
deducted and withheld 
automatically by the employer 
from the former’s salary, wage 
or earnings. The premium 
contributed shall be divided 
equally between the employer 
and the employee. The 
employee’s counterpart shall 
not, in any manner be charged to 
the employee. The monthly 
premium contribution of 
employed members shall be 
remitted by the employer on or 
before the date prescribed by the 
Corporation.” 

The payment schedule as 
required by PhilHealth depends 
on the PhilHealth Employer 
Number (PEN) of the employer. 
For those with PENs ending 0-4, 
remittance shall be made every 
11th-15th day of the month 
following the applicable period. 
While those with PEN’s ending 
5-9, remittance shall be made 
every 16th-20th day of the month 
following the applicable period.  
 

Six MROs were compliant with RA No. 10606 or the act amending 
Republic Act No. 7875 otherwise known as the “National Health 
Insurance Act of 1995” on the remittance of contributions. 
However, in MARINA CO, the lack of adequate monitoring 
control mechanisms in the remittance of PhilHealth premiums 
contributions resulted in late remittances with a consequential 
adverse effect on the incurrence of penalties amounting to 
P65,960.50 during CY 2020.

RA No. 10606. 
 
MRO No. IV unremitted balance of P32,033.61 was subsequently 
remitted on January 5, 2021. 
 
However, PhilHealth contributions of MARINA-CO has unremitted 
balance of P8,190.69 which is for further reconciliation by the 
Accounting Division.  
 
Moreover, delays in the remittances of contribution for the months of 
May and August 2020 resulted in the imposition of penalties by 
Philhealth to MARINA CO in the amount of a P65,960.50. 
 
We commended the six MROs for complying with the 
requirements and provisions of RA No. 9679. Nevertheless, we 
recommended and Management of MARINA CO agreed to: 

a. establish and institute monitoring control mechanisms in the 
recording and remittance of PhilHealth contributions to 
ensure timely remittances and to avoid the incurrence of 
penalties and consider the limited number of personnel

physically reporting to work due to the present situation of 
COVID-19 pandemic; and 
 

b. direct the Accounting Section to expedite its review and 
reconciliation of the unremitted premiums to PhilHealth and 
submit to this Audit Team the results thereof and henceforth 
remit the amount due to PhilHealth immediately, if there is 
any. 

 
Management of MARINA CO commented that PhilHealth advised 
them to attach letter-request to waive the penalty/charges. Since 
December 2020 remittance was duly received and the corresponding 
OR was issued, as well as for the January and February 2021 
remittances, the request is then deemed as approved. Also, the 
Accounting Division is exerting its best effort to expedite the 
reconciliation given the time limitation brought about by the 
pandemic.
