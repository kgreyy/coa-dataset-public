promotion and regulation of the maritime 

industry in the country. By virtue of

agreements implementing or applying the same, as well as promoting compliance with 

international maritime safety conventions or agreements. All powers and functions of the 

Professional Regulatory Commission (PRC), Commission on Higher Education (CHED), 

Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA), Department of Health (DOH) 

and National Telecommunication Commission (NTC) relative to the issuance, validation, 

verification, correction, revocation or cancellation of certificates of competency, endorsement, 

proficiency and documentary evidence required of all seafarers and all such matters pertaining to 

the implementation of the 1978 International Convention on STCW were likewise transferred to

For Maritime Industry Promotion and 

Development Program, the increase of 7.37 

percent or 1,466 in the number of operating 

merchant ship was due to the increase in the 

number of ship owners that applied and were 

granted licenses to operate in the regions prior 

to the pandemic situation in the country. 

Moreover, a total of 108 policies were issued, 

majority of which are COVID-19 related 

issuances. 

 

As regards the Maritime Industry 

Regulatory and Supervision Program, a  6,170 

percent or 383,507 increase in the number of 

seafarers certified as meeting international standards was due to the over 200,000 certificates 

expiring in 2020 which was extended taking into account that there might be Filipino seafarer/s 

who are currently serving ships engaged in the international trade and whose certificate/s shall 

expire on-board because their planned disembarkation cannot be safely completed in ports due to 

the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.

         Scope of Audit     

The audit covered the accounts and operations of MARINA for the year ended December 

31, 2020. The audit was conducted to (a) verify the level of assurance that may be placed on the 

Management’s assertions on the financial statements; (b) determine the propriety of transactions 

as well as  the extent of compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations; (c) recommend 

agency improvement opportunities; and (d) determine the extent of implementation of prior year’s 

audit recommendations. 

 

 

  
I             Independent Auditor’s Report 

 
  A qualified opinion was rendered on the fairness of presentation of the Financial 

Statements of the MARINA as at December 31, 2020 due to misstatements on four (4) accounts 

totaling to P55,986,828.60 as presented in the Independent Auditor’s Report and discussed in Part 

II – Observations and Recommendations of this Report.   

 
 

Summary of Other Significant Observations and   
Recommendations 

  

The following is a summary of other significant audit observations and corresponding 

recommendations, the details of which are discussed in Part II of this Report: 

  

1. Of the total allotments of P759.133 million received by MARINA in CY 2020, 
P723.626 million or 95.32 percent thereof was obligated leaving an unobligated 

balance of P35.507 million. Disbursement rate based on obligations was 93.46 percent 

in the amount of P676.279 million. Moreover, only 34.61 percent was obligated and 

57.09 percent was disbursed from the continuing appropriations of P13.431 million 

resulting in the reversion of P8.783 million to the unappropriated Surplus of the 

General Fund.  As a result, the expected outputs and benefits that could have been 

derived from the full utilization of the allotments were not accomplished and fully 

attained. (Observation No. 3) 

We recommended and Management agreed to consider other approaches, ways and 

strategies to ensure the full utilization of MARINA’s allotments and Notice of Cash 

Allocations (NCAs) through adequate planning and monitoring of the Agency’s 

programs and projects and the timely execution of all planned activities despite the 

challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. 

2. Lapses on internal control on cash management system of MRO Nos.  IV, VII and XI 
were noted due to non-adherence with government laws, rules and regulations on the 

D
.

F 



vi 

 

establishment and maintenance of controls over collections and deposits, and on the 

grant and utilization of Petty Cash Fund (PCF), which exposes government funds to 

possible risks of loss and misuse. (Observation No. 4) 

 

We recommended and MRO Nos. IV, VII and XI agreed to: 

 

a. deposit intact all collections with Authorized Government Depository Bank 

(AGDB) daily or not later than the next banking day to effectively strengthen the 

internal control in the collection, deposit, handling and custody of cash. If it is not 

possible due to the community quarantines and restrictions, the agency can make 

arrangement with the AGDB for online banking deposit, if available; 

 

b. comply with the Treasury Circular No. 02-2009 dated August 6, 2009 or the 

Revised Omnibus Regulations Governing Fidelity Bonding of Accountable Public 

Officers; 

 

c. reduce the amount of PCF to appropriate amount based on average monthly petty 

operating expenses; 

 

d. direct the disbursing officers to: 

 discontinue paying regular expenses out of PCF such as light and water; 

 accomplish properly the Petty Cash Vouchers (PCVs) and follow the 
procedures prescribed under Section 38, Chapter 6, Volume I of Government 

Accounting Manual for National Government Agencies (GAM for NGAs), in 

relation to the handling of PCF; 

 support the liquidation of cash advances from the PCF with complete 
documentation; 

 

e. implement other measures to address the internal control weaknesses and ensure 

that a strong internal control in the disbursement, handling and custody of cash is 

consistently maintained, as follows: 

 

 instruct the Accountable Officers (AOs) to maintain a cash book or Cash 
Receipts Register reflecting daily transactions with proper certifications; and 

 prepare and submit monthly the Report of Accountability for Accountable 
Forms in the prescribed format in accordance with Appendix No. 67, Volume 

II of GAM for NGAs.  

 

3. Funds transferred by MARINA CO to the Philippine International Trading 
Corporation (PITC) totaling P63.259 million as at December 31, 2020 remained 

outstanding in the books from over two (2) years to more than six (6) years, while in 

MRO Nos. I and II, three (3) units of Multi-Purpose Vehicle worth P3.3 million 

procured through PITC remained undelivered as at December 31, 2020, thus the 

purposes intended for the fund transfers were not attained on time. (Observation  No. 

5) 



vii 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to:       

  

a. consistently follow-up and coordinate with PITC on the required documents to be 
submitted and requirements to be complied with, to facilitate the liquidation of the 

completed projects, and the start of the procurement process of the unimplemented 

projects;  

 

b. demand for the immediate delivery of the ordered motor vehicles to be able to 
enjoy the benefits of a roadworthy vehicle for the effective implementation of its 

programs and projects; 

 

c. direct the Accounting Division to issue a confirmation letter to the AGDB where 
the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) account was opened to establish the 

interest earned of the funds transferred and record the same as receivable; and 

 

d. refrain from availing of the services of PITC and entering MOA with conditions 
which are disadvantageous to the Agency. 

4. MARINA CO and MRO Nos. I, II, V and XIII did not faithfully adhere to laws, rules 
and regulations on government procurement prescribed under Republic Act No. 9184 

and its Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (RIRR), hence, casting doubts 

on the integrity and reliability of the procurement processes and/or reasonableness of 

cost of the awarded contracts. (Observation No. 6) 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require all those concerned to observe 

strict compliance with the applicable provisions of the RIRR of RA No. 9184 and of 

other rules and regulations on government procurement. Also, for MARINA CO to 

impose the liquidated damages on the defaulting contractors in accordance with 

Section 8.1 of Annex “D” of the RIRR of RA No. 9184. 

 

5. One (1) bank account maintained by MRO No. VII with an outstanding balance of 
P86,497.15 was not closed despite being inactive for more than five (5) years contrary 

to the COA Circular 2015-001 dated January 29, 2015 and DOF-DBM-COA Joint 

Circular No. 4-2012 dated September 11, 2012. (Observation No. 7)  

 

We recommended and Management of MRO No. VII agreed to cause the closure of 

the identified dormant bank account, remit the unexpended balance to the Bureau of 

the Treasury following the prescribed procedures under COA Circular No. 2015-001, 

and furnish the Audit Team of the documentations thereof. 

6. Accounting and budgetary reports with their supporting documents were not submitted 
to the MROs audit teams within the prescribed period which prevented the timely 

conduct of audit and evaluation of financial accounts and transactions. (Observation 

No. 8) 



viii 

 

We recommended and the Management in MROs agreed to comply with the prescribed 

periods of submission of financial and budgetary reports, complete with relevant 

supporting documents required under the provisions of the GAM for NGAs and other 

related issuances on financial reporting, for the timely conduct of audit and evaluation 

of financial accounts and transactions.    

 

The above observations and recommendations were discussed with concerned 

Management officials in an exit conference conducted on April 13, 2020, and their comments were 

incorporated in this report, where appropriate. 

  

   

 
               Summary of Total Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges 

  

The unsettled suspensions, disallowances and charges as at December 31, 2020 for the 

MARINA Offices amounted to P3.444 million, P44.057 million, and P0.348 million, respectively. 

The total disallowances included the outstanding disallowances issued prior to the effectivity of 

Rules and Regulations on Settlement of Accounts (RRSA). 

  

 

 
              Status of Implementation of Prior Year’s Audit Recommendations
