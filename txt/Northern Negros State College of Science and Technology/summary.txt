EXECUTIVE SUMMARY





A)	Introduction



 The Northern Negros State College of Science and Technology (NONESCOST) started as Old Sagay Barangay High School (OSBHS) in 1970.  In 1978, the Iloilo State College of Fisheries (ISCOF) in Barotac Nuevo, Iloilo, forged an agreement with Mayor Alfredo G. Marañon, Jr. of the Municipality of Sagay, Negros Occidental, transforming OSBHS into an extension campus of ISCOF.  The ISCOF provided seven teachers to reinforce the teaching staff of the High School.  The school was then converted into Sagay Municipal High School.



On March 3, 1983 by virtue of Batas Pambansa No. 359, the Sagay Municipal High School was converted into ISCOF, Sagay Branch.



Republic Act (RA) No. 8448 dated January 9, 1998, converted the ISCOF, Sagay Branch, into the NONESCOST.  The State College primarily provides higher technological, professional and vocational instruction and training in science, agricultural and industrial fields, as well as short-term technical or vocational courses.  It likewise promotes research, advance studies and progressive leadership in its areas of specialization.



The governance and administration of the College is vested in and exercised by its Board of Trustees under RA No. 8292 or the Higher Education Modernization Act of 1997.



NONESCOST is administered by President Dr. Renato A. Egcas and assisted by the Vice President for Academic Affairs and Vice President for Administration.

D)	Scope of Audit



The audit covered the accounts and operations of Northern Negros State College of Science and Technology for the year-ended December 31, 2020. The audit was conducted to: (a) verify the level of assurance that may be placed on management’s assertions on the financial statements; (b) recommend agency improvement opportunities; and (c) determine the extent of implementations of prior year’s audit recommendations.





E)	Independent Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements



The Auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the financial statements of NONESCOST for the year ended December 31, 2020 due to exception as stated in the Independent Auditor’s Report and as discussed in Part II of this Annual Audit Report.





F)	Summary of Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations



The following are the significant observations with the corresponding recommendations:



1)		Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) collections amounting to ₱123,384,352.68 and ₱123,326,054.00 were erroneously recorded and belatedly receipted, respectively, contrary to Section 68 of Presidential Decree No. 1445, thus affecting the fairness of presentation of the financial statements at year-end.

	

We recommended and Management, thru the College President, agreed to require the Cashier to regularly monitor the collections in the RTGS and LBP Link.BizPortal so that the Official Receipts can be issued on a timely basis and report these in the RCD properly. He should also direct the Accountant to, henceforth, record the RTGS collections by debiting Cash in Bank and crediting the appropriate Income/ Grants and Donation accounts.

	

	

2)		Receivables from students’ tuition fees totaling P7,517,460.58 were not recorded in the books of the College contrary to COA Circular Letter No. 2004-002, resulting to understatement of the Accounts Receivables and Other Deferred Credits accounts, thus affecting the fairness of presentation of the financial statements at year-end.



We recommended and Management, thru the College President, agreed to require the Accountant to record the accounts receivable and income from tuition fees in accordance with COA Circular Letter No. 2004-002 dated September 30, 2004 to ensure fair presentation of the said accounts in the financial statements. 

	

3)		The outstanding balance of the Student Assistance Fund for Education (SAFE) loan program amounting to P1,484,000.00 has remained uncollected at year-end because the College was not able to strictly monitor the repayments of the student-borrowers contrary to CHED Memorandum Circular No. 25 series of 2008 dated June 3, 2008 nor did it provide as Allowance for Impairment contrary to Section 10, Chapter 7 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies, Volume I, thus these accounts are not fairly presented at year-end.

	

We recommended and Management, thru the College President, agreed to instruct the College Accountant and the Director of Student Affairs and Services (SAS) to verify the outstanding balance of the SAFE loans receivable and to send demand letters to the student-borrowers to repay their SAFE loan outstanding balance.  Henceforth, the Campus Accountant and SAS Director should maintain permanent records on scholarship and loan programs and strictly monitor the same in accordance with established guidelines and provide Allowance for Impairment pursuant to the instructions in the GAM for NGAs, Volume I.

	

The above findings as well as other observations were earlier communicated through Audit Observations Memoranda (AOMs).  Management comments were incorporated in this report, where appropriate.





G)	Status of Settlement of Accounts



Unsettled audit disallowances and suspensions as of December 31, 2020 amounted to ₱4,219,321.24 and P1,898,713.02, respectively.   There was no audit charges issued during the year.















H)	Status of Implementation of Prior Year’s Recommendations



Out of 17 prior years’ audit recommendations, five were fully implemented, nine were partially implemented and three were not implemented.



The details of the status of implementation of prior year’s audit recommendations are presented in Part III of this report.
