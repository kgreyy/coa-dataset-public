C. Scope of Audit 
 

The audit covered the financial and compliance audits of the accounts and 

operations of the CWC for the year ended December 31, 2020. The audit was conducted 

to: (a) verify the level of assurance that may be placed on Management’s assertions on 

the financial statements; (b) recommend agency’s improvement opportunities; and (c) 

determine the propriety of transactions as well as the extent of compliance with pertinent 

laws, rules and regulations; and (d) determine the extent of implementation of prior 

years’ audit recommendations. 

 

D. Independent Auditor’s Report  
 

A qualified opinion was rendered on the financial statements of the CWC as at 

December 31, 2020 for the misstatements of PPE accounts by P1,375,658.43 or 1.19 

percent of its total Assets, while Net Assets/Equity account was misstated by 

P7,065,392.63 or 6.55 percent of the total Equity resulting in the over/understatement of 

the affected accounts, and for the accounting deficiencies that affected the reliability and 



iii 

 

accuracy of the balances of the account in the Financial Statements as at December 31, 

2020 totaling P77,976,760.34 or 67.66 percent of its total Assets. 

 

E. Summary of Other Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations 
 

The other significant observations and corresponding recommendations discussed 

in Part II of this report, are as follows: 

 

1. Delayed in the submission of DVs for the month of December 2020, ranging from 95 
to 126 days, is contrary to existing rules and regulations, that precluded the Audit 

Team from conducting timely review, analysis and verification of the accounts for 

relevant audit results. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Accountant to: 
 

a) submit immediately the DVs and its supporting documents for the month of 
December 2020; and 

 

b) exert more effort to religiously comply with the pertinent rules and 
regulations on the timely submission of the said report and transaction 

documents including all supporting documents within the prescribed period 

as stated in Section 6.05 of COA Circular No. 95-006 dated 18 May 1995 and 

Section 7.1.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009. 

 

2. Non-submission of the Purchase Order (PO)/Contract of Agreement and its 
supporting documents as advance copies within the prescribed period, precluded the 

Audit Team to conduct a timely review and evaluation as to the validity of the 

transaction/contract and in contrary to COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 

12, 2009 and Republic Act (RA) 9184. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the BAC Secretariat to 

strictly comply with the pertinent rules and regulations on the timely submission 

of the PO and Contract of Agreement, including all supporting documents 

within the prescribed period as stated in the COA Circular 2009-001. 

 

3. Non-submission of the Official Receipt (OR) as proof of renewal in lieu of the 
expired Mayor’s Permit submitted by the Illumin8 Ventures Holding, Inc. as provided 

in paragraph 4.0 of GPPB Circular 01-2015 dated January 30, 2015, casts doubt on 

the legal existence of the contractor. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the BAC to submit 

immediately the renewed Mayor’s Permit of the consultant as required in 

Paragraph 4.0 of Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB) Circular No. 

01-2015 dated 30 January 2015. 

 



iv 

 

4. Delayed submission of Liquidation Report with supporting documents by the Special 
Disbursing Officer (SDO) to the Accounting Office and thereafter to COA Office, 

precluded the Accountant from the timely recording and reporting of the liquidation 

and prevented the Auditor the timely review and evaluation thereof.  Likewise, no 

refund was made for the unspent balance of the cash advance. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the: 

 

a) Special Disbursing Officer to submit the liquidation report and its 
supporting documents within one (1) month after the purpose of the cash 

advance has been accomplished; and 

 

b) Accountant to submit to the COA office the liquidation report and its 
supporting documents within ten (10) days after his/her receipt thereof from 

the SDO. 
 

The above observations and recommendations were discussed with the concerned 

officials of the agency through the Summary of Audit Observations and 

Recommendations (SAOR), transmitted on May 14, 2021, in lieu of exit conference. 

Management’s views and comments were considered in the report, where appropriate.
