PART II – OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

 
Financial Audit 

 

Accounting Errors/Omissions 

 

1. Various accounts of the Council for the Welfare of Children (CWC) under the 
Assets and Net Assets/Equity were misstated by P1.376 million and P7.065 million, 

which represented 1.19 percent and 6.55 percent of its total Assets and Net 

Assets/Equity, respectively. Likewise, various accounting errors/deficiencies 

amounting to P77.977 million or 67.66 percent of its total Assets were also noted. Due 

to the significant impact of the misstatements and deficiencies on the balances of the 

affected accounts, the accuracy of the balances, completeness and existence of the said 

accounts could not be relied upon. 
 

2. Section 111 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 requires that the accounts of an 
agency shall be kept in such detail as necessary to meet the needs of the agency and at the 

same time be adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or control agencies of 

the government. It further states that the highest standards of honesty, objectivity and 

consistency shall be observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate or 

misleading information. 

 

3. Paragraph 27 of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) 1 
and Section 15, Chapter 2 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National 

Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I provides that “the financial statements shall 

present fairly the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of an entity. 

Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other 

events and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, 

liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in IPSAS. The application of IPSAS, with 

additional disclosures when necessary, is presented to result financial statements that 

achieve a fair presentation.” 

 

4. Volume III of the GAM for NGAs provides the Revised Chart of Accounts (RCA) 
to be used by NGAs in recording transactions.   

 

5. Verification of the Disbursement Vouchers (DVs), Journal Entry Vouchers (JEV), 
General Ledgers (GLs), Subsidiary Ledgers (SLs), Purchase Orders (POs), and Inventory 

and Property Records disclosed accounting errors/omissions; thereby, affecting the 

accuracy and reliability of the account balances as shown in Table 1.

1. Unrecorded Transactions 

 

a) Non-recognition of Impairment Loss 
 

6. Section 40, Chapter 10 of the GAM, Volume I provides policies, among others, on 
unserviceable PPE, to wit: 

 

c. A PPE is said to be unserviceable if it is no longer capable of providing the 
entity with future economic benefits or service potential. 

 

d. All unserviceable property shall be reported in the Inventory and Inspection 
Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) (Appendix 74). PPE reported in 

the IIRUP shall be dropped from the books by debiting Impairment Loss – 

Property, Plant and Equipment (cost of the PPE less Accumulated 

Depreciation). 

 

7. Review of the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment 
(RPCPPE) disclosed that various unserviceable PPE items with total carrying amount of 

P1,057,601.49 were not dropped from the books due to the non-submission of the IIRUP 



29 

 

by the Property Officer as basis in drawing JEVs pursuant to Section 40, Chapter 10 of the 

GAM, Volume I, the details of which are shown in Table 2:

Total  8,305,272.85  7,247,671.36  1,057,601.49 

 

8. The non-submission of the IIRUP by the Property Officer caused the non-
recognition of impairment loss, thus, overstating the PPE accounts and understating 

Impairment Loss account by P1,057,601.49.  

 

9. Further, the unserviceable PPE items may result in their further deterioration and 
deprive the Agency of a higher return if these properties are not immediately disposed 

through sale or negotiation. Moreover, spaces occupied by these unserviceable PPE items 

which remained idle in the storeroom was not maximized. 

 

10. This is a reiteration of previous years’ audit observations, of which the same has 
persisted in the current year due to the non-compliance with the prior year’s 

recommendation. 

 

11. We reiterated our previous year’s recommendation and Management agreed 
to require the Property Officer to prepare and submit the IIRUP to the Accounting 

Unit as basis for the recognition of Impairment Loss-PPE, pursuant to Section 40, 

Chapter 10 of the GAM, Volume I. 
 

b) Non-recognition of depreciation expense for December 2020 
 

12. Section 2, Chapter 9 of the GAM, Volume I defines depreciation as a systematic 
allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life. 

 

13. Section 27, Chapter 10 of the GAM, Volume I provides that depreciation of an asset 
begins when it is available for use such as when it is in the location and condition necessary 

for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by Management. For simplicity 

and to avoid proportionate computation, depreciation shall be for one month if the PPE is 

available for use on or before the 15th of the month. However, if the PPE is available for 

use after the 15th of the month, depreciation shall be for the succeeding month. 

 

14. Review of the Accumulated Depreciation accounts of the PPE items disclosed that 
the Accountant failed to recognize the depreciation expense on PPE for the month of 



30 

 

December 2020 amounting to P112,469.48 based on the estimates used by the Accountant. 

The details are as follows:

Total  15,554,820.06 15,442,350.58  112,469.48 

 

15. The non-recording of the depreciation expense for the month of December 2020 
resulted in the overstatement of the PPE accounts and the understatement of the 

Depreciation Expense accounts by P112,469.48. 

 

16. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accounting Unit to 
draw a JEV to record the depreciation expense for the month of December 2020. 

 

c) Non-derecognition of lost and/or missing PPE 
 

17. Section 41, Chapter 10 of the GAM , Volume I provides the accounting policies on 
the loss of property, among others, as follows: 

 

a. When a loss of government funds or property occurs while they are in transit or 
the loss is caused by fire, theft, or other casualty or force majeure, the officer 

accountable therefor or having custody thereof shall immediately notify the 

Commission or the auditor concerned and, within thirty days or such longer 

period as the Commission or auditor may in the particular case allow, shall 

present his application for relief, with the available supporting evidence. 

Whenever warranted by the evidence, credit for the loss shall be allowed. An 

officer who fails to comply with this requirement shall not be relieved of 

liability or allowed credit for any loss in the settlement of his accounts.  

 

b. Lost property and the related accumulated depreciation and impairment loss 
shall be derecognized in the books upon receipt of the Report of Lost, Stolen, 

Damaged, Destroyed Property (RLSDDP) (Appendix 75) supported by a Notice 

of Loss prepared and submitted by the Accountable Officer. The loss shall be 

charged to account “Loss of Assets” at an amount equal to its carrying amount. 

 

c. The accountability of the accountable officer over the loss of depreciable asset 
shall be based on depreciated replacement cost (DRC). DRC is replacement cost 

less accumulated depreciation calculated on the basis of replacement cost. 

 

18. Review of the RPCPPE revealed that there are items that were marked as 
“unlocated” totaling P1,999,120.00. The details were as follows:

Total  1,999,120.00 1,793,532.54  205,587.46 

 

19. There were no Report of Lost, Stolen, Damaged, Destroyed Property (RLSDDP) 
and Notice of Loss prepared and submitted by the Accountable Officer/s, pursuant to 

Section 41, Chapter 10 of the GAM, Volume I. 

 

20. Failure of Management to establish and report the lost equipment, after the conduct 
of the physical count and the preparation of the RPCPPE, affected the accuracy and the 

reliability of the balance of the PPE accounts. 

 

21. This is a reiteration of previous years’ audit observations, of which the same has 
persisted in the current year due to the non-compliance with the prior year’s 

recommendation. 

 

22. We reiterated our previous year’s recommendation and Management agreed 
to require: 
 

a. The Accountable Officer/s to prepare the RLSDDP supported with the 
Notice/s of Loss in compliance with Section 41, Chapter 10 of the GAM, 

Volume I; 

 

b. The Accounting Unit to derecognize lost property on the basis of the 
RLSDDP and set up accountability of the Accountable Officer/s; and 

 

c. The concerned officers to strictly abide by the pertinent provisions in the 
GAM pertaining to the procedures of reporting the loss of property. 

 

23. Management commented that they had issued a Special Order reconstituting the 
CWC-Property Disposal and Awards Committee. The Committee will be responsible for 

the proper disposal of all unserviceable property and equipment of the agency. 

 

2. Erroneous recording of transaction 
 

a) Erroneous recording of various expenses under Office Supplies Expense account 
 

24. Volume III of the GAM provides the description of the Office Supplies Expense 
account, as an account used to recognize the cost or value of office supplies such as bond 



32 

 

paper, ink, and small tangible items like staple wire remover, puncher, stapler and other 

similar items issued to end-users for government operations. 

 

25. Audit of the Office Supplies Expense account with a balance of P3,687,648.85 as at 
December 31, 2020 revealed that various expenses totaling P2,844,867.10 were classified 

as Office Supplies Expense but these were not related to office supplies.  These items were 

issued to the end-users upon delivery. The details were as follows:

Materials Expenses 

- 

MDS Check 2,400.00 Bank Charges - 

Total  2,844,867.10   

 

26. In effect, the balance of the Office Supplies Expense account was misleading and 
unreliable, as the items listed above do not pertain to office supplies or for office use as 

described under the GAM Volume III, thus, not in accordance with Section 7, Chapter 19 

of the GAM, Volume I on the fair presentation and compliance of the financial statements 

with the IPSAS, to wit:  

 

Financial statements shall present fairly the financial position, financial 

performance and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful 



33 

 

representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in 

accordance with the definition and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, 

revenue, and expenses set out in PPSASs. The application of PPSASs, with 

additional disclosures when necessary, is presumed to result in financial statements 

that achieve a fair presentation.  

 

27. Further verification showed that semi-expendable properties such as furniture and 
printer that were recorded as an outright expense, were issued to end-users without the 

Inventory Custodian Slip (ICS), thus, accountability was not secured in violation of Section 

11, Chapter 8 of the GAM, Volume I which entails accountability over semi-expendable 

property, to wit: Inventory Custodian Slip (ICS) (Appendix 59) shall be issued to end-user 

of Semi-expendable Property to establish accountability over them. Accountability shall be 

extinguished upon return of the item to the Property and Supply Division/Unit or in case 

of loss, upon approval of the relief from property accountability. 

 

28. We recommended and Management agreed to require:  
 

a. The Accountant to record future expenses in accordance with their 
classification based on either the nature of expenses or their function 

within the entity, whichever provides information that is reliable and more 

relevant and as provided in GAM, Volume III; and  

 

b. The Property Officer to issue ICS to secure accountability over the 
issuances of semi-expendable properties as prescribed under Section 11, 

Chapter 8 of the GAM, Volume I. 

 

Accounting Deficiencies 

 

29. Various accounting deficiencies totaling P77,976,760.34 were also noted in 
recording the transactions of various accounts that have impact on the fairness of the 

presentation of the balances of the accounts in the FSs as discussed in Table 6.

25. Non-compliance by Management with the pertinent provisions affected the 
accuracy and reliability of the respective balances of accounts as at December 31, 2020, as 

stated in Table 6. 

 

26. In summary, due to the significant impact on the financial statements of the total 
misstatements of P1,375,658.43 and P7,065,392.63 which represent 1.19 percent and 6.55 

percent of its total assets and equity, respectively, and with total deficiencies of 

P77,976,760.34 or 67.66 percent of its total assets, we rendered a Qualified Opinion on the 

financial statements of the CWC as at year-end. 

 

Compliance Audit 

 

Delayed submission of accounting reports 

 

27. Delays in the submission of DVs for the month of December 2020, ranging 
from 95 to 126 days, is contrary to existing rules and regulations, that precluded the 

Audit Team from conducting timely review, analysis and verification of the accounts 

for relevant audit results. 

 

28. Section 7.1.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009 provides 
that: “the head of the agency, who is primarily responsible for all government funds and 

property pertaining to his agency, shall ensure that: a) the required financial and other 

reports and statements are submitted by the concerned agency officials in such form and 

within the period prescribed by the Commission; xxx; d) appropriate actions are taken on 

the deficiencies noted as contained in the AOM.” 

 

29. Paragraph 6.05 of COA Circular No. 95-006 dated May 18, 1995, provides that 
“the official involved in the recording of transactions in the books of accounts shall turn 

over the receipts and disbursements records with all paid vouchers and documents 

evidencing the transaction to the Auditor within ten (10) days from date of receipt of said 

documents”. 

 

30. Verification from the status report of received documents, as of April 15, 2021, 
showed that the DVs and its supporting documents for December 2020 were not yet 

submitted by the concerned officials/employees of the agency to the COA office.

dated September 15,

95 to 126 days 

 

31. The Accountant explained that the delay in the timely submission of the reports and 
transaction documents was attributed mainly to the suspension of work during lockdowns 



37 

 

and the implementation of the Alternative Work Arrangement (AWA) due to the COVID-

19 pandemic protocol wherein limited personnel are allowed to report in the office. 

Likewise, it takes time for them to complete the signing of DVs by the signatories and the 

supplier to pick up/get the checks and issue the Official Receipts needed as supporting 

documents for the transactions. 

 

32. Management’s non-compliance with the timely submission to the Audit Team of 
the Disbursement Vouchers and its supporting documents prevented the conduct of a 

timely evaluation on the validity of the transactions and the propriety of accounting entries 

made. The said transactions and their corresponding accounting treatment, if found 

improper, may affect the fair presentation of the financial statements.  

 

33. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to: 
 

a. submit immediately the DVs and its supporting documents for the month 
of December 2020; and 

 

b. exert more effort to religiously comply with the pertinent rules and 
regulations on the timely submission of the said report and transaction 

documents including all supporting documents within the prescribed 

period as stated in Section 6.05 of COA Circular No. 95-006 dated 18 May 

1995 and Section 7.1.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 

2009. 

 

Non-submission of Purchase Order 

 

34. Non-submission of the Purchase Order (PO)/Contract of Agreement and its 
supporting documents as advance copies within the prescribed period, precluded the 

Audit Team from conducting a timely review and evaluation as to the validity of the 

transaction/contract, and contrary to COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 

2009 and Republic Act (RA) 9184. 

 

35. COA Circular No. 2009-001 states the following: 
 

Paragraph 3.2.1 “A copy of any purchase order irrespective of amount, and each 

and every supporting document, shall, within five (5) working days from issuance 

thereof, be submitted to the Auditor concerned. Within the same period, the Auditor 

shall review and point out to management defects and/or deficiencies, if any, in the 

same manner provided in the second and third sentences of item 3.1.4 hereof.” 

 

Paragraph 3.1.1, “Within five (5) working days from the execution of a contract by 

the government or any of its subdivisions, agencies or instrumentalities, including 

government-owned and controlled corporations and their subsidiaries, a copy of 

said contract and each of all the documents forming part thereof by reference or 

incorporation shall be furnished to the Auditor of the agency concerned. In case of 

agencies audited on an engagement basis, submission of a copy of the contract and 

its supporting documents shall be to the Auditor of the mother agency or parent 

company, as the case may be.”

36. On January 28, 2020, the CWC entered into a Contract of Agreement (CA) with 
Illumin8 Ventures Holding, Inc. for the Consultancy Services for CWC’s Email Service 

Provider (Mailbox Provider) for the period January to December 31, 2020, in the amount 

of P430,000.00 representing 100% payment upon delivery of the deliverables to CWC and 

as stipulated in the contract, to wit:  

 

Paragraph III - Deliverables  

 

“The Illumin8 Ventures Holding, Inc must provide an Email Service (Mailbox) 

hosting and account.” 

 

 Paragraph V – Schedule of Payment 

  

“Payment processing for Email Service Subscription will be one time and will be 

paid once the 60 User Email Accounts are issued and migrated.” 

 

37. Verification of the documents and interviews with the Bids and Awards Committee 
(BAC) and the End-User revealed that the Consultancy Service was procured through 

Negotiated Procurement - Small Value Procurement (NP-SVP), after postings to the 

PhilGEPS were made and only one (1) supplier showed interest to join the bidding. 

 

38. Scrutiny of the transaction, however, revealed that the Agency failed to comply 
with the procedures and documentary requirements mentioned in the above-cited 

provisions from the time the PO was prepared, to the time of evaluation of the Bidder’s 

eligibility and perfection of the contract. Management commented that the non-submission 

was due to the ongoing repair, re-cabling and intermittent work from home schedule due 

to the pandemic. The advance copy of the PO is required to be submitted to the Audit Team 

as provided under COA Circular No. 2009-001, in order to correct any deficiency noted 

before further processing of the transaction is completed. 

 

39. The failure of Management to submit the perfected PO/Contract and the complete 
supporting documents within the reglementary period as prescribed in the above-cited 

provisions precluded the Audit Team from conducting the timely review and evaluation as 

to the validity of the transaction and the propriety of accounting entries made.  

 

40. We recommended and Management agreed to require the BAC Secretariat to 
strictly comply with the pertinent rules and regulations on the timely submission of 

the PO and Contract of Agreement, including all supporting documents, within the 

prescribed period as stated in COA Circular No. 2009-001. 
 

Non-submission of Official Receipt  

 

41. Non-submission of the Official Receipt (OR) as proof of renewal in lieu of the 
expired Mayor’s Permit submitted by the Illumin8 Ventures Holding, Inc. as 

provided in paragraph 4.0 of GPPB Circular No. 01-2015 dated January 30, 2015, 

casts doubt on the legal existence of the contractor. 



39 

 

42. Paragraph 4.0 of Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB) Circular No. 01-
2015 dated January 30, 2015, states that “To enhance competition and facilitate the 

procurement process, all government agencies are hereby mandated to allow and accept 

the submission of the bidder’s recently expired Mayor’s Permit and the Official Receipt as 

proof that the bidder has applied and paid for the renewal of the permit within the 

prescribed period; Provided that, the current and valid Mayor’s Permit, as renewed, will 

be submitted or presented by the bidder with the Lowest Calculated and Responsive Bid or 

Highest Rated and Responsive Bid as a condition to the award of contract.” 

 

43. Review of DV No. 2020-01 dated January 30, 2020, and its supporting documents 
revealed that the Mayor’s Permit (Business Permit) as attached to the DV has expired on 

December 31, 2019, before the contract was awarded on January 10, 2020, to Illumin8 

Ventures Holding, Inc. Likewise, the said consultant did not submit a copy of the OR as 

proof that it has applied and paid for the renewal of his permit. 

 

44. The non-submission of the renewed Mayor’s Permit (Business Permit) resulted in 
the non-compliance with legal eligibility requirement of the contractor, as provided in 

GPPB Circular No. 01-2015, which casts doubts on the legal existence of the contractor. 

 

45. We recommended and Management agreed to require the BAC to submit 
immediately the renewed Mayor’s Permit of the consultant as required in Paragraph 

4.0 of Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB) Circular No. 01-2015 dated 

January 30, 2015. 

 

Delayed submission of Liquidation Report 

 

46. Delayed submission of Liquidation Report with supporting documents by the 
Special Disbursing Officer (SDO) to the Accounting Office and thereafter, to the COA 

Office, precluded the Accountant from the timely recording and reporting of the 

liquidation and prevented the Auditor from the timely review and evaluation thereof.  

Likewise, no refund was made for the unspent balance of the cash advance. 

 

47. Section 101, PD 1445 states that, “Every officer of any government agency whose 
duties permit or require the possession or custody of government funds or property shall 

be accountable therefor and for the safekeeping thereof in conformity with law. “ 

 

48. Paragraph 4.1.3 (iii) of COA Circular No. 2009-002, dated May 18, 2009, provides 
that “A cash advance shall be liquidated/reported on as soon as the purpose for which it 

was granted has been served.” 

  

49. Paragraph 4.1.3 (ix) of the same Circular provides that, “Cash advance for special 
time-bound undertaking shall be liquidated by the accountable officer concerned within 

one month from the date the purpose of the cash advance was accomplished.” 

 

50. Paragraph 5.3 of COA Circular 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 provides that 
“Within ten (10) days after receipt of the report and supporting documents from the AO, 



40 

 

the Accountant shall verify the report, record it in the books and submit the same with all 

the vouchers/payrolls and supporting documents to the Auditor. The cash advance shall be 

considered liquidated upon the recording thereof by the Accountant in the books of 

accounts although not yet audited by the COA auditor. 

 

51. The SDO was granted a cash advance in the amount of P198,000.00 on October 23, 
2019, for the conduct of National Children’s Month (NCM) activities for the period 

October 28 to November 28, 2019. However, the liquidation report was submitted to the 

Accounting Office only on October 15, 2020, which should have been submitted within 

the period from November 28 to December 27, 2019, that is eight (8) months and eighteen 

(18) days delay, contrary to the reglementary period of one (1) month after the activities 

were accomplished.  Details are as shown in Table 8 below:

52. The Accountant issued demand letters on June 3, 2020 and September 14, 2020, 
that compelled the SDO to submit the said Liquidation Report with its supporting 

documents on September 15, 2020, to the Accountant and thereafter, submitted the same 

to the COA Office on September 28, 2020. 

 

53. As a result of the delayed submission of the liquidation report, the related expenses 
were not recorded and recognized in the period that they were incurred, thus, not in keeping 

with Paragraph 4.1.3 (iii & ix) of COA Circular No. 2009-002. Likewise, there was still a 

remaining unliquidated balance of P39,080.00 as shown in the Statement of Accountability 

and Reconciliation of Statement of Accountability. 

 

54. Based on the report submitted, we observed that there was an unliquidated balance 
of P39,080.00 which prompted us to issue a demand letter to the SDO on September 29, 

2020. Moreover, reply to the demand letter was received on November 5, 2020, seven (7) 

days elapsed from the day the demand letter was issued.  

 

55. The SDO explained that she was able to submit the Report of Disbursement on 
December 9, 2019 to the Administrative and Finance Division (AFD), through the 

authorized Administrative Staff of Public Affairs and Information Office (PAIO) who was 

specifically tasked to prepare the necessary administrative documents and do the 

submission to the AFD. The said documents were received by the Accountant on January 

6, 2020, but returned them to the office concerned due to some deficiencies and lacking 

documents. The SDO was not informed about it for she was already on leave of absence 

from January 3 to March 9, 2020, for personal and humanitarian reasons. She was unable 

to know about it until the time she received the first demand letter from the Accountant.  

 



41 

 

56. On the other hand, the unliquidated balance of P39,080.00 was due to the three (3) 
original ORs that were lost by the said Administrative staff who was in charge of collating 

the documents included in the liquidation report while the SDO was on leave of absence. 

The Administrative staff, however, resigned from work before the SDO reported back for 

work. After his resignation, nobody was tasked to do the work left by him while the SDO 

was still on leave. The details of the original ORs that were lost are shown in Table 9. The 

amount of the expenses totaled P41,750.00, where the balance of P2,670.00 was shouldered 

by the SDO.

57. Likewise, she stated in her reply to the demand letter that if she had been informed 
promptly, she would have had the opportunity to secure these documents from their file, 

and/or obtained copies from the suppliers, before the Accountant submitted to the 

concerned government office for their own compliance, or maybe obtained copies of these 

important documents before the constraints of the COVID-19 protocols have made it 

impossible to scout through voluminous documents which have now been inaccessible. 

 

58. For now, the SDO is securing certification from the suppliers of the actual purchase 
of the items and requesting authentication of the photocopy of the receipts wherein she 

assured in her letter that the process would be completed by second week of November, 

2020.  

 

59. Section 101, PD 1445 states that “Every officer of any government agency whose 
duties permit or require the possession or custody of government funds or property shall 

be accountable therefor and for the safekeeping thereof in conformity with law.” 

Therefore, the SDO is the one accountable for the cash advance granted to her and it is her 

responsibility to be aware of the standards that pertain to the handling of the cash advance.  

 

60. Furthermore, review of the documents disclosed that since the SDO submitted the 
liquidation report and its supporting documents to the Accounting Office on September 15, 

2020 which has already been delayed for almost nine (9) months, as shown in Table 8, in 

effect, also already delayed in the submission of the same to the COA office on September 

28, 2020, i.e., 8 months and eight (8) days delayed, in violation of Paragraph 5.3 of COA 

Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997. The failure on the part of the SDO to 

liquidate the said cash advance on time affected the timely recording and reporting of the 



42 

 

Accountant in the books of accounts and precluded the Auditor from the conduct of timely 

review/evaluation of the same. 

 

61. We recommended and Management agreed to require: 
 

a. The Special Disbursing Officer to submit the liquidation report and its 
supporting documents within one (1) month after the purpose of the cash 

advance has been accomplished; and 

 

b. The Accountant to submit to the COA office the liquidation report and its 
supporting documents within ten (10) days after his/her receipt thereof 

from the SDO. 

 

Other Compliance Issues 

 

Gender and Development (GAD) 

 

62. The CWC failed to achieve the following Gender and Development (GAD) 
initiatives, to wit: (a) non-preparation of agency’s GAD Plan and Budget (GPB), 

hence, non-submission thereof to the Philippine Commission on Women (PCW), 

contrary to Section 4.4 of the DBM/NEDA/NCFRW Joint Circular No. 2004 and 

Section 7.0 of PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01; and (b) no GAD activity 

as provided under Section 31 of the General Provisions of the GAA for FY 2020 was 

identified in the Accomplishment Report submitted and no amount from the agency’s 

appropriations was utilized for GAD-related activities. 

 

a) Non-preparation of Agency’s GAD Plan and Budget (GPB), hence, non-submission 
thereof to the Philippine Commission on Women (PCW) due to the unawareness of the 

procedures to be undertaken as provided in Section 4.4 of the DBM/NEDA/NCFRW 

Joint Circular No. 2004 and Section 7.0 of PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-

01. 

 

63. Section 4.4 of Department of Budget and Management (DBM)/National Economic 
and Development Authority (NEDA)/National Commission on the Role of Filipino 

Women (NCFRW) Joint Circular No. 2004-1 requires that “GAD planning and budgeting 

shall be observed annually and incorporated in all programs and budget exercises of 

agencies. The GAD activities in the plan and budget must be included in the agency budget 

proposal in accordance with the budget call. Agencies shall ensure that the cost of 

implementing the GAD activities is part of their approved budget. At least five percent (5%) 

of the total agency budget appropriations as authorized under the annual General 

Appropriations Act shall correspond to activities supporting GAD. Agency heads shall be 

responsible for ensuring that GAD activities are provided with adequate resources.” 

 

64. Section 7.0 of PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01 - SCHEDULE TO 
BE OBSERVED IN GAD PLANNING AND BUDGETING  

 



43 

 

i. September (2 years before budget year)-PCW issues notification letters to 
all line departments or central offices for the submission of their annual 

GPB and GAD ARs to PCW. (Note: GPB for the following year must be 

accompanied by the GAD AR of the preceding year)  

 

ii. September-October - Line departments or central offices issue notification 
letters to all their attached agencies, bureaus and regional offices for the 

deadline of submission of their annual GPBs and ARs to the central office.

viii. Xxxx 
 

65. On April 22, 2021, a letter was received from the agency’s GAD Focal Point 
System (GFPS) informing the Audit Team that the agency has no existing annual GPB for 

Fiscal Year 2020, but an Accomplishment Report (AR) was attached to the letter.  

 

66. The Audit Team was informed by the GFPS personnel that it has been a practice of 
the CWC not to prepare an annual GPB because they are not aware of the procedures to be 

undertaken in the preparation of the GPB as provided in Section 4.4 of the 

DBM/NEDA/NCFRW Joint Circular No. 2004 and Section 7.0 of PCW-NEDA-DBM 

Joint Circular No. 2012-01.  Likewise, the attached AR was not also submitted to the PCW 



44 

 

for its review/comment and approval.  However, the GAD personnel had committed that 

for next year’s GPB, they will follow the right procedures.  

 

67. Management commented that the non-submission of the GAD Plan and Budget was 
due to limited manpower. 

 

68. As a result of the non-preparation and non-submission of the GPB and AR to the 
PCW, no GPB and AR as endorsed by PCW were submitted to the Audit Team (AT), thus, 

preventing the AT from conducting a timely audit and review of agency compliance with 

applicable rules and regulations. 

 

69. We recommended and Management agreed to require the GFPS personnel to: 
 

a. undergo orientation or training on the proper implementation and 
management of GAD funds; 

  

b. prepare and submit the GPB and AR to the DSWD-Central Office or 
directly to the PCW for review, so that any revision/recommendation will 

be acted upon; and 

 

c. strictly observe the time frame as provided under Section 7.0 of PCW-
NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01 and Section 4.4 of the 

DBM/NEDA/NCFRW Joint Circular No. 2004 
 

b) No GAD activity as provided under Section 31 of the General Provisions of the GAA 
for CY 2020 was identified in the Accomplishment Report submitted and no amount 

from the agency’s appropriations was utilize for GAD related activities. 

 

70. Section 31 of the General Provisions of the 2020, General Appropriations Act 
(GAA) provides that “all agencies of the government shall formulate a Gender and 

Development (GAD) Plan designed to address gender issues within their concerned sectors 

or mandate and implement the applicable provisions under R.A. No. 9710 or the Magna 

Carta of Women, Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against 

Women, the Beijing Platform for Action, the Philippines Plan for Gender-Responsive 

Development (1995-2025) and the Philippines Development Plan (2017-2022). 

 

71. “The GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of the agencies, which 
shall be at least five percent (5%) of their budgets. For this purpose, activities currently 

being undertaken by agencies which relate to GAD or those that contribute to poverty 

alleviation, economic empowerment especially of marginalized women, protection, 

promotion, and fulfilment of women’s human rights, and practice of gender-responsive 

governance are considered sufficient compliance with said requirement. Utilization of the 

GAD budget shall be evaluated based on the GAD performance indicators identified by 

the said agencies.  

 



45 

 

72. “The preparation and submission of the annual GAD Plan and annual GAD 
Accomplishment Report shall be subject to the guidelines issued by the agencies 

concerned.” 

 

73. Review of the CY 2020 Accomplishment Report disclosed that the activities 
identified in the report were not related to GAD issues/matters as provided in Section 31 

of the General Provisions of the 2020 GAA. According to the GAD Focal Point personnel, 

the absence of their GAD Plan was the cause why they were not able to program the 

activities that were related to GAD issues/matters. The activities that are included in their 

accomplishment report, and as presented below, merely involve Trainings and Webinars 

on Children with disabilities and on the Youth Development, their mental health during the 

COVID-19 Pandemic, HIV awareness on mother and child transmission, and 

cyberbullying on the internet, among others.  Details of the AR submitted are as follows:

74. For CY 2020, the agency’s total appropriation was P118,171,000.00 and five 
percent (5%) of which is equivalent to P5,908,550.00 that was not utilized as reported in 

Table 10.   
 

75. Likewise, the activities undertaken for Youth Development, presented in Table 11, 
were not part of the GAD under Section 31 of the General Provision of the GAA. A separate 

provision, specifically Section 33 of GAA 2020 is for Projects Related to the Youth.  
 

76. We recommended and Management agreed to require the GAD Focal Point to 
include in the GPB, activities as provided in Section 31 of the General Provisions of 

the GAA for CY 2020 and utilize at least five percent (5%) of their total 

appropriations. 
 

77. Management commented that they sent an email to the PCW requesting for their 
Technical Assistance in formulating GPB together with capacity building activities for 

CWC staff since many of the personnel are newly hired.

1. Adolescent Health During 
COVID 19 

During the onset of the pandemic, young 
people had a hard time coping up with the new 
normal as they were restricted to leave their 
homes and limited to interact with peers. On 
top of this, COVID 19 posed a threat not only 
in their physical health but in their mental state 
as well. Physical and sexual abuse, mental 
health problem and family problem contributed 
so much to their anxiety and stress. To 
understand and assess the issues and 
concerns of children during pandemic, the 
CWC in partnership with UNICEF conducted a 
webinar on: Adolescent Health During COVID-
19” last April 30, 2020 to discuss mental 
health, online adolescent engagements and 
tips for their well-being during quarantine. The 
resource speakers invited were experts on 
mental health, youth engagements and 
children protection. The webinar was a fruitful 
event as participants were allowed to ask 
questions to speakers which they willingly 
answered. 

No fund was 
disbursed. The 
activity was done 
online. 

2. Co-Creating New Normal for 
the Participation of Young 
People During COVID-19 
Pandemic. 

While young people have been one of those 
who were affected by the pandemic, young 
people were also amongst those who heed the 
call to shape new forms of programs and 
projects for the benefit of many. To know more 
about the initiatives spearheaded by different 
youth organizations in the Philippines, the 
CWC in partnership with UNICEF Philippines, 
ING Philippines and Positive Youth 
Development Network conducted a webinar 
entitled “Co-Creating New Normal for the 
Participation of Young People During COVID-
19 Pandemic. This webinar shared and 
discussed how youth and young professionals

use their knowledge and skills to come up with

fighting against the effect of COVID- 19. 

3. Good Practices and 
Challenges in Engaging 
Young People in HIV and 
Adolescent Health towards 
the Better Normal. 

The CWC has been working closely with 
different networks to coordinate. Review, 
monitor and evaluate laws that are critical to 
children. Thus, in order to fulfill its commitment 
to answer concerns on adolescent health, 
CWC, in partnership with UNICEF Philippines 
conducted its third webinar on adolescent 
health which was about the challenges and 
best practices of organizations to scale up the 
initiative and strategies implemented to 
improve the current HIV program. The webinar 
was participated by youth organizations who 
shared the good practices in relation to HIV 
programs and projects they have during the 
pandemic. 

No fund disbursed. 
The activity was 
done online. 

4. Training Manual on 
Adolescent Mental Health and 
Psycho-Social Support 
(MHPSS). 

CWC, UNICEF and other government partners 
have started working on MHPSS initiatives 
even before the pandemic such as the mental 
health camps for at risk sectors and future 
screening of advocacy films with learning 
modules. As such, there is a need to scale up 
efforts and initiate relevant actions to ensure 
the health, safety, and protection of the rights 
of Filipino children and adolescents, especially 
during this pandemic and the training manual 
is expected to be finalized for its immediate 
use. Hence, a technical working group 
composed of MHPSS experts from various 
public agencies and private sectors and 
members from National Child Protection 
Working Group (NCPWG) were on-board in

With the support of UNICEF Philippines, CWC, 
DOH and National Youth Commission, 
Positive Youth Development Network (PYDN)

Safety (HEEEADS) Tool, mental health 
awareness promotion through social media, 
and implementation of (45) low-cost, youth-led 
mental health programs in local communities 
with a path to service integration. According to 
young people through a series of Focused-
group discussions, hotlines are managed by 
adults wherein the approach is not proactive. 
Moreover, youth participation is disregarded. 
Thus, YHHI steps in to address these gaps by 
training young people to serve like their own 
supportive friends which according to them is 
more effective, capacitating to them is more 
effective, capacitating youth organizations to 
reach out their peers as a form of demand 
generation and rapid assessment. They were 
armed with multimodal and youth-friendly tools 
to effectively engage their peers. Finally, YYHI 
empowers young people to design and 
implement projects in their localities that are 
culturally-sensitive and appropriate. Currently, 
YHHI is able to engage 12,581 young people 
both in offline and online platforms, 656681 
able to receive adolescent-focused mental 
health support resources, 300 calls conducted 
and facilitated, 30 certified adolescent chat line 
responders and 45 youth organizations 
implementing community-based mental health 
and psychosocial support programs in 
geographically-isolated and disadvantage 
communities. 

6. Young Heroes Initiative – 
High Five 

In October 2020, CWC together with UNICEF 
Philippines, ING and Positive Youth 
Development Network launched the Young 
Heroes Initiative – High Five that aimed to 
provide adolescents an innovative platform in 
proposing solutions to fight stigma and 
discrimination, promoting positive discourse 
on sexual health and halting the increment of 
HIV/AIDS cases among their peers. The 
participants underwent thorough and 
extensive training all throughout the program 
which brought us to six (6) successful teams in 
the final rounds. The six (6) Grand Finalists 
were awarded and entitled to a cash grant of 
Php100,000.00 to implement their project for

7. Development of Learning 
Modules and Screening of 
Film “Click, Like and Share” 

In collaboration with UNICEF and Positive 
Youth Development Network, CWC 
spearheaded the development of learning 
modules on the advocacy film entitled: “Click, 
Like, and Share: that tackles on the issues 
concerning children such as mental health, 
cyberbullying, and HIV. Further, online 
screening of the advocacy film and its 
accompanying learning modules were 
presented and evaluated by government 
partners, private stakeholders, RC/SCWCs 
representatives and adolescents itself to 
ensure that the advocacy materials are aligned 
to the adolescent health and child protection. 
The film consists of three (3) episodes that 
separately discuss the mental health, cyber 
bullying and HIV. The first episode on mental 
health provides the significance of ensuring 
appropriate measures and interventions are 
established to address this issue on children. 
The second episode tackles the current 
interventions and measures on cyberbullying 
specifically peer violence and the 
establishment of safe spaces for the children 
on the internet. Lastly, the third episode 
explored the various areas in the advocacy on 
HIV, specifically the issue of mother-to-child 
transmission that is often overlooked by the 
government and civil society. Furthermore, this 
episode will strengthen our advocacy in 
reducing stigma that is being experienced by 
persons including children living and/or 
affected by HIV.

80. Table 11 shows the activities undertaken for youth development wherein no funds 
were disbursed for most of the activities undertaken by the agency. However, it was 

observed that some activities were either funded by the United Nations Children’s Fund 

(UNICEF) and Positive Youth Development Network (PYDN). 

 

81. We recommended and Management agreed to include in the Agency’s plans 
and budget the projects and activities that will help address the concerns of Youth 

Development.

Senior Citizens (SCs) and Persons with Disabilities (PWDs) 

 

82. The Agency incorporated activities for the children with disabilities but failed 
to incorporate issues and concerns for the elderly. 

 

83. Section 32 of the General Provisions of RA 11465, otherwise known as the GAA 
of FY 2020, requires that all agencies of the government shall formulate plans, programs 

and projects intended to address the concerns of senior citizens and persons with disability, 

insofar as it relates to their mandated functions, and integrate the same in their regular 

activities. Moreover, all government infrastructures and facilities shall provide 

architectural or structural features, designs or facilities that will reasonably enhance the 

mobility, safety and welfare of SCs and PWDs, pursuant to Batas Pambansa Blg. 344 and 

RA 7277, as amended. 

 

84. RA 7277 or the Magna Carta for PWDs mandates the rehabilitation, self-
development and self-reliance of disabled persons and their integration into the mainstream 

of society and for other purposes. It further defines the rights and privileges of disabled 

persons such as equal opportunity for employment, access to quality education, national 

health program, auxiliary, social services, telecommunications, accessibility (barrier-free 

environment), political and civil rights.  

 

85. In CY 2020, the CWC incorporated activities for the children with disabilities in 
their regular operations. However, they failed to incorporate issues and concerns on the 

elderly as in the previous year which was not in accordance with the cited regulation; thus, 

the reiteration of this observation. 

 

86. We reiterated our previous year’s recommendation and Management agreed 
to include in the agency’s plans and budget the projects and activities that will help 

address the concerns of the Senior Citizens. 
 

Compliance with other Mandatory Accounts 

 

87. For CY 2020, Management faithfully complied with the withholding and 
remittance of deductions from the salaries of its personnel, the required taxes, premiums 

and loan installments, as well as the government share, and remitted the same to the 

concerned institutions or agencies, in compliance with pertinent laws, rules, and 

regulations, as summarized in Table 12.

unremitted.  

 
88. It was observed that the Agency regularly remits the taxes withheld on the 
following month, but a comparison of the monthly taxes withheld and the total remittances 

made as covered by the TRA showed that there were (over)/under remittances for most of 

the months in CY 2020, contrary to paragraph 4.2.7 of DOF-DBM-COA Joint Circular No. 

1-2000 dated January 3, 2000. According to the Accountant, they have overlooked the 

remittances made. The over/under remittances were corrected in the following month with 

remaining under-remittance of P14,904.67 as at year-end.  

 

89. Moreover, review of the Due to GSIS, Due to Philhealth and Due to Pag-IBIG 
accounts revealed the unremitted premiums of P4,401.67, P1,356.68 and P200.00, 

respectively, due to unreconciled forwarded balance from previous years. 

 

90. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accounting Unit to:  
 

a. properly monitor the withholding and remittance of taxes to avoid 
over/under remittance; 

 

b. remit to the BIR the under-remittance of P14,904.67;  
 

c. comply with Section 4.2 of DOF-DBM-COA Joint Circular No. 1-2000 in 
adjusting the (over)/under-remittances of all taxes to be considered in the

following month’s request for TRA issuance, to avoid incurrence of 

discrepancy in the account; and 

 

d. reconcile and remit the unremitted premiums of P4,401.67, P1,356.68 and 
P200.00 to the GSIS, PhilHealth and Pag-IBIG, respectively. 

 

91. Management commented that all taxes withheld were already remitted to the BIR. 
However, audit revealed that there was still an under-remittance of P14,904.67.  

 

Hiring and payment of Job Order Personnel 

 

92. In CY 2020, under a Memorandum of Agreement, the agency hired 39 additional 
Job Order personnel equivalent to 156 percent of the 25 regular plantilla employees to 

provide administrative and technical assistance in the implementation of the Agency’s 

program/projects for the year. The compensation was charged against the Maintenance and 

Other Operating Expenses (MOOE) account amounting to P11,749,324.86. 

 

Enforcement of Audit Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges 

 

93. Section 9.4 of the 2009 Rules and Regulations on the Settlement of Accounts 
(RRSA) under COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009, provides that, “A 

suspension should be settled within ninety (90) calendar days from receipt of the Notice of
