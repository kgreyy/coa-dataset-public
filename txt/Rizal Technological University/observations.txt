PART II – OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

 

FINANCIAL AUDIT 

 

Accounting Errors/Omissions  

 

1. Misstatements in the aggregate amount of P18,126,525.43 due to accounting 

errors and omissions in the accounts Cash and Cash Equivalents, Receivables, 

Property, Plant and Equipment and Payables exceeded the materiality 

threshold of P5,588,256.07, computed at one percent of the total Expenses of 

P558,825,606.68 for the year ended December 31, 2020.  

 

1.1 Section 27 of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards 

(IPSAS) 1 and Section 15, Chapter 2, Government Accounting Manual 

(GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I, states that 

“The financial statements (FSs) shall present fairly the financial position, 

financial performance and cash flows of an entity.  Fair presentation 

requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other 

events, and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition 

criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses set out in PPSAS1.  The 

application of PPSAS,1 with appropriate disclosures, if necessary would 

result in fair presentation of the FSs.” 

 

1.2 Likewise, Section 111 of PD No. 1445 requires agencies to keep the 

accounts in such detail as necessary to meet the needs of the agency and at 

the same time be adequate to furnish information needed by fiscal or 

control agencies of the government and that the highest standard of 

honesty, objectivity and consistency shall be observed in the keeping of 

accounts to safeguard against inaccurate or misleading information.  

Furthermore, Section 112 thereof requires that government agency shall 

record its financial transactions and operations conformably with generally 

accepted accounting principles and in accordance with pertinent laws and 

regulations. 

 

1.3 Audit of the accounts of RTU as of December 31, 2020 disclosed errors 

and omissions that misstated the account balances in the FS by an 

aggregate amount of P18,126,525.43.  The details are tabulated as follows 

and discussed in the succeeding paragraphs:

1.6 The CMs and DMs in the amounts of P3,762,345.00 and P6,000.00, 

respectively, were not taken up in the books of accounts due to the absence 

of copies of the said Memos.  Likewise, upon further verification, it was 

also noted that two stale checks with Check Nos. 211990 and 212089 in the 

amounts of P2,400.00 and P682,017.39 or a total of P684,417.39 were not 

reverted at yearend.  

 

1.7 The Interest Income in the total amount of P66,223.93 was not taken up in 

the books, which could be attributed to late submission of the Bank 

Statements by the LBP to the Accounting Office of the University resulting 

in non/delayed preparation and submission of BRS.  As noted, no BRS was 

prepared and submitted for CYs 2016 to 2018. 

 

1.8 Cash is the most vulnerable asset of an organization.  Sound internal 

control on cash requires prompt and correct recording and reporting of 

transactions to ensure that financial information is reliable, accurate and 

reported within the given accounting period.  Thus, bank reconciliation 

provides necessary control mechanism to uncover possible irregularities. 

 



 

39 
 

1.9 The misstatement in the Cash and Cash Equivalents account occurred due 

to non-adherence with certain rules and regulations as provided in the 

GAM for NGAs, Volume I, as cited in succeeding paragraphs. 

 

1.10 Section 6, Chapter 21 - the Chief Accountant shall prepare a Journal Entry 

Voucher (JEV) to recognize all reconciling items that require adjustments 

and corrections in the books of accounts.  Furthermore, Section 7 of the 

same regulation requires the Chief Accountant to submit the BRS within 

twenty (20) days upon receipt of the monthly Bank Statements with all the 

supporting documents and JEV to the COA Auditor. 

 

1.11 Section 44, Chapter 6 -Accounting for Cancelled Checks, checks may be 

cancelled when they become stale, voided or spoiled.  The depository bank 

considers a check as stale if it has been outstanding for over six (6) months 

from date of issue.  A stale, voided or spoiled check shall be marked 

cancelled on its face and reported as follows:  a) voided, spoiled or 

unclaimed stale checks with the cashier shall be reported as cancelled in the 

List of Unreleased Checks that will be attached to the Report of Checks 

Issued (RCI).  New checks may be issued for the replacement of 

stale/spoiled checks in the hands of the payee or holder in due course, upon 

submission of the stale/spoiled checks to the Accounting Division/Unit.  A 

certified copy of the previously paid DVs shall be attached to the request 

for replacement.  A JEV shall be prepared to take up the cancellation.  The 

replacement check shall be reported to the RCI. 

 

1.12 Section 57, Chapter 19- the balance of all Cash – Treasury/Agency 

Deposit, Regular shall be closed at the end of the year to the Accumulated 

Surplus/(Deficit) account. 

 

1.13 We recommended and the Management agreed, to: 

 

a. thru the Chief Accountant, effect correcting entries for the 

unrecorded CM, DMs and Income in the amounts of 

P3,762,345.00; P6,000.00 and P66,223.93, respectively, to be 

supported with complete documentation;  

 

b. cause the reversion of the stale checks amounting to P684,417.39 

to Cash and Payable accounts; and 

 

c.  close the Cash – Treasury/Agency Deposit, Regular account to 

Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) as required by existing 

regulations. 

 



 

40 
 

Receivables Account Misstatement – P253,373.30 

 

1.14 Erroneous recording of settlement of disallowances resulted in the 

misstatement/overstatement of P253,373.30 in the reported balance of 

Receivables-Disallowances/Charges of P8,449,359.50.  

 

1.15 Section 46, Chapter 6 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, states that 

disallowances shall be taken up in the books of accounts only when they 

become final and executory, by a debit to Receivables-

Disallowances/Charges and a credit to appropriate account for the current 

year or Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) account if pertaining to expenses of 

prior years. 

 

1.16 The Receivables – Disallowances/Charges was debited in CY 2009 and 

2010 in the amounts of P5,947,509.25 and P8,418,620.34, respectively, to 

recognize the Notices of Disallowance (NDs) issued for the unauthorized 

payment of emergency cost of living allowance (ECOLA) that had become 

final and executory after no appeal was filed within the reglementary 

period. 

 

1.17 The financial statements (FSs) and other accounting reports as of 

December 31, 2020 submitted to the Office of the Auditor showed a 

balance of disallowances in the amount of P8,449,359.50.  Audit revealed 

that there were erroneous entries dating back to CYs 2011, 2013 and 2019 

to 2020 on the settlement of the disallowances that overstated the 

Receivables – Disallowances/Charges account by P253,373.30, thereby 

overstating the Accumulated Surplus/Deficit by the same amount as 

presented in the table below:

1.18 Verification disclosed that above transactions were actually deductions 

from the salaries of the employees in partial payment/refund of the 

disallowances. However, instead of debiting said amounts to decrease the 



 

42 
 

balance of the Receivables –Disallowances/Charges, they were recorded 

otherwise, thus the overstatement.   

 

1.19 Also, tracing back from the submitted DVs, JEVs and GL, it was found out 

that the total refunds made from CYs 2010 to 2020 in the records of the 

Accounting Office and per audit has a difference of P1,821,146.07 as 

shown in the table below:

1.20 The Team had a hard time verifying the records of the Accounting Office 

since they did not prepare and maintain subsidiary ledgers (SLs) for each 

official/employee determined to be liable/responsible for amount 

disallowed, and there are no indices being prepared by the Human 

Resource Development Center (HRDC) to keep track of the deductions 

being made from each official/employee. 

 

1.21 We recommended, and the Management agreed: 

 

a. thru the HRDC Director, to reconcile records with the 

Accounting Office of the total deductions appearing in the 

payroll and the records of the Accounting to ensure proper 

monitoring of the balances of disallowances as well as the 

settlement of the balances through employee payroll deduction; 

and 

 

b. thru the Accountant, (i) to prepare a JEV for the 

adjustments/corrections affecting said accounts; (ii) to prepare 

and maintain SLs for each official/employee with disallowance; 

and (iii) to submit to COA the revised report, together with the 

complete documents to support the balance presented in the FS. 



 

43 
 

                    

1.22 Management commented that actions were already taken on the 

observations and recommendations aforementioned.  The HRDC Director 

and the Accountant are to reconcile records once documents and other 

records become available. 

 

1.23 The Audit Team will continue to monitor the implementation by the 

Management of the recommendations. 

 

Property, Plant and Equipment Account Misstatement – P686,594.50 

 

1.24 The balance of Property, Plant and Equipment in the amount of 

P795,594,958.54 is misstated by P686,594.50 due to the under 

recording of the carrying values of Land Account at P29,027,807.50 

instead of P29,714,402.00, the actual values of the various parcels of 

land.

1.25 According to IPSAS 17, the cost of an item of PPE shall be recognized if, 

and only if (a) it is probable that future economic benefits or service 

potential associated with the item will flow to the entity, and (b) the cost or 

fair value of the item can be measured reliably. 

 

1.26 Moreover, Sections 14, and 15 of Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs, 

Volume I, prescribe that intra-agency transfers of PPE shall be recognized 

at the carrying amount of asset received.  The receiving office shall 



 

44 
 

recognize the asset at its original historical cost less accumulated 

depreciation and impairment loss.  For inter-agency transfer of PPE, 

transfer from one government entity to another shall be recognized by the 

recipient entity at net carrying value.  The transferor shall derecognize the 

PPE account upon transfer. 

 

1.27 The parcel of land donated by the Mandaluyong City Government, with an 

area of 15,429 square meters which houses the old buildings of the 

University was only recorded as one of the properties of the University but 

no value was assigned in the books, thus making the Land account 

understated.  The Management should have verified with the Assessor’s 

Office and secured a copy of the Tax Declaration wherein the value of the 

property can be sourced so that correct valuation will be recorded in the 

books and the correct total Land account balance will be reflected in the 

FSs. 

 

1.28 We recommended that Management: 

 

a. thru the Accountant, prepare a JEV to adjust the recorded 

balance of the 10 parcels of land to P29,714,402.00 and not 

P29,027,807.50, to come up with correct Land account balance 

in the FS; 

 

b. thru the Property Officer, secure from the Assessor’s Office of 

Mandaluyong City (transferor), copy of the Tax Declaration of 

the donated property to get the proper valuation of the said 

property; and 

 

c. thru the Accountant, record the correct value of the donated 

property upon receipt of the Tax Declaration of the donated 

property with the proper valuation. 

 

1.29 The Management commented that the Accounting Office is in constant 

communication with the Administrative Services Center with regard to the 

processing of the transfer of ownership from the Mandaluyong City to the 

University as well as with the Supply and Property Office for the proper 

valuation of the donated land. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

1.30 The Audit Team clarified with the RTU officials the difference between the 

recorded balance of the Land account and the balance per audit of the 

documents pertaining to parcels of land owned by the University.  Also, we 



 

45 
 

emphasized the need to provide timelines to ensure compliance with the 

audit recommendations. 

 

Payables Misstatement - P10,414,143.58 

 

1.31 The Payables account is misstated by P10,414,143.58 pertaining to 

Accounts Payable for abandoned construction projects and unclaimed 

allowances of scholars since CY 2016, which should have been reverted 

to the Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) account.  

 

1.32 Executive Order No. 87 dated August 13, 2019 of the President of the 

Philippines directs that all accounts payable which remained outstanding 

for two years or more in the books of the National Government Agencies 

be reverted to the Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) of the General Fund or 

the Cumulative Results of Operations of the National Government. 

 

1.33 Section 98 of PD No. 1445 also provides that any unliquidated balances of 

accounts payable in the books of the National Government which has been 

outstanding for two (2) years or more and against which no actual claim, 

administrative or judicial, has been filed or which is not covered by 

perfected contract on record may be reverted to the unappropriated surplus 

of the General Fund of the National Government Agencies, except for 

unliquidated balances of accounts payable in trust funds as long as the 

purposes for which the funds were created have been accomplished. 

 

1.34 Audit of the Payables accounts of the University as of December 31, 2020, 

particularly the Accounts Payable with a balance of P97,998,212.82,   

revealed that based on the Schedule of Accounts Payable, the balance of 

Accounts Payables as of December 31, 2020 includes payable to 

contractors for abandoned/unfinished projects of more than two to five 

years, and unclaimed scholarship grants since 2016 in the total amount of 

P10,414,143.58, which rendered the Payables account overstated by the 

same amount considering that these payables should have been reverted to 

the Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit). 

 

1.35 We recommended that Management effect the reversion of the 

dormant payables to Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) account in 

accordance with EO No. 87 dated August 13, 2019. 

 

1.36 The Accountant responded that analysis of the Accounts Payable account 

will be made and they will trace past records to effect reversion, if 

warranted. 

 



 

46 
 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

1.37 We would like to emphasize that it is imperative that the Management 

specify timeline concerning the tracing of documents related to the dormant 

Liability accounts and the preparation of the resulting adjustment, if any, in 

the books. 

 

Other Accounting Controls Deficiencies 

 

2. Four accounts with year-end aggregate balance of P1.121 billion are of 

doubtful validity due to the various accounting deficiencies in the total amount 

of P235,219,588.56 and control lapses, which affected the accuracy and 

completeness of the reported balances in the FSs.

accounts, nine for Current Account, 10 for Saving Account, and one for 

Cash Foreign Currency with a balance of $2,566.19 (amount shown in the 

table is the conversion of P48.036 per dollar rate at year-end), with a total 

balance of P869,317,274.32, which does not reconcile with the book 

balance  of P927,410,629.40, or a difference of P58,093,355.08, presented

2.2 Among the identified reasons for the unadjusted discrepancy in the book 

and bank balances are as follows: 

 

a) Non-maintenance of GL by the previous Accountant and the non-

preparation of BRS for the previous years; 

 

b) Accumulation of reconciling items in prior years, which remained 

unadjusted/unrecorded in the books as per BRS submitted by the 



 

48 
 

Accounting Office for three major bank accounts for CY 2020 in 

the total amount of P22,237,140.81; and 

 

c) Understatement of Cash Foreign Currency account with a bank 

balance of $2,566.19 when converted to cash as of audit date with a 

conversion rate of P48.036, the amount to be recorded in the books 

should be P123,269.50 ($2,566.19 X P48.036). 

 

2.3 We recommended that Management: 

 

a. thru the Accountant, trace the discrepancies between the bank 

and book balances and reconcile said discrepancies so that the 

correct balance of Cash and Cash Equivalents account shall be 

reported in the Statement of Financial Position; 

 

b. see to it that Bank Reconciliation Statement shall be prepared 

for all bank accounts regularly and within the prescribed 

period; 

 

c. prepare and submit prior years’ BRS to adjust the accumulated 

reconciling items of P22,237,140.81, which is captioned as 

outstanding balances from previous years; and  

 

d. prepare the corresponding JEV to correct the discrepancy in   

recording the conversion to peso of the dollar account to the 

Cash in Bank - Foreign Currency account. 

 

2.4 During the exit conference, the Management assured that they will look 

into the above observations and promised to abide by the 

recommendations. 

 

2.5 The Audit Team will coordinate with the Accounting Office and continue 

to monitor the implementation of the recommendations. 

 

Receivables  

 

Undocumented negative balance of Due from Other Funds and discrepancy 

between the Accounting record and per audit of the Receivables- 

Disallowances/Charges 

 

2.6 The accounting deficiencies on Receivables are summarized as follows:

- The negative balance in this account increased 
to P57,191,192.01 in CY 2020 from its CY 

2019 negative balance of P33,250,902.34, 

which cannot be readily traced due to absence 

of documents and the non-preparation of SLs 

57,191,192.01 

b. Discrepancy between the Accounting Office 
records and per audit of the Receivable- 

Disallowances/Charges (see Table 4) 

1,821,146.07 

Total  59,012,338.08 

 

2.7 We recommended, and Management agreed, to: 

 

a. analyze the Due from other Funds account and review the 

transactions to determine the cause and details of the huge 

negative balance of the account; and 

 

b. prepare adjusting entries to correct the balances of the 

accounts. 

 

Advances 

 

Misclassification in the recording of cash advances 

 

2.8 Recording errors, which are not in conformity with Chapter 3 on 

Description of Accounts of the GAM for NGAs, Volume III on Advances, 

were also noted, where seven out of 39 of the cash advances granted to the 

Agency’s AOs for the special purpose/time-bound undertakings were 

recorded as Advances to Officers and Employees instead of Advances to 

Special Disbursing Officers.  Also, four of the cash advances granted to the 

Head Cashier, a regular DO, for payment of incentives due to officers and 

employees were recorded under Advances to Special Disbursing Officers 

instead of Advances for Payroll. 

  

2.9 Out of the year-end balance of Advances to Officers and Employees and 

Advances to Special Disbursing Officers, cash advances amounting to 

P831,921.36 and P940,750.00, should have been recognized as Advances 

to Special Disbursing Officer and Advances for Payroll, respectively.  

 



 

50 
 

2.10 We recommended that Management, thru the Accountant, ensure the 

proper recording of the Advances account. 

 

Trust Liabilities and Other Payables 

 

                         Non-moving Trust Liabilities of more than two years and Other Payables with no 

SLs /documents on record 

 

2.11 The accuracy, existence and completeness of the Trust Liabilities and Other 

Payables with year-end balances of P43,096.32 and P116,298,127.72, 

respectively, could not be ascertained as they represent inactive, non-

moving and outstanding balances for more than three years.   

 

2.12 Audit of the Trust Liabilities and Other Payables accounts disclosed that 

their balances were inactive, non-moving and remained outstanding for 

more than two years, as follows:

2.13 We recommended that Management thru the Accountant: 

 

a. prioritize the documentation of the Other Payables account to 

substantiate the huge balance thereof and periodically monitor 

the same; and  

 

b. revert the dormant payables to Accumulated Surplus/Deficit in 

accordance with EO No.  87 and Section 98 of PD No. 1445.  

 

COMPLIANCE AUDIT 

 

Audit of COVID-19 Fund Utilization 

 

3. Funds received from the Commission on Higher Education (CHED), through 

its Higher Education Development Fund (HEDF), as grant for the Project of 

Production of Alcohol-Based Hand Rub Sanitizer as part of the activities to 

combat COVID-19, amounting to P1,458,897.50 remained unutilized due to:           



 

51 
 

(i) delayed implementation of the scheduled activities; and (ii) the 

unpreparedness of the chosen facility or laboratory for the production of the 

alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Also, RTU has failed to provide the Audit Team 

the weekly reports and SLs submitted to CHED to monitor project 

implementation. 

 

Part 1 – Authority to Conduct Research 

 

3.1 President Rodrigo Roa Duterte, through Proclamation No. 922 dated March 

8, 2020, declared the Philippines under the State of Public Health 

Emergency upon confirmation of local transmission of Corona Virus 

Disease (COVID-19) in the Philippines.  Section 2 of Proclamation No. 

922 states that:  

 

“All government agencies and LGUs are hereby enjoined to 

render full assistance and cooperation and mobilize the 

necessary resources to undertake critical, urgent, and 

appropriate response and measure in a timely manner to 

curtail and eliminate the COVID-19 threat.” 

 

3.2 Under Section 4 (y) of Republic Act No. 11469, also known as “Bayanihan 

to Heal as One Act,” the President is authorized to allocate cash, funds, 

investments, including unutilized or unreleased subsidies and transfers, 

held by any GOCC or any national government agency in order to address 

the COVID-19 emergency. 

 

3.3 CHED Memorandum Order No. 1 s. 2020, effective April 2, 2020, 

prescribes the Guidelines for the Grant of Assistance to State Universities 

and Colleges to Combat COVID-19.  SUCs are authorized by law/charter 

to conduct research and extension services, including projects that will 

improve and intensify the government’s existing COVID-19 responses. 

CHED undertakes its efforts to mobilize HEIs to assist in the production 

and distribution of items (such as disinfectants, alcohol, face shields, etc.) 

for use by frontline service providers.  The CHED issues guidelines in 

response to the national emergency by allocating/utilizing its funds towards 

mitigating the social, economic, and financial impact of COVID-19 on 

Filipinos. Under the same Memorandum, the grant is open to SUCs to 

conduct extension and public service programs to combat COVID-19.  

 

3.4 Section III of the same memorandum provides the documentary 

requirements which shall include the following: 

a. Certification by the President that the SUC has the 

expertise to undertake the proposed project with CVs or 



 

52 
 

short biosketches of experts (for Items 2.a and 2.b) or 

number of potential volunteers (for Item 2.c) and that it has 

the equipment, raw materials or access thereof, and 

facilities to undertake the project including a description 

thereof; 

b. Full-blown proposal (see attached template) with the 

following information: 

i. Line item budget; 

ii. Work Plan; 

iii. Terms of Reference/scope of the project; 

iv. Log frame; 

v. Description of the significance of the project in 

terms of its benefits to the community as well as the 

expected outcome of the activity 

vi. Method 

vii. Distribution plan for products with the following 

prioritization: 1) LGUs using SUCs facility as 

quarantine/community isolation units; 2) LGUs, 

with little or no capacity of producing the proposed 

products. 

viii. Email and mobile numbers of proponents; 

c. Proof of coordination with the local government, the 

Department of Health, or the local security forces, as 

applicable, to ensure reasonable compliance with their 

policies, standards or guidelines related to the project, as 

evidenced by a letter sent and duly received by the 

concerned offices. 

d. Proposed Memorandum of Agreement signed by the SUC 

President and a witness which will be processed if the 

proposal is approved; 

e. Certification by the President that the proposed projects are 

subject to ratification by the Governing Board of the SUC 

concerned and that it has been forwarded to the Board 

Chair for approval via referendum; and 

f. Project Summary Sheet 

 

3.5 The Project Team headed by Prof. Marita Geroy, forwarded the above 

listed documents on December 17, 2020 upon request of the COA Audit 

Team. However, the submitted Certification by Dr. Yangco as University 

President for Item 1 of the required documents is lacking of short 

biosketches or CV of experts as required by aforesaid provisions. 

 



 

53 
 

3.6 The RTU, in reference to the submitted certifications dated April 22, 2020, 

submitted three projects, namely: 

a. Vegetable Production using the RTU Developed Urban Planting 

Structures for Sustainability and Livelihood; 

b. Production of Alcohol-based Hand Rub Sanitizer; and 

c. Urban Production and Processing of Edible Mushrooms as Relief and 

Rehabilitation Functions during National Crisis. 

 

3.7 The Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between CHED as First Party and 

RTU as Second Party, signed June 8, 2020, stipulates that the First Party 

will render additional financial support to the Second Party in order to 

upgrade their institutional capability and sustain the production of much 

needed goods and/or delivery of important services. 

 

3.8 Furthermore, the MOA provides that the First Party, through its HEDF, 

shall provide funding assistance to the Second Party in the amount of 

P1,458,897.50.  This amount was received by the Second Party on October 

22, 2020, and issued Official receipt (OR) No. 8683660 dated October 22, 

2020. 

 

3.9 Section I of the MOA provides the roles and responsibilities of the Second 

Party. Among the listed roles and responsibilities of the University is the 

preparation and submission of weekly reports and SLs that serve as 

monitoring of project implementation, which to date, remained 

unsubmitted to the Office of the Auditor. 

 

Part 2 – Project Preparation and Implementation 

 

3.10 Section 4 (k) of RA No. 11469 mandates the Government to procure in the 

most expeditious manner, as an exemption from the provisions of RA No. 

9184, including the medical goods, supplies and equipment that are 

necessary to mitigate, if not contain, the transmission of COVID-19, goods 

and services for social amelioration measures, utilities, telecommunications 

and other critical services; lease of real property or venue, and 

establishment, construction, and operation of temporary medical facilities. 

 

3.11 The GPPB, under Resolution No. 03-2020 dated March 9, 2020, approved 

the list of items submitted by the DOH, which are needed to address the 

current State of Public Health Emergency as shown in Annex B of the same 

resolution, of which includes alcohol and sanitizer as Item Nos. 1 and 2, 

respectively. 

 



 

54 
 

3.12 Section 5 (2) of the CHED Memorandum Order No. 1 s. 2020 on the 

Guidelines for the Grant of Assistance to SUCs to Combat COVID-19 

limits the grant for a period of 2 to 3 months from the release of funds.  In 

compliance with the MOA between CHED and RTU, Section XI provides 

that the agreement shall take effect upon the release of funds to the 

concerned HEI for the project implementation and shall be in effect for a 

period of three months from the release. 

 

3.13 Submitted copy of Approved Project Proposal detailed the Activities of the 

Project in the following manner and schedule:

3.14 Upon interview and inquiry with the Project Team, Supply Office, and Bids 

and Awards Committee (BAC), the project is still in the phase of 

procurement.  Supplies and materials are partially delivered while 

chemicals, drums and mixers and printer are pending delivery. 



 

55 
 

 

3.15 It is noted that there was   delay in the project implementation, contrary to 

the MOA and Approved Schedule of Activities in the Proposal.  The delay 

was due to the slow procurement process of the supplies and materials, and 

equipment needed. 

 

3.16 Furthermore, upon ocular inspection by the COA Audit Team on December 

28, 2020, it was observed that the chosen facility or laboratory is not fully 

prepared for the production of the alcohol-based hand sanitizer project.  It 

was observed that some parts of the laboratory need minor repairs and 

thorough cleaning for an efficient process during production. 

 

3.17 We recommended that Management: 

 

a. review the current status of the project, immediately process 

the request of extension of project implementation from CHED 

and observe the schedule set in the approved extended schedule 

of activities; 

 

b. thru the BAC Office and other involved offices, expedite the 

procurement and delivery process of the materials and 

equipment needed; 

 

c. prepare the facility or laboratory to its working condition while 

waiting for the materials and equipment; and 

 

d. submit and continuously copy furnish the COA Office of the 

weekly reports as well as SLs submitted to CHED as required 

under the MOA. 

 

3.18 Management commented that the reasons for the delay were due to:                

(a) lockdowns implemented since the signing of the MOA with CHED 

where the University cannot function at full capacity when some of the 

members of the workforce were infected with the virus; (b) problems 

encountered with the PhilGEPS wherein it was a challenge to post from the 

month of October until December 2020; and (c) the non-responsiveness of 

suppliers because of the cost declared in the Terms of Reference (TOR) 

dictated by the CHED.  Also, though delayed, the production of the project 

- alcohol-based hand sanitizer, is already near completion which will be 

ahead of the extended completion date set by the CHED. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 



 

56 
 

3.19 The Audit Team reminded the RTU officials concerned of the above 

recommendations wherein pertinent documents as well as updates on the 

status of the project should be submitted to the Auditor’s Office.  The said 

CHED-approved extension of deadline for the completion of the project 

remained unsubmitted by the Management. 

 

Delayed Tertiary Education Subsidy (TES) Benefits 

 

4. The delayed processing of the TES grants to qualified beneficiaries deferred 

the benefit of providing allowances to qualified students to support their 

education-related expenses.  Moreover, inability to take an action on the 

decreasing number of the CHED-identified, as well as, enrolled/admitted 

student-TES grantees denies the University’s other poor but deserving 

students the chance to enjoy the benefits of the government’s programs and 

projects contrary to the provisions of Section 7 of RA No. 10931 and Section 22 

of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) thereof. 

 

4.1 Section 7 of RA 10931, known as the “Universal Access to Quality 

Tertiary Education Act,” established a Tertiary Education Subsidy (TES) 

for Filipino students who shall enroll in undergraduate-post-secondary 

programs of State Universities and Colleges (SUCs), CHED-Recognized 

Local Universities and Colleges (LUCs), private Higher Education 

Institutions (HEIs), and all Technical Vocational Institutions (TVIs). 

 

4.2 Section 22 of the IRR of RA 10931 stipulates that the TES shall support the 

cost of tertiary education or any portion thereof.  Financial benefits under 

the TES mechanism entitles a student-grantee enrolled in SUCs and 

CHED-recognized LUCs to a maximum of Forty Thousand Pesos 

(P40,000.00) as grant per academic year or Twenty Thousand Pesos 

(P20,000.00) as grant per semester.  It covers, among others, allowance for 

books, supplies, transportation and miscellaneous personal expenses 

including a reasonable allowance for the documented rental or purchase of 

a personal computer or laptop and other education-related expenses and, 

allowance for room and board costs incurred by the students. 

 

4.3 Summary of fund transfers from the CHED of the TES financial benefit as 

well as the administrative cost of three percent for the AYs 2018 to 2019 

and 2019 to 2020, is shown below:

4.4 Review of the submitted disbursement vouchers (DVs), liquidations/report 

of disbursements, ORs, and JEVs showed that only P5,960,000.00 or 65.64 

percent of the total stipend was utilized and/or disbursed to the TES 

grantees as of December 31, 2020. 

 

4.5 Though partial amount of the TES subsidy for AYs 2018-2019 and 2019- 

2020 had been received by some of the intended beneficiaries, the 

remaining P2,800,000.00 or 30.84 percent of the total TES benefit 

remained idle in the University’s Trust Fund pending claims by the 

remaining grantees.   

 

4.6 Moreover, only P20,000.00 of the total amount of P320,000.00 

representing excess of the transferred funds was returned to CHED. The 

said excess was due to the difference between the list of CHED-validated 

number of grantees versus those enrolled and/or admitted in the University. 

  

4.7 Further, audit of the Administrative Support Cost (ASC) amounting to 

P272,400.00, of which P21,600.00 was already refunded to the CHED, 

showed zero utilization rate to date.  The ASC should have been used to 

monitor the receipt and utilization of the budget as well as processing of the 

liquidation of the fund transfers from CHED.  Likewise, the ASC can be 

used for notarization of documents, office supplies and materials, salary of 

project technical staff or job order, communication, transportation/travel, 

remedial/mentoring program, and meetings/orientation/seminars/general 

assembly. 

 

4.8 This low utilization/zero rate of the stipend and ASC, respectively, 

manifests a slow program/project implementation.  It also shows the 

inability of the University to maximize the use of the budget provided to it, 

which directly affects the delivery of services to the public. 

 

4.9 The purpose of the TES subsidy, as stated in the IRR of RA No. 10931, 

intends to support, among others, education-related expenses that include 

basic necessities of the students. ASC, on the other hand, aims to provide 

budget for the University to execute and properly comply with the 

functions, roles and responsibilities of the agency with regard to the TES 



 

58 
 

program.  Delay in the release of the grants may hinder the continuing 

education of the grantee as well as maximizing the limited resources of the 

government. 

 

4.10 The audit also showed that the Management did not comply with its 

responsibility to ensure prompt monitoring and recording of the receipt of 

funds as well as the liquidation/disbursement of funds to student grantees.  

TES subsidy amounting to P2,612,200.00 was belatedly recorded while 

P1,957,000.00 remained unrecorded.  The table below presents the delays 

incurred:

4.11 The remaining balance of the subsidy and ASC, the amount to be refunded, 

as well as the stipends released to student grantees in the total amount of 

P9,310,800.00 remained unliquidated with the CHED pending submission 

of the required Fund Utilization Report (FUR) and other documentary 

requirements. 

 

4.12 Furthermore, the number of qualified TES grantees identified by the CHED 

decreased from a total of 134 in AY 2018 – 2019 to 91-95 in AY 2019 – 

2020.  The same case of declining rate is also true of beneficiaries

Tertiary Education Subsidy (TES) Grantee

No. of Grantees Identified by CHED

Table 13.  Declining Rate of Beneficiaries Enrolled/Admitted 

 

  

 

4.13 The result of the review counters the objectives and goals of the University, 

namely, to ensure increased relevance and quality tertiary education to 

achieve inclusive growth and access of deserving but poor students to 

quality tertiary education. 

 

4.14 We recommended that Management: 

 

a. expedite the release to the remaining student grantees of the 
TES subsidy amounting to P2,800,000.00; 

 

b. revert to the CHED the amount of P300,000.00 excess fund 
transfers computed as the difference between the list of CHED-

validated number of grantees versus those enrolled and/or 

admitted in the University multiplied by the amount of subsidy 

per semester; 

 

c. submit to the Office of the Auditor the budget plan for the use 
of the remaining ASC; 

 

d. immediately settle the unliquidated cash advances with the 
CHED in order to avail of the ASC for the continuing TES 

program; 

 

e. thru the Accountant, (i) draw JEV to record the TES subsidy of 
P1,957,000.00 received on December 17, 2020; (ii) adjust the 

accounts affected to fairly present the same on the FSs; (iii) 

monitor the fund transfers from CHED (Due to NGAs account) 

to properly recognize in the books the receipt of funds as well as 

the disbursement/liquidation from such; and 

 



 

60 
 

f. thru the Head of Scholarship and Grants Office, ensure proper 
coordination with current TES student-grantees as well as the 

population of poor but deserving students for receipt and/or 

application of TES financial benefits with CHED. 

 

4.15 The Management, in consultation with CHED-TES-in-Charge, will release 

the remaining TES subsidy upon the availability of a written directive and 

explanation from the UniFAST representative, clarifying the “retention” 

policies of the student-grantees.  Also, RTU officials concerned in the 

implementation of the TES stated that fund transfers to the University for 

numerous scholarships and grants were delayed, thus deferred benefits to 

the recipients. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

4.16 We would like to emphasize that the Management should: a) follow up the 

needed document from the UniFAST representative; and b) implement 

additional measures to ensure compliance with the CHED rules and 

regulations for the TES grants. 

 

Non-compliance with Rules and Regulations on the Release of the TES-ESGPPA 

Financial Benefits 

 

5. The UniFAST Memorandum Circular (MC) No. 2018-0001 dated March 26, 

2018 was not strictly adhered to by the University,  in view of : a) one-time 

receipt by student grantees of the P4,760,000.00 TES-ESGP-PA benefits for 

AY 2018 – 2019; b) delay by 77 to 604 days as of reporting date  in the release 

of the P1,860,000.00   financial benefits to the intended student beneficiaries, 

thus were denied the use of the funds for their  immediate needs; and c) the 

non-liquidation to CHED as of December 31, 2020 of the P6,665,000.00 fund 

transfers.  Moreover, the fund transfer for AY 2019-2020 in the amount of 

P1,545,000.00 was not recorded in the books at yearend, while P5,644,400.00 

was not posted in the GL and SLs for monitoring.   

 

5.1 The Expanded Student’s Grants-in-Aid Program for Poverty Alleviation 

(ESGP-PA) is an existing joint program of the CHED, DBM, Department 

of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) and the Department of Labor 

and Employment (DOLE).  As stipulated in the CHED-DBM-DSWD-

DOLE Joint Memorandum Circular No. 01 dated June 23, 2016 regarding 

the ESGP-PA program coverage, “the ESGP-PA shall eventually be under 

the umbrella of RA 10687, otherwise known as ‘Unified Student Financial 

Assistance System for Tertiary Education (UNIFAST) Act,’ which covers 

all existing modalities of Student Financial Assistance Programs 



 

61 
 

(StuFAPs) for Tertiary Education and Special Purpose Education 

Assistance in both public and private institutions.” 

 

5.2 Consequently, under both RA No. 10687 and RA No. 10931, the 

continuing ESGP-PA student-grantees are considered included and covered 

by RA No. 10931 through the TES program. 

 

5.3 Item 4.1 of the UniFAST MC No. 2018-0001 dated March 26, 2018 

promulgates the TES grant to ESGP-PA student grantees as follows: 

 

A student-grantee shall be entitled to a maximum of Forty 

Thousand Pesos (P40,000.00) as grant per academic year or 

Twenty Thousand (P20,000.00) as grant per semester.  The grant 

is intended to cover academic and extra-curricular expenses, 

purchase of textbooks, board and lodging, transportation, 

clothing, admission/entrance fees, health and other valid related 

education expenses and support services to complete the student-

grantee’s degree program.

5.4 Stated under 6.4 of MC No. 2018-0001 are the requirements and processes 

for the release of funds by SUCs to students, among which, are: (i) stipends 

due to the beneficiary shall be released by the SUC on a monthly basis 

while (ii) book allowance shall be released on a semestral basis. 

 

5.5 Also discussed in the same MC is the Administrative and Miscellaneous 

Cost (AMC) of three percent for SUCs which shall cover activities such as 

monitoring, office supplies and materials, hiring of project technical staff/s 

or job order, communication, transportation/travel, information technology 



 

62 
 

(IT) equipment, remedial/mentoring program, and 

meetings/orientation/general assembly. 

 

5.6 Review of the documents received by the Office of the Auditor concerning 

TES-ESGP-PA for AYs 2018-2019 and 2019 – 2020 showed that total fund 

transfers from CHED amounted to P7,189,400.00, which was received 

from July 2019 to December 2020.  The amount covered book allowance 

and stipends of P6,980,000.00 and AMC of P209,400.00. 

 

5.7 Of the total educational allowance, the amount of P4,760,000.00 TES-

ESGP-PA benefits for AY 2018 – 2019 had been received one-time by 

student grantees, each receiving the total grant of P40,000.00, contrary to 

Item 6.4 of MC No. 2018-0001 dated March 26, 2018. 

 

5.8 The remaining financial benefits of P360,000.00 and P1,500,000.00 for 

AYs 2018 – 2019 and 2019 – 2020, respectively, totaling P1,860,000.00 

had not been received by the other student-grantees incurring delays of 77 

to 604 days, denying the use of the fund for the immediate needs of the 

student beneficiaries. 

 

5.9 Also, the three percent AMC totaling P209,400.00 was not utilized for the 

same purpose it was intended.  The non-utilization of the AMC affected the 

proper monitoring of the receipts and utilizations of funds since it could 

have been used to employ additional workforce for the Scholarship and 

Grants Office, which remained undermanned with just one contractual 

employee and the Head of the Office.  Moreover, the budget could be used 

to purchase additional IT equipment such as scanners designed for high-

volume management and archiving of documents, as to ensure all 

documentary requirements of TES grantees as well as liquidation reports 

can be kept intact for reporting and future reference. 

 

5.10 Moreover, audit showed that:(a) stipend and AMC for AY 2018 – 2019 in 

the amount of P5,644,400.00 recorded under JEV No. 19-07-0733 dated 

July 31, 2019 was not posted in the GL and SL; and (b) subsidies for the 

first and second semesters of AY 2019 - 2020 in the amount of 

P1,545,000.00 remained unrecorded in the books of accounts.  The 

aforesaid deficiency resulted in the abnormal balance of the Due to NGAs 

account of Fund 164 as at year ended December 31, 2019 and understated 

liabilities of the Agency as at year ended December 31, 2020, contrary to 

Section 7, Chapter 19 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, to wit: 

 

Financial statements shall present fairly the financial position, 

financial performance and cash flows of an entity. Fair 



 

63 
 

presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of 

transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with the 

definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, 

and expenses set out in IPSAS. The application of IPSAS, with 

additional disclosures when necessary, is presumed to result in 

financial statements that achieve a fair presentation. (Par. 27, 

IPSAS 1) 

 

5.11 Further, communication and verification with the CHED disclosed that the 

92.71 percent of total fund transfers for the TES-ESGP-PA financial 

benefits received by the University or P6,665,000.00 remained 

unliquidated, thus not in accordance with UniFAST rules and regulations 

on semestral fund transfer liquidation. 

 

5.12 We recommended that Management: 

 

a. comply with the requirements and processes for the release of 
funds to TES-ESGP-PA beneficiaries, that is, stipends due to 

the beneficiary shall be released by the SUC on a monthly basis 

while book allowance shall be released on a semestral basis in 

accordance with Item 6.4 of UniFAST MC No. 2018-0001 dated 

March 26, 2018; 

 

b. release immediately the remaining financial benefits of 
P1,860,000.00 to the student-grantees; 

 

c. through the Head of Scholarship and Grants Office, plan and 
implement the effective use of the three percent AMC in 

accordance with existing rules and regulations; 

 

d. through the Accountant, (i) prepare JEV to record the fund 
transfer of P1,545,000.00 for TES-ESGP-PA financial benefits 

for AY 2019 – 2020; (ii) monitor the fund transfers for TES-

ESGP-PA to facilitate the accounting and liquidation thereof; 

and  

 

e. settle the unliquidated cash advances with the CHED in 
accordance with UniFAST rules and regulations on semestral 

fund transfer liquidation. 

 

5.13 The Management commented that there will be difficulty complying with 

the scheduled monthly release of the stipend because the TES-ESGP-PA 

funds from CHED had been delayed since 2018.  Also, actions were 



 

64 
 

already taken for the release of the remaining benefits as well as 

compliance with the other audit observations. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

5.14 The Audit Team reminds the RTU officials concerned with the 

implementation of TES-ESGP-PA financial benefits to provide timelines 

and proper monitoring to ensure realization of the objectives of the project. 

 

Deficient Budget Execution, Monitoring and Reporting 

 

6. The Budget Office did not a) maintain the required Registries for monitoring 

of the University budget; and b) comply with the procedures in monitoring and 

recognizing revenue and other receipts, recording of budgetary accounts and 

monitoring budget, utilizations and disbursements charged to Retained 

Income, Revolving Funds and Trust Receipts/Custodial funds, contrary to 

Chapter 3, GAM for NGAs, Volume I. 

 

6.1 Chapter 3 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, prescribes the guidelines in 

monitoring, accounting and reporting of the budget in the FSs.  It also 

prescribes the records to be maintained by the NGAs, forms to be used and 

reports to be prepared to effectively monitor the budget as well as the 

required information disclosure and presentation of budget information in 

the FSs in accordance with IPSAS 24. 

 

6.2 Sections 6, 8, 10 and 18 of the same Manual, enumerate the Registries that 

should be maintained by the Budget Office, as follows: 

 

a. Registries of Revenue and Other Receipts (RROR) (Appendices 7, 7A, 
7B, 7C and 7D); 

b. Registry of Appropriations and Allotments (RAPAL) (Appendix 8); 
c. Registries of Allotments, Obligations and Disbursements (RAOD) 

(Appendices 9A, 9B, 9C, 9D); and 

d. Registries of Budget, Utilization and Disbursements (RBUD) 
(Appendices 10A, 10B, 10C, 10D). 

 

6.3 Review of the procedures of the Budget Office with regard to the 

monitoring and recognizing revenue and other receipts revealed that the 

Estimated Revenue per Approved Budget of the Agency (ERABA) was not 

prepared by Management.  It was also found out that the Offices of the 

Cashier and Accounting did not provide the Budget Office with a copy of 

the Report of Collections and Deposits (RCD) and Tax Remittance Advice 

(TRA), respectively.  The aforesaid documents are the bases in recording 



 

65 
 

the estimated revenue/other receipts/constructive receipts of revenue in the 

RROR.  

 

6.4 The Budget Office does not maintain the RABUD, thus recording and 

monitoring of budget utilizations and disbursements under the STF and 

other trust receipts/custodial funds are inadequate and could not be relied 

upon.  The RBUD, which shall also be prepared by the Budget Office, is 

the Registry used to record approved special budget and corresponding 

utilizations and disbursements charged to retained income under RA No. 

8292 for SUCs and other retained income collection of the agency with 

similar authority, Revolving Funds and Trust Receipts/Custodial Funds. 

 

6.5 Furthermore, based on the RTU processes/procedures in the disbursements 

and obligations of allotments, it was observed that: 

 

a. It has been the practice of the University that the Office requesting 
for the incurrence of an obligation only prepares the supporting 

documents such as Payroll, Contract/Purchase Order (PO) and other 

SDs.  Preparation of ORS/BURS is passed to the Budget Office, 

and the DV to the Accounting Office.  The GAM requires the 

Requesting Office to prepare both the ORS/BURS and DV for the 

obligation requested for budget. 

 

b. The Director of the FSC certifies in Section A of the ORS/BURS, 
the necessity and legality of charges to the budget and validity, 

propriety and legality of SDs. Section 36 (e, f), Chapter 2, of the 

GAM for NGAs, Volume I, discusses that it is the responsibility of 

the Head of the Requesting Office to ensure that the disbursements 

of government funds are legal and in conformity with applicable 

rules and regulations as well as the submission of proper evidence 

to establish validity of the claim.  Accordingly, the Head of the 

Requesting Office shall certify   the necessity and legality of 

charges to allotments under his/her supervision as well as the 

validity, propriety and legality of supporting documents. 

 

c. The Budget Office does not maintain the RAOD, thus proper 
monitoring and prevention of incurrence of obligations in excess of 

allotment and overdraft in disbursements against obligations 

incurred could not be ascertained. 

 

d. The Accounting Office does not prepare Notice of Obligation 
Request and Status Adjustment (NORSA)/Notice of Budget 

Utilization Request and Status Adjustment (NBURSA) which is 

used in adjusting the original amount obligated to the actual 

obligations incurred in the RAOD. 



 

66 
 

 

e. The Cashier/Accounting Office did not provide and submit copies 
of the RCI, RADAI, JEV and NORSA/NBURSA to the Budget 

Office that should serve as bases for posting in Section C of the 

ORS/BURS and recording in the RAOD/RBUD. 

 

6.6 We recommended that the Management: 

 

a. thru the Budget Office: i) prepare and maintain the registries 
enumerated under Sections 6, 8, 10, and 18, Chapter 3, of the 

GAM for NGAs, Volume I; and ii) follow the budget execution, 

monitoring and reporting procedures required of the Office 

discussed in the same Chapter; 

 

b. prepare and submit to this Office the Estimated Revenue per 
Approved Budget of the Agency (ERABA) for CY 2020; 

 

c. thru the Cashier, furnish the Budget Office copies of the:           
i) RCD for proper recording of collections of revenue/other 

receipts/constructive receipts of revenue in the RROR; and ii) 

RCI and RADAI for posting of budget utilizations and 

disbursements in the ORS and RAOD;  

 

d. enforce the procedure on the preparer of the DV, ORS/BURs 
and certifying office, both should be the Head of Requesting 

Office, in Section A of the ORS/BURS the necessity and legality 

of charges to allotments under his/her supervision as well as the 

validity, propriety and legality of supporting documents, as 

provided in Section 36 (e, f), Chapter 2, of the GAM for NGAs, 

Volume I; and  

  

e. thru the Accounting Office, furnish the Budget Office copies of 
the TRA, JEV and NORSA/NBURSA for proper recording and 

posting of budget utilizations, disbursements and adjustment of 

obligations by the University. 
 

6.7 Management commented that the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for 

the budget execution, monitoring and reporting processes will be updated.  

As soon as the updated SOP becomes available, reorientation on the budget 

process for all department heads and concerned offices will be provided to 

ensure compliance with the audit recommendations. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 



 

67 
 

6.8 The Audit Team noted the actions taken by the Management, in 

compliance with some of the audit recommendations.  However, the 

ERABA remained unsubmitted to the Office of the Auditor. 

  

Inadequate Disbursement Procedures implemented by the University 

 

7. The Accounting Office did not observe the proper procedures in the processing 

of disbursements by cash and check as well as the maintenance of accounting 

records, forms and reports, contrary to Chapter 6 of the GAM) for NGAs), 

Volume I, thus reliability and propriety of the recorded transactions are in 

question. 

 

7.1 Chapter 6 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I covers the rules and 

regulations to be followed in the disbursement of public funds, the 

monitoring of receipt and utilization of NCA/NTA, preparation and 

processing of DV/Payroll; preparation and issue of checks; payment by 

cash; granting, utilization and liquidation/replenishment of cash advances; 

payments through Advice to Debit Account (ADA); remittance of taxes 

withheld through Tax Remittance Advice (TRA); availment of foreign 

loans through suppliers’ credit/constructive cash; and payment of operating 

requirements on Foreign Service Posts (FSPs) through Cash Disbursement 

Ceiling (CDC). 

 

7.2 The modes of disbursements presented under the same chapter are: (a) 

checks (MDS or commercial checks), (b) cash (out of cash advance granted 

to authorized Disbursing Officer), (c) advice to debit the account, (d) TRA, 

(e) working Fund/CDC, and (f) direct payment method. 

 

7.3 Section 8, Chapter 6 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, discusses 

disbursements by check. It states that checks shall be drawn only on duly 

approved DV or Payroll.  Also, Sections 9, 10 and 12 provide the 

documentary requirements; accounting books, records, forms and reports to 

be prepared and maintained; and procedures for expenditures through 

checks, respectively.  Moreover, disbursement through List of Due and 

Demandable Accounts Payable-ADA (LDDAP-ADA) under Section 50 

thereof, is a mode of settlement of accounts payable due the 

creditors/payees of all NGAs and their Operating Units (OUs) prescribed 

under Department of Budget and Management (DBM) Circular Letter No. 

2013-16 dated December 23, 2013, which implemented the Expanded 

Modified Direct Payment Scheme (ExMDPS), amended by DBM Circular 

Letter Nos. 2013-16A and 2013-16B dated February 6, 2014 and February 

25, 2014, respectively. 

 



 

68 
 

7.4 Review of the processes implemented by the University in disbursing by 

checks (MDS or commercial checks) and LDDAP-ADAs disclosed the 

following: 

 

a. The DV is prepared in three copies only instead of four, thus does 

not conform with Appendix 32 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume II; 

 

b. The last posting in the Index of Payments is as of CY 2018, thus 

the risks of double/over payment is high; 

 

c. The Registry of Allotments and Notice of Cash Allocation 

(RANCA) and Registry of Allotments and Notice of Transfer of 

Allocation (RANTA) are not prepared to determine availability 

and sufficiency of the NCA; 

 

d. The Accounting Office submits the JEVs for check disbursements 

to the Audit Team without the original copy of the paid 

DVs/payroll, copy of the validated LDDAP-ADAs/check and 

supporting documents (SDs). 

 

e. The Internal Audit Services (IAS) performs the (a) review of 

claims for disbursement amounting to P100,000.00 and above, (b) 

pre-audit of vouchers, a primary responsibility of the Accounting 

Office, c) counter-signing on the DVs for the Head of the Agency 

of IAS Director, which are not in accordance with the functions of 

the IAS, thereby affecting the effective discharge of its mandated 

function.   

 

7.5 Section 1.1 of AO No. 278, s.1992 states that: “The Internal Audit Service 

(IAS) shall be an integral part of the office/organization and shall assist the 

institution management in the effective discharge of its responsibilities 

insofar as the same would not encroach on or be adversarial with those of 

the auditors of the Commission on Audit. It shall function in accordance 

with the policies established by the provisions of RA No. 3456, as amended 

by RA No. 4177, and shall perform staff functions with primary 

responsibilities encompassing the examination and evaluation of the 

adequacy and effectiveness of internal control and the quality of 

performance.”  

 

7.6 In addition to the above duties, the same AO stated that IAS shall not be 

responsible for or required to participate in procedures which are 

essentially a part of regular operating activities or in operations which are 

the primary responsibility of another unit in the organization. The IAS shall 



 

69 
 

be detached from all functions of routine operating character, such as the 

following: 

 

• Pre-audit of vouchers and counter-signature of checks; 

• Inspection of deliveries, although the internal auditor may, as part of 
his examination, observe inspection; 

Preparation of treasury and bank reconciliation statements; 

• Development and installation of systems and procedures; however, 
in exceptional cases, the internal auditor may assist by way of giving 

suggestions; 

• Taking physical inventories; however, the internal auditor may 
review the plans in advance and observe and test-check the accuracy 

of counting, costing and summarizing; 

• Maintaining property records; and 

• All other activities related to operations. 
 

7.7 We recommended, and the Management agreed, to: 

  

a. implement the correct procedures in the preparation and 
processing of DVs, that is, the requesting office/unit shall 

prepare the DV in four copies; 

 

b. thru the Accounting Office, (i) maintain updated Index of 
Payments for proper monitoring of payments made to each 

creditor/payee to avoid over/double payment; (ii) prepare and 

maintain the RANCA and RANTA to ensure availability and 

sufficiency of NCA; and (iii) submit to the Office of the Auditor 

the JEV for check disbursements with complete supporting 

documents; and  

 

c. transfer the pre-audit function of financial transactions from 
the IAS to the Accounting Office.  

 

Non-submission of Documents to Support the Payment of Tax Amnesty 

 

8. The payment made to the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) for tax amnesty 

amounting to P10.448 million, as a result of a tax investigation for the taxable 

period January 1 to December 31, 2015, lacked the documentary requirements 

required in BIR Revenue Regulations No. 4-2019 dated April 5, 2019, hence 

the validity cannot be ascertained.  Further, disbursement for the transaction 

was taken from Fund 164, of which utilization of said fund has limitation. 

 

8.1 Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 4-2019 dated April 5, 2019 prescribed the 

implementing Rules and Regulations of Republic Act No. 71213, 



 

70 
 

Otherwise known as the "Tax Amnesty Act", Providing for the Guidelines 

on the Processing of Tax Amnesty Application on Tax Delinquencies. 

 

8.2 Section 2 of the RR defines delinquent accounts as tax due from a taxpayer 

arising from the audit of the BIR which had been issued Assessment 

Notices that have become final and executory due to the following 

instances: 

 

a. Failure to pay the tax due on the prescribed due date provided in the 

Final Assessment Notice (FAN) Formal Letter of Demand (FLD) 

and for which no valid Protest, whether a request for reconsideration 

or reinvestigation, has been filed within 30 days from receipt thereof;  

 

b. Failure to file an appeal to the Court of Tax Appeal (CTA) or an 

administrative appeal before the Commissioner of Internal Revenue 

(CIR) within 30 days from receipt of the decision denying the 

request for reinvestigation or reconsideration; or 

 

c. Failure to file an appeal to the CTA within 30 days from receipt of 

the Decision of the CIR denying the taxpayer's administrative appeal 

to the Final Decision on Disputed Assessment (FDDA). 

 

8.3 Also, Section 3 of the RR prescribes who can avail of the tax amnesty, 

which includes all persons, whether natural or juridical, with internal 

revenue tax liabilities covering taxable year 2017 and prior year.  

Delinquent accounts explicitly include delinquent withholding tax 

liabilities arising from non-withholding of tax and Withholding Tax 

liabilities of withholding agents arising from their failure to remit withheld 

taxes. 

 

8.4 In order to avail of the amnesty tax, the following documentary 

requirements must be submitted: 

 

a. Tax Amnesty Return (TAR) (BIR Form No.2118-DA, Annex "A"), 

completely and accurately accomplished and made under oath;  

b. Acceptance Payment Form (APF) (BIR Form No. 0621-DA, Annex 

"B") duly validated by the Authorized Agent Banks (AABs) or APF 

duly stamped "received" with accompanying bank deposit slip duly 

validated by the concerned AABs or Revenue Official Receipt 

(ROR) issued by the Revenue Collection Officers (RCOs);  

c. Certificate of Tax Delinquencies/Tax Liabilities issued by 

concerned BIR offices (Annex "c"); and  



 

71 
 

d. In case of applications under Section 3(AX2) of these Regulations, 

a copy of the assessment found in the FAN/FDDA: Provided that, 

in cases of applications under Section 3(D), either delinquent 

account or not, with or without FAN/FDDA, the Preliminary 

Assessment Notice (PAN)/ Notice for Informal Conference or 

equivalent document is sufficient. 

 

8.5 On October 23, 2019, the RTU availed of the tax amnesty and had paid 

P10.448 million.  Audit conducted on the payment of the tax amnesty 

approved under DV No. 19-10-1985 dated October 22, 2019, paid under 

Check No. 227466 dated October 23, 2019 and recorded under JEV No. 

19-10-1129 dated October 23, 2019, disclosed that it was charged to Fund 

164 and was supported by the following: 

 

a. Original BIR Certificate of Tax Delinquencies/Tax Liabilities 

issued October 17, 2019, and signed by RR7B-East NCR Collection 

Division Chief;  

 

b. Copy of Letter from the University President to the Revenue 

Officer of BIR Collection Division with subject Request to avail 

Tax Amnesty under RA No. 11213 Assessment No. 041-2018-

8056-15 for 2015 dated December 17, 2018;  

 

c. Copy of Letter of Indorsement from the University President to the 

University Chief Legal Counsel a certain Board Resolution No. 

936;  

 

d. Copy of the Secretary’s Certificate of the Resolution No. 936 

attested by the University President; and  

 

e. Copies of identification cards of the University President and the 

University Chief Legal Counsel. 

 

8.6 From the foregoing, it can be gleaned that only requirement letter c of RR 

4-2019 (Original BIR Certificate of Tax Delinquencies/Tax Liabilities 

issued October 17, 2019, and signed by RR7B-East NCR Collection 

Division Chief) was presented to the Audit Team. All other three basic 

requirements were not presented although it was alleged to have been with 

the Office of the Accountant. 

 

8.7 Moreover, the Management failed to present the following documentary 

requirements, which are necessary to ascertain that the examination made 



 

72 
 

by BIR examiners and the payment made by RTU are proper and with 

basis: 

  

Documents Relevance 

1. Letter of Authority (LOA) of 
the RO 

Authorizes the BIR examiner to audit the 

University’s books of accounts and other 

accounting records. 

 

2. Notice of Initial Conference 
(NIC) inviting the RTU to 

explain the tax deficiencies 

found 

It is to invite the taxpayer for a conference 

within 30 days from the receipt of the NIC.  

The conference will allow the taxpayer to 

present and explain its side to the BIR. 

 

3. Preliminary Assessment 
Notice (PAN) with the 

computation of the 

deficiency tax, as well as the 

facts on which the proposed 

deficiency is based 

The PAN is issued when the taxpayer and 

the BIR fail to resolve the issues during the 

informal conference stage. 

 

The taxpayer may reply in writing within 

15 days of receipt. 

 

4. Formal Letter of Demand 
(FAN/FLD) 

Within another 15 days from the 

taxpayer’s reply to the PAN, the BIR shall 

issue a Final Assessment Notice and a 

FLD/FAN. 

 

5. Protest and or responses sent 
to the Bureau duly received 

by authorized personnel 

To prove that the RTU had contested the 

assessment done by the BIR. 

 

Use of Fund 164 to pay the Amnesty Tax 

 

8.8 Section 4(d) of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 8292, the Higher Education 

Modernization Act of 1997, authorized SUCs to deposit in any AGDB and 

treat as Special Trust Funds (STF), income from tuition fees and other 

necessary school charges, such as; matriculation fees, graduation fees, and 

laboratory fees. The law further authorized the Board of Regents/Trustees 

(BOR/T) of SUCs to disburse such income and other charges, as well as 

those generated from the operation of auxiliary services and land grants, for 

instruction, research, extension or other programs/projects of the university 

or college. Such disbursements require a special budget duly approved only 

by the BOR/T which is now empowered by R.A. No. 8292 to appropriate 

the income of the university/college and allocate funds with flexibility. 

 

8.9 The charging of the payment of amnesty tax to STF is not among the 

purpose for which such fund was created. Hence, we disagree with the 



 

73 
 

statement of the Vice President for Academic Affairs who signed and 

approved the payment ensures that the charging for the payment of tax 

amnesty to Fund 164, is legal and in conformity with applicable rules and 

regulations. 

 

8.10 We recommended that Management: 

 

a. submit the lacking documentary requirements enumerated 

under paragraphs 8.5 hereof (b-e) and 8.7 to support the 

validity of the disbursement; and 

 

b. through the VPAA, furnish this Office with the explanation why 

the payment was charged to Fund 164. 

 

8.11 The University Accountant claimed that the tax assessment is not in 

consonance with existing revenue guidelines and the lapse of the prescribed 

period, which necessitates the payment of the tax amnesty, is through no 

fault of the accountable official/s. 

 

8.12 Management commented that the audited BIR assessment happened 

months before the oath taking of the now President of the University and 

the documentation for the transaction and events were with the then 

University Accountant which were not turned over to the Finance Director 

and/or to the current Accountant.  The payment of the tax amnesty for the 

tax deficiencies assessed and demanded for payment by the BIR is in 

response to the: (i) FLD received; (ii) lapsed opportunity to protest the tax 

assessment through no fault of the RTU officials; and (iii) receipt of a copy 

of a Warrant of Garnishment and a letter informing the University of the 

standing of its bank accounts from the Landbank of the Philippines (LBP).  

For this, the RTU officials requested that they be given ample time to 

complete the lacking documentary requirements, and seek the assistance 

and guidance of the Commission, to handle the transaction i.e., the Fund 

used and the necessary action to correct, if any, the procedures made in 

response with the Warrant of Garnishment received by the University from 

the LBP. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

8.13 Assuming arguendo that the tax assessment is not in consonance with 

existing revenue guidelines, the Accountant could have advised the 

Management to file a protest before the period had lapsed.  We also 

disagree that the Management cannot be faulted because there is always a 

need to delegate or immediately assign staff in instances where responsible 



 

74 
 

officials entrusted with responsibilities, becomes ill or had been absent for 

quite a time.  These inactions caused the RTU P10.448 million, which 

could have been used to finance projects that will enhance the operations of 

the University. 

 

Deficiencies in the Grants and Liquidation of Cash Advances 

 

9. Non-compliance with Section 14, Chapter 6 of the  GAM for  NGAs, Volume I 

and COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 was observed in the 

following: a) Petty Cash and advances for operational expenses  were  

deposited in the personal account of the Cashier/accountable officer (AO)  

instead of keeping the same in a safety vault; b) six AOs  without or with 

expired Fidelity Bonds were granted cash advances in the total amount of 

P7,557,448.57; c) the Report of Cash Disbursements (RCDisb) and Cash 

Disbursements Record (CDRec) were not prepared/maintained; and d) 

liquidation and refund by the Head Cashier  of unused cash advances in the 

amount of P8,807,508.69 and P1,905,095.29, respectively, were delayed ranging 

from four to 165 days.  

 

9.1 Section 14, Chapter 6 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, provides, among 

others, that: 

 

a. A cash advance shall be reported on and liquidated as soon as the 
purpose for which it was given has been served; and 

 

b. Except for cash advance for official travel, no officer or employee 
shall be granted cash advance unless he/she is properly bonded in 

accordance with existing laws or regulations. The amount of cash 

advance which may be granted shall not exceed the maximum cash 

accountability covered by his/her bond; 

 

9.2 As discussed in Item 1.2 of the Revised Documentary Requirements for 

Common Government Transactions prescribed under COA Circular No. 

2012-001 dated June 14, 2012, the following cash advances shall be 

liquidated as follows: 

 

• Salaries, Wages, Allowances, Honoraria and Other Similar Payments – 
within five calendar days after the end of the pay period 

• Field Operating Expenses – within 20 calendar days after the end of 
the year subject to replenishment as frequently as necessary during the 

year 

• Petty Cash Fund (PCF) – as soon as the disbursement reaches 75 
percent or as needed, the PCF shall be replenished which shall equal to 

the total amount of expenditures made therefrom.  In case of 



 

75 
 

termination, resignation, retirement or dismissal of the PCF custodian, 

immediately thereafter. 

• Special Purpose – as soon as the purpose of the cash advance has been 
served. 

 

9.3 Examination of the procedures implemented by the University for 

disbursements out of advances showed breakdown in internal controls, 

exposing the funds to the risk of loss or misuse, such as: 

 

a. Advances for Petty Cash/operational expenses to the Disbursing 
Officers (DOs) were not kept in safety vaults but deposited in the 

personal accounts of the DOs, which were occasionally withdrawn 

only when needed.   

 

b. 21 out of 39 or 54 percent of the cash advances for payroll and time-
bound/specific purpose granted to officers and employees for the 

months of January to October 2020 amounting to P7,557,448.57 

were not covered by Fidelity Bonds.  Details are presented in the 

table below:

c. Three AOs were issued cash advances without Fidelity Bonds 
totaling P122,194.00 while cash advances amounting to 

P7,435,254.57 were given to three AOs with expired Fidelity bonds, 

exposing the Agency to the risk of not being indemnified or 

compensated in case of loss through theft or misappropriation to the 

disadvantage of the government, contrary to Section 314 of the 

Public Bonding Law (PBL) of Republic Act No. 2711 and Treasury 

Circular No. 02-2009,  as follows:

d. The AOs/Special Disbursing Officers (SDOs) did not 
prepare/maintain the required Report of Cash Disbursements 

(RCDisb) and Cash Disbursements Record (CDRec), consequently, 

monitoring and control in the grants and utilization of cash advances 

are insufficient. 

 

e. The liquidation of cash advances for special purpose and Payroll, 
and return of unused cash advances by the Head Cashier showed 

delays ranging from four to 165 days and seven to 165 days, 

respectively. 

 

9.4 We recommended, and the Management agreed, to: 

 

a. provide safety vaults to DOs handling Petty Cash/cash advance 
for operational expenses and refrain from depositing 

government funds to the AO’s personal account to safeguard 

government funds against loss/misappropriation; 

 

b. make sure that all designated AOs have Fidelity Bonds and, 
through the Head Cashier, provide the Audit Team with copies 

of approved Fidelity Bonds as reference in audit; and 

 

c. through the DOs, (i) comply within the prescribed period, 
liquidation and return of unused cash advances; and (ii) 

prepare and maintain the RCDisb and CDRec for appropriate 

monitoring and control of grants and utilizations of cash 

advances. 

 

Incurrence of unnecessary expenses 

 

10. RTU incurred unnecessary expenses of P249,391.49 from the total expended 

amount of P1,138,000.00 for transportation and accommodation with meals 



 

77 
 

during the Staff Development Program – Phase 2 on December 19-20, 2019 at 

Canyon Woods Resort, Batangas due to non-attendance of 22 percent or 103 

employees out of 470 estimated number of participants. Moreover, the DV 

lacked documentary requirements to further determine the propriety of 

disbursement. 

 

10.1 Under Office Order No. 2209 s. 2019 dated December 12, 2019, issued by 

Dr. Ma. Eugenia Yangco, RTU University President, regular employees 

including permanent and temporary, and contractual employees who have 

been assigned to various committees are enjoined to participate in the 2019 

RTU Staff Development Program – Phase 2 and Christmas Party on 

December 19-20, 2019 at the Canyon Woods Resort, Laurel, Batangas. 

 

10.2 The Office Order did not specify the specific personnel included in the 

Staff Development Program – Phase II as it generalizes regular (permanent 

or temporary) and contractual employees (with assigned committee). 

 

10.3 The 2019 Staff Development Program – Phase 2, based on the proposal 

letter and training program submitted, is a continuation of the 1st Phase 

with the theme RTU@50: Raising the Banner Gold and Blue which was 

concentrated on Work-Life integration.  Also, the event was used as an 

avenue to appreciate and thank RTU administrative and faculty personnel's 

inputs and contributions to the continued success of the organization and its 

future endeavors.  Objectives of the training conducted are enumerated as 

follows: 

 

• Helping employees to integrate work and life; 

• Promoting a healthy workplace that encourages employees to feel 

good about life; 

• Establishing habits and activities that could help employees 

alleviate stress and burn-out; and 

• Providing practical tips on how to meet deadlines without 

compromising employees’ welfare. 

 

10.4 For CY 2019, the Annual Procurement Plan (APP) includes Employees and 

Seminar Trainings in December, with the budgeted amount of P5,000,000.  

The Board Resolution approving the APP for CY 2019 remains 

unsubmitted to the Audit Team despite repeated requests.  

 

10.5 RTU is composed of 437 regular, 220 part-time, and 123 contractual 

employees totaling of 780 employees as of December 2019.  Technical 

Proposal for the said program estimates 470 participants, upon verification 



 

78 
 

of the actual attendance sheet, attendees were only 78 percent thereof or 

367, composed of:

10.7 As a result, RTU incurred unnecessary expenses of P249,391.49 equivalent 

to the amount expended for the 103 non-attending employees.  The actual 

expenses per participant exceeded the estimated budget per participant due 

to non-attendance of the 22 percent expected participants or 103 

employees.  

 

10.8 As defined in COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012, 

unnecessary expenditure refers to expenditures which could not pass the 

test of prudence or the diligence of a good father of a family, thereby 

denoting non-responsiveness to the exigencies of the service. Unnecessary 

expenditures are those not supportive of the implementation of the 

objectives and mission of the agency relative to the nature of its operation.  



 

79 
 

 

10.9 Further documentary and procedural deficiencies in the procurements of 

services thru Small Value Procurement were observed, such as: 

 

a. Delays from 35 to 48 days in the submission to the Audit Team of 

required documents for contract review, contrary to COA Circular 

2009-001 dated February 12, 2009 which prescribes the submission 

within five working days from the execution of a contract; 

 

b. Lacking documents to support the disbursements: 

 

i. Proof of posting of invitation or request for submission of 

price quotation in the PhilGEPS website, website of the 

procuring agency and any conspicuous place; 

ii. Letter/invitation to submit proposals

10.10 We recommended that Management submit the following as basis in 

rendering a decision in audit: 

 

a. valid justification for the incurrence of unnecessary expenses 
for the 103 non-participating personnel and private individuals; 

 

b. verifiable output from the Staff Development Program 
conducted; 

 

c. the list of actual hotel registration of the participants, certified 
by the venue owner/representative; and 

 

d. lacking documentary requirements as enumerated in 
paragraph 10.9 (b). 

 

Deficiencies in the Purchase of Transport Materials  

 

11. The purchase of transport materials for the repairs and maintenance was paid 

in the absence of the required documents per COA Circular No. 2012-001, 

without any deduction for liquidated damages corresponding to delay of 66 

days in the delivery of goods and was set up as Accounts Payable even before 

their delivery.  



 

81 
 

  

11.1 The Fundamental Principles governing the financial transactions of the 

government require, among others, that all claims against government 

funds shall be supported with complete documentation; and all laws and 

regulations applicable to financial transactions shall be faithfully adhered 

to. 

 

11.2 Audit of the said   claim revealed that it was supported by Purchase Order 

No. SPO-PO-2019-11-034 dated November 7, 2019, received by the 

Supplier on November 15, 2019 and Delivery Receipt No. 2050 dated 

January 22, 2020, noted as inspected and accepted dated January 24 and 28, 

2020, respectively. 

 

11.3 The DV was processed and paid even with deficiencies on the documents 

required to support the repair and maintenance of the vehicle: 

 

a. Pre-repair inspection stating the list of part/s to be replaced and the 

extent of work to be performed; 

b. Warranty Certificate stating the period of warranty of the items 

delivered; and 

c. The attached APP does not bear the approval of the Head of the 

Procuring Entity; 

d. Report of Waste Materials stating the manner of disposal of the 

waste materials to be submitted to the Auditor within 24 hours from 

date of inspection and acceptance by Management; and 

e. The Request for Quotation was not signed by the BAC Chairperson 

 

11.4 It was also found out that delay was incurred by the Supplier in fulfilling its 

obligation to deliver the procured goods.  The PO was received by the 

Supplier on November 15, 2019 and the delivery shall be made within 15 

days from the date of receipt of PO/contract by the Supplier.  Delivery was 

made on January 22, 2020, which was 66 days delayed.  Despite the 

provision of   liquidated damages of 1/10 of 1 percent for every day of 

delay in the PO, still the Supplier was paid the entire claim without 

deduction for liquidated damages. 

 

11.5 It was further revealed that JEV No. 19-12-1517 dated December 27, 2019 

was drawn to set up the liability account, when there was no valid 

obligation yet as there was no delivery made during that time.  The setting 

up of Accounts Payable should only be made when goods or services have 

been delivered/rendered/completed and accepted by Management. 

 

 



 

82 
 

11.6 Section 2, Chapter 6 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, defines Accounts 

Payable as valid and legal obligation of NGAs/OUs, where 

goods/services/projects have been delivered/rendered/completed and 

accepted regardless of the year when these obligations were incurred. 

 

11.7 We recommended that Management, to preclude the issuance of Notice 

of Suspension/Disallowance: 

 

a. submit the required documents as enumerated in paragraph 
11.3 within five days from receipt; and 

 

b. require the Supplier to pay for the liquidated damages for the 
delayed delivery of the items procured.  

 

Non-submission of Procurement Monitoring Reports 

 

12. The Procurement Monitoring Report (PMR) for CYs 2019 and 2020 required 

under Sections 11 and 12 of the 2016 Revised Implementing Rules and 

Regulations (IRR) of Republic Act No. 9184, approved by the Head of the 

Procuring Entity (HoPE) and with proof of submission to the GPPB pursuant 

to GPPB Circular No. 03-2015 dated March 20, 2015, and Section 12.2 of the 

2016 Revised IRR of RA No. 9184, were not submitted, thus monitoring of 

project implementations was not done. 

 

12.1 Section 11.1.1 of the 2016 Revised IRR of RA No. 9184 provides that, 

“each Procuring Entity shall establish in its head office a single Bids and 

Awards Committee (BAC) to undertake the functions specified in Section 

12 of this IRR in order to facilitate professionalism and harmonization of 

procedures and standards.” 

 

12.2 Also, Section 12.2 of the same law requires that: 

 

The BAC shall be responsible for ensuring that the Procuring 

entity abides by the standards set forth by the Act and its IRR 

and it shall prepare a Procurement Monitoring Report (PMR) 

in the form prescribed by the Government Procurement 

Policy Board (GPPB).  The PMR shall cover all procurement 

activities specified in the Annual Procurement Plan (APP) 

whether ongoing or completed, from the holding of the pre-

procurement conference to the issuance of Notice of Award 

and the approval of the contract including the standard and 

actual time for each major procurement activity.  The PMR 

shall be approved and submitted by the HoPE to the GPPB in 

printed and electronic format within fourteen (14) calendar 



 

83 
 

days after the end of each semester.  The PMR shall likewise 

be posted in accordance with E.O. 662, series of 2007, as 

amended. 

 

12.3 Verification of records revealed that the BAC did not submit to COA the 

required PMR for CYs 2019 and 2020. 

 

12.4 Further review of the ongoing and completed major projects of the 

University revealed that there are projects which were already awarded and 

had been started in CY 2020 but have not yet been completed as of this 

date.  There are also projects started three years ago but have not been 

completed as of this date. No action was taken by Management to rescind 

the contracts and require the contractor to pay liquidated damages. This 

should have been monitored had the BAC prepared and submitted the said 

report to COA. 

 

12.5 PMR is a tool which enhances the transparency of the procurement process 

that covers major activities from the holding of pre-procurement to the 

issuance of Notice of Award of the contract, approval of the contract, 

delivery/completion and acceptance/turnover, including the standard and 

actual time for each major procurement activity.  Failure to prepare said 

report as well as delays in its submission defeat its purpose. 

 

12.6 We recommended that Management thru the BAC, furnish the Office 

of the Auditor with the PMR for CYs 2019 and 2020, duly approved by 

the HoPE with proof of submission to the GPPB pursuant to GPPB 

Circular No. 03-2015 dated March 20, 2015 and Section 12.2 of the 

2016 Revised IRR of RA No. 9184.

represents five percent of the total budget of the RTU, various 

programs/targets of the University were met, others were cancelled due to the 

cancellation of classes brought about by the pandemic, but COVID-19 

response activities were initiated to support and undertake urgent needs of its 

clients, employees, students and stakeholders, with end in view of promoting 

gender equality and women’s empowerment. As the GAD activities were 

conducted via Zoom/Webinars, only P43,840.00 was spent, out of the total 

GAD budget.

13.1 Joint Circular No. 2004-1 of the DBM-, NEDA and the National 

Commission on the Role of Filipino Women ((NCRFW), now the 

Philippine Commission on Women (PCW), provides that at least 5 percent 

of the total agency’s budget authorized under the annual GAA shall be set 

to support GAD plans and projects, and shall be integrated in the regular 

activities of the agencies. 

 

13.2 PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-001 provides for the 

preparation of the Annual GAD plan to implement the Magna Carta for 

Women. As provided in the guidelines, one of the essential elements to 

enable agencies to effectively plan and implement their programs on GAD 

is the regular conduct of trainings, capacity building, orientation of agency 

personnel to have a wider appreciation of GAD programs and projects 

related to women empowerment and related laws, rules and regulations. 

 

13.3 For CY 2020, the University allocated a total GAD budget of 

P19,925,000.00 or equivalent to five percent of the total budget under the 

CY 2020 General Appropriations Act, of which P43,840.00 was spent for 

GAD programs, activities and projects during the year. 

 

13.4 Due to the onslaught of COVID-19 and notwithstanding its threat to 

people, the University’s organizational-focused GAD activities as well as 

client-focused activities were conducted to enhance awareness of its 

personnel and students by conducting trainings, seminar via Zoom, 

webinars only, thus the minimal amount spent from the said funds. 

 

13.5 According to the GAD Focal Person, had it not for the pandemic, most of 

their programmed activities were already in place specially that, for the 

first time it was submitted and approved by the PCW. 

 

13.6 We recommended Management to continue its active role in attaining 

GAD responsive programs, activities and projects in support to the 

government’s commitment to empower women and promote gender 

equality. 

 

Senior Citizens and Differently-Abled Persons 

 

14. To respond to the needs of the senior citizens and differently-abled persons, the 

University abided by the recommendation of the Audit Team in last year’s 

audit observation to construct or enhance special lanes for differently-abled 

persons and catwalks for senior citizens for their convenience and safety. 

 

Remittances to GSIS, BIR, PhilHealth and Pag-IBIG Fund 



 

85 
 

 

15. For CY 2020, RTU has faithfully deducted from the salaries of its personnel 

the required taxes and premiums and remitted the same as well as the 

government share within the prescribed period to the concerned institutions or 

agencies as provided under pertinent rules and regulations. Ending balances of 

Due to BIR and Due to PhilHealth were found with discrepancies of 

P8,563,576.64 and P907.18, respectively, requiring further analysis and 

reconciliation by the Accounting Office. 

 

15.1 Below is the status of compliance by RTU on pertinent rules and 

regulations on withholding and remittances of deductions to concerned 

government agencies.

from prior years in the amount P8,378,201.77, 

contrary to the stated balance of P5,843,660.03

be remitted in January 2021 

 

However, review of the GL of Due to

in the FS is P468,815.56, resulted in a 

difference   of P907.18, thus overstating the 

said account by the same amount.

15.2 We recommended that Management require the Accountant to 

reconcile the difference in the data pertaining to the deductions in 

favor of BIR and PhilHealth and draw a JEV, if warranted. 

 

Status of Audit Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges 

  

16. The total audit suspensions and disallowances amounting to P5,867,944.75 and 

P111,508,113.25, respectively, remained unsettled as of December 31, 2020.  

The mode of settlements of disallowances thru installment basis, which from 

September 2015 to December 31, 2020 amounted to P2,248,116.78 has no 

approval from the Commission on Audit, contrary to COA Resolution No. 

2015-031 dated August 20, 2015.  Moreover, disallowances deemed final and 

executory amounting to P9,417,533.35 remained unsettled for a period of nine 

to 11 years, thus depriving the government the use of this fund for other 

priority projects. 



 

87 
 

 

16.1 Section 7.1.1 of COA Circular 2009-006 prescribing the Rules and 

Regulations on Settlement of Accounts (RRSA) provides, among others, 

that:

16.2 As of December 31, 2020, unsettled audit suspensions and disallowances 

amounted to P5,867,944.75 and P111,508,113.25 respectively.  

Transactions suspended in audit were disbursements for repair, renovation 

and construction projects due to lacking supporting papers and for issuance 

of Notice of Disallowance (ND) and/or Notice of Settlement of

16.4 Of the NFDs issued in years 2009 and 2011 in the amount of 

P5,947,509.25 and P8,418,620.34, respectively, only P4,928,112.08 was 

refunded. (See Table 4) The presence of unsettled disallowances amounting 

to P9,417,533.35, dating back to 2009 and 2010 with nine to 11 years of 

delay, indicated lapses by the Management on the required enforcement 

and monitoring of all final and executory decisions issued by the 

Commission. 

 

16.5 COA Resolution No. 2015-031 dated August 20, 2015 promulgated the 

policy guidelines on all requests to pay audit disallowances on installment 

basis, to wit: 

 

• Only disallowed salaries and personal benefits, allowances, 
or emoluments may be allowed to be settled by installments. 

 

• The maximum number of monthly installment payments 
shall be in accordance with the following schedule: 

 

Table 23. Schedule for Maximum Number of Monthly 

Installment Payments 

Amount of Disallowance 

Maximum Number 

of Monthly 

Installment 

Payments 

Not exceeding P1,000.00 Three (3) 

Above P1,000.00 up to P10,000.00 Six (6) 

Above P10,000.00 up to P20,000.00 Twelve (12) 

Above P20,000.00 up to P40,000.00 Eighteen (18) 

Above P40,000.00 Twenty-four (24) 

 

• The monthly payment shall be deducted from the salary of 
the person liable, subject to the minimum take-home pay 

requirement under the General Appropriations Act.  Any 

deficiency in the installment payment for a given month 

after effecting the salary deduction shall be paid directly by 

the person liable to the agency cashier within five (5) days 

after the due date of the installment payment. 

 

• In case the person liable retires, resigns, or is otherwise 
separated from the service before the disallowance is settled 

in full, the person liable may execute an undertaking 

authorizing the application of his remaining salary, accrued 

leave credits, and other separation benefits to satisfy the 

deficiency.  Any unsettled balance after all such salaries and 

benefits have been applied shall be paid by the person liable 



 

91 
 

directly to the agency cashier within fifteen (15) days from 

the date of receipt of notice/demand from the accountant or 

concerned officer. 

 

• All requests for installment payments shall be acted upon by 
the Director of the Prosecution and Litigation Office, and 

subject to review by the Assistant Commissioner of the 

Legal Services Sector (LSS), in accordance with the above 

schedule. 

 

16.6 Review of the DVs, ORs, and JEVs submitted to the Audit Team, 

pertaining to the remittances to   the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) from 

years 2010 to 2020, showed that settlements made for disallowances 

deemed final and executory totaled P4,928,112.08.  Of this amount, 

settlements/ remittances to the BTr from September 2015 to December 

2020 totaling P2,248,116.78 were made in installment without complying 

with COA Resolution No. 2015-031 dated August 20, 2015, summarized in 

the following table: 

 

Table 24. Summary of Settlement of Disallowances thru 

Installment Basis  

Year Reported Number of Payments 
 Amount  

(In PhP)  

2015 11 299,307.32 

2016 18 460,564.74 

2017 22 514,085.82 

2018 15 327,971.03 

2019 16 388,641.08 

2020 13 257,546.79 

Total  2,248,116.78 

 

16.7 Settlement of disallowed salaries and personal benefits, allowances or 

emoluments may be allowed to be settled by installment only if approved 

by the COA through the Prosecution and Litigation Office of the Legal 

Services Sector.  The Management did not present proof that a request for 

installment payment of disallowances was made and/or approved by the 

COA, thus the process implemented by the University in the settlement of 

disallowances was not in accordance with the abovementioned COA 

regulation. 

 

16.8 Also, actions taken by previous and current Managements on the 

enforcement and monitoring of disallowances deemed final and executory 

showed non-compliance with the RRSA: 

 



 

92 
 

a. Through the issuance of Memorandum No. 1, series of 2010 dated 
January 12, 2010 the then RTU President, among others, 

encouraged all officials and employees who received the amount 

disallowed and covered by the NFD or ND the voluntary 

compliance with the dispositive portion of the NFD, which states 

that: 

 

 Accordingly, the above persons liable shall pay the 

above amount immediately to the agency cashier.  

Failure to pay the same shall authorize the agency 

cashier to withhold payment of salary and other 

money due to persons liable in accordance with COA 

Order of Execution to be issued to the agency cashier. 

 

b. Withholding of the amount opted by the concerned officials and 
employees as a monthly deduction from their respective salaries, 

and remittances of the same to the BTr since January 2010 up to 

the present. 

 

15.8 We recommended that Management: 

 

a. prepare a request for the settlement of audit disallowances on an 
installment basis based on the schedule to be prepared by the 

Accounting Office, and submit the request to the Prosecution and 

Litigation Office of the Legal Services Sector of the COA for 

approval; and 

 

b. observe the procedures in the settlement of disallowances, as 
provided in the RRSA and the aforesaid COA Resolution.
