EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 

A. Introduction 
 

 The College of Rizal and the Rizal Technical High School were merged and 

converted into the Rizal Technological College (RTC) by virtue of PD No. 674 on 

March 20, 1975.  This was later amended by PD No. 751 on July 25, 1975, which 

empowered the MERALCO Foundation and the Province of Rizal to jointly sponsor 

and operate the College.  To ensure financing, this was further amended by PD No. 

1341-A on April 1, 1978, converting the RTC into a State College. 

 

 After 19 years and with the passage of Republic Act (RA) No. 8365, the College 

was converted into RTU on October 11, 1997. The University is tasked to provide 

highly professional, scientific, technological and special instructions in the fields of 

engineering and technology, education, business and entrepreneurial technology, and 

arts and sciences and to the promotion of research, extension and advance studies in its

D. Scope of Audit 
 

 The audit covered the review of the accounts and operations of the RTU for the 

year ended December 31, 2020.  The audit was conducted to: (a) ascertain the level of 

assurance that may be placed on management’s assertions on the financial statements; 

(b) determine the propriety of the transactions as well as the extent of compliance with 

applicable laws, rules and regulations; and (c) to determine the extent of 

implementation of prior years’ audit recommendations. 

  

E. Independent Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements 
 

 The Auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the 

financial statements of RTU for CY 2020 in view of the deficiencies noted in the 

accounts as discussed in detail in Part II of the report. 

 

F. Summary of Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations 
 

 The following are the significant audit observations and recommendations 

which are discussed in detail in Part II of this Report: 

 



vi 

 

1. Misstatements in the aggregate amount of P18,126,525.43 due to accounting 

errors and omissions in the accounts Cash and Cash Equivalents, Receivables, 

Property, Plant and Equipment, and Payables exceeded the materiality threshold 

of P5,588,256.07, computed at one percent of the total Expenses of 

P558,825,606.68 for the year ended December 31, 2020.  (Observation No. 1) 

 

We recommended that Management:  

 

For Cash and Cash Equivalents account 

 

a) thru the Chief Accountant,  effect correcting entries for the unrecorded 

CM, DMs and Income in the amounts of P3,762,345.00; P6,000.00 and 

P66,223.93, respectively, to be supported with complete documentation; 

 

b)  cause the reversion of the stale checks amounting to P684,417.39 to 

Cash and Payable accounts;   

 

c) close the Cash-Treasury Agency Regular account to Accumulated 

Surplus/(Deficit) as required by existing regulations;   

 

For Receivables account 

 

d) thru the HRDC Director, to reconcile records with the Accounting 

Office of the total deductions appearing in the payroll and the records 

of the Accounting to ensure proper monitoring of the balances of 

disallowances as well as the settlement of the balances through 

employee payroll deduction;  

 

e) thru the Accountant, (i) to prepare a JEV for the 

adjustments/corrections affecting said accounts; (ii) to prepare and 

maintain SLs for each official/employee with disallowance; and (iii) to 

submit to COA the revised report, together with the  complete 

documents to support the balance presented in the FS; t 

 

For Property, Plant and Equipment account 

 

f) thru the Accountant, prepare a JEV to adjust the recorded balance of 

the 10 parcels of land to P29,714,402.00 and not P29,027,807.50, to come 

up with correct Land account balance in the FS; 

 

g) thru the Property Officer,  secure from the Assessor’s Office of 

Mandaluyong City (transferor), copy of the Tax Declaration of the 

donated property to get the proper valuation of the said property;  



vii 

 

 

h) thru the Accountant, record the correct value of the donated property 

upon receipt of the Tax Declaration of the donated property with the 

proper valuation; and 

 

For Payables account 

 

i) effect the reversion of the dormant payables to Accumulated 

Surplus/(Deficit) account in accordance with EO No. 87 dated August 

13, 2019. 

 

2. Four accounts with year-end aggregate balance of P1.121 billion are of doubtful 

validity due to the various accounting deficiencies in the total amount of 

P235,219,588.56 and control lapses, which affected the accuracy and 

completeness of the reported balances in the FSs. (Observation No. 2) 

 

We recommended that Management:  

 

             For Cash and Cash Equivalents 

 

a. thru the Accountant, trace the discrepancies between the bank and 

book balances and reconcile said discrepancies so that the correct 

balance of Cash and Cash Equivalents account shall be reported in the 

Statement of Financial Position; 

 

b. see to it that Bank Reconciliation Statement shall be prepared for all 

bank accounts regularly and within the prescribed period; 

 

c. prepare and submit prior years’ BRS to adjust the accumulated 

reconciling items of P22,237,140.81, which is captioned as outstanding 

balances from previous years;  

 

d. prepare the corresponding JEV to correct the discrepancy in   

recording the conversion to peso of the dollar account to the Cash in 

Bank - Foreign Currency account; 

 

For Receivables account 

 

e. analyze the Due from other Funds account and review the transactions 

to determine the cause and details of the huge negative balance of the 

account;  

 

f. prepare adjusting entries to correct the balances of the accounts; 



viii 

 

 

For Advances account 

 

g. thru the Accountant, ensure the proper recording of the Advances 

account; 

 

For Trust Liabilities and Other Payables accounts 

 

h. prioritize the documentation of the Other Payables account to 

substantiate the huge balance thereof and periodically monitor the 

same; and  

 

i. revert the dormant payables to Accumulated Surplus/Deficit in 

accordance with EO No.  87 and Section 98 of PD No. 1445.  

 

3. Funds received from the Commission on Higher Education (CHED), through its 

Higher Education Development Fund (HEDF), as grant for the Project of 

Production of Alcohol-Based Hand Rub Sanitizer as part of the activities to 

combat COVID-19,  amounting to P1,458,897.50 remained unutilized due to: (i) 

delayed implementation of the scheduled activities; and (ii) the unpreparedness 

of the chosen facility or laboratory for the production of the alcohol-based hand 

sanitizer. Also, RTU has failed to provide the Audit Team the weekly reports 

and SLs submitted to CHED to monitor project implementation. (Observation 

No. 3) 

 

We recommended that Management:  a) review the current status of the 

project and immediately process the request of extension from CHED and 

observe the schedule set in the approved extended schedule of activities; b) 

thru  the BAC Office and other involved offices,  expedite the procurement 

and delivery process of the materials and equipment needed; c) prepare the 

facility or laboratory to its working conditions while waiting for the 

materials and equipment; and d) submit and continuously copy furnish the 

COA Office of the weekly reports as well as subsidiary ledgers submitted to 

CHED as required under the MOA. 

 

4. The delayed processing of the Tertiary Education Subsidy (TES) grants to 

qualified beneficiaries deferred the benefit of providing allowances to qualified 

students to support their education-related expenses.  Moreover, inability to take 

an action on the decreasing number of the CHED-identified, as well as, 

enrolled/admitted student-TES grantees denies the University’s other poor but 

deserving students the chance to enjoy the benefits of the government’s 

programs and projects contrary to the provisions of Section 7 of  RA No. 10931 



ix 

 

and Section 22 of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) thereof.  

(Observation No. 4). 

 

We recommended that Management: a) expedite the release to the 

remaining student grantees of the TES subsidy amounting to P2,800,000.00; 

b) revert to the CHED the amount of P300,000.00 excess fund transfers 

computed as the difference between the list of CHED-validated number of 

grantees versus those enrolled and/or admitted in the University multiplied 

by the amount of subsidy per semester; c) submit to the Office of the 

Auditor the budget plan for the use of the remaining Administrative 

Support Cost (ASC); d) immediately settle the unliquidated cash advances 

with the CHED in order to avail of the ASC for the continuing TES 

program; e) thru the Accountant, (i) draw JEV to record the TES subsidy 

of P1,957,000.00 received on December 17, 2020; (ii) adjust the accounts 

affected to fairly present the same on the FSs; (iii)  monitor the fund 

transfers from CHED (Due to NGAs account) to properly recognize in the 

books the receipt of funds as well as the disbursement/liquidation from 

such; and (iv) prepare aging schedule of Due to NGAs (CHED); and f) thru 

the Head of Scholarship and Grants Office, ensure proper coordination 

with current TES student-grantees as well as the population of poor but 

deserving students for receipt and/or application of TES financial benefits 

with CHED. 

 

5. The Unified Student Financial Assistance System for Tertiary Education 

(UniFAST) Memorandum Circular No. 2018-0001 dated March 26, 2018 was 

not strictly adhered by the University, in view of: a) one-time receipt by student 

grantees of the P4,760,000.00  of the TES-ESGP-PA benefits for AY 2018-

2019;  b) delay by 77 to 604 days as of reporting date  in the release of the 

P1,860,000.00   financial benefits to the intended student beneficiaries, thus 

were denied the use of the funds for their  immediate needs; and c) the non-

liquidation to CHED as of December 31, 2020 of the P6,665,000.00 fund 

transfers.  Moreover, the fund transfer for AY 2019-2020 in the amount of 

P1,545,000.00 was not recorded in the books at yearend, while P5,644,400.00 

was not posted in the GL and SLs for monitoring.  .(Observation No. 5) 

 

We recommended that Management: a) comply with the requirements and 

processes for the release of funds to TES-ESGP-PA beneficiaries, that is, 

stipends due to the beneficiary shall be released by the SUC on a monthly 

basis while book allowance shall be released on a semestral basis in 

accordance with Item 6.4 of UniFAST MC No. 2018-0001 dated March 26, 

2018; b) release immediately the remaining financial benefits of 

P1,860,000.00 to the student-grantees; c) thru the Head of Scholarship and 

Grants Office, plan and implement the effective use of the three percent 



x 

 

AMC in accordance with existing rules and regulations; d) through the 

Accountant,   (i) prepare JEV to record the fund transfer of P1,545,000.00 

for TES-ESGP-PA financial benefits for AY 2019 – 2020; (ii) monitor the 

fund transfers for TES-ESGP-PA  to facilitate the accounting and 

liquidation thereof; and e) settle the unliquidated cash advances with the 

CHED in accordance with UniFAST rules and regulations on semestral 

fund transfer liquidation. 

 

 The foregoing audit observations and recommendations were communicated 

through Audit Observation Memorandum (AOM) and discussed during the Exit 

Conference with concerned RTU officials and employees on May 12, 2021.  Their 

comments were incorporated in this Annual Audit Report (AAR), where appropriate. 

 

G. Summary of Audit Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges at Yearend
