EXECUTIVE SUMMARY



Introduction



The West Visayas State College (WVSC) was established in 1965 under Republic Act (RA) No. 4189 which converted the Iloilo Normal School to WVSC.  On January 27, 1986, the College was again converted into the West Visayas State University (WVSU) by virtue of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 2019 and integrated the Iloilo National College of Agriculture in Lambunao, Iloilo. In 2001, by virtue of RA 8292 and RA 7722, four new CHED supervised Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) were again integrated into the WVSU namely: Calinog Agricultural and Industrial College, Janiuay Polytechnic College, Lambunao Institute of Science and Technology and Pototan College of Arts and Sciences.  The four colleges are located in the central part of Iloilo.  In 2006, the Memorandum of Agreement between the University and the City of  Himamaylan, Negros Occidental was approved under Board of Regents’ Resolution No. 24, S. 2006, thus, establishing the WVSU-Himamaylan City Extension Campus. The WVSU-Extension Campus in Himamaylan was converted into a regular campus of the WVSU to be known as the West Visayas State University-Himamaylan City Campus (WVSU-HCC) by virtue of RA 11308 dated April 17, 2019.



WVSU has a 300 bed capacity Medical Center which serves as a teaching training hospital of the WVSU College of Medicine and College of Nursing.  



Governance of WVSU is vested upon the Board of Regents, which exercises policy-making functions to carry out the mission and programs of the University by virtue of RA No. 8292.



WVSU is administered by the University Executive Committee consisting of the University President, Dr. Joselito F. Villaruz and assisted by four central administrative officers, the Vice President for Academic Affairs; Vice President for Research, Extension and Training; Vice President for Administration and Finance, and Vice President for Medical and Allied Services.

Independent Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements



The Auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the financial statements of WVSU for the year ended December 31, 2020 due to exceptions as stated in the Independent Auditor’s report and as discussed in Part II of this Annual Audit Report.



Bases For Audit Qualified Opinion



1)	The reliability, existence and completeness of the WVSU – Main, Pototan and CAF Campuses’ Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) totaling P1.285 billion could not be established due to unreconciled balances amounting to P79.937 million between the financial statements and the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) contrary to the provisions of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume I.



2)	Deficiencies in the recording and issuance of Inventories of the WVSU-Main Campus contrary to Chapter 8 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume I and Section 58 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 resulted in understatement of the Inventory accounts amounting to P16.031 million, therefore, accuracy and validity of the account could not be relied upon, thus affecting its fair presentation in the financial statements. 



3)	The validity and accuracy of various Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) accounts of the WVSU – Pototan Campus totaling P90.843 million, could not be established since the Accountant was not able to provide depreciation contrary to Section 27, Chapter 10 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), resulting in overstatement of the asset and government equity accounts.        	



4)	Non-preparation of the CY 2020 Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) for properties amounting to ₱118.356 million of the Newborn Screening Center – Visayas, and deficiencies in the control mechanisms, contrary to Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume I, Chapter 10, Sections 38 and 42, rendered unreliable the year-end PPE account balances.



5)	Cash in Bank and Government Income/Equity accounts of the Newborn Screening Center – Visayas (NSCV) were understated due to outstanding unreconciled online deposits totaling P26.723 million which remained unadjusted in the latest Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS), thus, the accounts are not fairly presented in the Financial Statements contrary to the pertinent provisions of Government Accounting Manual.



Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations



The following are additional significant observations and recommendations, other than the bases for the qualified opinion that need immediate attention and action by the Head of the Agency:



1)	Inadequate planning in the procurement of 4,707 Learning Resource Packets (Educational Tablets) totaling P28.124 million resulted in 923 unutilized equipment amounting to P5.349 million, thus, defeating the purpose of the procurement made and exposing the same to deterioration and possible damage due to long period of non-utilization.



We recommended and Management agreed to immediately take necessary actions in order to distribute the remaining 923 LRPs to intended beneficiaries and/or find alternative use for the same to avoid possible corrosion or damage that might entail additional repair and also diminish their operational efficiency.



2)	Delayed completion of 20 Special Projects totaling P216.890 million of the WVSU-Main Campus deprived the intended beneficiaries the timely usage thereof. Likewise unutilized funds amounting to P4.607 million of 14 Special Projects already completed were not returned to the source agencies. 



We recommended and Management agreed to:



				a)	Require the personnel concerned to submit explanation/justification on the noted deficiencies, evaluate the completed projects and return to Source Agencies the unutilized balance of P4.607 million;



				b)	Necessitate the immediate preparation and submission of terminal financial reports of all completed projects and strictly comply with reportorial requirements of the MOA as well as submission of reports with complete supporting documents within the prescribed deadlines.



3)	Long outstanding reconciling items including Unrecorded Deposits totaling P4.363 million and Unreconciled Items amounting to P1.299 million in the Bank Reconciliation Statements of the WVSU – Main Campus remained unadjusted, thus, rendered the correctness of the Cash in Bank and other affected accounts unreliable.  



We recommended and Management agreed to: 



	a)	continue to analyze and resolve the unadjusted book and bank reconciling items, and effect the necessary adjustments, to correct the balances appearing in the books;



	b)	review the procedures in the recording of online payments/deposits from clientele to ensure that all deposits in WVSU – Main Campus’ accounts are properly recorded on time and reconciled with bank records; and communicate with the government servicing banks on the reconciliation and adjustment of long overdue bank reconciling items especially the unaccounted deposits dated as early as May 7, 1998.



4)	The grant of COVID-19 Hazard Pay to the personnel of WVSUMC and NSCV amounting to P12.204 million was not in accordance with DBM Budget Circular No. 2020-1, resulting in difficulty in ascertaining the propriety of the amount disbursed and excess payments totaling P1.547 million.



We recommended and Management agreed to:



	a)	Submit the supporting documents required by the DBM BC No. 2020-1 such as authority to physically report for work from the Head of Agency, DTRs for the period March to May 2020 and Accomplishment Report; and



	b)	Review the computation of Hazard Pay and submit justifications on the noted deficiencies; and be more vigilant in the implementation of laws, rules and regulations and exercise due diligence in the disbursement of government funds to avoid suspension or disallowance in audit of financial transactions.

5)	The reliability, existence and completeness of the Inventory accounts totaling ₱43.296 million of WVSU Medical Center could not be established due to the unreconciled balances between the financial statements and the Report on the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) contrary to the provisions of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies.



We recommended and Management agreed to:



a)		Assign a personnel in-charge in the Accounting and Supply Units to regularly update the Supply Ledger Cards and Stock Cards, respectively; and

	

b)		Submit a workplan for the conduct of reconciliation of Inventories with corresponding timelines indicating therein the persons responsible.
