PART II – AUDIT OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



WVSU – Main and External Campuses



Doubtful accuracy and existence of PPE totalling P1.285 billion



1)	The reliability, existence and completeness of the WVSU – Main, Pototan and CAF Campuses’ Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) totaling P1.285 billion could not be established due to unreconciled balances amounting to P79.937 million between the financial statements and the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) contrary to the provisions of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume I.

       

Section 38 Chapter 10 of GAM, Volume I, requires that, “the entity shall have a periodic physical count of PPE, which shall be done annually and presented on the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) (Appendix 73) as at December 31 of each year. This shall be submitted to the Auditor concerned not later than January 31 of the following year. Equipment found at station and losses discovered during the physical count shall be reported to the Accounting Division/Unit for proper accounting/recording”.



Section 42 of the same Chapter in GAM, Volume I states that, “the Chief Accountant shall maintain the Property Plant and Equipment Ledger Card (PPELC) for each category of PPE including work and other animals, livestock etc. The PPELC shall be kept to record promptly the acquisition, description, custody, estimated useful life, depreciation, impairment loss, disposal and other information about the asset. For check and balance, the Property and Supply Office/Unit shall likewise maintain PC for PPE in their custody to account for the receipt and disposition of the same. The balance per PC shall be reconciled with PPELC maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit. They shall also be reconciled with other property records like PAR.”



Verification of the submitted financial statements (FS) and RPCPPE of the WVSU Main, Pototan and CAF Campuses revealed that there were discrepancies in the amounts between the Accounting and Supply Offices records for CYs 2015 to 2020. As of December 31, 2020, recorded PPE accounts totaling ₱1.285 billion were not reconciled with the RPCPPE submitted by the Supply Offices totaling ₱1.205 billion.  Details of the discrepancy totaling ₱79.937 million are presented in Appendix A and summarized as follows.

However, the remaining 11 PPE accounts totaling ₱818.012 million or 75.86 percent of the total PPE accounts of the campus were still unreconciled as of  December 31, 2020, resulting in a variance of ₱41.373 million between the Accounting and Supply records.



The Management stated that continuous measures on the reconciliation process are put in place and an Inventory Committee shall be constituted to devise the Physical Inventory Plan (PIP) for the cleansing of PPE accounts in accordance with COA Circular No. 2020-006 dated January 31, 2020. Moreover, constant updating of the PPELCs and PCs for newly purchased or acquired properties are ensured by the Accountants and Supply Officers.

However, as of December 31, 2020, the PPE accounts “Books”, “Technical and Scientific Equipment” and “Power Supply System” showed a variance of ₱609,949.12, ₱346,202.12 and ₱902,063.94, respectively between the Supply and Accounting Offices records due to non-recording by the Accounting Office of the increase in said PPE accounts for CY 2020.



Likewise, instead of further reconciliation, significant variance between the Accounting and Supply Offices records was noted on the following PPE accounts:

    47,009,259.45

  (18,841,800.60)



Furthermore, no additional reconciliation was made in CY 2020 and the remaining 17 PPE accounts totaling ₱109.026 million or 99.84% of the total PPE accounts were still unreconciled resulting to a total net variance of ₱29.995 million or an increase of P15.696 million from CY 2019’s total variance of P14.299 million.



The Management remarked that the material increase in the Buildings account pertain to completed projects in CY 2020 that were not recorded by the Supply Section. Hence, the Management formed a new Inventory Committee and moved to hire additional Job-order personnel in the Supply Office to expedite the on-going reconciliation, updating and maintenance of the records.



Consequently, the accuracy and existence of the PPE accounts totaling ₱1.285 billion could not be established, thus, the reliability of the balances reflected in the financial statements at year end could not be relied upon.



We recommended and Management agreed to:



1)	Require the Accountant and Supply Officer to update the PPE Ledger Cards and Property Cards, respectively as well as ensure that PPELCs and PCs are accomplished with complete and necessary data; 

	

2)	Direct the Accountants and Supply Officers to reconcile the PPE Ledger Cards and the Property Cards to ensure reliability of the year-end PPE account balances.



3)	Submit a workplan to the Auditor for the conduct of reconciliation of PPE accounts with corresponding timelines and indicating therein the persons responsible.



4)	Require concerned agency officials to submit to the Auditor progress report on the reconciliation together with the supporting documents.



Deficiencies in the Inventory Accounting System



2)	Deficiencies in the recording and issuance of Inventories of the WVSU-Main Campus contrary to Chapter 8 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume I and Section 58 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 resulted in understatement of the Inventory accounts amounting to P16.031 million, therefore, accuracy and validity of the account could not be relied upon, thus affecting its fair presentation in the financial statements. 



Section 58 of PD No. 1445 provides that “the examination and audit of assets shall be performed with a view to ascertaining their existence, ownership, valuation and encumbrances as well as the propriety of items composing the respective asset accounts, determining their agreement with records; proving the accuracy of such records; ascertaining if the assets were utilized economically, efficiently and effectively; and evaluating the adequacy of controls over the accounts.” 

	

Section 9, Chapter 8 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume I states that supplies and materials purchased for inventory purpose shall be recorded using the perpetual inventory system, resulting in a more accurate inventory records and a running total for the cost of goods sold in each period. The system requires accounting records to show the amount of inventory on hand at all times through the maintenance of the Supplies Ledger Card (SLC) by the Accounting Division/Unit and Stock Card (SC) by the Supply and/or Property Division/Unit for each item in stock.  Regular purchases shall be coursed through the inventory account and issuances thereof shall be recorded as they take place except for supplies and materials purchased out of PCF for immediate use or on emergency cases which shall be charged directly to the appropriate expense accounts.  



Section 13, Chapter 8 of the same Manual discusses about the Inventory Accounting System which consists of the system of monitoring, controlling and recording of acquisition and disposal of inventory.  It also states that physical count/inventory, which is required semi-annually, is an indispensable procedure for checking the integrity of property custodianship.



Among the Records, Forms and Reports to be prepared and/or maintained by the Agency, as required in Section 17, Chapter 8 of GAM, are the following:



a)	Stock Card (SC) (Appendix 58) – shall be used to record all receipts and issues of supplies and the balance in quantity at any time. It shall be maintained by the Property and/or Supply Division/Unit for each item in stock. The Inspection and Acceptance Report (IAR), Requisition and Issue Slip (RIS), Purchase Order (PO) and Delivery Receipt (DR) serve as the original sources of information for making entries on the card.  



b)	Supplies Ledger Card (SLC) (Appendix 57) – shall be used to record materials received, issued and the balance both in quantity and amount at any time.  It shall be maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit for each kind of supplies and materials. The IAR, RIS, Report of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI), PO and DR serve as the original sources of information for making entries on the card.  



c)	Requisition and Issue Slip (RIS) (Appendix 63) – shall be used by the end-user to request issue of supplies and materials that are carried on stock. It is also used by the Property and/or Supply Division/Unit to indicate availability or non-availability of items requisitioned and/or to record issues of item/s requisitioned.



d)	Report of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI) (Appendix 64) – shall be prepared by the Property and/or Supply Custodian based on the RIS and shall be used by the Accounting Division/Unit as basis in preparing the JEV to record the supplies and materials issued.   



e)	Report on the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) (Appendix 66) – shall be used to report the physical count of supplies by type of inventory as at a given date.  It shows the balance of inventory items per card and per count and shortage/overage, if any. These include the semi-expendable property wherein the issue is covered by ICS. 



f)	Inventory Custodian Slip (ICS) (Appendix 59) – shall be prepared upon issue of semi expendable property covered by approved RIS.   



Verification of the agency’s Inventory Accounting System revealed the following deficiencies:



1)	Semi-expendable properties and inventories amounting to P5.569 million and P305,496.68 (Appendix B) supposedly for storage in the Supply Office were instead issued to the Supply Officer and recognized as expense for the period. 



Inspection conducted revealed that inventories in the Supply Office pertaining to those delivered by the Procurement Service last July 8, 2019 as well as 932 semi-expendable properties (Tablets) which were not yet distributed to the intended end-users were all issued to the Supply Officer and immediately charged to expense resulting to overstatement of expense account and understatement of the corresponding inventory accounts.



2)	All purchases of inventories for the year were immediately issued/distributed after delivery to respective end-users and recognized as expense to do away with the required physical count of said inventories and preparation of the Report on the Physical Count of Inventories (RCPI) at the end of every semester, without consideration on whether the same will exceed the planned usage for the period. 



Although Section 7, Chapter 8 of GAM provides that the expense is recognized when inventories are distributed/issued, Section 16, Chapter 8 of the same manual likewise states that the Head/Authorized Official shall determine the reasonableness of the quantity and nature of item/s being requested and ensure that the same does not exceed the planned usage for the period.



Our inspection disclosed that inventories totaling P10.157 million (Appendix B) which were issued to the University Publishing House and Bookstore (UPHB) and directly charged to appropriate expense accounts remained unutilized as of December 31, 2020, resulting to overstatement of expense accounts and understatement of the corresponding inventory accounts. 



Moreover, evaluation of issued/distributed inventories for the period August 5, 2020 to November 20, 2020 amounting to P2.190 million (Appendix C) disclosed that the total amount was directly charged to expense regardless of whether or not they will be consumed within the accounting period.  



3)	The Supply Office prepared the RIS instead of the Requesting Office/Personnel. 



Section 16, Chapter 8 of GAM, Volume I provides that it is the requesting office/personnel who shall prepare the RIS and fill up all the necessary information except for the “Issue” column, to be forwarded to the head/authorized official for review and approval. The head/authorized official shall then determine the reasonableness of the quantity and nature of item/s being requested and ensure that the same does not exceed the planned usage for the period. After approval of the authorized official, the requesting personnel shall forward the signed RIS to the Supply Office for determination of availability of stocks and/or withdrawal of inventory items requested. 



4)	The validity of inventories totaling P4.598 million reflected in the financial statements at year-end could not be established since it was not supported with the RPCI. Details of the accounts are as follows:



Inventory Account

Amount

Office Supplies Inventory

   1,577,252.55 

Accountable Forms, Plates and Stickers Inventory

        38,800.00 

Animal/Zoological Supplies Inventory

      530,155.00 

Medical, Dental and Laboratory Supplies Inventory

      331,769.14 

Agricultural and Marine Supplies Inventory

        12,280.00 

Textbooks and Instructional Materials Inventory

      461,320.00 

Other Supplies and Materials Inventory

   1,646,081.94 

TOTAL

4,597,658.63 



Interview with the Accountant revealed that the above inventories allegedly pertained to the cost of items already distributed to end-users but were not dropped from the books of accounts.  However, validation of issuances of these inventories could not be undertaken due to non-submission of the Report on Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI) by the Supply Office.



As a consequence of the above deficiencies, the accuracy of the reported inventory and the corresponding expense balances presented in the year-end financial statements could not be relied upon.



The Management submitted that keeping the records of inventories is a daunting task, specifically following the Perpetual Inventory System where the Agency has to continually track all additions and deductions from the inventory. Likewise, the error of issuing to the Supply Officer all unissued/undistributed supplies/semi-expendable properties was committed due to misinterpretation in the application of generally accepted accounting principle that issuance of ICS for all delivered items was necessary as one of the supporting documents for processing of payments to suppliers. 



Sections 15 and 16, Chapter 8 of the GAM provided the “Procedures in the Receipt, Inspection, Acceptance and Recording of Deliveries of Inventory Items” and “Procedures in the Requisition and Issue of Inventory Items”, respectively to guide Management in keeping records of their inventories. One of the procedures was to designate a Supplies Ledger Card (SLC) Keeper in the Accounting Unit who shall record receipt of delivered/accepted good and post necessary information in the SLC. Likewise, the Supply Unit shall designate a Stock Card Keeper who shall assist in the monitoring of issuance/distribution of inventories.



Moreover, interview with the Accountant and Supply Officer disclosed that all delivered items were immediately issued/distributed in bulk to various units/offices of the University and recorded as expense since each procurement was based on the specific requests of those units/offices. However, perusal of those request revealed that such was based on the allotted budget of the unit/office and not necessarily on their planned usage for the period.



We recommended and Management agreed to:

a)	Discontinue the practice of immediately distributing all purchased supplies and materials to end-users as well as the preparation of the RIS by the Supply Office. Issuances should be made according to the requisitions of respective end-users based on their requirement subject to the evaluation and approval of the authorized personnel to ensure that the same do not exceed the planned usage for the period; 



b)	Designate a Stock Card Keeper (Supply Office)/Supply Ledger Card Keeper (Accounting Office) to monitor the receipts and issuances/distributions of inventory items; 



c)	Stop the practice of issuing any unutilized/undistributed supplies and materials inventory as well as semi-expendable properties to the Supply Officer and recording the same as expenses for the period;  



d)	Conduct physical count of all unutilized/undistributed supplies and materials as well as semi-expendable properties at the end of every semester, prepare the Report on the Physical Count of Inventories and submit the same to the Office of the Auditor; and



e)	Exert extra effort in reconciling the records of Accounting and Supply for inventories totaling P4.598 million and effect the necessary adjustments, to correct the balances appearing in the financial statements.



Doubtful validity of PPE totaling P90.843 million due to non-provision of Depreciation 



3)	The validity and accuracy of various Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) accounts of the WVSU – Pototan Campus totaling P90.843 million, could not be established since the Accountant was not able to provide depreciation contrary to Section 27, Chapter 10 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), resulting in overstatement of the asset and government equity accounts.        	



Section 27, Chapter 10 (Property, Plant and Equipment) of the Government Accounting Manual, provides the following:



“Sec. 27. Depreciation. PPE gradually loses its ability to provide service over the course of time. Because of this, its cost needs to be distributed on a systematic basis over its useful life. The allocated cost is referred to as depreciation. The depreciation charge for each period shall be recognized as expense unless it is included in the carrying amount of another asset. xxx.”



It further provides that except for land and not recognized heritage assets, all PPE shall be depreciated and that the straight line method of depreciation shall be adopted unless another method is more appropriate for entity operation. That method is applied consistently from period to period unless there is a change in the expected pattern of consumption of those future economic benefits or service potential.



As for the estimation of the useful life of the asset, the GAM states that it is a matter of judgment based on the experience of the entity with similar assets. The agency/entity is in the best position to estimate the expected useful life of its PPE or the Management may refer to the Section 27(f), Chapter 10 of GAM for the life spans in which PPE can be depreciated. 



Likewise, Section 27(g) of the same Manual states that a residual value equivalent to at least five percent (5%) of the cost shall be adopted unless a more appropriate percentage is determined by the entity based on its operation subject to the approval of COA. Generally, infrastructure assets have no residual value. In case, the residual value of parts of the infrastructure assets can be determined, the policy of at least five percent (5%) of the cost of that part shall be applied.



The Campus’ Trial Balance as of December 31, 2020 showed various PPE accounts as follows:

The Audit Team noted that for CY 2020, despite the management’s commitment to implement prior years’ recommendation of providing depreciation for PPE, the Accountant was only able to provide depreciation amounting to P123,590.52 for certain Information & Communication Technology (ICT) Equipment but did not provide depreciation for other PPE accounts. We also noted that depreciation was provided for three (3) PPE Accounts (Office Equipment, Furniture & Fixtures and Motor Vehicles) in CY 2018, however, none was provided for these PPE accounts in CYs 2019 and 2020. 



The Accountant stated that except for certain ICT Equipment for CY 2020, she was not able to provide depreciation for all PPE accounts for CYs 2019 and 2020 since the subsidiary ledgers used as basis in providing depreciation for some PPE accounts were lost. Likewise, details such as original costs and dates of purchase of some PPE were not available, contributing to the difficulty in providing depreciation. She further stated that they are now reconstructing those subsidiary ledgers and likewise committed to provide the required depreciation for PPE in CY 2021. 



We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to exert extra effort to analyze and provide depreciation for various PPE accounts totaling P90.843 million, to ensure the validity, accuracy, and the fair presentation of the accounts in the financial statements at year-end.



Unutilized/Undistributed Learning Resource Packets totalling P5.349 million



4)	Inadequate planning in the procurement of 4,707 Learning Resource Packets (Educational Tablets) totaling P28.124 million resulted in 923 unutilized equipment amounting to P5.515 million, thus, defeating the purpose of the procurement made and exposing the same to deterioration and possible damage due to long period of non-utilization contrary to Section 2 of Presidential Decree No. 1445.  Likewise, this is tantamount to unnecessary disbursement of government funds, contrary to Section 4 of COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012. 



Section 2 of Presidential Decree No. 1445 otherwise known as the “Government Auditing Code of the Philippines” states that:



“DECLARATION OF POLICY.   It is the declared policy of the State that all resources of the government shall be managed, expended or utilized in accordance with law and regulations, and safeguarded against loss or wastage through illegal or improper disposition, with a view to ensuring efficiency, economy, and effectiveness in the operations of government.  The responsibility to take care that such policy is faithfully adhered to rests with the chief or head of the government concerned.”





Further, Section 4.1 of COA Circular No. 2012-003 defines “Unnecessary” Expenditures:



“The term pertains to expenditures which could not pass the test of prudence or the diligence of a good father of a family, thereby denoting non-responsiveness to the exigencies of the service. Unnecessary expenditures are those not supportive of the implementation of the objectives and mission of the agency relative to the nature of its operation. This would also include incurrence of expenditure not dictated by the demands of good government, and those the utility of which cannot be ascertained at a specific time. An expenditure that is not essential or that which can be dispensed with without loss or damage to property is considered unnecessary. The mission and thrusts of the agency incurring the expenditures must be considered in determining whether or not an expenditure is necessary.”



Annex “C” of the same COA Circular provides specific cases that are considered “Unnecessary” expenditures or uses of government funds and property, such as:



--	Procurement of equipment not actually needed or without any intended purpose, not put to use or used for purposes other than the intended purpose, xxx.



With the challenge brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) recommended higher education institutions in the country to use flexible learning methods, a combination of wired and non-wired learning modalities.  In response to this, West Visayas State University (WVSU) with the approval of the Board of Regents, took a strategic initiative to provide equitable access to support remote learning through the issuance of Learning Resource Packets (LRP) for all undergraduate students in the Main Campus.



Likewise, WVSU issued the “Guidelines on the Provision of Learning Resource Packets (LRP) to Support Flexible Learning” to provide mechanisms to ensure its proper issuance, utilization and sustainability. Section 8 of the General Guidelines of the same provides that a technical working group shall be created and tasked to design a process as well as assign specific unit/personnel to ensure smooth distribution and accounting of Learning Resource Packets.



For CY 2020, WVSU procured 4,707 Learning Resource Packets (Lenovo Tab M7) amounting to P28.124 million. Deliveries of said items were made by the supplier from September 25, 2020 to November 20, 2020.



Interview with the Chief Administrative Officer disclosed that the number of tablets procured was based on the number of students who signified their intention to enroll as provided by the deans/heads of the different colleges of the WVSU Main Campus. Inventory Custodian Slips (ICS) were then prepared and issued to the Deans/Heads for distribution to their respective students to be utilized starting the 1st Semester of Academic Year (AY) 2020-2021, to wit:

Evaluation of the procurement and utilization of the 4,707 Learning Resource Packets disclosed the following deficiencies:



a)	932 units were not distributed to intended beneficiaries and remained unutilized as of December 31, 2020. Inspection conducted on March 25, 2021 further revealed that the Supply Officer issued an ICS for 932 units to herself to make it appear that the same were all issued contrary to the provision of the Government Accounting Manual that ICS shall only be prepared upon issue of semi-expendable property covered by an approved Requisition Issue Slip (RIS) to the end-users. Moreover, 923 units remained unutilized/undistributed as of that date. 



Likewise, included in the 932 units issued to the Supply Officer were the 229 units originally issued to her as per Inventory Custodian Slip dated December 17, 2020 .These 229 units represented the excess of the projected number of students compared with the actual number of students enrolled for AY 2020-2021.  



As of December 31, 2020, despite the re-issuance of the 932 unutilized/undistributed units to the Supply Officer, the original ICS for 229 units was not cancelled and the previous ICS issued to the deans/heads of colleges were not modified/adjusted to reflect the actual number of LRPs distributed to their respective students.



b)	Data on the number of educational tablets distributed per College was not readily available, precluding the prompt validation of the submitted distribution list.



The distribution list submitted was per locality and year level, except for those distributed at Iloilo City which were divided per college. In an interview with the Supply Officer, she stated that the distribution per college was available at the Management Information System (MIS) Office as students were tagged in the system upon receipt of the LRP. However, the same was not submitted as of April 30, 2021, resulting to difficulty in ascertaining the accuracy of the distribution list submitted.



The above practice resulted in difficulty in pinpointing accountability as the ICS issued to the deans/heads of colleges does not tally with the actual number of LRPs distributed to their respective students. 



c)	As of March 25, 2021, 923 LRPs remained unutilized, thus, exposing the units to possible corrosion or damage that can entail additional expenses for repairs. Also, the prolonged non-use of these equipment diminish their operational efficiency which might eventually result in wastage of government funds.



Android devices generally have a useful life span of only three years while cheaper ones such as the Lenovo Tab M7 have less, hence, failing to put to use these LRPs six (6) months after they were delivered might affect their performance efficiency and likewise result in shorter utilization period. Moreover, procurement of equipment not actually needed or not put to use was considered unnecessary expenditure or use of government funds. 



The Audit Team requested for the composition of the committee responsible for the determination of the number of Learning Resource Packets purchased and their distribution. However, the same was not yet submitted as of April 30, 2021.



Management remarked that they exerted effort to deliver the LRPs to the different cities and municipalities within Panay and Negros Islands and a reconciliation of the records of Supply Office and the different colleges was necessary to come up with the actual number of equipment distributed. Likewise the unutilized/undistributed LRPs belonged to students who either refused to claim their LRPs or were located in Mindanao, Luzon and outside of Panay and Negros Islands, of which delivery was not feasible at the moment. Moreover, the University President will issue a memorandum to the Supply Officer to rectify its practice in establishing accountability over unissued equipment as well as to the LRP Committee to find alternative use for these undistributed LRPs.



Further interview with the Chief Administrative Officer revealed that students do not necessarily have to get the LRPs to avail of the flexible learning arrangements as the learning essentials/modules uploaded in the equipment are also available online through the University’s website.  Hence, the LRP Committee should have acquired the students’ preference of whether or not to avail of the LRP as an input in the procurement planning.   



We recommended that Management:



a)	Direct the concerned University officials to submit a justification as to why they should not be held liable for “unnecessary” expenditures for the non-use of 923 LRPs;



b)	Immediately take necessary actions in order to distribute the remaining 923 LRPs to intended beneficiaries and/or find alternative use for the same to avoid possible corrosion or damage that might entail additional repair and also diminish their operational efficiency;



c)	Stop the practice of issuing any unutilized/undistributed semi-expendable properties to the Supply Officer;  and



d)	Submit the distribution list per college and adjust/modify the ICS issued to the deans/heads of colleges to reflect the actual number of LRPs distributed/issued to their respective students.







Delayed completion of special projects and non-return of unutilized funds



5)	Delayed completion of 20 Special Projects totaling P216.890 million of the WVSU-Main Campus contrary to the Memoranda of Agreement (MOA) with various Government Agencies deprived the intended beneficiaries the timely usage thereof. Likewise unutilized funds amounting to P4.607 million of 14 Special Projects already completed were not returned to the source agencies as of December 31, 2020, contrary to Section 4.9 of COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994 and Section 63, Chapter 6 of Government Accounting Manual, Volume I.  



The University as Implementing Agency (IA) was a recipient of various funds from other agencies.  A Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) was entered into by and between the university and various funding government agencies indicating therein the responsibilities of both parties and the duration for the implementation of the projects, among others.



COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994 sets forth the rules and regulations on the grant, utilization and liquidation of funds transferred to implementing agencies to ensure that the transfer is properly taken up in the books of both the Source Agency (SA) and Implementing Agency (IA), the transferred fund is used only for the intended purpose and that proper accounting and reporting is made on the utilization of funds. Section 4 of the same provides the general guidelines, as follows:



“4.1	The SA shall enter into an agreement with the IA for the undertaking by the latter of the project of the former.  The Agreement shall provide for the requirements for project implementation and reporting.



4.5	A separate subsidiary record for each account shall be maintained by the IA whether or not a separate bank account is opened.



4.6	Within ten (10) days after the end of each month/end of the agreed period for the Project, the IA shall submit the Report of Checks Issued (RCI) and the Report of Disbursement (RD) to report the utilization of the funds.  Only actual project expenses shall be reported.  The reports shall be approved by the Head of the IA.



4.9	The IA shall return to the SA any unused balance upon completion of the project.”



Likewise, Section 6 of the same COA circular states the duties and responsibilities of the implementing agency, to wit:



“6.1	issue an official receipt for every amount received from the SA;



6.2	deposit the amount with its authorized depository bank;



6.3	keep separate subsidiary records for the trust liability whether or not a separate bank account is maintained;



6.4	within five (5) days after the end of each month, the Accountable Officer (AO) shall prepare the RCI and the RD and shall submit them with all supporting vouchers/payrolls and documents to the Accountant.  These reports shall be approved by the Head of the Agency;



6.5	within ten (10) days after receipt from the AO, the Accountant shall verify the Reports, provide accounting entries, record and submit the duplicate copies of the Reports with all the originals of vouchers/payrolls and all supporting documents to the IA Auditor.  The Accountant shall ensure that only expenses for the project are included in the Reports.  He shall submit the original copy of the Reports to the SA (Attention: The SA Accountant).



6.7	return to the SA any unused balance and refund of disallowance upon completion of the project.” (emphasis supplied)



Moreover, Section 63, Chapter 6 of the Government Accounting Manual, Volume I provides the detailed accounting policies for the fund transfers from the Source Agency to Implementing Agency.



The verification of the 54 Special Projects implemented for CYs 2016-2020 disclosed the project status and are summarized as follows: (see Appendix D for details)

Further analysis disclosed the following deficiencies:



a)		Twenty five projects were completed on time. However, unused funds amounting to P2.828 million of 10 projects which were completed for the period December 2016 to September 2020 were not returned to source agencies;

	

b)		Terminal Reports of most completed projects were not prepared and submitted to the Source Agencies;

	

c)		There was a noted delay in the completion of 14 finished projects as well as six (6) on-going projects with total fund release and unutilized balance as of December 31, 2020 of P216.890 million and P20.748 million, respectively.  Moreover, unused funds of four (4) projects already completed as early as August 2018, amounting to P1.779 million were not returned to the SA.



d)		Reports of Checks Issued and Reports of Disbursements with complete supporting vouchers/payrolls and documents were not submitted to the Auditor within the reglementary period contrary to Sections 6.4 and 6.5 of the same COA circular. 



	The practice of the agency was to submit the Report of Checks Issued together with the disbursement vouchers (DVs) and supporting documents monthly while the Liquidation Reports and/or utilization reports such as quarterly, semi-annual or annual Financial Reports, Liquidation Reports and/or Terminal Reports fund were submitted quarterly. 

	

	Likewise, perusal of the records of this Office revealed that there were delays in the submission of the disbursement vouchers pertaining to these projects for CY 2020 (Appendix E for details).

	

	Moreover, it was observed that for CY 2020, quarterly/semi-annual/annual fund utilization reports of special projects were not dutifully submitted to the Auditor and there were delays in the submission of such reports (Appendix F).

	

e)		Copy of the Memorandum of Agreement or Contract of all projects implemented by the University were not submitted/furnished to the Office of the Auditor. 



It is worth noting that for fund transfers to be recognized as fully liquidated, it is necessary that the WVSU – Main Campus return any unutilized amount to the Source Agencies and to submit the required report thereon. The continued non-remittance of unused funds totaling P4.607 million of 14 projects when the purpose thereof have already been attained as evidenced by the completion of the projects, resulted in the unnecessary and prolonged recognition of liability pertaining to said fund transfers.



Likewise, the delay or non-regular submission of Report of Checks Issued and Report of Disbursements together with the disbursement vouchers and complete supporting documents as well as fund utilization reports of various special projects precluded the Auditor of the prompt validation of the propriety of the transactions/payments and monitoring of the projects’ accomplishment.



Moreover, non-completion of the projects within the project duration contrary to what was stipulated in the memoranda of agreement, deprived the intended beneficiaries the timely usage of the same.

	

	Interview with the personnel-in-charge disclosed that non-return of unused fund balances of completed projects was mainly due to the non-preparation of terminal/liquidation reports by project leaders. Relative to this, Management informed the Audit Team that a meeting will be conducted with the Vice President for Research, Extension and Training (VPRET) and Project Leaders to discuss the status of the projects and nature of unexpended balances.   Likewise, Project Leaders and the personnel-in-charge committed to initiate the preparation of terminal reports as well as processing of return of the unexpended balances of completed projects.

	

	Furthermore, Management acknowledged their lapses in the submission of financial reports and reportorial requirements and committed to submit the same within the reglementary period. 

		

We recommended and Management agreed to:



a)	Complete the preparation and submission of terminal/liquidation reports as well as the refund of unutilized balances of completed projects to Source Agencies;



b)	Ensure that Report of Check Issued and Report of Disbursements together with the disbursement vouchers and complete supporting document are submitted to the Office of the Auditor within the prescribed timelines;



c)	Strictly comply with reportorial requirements of the MOA (i.e. progress reports and financial reports) to facilitate the monitoring of the projects’ accomplishment; and 



d)	Provide the Office of the Auditor a copy of MOA or Contract for every project being implemented by the University.



Long Outstanding Reconciling Items in the BRS



6)	Long outstanding reconciling items including Unrecorded Deposits totaling P4.363 million and Unreconciled Items amounting to P1.299 million in the Bank Reconciliation Statements of the WVSU – Main Campus remained unadjusted, contrary to Sections 58 of PD No. 1445 and Sections 3 and 6, Chapter 21 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume I, thus, rendered the correctness of the Cash in Bank and other affected accounts unreliable.  



Section 58 of PD No. 1445 provides among othe``rs that the examination and audit of assets shall be performed with a view to ascertaining their existence ownership, valuation and encumbrances as well as the propriety of items composing the respective asset accounts, determining their agreement with records, proving the accuracy of such records; ascertaining if the assets were utilized economically, efficiently and effectively; and evaluating the adequacy of controls over the accounts.

	

Likewise, Section 6, Chapter 21 of the GAM, Volume I, states that:



“Sec. 6. Recognition of Adjustments. The Chief Accountant/Designated Staff shall prepare a JEV to recognize all reconciling items that require adjustment and correction in the books of accounts.”



Review of the Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS) as of December 31, 2020 disclosed that minimal adjustments were made for CY 2020 on the long overdue reconciling items appearing on various BRS of the Campus, as follows:

For CY 2020, aside from the effect of the above-mentioned adjustments, there was a significant increase of P2.577 million on the balance of unrecorded deposits bringing its total to P4.363 million while unreconciled items still amounted to P1.299 million as of December 31, 2020. Details of the reconciling items (Appendices G and G1) are summarized below:

This practice of non-adjustment of long overdue bank reconciling items is contrary to the very objective of the preparation of the Bank Reconciliation Statements as provided for in Section 3, Chapter 21 of GAM, Volume I, as follows:



	a)	check correctness of both the bank’s and agency’s/entity’s records,

	b)	serve as a deterrent to fraud, and

	c)	enable the agency/entity or bank to take up charges or credits recognized by the bank or agency/entity but not yet known to the agency/entity or bank.

	

Likewise, the Bank Reconciliation Statements for the period June to December 2020 for DBP Account No. 0755-009622-030 were not yet submitted to the Office of the Auditor as of February 26, 2021.



Moreover, Section 6, Chapter 2, Volume I of Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs) provides the basic government accounting and budget reporting principles, on which each entity shall recognize and present its financial transactions and operation. One of the basic principles adopted in GAM is the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS).











Accrual basis has been defined in PPSAS 1/IPSAS 1-Presentation of Financial Statements as follows:



“Accrual basis means a basis of accounting under which transactions and other events are recognized when they occur (and not only when cash or its equivalent is received or paid). Therefore, the transactions and events are recorded in the accounting records and recognized in the financial statements of the periods to which they relate. The elements recognized under accrual accounting are assets, liabilities, net assets/equity, revenue, and expenses.” (Emphasis supplied)



The non-recording in the books of the BRS reconciling item identified as unrecorded deposits amounting to P4.363 million which dates back to CY 2011, resulted in the understatement of the Cash in Bank as well as the Income/Government Equity accounts of the agency contrary to Section 58 of PD No. 1445 and Sections 3 and 6, Chapter 21 of GAM, Volume I, thus rendered the accuracy of the cash in bank and other affected accounts unreliable. 

	

In an interview with the Accountant, she stated that unrecorded deposits were not recognized in the books and issued official receipts due to difficulty in identifying the depositors/payors. Some of these unrecorded deposits pertained to payment made directly to the bank by the applicants to the College Admission Test (CAT) and Diploma in Teaching (DIT).



Likewise, the Bank Reconciliation Statements for the period June to December 2020 for DBP Account No. 0755-009622-030 were not submitted to the Office of the Auditor due to a reconciling item that could not be identified for the month of June, 2020, thus, succeeding BRS could  not be finalized.



In response to the recommendations, Management remarked that they have already resolved/identified deposits made by CAT and DIT applicants amounting to P3,500 and P7,900, respectively.  Moreover, double deposits made by the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) amounting to P31,680.00 and P149,610.00 will be reverted to the cash account of that agency. Furthermore, several letters were made to the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP), Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) and officials of the University seeking assistance in identifying the unrecorded deposits.

	

We recommended and Management agreed to:



	a)	exert effort in resolving/identifying reconciling items and prepare the Bank Reconciliation Statements for DBP Account No. 0755-009622-030 for the period June to December 2020; 



	b)	continue to analyze and resolve the unrecorded book and bank reconciling items, and effect the necessary adjustments, to correct the balances appearing in the books;



	c)	review the procedures in the recording of online payments/deposits from clientele to ensure that all deposits in WVSU – Main Campus’ accounts are properly recorded on time and reconciled with bank records; and



	d)	communicate with the government servicing banks on the reconciliation and adjustment of long overdue bank reconciling items especially the unaccounted deposits dated as early as May 7, 1998.





Uncollected Receivables totalling P1.954 million from StuFAP and SAFE Loans



7)	Long outstanding loans receivable of the 220 Student Financial Assistance Program (StuFAP) and 262 Student Assistance Fund for Education (SAFE) grantees amounting to P0.703 million and P1.251 million, respectively in the WVSU System have not been collected contrary to CHED Memoranda Order Nos. 4 s. 2004 and 25 s. 2008, thus, the risk of program discontinuance is high, program viability is not ensured and the programs’ objective of providing loans continuously to the students was not be fully achieved.



The Commission on Higher Education (CHED) through the StuFAP and SAFE loan programs pursues the goal of broadening the access of deserving and qualified students to loan schemes intended to contribute to the long term objectives of enhancing the nation’s human capital, competitiveness and economic development.



To attain the objectives of the programs, the amounts of P1.581 million and P1.965 million were allocated to WVSU Main and external campuses for the StuFAP and SAFE Loan Programs, respectively, to wit:

Item IV.2 of CHED Memorandum Order No. 4 series of 2004 provides the duties, functions and responsibilities of those involved in the implementation and administration of StuFAP loan program.  Likewise, as provided in Section VII of the same regulation and covered by Loan Agreements, the qualified borrowers may be allowed to borrow a maximum of P8,000.00 per semester and that the loan shall be payable as follows:



--	Loans below P4,000 –within 5 years

	“Participating Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) shall perform the following:

	v. Draw corresponding duly notarized promissory note for repayment within 2 to 5 years after graduation, duly signed by the borrower when grant of loan is awarded; x x x assist CHEDRO to monitor or track the whereabouts of the scholars after graduation in order that the latter properly comply with their obligation to refund the loan at the intended period of repayment”

	Section VI and VII of CHED Memorandum Order No. 4 series of 2004 provides the following:

	“VI. QUALIFICATION OF APPLICANTS	

	The applicants for the STUDENT FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM must meet the following qualifications/requirements:

	Xxx d. Must have a co-borrower either his/her parents or his/her relatives or any person who is a GSIS/SSS Member. xxx”

	“VII. LOANABLE AMOUNT and MODE OF PAYMENT

	“xxx The student borrower’s parents (either father or mother), any relatives or persons he/she may present shall sign the loan agreement together with the student.”

	Audit of StuFAP and SAFE loans receivables of the WVSU System revealed that P0.703 million and P1.251 million (Appendix H), respectively, has been outstanding as of December 31, 2020. The summary is as follows:

Out of the P3.546 million loaned for StuFAP and SAFE, the amount of P1.954 million or 55.09 percent were not collected from concerned WVSU students as of December 31, 2020, and remained outstanding for over 10 years, thus, the Loan Agreement by and between the Student-Borrower, Co-Maker and the University was not fully carried out.



Despite the action of sending demand letters to student borrowers, the management was not able to enforce the provisions provided in the loan agreement and collect the outstanding loans receivables. The total payments collected for CY 2020 was only P19,695.00 and P32,000.00 from StuFAP and SAFE Loans, respectively.  



Interview with the Accountants disclosed that the non-collection of these receivables was due to difficulty in tracking the whereabouts of grantees as well as the refusal of borrowers to settle their obligations.  



	Moreover, the co-borrower upon signing the loan agreement is also jointly and severally liable of the loaned amount. Hence, the liability may be enforced against the co-maker in case of refusal or failure of the student borrower to pay the loan. 

	

	The non-collection of due and demandable receivables increased the risk of program discontinuance. Also, program viability was not ensured and the objective of the program aimed at providing loans continuously to the students was not fully achieved because of exhaustion of funds.

	

	The Administration stated that the minimal collection from loans for CY 2020 was primarily due to the restrictions implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic.  However, record of the Office of the Auditor disclosed that WVSU – CAF and Pototan Campuses did not collect any amount while WVSU – Janiuay Campus was only able to collect P2,500.00 for CY 2019.

	

We recommended and Management agreed to:



a)	Intensify the collection of due and demandable accounts by re-issuance of demand letters to student borrowers and to the co-makers in case of refusal or failure of student borrowers to settle their liabilities, in order to have adequate funds for relending to financially handicapped graduating students;



b)	Set up an effective monitoring system to keep track of the whereabouts of the student-grantees; and



c)	Evaluate if the outstanding receivables meet the criteria provided in COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016 on Request for Write-Off of Dormant Accounts and commence the process required therein.



Management Comments:



Main Campus



	The management collected additional payments amounting to P4,625.00 as of February 2021 and demand letters were prepared to be sent to the grantees in March 2021. Further, the tagging of students with outstanding loans in the University’s information system notifies the management when they have transactions in the different departments of the university.



The Management assured that the provisions of the loan agreement shall be implemented firmly moving forward and a functional monitoring system would be put in place. 



Calinog Campus



	A specific personnel was assigned to focus on the collecting efforts in order to address the situation. 



CAF



	The administration is currently in the process of collecting the remaining outstanding accounts through the use of social media in locating their current addresses. Moreso, a quarterly report shall be submitted to the auditor to update the status of the said loans. 



Payment of Honoraria without Legal Basis



8)	Claims for honoraria of the Regional Director of CHED Region VI as resource person during board meetings amounting to P16,830.00 and P6,525.00 for CYs 2019 and 2020, respectively, were bereft of legal basis, thus, disallowable in audit.



Sections 58 and 53 of the General Provisions of the General Appropriations Act for FY 2019 and 2020, respectively, provides that honoraria may be paid only to the following:



	a)	Teaching personnel of the DepEd, TESDA, SUCs and other educational institutions, engaged in actual classroom teaching, whose teaching load is outside of the regular office hours or in excess of the regular load;



	b)	Those who act as lecturers, resource persons, coordinators and facilitators in seminars, training programs, and other similar activities in training institutions;



	c)	Chairpersons and members of commissions, boards, councils, and other similar entities, including personnel thereof who are not paid salaries, nor per diems but compensated in the form of honoraria as provided by laws, rules and regulations;



	d)	Those who are involved in science and technological activities and render services beyond their regular workload;



	e)	Officials and employees assigned to special projects, xxx; and



	f)	Officials and employees authorized to receive honoraria under R.A. No. 9184 and its IRR.



It was observed that for CY 2019 and 2020, honoraria in the amounts of P108,892.50 and P46,077.50, respectively was paid by the different SUCs to the CHED Regional Director for her attendance to SUC governing board meetings (Appendices I and I1).  Perusal of documents revealed that the CHED Regional Director attended the meetings as resource person. Among the documents provided by the agency to support the payment is CHED Resolution No. 100-2018 signed by J. Prospero E. de Vera, III, CHED Chairman, mandating all CHED Regional Directors to attend meetings of SUCs governing boards for the specific purpose of ensuring that the SUC get the certificate of program compliance first before offering any program. 



This type of honoraria is not among those enumerated in the aforecited regulations for entitlement to honorarium, thus rendering the disbursement bereft of legal basis. Total honoraria paid by West Visayas State University alone amounted to P23,355.00                           (Appendix J). 



Honoraria for those who act as lecturers and resource persons is governed by DBM Budget Circular No. 2007-1 dated April 23, 2007 which provides in part, the following:



“Section 2.3 A resource person is any person who by virtue of his /her expertise on a specific subject area, serves as speaker in seminars, conferences, symposia, training programs and similar activities



Section 4.5 Honoraria shall not be granted to the designated lecturer, resource persons and facilitators within their respective sponsoring agencies as such services are deemed part of the duties and responsibilities of their appointive positions to disseminate information, to clarify issues and concerns and to interact with clients and/or implementors of agency mandates.”



One of the functions of the CHED Regional Office is to monitor and evaluate the performance of Higher Education Institutions in the region in terms of compliance to minimum standards for various higher education programs. Thus, it can be gleaned from the foregoing that the directive of the CHED Chairman for the CHED Regional Director to attend BOR meetings is in line with the pursuance of its mandate, deemed part of the duties and responsibilities of the CHED Regional Director’s appointive position and therefore covered by limitations provided in Section 4.5 of the DBM Budget Circular No. 2007-1.



The Management commented that the Regional Director of CHED Region VI was requested to attend the Board of Regents (BOR) meetings to act as resource person considering her expertise in areas concerning course offerings, faculty accreditation, flexible learning modalities and other information needed for the meeting agenda pursuant to CHED Commission en Banc Resolution No. 100-2018.



They likewise stated that payment of honoraria to the CHED Regional Director as a resource person during BOR meetings was based on Section 4.1 of DBM Budget Circular No.2007-01 dated April 23, 2007 and given the length of time spent during the meetings which usually last from two (2) to six (6) hours and the knowledge and information she had imparted which were useful to the members of the BOR, the university was compelled to pay honoraria for her services.



Perusal of CHED Commission en Banc Resolution No. 100-2018 showed that the same mandated all CHED Regional Directors to attend SUCs governing boards meetings only for the specific purpose of ensuring that the SUC get the certificate of program compliance first before offering any program and did not imply that their attendance to every board meeting was required.



We recommended that the CHED Regional Director, Region VI settle the disallowance once the corresponding Notice of Disallowance is issued. Henceforth stop the practice of granting honoraria and other forms of allowances in the absence of legal basis.



Management Comments:



The University already stopped the payment of honoraria to the CHED Regional Director.



Unsettled Disallowances totalling P0.634 million despite issuance of NFD and COE



9)	Notice of Disallowances issued to WVSU – Main Campus totaling P0.634 million remained outstanding and uncollected despite the issuance of Notices of Finality of Decision and COA Order of Execution, contrary to the mandate on the 2009 Revised Rules of Procedures of the Commission on Audit, and Rules and Regulations on Settlement of Accounts.



Commission on Audit (COA) issued Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009 which prescribes the use of the 2009 Rules and Regulations on the Settlement of Accounts. Section 22.1 of which provides that a decision of the Commission Proper, Director or Auditor upon any matter within their respective jurisdiction, if not appealed as herein provided, shall become final and executory. The rules also state that the period to file an appeal by any person aggrieved by a disallowance or charge is within six (6) months from receipt of the notice. Consequently, the authorized COA official shall issue a Notice of Finality of Decision (NFD) to the agency head to notify that a decision of the Auditor, Director, or Commission Proper has become final and executory, there being no appeal or motion for reconsideration filed within the reglementary period. Accordingly, a COA Order of Execution (COE) shall be issued to enforce the settlement of an audit disallowance/charge, whenever the persons liable thereof refuse or fail to settle them after the decision has become final and executory.



In Section 7 of COA Circular No. 2009-006, the following are the responsibilities of the Agency Head for audit and settlement of accounts:



“7.1    Responsibility of the Agency Head



7.1.1  The head of the agency, who is primarily responsible for all government funds and property pertaining to his agency, shall ensure that: (a) x x x ; (b) the settlement of disallowances and charges is made within the prescribed period; xxx



7.1.2    x x x 



7.1.3 He shall enforce the COA Order of Execution (COE) by requiring the withholding of salaries or other compensation due the person liable in satisfaction of the disallowance or charge.



7.1.4   He shall ensure that all employees who are retiring or transferring to other agencies shall first settle the disallowances and charges for which they are liable.”



In the monitoring of settlement of suspensions/disallowances/charges of WVSU - Main Campus as of December 31, 2020, it was discovered that there were three NDs which were already issued NFDs and COEs. As of December 31, 2020, the outstanding balance of unsettled NDs with NFDs and COEs amounted to ₱0.634 million (Appendix K). The earliest date of COE was August 2, 2013, hence the Management of WVSU was given ample time to enforce the COE and collect from the persons liable their accountability on the NDs issued. 



It was also noted that some of the persons liable identified in the ND were already dead, retired from service or no longer connected with WVSU. However, there are also some persons liable who are still connected with the University but enforcement of COEs were not implemented by the University President. 



As stated in the 2009 RRSA, Section16.3, “The liability of persons determined to be liable under an ND/Notice of Charge (NC) shall be solidary and the Commission may go against any person liable without prejudice to the latter’s claim against the rest of the persons liable”. (emphasis ours) Due to the fact that it is a solidary liability, COA can demand full compliance to any of the persons determined liable in the ND and not necessarily to the payee.



Under Section 3 Rule XIII-Enforcement and Monitoring of Decisions of the 2009 RRP of COA, in case of failure of the person(s) liable to refund the amount disallowed, the COE directing the Cashier/Treasurer/Disbursing Officer to withhold payment of any money due such person(s) shall be issued. It was noted that these NDs were not subjected to any requests for installment of settlement, and so, the payment of salaries or any amount due to persons liable should have been withheld until full settlement of liability in consonance with the instructions in the COE. 



The Agency Cashier did not withhold the salaries and any amount due to persons liable and the settlement of disallowance was only made through personal payment/salary deduction of the persons liable whenever they can. The Agency head likewise was not able to ensure that all employees who are retiring or transferring to other agencies first settle the disallowances and charges for which they are liable, resulting in the non-collection of receivables from disallowance and unsettled amount.



Moreover, in the same section of COA 2009 RRP, in case of failure by the Cashier/Treasurer/Disbursing Officer to comply with the COE, the Auditor shall notify the agency head concerned of the non-compliance. At the same time, the Auditor shall report the matter through the COA Director concerned, to the General Counsel who shall take any or all of the following actions:



a)	Recommend to the Commission Proper to cite defaulting party in contempt;

b)	Refer the matter to the Solicitor General for the filing of appropriate civil suit; 

c)	Refer the case to the Ombudsman for the filing of appropriate administrative or criminal action.



The Management stated that despite the collection from the accountable personnel, some were already separated from the University upon issuance of the COE. Thus, demand for payment will be made when they process their clearances and any amount due them shall be withheld until their balances are settled. Moreover, collection letters will be sent to their addresses indicated on the 201 files.



We recommended and management agreed to:



a)	enforce the collection of disallowed amounts on Notice of Disallowances that were already issued with Notices of Finality of Decision and COA Order of Execution by sending notice/letter of demand to persons liable to settle their disallowances especially to those who are no longer employees of the agency;



b)	instruct the Cashier to withhold payment of salary and other money due to persons liable, and in case of refusal or failure to settle, demand compliance from any of the persons determined solidarily liable; 



c)	ensure that enforcement of subsequent NFDs and COEs be implemented in accordance with the 2009 Revised Rules of Procedures of COA and 2009 Rules and Regulations on Settlement of Accounts.



Management Comments:



	As of February 26, 2021, the total amount collected is P6,422,059.88 and the updated remaining balance totaled P383,340.12. 



Auditors’ Rejoinder:



The difference between the balances reflected in the Audit Team and Accounting Office records pertains to payments made by persons liable not forwarded to the Office of the Auditor for issuance of the Notice of Settlement of Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges (NSSDC). 



Delayed/Non-Submission of Disbursement Vouchers



10)	Delayed/Non-submission of 701 CY 2020 Disbursement Vouchers (DVs) and their corresponding supporting documents as well as the Reports of Checks Issued (RCI) of the WVSU – Himamaylan Campus totaling P17.586 million within the reglementary period, contrary to pertinent provisions of COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009, precluded the timely audit and verification of the transactions of the campus.



Section 7.1.1 (a) of COA Circular No. 2009-006 or The 2009 Revised Rules and Regulations on the Settlement of Accounts approved on September 15, 2009 states: 



“The head of the agency, who is primarily responsible for all government funds and property pertaining to his agency, shall ensure that the required financial and other reports and statements are submitted by the concerned agency officials in such form and within the period prescribed by the Commission”.



Moreover, Section 7.2.1 (a) of the said circular requires that “The Chief Accountant, Bookkeeper or other authorized official performing accounting and/or bookkeeping functions of the audited agency shall ensure that the reports and supporting documents submitted by the Accountable officers are immediately recorded in the books of accounts and submitted to the Auditor within the first ten (10) days of the ensuing month.



Perusal of the records revealed that despite the relaxation of the deadlines on the submission of reports due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there was delay and/or non-submission of Disbursement Vouchers and their supporting documents as well as the Report of Checks Issued for CY 2020. Status of the submission of WVSU –Himamaylan Campus as of February 26, 2021 is shown in Appendix L.



The management of WVSU – Himamaylan Campus remarked that they were not able to submit the disbursement vouchers (DVs) due to travel/border restrictions during the pandemic. In partial compliance, soft copies of the RCIs were sent through electronic mail. The administration further assured that more effort will be exerted into the timely submission of DVs and all supporting documents.



The non-submission of the Disbursement Vouchers within the prescribed deadlines, precluded the prompt audit of accounts and financial transactions and the review to determine compliance with applicable rules and regulations, hence, resulted in the difficulty of establishing the legality and validity of the transactions. Likewise, it affected the timing of validation of Management’s assertions on regularity of its transactions and fairness of presentation of accounts for the year under audit.



We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Accountants of the campuses to immediately submit to the Auditor the CY 2020 Reports of Check Issued and disbursement vouchers with their supporting documents after recording in the books of accounts, to facilitate the determination of the legality and validity of the transactions.



Henceforth, paid disbursement vouchers and their corresponding supporting documents as well as the Reports of Check Issued should be submitted within the first ten days (10) days of the ensuing month.



Procurement of Goods and Services through Reimbursements



11)	Reimbursements were claimed for the procurement of goods and services of the WVSU Main Campus totaling P0.854 million contrary to Rules IV and XVI of the Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of Republic Act No. 9184, thereby precluded the agency in availing the most advantageous prices for the government.



Section 10 of the Revised IRR of RA No. 1984 states that all procurement should be done through Competitive Bidding, except when certain unique circumstances require the use of alternative methods of procurement, the selection of which is dependent on the presence or absence of specific conditions, justifying a particular mode. 









Section 48, Rule XVI of the same IRR likewise provides that:



“48.1. Subject to the prior approval of the Head of the Procuring Entity, and whenever justified by the conditions provided in this Act, the procuring entity may, in order to promote economy and efficiency, resort to any of the alternative methods of procurement provided in this Rule. In all instances, the procuring entity shall ensure that the most advantageous price for the Government is obtained.



48.2.  In accordance with Section 10 of this IRR, as a general rule, the Procuring Entities shall adopt public bidding as the general mode of procurement and shall see to it that the procurement program allows sufficient lead time for such public bidding. Alternative methods shall be resorted to only in the highly exceptional cases provided for in this Rule. 



48.3.  The method of procurement to be used shall be as indicated in the approved APP. xxx.” 



Audit of the financial transactions of the Campus for CY 2020 revealed that a total amount of P0.854 million (Appendix M) was paid for purchases of goods and services through reimbursements, without public bidding or adoption of any alternative mode of procurement allowed by law.  



The practice of payment for goods and services through reimbursement was contrary to the rules and procedures prescribed in R.A. No. 9184, thus transparency and economy was not assured, there being no basis in ascertaining the reasonableness of prices. 



The Management clarified that procurement of goods and services through reimbursement could not be avoided due to time limitation in the conduct of some activities.  However, RA No. 9184 specified that all procurement should be meticulously and judiciously planned by the procuring entity to allow sufficient time for the conduct of public bidding or adoption of any of the alternative methods of procurement.



We recommended and management agreed to resort to public bidding or any of the alternative modes of procurement for the purchase of goods and services pursuant to the IRR of Republic Act No. 9184, to ensure that the most advantageous price for the government is obtained.





























Delayed Submission of BRS of WVSU - Pototan Campus



12)	Delayed submission of monthly Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS) for six (6) depository accounts of the Campus to the Office of the Auditor as required under Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume I, precluded the verification of the accuracy of the cash balance of the Campus totaling P14.391 million as per year-end Trial Balance. 



Section 7, Chapter 21, of the GAM, Volume I, provides that:



Reporting. The Chief Accountant shall submit the BRS within twenty days after receipt of the monthly BS to the following:



Original – COA Auditor (with all the supporting documents and JEVs)

Copy 2 – Head of Agency/Entity

Copy 3 – Accounting Division/Unit file

Copy 4 – Bank, if necessary



Perusal of our records showed that there is a substantial delay in the submission of the required monthly Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS) to the Office of the Auditor, as the following were submitted simultaneously only on December 14, 2020:



Bank/Branch

Likewise, the remaining Bank Reconciliation Statements for calendar year 2020 were submitted to the Office of the Auditor only on February 22, 2021. Furthermore, the submitted BRS were not supported with complete documents as well as Journal Entry Vouchers.



The Bank Reconciliation Statement reconciles the cash balance per Agency books vis-à-vis the balance per bank statement. Consequently, non-reconciliation of the Cash balances per books and per bank rendered doubtful the accuracy of the Cash-in-Bank accounts of the Campus totaling P14.391 million as per December 2020 financial statements.



The Accountant of the WVSU – Pototan Campus explained that the delay in the preparation and submission of monthly BRS was mainly due to late receipts of bank statements.  However, online access to bank statements for LBP accounts can be requested from depository bank to comply with the deadline

 

We recommended and management agreed to:



				a)	submit of the Monthly Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS) for all depository accounts together with all the supporting documents and JEVs within the reglementary period, to facilitate verification of the accuracy of the cash balance per books and per bank; and



				b)	coordinate with the Agency’s LBP depository branch for enrollment to LANDBANK weAccess, an internet banking facility developed for the bank’s institutional clients, so that access to bank statements can made at any given time.





Balances of Receivables not supported with Subsidiary Ledgers



13)	Receivables – Disallowances/Charges and Other Receivables of WVSU – Lambunao and Janiuay  Campuses amounting to P0.676 million and P124,500.00, respectively were without subsidiary ledgers (SL) contrary to Section 111 (1) of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1445 and Appendix 6 of GAM, Volume II, thus, completeness and accuracy of the receivable accounts could not be established. 



Section 111 (1) of Presidential Decree No. 1445 requires the keeping of accounts of the agency in such detail as is necessary to meet the needs of the agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or control agencies of the government.



Appendix 6 of GAM, Volume II also requires the preparation of the SL per account and fund, and the monthly reconciliation of the SL with the General Ledger (GL) controlling account.



Audit of the Receivables – Disallowances/Charges and Other Receivables accounts of the WVSU-Janiuay and Lambunao Campuses revealed that the Management could not support the balances of P0.676 million and P124,500.00, respectively, with schedules extracted from subsidiary records since no subsidiary ledgers were maintained for the receivable accounts, hence, the same could not be verified nor confirmed. Details of the receivable accounts for each campus are as follows:  



Account

Campus

Total



Janiuay

Lambunao



Receivables - Disallowances/Charges

        167,305.28

       509,087.66 

      676,392.94 

Other Receivables



       124,500.00 

124,500.00

TOTAL

167,305.28

       633,587.66 

   800,892.94 



The absence of the subsidiary ledgers rendered the Receivables – Disallowances/Charges and Other Receivables balances unreliable since the completeness and accuracy of the said accounts could not be established. Likewise, collectability was not ensured in the absence of details of these receivables.



The Accounting Department of WVSU – Lambunao Campus tried to retrieve the records of the receivables but was only able to come up with a list of debtors of the receivable balances. They committed to continue to trace the supporting documents to establish the details and ascertain the accuracy of said accounts.



We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Accountants to exert efforts in tracing the supporting documents in order to come up with Subsidiary Ledgers for the recorded Receivables – Disallowances/Charges and Other Receivables.









Long outstanding Accounts Payable



14)	The total liabilities in the Statement of Financial Position as at December 31, 2020 of West Visayas State University (WVSU) System amounting to ₱250.927 million included payables which have been outstanding for more than two years totaling P4.010, million, thus, rendered unreliable the fairness of presentation of the liability accounts in the financial statements of the Agency.



Section 98 of P.D. No. 1445 provides: 



“Reversion of unliquidated balances of accounts payable. The Commission, upon notice to the head of agency concerned, may revert to the unappropriated surplus of the general fund of the national government, any unliquidated balance of accounts payable in the books of the national government, which has been outstanding for two years or more and against which no actual claim, administrative or judicial, has been filed or which is not covered by perfected contracts on record. xxx”



Likewise, Section 1 of Executive Order No. 109 dated June 10, 1999 provides:



“Section 1. Reversion of Accounts Payable. All 1995 and prior years documented accounts payable and all undocumented accounts payable regardless of the year they were incurred shall be reverted to the Cumulative Result of Operations of the National Government. Henceforth, all documented accounts payable which have remained outstanding for two years shall be reverted to the Cumulative Result of Operations of the National Government. Likewise, the practice of booking up undocumented accounts payable shall be strictly prohibited.” 

	

Further, pertinent guidelines of Department of Budget and Management (DBM)-COA Joint Circular No. 99-6 dated November 13, 1999 regarding reversion of accounts payable are as follows:



“3.0 GENERAL GUIDELINES



3.1. All documented A/Ps of all funds which have remained outstanding for two (2) years shall be reverted to the Cumulative Results of Operations – Unappropriated (CROU) except on-going capital outlays projects.



3.2 xxxx



3.3 All undocumented A/Ps, regardless of the year they were incurred, shall immediately be reverted to the CROU.



3.4 Payables representing unliquidated advances, prepayments and deposits shall be reviewed and appropriate adjustments accordingly taken in the books of accounts in accordance with accounting and auditing rules and regulations.”



3.5 xxxx

3.6 xxxx



3.7 All A/Ps that were reverted to the CROU and which have been determined to be legitimate shall be charged against the appropriate lump-sum provided for the purpose.”

          

Review of the WVSU Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as at December 31, 2020 and its supporting schedules disclosed that out of the balance of Total Accounts Payable of ₱250.927 million, ₱4.010 million or 1.60 percent are aged over two years. The long-outstanding liabilities pertain to payables to 504 various creditors (Appendix N). The inclusion of accounts payable aging two years or more in the balance of Total Liabilities rendered unreliable the fair presentation of the account in the financial statements as at year end.



During the exit conference with the officials of the University on March 16, 2021, the Accountants stated that they were hesitant to revert accounts payable that has been outstanding for two years or more to the surplus account since these were documented payables, pertained to known creditors and there is a possibility of claim in the future.



We recommended and Management agreed to the following:



a)	A review of the recorded Accounts Payable be made by the Accountants in order to determine the validity of claims and completeness of documents on file; and



b)	Cause the reversion of payables two years old or over and against which no actual claim, administrative or judicial, has been filed or which is not covered by perfected contracts on record as mandated by DBM-COA Joint Circular No. 99-6 and Section 98 of PD No. 1445.



Non-derecognition of Unserviceable Properties



15)	Unserviceable properties totaling P0.937 million of the WVSU-Pototan Campus were not disposed of immediately and derecognized from the books of accounts, contrary to Section 79 of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1445, thus, overstating the Property, Plant and Equipment account and exposing properties to risk of further deterioration or decrease in value.



Section 79 of P.D. No. 1445 states, “When government property has become unserviceable for any cause, or is no longer needed, it shall, upon application of the officer accountable therefore, be inspected by the head of the agency or his duly authorized representative in the presence of the auditor concerned and, if found to be valueless or unsalable, it may be destroyed in their presence. If found to be valuable, it may be sold at public auction to the highest bidder under the supervision of the proper committee on award or similar body in the presence of the auditor concerned or other duly authorized representative of the Commission, after advertising by printed notice in the Official Gazette, or for not less than three consecutive days in any newspaper of general circulation, or where the value of the property does not warrant the expense of publication, by notices posted for a like period in at least three public places in the locality where the property is to be sold.”



Chapter 10 Section 40 of GAM, also provides policies on unserviceable properties. It states that, if a PPE is no longer capable of providing the entity with future economic benefits or service potential, it is said to be unserviceable. All unserviceable property shall be reported in the Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) (Appendix 74). Section 39.e of the same manual provides that the disposal procedures of unserviceable property shall be in accordance with applicable rules and regulations on Supply and Property Management Manual and Section 79 of P.D. No. 1445.



Audit disclosed that of the P0.937 million unserviceable properties of the campus (Appendix O) as of December 31, 2020, only P163,761.00 worth of properties determined to be unserviceable in CY 2018 and prior years were disposed through sale during the year, leaving a balance of undisposed properties of P0.773 million at year end. However, the total amount of P0.937 million remained in the books of the agency as part of PPE account.



Non-disposal of unserviceable properties which are beyond economic repair could result in further deterioration and diminishing values of the properties due to natural wear and tear, thereby depriving the agency of the benefits that could be derived from its disposal. Moreover, non-derecognition of these items does not reflect the true valuation of the recorded PPE.



The Supply Office of WVSU – Pototan Campus remarked that due to the limitations provided by the COVID-19 pandemic and adoption of alternative work arrangements (Work-from-Home and Skeletal Workforce), members of the Appraisal and Disposal Committee were not able to convene and conduct inspection/appraisal of unserviceable properties which is one of the requirements for the request for disposal to the Commission on Audit.



We recommended and Management agreed to:



1)	Direct the Appraisal and Disposal Committee to conduct inspection/appraisal and provide valuation on unserviceable properties; 



2)	Request in writing for the disposal of the unserviceable properties to the COA Office so that inspection could be done and the Campus could maximize whatever value they could realize from its sale or disposition; and 



3)	Require the Accountant to derecognize from the books of accounts the corresponding value of the disposed properties.









































WVSU - MEDICAL CENTER AND NEWBORN SCREENING CENTER – VISAYAS (NSCV)



Unreliable accuracy and existence of PPE due to non-conduct of physical count 



16)	Non-preparation of the CY 2020 Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) for properties amounting to ₱118.356 million of the Newborn Screening Center – Visayas, and deficiencies in the control mechanisms, contrary to Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume I, Chapter 10, Sections 38 and 42, rendered unreliable the year-end PPE account balances.



Section 38 Chapter 10 of GAM, Volume I, requires that “the entity shall have a periodic physical count of PPE, which shall be done annually and presented on the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) (Appendix 73) as at December 31 of each year. This shall be submitted to the Auditor concerned not later than January 31 of the following year. Equipment found at station and losses discovered during the physical count shall be reported to the Accounting Division/Unit for proper accounting/recording”.



Section 42 of the same Chapter in GAM, Volume I states that the “Chief Accountant shall maintain the Property Plant and Equipment Ledger Card (PPELC) for each category of PPE including work and other animals, livestock etc. The PPELC shall be kept to record promptly the acquisition, description, custody, estimated useful life, depreciation, impairment loss, disposal and other information about the asset. For check and balance, the Property and Supply Office/Unit shall likewise maintain PC for PPE in their custody to account for the receipt and disposition of the same. The balance per PC shall be reconciled with PPELC maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit. They shall also be reconciled with other property records like PAR.”



Verification of accounts revealed that RPCPPE for the Center’s properties totaling ₱118.356 million was not submitted as of January 31, 2020.  These significant amounts were reflected in the Center’s financial statements without ascertaining the actual existence and correctness of the property records by conducting an actual physical count of the Agency’s property, plant and equipment.  The Financial Statements as of December 31, 2020 showed the following balances:

The Agency Action Plan and Status of Implementation (AAPSI) for CY 2019 recommendations submitted by the Management stated that the task was very voluminous and time consuming and was suspended due to pandemic.  However, records of this Office disclosed that conduct of the physical count of PPE as well as the preparation and submission of the RPCPPE was not made since CY 2018.



Moreover, Property Plant and Equipment Ledger Cards (PPELC) for each category of PPE and the Property Cards (PC) were not updated regularly by the Accounting and Supply Offices, respectively.



Reconciliation of records between the Accounting and Property unit is important to establish the accuracy of the recorded amount of Property, Plant and Equipment. It also provides check and balance as to reliability of the PPE account balances reflected in the financial statements. The absence of report from either unit impedes the reconciliation process.



On the other hand, physical Inventory-taking is an indispensable procedure for validating existence and property custodianship. Consequently, said accounts should be given utmost importance, considering the materiality of the amount of the PPE in the financial statements.



As a result of the above deficiencies, accuracy and reliability of PPE balances as of December 31, 2020 could not be established.  



The Management claimed that a Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment for properties of NSCV was already prepared and submitted to the Inventory Committee for signature.  However, minor errors were noted, hence, it was returned to the NSCV for correction, causing the delay of its submission.



We recommended and Management agreed to:



a)		Direct the Inventory Committee to complete the conduct of inventory and preparation of the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment as of December 31, 2020;

	

b)		Require the Accountant and Supply Officer to regularly update the PPE Ledger Cards and Property Cards, respectively and ensure that PPELCs and PCs are accomplished with complete and necessary data; and

	

c)		Submit to the Office of the Auditor a workplan for the conduct of reconciliation with corresponding timelines indicating therein the persons responsible for this task.



	Unreconciled Online Deposits amounting to P26.723 million.



17)	Cash in Bank and Government Income/Equity accounts of the Newborn Screening Center – Visayas (NSCV) were understated due to outstanding unreconciled online deposits totaling P26.723 million which remained unadjusted in the latest Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS), thus, the accounts are not fairly presented in the Financial Statements contrary to the pertinent provisions of Government Accounting Manual.



Section 15, Chapter II of Government Accounting Manual for NGAS Volume I states that:



“The FSs shall present fairly the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in PPSAS. The application of PPSAS, with appropriate disclosures, if necessary, would result in fair presentation of the FS.”



Moreover, Sections 58 and 60 of PD No. 1445 provide among others that:



“The examination and audit of assets shall be performed with a view to ascertaining their existence ownership, valuation and encumbrances as well as the propriety of items composing the respective asset accounts, determining their agreement with records; proving the accuracy of such records; ascertaining if the assets were utilized economically, efficiently and effectively; and evaluating the adequacy of controls over the accounts. 



The examination and audit of revenue accounts shall be performed with a view to ascertaining that earned revenues have been duly recorded; and all recorded revenues have been earned and appropriate classifications of revenues have been consistently followed.”



It was observed that the Center did not implement the recommendation of the Audit Team in the previous years’ Annual Audit Reports to take up various reconciling items totaling P5.952 million for the period January 2015 to December 2019 as shown in the BRS, details of which are as shown in Appendix P and summarized below:

These reconciling items were deposits made to the Center’s depository banks representing online payments by facilities which have availed of the services offered by the Center. Such remained unreconciled and unrecorded because the Center was having difficulty in tracing the deposits since some facilities were not able to provide or send the deposit slips. To avoid accumulation of these unreconciled deposits, the Audit Team already recommended the use of accrual basis of accounting and to set up receivables for services rendered as provided for in the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) since CY 2015.



Section 6, Chapter 2, Volume I of Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs) provides the basic government accounting and budget reporting principles, on which each entity shall recognize and present its financial transactions and operation. One of the basic principles adopted in GAM is the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS).



Accrual basis has been defined in IPSAS 1 - Presentation of Financial Statements as follows:



“Accrual basis means a basis of accounting under which transactions and other events are recognized when they occur (and not only when cash or its equivalent is received or paid). Therefore, the transactions and events are recorded in the accounting records and recognized in the financial statements of the periods to which they relate. The elements recognized under accrual accounting are assets, liabilities, net assets/equity, revenue, and expenses.” (Emphasis supplied)



Non-observance on the use of accrual basis of accounting resulted in difficulty in reconciling these online deposits as they could not identify the facility which made the deposit.



Moreover, BRS for the period January to April 2020 disclosed additional unreconciled online payments totaling P20.771 million (Appendix P)  which were not yet recorded and issued Official Receipts bringing the total unreconciled online deposits to P26.723 million as of April 30, 2020, as shown below:

*latest submitted Bank Reconciliation Statement is for April 2020

The practice of waiting for facilities who availed of the services of the Center to send validated deposit slips as basis for recording receipt of cash and corresponding income account as well as the refusal to use the accrual basis of accounting in which accounts receivable and the corresponding income account are recorded when services have been rendered, resulted in accumulation of unreconciled online deposits.



Since the Center was not able to resolve these unadjusted online deposit, it resulted in the understatement of Cash in Bank and Government Equity accounts and such affected the reliability, accuracy, and fair presentation of the financial statements of the Center particularly on the years when income was earned.



We recommended and Management agreed to:



1)	Require the Accountant to trace the unrecorded deposits and effect the necessary adjusting entries in the books to update the balances of the accounts affected;



2)	Direct the Accountant to use accrual basis of accounting and set up accounts receivables for services rendered by the Center; and 



3)	Review the procedures in the recording of payments from clientele to ensure that all deposits in NSCV’s accounts are properly recorded on time and reconciled with bank records.



Management Comments:



The Management informed that the Center will hire additional personnel to monitor the Accounts Receivables account. Moreover, the same program used by the WVSU Medical Center will be utilized by the NSCV for the monitoring and reporting of its receivables.

























Payment of COVID-19 Hazard Pay not in accordance with DBM BC No. 2020-1



18)	The grant of COVID-19 Hazard Pay to the personnel of West Visayas State University Medical Center (WVSUMC) and Newborn Screening Center – Visayas (NSCV) amounting to P12.204 million was not in accordance with Administrative Order No. 26 and DBM Budget Circular No. 2020-1 dated, resulting in difficulty in ascertaining the propriety of the amount disbursed and excess payments totaling P1.547 million.



DBM Budget Circular (BC) No. 2020-1 dated March 24, 2020 sets the guidelines and conditions on the grant of COVID-19 hazard pay. Sections 1.1 and 4.3 of which states: 



“Administrative Order (AO) No. 26 dated March 23, 2020 authorizes the grant of Hazard Pay, to be called as COVID-19 Hazard Pay, to government employees and workers engaged through contract of service (COS) or job order (JO) basis who physically report for work during the implementation of an Enhanced Community Quarantine in their respective work stations, in an amount not exceeding P500/day per person”.



 “The personnel/workers have been authorized to physically report for work at their respective offices or work stations on the prescribed official hours by the head of the agency/office during the period of implementation of Enhanced Community Quarantine/Quarantine measures in the area of such office or work station.”



Moreover, Section 4.5 of the same circular provides that, “Personnel who are already entitled to Hazard Pay, Hazardous Duty Pay, Hazard Allowance, or other similar benefits under existing laws, issuances, rules, and regulations such as public health workers, public social workers, science and technology personnel, and military and uniformed personnel, shall continue to be entitled to such benefits or the COVID-19 Hazard Pay, whichever is higher.” (emphasis supplied)



It can be gleaned from the foregoing provisions that the three requirements for the grant of COVID-19 hazard pay are as follows:



1)	Authority to physically report to Office from the head of the agency;

2)	Use of prescribed office hours; and

3)	Work related to the implementation of Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) measures in the area.



Post-audit of disbursements relative to grant of COVID-19 Hazard Pay for the period March 18, 2020 to May 15, 2020 disclosed that WVSUMC and NSCV paid their personnel  a total amount of P12.204 million as follows:

Likewise, we have noted that required supporting documents for the payment of the COVID-19 Hazard Pay were not attached as follows:



1)	A Memorandum/office order or any other document authorizing the personnel concerned to physically report for work at their respective work station issued by the Head of the Agency;



2)	Daily Time Records (DTR) of all personnel; and 



3)	Accomplishment reports or certification of services rendered of all personnel who were granted the COVID-19 hazard pay.



In the absence of the above documents, the determination of work done and ascertaining whether these relates to the performance of the official functions of the personnel during the implementation of ECQ measures as required by the regulations, could not be facilitated.



Moreover, evaluation of the total disbursement of P12.403 million, revealed the following deficiencies:



A)	Computation for the  payment of COVID-19 Hazard Pay of the WVSUMC was not in accordance with DBM BC 2020-1, resulting in excess payment totaling P1.547 million, summarized as follows:

Management stated that their computation for the claim was based on the difference between the daily COVID-19 Hazard Pay rate of P500.00 and the daily regular hazard pay (monthly hazard pay/no. of working days for the month) multiplied by the number of days the personnel physically reported for work.



However, DBM Budget Circular No.  2020-1 provides that personnel already entitled to Hazard Pay shall continue to receive such benefit or the COVID-19 Hazard Pay, whichever is higher. Since the Magna Carta Hazard Pay was paid on a monthly basis, then it followed that the computation should be the difference between the total COVID-19 Hazard Pay for the month and the monthly Magna Carta Hazard Pay.









B)	The computed COVID-19 hazard pay claimed by the Medical Officer and Specialists of WVSUMC and NSCV personnel amounting to P1.209 million lacked details pertaining to the actual number of days they physically reported to work; hence propriety of the grant could not be validated. 



Moreover, these personnel were also paid their regular monthly hazard pay for the months of March to May 2020, hence, there is a need to determine whether the COVID-19 Hazard Pay claimed exceeded the allowable rate per DBM BC No. 2020-1.



The above conditions did not meet the requirements set forth in DBM Budget Circular No. 2020-1, thus the propriety of the amount disbursed could not be ascertained.



We recommended that Management:



	a)	Require the Human Resource and Management Officer/Accountant to submit supporting documents required by the DBM BC No. 2020-1 such as authority to physically report for work from the Head of Agency, Daily Time Records and Accomplishment Report/Certification of services rendered for the period March 20 to May 15, 2020;



	b)	Direct the Accountant to review the computation of Hazard Pay for Administrative and Finance, Ancillary Service and NSO  personnel and submit justifications on the noted deficiency;



	c)	Require the Human Resource and Management Officer to submit complete details as to the computation of COVID Hazard Pay for Medical Personnel/Specialists and NSCV Personnel indicating therein the actual number of days the personnel physically reported for work; and



	d)	Be more vigilant in the implementation of laws, rules and regulations and exercise due diligence in the disbursement of government funds to avoid suspension or disallowance in audit of financial transactions.



Management Comments:



It was informed that the Daily Time Records can be referred to the supporting documents attached for the payments of monthly salary of WVSUMC personnel for the period March to May 2020 while the Accomplishment Reports were submitted by each personnel to the Human Resource Department. These supporting documents will be submitted, if necessary.



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



Every disbursement of government funds required that it be supported with complete documents before payment, hence, submission of required documents for the payment of COVID-19 Hazard Pay such as daily time records and accomplishment reports is necessary to ascertain the propriety of the amount paid. 











	Doubtful accuracy and existence of Inventories totalling P43.296 million. 

	

19)	The reliability, existence and completeness of the Inventory accounts totaling ₱43.296 million of WVSU Medical Center could not be established due to the unreconciled balances between the financial statements and the Report on the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) contrary to the provisions of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies.



Section 13, Chapter 8 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) Volume I provides the guidelines on Inventory Accounting System which consists of the system of monitoring, controlling and recording of acquisition and disposal of inventory.  It also states that physical count/inventory, which is required semi-annually, is an indispensable procedure for checking the integrity of property custodianship.



Among the Records, Forms and Reports to be prepared and/or maintained by the Agency, as required in Section 17, Chapter 8 of GAM, are the following:



a)	Stock Card (SC) (Appendix 58) – shall be used to record all receipts and issues of supplies and the balance in quantity at any time. It shall be maintained by the Property and/or Supply Division/Unit for each item in stock. The Inspection and Acceptance Report (IAR), Requisition and Issue Slip (RIS), Purchase Order (PO) and Delivery Receipt (DR) serve as the original sources of information for making entries on the card.  



b)	Supplies Ledger Card (SLC) (Appendix 57) – shall be used to record materials received, issued and the balance both in quantity and amount at any time.  It shall be maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit for each kind of supplies and materials. The IAR, RIS, Report of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI), PO and DR serve as the original sources of information for making entries on the card.  



c)	xxx



d)	Report on the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) (Appendix 66) – shall be used to report the physical count of supplies by type of inventory as at a given date.  It shows the balance of inventory items per card and per count and shortage/overage, if any. These include the semi-expendable property wherein the issue is covered by ICS. 



The RPCI shall be prepared semi-annually by the Inventory Committee and by fund cluster.  The report shall be reconciled with the Supplies Ledger Card and Stock Cards maintained by the Accounting Unit and Supply Unit, respectively. Any discrepancy shall be verified and/or adjusted accordingly.  It shall be prepared in four copies and certified correct by the Inventory Committee, approved by the Head of Agency or his/her authorized representative, and verified by the COA Auditor. 



The RPCI shall be submitted to the COA Auditor concerned not later than July 31 and January 31 of each year for the first and second semesters, respectively.



Verification of the submitted financial statements and RPCI of the Medical Center for CY 2020 disclosed that Inventory Accounts with total recorded amount of ₱43.296 million was not reconciled with the RPCI submitted by the Supply Office totaling ₱23.375 million, resulting to a discrepancy of  ₱19.921 million or 46.01 percent of total inventories. The details of the discrepancy are as follows:

It is noteworthy to mention that the Agency was able to reconcile the Inventory accounts for CY 2019. However, the personnel in-charge in the Accounting Unit was promoted and transferred to the Budget Department last July 2020, thus interrupting the regular reconciliation by the Accounting and the Supply Units, pending replacement of the personnel-in-charge. 



Likewise, we have noted that the Supplies Ledger Cards (SLCs) and Stock Cards (SCs) were not updated by the Accounting and the Supply Units, respectively. This further precludes the agency from performing effective asset reconciliation, counterchecking, and tracking the movement of its inventories.  



Non-reconciliation of the recorded Inventory in the financial statements and the RPCI rendered unreliable the fair presentation of the Inventory account in the financial statement of the Medical Center.



We recommended that Management:



a)		Assign a personnel in-charge in the Accounting Unit to regularly update the Supply Ledger Cards and ensure that SLCs are accomplished with complete and necessary data;

	

b)		Require the Supply Office to regularly update the Stock Cards;

	

c)		Submit a workplan for the conduct of reconciliation of Inventories with corresponding timelines indicating therein the persons responsible.

	

Management Comments:



The Management informed that the reconciliation process is still on going and progress reports will then be submitted to the Office of the Auditor regularly.















Unreliable accuracy and existence of PPE totalling P862.294 million



20)	The reliability, existence and completeness of the WVSU Medical Center’s Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) totaling ₱862.294 million could not be established due to unreconciled balances totaling ₱110.263 between the financial statements and the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) contrary to the provisions of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume I.

	     

Section 38 Chapter 10 of GAM, Volume I, requires that “the entity shall have a periodic physical count of PPE, which shall be done annually and presented on the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) (Appendix 73) as at December 31 of each year. This shall be submitted to the Auditor concerned not later than January 31 of the following year. Equipment found at station and losses discovered during the physical count shall be reported to the Accounting Division/Unit for proper accounting/recording”.



Section 42 of the same Chapter in GAM, Volume I states that the “Chief Accountant shall maintain the Property Plant and Equipment Ledger Card (PPELC) for each category of PPE including work and other animals, livestock etc. The PPELC shall be kept to record promptly the acquisition, description, custody, estimated useful life, depreciation, impairment loss, disposal and other information about the asset. For check and balance, the Property and Supply Office/Unit shall likewise maintain PC for PPE in their custody to account for the receipt and disposition of the same. The balance per PC shall be reconciled with PPELC maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit. They shall also be reconciled with other property records like PAR.”

		

Verification of the submitted financial statements (FS) of the Medical Center for CY 2020 disclosed that recorded PPE accounts totaling of ₱862.294 million was not reconciled with the RPCPPE submitted by the Supply Office totaling ₱752.031 million. The details of the discrepancy totaling ₱110.263 millions are shown in Appendix T.



The Accounting and Supply Units of the Medical Center were already able to undertake the required reconciliation between the Accounting and Property records for Construction & Heavy Equipment and Motor Vehicles accounts amounting to ₱41,950.00 and ₱8.525 million, respectively as of December 31, 2019. However, since Property Plant and Equipment Ledger Cards (PPELC) for each category of PPE and the Property Cards (PC) were not updated regularly by the Accounting and Supply Offices, respectively, a variance of ₱59,000.00 for Motor Vehicles was noted as of December 31, 2020.



Reconciliation of records between the Accounting and Property units is important to establish the accuracy of the recorded amount of Property, Plant and Equipment. It also provides check and balance as to reliability of the PPE account balances reflected in the financial statements.



For CY 2020, the Accounting and Supply Sections of the Medical Center was not able to undertake the required reconciliation between the Accounting and Property records for the PPE accounts.  As a result, substantial discrepancies still exist between the two records especially for the accounts “Hospital and Health Centers”, “Machinery”, “Information and Communication Technology Equipment”, “Medical Equipment” and “Furniture & Fixtures”.



As a result of the above deficiencies, accuracy and reliability of PPE balances as of December 31, 2020 could not be relied upon.  



We recommended and Management agreed to:



1)	Require the Accountant and Supply Officer to update the PPE Ledger Cards and Property Cards, respectively and ensure that PPELCs and PCs are accomplished with complete and necessary data; 

	

2)	Direct the Accountant and Supply Officer to reconcile the PPE Ledger Cards and the Property Cards to ensure reliability of the year-end PPE account balances; and



3)	Submit to the Office of the Auditor a workplan for the conduct of reconciliation with corresponding timelines indicating therein the persons responsible.



4)	Require concerned agency officials to submit to the Auditor progress report on the reconciliation together with the supporting documents.



Management Comments:



The management will prepare the Physical Inventory Plan (PIP) for the cleansing of PPE accounts in accordance with COA Circular No. 2020-006 dated January 31, 2020.





Delayed/Non-Submission of Disbursement Vouchers



21)	Delayed or non-submission of Disbursement Vouchers (DVs) and their corresponding supporting documents of the WVSUMC and NSCV totaling P1.289 billion and P241.440 million, respectively, contrary to the pertinent provisions of COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009, precluded the prompt audit of accounts and timely reporting of the audit results to the management.



Section 7.1.1 (a) of COA Circular No. 2009-006 or The 2009 Revised Rules and Regulations on the Settlement of Accounts approved on September 15, 2009 states: 



“The head of the agency, who is primarily responsible for all government funds and property pertaining to his agency, shall ensure that the required financial and other reports and statements are submitted by the concerned agency officials in such form and within the period prescribed by the Commission”.



Moreover, Section 7.2.1 (a) of the said circular requires that “The Chief Accountant, Bookkeeper or other authorized official performing accounting and/or bookkeeping functions of the audited agency shall ensure that the reports and supporting documents submitted by the Accountable officers are immediately recorded in the books of accounts and submitted to the Auditor within the first ten (10) days of the ensuing month.”



Perusal of our records disclosed that despite the relaxation of the deadlines on the submission of reports due to the COVID-19 pandemic, substantial delays ranging from 17 to 130 days was incurred by the WVSUMC in the submission of 3,040 DVs totaling P992.938 million while 776 DVs amounting to P296.461 million were still not submitted to the Office of the Auditor as of February 26, 2021 (see Appendix U for details).

Section 127 of PD 1445 states that, xxx “any unjustified failure by the public officer concerned to comply with any requirement imposed in this Code shall constitute neglect of duty and shall be a ground for administrative disciplinary action against the said public officer who, upon being found guilty thereof after hearing, shall be meted out such penalty as is commensurate with the degree of his guilt in accordance with the Civil Service Law. Repeated unjustified failure to comply with the requirements imposed in this Code shall be conclusive proof that the public officer concerned is notoriously undesirable.”



The delayed or non-submission of the Disbursement Vouchers within the prescribed deadlines, precluded the prompt audit of accounts and financial transactions and the review to determine compliance with applicable rules and regulations, hence, resulted in the difficulty of ascertaining the legality and validity of the transactions. Likewise, it affected the timing of validation of Management’s assertions on regularity of its transactions and fairness of presentation of accounts for the current year under audit.



We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountants to immediately submit the disbursement vouchers complete with supporting documents and strictly comply with the deadline set by the regulations.



Moreover, the Head of Agency should take appropriate action against concerned officials and employees for the repeated failure to adhere to regulations on the submission of disbursement vouchers and their supporting documents, in pursuance of Section 127 of PD No. 1445.



Management Comments:



WVSU Medical Center



The Accounting Department committed to submit disbursement vouchers for the period September to December 2020.



NSCV



The delay in the submission of disbursement vouchers (DVs) for CY 2020 is primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As the Center caters to the three (3) regions in the Visayas and with the implementation of lockdowns and border restrictions, certain transactions were affected and contributed to unavoidable delay in the submission of DVs. Likewise contributing to the delay was the temporary stoppage of operations of most of the center’s affiliated courier companies as well as adoption of Alternative Work Arrangement by both the suppliers’ offices and the Center.







Auditor’s Rejoinder



We acknowledged that delays were inevitable during the COVID-19 pandemic and implementation of community quarantine, hence, relaxation of deadlines on the submission of reports and other documents were implemented during those period. However, the same should not be a reason for substantial delay or non-submission of DVs. Records of this Office showed that DVs for the period October to December 2020 were still unsubmitted as of February 26, 2021.



Delayed Submission of BRS of WVSU Medical Center (WVSUM-MC) and Newborn Screening Center – Visayas (NSCV)



22)	Reliability of the balances of the Cash in Bank – Local Currency, Current Account totaling ₱666.278 million as per December 31, 2020 Trial Balance could not be established due to delayed/non-submission of monthly Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS) for 11 depository accounts of the WVSU-MC and NSCV to the Office of the Auditor as required under Section 7, Chapter 21 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume I.



Section 7, Chapter 21, of the GAM, Volume I, provides that the Chief Account shall submit the Bank Reconciliation Statement to the COA Auditor within twenty days after receipt of the monthly bank statements.



Perusal of our records showed that there was a substantial delay in the submission of the required monthly Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS) to the Office of the Auditor. Status of submission of monthly BRS as of December 31, 2020 of the WVSU-MC is shown in Appendix V while that of the NSCV is as follows:



Account Number

Monthly BRS Submitted

Date Submitted

PNB 291806700027

January 2020 to April 2020

July 2, 2020

DBP 0756002862030

January 2020 

June 3, 2020



For WVSU-MC, only the BRS for the months of January to April 2020 were completely submitted to the Office of the Auditor. Whereas, BRS for the months of June to December 2020 of eight (8) out of the nine (9) depository accounts remained unsubmitted as of February 26, 2020.



Likewise, the remaining Bank Reconciliation Statements of NSCV for the period May to December 2020 and February to December 2020 for PNB Account No. 291806700027 and DBP Account No. 0756002862030, respectively were not yet submitted to the Office of the Auditor as of February 26, 2021. 



Furthermore, all submitted BRS were not supported with complete documents as well as Journal Entry Vouchers.



The Bank Reconciliation Statement reconciles the cash balance per Agency books vis-à-vis per bank statement. Consequently, non-reconciliation of the Cash balances per books and bank rendered doubtful the accuracy of the Cash-in-Bank accounts of the Medical Center totaling ₱666.278 million as per December 31, 2020 financial statements.

 

The Accountant explained that delay on the submission of BRS was due to the promotion and transfer of the personnel in-charge of its preparation to the other unit of the agency.   



We recommended and management agreed to direct the accountant to immediately prepare and submit Monthly Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS) for all depository accounts together with all the supporting documents and JEVs within the reglementary period, to facilitate verification of the accuracy of the cash balance per book and bank totaling ₱666.278 million. 



Improper Use of Petty Cash Fund



23)	Petty Cash Fund of the Nutrition and Dietetics Services Unit was used for payments of disbursements, not in accordance with Section 35, Chapter 6 of the Government Accounting Manual, Volume I, thus propriety of expenditures from the fund could not be established.



Review and evaluation of the replenishments of the expenses paid out of the Petty Cash Fund (PCF) for CY 2020 totaling ₱7.274 million (Appendix W) revealed the following deficiencies:



1)	The authority for the establishment of the Petty Cash Fund issued by the Head of Agency specified that the PCF amounting to P250,000.00 was for the sole purpose of the daily market purchases of patient’s subsistence. The PCF Custodian has continued to utilize the PCF for payment of expenses/purchases related to the canteen operations of the unit that commenced in January 2019, which is inconsistent with the specific purpose for the establishment of the said fund.



Likewise, for CY 2020, the PCF was repeatedly used to purchase food packaging materials totaling P426,010.95 (Appendix X). According to the personnel in-charge, bulk purchases were made by the Dietary Department to limit the frequency of purchases of goods and materials due to the COVID-19 pandemic.



The above practice was contrary to Section 35 (a), Chapter 6 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) which provides that “the PCF shall be kept separately from the regular cash advances/collections and shall not be used for payment of regular expenses such as rentals, subscriptions, light and water bills, purchase of supplies and materials for stock purposes, and the like”.



2)	Petty Cash disbursements exceeded the allowable amount of ₱15,000.00 for each transaction, as follows:

3)	Splitting of transactions was noted on the purchase of bottled water totaling ₱28,733.00 for the month of July 2020 to avoid exceeding the ceiling of ₱15,000.00, as follows:

Section 35 (a), Chapter 6 of the GAM states that “Payments out of PCF, which shall be made through a Petty Cash Voucher (PCV), should be allowed only for amounts not exceeding ₱15,000 for each transactions, except when a higher amount is allowed by law and/or specific authority by the COA. Splitting of transactions to avoid exceeding the ceiling shall not be allowed.”



Likewise, Chapter 1 of the Handbook on Property and Supply Management System states that “Splitting” in its literal sense, is dividing or breaking up into separate parts or portions or an act, which results in fissure, rupture and breach.



In government procurement, splitting is associated with requisitions, purchase orders, deliveries and payments. It is often resorted in order to avoid or circumvent control measures promulgated by the government.  One of the forms of splitting is the non-consolidation of requisitions for one or more items needed at/or about the same time by the requisitioner.  



Inappropriate use of the Petty Cash fund for any purpose other than the specific purpose of the fund as well as non-compliance with the regulations on the use of Petty Cash Fund, resulted in difficulty in ascertaining the propriety of the expenditures.



We recommended and Management agreed to enforce strict compliance with Section 35, Chapter 6 of of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for NGAs on the use of Petty Cash Fund and stop the practice of utilizing the same for the operation of the canteen and catering services of the unit.



Doubtful validity of operation and reliability of reported income amounting to P1.777 million 



24)	Income from operations of WVSUMC Canteen and Catering Services could not be accounted for and the viability of the aforementioned income generating project could not be easily determined due to the absence of an internal control/policy manual on operations and financial reports contrary to the pertinent provisions of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445, rendering unreliable the regularity of operations and reliability of reported revenue of ₱1.777 million.



Sections 124 of Presidential Decree No. 1445 provides that it is the direct responsibility of the agency head to install, implement, and monitor a sound system of internal control.



Likewise, Section 112 of the same manual provides for recording of financial transactions which states that “Each government agency shall record its financial transactions and operations in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and in accordance with pertinent laws and regulations.”



The Internal Audit Services of the Medical Center was not able to complete the preparation of the Manual on Operations of the Nutrition and Dietetics Service Unit’s canteen and catering services that should have been the basis and guidelines for the establishment of said income generating project (IGP). According to the Internal Audit Services (IAS) Head, the establishment of policy and manual for the operation of the canteen was suspended and was not given priority due to the COVID-19 pandemic.



Evaluation of the operation of said IGP disclosed that disbursements pertaining to the operations of the canteen and catering services were still paid through the Petty Cash Fund of the Dietary Unit which was established solely for the the daily market purchases of patients’ subsistence. This resulted in difficulty in accounting for the cost of goods sold/expenses related to the operation of the canteen since purchases for both patients’ subsistence and operation of the canteen were done simultaneously.



As per recommendation of the Audit Team in CY 2019, a Cash Register has been utilized by the unit starting November 2020 to record daily sales. The total cash at the end of the day was collected and issued an Official Receipt by the Cashier, and the same was recorded as income of the Medical Center. With this procedure, accountability was not clearly defined as duties and responsibilities such as handling of cash and recording of financial transactions were not properly assigned. 



Moreover, financial report such as Income Statement to record revenues and disbursements relative to the operation of the Canteen as well as to determine the profitability of the project was not prepared. Overhead costs in the operation of the Canteen were likewise not considered/monitored in determining the financial condition of the project.  



The absence of an internal control policy/manual on operations as well as non-preparation of financial statements resulted in difficulty in accounting for the income of the project and the accuracy/reliability of reported revenue for CY 2020 totaling ₱1.777 million could not be established.



The Head of the Dietary Unit/Personnel-in-Charge explained that although the preparation of the Manual of Operation of the canteen was suspended due to the pandemic, the CY 2019 recommendations of the Audit Team were already incorporated in the draft manual which is due for submission to the WVSU Board of Regents for approval. Hence, they will have to wait for the approved manual before formalizing the operation of the canteen.  



We recommended and management agreed to:



1)		Complete the preparation/establishment of the Internal Control/Policy and  Manual on the operation of the Canteen to include the accurate recording of revenues and expenses, proper assignment of responsibilities such as handling of cash, recording of financial data as well as counter-checking the correctness of the recorded transactions and other areas related to its operation, to ensure validity and accuracy of recorded transactions;



2)		Stop utilizing the Petty Cash Fund to pay for the expenditures of the canteen and catering operations and establish a separate fund for the operation of the Canteen so that proper accounting of expenses related to its operation can be made; and



3)		Prepare and submit financial reports to determine the viability of the income generating project.





Unsettled Disallowances totalling ₱3.081 million despite issuance of NFD and COE



25)	Notice of Disallowances issued to WVSU Medical Center totaling ₱3.081 million remained outstanding and uncollected despite the issuance of Notices of Finality of Decision and COA Orders of Execution, contrary to the mandate on the 2009 Revised Rules of Procedures of the Commission on Audit, and Rules and Regulations on Settlement of Accounts.

   

Commission on Audit (COA) issued Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009 which prescribes the use of the 2009 Rules and Regulations on the Settlement of Accounts. Section 22.1 of the Circular provides that a decision of the Commission Proper, Director or Auditor upon any matter within their respective jurisdiction, if not appealed as herein provided, shall become final and executory. The rules also state that the period to file an appeal by any person aggrieved by a disallowance or charge is within six (6) months from receipt of the notice. Consequently, the authorized COA official shall issue a Notice of Finality of Decision (NFD) to the agency head to notify that a decision of the Auditor, Director, or Commission Proper has become final and executory, there being no appeal or motion for reconsideration filed within the reglementary period. Accordingly, a COA Order of Execution (COE) shall be issued to enforce the settlement of an audit disallowance/charge, whenever the persons liable thereof refuse or fail to settle them after the decision has become final and executory.



In Section 7 of COA Circular No. 2009-006, the following are the responsibilities of the Agency Head for audit and settlement of accounts:



“7.1    Responsibility of the Agency Head



7.1.1  The head of the agency, who is primarily responsible for all government funds and property pertaining to his agency, shall ensure that: (a) x x x ; (b) the settlement of disallowances and charges is made within the prescribed period; xxx



7.1.2    x x x 



7.1.3 He shall enforce the COA Order of Execution (COE) by requiring the withholding of salaries or other compensation due the person liable in satisfaction of the disallowance or charge.



7.1.4   He shall ensure that all employees who are retiring or transferring to other agencies shall first settle the disallowances and charges for which they are liable.”



In the monitoring of settlement of suspensions/disallowances/charges of WVSU Medical Center as of December 31, 2020, it was discovered that there were three NDs which were already issued NFDs and COEs. As of December 31, 2020, the outstanding balance of unsettled NDs with NFDs and COEs amounted to ₱3.081 million (Appendix Y). The COE was issued on December 20, 2019, hence the Management of WVSU Medical Center was given ample time to enforce the COE and collect from the persons liable their accountability on the NDs issued or file a request for installment payment. 



Under Section 3 Rule XIII-Enforcement and Monitoring of Decisions of the 2009 RRP of COA, in case of failure of the person(s) liable to refund the amount disallowed, the COE directing the Cashier/Treasurer/Disbursing Officer to withhold payment of any money due such person(s) shall be issued. 



It was noted that these NDs were not subjected to any requests for installment of payment, hence, payment of salaries or any amount due to persons liable should have been withheld until full settlement of liability in consonance with the instructions in the COE. 



Payments by persons liable still connected with the agency were made through salary deduction. Nevertheless, some persons liable were able to settle the disallowance through personal payment. Total payments as of December 31, 2020 amounted to ₱0.749 million.  However, ₱0.604 million or 80.70 percent of the total payments was made by the former University President upon his retirement as full settlement of his liability for the three (3) NDs with COEs.



The Agency head likewise was not able to ensure that all personnel who are retiring first settle the disallowances for which they are liable, resulting in the non-collection of receivables from disallowances.



As stated in the 2009 RRSA, Section16.3, “The liability of persons determined to be liable under an ND/Notice of Charge (NC) shall be solidary and the Commission may go against any person liable without prejudice to the latter’s claim against the rest of the persons liable”. (emphasis ours) Due to the fact that it is a solidary liability, COA can demand full compliance to any of the persons determined liable in the ND and not necessarily to the payee.



Furthermore, in the same section of COA 2009 RRSA, in case of failure by the Cashier/Treasurer/Disbursing Officer to comply with the COE, the Auditor shall notify the agency head concerned of the non-compliance. At the same time, the Auditor shall report the matter through the COA Director concerned, to the General Counsel who shall take any or all of the following actions:



a)	Recommend to the Commission Proper to cite defaulting party in contempt;

b)	Refer the matter to the Solicitor General for the filing of appropriate civil suit; 

c)	Refer the case to the Ombudsman for the filing of appropriate administrative or criminal action.



We recommended that Management:



a)	Submit justification for the unsettled balance of P3.081 million as of December 31, 2020;



b)	Enforce the collection of disallowed amounts on Notice of Disallowances that were already issued with Notices of Finality of Decision and COA Order of Execution by sending notice/letter of demand to persons liable to settle their disallowances especially to those who are no longer connected with the agency;



c)	Instruct the Cashier to withhold payment of salary and other money due to persons liable, and in case of refusal or failure to settle, demand compliance from any of the persons determined solidarily liable; 



Management Comments:



The Management informed that the total refunds on disallowed payments amounted to P778,638.67 as of February 28, 2021. However, the amounts were dependent on the capacity to pay/net take home pay of persons liable.  Likewise, they will be requesting to pay the disallowances on installment basis in accordance with COA Rules and Regulations.





GENDER AND DEVELOPMENT (GAD)



The University had substantially implemented its GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) for calendar year 2020 with a budget of P51.800 million which constitute 5.04 percent of the total budget of the agency, and had incurred expenditures of P47.922 million or 92.51 percent of the total allocated budget for GAD. Attributed programs to GAD were properly supported with corresponding Harmonized Gender and Development Guidelines (HGDG) Tool and Project Implementation and Management Monitoring and Evaluation (PIMME) checklist. GAD Accomplishment Report together with the supporting documents was submitted on February 9, 2021, within the deadline set forth by COA Circular No. 2014-001 dated March 18, 2014.



Likewise, the agency has a duly constituted GAD Focal Point System and  its GPB was duly endorsed by the Philippine Commission on Women (PCW).



COMPLIANCE WITH TAX LAWS



The total taxes withheld by the University amounted to P52.079 million covering January-December 2020 while total remittances amounted to P52.140 million leaving an unremitted balance of P0.520 million as of December 31, 2020, as shown in the following table:
