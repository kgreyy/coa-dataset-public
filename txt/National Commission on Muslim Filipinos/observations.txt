OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

 

A. Financial and Compliance Audit 
 

Unreliable CIB-LCCA balance 

 

1. The accuracy and reliability of the Cash in Bank-Local Currency, Current 
Account (CIB-LCCA) of NCMF-South Luzon (SLO), Region IV-A and IV-B, 

could not be ascertained due to the discrepancy noted between the book and bank 

balances totaling P1,152,205.55 as of December 31, 2020, caused by the continuous 

failure of the Accountant to prepare and submit the Bank Reconciliation 

Statements (BRSs) for CY 2020 and prior years. 

 

A bank reconciliation is the process of matching the balances in an entity's 

accounting records for a cash account to the corresponding information on a bank 

statement. The goal of this process is to ascertain the differences between the two, and 

to book changes to the accounting records as appropriate. It is an effective tool for 

management control and thus, must be kept current and accurate to avert possible acts 

leading to irregularities.  

 

Section 74 of PD No. 1445 states that: 

At the close of each month, depositories shall report to the agency head, in 

such form as he may direct, the condition of the agency account standing on 

their books. The head of the agency shall see to it that reconciliation is made 

between the balance shown in the report and the balance found in the books 

of the agency. 

 

Section 122 PD No. 1445 specifically provides for the sanctions for non-

submission of documents and other reports to the Commission, to wit: 

 

Whenever deemed necessary in the exigencies of the service, the 

Commission may under regulations issued by it require the agency heads, 

chief accountants, budget officers, cashiers, disbursing officers, 

administrative or personnel officers, and other responsible officials of the 

various agencies to submit trial balances, physical inventory reports, current 

plantilla of personnel, and such other reports as may be necessary for the 

exercise of its functions. 

 

Failure on the part of the officials concerned to submit the documents and 

reports mentioned herein shall automatically cause the suspension of 

payment of their salaries until they shall have complied with the 

requirements of the Commission) 

 



33 

 

No appropriation authorized in the General Appropriations Act shall be 

available to pay the salary or any official or employee who violates the 

provisions of this section, without prejudice to any disciplinary action that 

may be instituted against such official or employee. 

 

While Section 7, Chapter 21 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for 

National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume 1, provides that “the Chief 

Accountant/Designated Staff shall submit the original copy of the BRS with all the 

supporting documents and JEVs to COA Auditor within 20 days after receipt of the 

Bank Statements (BS).” 

 

Audit revealed that as of December 31, 2020, the CIB-LCCA book balance was 

P212,657.43 and upon confirmation from the bank balance maintained at Land Bank of 

the Philippines (LBP) - Cainta Branch, the balance confirmed as of December 31, 2020 

was P1,364,862.98, which resulted in the discrepancy of P1,152,205.55.  

 

Our records disclosed that there were no BRSs submitted to the Audit Team 

since the team were assigned to the auditee agency and no complete Bank Statements 

were furnished to enable the Audit Team to verify the discrepancy amounting to 

P1,152,205.55 despite the Audit Team’s constant follow-ups and reminders.  

 

Due to the continuous disregard of the Accountant of her duty to reconcile book 

balances and bank balances, the discrepancies/errors and reconciling items could not be 

corrected and adjusted immediately in the books of accounts, hence affected the timely 

audit of the CIB-LCCA balance and renders the accuracy and reliability of the CIB-

LCCA doubtful. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed that the Regional Director 

NCMF-SLO  to: 

 

a. strictly require the Accountant to prepare BRSs and effect immediately 
adjusting/correcting entries if necessary, and thereafter submit the 

same to the Auditor’s Office for audit within 20 days upon receipt of BS 

and in case of an unjustified failure/refusal, cause the suspension of 

payment of her salaries until she complied the same; and 

 

b. make a follow-up with LBP - Cainta Branch to release the unissued BS  
and submit immediately the copies thereof to the Audit Team. 

 

 

Unreliable balance of Due from NGAs - NCMF-Central Office (CO) 

 

2. The funds transferred to the SCP covered by MOA with NCMF in the amount of 
P533,440.00 has remained unliquidated contrary to COA Circular No. 94-013. 

 



34 

 

Section 4.6 of COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994 prescribes 

that “within ten days after the end of each month/end of the agreed period for the Project, 

the Implementing Agency (IA) shall submit the Report of Checks Issued (RCI) and the 

Report of Disbursement (RD) to report the utilization of the funds. Only actual project 

expenses shall be reported. The reports shall be approved by the Head of the IA.” 

 

Section 5.4 of the same Circular states that it is the responsibility of Source 

Agency (SA) to require the IA to submit the said required reports. 

 

Review of Disbursement Voucher (DV) amounting to P533,440.00 on the fund 

transfer made to the SCP under MOA with the NCMF dated January 28, 2020 disclosed 

that the fund transfer to SCP was utilized for the Shari’ah Bar Examination and 16th 

Series Shari’ah seminars which was held last February of 2020. 

 

Considering the lapse of time after the fund was transferred and the completion 

of 16th Series Shari’ah Seminars nationwide where the fund was utilized, the fund 

transferred should have already been liquidated, however, as of December 31, 2020, no 

Liquidation/Disbursement reports were submitted to the Accounting Division of NCMF 

by the SCP. 

 

The non-submission of liquidation report by the SCP hampers the complete 

review and evaluation on the validity of the disbursements made by the SCP. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Acting Chief 

Accountant to demand SCP the liquidation of the fund transferred in the amount 

of P533,440.00 and recognize immediately in the books of accounts once the 

liquidation/disbursement report is received from SCP. 

 

 

Unreconciled Inter-Agencies Fund Transfer in NCMF-CO 

 

3. Discrepancy noted in the amount of P11,831,138.37 as of December 31, 2020 
between the records of NCMF and PS - DBM on the procurement of office supplies, 

equipment and airfare tickets. 
  

Result of the confirmation from PS-DBM showed an outstanding balance of 

P892,551.39 as of December 31, 2020 while P12,723,689.76 was the recorded balance 

in the books of NCMF, hence a discrepancy of P11,831,138.37 was noted. The Review 

of available documents disclosed that some of the discrepancies can be attributed to the 

following: 

 

 Procured 100 units of Microsoft Office Software STD Development 
recognized in the books of NCMF in the total amount of P1,704,372.00 was 
not recorded in the Subsidiary Ledger of PS-DBM. 

 



35 

 

 Unrecognized consumption of airfare tickets under the Government Fare 
Agreement (GFA) in the books of NCMF totaling P1,787,746.41. 

 

 Unrecognized deliveries of office supplies in the books of NCMF totaling 
P523,040.31. 

 

 Prior years’ balances contributed to a bigger amount of discrepancies 
between the books and PS-DBM balances for further analysis  

 

The discrepancies noted could have been minimized if all the transactions 

pertaining to procurement and deliveries to PS-DBM have been promptly recognized in 

the books. Moreover, the Audit Team noted that the NCMF did not request for the refund 

of unutilized and undelivered office supplies and equipment from the PS-DBM. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Acting Chief 

Accountant to prepare adjusting entries to recognize the deliveries and the utilized 

GFA-air tickets and request for refund from the PS-DBM for those undelivered 

office supplies in prior years for remittance to the BTr. 

 

Management of NCMF-CO commented that they will adhere to the 

recommendation and adjustment will be made to recognize the deliveries of office 

supplies and utilization of GFAs and will further analyzed on the discrepancies noted.  

 

 

Failure to request for write-off of Dormant Receivables  

 

4. The Management of NCMF- SLO, Region IVA & B, failed to request for write-off 
dormant Due from Central Office account amounting to P514,303.01. Likewise, in 

NCMF-Northern Mindanao (NMO) Region X, Other Receivables account 

amounting to ₱645,732.40 remained outstanding for over 10 years in the books of 

accounts and without available pertinent records/documents despite prior years’ 

audit recommendation to request for write-off as prescribed in COA Circular No 

2016-005 dated December 19, 2016. 

 

COA Circular No. 97-001 dated February 5, 2017 defines Dormant Accounts as 

referring to individual or group of accounts which balances remained non-moving for 

more than five years. 

 

COA Circular No 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016 provides for the 

Guidelines and Procedures on the Write-off of Dormant Receivable Accounts, 

Unliquidated Cash Advances, and Fund Transfers of National Government Agencies 

(NGAs), Local government Units (LGUs) and Government-Owned and Controlled 

Corporations (GOCCs). 

 



36 

 

Section 6.0 of the said Circular provides for the General Guidelines, Section 7.0 

for the Specific Guidelines while Section 8.0 is for the Procedures in the Write-off of 

Dormant Accounts enumerated hereunder: 

        

  8.1.  Xxx; 

 

8.2 The head of the government entity shall file the request for authority to 

write-off dormant receivable accounts, unliquidated cash advances, and 

fund transfers to the COA Audit Team Leader (ATL) and/or 

Supervising Auditor (SA). No filing fee is required. 

 

8.3 The request shall be supported by the following documents: 

 

a. Schedule of dormant accounts by accountable 
officer/debtor/government entity and by account, certified by the 

accountant and approved by the Head of the government entity; 

 

b. Certified relevant documents validating the existence of the 
conditions, as applicable as such…Xxx. 

 

8.4 The ATL and SA, xxx shall decide on the requests for authority to write-

off for amounts not exceeding P100,000.00 per accountable 

officer/debtor/government entity and by account xxx. (Emphasis ours.)  

 

8.5 For amounts exceeding P100,000.00 per accountable 

officer/debtor/government entity and by account, the ATL and SA shall 

forward the entire records of the requests to the CD/RD, together with 

their comments and recommendations, xxx. (Emphasis ours.)  

 

8.8 The CD/RD shall review the entire records and requests and shall decide 

on amounts involving more than P100,000.00 but not exceeding 

P1,000,000.00 per accountable officer/debtor/government entity and by 

account xxx. (Emphasis ours.)  

 

8.11 For amounts exceeding P1,000,000.00 per accountable 

officer/debtor/government entity and by account, CD/RD shall forward 

the entire records of the requests together with his/her recommendation 

to the AC of the Sector xxx.  

 

8.12 The AC of the Sector shall review the entire records of requests and 

shall decide on amounts exceeding P1,000,000.00 per accountable 

officer/debtor/government entity and by account xxx. 

 

Audit revealed that the Receivable balance in the books of NCMF-SLO 

amounting to P514,303.01 pertains to the unsupported/undocumented fund Due from 

Central Office which remained dormant for 17 years. It is described only on the prior 



37 

 

years’ Notes to FS as unfunded Sub-allotment Advice (SAA) from the NCMF- CO, 

however verification with NCMF-CO revealed that there was no corresponding 

recorded liability booked for the unfunded SAA claimed by NCMF-SLO.   

 

Likewise, in NCMF-NMO, Region X, the Management failed to take the necessary 

actions of the dormant Other Receivables account balance of ₱645,732.40 which remained 

outstanding for over 10 years in the books of accounts and without available pertinent 

records/documents despite prior years’ audit recommendation for write-off. 

Reference made to previous Audit Observation Memoranda (AOM) and 

discussion with agency personnel disclosed that the receivable account was an 

unliquidated cash advance granted to the former Project Director Mr. Otowa 

Dimapingun assigned in Malaybalay City for over 20 years.  The agency finds it difficult 

to locate the whereabouts of said coordinator as he is no longer connected with NCMF.  

Other information also revealed that Mr. Otowa Dimapingun was already dead. 

This has been a recurring audit observation in previous years and the agency was 

advised to request for write-off the said receivable account in accordance with the 

procedures provided in relevant COA Circular, however, it was noted that the 

management failed to do so as advised thus, absence of their write-off from the books 

of accounts of the agency corresponding to the said amount as there is continuous 

uncertainty of their liquidation or collectability. 

 

We recommended that Management of NCMF – SLO, RO-IV-A&B, and 

NMO-RO X instruct the Regional Accountants to:   

 

a. Prepare and submit the request for write-off of the dormant Due from 
Central Office Account of P514,303.01 and Other Receivables Account 

amounting to ₱645,732.40 in accordance with the specific guidelines 

and procedures provided in Items 7 and 8 of COA Circular No. 2016-

005 dated December 19, 2016 on reconciling and cleaning the books of 

accounts of NGAs, LGUs, and GOCCs of dormant receivable accounts, 

unliquidated cash advances, and fund transfers for fair presentation of 

accounts in the Financial Statements. 

b. Subsequently, conduct regular monitoring and analysis of receivable 
accounts to ensure that these are collected when these become due and 

demandable and that cash advances and fund transfers are liquidated 

within the prescribed period depending upon their nature and purpose. 

 

The Management agreed and committed to file a request for write-off of the 

receivable account and comply with the audit recommendations. They will start with 

the gathering of relevant documents to support the write-off.

Doubtful Inventory Account Balance  

  

5. In NCMF-Zamboanga Peninsula RO IX-A, issued inventory and semi-expendable 
items were not recorded in the books due to non-preparation and non-submission 

of Report of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI) thus, overstated the inventory 

account and understated the expense account.  

 

Issued office supplies, semi-expendable machinery and equipment, and semi-

expendable furniture and fixtures amounting to P69,673.74, P68,934.25 and 

P20,945.00, respectively, were not recognized as expense due to non-preparation and 

non-submission of RSMI by the Property/Supply Officer to the Accounting Office. This 

practice is not in keeping with paragraph 44 of IPSAS 12, Section 16, Item g and l of 

Section 17, Chapter 8 Volume I of GAM for NGAs, thereby resulting to untimely 

recording of related Expense accounts. 

 

Paragraph 44 of IPSAS 12 provides that “when inventories are sold, exchanged 

or distributed, the carrying amount of those inventories shall be recognized as an 

expense in the period in which the related revenue is recognized. If there is no related 

revenue, the expense is recognized when the goods are distributed or related service is 

rendered.” 

 

Section 16, Chapter 8, Volume I of GAM for NGAs provides the detailed 

procedures in the requisition and issue of inventory items. These procedures include the 

preparation by the Property/Supply Officer of RSMI daily base on the Requisition Issue 

Slip (RIS) on file, submits the RSMI with the RIS as attachment to the Accounting as 

basis in recording the issuance of inventory items.   

 

Likewise, Section 17 (Items d, g and l) of the same provides the records, forms 

and reports to be prepared to include the following: 

 

Requisition and Issue Slip (RIS) (Appendix 63) – shall be used by the end-

user to request issue of supplies and materials that are carried on stock. It is 

also used by the Property and/or Supply Division/Unit to indicate 

availability or non-availability of items requisitioned and/or to record issues 

of item/s requisitioned. 

 

Report of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI) (Appendix 64) – shall be 

prepared by the Property and/or Supply Custodian based on the RIS and 

shall be used by the Accounting Division/Unit as basis in preparing the JEV 

to record the supplies and materials issued. 

 

Inventory Custodian Slip (ICS) (Appendix 59) – shall be prepared upon 

issue of semi-expendable property covered by approved RIS. 

 

Instructions in accomplishing the RSMI form states that this form is used to 

report/summarize all issuances of inventories (by stock number) during the day. At the 



39 

 

end of the month, all RSMIs shall be consolidated by the Accounting Division/Unit for 

the preparation of the JEV. It is further required that the Accounting Division/Unit and 

Supply and/or Property Division/Unit shall conduct periodic reconciliation of the 

Supplies Ledger Card (SLC) and Stock Card (SC) to identify and adjust any 

discrepancy. 

 

As of December 31, 2020, the Agency’s books reported Inventory and Semi-

Expendable Items amounting to ₱69,673.74 and ₱89,879.25, respectively. Details of 

which are as follows: 

 

Account Titles  Amount (P) 

Office Supplies Inventory            69,673.74  

Total Inventory Held for Consumption          69,673.74  

  

Semi-Expendable Office Equipment            25,584.75  

Semi-Expendable ICT Equipment            22,679.50  

Semi-Expendable Other Machinery and Equipment            20,670.00  

Total Semi-Expendable Machinery and Equipment         68,934.25  

  

Semi-Expendable Furniture & Fixtures            20,945.00  

Total Semi-Expendable Furniture, Fixtures and 

Books 

       20,945.00  

Total Inventories      159,552.99  

 

It was found out that the inventories were already issued to the end-users. 

However, the said issuances were not yet recorded due to non-preparation and non-

submission of RSMI the Accounting Office as its basis in recognizing issued 

inventories. 

 

We recommended that Management direct the Property and Supply 

Officer to prepare the RSMI and submit the same to the Accounting Office for 

proper recording in accordance with the above-mentioned provisions. 

 

The Supply Officer explained during the exit conference that the non-

preparation and non-submission of the RSMI was brought about by the rehabilitation of 

the main office in 2018 and 2019, whereby attention were redirected to these 

construction activities.  

 

 

Deficiencies in Property Management  

 

6. The accuracy, completeness and existence of  PPE with carrying amount of 
P65,903,463.22 cannot be ascertained due to : (a) failure to conduct annual 

physical count and preparation and submission of the RPCPPE;  (b) non-



40 

 

recognition in the books of NCMF - CO transferred PPE to NCMF - ROs; (c) lack 

of documents to support derecognition of a lost motor vehicle in NCMF Visayas 

Region;  (d) non-maintenance of PPELC and PCs and non-issuance of PARs; and  

e) procured 100 units of Microsoft Office licenses of P1,689,178.40 were 

erroneously recognized as ICTE account. 

Among the provisions of GAM for NGAs, Volume I on Property Management 

are as follows: 

 

 Section 38, Chapter 10, Volume I of GAM for NGAs provides that, “The 
entity shall have a periodic physical count of PPE, which shall be done 

annually and presented on the RPCPPE (Appendix 73) as at December 31, 

of each year.  This shall be submitted to the Auditor concerned not later than 

January 31, of the following year. Equipment found at station and losses 

discovered during the physical count shall be reported to the Accounting 

Division/Unit for proper accounting/recording. 

 

 Section 42, Chapter 10, Volume I of GAM for NGAs, provides that “the 

Chief Accountant shall maintain the PPELC for each category of PPE 

including work and other animals, livestock etc.  The PPELC shall be kept 

to record promptly the acquisition, description, custody, estimated useful 

life, depreciation, impairment loss, disposal and other information about the 

asset.  For check and balance, the Property and Supply Officer shall likewise 

maintain PC for PPE in their custody to account for the receipt and 

disposition of the same.  The balance per PC shall be reconciled with PPELC 

maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit.  They shall also be reconciled 

with other property records like PAR.  

 

 When a loss of government funds or property occurs while they are in transit 

or the loss is caused by fire, theft, or other casualty or force majeure, the 

officer accountable therefor or having custody thereof shall immediately 

notify the Commission or the auditor concerned and, within thirty days or 

such longer period as the Commission or auditor may in the particular case 

allow, shall present his application for relief, with available supporting 

evidence.  Whenever warranted by the evidence credit for the loss shall be 

allowed. An officer who fails to comply with this requirement shall not be 

relieved of liability or allowed credit for any loss in the settlement of his 

accounts. (Sec. 73[1], PD No. 1445). 

 

The consolidated carrying amount of the PPE accounts as at December 31, 2020 

amounted to P65,903,463.22, as shown below:

         Total 65,903,463.22 

 

Audit of the PPE disclosed the following property management deficiencies: 

 

a) Failure to conduct physical count, prepare and submit RPCPPE 
In the NCMF-CO, the General Service Division (GSD) specifically the 

Inventory Committee of the NCMF-CO failed to conduct physical count/inventory of 

all PPE and to prepare and submit the RPCPPE for CY 2020 contrary to Section 38, 

Chapter 10, Volume I of GAM for NGAs.  

 

The carrying amount of the PPE accounts of NCMF-CO as at December 31, 

2020 amounted to P53,681,324.87, as shown below:

Likewise, in NCMF- ROs Northern Luzon (NLO) I, II & III, Davao City XI, 

Lanao XIIB, and CARAGA XIII, wherein their PPE with a carrying amount of 

₱1,094,812.16, P1,195,328.80, P1,742,369.76, and ₱275,986.18, respectively, the 

Inventory Committee also failed to conduct the physical count of all PPE and to prepare 

and submit the RPCPPE to their respective Audit Team same with NCMF Region IX-

A. While in NCMF Region IX-B the RPCPPE was not submitted to the Audit Team 

thus, the existence of the PPE accounts could not be ascertained.  

 

Moreover, in NCMF Region NMO X the absence of periodic reconciliation 

between Accounting and Property records, and errors and omissions in recording and 

reporting of transactions resulted in a total discrepancy of ₱544,486.73 in the reported 

balances of PPE. 

 

b) Non-recognition in the books of NCMF-CO transferred PPE to NCMF-ROs 
  

Transferred 133 laptops and 69 desktops from NMCF-CO to NCMF RO 

amounting to P8,430,073.60 were not recognized in the books, resulting to 

overstatement of Information and Communications Technology Equipment (ICTE) 

account of the NCMF-CO by the same amount. 

 

Section 14, Volume I of GAM for NGAs discussed the accounting entries on 

how to record the intra-agency transfers of PPE (from Central Office to Regional 

Offices or vice versa). The PPE shall be recognized at the carrying amount of the asset 

received. The receiving department/office shall recognize the asset at its original 

historical cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss.  

 

The accounting entries to recognize the transfer are as follows: 

 

a) Central Office books 
 

Account Title Debit Credit 

Subsidy to Regional Offices xxx  

Accumulated Depreciation - ICTE xxx  

         ICTE  Xxx 

             To recognize the transfer of equipment to regional office. 

 

b) Regional Office books 
 

Account Title Debit Credit 

ICTE xxx  

    Accumulated Depreciation - ICTE xxx  

     Subsidy from Central Office  Xxx 

             To recognize the receipt of the transferred equipment. 

 

During the year 2020, NCMF procured 215 laptops and 220 desktops in 

connection with the Information System Strategic Plan (ISSP) of NCMF a project 



43 

 

implemented by the Planning Service, wherein which out of the 215 laptops and 220 

desktops, the 133 laptops and 69 desktops were transferred to NCMF ROs and Field 

Offices, as summarized below:

However, the Acting Chief Accountant of NCMF-CO informed the Audit Team 

that 10 ROs recognized in their books the receipt of 85 laptops and 68 desktops as 

summarized below:

 Total   laptops/desktops recorded in

Total  P3,518,320.00 P2,882,547.20 

Overstated in consolidated PPE P6,400,867.20 

 

As can be gleaned from the table above, the non-recognition of transferred 

laptops/desktops in the books of NCMF-CO that were recorded in the books of NCMF-

ROs resulted to overstatement of the consolidated balance of PPE as of December 31, 

2020 by P6,400,867.20.  

 

Likewise, in NCMF Region XIIA properties acquired through finance lease 

which totalled to P684,375.00 were not recorded as PPE and Semi-Expendable PPE due 

to non-recognition of the Lease Payable and erroneous recognition of its partial payment 

to Rent Expense account, thereby understating the asset, payable and equity accounts in 

the respective amounts of P684,375.00, P285,375.00 and P399,000.00 as at year-end.    

 

c) Lack of documents to support derecognition of a lost motor vehicle 

 

 In NCMF- Visayas Region (VI, VII, VIII) the derecognition of a lost motor 

vehicle costing P450,000.00 was made without a duly notarized RLSDDP and to set 

up receivable account for the accountability of Accountable Officer, contrary to 

Section 41, Volume I, Chapter 10 of GAM for NGAs. 

Section 41, Chapter 10, Volume I of GAM for NGAs provides for the 

accounting policies to be observed in the case of loss of government property. It states 

that when a loss of government funds or property occurs while they are in transit or the 

loss is caused by fire, theft, or other casualty or force majeure, the officer accountable 

therefore or having custody thereof shall immediately notify the Commission or the 

auditor concerned and, within thirty days or such longer period as the Commission or 

auditor may in the particular case allow, shall present his applicable for relief, with the 

available supporting evidence. Whenever warranted by the evidence credit for the loss 

shall be allowed. An officer who fails to comply with this requirement shall not be 

relieved of liability or allowed credit for any loss in the settlement of his accounts. (Sec. 

73, PD No. 1445)  

  

During the year, a motor vehicle under the accountability of Ms. Sohra L. 

Ambor, as indicated in the Property Transfer Report No. 001 dated March 2, 2017, was 

reported to be lost.  Below is the description of the lost property.  

  

 



45 

 

Property No.  Description  Cost  

VIS-VIH-0  
Motor Vehicle - Isuzu Big Horn 

with Plate No. SHW 429  
₱450,000.00  

  

The Accountable Officer is required to submit a duly notarized RLSDDP 

supported by a Notice of Loss to the Audit Team, Accountant and Supply Officer.  This 

will be the basis of the Accountant for the journal entry to derecognize from the books 

the lost asset and the related accumulated depreciation.  The loss shall be charged to 

account “Loss of Assets” at an amount equal to its carrying amount.  

 

Consequently, to derecognize the lost vehicle from the books of accounts of 

NCMF Visayas, the Accountant drew the following entry through Journal Entry 

Voucher (JEV) 2020-12-284.  

  

Accounts  Debit  Credit  

Accumulated Depreciation - Motor 

Vehicle  

₱427,500.00      

Accumulated Surplus/Deficit  22,500.00      

           Motor Vehicle     450,000.00   

    

Audit team’s verification revealed that the derecognition of the lost asset was 

not properly supported with a duly notarized RLSDDP as required by GAM for NGAs.  

Furthermore, no entry was made to set up the receivable account to record the 

accountability of the accountable officer equivalent to the depreciated replacement cost, 

which should have been simultaneously made upon derecognition of lost PPE. 

 

Failure by the Accountable Officer to comply with the requirements as provided 

above may be a ground for denial of the request for relief of accountability.  In addition, 

non-recording of the receivable account to recognize the accountability of the 

Accountable Officer, awaiting the pending the decision of the Auditor of the Request 

of Relief from Accountability, understates the presented balance of the total asset and 

liability.  

 

d) non-maintenance of PPELCs and PCs and non-issuance of PARs 

 

Section 42, Chapter 10, Volume I of GAM for NGAs, provides that “the Chief 

Accountant shall maintain the PPELC for each category of PPE including work and 

other animals, livestock etc.  The PPELC shall be kept to record promptly the 

acquisition, description, custody, estimated useful life, depreciation, impairment loss, 

disposal and other information about the asset.  For check and balance, the Property 

and Supply Officer shall likewise maintain PC for PPE in their custody to account for 

the receipt and disposition of the same.  The balance per PC shall be reconciled with 

PPELC maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit.  They shall also be reconciled 

with other property records like PAR.” 



46 

 

 

The Accounting Division (AD) shall maintain the PPELC for each category of 

the PPE which shall contain the details of the General Ledger (GL) accounts per PPE.  

The GSD shall maintain the PC for PPE and ensure that the balance in quantity per PC 

always reconciles with the PPELC of the AD and the control accounts in the GL. 

 

Verification from the AD of the NCMF-CO revealed that they did not maintain 

the PPELC and the GSD likewise did not maintain the PC, thus, record of an assets 

acquisition, estimated useful life, depreciation, impairment loss and other information 

about the asset was not kept, thus, the book value of the asset as of date was unreliable. 

 

According to the personnel of AD, the basis in recording depreciation of property 

was the Report of Checks Issued (RCI) and Report of Advice to Debit Account Issued 

(RADDAI).  This practice is not in accordance with GAM for NGAs. 

 

Moreover, individual PPELCs and PCs from the Accounting and Property 

Divisions, respectively, together with the corresponding PARs issued to the end-users 

for appropriate check and balance should be prepared.  The maintenance of PPELC and 

PC and PAR are controls for ascertaining the existence, ownership, accuracy and 

completeness of the total PPE account and so that each PPE are appropriately 

recognized in the books. 

 

These observations were reiterations of the previous year’s findings which were 

not addressed by management.  
  

e) procured 100 units of Microsoft Office licenses of P1,689,178.40 were 
erroneously recognized as Information and Computer Technology Equipment 

(ICTE) account instead of Computer Software account, resulting to 

overstatement of ICTE and understatement of Computer Software account by 

P1,689.178.40. 

 

As defined in Volume III of GAM for NGAs, “Computer Software account is 

used to recognize the purchase cost or capitalized development cost of computer 

software programs for use in government operation.” Development costs include the 

cost of coding, testing and cost to produce product masters while the “Information and 

Communications Technology Equipment (ICTE) is used to recognize the cost incurred 

in the purchase of ICTE which includes hardware (computers, printers, scanners, and 

the like) and pre-loaded software such as but not limited to operating systems which are 

included in the cost of the computer hardware. This also includes data communications 

equipment and such other peripherals and auxiliary equipment necessary to put the 

system into operational mode.”  

 

Analysis of the ICTE account revealed that the 100 units of Microsoft Office 

licenses procured from PS-DBM costing P1,689,178.40 were erroneously recorded (per 

General Journal No. 20-10-002 dated October 2020) in the ICTE account instead of 



47 

 

Computer Software account, which resulted to overstatement of ICTE and 

understatement of Computer Software account by P1,689,178.40. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed that: 

 

a) in NCMF-CO and NCMF-ROs (NLO I, II,III; Zamboanga Peninsula 
IXA, Jolo, Sulu, IXB; Davao City XI;  Lanao XIIB; and CARAGA  XIII)  

 ensure that the Inventory Committee conduct promptly the 
physical count of all PPEs, and submit the RPCPPE duly certified 

by the Inventory Committee and approved by the Head of the 

Agency to the Audit Team; and reconcile the results of the 

Inventory of PPE with Accounting records.  

 instruct the Property Custodian/ Supply Officer and the 
Accountant in NCMF NMO Region X to reconcile the balances of 

accounts arrived  per physical count with the SL and GL of the 

Accounting Division and ensure that the PPE balances reflected in 

the financial statement are supported by PPELC and reconciled 

with the RPCPPE; 

 

b. NCMF-CO and NCMF XIIA 
 

 instruct the Acting Chief Accountant to record the necessary 
adjusting journal entries in the books of NCMF-CO by debiting 

Subsidy to Regional Offices and crediting Information and 

Computer Technology Equipment account by P6,400,867.20. 

 

 to instruct the Regional Accountant of NCMF Region XII-A to 
prepare adjusting journal entries to correct the erroneous entries 

made to recognize the Leased Assets and Leased Payables and 

furnish the Audit Team copies of such journal entries for 

validation. 

 

c.  NCMF-Visayas VI, VII, VIII 
 

 submit the duly notarized RLSDDP of the Accountable Officer as 
provided in Appendix 75 of the GAM to support the derecognition 

from the books of the lost vehicle; and,  

 

 direct the Accountant to set up the receivable account equal to the 
depreciated replacement cost to record accountability of the 

accountable officer with the following entry:  

 

 



48 

 

Account  Title  Account Code  Debit  Credit  

Due from Officers 

and Employees  

10305020  XXX     

  Other Deferred 

Credits  

20501990     XXX  

 To set up the accountability of the 

accountable officer 

  

 

d. NCMF-CO  
 

 direct the Acting Chief Accountant and Acting Chief of GSD to 
prepare and maintain the PPELC and PC, respectively, and the 

Property Officer to issue the PAR for properties with acquisition 

cost of P15,000.00 and above establish accountability over them.  

Henceforth, conduct periodic reconciliation of the PC against the 

issued PARs and the PPELCs of the Accounting Division. 
 

 

e. NCMF-CO 
 

 direct the Acting Chief Accountant to recognize the adjusting 
journal entry by debiting Computer Software and crediting ICTE 

account by P1,689,178.40 to correct the balances of PPE accounts. 
 

 

Unjustified Procurement of high-end electronic gadgets 

 

7. Procurement of high-end expensive models/brands of electronic gadgets 
amounting to P446,637.76 were unjustified, thus were considered unnecessary 

expenditures as defined in Item 4 of COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 

29, 2012. 

Item 4 of the COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012 defined the 

expenditures as unnecessary which could not pass the test of prudence or the diligence 

of a good father of a family, thereby denoting non-responsiveness to the exigencies of 

service. Unnecessary expenditures are those not supportive of the implementation of the 

objectives and mission of the agency relative to the nature of its operation. This would 

also include incurrence of expenditure not dictated by the demands of good government, 

and those the utility of which cannot be ascertained at a specific time. An expenditure 

that is not essential or that which can be dispensed with without loss or damage to 

property is considered unnecessary. The mission and thrusts of the agency incurring the 



49 

 

expenditures must be considered in determining whether or not an expenditure is 

necessary. 

 

One of the cases that are considered “Unnecessary” expenditures enumerated in 

the Annex C of the COA Circular No. 2012-003 are the purchase of high-end or 

expensive models/brands of electronic gadgets such as mobile phones, desktops, 

laptops, etc. 

  

During the year 2020, aside from the procurement of 215 laptops and 220 

desktops, NCMF procured expensive models/brands of electronic gadgets totaling 

P446,637.76 to be used by the officials of NCMF-CO, as summarized below:

 In the review and post-audit of disbursement vouchers (DVs) on the paid  high-

end expensive models/brands of electronic gadgets amounting to P446,637.76,which 

were procured through shopping for small value procurement ,. the Audit Team noted 

that purchase request wherein the purpose of procuring items was specified to filled up 

were  not supported to the DVs thus, to validation as to  the  necessity of usage of high 

end gadgets was not affirmed.  

 

We recommended and Management instruct the concerned officials to 

submit the purchase request for the procured items citing therein the purpose of 

procuring high-end gadgets.  as indicated in the above table for the evaluation of 

the Audit Team.

Non Liquidation of Cash Advances (CAs) at NCMF –CO and NCMF Regional Offices 

(ROs)  

8. In NCMF-CO and in nine  ROs  of NCMF Cash advances (CAs) totaling 
P117,128,562.93 remained unliquidated as at year end due to failure of the 

Accountable Officers to immediately render Liquidation Report (LR) ; and failure 

of the designated Acting Chief Accountant of NCMF-CO and Regional 

Accountants to ensure the proper granting and timely liquidation of CAs as 

required under Section 89 PD No. 1445 and COA Circular No. 97-002 dated 

February 10, 1997, resulting in the  accumulation of unliquidated CAs in those 

Offices.  

 

Section 89 of PD No. 1445 provide among others, that “a cash advance shall be 

reported on and liquidated as soon as the purpose for which it was given has been served 

and no additional cash advance shall be allowed to any official or employee unless the 

previous cash advance given to him is first settled or a proper accounting hereof is 

made.”  

 

COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 provides the rules and 

regulations governing the granting, utilization and liquidation of cash advances. It 

includes among others: 

 

4.1.3   The cash advance shall be reported on as soon as the purpose for which 

it was given has been served. 

 

4.4.2   The amount of cash advance shall be limited to the requirements for 2 

months. Within 5 days after the end of each month, the Accountable 

Officer shall submit a Report of Disbursements. Additional cash 

advances shall be granted on the basis of the activity budget or the 

requirements for two months whichever is lower. 

 

5.1.3 Cash advances for local travels shall be liquidated within 30 days after 

arrival of the accountable officer to his pertinent official station. 

 

5.7     When a cash advance is no longer needed or has not been used for a 

period of two (2) months, it must be returned to or refunded 

immediately to the collection officer. 

 

5.8      All cash advances shall be fully liquidated at the end of each year. 

 

In NCMF-CO and in NCMF ROs, listed in the table below showed the amount 

of unliquidated CAs and the related reasons/control gaps for the non-liquidation of the 

granted  CAs.

Northern Luzon I,II,III 9,755,338,91  granting and liquidation of CAs were 
not properly monitored and controlled, 

in previous years, 

South Luzon IV A & B 526,100.00  practice of management in granting 
cash advances despite the non-

settlement of the previous cash 

advances, 

  transfer of CAs from one accountable 
officer to another, and  

 non-liquidation of CAs beyond the 
reglementary period 

National Capital Region 568,588.07  two or more CAs for different 
purposes were granted to the 

Accountable Officer on the same day; 

and 

 there were CAs the purposes of which 
had already been served which were 

either unliquidated or partially 

liquidated but additional CAs were 

still granted. 

 

Visayas I, VII & VIII  224,500.00  CAs given for a specific purpose were

same will remain unliquidated at year 

end; 

 two or more CAs for different 
purposes were granted to the

52 

 

Unliquidated Cash Advances  
as of December 31, 2020 

Office/Regional Offices Amount (P) Reasons for non-liquidations/ 

 
XI- Davao City 202,250.00  Failure to reclassify  the amount of 

CAs of one SDO who were already 

dead but still has an outstanding CAs. 

 Documents for the liquidation of the 

cash advances on Muslim Survey were 

submitted to the Accountant before the 

implementation of the ECQ but were 

forgotten by the Accountant, thus the 

accountable officers were not 

immediately informed of their 

incomplete submission of documents;  

 

 COVID-19 Fund CA still lacked 

signatures of beneficiaries thus, still 

unliquidated as at year-end; and  

 

 The liquidation documents for 

Training and Seminar and Legal 

Education Program were not yet 

submitted to the Accountant as at year-

end.    

   

XII  Cotabato 733,625.00  Liquidation documents were not 

supported with proper and complete 

documents and expenses for agencies 

activities were paid thru CAs instead 

of direct payments to suppliers and 

other similar expenses thus, 

accumulation of unliquidated 

advances arise.. 

XIII CARAGA 700,000.00   Advances on the payment of salaries 

and wages of 16 individuals hired 

under Contract of Services was not 

properly documented and contained 

various deficiencies. 

Total  17,128,562.93  

 

As gleaned in the table above the deficiencies noted were due to failure of the 

Accountable Officers to immediately render Liquidation Report (LR); and failure of the 

designated Acting Chief Accountant of NCMF-CO and Regional Accountants to ensure 

the proper granting and timely liquidation of CA. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to:  
 

a. Strengthen its control in the granting, utilization and liquidation of CAs by 
requiring the Accountant to maintain an updated subsidiary/general 



53 

 

ledger of CAs granted. Institute measures to ensure liquidation of CAs are 

in accordance with the provisions of COA Circular No. 97-002; and 

 

b. Direct the Acting Chief Accountant of NCMF-CO and all Regional 
Accountants to issue demand letters to accountable officers with long 

outstanding balances. Failure to liquidate the said CAs shall be a valid 

ground for the withholding of his/her salary and imposition of other 

sanctions, if warranted. 

 

 

Unrecognized Other Receivable  

9. In NCMF-CO, unliquidated CAs of retired, separated and employees who 
transferred to other government agencies were still recognized in the books as 

Advances to Officers and Employees instead of recognizing it as Other Receivables 

contrary to the provisions of  GAM for NGAs, Volume 3. 

 

Volume III of GAM for NGAs states that “Other Receivables is used to 

recognize amount due from debtors and other agencies not falling under any of the 

specific receivable account. This also includes receivables from individuals or entities 

intended for specific projects or purpose not falling under any of the specific receivable 

account and crediting the account as for payment/liquidation of receivables.” 

 

Verification from the record of Hunan Resource Development Division 

(HRDD) revealed that the following employees are no longer connected with NCMF 

as of December 31, 2020, but their unliquidated CAs were still recognized as Advances 

to Officers and Employees totaling P876,469.00 instead of recognizing it as Other 

Receivables. 

 

Moreover, the Acting Chief Accountant before processing any money claims of 

separated, retired or transferred employees should see to it that all obligations of the 

said employees are settled to avoid or minimize the unliquidated balances at year end. 

 

The following accountable officers/employees are no longer connected with 

NCMF as of December 31, 2020:

Sarip, Asnora             35,000.00  Retired  

Total           P876,469.00   

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

 instruct the Acting Chief Accountant to reclassify the amount of 
P876,469.00 to Other Receivable account; and 

 

 direct the Acting Chief Accountant to ensure that all obligations, either 
property or financial accountability of those employees who are 

retiring, separated and wish to transfer to other government agencies 

are first settled to avoid accumulation of unliquidated CAs. 

 

 

Unreverted Accounts and Other Payables 

 

10. In NCMF CO and NCMF SLO, Region IVA & B, the Accountant failed to 
automatically revert to the Accumulated Surplus or Deficit the undocumented 

dormant Accounts Payable and Other Payables balances in the Financial 

Statements amounting to P225,242.44 and P12,354,211.65 respectively, contrary to 

Section 98 of PD No. 1445 and Section 2 of the Executive Order (EO) No. 87. 

Section 98 of PD No. 1445, “the Commission on Audit, upon notice to the head 

of agency concerned, may revert any unliquidated balance of accounts payable in the 

books of the national government which has been outstanding for two years or more 

and against which no actual claim, administrative or judicial has been filed or which is 

not covered by perfected contracts on record.” 

 

Likewise, EO No. 87, s. 2019 dated August 13, 2019 and COA-DBM Joint 

Circular No. 1, s. 2021 dated March 8, 2021 requires that “all accounts payable which 

remain outstanding for two years or more in the books of national government agencies 

be reverted to the accumulated surplus or deficit of the general fund of the national 

government.” 

 

Section 2 of EO No. 87 states that “all accounts payable which are 

undocumented or not covered by perfected contracts on record, regardless of the year 



55 

 

in which they were incurred, shall automatically be reverted. The recording of 

undocumented accounts payable in the books of account of agencies shall be strictly 

prohibited.” 

 

Item 4.6 of COA-DBM Joint Circular No.1, s. 2021 states that “all government 

entities concerned shall prepare an inventory of Accounts Payables   incurred in FY 

2017 and years prior thereto, as of December 31, 2020. It shall reflect the name of 

creditor. Obligation Request and Status (ORS) Number, allotment class, funding 

source, year of incurrence and obligations, etc., shall be submitted to DBM and COA 

not later than June 30, 2021. Such inventory shall serve as one of the bases for reversion 

of the A/P and for the purpose of payment after reversion, subject to agency validation 

procedures.” 

 

The year-end balance  of Other Payable account in the Financial Statement of 

NCMF-CO as of  December 31, 2021 amounting to P12,354,211.65 pertains to the 

dormant liability recorded in the agency’s books since two years or more wherein no 

details/documents were available and the present Accountant has no knowledge to 

identify the nature of the liability and the corresponding creditor of the agency, hence, 

should have been automatically reverted to Accumulated Surplus or Deficit of the 

general fund pursuant to EO No. 87,s. 2019 and COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 1, s. 

2021. 

 

In CY 2020 the transactions recorded in this account from January to 

December,2020 were amounts withheld from salaries of officers and employees totaling 

P7,341,810.39 for the employee’s loans to Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) and 

NCMF Employee Association (NCMFEA) while amount remitted to LBP and 

NCMFEA for this period was totaled to P7,359,621.52 as shown in official receipts 

issued by LBP and NCMFEA. there was a discrepancy of P17,811.13 which was form 

part of the remittance of 2019. 

 

Moreover, in NCMF SLO-RO-IVA & B, the balance of Accounts Payable 

appearing in the FS amounting to P225,242.44 pertains to the dormant liability recorded 

in the agency’s books since CY2015 which no details/nor documents were available 

thereof and should have been automatically reverted to Accumulated Surplus or Deficit.  

 

We recommended that the Management of NCMF-CO and NCMF SLO 

RO-IVA & B instruct the Acting Chief Accountant and Regional Accountant to 

prepare an inventory of Other Payables incurred in FY 2017 and years prior 

thereto, as of December 31, 2020 and automatically revert to Accumulated Surplus 

or Deficit the undocumented and dormant Other Payable amounting to 

P12,354,211.65 and P225,242.44 respectively, in accordance with Section 2 of EO 

No. 87.

Non-deduction and non-remittance of taxes  on Year-End bonus  

11. In NCMF-CO, taxes from Mid-Year and Year-end Bonuses for CY 2019 
amounting to P2,015,163.59 were not deducted and unremitted in spite of the 

Memorandum issued by the Administrative Director to all concerned officials and 

employees, in violation of Section 9 (e) of RA No. 10963-TRAIN Law which 

resulted in overpayment of benefits, while depriving the government of the needed 

revenues. Further, the deficiency exposes the Accountant for possible penalties and 

interest for non-withholding of taxes as provided for in the NIRC. 

Section 9 (e) of RA No. 10963 or the “TRAIN Law” states that “the 13th month 

pay and other benefits as the gross benefits received by the officials and employees of 

public and private entities: Provided, however, that the total exclusion under this 

subparagraph shall not exceed Ninety Thousand Pesos (P90,000.00).” 

 

Sections 248 and 249 of the NIRC provides for the penalties and interest to wit: 

“SEC. 248. - Civil Penalties. 

  

A. There shall be imposed, in addition to the tax required to be paid, 
a penalty equivalent to twenty-five percent (25%) of the amount 

due, in the following cases:  

 

1. Failure to file any return and pay the tax due thereon as required 
under the provisions of this Code or rules and regulations on the 

date prescribed; or 

 

2. Unless otherwise authorized by the Commissioner, filing a return 
with an internal revenue officer other than those with whom the 

return is required to be filed; or 

 

3. Failure to pay the deficiency tax within the time prescribed for its 
payment in the notice of assessment; or  

 

4. Failure to pay the full or part of the amount of tax shown on any 
return required to be filed under the provisions of this Code or rules 

and regulations, or the full amount of tax due for which no return 

is required to be filed, on or before the date prescribed for its 

payment. 
 

SEC. 249. Interest. –  

In General. - There shall be assessed and collected on any unpaid amount of tax, 

interest at the rate of twenty percent (20%) per annum, or such higher rate as 

may be prescribed by rules and regulations, from the date prescribed for payment 

until the amount is fully paid.

Audit of the payment of CY 2019 Mid-Year and Year-End bonus of NCMF CO 

amounting to P10,433,653.00 and P11,703,636.30, respectively, or a total of 

P22,137,289.30 revealed that, no taxes were withheld, thus, deprived the government 

of revenues in the total amount of P2,140,517.59 based on the computation done by the 

Audit Team.  

 

The non-deduction of taxes from the benefits of the officials and employees who 

exceeded the ninety thousand pesos (P90,000.00) ceiling as stated in Section 9-(e) of 

TRAIN Law understated the account Due from Officers and Employees and Due to BIR 

account by P2,140,517.59 in CY 2019. thus, it must be recognized in the book of 

accounts of NCMF-CO. 

 

The Director, Administrative Service of NCMF CO, in compliance with the 

audit recommendation has issued a Memorandum dated September 14, 2020 to all 

concerned officials and employees assigned in NCMF-CO, notifying the overpayment 

of mid-year and year-end bonus for CY 2019 due to non-withholding of taxes and to 

refund and remit the same to the BIR until October 31, 2020 by individual filing using 

the BIR Form 1700 and payment thru Land Bank - Commonwealth Branch, Quezon 

City. 

 

However, upon inquiry with FMS Personnel of the status of refund of the 

concerned officials and employees, we learned that a total of P125,354.00 was remitted 

directly to the BIR, leaving a balance of P2,015,163.59 as of this date. 

 

The unremitted balance was due to non-implementation of our previous audit 

recommendation which is to recognize the receivables from officials and employees and 

Due to BIR. In effect, the concerned officials and employees assigned at NCMF-CO are 

not obliged to remit the taxes of their bonus received in CY2019. This also understated 

the balance of Due from Officers and Employees and Due to BIR account by 

P2,015,163.59 in CY 2020. 

 

This a reiteration of our previous audit findings incorporated in the Part II of the 

Consolidated Annual Audit Report (CAAR) for the year 2019. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

 require the Acting Chief Accountant to set-up the receivable and 
payable accounts for the non-deduction of the withholding tax of 

P2,015,163.59 by debiting the Due from Officers and Employees 

account and crediting the Due to BIR account by the same amount; 

 

 require the officials and employees to refund the overpayment of Mid-
Year and Year End Bonus totaling P2,015,163.59 by issuing a 

Memorandum as to one-time payment of concerned employees; and 
  



58 

 

 remit the tax on bonuses to the BIR totaling P2,015,163.59 to avoid the 
exposure of the Acting Chief Accountant for possible penalties and 

interest for withholding of taxes as provided for in the NIRC. 

 

 

Irregular hiring job order employees 

12. In NCMF-CO, 58 Job Order (JO) employees were hired and assigned at various 
offices performing jobs similar to the agencies regular employees with a total 

salaries of P5,020,500.00 in violation of CSC-COA Joint Circular No, 1,s. 2017. 

There are two limitations in hiring JO personnel as stated in Item 7.0 of the Civil 

Service Commission (CSC) – COA –DBM Joint Circular No. 1, s. 2017 dated June 15, 

2017, as follows: 

 

Item 7.1 - Hiring under contract of service shall be limited to 

consultants, learning service providers, and/or other technical experts 

to undertake special project or job within a specific period. The project 

or job is not part of the regular functions of the agency, or the expertise 

is not available in the agency, or it is impractical or more expensive for 

the government agency to directly undertake the service provided by 

the individual or institutional contractor. 

 

Item 7.3 – Contract of service and job order workers should not, in any 

case, be made to perform functions which are part of the job description 

of the agency’s existing regular employees.

As shown in the table above, there was a significant increase of expenses under 

the account Other General Services amounting to P8,653,475.10 or 270.77 percent 

which was due to the hiring of 58 JO personnel during the year 2020. The total number 

of JO employees increased from 21 in CY2019 to 67 JO employees as of November 

2020. 

 

The NCMF-CO have incurred a total of P5,020,500.00 for the newly hired 58 

JO employees during CY 2020 assigned at Administrative Service (AS), Bureau of 

Peace and Conflict Resolution (BPCR), Planning Service (PS), Bureau of Muslim 

Settlement (BMS), Bureau of Muslim Economic Affairs (BMEA), Finance

which the only names and period covered were change. 

 

The submitted accomplishments are not quantified and specifically indicated 

like for example as to the total number and what types of documents are encoded. Thus, 

we cannot validate the necessity of hiring JO employees at NCMF-CO. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the: 

 

 HRDD to comply with the aforementioned rules and regulations in the 
hiring of JOs and direct them to prepare and issue policies and 

guidelines to address the issue on the necessity and propriety of hiring 

JOs;  

 

 Acting Chief Accountant to require the JO employees to submit daily 
and quantified accomplishment reports to justify the necessity of their 

services; and 

 

 Directors of the AS, BPCR, PS, BMS, and BMEA to assess, review 
and/or justify the necessity of hiring JOs at their respective divisions 

considering the existence of regular employees who could perform the 

work. 
 

 

Salaries with disapproved appointment 

 

13. In NCMF-Zamboanga Peninsula RO-IX A salary and other emoluments 
amounting to P297, 004.59 as of December 31, 2020 were continuously paid to an 



60 

 

employee for services rendered despite disapproved/invalidated appointment by 

the Civil Service Commission (CSC). 

 

An employee holding the position of Attorney II under temporary appointment 

which was  disapproved by the CSC on its Decision No. 200426  dated July 27, 2020  

still  continue to render services and received salary and other emolument amounting to 

P297, 004.59 for the period July 22 to December 31, 2020 contrary to Section 9 (b) Rule 

IV of 2017 Omnibus Rules on Appointment and Other Human Resource Actions 

(ORAOHRA) revised July 2018, rendering the transactions irregular and without legal 

basis. 

 

Section 9 (b), Rule IV of 2017 ORAOHRA revised July 2018 states that “in no 

case shall a temporary appointment be issued for positions that involve practice of 

profession regulated by bar/board law for lack of required license and/or certificate of 

registration.” 

 

The concerned employee filed an appeal before the CSC Field Office-Social 

Security System (CSCFO-SSS) for the disapproval of her temporary appointment as 

Attorney II due to her failure to meet the required eligibility for the position. 

 

On July 27, 2020 the CSC-National Capital Region (NCR) promulgated a 

Decision No. 200426 dismissing the appeal filed for lack of merit and affirming the 

disapproval made by the CSCFO-SSS. 

  

Moreover, the Decision mandated the payment of the salary attached to the 

Attorney II position for actual services rendered from July 22, 2019 to July 21, 2020 

only as a de facto officer and the services rendered thereunder are considered as 

government services. 

 

However, despite the CSC Decision disapproving/invalidating the appointment, 

Management continues to pay the salaries of employee after July 21, 2020 which 

amounted to P297,004.59 as of December 31, 2020. Details of payments are as follows:

We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Chief of HRDD of 

NCMF-Zamboanga Peninsula-RO-IXA to terminate the services of the employee 



61 

 

and stop the payment of her salary and other emoluments pursuant to Section 108, 

Rule XI, 2017 ORAOHRA. 

 

Management in its written comment stated that the appointment of the employee 

was renewed on July 22, 2020 which explained why the employee was continuously 

paid her salary and other emoluments. 

 

The comment further stated that the Audit Team should address this observation 

to NCMF CO who continuously issue sub-allotment for the salary and the emolument 

of this employee. 

 

As a rejoinder, the Audit Team finds it odd or not in order that a 

disapproved/invalidated appointment by the CSC is subsequently renewed by the 

appointing authority. Nevertheless, payment of salaries and other emoluments must be 

supported with approved appointment.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the HRDD Chief of 

the RO-IXA to submit approved appointment to support the payment of salaries 

to the subject employee. 

 

Management informed the Audit Team during the exit conference that effective 

April 2021, payment of salary was stopped. However, NCMF CO issued a written 

instruction to pay the salaries still of the subject person despite her disapproved 

appointment, accordingly on account of her re-employment for the same position on 

July 22, 2020. 

 

At this point, the transactions are not supported with approved appointment, 

therefore highly irregular. 

 

 

Overpayment of Terminal Leave Benefits (TLB)  

 

14. In NCMF-CO, out of the total TLB of P1,805,610.70, there was overpayment in 
the amount of P130,943.06 noted due to the erroneous data of leave credits earned 

balances posted in the leave card. 

Re-computation and validation of the total leave credits earned by Mr. Guialil 

R. Kanda (retired Field Regional Director of NCMF-Davao) from May 30, 1986 to 

April 21, 2020 disclosed that his vacation leave earned was over by 38.75 days. The 

computed discrepancy starts from year 1992 onwards, thus, the TLB received by Mr. 

Kanda was overpaid by P130,943.06, as computed in the next page:

We recommended and Management agreed to require the: 

 

 Chief of the HRDD of NCMF - CO to carefully examine, review and 
validate the leave cards of the employees before issuing and certifying 

the Computation of Money Value; 

 

 HRDD personnel to recompute and record earned leave credits in the 
Leave Cards of employees to reflect the accurate total balance of leave 

credits of the concerned employee; and 

 

 Acting Chief Accountant to inform and require Mr. Kanda to refund 
the overpayment of his TLB in the amount of P130,943.06. 

 

 

Housing accommodation for Hajj CY 2019 

 

15. Out of the total disbursements of USD7,811,238.00 (P397,029,461.07) for the 
housing accommodations of pilgrims for Hajj season, initial audit of 30 percent 

thereof amounting to USD1.0 Million (P51.40 Million) disclosed deficiencies such 

as: a) the amount was paid through cash advances; b) official receipts issued 

differed in physical appearance; c) letter by MAAD to Consul General of the PCG 

at Jeddah, KSA dated April 25, 2019 seeking assistance to collect the 

SR7,560,000.00 from the NCMF when in fact, based on the submitted receipts, 

NCMF have already paid MAAD a total of P51.40 Million on APRIL 16, 2019; and 

d) no document to show the actual number of pilgrims accommodated in the hotel. 

While the remaining 70 percent or USD6,811,238.00 (P345,629,461.072) of the total 

disbursements transferred to the bank account of MAAD could not be validated 

pending submission of the official receipts and actual number of pilgrims for the 

payment received. 

 

Section 107 of PD No.1445 states that “in the absence of the provision of law, 

all accountable officers shall render their accounts, submit their vouchers and make 

deposits of money collected or held by them at such times and such manner shall be 

prescribed in the regulations of the Commission.” 

 

Section 4 (6) of PD No. 1445 provides that claims against government funds 

shall be supported with complete documentation. 

On December 13, 2018, the NCMF represented by its Secretary, entered into a 

housing accommodation contract with Maad Al Masiyah (MAAD) with office address 

at Makkah, KSA and represented by Mr. Abdalaziz Alsoat, Executive Director. MAAD 

provided the housing accommodation and other related services pertaining to 2019 Hajj 

for the duration of July 24, 2019 to August 31, 2019. 

 



63 

 

Among the agreements stipulated in the contract was that NCMF should pay 

4,200 Saudi Riyal (SR) per pilgrim in accordance with the following schedule by the 

MAAD, as follows: 

 

Payment Due Date Percentage 

First payment February 15, 2019 30 

Second payment March 20, 2019 30 

Third payment April 20, 2019 30 

Fourth payment August 20, 2019 10 

 

The total contract price was not stated in the housing contract since the final 

number of pilgrims were not yet determined on the date the housing contract was signed 

and agreed by MAAD and NCMF. However, based on the available bank statements as 

of December 31, 2019, which the NCMF provided to the Audit Team on May 27, 2021, 

it was noted that a total of mutawiff fees of USD7,811,238.00 or P397,029,461.07 was 

paid to the MAAD. 

 

On September 4, 2019, we conducted cash examination on the accountability of 

the said SDO. One of her accountabilities was the payment of housing accommodation 

for Hajj 2019 in the amount of US$1.0 Million or P51.4 million representing 30 percent 

payment to MAAD out of the total aforementioned mutawiff fees for the housing 

accommodation of the pilgrims, which the following deficiencies were noted in audit. 

  

1. For the first payment of US$500,000.00 payment – The MAAD issued 

acknowledgment receipt dated April 10, 2019 bearing the stationery/logo of the 

NCMF - Central Office for the first payment  

 

2. NCMF submitted four MAAD Official Receipts which have differences in the 
physical appearance, as presented in the table below.

3. There was a letter by MAAD to Consul General of the PCG at Jeddah, KSA dated 
April 25, 2019 seeking assistance to collect the SR7,560,000.00 from the NCMF. 

Considering the date of letter of MAAD to Consul General Badajos on April 25, 

2019, it provided doubt on why MAAD sought the assistance to collect the 

SR7,560,000.00 when in fact, based on the submitted receipts, NCMF have 

already paid MAAD a total of P51.40 Million on APRIL 16, 2019. 

 



64 

 

4. Based on the housing contract, the NCMF should pay the MAAD of SR4200 
Saudi Riyal per pilgrim, however, the NCMF paid the amount of P51.40 Million 

and was personally received by the MAAD Representative at NCMF – Central 

Office on April 16, 2021. The SDO alleged that the US$1.0 Million was encashed 

to Philippine currency of P51.40 Million because it was the instruction of her 

superior and also requested by MAAD, Executive Director to convert the USD1 

Million in Philippine Pesos. 

 

5. Different names and designations referring to the one (1) Representative from 

MAAD on various documents was submitted by the SDO,  

 

 

6. Unsubmitted documents to support the payment of the hotel accommodation such 

data showing the actual total number of pilgrims who attended the Hajj 2019 for 

our audit verification.

during Hajj 2019 as stated in the housing contract signed by the 

Executive Director/President of that company. This is  to validate the 

total actual number of Filipino pilgrims who stayed in that hotel. 
 

Ms. Junainah Nuska, SDO submitted justification letter noted by the NCMF 

Secretary dated March 3, 2021 wherein she explained the reasons for the deficiencies 

noted in the receipts, summarized as follows: 
 

 On the difference between the receipts submitted – Saudi Arabian laws 
on taxation and other laws do not require strict indication of invoice 

numbers in documents. However, after the cash examination by COA, the 

SDO has been warned that an official receipt not bearing an official receipt 

number might be flagged. Because of this, regardless of the business 

practices, customs and laws of Saudi Arabia, this Commission still 

requested MAAD to provide the receipts bearing the proper official receipt 

numbers as reflected in their books. After MAAD complied, the numbered 

official receipts were then submitted as liquidation documents to the 

Accounting Division. 

 

 On the submission of a guest list signed by the Executive 
Director/President of the service provider – This Commission would like 

to take note the cultural and customary context of the transactions given that 

the Hajj is the largest annual pilgrimage in the world. In this context, respect 

must be afforded to the business practices or customs of the limited number 

service providers who cater and serve to almost two to three million Hajj 

pilgrims annually. This Commission will be able to provide the names of 

the pilgrims in lieu of the requested guest list as both will reflect the same 

number. Also to provide further context, because of the big numbers of 

pilgrims that are billeted in all hotels in Saudi Arabia, the business practice 

or custom is to count passports corresponding to each pilgrim as they arrive. 

Saudi Hajj hotels do not keep checklists or guest’s information records in 

tracking the number of people of each pilgrim-sending country. 
 

Moreover, the SDO submitted her second justification letter noted by the 

NCMF Secretary dated May 25, 2021 on which she explained further the issue of 

submitted official receipts. On the issue of the use of NCMF Stationery as 

acknowledgment receipt, the Commission deemed it better to have the acknowledgment 

receipt written on official NCMF stationery to give it color of authority as warranted 

by the circumstance: the representative of MAAD brought only one (1) official receipt 

with him. As these official receipts are sourced from the MAAD office in the KSA and 

would need additional approvals to secure, an acknowledgment receipt was issued by 

the representative of MAAD Al-Masiyah with the promise to replace it with an official 

receipt. It does not matter what paper was used by the MAAD representative, what 

matters is this acknowledgment or provisional receipt was eventually replaced by an 



67 

 

official receipt. This also further explains the discrepancy in the dates of the official 

receipts. 
 

Auditor’s Rejoinder:  

 

The justification is noted, however the Audit Team will have to further evaluate the 

transaction upon submission of the above mentioned documents required in the audit 

recommendation.  
 
 

Disbursements paid through issuance of Modified Disbursement System (MDS) checks 

instead of using the Expanded Modified Direct Payment Scheme (ExMDPS) 

 

16. In NCMF CO, out of the total disbursements of P605,732,671.88 from the regular 

fund of NCMF as of December 31,2020, a total amount of P186,824,102.69 were paid 

through the issuance of MDS checks instead of using the ExMDPS thus, hindering 

the attainment of an efficient payment scheme contrary to the provisions of the 

DBM Circular Letter No. 2013-16 and DBM Circular Letter No. 2018-14. 

  

DBM Circular Letter No. 2013-16 dated December 23, 2013 and DBM Circular 

Letter No. 2018-14 dated December 28, 2018 mandated the NGAs to use the ExMDPS 

for payment of Accounts Payables (A/Ps) due to creditors/payees of all NGAs 

/Operating Units (NGAs/OUs). 

 

As defined in Item 5.9 of the DBM Circular Letter No. 2013-16, ExMDPS refers 

to the payment procedure whereby the MDS, Government Servicing Banks (MDS-

GSB) shall pay the creditors/payees listed in the List of Due and Demandable Accounts 

Payable with Advice to Debit Account (LDDAP-ADA) not later than 48 hours but not 

earlier than 24 hours upon receipt of the said document from the NGAs/OUs, thru: 

 

 Direct credit to the creditors current/savings/Automatic Teller Machine 
(ATM) account (CA/SA/ATM) maintained with the MDS-GSB; or 

 

 Bank transfer, if creditor’s account is maintained outside the agency’s 
MDS-GSB where corresponding bank charges shall be borne/paid by the 

creditor/payee concerned. 

 

Both Circulars provided the exclusions specifically in Item 4 of DBM Circular 

Letter No. 2013-16 and Items 3.1 and 3.4 of DBM Circular Letter No.2018-14 whereby 

the NGAs allowed the issuance of MDS checks in payment of the following 

disbursements:

Item 3.4 of DBM Circular Letter 

No. 2018-14 

Creditors/suppliers who cannot be conveniently nor 

practicably be paid using the ADA as determined by 

the Agency Head, may continue to be paid through 

issuance of MDS checks or cash. These accounts 

include: 

 

 3.4.1 Small value creditors/payees with claims 

during the year costing P10,000 and below, e.g., 

government scholars, recipients of DOLE's 

Special Program for the Employment of Students 

(SPES)  

 

 3.4.2 Creditor/payee of the agency with non-

regular transaction or one time transaction during 

the year, e.g., Right-of-Way claimants, 

relocation expenses for informal settlers and 

others  

 

 3.4.3 Companies which are not authorized, per 

their internal policy, to open current accounts in 

addition to their existing accounts. 

 

Review of disbursement in NCMF-CO disclosed that it continued to pay its 

suppliers thru checks.  Some suppliers were unwilling to open an account with the LBP 

as most of the them only had one-time transaction with the NCMF while other creditors 

have an existing account with the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP), thus, opening 

of account would be an additional burden for them.  

 

In CY 2020 the NCMF- CO had issued 1,125 MDS checks (net of 130 pcs of 

cancelled checks) with check numbers 468606 to 469860 in payment of disbursements 

amounting to P186,824,102.69, summarized below:

69 

 

As a result of the NCMF’s partial compliance with the implementation of the 

use the ExMDPS for payment of Accounts Payables due to creditors/payee, the 

objective of an efficient payment scheme to minimize the volume of outstanding checks 

was not fully attained. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Acting Director 

of Finance and Management Division to implement the use of ExMDPS in 

settlement of A/Ps due to creditors/payees as required in DBM Circular Letter No. 

2013-16 and DBM Circular Letter No. 2018-14. 

 

 

Disbursement not duly supported with complete documentation 

 

17. In NCMF-CO and in five (5) ROs of NCMF disbursements totaling P34,395,586.59 
for CY 2020 were paid and processed without proper documentation contrary to 

Section 4.6 of PD No. 1445 and COA Circular No. 2012-001, thus validity and 

regularity of expenses were doubtful.  

 

COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 prescribed the revised 

documentary requirements for common government transactions. It provides the 

checklist of specific documentary requirements for each type of disbursement. 

 

In NCMF –CO and in five NCMF-ROs review and post-audit of various 

disbursements totaling to P18,256,421.23 for CY 2020 disclosed that some transactions 

were not duly supported with complete documentations as required under the

Validity, regularity and completeness of supporting documents in every 

disbursement must be adhere to in compliance of Section 4(6) of the Fundamental 

Principles that claims against government funds shall be supported with complete 

documentation. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Acting Chief 

Accountant of NCMF-CO and Regional Accountants of NCMF-ROs and 

responsible officials to strictly comply with the prescribed submission of 

documents to facilitate the complete review and audit of transactions for the year 

and determine the validity, existence occurrence completeness and regularity of 

the claims. 

 

 

Delayed submission of financial reports (FRs) 

 

18. In NCMF-CO and five (5) ROs of NCMF,  year-end financial reports and its 
supporting documents and Consolidated Financial Reports for CY 2020 were not 

submitted to the Audit Team within the prescribed period, which delayed range 

from 131 to 426 days and contrary to the rules and regulations pertaining thereto, 

thus, preventing the timely evaluation for an early detection and immediate 

communication to management of deficiencies, if any, and the corresponding 

corrective actions to be undertaken. 



72 

 

 

 

 

Section 41(2) of PD No. 1445 provides that: 

 

The chief accountant or the official in charge of keeping the 

accounts of a government agency shall submit to the 

Commission year-end trial balances and such other supporting 

or subsidiary statements as may be required by the 

Commission not later than the fourteenth day of February 

 

Seq. No. 20, Note 4, Section 59, Chapter 19, Volume 1 of GAM for NGAs 

provides that “the frequency of submission of Pre-Closing Trial Balance/Post-Closing 

Trial Balance and other reports shall be as follows: 

 

 Pre-closing Trial Balance and other reports – monthly, within ten 
days after the end of the month to the COA Resident Auditor and 

DBM 

 

 Year-end Pre-Closing Trial Balance/Post-Closing Trial Balance 
and other reports – on or before February 14 of the following 

year to the COA Resident Auditor, DBM and Government 

Accountancy Sector, COA.” 

 

Further, Section 74 of PD No. 1445 requires the Head of the Agency to see to it 

that reconciliation is made between the balance shown in the monthly reports of 

depositories (bank statements) and the balance found in the books of the agency.  

Meanwhile, Section 7, Chapter 21, Volume I of GAM for NGAs requires that the Chief 

Accountant shall submit the BRS within twenty days after receipt of the monthly Bank 

Statements (BS) to the following: 

 

Original – COA Auditor (with all the supporting documents and  

                  JEVs)

Section 6, Paragraph d, Chapter 19, Volume I of GAM for NGAs states that if 

there is an undue delay in the reporting of information, it may lose its relevance; thus, 

significant information that would aid in making decisions and pertinent comments 

concerning the recurring deficiencies found in audit would not be immediately 

communicated to management. 

 

The same section and paragraph requires timeliness as one of the qualitative 

characteristics of financial reporting.  The usefulness of financial statements is impaired 

if they are not made available to users within a reasonable period after the reporting 

date.  Ongoing factors such as the complexity of an entity’s operations are not sufficient 

reason for failing to report on a timely basis. 

 

Further, Section 4, Chapter 19, Volume 1 of GAM for NGAs provides that “the 

responsibility for the fair presentation and reliability of financial statements rests with 

the management of the reporting entity, particularly the head of finance/accounting 

office and the head of entity or his authorized representative.” 

 

Section 122 (2) provides the sanctions for non-submission of reports, as quoted 

below: 

 

Failure on the part of the officials concerned to submit the 

documents and reports mentioned herein shall automatically 

cause the suspension of payment of their salaries until they 

shall have complied with the requirements of the Commission. 



74 

 

 

During the entrance conference with management the reasons for the delay on 

submission of required financial reports and other reports were the following: 

 

 Some of the Accounting Personnel were not reporting in the 
office due to the lockdown and work-from-home arrangement;  

 Delay in the submission of the bank reconciliation statements due 
to reshuffling of Philippine National Bank (PNB) personnel with 

the bank system still locked, hence up to now they are still 

requesting from PNB the updated bank statements; 

 Reassignment of NCMF-Central Office Personnel to other 
NCMF Regional Offices. 

 

As a result of the non-compliance with the required deadlines in the submission 

of reports, any flaw that should have been seen in the early review of reports and the 

corresponding corrective action is hampered. The delay in the submission of reports 

also deprived the Agency the opportunity of a timely audit that would serve as input in 

enhancing financial accountability. 

 

To date, the financial reports presented in the table above were not yet submitted 

to the Audit Team, with regard to these the Office of the Executive Director issued 

memorandum to concerned offices dated May 25, 2021 with subject of instruction to 

comply and submit all necessary documents committed and agreed by the concerned 

officials to the Audit Team during the conduct of an exit conference and instructed  the 

Director of Finance to monitor compliance and submit status update/report to the Office 

of the Secretary (OSEC). Further, in his memo, the Executive Director stated that he 

has not received any written report of any nature that requires assistance of the OSEC 

or the Office of the Executive Director (OED) to ask other offices or units to 

immediately comply with any of their requests to complete the submission of required 

documents to the Audit Team/ 

 

In NCMF-SLO-RO-IVA & B, the delayed submission of financial reports and 

DVs with supporting documents ranged from one month to eight (8) months. The 

submission which is ten days of the ensuing month was not complied as shown below:

The Accountant commented that the delay in the submission of reports for 

CY2020 was due to COVID-19 Pandemic, but promise to comply with the submission 

of the required reports within prescribed schedule of submission. 

  

Moreover in NCMF Zamboanga Peninsula RO-IXA DVs, LRs, TBs, BRS  and 

other required reports were not submitted within the deadline prescribed under Section 

60, Chapter 19, Volume 1 of  GAM for NGAs and COA Circular No. 95-006.

the disbursement records with all paid vouchers and documents evidencing the 

transaction to the Auditor within ten (10) days from date of receipt of said documents.

Submission was demanded through a demand letter dated December 28, 2020. 

The above tables are only some of the reports that were monitored unsubmitted. 

 

During the exit conference the Regional Accountant take note of the deadlines 

of submission of report. She was new to the position and that documents are submitted 

and turned over to her late. Management subsequently assured that a directive would be 

issued as regards to timely submission of reports by the Accounting Office to the Audit 

Team.  

 

Further in NCMF BARMM-RO-IX-B the Accountant incurred delayed in 

submission of monthly and quarterly transaction reports which hampers the timely 

audit of transactions and communications of its results. 

 

As validated and per verified record, monthly transaction reports such as RCI; 

and RD together with paid DVs and/payrolls, and other supporting documents were not 

submitted promptly to the Audit Team for post-audit.  

Delayed submission of monthly transaction reports, and other supporting 

documentations is a clear violation of existing COA rules and regulations hence, this 

should be given much attention for it hampered the conduct of examination and audit 

of accounts and operations of the agency concerned.  

In NCMF RO-XIII CARAGA non-submission of the Agency’s year-end 

financial reports and accounts precluded the Audit Team and other end-users of the 

financial statements for the timely evaluation and analysis, and in the course of an audit 

and decision-making purposes.  

 

Several follow ups were made to management for its submission but, as of 

writing the report the complete set of FRs and its supporting documents remained 

unsubmitted to the Audit Team thus, hindered the team to verify and validate financial 

transactions of the agency. 

 

The Audit Team has not yet received a written reply from Management relative 

to the audit observation. Nevertheless, they received the following components of the 

financial statements for CY 2020 from the Acting Accountant on March 2, 2021, to wit  

 

1. Statement of Financial Position 
2. Statement of Financial Performance 
3. Statement of Cash Flows 
4. Statement of Changes in Net Assets/Equity 
5. Notes to Financial Statements 
 

The Statement of Comparison of Budget and Actual Amounts for CY 2020 was 

submitted to the Audit Team on March 25, 2021. Also, Management submitted on the 

same date the Management Representation Letter addressed to the OIC-Audit Team 



78 

 

Leader and OIC-Regional Supervising Auditor, duly signed by the Chief Administrative 

Officer and Regional Director. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a) Require concerned officers to submit on time the FRs and the required 
documents as prescribed under Section 59, Chapter 19, Volume I of 

GAM for NGAs,  and Section 41 (2) of PD No. 1445 and 

 

b) impose the suspension of payment of salaries of the accountable officers 
who repeatedly failed to submit on time the required documents and 

reports, as mandated in Section 122 of PD No. 1445;

Gender and Development (GAD) activities 

 

20. NCMF CO and ROs NCR, SLO, NLO,  Visayas,, NMO, IXA, and XIIA have 

implemented GAD related activities addressing gender issues;  while RO XIII 

management failed to submit GAD plans and accomplishment report for CY2020.  

The implementation of the GAD related projects/activities is pursuant to 

provisions of Section 31 of the GAA for Fiscal Year 2020.  

Section 31 of GAA for FY 2020 requires, among others, that all agencies of the 

government shall formulate a GAD Plan designed to address gender issues within their 

concerned sectors or mandate and implement the applicable provisions under RA No. 

9710 or the Magna Carta of Women, Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 

Discrimination Against Women, the Beijing Platform for Action, the Philippine Plan 

for Gender-Responsive Development (1995-2025) and the Philippine Development 

Plan (2017-2022).  

 

The GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of the agencies, which 

shall be at least five percent (5%) of their total budgets. For this purpose, activities 

currently being undertaken by agencies which relate to GAD or those that contribute of 

poverty alleviation, economic empowerment especially of marginalized women, 

protection, promotion, and fulfilment of women’s human rights and practice of gender-

responsive governance are considered sufficient compliance with said requirement. 

Utilization of the GAD budget shall be evaluated based on the GAD performance 

indicators identified by said agencies. The preparations and submission of the annual 

GAD Plan and annual GAD Accomplishment Report shall be subject to the guidelines 

issued by the agency concerned. 

 

The Magna Carta on Women or RA 9710, in its Implementing Rules and 

Regulations (IRR) and the Phil. Commission on Women (PCW) Memorandum Circular 

No. 2011-01 mandates the establishment and/or strengthening of the GAD Focal Point 

System by all government agencies. 

 

Specifically, Section 37 (C), Rule VI of the IRR of RA 9710 states that: All 

government departments including their attached agencies, offices, bureaus, SUCs, 

GOCCs, LGUs, and other government instrumentalities shall establish or strengthen 

their GFP System or a similar GAD mechanism to catalyze and accelerate gender 

mainstreaming within the agency or LGU. The head of agencies or LCEs shall sign 

appropriate issuances to institutionalize the creation of the GFP in their respective 

agencies or LGUs. The tasks and functions of the members of the GFP shall form part 

of their regular key result areas and shall be given due consideration in their 

performance evaluation. 

 

The implementation of GAD in NCMF SLO was centralized. The NCMF-CO 

prepares GAD plan endorsed to Philippine Commission on Women (PCW) and each 



80 

 

NCMF-ROs downloaded it with the corresponding budget. For CY 2020, the NCMF-

SLO had implemented GAD projects and programs totaling P1,156,372.06, as follows:

In NCMF-Region XI Davao City, the Management conducted GAD activities 

during the year 2020. Its corresponding accomplishment report will be submitted to the 

Audit team in the following year 2021. 

 

The NCMF NLO failed to appropriate at least five percent (5%) of the Agency’s 

budget for GAD programs, projects and activities for CY 2020. The Agency was able 

to utilize the total amount appropriated for their GAD programs, projects and activities, 

however, it showed that compared to the required amount of 5% or Ᵽ1,502,135.27, the 

amount of Ᵽ200,000.00 which was allocated and utilized for GAD programs was far too 

low, hence, not in accordance with Section 32 of the GAA for FY 2020.

The five percent (5%) funding allocation of the NCMF-Region XIIA for GAD 

for CY 2020 is P1,750,008.10. Of this amount, P20,000.00 or 0.057% was utilized for 

GAD activities particularly on conduct of seminar on National Women’s Month 

Celebration. 
 



81 

 

In NCMF-Region IXA, the Agency has no GAD Focal Point System (GFPS), 

thus affects the monitoring and assessment of gender-responsiveness of systems, 

structures, policies, programs, processes, and procedures of the agency based on the 

priority needs of the Regional Office. 

 

 

Senior Citizens and Persons with Disability 

 

21. NCMF-CO, NCR SLO Region IV-A&B and NMO Region X and Davao City 
Region XI, have implemented the projects for senior citizens and persons with 

disability. However, in NCMF ROs NLO-I,II,III,-Visayas VI,VII VIIII, 

Zamboanga Peninsula IXA, NMO X, Cotabato XIIA and CARAGA-XIII failed to 

integrate programs/projects related to senior citizens and persons with disability 

in their regular activities for CY 2020 implementation of projects/activities for 

Senior Citizens and Persons with Disability is required under Section 32 of the 

General Provisions of the GAA for FY 2020. 

, 
Section 32 of the GAA for FY 2020 provides that:  

 

 “All agencies of the government shall formulate plans, programs and 

projects intended to address the concerns of senior citizens and persons 

with disability, insofar as it relates to their mandated functions, and 

integrate the same in their regular activities. 

   

Moreover, all government infrastructures and facilities shall provide 

architectural or structural features, designs or facilities that will reasonably enhance the 

mobility, safety and welfare of persons with disability pursuant to Batas Pambansa Blg. 

344 and R.A. 7277, as amended.” 

 

 NCMF NLO I, II & III prepared and submitted its plans, programs and projects 

and accomplishment report intended to address the concerns of senior citizens and 

persons with disability.  

 

The reported programs and projects include free flu vaccines for senior citizens 

in the cities of San Fernando, Angeles and Baguio and free blood pressure taking and 

free blood sugar testing in Zambales and Cagayan. 

 

Accomplishment Report for senior citizens and PWDs for CY 2020 showed that 

NCMF-NLO failed to execute or fully implement the planned activities. Out of two 

programs/projects that they commit, only one was realized, as shown on the table in the 

next page:  

 

 

 

 

 



82 

 

 

The agency’s failure to comply fully with the provisions of the GAA for FY 

2020 deprives the supposed beneficiaries of the programs, the senior citizens and 

differently abled persons. 

 

Likewise, in NCMF ROs Visayas VI, VII, VIII, Zamboanga Penisula IX-A, 

Cotabato XIIA and CARAGA XIII, verification showed that they failed to integrate 

programs and projects related to senior citizens and the differently-abled persons in its 

regular activities, agency performance measures, budget, and annual work and financial 

plans for CY 2020. 

 

 Management of NCMF-Region IXA during the exit conference admitted that 

there were no specific plans and programs undertaken in 2020 for senior citizens and 

differently-abled persons. However, in the implementation of the GAD program of the 

agency, they were given priority. As to the structure, the office building has ramps and 

prioritizes them in the services rendered by the office. 
 

However, in NCMF-CO under the Bureau of Management and Settlements 

Office they have implemented the projects for senior citizens a NCR SLO Region IV-

A&B and NMO Region X and Davao City Region XI, have implemented the projects 

for senior citizens and persons with disability pursuant to Section 32 of the General 

Provisions of the GAA for FY 2020 

 

Verifications of the agency’s compliance on the provisions of the above cited 

provisions revealed that for CY 2020, the were able to implement programs as it relates 

to their mandated functions and integrated in their regular activities as follows: 

 

a. Conduct of Legal Education on the Muslim communities including women, 
men and senior citizens on their pertinent rights in accordance with laws.

22. Mainstreaming of Disaster Risk Reduction and Climate Change Adaptation and 
Mitigation 

 

Section 36 of the General Provisions of RA No. 11465 otherwise known as the 

GAA of 2020 provides that “all agencies of the government shall plan and implement 

programs and projects, taking into consideration measures for climate change adaptation 

and mitigation, and disaster risk reduction, based on climate and disaster risk 

assessments. National Government Agencies (NGAs) shall report their climate actions 

to the CCC for monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of the National Climate 

Change Action Plan. 

 

The NCMF Region IXA failed to allocate funds for the Disaster Risk and 

Reduction Management (DRRM) to implement programs, projects and activities 

designed to enhance climate change adaptation and mitigation and disaster risk 

reduction at the national and local community levels pursuant to the Climate Change 

Act of 2009.  According to the Budget Officer, there was no advice from the Central 

Office to allocate funds for this purpose. 

 

Moreover, in NCMF Region XIIB, Lanao as a response to the subsequent hitting 

Mindanao, conducted a Disaster Awareness and Preparedness Program and was themed 

“Paghanda sa Sakuna, Iwas Salanta”.  The objective of the program is to educate the 

participants on the impact of disasters and concepts of preparedness that includes the 

topics on Disaster and Safety Awareness, First Aid and Fire disaster management. 

 

 

23. Tax Laws and Regulations, GSIS Premiums and other Loan Amortization, and

 Pag-IBIG Premium Deductions and Remittances 
 

The NCMF has an ending balance of P270,614.83 representing unremitted withheld 

payments and unreconciled balances from prior years. On the other hand the total 

contributions were all promptly remitted in pursuance to Section 3 of the IRR of RA No, 

9679, otherwise known as the Pag-IBIG Fund Act. 

 

 

 PhilHealth Contributions and Remittances 
 

Except for the noted balance of P485,777.52, the NCMF has substantially complied 

and has remitted all due contributions deducted from salaries of its personnel and the 

government share pursuant to the Revised IRR of RA No. 9241 (amending RA No. 7875) 

known as the National Health Insurance Act. 

 

 

 GSIS Property Insurance Law 
 

Insurable properties of NCMF-ROs SLO IVA & B with net book value amounting 

to P1.0 million  and Zamboanga Peninsula -IXA totaling totaling ₱3.240 million 

were not insured with General Insurance Fund (GIF) administered by the GSIS, 

which deprived the Management of any indemnity in case of loss or damage thereof 

as required in the provisions set forth in RA No. 656 and COA Circular No. 92-391 

dated November 17, 1992. 
 

RA No. 656, as amended, mandates all government agencies to insure all their 

insurable properties, assets, and interests with the GIF of the GSIS in order to indemnify 

the government from any loss or damage to property against loss due to fire, earthquake, 

storm or other fortuitous event. 

 

Moreover, COA Circular No. 92-390 dated November 17, 1992 requires that all 

heads of the national agencies shall be responsible for the preparation and submission 

of the inventory of all insurable physical assets to the nearest GSIS branch/office.  The 

inventory shall be undertaken every year thereafter and shall be submitted not later than 

October 31 of the ensuing year.

For CY 2020, total insurable properties of the NCMF RO IXA based on the 

verification of Financial Statements was ₱3,240,755.77, with a related accumulated 

depreciation of ₱2,364,285.57, thereby showing a net book value of ₱876,470.20.  We 

observed that the PPE were not covered or insured with the GIF administered by the 

GSIS.  Below is the breakdown of these properties:

P3,240,755.77  ₱2,364,285.57             ₱ 876,470.20  

  

Absence of insurance coverage of the above-mentioned insurable assets with the 

GIF deprived the agency of any indemnity in case of loss or damage thereof. 

 

Moreover, in NCMF SLO IVA & B, verification of the records of the agency 

revealed that the properties of the agency amounting to P1,000,362.96 as of December 

31, 2020 were not insured with the GIF. 

   

The non-insurance of the properties was due to no fund for the payment of 

insurance premiums was sub-allotted and received from the NCMF-CO for CY 2020 

thus, the non-insurance of agency’s properties exposes the government to the 

unnecessary losses in the event of damage to or loss of such insurable assets/ properties 

due to fire, earthquake, storm or other fortuitous events.  

 

This is a reiteration of the previous year’s observation, which recommendations 

remained unimplemented in CY 2020.  

 

We recommended and Management of NCMF SLO IVA & B agreed that 

to protect their properties through insurance with the GIF of the GSIS,  they will 

make strong representations with NCMF Central Office for funds for this purpose 

as an addition to their MOOE.  

 

a. Management protect its properties through insurance with in 
compliance with COA Circular No. 92-390 and RA 656, as amended.

b. Management make strong representations with NCMF Central Office 
for funds for this purpose as an addition to the MOOE of NCMF 

Region IXA.
