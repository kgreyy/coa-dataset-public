EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 

 

A      Introduction 

   

The National Commission on Muslim Filipinos (NCMF) was formally 

organized on February 18, 2010 pursuant to Republic Act (RA) No. 9997, and took 

over the function of the Office on Muslim Affairs (OMA) which was abolished by 

this Act. The NCMF was formerly one of the attached agencies under the Office of 

the President (OP) - Other Executive Offices but with the enactment of Executive 

Order (EO) No. 67 on October 31, 2019, which rationalized the OP through the 

consolidation of its mandates and strengthening the democratic and institutional 

framework of the Executive Department, the NCMF was placed under the 

supervision of the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG).  

 

NCMF is mandated to promote and preserve the welfare of Muslim Filipinos 

to make them active participants in nation-building with due consideration to their 

beliefs, customs culture, traditions and well-being, in conformity with the country’s 

laws and in consonance with national unity and development. 

 

NCMF is the primary government agency that formulates and implements 

policies, plans and programs for the preservation and development of culture, 

traditions, institutions and well-being of Muslim Filipinos and the implementation of 

economic, educational, cultural and infrastructure programs for Muslim Filipino 

communities with due regard to their beliefs, customs, traditions and institutions.  

 

The NCMF is composed of nine full time members who are Muslim Filipinos 

and is headed by a Commission Chairman/Secretary, who is appointed with a term 

of two years by the President.  Together with the Secretary, there are eight 

commissioners representing the religious sector, women sector, and youth sector and 

the remaining five, each from a different tribe. Not more than two of the 

Commissioners shall come from the same Muslim Filipino tribe at any given time. 

Unlike the Secretary position, the Commissioners has a 4-year term limit and all of 

these positions are appointed by the President. 

 

The NCMF is currently headed by Atty. Saidamen B. Pangarungan. The 

NCMF has a total personnel complement of 811 as of December 31, 2020 including 

the 11 Regional Offices (ROs), details are shown below:

The Statement of Appropriations, Allotments, Obligations, Disbursements

D.      Scope of Audit 

 

The audit was conducted to: a) ascertain the level of assurance that may be 

placed on the Management’s assertion on the financial statements; b) determine the 

propriety of transactions as well as extent of compliance on the applicable laws, rules 

and regulations; c) recommend agency improvement opportunities; d) determine the 



v 
 

extent of implementation of prior year’s audit recommendations. Moreover, the audit 

was conducted in accordance with International Standards of Supreme Audit 

Institutions (ISSAIs). 

 

 

E.    Independent Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements  

 

The Auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the 

consolidated financial statements of NCMF as at December 31, 2020 due to:  

 

1. Non-recognition in the books of NCMF of the transferred Property, Plant and 

Equipment (PPE) to Regional Offices (ROs) totaling P6,400,867.20, resulted 

in the overstatement of PPE accounts by the same amount, and 

 

2. The non-reversion of undocumented and dormant payable accounts resulted in 

overstatement of Other Payables by P12,354,211.65 and Accounts Payable by 

P225,242.44 with corresponding understatement of Accumulated 

Surplus/(Deficit) by a total of P12,579,454.09. 

 

 

F.     Other Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations  

 

The following are the other significant audit observations and the 

corresponding recommendations, which were discussed with Management officials 

concerned during the exit conference via zoom on May 24, 2021, details of which are 

discussed in the Part II of this report. Management views and comments are 

incorporated in the report, where appropriate. 

 

1. The funds transferred to the Supreme Court of the Philippines (SCP) covered by 
Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with NCMF in the amount of P533,440.00 has 

remained unliquidated contrary to COA Circular No. 94-013. (Paragraph No. 2) 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Acting Chief Accountant 

to demand SCP the liquidation of the fund transferred in the amount of P533,440.00 

and recognize immediately in the books of accounts once the 

liquidation/disbursement report is received from SCP. 

 

2. Discrepancy noted in the amount of P11,831,138.37 as of December 31, 2020 
between the records of NCMF and Procurement Service-Department of Budget 

Management (PS-DBM) on the procurement of office supplies, equipment and 

airfare tickets. (Paragraph No. 3) 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Acting Chief Accountant 

to prepare adjusting entries to recognize the deliveries and the utilized GFA-air 



vi 
 

tickets and request for refund from the PS-DBM for those undelivered office supplies 

in prior years for remittance to the Bureau of Treasury (BTr). 

 

3. The accuracy, completeness and existence of  Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) 
with carrying amount of P65,903,463.22 cannot be ascertained due to : (a) failure to 

conduct annual physical count and preparation and submission of the Report of 

Physical Count of PPE (RPCPPE);  (b) non-recognition in the books of NCMF - CO 

transferred PPE to NCMF - ROs; (c) lack of documents to support derecognition of 

a lost motor vehicle in NCMF Visayas Region;  (d) non-maintenance of PPE Ledger 

Card (PPELC) and Property Cards (PCs) and non-issuance of PARs; and  e) procured 

100 units of Microsoft Office licenses of P1,689,178.40 were erroneously recognized 

as Information and Computer Technology Equipment (ICTE) account. (Paragraph 

no. 6) 

 

We recommended and Management agreed that: 

 

a) in NCMF-CO and NCMF-Regional Offices Northern Luzon (I,,II,III); 
Zamboanga Peninsula IX-A, Jolo, Sulu, IX-B; Davao City XI;  Lanao XII-B; 

and CARAGA  XIII  

i. ensure that the Inventory Committee conduct promptly the physical count 
of all PPEs, and submit the RPCPPE duly certified by the Inventory 

Committee and approved by the Head of the Agency to the Audit Team; and 

reconcile the results of the Inventory of PPE with Accounting records.  

ii. instruct the Property Custodian/ Supply Officer and the Accountant in 
NCMF NMO Region X to reconcile the balances of accounts arrived per 

physical count with the SL and GL of the Accounting Division and ensure 

that the PPE balances reflected in the financial statement are supported by 

PPELC and reconciled with the RPCPPE; 

 

b) NCMF-CO and NCMF XII-A 
 

i. instruct the Acting Chief Accountant to record the necessary adjusting 
journal entries in the books of NCMF-CO by debiting Subsidy to Regional 

Offices and crediting ICTE account by P6,400,867.20. 

 

ii. to instruct the Regional Accountant of NCMF Region XII-A to prepare

i. submit the duly notarized Report of Lost, Stolen, Damaged, Destroyed 
Property (RLSDDP) by the Accountable Officer as provided in Appendix 



vii 
 

75 of the GAM to support the derecognition from the books of the lost 

vehicle; and,

depreciated replacement cost to record accountability of the accountable 

officer with the following entry:  

 

Account  Title  Account Code  Debit  Credit  

Due from Officers and 

Employees  

10305020  XXX     

  Other Deferred Credits  20501990     XXX  

 To set up the accountability of the 

accountable officer 

  

 

d) NCMF-CO  
 

i. direct the Acting Chief Accountant and Acting Chief of GSD to prepare and 
maintain the PPELC and PC, respectively, and the Property Officer to issue 

the PAR for properties with acquisition cost of P15,000.00 and above 

establish accountability over them.  Henceforth, conduct periodic 

reconciliation of the PC against the issued PARs and the PPELCs of the 

Accounting Division. 
 

e) NCMF-CO 
 

i. direct the Acting Chief Accountant to recognize the adjusting journal entry 
by debiting Computer Software and crediting ICTE account by 

P1,689,178.40 to correct the balances of PPE accounts. 

. 

4. Procurement of high-end expensive models/brands of electronic gadgets amounting 
to P446,637.76 were unjustified thus, were considered unnecessary expenditures as 

defined in Item 4 of COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012. 

(Paragraph no. 7) 

 

We recommended and Management instruct the concerned officials to submit the 

purchase request for the procured items citing therein the purpose of procuring high-

end gadgets.  as indicated in the above table for the evaluation of the Audit Team. 

 

 

5. In NCMF-CO and in nine  ROs  of NCMF Cash advances (CAs) totaling 
P117,18,562.93 remained unliquidated as at year end due to failure of the 

Accountable Officers to immediately render Liquidation Report (LR) ; and failure of 

the designated Acting Chief Accountant of NCMF-CO and Regional Accountants to 



viii 
 

ensure the proper granting and timely liquidation of CAs as required under Section 

89 PD No. 1445 and COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997, resulting in 

the  accumulation of unliquidated CAs in those Offices. (Paragraph No. 8) 

 

We recommended and Management agreed that:  

 

a. Strengthen its control in the granting, utilization and liquidation of CAs by 

requiring the Accountant to maintain an updated subsidiary/general ledger of 

CAs granted. Institute measures to ensure liquidation of CAs are in accordance 

with the provisions of COA Circular No. 97-002; and 

 

b. Direct the Acting Chief Accountant of NCMF-CO and all Regional Accountants 

to issue demand letters to accountable officers with long outstanding balances. 

Failure to liquidate the said CAs shall be a valid ground for the withholding of 

his/her salary and imposition of other sanctions, if warranted. 

 

6. In NCMF CO and NCMF SLO, Region IVA & B, the Accountant failed to 
automatically revert to the Accumulated Surplus or Deficit the undocumented 

dormant Accounts Payable and Other Payables balances in the Financial Statements 

amounting to P225,242.44 and P12,354,211.65 respectively, contrary to Section 98 

of PD No. 1445 and Section 2 of the Executive Order (EO) No. 87. (Paragraph No. 

10) 

 

We recommended that the Management of NCMF-CO and NCMF SLO RO-IVA & 

B instruct the Acting Chief Accountant and Regional Accountant to prepare an 

inventory of Other Payables incurred in FY 2017 and years prior thereto, as of 

December 31, 2020 and automatically revert to Accumulated Surplus or Deficit the 

undocumented and dormant Other Payable amounting to P12,354,211.65 and 

P225,242.44 respectively, in accordance with Section 2 of EO No. 87. 

 

7. In NCMF-CO, taxes from Mid-Year and Year-end Bonuses for CY 2019 amounting 
to P2,015,163.59 were not deducted and unremitted in spite of the Memorandum 

issued by the Administrative Director to all concerned officials and employees, in 

violation of Section 9 (e) of Republic Act (RA) No. 10963-Tax Reform Acceleration 

and Inclusion (TRAIN) Law which resulted in overpayment of benefits, while 

depriving the government of the needed revenues. Further, the deficiency exposes 

the Accountant for possible penalties and interest for non-withholding of taxes as 

provided for in the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC). (Paragraph No. 11) 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a) require the Acting Chief Accountant to set-up the receivable and payable 
accounts for the non-deduction of the withholding tax of P2,015,163.59 by 

debiting the Due from Officers and Employees account and crediting the Due to 

BIR account by the same amount; 

 



ix 
 

b) require the officials and employees to refund the overpayment of Mid-Year and 
Year End Bonus totaling P2,015,163.59 by issuing a Memorandum as to one-

time payment of concerned employees; and 
 

c) remit the tax on bonuses to the BIR totaling P2,015,163.59 to avoid the exposure 
of the Acting Chief Accountant for possible penalties and interest for 

withholding of taxes as provided for in the NIRC. 

 

8. Out of the total disbursements of USD7,811,238.00 (P397,029,461.07) for the 
housing accommodations of pilgrims for Hajj season, initial audit of 30 percent 

thereof amounting to USD1.0 Million (P51.40 Million) disclosed deficiencies such 

as: a) the amount was paid through cash advances; b) official receipts issued differed 

in physical appearance; c) letter by MAAD to Consul General of the Philippine 

Consulate General (PCG) at Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) dated April 

25, 2019 seeking assistance to collect the SR7,560,000.00 from the NCMF when in 

fact, based on the submitted receipts, NCMF have already paid MAAD a total of 

P51.40 Million on APRIL 16, 2019; and d) no document to show the actual number 

of pilgrims accommodated in the hotel. While the remaining 70 percent or 

USD6,811,238.00 (P345,629,461.072) of the total disbursements transferred to the 

bank account of MAAD could not be validated pending submission of the official 

receipts and actual number of pilgrims for the payment received. (Paragraph No. 15) 

 

We recommended that the Chief/SDO of the Hajj Finance Committee to: 

 

a. Submit a certification under oath from the service provided, MAAD on the 
authenticity of the ORs issued as proof of payment received from the NCMF; 

and 

 

b. Submit the guest list from Al Hidaya Towers owned by the Maad Al-Masiyah 
Company, as it is the hotel where the Filipino pilgrims stayed during Hajj 2019 

as stated in the housing contract signed by the Executive Director/President of 

that company. This is to validate the total actual number of Filipino pilgrims 

who stayed in that hotel. 

 

G.   Status of Implementation of Prior Years Audit Recommendations  

 

Of the 16 recommendations embodied in the Consolidated Annual Audit 

Report (CAAR) of CY 2019, five were implemented, and eleven were not 

implemented. Details are presented in the Part III of this report.
