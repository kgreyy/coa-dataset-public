	EXECUTIVE SUMMARY





A)	Introduction



The Senate Electoral Tribunal (SET) is the agency vested under Section 17, Article VI of the 1987 Constitution with the power to be the sole judge of all contests relating to the election, returns and qualifications of members of the Senate of the Philippines.  It is composed of nine members, three of whom are justices of the Supreme Court while the remaining six are members of the Senate.  The senior justice in the Tribunal acts as its Chairperson.



The Justice-Members are designated by the Chief Justice, traditionally on the basis of seniority, while the Senator-Members are elected by the members of the Senate on the basis of proportional representation from the political parties represented therein.



For CY 2020, the Tribunal was initially composed of Justice Estela M. Perlas-Bernabe as Chairperson, and the following as members:



 Justice Alfredo Benjamin S. Caguioa

 Justice Alexander G. Gesmundo

 Senator Richard J. Gordon

 Senator Maria Lourdes Nancy S. Binay

 Senator Emmanuel “Manny” D. Pacquiao

 Senator Pia S. Cayetano

 Senator Manuel “Lito” M. Lapid

 Senator Franklin M. Drilon



On July 1, 2020, Justice Jose C. Reyes, Jr. replaced Justice Alexander G. Gesmundo as a Tribunal member when a reorganization occurred at the Supreme Court.  However, upon the retirement of Justice Jose C. Reyes, Jr. on September 18, 2020, Justice Ramon Paul L. Hernando was then designated as his replacement.



On the part of the Senate, Senator Francis N. Pangilinan replaced Senator Franklin M. Drilon as the new Tribunal member effective July 1, 2020.



Thus, at the end of CY 2020, the Tribunal was led by Justice Perlas-Bernabe and the following as members: 



 Justice Alfredo Benjamin S. Caguioa

 Justice Ramon Paul L. Hernando

 Senator Richard J. Gordon

 Senator Maria Lourdes Nancy S. Binay

 Senator Emmanuel “Manny” D. Pacquiao

 Senator Pia S. Cayetano

 Senator Manuel “Lito” M. Lapid

 Senator Francis N. Pangilinan



	As of December 31, 2020, the Tribunal has a manpower complement of 116 consisting of 61 permanent and 50 co-terminus employees; one medical consultant, and four contractual employees (Drivers).  Of the nine Tribunal Members, only four have consultants.

C)	Scope and Objectives of Audit



The audit covered the accounts of operations of the SET for CY 2020.  The Audit was conducted to: a) verify the level of assurance that may be placed on Management’s assertions on the financial statements; b) recommend agency’s improvement opportunities; c) determine the propriety of transactions as well as the extent of compliance with pertinent laws, rules and regulations; and d) determine the extent of implementation of prior year’s audit recommendations.









D)	Audit Methodology



The audit was conducted in accordance with International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAIs) issued by the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI) of which the Commission is a member. Procedures were performed to obtain audit evidence about amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including assessment of the risks of material misstatement/s of the financial statements; whether due to fraud or error.  The audit procedures included internal control review; examination of documents/records/reports; analysis, confirmation and inspection of selected accounts, transactions and projects, as necessary.



E)	Independent Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements



The auditor rendered an unmodified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the Tribunal’s financial statements for CY 2020.



F)	Summary of Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations



Among the audit observations and corresponding recommendations discussed in Part II, the  significant observations are summarized as follows: 



1.	Forty-seven units of various unserviceable Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) totaling P1.010 million still remained undisposed as of December 31, 2020, thus exposing them to further deterioration and diminution of value and deprived the agency of additional income that may be derived from disposal. (Observation No. 3)



We recommended and Management agreed to require the Property Officer to strictly comply with Section 79 of PD 1445 and immediately facilitate the inspection and disposal of the unserviceable PPE to avoid further deterioration and diminution of value.



2.	Fifty-nine units of unserviceable/fully-depreciated Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) with a total acquisition cost of P2.081 million are classified in the agency books as Other Assets and recorded at the Carrying Amount equivalent to 10 percent residual value or at P208,069.07 instead of at Cost less Accumulated Depreciation. (Observation No. 2)



We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief Accountant to reclassify the unserviceable/fully depreciated PPE totaling P2.081 million with related Accumulated Depreciation of P1.873 million to its respective PPE accounts and to record the same using acquisition cost instead of carrying amount, in compliance with Sections 40 and 22, Chapter 10 of the GAM, Vol. I, respectively.



3.	The Accounts Payable account balance of P5.053 million as of December 31, 2020 included payables amounting to P97,750.44 that have remained outstanding for two years or more but were not reverted to the Accumulated Surplus or Deficit. (Observation No. 1)



We recommended   and Management agreed to require the Chief Accountant to revert the Accounts Payable aged two years or more to Accumulated Surplus or Deficit account in accordance with Executive Order No. 87 dated August 13, 2019.



4.	The whereabouts, conditions and other relevant information relative to the Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) are unknown due to incomplete data as appearing in the “Remarks” portion of the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) as of December 31, 2020. (Observation No. 4)



We recommended and Management agreed to require the PSMS to fill-out the “Remarks” portion of the RPCPPE to comply with the requirement of the Instructions of Appendix 73 of the GAM, Vol. III to inform the reader of the whereabouts, conditions and status of the items/equipment.



5.	Information in the Transparency Seal of the SET posted at their website is incomplete/not updated since 2016, thus not compliant with the government advocacy of enhancing transparency and enforcing accountability in the agency. (Observation No. 5)



We recommended and Management agreed to: a) direct officials/offices concerned responsible for the information/reports required to be posted in the Transparency Seal to submit the same to the Information and Communication Systems and Judicial Records Management Service (ICSJRMS) for posting on the SET’s website; and b) require the ICSJRMS to regularly monitor the compliance of the SET with the Transparency Seal requirements as provided in the General Provision of the GAA for each year.



6.	The assessment of the agency’s performance and effectiveness of its procurement activities could not be made as the Procurement Monitoring Report (PMR) and Agency Procurement Compliance and Performance Indicator (APCPI) were not prepared and submitted to the Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB) as baseline standards for monitoring and assessment. (Observation No. 6)



We recommended and Management agreed to require the SET-BAC to prepare the PMR and the APCPI for approval and submission by the HoPE to the GPPB within 14 CDs after the end of each semester and within the first quarter of the ensuing year, respectively, and furnish the COA Audit Team with a printed copy thereof, to conform with Section 12.2 of the 2016 Revised IRR of RA No. 9184 or the Government Procurement Reform Act and GPPB Resolution No. 39-2017.



Other equally significant audit observations and recommendations were also noted and discussed in detail under Part II of this report.



	The above findings and recommendations contained in the report were discussed through phone calls made with concerned officials of the agency as meetings cannot be held due to the lockdown of SET.  Management’s views and comments were considered in the report, where appropriate.



G)	Status of Audit Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges



The SET has no audit suspensions, disallowances and charges as of December 31, 2020.



H)	Status of Implementation of Prior Year’s Audit Recommendations



Of the two prior year’s audit recommendations contained in the CY 2019 Annual Audit Report, one was fully implemented and the other one was not implemented.
