PART II - OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

 

FINANCIAL AUDIT 

 

A. Accounting errors/omissions 
 

1. Various accounts of the National Nutrition Council (NNC) have misstatements 
resulting in aggregate errors on the reported total Assets, Liabilities and Net 

Assets/Equity by ₱2.684 million, ₱0.025 million and ₱2.659 million which represent 

0.28 percent, 0.03 percent and 0.30 percent of its total Assets, Liabilities and Net 

Assets/Equity, respectively. Due to the significant impact of such misstatements and 

deficiencies on the reported balances of the affected accounts, Management’s 

assertions as to the accuracy, existence, classification, rights and obligations, and 

valuation of the said accounts could not be relied upon. 

 

Paragraph 15 of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) 1 

and Section 3, Chapter 19, of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume I, states 

that “Financial statements are a structured representation of the financial position and 

financial performance of an entity. The objectives of general-purpose financial statements 

are to provide information about the financial position, financial performance and cash 

flows of an entity that is useful to a wide range of users in making and evaluating decisions 

about the allocation of resources.” The standards further states that specifically, the 

objectives of the general-purpose financial reporting in the public sector should be to 

provide information useful for decision making, and to demonstrate the accountability of 

the entity for the resources entrusted to it. 

 

2. Section 15, Chapter 1 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume I, 
requires that the “FSs shall present fairly the financial position, financial performance and 

cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects 

of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with the definitions and 

recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in International 

Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS). “ 

 

3. Management requires information to make effective decisions. However, 
information alone is not enough; it must be the right information, in an understandable 

format, which is timely enough to be useful.  The prompt recording and proper 

classification of transactions and events are preconditions for reliable and relevant 

information. 

 

4. The GAM provides the accounting standards, policies and guidelines in accounting 
for government funds and property and the list of accounts for use of national government 

agencies as well as the description for each account. 

 

5. Our audit revealed several accounting errors/omissions resulting in misstatements 
of the account balances reported in the NNC’s consolidated financial statements, as 

summarized in Table 1.

7. The above misstatements which were not adjusted in the books of accounts as at 
December 31, 2020, are discussed in the following paragraphs:  

 

Inaccurate/unreliable account’s balance 

 

8. The reported balance of the CIB-LCCA account amounting to ₱525.505 
million as at December 31, 2020 is inaccurate and unreliable due to unrecorded prior 

years’ and current year’s  liquidations/disbursements of majority of the NNC 

regional offices which resulted in the significant difference between balance per books 

and balance per bank confirmation/statements amounting to P504.820 million, 

contrary to the provisions of Section 74 of Presidential Decree (PD) 1445 and Sections 

4 to 7, Chapter 21 of  the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National 

Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I. 

 

9. Paragraph 27 of IPSAS 1 states: “Financial statements shall present fairly the 
financial position, financial performance and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation 

requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and 

conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, 

revenue, and expenses set out in IPSASs. The application of IPSASs, with additional 

disclosures, when necessary, is presumed to result in financial statements that achieve a 

fair presentation.” 

 

10. The reported balance of Cash-in-Bank, Local Currency, Current (LCCA) account 
of NNC in the financial statements as at December 31, 2020 totaled ₱525,504,940.89, 

showed an increase of ₱8,144,101.96 when compared to the CY 2019   bank   balance of   

₱517,360,838.93. Analysis of the account and confirmation of bank depository accounts 

of the NNC - Central Office and its Regional Offices (ROs) revealed that the reported year-

end balance of the subject account is inaccurate and unreliable due to the significant 

difference of P504,820,365.86 between the balance per books and balance per Bank 

Confirmation Letters (BCLs)/Bank Statements (BSs) provided to the Audit Team (AT) by 



46 

the COA Auditors assigned at the NNC-Regional Offices, primarily caused by the 

unrecorded prior years’ and current year’s liquidations/disbursements. 

 

11. Unfortunately, of the 18 BCLs sent, except for the RO-BARMM which the AT 
failed to send a confirmation request to, only 10 replies were received. Hence, comparison 

between the reported CIB-LCCA account balance of ₱525,504,940.89 as at December 31, 

2020 with the total accumulated bank balance of ₱20,684,574.90 from the 10 BCLs/BS 

received, the latest was December 31, 2020 from ROs I, II, III, V and VI,  showed a 

significant difference of ₱504,820,365.99, the details of which were presented in Table 3:

Unreconciled forwarded balances in 
prior years with no specific data 

(287,673.93)  (287,673.93)  

Total ₱ 525,504,940.89 ₱ 20,684,574.90 ₱ 504,820,365.99  

 

12. It can be gleaned from Table 3 that there was a significant difference between the 
balance per GL and the actual balance per BCLs/ BSs of the NNC-CO and the RFOs, just 

like in the prior years’ audit observations.  For CY 2020, the discrepancy of 

₱504,820,365.99 is in great magnitude as compared with last year’s variance of 

₱427,945,881.52 which can be attributed to the unrecorded transactions that can be 
detected by preparing the BRS regularly.  

 

13. Moreover, the unrecorded fund transfer to NNC RO VI on May 2020 amounting to 
₱217,136.00 and disbursements of ₱253,098.94 from January to November 2020 in the 

Cash Register Book (CRB) of the Nutrition Program Coordinator (NPC) of the said region 

further resulted in the inaccurate information on the monitoring of the receipt and 

utilization of funds, as at November 2020, by the Accountant. 
 

14. The AT of the same region also noted the late liquidation of fund transfers intended 
for the operational and project expenses amounting to ₱614,717.90 as at December 31, 

2020, which have resulted in the delayed/non-recording of expenses and deductions from 

Cash-in-Bank accounts as at year-end. 

 

15.  During the interview, the reason of the Chief of Financial Management Division 
was always the unrecorded disbursements/liquidations in the ROs books, particularly those 

pertaining to prior years, when these reports were already submitted by the NPCs in the 

NNC-Central Office a long time ago. Although the Accountant also tried her best effort to 

record the prior year’s liquidation reports to decrease the discrepancy, the effort exerted is, 

however, not enough since instead of a reduction of the variance noted in CY 2019, the 

discrepancy even increased considerably due to the limited staff in the Central Office 

handling/in-charge of the preparation of the Summary of Expenses, which are the vital 

documents/basis of the Accountant in the recording of transactions in the books of 

accounts, particularly during the year because of the COVID-19 pandemic.  

 

16. The AT further noted in Table 2 the existence of unreconciled amount in the ledger 
balance amounting to ₱287,673.93 which the Accountant avowed to verify its nature and 

identities in the previous years’ records for appropriate adjustments in the books in the 

succeeding year. 



48 

 

17. The non-recording of current and prior years’ liquidations/disbursements by the 
Accountant precluded the AT from the timely verification of the account’s balance and 

pertinent transactions, while the noted discrepancy tends to increase every year, although 

the actual amount of increase could not be accounted in CY 2020 due to the non-receipt of 

responses from the eight (8) bank confirmation requests. Thus, rendering the correctness 

and accuracy of the reported CIB-LCCA account balance presented in the Statement of 

Financial Position, unreliable/inaccurate as at December 31, 2020. 

   

18. We recommended and Management agreed to require/direct:  
 

a. The Accountants of the NNC-Central Office (NNC-CO), and the NPCs in the 
ROs to: (i) collaborate/coordinate with each other for the immediate 

submission of the BSs not yet forwarded to the Accounting Unit for the 

reconciliation of the balances with the recorded fund transfers and the 

corresponding withdrawals/ disbursements in the books of NNC-Central 

Office and the cashbooks of the NPCs to decrease the discrepancy noted in the 

ledger books with the BSs;  and (ii) facilitate the verification of the submitted 

BS with the BCLs of the NNC-ROs and forward the same to the Audit Team 

within 20 days after receipt of the BS, as required in Sections 4 to 7, Chapter 

21 of the GAM, Volume I; and 

 

b. Accountants to exert utmost effort to validate/verify in the agency’s previous 
records the details, nature and identities of the forwarded unreconciled 

beginning balance from prior years as well as the supporting documents 

pertaining thereto. 

 

Non-reversal of stale checks 

 
19. Stale checks amounting to ₱25,155.94 of NNC Region XII has been included 
as outstanding checks as at August 31, 2020 for more than five (5) years, contrary to 

Section 44, Chapter 6 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume I, thus, 

resulting in the understatement of cash and liability account by the same amount. 

 

20. Sec. 44. Accounting for Cancelled Checks. Checks may be cancelled when they 
become stale, voided or spoiled. The depository bank considers a check stale, if it has been 

outstanding for over six months from date of issue or as prescribed. A stale, voided or 

spoiled check shall be marked cancelled on its face and reported as follows: 

 

a. Voided, spoiled or unclaimed stale checks with the Cashier shall be reported 
as cancelled in the List of Unreleased Checks that will be attached to the RCI. 

 

b. New checks may be issued for the replacement of stale/spoiled checks in the 
hands of the payees or holders in due course, upon submission of the 

stale/spoiled checks to the Accounting Division/Unit. A certified copy of the 

previously paid DVs shall be attached to the request for replacement. A JEV 



49 

shall be prepared to take up the cancellation. The replacement check shall be 

reported in the RCI. 

 

21. Upon verification of the BRS of NNC Region XII as at August 31, 2020 (the latest 
submitted to the NNC-RO XII Audit Team during the conduct of audit), the following 

checks have become stale and were included as outstanding checks:

TOTAL 25,155.94 

 

22. The above checks remained not negotiated for more than five (5) years and has not 
been cancelled and adjusted in the books accordingly. 

 

23. The non-cancellation of the checks resulted in the understatement of Cash in Bank 
and Payable accounts by ₱25,155.94, thus, rendering the cash balance inaccurate.  

 

24. Management commented that letters were already sent to the concerned payees 
requiring them to state the reason for their non-encashment of the checks. 

 

25. We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 

a. require the payee to return the check and should be marked as cancelled on 
its face and replaced accordingly to be reported in the RCI; 

 

b. ensure that outstanding checks reflected in the schedule have not been staled 
for more than six (6) months by continuously verifying and checking the bank 

statement; and 

  

c. send written notice, if possible, to the payees one month before the check 
becomes stale.

Non-recording of issuance of inventory 

 

26. Unrecorded issuances of Information, Education, and Communication (IEC) 
materials amounting ₱1.898 million and office supplies amounting ₱0.146 million 

overstated the Other Supplies and Materials for Distribution and Office Supplies 

accounts and understated the Other Supplies and Materials for Distribution Expense 

and Office Supplies Expense accounts. 

 

27. Paragraph (g) Section 17, Chapter 8 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I state that: 
“the Report of Supplies and Materials Issued and Requisition (RSMI) shall be prepared by 

the Property and/or Supply Custodian based on the Requisition and Issue Slips (RIS) and 

shall be used by the Accounting Division/Unit as basis in preparing the JEV to record the 

supplies and materials issued.” 

 

28. Audit of RSMI and RIS submitted by the Administration Division revealed that 
during CY 2020, the Property/Supply Officer issued office supplies and IEC materials to 

six divisions of the agency totaling to ₱2,043,781.39, the details of which were shown in

Subtotal 1,897,985.16 

Total ₱ 2,043,781.39 

 
29. While the Accountant noted in the Notes to Financial Statements that no RSMIs 
were submitted to the Office of the Chief Accountant for the office supplies issued during 



51 

the year by the Administration Division (AD), the Property/Supply Officer insisted during 

the interview that they already submitted copies of the RSMI and RIS to Finance 

Management Division (FMD). Further verification in the receiving logbook maintained in 

the AD revealed that the Office of the Chief, FMD indeed received the copies of the subject 

reports but unfortunately these were not forwarded to nor received by the Accountant. 

 

30. The non-recognition of issued office supplies in the agency books overstated the 
balance of the Office Supplies account by ₱145,796.23 while equally understating the 

Office Supplies Expense account balance by the same amount.  On the other hand, the 

unrecorded issuance of IEC materials overstated the Other Supplies and Materials for 

Distribution account by ₱1,897,985.16 while understating the balance of the Other 

Supplies and Materials for Distribution Expense account by the same amount. 

 
31. We recommended that Management require/direct:  
 

a. The Chief, Financial Management Division (FMD) to submit/provide to the 
Accountant all copies of RSMIs and RISs received by their office in CY 2020 

for the appropriate recording of transactions in the books; 

 

b. The Chief, FMD to officially instruct the Property/Supply Officer to submit  
all pertinent supporting documents of the succeeding issuances of office 

supplies inventory, directly to the Office of the Chief Accountant, at least on a 

monthly basis, to avoid similar incident/deficiency in the ensuing year; and 

 

c. The Accountant to prepare the JEV, upon receipt of the RSMIs and RISs from 
the Office of the Chief, FMD and record in the books the issuances of IECs 

and office supplies to effect the necessary adjustments in the accounts Office 

Supplies Inventory, Other Supplies and Materials Inventory-for Distribution and 

Government Equity, immediately in CY 2021, copy furnished the Audit Team 

for audit purposes. 

 
B. Accounting Deficiencies 
 

32. Various accounting deficiencies totaling ₱625.344 million were noted in 
recording and reporting financial transactions which affected the fair presentation of 

the total Assets, Liabilities and Net Assets/Equity in the NNC’s FS for CY 2020. 

 

CASH 

 

Non-submission of Cash in Bank Register and supporting documents 

 

33. Non-submission by NNC Region XI of the Cash in Bank Register (CBReg) 
together with the disbursement vouchers and other required supporting documents 

on the utilization of funds received from NNC-Central Office amounting to P1.215 

million, hindering timely review of transactions and recommending corrective 



52 

measures for deficiencies found in audit and in violation of Section 11, Chapter 6 of 

the GAM, Volume I. 

 

34. Section 11, Chapter 6 of GAM Volume 1, states: 
 

“Recording of Check Disbursements by Field Offices without Complete set of 

Books. 

 

 Field Offices (FOs) without complete set of books shall record chronologically in 

the Cash in Bank Register (Appendix 37 all check issued/charged to deposits with 

the AGBD.  The certified copy of the CBReg together with the required SDs shall 

be submitted within five days after the end of each month to the concerned mother 

unit (central/regional/division office) by the FOs (a unit under the 

central/regional/division office) for review and recording of the transactions in the 

books of accounts.” 

 

35. As instructed by NNC Central Office, all financial transactions and reports of the 
regional/field offices shall be submitted to their respective COA Regional Auditors for 

audit. Likewise, the stamped received transmittal letter together with the copy of the 

CBReg shall be forwarded to the NNC Central Office within five days after the end of each 

month for recording in the books.  NNC XI opted to prepare the CBReg per program/fund 

transfer. 

 

36. During the year, NNC Central Office downloaded funds to NNC XI to its current 
account maintained at the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP), San Fernando (Davao) 

Branch amounting to ₱1,625,823.00 to fund various programs and activities including its 

operational expenses during the year. 

 

37. Of the total funds received during the year by NNC RO XI, CBReg with the DVs 
and supporting documents submitted to COA Office were only for the ₱410,482.00 or 25 

percent of the total funding received. The remaining ₱1,215,341.00 or 75 percent remained 

unsubmitted.  Details are shown in Table 6.

38. The accounting personnel in-charge informed the AT that they are still in the 
process of completing the supporting documents required for some transactions, still to be 

attached to the DVs.  The inability to submit the DVs to the NNC, Central Office after the 

transactions were paid and recorded in the CBReg, only proved the practice of 

Management of approving payments without complete documentation, hence manifesting 

poor internal control on disbursements and caused the delay in the submission of financial 

reports. 

 

39. Further, these expenses were not recorded in the books during the CY 2020, thus, 
affecting the fair presentation of the financial statements of the agency. 

 

40. We recommended and Management agreed to submit immediately the CB Reg 
with the disbursement vouchers including the complete supporting documents for the 

P1,215,341.00 funding received from Central Office, and henceforth, submit all 

succeeding CBReg on time as required under Section 11, Chapter 6 of the GAM, 

Volume I.

Unavailability of General/Subsidiary Ledgers  

 

41. The balance of Cash in Bank account amounting to P602,083.02 as at 
November 18, 2020 of  NNC-Regional Office (RO) XII per CBReg remained 

unreconciled with the NNC-Central Office (CO) books of accounts  due to the failure 

of concerned officials to secure copies of the General/Subsidiary Ledger (GL/SL)from 

the Accounting Unit, NNC-CO and the non-reconciliation of accounting records 

between NNC-CO and the pertinent RO, contrary to Section 5 of the GAM, Volume 

I, thus, casting doubt on the balances appearing in the Bank Reconciliation 

Statements (BRS).  

 

42. Sec. 5. Preparation of the Bank Reconciliation Statement (BRS). The Chief 
Accountant/Designated Staff shall within ten days from receipt of the monthly Bank 

Statement (BS) together with the paid checks, original copies of Debit Memoranda 

(DM)/Credit Memoranda (CM) from the GSB, reconcile the BS with the GL and prepare 

the BRS in four copies.  

 

43. It was observed during the audit of NNC-RO XII AT that the assigned personnel in 
the said regional office prepared the BRS without securing copies of the General/ 

Subsidiary Ledgers from the Accounting Unit, NNC-CO to establish the actual ending 

balance for the month per agency books since the recording of transactions is centralized 

in the CO and the regional offices don’t have the complete set of books.  

 

44. Further, no reconciliation of accounting records between NNC-CO and the RO was 
done. The AT requested the NNC CO to provide a copy of the General/Subsidiary Ledger 

from the Accountant but as at December 7, 2020 the NNC RO XII AT has not provided 

the requested records, thus, the Cash in Bank per audit amounting to P602,083.02 remained 

unreconciled. 

 

45. Due to the failure of the concerned staff to secure a copy of the GL/SL from the 
Accountant, NNC-CO and the reconciliation of the RO’s records with those of the CO, the 

balance of the Cash-In-Bank account in the CBReg of the RO amounting to P602,083.02 

remained unreconciled with the balance appearing in the GL/SL of NNC-CO of 

P26,717,605.65 (Table 3), the difference of P26,115,522.63 between the balances of the 

two records is material and significant, thus casting doubt on the amounts presented in the 

BRS. 

 

46. Management commented that they had already sent a Memorandum request on 
December 6, 2020 to NNC-CO to provide copy of General/Subsidiary Ledgers requested 

by the AT to support the conduct of cash examination held last November 18, 2020.  NNC-

CO responded and provided only the copies of GL/SL as at May 31, 2020. 

 

 

 

 



55 

47. We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 

a. request the NNC-CO to provide the RO XII complete copies of the 
General/Subsidiary Ledger, at least as at December 31, 2020 and the 

months thereafter, for reconciliation of the balances shown in the GL/SL 

of the NNC-CO with the CBReg maintained by the pertinent RO; and 

 

b. reconcile the Accounting records between NNC-CO and the RO 
regularly, at least on a monthly basis. 

 

 

RECEIVABLES 

 
Unliquidated Dormant Balance of Due from NGAs 
 

48. The long-outstanding balance of the Due from National Government Agencies 
account amounting to P32.724 million as at December 31, 2020 for more than 10 years 

became dormant due to inadequate monitoring/follow-up/coordination with the 

concerned national government agencies to enforce the submission of liquidation 

reports for the funds transferred contrary to provisions of COA Circular No. 94-013 

and COA Circular  No. 2016-005,  thus, affecting the fair presentation of the accounts 

in the Financial Statements as at year-end. 
 

49.  COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994 provides the rules and 
regulations in the grant, utilization and liquidation of funds transferred to Implementing 

Agencies (IAs). Section 4.4.6 of said Circular states that, “Within ten (10) days after the 

end of each month/end of the agreed period for the Project, the IA shall submit the Report 

of Checks Issued (RCI) and the Report of Disbursement (RD) to report the utilization of 

the funds.  Only actual project expenses shall be reported.  The reports shall be approved 

by the Head of the IA.” 
 

50. On the other hand, COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016 
prescribes the guidelines and procedures on the write-off of dormant accounts including 

fund transfers of NGAs. It defines dormant unliquidated fund transfers as “advances 

granted by the source entity to the implementing entity for the implementation of 

programs/project which remained non-moving for 10 years or more and where settlement 

could no longer be ascertained.” 
 

51. The NNC CO transferred funds to various NGAs for the implementation of various 
nutrition and hunger programs to improve the nutrition habit of the Filipino people and to 

lessen hunger and malnutrition. The fund was recorded in the account Due from NGAs. 
 

52. For CY 2020, the reported aggregate balance of the Due from NGAs accounts 
totaled  P47,802,137.84 as at year-end. Review of the Aging Schedule of the account 

balance showed unliquidated fund transfers aged from less than a year amounting to 

P4,025,868.60 to more than 10 years totaling P32,724,395.19, as summarized/presented in 

Table 7 below.

53. As presented in Table 7, the P47,802,137.84 year-end balance still included the 
long outstanding balance of P32,724,395.19, which is over ten (10) years now and 

considered dormant in last year’s audit report. However, the Accountant failed to 

implement the prior year’s audit recommendations in CY 2020 and apparently, no action 

was taken to enforce the submission of liquidation documents from the concerned NGAs 

since the balance remained non-moving during the year.  
 

54.  When asked, the Accountant cited incomplete records and the considerable number 
of years the transactions occurred/transpired and maintained in the agency’s books of 

accounts as her constraints in the conduct of analysis and verification of the dormant/non-

moving accounts. She even averred that the validation seemed nil and encountered 

difficulties due to the absence of source documents. The Chief, Financial Management 

Division also informed the AT that they were unable to verify the existence of accounts in 

the concerned NGAs through confirmation letters due to the current situation brought about 

by the COVID-19 pandemic. But the Accountant informed the AT that they planned to 

reconcile the NNC records with the pertinent NGAs books in CY 2021.  If the effort will 

not be feasible due to the COVID-19 outbreak, concerned officials of NNC will consider 

to request for write-off of the total dormant account balance. Please see Table 8 for the 

details of the dormant account balances.

 Total P32,724,395.19   

 

55. As detailed in Table 8 above, the unliquidated fund transfers to NGAs dates even 
way back in 1985 and the majority of which were transferred in the 1990s, hence, already 

dormant/non-moving for more than 10 years now. Considering the length of time that has 

passed, the liquidation of the subject receivable accounts seemed remote due to the 

continuous failure of concerned NNC officials to strictly monitor and enforce its 

liquidation through the period it was granted to the concerned NGAs.  

 

56. The continuous non-action of concerned Management officials to enforce the 
liquidation of the funds transferred in prior years and even for the current year, tend to 

increase the unliquidated balance to a much higher amount, particularly the dormant 

receivables since the  unliquidated ones will also mature in the succeeding years, thus, 

affecting the reliability of the amounts presented in the Financial Statements, unless 

Management will comply with the pertinent provisions of COA Circular No. 2016-005 on 

the request for write-off on the outstanding balances  but duly supported by valid 

documents, particularly those already outstanding for over 10 years. 

 

57. We recommended and Management agreed to require/direct the Accountant 
and the Chief, Finance Division to: 

 

a. collaborate and pursue the plan of reconciliation of the NNC records with the 
concerned NGAs for all the transferred funds, even for those only less than a 

year, by sending confirmation letters immediately in the ensuing year, for the 

immediate submission of liquidation reports. If efforts exerted will again fail, 

pay personal visits to the concerned NGAs (give priority to Fabella hospital, 

PIA, NDA, FNRI-DOST, ATI and the Procurement Service) to prevent the 

increase/accumulation of dormant balances, pursuant to the provisions of the 

Memorandum of Agreement and COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 

13, 1994; and 

 



58 

b. consider to request for write-off of the dormant balances aged 10 years or 
older, particularly those with small amounts way back in 1985 and the 1990s 

and those in far places, if confirmation and personal visits seem remote due to 

the continuous COVID-19 outbreak and geographical locations, following the 

guidelines prescribed under COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 29, 

2016 and duly supported with valid documents. 

 

58. Management commented, through the FMD, to take further actions/remedies for 
the possible settlement of the balance by sending again this year of collection and follow-

up letters to the concerned agencies. Moreover, coordination meetings with concerned 

NGAs will be made to determine whether the project had already been 

implemented/completed and require these agencies to submit liquidation reports and/or 

refund the unexpended balance, pursuant to the above-cited COA Circulars. 

 

Unreconciled Ledger Balances 

 

59. The existence of unreconciled/unknown balance between the General Ledger 
and Subsidiary Ledger of the Due from NGAs and Due from LGUs account amounting 

to P8.119 million rendered the balances presented in the Financial Statements 

unreliable and doubtful. 

 

60. In addition to Paragraph 27 of IPSAS 1, Section 5.5.3 of COA Circular No. 94-013 
dated December 13, 1994 states that “the SA shall maintain a subsidiary ledger of the cash 

transferred pertaining to the project”. Further, Section 5.5.4 of the same Circular states 

that “the SA shall require the IA to submit the reports and furnish the IA with a copy of the 

journal voucher taking up the expenditures...” 

 

61. Comparison between the General Ledger (GL) and the Subsidiary Ledger (SL) of 
the Due from NGAs and Due from LGUs account balances showed discrepancies totaling 

P6,404,280.31 and P1,715,105.97, respectively, as shown in Table 9. 
 

Table 9. Comparison of GL and SL balance 

Account Balance per GL Balance per SL Variance 

Due from NGAs 47,802,137.84 41,397,857.50 6,404,280.34

Total  344,819,906.84 336,700,520.53 8,119,386.31 
 

62. The noted variances can be attributed to the Agency’s lack of regular reconciliation 
of records between the SL and GL maintained by the Accountant as well as the NNC 

records with the concerned Implementing Agencies (IAs). Moreover, these balances were 

already noted by the AT in CY 2016 when the current Accountant, newly hired then, 

painstakingly updated the SL of the Agency on that year. The discrepancy was mentioned 

in the audit report in CY 2016 and in the succeeding audit years’ since then, but apparently 

no action was taken by concerned management officials, particularly the Accountant and 

the Chief, FMD, since the two books remained unreconciled, as at year-end. 
 



59 

63. The non-action of concerned Management officials to implement the prior years’ 
audit recommendation and non-reconciliation of the balance between NNC and the IAs 

records which contributed to the unreconciled balance in the Agency books, greatly 

affected the accuracy and reliability of the accounts’ year-end balances in the financial 

statements. 
 

64. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant and the 
Chief, FMD to:  

 

a. coordinate/collaborate with the Accountants of the concerned IAs for the 
immediate reconciliation of the NNC books with the IAs books particularly 

those balances with less than 10 years of age in the succeeding years to 

facilitate the determination of the source of the unreconciled balance between 

the SL and the GL books of accounts; and  

 

b. judiciously work on the reconciliation of the unreconciled balances between 
the SL and GL immediately in the ensuing year to determine not only the 

source but also the causes of the discrepancy.  Prepare the Journal Entry 

Voucher (JEV) and effect immediately the necessary adjustments in the books 

of accounts, after the reconciliation efforts between the SL and GL balances.  

 
65. Management commented that the reconciliation of the unreconciled balance 
between General Ledger and Subsidiary Ledgers amounting to ₱8.119 million will remain 

a priority concern of the Financial and Management Division (FMD). Management also 

explained that thorough review of all transactions posted to the accounts were conducted 

to establish the nature of the discrepancies and to effect the necessary corrections and 

adjustments in the books, in order to reduce if not eliminate the subject unreconciled 

difference. However, FMD cannot complete the reconciliation process because of lack 

and/or incomplete documentation. The General Ledger pertaining to the year of noted 

discrepancies were not accurately and completely supported by detailed records and the 

Subsidiary Ledgers could no longer be located. Schedules of accounts that were available 

and provided to the current Accountant contained beginning balances where details have 

yet to be backtracked. Apparently, subsidiary ledgers were not properly maintained and 

were already incomplete even before the assumption to duty in 2003 as Accountant of the 

present Chief of the FMD. Every year, the FMD Accounting Section is trying its best 

efforts to analyze and reconcile the said differences/discrepancies in various accounts. 

Undeniably, the recurring problems encountered by the Accountant were similar to the 

previous years where there were no available records, documents, and papers to refer to 

and as bases in terms of preparation of adjustments in records. 
 

66. Management commented that despite of the foregoing limitations, and in the 
exercise of due diligence, FMD has continuously been searching and looking for electronic 

records/documents/papers to be retrieved that will substantiate and support the subject 

receivable account.

INVENTORIES 

 

Failure to conduct physical count of inventories 

 

67. The reliability, accuracy and existence of the reported balances of the 
Inventories accounts totaling to P60.835 million could not be ascertained due to the 

failure to conduct physical count of inventories as required in Section 13, Chapter 8  

of Government Accounting Manual (GAM) because of lack of manpower and conflict 

in the alternative work arrangement during the COVID-19 pandemic and therefore 

no Report of Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) was prepared/submitted as well 

as no reconciliation of its result with the Accounting records is being conducted. 
 

68. Section 6 (e), Chapter 19 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for 
National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I provide “the qualitative characteristics 

of financial reporting and one of this is reliability where information is free from material 

error and bias, and can be depended on by users to represent faithfully that which it 

purports to represent or could reasonably be expected to represent.” 

 

69. The reported aggregate balances of the Inventories account as at December 31, 
2020 totaled P60,835,096.86, the details of which are shown in Table 10.  

 

Table 10. Composition of Inventory account as at December 31, 2020 

Particulars Amount 

Other Supplies and Materials for Distribution P     57,879,793.42 

Office Supplies Inventory 2,836,866.94 

Other Supplies and Materials for Inventory  118,436.50 

TOTAL INVENTORY P  60,835,096.86 

  
70. Section 13, Chapter 8 on Inventories, of the Government Accounting Manual 
(GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I, provides among others, 

that physical count/inventory, which is required semi-annually, is an indispensable 

procedure for checking the integrity of property custodianship.  
 

71. Instructions on the Preparation of Report on the Physical Count of Inventories 
(RPCI) (Appendix 66) of the GAM for NGAs, Volume II provides, among others, that the 

“RPCI is a form used to report the physical count of inventory items by type such as Office 

Supplies Inventory; Accountable Forms Inventory; Medical, Dental and Laboratory 

Supplies Inventory; Food Supplies Inventory, etc. which are owned by the agency/entity. It 

shall be prepared semi-annually by the Inventory Committee and by fund cluster.  It also 

states how the forms shall be accomplished, the need for the reconciliation of the 

Accounting and Property Units, how many copies of the report shall be prepared and to 

whom this shall be distributed and the deadline of submission of the semestral reports to 

COA.” 



61 

 

72. One of the objectives of physical count is to determine whether the assets actually 
exist as at year-end and that they are actually owned by the agency.  

 

73. For Calendar Year (CY) 2020, the Agency was not able to conduct the semestral 
physical count of all unused inventories and submit the RPCI on the prescribed period or 

even beyond due to lack of manpower and conflict in the alternative work arrangement 

adopted among employees and the members of the Inventory Committee during the 

COVID-19 pandemic.  

 

74. Consequently, no reconciliation efforts were exerted between the accounting 
records with the supposed RPCI. Thus, the physical existence and the status of the 

Inventories reported in the financial statements cannot be validated/verified due to the 

failure of the concerned officials and Inventory Committee to conduct the required physical 

inventory taking in CY 2020 and consequently no RPCI was provided to the AT when 

required for its submission.  

 

75. We recommended and Management agreed to require: 
 

a. The Property/Supply Officer together with the Inventory Committee to 
conduct the semi-annual physical count of all unused inventories immediately 

in the ensuing year and submit the RPCI on the prescribed period, complete 

with the required data/information to the AT on or before July 31 and January 

31 of each year for the 1st and 2nd semesters, respectively; and 

 

b. The Accountant and the Chairman of the Inventory Committee to coordinate 
and reconcile the result of the physical count with the Accounting records after 

the conduct of the physical inventory in the 1st semester of CY 2021. Any 

negative result, shall be investigated immediately, if so warranted. 

 

76. Management commented that further verification, analysis, and validation of the 
existence of the account shall also be conducted to determine not only the source but also 

the causes of the noted discrepancy. 

 

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT 

 

Unreliable balances and existence of the Property, Plant and Equipment accounts 

 

77. The validity/accuracy and existence of the Property, Plant and Equipment 
accounts totaling ₱64.260 million as at December 31, 2020 is unreliable/uncertain, due 

to: (a) failure of the inventory Committee to conduct the physical count of all property 

and equipment and consequently, no Report of Physical Count of Property, Plant and 

Equipment (RPCPPE) was prepared and submitted to the COA Office within the 

prescribed period as required in Sections 38 and 42, Chapter 10 of the Government 

Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I; 

(b) unreconciled balances between CY 2020 General Ledger and CY 2019 Report of 



62 

Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE, latest report) with a 

variance of ₱17.629 million, which proved that no reconciliation effort was made 

between the Accounting records and the RPCPPE, pursuant to Section 42 of the 

GAM, Volume I; (c) unserviceable PPEs were still included in the PPE accounts; and 

(d) other PPE accounts amounting to P1.076 included unidentified PPEs valued at 

P.976 million.  

 

78. Section 38, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I provides that: “The entity 
shall have a periodic physical count of PPE, which shall be done annually and presented 

on the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) 

(Appendix 71) as at December 31 of each year. This shall be submitted to the Auditor 

concerned not later than January 31 of the following year. Equipment found at station and 

losses discovered during the physical count shall be reported to the Accounting 

Division/Unit for proper accounting/recording.” 

 

79. Section 42 thereof states: “The Chief Accountant shall maintain the PPELC for 
each category of PPE including work and other animals, livestock etc. The PPELC shall 

be kept to record promptly the acquisition, description, custody, estimated useful life, 

depreciation, impairment loss, disposal and other information about the asset. For check 

and balance, the Property and Supply Office/Unit shall likewise maintain PC for PPE in 

their custody to account for the receipt and disposition of the same. The balance per PC 

shall be reconciled with PPELC maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit. They shall 

also be reconciled with other property records like PAR.” 

 

80. Appendix 70 of the GAM, Volume II states that, “The PPE Ledger Card shall be 
used for each class of PPE to record the acquisition, description, custody, estimated life, 

depreciation, impairment, disposal, transfer/adjustment, repair history and other 

information about the property. It shall be kept and maintained by the Accounting 

Office/Unit.” 

 

81. Appendix 69 of the same Manual states that, “The Property Card shall be used by 
the Supply and/or Property Division/Unit to record the description, acquisition, transfer, 

disposal, and other information about the PPE. It shall be kept for each class of PPE.” 

 

82. Section 42, Chapter 10 of the GAM, Volume I state that “All unserviceable 
property shall be reported in the Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable 

Property (IIRUP) (Appendix 74).  PPE reported in the IIRUP shall be dropped from the 

books by debiting Impairment Loss-Property, Plant and Equipment (cost of the PPE less 

Accumulated Depreciation). 

 

83. Appendix 74 of the GAM, Volume II states that, “The IIRUP is a report prepared 
by the Supply and/or Property Unit as basis to record dropping from the books the 

unserviceable properties carried in the PPE accounts. 

 

84. The RPCPPE is the form used to report on the physical count of PPE by type such 
as: land, land improvements, infrastructure, building and other structures, machinery and 



63 

equipment, transportation equipment, furniture, fixtures and books, etc. which are owned 

by the agency. The absence of the RPCPPE rendered the correctness and accuracy of the 

year-end balances of the PPE accounts unreliable/uncertain because the existence and 

condition/status of PPEs could not be verified/validated.  

 

85. The reported balance of the PPEs in the financial statements as at December 31, 
2020 totaled to P64,259,813.42, which amount is broken down as follows, per type of 

account:

86. Considering that the NNC operates on a highly centralized accounting system with 
17 Regional Offices under its wing, the physical inventory-taking of PPEs must be 

systematically undertaken to account for all properties nationwide. While the physical 

inventory-taking of properties was always conducted nationwide by NNC every year, the 

latest of which was in CY 2019, and submission of the RPCPPE was often beyond the 

prescribed period, the activity was not conducted in CY 2020 because of the COVID-19 

outbreak. Moreover, the entire NCR, several regions and Metro Manila was placed under 

several community quarantines which hindered the Inventory Committee to conduct the 

activity. Consequently, no RPCPPE was prepared and submitted to the COA Office 

supposedly on January 31, 2021. 

  

87. In the absence of the CY 2020 RPCPPE, analysis, review and comparison of 
balances  for the PPE accounts were limited to only the available agency records and the 

CY 2019 RPCPPE, which is the latest report available, with a total value of 

P46,630,806.47, while the aggregate balance reflected in the General Ledger (GL) as at 

CY 2020 totaled P64,259,813.42, thereby, showing a discrepancy of P 17,629,006.95, the 

details of which are shown in Table 12 below, with the GL balance as at CY 2019 presented 

for comparison purposes:

  Difference of GL 
Balances: 2020 & 2019 

 

88. It can be gleaned from Table 12 above that two of the six PPE accounts in the CY 
2020 GL balances showed an increase by P218,190.00 as compared with those in the CY 

2019 GL. This can be attributed to the new acquisitions in CY 2020 that were not yet 

included in the CY 2019 RPCPPE. The noted discrepancy of P17,629,006.95 is considered 

significant for the non-reconciliation on the result of the physical inventory conducted in 

CY 2019 with the accounting records, at least during CY 2020, as required in Section 42 

of the GAM, Volume I, which concerned officials and the Inventory Committee members 

failed to implement due to the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. 

  

89. The difference of P17,629,006.95 was partially attributed to the following: 
 

a. Unserviceable PPEs amounting to P11,182,862.41 still included in the books, 
thus, overstating the PPE accounts and understating the Accumulated 

Impairment Loss accounts due to the failure of the Property Officer to submit 

copies of the Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property 

(IIRUP) to the Accounting Unit for recording in the books of accounts; 

 

b. One (1) unit Motor Vehicle amounting to P1,070,000.00 purchased and 
recorded in the books during CY 2018 but not included in the 2019 RPCPPE;   

 

c. Other PPE account amounting to P1.076 million included unidentified PPEs in 
the amount of P976,055.04 which became dormant/non-moving since 2004; 

and 

 



65 

d. Property items with acquisition costs below the ₱15,000.00 capitalization 
threshold were not reclassified to the appropriate Semi-Expendable Property 

accounts as required under Item 5.4 of COA Circular No. 2016-006, resulting 

in the overstatement of PPE accounts by ₱213,045.12.  

  

90. The Property Officer admitted their failure to conduct in CY 2020 the annual 
physical count of PPEs, at least in the Central Office, but he reasoned that this was due to 

manpower constraints and conflict with the working arrangements/schedules of personnel 

due to the COVID-19 pandemic when the entire NCR and Metro Manila were placed under 

the strict community quarantine.   

 

91. Consequently, due to the failure of the Property Officer and the Accountant to 
reconcile their respective records in CY 2020, i.e., even using at least the CY 2019 

RPCPPE, the latest report prepared and submitted in CY 2020, the year-end balance of the 

PPE accounts remained inaccurate/unreliable despite of the audit recommendations in prior 

years and in last year’s audit report, thus, affecting the correctness of the reported balances 

of the six PPE accounts in the CY 2020 Financial Statements.   

 

92. We recommended and Management agreed to require/direct: 
 

a. The Property Officer, together with the Inventory Committee, to: 
 

i. conduct a complete annual physical inventory of PPE in CY 2021, 
nationwide, at an earlier schedule if the current situation of the 

COVID-19 pandemic already permits; 

 

ii. prepare and submit the RPCPPE report using the prescribed form to 
the Audit Team on or before January 31 of the following year in 

compliance with Section 38, Chapter 10  of the GAM, Volume I; and 

 

iii. coordinate with the Accountant for the immediate reconciliation of the 
result of physical count with the accounting and property records 

before the final preparation of the RPCPPE for CY 2021; 

 

b. The concerned officials of the Accounting Division and Administration 
Division to coordinate with the members of the Inventory Committee and 

continue the on-going reconciliation between the CY 2020 General Ledger 

books with the CY 2019 RPCPPE in order to reduce the difference of 

P17,629,006.95 between the balances per books and per physical count, in 

the ensuing year. Any discrepancy noted between the two records shall be 

immediately verified/investigated and adjusted; 

 

c. The Property Officer to submit immediately to the Accounting Division, 
the copy of IIRUP in the succeeding year for recognition in the books of 

the unserviceable properties and impairment loss, if any; 

 



66 

d. The Accountant to prepare the JEV for dropping from the books the 
unserviceable PPE upon securing a copy of IIRUP from the Property 

Officer and after the validation of the Accounting Staff of the veracity of 

the report, and the recognition of impairment loss, if any, copy furnished 

the COA Office for monitoring purposes; 

 

e. The Inventory Committee to include in the RPCPPE for CY 2020, the 
Motor Vehicle purchased in CY 2018;  

 

f. The Accountant and Property Officer to coordinate and verify/investigate 
the identity of the PPEs recorded in the Other PPE account amounting to 

P976,055.04, particularly the nature and sources, and make 

appropriate/proper adjustments in the books/records in the succeeding 

year; and 
 

g. The Accountant to prepare the JEV for the appropriate reclassification of 
property items with acquisition cost below the ₱15,000.00 capitalization 

threshold totaling P213,045.12, to the Semi-Expendable Property accounts 

as required under Item 5.4 of COA Circular No. 2016-006 and replace the 

Property Accountability Receipt (PAR) previously issued to the 

accountable persons to Inventory Custodian Slips (ICS) for control 

purposes. 

 
93. The Chief of Administrative Division commented during the interview that a 
memorandum will be issued directing the Accountant and the Property Officer to 

coordinate as an inventory/reconciliation team and will have regular meeting/s to work on 

the reconciliation of accounting and property records.  Moreover, a new inventory 

committee will be created for the 2021 annual physical count. 

 

94. In summary, due to the significant impact on the financial statements of the 
total misstatements of ₱2.684 million, ₱0.025 million and ₱2.659 million which 

represent 0.28 percent, 0.03 percent and 0.30 percent of its total assets, liabilities and 

net assets/equity, respectively, and with total deficiencies of ₱625.344 million or 64.52 

percent of its total assets, we rendered a Qualified Opinion on the financial statements 

of the NNC as at year-end. 
 

C. COMPLIANCE AUDIT 
 

Non-preparation/delayed submission of Bank Reconciliation Statements 

 

95. The accuracy and reliability of Cash in Bank - LCCA account cannot be 
ascertained due to non-preparation and delayed submission of Bank Reconciliation 

Statements which is not in accordance with Section 74 of PD 1445. 

 
96. Section 74 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 dated June 11, 1978 states that 
“At the close of each month, depositories shall report to the agency head, in such form as 



67 

he may direct, the condition of the agency account standing on their books. The head of 

the agency shall see to it that reconciliation is made between the balance shown in the 

reports and the balance found in the books of the agency.” 

 

97. Section 1(b), Chapter 21 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for 
National Government Agencies, Volume I, defined Bank Reconciliation Statement (BRS) 

as “settlement of differences contained in the bank statement and the cash account in the 

agency’s/entity’s books of accounts.” 
 

98. Sections 4 to 7 of the same Manual further states that: 
 

“Section 4. Method of Bank Reconciliation. The monthly BRS shall be prepared by 

the Chief Accountant/designated staff for each of the bank accounts maintained by 

the agency/entity using the Adjusted Balance Method. Under this method, the book 

balance and the bank balance are brought to an adjusted cash balance that must 

appear on the Statement of Financial Position.” 
 

“Section 5. Preparation of the Bank Reconciliation Statement. The Chief 

Accountant/Designated Staff shall within ten days from receipt of monthly Bank 

Statement (BS) together with the paid checks, original copies of Debit Memoranda 

(DM)/Credit Memoranda (CM) from the GSB, reconcile the BS with the GL and 

prepare the BRS in four copies.” 
 

“Section 6. Recognition of Adjustments. The Chief Accountant/Designated Staff 

shall prepare a JEV to recognize all reconciling items that require adjustment and 

corrections in the books of accounts.” 
 

“Section 7. Reporting. The Chief Accountant shall submit the BRS within twenty 

days after the receipt of the monthly BS to the following: 
 

Original – COA Auditor (with all the supporting documents and JEVs) 

Copy 2 – Head of the Agency/Entity 

Copy 3 – Accounting Division/Unit file 

Copy 4 – Bank, if necessary 

 

99. Review of the monthly BRS submitted to the Audit Team revealed that the 
Accountant at the NNC-Central Office failed to submit the monthly BRS on time, as shown 

in Table 13.

100. Analysis and review of the reported account’s balance are only limited to the 
verification of recorded transactions in the books of accounts due to the failure of the 

Accountant to prepare and submit the BRS of the Central Office (CO) and the Regional 

Offices (ROs) within the prescribed period. Delays ranging from two (2) months to almost 

three (3) years as at December 2020 have been incurred, as presented in Table 13. 
 

101. Moreover, it can also be gleaned from Table 13 that there are only three NNC ROs 
- I, II and III, that had completed the submission of BRS as at December 31, 2020; while 

for the rest, the latest BRS submitted was for the month of October 2020, i.e., for RO-NCR. 

We also noted that, as in previous years, the latest BRS submitted by RO-BARMM is still 

for the CY 2015 despite our audit reminder in last year’s audit report. 
 

102. The Chief of Financial Management Division explained that the reasons for the 
delay and/or non-preparation of BRS was the heavy work load of the Accountant and when 

the entire country was placed under the strict Community Quarantines due to the COVID-

19 outbreak in March to June 2020.  
 

103. The Accountant also confirmed the non-preparation of the BRS and submission to 
the Audit Team (AT) by the RO-BARMM since CY 2015 because majority of the records 

of the RO was burned in CY 2012 due to faulty electrical wiring as noted in the prior year’s 

audit observation. Moreover, the assigned staff in the NNC-CO still encountered 

difficulties in establishing the beginning balance and the reconciling items in previous 

years. 
 

104. While we consider the reason of the Accountant regarding the records of RO-
BARMM having been burned in CY 2012, this cannot be used every year from then on as 

an alibi not to prepare the BRS of the said RO. It has already been eight (8) years and still

no BRS has been prepared even for the current year and even if only just to establish the 

actual receipts and disbursements of the RO for a given year. We maintain our stand for 

the Accountant to prepare the BRS of the RO-BARMM in CY 2020 and the years 

thereafter. Reconcile the transactions recorded in the CBReg of the RO with the GL/SL of 

the NNC-CO even as a starting point and utilize the transactions in CY 2019 and CY 2020 

and compare the entries made in the two books with the recorded transactions in the Bank 

Statements for CY 2019 and CY 2020 and from then on prepare the BRS. Coordinate also 

with the depository bank of the RO-BARMM for previous years’ copies of the BS as a tool 

in the reconciliation process, if it is still possible.  

 
105. We recommended and Management agreed to require/direct: 

 
a. The Accountants and the NPCs in the ROs to: 
 

i. coordinate with the depository bank for the immediate submission of 
the Bank Statements (BS) and to gather the necessary supporting 

documents; and 

 

ii. collaborate for the reconciliation of the balances appearing in the BS 
with the record of Fund Transfers and the corresponding 

withdrawals/disbursement in the books; and 

 

b. The Accountant to: 
 

i. facilitate the verification of the submitted BRS of NNC ROs and 
forward to the Audit Team within 20 days after the receipt of the BS as 

required by the GAM; and 

 

ii. coordinate with the concerned staff of RO-BARMM for the 
reconciliation of the records maintained by the RO with the accounting 

records, and both to exert extra effort to prepare the BRS of the RO-

BARMM in the ensuing year, using the transactions in CY 2019 and 

CY 2020 as base years in the preparation of the BRS. 

 
Non-submission of paid Disbursement Vouchers to the COA Office 

 

106. Four Disbursement Vouchers (DVs) totaling P337,507.62 and related 
supporting documents were not yet submitted/forwarded to the COA Office as of 

June 10, 2021, contrary to Sections 39 and 4(6) of Presidential Decree No. 1445, thus, 

hindering the timely audit of the transactions and the prompt correction of  errors 

and deficiencies, if any. 

 

107. Section 39 of PD 1445 states that:   
 

a. The Commission shall have the power, for purposes of inspection, to require the 
submission of the original of any order, deed, contract or other document under 



70 

which any collection, or payment from, government funds may be made, together 

with any certificate, receipt, or other evidence in connection therewith. 

 

b. It shall be the duty of the officials or employees concerned, including those in 
non-government entities under audit, or affected in the audit of government and 

non-government, to comply with these requirements. 

 

c. Failure or refusal to do so without justifiable cause shall be a ground for 
administrative disciplinary action as well as for disallowing permanently a 

claim under examination, assessing additional levy or government share, or 

withholding or withdrawing government funding or donations through the 

Government. 

 

108. Furthermore, Section 4(6) of the same Decree provides that “claims against 
government funds shall be supported with complete documentation”. 

 

109. Records showed that a total of four (4) paid vouchers for the months of January 01, 
2020 – December 31, 2020 amounting to P337,507.62 were not forwarded/submitted to 

the Audit Team (AT) for post-audit as required by Section 39 of PD 1445 despite the 

constant reminders of the AT. Presented in Table 14 below is the list of disbursement 

vouchers not forwarded/submitted to the COA Office for post audit as of this report:

110. The non-submission of Disbursement Vouchers and related supporting documents 
had precluded the Audit Team from evaluating the validity of the transactions and the 

propriety of the accounting entries made.  

 

111. The FMD explained that they overlooked the submission period and they were not 
even aware that the DVs were not submitted until the AOM was issued. It was only then 

when they exerted effort to locate the DVs. This was due also to the COVID-19 outbreak. 

 

112. The said transactions and their corresponding accounting treatment, if found 

improper, may affect the assets, liabilities and expenses of the agency.  

113. The non-compliance of concerned officials with the requirements of COA hindered 
the Audit Team from the conduct of a systematic and effective review of the transactions 

with the end view of generating timely and relevant audit results. 



71 

 

114. We recommended and Management agreed that the Chief, Administrative 
Division and the Chief, Finance Management Division to submit immediately the four 

disbursement vouchers amounting to P337,507.62 with the corresponding complete 

supporting documents to the COA Office for post-audit and to avoid 

suspension/disallowance in audit. 

 

115. The Chief of Administrative Division informed the Audit Team that they already 
found one of the four disbursements vouchers amounting to P245,011.61 and will exert 

efforts together with the Chief, FMD to find the other vouchers in the ensuing year and 

will submit it immediately to the Audit Team.   

 

Non-Compliance with the “Transparency Seal” law  

 

116. Transparency in governance was not fully assured by the NNC when the 
posting and updating of the information on the required ‘Transparency Seal’ in its 

official website have not been completely undertaken as mandated under Sections 89, 

90, 91 and 94 of the General Provisions (GP) of the General Appropriations Act 

(GAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 or Republic Act (RA) No. 11465; thus, depriving the 

public of inclusiveness to the pertinent information necessary to enforce 

accountability among its officials. 
 

117. Section 94 of the General Provisions of the  GAA of FY 2020 or RA 11465 on the 
Transparency Seal provides: 

 

“To enhance transparency and enforce accountability, all agencies of the 

government shall maintain a Transparency Seal to be posted on their websites. 

The Transparency Seal shall contain the following information: (i) the agency’s 

mandates and functions, names of its officials with their position and 

designation, and contact information; (ii) approved budgets and corresponding 

targets, immediately upon approval of this Act; (iii) modifications made 

pursuant to the general and special provisions in this Act; (iv) annual 

procurement plan/s and contracts awarded with the winning supplier, 

contractor or consultant; (v) major activities or projects categorized in 

accordance with the 0+10 point socio economic agenda and their target 

beneficiaries;   (vi) status of implementation, evaluation or assessment reports 

of said programs or projects; (vii) Budget and Financial Accountability 

Reports; (viii) People’s Freedom of Information (FOI) Manual signed  by head 

of agency, Agency Information Inventory, 2018 and 2019 FOI Summary 

Report, and 2018 and 2019 FOI Registry; and (ix) annual reports on the status 

of income authorized by law to be retained and/or used and be deposited 

outside of the National Treasury, which shall include the legal basis for its 

retention and/or use, the beginning balance, income collected and its sources, 

expenditures, and ending balance for the preceding fiscal year. 

 



72 

The heads of the agencies and their web administrators or their equivalent shall 

be responsible for ensuring compliance with this section.” 

 

118. Further, Section 4 of Memorandum Circular (MC) No. 2020-1 dated June 2, 2020 
issued by Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) on the Harmonization of National Government 

Performance Monitoring, Information and Reporting Systems on Guidelines on the Grant 

of the PBB for Fiscal Year 2020 under Executive Order Nos. 80 s. 2012 and 201 s. 2016, 

likewise provides the Good Governance Conditions (GCGs) based on performance drivers 

of the Results-Based Performance Management System (RBPMS) and the priorities of the 

Duterte Administration for 1) heightened transparency; 2) stronger public accountability; 

and 3) more inclusive and people-centered public service, as one of the conditions to be 

eligible for the grant of PBB. Among these is the maintenance/update of the agency 

Transparency Seal (TS) under Section 94 of the GP of the FY 2020 GAA.   

 

119. Ideally, the Transparency Seal summarizes all the needed data in the nine identified 
components as prescribed in the current budget act. It is depicted by a pearl shining out of 

an open shell, which is a symbol of a policy shift towards openness in access to government 

information. It hopes to inspire Filipinos in the civil service to be more open to citizen 

engagement; on the other hand, it invites the citizenry to exercise their right to participate 

in governance. This initiative is envisioned as a step in the right direction towards 

solidifying the position of the country as a shining example for democratic virtue in the 

region. 

 

120. Verification of the Agency’s official website at https://www.nnc.gov.ph showed 
the extent of compliance of NNC with the following requirements mandated under Section 

94 of the GP, GAA for FY 2020, as shown in Table 15, below:

121. Additionally, the following requirements of various Sections of the General 
Provisions of the GAA were also not complied with by the NNC. Details are shown in 

Table 16:

122. Management’s failure to fully utilize its official website to disclose to the public all 
the vital information enumerated above is a glaring setback in adopting measures to ensure 

transparency and accountability which is required from the Agency, as one of the budgetary

reforms being undertaken to encourage good governance among the different branches of 

government.   

 

123. Similarly, the need to employ these available digital platforms is more fitting 
nowadays due to the challenges brought in by the pandemic, where restriction of movement 

is imposed across the country.   Making use of the advances provided by this website to 

communicate the important information is now the new norm that is unparalleled and 

paramount under these circumstances. 

 

124. Moreover, these deficiencies also affected the Agency’s eligibility for PBB in CY 
2020 due to non-compliance with the good governance conditions required under MC No. 

2020-1 dated June 2, 2020 issued by IATF on the Harmonization of National Government 

Performance Monitoring, Information, and Reporting Systems.  

 

125. We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 

a. comply strictly with Sections 89, 90, 91, and 94 of the General Provisions of the 
GAA of 2020 or RA 11465, and Section 4 of Memorandum Circular 2020-1 

dated June 2, 2020 issued by the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) on the 

Harmonization of National Government Performance Monitoring, 

Information and Reporting Systems; and 
 

b. ensure that the Agency’s available information technology resources are 
utilized to make certain that the transparency and accountability of its 

operational and financial affairs are strictly implemented.  

 
126. Management commented that the staff in-charge from the Financial Management 
Division already submitted the required information and posted it at the NNC Website on 

June 28, 2021 after receipt of the COA AOM No._2021-001(2020) dated June 1, 2021. 

 

Non-marking of motor vehicle 

 

127. The NNC Regional Office XI motor vehicle does not bear the required official 
markings with the name and logo of the Office, which is contrary to COA Circular 

No. 77-61 dated September 26, 1977. 

 

128. Pertinent provisions of COA Circular No. 77-61 dated September 26,1977 state: 
 

“All motor vehicles owned by the government should be plainly marked, “For 

Official Use Only” (3 inches), under which should be written the 

corresponding name of the Office operating or using the same.  The mark 

should appear on each side of the motor vehicle.  When there is no sufficient space 

on each side, the same should appear at the back and on the front just below the 

wind shield of the motor vehicles. 

 



75 

In addition, no disbursement voucher for fuel consumption (gasoline and oil) of 

government vehicles shall be allowed in audit unless duly supported by properly 

accomplished and approved serially numbered driver’s trip tickets, and the 

government vehicles involved are plainly marked “For Official Use Only” and 

bear government plates only with the exception of security vehicles exempt from 

using government plates.” 

 

129. Management had long been verbally advised to comply with the requirement of 
having official markings on their service vehicle.  While Management was compliant with 

the preparation of the Monthly Report of Fuel Consumption and approved Trip Tickets for 

the past years, their motor vehicle has yet to be marked with “For Official Use Only” and 

the corresponding name and logo of the Office.  

 

130. The markings of government vehicles with “For Official Use Only” and its Office 
name and logo is a control measure to deter their unauthorized use.  But this requirement 

was not given priority by Management again during the year. 

 

131. We recommended and Management of RO XI agreed to mark NNC’s motor 
vehicle with “For Official Use Only” and the corresponding logo and name of the 

Office in the ensuing year to avoid audit disallowance on any further disbursements 

for its maintenance and fuel consumption; and 

 

132. We further recommended that the Management of NNC-CO will likewise issue 
a memorandum to the NPC of RO XI for the immediate compliance of the preceding 

audit recommendation, to avoid audit suspension or disallowance on the succeeding 

disbursements involving the subject service vehicle. 

 

133. While the Management of NNC-RO XI agreed to the audit recommendation in the 
CY 2019 Audit Report on the required markings of the motor vehicle assigned to the said 

RO, no compliance was done in CY 2020; hence, the recommendation of the NNC-CO 

AT, the issuance of a memorandum to the NPC of RO XI for immediate compliance in the 

succeeding year.   

 

Non-Preparation/Submission of MRAAF 

 

134. Monthly Report of Accountability for Accountable Forms (MRAAF) were not 
prepared and submitted by NNC ROs XI and XII, contrary to pertinent provisions 

of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM). 

 

135. The Report of Accountability for Accountable Forms, its preparation and 
submission to the Office of the Auditor are prescribed in Appendix No. 67 of the 

Government Accounting Manual (GAM) Volume II which states that: 

 

“Report of Accountability for Accountable Forms (RAAF) is used by each 

Accountable Officer to report the result of the physical count of all 

accountable forms, with or without face value such as checks, stamps, 



76 

official receipts.  LDDAP-ADA, etc., in his/her custody.  It shall be 

prepared monthly and by fund cluster.” 

 

136. The NNC-RO XI Accountable Officer (AO) has not yet prepared the Report of 
Accountability for Accountable Forms (RAAF) for the LBP checks in her custody. 

 

137. Management is reminded that habitual non-submission of the required financial 
reports may be penalized accordingly under Section 122 of PD 1445, which states: 

 

Section 122.  Submission of reports.  Whenever deemed necessary in the 

exigencies of the service, the Commission may under regulations issued by it 

require the agency heads, chief accountants, budget officers, cashiers, 

disbursing officers, administrative of personnel officers, and other responsible 

officials of the various agencies to submit trial balances, physical inventory 

reports, current plantilla of personnel, and such other reports as may be 

necessary for the exercise of its functions. 

 

Failure on the part of the officials concerned to submit the documents and reports 

mentioned herein shall automatically cause the suspension of payment of their 

salaries until they shall have complied with the requirements of the Commission. 

 

No appropriation authorized in the General Appropriations Act shall be available 

to pay the salary or any official or employee who violates the provisions of this 

section, without prejudice to any disciplinary action that may be instituted against 

such official or employee. 

 

138. We recommended and the Management of NNC-RO XI agreed to require the 
concerned AO to submit to the Office of the Auditor, NNC-RO XI, the RAAF as 

required by Appendix 67 of the GAM, and to strictly observe the prescribed period 

of submission thereof. 

 

Late submission of Purchase Orders/Contracts 

 

139. Delays ranging from 3 days to 182 days were incurred by NNC-RO III in the 
submission of purchase orders and service contracts together with their supporting 

documents, contrary to COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009, thus, 

preventing the timely review and evaluation of the transactions. 

 

140. COA Circular 2009-001 states that, “within five (5) working days from the 
execution of a contract by the government or any of its subdivisions, agencies or 

instrumentalities, including government-owned and controlled corporations and their 

subsidiaries, a copy of said contract and each of all the documents forming part thereof by 

reference or incorporation shall be furnished to the Auditor of the agency concerned. In 

case of agencies audited on an engagement basis, submission of a copy of the contract and 

its supporting documents shall be to the Auditor of the mother agency or parent company, 

as the case may be.” 



77 

 

141. Review/verification of Purchase Orders/Service Contracts submitted to the COA 
Office in NNC-RO III showed delays, ranging from 3 days to 182 days, together with the 

supporting documents, for review/evaluation by the AT. 

 

142. Due to the failure of the NPC, NNC-RO III to submit the Purchase Orders/Service 
Contracts within the prescribed period, i.e., within five working days from the execution 

of the contract, we were prevented from timely reviewing and evaluating said contracts 

and the documents supporting the transactions. 

 

143. We recommended and Management agreed to require the responsible 
personnel to immediately submit all the duly approved purchase orders and service 

contracts, together with their supporting documents, within the reglementary period 

of five working days from the date of perfection so as not to hinder the agency’s 

compliance with the provisions of COA Circular No. 2009-001. 

 

144. Management of NNC-RO III acknowledged the audit observation and agreed to 
comply with the audit recommendation in the ensuing year.  In addition, Management 

expressed its utmost gratitude for the technical support of the NNC-RO III AT in promoting 

the highest standard of performance to the government. 

 

Absence of documentary evidence to substantiate the payments of transactions  

 
145. The validity and propriety of disbursements of NNC-RO XI totaling P1.081 
million could not be ascertained due to payments made with incomplete 

documentation, which is a violation of Section 4, PD 1445 and COA Circular No. 

2012-001. 

 

146. This is a reiteration of prior years’ audit observations. 
 

147. Section 4 Paragraph 6 of the Presidential Decree 1445 provides that, “claims 
against government funds shall be supported with complete documentation.” 

 

148. COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 prescribes the general 
documentary requirements for Common Government Transactions.  Included therein the 

provision, among others, that claims on government funds shall be supported with 

complete documentation. 

 

149. Contrary to these requirements, various transactions totaling P1,080,841.96 were 
approved/paid despite the absence of the minimum documentary requirements, or no 

supporting documents at all, attached to the disbursement voucher, thus, the validity and 

propriety of the transactions could not be ascertained.  Details are summarized in Table 19 

below.

TOTAL 44 1,080,841.96  

 

150. The absence of the basic documentary requirements hinders the complete 
verification of the validity and propriety of the payments made.  The lack of complete 

documentation indicates that internal control over disbursements of the agency is weak, 

thereby, exposing government funds to risks of loss and wastage. 

 

151. More so, we observed that the NNC-RO XI failed to observe the internal control 
on disbursements by not stamping or marking “PAID” all disbursement vouchers and its 



79 

supporting documents upon payment pursuant to Section 124 of PD 1445.  This is to avoid 

possible recycling of documents and double payment of claims. 

 

152. We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 

a. Immediately submit the lacking supporting documents of the paid 
disbursement vouchers to avoid issuance of Notice of Suspension; 

 

b. Attach a Checklist of Documentary Requirements, as provided in COA 
Circular No. 2012-001, in all its disbursements; and 

 

c. Stamp or mark “Paid” all the paid DVs and its supporting documents. 

 
 

D. Other Compliance Issues 
 

Compliance with Programs and Projects Related to GAD 

 

153. The concern GAD official of NNC-CO continuously complied the 
requirements of Section 31 of the General Provisions of the GAA for FY 2020, with 

the allocation of P37.106 million for the CY 2020 GAD Plan and Budget (GPB), 

representing 12.23 percent of the approved appropriations of ₱303.438 million while 

reported the actual utilization of ₱21.447 million or 57.80 percent of the GPB.  

 

154. Section 31 of the General Provisions of the General Appropriations Act (GAA) for 
FY 2020 states that, “All agencies of the government shall formulate a Gender and 

Development (GAD) Plan designed to address gender issues within their concerned sectors 

or mandate and implement the applicable provisions under R.A. No. 9710 or the Magna 

Carta for Women, Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against 

Women, the Beijing Platform for Action, the Philippine Plan for Gender-Responsive 

Development (1995-2025) and the Philippine Development Plan (2017-2022). 

 

155. The GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of the agencies, which 
shall be at least five percent (5%) of their budgets.  For this purpose, activities currently 

being undertaken by agencies which relate to GAD or those that contribute to poverty 

alleviation, economic empowerment especially of marginalized women, protection, 

promotion, and fulfillment of women’s human rights, and practice of gender-responsive 

governance are considered sufficient, compliance with said requirement.  Utilization of 

GAD budget shall be evaluated based on the GAD performance indicators identified by 

said agencies. 

 

156. The preparations and submission of the annual GAD Plan and annual GAD 
Accomplishment shall be subject to the guidelines issued by agencies concerned. 

 

157. Based on the Agency’s report on accomplishment particularly on GAD as at 
December 31, 2020, Management had allotted ₱37,106,286.00 or an equivalent of 12.23 



80 

percent of current appropriations of ₱303,438,000.00 and had an actual utilization of 

₱21,446,727.45, having implemented three (3) client-focused activities and five (5) 

organizational-focused activities. 

 

158. We recommended and Management agreed to commend the concerned GAD 
official and employees for the continuous compliance with the provisions of the GAA

Section 32 of the General Provisions of the General Appropriations Act (GAA) for 

FY 2020, in relation to the programs and projects for the SCs and PWDs. 

 

161. Section 32 of the General Provisions of the GAA for FY 2020 mandates that: 
 

“Sec. 33. Programs and Projects related to Senior Citizens and Persons with 

Disability. All agencies of the government shall formulate plans, programs and 

projects intended to address the concerns of senior citizens and persons with 

disability, insofar as it relates to their mandated functions, and integrate the same 

to their regular activities. 

 

Moreover, all government infrastructures and facilities shall provide architectural 

or structural features, design or facilities that will reasonably enhance the mobility, 

safety and welfare of persons with disability pursuant to Batas Pambansa Blg. 344 

and RA No. 7277, as amended.” 

 

162. Management did not submit any accomplishment report on the programs for Senior 
Citizens (SCs) and Persons with Disability (PWDs) due to the non-implementation of

programs/projects intended for the SCs and PWDs in the succeeding year and to
