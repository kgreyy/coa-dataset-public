EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 

A. Introduction 
 

The National Nutrition Council (NNC) was created in 1974 by virtue of 

Presidential Decree No. 491, otherwise known as the “Nutrition Act of the 

Philippines”.  The NNC is the country’s policy-making and coordinating body on 

nutrition.  The Council was reorganized through Executive Order No. 234 s.1987 and 

Administrative Order No. 88 s.1988.  It was attached to the Department of Health 

(DOH) on November 30, 2005.  The NNC was instructed to realign its operations to 

focus on client-based activities and to address hunger and malnutrition in the context of 

Millennium Development Goals (MDG). 

 

As the policy-making and coordinating body on nutrition, the NNC has the 

following objectives: 

 

 Formulate national food and nutrition policies and strategies; 
 

 Coordinate the planning, monitoring and evaluation of the national nutrition 
program; 

 

 Coordinate the release of funds, loans and grants from government and non-
government organizations; and 

 

 Call on any department, bureau, office, agency and other instrumentalities of 
the government for assistance in the form of personnel, facilities and resources 

as the need arises. 

 

The Council consists of a Governing Board (GB) composed of representatives 

from 10 government agencies and three (3) from the private sector.  It is chaired by the 

Secretary of the DOH, and assisted by a Secretariat headed by Executive Director 

Azucena M. Dayanghirang, MD, MCH, CESE. 

 

There are three (3) technical divisions each headed by a Nutrition Officer (NO), 

namely: the Nutrition Policy and Planning Division (NPPD), Nutrition Surveillance 

Division (NSD), and Nutrition Information and Education Division (NIED).  The 

Finance Management Division (FMD) and Administrative Division (AD) are the two 

(2) support divisions.   

 

There are 17 Regional Field Offices (RFOs), each headed by Nutrition Program 

Coordinator (NPC).  The RFOs are under the direct supervision of the Office of the 

Executive Director.  

 

As of December 31, 2020, the Council has 108 authorized positions, of which 

95 were filled up and 117 Job Order/Contractual personnel with total warm bodies of 

212.

On December 31, 2019, a new disease known globally as the Coronavirus 2019 

(COVID-19) went viral in the social media and started in Wuhan City, China. The new 

disease was caused by a novel virus called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 

Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The Philippines recorded its first case of COVID-19 on 

January 30, 2020 and on the same date, the World Health Organization (WHO) 

considered it as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). With 

the rising number of cases with distribution of the disease to more than 100 countries, 

the WHO declared COVID-19 disease as a pandemic on March 11, 2020. The 

following day, the Philippine government, recognizing that this disease poses a public 

health threat, raised the Code Alert Level to Code Red Sublevel Two. This necessitated 

the issuance of subsequent guidelines for the effective management and control of the 

disease including the strategy to strengthen the surge capacity of health facilities in 

addressing the potential increase in COVID-19 cases. 
 

In response to this crisis brought by the 2019 Novel Coronavirus pandemic the 

NNC issued Guidelines for the Prevention, Control, Mitigation of the Spread of the 

Corona Virus Disease – 19 (COVID-19).  These guidelines apply to all NNC 

Employees, both regular plantilla and job order/contractual personnel in the Central 

Office and Regional offices.  
 

Some of the health and safety protocols implemented in NNC Offices are; 

 

a.) Use of non-contact thermal scanner for temperature checks 
b.) Mandatory wearing of face masks 
c.) Frequent hand washing and use of hand sanitizer  
d.) Observance of social or physical distancing  
e.) Implementation of Alternative Work Arrangements

C. Scope of Audit 
 

The audit covered the accounts and operations of NNC for the year ended 

December 31, 2020. The audit was conducted to:  (a) verify the level of assurance that 

may be placed on management’s assertions on the financial statements; (b) recommend 

agency’s improvement opportunities; (c) determine the propriety of transactions as well 

as the extent of compliance with pertinent laws, rules and regulations; and (d) 

determine the extent of implementation of prior year’s audit recommendations. 
 

D. Independent Auditor’s Report 
 

A qualified opinion was rendered on the financial statements of the NNC as at 

December 31, 2020. 

 

E. Summary of Significant Observations and Recommendations 
 

1. The reported balance of the CIB-LCCA account amounting to ₱525.505 million as at 
December 31, 2020 is inaccurate and unreliable due to unrecorded prior years’ and 

current year’s  liquidations/disbursements of majority of the NNC regional offices 

which resulted in the significant difference between balance per books and balance per 

bank confirmation/statements amounting to P504.820 million, contrary to the 

provisions of Section 74 of Presidential Decree (PD) 1445 and Sections 4 to 7, Chapter 

21 of  the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies 

(NGAs), Volume I. 
 

We recommended and Management agreed to require/direct the:  

 
a) The Accountants of the NNC-Central Office (NNC-CO), and the NPCs in the 

ROs to: (i) collaborate/coordinate with each other for the immediate 

submission of the BSs not yet forwarded to the Accounting Unit for the 

reconciliation of the balances with the recorded fund transfers and the 

corresponding withdrawals/ disbursements in the books of NNC-Central 

Office and the cashbooks of the NPCs to decrease the discrepancy noted in the 

ledger books with the BSs;  and (ii) facilitate the verification of the submitted 

BS with the BCLs of the NNC-ROs and forward the same to the Audit Team 

within 20 days after receipt of the BS, as required in Sections 4 to 7, Chapter 

21 of the GAM, Volume I; and 
 



iv 
 

b) Accountants to exert utmost effort to validate/verify in the agency’s previous 
records the details, nature and identities of the forwarded unreconciled 

beginning balance from prior years as well as the supporting documents 

pertaining thereto. 

 

2. Unrecorded issuances of Information, Education, and Communication (IEC) materials 
amounting ₱1.898 million and office supplies amounting ₱0.146 million overstated the 

Other Supplies and Materials for Distribution and Office Supplies accounts and 

understated the Other Supplies and Materials for Distribution Expense and Office 

Supplies Expense accounts. 

 

We recommended that Management require the:  

 

a) Chief, Financial Management Division to submit/provide to the Accountant all 
copies of RSMIs and RISs received by their office in CY 2020 for the 

appropriate recording of transactions in the books; 

 

b) The Chief, FMD to officially instruct the Property/Supply Officer to submit  
all pertinent supporting documents of the succeeding issuances of office 

supplies inventory, directly to the Office of the Chief Accountant, at least on a 

monthly basis, to avoid similar incident/deficiency in the ensuing year; and 

 

c) The Accountant to prepare the JEV, upon receipt of the RSMIs and RISs from 
the Office of the Chief, FMD and record in the books the issuances of IECs 

and office supplies to effect the necessary adjustments in the accounts Office 

Supplies Inventory, Other Supplies and Materials Inventory-for Distribution and 

Government Equity, immediately in CY 2021, copy furnished the Audit Team 

for audit purposes. 

 

3. Non-submission by NNC Region XI of the Cash in Bank Register (CBReg) together 
with the disbursement vouchers and other required supporting documents on the 

utilization of funds received from NNC-Central Office amounting to P1.215 million, 

hindering timely review of transactions and recommending corrective measures for 

deficiencies found in audit and in violation of Section 11, Chapter 6 of the GAM, 

Volume I. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to submit immediately the CB Reg 

with the disbursement vouchers including the complete supporting documents for 

the P1,215,341.00 funding received from Central Office, and henceforth, submit 

all succeeding CBReg on time as required under Section 11, Chapter 6 of the 

GAM, Volume I. 

 

4. The long-outstanding balance of the Due from National Government Agencies account 
amounting to P32.724 million as at December 31, 2020 for more than 10 years became 

dormant due to inadequate monitoring/follow-up/coordination with the concerned 

national government agencies to enforce the submission of liquidation reports for the 

funds transferred contrary to provisions of COA Circular No. 94-013 and COA 



v 
 

Circular  No. 2016-005,  thus, affecting the fair presentation of the accounts in the 

Financial Statements as at year-end. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require/direct the Accountant and 

the Chief, Finance Division to: 

 

a) collaborate and pursue the plan of reconciliation of the NNC records with the 
concerned NGAs for all the transferred funds, even for those only less than a 

year, by sending confirmation letters immediately in the ensuing year, for the 

immediate submission of liquidation reports. If efforts exerted will again fail, 

pay personal visits to the concerned NGAs (give priority to Fabella hospital, 

PIA, NDA, FNRI-DOST, ATI and the Procurement Service) to prevent the 

increase/accumulation of dormant balances, pursuant to the provisions of the 

Memorandum of Agreement and COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 

13, 1994; and 

 

b) consider to request for write-off of the dormant balances aged 10 years or 
older, particularly those with small amounts way back in 1985 and the 1990s 

and those in far places, if confirmation and personal visits seem remote due to 

the continuous COVID-19 outbreak and geographical locations, following the 

guidelines prescribed under COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 29, 

2016 and duly supported with valid documents. 

 

5. The existence of unreconciled/unknown balance between the General Ledger and 
Subsidiary Ledger of the Due from NGAs and Due from LGUs account amounting to 

P8.119 million rendered the balances presented in the Financial Statements unreliable 

and doubtful.. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to direct/require the Accountant and 

the Chief, FMD to:  

 

a) coordinate/collaborate for the immediate reconciliation of the NNC books with 
the IAs books particularly those balances with less than 10 years of age in the 

succeeding years to facilitate the determination of the source of the 

unreconciled balance between the SL and the GL books of accounts; and  

 

b) judiciously work on the reconciliation of the unreconciled balances between 
the SL and GL immediately in the ensuing year to determine not only the 

source but also the causes of the discrepancy.  Prepare the Journal Entry 

Voucher (JEV) and effect immediately the necessary adjustments in the books 

of accounts, after the reconciliation efforts between the SL and GL balances.  

 

6. The reliability, accuracy and existence of the reported balances of the Inventories 
accounts totaling to P60.835 million could not be ascertained due to the failure to 

conduct physical count of inventories as required in Section 13, Chapter 8  of 

Government Accounting Manual (GAM) because of lack of manpower and conflict in 

the alternative work arrangement during the COVID-19 pandemic and therefore no 



vi 
 

Report of Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) was prepared/submitted as well as no 

reconciliation of its result with the Accounting records is being conducted. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the: 

 

a) The Property/Supply Officer together with the Inventory Committee to 
conduct the semi-annual physical count of all unused inventories immediately 

in the ensuing year and submit the RPCI on the prescribed period, complete 

with the required data/information to the AT on or before July 31 and 

January 31 of each year for the 1st and 2nd semesters, respectively; and 

 

b) The Accountant and the Chairman of the Inventory Committee to coordinate 
and reconcile the result of the physical count with the Accounting records after 

the conduct of the physical inventory in the 1st semester of CY 2021. Any 

negative result, shall be investigated immediately, if so warranted. 

 

7. The validity/accuracy and existence of the Property, Plant and Equipment accounts 
totaling ₱64.260 million as at December 31, 2020 is unreliable/uncertain, due to: (a) 

failure of the inventory Committee to conduct the physical count of all property and 

equipment and consequently, no Report of Physical Count of Property, Plant and 

Equipment (RPCPPE) was prepared and submitted to the COA Office within the 

prescribed period as required in Sections 38 and 42, Chapter 10 of the Government 

Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I; (b) 

unreconciled balances between CY 2020 General Ledger and CY 2019 Report of 

Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE, latest report) with a 

variance of ₱17.629 million, which proved that no reconciliation effort was made 

between the Accounting records and the RPCPPE, pursuant to Section 42 of the GAM, 

Volume I; (c) unserviceable PPEs were still included in the PPE accounts; and (d) other 

PPE accounts amounting to P1.076 included unidentified PPEs valued at P.976 million.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require/direct the: 

 

a) Property Officer, together with the Inventory Committee, to: i) conduct a 
complete annual physical inventory of PPE in CY 2021, nationwide, at an 

earlier schedule if the current situation of the COVID-19 pandemic already 

permits; ii) prepare and submit the RPCPPE report using the prescribed form 

to the Audit Team on or before January 31 of the following year in compliance 

with Section 38, Chapter 10  of the GAM, Volume I; and iii) coordinate with 

the Accountant for the immediate reconciliation of the result of physical count 

with the accounting and property records before the final preparation of the 

RPCPPE for CY 2021; 

 

b) The concerned officials of the Accounting Division and Administration 
Division to coordinate with the members of the Inventory Committee and 

continue the on-going reconciliation between the CY 2020 General Ledger 

books with the CY 2019 RPCPPE in order to reduce the difference of 

P17,629,006.95 between the balances per books and per physical count, in the 



vii 
 

ensuing year. Any discrepancy noted between the two records shall be 

immediately verified/investigated and adjusted; 

 

c) The Property Officer to submit immediately to the Accounting Division, the 
copy of IIRUP in the succeeding year for recognition in the books of the 

unserviceable properties and impairment loss, if any; 

 

d) The Accountant to prepare the JEV for dropping from the books the 
unserviceable PPE upon securing a copy of IIRUP from the Property Officer 

and after the validation of the Accounting Staff of the veracity of the report, 

and the recognition of impairment loss, if any, copy furnished the COA Office 

for monitoring purposes; 

 

e) The Inventory Committee to include in the RPCPPE for CY 2020, the Motor 
Vehicle purchased in CY 2018;  

 

f) The Accountant to prepare the JEV for the appropriate reclassification of 
property items with acquisition cost below the ₱15,000.00 capitalization 

threshold totaling P213,045.12, to the Semi-Expendable Property accounts as 

required under Item 5.4 of COA Circular No. 2016-006  and replace the 

Property Accountability Receipt (PAR) previously issued to the accountable 

persons to Inventory Custodian Slips (ICS) for control purposes
