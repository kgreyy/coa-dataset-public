DON MARIANO MARCOS 

MEMORIAL STATE UNIVERSITY

Bacnotan, La Union







For the Year ended December 31, 2020

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY





A)	Introduction 



The enactment of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1778 dated January 15, 1981 paved the way for the establishment of the Don Mariano Marcos Memorial State University (DMMMSU). It was reorganized in 1993 into three major campuses namely: North La Union Campus (NLUC) in Bacnotan, La Union; Mid La Union Campus (MLUC) in San Fernando, and South La Union Campus (SLUC) in Agoo.



On March 26, 1998, the DMMMSU Open University System (DOUS) was created by Board of Regents (BOR) Resolution No. 98-024.  Two national institutes were likewise established by virtue of Republic Act (RA) No. 7359 and RA No. 9151, the Sericulture Research and Development Institute (SRDI) and the National Apiculture Research, Training and Development Institute (NARTDI), respectively.



The University’s mandate was to provide advance instruction in arts, agriculture, fishery, engineering, and natural sciences, as well as in other technological and professional fields to promote research and engage in extension work.



All of the campuses and operating units maintain complete set of books of accounts for each of the different funds held by them, to wit:

Basis for Qualified Opinion



The basis for the qualified opinion on the fairness of the presentation of the financial statements of DMMMSU as of December 31, 2020 were the following:



a)					Understatement of the following accounts (1) Accounts Payable - ₱60,413,187.93 (2) Construction in Progress – (CIP) Buildings and Other Structures - ₱58,440,034. and (3) Other Machinery and Equipment - ₱1,973,153.90 due to non-recognition in the books of accounts Due and Demandable Accounts Payable.

e)					Delayed/Non-submission of Disbursement Vouchers (DVs) and related supporting documents of paid expenditures recorded in the books of accounts of DMMMSU for Calendar Year 2020 amounting to ₱31,492,500.44.



We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAI). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. 



We are independent of the agency in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.  We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our qualified opinion.





Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial Statements



Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with IPSAS, and for such internal control as management determines necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error.



Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Agency’s financial reporting process.











Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements



Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion.  Reasonable assurance is a high-level assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISSAI will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.  Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS





 1.  	GENERAL INFORMATION /AGENCY PROFILE



The Consolidated financial statements of DMMMSU were authorized for issue on February 11, 2021 as shown in the Statement of Management Responsibility for Financial Statements signed by Dr. Jaime I. Manuel Jr., the Head of Agency/University President.



Created by virtue of PD No. 1778 on January 15, 1981, DMMMSU was created to cater to the aspirations of the people merging five former schools of La Union as follows: Don Mariano Marcos Memorial State College (formerly known as Don Mariano Marcos Memorial College of Agriculture and La Union Agricultural School) founded on June 18, 1960, located in Barangay Sapilang, Bacnotan, La Union; La Union School of Arts and Trades (located in San Fernando, La Union, founded in 1907); Southern Ilocos Polytechnic State College (composed of Southern La Union National High School in Agoo, Sto. Tomas College of Fisheries, and Rosario National Agricultural School established on July 28, 1977); Community College of La Union (located in San Fernando founded in 1968); and Sapilang Elementary School (located in Barangay Sapilang, Bacnotan, La Union founded in June 1969).



Embodied in its charter, the University has a mandate to provide advanced instruction in the arts, agriculture, forestry, fishery, engineering, and natural sciences as well as in the technological and professional fields; and to promote research and engage in extension. Based on the its mandate, DMMMSU envisions to become a globally competitive university. 



DMMMSU has three  major campuses located in different towns of the province of La Union namely: the North La Union Campus in Bacnotan as the Main Campus and the seat of the Central Administration; the Mid La Union Campus and the Open University System in San Fernando City, and the South La Union Campus in Agoo including the College of Agriculture in Rosario and the College of Fisheries in Sto. Tomas. Acknowledged for its distinct competence, expertise and resources, DMMMSU is home to a number of special projects. These include the Sericulture Research and Development Institute (SRDI), National Apiculture Research, Training and Development Institute (NARTDI), Fisheries Research and Training Institute, DMMMSU Pig Extension and Research Farm, Philippine Carabao Center, Affiliated Non-Conventional Energy Center, and Metal Crafts and Innovation Center.



The principal office address of DMMMSU is in Sapilang, Bacnotan, La Union where the Central Administration is situated. 



	 2.  	Statement of Compliance and Basis of Preparation of Financial Statements

	

The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with and comply with the IPSAS. 



The financial statements are presented in Philippine peso, which is the functional and reporting currency of the University.



The financial statements have been prepared on the basis of historical Cost, unless stated otherwise.  



The Statement of Cash Flows is prepared using the direct method.



 3.  	Summary of Significant Accounting Policies



3.1	Basis of Accounting



The Consolidated Financial Statements of the DMMMSU are prepared on accrual basis in accordance with the IPSAS.



3.2	Consolidation of Financial Statements



The different operating units or campuses of the University maintain their own separate set of book of accounts for Fund 101 (Regular Fund), Fund 184 (Trust Fund), Fund 164 (Special Trust Fund) and Fund 161 (Revolving Fund) where their financial transactions and operations are accounted and recorded in conformity with existing accounting rules and regulations. Financial statements generated from these funds of the operating units are submitted to the University Central Administration for consolidation.



All significant intra-agency receivables/ intra-agency payables transactions are eliminated in the consolidation of financial statements. 

3.3	Cash and Cash Equivalents



Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and cash in bank, deposits on call and highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less, which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value. 



3.4 	Receivables



Receivables are measured at fair value of the receivable for school fees and selling price of goods and services of the Income Generating Projects (IGPs) of DMMMSU less provision for impairment or allowance for estimated irrecoverable amounts arising from non-collection based on a review of the outstanding amounts at the reporting date.



Receivables from school fees not covered by the Free Higher Education Program of the government are recognized as an asset upon enrolment or submission by the Registrar’s Office of the list of officially registered students or student assessment forms to the Accounting Office with revenue normally being recognized at the same point.  



Allowance for impairment-accounts receivable



The policy of providing allowance includes the aging of receivables method of estimating uncollectible accounts. By this method, the accounts are classified according to age from ninety (90) days or less to over three (3) years and provisions for the allowance for impairment-accounts receivable shall be as follows:



Age of Accounts

Percentage 





Less than 90 days

2

91-365 days

3

Over 1 year

5

Over 2 years

5

3 years and above

5



Writing-off of receivables



DMMMSU adopts the guidelines provided for under existing government accounting and auditing rules when writing-off dormant receivables. The following conditions must be present to support the request for approval to COA: 



--	Absence of records or documents to validate/support the claim and/or unreconciled reciprocal accounts; 

--	Death of the accountable officer/employee/debtor;

--	Unknown whereabouts of the accountable officer/employee/debtor, and that he/she could not be located despite diligent efforts to find him/her;

--	Incapacity to pay or insolvency;

--	Exhaustion of all possible remedies by the Management to collect the receivables and to demand liquidation of each advances and fund transfers; or

--	No pending case in court involving the subject dormant accounts.

3.5 	Inventories

	

				Inventory is measured at cost upon initial recognition.  To the extent that inventory was received through non-exchange transactions (for no cost or for a nominal cost), the cost of the inventory is its fair value at the date of acquisition. 

				

				Costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition are accounted for, as follows:

		

--			Raw materials: purchase cost using the weighted average cost method;

--			Finished goods and work in progress: cost of direct materials and labor and a proportion of manufacturing overheads based on the normal operating capacity, but excluding borrowing costs

		

				Inventories comprising agricultural produce harvested from biological assets shall be measured on initial recognition of their fair value less costs to sell at the point of harvest.  

		

Inventories are recognized as an expense when deployed for utilization or consumption in the ordinary course of operations of the DMMMSU. 



	3.6 	Investment Property

	

	Investment properties are measured initially at cost, including transaction costs. The carrying amount includes the replacement cost of components of an existing investment property at the time that cost is incurred if the recognition criteria are met and excludes the costs of day-to-day maintenance of an investment property.

	

	Investment property acquired through a non-exchange transaction is measured at its fair value at the date of acquisition. Subsequent to initial recognition, investment properties are measured using the cost model and are depreciated over its estimated useful life.

	

	Investment properties are derecognized either when they have been disposed of or when the investment property is permanently withdrawn from use and no future economic benefit or service potential is expected from its disposal. The difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset is recognized in the surplus or deficit in the period of derecognition.

	

	Transfers are made to or from investment property only when there is a change in use.

	DMMMSU uses the cost model for the measurement of investment property after initial recognition.

	

	3.7	Property, Plant and Equipment

		

		Recognition

	

	An item is recognized as property, plant and equipment (PPE) if it meets the characteristics and recognition criteria as PPE.

		

				The characteristics of PPE are as follows:

--		Tangible items;

--		Are held for use in the production or supply of goods or services, for rental to others, or for administrative purposes; and

--		Are expected to be used during more than one reporting period.

	

	An item of PPE is recognized as an asset if:

--		It is probable that future economic benefits or service potential associated with the item will flow to the entity; and

--			The cost or fair value of the item can be measured reliably.

		

				  	Measurement at Recognition

	

			An item recognized as property, plant and equipment is measured at cost.

		

			A PPE acquired through non-exchange transaction is measured at its fair value at the date of acquisition.

				

The cost of the PPE is the cash price equivalent or, for PPE acquired through non-exchange transaction its cost is its fair value as at recognition date.

	

	Cost includes the following:

	

--			Its purchase price, including import duties and non-refundable purchase taxes, after deducting trade discounts and rebates;

--			Expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items; and

--			Initial estimate of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site on which it is located, the obligation for which the entity incurs either when the item is acquired, or as a consequence of having used the item during a particular period for purposes other than to produce inventories during the period.







Measurement After Recognition



After recognition, all PPE are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses



When significant parts of PPE are required to be replaced at intervals, the DMMMSU recognizes such parts as individual assets with specific useful lives and depreciates them accordingly. Likewise, when a major repair/replacement is done, its cost is recognized in the carrying amount of the plant and equipment as a replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied.



All other repair and maintenance costs are recognized as expense in surplus or deficit as incurred.



Depreciation



Each part of an item of PPE with a cost that is significant in relation to the total cost of the item is depreciated separately.



The depreciation charge for each period is recognized as expense unless it is included in the cost of another asset.



		Initial Recognition of Depreciation



Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use such as when it is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.



For simplicity and to avoid proportionate computation, the depreciation is for one month if the PPE is available for use on or before the 15th of the month. However, if the PPE is available for use after the 15th of the month, depreciation is for the succeeding month.



Depreciation Method



The straight-line method of depreciation is adopted unless another method is more appropriate for agency operation.



Estimated Useful Life



DMMMSU adopts the following Estimated Useful Life for each class of asset:



Account Title

Estimated Useful Life 





Land Improvements

10 years

Infrastructure Assets

20 years

Buildings and Other Structures

20-30 years

DMMMSU uses a residual value equivalent to at least five percent (5%) of the cost of the PPE.



Impairment



An asset’s carrying amount is written down to its recoverable amount, or recoverable service amount, if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable service amount.



Derecognition



DMMMSU derecognizes items of PPE and/or any significant part of an asset upon disposal or when no future economic benefits or service potential is expected from its continuing use.  Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the surplus or deficit when the asset is derecognized.



	3.8	Biological Assets



	Biological Assets are valued on initial recognition and at each reporting date at its fair value less cost to sell. The basis in determining the fair value of the biological assets is the price existing in the market in the Province of La Union. Changes in the fair value of the assets are adjusted in the month where the change in the price occurred. The price during the last week of the month is used as the basis in the valuation of the biological assets.

	

	Biological assets that are attached to land such as fruit- bearing trees are measured at standard/estimated cost on the basis of prevailing market prices in the absence of a separate market for biological assets that are attached to the land at the reporting date.

	

	Agricultural produce is initially measured at its fair value less cost to sell at the time of produce. The fair value of agricultural produce is based on market prices in the local area.

	

	

					Livestock Inventories for sale

		

		These are valued on initial recognition and at each reporting date at its fair value less cost to sell. Gain or loss arising on initial recognition of biological assets/livestock at its fair value less cost to sell and from a change in fair value less costs to sell of a biological asset/livestock due to price and physical change is recorded in the book and included in surplus or deficit for the period in which it arises.  

		

		Breeding Stocks

		

		Biological assets/livestock selected as breeders are recorded on initial recognition and at each reporting date at its fair value less cost to sell. Gain on sales of biological assets is recognized upon sale when the selling price is more than the book value or recorded cost. Loss on sales of biological assets is recorded for the mortality of Breeders and Inventories or when the allocated cost of the inventory is greater than the selling price. Gain or loss arising from a change in fair value less costs to sell of a biological asset/livestock due to price change is also recorded in the book and included in surplus or deficit for the period in which it arises.



3.9 	Intangible Assets



		Intangible assets acquired are initially recognized at cost.



		3.10     Revenue from non-exchange transactions

			Recognition and Measurement of Assets from Non-Exchange Transactions

		

		An inflow of resources from a non-exchange transaction, other than services in kind, that meets the definition of an asset were recognized as an asset if the following criteria were met:

		

--				It is probable that the future economic benefits or service potential associated with the asset will flow to the entity; and

--				The fair value of the asset can be measured reliably.

		

		An asset acquired through a non-exchange transaction is initially measured at its fair value as at the date of acquisition.

		

		

		

		

		

			Recognition Revenue from Non-Exchange Transactions

		

		An inflow of resources from a non-exchange transaction recognized as an asset is recognized as revenue, except to the extent that a liability is also recognized in respect of the same inflow.

		

		As DMMMSU satisfies a present obligation recognized as a liability in respect of an inflow of resources from a non-exchange transaction recognized as an asset, it reduces the carrying amount of the liability recognized and recognize an amount of revenue equal to that reduction.

		Measurement of Revenue from Non-Exchange Transactions

		

		Revenue from non-exchange transactions is measured at the amount of the increase in net assets recognized by the entity, unless a corresponding liability is recognized. 

		

		Measurement of Liabilities on Initial Recognition from Non-Exchange Transactions

		

		The amount recognized as a liability in a non-exchange transaction is the best estimate of the amount required to settle the present obligation at the reporting date. 

		

		Gifts and Donations

		

		DMMMSU recognizes assets and revenue from gifts and donations when it is probable that the future economic benefits or service potential will flow to the entity and the fair value of the assets can be measured reliably.

		

		Goods in-kind were recognized as assets when the goods were received, or there is a binding arrangement to receive the goods. If goods in-kind were received without conditions attached, revenue is recognized immediately. If conditions were attached, a liability is recognized, which is reduced and revenue recognized as the conditions were satisfied.

		

		On initial recognition, gifts and donations including goods in-kind were measured at their fair value as at the date of acquisition, which were ascertained by reference to an active market, or by appraisal. An appraisal of the value of an asset is normally undertaken by a member of the valuation profession who holds a recognized and relevant professional qualification. For many assets, the fair value was ascertained by reference to quoted prices in an active and liquid market. 

		

		

		Transfers

		

		DMMMSU recognizes an asset in respect of transfers when the transferred resources meet the definition of an asset and satisfy the criteria for recognition as an asset, except those arising from services in-kind.

		Transfers from other government entities

		

Revenues from non-exchange transactions with other government entities and the related assets were measured at fair value and recognized on obtaining control of the asset (cash, goods, services and property) if the transfer is free from conditions and it is probable that the economic benefits or service potential related to the asset will flow to DMMMSU and can be measured reliably.

3.11 	Revenue from Exchange transactions

	

		Measurement of Revenue

		

		Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable.

	

		Rendering of Services

	

		DMMMSU recognizes revenue from tuition fees and other school fees based on the approved rates by the Board of Regents.

	

			DMMMSU recognizes revenue from rendering of services by reference to the stage of completion when the outcome of the transaction can be estimated reliably.  The stage of completion is measured by reference to labor hours incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated hours.

	

		Where the contract outcome cannot be measured reliably, revenue is recognized only to the extent that the expenses incurred were recoverable.

	

		Sale of Goods

	

		Revenue from the sale of goods is recognized when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer, usually on the delivery of the goods and when the amount of the revenue can be measured reliably and it is probable that the economic benefits or service potential associated with the transaction will flow to DMMMSU.

	

	

	

		Rental income

	

		Rental Income arising from operating leases on investment properties is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease terms and included in revenue.

	

		Interest income



Interest income is recognized based on the computed interest income on bank deposits as reflected in the bank statement issued by the authorized government depository banks of DMMMSU.



3.12	Changes in accounting policies and estimates



DMMMSU recognizes the effects of changes in accounting policy retrospectively. The effects of changes in accounting policy were applied prospectively if retrospective application is impractical.



DMMMSU recognizes the effects of changes in accounting estimates    prospectively by including in surplus or deficit.



DMMMSU corrects material prior period errors retrospectively in the first set of financial statements authorized for issue after their discovery by:



--		Restating the comparative amounts for prior period(s) presented in which the error occurred, or

--		If the error occurred before the earliest prior period presented, restatingthe opening balances of assets, liabilities and net assets/equity for the earliest prior period presented.



	3.13 	Budget information



The annual budget is prepared on a cash basis and is published in the government website.

	

A separate Statement of Comparison of Budget and Actual Amounts (SCBAA) was prepared since the budget and the financial statements were not prepared on comparable basis.  The SCBAA was presented showing the original and final budget and the actual amounts on comparable basis to the budget.  Explanatory comments are provided in the notes to the annual financial statements.









3.14 	Employee benefits



The employees of the DMMMSU are members of the Government Insurance System (GSIS), which provides life and retirement insurance coverage.



DMMMSU recognizes the undiscounted amount of short-term employee benefits, like salaries, wages, bonus allowances, etc. as an expense.



DMMMSU recognizes expenses for accumulating compensated absences when these were paid (commuted or paid as terminal leave benefits).  Unused entitlements that has accumulated at the reporting date were not recognized as expense.  Non-accumulating compensated absences, like special leave privileges, were not recognized.



		3.15 	Subsequent Events

		

	Non-adjusting events after the balance sheet date which are so significant that non-disclosure would affect the ability of the users of the financial statements to make proper evaluation and decisions have to be disclosed by stating the nature of the event and an estimate of its financial effects.

	

	Information received after the balance sheet date about conditions that exist at the date to be stated to update the disclosures made.	

	

		3.16 	Measurement uncertainty

	

	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IPSAS, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reporting amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of the revenues and expenses during the period. Items requiring the use of significant estimates include the useful life of capital assets, impairment of assets, etc.

	

	Estimates were based on the best information available at the time of preparation of the financial statements and were reviewed annually to reflect new information as it becomes available. Measurement uncertainty exists in these financial statements. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

	

	

	

	

	

		3.17 	Prior Period Adjustments 

	

	DMMMSU has determined some prior year adjustments in the financial statements pertinent to prior year transactions and were reflected by restating the comparative amounts for the prior period.

Significant increases in the PPE are due to constructions, acquisitions or additions during the year. Likewise, the other properties and equipment does not include equipment acquired in prior years thru fabrication/purchase where the funding came from MOOE. Whereas, equipment/properties acquired through donation were included.



PPE which are already carried in the books at their salvage value or which had been fully depreciated are reclassified to Other Assets account. Also, all properties, plant & equipment with an acquisition cost of P 15,000.00 were also reclassified.	



PPE per books were not compared with the records of the Property Custodian at the Supply Office of CA and NLUC as to its physical existence.  Report on the result of the physical count of assets as of December 31, 2020 was not yet available from the Supply Office. 



Lands



Lands owned by DMMMSU are valued at its assessed value as of 2009. The lots recorded in the books were carried over from the previous years as a result of the acquisitions made by the University since its inception which were acquired either through sale or donation. Due to the absence of documents evidencing the acquisitions or lost/missing deeds of sale and donation, some of the lots occupied by the University remained in the name of the original owners or private individuals. Nevertheless, the University has been in open and continuous possession of these lots for decades. While titles of some of these lands were not yet transferred in the name of the University, these lots, however, are covered by tax declarations in the name of DMMMSU which are prima facie proofs of ownership or possession of the property.



By virtue of BOR Resolution No. 2019-481 dated March 25, 2019, DMMMSU created the Land Acquisition, Transfer and Titling Office (LATTO) under the Office of the Director for Administrative Services, which is the unit in-charge in retrieving/ recovering/ titling/ updating documents pertaining to the University’s landholdings.

 

Based on the report prepared by the Land Acquisition, Transfer and Titling Office (LATTO), the status of the DMMMSU’s landholdings as of December 31, 2020 is presented below:

The above data were based on the actual survey conducted during the year by LATTO on lands actually occupied by DMMMSU. The data do not include the lot occupied by DMMMSU Pig and Extension Farm (DPERF) which has a separate book of accounts. The total area of 1,120 hectares reported in the prior year financial statements of the University were carried over from the previous years as a result of the mergers of former schools which formed DMMMSU including acquisitions by way of deed of sale and/or deed of donation. The discrepancy of 279 hectares noted between the accounting records and the report prepared by LATTO may pertain to unoccupied lands belonging to the former schools over which the University has general administration by virtue of Presidential Decree No. 1778. These lands, by public knowledge, belong to DMMMSU. 



Land Improvement



The increase in the land improvement account represents the cost of the major repair incurred on the improvement and maintenance of the fence surrounding the OUS building in compliance with the COA Audit Observation Memorandum last CY 2019. Its corresponding accumulated depreciation was also recognized in the books of accounts.

23. Budget Information



The approved budget of DMMMSU in the amount of ₱1,271,749,550.78 was sourced from the internally generated income of the University and the subsidy from national government as reflected in the 2020 GAA. The budget for the use of income was prepared in accordance with the provisions set forth in CHED Memorandum Order No. 11, s. 2011 and duly approved by the Board of Regents (BOR) of DMMMSU. Budget authorized by the BOR shall be implemented within the CY for which it was formulated.



The CY 2020 budget for the use of income is prepared on the basis of cash collections. This includes income from tuition fees and other school fees collected from students during the 2nd Semester SY 2019-2020 and 1st Semester SY 2020-2021, collection from CHED under the Free Higher Education Program for the 2nd Semester SY 2019-2020, net income of the Income Generating Projects (IGPs) of DMMMSU for the CY 2019 and unobligated allotment/unutilized budget for the CY 2019.



Changes between the original and final budget in Fund 101 were due to the unreleased appropriations, modification/transfer to/from, DBM’s issuance of additional Special Allotment Release Order for the implementation of the 1st tranche compensation adjustments, RLIP requirement of the 1st tranche compensation adjustments, monetization, discontinuance of appropriated programs, activities or projects (PAPs) pursuant to RA No. 11469, the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act dated March 24, 2020, as implemented by National Budget Circular No. 580 dated April 22, 2020 and the withdrawal of allotment corresponding to the RLIP requirement of the 1st tranche compensation adjustments pursuant to RA No. 11466 for the months of April to December 2020.

Material differences between the actual amounts as against the budget as presented in SCBAA are also noted particularly on the following:



1)	Since the budget for the use of income is prepared on the basis of cash collections, there are income or collections during the year which were not used or programmed as budget due to the late release of funds from CHED – Unifast and the limitation of the BOR members to meet on a regular basis since they only meet once every quarter and allowed to conduct two (2) special meetings.



2)	Difference in the final budget and actual amounts also pertains to unobligated allotment/unutilized budget and unpaid obligations/utilizations. 



24. Restatement of Financial Statements

OBSERVATIONS

RECOMMENDATIONS

OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS





A)	Financial Audit



Understatement of Accounts Payable - ₱60,448,769.35



1)		Non-recognition in the books of Due and Demandable Accounts Payable amounting to ₱60,413,187.93 resulted in the understatement of the Accounts Payable, CIP -Buildings and Other Structures and Other Machinery and Equipment accounts aggregating ₱120,826,375.86, thereby affecting the fairness of the presentation of the Financial Statements. 

	

			Accounts reconciliation is a control process to ensure that the recorded account balances are correct at the end of an accounting period to achieve fair presentation of accounts in the Financial Statements.

	

			Paragraph 27 of IPSAS 1 states:

	

	Financial statements shall present fairly the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for asserts, liabilities, revenue and expenses set out in IPSAS.

	

		Section 2 of Chapter 6 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agency (NGA) Volume I defines Accounts Payable as “valid and legal obligations of NGAs/OUs, for which, goods/services/projects have been delivered/rendered/completed and accepted, regardless of the year when these obligations were incurred.”

	

		Likewise, Note 13.1 of DMMMSU Note to Financial Statements (NFS) provides their accounting policy on the recognition of Accounts Payable which reads:

	

				Accounts Payable is set up at the end of the year for expenses incurred but not yet paid. Only due and demandable Accounts Payable are recorded in the books. These pertain to the goods purchased which have already been delivered or services which have already been rendered.

	

		The Financial Statements of DMMMSU showed that the Accounts Payable had a balance of ₱41,887,238.03 as of December 31, 2020. Review of related financial reports revealed that the Due and Demandable Unpaid Obligations in the Budget and Financial Accountability Reports (BFAR), namely FAR 1 and FAR 1.a totaled ₱60,413,557.25, consisting of ₱369.32 under Personal Services (PS) and ₱60,413,187.93 under Capital Outlay (CO). Only the unpaid obligation under PS was taken in the books of accounts, while those under the CO were not recorded, rendering the Accounts Payable understated by ₱60,413,187.93 and the CIP - Buildings and Other Structures and Other Machinery and Equipment understated by ₱58,440,034.03 and ₱1,973,153.90, respectively.

	

			Analysis of the unrecognized amount is shown below:

Unrecognized Accounts Payable for the year

  60,413,187.93 

	

		Considering the amount of understatement, Management overlooked to reconcile the Accounts Payable recognized in the books as against the disclosed information in the NFS and reported in the BFAR as due and demandable unpaid obligations for CY 2020.

	

		Consequently, the Accounts Payable balance is understated by ₱60,413,187.93 and the corresponding Asset accounts are also understated by the same amount, thereby affecting the fair presentation of the Financial Statements.

	

		We recommended that Management direct the Chief Accountant to draw adjusting entry debiting Construction in Progress-Buildings and Other Structures ₱58,440,034.03 and Other Machinery and Equipment ₱1,973,153.90 and crediting Accounts Payable amounting to ₱60,413,187.93 and henceforth, to prepare Financial Statements in reconciliation with related Financial Reports to present fairly the account balances in the Financial Statements.

	

	

	

	

Non-uniform application of Estimated Useful Life

	

2)		DMMMSU consolidated its Depreciation Expense totaling ₱62,514,845.04 computed based on different estimated useful life of similar items in the PPE, resulting in non-uniform application of accounting policy on the provision of depreciation, which is not in consonance with Paragraph 49 of IPSAS 6, thereby affecting the balances of the Depreciation Expense, Accumulated Depreciation and the affected PPE accounts.

	

				Paragraph 49 of IPSAS 6 provides that:

	

			Consolidated Financial Statements shall be prepared using uniform accounting policies for like transactions and other events in similar circumstances.

				

		Review of the Consolidated Financial Statements of DMMMSU disclosed that Depreciation Expense for CY 2020 totaled ₱62,514,845.04. The NFS disclosed that the estimated useful life for each class of PPE was stated in ranges of number of years, instead of specific number of years. Further review of supporting schedules of accounts revealed that the six operating units/campuses recognized Depreciation Expense but were computed based on different estimated useful life of similar items in the PPE.

	

		Since the different operating units have no uniform estimated useful life for similar items or class of PPE, the computation of depreciation expense was based on difference bases, resulting in non-uniform application of accounting policy on the provision of depreciation, which is not in consonance with Paragraph 49 of IPSAS 6, thereby affecting the balances of the Depreciation Expense, Accumulated Depreciation and the affected PPE accounts.

	

		We recommended that Management direct the Head of the Finance Unit to adopt uniform specific estimated useful life for each class of asset based on experience on the life of its PPE, copy furnished our Office and the Government Accountancy Sector of COA. Thereafter to recompute Depreciation Expense and to effect necessary adjusting entry to present the correct balance of the account as presented in the Financial Statements.

	

Non-recognition of Accounts Receivable - Disallowances/Charges - ₱10,427,441.09



3)	Final and executory disallowances/charges amounting to ₱10,427,441.09 were not recognized in the books of accounts, contrary to Section 46 of the GAM, resulting in the understatement of the account Accounts Receivable – Disallowance/Charges by ₱10,427,441.09, thereby affecting the correctness of the account balance as presented in the Financial Statements.



					Section 46 of the GAM provides that:



Disallowances shall be taken up in the books of accounts only when they become final and executory.



					Review of the Statement of Financial Position of DMMMSU as at December 31, 2020 disclosed that the disallowances which became final and executory based on COA Order of Execution (COE)/COA Decision (CD)/Notice of Finality of Decision (NFD) as of reporting date were not taken up in the books.

Considering the dates when these disallowances became final and executory, it can be deduced that the Accountant overlooked preparing Journal Entry Vouchers (JEV) to set up Accounts Receivable – Disallowances/ Charges. Consequently, the non-recognition of these receivables affects the correctness of the balances of Accounts Receivable and Accumulated Surplus as presented in the Financial Statements:

We recommended that Management direct the Accountant to immediately prepare JEV debiting Accounts Receivable – Disallowances/ Charges and crediting Accumulated Surplus in order to present the correct balances of the affected accounts in the Financial Statements. Henceforth, the Accountant to timely recognize in the books disallowances that have become final and executory.



		Management committed to recognize in the books the above-listed disallowances which have become final and executory, except COE for the ND Nos. 18-001-101-(16) and 18-003-101-(16) which are the subject of a Request for Suspension of Enforcement pending resolution of their Petition for Review filed before the COA Commission Proper (CP) involving the same issue. Thus, it was agreed upon that full disclosure should be made in the NFS.

	

Unrecorded Bank Credit Memoranda - ₱4,700,428.04



4)			Bank Credit Memoranda totaling ₱4,700,428.04 remained unrecognized in the books as of December 31, 2020, which was not in conformity with Section 6 of Chapter 21 of GAM, thereby understating the Cash in Bank balance in the Financial Statement by the same amount.

			

					Section 6 of GAM provides that:

			

The Chief Accountant/Designated Staff shall prepare a JEV to recognize all reconciling items that require adjustment and correction in the books of accounts. 

				

				Review of Bank Reconciliation Statements of DMMMSU as of December 31, 2020 revealed, that Bank Credit Memoranda totaling ₱4,700,428.04 remained unrecognized in the books as of December 31, 2020. Details are shown as follows:

				Inquiry from Finance Office disclosed that these are direct deposits made during the year to the respective bank accounts of Campuses and Operating Units by still unknown payors. The Accountants, as mandated by the GAM is required to recognize all reconciling items to correct the balances in the books of accounts. Disclosures on the status of the said direct deposits should have been made in the NFS. 

	

				Consequently, the non-recognition of these bank credit memoranda understated the Cash in Bank balance of DMMMSU as of December 31, 2020 by ₱4,700,428.04, thereby affecting the fairness of the presentation of the bank balance in the Financial Statements.

	

				We recommended that Management direct the DMMMSU Accountants to prepare a JEV debiting Cash in Bank and crediting Other Payables for ₱4,700,428.04 to present the correct Cash in Bank balance in the Financial Statements.

	

				Management acknowledged the observation and committed to implement the recommendation.



Doubtful reliability of Land account – ₱1,198,940,087.29



5)	The reliability of the Land account totaling ₱1,198,940,087.29 could not be ascertained due to unreconciled variance of ₱545,827,767.54 between the records of Accounting and Property Office and in land area ranging from 141.7869 to 472.9039 hectares between the records of Accounting, Property and Land Acquisition, Transfer and Titling Offices, thereby affecting the reliability of the Land account balance as presented in the University’s Financial Statements. 

	

The Revised Chart of Accounts (RCA) for NGA contained in the GAM, Volume III describes the Land account as “that is used to record the cost incurred in the purchase or fair value if acquired through donation or transfers without cost of land. Credit this account for disposal or reclassification to Investment Property”.

	

				Review of Financial Statements showed that the Land account has a balance of ₱1,198,940,087.29 as at December 31, 2020. Inquiry from the Chief Accountant disclosed that the general ledger balance of the Land account comprised of 1,120 hectares. Likewise, the website of the University narrated that “the University is sprawled on 1,120 hectares”. As observed in previous years, this land area did not reconcile with the 1,261.7869 hectares as reported in the Inventory List of Landholdings prepared by the Property Office, yielding a difference of 141.7869 hectares. 

	

				As such, in response to audit recommendation to adopt strategies in retrieving/recovering/transferring/titling/updating documents in order to establish the reliability of the total landholdings of the University, the Land Acquisition, Transfer and Titling Office (LATTO) was created by virtue of BOR Resolution No. 2019-481 dated March 25, 2019. 

	

				Based on the report of LATTO, the status of landholdings of the University as of December 31, 2020 showed the following details:

				As can be gleaned from the foregoing, the discrepancies are now:

			

	

	Amount (₱)

	Land Area (hectares)

	Accounting vis-à-vis Property

	545,827,767.54

	141.7869

	LATTO vis-à-vis Accounting

	

	331.1170 

	LATTO vis-à-vis Property

	

	472.9039

			

				Management disclosed in the NFS that the discrepancies may pertain to unoccupied lands to which by public knowledge belong to DMMMSU but has no legal documents to support claim of ownership.

	

				Based on the foregoing, the presence of the still unreconciled variances in land area cast doubt on the reliability of the Land account balance as presented in the Financial Statements.

	

					We recommended that Management direct:

	

a)			The Head of the LATTO to spearhead the conduct of actual survey and investigation on the details of the unoccupied lands to which DMMMSU has no legal documents but publicly known to have been owned by the University and thereafter institute legal proceedings to obtain legal documents, and

		

b)			The custodian of related legal documents to furnish COA Office of copies of Land Titles and Tax Declarations available to support accuracy and correctness of the details as reported by LATTO. 

		 

Management disclosed that the 1,120 hectares provided in prior years as the total land holdings of the University was just a mere estimate by previous University Administrators which was carried forward over the years. Nevertheless, Management committed to continue exerting efforts to accomplish the recommendations further.



The Audit Team recognized the efforts of Management in addressing the observation and its compliance with the audit recommendation. However, with the given information that the 1,120 hectares landholdings was just an estimate, hence, cannot be a reliable reference. As such, it is therefore appropriate to determine the land value of the land area as identified by LATTO to ascertain if it reconciles with the recognized land value in the books of accounts. Thereafter, the Chief Accountant and the Property Custodian to update their respective records.



Overstatement of Construction in Progress account – Undetermined Amount

		

6)	Completed projects were not reclassified from CIP - Buildings and Other Structures account to the proper asset accounts, which was not in consonance with Section 8 (g) of Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGA, Volume I, rendering the CIP overstated and Buildings and Other Structures accounts understated by ₱247,225,921.59.



					Section 8 (g) of Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGA, Volume I provides:

	

	During the construction period, all expenses incurred in relation to the construction of the PPE shall be taken up in the books as Construction in Progress (CIP) with appropriate asset classification. As soon as the construction is completed, the “Construction in Progress” account shall be reclassified to the proper asset account. 

	

					Review of the Consolidated Financial Statements showed that the CIP - Buildings and Other Structures account has a balance of ₱407,778,496.26 as at December 31, 2020. Review of the Reports on Government Projects/Programs/Activities (GPAP) for the 4th Quarter of CY 2020 prepared by the University Planning Officer revealed that unfinished projects totaled ₱128,728,945.67. Comparison of figures between the two Offices showed a discrepancy of ₱279,049,550.59, broken down as follows:

	128,728,945.67

	279,049,550.59

	

				Inquiry from the Accounting Office disclosed that the discrepancies were due to completed projects not yet reclassified to their proper asset accounts. Additionally, it also include projects initially funded by the CA which were later completed using funds of the different campuses. The cost of the projects initially funded by CA were not yet transferred to respective campuses, and thus remained in the books of CA under CIP account. 

		

				The non-reclassification of completed projects caused by the lack of monitoring by the Accounting Office, rendered the balance of the CIP - Buildings and Other Structures account overstated, and Buildings and Other Structures accounts understated by ₱247,225,921.59. Likewise, the corresponding Depreciation Expense were not recognized in the books thereby affecting the correctness of the recognized Depreciation Expense for CY 2020.

		

				We recommended that Management direct:

		

	a)			The Campus Accountants for the immediate reclassification of completed projects to proper asset accounts and to recognize the corresponding Depreciation Expense;

		

	b)			Henceforth, the Campus Accountants to timely reclassify completed projects to proper asset accounts since they process the last and final billing of infrastructure projects

		 

						Management acknowledged the observation and committed to implement the foregoing recommendations.



Misclassification of Other Structures account – ₱1,183,827.99



7)	A two - storey structure with a cost of ₱1,183,827.99 is recognized under Other Structures account instead of Investment Property account, which is not in conformity with Section 2, Chapter 9 of the GAM for NGA, thereby affecting the correctness of the balances of Other Structures and Investment Property accounts as presented in the Financial Statements.



Section 2, Chapter 9 of the GAM for NGA, Volume I defines Investment Property as:



Property (land or a building – or part of a building – or both) held to earn rentals or for capital appreciation, or both. It is not held for use in the production of goods or services, for administration purposes, or sale in the ordinary course of business.



Review of the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) as of December 31, 2020 showed one Income Generating Project (IGP) building classified as Other Structures under Fund 164 and Fund 184. Details are shown below:



Particulars

Amount (₱)

IGP Building, Fund 164, Phase I

706,563.50

IGP Building, Fund 184, Completion

477,264.49

   Total

1,183,827.99



Records showed that the IGP Building was constructed to generate income from rental of commercial stalls built-in in the said building. Ocular inspection disclosed that these commercial stalls were currently leased out to private individuals conducting business activities within the Campus. As such, the IGP Building falls within the definition of Investment Property as this was constructed and being utilized for rental income generation purposes.



Therefore, taking up the IGP Building as Other Structures is erroneous, thus, resulting in the understatement of the Investment Property account and overstatement of Other Structures account by ₱1,183,827.99.

	

We recommended that Management:



				a)	Direct the Accountant to immediately reclassify the IGP Building costing ₱1,183,827.99 by debiting Investment Property and crediting Other Structures to present the correct classification of the IGP building in the Financial Statements, and



				b)	Require the Property Custodian and the Accountant to review the composition of the Other Structures account and determine if there are still properties (land or a building – or part of a building – or both) held by the Campus to earn rentals or for capital appreciation. Thereafter, the Accountant to reclassify to Investment Property, if there is any.



Management heeded our audit recommendation and committed to reclassify the IGP Building to Investment Property account and to further review the composition of the Other Structures account to be able to effect the necessary adjusting entries, if any.



Unsupported Biological Assets balance of ₱568,763.33



8)	Biological Assets with historical value aggregating ₱568,763.33 were not supported by records, casting doubt on the reliability of the account balance as presented in the Financial Statements.



The RCA for NGA prescribed under COA Circular No. 2013-002 dated January 30, 2013, describes the account Breeding Stocks as follows:



This account is used to record the cost or fair value, if acquired through donation or transfers without cost, of breeding stocks such as carabao, horse, swine and the like. Credit this account for sale, transfers, loss or death.



Review of the Biological Assets account of SLUC and CA as of December 31, 2020 disclosed that the balance of ₱568,763.33 remained unchanged for the past the two years. Validation of the composition of the account showed that records such as Biological Assets Property Card, Quarterly Reports on Biological Assets and Report on Physical Count to support the balance were still not made available. Further, no inventory taking was conducted in view of the non-identification of what the biological assets are, hence, the reliability of the presented balance of Breeding Stocks in the Financial Statements was doubtful.



This is a reiteration of an observation contained in 2018 DMMMSU Annual Audit Report (AAR) which recommendation remained unimplemented as of December 31, 2020. Inquiry from Management disclosed that documents to support the reported balance were not available at their end, hence, the difficulty to comply with the given recommendation.



We recommended that Management direct the Accountant to trace back the recognition entry made in the books to at least recall from its explanation notes what these biological assets are and where they came from and after knowing the details of the recognition entry, to coordinate with former project managers/leaders who may have handled the biological assets, ascertain the events that transpired after recognition and secure related documents to cast away doubt on the reliability of the Biological Assets account balance as presented in the Financial Statements. 



Negative balances in the composition of Accounts Receivable– ₱86,804.40.00



9)	Negative balances of 195 accounts aggregating ₱86,804.40 were included in the Accounts Receivable of NLUC and SLUC under Fund 161, which was not in accordance with the account’s normal balance as stated in the RCA for NGA, resulting in the misstatement of the Account Receivable and Income accounts by the same amount.



The RCA for NGA prescribed under COA Circular No. 2013-002 dated January 30, 2013, describes the account Accounts Receivable as “an account used to record the amount due from customers arising from regular trade and business transactions. Credit this account upon collection of receivables, transfers or write-off”.



Review of the composition of Accounts Receivable account disclosed that negative balances of 195 accounts aggregating ₱86,804.40 were included in the Accounts Receivable of DMMMSU NLUC and SLUC under Fund 161. 



Sound accounting practice dictates that the normal balances of asset and expense accounts should be debit, and liability and income accounts should be credit.



The presence of negative balances in the subsidiary ledgers is attributed to lack of proper monitoring of receivables due from personnel-debtors which are collected thru salary deductions. Further, as explained by NLUC and SLUC Accountants, there are instances when charge invoices are cancelled but subsequently collected and reported by Business Affairs Office (BAO) as collections from credit sales, thus, the negative balances in the Accounts Receivable account, resulting in the misstatement of the balance amounting to ₱86,804.40 and in the related Income account as well.



This is a reiterated observation contained in the AAR of DMMMSU for CY 2019 (page 44). Management already made adjustments during the year 2020, however, review of the Schedule of Accounts Receivable as of December 31, 2020 showed, that NLUC and SLUC had still negative balances in their respective accounts. 



We recommended that Management to direct:



							a)	The Accountant to take up JEV debiting Accounts Receivable and crediting the related Income Account for ₱86,804.40, and



							b)	The Head of BAO and the Accountant to implement monitoring of receivables due from personnel-debtors that are collected as salary deductions to properly deduct what is only due from personnel-debtors. 



NLUC and SLUC Accountants committed to immediately effect the necessary adjusting entry to reflect the correct balance of Accounts Receivable account and related Income account balances.



B)	Compliance Audit



Delayed or Non-submission of DV - ₱31,492,500.44



10)		Disbursement Vouchers and related supporting documents of paid expenditures recorded in the books of accounts of DMMMSU for CY 2020 amounting to ₱31,492,500.44, were not submitted to COA Office for audit contrary to Section 4(6) of PD 1445 and COA Circular 95-006 dated May 18, 1995, precluding the prompt audit of financial transactions, thus, casting doubt on the reliability of the affected account balances in the Financial Statements.



Section 4 (6) of PD No. 1445 provides that:



Claims against government funds shall be supported with complete documentation.  



Likewise, paragraph 6 of COA Circular No. 95-006 states that:



The responsibility of officials involved in the daily recording of transactions in the books of accounts is to turn-over the disbursement reports with all paid vouchers and documents evidencing the transactions, to the Auditor within ten (10) days from the date of receipt of said documents.



Review of disbursements recorded in Check Disbursement Journals (ChkDJ) and Advice to Debit Account Disbursement Journals (ADADJ) of DMMMSU for CY 2020 disclosed that various DVs amounting to ₱31,492,500.44 were not submitted to COA Unit for audit. The delayed or non-submission of the DV as listed in Annex A and the related supporting documents precluded the prompt audit of the accounts and consequently, cast doubt on the reliability of the balances of the accounts to where these transactions were recorded.



				We recommend that Management direct the Accountants to submit the listed DV in the attached Annex A to facilitate the complete review of the recorded disbursements to cast away doubt on the reliability of balances of the affected accounts presented in the Financial Statements for CY 2020.



Non-disposal of Assets recorded in “Other Asset” account – ₱10,899,106.77



11)		Unserviceable/obsolete PPE totaling ₱10,899,106.77, which were lodged under Other Assets account, were not disposed of as at December 31, 2020, contrary to Section 79 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445, exposing them to further deterioration and depriving the agency of chances of recovery/additional income from the immediate sale thereof.

		

						Section 79 of PD No. 1445 provides that:

			

	When government property has become unserviceable for any cause, or is no longer needed, it shall, upon application of the officer accountable therefore, be inspected by the head of the agency or his duly authorized representative in the presence of the auditor concerned and, if found to be valueless or unsalable, it may be destroyed in their presence. If found to be valuable, it may be sold at public auction to the highest bidder under the supervision of the proper committee on award or similar body in the presence of the auditor concerned or other duly authorized representative of the Commission, after advertising by printed notice in the Official Gazette, or for not less than three consecutive days in any newspaper of general circulation, or where the value of the property does not warrant the expense of publication, by notices posted for a like period in at least three public places in the locality where the property is to be sold. 

			

				Section 42 (h) Chapter 10 of the GAM, Volume I requires the use of Inventory and Inspection Report for Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) to account for all unserviceable properties of an entity which are subject to disposal. It also serves as the basis in derecognizing the unserviceable properties carried in the PPE accounts.

	

				Review of the Consolidated Financial Statements revealed that the account Other Assets was used to reclassify PPE which were already carried in the books at their salvage value or which had been fully depreciated. The account had a consolidated balance of ₱10,899,106.77, broken down as follows:

	

	Campus/Operating Unit

	Other Assets

	Sericulture Research and Development Institute

	3,399,942.95

	South La Union Campus

	3,121,899.22

	North La Union Campus

	3,065,371.07

	Central Administration

	1,066,040.95

	Open University System

	135,202.45

	Mid-La union Campus

	110,650.13

	   Total

	10,899,106.77

	

				The following observations were noted during ocular inspection conducted by the Audit Team:

	

--		Unserviceable PPE were not properly stored, some were left exposed to the elements, while some remained in buildings where these were previously used, using up space;

--		No proper segregation of PPE;

--		PPE were not labeled, causing difficulty in identifying PPE during inspection, and

--		Scrap materials from demolished buildings/structures were just piled up on the surroundings.



						The inability of the University to undertake proper disposition of its unserviceable and fully depreciated/obsolete assets, exposed such to further deterioration, entailed additional storage space for some, and deprived the University of chances of recovery and additional income from immediate sale, thereof.

		

						We recommended that Management direct:

		

	a)		The Property/Supply Officers to prepare the IIRUP, label and properly segregate the PPE for easy identification during inspection, and

	

	b)		The Disposal Committee to facilitate the immediate and systematic disposal of all unserviceable property in accordance with Section 79 of PD No. 1445, in order not to deprive the University from better chances of recovery/additional income from the immediate sale, thereof.



				Management acknowledged the observation and committed to implement the foregoing recommendations.

	

Overpayments of Salary and Year-End Bonus Differentials to Faculty Members



12)		Salary and YEB (Year-End Bonus) differentials were granted to DMMMSU MLUC, SLUC and OUS faculty members, who were promoted through the implementation of National Budget Circular (NBC) No. 461 effective July 1, 2019 whose actual assumption to duties were dated December 23, 2019, which were not in conformity with Section 23 of 2017 Omnibus Rules on Appointment and Other Human Resource Actions (ORAOHRA), resulting in the overpayments of Salary and YEB differentials amounting to ₱8,969,927.47 and ₱1,242,394.00, respectively.

			

					Section 23 of the 2017 ORAOHRA provides that:

			

					The date of the actual assumption of duties of appointees, as indicated in the Certification of Assumption to Duty (CS Form No. 4, Series of 2017) shall be the basis for the payment of his/her salary and determination of service rendered in the government.

			

					Records showed, that DMMMSU MLUC, SLUC and OUS faculty members whose ranks were upgraded under the NBC No. 461 assumed duties in their upgraded positions on December 23, 2019 as indicated in their duly filled up CS Form No. 4, Series of 2017. However, post audit on the transactions of DMMMSU disclosed that those promoted faculty members were paid Salary and YEB differentials covering the period July 1, 2019 - December 22, 2019, which is not in accordance with the above-cited provision of the 2017 ORAOHRA.

			

					Management explained, that the payments were based on the issuance of Civil Service Commission (CSC) on the Clarification on the Effectivity Date of Appointments in State Universities and Colleges (SUC) based on the Implementation of NBC No. 461, CSC Resolution No. 2000052 dated January 21, 2020 which provides that “the Commission RESOLVES that the actual date of issuance of appointments shall be indicated below the signature of the appointing officer/authority in the appointment form, but the effectivity of reclassification to faculty positions in the SUC shall be on July 1, 2019 based on the implementation of NBC No. 461 pursuant to the Special Provision of the Miscellaneous Personnel Benefits Fund in R.A. No. 10924.”  Thus, they effected the rates of those newly promoted faculty members effective July 1, 2019.

			

					It must be emphasized, that what was resolved in the CSC Resolution No. 2000052 was the effectivity date of the appointments issued under the NBC No. 461 but the same is not the basis for the payment of their salaries. Section 23 of the 2017 ORAOHRA clearly provides that the date of actual assumption of duties of appointees, as indicated in the Certification of Assumption to Duty (CS Form No. 4, Series of 2017) shall be the basis for the payment of his/her salary and not the effectivity date of the appointments. Thus, their salary differentials should only cover December 23, 2019 onwards and that they are not entitled to YEB differential.

			

					Consequently, DMMMSU incurred overpayments of Salary and YEB differentials detailed as follows:



Campus/Operating Unit

Salary Differential

(₱)

YEB Differential

(₱)

Mid La Union Campus

5,294,203.88

 1,242,394.00

South La Union Campus

3,289,233.77

786,709.00

Open University System

386,489.82

87,625.00

TOTALS

8,969,927.47

2,116,728.00

 

					We recommended that Management:

	

a)		Direct the Accountant to cause the refund of the overpayments of salary and YEB differential amounting to ₱8,969,927.47 and ₱1,242,394.00, respectively, and 	

		

b)		Henceforth, pay salary and YEB differential based on the actual date of assumption to duty of appointees in strict adherence to Section 23 of 2017 ORAOHRA.

	

Management explained, that the CSC Resolution No. 2000052 which declared that the effectivity of reclassification to faculty positions in the SUC shall be on July 1, 2019, was only issued after the HRMO of MLUC, SLUC and OUS had already submitted to CSC the appointments of promoted faculty members including its supporting documents. Thus, they were not able to change the Assumption to Duty (CS Form No. 4, Series of 2017) dated December 23, 2019 to July 1, 2019, to conform with the CSC Resolution.



The Audit Team took note of the given explanation, however, the provision of ORAOHRA clearly states that the Certification of Assumption to Duty (CS Form No. 4, Series of 2017) shall be the basis for the payment of salary. We reiterate that the CSC Resolution speaks of effectivity date of the appointment, but, not the basis for the payment of salaries.









Effecting Reclassification of Position of Retired Faculty Members



13)		Three personnel who have retired from government service were issued appointments prior to the approval of the Notice of Organization, Staffing and Compensation Action (NOSCA) effecting reclassification of their positions based on NBC No. 461, which was not in accordance with DBM Budget Circular (BC) No. 2018-3 and Section 7.a.2 of 2017 ORAOHRA, resulting in illegal payment of their Salary and YEB differentials amounting to ₱181,609.00 and 41,460.30, respectively.  

			

					The following criteria provide:

			

						CSC 2017 ORAOHRA - “the position title indicated in the appointment shall conform to the approved Plantilla of Personnel…

			

				DBM BC 2018-3 - “reclassification of positions shall apply only to filled regular positions in the national government…”, and

				

						Post audit of disbursements on the implementation of NBC No. 461 revealed, that three DMMMSU SLUC personnel who retired sometime in July, September and November 2019 were paid Salary and Year-End Differentials for the period July 1, 2019 to date of retirement. Further review of supporting documents showed, that their appointments were dated July 1, 2019, while the NOSCA effecting the reclassification of their positions pursuant to NBC No. 461 was approved only on December 23, 2019.

		

						Under the CSC 2017 ORAOHRA, the positions to be indicated in the appointment shall conform to the approved Plantilla of Personnel. In the case of the three retired personnel, their positions as indicated in their appointments dated July 1, 2019 did not actually exist on the said date since the NOSCA were reclassified approved only on December 23, 2019. 

		

						Moreover, DBM BC 2018-3 explicitly provides that reclassification of positions shall apply only to filled regular positions in the national government. As such, the reclassification of the positions of these retired DMMMSU SLUC personnel does not stand on a legal ground, since their positions were already vacant at the time of the approval of the reclassification on December 23, 2019. 

		

						Since the payment of their Salary and YEB differentials was without legal basis, such is considered illegal disbursement of public funds.

		

						We recommended that Management direct the Accountant to cause the refund of Salary and YEB differentials illegally paid to the three DMMMSU SLUC retirees. 

								SLUC HRMO explained that she was directed by the University HRMO to prepare the appointments of the faculty members who were already retired from the service on the basis of CSC Resolution No. 2000054 which provides that the effectivity date of the appointments was July 1, 2019, when the retirees were still in service.

		

						The Audit Team stands firm with the audit observation and recommendation.

	

	Non-determination of Eligibility of Prospective Bidders

	

14)			The Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) failed to determine the eligibility of prospective suppliers in the procurement of COVID-related supplies totaling P641,070.20 such that the Requests for Quotation (RFQ) were sent to suppliers without known qualification contrary to Section 12 and Item (8) of Annex “H” of 2016 Implementing Rules and Regulations of Republic Act No. 9184 (2016 IRR of RA No. 9184), resulting in irregular expenditures. 

	

					Section 12 of 2016 IRR of RA No. 9184 provides the functions of the BAC which read as follows:

	

		[T]he BAC shall have the following functions: (a) advertise and/or post the invitation to bid/request for expressions of interest; (b) conduct pre-procurement and pre-bid conferences; (c) determine the eligibility of prospective bidders; (d) receive and open bids; (e) conduct the evaluation of bids…

	

		Likewise, Item (8) of Annex “H” of the same law provides that:

	

		The BAC shall prepare and send the RFQs/RFPs to at least three (3) suppliers, contractors or consultants of known qualifications.

	

			Records showed that DOUS and MLUC resorted to Alternative Modes in

	the procurement of COVID-related supplies particularly Small Value Procurement under Section 53 and Item (8) of Annex “H” of the 2016 IRR of RA No. 9184. 

	

				Post audit of disbursements particularly procurement from Dashcam North Inc. (DNI) revealed that the other suppliers to whom RFQ were sent, were found to be without known qualification. These suppliers are: Pearl Power Wash (PPW), a laundry shop, John Jaeson Velasco (JJV) and Maricel and Sophia Store (MSS) located at Makati City.

	

				It is worth mentioning that in ten transactions made by MLUC with DNI, PPW and MSS were the same suppliers to which the other RFQ were served. 

	

				Inquiry from DOUS Management disclosed that JJV was a reseller of DNI when the RFQ was served in April, 2020. In a notarized affidavit executed by the owner of DNI, JJV was eventually hired by DNI in June, 2020.  However, audit of procurement by MLUC with the same supplier revealed that JJV signed in several RFQ representing PPW on various dates from March 11, 2020 to July21, 2020, contradicting the claims of DNI that JJV was her reseller and became her employee in April, 2020 and June, 2020, respectively. Documents showed that in April, 2020, JJV was a reseller of DNI at the same time, represented PPW and in June, 2020, he represented PPW at the same time, an employee of DNI. 

	

				Based from the foregoing facts, it can be deduced that the three suppliers, namely DNI, PPW and JJV, were related with each other. The transactions were made to appear of having obtained quotations from three suppliers to create the appearance of competition but the existence of relationship among the three suppliers made the regularity of the transactions doubtful.

	

				Under the Revised IRR of RA No. 9184, the BAC is required to evaluate the legal and technical qualifications of suppliers to adhere with Item (8) of Annex “H” of 2016 IRR of RA No. 9184 in obtaining at least three quotations from suppliers with known qualifications. Considering the number of transactions involved, it can be concluded that the BAC failed to evaluate the legal and technical qualifications of prospective suppliers which resulted in having the appearance of competition but did not exist. 

	

				It is worthy to mention that under Item (b) of Section 65.2 of 2016 IRR of the Revised RA No. 9184, the act of maliciously submitting different bids through two or more persons, corporations, partnerships or any other business entity in which the supplier has interest, to create the appearance of competition that does not in fact exist so as to be adjudged as the winning bidder is a penal offense that may be committed by private individuals, and public officers may be conspirators.

	

				Consequently, the series of procurement made by DMMMSU from DNI amounting to ₱641,070.20, which were done not in accordance with IRR of RA No. 9184, could be considered irregular transactions.

	

		We recommended that Management direct:

	

a)			The DMMMSU Legal Officer to investigate all procurement involving DNI and determine the commission of any acts prohibited and sanctioned under the Revised IRR of RA 9184 and report any findings to Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB), if warranted, and

		

b)			Henceforth, the BAC to strictly evaluate legal and technical qualifications of suppliers to adhere with Item (8) of Annex “H” of 2016 IRR of RA No. 9184 in obtaining at least three quotations from suppliers with known qualifications.

	

Conduct of Meeting cum Workshop Out of Town - ₱143,000.00



15)		DMMMSU incurred ₱143,000.00 in its Post Evaluation Meeting cum Workshop conducted out of town, contrary to Section 2 of PD No. 1445, resulting in extravagant expenditure as defined under COA Circular No. 2012-003.



			Section 2 of PD No. 1445 provides that:

			

					It is the declared policy of the State that all resources of the government shall be managed, expended or utilized in accordance with law and regulations, and safeguarded against loss or wastage through illegal or improper disposition, with a view to ensuring efficiency, economy and effectiveness in the operations of government. The responsibility to take care that such policy is faithfully adhered to rests directly with the chief or head of the government agency concerned.

			

				Item 6.0 of COA Circular No. 2012-003 provides the definition of extravagant expenditure as follows:

	

	The term “extravagant expenditure” signifies those incurred without restraint, judiciousness and economy. Extravagant exceeds the bounds of propriety. These expenditures are immoderate, prodigal, lavish, luxurious, grossly excessive and injudicious. 

	

			Likewise, Annex “E” of the same Circular enumerates cases that are considered extravagant which include the conduct of out of town meeting which can be made within the office premises.

	

		Post audit of the liquidation report on the cash advance granted amounting to ₱143,000.00 disclosed that it was used to defray traveling expenses in the conduct of Post Evaluation Meeting cum Workshop at Gratchi’s Getaway, Tagaytay, Cavite on November 27-29, 2019 attended by 23 DMMMSU personnel. The traveling expense as liquidated includes the following:

				

	Particulars

	Amount

	Per Diems for 3 days, 23 pax 3,300.00/pax

	126,500.00

	Training Venue

	16,500.00

	TOTAL

	143,000.00

					Inquiry from Management disclosed, that conducting the event away from DMMMSU partakes the nature of a reward for their gratuitous services rendered to the project in lieu of the honoraria which under existing government rules and regulations may be granted to government personnel rendering services to a special project. Further, it is Management way of providing the attendees a more relaxed atmosphere away from their traditional work environment and to increase their focus on the objectives of the post evaluation activity. 

	

				The Audit Team took note of the Management’s justifications and recognized that conducting a post evaluation is an important quality measure in determining the efficiency and effectiveness of DMMMSU as an implementing agency. However, as expressly categorized under COA Circular No. 2012-003, conducting a post evaluation meeting cum workshop out of town when it can be done within office premises is considered extravagant, considering that DMMMSU has facilities that could appropriately cater to the event. Conducting the meeting cum workshop out of town resulted in the incurrence of ₱143,000.00, which is considered as extravagant expenditure under COA Circular No. 2012-003.

	

				We recommended that Management refrain from conducting meetings/workshops out of town where the venue does not substantially affect the objectives of the activity to be undertaken and to patronize, maximize use of and enjoy the facilities and amenities of the University, thus avoiding incurrence of extravagant expenditures.

	

				Management acknowledged the observation and committed to implement the foregoing recommendations.



Payment of Hazard Pay to personnel not authorized to report for work - ₱668,500.00



16)			DMMMSU SLUC, NLUC and OUS paid ₱668,500.00 COVID - 19 Hazard Pay to personnel who were not authorized by DMMMSU President to physically report during the period of Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ), contrary to Item 4.3 of DBM BC No. 2020-01, resulting in irregular expenditures.

		

						Item 4 of DBM BC No. 2020-01 provides the Guidelines and Conditions in the grant of COVID-19 Hazard Pay and 4.3 of the said Item requires that:

			

			The personnel/workers have been authorized to physically report for work at their respective offices or work stations on the prescribed official working hours by the head of agency/office during the period of implementation of Enhanced Community Quarantine measures in the area of such office or work station.

			

						Post audit of disbursements of DMMMSU SLUC, NLUC and OUS disclosed, that there were personnel who were paid COVID-19 Hazard Pay, but, were not included in the official list of personnel approved by the University President to physically report during the period of ECQ. This was a clear violation of the DBM BC No. 2020-001 which provides that government agencies may grant COVID-19 Hazard Pay provided, among others, that the personnel/worker should have been authorized to physically report during the period of ECQ by the Head of Agency. The number of personnel not authorized to report physically during the ECQ are as follows:

			

			Campus/

			Operating Unit

			No. of Personnel

			Period Covered

			Hazard Pay

			(₱)

			NLUC

			51

			March 17 – April 15, 2020

			145,000.00

			

			32

			April 16-30, 2020

			382,000.00

			SLUC

			14

			March 17 – April 30, 2020

			127,000.00

			OUS

			1

			March 17 – April 30, 2020

			14,500.00

			TOTAL

			

			

			668,500.00

			

						Considering the number of personnel who were paid Hazard Pay sans authority to physically report for work during the ECQ, it can be deduced that the Finance Unit overlooked the guidelines set forth in DBM BC No. 2020-1 in the payment of COVID-19 Hazard Pay. Consequently, the payment of Hazard Pay amounting to ₱668,500.00, being not in adherence to DBM BC No. 2020-1, were considered irregular expenditures covered under COA Circular 2012-003. 

			

						We recommended that Management direct the Finance Unit to cause the refund of Hazard Pay paid to personnel not authorized to physically report for work during the ECQ      

			                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        

		Requests for time extensions not supported with written consent of bondsmen

	

17)		Requests for extension of contract time for 19 projects with contract amount totaling ₱136,203,377.24 were not supported with written consent of bondsmen for the corresponding extension of the validity of performance security, contrary to Item 10.5, Annex E of the IRR of RA No. 9184, increasing the risk that the Procuring Entity may not have any legal recourse in case of defaulting contractors.



				Item 10.5, Annex E of the IRR of RA No. 9184 otherwise known as the Government Procurement Reform Act provides, among others, that “the written consent of bondsmen must be attached to any request for extension of contract time and submitted to the procuring entity for consideration and the validity of the performance security shall be correspondingly extended.”



The review of the Report on GPAPs as of December 31, 2020 showed that 19 infrastructure projects with contract amount totaling ₱136,203,377.24 were granted time extensions. It was noted that the required corresponding written consent of bondsmen to these time extensions were still not submitted. 



This is a reiterated observation contained in the AAR of DMMMSU for CY 2018 (page 51). The Agency Action Plan and Status of Implementation as of June 30, 2020 of DMMMSU showed their commitment to furnish the COA Office copies of written bondsmen consent. However, verification of projects with extended contract time revealed the absence of written bondsmen consent to these contract time extensions. 



It is worth to emphasize, that these were the instances where the covering surety bonds expired ahead of the revised completion dates. Thus, considering that the performance security is required to guarantee the faithful performance of the winning bidders of their obligations under the contract, the validity of the extension is a crucial protection in the event of contractor’s default. Failure to ensure validity of the security bonds during the extended contract time increases the risk that the Procuring Entity may not have any legal recourse in case of contractor’s default. 



We recommended that Management direct the BAC to submit copies of written bondsmen consent to the extension of contract time granted to 19 projects, and henceforth, to attach copies of bondsmen consent in the Quarterly Report on GPAPs in support to reported projects with time extensions to effectively monitor compliance with the requirement.



	

C)		 Other Areas

	

		Gender and Development

	

18)			The reported Gender and Development (GAD) accomplishments with corresponding actual cost totaling ₱21,883,474.00 or 50.11% of the allocated budget could not be validated due to the non-submission of details of expenditures, casting doubt on the reliability of the reported attribution costs and actual impact of the GAD activities in addressing gender issues.

				

		Section 11.1 of the Philippine Commission on Women-National Economic and Development Authority-Department of Budget and Management Joint Circular No. 2012-01 states:

	

Pursuant to Section 36 of the MCW, the Commission on Audit (COA) shall conduct an annual audit on the use of GAD budget for the purpose of determining its judicious use and the efficiency and effectiveness of interventions in addressing gender issues towards the realization of the objectives of the country’s commitments, plans, and policies on women’s empowerment, gender equality and GAD.	

	

		Review of the Annual GAD Accomplishment Report for Fiscal Year 2020 revealed that out of the total budget of ₱43,670,000.00, only ₱21,883,474.00 or 50.11% were utilized. Out of the 23 planned activities, only four were fully accomplished, 16 were partially conducted while three were not done. However, validation of the reported accomplishments and the corresponding attributed costs could not be conducted due to the non-submission of the details of expenditures per campus/operating unit. 

	

		The following observations were noted in the further review of the submitted Annual GAD Accomplishment Report:

	

1)		Some of the reported accomplished activities and attributed costs seemed incongruent with the actual result/output as follows:

	

	GAD Activity

	Actual Result

	Actual Cost (₱)

	Remarks

	Conduct capacity training on genderizing the curriculum in academic units of the University

	100 administration, faculty and staff attended relevant ISO face to face meetings with inclusion of Gender integration to the curriculum and other processes -10 ISO meetings conducted

	3,867,000.00

	Concerns of ISO meetings were for Management Quality Systems which consisted of processes/procedures and not related with capacity training on genderizing the curriculum in academic units

	Establishment and furnishing of Nursing/Lactating Rooms

	10 improvised lactating rooms established

	200,000.00

	Inspection of the improvised lactating rooms costing ₱20,000.00 each cannot be done due to absence of data on their locations.

	Produce research and survey activities as well as conduct of GAD research-based extension activities

	28 GAD-related research activities made by concerned operating units

	3,000,000.00

	Verification of the 28 GAD-related research activities cannot be done due to absence of List of research activities related to GAD

	To establish GAD Corner or Information Areas and Violence Against Women (VAW) Desk 

	6 GAD corners established and maintained and 6 VAW desks operationalized

	950,000.00

	Inspection of the 6 established bulletin boards that serve as GAD corner and 6 VAW desks costing ₱79,000.00 each cannot be done due to absence of data on their locations.

	Purchase of additional materials related to GAD to be prominently displayed in the libraries of operating units

	3500 IEC materials purchased and distributed

	200,000.00

	Inspection of the 3500 IEC materials purchased and distributed costing ₱200,000.00 cannot be done due to absence of IEC specifics.

	Observation of the Women’s Month 

	3500 IEC materials were reproduced

	200,000.00

	Cost of reproduction is the same with cost of purchase.

	

2)		The following activities were noted of having attributed training costs of ₱4,371.00 for each participant, but the accuracy of which was not validated due to absence of data:

	

--		Training of GAD Focals, Alternate Focal Persons and Facilitators on the Creation and Institutionalization of the GAD Focal Point System;

--		Conduct of Gender Sensitivity Training for GAD Focal Persons, Guidance Counselors, Student Service Coordinators and HRMO;

--		Training of GAD Focal Persons, alternate FPs, and Facilitators on Sex Disaggregated Data;

--		Conduct of Gender Sensitivity Trainings;

--		Conduct of capacity development training on the use of Gender Analysis Tools/Enhanced GMEF Training and HGDG

	

3)		Comparison of the actual costs incurred with the approved budget showed the following activities that exceeded its approved budget:

	

	GAD Activity

	Approved Budget

	Actual Expenditures

	Difference

	Conduct capacity training on genderizing the curriculum in academic units

	1,000,000.00

	3,867,000.00

	(2,867,000.00)

	Training of GFPS and key campus and university personalities on Gender Mainstreaming and other related activities

	2,000,000.00

	2,039,800.00

	(39,800.00)

	Attendance to local, national and international conferences with themes focused on mainstreaming GAD in Higher Education

	2,500,000.00

	2,914,000.00

	(414,000.00)

	Conduct monitoring and evaluation of GAD WFP, GPB and AR

	100,000.00

	291,400.00

	(191,400.00)

	

					The absence of details of expenditures and complete documents to support the Annual Gender and Development Accomplishment Report, cast doubts on the reliability of the reported accomplishments with the corresponding attributed costs.

	

				We recommended that Management direct the University GAD Focal Person to submit the details of expenditures per campus/operating unit to facilitate validation of the actual impact of the reported accomplishments in addressing gender issues and attribution of GAD funds, in order to cast away doubt on the reliability of the data reported in its Annual GAD Accomplishment Report.

	

Tax Laws



DMMMSU was able to withheld taxes amounting to ₱53,633,964.04 and remitted ₱51,987,721.58  having unremitted balance of ₱1,646,242.46 as of December 31, 2020. The unremitted taxes was remitted in January, 2020.







		GSIS Premium Deductions and Remittances

	

DMMMSU complied with the Implementing Rules and Regulations of RA No. 8291, the GSIS Act of 1997, on the collection and remittance of contributions to GSIS. Employer’s and employees’ premium contributions covering the period January to December, 2020 totaling ₱50,613,105.23 were promptly remitted to GSIS in accordance with the deadlines prescribed by GSIS. The unremitted balance of ₱4,623.21 as at December 31, 2020 was remitted in January, 2021.

	

			Pag-IBIG Fund Contributions

		

				In 2020, DMMMSU complied with Rule VII, Section 3 of the IRR of RA No. 9679, the Home Development Mutual Fund Law of 2009, otherwise known as Pag-IBIG Fund, in the collection and remittance of contributions to the Pag-IBIG Fund employer’s and employees’ share for CY 2020 totaling ₱3,179,795.72.00 and ₱11,154,025.91, respectively. The unremitted balance of ₱217.68 was remitted in January, 2020.

		

			Phil HEALTH Fund Contributions

		

DMMMSU also complied with Title III, Rule III, Section 18 of the IRR of RA No. 7875, otherwise known as “The National Health Insurance Act of 2013”, as amended in the payment of monthly premiums to the Phil health. Total employer’s and employees’ share amounting to ₱15,023,633.14 were promptly remitted as at December 31, 2020.



			Property Insurance Law

		

					DMMMSU complied with Republic Act No.656, otherwise known as the “Property Insurance Law” as amended by PD No. 245 dated July 13, 1973 for the properties and assets that were insured with General Insurance Fund (GIF) administered by GSIS totaling ₱396,688,149.82 with insurance premiums paid amounting to ₱2,657,622.04.



			Status of Audit Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges



19)		The Salary and YEB differentials amounting to ₱1,608,394.39, paid to DMMMSU SLUC faculty members whose ranks were reclassified under the NBC No. 461 – Seventh Evaluation was disallowed in audit because the payments were not in accordance with Sections 17 and 23, Rule VI of the 2017 ORAOHRA (Revised 2018), rendering the payments irregular.



				Item (2) of Section 17, Rule VI, of the 2017 Omnibus Rules on Appointments and Other Human Resource Actions (ORAOHRA) Revised July 2018 provides that:

	

The appointment of officials or employees who are on official leave of absence, training or scholarship grant, shall be effective upon assumption or upon return from official leave of absence, scholarship or training.”



			Moreover, Section 23 of the same Rule states:	



The date of the actual assumption of duties of the appointees, as indicated in the Certification of Assumption to Duty (CS Form No. 4, Series of 2017), shall be the basis for the payment of his/her salary and determination of service rendered in the government.



Records showed that 23 faculty members were still on study leave on July 1, 2019 and were only reinstated on various dates from January 1, 2020 to August 17, 2020. Post audit of transactions disclosed, that these faculty members were paid salaries based on their new rates and granted salary and YEB differentials covering the period July 1, 2019 to August 17, 2020.



As such, the payments of (1) salaries using their new rates and (2) salary and YEB differentials to these 23 faculty members were found to be not in order as these were not in accordance with Sections 17 and 23, Rule VI of the 2017 ORAOHRA (Revised 2018). The rules clearly state that appointments of officials or employees who are on official leave of absence, training or scholarship grant, shall be effective upon assumption or upon return from official leave of absence, scholarship or training and that the actual assumption of duties of the appointees shall be the basis for the payment of his/her salary. Thus, the 23 faculty members are entitled to their new rates only after being reinstated. Consequently, payments to them before their respective reinstatement were irregular, hence the issuance of Notice of Disallowance (ND) No. 21-001-101-(20) dated February 11, 2021.



20)		Audit disallowances totaling ₱66,404,717.32, charges totaling ₱362,945.60 and suspension of ₱8,167.15, for all funds, remained unsettled in the books of the DMMMSU as of December 31, 2020, which was not in strict adherence to COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated Septenber 15, 2009, which prescribes the “Rules and Regulations on Settlement of Accounts.”



COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009 provides that the Head of the Entity shall ensure that disallowances and charges are settled within the prescribed period and appropriate actions are taken on the deficiencies noted as contained in the ND.  It further required the Agency head to initiate the necessary administrative and/or criminal action in case of unjustified failure/refusal to effect compliance with the requirements by subordinate officials.





Unsettled disallowances, charges and suspension as of December 31, 2020 are summarized hereunder:

STATUS OF IMPLEMENTATION 

OF PRIOR YEARS’ 

AUDIT RECOMMENDATIONS 

STATUS OF IMPLEMENTATION OF PRIOR YEARS’ AUDIT RECOMMENDATIONS





	Of the 42 audit recommendations contained in CY 2019 Annual Audit Report, 31 were implemented and 11 were not implemented.  Details are laid down below:



Observation 

and Recommendation

(Page No.)

Actions Taken by Management

Result of Auditor’s Validation









AAR 2019



The reliability and validity of the “Land” account of the University recorded at 2009 assessed value of ₱545,827,767.54 could not be ascertained due to absence of proofs of ownership and/or possession affecting the fairness of presentation of the balance in the Financial Statement.



1)	We recommended Management to intensify the means and strategies already adopted in retrieving/recovering/transferring/titling/updating documents pertaining to the University’s landholdings, in order to ascertain the reliability and validity of University’s claim over those unaccounted area of Land and would eventually make the Management fairly present the book value on the Land in the Financial Statements. 







































2)	We further recommended Management to submit the actual status of their claim of “on going” processing of documents as proof that Management is doing its responsibility over their landholdings.





36

































The University already hired geodetic engineers and land titling experts to compose the newly established Land Acquisition. Transfer and Titling Office (LATTO). 



The newly created Land Acquisition, Transfer and Titling Office (LATTO) is in the process of retrieving/ recovering/ transferring/ titling/ updating documents.



Management is still in the process of retrieving/ recovering/ transferring/ titling/ updating of documents in support to the University’s claim of ownership over the landholdings.

































Not Implemented



Reiterated in the AAR 2020

































































Not Implemented

















Two (2) structures with a total cost of P11.464 million were recorded under “Other Structures” account instead of “Investment Property” account, which is not in conformity with Section 2, Chapter 9 of the GAM for National Government Agencies, resulting in the corresponding overstatement and understatement of said accounts, affecting the fairness of presentation of the University’s financial statements.



3)	We recommended  Management require the Accountant and the Supply Officer to review the Other Structures account and effect the necessary reclassification entries on those structures for lease/rent to the appropriate “Investment Property” account pursuant to Chapter 10 of the GAM, in order to present fairly the financial statements of the Campus.

37







































The recommended reclassification entries in order to present fairly the financial statements of the Campus were already taken up in the books by the MLUC Accountant.





































Implemented

























Lost PPE items with recorded cost aggregating P1,400,986.73 were not derecognized and corresponding receivable accounts were not set up in the books, which were not in conformity with Section 41, Chapter 10 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for NGAs Volume I, resulting in the overstatement of the PPE accounts and understatement of the receivable account by an amount  equal to the depreciated replacement costs of the subject items, affecting the fairness of presentation of the University’s financial statements.



4)	We recommended Management require the Accountant to derecognize from the books the lost PPEs and set up receivable account to recognize the loss of PPE as required under Sections 41(b) and 41(d), respectively, in order to reflect the correct balances of the affected accounts.

38























































The corresponding accounting entries to derecognize from the books the lost PPEs and setting up of receivable accounts were already taken up.















































Implemented















 Major repairs on the fence of OUS costing P1,168,974.93 was not capitalized, which was not in conformity with Sections 24 and 25, Chapter 10 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I, resulting in the overstatement and understatement of the accounts “Repairs and Maintenance” and “Land Improvements”, respectively, by such amount.



5)	We recommended Management to capitalize material costs of repairs and improvements of its PPE accounts, in order to reflect the accurate balances of the affected accounts for fair presentation of the financial statements.

40













































The Accountant of the DMMMSU Open University System (DOUS) already recorded the reclassification adjustment in the books.







































Implemented















Accounts payable amounting to ₱16,674,397.25 or 28.28% of the total balance of ₱58,966,328.74 as of December 31, 2019 pertain to accounts for which the University has no valid and legal obligations yet, which is not inconformity with Section 2, Chapter 6 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I, affecting the fairness of presentation of balances in the Financial Statements.



We recommended Management to:



6)	Direct the Accounting Office to review and analyze the composition of their “Accounts Payable” account and take up necessary adjustments, if any, in order to present fairly its balance in the Financial Statements, and



7)	Henceforth, to recognize accounts payable only for valid and legal obligations of the University as of reporting date, in conformity with Section 2 of Chapter 6 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I.

41







































Necessary adjustments in the book of accounts were already taken up. 





















Concerned offices were already directed to observe strict compliance with accounting rules and regulations.





































Implemented



























Implemented

















 Past due accounts ranging from over one year to three years and above increased by P5,832,328.50 or 20.27% over last year’s total of ₱28,769,156.98, for lack of regular monitoring, depriving the State University the much-needed funds to support its programs.



8)	We recommended Management to intensify its collection efforts by sending Demand Letters/tracers to the last known addresses of those with unsettled accounts to enforce collection in order not to deprive the University from much needed funds to support its operation.











9)	We further recommend that accounts receivables should be consistently monitored after recognition in the books to avoid past due accounts.

42

























Management already sent demand letters and billing statements to the concerned students for the settlement of their long overdue school fees accounts including those with unsettled past due receivables from F161.



Reassessment made on the balance of the receivable account revealed that some of the accounts were already settled; hence the necessary adjusting entries were already booked up to correct the errors.

























Implemented































Implemented























 Negative balances of at least 96 accounts aggregating ₱45,642.00 were included in the Accounts Receivable under Funds 164 and 161, which was not in accordance with the account’s normal balance as stated in the Revised Chart of Accounts for National Government Agencies, rendering the “Account Receivable” account understated by the same amount, thereby, affecting the fairness of the presentation of its balance in the Financial Statements.



10)	We recommended that the Accounting Office analyze and determine the causes of the abnormal/negative balances and effect the necessary adjustments to reflect the correct balance of the  “Accounts Receivable” account in the financial statements.

44







































A memorandum from the Office of the University President was issued directing the Accountants of the concerned campuses to analyze and determine the causes of the abnormal/negative balances and to effect immediately the necessary adjustments. 



As of June 2020, the adjustments were already booked up and refunds were also made for the overpayments.





































Not Implemented



As of December 31, 2020, there again exist negative balances, hence, reiterated in this Report.





















The teaching overload formula prescribed under the DMMMSU Faculty Manual 2011 Edition used by NLUC and MLUC College of Graduate Studies (DMMMSU CGS) in computing the honoraria of its professors, was inconsistent with the provision of Chapter 7 of DBM Manual on Position Classification and Compensation, resulting in excess payment of ₱3,889,064.69.



We recommended Management to:



11)	Revisit the formula provided under the DMMMSU Faculty Manual to be aligned/consistent with the provisions of DBM Manual on Position Classification and Compensation, thus, avoiding excessive payments of honoraria for teaching overload, and



45









































The University already revised its policy on the payment of overload pay which was duly approved by the Board of Regents last December 2019. 



The revised policy         was implemented   during    the 2nd Semester AY 2019-2020.







































Implemented



Submission of Daily Time Records (DTRs) by DMMMSU regular employees was not strictly imposed which was not in full adherence to Section 2 of Rule XVII, Omnibus Rules Implementing Book V of Executive Order No. 292 and DMMMSU Memorandum dated August 16, 2019, resulting in incomplete DTRs of some employees, casting doubt on the correctness of the Salaries and Wages paid and corresponding leave balances of concerned employees.



We recommended Management the following:



12)	The HRMO to submit to this office the lacking DTRs.  







13)	The HRMO to submit the list of non-complying employees to the Office of the Director for Administrative Services every 10th day of the month for proper action and to furnish the Accounting Office of the same for the withholding of salary;



14)	The Accounting Office to strictly enforce the “No DTR, No Salary” policy, and



15)	That henceforth, Management ensure the completeness of documents to support the propriety of all its expenditures.

47















































All lacking DTRs were already submitted to the Commission on Audit.





































A memorandum from the Office of the University President dated August 16, 2019 was issued directing all personnel to submit their lacking DTRs and to strictly comply with the provisions of Omnibus Rules Implementing Book V of Executive Order No. 292.

Per validation of the submitted Daily Time Records, DMMMSU SLUC had still lacking Daily Time Records.

DMMMSU – NLUC, MLUC and SLUC procured supplies and materials amounting to ₱624,840.18 out of cash advances which was not in adherence to the modes of procurement under the Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations of Republic Act 9184 (Revised IRR of RA 9184), casting doubts on the legality and regularity of the procurements.



We recommended Management the to:



16)	To strictly enforce that materials and supplies needed during scheduled activities of the University should be planned and procurement of the same should be through the modes allowed under the Revised IRR of RA 9184, and



17)	Stop the practice of granting cash advances for the purchase of supplies and other materials, otherwise the Audit Team shall be constrained to issue appropriate Notice of Suspension or Notice of Disallowance.

49







































Management committed during the 2019 exit conference that materials needed for University activities will be through the modes allowed under RA 9184.





The practice of granting cash advances for the purchase of supplies and other materials was already discontinued effective CY 2020.

Seven (7) non-teaching personnel of DMMMSU were on Study Leave with pay in excess of the 4-month study period allowed under Civil Service Memorandum Circular (MC) No. 21, s. 2004, thereby, casting doubt on the legality and/or regularity of the granting thereof.



18)	We recommended Management to submit legal basis and/or justification/s in allowing personnel to go on study leave with pay to complete a master’s degree for a period beyond the limitation set forth under CSC MC. No. 21 s. 2004.

50

























The Management cited its Faculty and Staff Development Plan (FSDP) which is duly approved by the University Board of Regents as its leave mechanism for its scholars pursuant to the issued CHED Guidelines for Graduate Education Scholarships for Faculty and Staff Development in the K to 12 Transition Period.
