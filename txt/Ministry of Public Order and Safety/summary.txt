D. Scope of Audit 
 

The audit covered the financial transactions and operations of the MPOS for CY 2020. 
 
E. Auditor’s Report 

 
The Auditor rendered an unqualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the 

financial statements of MPOS as of December 31, 2020. 
 

F. Summary of Observations and Recommendations 
 

1. Disbursements for various activities were not paid directly to suppliers or creditors but 
were paid through cash advances. Consequently, taxes were not withheld from the 
payments made to various suppliers, where applicable, thus depriving the government 
from collecting the taxes due. (Observation No. 1) 
 
We recommended that Management faithfully ensure that: (a) checks drawn against the 
account of the Ministry are directly issued to creditors or suppliers; and (b) taxes are 
withheld from the amounts due to the suppliers, to avoid incurrence of penalties and 
charges that may be imposed against the responsible Ministry officials by the Bureau 
of Internal Revenue (BIR). 
 

2. The legal, auditorial and technical review of consulting services engaged by the 
Ministry during FY 2020 amounting to more or less P1.61 million was not undertaken 
in a timely manner due to non-submission of the necessary documents within the 
timeframe set forth. (Observation No. 2) 
 
We recommended and Management agreed to faithfully adhere to the provisions of law 
regarding the engagement of consultants and ensure that copies of contracts and each 
of all the documents forming part thereof are submitted within the timeframe set forth 
for timely review of the auditorial, legal and technical aspects of the contracts. 
 

3. The necessity and propriety of the payment for repairs and maintenance of the Ministry 
for the year 2020 totaling ₱564,186.03 could not be fully ascertained due to the non-
submission of the disbursement vouchers together with the supporting documents. 
(Observation No. 3) 
 
We recommended and Management agreed to maintain an adequate and effective 
internal control that requires the submission of documentary requirements in 
conformity with laws, rules and regulations and a thorough review of all the supporting 
documents to establish the validity and propriety of the transactions paid. 
 



iv 
 

4. Copies of perfected contracts, purchase/work orders (PO/WO) and their supporting 
documents entered into by the Ministry with third parties totaling to more or less ₱30.6 
million were not furnished to COA within five (5) working days as required under COA 
Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009; thus, deficiency, if any, was not timely 
identified, and results of verification were not promptly communicated to Management. 
(Observation No. 4) 
 
We recommended and Management agreed to henceforth faithfully submit copies of 
all contracts/POs/WOs and its supporting documents to COA within the prescribed 
period, for timely review of the legal and auditorial aspects of said transactions. 
 

5. Annual Procurement Plan (APP) and Procurement Monitoring Reports (PMR) for CY 
2020 were not submitted by the Ministry as basis of its procurement and evaluation 
during the year, hence, compliance with the provisions of the Revised IRR of R.A. 
1984 or the Government Procurement Reform Act relative to the various disbursements 
made by the MPOS during the year could not be ascertained. (Observation No. 5) 
 
We recommended and Management agreed to henceforth faithfully comply with the 
preparation and submission to the GPPB of the APP and PMR within the time frame 
as required, as well as furnish a copy to COA. 

 
6. The validity and propriety of the payment made and charged to Semi-Expendable 

Machinery and Equipment Expenses account for phones amounting to ₱40,129.81 
could not be ascertained due to non-submission of the DVs and supporting documents. 
(Observation No. 6) 
 
We recommended that Management faithfully ensure that all claims under review and 
approval comply with Section 4(1) of P.D. No. 1445 and ensure that all procurement 
made are included in the approved APP. 

 
7. The Ministry has not complied with the Perpetual Inventory Method of recording 

regular supplies and materials purchases as nearly 95% of the reported expenses for 
accountable forms, office supplies, other materials and supplies and semi-expendable 
machinery and equipment were recorded as outright expenses upon purchase and not 
coursed through the proper inventory accounts pursuant to the provision of Section 9, 
Chapter 8 of the GAM Volume I.  (Observation No. 7) 

 
We recommended that Management faithfully comply with Section 9 of GAM Volume 
I, on the use of Perpetual Inventory System which requires the recording of all 
purchases and issuances of supplies as they take place using the proper accounts.   

 
8. The completeness, existence, accuracy and correctness of the balances of Office 

Supplies Inventory accounts of the Ministry totaling ₱113,686.16 as of December 31, 
2020 could not be readily ascertained due to non-conduct of physical count and non-
submission of the Report of Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) for these assets. 
(Observation No. 8) 

 



v 
 

We recommend that Management require the Inventory Committee to submit the RPCI 
as of December 31, 2020 and henceforth regularly comply with the provision of Section 
13, Chapter 8 of GAM Volume I. 

  
9. The completeness, existence, accuracy and correctness of the balances of the Property, 

Plant and Equipment (PPE) accounts of the Ministry with book value of ₱1,656,288.94 
as of December 31, 2020 were not ascertained on a timely manner due to non-conduct 
of physical count with the presence of the COA auditor and the delayed submission of 
the Report of Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) for these 
assets as required by regulations. (Observation No. 9) 
 
We recommended and Management agreed to faithfully comply with the conduct of 
physical count of its PPE with the presence of the COA auditor and thereafter regularly 
submit an RPCPPE within the prescribed date as required under the aforementioned 
provision of the GAM. 
 

10. Properties of the Ministry were exposed to risk of unnecessary losses in the event of 
damage to, or loss of, such assets and properties as the agency was not able to obtain 
adequate insurance coverage for the insurable assets and properties during the year 
pursuant to RA No. 656 or the Property Insurance Law, as amended by PD 245 and 
COA Circular No. 2018-002 dated May 31, 2018. (Observation No. 10) 
 
We recommended and Management agreed to submit an updated inventory of all 
insurable properties to the General Insurance Fund (GIF) using the form prescribed by 
the GSIS for determination and approval of appropriate insurance coverage; and obtain 
an adequate insurance coverage for the insurable assets and properties with the GIF in 
order to indemnify or compensate the Government from any damage to, or loss of, its 
properties due to fire, earthquake, storm, or other casualty. 
 

11. The Ministry has incurred delays in the submission of financial reports together with 
its supporting documents for the period January to December 2020 as required under 
Section 60 Chapter 19 and Section 7 Chapter 21 of the GAM Volume I, thus, precluding 
the timely audit of accounts and correction by Management of the deficiencies noted, 
if any. (Observation No. 11) 
 
We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Finance Unit and all other 
accountable officers to submit timely the required accounting and financial reports and 
henceforth all the succeeding reports within the prescribed deadlines in accordance 
with the pertinent rules and regulations; and implement additional measures that will 
enable the Ministry to meet the prescribed deadlines. 
 
 

G. Status of Implementation of Prior Year’s Audit Recommendations 
 
The MPOS is a newly created agency of the BARMM, hence, there were no prior 

years’ audit recommendations.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT

The Minister
Ministry of Public Order and Safety
2/F MCWD Building, Gov. Gutierrez Ave.
Cotabato City

Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements

Unqualified Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of the Ministry of Public Order and Safety
(MPOS), which comprise the statement of financial position as at December 31, 2020
and the statement of financial performance, statement of cash flows, statement of changes
in net assets/equity, and statement of comparison of budget and actual amounts for the
year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant
accounting policies and other explanatory information.

In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of MPOS as at December 31, 2020, and its financial
performance, statements of cash flows, statement of changes in net assets/equity,
statement of comparison of budget and actual amounts for the year then ended, and notes
to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies in
accordance with Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standards (PPSASs).

Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with the International Standards of Supreme Audit
Institutions (ISSAIs). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in
the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our
report. We are independent of the Ministry of Public Order and Safety in accordance with
the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements, and we
have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We
believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
basis for our unqualified audit opinion.

Responsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial
statements in accordance with the PPSAS, and for such internal control as management



determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to
issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of
assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISSAIs will
always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud
or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of
these financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISSAIs, we exercise professional judgement and
maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

1. Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements,
whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to
those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting
from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve
collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of
internal control.

2. Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design
audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose
of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the MPOS’ internal control.

3. Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of
accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.

4. Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements
including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the
underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

1.5. The Ministry’s current staffing pattern is based on the Transition Plan
submitted by the Chief Minister to the Parliament. It has four (4) offices,
namely: Legislative and Liaison Office; Information and Communication
Office; Planning and Development Office; and Internal Audit Office.
Moreover, it has two (2) divisions, to wit: Administrative and Finance
Division; and Operation and Coordination Division.

1.6. However, the newly enacted Bangsamoro Administrative Code provides in its
Title X, Section 4, that the MPOS shall be composed of the Ministry Proper,
Ministry Services and Offices, and such other appropriate divisions and units
as may be necessary. It apparently lowered the four (4) above-mentioned
offices into mere sections. Nonetheless, it modified the MPOS Operation
Division by making it as two (2) services, to wit: Home Affairs Services; and
Bangsamoro Peace, Reconciliation and Unification Services.

1.7. Each service has two (2) divisions under it, namely: Civilian Intelligence and
Investigation Division and Law Enforcement Coordination Division; and Peace
Education Division and Alternative Dispute Resolution Division, respectively.

2. Statement of Compliance and Basis of Financial Statements Presentation

2.1. The Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with and comply with the
Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standards (PPSAS) issued by the
Commission on Audit per COA Resolution No. 2014-003 dated January 24,
2014.

2.2. The financial statements have been prepared on the basis of historical cost,
unless stated otherwise. The Statement of Cash Flows is prepared using the
direct method.

3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

3.1. Basis of Accounting

The financial statements are prepared on an accrual basis in accordance with
the PPSAS.

3.2. Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand or cash in bank. For the
purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of
cash and short-term deposits.

3.3. Inventories

Inventory is measured at cost upon initial recognition. To the extent that
inventory was received through non-exchange transactions (for no cost or for a
nominal cost), the cost of the inventory is its fair value at the date of
acquisition.

Inventories are recognized as an expense when deployed for utilization or
consumption in the ordinary course of operations of the agency.

3.4. Property, Plant and Equipment

Recognition

An item is recognized as PPE if it meets the characteristics and recognition
criteria as PPE.

Measurement at Recognition

An item recognized as PPE is measured at cost.

A PPE acquired through non–exchange transactions is measured at its fair
value at the date of acquisition.

10



Measurement after Recognition

After recognition, all PPE are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and
impairment losses.

When significant parts of PPE are required to be replaced at intervals, the
agency recognizes such parts as individual assets with specific useful lives and
depreciates them accordingly. Likewise, when a major repair/replacement is
done, its cost is recognized in the carrying amount of the PPE if the recognition
criteria are satisfied.

All other repairs and maintenance are recognized as expenses.

Depreciation

Each part of an item of property, plant and equipment with a cost that is
significant in relation to the total cost of the item is depreciated separately.

The depreciation charge for each period is recognized as an expense unless it is
included in the cost of another asset.

Initial Recognition of Depreciation

Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use such as when it is in
the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the
manner intended by management.

For simplicity or to avoid proportionate computation, the depreciation is for
one month if the PPE is available for use on or before the 15th of the month.
However, if the PPE is available for use after the 15th of the month,
depreciation is for the succeeding month.

Depreciation Method

The straight line method of depreciation is adopted unless another method is
more appropriate for the agency operation.

Estimated useful life

MPOS uses the schedule on the Estimated Useful Life of PPE by classification
prepared by COA.

The agency uses a residual value equivalent to at least five per cent of the cost
of the PPE.

11



Impairment

An asset’s carrying amount is written down to its recoverable amount, or
recoverable service amount, if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its
estimated recoverable service amount

Derecognition

MPOS derecognizes items of PPE and/or any significant part of an asset upon
disposal or when no future economic benefits or service potential is expected
from its accounting use. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset
(calculated as the difference between disposal proceeds and the carrying
amount of the asset) is included in the surplus or deficit when the asset is
derecognized.

3.5. Changes in accounting policies and estimate

MPOS recognizes the effects of changes in accounting policy retrospectively.
The effects of changes in accounting policy were applied prospectively if
retrospective application is impractical.

MPOS recognizes the effects of changes in accounting estimate prospectively
by including in surplus or deficit.

MPOS corrects material prior period errors retrospectively in the first set of
financial statements authorized for issue after their discovery by:

● Restating the comparative amounts for prior period(s) presented in
which the error occurred; or

● If the error occurred before the earliest prior period presented,
restating the opening balances of assets, liabilities and net
assets/equity for the earliest prior period presented.

3.6. Budget information

The annual budget is prepared on a cash basis and is published on the
government website.

A separate Statement of Comparison of Budget and Actual Amounts (SCBAA)
was prepared since the budget and the actual financial statements were
prepared on a comparable basis. The SCBAA was presented showing the
original and final budget and actual amounts on a comparable basis to the
budget.

12



4. Correction of Fundamental Errors

Errors of prior years are corrected by using the Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit)
Account. Errors affecting current year’s operations are charged to the current year’s
account.

PART II - OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
 
COMPLIANCE AUDIT 
 
Non-withholding of taxes from suppliers 
 
1. Disbursements for various activities were not paid directly to suppliers or 

creditors but were paid through cash advances. Consequently, taxes were not 
withheld from the payments made to various suppliers, where applicable, thus 
depriving the government from collecting the taxes due, contrary to DOF-
DBM-COA Joint Circular No. 1-2000 dated January 3, 2000. 

1.1 Section 4.2.2 of DOF-DBM-COA Joint Circular No. 1-2000 dated January 
3, 2000 provides the following: 
 
4.2.2. Pay employees/suppliers/contractors for services 
rendered/goods delivered net of withholding taxes; 

1.2 Several cash advances were granted to officers and employees of the 
Ministry for payment of various goods and services for its activities 
conducted during the year. These cash advances were resorted to instead of 
direct payments to suppliers as the latter will enable the agency to withhold 
taxes from the suppliers. 

1.3 As a result, the government was not able to collect the taxes that could have 
been withheld from the payments thereof as required by the aforementioned 
circular. 

1.4 We recommended that Management faithfully ensure that: 

a. checks drawn against the account of the Ministry are directly issued 
to creditors or suppliers; and 

b. taxes are withheld from the amounts due to the suppliers, to avoid 
incurrence of penalties and charges that may be imposed against the 
responsible Ministry officials by the Bureau of Internal Revenue 
(BIR). 

1.5 Management commented during the exit conference that the pertinent 
transactions that were paid through cash advances were for small 
items/services paid to suppliers in rural areas for the conduct of various 
community training and activities.  

 Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

1.6 While we agree that there are certain transactions which could not be 
conveniently paid directly to suppliers through check, such as travelling 
expenses and therefore such could serve as an exception, we nonetheless 
recommend that Management ensure that expenses such as but not limited 



20 
 

to office supplies, catering services, and other items of similar purpose, 
should be paid directly to suppliers in view of the above-cited BIR 
regulation. 

 
Hiring of Consultants 
 
2. The legal, auditorial and technical review of consulting services engaged by 

the Ministry during FY 2020 amounting to more or less P1.61 million was not 
undertaken on a timely manner due to non-submission of the necessary 
documents within the timeframe set forth pursuant to Section 3.1.1 of COA 
Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009. 

2.1 Section 5(i) of the 2016 Revised IRR of RA No. 9184 provides that, 
 
Consulting Services. Refer to services for infrastructure projects 
and other types of projects or activities of the GoP requiring 
adequate external technical and professional expertise that are 
beyond the capability and/or capacity of the GoP to undertake 
such as, but not limited to: (i) advisory and review services; (ii) 
pre-investment or feasibility studies; (iii) design; (iv) construction 
supervision; (v) management and related services; and (vi) other 
services or special studies. xxx (emphasis supplied) 

2.2 Section 3.1.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-001 requires that, 
 
Within five (5) working days from the execution of a contract by 
the government or any of its subdivisions, agencies or 
instrumentalities, including government-owned and controlled 
corporations and their subsidiaries, a copy of said contract and 
each of all the documents forming part thereof by reference or 
incorporation shall be furnished to the Auditor of the agency 
concerned. x x x (emphasis supplied) 

2.3 The required technical review have not been performed for the consulting 
services procured by the Ministry amounting to more or less P1.61 million 
for the year 2020 due to non-submission of the copies of contracts and each 
of all the documents forming part thereof to COA within the timeframe set 
forth.  

2.4 We recommended and Management agreed to faithfully adhere to the 
provisions of law regarding the engagement of consultants and ensure 
that copies of contracts and each of all the documents forming part 
thereof are submitted within the timeframe set forth for timely review 
of the auditorial, legal and technical aspects of the contracts.   

 

 

 



21 
 

Repairs and Maintenance 
 
3. The necessity and propriety of the payment for repairs and maintenance of the 

Ministry for FY 2020 totaling ₱564,186.03 could not be ascertained due to the 
non-submission of the disbursement vouchers together with the supporting 
documents, contrary to the provisions of Section 9.1.3.4 of COA Circular No. 
2012-001. 

3.1 Section 9.1.3.4 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 requires 
that: 
 
Addition Documentary Requirements 
 

● Additional documents under Annexes Q and R of COA 
Memorandum No. 2005-027 dated February 28, 2005 
required to be submitted to the Auditor’s Office within five 
days from the execution of the contract: 
 
Copy of the pre-repair evaluation report and approved 
detailed plans by the agency showing in sufficient detail 
the scope of work/extent of repair to be done 
 
Copy of the latest service bulletin, in case of aircraft 
 
Report of waste materials 
 
Copy of document indicating the history of repair 
 

● Post-inspection reports 
● Warranty Certificate 
● Request for payment 
● Bill/invoices 
● Certificate of Acceptance 
● Pre-repair inspection reports 
● Such other document peculiar to the contract and/or to the 

mode of procurement and considered necessary in the 
auditorial review and in the technical evaluation thereof 

3.2 During the year, the Ministry has spent a total of ₱564,186.03 for repairs and 
maintenance of various assets as broken down as follows: 

 
Particulars Amount 

Repairs and Maintenance – Machinery and Equipment 7,950.00 

Repairs and Maintenance – Transportation Equipment 105,033.40 

Repairs and Maintenance – Leased Assets 451,202.63 



22 
 

Particulars Amount 

Total ₱564,186.03 
 

3.3 Post audit of disbursements disclosed that the necessity for and propriety of 
the above expenses could not be fully ascertained due to non-submission of 
the related Disbursement Vouchers (DVs) and supporting documents. The 
following, among others, were lacking documents necessary pursuant to 
Section 9.1.3.4 of COA Circular No. 2012-001, namely: Pre-repair 
inspection reports, Certificate of Acceptance, Post-inspection reports, copy 
of document indicating history of repair and Report of Waste Materials. 

3.4 In addition, it was also noted that a number of repairs were paid through the 
petty cash fund rather than paid directly to suppliers, especially those with 
amounts more than ₱1,000. 

3.5 We recommended and Management agreed to maintain an adequate 
and effective internal control that requires the submission of 
documentary requirements in conformity with laws, rules and 
regulations and a thorough review of all the supporting documents to 
establish the validity and propriety of the transactions paid. 
 

Non-submission of Contracts/POs/WOs within the timeframe set forth 
 
4. Copies of perfected contracts, purchase/work orders (PO/WO) and their 

supporting documents entered into by the Ministry with third parties totaling 
to more or less ₱30.6 million were not furnished to COA within five (5) 
working days as required under COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 
12, 2009; thus, deficiency, if any, was not timely identified, and results of 
verification were not promptly communicated to Management. 

4.1 COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009 requires the 
submission of a copy of government contracts, purchase orders and the like, 
entered into by any government agency, irrespective of the amount involved, 
to the Commission on Audit. 

4.2 Section 3.1.1 of said Circular states that: 
 
Within five (5) working days from the execution of a contract by 
the government or any of its subdivisions, agencies or 
instrumentalities, including government-owned and controlled 
corporations, and their subsidiaries, a copy of said contract and 
each of all documents forming part thereof by reference or 
incorporation shall be furnished to the Auditor of the agency. 

4.3 Likewise, Section 3.2.1 of said Circular provides the following: 
 



23 
 

A copy of any purchase order irrespective of amount, and each 
and every supporting document, shall, within five (5) working 
days from issuance thereof, be submitted to the Auditor 
concerned. Within the same period, the Auditor shall review and 
point out to management defects and/or deficiencies, if any, in the 
same manner provided in the second and third sentences of items 
3.1.4 hereof.  

4.4 Records showed that copies of contracts and purchase orders together with 
supporting documents for various transactions entered into between the 
Ministry and third parties were not submitted to COA, for purposes of legal 
and auditorial review, within the prescribed period under existing regulation. 

4.5 It was observed that Management only submitted POs/Contracts as 
attachments to the Disbursement Vouchers (DVs) which the same were only 
forwarded late already to COA. Hence, no copies of such POs/Contracts and 
their supporting documents were furnished in advance within five (5) 
working days after the perfection of the contract/purchase orders pursuant to 
the above-mentioned COA Circular. 

4.6 Thus, the non-observance of the timely submission of the copies of purchase 
orders and contracts with supporting documents as prescribed under said 
COA Circular prevented the timely legal and auditorial review of purchase 
orders and contracts entered into by the Ministry with breakdown as follows: 

 
Particulars Amount 

Catering services for trainings and seminars 
conducted 

13,794,366.74 

Office supplies procured during the year 728,138.60 

Various property, plant and equipment 1,840,326.00 

Accountable Forms Expenses 1,200.00 

Other Supplies and Materials Expenses 955,513.90 

Semi-Expendable Machinery and Equipment 
Expenses 

100,925.81 

Consultancy Services 3,393,096.54 

Other Professional Services 1,956,812.00 

Security Services 167,231.80 

Other General Services 6,351,329.00 

Repairs and Maintenance 564,186.03 

Rent/Lease expenses 833,725.54 



24 
 

Particulars Amount 

Total ₱30,686,851.96 
 

4.7 We recommended and Management agreed to henceforth faithfully 
submit copies of all contracts/POs/WOs and its supporting documents 
to COA within the prescribed period, for timely review of the legal and 
auditorial aspects of said transactions. 

Non-submission of Annual Procurement Plans 
 

5. Annual Procurement Plan (APP) and Procurement Monitoring Reports 
(PMR) for FY 2020 were not submitted by the Ministry as basis of its 
procurement and evaluation during the year, hence, compliance with the 
provisions of the Revised IRR of R.A. 9184 or the Government Procurement 
Reform Act relative to the various disbursements made by the MPOS during 
the year could not be fully ascertained. 

5.1 Section 7.1 of the IRR of R.A. 9184 provides that: 
 
All procurement shall be within the approved budget of the 
Procuring Entity and should be meticulously and judiciously 
planned by the Procuring Entity. Consistent with government 
fiscal discipline measures, only those considered crucial to the 
efficient discharge of governmental functions shall be included in 
the Annual Procurement Plan (APP). For purposes of this IRR, a 
procurement project shall be considered crucial to the efficient 
discharge of governmental functions if it is required for the day-
to-day operations or is in pursuit of the principal mandate of the 
Procuring Entity concerned. The APP shall include provisions for 
foreseeable emergencies based on historical records. In the case 
of Infrastructure Projects, the APP shall consider the appropriate 
timing/phasing of related project activities, such as, engineering 
design and acquisition of right-of-way site or location, to 
reduce/lower project costs. 

5.2 Further, Section 12.2 of the IRR of R.A. 9184 states that: 
 
The BAC shall be responsible for ensuring that the Procuring 
Entity abides by the standards set forth by the Act and this IRR, 
and it shall prepare a Procurement Monitoring Report (PMR) in 
the form prescribed by the GPPB. The PMR shall cover all 
procurement activities specified in the APP, whether ongoing and 
completed, from the holding of pre-procurement conference to the 
issuance of notice of award and the approval of the contract, 
including the standard and actual time for each major 
procurement activity. The PMR shall be approved and submitted 
by the HoPE to the GPPB in printed and electronic format within 



25 
 

fourteen (14) calendar days after the end of each semester. The 
PMR shall likewise be posted in accordance with E.O. 662, s. 
2007, as amended. 

5.3 Review of the agency’s compliance with the aforementioned regulation 
could not be fully undertaken due to non-submission by the Ministry of the 
required Annual Procurement Plan (APP). 

5.4 We recommended and Management agreed to henceforth faithfully 
comply with the preparation and submission to the GPPB of the APP 
and PMR within the time frame as required, as well as furnish a copy to 
COA. 

 
Payments of Semi-Expendable Items 

 
6. The validity and propriety of the payment made and charged to Semi-

Expendable Machinery and Equipment Expenses account for phones 
amounting to ₱40,129.81 could not be ascertained due to non-submission of 
the DVs and supporting documents contrary to Section 4(1) of the Presidential 
Decree (PD) No. 1445. 

6.1 Section 4(1) of P.D. No. 1445 provides that, 
 
(1) No money shall be paid out of any public treasury or 
depository except in pursuance of an appropriation law or 
other specific statutory authority. 

6.2 Review of records submitted by the Accounting Unit of the Ministry 
disclosed that payment was made in December 2020 to purchase phones for 
documentation purposes. However, the validity and propriety for such 
disbursement could not be ascertained as of date due to non-submission of 
the related DV and supporting documents. Likewise, the authority for such 
disbursement could not be established due to absence of an approved APP 
indicating such items for purchase. 

6.3 We recommended that Management faithfully ensure that all claims 
under review and approval comply with Section 4(1) of P.D. No. 1445 
and ensure that all procurement made are included in the approved 
APP. 

Non-observance of the Perpetual Inventory System 
 
7. The Ministry has not complied with the Perpetual Inventory Method of 

recording regular supplies and materials purchases as nearly 95% of the 
reported expenses for accountable forms, office supplies, other materials and 
supplies and semi-expendable machinery and equipment were recorded as 
outright expenses upon purchase and not coursed through the proper 
inventory accounts pursuant to the provision of Section 9, Chapter 8 of the 
GAM Volume I.  



26 
 

7.1 Section 9, Chapter 8 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) Volume 
I requires that: 
 
x x x Regular purchases shall be coursed through the 
inventory account and issued thereof shall be recorded as they 
take place except for supplies and materials purchased out of 
PCF for immediate use or on emergency cases which shall be 
charged directly to the appropriate expense accounts. 

7.2 During the year, the Ministry has recorded expenses pertaining to the 
following: 

 
Particulars Amount 

Office Supplies Expense 614,452.44 

Accountable Forms Expenses 1,200.00 

Other Supplies and Materials Expenses 955,513.90 

Semi-Expendable Machinery and Equipment 
Expenses

Total ₱1,785,778.31 

7.3 Analysis disclosed that more or less 94% or ₱1,672,138.72 of the above 
expenses were recorded in the books as outright expenses and not coursed 
through the proper inventory accounts as required under the above-cited 
provision of the GAM. 

7.4 We recommended that Management faithfully comply with Section 9 of 
GAM Volume I, on the use of Perpetual Inventory System which 
requires the recording of all purchases and issuances of supplies as they 
take place using the proper accounts. 

7.5 Management made adjustments to reflect the unused portion of the various 
supplies and accountable forms which were originally recorded as expenses. 

 
No physical count of inventories conducted with the presence of COA and delayed 
submission of RCPI 

 
8. The completeness, existence, accuracy and correctness of the balances of 

Inventory accounts of the Ministry totaling ₱341,382.64 as of December 31, 
2020 were not timely ascertained due to non-conduct of physical count with 
the presence of representative from COA and and the delay in submission of 
the RPCI for these assets as required under Section 13, Chapter 8 of the GAM 
Volume I. 

8.1 Section 13, Chapter 8 of the GAM, Volume I state that: 
 



27 
 

x x x Physical count/inventory, which is required semi-
annually, is an indispensable procedure for checking the 
integrity of property custodianship. 

8.2 As of December 31, 2020, the Ministry reported a balance of the Office 
Supplies Inventory account of ₱341,382.64. However, the correctness, 
existence, accuracy and correctness of the reported inventory accounts were 
not verified as there was no conduct of actual physical count of the inventory 
with the presence of the audit team both during the middle and end of the FY 
2020. Consequently, the non-conduct of the physical count of the inventory 
led to the delay in submission by Management of the required RPCI as 
required under the GAM. 

8.3 Hence, this casts doubt as to the reliability of the reported balance of the 
Inventory accounts as of December 31, 2020. 

8.4 We recommended and Management agreed to require the Inventory 
Committee to henceforth regularly comply with the provision of the 
GAM relative to the conduct of physical count and submission of report 
thereafter. 

 
Non-conduct of physical inventory with the presence of COA representative and delayed 
submission of reports 

 
9. The completeness, existence, accuracy and correctness of the balances of the 

PPE accounts of the Ministry with book value of ₱1,656,288.94 as of December 
31, 2020 were not ascertained on a timely manner due to non-conduct of 
physical count with the presence of the COA auditor and the delayed 
submission of the RPCPPE for these assets as required by regulations. 

9.1 As of December 31, 2020, the agency has reported a balance of 
₱1,656,288.94 as book value for its PPE accounts. However, the 
completeness, existence, accuracy and correctness of such amounts could not 
be verified as the agency has not conducted an actual physical count of these 
assets with the presence of the audit team Moreover, the RPCPPEs were 
submitted beyond the reglementary period required under the regulation 

9.2 We recommended and Management agreed to faithfully comply with 
the conduct of physical count of its PPE with the presence of the COA 
auditor and thereafter regularly submit an RPCPPE within the 
prescribed date as required under the aforementioned provision of the 
GAM. 

Compliance with Property Insurance Law 
 
10. Properties of the Ministry were exposed to risk of unnecessary losses in the 

event of damage to, or loss of, such assets and properties as the agency was not 
able to obtain adequate insurance coverage for the insurable assets and 
properties during the year pursuant to RA No. 656 or the Property Insurance 



28 
 

Law, as amended by PD 245 and COA Circular No. 2018-002 dated May 31, 
2018. 

10.1 Section 5 of RA No. 656, as amended by PD 245 requires that: 

 
Section 5. Every government, except a municipal government below first 
class, is hereby required to insure its properties, with the Fund against any 
insurable risk herein provided and pay the premiums thereon, which, 
however, shall not exceed the premiums charged by private insurance 
companies: Provided, however, That the System reserves the right to 
disapprove the whole or a portion of the amount of insurance applied for: 
Provided, further, That such property or part thereof as may not be 
insurable or acceptable for insurance may be insured with any private 
insurance company. A municipal government below first class may upon 
application insure its properties in the Fund under such rules and 
regulations as the System may prescribe. 

10.2 In addition, Item 5.1.a-b of COA Circular No. 2018-002 dated May 31, 2018 
also provides that: 

 
5.1 Heads of government agencies shall direct the pertinent 
officials under his/her supervision to: 
 
a. Secure directly from the GSIS GIF, all insurances or bonds 

covering properties, contracts, rights of action, and other 
insurable risks of their respective offices; 
 

b. Prepare the Property Inventory Form (PIF) listing of all the 
insurable properties and other assets, showing their latest 
appraised value/valuation, appraisal date, location, and other 
information (Annex A); 

c. x x x 

10.3 Records and reports submitted to COA noted that insurance coverage for 
insurable assets and properties of the agency were not obtained for the year 
2020. Furthermore, updated inventory of all insurable assets and properties 
using the format prescribed in the aforecited COA Circular and/or the GSIS 
was also not prepared. 

10.4 We recommended and Management agreed to submit an updated 
inventory of all insurable properties to the GIF using the form 
prescribed by the GSIS for determination and approval of appropriate 
insurance coverage; and obtain an adequate insurance coverage for the 
insurable assets and properties with the GIF in order to indemnify or 
compensate the Government from any damage to, or loss of, its 
properties due to fire, earthquake, storm, or other casualty.

Delay in the Submission of Financial Reports 
 

11. The Ministry has incurred delays in the submission of financial reports 
together with its supporting documents for the period January to December 
2020 as required under Section 60 Chapter 19 and Section 7 Chapter 21 of the 
GAM Volume I, thus, precluding the timely audit of accounts and correction 
by Management of the deficiencies noted, if any. 

11.1 The following rules and regulations provide for the prescribed due dates for 
the submission of financial statements and reports to the audit team: 

11.2 Section 60 Chapter 19 of GAM, Volume I require that the Trial Balance and 
other financial reports shall be submitted within 10 days after the end of each 
month/quarter. 

11.3 Paragraph 6.05 of COA Circular No. 95-006 dated May 18, 1995 provides 
that “the receipts and disbursement records with all paid vouchers and 
documents evidencing the transactions shall be submitted within 10 days 
from the date of receipt of said documents.” 

11.4 We were informed that the reason for the delays were due to the incomplete 
supporting documents for the activities conducted by the Ministry during the 
period stated. 

11.5 The delay in submission of the reports together with their supporting 
documents resulted in the delay in establishing the validity, legality, and 
correctness of certain transactions of the Ministry. 

11.6 We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Finance Unit 
and all other accountable officers to submit timely the required 
accounting and financial reports and henceforth all the succeeding 
reports within the prescribed deadlines in accordance with the pertinent 
rules and regulations; and implement additional measures that will 
enable the Ministry to meet the prescribed deadlines. 

 

12. Status of Settlement of Audit Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges
