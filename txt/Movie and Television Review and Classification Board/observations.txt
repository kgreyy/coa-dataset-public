OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

 

A. Financial Audit and Compliance Audit 
 

Non submission of Disbursement Vouchers (DVs) for Audit 

 

1. Transactions amounting to P22,653,795.66 comprising 33 percent of the total 
transactions of P69,401,254.30 for CY 2020 were not submitted for audit until 

end of audit field work. Likewise, submission for audit of DVs, including 

Journal Entry Vouchers (JEVs) and their supporting documents were delayed 

from 58 to 141 working days inconsistent with Section 60 (c), Chapter 19, 

Volume I of the GAM; hence, precluded the Audit Team from conducting 

timely examination and evaluation of the transactions. 

 

Section 60 (c), Chapter 19, Volume I of the GAM, states that all NGAs shall 

prepare and submit the following financial statements/trial balances (FS/TB) and 

supporting schedules (SS)/documents within the prescribed deadline: 

 

Regularity Statement/Report Deadline Submit to: 

Monthly TBs and SSs

In the preparation of the TB, the source/summarizing documents are posted 

to the respective SLs. The source documents include the DV, JEV and other 

supporting documents.                                                                                                            

 

Review on the submission of the required reports and documents submitted 

to the Audit Team showed that the DVs were not regularly and timely submitted by 

the Accounting Office. As of March 25, 2021, financial reports and documents 

covering the period January to October 2020 were delayed by 58 to 141 working 

days, and DVs for the months of November to December 2020 totaling 

P22,653,795.66 were not yet submitted for audit.  Details of the delay are shown 

below.

The delay in the transmittal of the required financial reports and documents 

to the auditor precluded the conduct of timely examination and evaluation of the 

transactions and the preparation of audit reports for the period under audit. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Chief 

Accountant and other concerned officers and employees to comply with the 

prescribed deadlines for the submission of the financial reports and documents 

to the Office of the Auditor.  

 

  The MTRCB has always been committed to deliver its services with utmost 

diligence and competence. However, due to several fortuitous events and 

government-mandated strict community quarantine, timely submission of the 

financial reports and other documentary requirements to your office were not met. 

 

To ensure the safety of the employees against COVID 19, they will 

implement alternative work arrangements to minimize exposure of the employees 

but at the same time take the necessary (extra) steps to ensure timely submission of 

reports for audit.

2. Compliance Audit on the Monitoring and Inspection Activities on Film Showing 
in Movie Theaters in Metro Manila 

 

The MTRCB was created on October 5, 1985 by virtue of Presidential 

Decree (PD) No. 1986. MTRCB is mandated, among others, to screen, review and 

examine all motion pictures, television programs, including publicity materials 

such as advertisements, trailers and stills. 

 

In addition to the review and classification of materials and of other powers 

and duties vested by law to the MTRCB (Board), Section 13 of PD No. 1986 

mandates the Board or its duly authorized representatives to inspect all public 

exhibitions of any motion pictures or publicity material in movie houses, theaters 

and other public establishments.  In order to effectively perform the inspection and 

monitoring duties, Members of the Board and staff must actually visit a movie 

house and watch a movie and/or a television program. 

 

Audit on the MTRCB monitoring and inspection activities on films showing 

in movie theaters in Metro Manila for the period May 2019 to March 2020 disclosed 

compliance lapses/deficiencies of its existing rules and polices thereof as discussed 

below. 

 

Reimbursements of regular cinema tickets instead of using the MTRCB board 

pass 

 

2.1 Inconsistent with the existing policy to use MRTCB board pass to support 
claims of reimbursement on monitoring expenses, regular cinema tickets 

totaling P46,000.00 were used instead by the MTRCB Board and deputized 

members. Moreover, cinema tickets attached to the monitoring report 

totaling P6,000.00 were submitted five (5) months to one (1) year after use, 

which is beyond the prescribed period of every 25th day of the month. 

 

The MTRCB Board and all deputized members were issued with 

identification cards allowing access free of charge to movie-house showings, 

except for premier and special shows. Upon entry, movie houses issue movie tickets 

to any deputized member using the identification cards, which indicated there-in 

the title of the movie, date and schedule of the movie watched.  These tickets are 

then presented to the MTRCB as proof of their monitoring activities. 

 

Stated in the accompanying rules of the Deputy Card is the access of a 

Deputy to cinemas, together with one companion, in the performance of his 

monitoring and inspection duties, without having to pay admission fees.  

 

Regular cinema tickets are those issued to paying patrons/clients. As of date, 

no MTRCB internal policy/rules are issued allowing the use of regular tickets as 

proof of monitoring activities. 

 



40 
 

The table below shows the use of regular cinema tickets as support to claims 

of reimbursement on monitoring expenses, inconsistent with the existing policy on 

privileges of an MTRCB Deputy:

Total 46x P 46,000.00 6x P 6,000.00 

 

The use of regular tickets to claim for reimbursement is unacceptable 

because of the impossibility to prove who actually used the tickets. Moreover, it is 

a deviation from the MTRCB rules.  It was also observed that some of the tickets 

attached to the monitoring reports were submitted five (5) months to one (1) year 

from the activities, which was beyond the prescribed period provided for in 

MTRCB Administrative Circular No. 004-2019 dated June 3, 2019 of every 25th 

day of the month, unless with the express written approval of the Chairperson of 

the Board.  

 

We recommended that Management revisit its guidelines on 

reimbursement of expenses for monitoring and inspection activities of its 

deputies, and revisions if needed to provide exceptions for the guidance of all 

concerned.  As it is, if warranted, for the concerned Board Members (BMs) to 

refund the amount received for the corresponding unsuitably supported 

reimbursement/s. 

 

In comment, Management stated that as part of the monitoring functions of 

MTRCB’s BMs, there are some exceptions where in the Board used regular cinema 

tickets as follows: 

 

 the BMs sometimes conducted a surprise inspection of movie-houses and 
do not identify themselves as deputy agents of MTRCB and purchase 

regular cinema tickets as if they were civilian. 

 

The surprise inspection done by the BMs can effectively determine if the 

movie-houses are operating properly.  There are times where violations 



41 
 

were found during the surprise inspection and most of the time, this 

procedure is effective since the movie-houses are not aware that they are 

being inspected and visited by MTRCB Deputy Agents. 

 

 in cases when there are still no paying patrons for the specific screening 
time chosen by the agents/deputies, they are required to pay for regular 

cinema tickets to push through with the inspection. 

 

The regular tickets mentioned above are properly supported with the 

required movie and television monitoring report.  Consequently, we can 

discuss with the Board and Management to come up with a policy that in 

case regular cinema tickets are used, the name of the deputy/agents who 

conducted the inspection should also be identified. 

 

For the cinema tickets submitted beyond the prescribed period, this case 

rarely happens.  Upon re-validation of documents, we agree that there are 

few tickets submitted beyond the prescribed period.  We will discuss this 

with the BMs and to the officer in-charge in monitoring of reports of BMs 

to double check the tickets submitted. 

 

With this, we will request the BMs to refund the amount for the tickets 

submitted beyond the prescribed period.  

 

The Audit Team noted Management comments, but existing policies on 

reimbursement of expenses for monitoring activities and period of submission of 

its reports still prevailed, until repealed/amended.    

 

 

Non-maximization of Monitoring Activities Due to Repetitive Visits to 

Movies/Movie houses 

 

2.2 Monitoring and inspection duties of MTRCB deputies were not 
maximized to cover as many as possible movie-houses and movies shown 

in cinemas that needed to be reviewed and inspected since visits were 

repeatedly done on same dates and cinemas in a day incurring at least 

P753,000.00 in monitoring expenses from May 2019 to March 2020 as 

there was no clear guidelines on the number of inspection and monitoring 

each deputy has to undertake within a day.  

 

BMs are authorized to travel, subject to specific guidelines, to perform the 

MTRCB Deputies’ monitoring and inspection duties by visiting a movie-house and 

actually watching a movie or television program. Review and verification of the 

approved itinerary of travel and the supporting movie tickets, revealed the

Total  185 68 30 11 294 73 221 294 753,000.00 

 

As shown in the preceding Table, the monitoring and inspection duties of 

BMs were not maximized since their repetitive visits were to the same movie and 

movie-house, considering that the number of movies shown in cinemas needing 

review and inspection have significantly increased; thus impacting of agency’s 

resources (money, time, manpower). 

 

We recommended that Management formulate guidelines on the 

selection of the movies and movie-houses for inspection and monitoring of its 

deputies to maximize resources. 

  

In comment, Management stated that as per documents submitted for 

reimbursement, there were scenarios wherein the movies were repeated but the 

screening time and location of movie houses are different. 

 

There were times that movie-houses have multiple screening times for one 

movie especially if it is a blockbuster movie and chances are some deputy agents/ 

BMs visit the same movie-house but different screening time.  Moreover, one 

movie with multiple screening time does not necessarily mean that no violations 

will be found all time.  There are cases that violations were identified in one screen 

time and others have no violation that is why it can be allowed to monitor the same 

movies. 

 

We will also review our guidelines on monitoring and inspection to ensure 

that our duties and responsibilities are being maximized. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



43 
 

Insufficient documentation of reimbursement payments 

 

2.3 Documents to support the reimbursement of the BMs’ monitoring 
expenses for the months of May 2019 to March 2020 totaling 

P1,570,000.00 lacked complete details, signatures, and monthly Cinema 

Monitoring Report (CMR) to determine the validity of the expenses. 

 

MTRCB AC No. 004-2019 provides that “for claim of daily travel expenses, 

Board Members and staff shall submit a monthly Cinema Monitoring Report and 

Television Monitoring Report in the prescribed form.  The Cinema Monitoring 

Report shall be supported with an itinerary of travel and the appropriate movie 

ticket, and shall clearly indicate the name of cinema, title of movie, time and date 

of inspection, and the inspection finding.” 

 

Our verification of the various transactions covering the months of May 

2019 to March 2020 showed that claims totaling P1,570,000.00 were paid despite 

the insufficiency of supporting documents e.g., improperly filled-up monitoring 

report, no remarks given on the inspection date, lacking required signatures of the 

BMs on the itinerary of travels, absence of monthly CMR.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed that the Accountant ensure 

that all claims are supported with complete documentation before payments 

are made. 
 

 

B. Others 
 

Gender and Development (GAD) Plans and Programs 
 

3. MTRCB had formulated a GAD Plan designed to address gender issues for 
FY 2020 through integration in the Agency’s regular activities and spent a 

total cost of P756,105.40, which represented only 0.71 percent of its total 

appropriations of P105,113,000.00 because of the cancellation of scheduled 

activities due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

 

Section 31 of the General Provisions (GP) of RA No. 11465 or the General 

Appropriations Act (GAA) for FY 2020, requires that: 

 

All agencies of the government shall formulate a GAD Plan  

designed  to  address  gender  issues  within their concerned  

sectors  or  mandate  and  implement applicable provisions under 

R.A. 9170 or the Magna Carta of Women, Convention on the 

Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the 

Beijing Platform  for  Action,  the  Millennium  Development 

Goals  (2000-2015),  the Philippine Plan for Gender- 

Responsive Development, (1995-2025), and the Philippine 



44 
 

Development Plan. The GAD plan shall be integrated in the 

regular activities of the agencies, which shall be at least five 

percent (5%) of their   respective   budgets.   For   this   purpose.   

xxx activities that contribute to poverty alleviation, economic 

empowerment xxx are considered sufficient compliance with 

said requirement.  Utilization of the GAD budget shall be 

evaluated based on the GAD performance indicators identified 

by the said agency. 

Of the seven GAD planned activities, only three was partially accomplished 

by MTRCB because of the cancellation of scheduled activities due to the 

emergence of COVID-19 in the country and following the guidelines set forth by 

the national government through the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management 

of Infectious Disease (IATF-MEID), incurring actual expenses of P756,105.40 or 

only 0.71 percent of the total appropriations of P105,113,000.00, as shown below:

2001, relative to the remittance of all taxes withheld on gross compensation income 

from officials and employees for the current year and on taxes withheld from 

private entities regarding government purchases and contracts for services. 

 

For the year, the taxes withheld and remitted to BIR totaled P3,262,440.33. The 

TRAs were supported with properly accomplished Withholding Tax Returns filed 

with the Bureau of Internal Revenue on or before the 10th day of the following 

month. 

 

 

Compliance with GSIS Premium Deductions and Remittances (RA No. 8291) 

 

7. For CY 2020, MTRCB remitted all withheld amounts due to the GSIS on or before 
the 10th day of the succeeding month.  Total amount remitted for the year amounted 

to P3,296,946.22 of which P3,147,993.51 was remitted as of December 31, 2020 

leaving a balance of P148,952.71, which was remitted in January 2021.
