D. Scope of Audit 
 

The audit covered the accounts and operations of MTRCB for CY 2020.  It 

was conducted to: (a) ascertain the level of assurance that may be placed on the 

Management’s assertion on the financial statements; (b) determine the propriety of 

transactions as well as extent of compliance on the applicable laws, rules and 

regulations; and (c) determine the extent of implementation of prior year’s audit 

recommendations. Moreover, the audit was conducted in accordance with 

International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAIs). 

 

 

E. Auditor’s Report of the Financial Statements 
 

The Auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of 

the financial statements as at December 31, 2020 due to the non-submission of 

Disbursement Vouchers (DVs) for audit covering the months of November to 

December 2020 totaling P22,653,795.66, which is equivalent to 33 percent of the 

total disbursements for the year of P69,401,254.30.

F. Summary of Other Significant Observations and Recommendations 
 

The following are the other significant audit observations and corresponding 

recommendations:  

 

1. Inconsistent with the existing policy to use MRTCB board pass to support 
claims of reimbursement on monitoring expenses, regular cinema tickets 

totaling P46,000.00 were used instead by the MTRCB Board and deputized 

members. Moreover, cinema tickets attached to the monitoring report totaling 

P6,000.00 were submitted five (5) months to one (1) year after use, which is 

beyond the prescribed period of every 25th day of the month. (Paragraph No. 

2.1) 

 

We recommended that Management revisit its guidelines on reimbursement of 

expenses for monitoring and inspection activities of its deputies, and revisions 

if needed to provide exceptions for the guidance of all concerned.  As it is, if 

warranted, for the concerned Board Members (BMs) to refund the amount 

received for the corresponding unsuitably supported reimbursement/s. 

 

2. Monitoring and inspection duties of MTRCB deputies were not maximized to 
cover as many as possible movie-houses and movies shown in cinemas that 

needed to be reviewed and inspected since visits were repeatedly done on same 

dates and cinemas in a day incurring at least P753,000.00 in monitoring 

expenses from May 2019 to March 2020 as there was no clear guidelines on the 

number of inspection and monitoring each deputy has to undertake within a day. 

(Paragraph No. 2.2) 

 

We recommended that Management formulate guidelines on the selection of 

the movies and movie-houses for inspection and monitoring of its deputies to 

maximize resources. 

 

3. Documents to support the reimbursement of the BMs’ monitoring expenses for 
the months of May 2019 to March 2020 totaling P1,570,000.00 lacked complete 

details, signatures, and monthly Cinema Monitoring Report (CMR), 

invalidating the expenses. (Paragraph No. 2.3) 

 

We recommended and Management agreed that the Accountant ensure that all 

claims are supported with complete documentation before payments are made. 

 

The above findings and recommendations were discussed with Management 

officials concerned in an exit conference held on May 6, 2021.  Management views 

and comments were considered in the report, where appropriate. The details of the 

above observations were discussed in Part II of this report.
