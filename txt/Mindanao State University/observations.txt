EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

A. INTRODUCTION 

 

By virtue of Republic Act (RA) No. 1387, as amended by RA Nos. 1893 and 3868, 

Mindanao State University (MSU) was created.  The university was organized in 1961 with the 

election of the first president by its newly formed Board of Regents (BOR), the governing body of 

the university. 

 

MSU General Santos City has been operating as a community college since 1971 before it 

became a full pledged unit and integral part of the MSU Marawi City through BOR Resolution No. 

822, s. of 1973.  It was given full autonomy in 1981 through BOR Resolution No. 60 which 

approved the reorganization of MSU General Santos City, with its main campus at Fatima, General 

Santos City. 

 

The University through its functions of instruction, research and extension services shall 

provide its client communities the trained human resources required for the development of various 

provinces in Mindanao.  Currently, the university is headed by a Chancellor, Anshari P. Ali, Ph.D., 

and assisted by Vice-Chancellors for Academic Affairs, Administration and Finance and Research 

and Extension.

E.  AUDITOR’S OPINION 
 

 The Auditor rendered a modified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the financial 

statements of the MSU for CY 2020, in view of the effects of the material exceptions observed in 

the course of the audit which are stated in the Independent Auditor’s Report and discussed in detail 

under Part II of same report. 

 

F. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

I.   Favorable Observations 
 

1. The University has effectively adopted the alternative mode of learning through the conduct of 

online classes for the students as a proactive step during this time of pandemic. 
  

2. Compliant on the maintenance and posting to their official website of the Transparency Seal as 

mandated in Section 94 of RA No. 11465 or the General Appropriation Act, Fiscal Year 2020. 

 

II.  The following are the significant audit observations with their corresponding 

recommendations: 
 

1. Supplies and Materials amounting to ₱9,272,824.61 were directly issued to end users and 

treated as outright expense without coursing through the inventory account as prescribed under 

Manual on the NGAS. 
 

 We recommended that the management instruct the Accounting Office and the Supply 

Management Office (SMO) to coordinate closely for the implementation of perpetual 

inventory method in the recording of Inventories to ensure proper accounting and 

promote better control in the receipt and issuance of supplies and materials. 
 

 Moreover, the management shall direct the accounting office to establish the necessary 

ledger cards for each inventory while the SMO shall religiously submit its RCPI to the 

former so that necessary adjustment or appropriate action could be effected. 
 

2.  Insurance premiums were treated as outright expenses due to non-preparation of the required 

adjusting entry for the unexpired portion at year-end, thereby understating the Prepaid 

Insurance and Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) by ₱759,533.89.  Further, government properties 

amounting to ₱83,971,165.74 remained not insured with the GSIS exposing these properties to 

unnecessary risk. 



iii 

 

 We recommended that Management: (a) Strictly adopt the accrual basis of accounting 

by requiring the Accounting Office to regularly recognize the unexpired portion of any 

expense at year-end for the purpose of achieving fair presentation of the agency’s 

Financial Statements, in accordance with the prescribed rules and regulations; (b) 

Prepare the necessary adjusting entries to correct the balances of the affected accounts; 

(c) Revisit Administrative Order No. 33 and COA Circular No. 92-390 and prepare and 

submit inventory reports of all insurable properties to GSIS to ensure that all insurable 

assets and properties are adequately covered/insured with the General Insurance Fund 

of the GSIS to properly protect the government properties in the event of serious loss 

such as fire, earthquake, typhoon and/or flood; and (d) Provide a budget for the insurance 

of all insurable properties pursuant to the provisions of RA No. 656, Property Insurance 

Law, to protect the interest of the government and to be indemnified for any damage or 

loss that may arise. 
 

3. Unobligated prior period expenses paid during the year totaling ₱618,063.43 were charged 

against current year’s appropriations. Moreover, various disbursements totaling 

₱16,561,232.65 were erroneously treated as Salaries and Wages-Regular instead of their 

appropriate expense accounts, contrary to PD 1445 and COA Circular. 
 

 We recommended that Management direct the Accounting Office to: (a) Adopt regularly 

the accrual basis of accounting by taking up in the books the expenditures and obligations 

during the year they are incurred so as to reflect the correct expenses in the financial 

statement of the year under audit; (b) Adhere to the provisions of P.D. 1445 in the use of 

appropriations to prevent the incurrence of irregular expenditures; (c) Classify the 

transactions to their appropriate expense and asset accounts for the purpose of achieving 

accurate presentation of the agency’s Financial Statements, in accordance with the 

prescribed rules and regulations; and (d) Prepare the necessary adjusting entries to 

correct the balances of the affected asset accounts. 
 

4. Fund transfers from various NGAs totaling ₱10,299,939.01 remained unreturned and/or 

unliquidated despite the completion of projects contrary to COA Circular No. 94-013 and 

related Memoranda of Agreement, thus exposing the remaining funds to possible 

misappropriation or misapplication. 
 

 We recommended that the Management: (a) Require the respective Project-in-Charge (i) 

exert earnest efforts to complete the preparation of the Final or Terminal Reports for 

each of the completed projects for submission to the Accountant; and (ii) cause the 

immediate completion of the remaining projects for the eventual settlement of the funds 

received from source agencies; (b) Remind the Accounting Office (i) record the 

liquidations submitted by the Project-in-Charge; and (ii) submit the 

Liquidation/Terminal Reports and refund the excess project funds to the source agencies; 

(c) Ensure that all Memoranda of Agreement entered into by the University with other 

agencies contains all necessary information at all times. 
 

5.  Various completed projects amounting to ₱26,530,181.01 were not reclassified from CIP to 

appropriate PPE account thus, failing to account for the depreciation charges and affecting the 

income and expense accounts for CY 2020 contrary to Section 41 of the New Government 

Accounting System (NGAS). 
 

 We recommended that Management: (a) Ensure the coordination between the 

Accounting Office and the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Administration and Finance 

regarding completed projects so that there is proper recording in the book of accounts; 



iv 

 

(b) Instruct the Accounting Office to closely monitor the items in the CIP, reclassify 

completed projects to their appropriate asset accounts and record the corresponding 

depreciation expenses; (c) Take immediate actions to resolve pending issues and concerns 

of projects which remain in the CIP account for a long period of time, actual status of 

which are still for verification by the University. 

 

6. GAD Plan and Budget was not approved and furnished to PCW, DBM and other government 

agencies.  Likewise, allocated budget for GAD PPAs amounted only to ₱1,049,500.00 or 

0.29% of its total budget.  These were in disregard of RA 9710 and PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint 

Circular thus, it failed to mainstream gender perspectives and address gender related concerns. 

 

 We recommended that the management: (a) Require the GAD Focal Point of the 

University to follow the set deadlines and submit the agency’s GAD Plan and Budget to 

CHED who will review and forward the same to PCW and DBM for approval to ensure 

that the GAD programs/projects/activities therein address gender issues, in accordance 

with the existing regulations and guidelines on the preparation of Annual GAD Plan and 

Budget and Accomplishment Report; (b) Use the GAD Plan and Budget in the 

formulation of the GAD AR and to attach the documents required in PCW-NEDA-DBM 

Joint Circular 2012-01 to facilitate the monitoring and evaluation of the GAD PPAs 

implemented during the year; (c)  Allocate 5% of the GAA for GAD Budget; and (d) 

Monitor and assess the mainstreaming of gender perspectives in the implementation of 

University’s major and attributed PPAs.

Mindanao State University – General Santos City 

For the year ended December 31, 2020 

 

 

PPSAS 1 

1. General Information/Agency Profile 
 

Mindanao State University – General Santos City (MSU-GSC) started as a 

community high school in 1967, six years after the creation of MSU-

Marawi main campus.  The high school was housed inside Dadiangas West 

Elementary School, a school located in the middle of General Santos City. 

To accommodate the growing number of students, the administration 

facilitated the approval of 3.3 hectare land donation of General Santos City 

Local Government located at the heart of general Santos for the MSU-High 

School.  By virtue of the Board of Regents Resolution No. 822 it became a 

full-fledged collegiate campus of the MSU system on October 10, 1973 

offering two year degree courses. 

 

Through Presidential Proclamation 2029 in 1983, a 156 hectare land 

located at Fatima (previously called Barangay Tambler), was acquired. 

This led to the growth of MSU-GSC in offering various degree programs. 

Since then, MSU-GSC has been characterized by its continuing 

commitment and dedication to the communities it serves through its three 

functions of instruction, research and extension.  The Fatima campus 

houses administrative offices, various colleges in Agriculture, Education, 

Fisheries, Arts and Sciences, Engineering, Business Administration and 

Accountancy and all other academic units and other facilities.  Aside from 

undergraduate courses, post Baccalaureate in Education, public 

Administration and Law are being offered in response to the demand and 

needs of the teachers, Government workers and other professionals in the 

locality. 

 

The financial statements of Mindanao State University in General Santos 

City were authorized for issue on March 12, 2021 as shown in the 

Statement of Management Responsibility for Financial Statements signed 

by Anshari P. Ali, Ph.D, the Chancellor of the University.

3.1 Basis of accounting 
 

The financial statements are prepared on an accrual basis in accordance 

with the Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standards (PPSAS) 

 

 

 

 

PPSAS 1,

3.2 Financial instruments 
 

a. Financial assets 
 

Initial recognition and measurement 

The MSU-GSC’s financial assets include: Receivables-

Disallowances/Charges, Due from Officers and Employees, and 

Advances to Special Disbursing Officer, Officers and Employees and 

Contractors and initially recognized at cost. 

 

Subsequent measurement 

Receivables and advances are non-derivative financial assets with fixed 

or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.  After 

initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at 

cost.  Losses arising from impairment are recognized in the surplus or 

deficit. 

 

Derecognition 

The MSU-GSC derecognizes a financial asset or, where applicable, a 

part of a financial asset or part of a MSU-GSC of similar financial 

assets when: 

 The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired or are 
waived 

 The MSU-GSC has transferred its rights to receive cash flows 
from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received 

cash flows in full without material delay to a third party; and 

either: (a) the MSU-GSC has transferred substantially all the risks 

and rewards of the asset; or (b) the MSU-GSC has neither 

transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of 

the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.

Impairment of financial assets 

The MSU-GSC assesses at each reporting date whether there is 

objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is 

impaired.  A financial asset or a group of financial assets is deemed to 

be impaired if, and only if, there is objective evidence of impairment as 

a result of one or more events that has occurred after the initial 

recognition of the asset (an incurred “loss event”) and that loss event 

has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset 

or the group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated. 

 

Evidence of impairment may include the following indicators: 

 The debtors or a group of debtors are experiencing significant financial 
difficulty 

 Default or delinquency in interest or principal payments 

 The probability that debtors will enter bankruptcy or other financial 
reorganization 

 Observable data indicates a measurable decrease in estimated future 
cash flows (e.g. changes in arrears or economic conditions that 

correlate with defaults) 

 

b. Financial liabilities 
 

Initial recognition and measurement 

The MSU-GSC’s financial assets include: Accounts Payable, Due to 

BIR, NGAs, and LGUs, Trust Liabilities, Guaranty Deposits, and Other 

Payables.  These were initially recognized at cost. 

 

Subsequent measurement 

After initial recognition, payables and dues are subsequently measured 

at cost. 

 

Derecognition 

A financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the 

liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.

Cash and cash equivalents comprise Cash-Collecting Officer, Petty 

Cash Fund, Cash in Bank-Local Currency, and Cash-Modified 

Disbursement System.Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid 

investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash with 

original maturities of three months or less from dates of placement and 

that are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value and are free 

of any encumbrances.

The University maintains three major funds as follows; 

 General Fund 101 

 Trust Fund 161 

 Special Trust Fund 164 
 

3.4 Inventories 
 

Inventory is measured at cost upon initial recognition.  To the extent that 

inventory was received through non-exchange transactions (for no cost or 

for a nominal cost), the cost of inventory is its fair value at the date of 

acquisition. 

 

Inventories comprising from agricultural produce that the university has 

harvested from its biological assets will be measured on initial 

recognition at their fair value less costs to sell at the point of harvest. 

 

Cost incurred in bringing each product to its present location and 

conditions are accounted for in a First-in First-out (FIFO) basis. 

 

After initial recognition, inventory is measured at the lower of cost and 

net realizable value.  However, to the extent that a class of inventory is 

distributed or deployed at no charge or for a nominal charge, that class of 

inventory is measured at the lower of cost and current replacement cost. 

 

Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course 

of operations, less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated 

costs necessary to make the sale, exchange, or distribution.  Inventories 

are recognized as an expense when deployed for utilization or 

consumption in the ordinary course of operations of the MSU-GSC.

3.5 Property, Plant and Equipment 
 

Recognition 

An item is recognized as property, plant, and equipment (PPE) if it meets 

the characteristics and recognition criteria as a PPE. 

 

The characteristics of PPE are as follows: 

 tangible items; 

 are held for use in the production or supply of goods or services, for 
rental to others, or for administrative purposes; and 

 are expected to be used during more than one reporting period. 
 

An item of PPE is recognized as an asset if: 

 It is probable that future economic benefits or service potential 
associated with the item will flow to the entity; and 

 The cost or fair value of the item can be measured reliably.

 Beneficial ownership and control clearly rest with the government 

 The asset is used to achieve the government objectives; and  

 It meets the capitalization threshold of ₱15,000.00 
 

The capitalization threshold of ₱15,000.00 represents the minimum 

cost of an individual asset recognized as a PPE on the Financial 

Position. 

 Items with individual values below the threshold but 
which work together in the form of a group of network 

asset whose total value exceeds the threshold shall be 

recognized as part of the primary PPE. 

 This threshold shall be applied on an individual asset or 
per item basis.  Each within the bulk acquisition or total 

value of PPE will need to meet the capitalization 

threshold to be recognized as PPE. 

 

Measurement at Recognition 

An item recognized as property, plant, and equipment is measured at cost. 

A PPE acquired through non-exchange transaction is measured at its fair 

value as at the date of acquisition.  The cost of the PPE is the cash price 

equivalent or, for PPE acquired through non-exchange transaction its cost 

is its fair value as at recognition date. 

 

Cost includes the following: 

 

 Its purchase price, including import duties and non-refundable purchase 
taxes, after deducting trade discounts and rebates; 

 expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items; and 

 initial estimate of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and 
restoring the site on which it is located, the obligation for which an entity 

incurs either when the item is acquired, or as a consequence of having 

used the item during a particular period for purposes other than to 

produce inventories during that period. 

 

Measurement After Recognition 

After recognition, all property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less 

accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. 

 

When significant parts of property, plant and equipment are required to 

be replaced at intervals, the MSU-GSC recognizes such parts as 

individual assets with specific useful lives and depreciates them 

accordingly.  Likewise, when a major repair/replacement is done, its cost 

is recognized in the carrying amount of the plant and equipment as a 

replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied.  All other repair and 

maintenance costs are recognized as expense in surplus or deficit as 

incurred.

Depreciation 

Each part of an item of property, plant, and equipment with a cost that is 

significant in relation to the total cost of the item is depreciated 

separately.  The depreciation charge for each period is recognized as 

expense unless it is included in the cost of another asset. 
 

Initial Recognition of Depreciation 

Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use such as when 

it is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of 

operating in the manner intended by management.  For simplicity and to 

avoid proportionate computation, the depreciation started on the 

succeeding month after the purchase or acquisition of property. 
 

Depreciation Method 

The straight line method of depreciation is adopted unless another 

method is more appropriate for agency operation. 
 

Estimated Useful Life 

The MSU-GSC depreciates its Property, Plant and Equipment with 

estimated useful life of different categories as follows: 
 

The MSU-GSC uses a residual value equivalent to at least five percent 

(5%) of the cost of the PPE. 

 

Impairment 

An asset’s carrying amount is written down to its recoverable amount, or 

recoverable service amount, if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than 

its estimated recoverable service amount. 
 

Derecognition 

The MSU-GSC derecognizes items of property, plant and equipment 

and/or any significant part of an asset upon disposal or when no future 

economic benefits or service potential is expected from its continuing 

use.  Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as 

the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount 

of the asset) is included in the surplus or deficit when the asset is 

derecognized. 

 Estimated Useful Life 

Land Improvements - Over the useful life of the asset to 

which the improvement was made or 

the useful life of the improvement is 

significantly shorter  

Infrastructure Assets - 20 to 50 years 

Buildings and Other Structures - 30 to 50 years 

Machinery and Equipment - 5 to 15 years 

Transportation Equipment - 5 to 15 years 

Furniture, Fixtures and Books - 2 to 15 years 

Other Property, Plant and Equipment - 2 to 15 years

3.6 Agriculture 

 

Recognition 

An item is recognized a biological asset or agricultural produce when 

and only when: 

a. The entity controls the asset as a result of past events; 

b. It is probable that future economic benefits or service potential 

associated with the asset will flow to the entity; and 

c. The fair value or cost of the asset can be measured reliably. 

 

Measurement 
A biological asset shall be measured on initial recognition and at each 

reporting date at its fair value less costs to sell, except where market-

determined prices or values are not available, and for which alternative 

estimates of fair value are determined to be clearly unreliable.  In such 

a case, that biological asset shall be measured at its cost less any 

accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. 

 

In determining cost, accumulated depreciation and accumulated 

impairment losses, an entity considers policies on Inventories, Property, 

Plant and Equipment, Impairment of Non-Cash- Generating Assets and 

Impairment of Cash-Generating Assets. 

 

In all cases, agricultural produce harvested from an entity’s biological 

assets shall be measured at its fair value less costs to sell at the point of 

harvest.  Such measurement is the cost at that date when applying 

PPSAS 12-Inventories or another applicable Standard. 

 

Gain or Loss 

A gain or loss arising on initial recognition of a biological asset at fair 

value less costs to sell and from a change in fair value less costs to sell 

of a biological asset shall be included in surplus or deficit for the period 

in which it arises.  Likewise, a gain or loss arising on initial recognition 

of agricultural produce at fair value less costs to sell shall be included 

in surplus or deficit for the period in which it arises.

3.7 Leases 
 

MSU-GSC as a lessee 

 

Operating lease 

Operating leases are leases that do not transfer substantially all the risks 

and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item to the MSU-

GSC.  Operating lease payments are recognized as an operating 

expense in surplus or deficit on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 

 

 

 

 

 

PPSAS 

13.42 

 

 

 

 



17 

 

MSU-GSC as a lessor 

 

Operating Lease 

Leases in which the MSU-GSC does not transfer substantially all the 

risks and benefits of ownership of an asset are classified as operating 

leases.  

 

Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating an operating lease are added 

to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognized over the lease 

term.  

 

Rent received from an operating lease is recognized as income on a 

straight-line basis over the lease term.  Contingent rents are recognized 

as revenue in the period in which they are earned.  The depreciation 

policy for PPE is applied to similar assets leased by the entity. 

 

3.8 Provisions 

 

Provisions were recognized when the MSU-GSC has a present 

obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is 

probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits or 

service potential will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable 

estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. 

 

Where the MSU-GSC expects some or all of a provision to be 

reimbursed, for example, under an insurance contract, the 

reimbursement is recognized as a separate asset only when the 

reimbursement is virtually certain. 

 

The expense relating to any provision is presented in the statement of 

financial performance net of any reimbursement. 

 

Provisions were reviewed at each reporting date, and adjusted to reflect 

the current best estimate.  If it is no longer probable that an outflow of 

resources embodying economic benefits or service potential will be 

required to settle the obligation, the provisions were reversed. 

 

Contingent liabilities 

The MSU-GSC does not recognize a contingent liability, but discloses 

details of any contingencies in the notes to the financial statements, 

unless the possibility of an outflow of resources embodying economic 

benefits or service potential is remote.

Contingent assets 

The MSU-GSC does not recognize a contingent asset, but discloses 

details of a possible asset whose existence is contingent on the 

occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events 

not wholly within the control of the MSU-GSC in the notes to the 

financial statements. 

 

Contingent assets were assessed continually to ensure that 

developments were appropriately reflected in the financial statements. 

If it has become virtually certain that an inflow of economic benefits or 

service potential will arise and the asset’s value can be measured 

reliably, the asset and the related revenue are recognized in the 

financial statements of the period in which the change occurs. 

3.9 Changes in accounting policies and estimates 
 

The MSU-GSC recognizes the effects of changes in accounting policy 

retrospectively.  The effects of changes in accounting policy were 

applied prospectively if retrospective application is impractical. 
 

The MSU-GSC recognizes the effects of changes in accounting 

estimates prospectively by including in surplus or deficit. 
 

The MSU-GSC correct material prior period errors retrospectively in 

the first set of financial statements authorized for issue after their 

discovery by: 

 Restating the comparative amounts for prior period(s) presented 
in which the error occurred; or 

 If the error occurred before the earliest prior period presented, 
restating the opening balances of assets, liabilities and net 

assets/equity for the earliest prior period presented.

3.10 Revenue from non-exchange transactions 
 

Recognition and Measurement of Assets from Non-Exchange 

Transactions 

An inflow of resources from a non-exchange transaction, other than 

services in-kind, that meets the definition of an asset were recognized 

as an asset if the following criteria were met: 
 

 It is probable that the future economic benefits or service 
potential associated with the asset will flow to the entity; and 

 The fair value of the asset can be measured reliably. 
 

An asset acquired through a non-exchange transaction is initially 

measured at its fair value as at the date of acquisition.

Recognition Revenue from Non-Exchange Transactions 

An inflow of resources from a non-exchange transaction recognized as 

an asset is recognized as revenue, except to the extent that a liability is 

also recognized in respect of the same inflow. 

 

As MSU-GSC satisfies a present obligation recognized as a liability in 

respect of an inflow of resources from a non-exchange transaction 

recognized as an asset, it reduces the carrying amount of the liability 

recognized and recognizes an amount of revenue equal to that 

reduction. 

 

Measurement of Revenue from Non-Exchange Transactions 

Revenue from non-exchange transactions is measured at the amount of 

the increase in net assets recognized by the entity, unless a 

corresponding liability is recognized. 

 
Measurement of Liabilities on Initial Recognition from Non-Exchange 

Transactions 

The amount recognized as a liability in a non-exchange transaction is 

the best estimate of the amount required to settle the present obligation 

at the reporting date. 

 
Fees and fines not related to taxes 

The University recognizes revenues from fees and fines, except those 

related to taxes, when earned and the asset recognition criteria were 

met.  Deferred income is recognized instead of revenue if there is a 

related condition attached that would give rise to a liability to repay the 

amount. 

 

Other non-exchange revenues were recognized when it is probable that 

the future economic benefits or service potential associated with the 

asset will flow to the entity and the fair value of the asset can be 

measured reliably. 
 

Gifts and Donations 

The University recognizes assets and revenue from gifts and donations 

when it is probable that the future economic benefits or service 

potential will flow to the entity and the fair value of the assets can be 

measured reliably. 

 

Goods in-kind were recognized as assets when the goods were received, 

or there is a binding arrangement to receive the goods. If goods in-kind 

were received without conditions attached, revenue is recognized 

immediately.  If conditions were attached, a liability is recognized, 

which is reduced and revenue recognized as the conditions were 

satisfied.

On initial recognition, gifts and donations including goods in-kind were 

measured at their fair value as at the date of acquisition, which were 

ascertained by reference to an active market, or by appraisal.  An 

appraisal of the value of an asset is normally undertaken by a member 

of the valuation profession who holds a recognized and relevant 

professional qualification.  For many assets, the fair value was 

ascertained by reference to quoted prices in an active and liquid market. 
 

Transfers 

The MSU-GSC recognizes an asset in respect of transfers when the 

transferred resources meet the definition of an asset and satisfy the 

criteria for recognition as an asset, except those arising from services 

in-kind. 
 

Services in-Kind 

Services in-kind were not recognized as asset and revenue considering 

the complexity of the determination of and recognition of asset and 

revenue and the eventual recognition of expenses. 
 

Transfers from other government entities 

Revenues from non-exchange transactions with other government 

entities and the related assets were measured at fair value and 

recognized on obtaining control of the asset (cash, goods, services and 

property) if the transfer is free from conditions and it is probable that 

the economic benefits or service potential related to the asset will flow 

to the MSU-GSC and can be measured reliably.

School Fees 

Revenue from fees imposed to students. It includes tuition, registration, 

athletic, cultural, diploma, transcript of recognizes, library, athletic, 

entrance examination fee, comprehensive examination fee and the like.  
 

Clearance and Certification Fees 

This are fees collected for the issuance of clearances/certificates to the 

University’s students and faculties. 
 

Sale of Goods 

Revenue from the sale of goods is recognized when the significant risks 

and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer, usually 

on delivery of the goods and when the amount of revenue can be 

measured reliably and it is probable that the economic benefits or 

service potential associated with the transaction will flow to the MSU-

GSC

Interest income 

Interest income is accrued using the effective yield method.  The 

effective yield discounts estimated future cash receipts through the 

expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net carrying amount. 

The method applies this yield to the principal outstanding to determine 

interest income each period. 
 

Rental income 

Rental income arising from operating leases on investment properties is 

accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease terms and included 

in revenue.

3.12 Budget Information 
 

The annual budget is prepared on a cash basis and is published in the 

government website. 
 

A separate Statement of Comparison of Budget and Actual Amounts 

(SCBAA) was prepared since the budget and the financial statements 

were not prepared on comparable basis.  The SCBAA was presented 

showing the original and final budget and the actual amounts on 

comparable basis to the budget.  Explanatory comments are provided in 

the notes to the annual financial statements.  These budget figures were 

those approved by the governing body both at the beginning and during 

the year following a period of consultation with the public.

3.13 Impairment of Non-Financial Assets 
 

Impairment of cash-generating assets 

At each reporting date, the MSU-GSC assesses whether there is an 

indication that an asset may be impaired.  If any indication exists, or 

when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the MSU-GSC 

estimates the asset’s recoverable amount.  An asset’s recoverable 

amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s fair value 

less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual 

asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that were largely 

independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. 

 

Where the carrying amount of an asset or the cash-generating unit 

(CGU) exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired 

and is written down to its recoverable amount. 

 

In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows were 

discounted to their present value using a discount rate that reflects 

current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks 

specific to the asset.  In determining fair value less costs to sell, recent 

market transactions were taken into account, if available.  If no such 

transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used.

For assets, an assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether 

there is any indication that previously recognized impairment losses 

may no longer exist or may have decreased.  If such indication exists, 

the MSU-GSC estimates the asset’s or cash-generating unit’s 

recoverable amount. 

 

A previously recognized impairment loss is reversed only if there has 

been a change in the assumptions used to determine the asset’s 

recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognized.  The 

reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not 

exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that 

would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment 

loss been recognized for the asset in prior years.  Such reversal is 

recognized in surplus or deficit. 

 

Impairment of non-cash-generating assets 

The MSU-GSC assesses at each reporting date whether there is an 

indication that a non-cash-generating asset may be impaired.  If any 

indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is 

required, the MSU-GSC estimates the asset’s recoverable service 

amount.  An asset’s recoverable service amount is the higher of the 

non-cash generating asset’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in 

use. 

 

Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable service 

amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its 

recoverable service amount.  The MSU-GSC classifies assets as cash-

generating assets when those assets were held with the primary 

objective generating a commercial return.  Therefore, non-cash 

generating assets would be those assets from which the MSU-GSC does 

not intend (as its primary objective) to realize a commercial return.

3.14 Related Parties 

 

The MSU-GSC regards a related party as a person or an entity with the 

ability to exert control individually or jointly, or to exercise significant 

influence over the MSU-GSC, or vice versa. 

 

Members of key management were regarded as related parties and 

comprise the members of the Planning and Management Committee of 

the MSU-GSC such as: the Chancellor, Vice-Chancellor for 

Administrative and Finance, Vice-Chancellor for Academic Affairs, 

Internal Audit System, and Department Heads of the MSU-GSC and its 

controlled entities.

3.15 Employee benefits 

 

The employees of MSU-GSC are member of the Government Service 

Insurance System (GSIS), which provides life and retirement insurance 

coverage.  The MSU-GSC recognizes the undiscounted amount of short 

term employee benefits, like salaries, wages, bonuses, allowance, etc., 

as expense unless capitalized, and as a liability after deducting the 

amount paid. 

 

The MSU-GSC recognizes expenses for accumulating compensated 

absences when these were paid (commuted or paid as terminal leave 

benefits).  Unused entitlements that have accumulated at the reporting 

date were not recognized as expense.  Non-accumulating compensated 

absences, like special leave privileges, were not recognized. 

 

 

 

 

3.15 Measurement uncertainty 

 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with PPSAS 

requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the 

reporting amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent 

assets and liabilities, at the date of the financial statements and the 

reported amounts of the revenues and expenses during the period. 

 

Estimates were based on the best information available at the time of 

preparation of the financial statements and were reviewed annually to 

reflect new information as it becomes available.  Measurement 

uncertainty exists in these financial statements.  Actual results could 

differ from these estimates. 

 

 

4. Changes in Accounting Policies 
 

No new accounting policies were adopted for the year. 

 

 

5. Prior Period Adjustments 
 

The MSU-GSC has determined that there were prior year expenditures 

were liquidated as of the current year and prior disallowances/charges 

were refunded or paid-off by the employees, and adjustments to 

financial statements. 

 

As a result, the following financial line items were affected in current

PART II – OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

 

 

A. FINANCIAL AND COMPLIANCE 
 

1.  Supplies and Materials amounting to ₱9,272,824.61 purchased during the year 

were directly issued to end users and treated as outright expense without coursing 

through the inventory account as prescribed under Section 43 of the Manual on 

the New Government Accounting System (NGAS) for National Government 

Agencies (NGA), Volume I, thus accuracy and correctness of Inventories and 

related expense accounts cannot be ascertained. 

 

 Section 43 of the Manual on the New Government Accounting System for NGAs 

provides: 

 

“Perpetual Inventory Method. Purchase of supplies and materials for 

stock, regardless of whether or not they are consumed within the 

accounting period, shall be recorded as Inventory account. Under the 

perpetual method, an inventory control account is maintained in the 

General Ledger on a current basis.  

 

  Regular purchases shall be recorded under the Inventory account and 

issuance thereof shall be recorded based on the Report of Supplies and 

Materials Issued. Purchases out of the Petty Cash Fund shall be 

charged immediately to the appropriate expense accounts. 

 

 The Accounting Unit shall maintain perpetual inventory records, such 

as the Supplies Ledger Cards for each inventory stock, Property, Plant 

and Equipment Ledger Cards for each category of plant, property and 

equipment including work and other animals, livestock, etc.  The 

subsidiary ledger cards shall contain the details of the General Ledger 

accounts. 

 

 For check and balance, the Property and Supply Office/Unit shall 

maintain Property Cards (PC) for property, plant and equipment, and 

Stock Cards (SC) for inventories.  The balance in quantity per PC and 

SC should always reconcile with the ledger cards of the Accounting 

Unit.” 

 

 Post-audit of CY 2020 transactions revealed that purchases of office supplies, 

accountable forms, drugs and medicines, medical, dental and lab supplies, and other 

supplies were directly issued to end users and treated as outright expenses instead of 

booking them as inventory which is part of the University’s assets. These were charged to 

the following expense accounts: 

 

 



38 

 

 2020 

Office Supplies Expenses ₱2,873,377.65 

Accountable Forms Expenses 12,000.00 

Drugs and Medicines Expenses 57,021.16 

Medical, Dental and Lab Supplies Expense 35,040.00 

Fuel, Oil and Lubricants Expenses 1,207,535.33 

Agricultural and Marine Supplies Expenses 73,190.00 

Semi-Expendable Machinery and Equipment Expenses 768,548.08 

Semi-Expendable Furniture, Fixtures and Books 

Expenses 

1,792,964.32 

Other Supplies and Materials Expenses 2,388,028.07 

Total Supplies and Materials Expenses ₱9,272,824.61 

 

As of year-end of CY 2020, the Inventories account consisted of ₱111,125.00 

which is the same amount as the prior year due to non-reconciliation of records per 

accounting office against that of the SMO.  The latter did not provide data as to the 

issuances during the year which could have been the basis of the accounting office to 

establish the accurate year-end balances of the inventories. 

 

It was noted that even if the University regularly procured various supplies 

including office supplies, drugs and medical supplies, fuel, oil and lubricants, and other 

supplies and materials during the year, there were no inventories indicated for these 

accounts in the balance sheet.  The treatment of these procurements as direct expense 

resulted in the misstatement of asset and expense accounts, especially if not all supplies 

and materials purchased during the CY 2020 were used or consumed as of year-end. 

 

Further verification revealed that the Accounting Office does not maintain Supplies 

Ledger Cards while the Supply Management Office does not prepare and submit the Report 

on the Physical Count of Inventories which will be the basis for the recording and 

adjustment of Inventories at year-end.  Such disregard may result to wastage of government 

resources especially if receipts and issuances thereof are not duly accounted for.  If not 

properly monitored, supplies and materials may be utilized other than its intended purpose. 

 

Management Comment/s: 

 

 The Accounting Office and the Supply Management Office have been directed to 

work on the implementation of the perpetual inventory method in the treatment of 

Inventories. These offices were also ordered to prepare and maintain the required records 

and reports necessary to implement this audit observation. 

 

Recommendation: 

 

 We recommended that the management instruct the Accounting Office and 

the Supply Management Office to coordinate closely for the implementation of 

perpetual inventory method in the recording of Inventories to ensure proper 



39 

 

accounting and promote better control in the receipt and issuance of supplies and 

materials. 

 

Moreover, the management shall direct the accounting office to establish the 

necessary ledger cards for each inventory while the SMO shall religiously submit its 

RPCI to the former so that necessary adjustment or appropriate action could be 

effected. 

 

 

2.   Insurance premiums were treated as outright expenses due to non-preparation of 

the required adjusting entry for the unexpired portion at year-end, thereby 

understating the Prepaid Insurance and Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) accounts 

in the same amount of ₱759,533.89, contrary to Chapter 2 of the Government 

Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs),  

Volume I. 

 

Section 15, Chapter 2 of the Government Accounting Manual for NGAs, Volume 

1 states that the Financial Statements (FSs) shall present fairly the financial position, 

financial performance and cash flows of an entity.  Fair presentation requires the faithful 

representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance 

with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set 

out in PPSAS. 

 

Also, Section 6, Chapter 2 of the same manual provides that each entity shall 

recognize and present its financial transactions and operations conformably to the 

following: 
  

xxx 

b. accrual basis of accounting in accordance with PPSAS. 

 

Accrual basis – means a basis of accounting under which transactions and other 
events are recognized when they occur (and not only when cash or its equivalent is received 

or paid).  Therefore, the transactions and events are recognized in the accounting records 

and recognized in the financial statements of the periods to which they relate.  The elements 

recognized under accrual accounting are assets, liabilities, net assets/equity, revenue, and 

expenses. 1 
 

Prepaid Insurance. This account is debited to recognize the amount advanced for 

the insurance of government property. This account is credited for the expended amount, 

and/or adjustments.2 

 

It is therefore clear that only insurance related to the current year shall be treated as 

Insurance Expense, with the unexpired amount to be recognized as Prepaid Insurance at 

the end of the reporting period.

40 

 

Our examination of the accounts and records revealed that the insurance premiums 

paid during the year for vehicles, buildings and their contents were recognized as outright 

expenses and no adjustments were made to account for the unexpired portion at the end of 

the year.  The table below shows the breakdown of the insurance premiums paid for the 

year 2020 per period coverage of the insurance.

Included in the table is the LTO Registration Renewal of one of the University’s 

vehicles in the amount of ₱3,229.06 which was erroneously recorded as Insurance Expense.  

As shown in the table, the recorded Insurance Expense is overstated by ₱762,762.95 since 

only ₱337,322.21 pertains to year 2020 insurance coverage out of the total amount 

recorded.  Hence, the unexpired amount of ₱759,533.89 as of December 31, 2020 should 

be taken-up as Prepaid Insurance. 
 

The practice of recognizing the insurance premiums as outright expenses, without 

taking into account the unexpired portion at year-end, is a non-conformity to the accrual 

basis of accounting, thereby affecting the fair presentation of the financial statements.  
 

Specifically, the said practice has understated the Prepaid Insurance and 

Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) accounts in the same amount of ₱759,533.89. 

 



41 

 

2.1 Despite the mandatory requirement to insure all government properties with the 

General Insurance Fund (GIF) of the Government Service Insurance System 

(GSIS) pursuant to Administrative Order No. 33 dated August 25, 1987 and COA 

Circular No. 92-390 dated November 11, 1992, government properties such as 

school and office buildings amounting to ₱83,971,165.74 or 41.7% of the total 

motor vehicles, buildings and structures remained not insured with the GSIS 

exposing these properties to unnecessary risk of not being indemnified for any 

damage or loss due to any fortuitous events such as fire, earthquake, typhoon 

and/or flood. 

 

 The GSIS is empowered under RA No. 656 to issue insurance for all government 

properties.  To strictly enforce this law, Administrative Order No. 33 was issued requiring 

government agencies to submit an updated inventory of properties of their respective 

offices to the GSIS and to secure from the General Insurance fund and insurance covering 

all its properties. 
 

 In addition to the AO No. 33, COA Circular No. 92-390 dated November 11, 1992 

was issued to assist GSIS in ensuring that all insurable assets and properties of the 

government are adequately covered/insured with General Insurance Fund of the GSIS. 
 

Review of the Insurance Expense for the calendar year 2020 and its supporting 

documents disclosed that not all motor vehicles, buildings and structures of the University 

are insured with the GSIS.  Verification with the Supply and Management Officer revealed 

that some of the properties were knowingly not insured for the reason that there are no 

equipment inside these buildings hence, insurance coverage of which were supposed to be 

unnecessary. 

 

Of the total amount of ₱201,347,275.04 of Motor Vehicles, Buildings and 

Structures found in the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment 

(RPCPPE) for the year 2020, only ₱117,376,109.30 is insured.  A total of ₱83,971,165.74 

or 41.70% remain uninsured, thus leaving these properties at risk of total loss without right 

of indemnification. 

 

Hereunder is the summary of uninsured properties of the University, viz a viz:

Totals 201,347,275.04 117,376,109.30 83,971,165.74 

 

The above practice is contrary to AO No. 33 and COA Circular 92-390 and deprives 

not only the government of possible income but also adequate and reliable insurance 

protection of its assets. 

 

 



42 

 

Management Comment/s: 

 

 The Accounting Office has been directed to strictly adopt the accrual basis of 

accounting and to prepare the necessary adjusting entries to correct the balances of affected 

accounts. Moreover, a directive was issued to the Supply Management Office to prepare 

an inventory of all insurable properties and to insure that these are adequately covered 

immediately with the General Insurance Fund of the GSIS. Furthermore, the Budget 

Officer was also instructed to provide funds for this necessary expenditure. 

 

Recommendation: 

 

We recommended that Management: 

 

a. Strictly adopt the accrual basis of accounting by requiring the Accounting 
Office to regularly recognize the unexpired portion of any expense at year-

end for the purpose of achieving fair presentation of the agency’s Financial 

Statements, in accordance with the prescribed rules and regulations;  

 

b. Prepare the necessary adjusting entries to correct the balances of the 
affected accounts; 

 

c. Revisit Administrative Order No. 33 and COA Circular No. 92-390 and 
prepare and submit inventory reports of all insurable properties to GSIS 

to ensure that all insurable assets and properties are adequately 

covered/insured with the General Insurance Fund of the GSIS to properly 

protect the government properties in the event of serious loss such as fire, 

earthquake, typhoon and/or flood; and 

 

d. Provide a budget for the insurance of all insurable properties pursuant to 
the provisions of RA No. 656, Property Insurance Law, to protect the 

interest of the government and to be indemnified for any damage or loss 

that may arise. 
 

 

3.   Unobligated prior period expenses paid during the year totaling ₱618,063.43 were 

charged against current year’s appropriations and reflected as expenses in the 

Statement of Financial Performance due to the overlooked details of the expenses 

in violation of Section 119 of P.D. 1445 and Section 6, Chapter 2 of the 

Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies 

(NGAs), Volume I, thereby understating the income reflected in the financial 

statement. 

 

Section 119 of Presidential Decree (1445) No. 1445 states that, “Accounting for 

obligations and expenditures.  All lawful expenditures and obligations incurred during the 

year shall be taken up in the accounts of that year.” 



43 

 

Also, Section 6, Chapter 2 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I provides that each 

entity shall recognize and present its financial transactions and operations conformably to 

the following: 
 

xxx 

b. accrual basis of accounting in accordance with PPSAS. 

 

Accrual basis – means a basis of accounting under which transactions and other 
events are recognized when they occur (and not only when cash or its equivalent is received 

or paid).  Therefore, the transactions and events are recognized in the accounting records 

and recognized in the financial statements of the periods to which they relate.  The elements 

recognized under accrual accounting are assets, liabilities, net assets/equity, revenue, and 

expenses. 

 

Our post-audit of the disbursements under the personnel services accounts revealed 

that various expenses incurred during the last quarter of CY 2019 were paid within the 

current year and charged against the current appropriations by recording Salaries and 

Wages-Regular, PERA and Subsistence Allowance among others.  Consequently, these 

expenses were reflected as current expenses in the Statement of Financial Performance as 

deduction in the income account. 

 

 The table hereunder provides the transactions we found erroneous in the course of 

our post-audit of the disbursement vouchers for CY 2020 submitted to this Office: 

 

JEV No. Particulars Period Incurred Amount 

2020-01-001 Subsistence Allowance December 2019 ₱2,147.67 

 Laundry Allowance December 2019 214.76 

 Yearend Bonus December 2019 10,558.80 

 Cash Gift December 2019 4,500.00 

2020-02-001 Overtime and Night Pay December 2019 19,189.30 

2020-01-003 

Salaries and Wages- 

Regular September-October 2019 220,206.00 

 PERA September-October 2019 18,000.00 

2020-01-004 

Salaries and Wages- 

Regular October-December 2019 286,967.55 

 PERA October-December 2019 23,363.63 

 Overtime and Night Pay December 2019 32,915.72 

 TOTAL  ₱618,063.43 

 

 These disbursements should have been obligated during the year-end to set up the 

related liability account in order to avoid charging in the subsequent appropriations.  The 

charging of CY 2019 expenses totaling ₱618,063.43 to the current year’s appropriation did 

not only overstate the current year expenses but also rendered the transactions irregular for 

violation of the aforestated provisions of Section 119 of PD No. 1445. 

 

 



44 

 

3.1 Various disbursements totaling ₱16,561,232.65 which include lecturers’ Fees, 

overload, monetization and terminal benefits were erroneously treated as Salaries 

and Wages-Regular instead of their appropriate expense accounts contrary to 

Section 61 of PD 1445 and COA Circular No. 2020-001 thus casting doubts in the 

accuracy of the Statement of Financial Performance. 

 

 Proper classification of accounts is an essential part in the preparation and 

presentation of the Financial Statements.  A misclassification renders an inaccurate 

reporting which may lead to certain problems to its end-users.  For example, a vehicle 

repair with significant amount was reported as Repairs and Maintenance-Building instead 

of Repairs and Maintenance-Vehicles.  Though both expenses were reflected in the total 

Repairs and Maintenance under MOOE, an agency may overlook that the amount is 

significant when it comes to vehicle repairs as it may only appears immaterial if related to 

buildings due to cost differences between the two assets.  With this, impractical repairs 

may remain unnoticed which consequently lead to waste of funds. 

 

  

Section 61 of PD 1445 gives importance of the classification of expenses accounts 

which states, “Audit of Expense Accounts.  The examination of expense accounts shall be 

undertaken to ascertain that all expenses incurred have been duly authorized; adequately 

funded and documented; properly recorded; all recorded expenses have been actually 

incurred; and the classifications of expenses are appropriate and have been consistently 

followed.” (Emphasis supplied) 

 

 In the course of our audit of the expenses under the personnel services, we have 

determined that various expenses were improperly classified as Salaries and Wages-

Regular rather than their appropriate expense accounts.   

 

 Hereunder is the summary of the expenses reflected in the Working Paper: 

 

Nature of Transactions Aggregate Amount 

Lecturer’s Fees 5,167,077.43 

Summer Pay 195,861.78 

Monetization 6,382,049.36 

Overload 4,769,190.00 

Salary-Chorale Conductor 15,252.00 

Refund of Over deduction of Absences 2766.55 

Terminal Leave Benefits 14,431.97 

Honorarium 5,000.00 

Overtime 9,603.56 

Total 16,561,232.65 

 

 It could be gleaned from the table above that those expenses should not be reported 

as Salaries and Wages-Regular as they obviously do not fall under the description of herein 

account under the Revised Chart of Accounts (Updated 2019) of COA Circular 2020-001 

which provides that said account shall be debited to recognize the pay proper for services 



45 

 

rendered by government employees occupying regular plantilla positions.  This account is 

credited, at year end, to close to the Revenue and Expense Summary account, and/or 

adjustments. 

 

 Revised Chart of Accounts (Updated 2019) gives additional and modified account 

codes and description to properly report financial transactions in the books of accounts and 

preclude misuse of accounts.  Likewise, this also serves as a reminder that misuse of 

expenses accounts may be tantamount to misappropriation of funds as it appears that the 

budget for Salaries and Wages-Regular is being used on transactions other than its intended 

purpose. 

 

 The herein misuse of accounts casts doubts as to the accuracy of the Statement of 

Financial Performance and may affect the views of its end-users. 

 

3.2 Accounts payable at year-end consisted of unpaid personnel services amounting 

to ₱2,322,743.63 which should have been charged as Due to Officers and 

Employee, hence inconsistent with Section 59 of the previously mentioned PD 1445 

and likewise contrary to Revised Chart of Accounts (updated 2019) under COA 

Circular 2020-001 resulting to uncertainty in the correctness of the assets reported 

in the financial statements. 

 

 Both accounts mentioned are part and reported under the Financial Liabilities 

accounts of the Statement of Financial Position at year-end.  Accounts Payable and Due to 

Officers and Employees are described below, per Revised Chart of Accounts, to distinguish 

the difference between them: 

 

 Accounts Payable (20101010) - This account is credited to recognize receipt of 

goods or services on account in the normal course of trade and business operation.  This 

account is debited for payment/settlement of liabilities, and/or adjustments. 

 

Due to Officers and Employees (20101020) - This account is credited to recognize 

incurrence of liability to officers and employees for salaries, benefits and other emoluments 

including authorized expenses advanced by the officers and employees.  This account is 

debited for settlement/payment to officers and employees, and/or adjustments. 

 

 From the given description, one can identify that the former is used in reference to 

normal course of trade and business operation while the latter serves as account for services 

rendered by personnel in advance.  The clear difference between the two is important in 

determining which account to be used in recording a liability.  The nature of the transaction 

serves as the indication on what appropriate recording is to be done. 

 

 Examination of the agency’s books of accounts revealed that several transactions 

amounting to ₱2,322,743.63 were erroneously logged as Accounts Payable despite the 

circumstance that their nature were to establish liability for services rendered by officers 

and employees during the year yet not paid at year-end.

 It can be recalled that similar circumstance had been noticed and discussed by the 

Audit Team in the previous findings which was immediately corrected by the management.  

Yet, the same error is committed herewith.  

 

Management Comment/s: 

 

 With the implementation of the Unified Account Code Structure (UACS), a single 

code classification is used for budgetary, treasury and accounting purposes.  Hence, in 

recording disbursements, the Accounting Office relies on/sustains the expense code   

indicated by the Budget Office in the ORS (Obligation Request and Status). 

 

 It was also deemed necessary for consistent expense code particularly in the 

preparation of Budget and Financial Accountability Reports to be submitted to the DBM 

and other agencies requiring them. 

 

 The Budget Office, on the other hand, was constrained by availability of funds.  

Thus, in the case of Personnel Services, authorized PS expenditures which have insufficient 

fund allocations are charged against savings which in this case come from Salaries and 

Wages-Regular allocation due to salary lapses.  

 

         To address this audit observation, our Budget Officer has been directed to look into 

the budgeting policy of “frontloading available unobligated allotment to cover emerging 

obligations under the Personnel Services (PS).” If this could be applied to us, PS items with 

insufficient fund allocation may be augmented through reallocation. Then, charging to 

Salaries & Wages will no longer be resorted to.  And, actual disbursements for each PS 

expense code can now be reflected in our financial statements. 

 

 The Accounting Office has been instructed to reclassify the affected accounts and 

to prepare the necessary adjustments to the Financial Statements and were reminded to be 

mindful of prescribed rules and regulations.  

 

Recommendations: 

 

We recommended that Management direct the Accounting Office to: 

 

a.  Adopt regularly the accrual basis of accounting by taking up in the books 

the expenditures and obligations during the year they are incurred so as to 

reflect the correct expenses in the financial statement of the year under 

audit; 

 

b.  Adhere to the provisions of P.D. 1445 in the use of appropriations to prevent 

the incurrence of irregular expenditures; 

 

c.  Classify the transactions to their appropriate expense and asset accounts 

for the purpose of achieving accurate presentation of the agency’s 



48 

 

Financial Statements, in accordance with the prescribed rules and 

regulations; and 

 

d.  Prepare the necessary adjusting entries to correct the balances of the 

affected asset accounts. 
 

 

4.   Fund transfers from various NGAs totaling ₱10,299,939.01 or 20.99% of the Due 

to NGAs account of ₱49,079,353.06 as of December 31, 2020 remained unreturned 

and/or unliquidated despite the completion of projects contrary to COA Circular 

No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994 and related Memoranda of Agreement 

between the University and the source funding agencies, thus exposed the 

remaining funds to possible misappropriation or misapplication. 

 

COA Circular 94-013 dated December 13, 1994 provides guidelines on the grants, 

utilizations and liquidations of COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994 

provides the guidelines on the grant, utilization and liquidation of funds transferred to 

implementing agencies. Section 4.9 states that “Implementing Agencies shall return to the 

Source Agencies any unused balance upon completion of the project.” 

 

As of year-end, the balance of the University’s Due to National Government 

Agencies (NGAs) account was stated at ₱49,079,353.06 which accounts for 37.92% of the 

total liabilities of ₱122,440,169.60. 

 

The University received funds from other National Government Agencies (NGAs) 

for the implementation of various programs, projects and activities which are mostly 

related to scientific researches.  These fund transfers were recorded in the books under the 

Due to NGAs account. 

 

Verification revealed that the amount of ₱10,299,939.01 or 20.99% of the Due to 

NGAs account of ₱49,079,353.06 as at December 31, 2020 still remained unreturned 

and/or unliquidated to the Source Agency despite completion of the projects, in violation 

of COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994, as shown below:

It could be gleaned from table above that the projects have already been completed 

based on the duration of implementation agreed upon by the University and its source 

agencies under their respective Memoranda of Agreement.  No extension of period was 

received by this Office.  The University already lacked authority to use the remaining 

funds, hence subject of cash refund to the source agencies.  Some of these projects have 

already submitted their Terminal Reports to this Office before the year-end yet they failed 

to return the remaining fund balances in support of the said report. 

 

This Team included in the list those projects costing ₱6,907,800.00 on which the 

duration of implementation cannot be determined as they were not stated under the MOA.  

Said deficiencies have already been noted by this Team and communicated to the project 

staff several times however, they still overlooked the same on succeeding projects.  The 

management shall ensure that every MOA entered into with other parties contains complete 

information at all times as these are significant in the determination of deliverables of each 

party in case of problems which may arise. 

 

Moreover, this Team noted the delays in the implementation of project under BFAR 

entitled “Philippine Aquatic: Species, Distribution and Threats”, with funds receipt 

amounting to ₱1,248,766.60, based on the reflected book balance thereof.  The project 

should have been completed by December, 2020 however, the book balance at said date 

revealed that the funds amounting to ₱1,013,062.60 or 81.13% of the total cost are still 

unutilized which indicates delay in the implementation. 

 



50 

 

Despite constant reminder to the Accountant for the immediate liquidation and 

refund to the Source Agencies of all completed projects/programs, they still failed to act 

on the recommendations.  The failure to refund these funds to the source agencies would 

expose them to possible misappropriation or misapplication.  

 

Management Comment/s: 

 

 The projects-in-charge were required to prepare and submit timely Terminal 

Reports, upon coordination with the Accounting Office, to facilitate immediate settlement 

of these funds. Management also committed to exert extra efforts to indicate the necessary 

information in the Memorandum of Agreement authorizing these projects.  

 

 

Recommendation: 

 

We recommended that the Management:  

 

a. Require the respective Project-in-Charge (i) exert earnest efforts to 

complete the preparation of the Final or Terminal Reports for each of the 

completed projects for submission to the Accountant; and (ii) cause the 

immediate completion of the remaining projects for the eventual 

settlement of the funds received from source agencies; 

 

b. Remind the Accounting Office (i) record the liquidations submitted by the 

Project-in-Charge; and (ii) submit the Liquidation/Terminal Reports and 

refund the excess project funds to the source agencies. 

 

c. Ensure that all Memoranda of Agreement entered into by the University 

with other agencies contains all necessary information at all times. 

 

 

5.   The validity, correctness and valuation of the Construction in Progress (CIP) and 

Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) accounts amounting to ₱67,893,592.21 and    

₱244,822,456.19, respectively, could not be ascertained due to lack of coordination 

between accounting office and projects-in-charge to validate status of 

construction resulting to non-reclassification of various completed projects 

amounting to ₱26,530,181.01 from CIP to appropriate PPE account thus, failing 
to account for the depreciation charges and affecting the income and expense 

accounts for CY 2020 contrary to Section 41 of the New Government Accounting 

System (NGAS). 

 

Section 41 Volume I of the New Government Accounting System (NGAS) 

provides that during construction period, property, plant and equipment shall be classified 

and recorded as “Construction in Progress” with the appropriate asset classification. As 

soon as these are completed, the “Construction in Progress” account shall be transferred to 

the appropriate asset accounts. 



51 

 

 

It is an essential accounting procedure to capitalize construction in progress (CIP) 

when completed as these shall correspond to depreciation, in compliance to the matching 

principle of accounting. 

 

Verification of the Construction in Progress account disclosed that there were 

completed projects which remained in the said account as of December 31, 2020.  Query 

revealed that the delay in the capitalization of these projects was due to lack of coordination 

between offices handling the projects, thereby certificates of completion and other 

pertinent documents were not given to the Accounting Department for recording purposes.  

It is a practice of the University that the herein documents are to be forwarded by the Office 

of the Vice Chancellor for Administration and Finance (OVCAF) to the Accounting Office, 

however due to frequent changes in the office-in-charge, it remained unnoticed by the 

latter. 

 

Examination on the composition of the CIP account and verification with OVCAF 

personnel revealed projects completed but not yet reclassified to their appropriate PPE 

accounts, hence no provision for depreciation was established, viz a viz:

Fund 164  

College of Fisheries 6,973,373.24  

TOTAL ₱26,530,181.01  

 

Other composition of the CIP which we, the Audit Team, likewise found issues and 

concerns along with their status are listed below: 

 

Particulars  Amount  Remarks 

Fund 101   

Engineering Technology ₱96,988.61 c/o Marawi 

STTC Conference Hall 2,183,613.91 Not completed 

Various Repairs 551,079.26 Still for verification 

Fund 164   

Hatchery 40,500.00 Still for verification 

TOTAL ₱2,872,181.78  

 

The Engineering Technology is said to be under the supervision of MSU-Marawi 

City and that the OVCAF cannot determine the real status of the project. Accordingly, the 

University will still reconcile with the MSU-Marawi to resolve issues with said project. 

The STTC Conference Hall which was sourced out from the General Appropriations Act 

(GAA) of the University is likewise not completed due to problems attributed to the 



52 

 

contractor.  At yearend, the conference hall continued to be unutilized and there were no 

clear plans from the management on how to finish the project. Projects which remained 

incomplete for a long period of time deprived the intended users of benefits due to them. 
 

Moreover, the University will still verify and determine the status of the hatchery 

project and the composition of various repairs which should already have been capitalized 

upon its completion to their related PPE accounts. 
 

The total amount of completed projects of ₱26,530,181.01 represents 10.83% of 

the total PPE as of December 31, 2020 while the projects still for verification totaling 

₱2,872,181.78 could be an addition to the PPE book balance if issues related thereto be 

resolved immediately.  Failure to capitalize said projects resulted to non-recognition of its 

corresponding accumulated depreciation and consequently understated the expenses of the 

University during the year.  
 

Management Comment/s: 
 

 The Accounting Office has secured the documents required to support the 

reclassification of completed projects such as the COED Dormitory, Fisheries Building 

and Engineering Laboratory Building.  They have also been directed to closely coordinate 

with the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Administration and Finance (OVCAF) so that 

completed projects can immediately be recorded in the book of accounts of the University 

as well as monitoring of projects classified under the Construction in Progress account. 
 

 Further, the OVCAF is tasked to thresh out and settle issues concerning the rest of 

the cited projects.  Appropriate course of action shall be taken once recommendations of 

the OVCAF are handed to the Office of the Chancellor. 
 

Recommendations: 
 

We recommended that Management: 
 

a.  Ensure the coordination between the Accounting Office and the Office of 

the Vice Chancellor for Administration and Finance regarding completed 

projects so that there is proper recording in the book of accounts; 
 

b.  Instruct the Accounting Office to closely monitor the items in the CIP, 

reclassify completed projects to their appropriate asset accounts and 

record the corresponding depreciation expenses; 
 

c.   Take immediate actions to resolve pending issues and concerns of projects 

which remain in the CIP account for a long period of time, actual status of 

which are still for verification by the University. 

 

 

6.   The University failed to have its Gender and Development (GAD) Plan and Budget 

approved and furnished to the Philippine Commission on Women (PCW), 

Department of Budget and Management (DBM) and other government agencies 



53 

 

contrary to RA 9710 and PCW Memorandum Circular No. 2019-02, hence 

alignment of the GAD Plan to the GAD Agenda cannot be ascertained. 

 

Section 36, Chapter VI of RA No. 9710 also known as the Magna Carta of Women 

mandates that all departments, including their attached agencies, offices and bureaus, state 

universities and colleges , government-owned and control corporations, local government 

units, and other government instrumentalities shall adopt gender mainstreaming as a 

strategy to promote women’s human rights and eliminate gender discrimination in their 

systems, structures, policies, programs, processes, and procedures which shall include, but 

not limited to: (a) planning, budgeting, monitoring and evaluation of GAD programs, (b) 

Creation and/or Strengthening of the GAD Focal Points (GFP) and, (c) Generation and 

Maintenance of GAD Database. 

 

Section 8 of PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01 provides that the GAD 

Focal Point System (GFPS) of the agency shall review all submitted GAD Plans and 

Budgets (GPBs) and as needed, provide comments or recommendations for revision.  

Agency review of GPBs shall focus on the alignment of the GAD Plan with the GAD 

Agenda and the correctness and alignment of the entries in each column of the GPB 

template.  In the case of State Universities and Colleges (SUCs), the Commission on 

Higher Education (CHED) or its designated regional offices or gender resource centers 

shall review the submissions of SUCs and forward the same to PCW for endorsement to 

DBM. 

 

The University submitted its GAD Plan and Budget for the FY 2020 and was able 

to present incurrence of expenses for GAD activities.  Verification revealed, however, that 

the GPB was not submitted to the PCW for approval because of the late submission to the 

CHED.  As such, programs and activities carried out were not assured to have been able to 

address gender issues in accordance with Republic Act 7192. 

 

6.1 The GAD Plan and Budget was not used as basis in the preparation of the GAD 

Accomplishment Report (AR) contrary to Section 10.1 of the PCW-NEDA-DBM 

Joint Circular No. 2012-01 thus hampering the evaluation and assessment of the 

implementation of GAD activities. 

 

 Section 10.1 of the PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01 provides that 

the agency GFPS shall prepare the GAD AR based on the PCW-endorsed GPB or the GPB 

adjusted to the approved GAA following the form prescribed.  Activities completed until 

the end of the year may be included in the final GAD AR of agency submitted to PCW in 

January. 

 

 Moreover, Section 10.5 of the same Joint Circular also states that the Annual GAD 

AR shall be accompanied by the following: (1) brief summary of the reported program or 

project; (2) copies of reported policy issuances; (3) results of HGDG tests, if any; and (4) 

actions taken by the agency on the COA audit findings and recommendations, if any. 

 



54 

 

 Our review of the GAD AR for CY 2020 disclosed that this does not follow the 

GAD Plan and Budget as required in Section 10 of the Joint Circular.  There are Gender 

Issues/Mandates that are included in the GAD AR but are not among those in the GPB and 

vice-versa.  
  
 The inconsistencies noted between the GPB and the GAD AR showed that the 

University’s GAD Focal Point System is unaware of the provisions of the Joint Circular 

requiring the use of the GPB as the basis in the preparation of the GAD AR.  It is 

emphasized that the GAD Plan and Budget sets the direction of the agency in addressing 

gender issues that will promote gender equality between men and women.  Hence it must 

be followed in the preparation of the accomplishment report to facilitate the monitoring, 

review and evaluation of the GAD relevant PPAs. 
 

 The inconsistencies between the GPB and the GAD AR and the absence of the 

documents required in Section 10 of PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular 2012-01 precluded 

the oversight bodies from assessing and evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of the 

GAD PPAs implemented by the University during the year and may result to wastage of 

funds spent towards the implementation of PPAs that failed to attain their objectives and 

goals. 

 

6.2 Allocated budget for GAD Program, Projects and Activities amounted only to 

₱1,049,500.00 or 0.29% of its total budget under the General Appropriations Act 

(GAA) CY 2020 due to absence of thorough planning in disregard of RA 9710 and 

PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular; thus, it failed to mainstream gender 

perspectives and address gender related concerns. 
 

Section 36, Chapter VI of RA No. 9710 also known as the Magna Carta of Women 

mandates that all departments, including their attached agencies, offices and bureaus, state 

universities and colleges , government-owned and control corporations, local government 

units, and other government instrumentalities shall adopt gender mainstreaming as a 

strategy to promote women’s human rights and eliminate gender discrimination in their 

systems, structures, policies, programs, processes, and procedures which shall include, but 

not limited to, planning, budgeting, monitoring and evaluation of GAD programs, which 

shall be at least five percent (5%) of their budgets. (Emphasis supplied) 
 

Likewise, Section 6.1 of PCW-NEDA-DBM JC No. 2012-01 provides that – 

 

xxx The GAD budget shall be drawn from agency’s maintenance and other 

operating expenses (MOOE), capital outlay (CO), and personnel services (PS). 

 

Verification of records revealed that allocated budget for GAD PPAs for CY 2020 

amounted to ₱1,049,500.00 which only represents 0.29% of the total approved budget 

which is clearly not in accordance with the mandatory allocation for GAD of at least 5% 

of the University total budget.  In comparison, the variance between the required and actual 

allocation was substantial amounting to ₱17,189,700.00 or 4.71%.  Herein deficiency 

showed failure of the University to incorporate GAD PAPs in its budget to mainstream 

gender perspectives and address gender related concerns.  Table below provides the data 

on budget allocation for GAD: 



55

Actual GAD Budget 1,049,500.00 0.29% 

Variance 17,189,700.00 4.71% 

 

 Moreover, of the actual budgeted amount of ₱1,049,500.00, only ₱874,500.00 were 

utilized hence a total of ₱175,000.00 were unexpended either due to non-implementation 

of projects or discontinuance of which during the time of pandemic.  

 Consequently, the above-mentioned deficiencies on GAD Budget and Plan, AR, 

and insufficient allocation and underutilization of GAD funds violated the guidelines as 

directed in RA 9710 and PCW-NEDA-DBM JC 2010-01.  The management efforts 

towards GAD responsiveness were inadequate to ensure that GAD objectives were 

achieved.  We would also like to emphasize the importance of coordination and 

participation that is not only focus on the achievement of the mandate of the University 

itself but also to help other governmental bodies to achieve their objectives specially the 

PCW and NEDA as part of nation building, policy formulation, project identification and 

development.  Insufficient integration of GAD to major PPAs, minimal utilization and 

disregarded the provisions of RA 9710 and the guidelines of JC 2012-01, the management 

(a) failed to develop mainstreaming of gender perspective in its programs, (b) does not 

fully promote women empowerment and gender equality, (c) showed insufficient effort to 

identify and address gender-related issues, and (d) deprived the officers, employees and 

clients from benefits that could have been derived therefrom. 

 

Management Comment/s: 

 

 The University’s GAD Plan and Budget was returned and was required to be re-

submitted to the CHED as part of the GAD Plan and Budget of the MSU System. This 

requirement has hampered the compliance to existing procedures on the review and 

approval of the 2020 GAD Plan and Budget.  

  

 The newly designated GAD Focal Person has already coordinated with the MSU 

System officials involved with the System GAD. Furthermore, the management assured 

the team that the observations and recommendations shall be acted upon appropriately. 

 

Recommendation: 

 

We recommended that the management: 



56 

 

 

a.  Require the GAD Focal Point of the University to follow the set deadlines 

and submit the agency’s GAD Plan and Budget to CHED which will review 

and forward the same to PCW and DBM for approval to ensure that the 

GAD programs/projects/activities therein address gender issues, in 

accordance with the existing regulations and guidelines on the preparation 

of Annual GAD Plan and Budget and Accomplishment Report; 

 

b.  Use the GAD Plan and Budget in the formulation of the GAD AR and to 

attach the documents required in PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular 2012-

01 to facilitate the monitoring and evaluation of the GAD PPAs 

implemented during the year; 

 

c.   Allocate 5% of the GAA for GAD Budget; and 

  

d. Monitor and assess the mainstreaming of gender perspectives in the 

implementation of University’s major and attributed PPAs. 

 

7. Compliance with RA 10929 otherwise known as the “Free Internet Access in the 

Public Places Act of 2016” 

 

With the desire to strengthen the quality education, the Administration headed by 

Chancellor Anshari P. Ali, implemented the Free Fiber Optic WI-FI Connection within the 

entire Campus. 

 

8.  Transparency Seal 

 

Mindanao State University-General Santos City is notably compliant on the 

maintenance and posting to their official website of the Transparency Seal as mandated in 

Section 94 of RA No. 11465 or the General Appropriation Act, Fiscal Year 2020.  This 

mandate aims to enhance the transparency and enforce accountability of all agencies of the 

government. 

 

9.  Disaster Risk Reduction Management (DRRM) Fund 

 

Mindanao State University-General Santos City, through its DRRM Focal Point 

Person, implemented programs and activities to the University community on disaster 

preparedness and risk reduction in accordance with rules and regulation relative to DRRM. 

 
10. Compliance to Tax Laws 

 

Taxes withheld from the salaries and benefits of employees, payment for the 

purchase of materials and services, franchise tax and other related taxes 

amounting to ₱35,093,414.13 for CY 2020 was regularly withheld and remitted to 

the BIR in compliance with Revenue Regulations No. 2-98 dated April 17, 1998.

Outstanding balance of Due from 

Officers and Employees 

amounting to ₱4,364,285.04 

arising from payments of 

salaries, allowances and other 

benefits of 13 reneging fellows 

who have breached their contract 

by not returning service, remains 

unpaid and dormant for 17 to 35 

years due to inadequate 

administration of the cost 

recovery mechanisms thereby 

depriving the University of the 

benefit from its investments on 

Personnel Development. 
 

Recommendation: 
 

We recommended that 

Management: 
 

a. Exert more effort to 

locate documents pertaining to 

non-moving accounts to 

substantiate their balances and 

enforce collection; 
 

b. Issue demand letters to 

all reneging fellows who are no 

longer in the service and 

exhaust all legal remedies to 

collect their unpaid dues; 
 

c. Ensure that personnel 

secure clearance from money 

accountability before 

resignation/retirement/separati

on/transfer from the service 

and hold the officials who 

signed therein responsibly 

accountable;

internal control measures in 

the grant of scholarships and 

formulate strong policies for 

reneging fellows to preclude 

loss or waste of government 

funds; and 

 

f. For subsequent grants, 

convene the committee on 

evaluation of applications for 

study grants together with the 

concerned personnel and 

reiterate and/or remind them 

of their duties and 

responsibilities relative 

thereto. Require them of

2. Non-adherence to laws, rules 

and regulations covering grant 

and liquidation of cash advances 

due to lack of enforcement of 

settlement and granting of 

additional cash advances despite 

existing balances, resulted to 

accumulated balance of 

₱11,269,076.28 as at year-end, 

therefore exposing the funds to 

possible loss, misuse or 

misapplication, and existence of 

misstatement of related expenses 

and overstatement of the asset 

account in the statement of 

financial position. 

 

Recommendation: 

 

We recommended 

Management to: 

 

a. Require the Officers and 

AAR 

CY

Employees and Accountable 

Officers concerned to 

immediately liquidate their

b. Direct the Accounting 

Office and the Special 

Disbursing Officer to reconcile 

the discrepancy in their 

respective ending balances; 

 

c. Discontinue the 

granting of additional cash 

advances to AOs with 

unliquidated cash advances; 

and 

 

d. Exercise prudence in 

granting Cash Advances and to 

strictly comply with the 

provision of Section 89 of PD

payments of commutable 

Representation and 

Transportation Allowance 

(RATA) ranging from ₱8,000 to 

₱10,000 monthly to 21 

Department Heads, Directors and 

Deans who are Officers-in-

Charge (OIC) in status due to the 

long standing practice of the 

University in granting the same 

on a fixed or commutable basis 

regardless of designation status, 

contrary to paragraph 8.1.1 of 

National Budget Circular No. 

548 and Section 286, Volume 1, 

Government Accounting and 

Auditing Manual (GAAM) thus, 

rendering the amounts of 

disbursements likely to be 

excessive from what should have 

been allowed. 

 

Recommendation: 

 

We recommended that

documents for 

its 

computations. 



 

64 

 

Management strictly adhere to 

the provisions of National 

Budget Circular 548 and 

Section 286, Article 1, Chapter 

5 of the GAAM and stop the 

practice of paying RATA on 

commutable basis to OIC 

employees. Further, the 

management should direct the 

Human Resource Management 

Office (HRMO) to submit to 

the Accounting Office the 

DTRs, application for leave 

and other supporting 

documents needed in the re-

computation of the allowable 

RATA for said employees 

based on the prescribed 

scheme, which will be 

subsequently reviewed by this 

Office to determine the excess 

claims, if any, and cause the 

immediate return of the same.

4. Audit of the Expanded 

Students’ Grants-in-Aid Program 

for Poverty Alleviation (ESGP-

PA) Scholarship Program 

manifested the following gaps: 

 

a. Non-compliance of the 

University in various 

responsibilities as co-

implementer of Joint 

Memorandum Circular (JMC) 

No. 2016-1 dated  

June 23, 2016 issued by CHED, 

DBM, DSWD, DOLE in view of 

(a) non-posting of the list of 

ESGP-PA student grantees in its 

official website; (b) payment of 

stipend to grantees were not 

made on monthly basis and (c) 

non-preparation/submission of 

quarterly financial 

accomplishment reports; 

 

b. Tuition fees and other 

school fees from ESGP-PA 

funds were not previously 

recognized as income in the 

books of accounts of the 

AAR 

CY 

2019 

Page

Management 

responded that the 

stipend of the 

students are now 

directly credited to 

their respective 

ATM accounts.

team. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Per verification, 

management 

cannot give the 

students their 

stipend on a 

monthly basis 

because it will 

primarily 

depend on when 

the funds are 

downloaded by 

CHED. 

Management 

also stopped the 

practice of 

granting 

honoraria to the 

officers and 

employees 

connected to the 

ESGPPA 

Scholarship 

Program. 



 

65 

 

University contrary to COA 

Circular 2000-002 dated April 4, 

2000; 

 

c. Payment of Honoraria to MSU 

officers and employees 

amounting to ₱1,502,509.00 was 

not in accordance with the 

existing government laws, rules 

and regulations on the grant of 

honorarium and without 

authority or legal basis, contrary 

to Section 4(1) of Presidential 

Decree (PD) 1445 thus, casting 

doubts on its regularity; and 

 

d. The University failed to 

secure copy of MOA with 

CHEDRO to serve as guide in 

the implementation of said 

program. 

 

The deficiencies noted limited 

the University in the discharge of 

its functions as implementer of 

ESGP-PA and deprived the 

students-grantees the immediate 

benefits that the Scholarship 

Program offers, contrary to the 

ultimate purpose and guidelines 

provided under JMC No. 01 

dated June 23, 2016 and other 

applicable laws, rules and 

regulations. 

 

Recommendation: 

 

We recommended that 

Management:  

 

a. Revisit the functions of 

SUCs as co-implementer of the 

scholarship programs and 

adhere to same particularly on 

the following: (a) posting of 

complete list of ESGP-PA 

student-grantees in their 

official website every semester;

b. Recognize the tuition 

fees and other similar fees as 

income thru Government 

Equity account and transfer 

the same to proper ADGB for 

STF; 

 

c. Refrain from granting 

honoraria to officials and 

employees with special 

assignments since they are 

already properly compensated 

in the form of salaries and 

overtime pay;  

 

d. Secure a copy of the 

Memorandum of Agreement 

and other legal documents to 

facilitate the implementation of 

the ESGP-PA program.

obligations recorded as Accounts 

Payable (2-01-01-010) under the 

General Fund amounting to 

₱4,706,046.10, which are over 

two years and against which no 

claim has been filed as of 

December 31, 2017, were not 

reverted to the unappropriated 

surplus pursuant to Section 98 of 

P.D. 1445, resulting to 

overstatement of liabilities 

account, thus affects the fair 

presentation of the accounts in 

the financial statements. 

 

Further, transactions supposedly 

charged against Due to Officers 

and Employees (2-01-01-020) 

totaling ₱1,253,599.74 were 

erroneously recorded as 

Accounts Payable contrary to

occurrence of misstatement of 

account balances at year-end. 

 

Recommendation: 

 

We recommended that the 

Head of the Agency evaluate 

the validity of unliquidated 

obligations charged as 

Accounts Payable which 

remained outstanding for two 

years or over, and if found to 

have no valid claim, cause 

reversion of the same to the 

unappropriated surplus. 

 

Moreover, we recommended 

that the Accounting 

Department strictly observe 

proper account classification in 

recording transactions and 

take up necessary adjusting 

entries on affected liability 

accounts for fair presentation 

in the financial statements.

₱196,943,125.00 (net of 

accumulated depreciation), 

which constitutes 38.03% of its 

total assets, could not be 

established with reasonable 

certainty due to non-completion 

of inventory-taking as of 

December 31, 2017 and 

subsequent non-reconciliation of 

the same with the corresponding 

Report on the Physical Count of 

PPE, resulted to either 

understatement and/or 

overstatement of individual asset 

accounts, thus affecting the fair 

presentation of financial 

statements contrary to Section

Recommendation: 

 

We reiterated prior year’s 

audit recommendation that the 

Head of Office direct the 

Accounting Office and Supply 

Management Office to 

reconcile their respective 

records and report to arrive at 

the true and actual valuation 

of PPE accounts. 

 

Moreover, we recommended 

that the SMO devise 

mechanisms to complete the 

physical inventory of PPE on 

time and prepare and submit 

the required inventory report 

thereof pursuant to existing 

rules and regulations to ensure 

fair presentation of PPE 

accounts in the financial 

statement of the university.
