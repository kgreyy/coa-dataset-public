C)	Scope and Objectives of Audit



The audit covered the transactions, accounts and operations of the BOI for CY 2020. The audit was conducted to (a) ascertain the level of assurance that may be placed on management’s assertions on the financial statements;  (b) determine the propriety of transactions as well as the extent of compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations; (c) recommend agency improvement opportunities; and (d) determine the extent of implementation of prior years’ audit recommendations.



D)	Independent Auditor’s Report



An unqualified opinion was rendered on the financial statements of BOI as of December 31, 2020.



E)	Significant Observations and Recommendations



1)	Fund transfer to CITEM during the year amounting to P1.000 million for the implementation of the agency’s project was not liquidated.  Also, there were still unliquidated fund transfers in prior years to various NGAs amounting to ₱21.320 million or 94.58 percent of prior year’s balance of P22.543 million. (Observation No. 6)



We recommended and Management agreed to:



a)	direct the Accountant to monitor the liquidations considering that demand letters were already sent to IAs; 



b)	require the Accountant continue the close coordination with the DTI CO concerned officials and send another demand letter for CITE-DTI;  and



c)	request from the concerned NGA heads to immediately submit the required liquidation reports together with the supporting documents to report the utilization of funds and to return any unused balance to fully settle the outstanding accounts with the BOI, especially for   the completed projects and enforce the provisions of COA Circular No. 94-013.



2)	Unserviceable property with book value of P46.190 million remained not disposed of, thus, exposing them to further deterioration and decreasing their realizable value. (Observation No. 10)



We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Property Officer to conduct the disposal of the unserviceable property as scheduled in November 2021, in accordance with Section 79 of PD No. 1445 to prevent further deterioration and realize possible income therefrom.







The observations and recommendations were discussed with the officials concerned in an exit conference conducted on March 10, 2021. Management views and comments were incorporated in the report, where appropriate.



F)	Enforcement of Settlement of Accounts



There was no Notice of Suspension (NS), Notice of Disallowance (ND) nor Notice of Charge (NC) issued for transactions audited during the year.  However, of the prior year disallowances amounting to   P16.279 million, only the amount of P0.245 million or 1.51 percent was issued with corresponding Notice of Settlement of Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges (NSSDC) during the year, leaving an unsettled disallowances amounting to P16.034 million as of year-end.  The amount settled was minimal because most of the disallowances were under appeal, petition, review and some settlements were made through continuous salary deduction of the persons liable duly approved by COA.



G)	Implementation of Prior Years’ Recommendations



Of the 12 audit recommendations contained in the 2019 Annual Audit Report, eight were implemented and four remained not implemented which were reiterated in this year’s report.
