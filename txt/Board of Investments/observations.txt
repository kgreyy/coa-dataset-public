Fund Utilization/Obligation 



2)		Overall, the agency’s fund utilization/obligation of P333.817 million is 91.08 percent compared to its allotment of P366.496 million, of which P25.178 million or 6.87 percent pertains to one of its major programs, the Registration and Supervision of Investments Projects (RSIP), which registered a utilization rate of 95.60 percent and in accordance with the purpose of appropriation/allotment.  

	

Review of the Statement of Appropriations, Allotments, Obligations, Disbursements and Balances (SAAODB) FAR No. 1, Summary of Appropriations, Allotments, Obligations, Disbursements and Balances by Object of Expenditures (SAAODBE) FAR No 1-A, and List of Allotments and Sub-Allotments (LASAs) FAR No. 1-B together with supporting documents as of December 31, 2020 showed that BOI incurred high utilization rates  of 91.08 percent and 95.60 percent for its overall fund and for  Registration and Supervision of Investments Projects (RSIP), respectively.

A total budget of P366.495 million was received by BOI for CY 2020 for the implementation of its programs, projects and activities, of which P333.817 million or 91.08 percent was utilized as shown below:

	The unutilized fund of P32.678 pertains to savings as follows:



a)	On MOOE, on project cost with Philippine Auto Parts Expo (Phil APEX 3) and Inclusive Business Action Network (IBAN), reduced bid price for Leyte Ecological Industrial Zone (LEIZ), Cost-Benefit Analysis for the Evaluation of Projects under the Investments Priority Plan (IPP)/Strategic Investment Priority Plan (SIPP), publication of the 2020 Investments Priorities Plan, Launching of the 2020 IPP (P0.150 million) and Formulation of the 2020 IPP and other related Policies, updating of the pharma roadmap, subscription on Iron and Steel data and  for outstanding representation expenses during the first quarter of 2020,  implementation of ISIS Plans, Activities and Programs (PAPs) costs extended to be utilized until December 31, 2021, printing of the Cold Chain Industry Roadmap, Study on NHP - Historical Perspective on the Development of Herbal Medicines in the Philippines, Philippines-Indonesia Copper Industry Dialogue, online purchases from PS-DBM approved but discontinued due to no available stock, decrease travel expenses due to travel restrictions, decrease request for postage and courier services.

 

b)	On Capital Outlay (CO), on discontinued procurement of Surveillance CCTV Camera due to failed bidding, procurement and deployment of a high-end server UPS and other ICT projects were extended in CY 2021.



On May 07, 2020, the Civil Service Commission (CSC) issued the Memorandum Circular No. 10, S. 2020 providing the Revised Interim Guidelines for Alternative Work Arrangements and Support Mechanisms for Workers in the Government during the Period of State of National Emergency Due to COVID-19 Pandemic. Accordingly, the BOI implemented a skeleton workforce and Work-From-Home arrangement to prevent COVID-19-related health risks to BOI employees and its clients, minimize the risk of BOI as source of transmission of COVID-19, and ensure the continuity of BOI operations.



With the continued General Community Quarantine (GCQ) in the 3rd and 4th Quarters of 2020 in most of the cities in the country, the conduct of BOI physical related activities (within and outside the country) were still discouraged and government offices, including BOI operated adopting alternative work arrangements. 



Moreover, of the total budget of P25.177 million received for the RSIP for CY 2020, 95.60 percent or P24.070 million was utilized.  The details are shown below:

The unutilized balance of P1.107 million pertains to savings on MOOE due to decrease in travel expenses for suspended plant visits due to travel restrictions during pandemic.



The RSIP is under the Legal Compliance Service (LCS) which serves as the general counsel of BOI. It supervises and monitors the operations of BOI-registered enterprises and BOI-endorsed Regional Headquarters (RHQs)/Regional Operating Headquarters (ROHQs). It is responsible in negotiating and concluding investment agreement/treaties and other economic partnership agreements and represents the Board in various inter-agency meetings affecting trade and investments. 



Despite the high utilization rates, the agency still has not complied with the guidelines on the utilization of funds for CY 2020 provided under paragraph 3.10 of NBC 578 dated January 6, 2020 which states that “As a general rule, departments, bureaus and offices of the National Government, including constitutional Offices enjoying fiscal autonomy and SUCs, shall spend what is programmed in their respective appropriations in the FY 2020 GAA.”



Although the agency was not able to fully utilize its budget in accordance with NBC No. 578 dated January 6, 2020, the fund balance represents generated savings, validity of which was extended up to December 31, 2021 pursuant to NBC 585 dated January 26, 2021, Re: Guidelines on the Treatment of Released Allotment and Release of Funds for FY 2021 Pursuant to RA Nos. 11519 (An Act Extending the Availability of Appropriations under R.A.11494, Otherwise known as Bayanihan to Recover as One Act) and R.A. 11520  (An Act Extending the Availability of the FY 2020 Appropriations to December 31, 2021), amending for the Purpose Section 60 of the General Provisions of R.A. No. 11465 or the GAA for FY 2020.



The LCS, despite the pandemic, was able to accomplish its duties although not all planned plant visits were conducted due to travel restrictions during lockdowns due to the pandemic situation as safety precautions against COVID-19.



Cash Utilization/Disbursement 



3)	Of the total cash allocation of P 354.554 million received during the year, 87.58 percent or P 310.527 million was utilized/disbursed and the balance which was not utilized due to the travel restrictions during the pandemic was reverted to the Bureau of the Treasury.  Also, disbursements of P23.775 million or 98.78 percent out of the total obligation of P24.070 million for the RSIP, were regular, necessary and not excessive, extravagant and unconscionable and in accordance with Executive Order No. 91 dated September 9, 2019, which prescribes the adoption of the Cash Budgeting System beginning Fiscal Year 2020, and for other purposes.



Reversion of dormant cash, unauthorized accounts and unnecessary fund



4)	The agency has no dormant cash, unauthorized accounts, unnecessary special and trust funds and related accounts for reversion as of year-end, in conformity with Permanent Committee Joint Circular No. 4-2012, dated September 11, 2012, implementing Executive Order No. 431, dated May 30, 2005.



Non-liquidation of cash advances



5)	Cash advances which were properly granted for official local and foreign travels and special purpose/time-bound undertakings for CY 2020 amounting to P0.400 million were not liquidated.  Also, there were still unliquidated cash advances in prior years amounting to P1.699 million or 40.90 percent of prior years’ balance of P4.154 million.



Section 5 of the COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 provides that:



4.1.3 A cash advance shall be reported as soon as the purpose for which it was given has been served.



5.1.3 Official Travel – within sixty (60) days after the return to the Philippines in the case of foreign travel or within thirty (30) days after return to his permanent official station in the case of local travel, as provided for in EO 248 and COA Circular No. 96-004.



COA Circular No. 2009-002 dated May 18, 2009 provides that:



4.1.3(ix) Cash advance for special time-bound undertaking shall be liquidated by the accountable officer concerned within one month from the date the purpose of the cash advance was accomplished.



The cash advances and liquidations during the year and prior years, with their corresponding balances, are shown below:

The cash advances for CY 2020 for official travels and special purpose/time-bound undertakings amounting to P0.019 million and P0.382 million, respectively, or a total of P0.401 million were not liquidated within the prescribed period. Also, prior years’ cash advances amounting to P1.699 million or 40.90 percent of prior years’ balance of P4.154 million remained unliquidated as of year-end. The liquidation rate of 59.00 percent of the prior year cash advances for CY 2020 is 31.00 percent lower than that of the rate of 90 percent for CY 2019.



The non-liquidation of the cash advances was due to the failure of the accountable officers to submit the complete liquidation papers as required within the prescribed period.



The prior years’ balance of cash advances amounting to P1.699 million had been dormant for more than five years and still for reconciliation and adjustment and with reference to Observation No. 8 on dormant accounts not requested for write-off for which the accountant failed to do this year due to limited access to the office records caused by the restrictions during lockdown due to pandemic. 



Management commented that the Accounting Division sent a demand letter dated February 10, 2021 to the accountable officer for the cash advance of P0.019 million granted in August 14, 2019 for clothing allowance (Master’s Degree Program in Industry and Policy for the period August 08, 2019 to December 14, 2020) and the liquidation documents were submitted on March 1, 2021. The cash advance amounting to P0.382 million granted on December 11, 2020 for One-day Workshop/Assessment and Seminar has been liquidated and recorded in the books under JEV No. 2021-01-000187 dated January 25, 2021 and liquidation report was submitted to the Audit Team on February 10, 2021.



This is a reiteration of prior year’s observation. 



We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Accountable Officers to strictly observe the liquidation of the cash advances and the Accountant to reconcile the prior year balance of P1.699 million pursuant to the provisions of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997.











Non-liquidation of fund transfers to implementing agencies



6)	Fund transfer to CITEM during the year amounting to P1.000 million for the implementation of the agency’s project was not liquidated.  Also, there were still unliquidated fund transfers in prior years to various NGAs amounting to ₱21.320 million or 94.58 percent of prior year’s balance of P22.543 million.



The following are the guidelines, among others, on the grant, utilization and liquidation of funds transferred to Implementing Agencies (IAs), pursuant to COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994:



“Sec. 4.6 Within ten (10) days after the end of each month/end of the agreed period for the Project, the IA shall submit the Report of Checks Issued (RCI) and the Report of Disbursement (RD) to report the utilization of the funds.  Only actual project expenses shall be reported.  The reports shall be approved by the Head of the IA.



Sec. 4.9 The IA shall return to the SA any unused balance upon completion of the project.



Fund transfer of P1.000 million during the year for the implementation of the agency’s project to Center for International Trade Expositions and Missions (CITEM) was not liquidated.  Also, there were still unliquidated fund transfers in prior years to various National Government Agencies (NGAs) amounting to P3.283  million and P18.037 million, due and not yet due, respectively,  in the total amount of  P21.320 million or 94.58 percent of prior years’ balance  of P22.543 million, shown as follows:

This is a reiteration of a prior year observation.  The liquidation rate of 5.20 percent for CY 2020 is remarkably lower by 40.80 percent as compared with the rate of 46 percent in CY 2019.



Management commented that demand letters were already sent on various dates to the CITE-DTI, DOST-MIDRC and CITEM. 



Moreover, for CITE-DTI, close coordination with the DTI CO concerned officials will be made by the management for the submission of supporting documents and another demand letter will be sent.

 

We recommended and Management agreed to:



a)	direct the Accountant to monitor the liquidation considering that demand letters were already sent to IAs;  



b)	require the Accountant to continue the close coordination with the DTI CO concerned officials and send another demand letter for CITE-DTI; and



c)	request from the concerned NGA heads to immediately submit the required liquidation reports together with the supporting documents to report the utilization of funds and to return any unused balance to fully settle the outstanding accounts with the BOI, especially for   the completed projects and enforce the provisions of COA Circular No. 94-013.



Non-liquidation of fund transfer to PS



7)	Fund transfers to PS  in prior years for BOI’s  procurement of airline tickets for domestic trips and office supplies amounting to P0.308 million and  P0.502 million , respectively, totaling P 0.810 million  or 38.98 percent of the fund transferred  of P2.078 million were not liquidated as of year-end.  



COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994 sets the rules and regulations in the grant, utilization and liquidation of funds transferred from the Source Agency (SA) to the Implementing Agency (IA). The SA shall require the submission by the IA of the Report of Checks Issued (RCI) and the Report of Disbursement (RD) to report the utilization of the funds transferred within ten (10) days after the end of each month/end of agreed period for the Project; and the return to the SA of any unused balance upon completion of the project.

The undelivered goods from PS DBM deprived the agency of its timely use of the items necessary in its operations.



Management commented that the General Services and Accounting Divisions were instructed to coordinate and reconcile the records with the PS DBM for the undelivered goods and adjustments shall be made accordingly after reconciliation. 



We recommended and Management agreed to continue the close coordination with PS-DBM for the delivery of the remaining balance, request replacement of the items not available in their stock, and consume the remaining balance of the GFA fund for travel as permitted.













Dormant receivables not requested for write-off



8)	Dormant unliquidated fund transfers and cash advances amounting to P1.743 million were not requested for write-off.

Section 5.5 of COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016 defines  “Dormant Unliquidated Cash Advances - advances granted to disbursing officers, agency officers and employees which remained non-moving for ten (10) years or more and where settlement/collectability could no longer be ascertained.”



Section 5.6 of the same Circular defines that “Dormant Unliquidated Fund Transfers – advances granted by the source entity to implementing entity for the implementation of programs/projects which remained non-moving for ten years or more and where settlement could no longer be ascertained.”



Section 8.2 “The Head of the government entity shall file the request for authority to write-off dormant receivable accounts, unliquidated cash advances, and fund transfers to the COA Audit Team Leader (ATL) and/or Supervising Auditor.”



The agency’s Assessment Report on Fund Transfer to NGAs and Unliquidated Cash Advances as of December 31, 2020 showed the following dormant accounts subject for write off:

The prior years’ balance of cash advances amounting to P1.699 million had been dormant for more than five years and still for reconciliation and adjustment and with reference to observation No. 5 on unliquidated cash advances for which the accountant failed to do a reconciliation this year due to limited access to the office records caused by the restrictions during the pandemic situation. 



This is a reiteration of a prior year observation.  The existence of the dormant accounts is contrary to Section 8.2 of COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016. 



Management commented that in compliance with COA Circular No. 2016-005, they already sent a letter on June 17, 2020 to DTI Central Office requesting the required certification documents to support their request for write-off of the dormant unliquidated fund transfers amounting to P0.044 million. However, a response or comment has yet to be received from DTI. 



Regarding the unliquidated cash advances amounting to P1.700 million, a reconciliation will be made once they retrieved the necessary documents and records to support the write-off.  Then, they will submit a request for authority to write-off the said accounts after the reconciliation.



We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Accountant to follow up their request with the DTI CO and coordinate with the record-keeper in gathering the complete documents to support the request for authority to write-off the dormant unliquidated fund transfer and cash advances in accordance with COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016.



Insurance of physical assets with GSIS



9)	The BOI insured with the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) property with book value of P 45.475 million and appraised value of P75.552 million with corresponding insurance premiums paid in the amount of P0.407 million, in accordance with Republic Act (RA) No. 656, otherwise known as the “Property Insurance Law” as amended by Presidential Decree No. 245 dated July 13, 1973.  



Non-disposal of unserviceable property



10)	Unserviceable property with book value of P46.190 million remained not disposed of, thus, exposing them to further deterioration and decreasing their realizable value.



Section 79 of Presidential Decree No. 1445 states that “When government property has become unserviceable for any cause, or is no longer needed, it shall, upon application of the officer accountable therefore, be inspected by the head of the agency or his duly authorized representative in the presence of the auditor concerned and, if found to be valueless or unsalable, it may be destroyed in their presence. If found to be valuable, it may be sold at public auction to the highest bidder under the supervision of the proper committee an award or similar body in the presence of the auditor concerned or other duly authorized representative of the Commission, x x x.”



The agency reported during the year PPE and Semi-expendable Property considered unserviceable amounting to P45.573 million and P0.617 million, respectively.  There was no disposal made as of year-end.  Details are as follow:

BOI planned and scheduled during the year the disposal of the above unserviceable items as listed in their Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) as of December 31, 2020. But due to the restrictions during lockdowns caused by the pandemic, no disposal was made.



Non-disposal of the unserviceable PPE exposes them to various risks such as loss, destruction and further deterioration which may result in a decreased realizable value.



Management commented that there is a proposed schedule of disposal of the said unserviceable property to be conducted starting March 2021 to November 2021.   Such planned schedule of disposal may be adjusted accordingly if the reason or cause for non-disposal is beyond the control of BOI.



We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Property Officer to conduct the disposal of the unserviceable property as scheduled in November 2021, in accordance with Section 79 of PD No. 1445 to prevent further deterioration and realize possible income therefrom.



Delayed/Non-submission of government contracts



11)	Copy of 70 government contracts, purchase orders and their supporting documents with corresponding amount of P22.576 million were not submitted within the prescribed period, with delays ranging from one to 33 days as of year-end, thus, affecting the timely review and communication to management of any deficiencies that may be found in audit.  The contracts and POs were reviewed and all the required supporting documents were complete.



Section 3.1.1 of  COA Circular 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009 states that “within five (5) working days from the execution of a contract by the government or any of its subdivisions, agencies or instrumentalities, xxx, a copy of said contract and each of all the documents forming part thereof by reference or incorporation shall be furnished to the Auditor of the agency concerned.”



Likewise, Section 3.2.1 of the above circular states that “a copy of any purchase order irrespective of amount, and each and every supporting document, shall, within five (5) working days from issuance thereof, be submitted to the Auditor concerned.”



BOI has submitted on time six government contracts amounting to P0.434 million and 15 purchase orders (POs) amounting to P1.905 million. However, delays were noted on the submission of 70 contracts and POs and supporting documents in the total amount of P22.576. All submitted contracts and POs were reviewed and found to be complete and in order.



Government contracts and POs and their supporting documents for CY 2020 with delays ranging from 1 to 33 days are as follows:

The Property and Human Resource officers are in charge with the submission of the contracts and POs and their failure to submit on time affected the timely review of the documents.



This is a reiteration of last year’s observation, with updates.



Management commented that the delay in the submission of contracts and POs was unintentional due to the impact of the unexpected lockdown brought about by the pandemic. Also, the General Service Division (GSD) has to cope with administrative and work challenges due to the resignation of two employees directly in charge of the monitoring of the said documents.



We recommended and Management agreed to require the Property and Human Resource officers to submit all copies of BOI contracts and POs together with the supporting documents within the prescribed period pursuant to existing rules and regulations and assign personnel to take charge in monitoring and submission of the required documents.

However, monthly remittance was not in full leaving a balance of P2.800 million, consisting of current and prior year balances of P2.440 million  and P0.360 million , respectively.  Of the balance of P2.800 million as of December 31, 2020, only P2.440 million was subsequently remitted, leaving an unremitted balance of P0.360 million or 12.86 percent which is not in accordance with regulation.

If the employer fails to withhold and remit the correct amount of tax as required to be withheld xxx, such tax shall be collected from the employer together with the penalties or additions to the tax otherwise applicable in respect to such failure to withhold and remit.”

Tax remittances were filed thru the Electronic Filing and Payment System (eFPS).

	

BOI properly withheld and remitted timely taxes on gross compensation income from officials and employees and government purchases and contracts from suppliers/contractors during the year. However, monthly remittances were not in full amount as withheld thus, as of December 31, 2020, the unremitted balance of taxes withheld amounted to P2.800 million, arrived at as follows:

Of the balance of P2.800 million as of December 31, 2020, only P2.440 million was subsequently remitted in January 2021, leaving an unremitted balance of P0.360 million or 12.86 percent which is not in accordance with regulation. The non-remittance in full of the amount withheld is not in consonance with Section 80 of the National Internal Revenue Code.

This is a reiteration of last year’s observation on the remaining unremitted taxes, with updates.

Management commented that it is committed to withhold and remit all the withheld taxes on time. They will prepare a schedule of reconciliation for this account and will make necessary adjustments and remittance once identified.

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Chief Accountant to continue to fast track their reconciliation and remit the remaining balance to the BIR; and henceforth, to ensure full remittance of monthly taxes withheld.

	Hiring of and payment to job orders, contractual and consultants

	

16)	During the year, the agency hired 71 individuals covered with 13 Contract of Service (COS) and 58 Job Orders/Service providers on a semestral basis, in accordance with CSC-COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2, s. 2020, dated October 20, 2020, to augment the regular plantilla employees of 212, due to implementation of the Rationalization Plan which minimized the number of positions of the Center.  Their salaries were charged against Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE)- Other Professional Services in the total amount of P30.191 million.



	Inadequate allocation and utilization of fund for GAD programs/activities



17)	Of the total BOI appropriations of P415.358 million, only the amount of P0.664 million or 0.16 percent was allocated for GAD programs and activities, which is below the five percent threshold.  Also, the planned activities were not fully implemented with the fund utilization of only P0.367 million or 55.27 percent of the allocated fund.



	Section 31 of RA No. 11465 or the General Appropriations Act of FY 2020 states that “All agencies of the government shall Formulate a Gender and Development (GAD) Plan designed to address issues within their concerned sectors or mandate and implement the applicable provisions under R.A. No. 9710 or the Magna Carta of Women, Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the Beijing Platform for Action, the Philippine Plan for Gender-Responsive Development (1995-2025) and the Philippine Development Plan (2017-2022).



	“The GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of the agencies, which shall be at least five percent (5%) of their budgets. For this purpose, activities currently being undertaken by agencies which relate to GAD or those that contribute to poverty alleviation, economic empowerment especially of marginalized women, protection, promotion, and fulfillment of women’s human rights, and practice of gender-responsive governance are considered sufficient compliance with said requirement. Utilization of the GAD budget shall be evaluated based on the GAD performance indicators identified by said agencies.”



GAD Plan and Budget showed that the agency allotted for its GAD Plan and Implementation in the amount of P0.664 million or 0.18 percent of its total appropriations of P370.771 million, which is below the five percent threshold in RA No. 11465 or the General Appropriations Act (GAA) for FY 2020.



The Annual GAD Accomplishment Report for CY 2020, however, revealed that the agency expended only P0.367 million which is 55.27 percent of the allocated budget of P0.664 million or 0.18 percent of its appropriation of P370.771, due to restrictions brought about by the CoVid 19 pandemic, which is beyond the control of the agency.

BOI was able to implement only the activities involving advocacy campaign on GAD due to the revisions made on the GAD Plan.  Hence, the allocated budget was not fully utilized.



BOI will continue to review the plans, activities and programs to identify possible gender issues that may be attributed to the GAD plan.



Management commented that the GAD plan was revised due to the restrictions on face-to-face meetings, events and travels brought about by the pandemic.  Also, in compliance with NBC 580 dated April 22, 2020 on the Adoption of Economy Measures in the Government Due to the Emergency Health Situation, the BOI’s budget which included the appropriated GAD Budget that could not be implemented due to the said restrictions were realigned and only a portion of the fund was offered to partially generate the required amount to implement the national policy to address the COVID-19 situation.



We recommended and Management agreed to ensure that the activities specified in the approved GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) be accomplished to address the identified issues in the GPB and allocate GAD fund within the five percent threshold.

Audit suspensions, disallowances and charges



21)	There was no Notice of Suspension (NS), Notice of Disallowance (ND) or Notice of Charge (NC) issued for transactions audited during the year.  However, prior year disallowances which are under appeal and on-going monthly installments amounting to P16.279 million still exist and only the amount of P0.245 million or 1.51 percent was issued with corresponding Notice of Settlement of Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges (NSSDC) during the year, leaving an unsettled disallowances amounting to P16.034 million as of year-end.



Section 5.4 of Chapter II of COA Circular 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009 states that “An audit suspension or disallowance/charge shall be settled by the persons responsible or liable therefor through compliance with the requirements, or payment/restitution or by any of the modes of extinguishment of obligation provided by law, respectively. A Notice of Settlement of Suspensions /Disallowance/Charge (NSSDC) shall be issued for such settlement.”

For CY 2020, no NS, ND or NC was issued for transactions audited during the year. Of the prior years’ disallowances amounting to P16.279 million, only P0.245 million or 1.51 percent was settled during the year through continuous salary deduction of the persons liable duly approved by the Commission on Audit, leaving a balance of P16.034 million as of December 31, 2020, which are under appeal and review. The prior years’ disallowances pertain to claims for CNA, BAC honoraria, salary differential and other charges paid to various employees (some of whom are resigned or separated from the service) and other payors without authority and/or legal basis. 



The settlements during the year of P0.245 million was lower by P0.062 million or 20 percent than that of last year’s P 0.307 million since most of the collections were from retired/separated/transferred employees which happened to be more in CY 2019 than in CY 2020.



Management commented that it is consistent in sending demand letters to employees and those who have resigned or separated employees who received sum of money which were disallowed by COA. Meanwhile, collections of ND under appeal may not be pursued pending the resolution and finality of the cases. BOI requires employees who are transferring to another government office to refund or execute an undertaking to settle said disallowance immediately after receipt of COE/NFD   amounting to P765.852 million and P17.494 million.



We recommended and Management agreed to ensure/enforce prompt settlement of all audit disallowances, particularly those that have become final and executory, pursuant to COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009 on the prescribed use of the RRSA. 



COVID-19 Related Expenses Charged to Regular Fund



22)	BOI spent P5.817  million for the procurement of various goods such as surgical face masks, gloves, face shields, thermometers disinfecting/cleaning supplies and services  directly related to the  mitigation and containment of the transmission of CoVid 19 in accordance with National Budget Circular (NBC) No. 580 dated April 22, 2020 – Adoption of Economy Measures in the Government Due to the Emergency Health Situation, as well as with all subsequent issuances by the DBM and government agencies to implement the provisions of R.A. 11469  and 11494 dated March 24, 2020 and September 11, 2020, otherwise known as Bayanihan to Heal as One Act and Bayanihan To Recover as One Act, respectively, including the laws, rules and regulations on disbursements.



Other Audit Issues

	

	Unadjusted Property Records



23)	A discrepancy of P2.374 was noted between the books and the property records due to non-reconciliation of the PPELC and the RPCPPE at year-end.  However, upon reconciliation, it was established that the discrepancy pertains to adjustments in property records.

	

Section 42, Chapter 10 of GAM, Vol. I provides that “… For check and balance, the Property and Supply Office/Unit shall likewise maintain PC for PPE in their custody to account for the receipt and disposition of the same.  The balance per PC shall be reconciled with PPELC maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit.  They shall also be reconciled with other property records like PAR”.



Audit disclosed that the Property, Plant and Equipment Ledger Card (PPELC) maintained by the Accounting Section and the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) prepared by the Property Section had a discrepancy of P2.374.  Shown below is the breakdown of the discrepancy:
