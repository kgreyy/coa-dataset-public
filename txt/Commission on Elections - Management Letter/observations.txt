have audited the accounts and operations of the Commission on Elections 
(COMELEC) for the year ended December 31, 2020. The audit was conducted in 
accordance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, and generally 
accepted state auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and 
perform the audit to obtain a reasonable basis for our conclusions. 

 
2. The audit was conducted to: a) ascertain the propriety of the financial transactions 

and operations of the agency; b) ascertain compliance with prescribed rules and

3. We wish to bring to your attention our audit observations and recommendations 

which were communicated through Audit Observation Memoranda (AOM) to the 
concerned officials of the COMELEC. The summary of audit observations and 
recommendations were sent to Management on May 18 2021 and their responses

Detailed Audit Observations and Recommendations 

 

NON-FINANCIAL ISSUES 

 
Delayed submission of Financial Statements 
 
6. The undue delay in the submission of the Monthly Trial Balance (TB) and its 

supporting schedules from September to December 2020 and the quarterly 

Financial Statements (FS) for the last two quarters of CY 2020 precluded the 

Audit Team in reviewing and evaluating the agency transactions and 

operations to obtain sufficient audit evidence in rendering an audit opinion 

on the financial statements of the COMELEC. 

 
6.1 Financial/Accounting Reports are effective tools of Management and the 

Auditor in rendering and arriving at important decisions and audit actions; 
such timely submission of these reports results in their effective utilization. 
It is imperative that these reports be kept current and accurate. A late report 
opens the door to irregularities and fails to immediately disclose faulty and 
wasteful operations. 

 

6.2 Section 60, Chapter 19 of the GAM, Volume I, provides that all National 
Government Agencies shall prepare and submit the following FS and 
schedules within the prescribed deadlines as follows: 

 
Table No. 1 – Deadlines on Submission of Reports

6.3 As of this writing, the TB from September to December 2020, the quarterly 

financial statements for the last two quarters of 2020 and the complete 
components of the year-end financial statements have not yet been submitted 
to the Audit Team despite constant verbal and written follow-ups made. The

6.4 It is worthy to mention that no BRS for CY 2020 was submitted as of to 

date. The late submission of BRS resulted in the difficulty of ascertaining 
the accuracy of the Cash in Bank balances reflected in the books of the 
agency and in the depository banks. Moreover, possible errors or items 
requiring adjustment by the bank or in the books of the agency cannot be 
corrected accordingly. 



15 
 

6.5 The non-submission of the aforementioned reports within the prescribed 
period hampered the timely verification thereof, performance of appropriate 
audit actions and early detection of errors or discrepancies, if any.  

 
6.6 The same observation was already raised in the prior year’s audit report; 

however, to date, the audit recommendation has not been fully complied 
with and the delay had become unusually lengthy.  

 
6.7 We reiterated our previous recommendations that Management require 

the Chief Accountant to: 

 

a. Promptly record the financial transactions in the books of accounts 
and ensure strict compliance with existing rules and regulations on 

the timely submission of Financial Statements, Financial Reports and 

transaction documents within the period prescribed thereof; and 

 

b. Cause the immediate submission of paid disbursement vouchers and 
its supporting documents, official receipts, liquidation reports, 

payrolls and bank reconciliation statements and other required 

reports/documents for CY 2020 for audit and final custody. 

 

6.8 Management commented that: 
 

a. The Accounting Division (AD) humbly acknowledged the delay in the 
submission of the FS and the necessary supporting documents of the 
Commission for CY 2020. The AD was also able to submit the TB and 
FS for the period February to August 2020 considering the skeletal 
workforce arrangement being implemented by the Commission due to the 
COVID-19 pandemic; and  

 
b. The AD is exerting its best effort to submit the FS for CY 2020, 

however, due to COVID-19 surge which resulted in temporary closure of 
COMELEC Departments and Offices in Intramuros from 11 to 24 March 
2021 and extension of ECQ in the NCR Plus from 05 to 11 April 2021 
wherein except for those authorized to physically report for work, all 
personnel in the main office shall continue to be on “Work from Home” 
status; and  assured that once the situation gets better and it is already 
safe to report to work, they  will exert  their best efforts to immediately 
submit the remaining reports required for CY 2020 including the Bank 
Reconciliation Statements.

FINANCIAL ISSUES 
 
Unreliable balance of Cash-Collecting Officers account – ₱10.822 million 
 

7. The accuracy and reliability of the balance of the Cash – Collecting Officers 
account amounting to ₱10.822 million as at August 31, 2020 could not be 

ascertained due to: a) existence of negative Subsidiary Ledger (SL) balances 

totaling ₱4.782 million; and b) inclusion of non-moving SL captioned as  

“For Reconciliation” amounting to ₱1.459 million without details, thus, 

resulted in misstatement of the account in the financial statements. Moreover, 

of the 1,732 Accountable Officers nationwide, 1,287 or 74 percent were not 

bonded or with expired fidelity bond. Further, some AOs were bonded twice 

with overlapping period ranging from 6 to 12 months, hence, wastage of fund 

resources.  

 

7.1     Appendix 6 of the GAM, Volume II provides that: 
 

a) the SL shows detail for each control account in the General Ledger (GL) 
which is maintained per account and fund cluster by the Accounting 
Division. 

 
c) At the end of each month, after all transactions in the journals have been 

posted, the debit and credit columns of each account shall be footed in 
pencil and the balance indicated in ink. The totals of the SL balances 
shall be reconciled with the corresponding GL controlling account. 

 
d) At the end of the fiscal year, each SL shall be ruled and closed.  All totals 

shall be written legibly in ink and the balance of the account carried 
forward as the opening balance of the new SL for the next fiscal year. 

 
7.2    Section 111 of PD 1445 states that the accounts of an agency shall be kept in 

such detail as is necessary to meet the needs of the agency and at the same 
time be adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or control 
agencies of the Government. 

 

7.3   Section 4.10 of Treasury Circular No. 02-2009 dated August 6, 2009 
provides that an approved bond shall be non-transferrable and personal to 
the accountable officer and shall remain valid and effective for one year 
from the time of payment and receipt of the bond premium. The fidelity 
bond shall be subject to renewal yearly before the expiration of the present 
bond coverage, while the accountable public officer is holding such position 
for which he was bonded. Failure to renew shall consider such bond as 
automatically cancelled and shall have no legal effect. 

 

7.4 The Cash-Collecting Officers account, which is used to recognize the 
amount of collections with the Collecting Officers (COs)/Election Officers 



17 
 

(EOs) for remittance to the Treasurer of the Philippines/deposit to AGDBs 
had a balance of P10,822,167.79 as at August 31, 2020.  

 
7.5    Verification of the account disclosed the following: 

 
a. Existence of negative Sub-Subsidiary Ledger (Sub-SL) balances of 

various COs – ₱4.782 million 
 

7.6     It was noted that of the 1,732 COs, 707 or 41 percent have negative Sub-SL 
balances totaling ₱4,781,564.96, resulting in a significant decrease in the 
total balance of the account. Details are in Table No. 3.

Total 707 P(4,781,564.96) 

 

7.7    Inquiry with the AD disclosed that majority of the negative SL balances can 
be attributed to the set-up of beginning balances as at January 01, 2017 and 
still in the process of reconciliation.  It was noted however that as of date, 
only minimal adjustments have been made on the said accounts.  
 

7.8   The existence of negative SL balances was due to lack of proper monitoring, 
update and analysis of the respective SL accounts, which significantly 
affects the true balance of the account, contrary to the above-cited 
provisions. 

 
b. Inclusion of SL captioned as “For Reconciliation” – ₱1.459 million 

 
7.9   Also noted is the inclusion of SL captioned as “For Reconciliation” with a 

balance of ₱1,459,169.60, wherein the nature and details of which could not 



18 
 

be verified. The account had no movement since CY 2018, hence, no 
analysis/reconciliation was made to adjust the same. 
 

7.10 The existence of the SL - “For Reconciliation” further casts doubt on the 
reliability of the Cash – Collecting Officers account. 

 
c. Accountable Officers (AOs) not bonded or with expired fidelity bonds 

 
7.11  Records show that 1,287 or 74 percent of the 1,732 AOs assigned at 

different COMELEC Offices were not bonded or with expired fidelity bond, 
summarized per region in Table No. 4. 

 
Table No. 4 – Schedule of Accountable Officers without/Expired Bond

XII 57 23 40% 
CARAGA 80 32 40% 
BARMM 127 18 14% 
Total 1732 445 26% 

 
7.12 The above AOs continued the discharge of their cashiering function despite 

their expired fidelity bonds, thus, the COMELEC is exposed to risk of not 
being indemnified in case of loss, misuse or misapplication of funds.  

 
d. AOs with overlapped bonds 

 
7.13 It was also noted that some AOs were bonded twice with overlapping period 

ranging from 6 to 12 months. Details are shown in Table No. 5.

7.14 The absence of proper monitoring in the application, expiration and renewal 

of bonds resulted in wastage of resources.  
 

7.15 We reiterated our recommendation that Management require the 
Accounting Division to expedite the analysis and reconciliation of SLs 

with negative balances and the SL captioned as “For Reconciliation” 

and make the necessary adjustment/s, if warranted, to come up with a 

more realistic balance of the account. 

 

7.16 We further recommended that Management direct the Finance Services 
Department to establish and implement an effective monitoring system 

on the application, expiration and renewal of bonds for proper bonding 

of AOs, timely renewal thereof to avoid wastage of resources. 

 
7.17 Management commented that: 

 
a. The AD will exert its best efforts to reconcile and to reflect immediately 

any necessary adjustments in the books thru the eNGAS; and adhere to 
the audit recommendation of expediting the analysis and reconciliation of 
the SL captioned as “For Reconciliation” in the Cash-Collecting Officers 
account. The AD has assigned personnel to focus and do the 
reconciliation and analysis of the cash accounts.  

 
b. FSD was directed to monitor the process of application and renewal of 

fidelity bonds of the AOs. FSD had already assigned personnel from the 
AD who will review the current process of bond application and renewal 
and to implement any necessary changes to improve the process. The 
assigned personnel will also aid the processor in reviewing and checking 



20 
 

all the bond applications before payment and approval. FSD has also 
directed the processor and the other concerned personnel to submit 
regularly the status of the application and renewal of bonds to the 
Information Technology Department (ITD) for its immediate 
dissemination; and 

 
c. The FSD is finalizing the tool to be used in monitoring the status of 

fidelity bond’s applications for renewal and will make every possible 
effort to improve the process. 

 
 
Unreliable balance of Cash in Bank – Local Currency, Current Account – ₱2.277 
billion 
 
8. The balance of the Cash in Bank – LCCA account amounting to ₱2.277 billion 

as at August 31, 2020 is unreliable due to: a) unreconciled variance between 

book and bank balances totaling ₱1.456 billion; and b) existence of SLs 

captioned as “For Reconciliation” amounting to ₱302.801 million.  

 

8.1 Section 74 of PD 1445 requires that at the close of each month, depositories 
shall report to the agency head, the condition of the agency account standing 
on their books.  The head of the agency shall see to it that reconciliation is 
made between the balance shown in the reports and the balance found in the 
books of the agency. (Underscoring supplied) 

 
8.2 Sections 5, 6 and 7, Chapter 21 of the GAM, Volume I require the 

preparation and submission of BRSs to the COA Resident Auditor within 20 
days after receipt of the monthly bank statement and the preparation of 
journal entry vouchers by the Chief Accountant/Designated Staff to 
recognize all reconciling items that require adjustment and correction in the 
books of accounts. 

 
8.3 The Cash in Bank – LCCA account of the COMELEC had a balance of 

₱2,276,657,562.35 as at August 31, 2020, consisting of three active bank 
accounts maintained at the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) and one 
active bank account maintained at the Development Bank of the Philippines 
(DBP). 

 
8.4  Verification of the account disclosed the following: 

 
a. Discrepancies between the balance per book and per bank – ₱1.456 

billion 
 

8.5 It was noted that the SL balances per books do not reconcile with the 
balance per bank statement or a variance of ₱1,455,799,508.47, contrary to 
Section 74 of PD 1445. Details are shown in Table No. 6.

Total  2,276,657,562.35   820,858,053.88  1,455,799,508.47  

 
8.6 The details of said variance could not be determined owing to the perennial 

delay in the preparation and submission of the BRS. The non-preparation 
and/or delayed preparation/submission of the BRS not only hampered the 
determination of the accuracy and correctness of the Cash in Bank accounts 
but also a breakdown of internal control that posed the risk of an unnoticed 
loss of asset.  

 
8.7 It is noteworthy to mention that the latest submitted BRS for the Trust Fund, 

Payroll Fund and DBP were November 2019, December 2019 and 
November 2018, respectively, hence, no BRS was submitted for CY 2020. 

 
8.8 Moreover, the SL captioned as “Others” (For Reconciliation) account 

included two closed bank accounts namely the Continues Form Checks and 
the Automatic Transfer Account amounting to ₱15,890,286.20 and 
₱149,392.29, respectively, or a total of ₱16,039,678.49 which remain 
recorded in the books, but confirmed closed by the bank, thus, overstated the 
balance of the Cash in Bank – LCCA account by the same amount. 

 
b. Existence of SLs captioned only as “For Reconciliation” - ₱302.801 

million 
 

8.9 It was also noted that ₱302,801,239.29 or 13 percent of the total balance of 
the account represents SL captioned as “For Reconciliation,” wherein the 
nature and details of which could not be verified. The balance continued to 
exist since CY 2014 and become non-moving since CY 2018, hence, no 
extensive reconciliation has been done to determine the details of the said 
SLs, which further cast doubt on the accuracy and reliability of the  
Cash in Bank-LCCA account. Details are shown in Table No. 7.

2018 302,801,239.29 
2019 302,801,239.29 

 
8.10 The increase in the balance of the “For Reconciliation” account in CY 2018 

pertained to the inclusion of the two closed bank accounts as mentioned 
above. 

 
8.11 We reiterated our recommendations that Management require the 

Accounting Division to: 

 

a. Prioritize the preparation of the BRS of all Cash in Bank accounts 
and immediately make the necessary adjustment on the reconciling 

items identified such that adjusting entries on the unreconciled 

balance and on the closed bank accounts will be properly taken up in 

the books; and  

 

b. Exert extra effort to determine the details of the SLs captioned as  
“For Reconciliation”, to facilitate proper adjustment thereof for a 

fair presentation of the Cash in Bank accounts in the financial 

statements.   

 

8.12 Management commented that the variance between the book and bank 
balances was due to the following: 

 
a. DBP - the minimal difference of the book and bank balances pertained to 

the unrecorded interest income for the 1st to 3rd quarters of CY 2019. 
The said interest income will be taken up in the books of accounts upon 
receipt of the requested bank statement which serves as document 
supporting the JEV; 

 
b. Payroll Fund – the significant balance is attributable to the forwarded 

beginning balance prior to the transition from manual accounting to the 
implementation of the enhanced eNGAS in the Commission. Documents 
are still being gathered for a thorough analysis and validation of the 
account balance. If found necessary, the Accounting Division shall adjust 
the book balance of this account after it has gathered evidences to support 
the same; 

 
c. Trust Fund - being the depository bank account for the Commission’s 

collections on certification fees, authentication fees, legal fees, 
processing fees, fines and penalties, and other fees, this variance between 
the book and bank balances could be the result of the timing difference in 
recording of transactions in the books of accounts, and the physical 
deposits of monies collected nationwide. Thus, to address this situation, 



23 
 

the AD in coordination with the Office of the Provincial Supervisors, 
strictly monitors the monthly submission of RCD. This ensures that 
deposits made are reported in time for their immediate recording in the 
books of accounts; and 

 
d. Others (For Reconciliation) - the AD still needs to reconcile the closed 

accounts as the amounts shown on the documents provided by the LBP 
vary from the balance of these accounts in the books. Thus, the AD will 
request the LBP, if possible, to provide copies of bank statements of 
these accounts for the last six months before the date of closure. 

 
 
Unremitted balance of cash collections/receipts and improper maintenance of the Trust 
Fund account - ₱277.224 million 
 
9. The Trust Fund (TF) account of the COMELEC intended for the receipts 

arising from legal fees and other income was improperly maintained due to:  

a) unremitted collections/receipts with a remaining balance of ₱277.224 

million  as at August 31, 2020; b) collections of refund of cash advances/excess 

cash advances and overtime erroneously deposited to TF account totaling to 

₱11.825 million; c) collection of Legal Research Fees (LRF) amounting to 

₱0.543 million which remain unremitted to the University of the Philippines; 

and d) existence of SL captioned as “For Reconciliation”, with negative 

balance of ₱189.176 million which decreased the total balance of the account, 

thus, affecting the fair presentation of the account in the financial statements 

of the agency. 

 

9.1 Section 65 of PD 1445 provides that: 
 

(1) unless otherwise specifically provided by law, all income 
accruing to the agencies by virtue of the provisions of law, orders 
and regulations shall be deposited in the National Treasury or in 
any duly authorized government depository, and shall accrue to 
the unappropriated surplus of the General Fund of the 
Government.  

 
(2) amounts received in trust and from business-type activities of 

government may be separately recorded and disbursed in 
accordance with such rules and regulations as may be 
determined by a Permanent Committee composed of the 
Secretary (Minister) of Finance as Chairman, and the 
Commissioner of the Budget and the Chairman, Commission on 
Audit, as members. 

 
9.2 Likewise, Section 10 of the General Provisions of the General 

Appropriations Act (GAA) for FY 2020 states that departments, bureaus, 



24 
 

offices, and instrumentalities of the National Government, including 
Constitutional Offices enjoying fiscal autonomy and SUCs are mandated to 
close and revert all balances of Special Accounts, Fiduciary or Trust Funds, 
and Revolving Funds to the General Fund in any of the following instances: 
(i) when there is no legal basis for its creation; (ii) when their terms have 
expired; or (iii) when they are no longer necessary for the attainment of the 
purposes for which funds were established. 

 
9.3 Section 1 of the PD 1856, s. 1982 amending Section 4 of RA 3870 states 

that: xxx Such additional amounts shall be receipted for as part of a special 
fund to be known as the “Legal Research Fund,” and shall, upon collection, 
be immediately remitted to the University of the Philippines and deposited in 
a separate account in any authorized government depository bank in the 
name of the National Treasurer as Ex-Officio Treasurer of the U.P. under 
this Charter. 

 
9.4 The Trust Fund (TF) account maintained by the COMELEC and recorded 

under the Cash in Bank – Local Currency, Current Account is composed of 
collections from the Local Government Units intended for plebiscite, service 
fees, protest fees, cash bonds, bailiff fees, guaranty/security deposits and 
other income.  As at August 31, 2020, the Trust Fund account had a balance 
of ₱733,999,109.17, broken down in Table No. 8.

9.5 Verification of the account disclosed the following: 
 

a. Unremitted balance of collections/receipts arising from service fees and 
other income – ₱277.224 million 

 
9.6 It was noted that as at August 31, 2020, collections/receipts of service fees 

such as voters certification, authentication and replacement of voters ID, 
certified true copy of voters registration record and other income had still a 
balance of ₱579,638,147.00 or 79 percent of the total balance of the TF 
account as can be gleaned from Table No. 8. 
 

9.7 In compliance with the recommendation embodied in the CY 2019 AAR to 
remit to the National Treasury (NTr) the balance of the service fees and 
other income as well as the unutilized Registration fees, the Commission 
partially remitted to the NTr the amount of  ₱302,414,585.78 for service fees 
and other income, and ₱143,400.00 for the registration fees or a  total  of  
₱302,557,985.78, under Check No. 1286102 dated December 15, 2020 with 
Official Receipt No. 7061734 dated January 4, 2021, per approved En Banc 
Minute Resolution No. 20-0370 dated August 26, 2020.  

 
9.8 The AD informed that the remaining balance of the service income was still 

subject for further reconciliation since some collections were continuously 
deposited to the TF account. As of date, the service fees and other income 
had still a balance of ₱277,223,561.22 which remain unreconciled and 
unremitted to the NTr, contrary to the above-cited regulations, depriving the 
government of additional resources that could be utilized for priority 
projects. 

 
b. Collections of refund of cash advances/excess cash advances erroneously 

deposited to TF account –₱11.825 million 
 
9.9 Also, various collections of refund of cash advances/excess cash advances 

and overtime totaling ₱853,705.31 were still deposited and recorded under 
the TF account instead of the Fiscal Autonomy (FA) Fund as shown in Table 
No. 9. In addition, collections for the FA Fund of ₱10,971,129.07 were also 
erroneously deposited under the TF account as shown in Table No. 8, or a 
total of ₱11,824,834.38 thus, overstating the TF account and understating 
the appropriate Cash–in-Bank, Local Currency, Current Account (CIB-
LCCA) – FA by the same amount.

26 
 

c. Unremitted collection of Legal Research Fees (LRF) to UP - ₱0.543 
million 

 
9.10 It was also noted that collections of LRF intended for the University of the 

Philippines increased to ₱543,078.00 from ₱540,778.00 as at December 31, 
2019 and remain unremitted, as of date, despite the approval of its 
remittance under Commission En Banc Minute Resolution No. 20-0370 
dated August 26, 2020; hence, overstated the TF account. 

 
d. Existence of SL captioned as “For Reconciliation” with negative balance 
– ₱189.176 million 

 
9.11 It could also be gleaned from Table No. 8 the continued existence of SL 

captioned as “For Reconciliation” with an increased negative balance of 
₱189,175,729.58 from last year’s previous balance of ₱180,857,661.90, 
wherein the nature and details of which could not be verified and 
significantly decreased the balance of the TF account. 

 
9.12 The AD commented that the reconciliation to identify the composition of the 

“For Reconciliation” is still on-going. 
 

9.13 The same observation was also raised in the CY 2019 AAR, wherein courses 
of actions were recommended, but some remain unimplemented. 

 
9.14 We reiterated our recommendations that Management require the 

Accounting Division to: 

 

a. Remit to the National Treasury the remaining balance of the service 
fees and other income amounting to ₱277,223,561.22 pursuant to 

Section 44, Chapter 5, Book VI of EO 292, s. 1987, Section 10 of the 

General Provisions of the GAA FY 2020 and Section 65 of PD 1445. 

Consider to require the remittance of the monthly collection of 

service fees directly to the National Treasury to augment the scarce 

resources of the Government; 

 

b. Reclassify the recorded collections of refund of cash advances/excess 
cash advances and overtime erroneously deposited to the Trust Fund 

account and prepare the journal entry voucher to effect the proper 

adjustments thereto;   

 

c. Remit the collections of the Legal Research Fees of ₱543,078.00 to 
the University of the Philippines as required under Section 1 of PD 

1856, s. 1982, thereafter, remit regularly the collections of LRF to the 

UP as required; and 

 



27 
 

d. Expedite the analysis and reconciliation of the SL captioned as  
“For Reconciliation” and make the necessary adjustments,  

if warranted, to come up with a more realistic balance of the account. 

 
9.15 Management commented that: 

 
a. The AD will determine the amount to be remitted after reviewing and 

verifying the unremitted balance of collections as of date and will submit 
its recommendation to the Commission En Banc for its approval. The 
field officers have likewise started remitting their collections directly to 
the Treasury Account of the Commission in compliance with COMELEC 
Minute Resolution No. 19-1113 dated 20 November 2019; 

 
b. The AD will prepare journal entry voucher to reflect the necessary 

adjustments/reclassification for the recorded collections of refund of cash 
advances/excess cash advances erroneously deposited to the Trust Fund 
Account amounting to P11,104,863.84. The Accounting Division is 
regularly monitoring erroneous deposits being made and also 
coordinating with the concerned accountable officers to prevent errors in 
depositing to other accounts. This was also emphasized during the series 
of webinar on Financial, Property and Records Management and 
Accountability, and Project Procurement Management Plan (PPMP), 
Purchase Request and Technical Specifications Preparation with the field 
officers held in October and November 2020; 

 
c. The disbursement voucher for the remittance of legal research fees with 

DV No. 21-05-861 is currently being processed and the Accounting 
Division is also communicating with the UP System for the immediate 
and proper remittance of the said amount; and 

 
d. It will adhere to the audit recommendation of expediting the analysis and 

reconciliation of the SL captioned as “For Reconciliation” in the Cash 
LCCA account. The Accounting Division personnel are exerting their 
best efforts to retrieve records and files to expedite the reconciliation 
process and prepare any necessary adjusting entries. 

 
 
Dormant and Unreliable balance of Inter-Agency Receivables account – ₱1.049 billion 
 
10. The balance of the Inter-Agency Receivables account as at August 31, 2020 

amounting to ₱1.049 billion could not be ascertained due to: a) the existence 

of dormant balances amounting to ₱806.422 million or 77 percent of the total 

balance; and b) existence of SLs captioned as “For Reconciliation” with a 

negative balance of ₱74.033 million.  

 



28 
 

10.1 As at August 31, 2020, the Inter-Agency Receivables account of the 
COMELEC had a book balance of ₱1,048,959,716.43 composed of the 
following:

Total ₱1,048,959,716.43 

 
10.2 Review of Inter-Agency Receivables account revealed the following: 

 
a. Dormant accounts – ₱806.422 million 

 
10.3 Section 5.6 of COA Circular No. 2016-005 defines dormant unliquidated 

fund transfers as advances granted by the source entity to implementing 
entity for the implementation of programs/projects which remained non-
moving for 10 years or more and where settlement could no longer be 
ascertained. 

 
10.4 It was noted that receivables aggregating to ₱806,421,597.54 or 77 percent 

of the total Inter-Agency Receivables account remained dormant for 10 
years and above. Details are broken down in Table No. 11.

29 
 

10.5 As can be gleaned from Table No. 11, transfers of funds to various agencies 
amounting to ₱806,421,597.54 remain unliquidated and dormant for more 
than 10 years. These transfers were mostly for election-related activities and 
considering the length of time these have been recorded in the books, the 
intended activities for the transfer had been completed, however, the 
advances to these implementing agencies remain unliquidated.  

 
10.6 Moreover, ₱656,251,328.16 or 81 percent of the dormant balance was 

previously requested for write-off, but was returned to Management on 
September 5, 2018 for submission of additional documents and information 
before the same could be given due course. 

 
10.7 On October 21, 2020, the AD forwarded an advanced copy of the schedule 

of dormant accounts by accountable government entity duly certified by the 
Acting Chief Accountant. Included therein is a letter inquiry regarding the 
request for adjustments in the total amount requested for write-off due to the 
exclusion of the account of LGU, PT in the ARMM Region amounting to 
₱19,000.00.  It was however suggested that the omitted amount be included 
instead in the succeeding requests for write-off, since only 11 percent of the 
dormant accounts for LGU, PT was covered in the initial request for write-
off. 

 
10.8 Nonetheless, the additional documents to complete the requirements under 

the Memorandum dated August 16, 2018 of the Office of the Assistant 
Commissioner, COA have not been submitted as of date. 

 
10.9 The existence of these dormant accounts rendered the accuracy, reliability, 

and collectability of the Inter-Agency Receivables account doubtful. 
 

b. “For Reconciliation” SL account with negative amount –₱74.033 million 
 

10.10 The existence of SLs captioned as “For Reconciliation” totaling to a 
negative balance of ₱74,033,030.89 which pertained to unreconciled balance 
between the GL and SL balances, nature and details of which could not be 
verified. Details are as follows: 

 
Table No. 12 – Details of “For Reconciliation” SLs  

of Inter-agency Receivables account 

Account 
Amount of  

“For Reconciliation” 

Due from National Government Agencies (NGAs) ₱ (67,462,855.39)

Due from Government Owned and/or Controlled 
Corporations (GOCCs) 85,895.40 
Total ₱ (74,033,030.89) 

 
10.11 The existence of SL balances without details casts doubt on the accuracy of 

the account balance. Considering that the Inter-Agency Receivables account 



30 
 

is an asset account, the negative SL balances decreased the total balance of 
the Inter-agency Receivable accounts by the same amount. 

 
10.12 Furthermore, proper review, analysis and reconciliation of the 

aforementioned accounts as required by Section 7.1 of COA Circular No. 
2016-005 dated December 19, 2016 was not conducted allegedly due to the 
lack of sufficient supporting documents. 

 
10.13 This is a reiteration of our Prior Years’ observation wherein courses of 

actions were recommended but remain unimplemented. 
 

10.14 We reiterated our recommendations and Management agreed to 
require the Chief Accountant to:  

 

a. Complete and submit the required documents and information 
pertaining to dormant accounts already requested for write-off 

totaling ₱656,251,328.16, to facilitate the resolution of the case; 

henceforth, monitor the fund transferred to NGAs and demand from 

those agencies with unliquidated balances to submit the necessary 

documents immediately after the completion of each activity, to 

avoid dormancy of the account; and  

 

b. Exert extra effort to identify the details of the “For Reconciliation” 
SLs of the Inter-agency Receivable accounts so that appropriate 

action/actions could be made. 

 

10.15 Management commented that they will submit the required certifications 
together with the Schedule of Dormant Receivables. 

 
 
Long Outstanding and Dormant Receivables–₱387.395 million 
 

11. Receivables from retired/resigned/inactive officials/employees of the 
COMELEC and suppliers amounting to ₱387.395 million and overpayment 

of salaries, excess overtime and other benefits totaling ₱16.225 million remain 

uncollected/outstanding as at August 31, 2020, due to the lax enforcement of 

collections/settlements thereof.  Moreover, disallowances/charges amounting 

to ₱140.792 million remained dormant and unsettled.  

 

11.1 Section 6.1 of COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016 states 
that, all government entities shall conduct regular monitoring and analysis 
of accounts to ensure that these are collected when these become due and 
demandable and that cash advances and fund transfers are liquidated within 
the prescribed period depending upon their nature and purpose. 

 



31 
 

11.2 Section 37 of PD 1445 provides that, when any person is indebted to any 
government agency, the Commission may direct the proper officer to 
withhold the payment of any money due such person or his estate to be 
applied in satisfaction of the indebtedness. 

 
11.3 Moreover, Section 7.1.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-006 states that, the head 

of the agency, who is primarily responsible for all government funds and 
property pertaining to his agency, shall ensure that: a) the required 
financial and other reports and statements are submitted by the concerned 
agency officials in such form and within the period prescribed by the 
Commission; b) the settlement of disallowances and charges is made within 
the prescribed period; c) the requirements of transactions suspended in 
audit are complied with; and d) appropriate actions are taken on the 
deficiencies noted as contained in the AOM. (Underscoring supplied) 

 

11.4 Review of the Schedule of Subsidiary Ledger Balances of the  
Other Receivables account revealed that a total of ₱387,394,805.40 
remained outstanding in the books as at August 31, 2020. Details are shown 
in Table No. 13. 
 

Table No. 13 – Schedule of Outstanding Other Receivables

Total  ₱ 387,394,805.40  

 

11.5 It can be gleaned from the above table that the bulk of the long outstanding 
receivables or 97 percent, pertained to unliquidated cash advances of 
Disbursing Officers (DOs) who are retired, resigned, dismissed and/or 
deceased who failed to settle/liquidate their cash advances prior to their 
retirement/resignation. Some of the DOs were retired as early as 2002 and it 
is worth mentioning that the highest single unsettled accountability is as 
much as ₱48,850,373.32.  

  
11.6 Upon inquiry with the Accountant on the status of outstanding receivables, 

they are still in the process of re-evaluating the accounts of the retired, 
resigned, dismissed and/or deceased DOs with unliquidated cash advances 



32 
 

to clear the account. However, the Accountant claimed of no assurance on 
the collectability of said amount due to the absence of some documents and 
the whereabouts of the DOs could not be traced. 

 
11.7 The lax enforcement of collection/settlement of the above receivables, the 

non-compliance with rules and regulations in the grant, utilization and 
liquidation of cash advances; and likewise, the leniency in processing 
clearance from money and property accountability, which is a basic 
requirement for retirement, resulted in the incurrence of significant balance 
of receivable account from officers/employees no longer in the service. 

 
11.8 In addition, overpayment of salaries, excess overtime and other personnel 

benefits totaling ₱16,224,975.59, recorded under Due from Officers and 
Employees account remain uncollected as at August 31, 2020. Details are as 
follows: 

 
Table No. 14 – List of Uncollected Overpayments 

Particulars  Amount  

OT Excess 2016-2017 ₱13,240,399.51  
Other Bonuses and Allowances        134,685.16  
Other Compensation 1,180.00  
Other Personnel Benefits     2,109,042.72  
Overtime Pay 33,571.09  
Reimbursement 14,270.00  
Petty Cash Fund 11,042.30  
Salaries and Wages 679,612.81  
Subsistence and Laundry Allowance 1,172.00  
Total ₱16,224,975.59  

 

11.9 While we take positive note of the FSD’s exerted efforts to collect the 
above-mentioned receivables by sending demand letters to the individuals 
with overpayments, and put into effect the collection through salary 
deductions, its role to enforce the collection/settlement of long outstanding 
receivables needs to be enhanced. 

 
11.10 The non-collection of the above receivables deprived the government of 

additional fund that could be utilized to finance priority projects.  
 

11.11 Moreover, Receivables–Disallowances/Charges account amounting to 
₱140,792,434.20 remained dormant and outstanding in the books for 13 
years and review, analysis and reconciliation of the account were not 
conducted due to the lack of account details and supporting documents. 
 



33 
 

11.12 It is worthy to mention that the same observations were also raised in the  
CY 2019 AAR wherein courses of actions were recommended but remain 
unimplemented. 

 

11.13 We reiterated our previous recommendations that Management require 
the Finance Services Department to: 

 

a. Enforce collection/settlement of long outstanding receivables from 
the resigned/retired/dismissed officials/employees and suppliers.  

If all efforts have been exerted and settlement thereof is nil, initiate 

the preparation of the request for authority from the Commission on 

Audit to write-off the accounts, pursuant to COA Circular No.  

2016-005 and ensure strict compliance with the guidelines on the 

grant, utilization and liquidation of cash advances; 

 
b. Undertake necessary measures to intensify collection of the 

overpayment of salaries, excess overtime and other personnel 

benefits from the employees concerned; and 
 

c. Exert extra effort to locate and determine the details of the recorded   
Receivables-Disallowances/Charges account and thereafter, enforce 

collection/settlement thereof. 
 

11.14 Management commented that: 
 

a.  The FSD, through AD is currently reviewing the long outstanding 
receivables from individuals who are no longer connected with the 
Commission. Accordingly, the AD, FSD sent a letter dated 4 November 
2020 to the Personnel Department (PeD) requesting assistance of the 
latter to verify the employment status of individuals who have overdue 
accounts. The two departments are working together to facilitate the 
demand for collection of overpayments; 

 
b.  Through the efforts and coordination showed by the FSD and PeD, they 

have been persistent in facilitating the collection of the receivables by 
sending Demand Letters to the concerned individuals with excess 
overtime. In line with this action, ongoing evaluation of the timeline of 
when the demand letters have been sent is being done and the FSD will 
rigorously reiterate collection from those individuals who haven’t taken 
any action yet. Please know that the FSD and PeD are working together 
to resolve and enforce collection and will implement stricter operational 
controls to avoid recurring of overpayments. Rest assured that the 
Management will continue to be determined to expedite the collection of 
overpayments; and 

 



34 
 

c.  There are extreme difficulties and challenges in the extensive 
reconciliation of Receivables - Disallowances/Charges account since the 
balance of this account pertained to historical data and some related 
documents were already submitted to the Resident Auditor for post audit 
and final custody. Thus, the AD will continue to exert its best efforts to 
reconcile the account. 

 
 

Unreliable Inventory Held for Consumption accounts–₱1.909 billion 
 

12. The existence and valuation of the Inventory Held for Consumption accounts 
amounting to ₱1.909 billion as at August 31, 2020 could not be ascertained 

due to: a) significant variance between the Accounting Division (AD) and 

Property Division (PD) records amounting to ₱1.881 billion or 99 percent of 

the total balance; and b) existence of SLs captioned as “For Reconciliation” 

with a total negative net balance of ₱518.962 million.  

 

12.1 As at August 31, 2020, the Inventory Held for Consumption accounts of the 
COMELEC had a book balance of ₱1,908,718,578.60 composed of the 
following: 

 
Table No. 15 – Composition of Inventory Held for Consumption account

Construction Materials Inventory 8,462,084.65 
Other Supplies and Materials Inventory 1,818,250,516.04 
Total ₱  1,908,718,578.60 

 
12.2 Review of the Inventory Held for Consumption accounts revealed the 

following: 
 

a. Significant variance between the Accounting Division (AD) and Property 
Division (PD) records –₱1.881 billion 

 
12.3 Item D of the Instructions of Appendices 57 and 58 of the GAM, Volume II 

prescribes that the agency shall conduct physical count of inventories every 
semester. The semestral physical inventory of supplies shall be reconciled 
with the SLCs and controlling accounts and Supply and/or Property records. 
Any discrepancies shall be immediately verified and adjusted. 

 
12.4 Section 17, Chapter 8 of the GAM, Volume I provides the following records 

and reports prescribed for use: 
 

a. Supplies Ledger Card shall be used to record materials received, issued and 
the balance both in quantity and amount at any time.  It shall be maintained 



35 
 

by the Accounting Division/Unit for each kind of supplies and materials. 
The IAR, RIS, RSMI, PO and DR serve as the original sources of 
information for making entries on the card. 

 
b. Report of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI) shall be prepared by the 

Property and/or Supply Custodian based on the RIS and shall be used by 
the Accounting Division/Unit as basis in preparing the JEV to record the 
supplies and materials issued. 

 
12.5 Comparison of the balances of the Inventory accounts between the AD and 

PD records revealed a significant variance of ₱1,881,232,346.61 or 99 
percent of the total Inventory Held for Consumption accounts. Details are as 
follows: 
 

Table No. 16 – Variance between Accounting Division

Total ₱1,908,718,578.60 ₱ 27,486,231.99  ₱ 1,881,232,346.61  

 
12.6 Based on Table No. 16, Drugs and Medicines Inventory, Medical, Dental 

and Laboratory Supplies Inventory, and Construction Materials Inventory 
have corresponding balances in the AD records, however, the PD records 
showed zero balances. The property personnel claimed that these supplies 
were immediately withdrawn by the requesting offices and are no longer in 
the custody of the Property Supply Officer as observed during the physical 
count of inventories thus, the same were not included in the Report on the 
Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI). 

 

12.7 Further verification disclosed that RSMIs for the issued supplies for the 
2018 Barangay and Sanggunian ng Kabataan Elections and 2019 National 
and Local Elections amounting to ₱225,970,889.37 and ₱1,594,505,507.13, 
respectively, remain unrecorded. The said amount comprised the significant 
balance of the observed variance. Inquiry with the AD personnel revealed 
that the said RSMIs included office supplies which were misclassified as 



36 
 

election supplies. The AD personnel further claimed that the unrecorded 
issuances are currently being reconciled and proper adjustments will be 
recorded once identified. 

 
12.8 It was noted that the variance between the AD and PD records decreased by 

₱6,620,311.71 as at August 31, 2020 or only less than half of one percent of 
the variance of ₱1,887,852,658.32 observed as at December 31, 2019. 

 
12.9 The non-recording of the issuances overstates the Inventory accounts and 

understates the related Expense accounts. 
 

b. SLs captioned as “For Reconciliation” negative net balance – P518.962 
million 

 
12.10 Further examination of the Inventory Held for Consumption accounts 

revealed the existence of SLs captioned as “For Reconciliation” with a 
negative net balance of ₱518,961,677.13 as at August 31, 2020, nature and 
details of which could not be verified. Details are as follows: 
 

Table No. 17 – Schedule of “For Reconciliation” SL  

under Inventory accounts 

Account Name Amount 

Office Supplies Inventory ₱    (26,076,127.20) 
Accountable Forms, Plates and Stickers Inventory (127,764.12) 
Drugs and Medicines Inventory 438,968.56 
Medical, Dental & Laboratory Supplies Inventory 1,289,322.49 
Construction Materials Inventory 4,662,558.08 
Other Supplies and Materials Inventory (499,148,634.94) 
Total ₱  (518,961,677.13) 

 
12.11 Verification of the above accounts disclosed that issuances which cannot be 

identified to the appropriate SLs were charged to the beginning balances 
captioned as “For Reconciliation” even if the balance thereof is not 
sufficient to cover the recorded issuances, resulting in the increase of 
negative SL balance by ₱139,008.53 from the total negative net SL balance 
of ₱518,822,668.60 as at December 31, 2019. 

 
12.12 The significant variance between the AD and PD records and the existence 

of SLs captioned as “For Reconciliation” have been included in the prior 
years’ AAR and Management Letters in lieu of AAR, wherein courses of 
actions were recommended, however as of date, the recommendations 
remain unimplemented.  

 
12.13 We reiterated our previous recommendations that Management 

require:  

 

a. The Chief Accountant and the Property Officer to reconcile their 
records, identify the difference between the Accounting Division

and Property Division records and make the necessary adjustments 

to present the reliable balances of the accounts; 

 

b.  The Chief Accountant to analyze the significant balance of 
Inventory accounts, coordinate with the Property Division for the 

identification of the issued supplies and materials and prepare the 

necessary journal entry voucher to record the same. Likewise, exert 

extra effort to analyze the SLs captioned as “For Reconciliation” 

taking into consideration the details of SLs manually prepared prior 

to the adoption of the eNGAS, and make the necessary adjustments, 

if warranted; and 

 

c.  The Property Officer to ensure that all issuances of inventories are 
reported in the RSMI and submitted to the AD for proper recording 

thereof.  

 
12.14  Management commented that: 

 
a.  The AD held a coordination meeting with the Property Officer and staff 

to determine the difference between the AD and PD balances. The PD 
claimed that they are gathering and consolidating reports of supplies 
directly delivered to the COMELEC field offices for regular operations 
and in connection with the past elections. The AD requested for the 
latest RSMI from the PD to be used for the reconciliation of the said 
variance. The AD also secured a copy of the Statement of Account from 
the DBM-PS which is currently being used in the on-going 
reconciliation of their balances with DBM-PS; and 

 
b.  The AD has already been in constant coordination with the PD on the 

documents needed for reconciliation.   
 

 
Doubtful Semi-Expendable Machinery and Equipment and Semi-Expendable Furniture, 
Fixtures and Books accounts 

 
13. The existence and valuation of Semi-Expendable Machinery and Equipment 

and Semi-Expendable Furniture, Fixtures and Books accounts amounting to 
₱126.188 million and ₱52.044 million, respectively, as at August 31, 2020, 

could not be ascertained due to: a) the absence of inventory taking of the 

Semi-Expendable accounts; b) unrecorded prior years’ issuances amounting 

to ₱85.751 million, resulting in the overstatement of the Inventory and 

Accumulated Surplus/Deficit accounts by the same amount; and c) existence 

of SLs captioned as “Various Semi-Expendable” amounting to ₱37.437 

million, without details; hence, the accuracy of the Semi-Expendable accounts 

remained doubtful. 

 



38 
 

13.1 Verification of the accounts disclosed the following:  
 

a.  Absence of physical count 
 

13.2 Section 13, Chapter 8 of the GAM, Volume I provides that the physical 
count/inventory, which is required semi-annually, is an indispensable 
procedure for checking the integrity of property custodianships. 

 
13.3 Item I, Section 17, Chapter 8 of the same Manual further states that the 

Report on the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) (Appendix 66) – shall be 
used to report the physical count of supplies by type of inventory as at a 
given date. It shows the balance of inventory items per card and per count 
and shortage/overage, if any. These include the semi-expendable property 
wherein the issue is covered by ICS. 

 
13.4 The Administrative Services Department conducted the physical count of 

inventory on January 25, 2021. It was however observed that Management 
did not include in its physical count the semi-expendable properties, 
contrary to the above-mentioned provisions of the GAM. Moreover, 
verification of the submitted RPCI disclosed that only Inventory Held for 
Consumption accounts was included in the report. 

 
13.5 Due to the exclusion in the RPCI and non-reconciliation thereof with the 

book balances, existence and accuracy of the recorded Semi-Expendable 
accounts cannot be assured. 

 
b. Unrecorded issuances of semi-expendable properties - ₱85.751 million 

 
13.6 Section 10, Chapter 8 of the GAM, Volume I provides that tangible items 

below the capitalization threshold of ₱15,000.00 shall be accounted as semi-
expendable property. The following policies apply as follows:  

 
a.  Semi-expendable property which are recognized as PPE shall be 

reclassified to the appropriate accounts. 
 

b.  These tangible items shall be recognized as expenses upon issue to the 
end-user. 

 
13.7 As at August 31, 2020, the balance of the Semi-Expendable Machinery and 

Equipment and Semi-Expendable Furniture, Fixtures and Books accounts 
amounted to ₱126,187,639.27 and ₱52,043,567.26, respectively. 

 
13.8 Verification however disclosed that issuances pertaining to prior years for  

Semi-Expendable Machinery and Equipment and Semi-Expendable 
Furniture, Fixtures and Books accounts amounting to ₱55,547,294.20 and 



39 
 

₱30,204,107.26, respectively, remain unrecorded to date. Details are broken 
down in Table No. 18.

Total ₱85,751,401.46 
 

13.9 The above inventory items were included in the observations embodied in 
the CY 2017 ML in lieu of the AAR, as capitalized semi-expendable 
properties. As recommended, the AD reclassified the said inventory items to 
their respective Semi-Expendable accounts under Journal Entry Voucher 
(JEV) Nos. 2018-06-037536 and 2018-08-047096 amounting to 
₱2,529,887.64 and ₱83,221,513.82, respectively, however, issuances thereof 
were not recognized as of date thus, corresponding expense accounts related 
thereto were not taken up in the books. 

 
13.10 The same observation was raised in the CY 2019 AAR but unrecorded 

issuances remained at ₱85,751,401.46. The non-recording of the said 
issuances resulted in the overstatement of the Inventory and Accumulated 
Surplus/Deficit accounts both by the same amount. 

 
c. Various Semi-Expendable account without details – ₱37.437 million 

 
13.11 Further review revealed the existence of SLs captioned as “Various Semi-

Expendable” without any description or details totaling ₱37,436,835.45 or 
21 percent of the total balance of the account amounting to 
₱178,231,206.53. Details are shown in Table No. 19.

13.12 The existence of various semi-expendable accounts without description or 

details cast doubt on the reliability and accuracy of the account balance.  
This observation was also raised in the CY 2019 AAR wherein the balance 
of “Various Semi-Expendable” accounts remained at ₱37,436,835.45 and 
courses of actions were recommended but remain unimplemented. 

 
13.13 We recommended that Management require the Property Division to 

conduct a complete physical count of inventory, to include  

Semi-Expendable accounts, in accordance with the provisions of Item I, 

Section 17, Chapter 8 of the GAM, Volume I. 

 

13.14 We further reiterated our previous recommendations that 
Management: 

 

a. Direct the Property Division to prepare and submit the Inventory 
Custodian Slip to the Accounting Division for immediate recording of 

the issued Semi-Expendable properties, as provided for under the 

provisions of Section 10, Chapter 8 of the GAM, Volume I, to come 

up with a more realistic balance of the Inventory accounts; 

 

b. Require the Accounting Division to closely coordinate with the 
Property Division for the reconciliation of their respective records 

and to prepare the necessary adjusting entry, if warranted; and 

 

c. Require the Accounting Division to exert extra effort to determine 
the details of the SLs captioned as “Various Semi-Expendable”, to 

facilitate proper classification thereof. 

 
13.15 Management commented that: 

 
a. The AD will continue to coordinate with the PD for the submission of the 

Inventory Custodian Slip (ICS) and for the reconciliation of their records 
with the books of accounts of the Commission, particularly for the  



41 
 

Semi-Expendable Machinery and Equipment and Semi-Expendable 
Furniture, Fixtures and Books; and 

 
b. The AD will continue to exert its best efforts to review the details of the 

SLs captioned as “Various Semi-Expendable” and adjustments will be 
made in the books of accounts once the proper classification of said items 
was determined. 

 
 

Significant amount of Unliquidated Cash Advances - ₱2.594 billion 
 

14. The reliability of the balance of the Advances account as at August 31, 2020 
totaling ₱2.685 billion could not be ascertained due to: a) cash advances 

totaling ₱2.594 billion remain unliquidated even if the purposes have been 

served; b) inclusion of negative sub-SL balances totaling ₱260.604 million, 

which decreased the total balance of the account; c) existence of SLs 

captioned as “For Reconciliation” with total negative balance of ₱72.759 

million, their nature and details could not be traced; and d) significant 

variance of P3.649 billion between the GL balance and the corresponding 

Schedule of Receivables of Advances to Special Disbursing Officers (SDO). 

 
14.1 Section 89 of PD 1445 states that, no cash advance shall be given unless for 

a legally authorized specific purpose. A cash advance shall be reported on 
and liquidated as soon as the purpose for which it was given has been 
served. No additional cash advance shall be allowed to any official or 
employee unless the previous cash advance given to him is first settled or a 
proper accounting thereof is made. 

 
14.2 Section 4.1.2 of COA Circular No. 97-002 provides that no additional cash 

advance shall be allowed to any official or employee unless the previous 
cash advance given to him is first settled or a proper accounting thereof is 
made. 

 
14.3 Moreover, Section 5.3 of the same circular provides that within 10 days after 

receipt of the report and supporting documents from the AO, the Accountant 
shall verify the report, record it in the books and submit the same with all 
the vouchers/payrolls and supporting documents to the Auditor. The cash 
advance shall be considered liquidated upon the recording thereof by the 
Accountant in the books of accounts although not yet audited by the COA 
auditor. 

 
14.4 As at August 31, 2020, the Advances accounts had a significant balance of 

₱2,685,120,485.46, net, broken down in Table No. 20.

14.5 Verification of the accounts disclosed the following: 

 
a. Cash advances remain unliquidated - ₱2.594 billion 

 
14.6 It was noted in the SLs and Schedule of Receivable Accounts for Advances 

generated from the e-NGAS that various cash advances with total amount of

14.7 The purpose for which the above cash advances were granted have already 

been served, however, the same remain unliquidated as at August 31, 2020, 
contrary to the above cited regulations. 

 
14.8 In addition, the Status Report on Unliquidated Cash Advances submitted by 

the Accounting Division disclosed that multiple cash advances were granted 
to AOs as early as 1992 to 2019 even if previous cash advances were not yet 
liquidated, which is not in conformity with the above regulations, hence, the 
accumulation of significant amount of unliquidated cash advances. 

 
b. Inclusion of negative sub-SL balances – ₱260.604 million 

 
14.9 The SLs of the Advances accounts disclosed the inclusion of sub-SL 

accounts of 155 AOs with negative balances totaling ₱260,604,317.71, 
broken down as follows:

Total 155 ₱ (260,604,317.71) 

 
14.10 The CY 2016 ending balances were not forwarded as beginning balances 

during the adoption of the eNGAS in January 2017; hence, the negative 
balances.  These negative balances resulted in the significant decrease of the 
actual balance of the accounts, which further cast doubt on the reliability of 
the Advances account. 

 
c. Existence of SL accounts captioned as “For Reconciliation” with negative 

balance – ₱72.759 million, net 
 

14.11 Further analysis of the Advances account disclosed the existence of various 
SL accounts captioned as “For Reconciliation” with a total net negative 
balance of ₱72,758,850.59, nature and details of which could not be traced. 
Details are shown below:

14.12 The absence of breakdown or details of the above accounts precluded the 

Audit Team from verifying the account, thus, the accuracy and reliability of 
the account balance remained doubtful. 

 
14.13 It was noted that the “For Reconciliation” account balances had very 

minimal decrease of ₱119,000.00, not even half of a percent of its previous 
balance as at December 31, 2019 of ₱72,877,850.59, net; hence,  
no extensive reconciliation of the said accounts was made.  

 
 



45 
 

d. Significant variance between the GL balance and the corresponding 
Schedule of Receivables of Advances to SDO – ₱3.649 billion 

 
14.14 The Audit Team noted that the GL balance of the Advances to SDO account 

as at August 31, 2020 amounting to ₱2,506,946,620.26 does not tally with 
the balance of its corresponding Schedule of Receivables with a negative 
balance of ₱1,141,720,980.15, or a significant variance of 
₱3,648,667,600.41. 

 
14.15 In an inquiry made, the AD claimed that the significant variance was due to 

technical error in the enhanced eNGAS which had been a concern for 
several years. The AD further claimed that they will seek assistance from the 
COA-Accounting Systems Development and Other Services Office 
(ASDOSO) to resolve the matter. 
 

14.16 Inquiry with the COA-ASDOSO, the office responsible for the maintenance 
and development of enhanced eNGAS informed that they previously 
requested the Accounting Division for a copy of their database including the 
compilation of all issues and concerns regarding the eNGAS, however, the 
same were submitted only on April 30, 2021, upon constant follow-up of the 
Audit Team.  

 
14.17 The COA-ASDOSO further informed of a request to AD on some 

clarifications and additional requirements on their issues and concerns 
through an e-mail dated May 4, 2021, however, as of this writing, the same 
were not yet submitted. 

 
14.18 Had the AD immediately communicated/elevated their issues and concerns 

regarding the eNGAS with COA-ASDOSO and provided the required 
database and the necessary details/reports, the issues raised could have been 
long resolved, hence, noted discrepancies between the GL balance of the 
Advances to SDO account and the related schedule of receivables could 
have been likewise resolved.  

 
14.19 The existence of significant cash advances that remain unliquidated, 

inclusion of negative sub-SL balances and existence of SL accounts 
captioned as “For Reconciliation” had been raised in the CYs 2015 and 2019 
AAR and CYs 2017 and 2018 ML on the audit of the COMELEC, wherein 
courses of actions were recommended, however, the same remain 
unimplemented to date. 

 
14.20 We reiterated our previous recommendations that Management require 

the Finance Services Department to: 

 
a. Demand from the concerned AOs the immediate liquidation of their 

outstanding cash advances which were already overdue; and cease 



46 
 

from granting additional cash advances to AOs with unliquidated 

cash advances; and 

 

b. Extensively review and analyze the negative sub-SL balances and SLs 
captioned as “For Reconciliation” accounts so that proper adjustment 

thereto could be made, to come up with a more reliable balance of the 

account. 

 

14.21 We further recommended that Management: 
 

a. Direct the Accountant to submit “Certification” that previous cash 
advances have been liquidated and accounted for in the books before 

granting any cash advances to AOs, pursuant to Item 1.1 of COA 

Circular No. 2012-001; and 

 

b. Require the AD to immediately provide the necessary details/reports 
required by the COA-ASDOSO in order to resolve the issues/concern 

in the use of eNGAS including the variance between the GL and 

Schedule of Receivable of the Advances to SDO account. Consider to 

immediately communicate with COA-ASDOSO any issues/errors 

encountered in the use of the system.  

 

14.22 Management commented that: 
 

a. In December 2020, the FSD already sent demand letters (DLs) to various 
Accountable Officers who have not yet liquidated their cash advances.  
As of August 2021, the amount of Advances accounts had already 
decreased by almost 30 percent from its book balance in December 2019. 
A total reduction in the amount of P1,143,697,041.33 has been recorded in 
the books of accounts since January 2020. Continuous validation and 
recording of the liquidation reports (LRs) received is also on-going. As of 
this writing, a total of 7,260 LRs are already submitted to the FSD. Rest 
assured that we will always exert our best efforts to fast track the process 
of reviewing the LRs submitted to validate if they are compliant with the 
accounting and auditing standards, rules and regulations prior to recording 
in the books of accounts; 

 

b. The negative sub-SL balances are being analyzed and will be adjusted if 
the supporting documents are readily available; and 

 

c. The FSD will immediately submit the required database and the necessary 
details and reports needed by the Accounting Systems Development and 
Other Services Office (ASDOSO) of COA to fix the discrepancies 
between the GL balance of the account Advances to SDO and the 
schedule of receivables.

Unreliable and Dormant Prepayments account - ₱11.249 million 
 
15. The reliability of the balance of the Prepayments account as at August 31, 

2020 amounting to ₱11.249 million could not be ascertained due to:  

a) existence of dormant balances with SLs captioned as “For Reconciliation”, 

their nature and details could not be verified, amounting to ₱10.771 million 

or 96 percent of total account balance; b) unrecorded amortizations of 

various Prepayments account totaling to ₱439,987.29; and c) unreconciled 

GL and SL balances of Prepaid Insurance and Prepaid Registration accounts 

thus, ultimately affecting the fair presentation of the account in the Financial 

Statements. 

 
15.1 The balance of the Prepayments account of the COMELEC as at August 31, 

2020 amounted to ₱11,248,854.18, broken down as follows: 
 

Table No. 24 – Composition of Prepayments account 

Account Amount 

Advances to Contractors ₱7,381,002.61 
Prepaid Rent 2,103,331.25 
Prepaid Insurance  192,045.57 
Prepaid Registration 36,024.90 
Other Prepayments 1,536,449.85 
Total ₱11,248,854.18 

 
15.2 Verification of the account disclosed the following: 

 
a. Existence of dormant balances with SLs captioned as  

“For Reconciliation” – ₱10.771 million 
 

15.3 It was noted that prepayments aggregating to ₱10,770,832.21 or 96 percent 
of the total balance of Prepayments account remained dormant for 13 years 
or more. The information on the number of years that it remained dormant 
was based on the most precedent financial statements available and data 
obtained from the eNGAS.  It was also noted that SLs were prepared only 
for those transactions beginning CY 2017 as required under the eNGAS 
thus, balances for CY 2016 were not supported with schedules and recorded 
only as SLs captioned as “For Reconciliation”, making it difficult to verify 
the accounts. Details are as follows: 

 
Table No. 25 – Dormant Prepayments account 

Account Amount No. of Years Dormant 

Advances to Contractors ₱ 7,381,002.61 18 
Prepaid Rent 1,672,000.00 13 
Prepaid Insurance  181,379.75 13 
Other Prepayments 1,536,449.85 18 
Total ₱10,770,832.21  

 



48 
 

15.4 The decrease in the Prepaid Rent account pertained to the recorded 
expired/lapsed portion for the period November to December 2016 and an 
adjustment made due to incorrect recognition of Prepayment totaling to 
₱758,820.47.  

 
15.5 Considering the nature of the above accounts and length of time that these 

have been recorded in the books, the related projects pertaining to Advances 
to Contractors may have been completed and now being used and the 
balances of Prepaid Rent, Prepaid Insurance and Other Prepayments could 
have already been expired/lapsed and the expenses related thereto have not 
been recognized during the proper period to which they relate. 

 
b. Unrecorded amortization of various Prepayments accounts - ₱0.440 

million 
 

15.6 Section 53.a, Chapter 19 of the GAM, Volume I provides that Prepayments 
are expenses paid before they are incurred. At the end of the accounting 
period, the expired portion shall be determined and an adjusting journal 
entry shall be prepared to recognize the expense applicable to the period 
being reported. 

 
15.7 Section 6, Chapter 2 of the same Manual provides the Basic Government 

Accounting and Budget Reporting Principles. It states, among others, that 
each entity shall recognize and present its financial transactions and 
operations conformably using the accrual basis of accounting in accordance 
with the IPSAS. 

 
15.8 The accrual basis of accounting states that expenses should be recognized 

when it occurs regardless of the time of payment. Hence, prepayments 
should be recognized as an asset and realized as an expense over the 
accounting period, a schedule of which must be prepared for monitoring of 
the account and necessary adjusting entries should be made. 

 
15.9 Further noted is the existence of the expired/lapsed portion of the account 

totaling to ₱439,987.29 which remain unrecorded as of date. Details per 
account are as follows: 

 
Table No. 26 – Unrecorded Expired/Lapsed portion of Prepayments

Prepaid Insurance 4,918.21 3,800.41 1,117.80 
Total ₱   471,669.46 ₱   31,682.17 ₱  439,987.29 

 



49 
 

15.10 It was confirmed by the AD that there are unrecorded amortization as of 
date, which resulted in the overstatement of the related Prepayment accounts 
and understatement of the corresponding Expense accounts. 

 
c. Unreconciled GL and SL balances of Prepaid Insurance and Prepaid 

Registration 
 

15.11 The GL and SL balances of the Prepaid Insurance and Prepaid Registration 
accounts were unreconciled with discrepancies amounting to ₱3,800.41 and 
₱27,881.76, respectively, as shown below: 

 
Table No. 27 – Variance between GL and SL balances  

of Prepayments account 

  Account  GL Balance SL Balance Variance 

Prepaid Insurance ₱ 192,045.57 ₱ 195,845.98 ₱   3,800.41 
Prepaid Registration 36,024.90 63,906.66 27,881.76 
Total   ₱ 31,682.17 

 
15.12 It was noted that amortization recorded in the GL were not posted 

simultaneously in the respective SL accounts; hence, the variance. 
 

15.13 The existence of dormant balances for 13 years or more, SL balances 
without details, unrecorded amortization and the lack of proper analysis, 
review and reconciliation of the account cast doubt on the reliability of the 
account balance. 

 
15.14 It is noteworthy to mention that the said observation had been included in 

the CY 2016 ML in lieu of AAR and CY 2019 AAR wherein courses of 
actions were recommended, however, as of date, the same remain 
unimplemented. 

 
15.15 We reiterated our recommendations that Management require the 

Accounting Division to: 

 

a.  Extensively review, analyze and reconcile the Prepayments account 
to identify the details of the SLs “For Reconciliation” and if 

warranted, effect proper adjustments in order to present the 

reliable balances of the accounts; 

 

b.   Ensure that schedules of Prepayments account are prepared and 
the expiration/lapsing thereof are monitored such that expenses 

pertaining thereto are properly recorded at the period to which 

they relate; and 

 

c.  Request for authority to write-off dormant accounts from the 
Commission on Audit, following the guidelines provided under 

COA Circular No. 97-001. 



50 
 

15.16 We further recommended that Management require the Accounting 
Division to record the expired/lapsed portion of the Prepayment 

accounts. Consider maintaining a proper monitoring tool to ensure that 

amortizations are regularly, timely and simultaneously recorded in the 

GL and SLs. 

 

15.17 Management commented that: 
 
a. The AD will continue to exert its best effort in prioritizing the analysis 

and reconciliation of these balances and if warranted, effect proper 
adjustments in order to present the reliable balances of the accounts; 

 
b. The AD will send a letter to COA-ASDOSO requesting for their 

assistance to resolve and address all the technical issues and concerns with 
eNGAS; 

 
c. All the dormant accounts noted are still being analyzed to this date as the 

records involved pertained to historical data of which supporting 
documents are not readily available to retrieve. If all else fails, and the 
settlement of these accounts would still be nil, authority to write-off will 
be immediately requested; and 

 
d. The copies of DV, Contracts and all other necessary supporting 

documents will be requested and retrieved. These will be used in the 
extensive review and analysis of the account to properly record the 
expired/lapsed portion of the same in the books of accounts. The AD in 
coordination with COA-ASDOSO will prioritize the resolutions of the 
said encountered problems with the system. The AD will also seek for 
alternative ways such as the preparation of a manual entry in the system 
once allowed by the COA-ASDOSO to facilitate the recording of the 
expired/lapsed portion of the prepayment accounts. Immediate recording 
will be made once the technical issues and concerns related to eNGAS are 
resolved. 

 
 

Unreliable balance of Deposit on Letters of Credit account - ₱4.919 billion 
 
16. The accuracy and reliability of the balance of the Deposit on Letters of Credit 

in the total amount of ₱4.919 billion or 26 percent of the total Current Assets, 

could not be ascertained due to: a) unrecorded drawdowns/utilization 

amounting to ₱4.611 billion; and b) continuous existence of  

“For Reconciliation” SL accounts without supporting schedules amounting to 

₱307.966 million. 

 

16.1 Section 5.2 of Treasury Circular No. 3-2019 dated May 10, 2019 further 
provides that “Concerned NGAs shall be required to review their 



51 
 

outstanding LCs and revert any balances for those LC already fully 
delivered, those without movement or activities that are no longer valid.” 

 

16.2 GAM Volume III prescribing the Revised Chart of Accounts provides that 
the Deposit on Letters of Credit is used to recognize the amount paid by the 
agency to the bank for the opening of letters of credit which is credited for 
delivery of goods purchased.   

 
16.3 Irrevocable domestic Letters of Credit (LC) is a document from an issuing 

bank that guarantees payment to a seller on which required necessary 
documents listed on the face of LC shall be completed and presented in 
order that the payment will be released. 

 
16.4 As at August 31, 2020, the Deposit on Letters of Credit account amounted to 

₱4,918,573,503.07 or 26 percent of the Total Current Assets.  
 

16.5 Verification of the account disclosed the following: 
 

a. Unrecorded drawdowns/utilizations – ₱4.611 billion 
 

16.6 The Schedule of SLs of Deposit on LC account disclosed that 
₱4,610,607,655.01 or 94 percent of the total balance of the account 
pertained to LCs opened in CY 2018 and prior years, broken down as 
follows: 

 
Table No.  28 – Schedule of LCs CY 2018 and PYs 

SL Code Description Amount 

19903010-00-001 LBP FO (SMMT-TIM 2016, INC.) ₱     277,142,460.34 
19903010-00-002 LBP IFO (SMMT-TIM 2016, INC.) 4,333,465,914.67 
Total ₱  4,610,607,655.01 

 
16.7 It could be gleaned from Table No. 28 that the AD managed to identify LCs 

which pertained to the opening of Irrevocable LCs in connection with the 
2016 Automated National, Local and ARMM Elections, in favor of SMMT-
TIM, 2016, Inc., as per reclassification entry made under JEV No. 2020-02-
022423 dated February 1, 2020 amounting to ₱4,333,465,194.67 thus, 
decreased the balance of the “For Reconciliation” SL account by the same 
amount.  

 
16.8 Considering the nature of the above Deposit on LCs account, projects and 

procurements pertaining to the deposits made in prior years may have 
already been completed or delivered; however, drawdown/utilizations still 
remained to be unrecorded in the books, that overstated the Deposit on LC 
account and understated the appropriate Expense/Inventory/PPE accounts. 

 
16.9 The deposits, drawdown/utilization and balances of projects/procurements 

undertaken by the COMELEC and paid through the opening of LCs were 



52 
 

not properly monitored due to the   non-preparation/non-maintenance of   
detailed schedules of the Deposit on LCs account. 

 
b. Continued existence of accounts without supporting schedules – ₱307.966 

million 
 

16.10 The SL captioned as “For Reconciliation” had a remaining balance of 
₱307,965,848.06 after the reclassification entry made last February 1, 2020, 
as mentioned above. It was noted that the said SL pertained to the beginning 
balances carried forward/set up during the roll out of eNGAS on January 1, 
2017, with the intention to analyze and reclassify/reconcile/adjust the same 
to its proper account, however, the same remain unreclassified/ 
unreconciled/unadjusted as of date.  

 
16.11 The Audit Team requested for the detailed breakdown of the Irrevocable 

LCs opened with the LBP and the corresponding drawdowns thereof, 
however, the same remain unsubmitted to date. 

 
16.12 The non-recording of drawdowns/utilization of LCs in prior years and the 

continued existence of accounts without supporting schedules had been 
included in the AAR on the audit of the COMELEC for CY 2019, for which 
Management commented that a team will be created to review and analyze 
the balance of the account and shall ensure the provision and maintenance of 
the updated SLs to properly monitor the transactions for the said accounts. 
However, to date, the balance remains unadjusted. 

 
16.13 We recommended that Management direct the Accounting Division to 

extensively review and analyze the identified LCs and locate the 

documents pertaining to the drawdowns/utilizations thereof for the 

immediate recording in the books, to reflect the correct balance of the 

account. 

 

16.14 We further reiterated our recommendations that Management require 
the Accounting Division to:  

 

a. Extensively review and analyze the substantial balance of the Deposit 
on Letters of Credit account and identify the details of the  

“For Reconciliation” SL. Thereafter, closely coordinate with the 

concerned offices for the documents of deliveries pertaining to the 

identified LCs and effect proper recording thereof, to come up with a 

reliable account balance; and 

 

b. Prepare and maintain a monitoring record of all LCs opened 
including the drawdowns/utilization/completion thereof such that 

expenses/deliveries pertaining thereto are appropriately recorded. 

 



53 
 

16.15 Management commented that: 
 

a. There had been difficulties and challenges in the reconciliation of the 
balance of Deposit on Letters of Credit (LC) account since some 
transactions pertained to the beginning balances carried forward/set up 
during the roll out of the enhanced eNGAS on 01 January 2017. 
Moreover, supporting documents related thereto are no longer available 
due to its submission to the Resident Auditor for post audit and final 
custody; 

 
b. Nonetheless, the AD showed its constant determination to facilitate the 

reconciliation. To expedite the reconciliation of the account, the AD 
already made a request for relevant documents from the LBP which was 
also reiterated. The AD will also coordinate with the concerned offices 
for the documents of deliveries pertaining to the identified LCs. The 
books of accounts will be adjusted immediately as soon as pertinent 
supporting documents are gathered; and 

 
c. The AD had already prepared schedules, based on existing records and 

relevant documents of LCs opened including drawdown's/utilization/ 
completion. Nevertheless, other relevant documents are being gathered to 
further support the schedules. 

 
 
Unreliable balances of Property, Plant and Equipment accounts – ₱9.993 billion 
 
17. The reported balance of Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) accounts in 

the total amount of ₱9.993 billion as at August 31, 2020 were unreliable due 

to: a) unrecorded PPE items totaling ₱43.897 million; b) recorded PPEs 

without property numbers in the eNGAS amounting to ₱1.157 billion;  

and c) existence of SLs captioned as “For Reconciliation” amounting to 

₱5.352 billion.   

 

17.1 As at August 31, 2020, the balances of PPE accounts totaling 
₱9,992,968,128.41 are broken down as follows:

Other PPE 490,355,246.85  
Total ₱9,992,968,128.41 

 
17.2 Verification and analysis of PPE accounts revealed the following: 

 
a. Unrecorded PPE Items - ₱43.897 million 

 
17.3 Review of the submitted Notice of Delivery disclosed that various office 

equipment, information and communications technology equipment and 
furniture and fixtures acquired by the COMELEC in the total amount of 
₱43,896,956.92 were not recorded in the books of accounts as at August 31, 
2020, presented hereto as Annex A. 
 

17.4 The non-recording of the said deliveries resulted in the understatement of 
the related PPE accounts. 

 
b. Recorded property items without property number – ₱1.157 billion 

 
17.5 Section 42, Chapter 10 of the GAM, Volume I provides the use of ledger 

cards for each category of PPE. The PPELC shall be kept to record promptly 
the acquisition, description, custody, estimated useful life, depreciation, 
impairment loss, disposal and other information about the asset. The PPELC 
supports the entries in the Subsidiary and General Ledgers. The balance per 
Property Cards of the Property Division shall be reconciled with the PPELC 
maintained by the AD.  

 
17.6 For check and balance, the Property and Supply Office/Unit shall likewise 

maintain PC for PPE in their custody to account for the receipt and 
disposition of the same. The balance per PC shall be reconciled with PPELC 
maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit. They shall also be reconciled 
with other property records like PAR. 
 

17.7 Appendix 62 of the GAM, Volume II provides that the Inspection and 
Acceptance Report should include “Stock/Property No.” as provided by the 
Supply and/or Property Division/Unit. 

 
17.8 The Schedule of SL balances of PPE showed 24,244 units at 

₱1,157,364,823.86 or 11.58 percent of the total PPE were recorded without 
property numbers, rendering it difficult to reconcile the Accounting and 
Property records. Details are as follows:

Total 24,244 ₱ 1,157,364,823.86  

 
17.9 Inquiry with the AD revealed that they continue to assign a temporary 

property number to avoid delay in the recording of the PPEs in the books. It 
was noted that the IAR forwarded by the Property Division to the AD which 
serves as the supporting document to record the delivered/inspected PPE 
does not contain the property number, hence, not conforming with the 
prescribed format under Appendix 62 of the GAM, Volume II; hence, 
rendering the reconciliation with the property records more tedious.   

 
17.10 It was also noted that some PPEs without property numbers are significant 

in amount and details of which were likewise not provided in the schedule. 
 

17.11 The AD informed that it is in the process of reconciling the recorded PPE 
items without property numbers, with the records maintained by the 
Property Division for assignment of permanent property number in the 
eNGAS. 

 
c. Existence of SLs captioned as “For Reconciliation” – ₱5.352 billion 

 
17.12 It was noted that amount of ₱5,352,409,756.49, which represents 53.56 

percent of the total PPE account balance pertained to SLs captioned as  
“For Reconciliation”. Details are shown in Table No. 31.

17.13 The “For Reconciliation” SLs pertained to balances of 2016 and prior years 

that were carried forward as beginning balances in 2017 during the adoption 
of the eNGAS, without supporting schedules; hence, their nature and details 
could not be verified.  

 
17.14 The unrecorded PPE items, PPEs without property numbers, and the 

existence of SLs captioned as “For Reconciliation” cast doubt on the 
reliability and accuracy of PPE accounts.  Some of the observations were 
also raised in the CY 2019 AAR wherein courses of actions were 
recommended but remain unimplemented.  

 
17.15 We recommended that Management direct the Accounting Division to 

immediately record the cost of PPE items already delivered as at August 

31, 2020, in order to present the correct balance of the related PPE 

accounts and ensure that assets are immediately recorded in the books 

upon delivery and inspection. 

 

17.16 We further reiterated our previous recommendations that 
Management: 

 

a. Require the Accounting Division and Property Division to reconcile 
their respective records, prepare the IAR with the assigned 

permanent property numbers, in compliance with the format 

prescribed under Appendix 6 of the GAM, Volume II; and 

 

b. Direct the Accounting Division to exert extra effort to analyze and 
determine the nature and details of the “For Reconciliation” SLs and 



57 
 

make the necessary reclassification and/or adjustment/s, if 

warranted, to come up with a more realistic balance of the account.  

 

17.17 Management commented that: 
 

a. The AD is in constant coordination with the Equipment Section of the 
Property Division, on the matter. The unit costs of the Vote Counting 
Machines (VCMs) will be double checked since the unit costs indicated 
in the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment 
(RPCPPE) may differ from the costs as reflected in the records of the 
AD; and 

 
b. The AD will continue to exert its best efforts to analyze and determine 

the nature and details of the “For Reconciliation” SLs and make the 
necessary reclassification and/or adjustment/s, if warranted, to come up 
with a more realistic account balance. 

 
 
PPE in various Field Offices 
 
18. The existence, completeness and accuracy/correctness of the Property, Plant 

and Equipment (PPE) included in the Report on the Physical Count of 

Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) in various field offices in Regions 

IV-B, VIII, IX, X, XI and XVI, could not be easily determined/validated due 

to the following: a) the report submitted was not properly presented and 

completely accomplished; b) inclusion of items below the capitalization 

threshold of ₱15,000.00 which are considered as Semi-Expendable 

Properties; and c) non-maintenance of Property Cards (PC) by the Acting 

Property Officer. 

 

18.1 Appendix 73, of the GAM, Volume II defines Report on the Physical Count 
of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) as the form used to report on 
the physical count of PPE by type which are owned by the agency and shall 
be prepared yearly by fund cluster. It also presented the prescribed format of 
the report which includes among others, information on the type of PPE, 
property number, unit cost or value of article or property at hand, quantity 
per property card and quantity per physical count. 

 
18.2 Item (e) of Section 3, Chapter 10 of the GAM, Volume I provides the 

criteria for an item to be considered as PPE, that it must meet the 
capitalization threshold of P15,000.00. 

 
18.3 Moreover, Section 10, Chapter 8 of the same Manual defines that tangible 

item below the capitalization threshold of ₱15,000.00 shall be accounted as 
Semi-Expendable Property.  

 



58 
 

18.4 Item A, Section 4, Chapter 10 of the same Manual further states that items 
with individual values below the threshold but which work together in the 
form of a group of network asset whose total value exceeds the threshold 
shall be recognized as part of the primary PPE (e.g.: computer network, 
PABX system, sewerage system.) 

 
18.5 Verification of PPE in the field offices revealed the following deficiencies: 

 
Table No. 32 – Deficiencies noted under PPE  

Regions Remarks 

IV-B PPE totaling to ₱21,671,506.42 cannot be ascertained due to the 
following: a) the reports submitted were not properly presented and 
completely accomplished; and b) total PPE was overstated by 
₱5,050,781.73 due to inclusion of Semi-Expandable Properties and 
Software Licenses that should be recognized as Intangible Assets 

VIII a) use of an Inventory Custodian Slip of issued property amounting 
₱34,400; b) issued PPEs totaling ₱220,962.18 have no Property 
Acknowledgement Receipts; c) PPEs amounting ₱39,085.00 have no 
property numbers; and d) PARs of various PPEs were not renewed every 3 
years. 

 IX Non-observance of the guidelines in the conduct of Physical Count of all 
PPEs specifically preparation of Property Inventory Plan, use of Inventory 
Count Form and the preparation of the List of PPEs Found in Station and 
List of Missing PPEs. 

 X The non-reconciliation of the unidentified items in the inventory of PPE 
for more than 10 years.   

XI Various reports prepared by the AO of Mati, Davao Oriental, pertaining to 
Property, Plant and Equipment were not properly accomplished. 

XVI Semi-expendable equipment costing below ₱15,000.00 per unit were 
issued with Property Acknowledgment Receipt (PAR) instead of an 
Inventory Custodian Slip (ICS). 

 
18.6 We recommended that the Regional Election Directors (REDs) require 

the Property Officer to: 

 

a. Properly account and classify all PPE in the custody of the Agency 
and present the RPCPPE per category; 

 

b. Accomplish the RPCPPE with complete information by indicating 
the following details such as property number, unit cost/fair value, 

quantity per property card and physical count of all PPE items as 

prescribed under the above regulations; and 

 

c. Cancel the issued PAR of the Semi-Expendable Properties and its 
place, issue an ICS to establish accountability and for proper 

monitoring thereof. 

 
18.7 Management commented that the PD will coordinate with the REDs 

concerned and assist the Acting Property Officer on how to properly account 
and classify all PPE in the custody of the Agency and present the RPCPPE 



59 
 

per category. The PD will also assist them on how to properly accomplish 
the RPCPPE with complete information by indicating the following details 
such as property number, unit cost/fair value, quantity per property card and 
physical count of all PPE items. 
 

 
Undisposed Unserviceable Properties 
 
19. Unserviceable PPE from COMELEC field offices in Regions V, IX, XII, XIII 

and XVI, remain undisposed, resulting in further deterioration of the assets 

and deprived the Agency of possible income from sale, not to mention the 

optimum utilization of the space occupied by said properties. 

 
19.1 Item A of Part I of the Manual on Disposal of Government Property 

embodied under NBC No. 425 dated January 28, 1992 provides, among 
others that: “xxx Disposal proceedings should be immediately initiated to 
avoid further deterioration of the property and consequent depreciation in its 
value.  A systematic and timely disposal will yield benefits in terms of, 
among others, a higher appraised value and by enabling storage areas 
available for other purposes.” 

 
19.2 Likewise, COMELEC MR No. 08-0819 dated August 5, 2008 reads, “(1) In 

case there shall be a disposal of properties in the regional, provincial, 
city/municipal offices, the head of COMELEC field office i.e. Regional 
Election Director (RED), the Provincial Election Supervisor (PES), or the 
City/Municipal Election Officer, as the case may be, shall constitute an ad 
hoc Disposal Team composed of not more than three (3) regular COMELEC 
employees of the office where the property to be disposed is located.”  

 
19.3 It was noted that various AOs failed to dispose unserviceable properties. 

Details are as follows: 
 

Table No. 33 – Undisposed unserviceable properties 

Regions Remarks 

V Unserviceable PPEs from the PES of Catanduanes and Sorsogon in the total 
amount of ₱6,482,237.36 remained undisposed. 

IX RPCPPE and IIRUP of Districts I and II and the PES of Zamboanga 
Sibugay, Zamboanga del Sur and Zamboanga del Norte and the 
corresponding EOs/AOs of different municipalities under it, disclosed 
several equipment found unserviceable that remain undisposed 

XII A total of 1,256 unserviceable properties items with a book value of 
₱8,306,536.09 remain undisposed. 

XIII IIRUP disclosed that unserviceable properties with book values 
totaling₱17,360,179.87, remain undisposed. 

XVI Disposal of unserviceable properties and equipment was not undertaken by 
the AOs from the province of Negros Occidental and Silay City. 

 
 



60 
 

19.4 We recommended that Management require the RED to coordinate 
with the COMELEC, Main Office for the valuation of the unserviceable 

properties to facilitate the disposal of unserviceable PPEs thus, 

preventing their further deterioration and of becoming worthless, in 

accordance with Section 79 of PD 1445. 
 

19.5 Management commented that Region V was able to dispose the 
unserviceable properties assigned to them. For other regions, pre-preparatory 
activities are being done such as the computation by the AD of the 
depreciated costs of the unserviceable equipment, appraisal and conduct of 
public auction. 

 
 
Unreliable balance of Accounts Payable account – ₱340.235 million 
 
20. The accuracy and reliability of the Accounts Payable account amounting to 

₱340.235 million could not be ascertained due to: a) balances without 

supporting schedules amounting to ₱322.883 million or 95 percent of the total 

Accounts Payable that had been in the books for more than four  years;  
b) unrecorded payables amounting to ₱42.074 million; and c) erroneous 

aging schedule of accounts which could not be relied upon thus, precluded the 

Audit Team from verifying/tracing the validity/correctness of 

obligations/claimants and ultimately affecting the fair presentation of the 

account in the Financial Statements. 

 

20.1 Section 98 of PD 1445 provides the reversion of any unliquidated balance of 
accounts payable in the books of the national government to the 
unappropriated surplus of the general fund of the national government, 
which has been outstanding for two years or more and against which no 
actual claim, administrative or judicial, has been filed or which is not 
covered by perfected contracts on record. 

 
20.2 Section 1 of Executive Order (EO) No. 87 dated August 13, 2019 prescribes 

that all documented accounts payable which remain outstanding for at least 
two years, for which no actual administrative or judicial claim has been 
filed, shall be subject to automatic reversion. 

 
20.3 As at August 31, 2020, the Accounts Payable account had a balance of  

₱340,234,687.75, broken down as follows: 
 

Table No. 34 – Breakdown of Accounts Payable account

Total ₱     340,234,687.75  

 
20.4 Verification of the account disclosed the following: 

 
a. Balances without supporting schedules – ₱322.883 million 

 
20.5 The Audit Team noted the continued existence of balances without 

supporting schedules amounting to ₱322,883,362.80 or 95 percent of the 
total Accounts Payable account, which comprised of SLs captioned as  
“For Reconciliation” and “Others.”  Details are as follows: 

 
Table No.  35 – List of SLs without supporting schedules - AP 

Sub-SL Code Description Amount 

20101010-00-999-
BEG1 For Reconciliation (2015 and Prior Years) ₱   51,062,246.98

BEG2 For Reconciliation (Payables in 2016) 271,821,115.82  

Total ₱ 322,883,362.80 

 
20.6 The accounts pertained to transactions from CY 2015 and prior years which 

were not supported with SLs or breakdowns thus, the nature and details of 
which could not be verified. 
 

20.7 The amount had been in the books for more than four years and not 
supported with valid obligations which still formed part of the balance of the 
Accounts Payable, contrary to Section 98 of PD 1445 and Section 1 of EO 
No. 87 dated August 13, 2019. 

 
20.8 Inquiry revealed that for CY 2016, the AD set up accounts payable based on 

approved Obligation Request and Status (ORS), contrary to the provisions of 
the above cited circular which provides that accounts payable is used to 
recognize receipt of goods or services on account thus, cancelled ORS for 
transactions that did not push through may still form part of the balance. 

 
b. Unrecorded payables – ₱42.074 million 

 
20.9 The Notice of Deliveries showed that there were goods already delivered 

and services already rendered as at August 31, 2020 amounting to 
₱42,074,156.32 but remain unrecorded in the books.  

 



62 
 

20.10 The non- recording of the above deliveries resulted in the understatement of 
the Accounts Payable account and the corresponding asset/expense accounts 
by the same amount. 

 
c. Erroneous aging schedule of accounts 

 
20.11 It was noted that the aging schedule of Accounts Payable was not properly 

maintained since the actual age of some accounts was not correctly 
presented/categorized.  The SLs captioned as “For Reconciliation” which 
pertained to CYs 2016 payables and 2015 and prior years were categorized 
under the “Over two years” even if the same were already recorded in the 
books for four years or more thus, the submitted aging report could not be 
relied upon. 
 

20.12 Confirmation with the COA-ASDOSO disclosed that since the enhanced 
eNGAS automatically categorizes the payables based on the period when 
they were obligated, the aging of accounts would be accurate if the 
recording and forwarding of balances are done on time and accounts are 
updated regularly. 
 

20.13 The Accounting Division informed that they are currently reviewing the 
aging schedule.  
 

20.14 Moreover, the total balance of Accounts Payable was not supported with 
aging schedule thus, payables which remained outstanding for more than 
two years or more could not be determined and likewise not reverted to the 
unappropriated surplus of the general fund, which is not in conformity with 
Section 98 of PD 1445 and Section 1 of EO No. 87 dated August 13, 2019. 

 
20.15 The existence of balances without supporting schedules, unrecorded 

payables, and the erroneous aging schedule of accounts payable precluded 
the Audit Team from verifying/tracing the validity/correctness of 
obligations/claimants and ultimately affecting the fair presentation of the 
account in the Financial Statements. 

 
20.16 It is worthy to mention that the balances without supporting schedules and 

unrecorded payables have been included in the AAR for CY 2019, wherein 
courses of actions were recommended, however, the audit recommendations 
have not been fully complied with. 

 
20.17 We reiterated our previous recommendations that Management direct 

the Accounting Division to: 

 

a. Prepare SLs of Accounts Payable containing the details or 
breakdown of the balances; reconcile with their respective 

controlling accounts regularly or at the end of each month; and 



63 
 

prepare schedules regularly to support the corresponding payable 

accounts; 

 

b. Scrutinize the balance of the 2016, 2015 and PYs’  
“For Reconciliation” account, determine the actual amount with 

valid obligations and make the necessary adjusting entries for 

cancelled ORS still included in the balance of the Accounts Payable 
account. Thereafter, revert all outstanding accounts payable which 

had been outstanding for more than two years and those not covered 

with perfected contracts, as required under the above-cited 

regulations. Should there be claims after the same had been reverted, 

request the DBM for appropriate funding; and 

 

c. Prepare journal entry voucher to immediately record the delivered 
goods and services to come up with a more realistic balance of the 

account. 

 

20.18 We further recommended that the Accounting Division: 
 

a. Revert the balances of the SLs without supporting schedules and all 
outstanding payables which remained outstanding for at least two 

years, for which no actual administrative or judicial claim has been 

filed, pursuant to Section 98 of PD 1445 and Executive Order No. 87; 

and 

 

b. Prepare and maintain a correct aging schedule of accounts payable 
indicating the proper actual age of the accounts. 

 
20.19 Management commented that: 

 
a. They will adhere to the audit recommendation of expediting the analysis 

and reconciliation of the SL captioned as “For Reconciliation” in the 
Cash LCCA account. The AD personnel are exerting their best efforts to 
retrieve records and files to expedite the reconciliation process and 
prepare any necessary adjusting entries and will expedite the analysis and 
reconciliation of the SL captioned as “For Reconciliation” in the Cash 
LCCA account and prepare any necessary adjusting entries; 

 
b. The AD and Budget Division are working together to fast track the 

identification of the list of approved and cancelled Obligation Request 
Status (ORS) to immediately effect necessary adjustments. Those 
identified payables which had been outstanding for more than two years 
and those not covered with perfected contracts will be reverted, 
accordingly; 

 



64 
 

c. The Accounting and Property Divisions are working hand-in-hand to 
facilitate and correct the unmatched details for efficient and proper 
recording. The temporary Property Numbers (PNs) previously assigned 
by the AD will be corrected and matched to the PNs assigned by the 
Property Division; and  

 
d. The AD is currently performing extensive review of the aging schedule 

generated by the system to be able to prepare and maintain a correct 
aging schedule of accounts payable account. 

 
 

Unreliable balance of the Inter-Agency Payables accounts - ₱383.036 million 
 

21. The balance of the Inter-Agency Payables accounts as at August 31, 2020 
amounting to ₱383.036 million remained unreliable due to: a) continued 

existence of unreconciled prior years’ balances with total net negative balance 

of ₱346.973 million; b) inclusion of negative sub-SL balances of various 

employees totaling ₱98.923 million; c) significant balance of various sub-SLs 

totaling ₱339.646 million; and d) delayed recording of 69 transactions 

amounting to ₱270,305.77.  
 

21.1 As at August 31, 2020, the Inter-Agency Payables accounts had a balance of 
₱383,035,860.20, details are shown in Table No. 36.

21.2 Verification and analysis of the accounts disclosed the following: 

 
a. Existence of unreconciled prior years’ balances in net negative balance – 

₱346.973 million  
 

21.3 Review of the SLs of Inter-Agency Payables accounts disclosed the 
continued existence of unreconciled balances which comprised mainly of 
various sub-SLs captioned as “For Reconciliation” and “Others” without 
details totaling a negative ₱346,973,345.53, as follows:

21.4 Table No. 37 showed the existence of substantial net negative, unreconciled 

balance which had been recorded in the books for years but remained not 
analyzed and unreconciled/unadjusted, thus, affecting the accuracy of the 
accounts as it decreased the total account balance. 
 

21.5 Also, reconciliation of the accounts by the Accounting Division was not 
made on a regular basis which contributed to the unreconciled balances from 
prior years to current year. 

 
a. Inclusion of negative sub-SL balance of various employees – ₱98.923 

million 
 

21.6 Analysis of the SLs of Inter-Agency Payable accounts also disclosed that 
various sub-SLs have negative balances totaling ₱98,923,190.21. Summary 
is provided as follows:

66 
 

21.7 The existence of negative sub-SL balances was due to improper posting to 
appropriate SL accounts, hence, decreased the actual balance of the accounts 
resulting in considerable misstatement in the financial statements. 
 
b. Significant balance of various sub-SLs – ₱339.646 million 

 
21.8 The following SLs in each Inter-agency Payables accounts represents the 

monthly mandatory contributions and withholding taxes withheld from 
employees which have ending balances as at August 31, 2020, as follows: 

 
Table No. 39 – SLs with significant ending balances-

Due to Pag-IBIG Premium 1,438,289.91 
Due to PhilHealth Premium            3,384,940.09 

 
21.9 The monthly remittances submitted by the Personnel Department however 

showed that the total amount withheld for the month of August 2020 totaled 
only to ₱27,944,520.24, not consistent or equivalent to the recorded ending 
balances of the SLs as provided in Table No. 39, which should only reflect 
the current contributions to be remitted the following month. 
 

21.10 Review of the sub-SLs revealed that several employees have significant 
ending balances which ranged from ₱1,000.00 to ₱629,822.69 and exceeded 
the limit of monthly contributions based on actual monthly salary of 
members as provided for under Section 5 of RA 10963 (TRAIN Law), 
Section 11 of the Revised IRR of RA 8291 (GSIS Contribution Rates), 
Section 7 of RA 9679 (Pag-IBIG Contribution Rates), and PhilHealth

c. Delayed recording of transactions –₱270,305.77 
 

21.11 It was noted that various JEVs were recorded late ranging from one to four 
months delay; hence, transactions were not recorded in the period they 
relate.  It was noted that various JEVs pertaining to 69 transactions from 
March to August 2020 amounting to ₱270,305.77 were recorded only in 
September 2020, resulting in the understatement of balances of the affected 
accounts as at August 31, 2020. Summary is shown Table No. 41.

21.12 The existence of unreconciled prior years’ balances, negative sub-SL 

balances due to improper posting, significant balances of Inter-Agency 
Payables, and existence of delayed recording of transactions cast doubt on 
the accuracy and reliability of the Inter-agency Payables accounts. 

 
21.13 We reiterated our previous recommendations that Management require 

the Accounting Division to: 

 

a. Exert extra effort to analyze and fast track the reconciliation of prior 
years’ unreconciled balances, and prepare the necessary 

adjustments, if warranted, for a fair presentation of the account; 
 

b. Extensively analyze the sub-SLs with negative balances which 
remain unreconciled and prepare the necessary adjusting entries to 

correct the account balance. Henceforth, direct the personnel in 

charge of the account to record transactions diligently to avoid 

accounting errors and/or mispostings and to regularly 

analyze/update/monitor SLs and reconcile the same with the General 

Ledger account; and 

 

c. Strictly monitor the deducted monthly contributions and 
withholding taxes so that balances shall pertain only to the 

unremitted deductions of the immediately preceding period which 

shall be remitted within the prescribed deadline in the following 

period. 

 
21.14 We further recommended that Management direct the Accounting 

Division to expedite the recording process such that transactions are 

properly recorded in the books in the period they relate and strictly 



68 
 

monitor completeness of recording to avoid incurrence of delayed 

recording. 
 

21.15 Management commented that: 
 

a. SLs mentioned were composed of balances carried over from previous 
years. It is worthy to mention that there had been difficulty in matching 
up the remittances to their proper payable set-up due to the hasten 
transition from manual accounting to the implementation of the enhanced 
eNGAS in recording the Commission's financial transactions in  
CY 2017; 

 
b. The AD had already taken steps to further analyze the negative SL 

balances by tracing each SL to the eNGAS to confirm the necessary 
details. The 194 negative SLs identified will be immediately adjusted in 
the books of accounts of the Commission. Rest assured that the AD is 
exerting its best efforts in the reconciliation of these negative SLs;  

 
c. Detailed working papers are being prepared monthly, and monitored by 

the AD to ensure that the amounts deducted from the respective salaries 
and other claims of the employees are the same amount remitted to the 
various government instrumentalities. Further, extensive review and 
controls will be implemented in recording the remittances transactions to 
avoid any errors in the posting of SLs or Sub-SLs; and 

 
d. Through the immense consideration and coordination shown by the 

COA, the FSD and Personnel Department have been consistently 
working together on the backlogs of recording the unrecorded 
transactions to be able to update the Commission's FS for CY 2020. 

 
 

Unreliable balance of Other Payables account – ₱5.569 billion 
 

22. The accuracy and reliability of the Other Payables account amounting to 
₱5.569 billion as at August 31, 2020 could not be ascertained due to:  

a) continuous existence of SL balances without supporting schedules 

amounting to ₱5.268 billion and sub SLs captioned “For Reconciliation” and 

“Others” amounting to P455.087 million; b) existence of negative sub-SL 

balances totaling ₱161.142 million; and c) non-preparation of aging schedule 

of accounts, thus, precluded the Audit Team from verifying/tracing the 

validity/correctness of obligations/claimants and ultimately affecting the fair 

presentation of the financial statements. 

 

22.1 Under GAM Volume III, it provides that the Other Payables account is used 
to recognize other liabilities not falling under any of the specific payable 
accounts. The amount is debited for settlement of liabilities.

22.3 Verification of the account revealed the following: 
 

a. Continued existence of SL balances not supported with schedules – 
₱5.268 billion, net and “For Reconciliation” and “Others” – ₱455.087 
million 

 
22.4 It was noted that various SL balances were not supported with schedules 

thus, nature, details and existence of valid obligations/claimants could not be 
traced and verified, rendering it difficult to determine the accuracy and 
validity of the account balance. Details are as follows:

22.5 The existence of unreconciled balances of two sub-SLs captioned as  
“For Reconciliation” and “Others” was likewise noted. Details are as 
follows:

22.6 The above SLs pertained to beginning balances carried forward/set up 

during the roll out of eNGAS in January 1, 2017, with the intention to 
analyze and reclassify/reconcile/adjust the same to its proper account, 
however, to date, the same remain unreclassified/unreconciled/unadjusted.  
 
b. Existence of negative sub-SL balances – ₱161.142 million 
 

22.7 Verification of SLs also revealed the existence of negative sub-SL balances 
totaling ₱161,141,738.98 which decreased the overall total balance of the 
Other Payables account. Details are as follows:

22.8 The existence of negative balances indicates that there were overpayment 
made, unrecorded obligations and/or erroneous posting of transactions thus, 
cast doubt on the accuracy and reliability of the account. 

 
c. Non-preparation of aging schedule of accounts 

 
22.9 Further, the total balance of the account was not supported with Aging 

Schedule thus, payables which remained outstanding for more than two 
years or more were not determined and likewise not reverted to the 
unappropriated surplus of the general fund, which is not in conformity with 
the above-cited regulations. 
 

22.10 The absence of the related schedules to support the Other Payables account, 
existence of negative sub-SL balances and absence of Aging Schedule, 
precluded the Audit Team from verifying/tracing the validity/correctness of 
obligations/claimants and ultimately affecting the fair presentation of the 
financial statements. 

 
22.11 The same observations have been included in the AAR of the COMELEC 

for CY 2019 wherein courses of actions were recommended. To date, 
however, the audit recommendations have not been fully complied with. 

 
 



72 
 

22.12 We reiterated our recommendations that Management direct the 
Accounting Division to: 

 

a. Prepare the list/breakdown of payables under each SLs containing 
the details to determine existence of valid obligation/claimants; and 

revert all payables which remained outstanding for at least two 

years, for which no actual administrative or judicial claim has been 

filed, pursuant to Section 98 of PD 1445 and EO No. 87; 

 

b. Extensively analyze and reconcile the Other Payables account to 
identify the details of the “For Reconciliation” SLs and negative sub-

SL balances, and effect proper adjustments, if warranted, to present 

the reliable balances of the accounts; and 

 

c. Prepare the Aging Schedule, determine which had been outstanding 
for more than two years and revert the same as required under the 

above cited regulations. Should there be claims after the same had 

been reverted, request DBM for appropriate funding. 

 

22.13 Management commented that: 
 

a. There had been difficulties and challenges in the reconciliation of the 
balance of other payables account since majority pertained to the 
beginning balances carried forward/set up during the roll out of eNGAS 
on January 1, 2017. Despite these difficulties and challenges being 
experienced in reconciling this account, continuous analysis is being 
done of the OP account; and 

 
b. The enhanced eNGAS has a feature named as “Schedule of Payable 

Account Feature” (SPAF) under the "Query" in the Menu Bar that should 
generate the Aging Schedule of Other Payables account. However, after 
several attempts the said feature could not generate the report; the system 
is lagging and not responding. The FSD has already drafted a letter 
addressed to COA-ASDOSO, and this concern will be added thereto 
requesting their assistance to resolve the said encountered issues and 
concerns relative to the on-going use of eNGAS. 

 
 
Unrecorded Depreciation 
 
23. Depreciation expenses were recognized only when the Property Plant and 

Equipment (PPE) are recorded and not when available for use, resulting in 

the overstatement of the book value of the affected PPE accounts by ₱2.802 

million and the Accumulated Surplus/Deficit account by ₱2.589 million, and 
the understatement of the respective Depreciation Expense and Accumulated 
Depreciation accounts by ₱0.213 million and ₱2.802 million, respectively. 



73 
 

23.1 Item c, Section 27, Chapter 10 of the GAM, Volume I states that, 
Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use such as when it 
is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in 
the manner intended by management. For simplicity and to avoid 
proportionate computation, depreciation shall be for one month if the PPE 
is available for use on or before the 15th of the month. However, if the PPE 
is available for use after the 15th of the month, depreciation shall be for the 
succeeding month. 

 
23.2 Item e, Section 27, Chapter 10 of the same Manual further states that, the 

straight-line method of depreciation shall be adopted unless another method 
is more appropriate for entity operation. That method is applied consistently 
from period to period unless there is a change in the expected pattern of 
consumption of those future economic benefits or service potential. 

 

23.3 PPE gradually loses its ability to provide service over the course of time. 
Thus, its cost needs to be distributed on a systematic basis over its useful 
life. The allocated cost is referred to as depreciation. Except for land and not 
recognized heritage assets, all PPE shall be depreciated. 

 

23.4 Depreciation shall be recognized as a debit to the Depreciation Expense 
account and credit to the Accumulated Depreciation account. COMELEC 
uses the straight-line method of depreciation and adopted a residual value 
equivalent to five percent (5%).  

 
23.5 Verification of the GLs of various PPE accounts disclosed transactions 

pertaining to the acquisition of PPE that were not recorded in the period of 
delivery or when the assets were available for use, were inconsistent with 
the provisions of Section 27, Chapter 10 of the GAM, Volume I. 

 
23.6 Further analysis of JEVs of the foregoing transactions disclosed that upon 

recording of said PPE, the corresponding depreciation expense and 
accumulated depreciation were not recognized thus, overstating the book 
value (BV) of the PPE. Details are in Table No. 46.

23.7 The non-recording of depreciation expenses resulted in the overstatement of 
the BV of the affected PPE accounts by ₱2,801,737.44 and the Accumulated 
Surplus/Deficit account by ₱2,589,011.37 for depreciation expense 
pertaining to prior year, and understatement of the Depreciation Expense 
and Accumulated Depreciation accounts by ₱212,726.07 and ₱2,801,737.44 
respectively. 

 
23.8 Inquiry from the AD personnel revealed that JEVs for the setting up of 

payables for the acquisition of PPE were prepared only at the time the 
payment was made, since the AD used the Inspection and Acceptance 
Report (IAR) attached to the Disbursement Voucher (DV), resulting in the 
late recording of PPE and the corresponding Depreciation Expense. 

 
23.9 Had the Property Division forwarded copies of the IAR to the AD 

immediately, and subsequently, the latter used the same to record the 
corresponding payable account, the aforementioned misstatements in the 
accounting books could have been avoided. 

 

23.10 We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 

a. Require the Accounting Division to review and analyze the JEVs 
pertaining to the acquisition of PPE that were not recorded 

immediately at the time of delivery/put into use and prepare 

appropriate adjusting entries to come up with a more reliable 

balance of the affected accounts; and 

 
b. Require the Property Division to promptly and regularly forward 

copies of Inspection and Acceptance Report to the Accounting 

Division in accordance with the provisions of Appendix 62 of the 

GAM, Volume II, for recording purposes.  
 



75 
 

COMPLIANCE ISSUES 

 
Overpayment of Honoraria 

 

24. Payment of Honoraria to members of the Bids and Awards Committee 
(BAC), Technical Working Group (TWG) and BAC Secretariat for CY 2019 

in the total amount of ₱5.054 million charged against the Trust Fund account 

of the COMELEC exceeded the total collections from successfully completed 

procurement projects of ₱2.122 million, or an overpayment of ₱2.932 million, 

due to the non-monitoring of collections and payment of honoraria.  
 

24.1 Section 58 of the General Provisions of the General Appropriations Act 
(GAA) for FY 2019 provides that the grant of honoraria to officials and 
employees shall be subject to the guidelines prescribed under BC No. 2003-
5 dated September 26, 2003 as amended by BC No. 2007-1 dated April 23, 
2007 and NBC. No. 2007-510 dated May 8, 2007, BC No. 2007-2 dated 
October 1, 2007, BC No. 2004-5A dated October 7, 2005, as amended by 
BC No. 2007-3 dated November 29, 2007, DBM and DOST J.C No. 1 dated 
June 25, 2013 and such other guidelines issued by the DBM. (underscoring 
supplied) 

 
24.2 Item 4 of DBM Budget Circular (BC) No. 2004-5A defines Honoraria as a 

form of compensation granted to individuals for the performance of tasks or 
involvement in activities beyond their regular functions. 

 
24.3 A procurement project shall be considered successfully completed once the 

contract has been awarded to the winning bidder. (DBM BC No. 2004-5A) 
 

24.4 Section 5.7 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012, states that, 
Government personnel performing activities or discharging duties in 
addition to, or over and above their regular functions may be granted 
honoraria. 

 
24.5 Moreover, Section 5.7.1 of the same COA Circular also states that the 

guidelines in the grant of honoraria to government personnel involved in 
government procurement are prescribed under DBM BC No. 2004-5A, dated 
March 23, 2004 as amended by DBM BC No. 2007-3, dated November 29, 
2007. The honoraria shall be sourced from the following: 

 
24.6 Collections from successfully completed procurement projects limited, 

however, to activities prior to awarding of contracts to winning bidders: 
 
 Proceeds from sale of bid documents; 
 Fees from contractor/supplier registry; 
 Fees charged to copies of minutes of bid openings,  

BAC resolutions and other BAC documents; 



76 
 

 Protest fees; and 
 Proceeds from bid security forfeiture. 

 
24.7 Savings realized from the current year specific budget of the agency under 

the General Appropriations Act (GAA).  
 

24.8 In case of deficiency of collections from procurement activities and 
availability of agency savings, the amount of honoraria shall be adjusted 
proportionately for all those entitled thereto, pursuant to Section 3.5 of  
DBM BC No. 2007-3. 

 
24.9 Audit disclosed that honoraria granted to the members of the Bids and 

Awards Committee (BAC), Technical Working Group (TWG) and BAC 
Secretariat for CY 2019 amounted to ₱5,053,886.00 was charged against the 
Trust Fund account of the COMELEC.  However, the funding source that 
came from successfully completed procurement projects for CY 2019 
amounted only to ₱2,121,600.00, resulting in an overpayment of 
₱2,932,286.00. Details are presented below:

24.10 Further analysis of the Cash in Bank - Local Currency, Current revealed that 
notwithstanding the deficiency in collections, the payment of honoraria was 
charged solely to the Trust Fund account of the COMELEC, instead of 
utilizing the savings realized from the CY specific budget under the GAA, if 
any, thus, collections intended for other purpose recorded under the Trust 
Fund account was utilized for the payment of the excess honoraria. 

 
24.11 The lack of proper monitoring of the collections from successfully 

completed procurement projects due to the absence of subsidiary ledgers for 
each kind of collections; and the grant of honoraria to the members of BAC, 
TWG and BAC Secretariat, resulted in incurrence of overpayment of 
honoraria amounting to ₱2,932,286.00.  

 



77 
 

24.12 We recommended and Management agreed to require: 
 

          The Finance Services Department, the BAC, the TWG and the BAC 

Secretariat to: 

 

a. Explain the incurrence of overpayment of honoraria amounting to 
₱2,932,286.00, and why the same should not be disallowed in audit; 

and  

 

b. Grant and claim honoraria strictly in accordance with the provisions 
of the above cited regulations.  

 

The Finance Services Department to: 

 

c. Prepare/maintain sub-SL accounts for each kind of collections 
deposited to the Trust Fund account for proper monitoring thereof. 

 
 

Use of 14 Shuttle Buses for service of employees was not optimized 
 
25. Of the 14 Shuttle Buses leased by the COMELEC through negotiated 

procurement under emergency cases with a total contract price of ₱9.744 

million, the use of seven or 50 percent was not optimized since the average 

number of passengers per bus ranged only from two to nine passengers per 

bus/per day, resulting in wastage of government resources.  

 

25.1 GPPB Circular No. 04-2016 entitled, “Clarification on Negotiated 
Procurement under Emergency Cases modality embodied in Section 53.2 of 
the Updated 2016 Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of 
Republic Act (RA) No. 9184,” explains the provisions on Negotiated 
Procurement (Emergency Cases). 

 

25.2 Item 3.2 of the above-mentioned Circular, citing Section 53.2 of the Updated 
2016 Revised IRR and Item V(D) (2a) of Annex “H” of the same IRR, on 
Negotiated Procurement (Emergency Cases) modality may be resorted to in 
the following instances: 

 
a) In case of imminent danger to life or property during a state of 

calamity; 
 
b) When time is of the essence arising from natural or man-made 

calamities; or 
 

c) Other causes where immediate action is necessary to prevent 
damage to or loss of life or property, or to restore vital public 
services, infrastructure facilities and other public utilities. 



78 
 

25.3 As stated in Section 58 of PD 1445, one of the Commission’s audit 
objectives is to audit the assets of the audited agency if the assets were 
utilized economically, efficiently and effectively. 

 
25.4 On March 9, 2020, the President signed Proclamation No. 922 declaring a 

State of Public Health Emergency throughout the Philippines upon the 
recommendation of Department of Health (DOH) following the confirmed 
local transmission of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). 

 
25.5 Paragraph 3 of the BAC Resolution No. 04-2020 states that, the COMELEC 

Aware of its parens patriae duty towards its employees resolved to 
approved during its June 10, 2020 Commission En Banc’s online meeting 
the CY 2020 3rd Supplemental Annual Procurement Plan (APP), which 
included the procurement thru negotiated procurement (emergency cases) 
the lease of shuttle buses that will transport employees to and from work. 

 
25.6 The BAC, with the assistance of the Administrative Services Department 

(ASD) (the end-user), directly negotiated with the provider, Classic Leisure 
International Travel and Tours, Inc., to determine the said company’s 
compliance with the Terms of Reference (TOR). 

 
25.7 On July 15, 2020, the Commission entered into a contract agreement with 

Classic Leisure International Travel and Tours, Inc, for the lease of 14 units 
shuttle bus service with seating capacity of 45-50 seats per bus, based on the 
minimum specifications indicated in the TOR at ₱11,600.00 per day, for 60 
working days or with a total contract amount of ₱9,744,000.00, intended for 
the COMELEC employees. Notice to Proceed was issued on the same date. 
 

25.8 Analysis and verification of the attendance sheets of the shuttle bus service 
disclosed that the average number of employees who availed of the service 
bus ranged from 2 to 18 employees, per bus/per day. Details are shown in

25.9 It could be gleaned from Table No. 48 that Buses No. 1, 2, 3, 7, 12, 13 and 
14 or 50 percent of the total shuttle bus service had a very minimal number 
of passengers averaging only from 2 to 9 per day, which is way below the 
maximum capacity allowed, which is considered wasteful use of resources. 
Smaller vehicles could have been utilized for the routes of the said buses. 
 

25.10 It was noted that in view of the minimal number of passengers, the ASD 
discontinued the operation of the four buses (Bus Nos. 11 to 14) effective 
August 2020. The remaining number of days of the said buses was 
distributed equally to the remaining 10 buses, an extension of 20 days for 
each bus, or a total of 80 days instead of the 60-day contract period.  

 
25.11 It was also noted that some buses (Bus Nos. 1,2,3,7) with average minimal 

passengers ranging from 4 to 9 were extended. 
 

25.12 It was also observed that around mid of September 2020, Bus No. 1 with 
route from Bicutan to COMELEC Main Office and vice versa, had only one 
passenger, which we have also verified based on the submitted attendance 
report on September 16 and 23, 2020. 

 
25.13 Inquiry revealed with the Procurement Management Division (PMD) that 

the routes of the 14 shuttle bus service were determined by the ASD based 
on the latter’s 2014 survey of residential address of various COMELEC 
officers and employees.  

 
25.14 Had the ASD judiciously and meticulously planned the procurement of the 

leased buses, monitored execution thereof, terminated the service of buses 
with minimal passengers and used a smaller vehicle instead to fetch the 
employees, the Commission could have saved millions of pesos which could 
have been utilized for other priority projects. 

 
25.15 Thus, the use of seven or 50 percent of the total leased buses were not 

optimized resulting in wastage of government resources. 
 

25.16 Management explained that: 
 

a. The lease of buses was opted instead of small vehicles considering the 
number of employees to be served vis-à-vis DOTR circular setting the 
operational capacity of shuttle buses to 50 percent.  A market survey was 



80 
 

conducted by the Personnel Department. Out of 1,016 employees 
responded to the survey, 682 answered yes in availing the shuttle service; 
and 

 

b. From July 2020 to December 2020, COMELEC wide lockdowns were 
implemented due to COVID 19 infections of some of its employees. As a 
consequence, the number of availing passengers was affected by the said 
lockdowns. 

 

25.17 We recommended and Management agreed to require the ASD to: 
 

a. Submit planning reports and/or cost-benefit analysis on the lease of 
the 14 Shuttle Bus Service and explain the continued service and/or 

extended service of various shuttle bus service despite minimal 

passengers; and 

 

b. Consider preparing a realistic cost-benefit analysis before entering 
into a contract with the same nature to avoid wastage of government 

resources. 

 

 

Delayed recording and submission of ADA Disbursement Vouchers issued from the 
Cash – Modified Disbursement System (MDS) account 

 

26. Disbursement vouchers/payrolls and its supporting documents of 15 Advice 
to Debit Account (ADA) issued for the months of March, April and May 2020 

with total amount of ₱26.597 million were recorded several months after 

issuance, or a delay ranging from 2 to 93 days, resulting in the 

understatement of the related expense/asset accounts and overstatement of 

the Cash-MDS account as of the months the said ADAs were prepared/issued. 
In addition, the said disbursement vouchers were not submitted for audit and 

final custody within the prescribed period or a delay ranging from 205 to 252 

days thus, rendering it difficult to verify the validity, regularity and 

completeness of recording and submission of related documents.  

 

26.1 Section 7.2.1 (a) of COA Circular No. 2009-006 reiterates that the Chief 
Accountant, Bookkeeper or other authorized official performing accounting 
and/or bookkeeping functions of the audited agency shall ensure that the 
reports and supporting documents submitted by the accountable officers are 
immediately recorded in the books of accounts and submitted to the Auditor 
within the first ten (10) days of the ensuing month. 
 

26.2 Section 52, Chapter 6 of the GAM, Volume I, provides that all LDDAP-
ADA prepared/issued during the day shall be recorded chronologically in the 
Checks and ADA Disbursements Record (CkADADRec) maintained by the 
Cash/Treasury Unit. The dates the LDDAP-ADAs were actually delivered to 



81 
 

the MDS-GSB shall be indicated in the appropriate column provided for in 
the CkADADRec. The Report of Advice to Debit Account Issued (RADAI) 
shall be prepared by the Cash/Treasury Unit daily. All approved LDDAP-
ADA including those not yet delivered to the MDS-GSB shall be included in 
the RADAI. The RADAI together with the original copies of the 
disbursement vouchers (DVs) and other supporting documents (SDs) shall 
be submitted to the Accounting Division/Unit for the preparation of JEV. 

 
26.3 Verification disclosed that the DVs/payrolls and its supporting documents of 

15 ADA issued for the months of March, April and May 2020 were recorded 
several months after issuance thereof, or a delay ranging from 2 to 93 days, 
resulting in the understatement of the related expense/asset accounts and 
overstatement of the Cash-MDS account as of the months said  
LDDAP-ADA were prepared/issued, contrary to the above cited regulations. 

 

26.4 Moreover, the said disbursement vouchers/payrolls were not submitted for 
audit and final custody on time or a delay ranging from 205 to 252 days, 
rendering it difficult to verify their validity, regularity and completeness of 
recording and submission of related documents. 

 
26.5 Inquiry from the AD revealed that the Data Processing Division (DPD) 

submitted the RADAIs with incomplete paid DVs and supporting 
documents, thus, only the submitted DVs/payrolls with complete supporting 
documents were subjected for JEV preparation and subsequent recording. 
The DVs that were verified with incomplete supporting documents, when 
submitted, will be recorded individually in the later months from their 
issuance, which does not conform with the above cited regulations. 

 
26.6 Inquiry was likewise made with the DPD and informed that some  

LDDAP - ADA DVs still lack documents; hence, the delayed submission to 
the AD caused their delayed recording.  

 
26.7 The delayed submission of DVs/payrolls included in the RCIs and delayed 

recording thereof understated the related expense/asset accounts and 
correspondingly overstated the Cash-MDS account as of the month these 
were drawn/issued. 

 
26.8 Management could have prevented the incurrence of undue delays in the 

recording/submission of reports/documents had they strictly enforce the 
deadlines set under the above rules and regulations. 

 
26.9 It is worthy to mention that the same observation was already raised in the 

prior year’s audit report; however, to date, the audit recommendations have 
not been fully complied with and the delay had become unusually lengthy. 

 



82 
 

26.10 We reiterated our previous recommendations that Management require 
the: 

 

a. Data Processing Division to timely submit to the Accounting Division 
the Report of Advice to Debit Account Issued, together with all 

disbursement vouchers/payrolls and their supporting documents,  

for immediate recording in the books of accounts so that transactions 

will be properly recorded in the period they were incurred; and 

 

b. Accounting Division to submit the paid DVs/payrolls and its 
supporting documents and other required reports/documents within 

the period prescribed under the above cited regulations. 

 
26.11 Management commented that the AD, since the transition from manual 

accounting to the implementation of the enhanced eNGAS, has encountered 
countless difficulties in attaining the prescribed deadline of recording and 
submission of ADA DVs and supporting documents to COA. Increase in 
manpower, additional working hours and enhancement of controls are only a 
few of the counter measures undertaken to facilitate the increasing demand 
for this long-overdue compliance to COA. Moreover, due to the setback 
brought about by the recent lockdown because of the COVID-19 pandemic, 
the FSD was once again overwhelmed by the volume of the pending 
transactions. In response thereto, the Accounting Division together with the 
other divisions of FSD are making every possible effort to cope up with the 
delay. 

 
 
Delayed and/or Non-submission of Purchase Orders and Job Orders 
 
27. Copy of 61 perfected Purchase Orders (POs) and Job Orders (JOs) for the 

procurement of supplies, equipment and services with a total amount of 

₱4.072 million were not submitted for review. Moreover, 111 POs and JOs 

with total cost of ₱25.159 million were submitted beyond the reglementary 

period, or a delay ranging from 1 to 135 days thus, precluded the Audit Team 

of the timely review of contracts and supporting documents and prompt 

communication of results to Management. 

 

27.1 Section 3.1.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009 
provides that, Within five (5) working days from the execution of a contract 
by the government or any of its subdivisions, agencies or instrumentalities, 
including government-owned and controlled corporations and their 
subsidiaries, a copy of said contract and each of all the documents forming 
part thereof by reference or incorporation shall be furnished to the Auditor 
of the agency concerned. 

 



83 
 

27.2 Further, Section 3.2.1 of the same Circular states that, shall, within five (5) 
working days from issuance thereof, be submitted to the Auditor concerned. 
xxx. 

 
27.3 The Audit Team issued a letter dated January 19, 2021 to the Procurement 

Management Department (PMD) requesting for the complete list of POs and 
JOs issued for CY 2020. In response, the PMD submitted a Memorandum 
dated January 26, 2021 forwarding the same to the Audit Team. 

 
27.4  Comparison of the total number of POs and JOs issued for the procurement 

of supplies, equipment and services as against the number of copies 
submitted by the PMD showed that out of the 232 perfected POs and JOs 
totaling ₱38,691,115.96 for CY 2020, only 171 POs and JOs amounting to 
₱34,619,459.59 were submitted to COA for review. Thus, 61 POs and JOs 
totaling ₱4,071,656.37 representing 26 percent of the total contracts were 
not submitted to the Audit Team for review, contrary to the aforementioned 
COA Circular. 

 
27.5 It was also noted that 111 POs and JOs were not submitted within five days 

from its execution or a delay ranging from 1 to 135 days from the date of 
receipt of the PO and JO by the supplier or duly representative, likewise, 
contrary to the provisions of the same COA Circular. 

 
27.6 Considerably, the community quarantine effected in the country contributed 

to the late submission of POs and JOs. However, the number of days during 
the Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) and Modified Enhanced 
Community Quarantine (MECQ) were deducted to arrive at the above-
mentioned number of delays. Moreover, disinfection of office every Friday 
of each month was also deducted in the computation of number of days 
delayed. Despite such considerations, significant delays in the submission of 
POs and JOs were still observed. 

 
27.7 Sample computation for PO No. 20CMSUP.05.079, signed by the supplier 

on May 25, 2020 and received by COA on November 9, 2020 are as 
follows: 

 

 

 

 

 
 
 
 

No. of days delayed = Date Received by COA – Conforme Date –No. of Non-working Days - 
ECQ/MECQ Days – 5 
(November 9, 2020 – May 25, 2020) = 168 days 
168–64 –21 – 5 = 78 days delayed

27.8 The delayed and non-submission of copy of POs and JOs and supporting 
documents hampered the review and evaluation of documents, and 
precluded the Team from determining Management’s compliance with 
procurement laws, rules and regulations.  It also prevented the Audit Team 
from immediately informing Management of deficiency noted on the 
transactions for appropriate corrective measures, if any. 

 
27.9 We recommended that Management direct the Procurement 

Management Department to submit all perfected Purchase Orders and 

Job Orders within the prescribed period provided under COA Circular 

No. 2009-001, for the review and evaluation thereof.  
 

27.10 Management commented that they will exert their best effort to strictly 
comply with the requirements. They have submitted copies of POs/JOs that 
were inadvertently omitted to the Office of the Resident Auditor for its 
consideration and asked for understanding and compassion on the matter. 

 
 

Delayed/Non-submission of Contracts, incomplete basic documentary requirements, and 
delay in procurement activities 
 
28. Copy of 15 perfected contracts/agreements and their supporting documents 

with corresponding amount of ₱102.947 million were not submitted as of 

date, while 15 contracts submitted beyond the prescribed period, with delay 

ranging from 1 to 59 days.  Moreover, contracts submitted amounting to 

₱141.545 million were not supported with complete documentary 

requirements. Further, various procurement activities exceeded the 

maximum period allowed by 19 to 80 days due to non-monitoring of the 

procurement timeline; hence, longer acquisition time and delay in the 

implementation of Programs, Activities, and Projects of the Commission. 
 

a. Non-submission/delayed submission of contracts and incomplete 
documentary requirements 

 
28.1 Section 3.1.1 on the Submission and Review Process of Contracts under 

COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009 states that, “Within 
five (5) working days from the execution of a contract by the government or 
any of its subdivisions, agencies or instrumentalities, including government-
owned and controlled corporations and their subsidiaries, a copy of said 
contract and each of all the documents forming part thereof by reference or 
incorporation shall be furnished to the Auditor of the agency concerned 
xxx.” 
 

28.2 Section 9.1 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 4, 2012 lists down 
the basic requirements for all types of procurement through Public Bidding. 
Likewise, Section 23.1 of the Updated 2016 Revised IRR of RA 9184 



85 
 

further enumerates the eligibility requirements for the procurement of goods 
and infrastructure projects. 

 
28.3 It was noted that 15 out of 42 or 36 percent of the perfected contracts for 

goods and services with corresponding amount of ₱102,947,429.71 were not 
submitted to the Audit Team as of this writing, contrary to the above cited 
regulations, thus, auditorial review was not conducted. 

 
28.4 Majority of the unsubmitted contracts pertained to lease agreements and 

Memorandum of Agreement handled by the ASD.  
 

28.5 Also, 15 out of 27 or 56 percent of the contracts received were submitted 
beyond the prescribed period or a delay ranging from 1 to 59 days, likewise, 
contrary to the said provision. 

 
28.6 Review of the submitted high value contracts amounting to ₱10 million and 

above submitted by the Contract Management Division for CY 2020 totaling 
to ₱141,544,897.08 revealed that the same were not supported with 
complete documentary requirements provided under Section 9.1 of COA 
Circular No. 2012-001 and Section 23.1 of the Updated 2016 Revised IRR 
of RA 9184, thereby, causing delay in the completion of the auditorial 
review thereof. Documents that were not attached were as follows: 

 
a. Letter of Intent from Prospective Bidders; 
b. Minutes of Pre-Bid Conference; 
c. Notice of Post-Qualification; 
d. Program of Work and Detailed Estimates; 
e. Detailed Computation of Contract Time; 
f. Detailed Breakdown of Approved Budget for the Contract (ABC); 
g. Statement of the prospective bidder of all its ongoing government 

and private contracts, including contracts awarded but not yet 
started; 

h. Statement of the bidder's Single Largest Completed Contract 
(SLCC) similar to the contract to be bid; 

i. Computation of Net Financial Contracting Capacity (NFCC) or a 
committed Line of Credit from a Universal or Commercial Bank; 

j. Bid Security; and 
k. Omnibus Sworn Statement 

 
28.7 It was also noted that some documents have incomplete signatures, not 

dated, and not authenticated. These and the above deficiencies pose 
uncertainty as to the propriety and validity of the contracts.   

 
28.8 The delayed/non-submission of contracts and the corresponding complete 

supporting documents within the prescribed period precluded the Audit 



86 
 

Team from timely review, evaluation and generation of related audit result 
on the transactions.  

 
28.9 We recommended that Management direct the: 

 

         Administrative Services Department and the Procurement Management 

Department (PMD) to: 

 
a. Cause the immediate submission of copies of unsubmitted contracts 

including the complete supporting documents thereof and 

henceforth, ensure submission of the same for review within the 

prescribed period as provided for under Section 3.1.1 of COA 

Circular No. 2009-001; and 

 

b. Submit the lacking supporting documents/requirements of the 
contracts submitted in compliance with Section 9.1 of COA Circular 

No. 2012-001 and Section 23.1 of the Updated 2016 Revised IRR of 

RA 9184. 

 

28.10 Management commented that they are still reconciling the records which are 
still stored in the PMD Office. 

 
b. Delays in the Procurement Activities  

 
28.11 Annex “C” of the Updated 2016 Revised IRR of RA 9184 recommends the 

earliest possible time and maximum period allowed for each procurement 
activity for the procurement of goods and services. Average procurement 
timeline ranges from 26 to 136 calendar days. 

 
28.12 Analysis of the procurement timelines of the same contracts subjected for 

auditorial review revealed that some procurement activities exceeded the 
maximum period allowed by 19 to 80 days per contract, which is not in 
conformity with the above regulation. Details are shown in Table No. 50.

******Supply and Delivery of Printer Toner Cartridges for Replacement of Stocks for 1st Quarter FY 2020, 
₱23,130,800.00. 
 
28.13 It was noted that the procurement activity which significantly caused the 

delay in the whole Procurement Process pertained to the contract preparation 
and signing which entailed delay ranging from 11 to 52 days, as shown in 
Table No. 50 above. 

 
28.14 Inquiry with the Contract Management Division disclosed that the cause of 

delay was the posting of performance security of the suppliers wherein they 
maximized the days allowed and the routing of the contract to signatories 
before the same is notarized and submitted thus, affecting the 
implementation of Programs, Activities, and Projects of the Commission. 

 
28.15 It is worthy to mention that efficiency is the ability to accomplish the desired 

output without wasting time and resources.  It is the extent to which time is 
well used for the intended purpose. The longer time incurred in each 



88 
 

procurement activity, contributes to the delay in the acquisition of goods and 
services which is vital in the implementation of programs, projects, and 
activities. 

 

28.16 We recommended that Management direct the PMD to expedite the 
procurement process specifically on contract preparation and signing 

for the timely acquisition of goods and services and strictly monitor the 

completion of each procurement activity in accordance with Annex “C” 

of the Updated 2016 Revised IRR of RA 9184, to avoid delay in the 
implementation of programs, projects and activities. 

 
28.17 Management commented that they will exert earnest efforts to ensure that 

the delays are avoided in the future and the mandated timelines strictly 
observed and complied with. They are presently addressing the said 
concerns/observations and are diligently exerting all efforts to identify the 
causes for these lapses and other deficiencies relative to procurement 
activities and contract implementation to correct and avoid repetition of the 
same in the future. 

 

 
Delayed deposit of collections 
 
29. Accountable Officers (AOs) from Regions II, III and IV-A were unable to 

deposit intact their daily collections totaling to ₱5.306 million within the 

prescribed period, exposing government funds to the risk of loss or 

misappropriation. 

 

29.1 Section 69.1 of PD 1445 provides that public officers authorized to receive 
and collect moneys arising from taxes, revenues or receipts of any kind shall 
remit or deposit intact the full amount so received and collected by them to 
the particular accounts to which the said moneys belong. 

 
29.2 Section 32 of the Revised Cash Examination Manual provides that all 

collecting officers shall deposit intact all their collections, as well as 
collections turned over to them by sub-collectors/tellers, with authorized 
government depository bank daily or not later than the next banking day. 
Where the collections are minimal and daily deposit thereof becomes costly 
and impractical, the collecting officers shall deposit their collections at least 
once a week, or as soon as the collections reach ₱10,000.00. 

 
29.3 Moreover, COMELEC Minute Resolution No. 14-0595 dated August 19, 

2014 provides that remittances of collections shall be made daily, weekly or 
monthly, through the nearest LBP branch under the account of COMELEC 
(Acct. No. 0012-1042-86) based on the parameters indicated therein. 

 



89 
 

29.4 It had been noted that various AOs of COMELEC did not deposit their 
collections intact and within the prescribed period, contrary to the above-
mentioned regulations. Details are as follows: 

 
Table No. 51 – AOs per region with delayed deposit of collections 

Regions Remarks 

II 12 AOs from the province of Isabela failed to comply with the rules and 
recommendations governing collections and deposits totaling ₱1,306,100.00. 

III Collections of 18 AOs from the province of Tarlac, and 33 AOs from the 
province of Nueva Ecija, totaling ₱2,392,659.00 were not deposited intact 
due to minimal amounts of daily collections. 

IV-A Collections of 23 AOs from the provinces of Cavite, Laguna, Batangas and 
Rizal, totaling ₱1,606,748.00 were not deposited intact and incurred delays of 
remittances ranging from 1 to 92 days. 

 
29.5 Failure to deposit the daily collections intact and regularly, exposing the 

government funds to risk of possible loss and misuse. Likewise, undue delay 
in the deposit deprived the government of much needed resources to fund 
additional projects or for official purpose. 

 

29.6 We recommended and Management agreed to require the AOs 
concerned to deposit their collections promptly and intact within the 

period prescribed under Section 32 of the Revised Cash Examination 

Manual and COMELEC Minute Resolution No. 14-0595 to avoid the 

risk of possible loss or misappropriation of government funds. 
 
 
Fidelity Bond 
 

30. A total of 111 Accountable Officers from NCR, Regions I, II, III, VII, X, XI 
and XVI were not properly bonded, thus, the government was not assured of 

cost recovery in the event of loss of funds/properties.  

 

30.1 Section 101 of PD 1445 provides that, “Every officer of any government 
agency whose duties permit or require the possession or custody of 
government funds or property shall be accountable therefor and for the 
safekeeping thereof in conformity with law. Every AO shall be properly 
bonded in accordance with law.” 

 
30.2 Provisions of Section 7.1 of COA Circular No. 97-002 as amended by COA 

Circular 2006-005 states that, “Each accountable officer whose total cash 
accountability is not less than ₱5,000.00 shall be bonded. The amount of 
bond shall depend on the total accountability of the officer as fixed by the 
Head of Agency. An official or employee who has both money and property 
accountability, shall be bonded once to cover both accountabilities, but the 
amount of the bond shall be in accordance with the Schedule issued by the 
Bureau of the Treasury." 

 



90 
 

30.3 Likewise, Section 4.1 of Treasury Circular No. 02-2009 dated August 6, 
2009 provides that every officer, agent and employee of the Government of 
the Philippines or of the companies or corporations of which the majority of 
the stock is held by the National Government, regardless of the status of 
their appointment shall, whenever the nature of the duties performed by such 
officer, agent or employee permits or requires the possession, custody or 
control of funds or properties for which he is accountable, be deemed a 
bondable officer and shall be bonded or bondable and his fidelity insured. 

 
30.4 It had been noted that various AOs of COMELEC were not properly bonded 

and fidelity bonds of other AOs were not renewed prior to their expiration 
dates. Details of which are as follows: 

 
Table No. 52 – AOs not bonded 

Regions Remarks 

NCR Cash advances of 6 AOs were not covered with fidelity bond at the time their 
cash advances were granted. 

I The validity/effectivity of the bond of various AOs and its sufficiency in 
amount could not be ascertained due to inability of Management to provide 
the Confirmation Letters issued by the Bureau of Treasury.  

II The following numbers of AOs were not bonded at the time of cash 
examination due to the non-presentation of the copy of their fidelity bond. 
 38 from Isabela 
 17 from Nueva Vizcaya 
 6 from Quirino 
 19 from Cagayan 

III 4 AOs from Tarlac and 15 AOs from Nueva Ecija were not properly bonded 
due to expired/late renewal of bonds, and excessive or insufficient amount of 
bonds to cover maximum cash accountabilities. 

VII Copies of the renewed fidelity bonds were not presented during cash 
examination by most of the AOs, hence, there is no assurance that the bond 
was renewed on time.  

X The FSD failed to furnish all AOs from the region copies of approved fidelity 
bonds, hence the same were not verified 

XI Two AOs assigned in the 2nd and 3rd Districts of Davao City were not 
bonded. 

XVI 4 AOs from the province of Negros Occidental, Silay City, Ilog and 
Himamaylan City were not bonded. 

 

30.5 We recommended that Management: 
 

a. Ensure that all Election Officers and employees whose duties permit 
or require the possession or custody of government funds and 

properties are adequately and properly bonded in accordance with 

the above-cited regulations; and 

 

b. Direct the Finance Services Department to properly monitor the 
timely renewal of the fidelity bond of all accountable officers in 

accordance with Treasury Circular No. 02-2009 and COA Circular 

No. 97-002. 



91 
 

30.6 Management commented that the FSD created a team to monitor the status 
of the fidelity bonds of all AOs to ensure that all EOs and employees whose 
duties permit or require the possession or custody of government funds and 
properties are properly and adequately bonded. A monitoring tool is being 
prepared from the receipt of the requirements for application or renewal of 
fidelity bonds of AOs to check the completeness prior to the preparation of 
the disbursement voucher for the payment of the fidelity bonds to the BTr up 
to the receipt of the confirmation letter from the BTr. Details from this 
monitoring tool will be posted in the COMELEC internal website for the 
information of all AOs. Further, copy of the confirmation letters are being 
emailed to the Office of the Provincial Election Supervisors and Office of 
the Regional Election Directors for them to know the details of their fidelity 
bonds, particularly their validity/expiry dates for a two-way monitoring and 
in case of delay enjoin them to make a follow-up on the status of their 
registration/application or renewal. 

 
 
Improper maintenance of Cashbooks/Cash Receipts Record 
 

31. Cashbooks/Cash Receipts Records were not properly maintained/ 
accomplished by the 121 AOs of Regions II and IV-A, resulted in 

inaccuracies; thereby rendering it difficult to establish/reconcile the 

accountabilities of Election Officers/Accountable Officers at any given time.

  
31.1 Appendix No. 29 of the GAM, Volume II, pertains to Cash Receipts Record 

(CRR) which states that each Collecting Officer/Accountable Officer shall 
maintain this record to monitor his/her accountability. All transactions for 
the day shall be recorded immediately and a balance (undeposited 
collections) shall be extracted. 

 
31.2 It was noted that various AOs did not comply with the required proper 

maintenance/accomplishment of Cash Receipts Record, contrary to the 
above-mentioned regulations. Details as follows: 

 
Table No. 53 – AOs with improperly maintained cashbooks/cash receipts records 

Regions Remarks 

II Cashbook of 4 AOs from the provinces of Isabela and Quirino were not 
properly accomplished that resulted in unrecorded collections. 

IV-A Cash Receipts Registers were not properly maintained by 117 AOs. 
 

31.3 The failure of various Election Officers to properly maintain/accomplish 
their Cash Receipts Record rendered it difficult to establish/reconcile the 
accountabilities of the Election Officers/Accountable Officers concerned. 

 
31.4 We recommended that Management require the AOs concerned to 

maintain Cash Receipts Record or Cashbook and record their 

collections and deposits daily in accordance with Appendix 29 of the 



92 
 

GAM, Volume II, and regularly reconcile cashbook balance with the 

cash on hand. 

 

31.5 Management commented that they will reiterate the compliance of AOs to 
maintain CRR or Cashbook and record their collections and deposits daily 
and regularly reconcile cashbook balance with the cash on hand. Operations 
Manual for Collections and Deposits prepared by the FSD has been 
distributed to all AOs for their guidance and appropriate action wherein the 
maintenance of Cash Receipts Records to record their collections was 
included. 

 
 
Improperly maintained and unsubmitted Reports of Collections and Deposits and 
Report of Accountability for Accountable Forms 
 

32. Report of Collections and Deposits (RCD) and Report of Accountability for 
Accountable Forms (RAAF) were not properly accomplished and not 

regularly submitted by 220 AOs from Regions IV-A, IV-B, XII and XIII, 

thus, cash and property accountabilities of AOs could not be easily 

established/determined. 

 

32.1 Section 39, Chapter 5 of GAM, Volume I, Reporting of Collections and 
Deposits. Receipts and deposits shall be reported as follows:  

 
a. At the close of the business day, the Collecting Officers shall prepare the 

RCDs (Appendix 26) for submission to Accounting Office/Unit. The 
report lists all the ORs issued in numerical sequence including cancelled 
ones.  

 
b. The RCD shall be supported by documentary evidence such as duplicate 

copies of ORs and validated deposit slips.  
 

32.2 Item K, Section 17, Chapter 8 of GAM Volume I also provides that RAAF 
shall be prepared by the Accountable Officer to report on the movement and 
status of accountable forms in his/her possession. The accountable forms 
include those with or without face value. 

 

32.3 It was noted that various AOs of COMELEC did not prepare and submit 
regularly the required RCD and RAAF, contrary to the above-mentioned 
regulations. Details are shown in Table No. 54. 

 
Table No. 54 – AOs with improperly maintained RCDs and RAAF 

Regions Remarks 

IV-A RCDs were not properly prepared by 120 AOs, while RAAFs were not 
properly accomplished by 33 AOs. 

IV-B RCDs of four offices from the region were not promptly submitted within the 
prescribed period and delayed for a maximum of more than 2 years. 

XII Submission of RCDs and RAAFs of 53 offices were delayed ranging from 



93 
 

Table No. 54 – AOs with improperly maintained RCDs and RAAF 

Regions Remarks 

two days to more than 11 months delay. 
XIII RAAFs submitted by 43 AOs contained some errors. 

 
32.4 The continued failure of the AOs to prepare and submit the RCD and RAAF 

regularly, rendered monitoring and verification of accountabilities difficult 
and could not be readily established at any given time. 
 

32.5 We recommended that Management require all AOs to exert effort to 
submit their monthly RCD and RAAF, in compliance with Section 39, 

Chapter 5 and Section 17, Chapter 8 of the GAM, Volume I and furnish 

the Audit Teams with the copy of the reports to facilitate the audit of 

collections and deposits. 

 
32.6 The Management commented that they will reiterate the compliance of AOs 

to exert effort to submit their monthly RCD and RAAF and furnish the 
Audit Teams with the copy of the reports to facilitate the audit of collections 
and deposits. 

 
 
Non-preparation of Reconciliation Statement of Accountability 
 

33. Reconciliation Statement of Accountability of nine Accountable Officers from 
the field office in Region VIII was not prepared due to the absence of 

updated/complete Subsidiary Ledgers originating from the Accounting 

Division, COMELEC Main Office, thus, casting doubt on the accuracy of the 

reported balances of the Cash-Collecting Officers account. 
 

33.1 Section 114 of the PD 1445 provides that: 
 

2. The Government accounting system shall be on double entry basis with 
general ledger in which all financial transactions are recorded. 

 
3. Subsidiary records shall be kept where necessary. 

 

33.2 The Audit Teams noted that reconciliation statement of accountability of 
nine Accountable Officers of Region VIII were not prepared due to the 
absence of updated/complete Subsidiary Ledgers, hence the reconciliation of 
Statement of Accountability of the AOs against the ledgers/books of 
accounts could not be made. 

 

33.3 Failure to reconcile records between the Field Offices and the Accounting 
Office reflects a poor internal control and accounting system, rendering the 
accountability of AOs and reliability on the records, uncertain. 

 



94 
 

33.4 We recommended that Management require the AOs of Region VIII to 
confirm the balances of their accounts with the Accounting Division, to 

ensure that posting of collections and deposits made to their respective 

SLs are updated and accounting errors are detected and adjusted. 

 

33.5 Management commented that they will require the AOs of Region VIII to 
confirm the balances of their accounts with the Accounting Division, to 
ensure that posting of collections and deposits made to their respective SLs 
are updated and accounting errors are detected and adjusted. 

 
 
No proper turn-over of accountability 
 

34. The Accountability of reshuffled Election Officers (EOs) who are at the same 
time AOs of COMELEC Regions VII and X, could not be established due to 

the absence of proper turnover between the incoming and outgoing EOs and 

the non-submission of the report of accountability by the EOs who retired or 

ceased to act in their official capacity as such. 

 

34.1 Section 77 of PD 1445 provides that, when government funds and property 
are transferred from one accountable officer to another, or from an 
outgoing officer to his successor, it shall be done upon properly itemized 
invoice and receipt which shall invariably support the clearance to be issued 
to the relieved or outgoing officers, subject to regulations of the 
Commission. 

 
34.2 Section 80 thereof also provides that, when an accountable officer ceased to 

act in his official capacity as such, he has to submit his report or 
accountability to the auditor concerned. 

 
34.3 The Audit Teams noted that the accountability of reshuffled EOs who are at 

the same time AOs of COMELEC Regions VII and X, cannot be established 
due to the absence of proper turnover between the incoming and outgoing 
EOs and the non-submission of the report of accountability by the AOs who 
retired or ceased to act in official capacity as such. Details are shown in 
Table No. 55. 
 

Table No. 55 – AOs with no proper turn-over of accountability 

Regions Remarks 

VII AOs were reshuffled and there was no official turnover of accountabilities 
made between the outgoing and incoming EOs. 

X Accountable Form No. 51-C serial numbers 4879677; 4730690-700; 
5013435-550 and 4594728-755 were not properly turned over. 

 

34.4 We recommended and Management agreed to revisit/create policies to 
enhance compliance on proper turnover of accountabilities between the 

outgoing and incoming EOs or when an Official retires or ceased to act 



95 
 

in his official capacity as such, and his report of accountability be 

submitted to the Audit Team, in compliance with Sections 77 and 80 of 

PD 1445. 

 

 

OTHER NON-COMPLIANCE ISSUES 

 
Gender and Development Plan and Budget and Accomplishment Report for CY 2020 
 
35. The activities and the related disbursements pertaining to the Annual Gender 

and Development (GAD) Plan and Budget (GPB) of the COMELEC for  

CY 2020 could not be validated and verified due to the non-submission of the 

Commission’s approved GAD Plan and Budget and the related 

Accomplishment Report.  

 

35.1 Section 31 of the General Provisions of the RA 11465, otherwise known as 
the GAA for FY 2020, provides that, all agencies of the government shall 
formulate a Gender and Development (GAD) Plan designed to address 
gender issues within their concerned sectors or mandate and implement the 
applicable provisions under R.A. No. 9710 or the Magna Carta of Women, 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against 
Women, the Beijing Platform for Action, the Philippine Plan for Gender-
Responsive Development (1995-2025), and the Philippine Development Plan 
(2017-2022). 

 
35.2 The GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of the agencies, 

which shall be at least five percent of their budgets. For this purpose, 
activities currently being undertaken by agencies which relate to GAD or 
those that contribute to poverty alleviation, economic empowerment 
especially of marginalized women, protection, promotion and fulfillment of 
women’s human rights, and practice of gender-responsive governance are 
considered sufficient compliance with said requirement. Utilization of the 
GAD budget shall be evaluated based on the GAD performance indicators 
identified by said agencies. 

 
35.3 Item V of COA Circular No. 2014-001 dated March 18, 2014 requires that 

copy of the PCW approved Annual GPB be furnished to the COA Audit 
Team within five working days from its receipt and copy of its 
Accomplishment Report within five working days from the end of January 
of the preceding year. 

 
35.4 In connection with the preparation of the Annual Audit Report of the 

COMELEC for CY 2020, a letter-request addressed to the Honorable 
Chairman and concerned Department Heads for the submission of various 
reports and documents, including the Approved GAD Plan and Budget 
(GPB) and GAD Accomplishment Report for CY 2020 was issued.  



96 
 

35.5 Subsequently, a follow-up letter was made on April 16, 2021 via email, for 
the submission of the above-mentioned reports/documents, however, the 
Approved GPB and GAD Accomplishment Report for CY 2020, remain 
unsubmitted to date. 

 
35.6 The non-submission of the required reports precluded the Audit Team to 

review, evaluate and verify the implementation and disbursements of GAD 
programmed activities, as well as its alignment to the agency’s mandate. 

 

35.7 We recommended that Management require the GAD Focal System-
Technical Working Group to immediately submit to the Audit Team the 

GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) and the related Accomplishment Report 

as required under Item V of COA Circular No. 2014-001.

advance payment, 
contrary to Section 4.2, 
Annex D of the 2016 
Revised Implementing 
Rules and Regulations 
(IRR) of RA 9184, as a 
result, advance payment 
and deposit amounting to 
₱8,219,279.78 remained 
unrefunded as of 
September 14, 2019. 
Moreover, expanded tax 
was withheld from the 
advance payment and 
deposit that resulted in 
over deduction and over 
remittance of tax 
amounting to 
₱432,593.57. 
 
We recommended and 

Management agreed to: 

 

a. Require the FSD 
to demand from 

Metropac Movers, 

Inc. the immediate 

refund of advance 

payment amounting 

to ₱8,219,279.78; 

 

 

 

b. Direct the Bids

2020, MetroPac is 
willing to return the

for the extended term.  
However, this request 
for offsetting of the 
extended period of 
lease beyond the 
original term of six 
months, is still under 
being studied by the 
Management.

We recommended and 

Management agreed to: 

 

a. Require the 
concerned officials 

to refund the 

transportation 

allowance granted to 

them in the period 

they were provided 

with service vehicles 

amounting to 

₱443,000.00,

the refund; 

 

b. Require the ASD 
to update the list of 

COMELEC Officials 

provided with 

government service 

vehicles and submit 

the same to the PD

and Item C, Section 5 of 
RA No. 8291, thus, 
resulted in loss/wastage 
of funds which should 
have been used for other 
purposes beneficial to the 
agency. 
 
We recommended and 

Management agreed to 

require the Personnel 

Department to 

determine the 

officials/employees, who 

neglected to remit the 

contributions on or 

before the due date, be 

liable for the interest on 

penalty; and justify 

why the payments made 

should not be 

disallowed in audit. 

Henceforth, require the 

remittance of monthly 

contributions in 

accordance with the 

prescribed period 

provided in the above 

cited regulations to 

avoid delay. 

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Management will be 
cautious on the strict 
observance of the 
timelines of all the 
remittances due to 
other government 
offices.

Management found 
out that the interest 
incurred resulted 
mainly due to the

of new policy by

implementation of 
the third tranche of 
compensation 
adjustment.
