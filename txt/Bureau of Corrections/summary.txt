EXECUTIVE SUMMARY





A)		Introduction

	

Agency Profile



The Bureau of Prisons was established by virtue of Reorganization Act No. 1407 on November 1, 1905 of the Philippine Commission to take charge of the safekeeping of all prisoners confined at insular and provisional prisons and of all penal settlements, or committed to the custody of the Bureau.  Under this Act, the Old Bilibid Prison, the San Ramon Prison and Penal Farm and the Iwahig Penal Colony were integrated into one office until it was transferred to the Department of Justice (DOJ).  



On November 23, 1989, pursuant to Section 26 of the Administrative Code of 1987, the President of the Philippines, issued Proclamation No. 495 to change the name of the Bureau of Prisons to Bureau of Corrections (BuCor) headed by a Director General.  On May 24, 2013, then President Benigno Simeon C. Aquino III signed into law the Republic Act (R.A.) No.10575, otherwise known as the Bureau of Corrections Act of 2013 which provides for the modernization, professionalization and restructuring of the bureau.



The BuCor’s correctional jurisdiction was also expanded.  From the original three offices integrated as one, it is now operating with seven units located nationwide, headed by a Superintendent for each colony, namely:



--	The New Bilibid Prison (NBP) in Muntinlupa City;

--	The Correctional Institution for Women (CIW) in Mandaluyong City;

--	Iwahig Prison and Penal Farm (IPPF) in Puerto Princesa City, Palawan;

--	Sablayan Prison and Penal Farm (SPPF) in Occidental Mindoro;

--	San Ramon Prison and Penal Farm (SRPPF) in Zamboanga City;

--	Leyte Regional Prison (LRP) in Abuyog, Leyte; and

--	Davao Prison and Penal Farm (DPPF) in Panabo City, Davao Del Norte.



The staff officers head the following divisions:



--	Office of the Director for Corrections

--	Planning and Management

--	Administration

--	Finance

--	Assessment, rehabilitation Program Development and Monitoring

--	Rehabilitation Operations

--	NBP Hospital (NBPH)



The BuCor Director General has control and supervision over the prisons and penal farms, assisted by three Deputy Director Generals, namely, one for Administration, one for security and operations, and one for reformation, all of them are appointed by the President upon recommendation of the Secretary of DOJ.  It has 3,593 corrections officers, 544 corrections technical officers and 296 civilian personnel or a total of 4,430 personnel as of December 31, 2020.

C)		Scope of Audit



Financial and compliance audits were conducted on the accounts and operations of BuCor for CY 2020.  Review and analysis were made on balances of assets, liabilities and equity accounts, while tests of transactions were applied on income and expenditures as reflected in the financial statements as of December 31, 2020. The audit of infrastructure projects was limited to legal and auditorial review and the technical aspects of the project was referred to the Technical Services Office.

	

D)		INDEPENDENT Auditor’s Report 

	

The auditor rendered an qualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the financial statements of the BuCor as at December 31, 2020 due to accounting errors amounting to ₱353,126,625.92 which exceeded the materiality level of ₱20,536,165.91 as shown in Annex A of this report.



E)		SUMMARY OF AUDIT OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



1)		Planned recruitment of uniformed personnel was not efficiently pursued due to low turnout of applicants resulting in an unobligated/unutilized allotment of ₱639,211,560.47 or 10.93 percent of the total allotments of ₱5,849,663,746.88 and reversal of unutilized funds amounting to ₱367,027,026.88 or 8.32 percent of total allocation of ₱4,409,133,865.00; thus, not in keeping with sound cash programming.  (Audit Observation No. 1)



We recommended that Management: (a) maximize utilization of allotments thru proper planning and timely implementation of planned programs during the year; (b) intensify the recruitment of personnel pursuant to the Bucor Act of 2013; and (c) revisit its Monthly Cash Program-Budget Execution Documents (MCP-BED) 3 and expenditure strategies to ensure that allocated funds are spent and utilized as programmed.  



2)		The Inventory account balance of ₱425,821,778.16 as of December 31, 2020 was misstated due to: (a) erroneous recording of delivered items; (b) unrecorded deliveries and issued semi-expendable properties; and (c) misclassification of various semi-expendable properties; hence, adversely affecting the fair presentation of the financial statements.  (Audit Observation No. 2)



We recommended that Management instruct the Acting Chief, Accounting Division (AD) to: (a) set deadlines for submission of all reports/documents that require recording in the books of accounts to avoid non-recording and/or late recording of transactions; (b) recognize expenses for semi-expendable properties upon receipt of the copy of Inventory Custodian Slip (ICS) from Supply Division; and (c) prepare all necessary journal entries to correct the balance of affected accounts.

	

3)	Gaps in receiving and accounting of various donations in kind and non- submission of Deed of Donations/Letter of Intent to the AD resulted in the understatement of Donations in Kind and corresponding Inventory/PPE accounts.  (Audit Observation No. 3)

	

	We recommended that Management: (a) revisit/amend the Guidelines on Receipt of Donations to include provisions on standard procedures, accounting and valuation of donated items, responsibilities and accountabilities of all concerned offices; (b) enforce strict compliance with the Guidelines on Receipt of Donations;  (c) instruct all Divisions/Units/Offices that directly received donations from donors during CY 2020 to submit to Supply Division all pertinent documents on donated goods, property and equipment; (d) require the Supply Division to furnish the Accounting Division with copy of documents pertaining to donations for proper recording in the books of accounts; and submit to the Office of the Director General a monthly report on all donations received, copy furnished the Office of the Auditor; and (e) require the Accounting Division to prepare Journal Entry Voucher for donated goods and equipment in CY 2020.

	

4)		The balance of PPE accounts aggregating ₱833,147,901.90 as at year-end was misstated due to: (a) unrecorded and erroneous recording of PPE transactions; (b) misclassification of accounts; (c) non-provision and erroneous computation of depreciation; and (d) discrepancy between Accounting and Property records; hence, adversely affecting fair presentation of accounts in the financial statements.  Further, the required Supply and Accounting records were not maintained in BuCor-Main and three Colonies; physical inventory count was not conducted in SPPF and various PPEs were not presented during physical inventory count at the BuCor-Main and CIW, contrary to existing regulations.  (Audit Observation No. 4)

	

	We recommended that Management: (a) appraise the value of unrecorded building and structures and to exert all efforts to locate and submit necessary documents on the six unrecorded properties situated inside the New Bilibid Prison Reservation Compound; (b) require the AD to: (1) strictly adhere to the provisions in the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for recognition, derecognition and depreciation of PPE; (2) compute the accurate and correct depreciation of the affected PPE accounts; and (3) prepare all necessary adjusting entries to correct the affected accounts; (c) require the Supply Division to: (1) maintain all required records; and (2) conduct physical count and regularly reconcile their records with AD records; d) require the end-user to present the equipment during inventory taking; and e) instruct the Civil Engineering Section, General Services Division (GSD), to submit status/progress/inspection reports on the repair of New Bilibid Prison Hospital (NBPH) Annex Building and NBPH Ward 4 and Certificate of Acceptance of all completed projects to the Supply and Accounting Division.

	

5)		In BuCor-Main, the reliability of Target Range Fees remitted to the Chief Cashier amounting to ₱335,290.00 for CYs 2019 and 2020 cannot be established due to absence of policy/guidelines for the operation of the Firing Range and non-issuance of official receipt by the Collecting Officer assigned at the Firing Range which indicate weakness of internal control that may result to possible loss of revenue to the Bureau.  (Audit Observation No. 5)



We recommended and Management agreed to: (a) develop a system/manual incorporating the operating procedures, policies and guidelines for the Firing Range Operation; (b) require the current Collecting Officer at the Firing Range to remit collected Target Range Fees daily to the Cashier; issue Official Receipt for fees collected; and apply for fidelity bond with the Bureau of the Treasury; and (c) require the Chief, Firing Range to submit to the Audit Team Monthly Target Range Remittance Report and all the necessary supporting documents.



6)		The approval by the Superintendent of IPPF on the adjustment of production share of the BuCor as stipulated in the Joint Venture Agreement (JVA) cannot be considered binding and contrary to Section 23 of the JVA which resulted in the reduction of production share by ₱1,338,528.50 for the period April to December 2020.  (Audit Observation No. 6)  

	

	We recommended that the Superintendent of the IPPF: (a) secure the approval of the Director General, BuCor, on the request of Puerto Princesa City Water District, otherwise, demand the payment of unpaid production share of ₱1,338,528.50; and (b) instruct the concerned IPPF personnel to meticulously review the Monthly Production Report to ensure that the minimum daily production share of ₱8,000.00 was collected, until Section 3 of the Joint Venture Agreement (JVA) is duly amended. 

	

7)		In DPPF and SPPF, disbursement vouchers (DVs) were processed and paid even without complete documentation, contrary to Section 4.6 of PD 1445 and COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012; thus, propriety and validity of these transactions were doubtful.  (Audit Observation No. 7)  

	

	We recommended and Management agreed to require the a) Accounting Section and the Bids and Awards Committee of DPPF to ensure completeness of supporting documents prior to the processing of claim for catering services; b) strengthen the review process of all transactions on procurement to ensure completeness of documentary requirements to avoid suspension and/or disallowance in audit; and c) Accounting Section to submit the lacking documents and stop processing transactions with incomplete documentation.

	

8)		The contracts for the Supply and Delivery of Food Subsistence of Persons Deprived of Liberty (PDLs) at the New Bilibid Prison (NBP) and CIW of BuCor with AFS Eatery and Mang Kiko Catering Services, Inc., were extended for more than six months, despite violation of several conditions in Section 4, Annex A of Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB) Resolution No. 23-2007 dated September 28, 2007; thus, depriving the BuCor of a more suitable/beneficial contract terms and cost. (Audit Observation No. 8)

	

	We recommended that Management: (a) submit explanation why: (i) bidding was not conducted before the extended contract for supply and delivery of food subsistence expires on March 31, 2020; and (ii) contract with AFS Eatery was extended despite not meeting all conditions prescribed in the Revised Guidelines on the Extension of Contracts for General Support Services;  (b) immediately conduct bidding for supply and delivery of food subsistence of Persons Deprived of Liberty in NBP and CIW for CY 2021, otherwise, disbursements for food supply expenses without valid contracts shall be disallowed in audit; and (c) strictly adhere to the rules and regulations on procurement of goods and services prescribed in R.A. No 9184.

	

9)		Various management practices in the transfer of property accountability and supervision of unserviceable properties were contrary to Sections 40 and 42, Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM; hence, an indication of weakness on asset management.  (Audit Observation No. 9)

	

	We recommended that Management: (a) create an Inventory Committee as required in COA Circular No. 2020-006 to cleanse PPE accounts; (b) instruct the Supply Division to issue memorandum to all AOs listed in Annex H to produce/present the PPE under their accountability; otherwise, payment for lost PPE will be enforced; (c) instruct the AOs to return unserviceable property to Supply Division for immediate and proper disposal; (d) prepare the Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) and course the immediate disposal of the unserviceable properties; (e) instruct the reassigned AOs to transfer their property accountabilities to their successor for proper issuance of Property Transfer Report (PTR); (f)	instruct the signatories in the Clearance Form to be vigilant and cautious in signing/issuance of clearance to reassigned personnel; and (g) require the Supply Division to update their records regularly.

	

10)	Prolonged suspension by BuCor of the Build and Design of Regional Prison Facility project at SPPF with contract cost of ₱288,878,759.61 caused the non-completion of the prison facility and termination of the contract; hence, depriving the intended users of the project of the benefits and comforts.  Moreover, payment of the 15 percent mobilization fee amounting to ₱43,331,813.94 was not supported with all the required documents, contrary to Section 47 of the GAM and Paragraph 4.2 of Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations of RA 9184.  Further, due to neglect and long exposure to sun and rain, the reported 20.38 percent project accomplishment was damaged; thus, may result to wastage of government funds.  (Audit Observation No. 10)

	

	We recommended that Management require the A. G. Araja Construction and Development Corporation (AGACDC) to submit all the documentary requirements pursuant to Section 9.1 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012; and resolve the dispute with AGACDC.

	

		The foregoing observations and recommendations were brought to the attention of concerned officials of the agency in our letter dated May 10, 2021.  Management’s views and reactions were incorporated in this report, where appropriate.
