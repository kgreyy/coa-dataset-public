PART II – OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



I)			FINANCIAL AUDIT

		

		Fund Utilization

			

1)	Planned recruitment of uniformed personnel was not efficiently pursued due to low turnout of applicants resulting in an unobligated/unutilized allotment of ₱639,211,560.47 or 10.93 percent of the total allotments of ₱5,849,663,746.88 and reversal of unutilized funds amounting to ₱367,027,026.88 or 8.32 percent of total allocation of ₱4,409,133,865.00; thus, not in keeping with sound cash programming.

    

	1)	Paragraph 3.10 of Department of Budget and Management (DBM) National Budget Circular (NBC) No. 578 dated January 6, 2020 states that: As a general rule, departments, bureaus and offices of the National Government, including Constitutional Offices enjoying fiscal autonomy and SUCs shall spend what is programmed in their respective appropriations in the FY 2020 GAA.



	2)	While Section 2.0 of DBM Circular No. 2011-15 dated December 26, 2011 states that: xxx.  Agencies shall ensure optimum utilization of their available NCA releases within the schedules program/project/activity implementation period as reflected in their submitted Monthly Cash Program.



	3)	Section 10 of the RIRR of RA 10575 states that: The BuCor shall maintain the custodial personnel-to-inmate ratio of 1:7 for three (3) shifts and reformation personnel-to-inmate ratio of 1:24 for one (1) shift.  X x x.



Hence, it is authorized to increase its manpower to meet such ratio and may continue to increase personnel per percentage rate increase of committed inmates annually or as the need arises particularly in the Administrative personnel requirements which shall be a ratio of 1:14.58, Engineering personnel ratio of 1:58.33, Directorate for Reception and Diagnostics and Directorate for External Relations combined personnel ratio of 1:116.7. 



	4)	For CY 2020, the BuCor has a total appropriations of ₱5,454,097,244.88, broken down by allotment class below:

	6)	The allotted fund for unfilled position was intended for salaries of uniformed personnel programmed for hiring in CY 2020.  Out of programmed creation of additional 1,500 Corrections Officer (CorO) 1 positions, only 803 positions or 53.53 percent were filled up in CY 2020 which brings the ratio of CorO to Persons Deprived of Liberty (PDL) and Corrections Technical Officer (CTO) to PDL as of December 31, 2020, as follows:

	7)	Six years after implementation of RA 10575, also known as: The Bureau of Correction Act of 2013” that provides for modernization, professionalization and restructuring of BuCor by upgrading its facilities, increasing the number of its personnel and upgrading the level of qualifications of personnel, among others, the Bureau was still not able to implement Section 10 of its RIRR as shown by the table above.



	8)	The additional CO1 positions created in CY 2020 were not fully filled up because of low turnout of applicants and some applicants are not equipped with the required qualifications.  



	9)	The inability of BuCor to fully utilize allotment received, did not conform with the objective of efficient spending as required in the abovementioned DBM Budget Circulars. Moreover, unobligated allotment of ₱569,365,048.61 may have an impact in the overall cash program of the government if utilized for other priority projects.



	10)	Further, review of allocations and utilization of funds for CY 2020, disclosed that BuCor received NCAs totaling ₱4,409,133,865.00.  Out of NCAs received, ₱4,042,106,838.12 was utilized while the amount of ₱367,027,026.88 was reverted back to the BTr, details as follows:

	11)	Failure to maximize utilization of NCAs is contrary to the provisions of Section 3 of RA 11465, GAA FY 2020 and NBC Circular No. 578 dated January 6, 2020 which indicates poor cash programing and expenditure planning; thus, may affect performance and accomplishments of its mandate.



	12)	We recommended that Management:



a)	maximize utilization of allotments thru proper planning and timely implementation of planned programs during the year; 



b)	intensify the recruitment of personnel pursuant to the BuCor Act of 2013; and



c)	revisit its MCP-BED 3 and expenditure strategies to ensure that allocated funds are spent and utilized as programmed.



Misstated balances of Inventory accounts



2)	The Inventory account balance of ₱425,821,778.16 as of December 31, 2020 was misstated due to: a) erroneous recording of delivered items; b) unrecorded deliveries and issued semi-expendable properties; and c) misclassification of various semi-expendable properties; hence, adversely affecting the fair presentation of the financial statements.  

	

	1)		Chapter 8, Volume I of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs) provides:



	Sec. 10. Semi-expendable Property. Tangible items below the capitalization threshold of ₱15,000 shall be accounted as semi-expendable property. The following policies apply as follows: 

	

a)		Semi-expendable property which are recognized as PPE shall be reclassified to the affected accounts. 

	

b)		These tangible items shall be recognized as expenses upon issue to the end-user.

	

	Sec. 11. Accountability over Semi-expendable Property. Inventory Custodian Slip (ICS) (Appendix 59) shall be issued to end-user of Semi-expendable Property to establish accountability over them. Accountability shall be extinguished upon return of the item to the Property and Supply Division/Unit or in case of loss, upon approval of the relief from property accountability.

	10)		Further verification revealed that the non-recognition of Inventory and Liability on the above deliveries was due to failure of Supply Division to submit IARs and its supporting documents to Accounting Division, contrary to Section 15, Sequence 5-8, of the GAM.

	

	11)		It was also noted that Accounting Division records delivered drugs and medicines based on disbursement vouchers and not on submitted IARs, contrary Section 15, Chapter 8, Volume 1 of the GAM. 

	

	b.2	Non-recognition of expenses on issued Semi-Expendable Properties totaling ₱3,259,254.00

	

	12)		Physical count of inventories on hand at year-end disclosed that semi-expendable properties has zero balance; hence, no Report of Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) for semi-expendable properties was prepared and submitted to the Audit Team.

	

	13)		Analysis of Semi-Expendable Properties accounts disclosed that issuance of semi-expendable properties was recognized in the books at the end of its estimated life or after one year from date of acquisition contrary to Section 10.b, Chapter 8 of the GAM which resulted in the overstatement of Inventory and the understatement of Expenses both by ₱3,259,254.00.

	

	b.3	Unrecorded consumptions/issuances amounting to ₱7,771,211.72



	14)		Moreover, review of Report of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI) prepared at the New Bilibid Prison Hospital (NBPH) in CY 2020 disclosed that RSMIs for drugs and medicines, medical, dental and laboratory supplies for the month of December 2020 amounting ₱7,669,724.93 (Annex C) and ₱101,486.79 (Annex D), respectively, were submitted by the Superintendent of NBPH only on February 9, 2021.  The late submission of RSMI caused the non-recording of consumed/issued medicines in the books of accounts; which overstates the Drugs and Medicine Inventory and Medical, Dental and Laboratory Supply Inventory; and understates the Drugs and Medicine Expenses and Medical, Dental and Laboratory Supplies Expenses.

	

c)	Misclassification of various Semi-Expendable Properties amounting to ₱2,542,037.00



	15)		Review of JEVs disclosed that inspected and accepted semi-expendable items amounting to ₱2,542,037.00 were not classified to its proper account, while  various supplies and materials were recorded as outright expenses.  Details in Annex E and summarized below:

a)		set deadlines for submission of all reports/documents that require recording in the books of accounts to avoid non-recording and/or late recording of transactions; 

	

b)		recognize expenses for semi-expendable properties upon receipt of the copy of Inventory Custodian Slip (ICS) from Supply Division; and



c)		prepare all necessary journal entries to correct the balance of affected accounts.

	

	Management Comment

	

	18)		Acting Chief, Accounting Division of BuCor-Main commented that they already prepared necessary JEVs to correct misclassified semi-expendable PPE and erroneous adjustment made in Drugs and Medicines Inventory account.  He also assured the Audit Team that they will strictly comply with the recommendations.

	

	Auditor’s Rejoinder

	

	19)		Drawn JEVs corrected only erroneous adjustment made and misclassification of accounts as discussed in pars. 2.7 and 2.15, respectively, of this report.  JEVs to adjust/correct misstatements in other affected accounts as detailed in par.  2.16 are not yet prepared.

	

	Unrecorded Donations in Kind received from various stakeholders



3)	Gaps in receiving and accounting of various donations in kind and non- submission of Deed of Donations/Letter of Intent to the Accounting Division resulted in the understatement of Donations in Kind and corresponding Inventory/PPE accounts. 



	1)	Section 26, Chapter 5, Volume I of the GAM prescribed the: Recognition and Measurement of Gifts, Donations and Goods In-kind



a)	X x x



b)	Goods in-kind are tangible assets transferred to an entity in a non-exchange transaction, without charge, but may be subject to stipulations. External assistance provided by multilateral or bilateral development organizations often includes a component of goods in-kind. (Par. 94, PPSAS 23)



c)	Goods in-kind are recognized as assets when the goods are received, or there is a binding arrangement to receive the goods. If goods in-kind are received without conditions attached, revenue is recognized immediately. If conditions are attached, a liability is recognized, which is reduced and revenue recognized as the conditions are satisfied. (Par. 96, PPSAS 23)



d)	On initial recognition, gifts and donations including goods in-kind are measured at their fair value as at the date of acquisition, which may be ascertained by reference to an active market, or by appraisal. X x x”



	2)	Chapter 10 of the same manual, provides the following: 



Sec. 11. Non-exchange Transaction. PPE acquired through a non-exchange transaction, such as donation, presidential proclamation, taxes, transfers and grants, its cost shall be measured at its fair value as at the date of acquisition. However, this does not constitute revaluation. If the fair value cannot be determined, the asset shall be recorded at a nominal value (the value that is stated on currency or face value).

Sec. 12. Donation without Condition. Cost of PPE acquired through donation without condition shall be taken up at its fair value at the date it is acquired. All expenses incurred in connection with the donated asset, such as delivery and installation costs, shall be included in the amount recognized as asset. The fair value of the PPE shall be recognized as “Income from Grants and Donations in Kind.”



Sec. 20. Recording of Deliveries. Deliveries of PPE shall be recorded immediately in the Property Card (Appendix 69) maintained by the Supply and/or Property Division/Unit on the basis of the IAR and other supporting documents. The IAR and other supporting documents shall be forwarded to the Accounting Division/Unit for the recording of deliveries in the books of accounts through JEV and in the Property, Plant and Equipment Ledger Card (PPELC) (Appendix 70).  X x x”



	3)	On April 2, 2019, then Director General Nicanor E. Faeldon issued an unnumbered Memorandum prescribing the Guidelines on the Receipt of Donations (GRD), wherein the following were stipulated:



a)	The donations in kind must be officially acknowledged by the Chief, Supply Division (SD) from the donor(s);



b)	The Chief, SD shall be informed in writing the details of the donated items;



c)	In case of highly perishable items, the Chief, SD shall inform as soon as possible the Director General or the Superintendent for swift distribution to avoid spoilage;



d)	In case of semi-perishable and expendable items, the Chief, SD shall render a written report to the Director General recommending the distribution of the items, if not specified by the donor; and



e)	In case of equipment, fixtures or structures, the Chief, SD in coordination with the Chief Superintendent, shall recommend to the Director General the equitable distribution of the items, if not specified by the donor.  Received item shall be properly tagged and corresponding Property Acknowledgement Receipt (PAR) and/or ICS be issued.



	4)	On June 26, 2019, Special Order (SO) No. 449 s. 2019 was issued by then Director General creating the Bureau of Corrections Acceptance Committee (BCAC) composed of a Chairman, Vice Chairman, Secretariat and five members.  They were tasked to receive and account for all donations and conduct proper inventory.  It was amended by SO No. 526 s 2019 dated July 18, 2019 to include provision that, the Committee shall recommend to the Director General the approval of the said donation.



	5)	In CY 2020, the Audit Team received requests for inspection of donations to BuCor from various stakeholders.  Some of them were even posted in its social media account.  However, donations received were not recorded in the books of accounts.  The General Ledger (GL) for Donations in Kind account showed a zero balance at year-end; thus, not presented in the financial statements as of December 31, 2020.



	6)	Review of the Deed of Donations and Letter of Intent (LOI) on file disclosed that the Bureau received the following donated items/goods in CY 2020:

	7)	The table above pertains to donations coursed through or received by the Supply Division (SD).  We noted that distribution of donated goods was supported with distribution list duly approved by the Director General, if recipient/beneficiary was not indicated in the Deed of Donation. On the other hand, donated equipment was issued to end-user covered by PAR/ICS.  



	8)	Interview with the Supply Division Staff disclosed that several donated items were directly delivered/issued to intended users/office without informing/coordinating with SD, even after issuance of memorandum on the guidelines on receipt of donations. 



	9)	Validation on compliance of SD with prescribed processes and procedures in accepting donations in kind revealed the following: 



a)	Donors were required to execute a Deed of Donation or Letter of Intent (LOI); 

b)	Value of the items was not indicated in the Deed of Donations, except for donations of DOH and UNDP; 

c)	Audit Team was notified and requested to inspect the donated items; 

d)	IARs were prepared and deed of donation or LOI were submitted to the Office of the DG for approval; and

e)	Necessary RIS, Property Tag, PAR/ICS were prepared.



	10)	However, SD failed to submit the Deed of Donations and/or the LOI and its supporting documents to the Accounting Division (AD) because the Guidelines on the Receipt of Donations has no provision requiring submission of documents to the AD. 



	11)	Interview with Accounting personnel disclosed that donations received during the year were not recorded in the books due to non-submission of documents to the AD.  Moreover, personnel-in-charge in the accounting for donation commented that his responsibility as member of the Bureau of Corrections Acceptance Committee (BCAC) ceased when he was transferred to another Colony in July 2019.  Upon return to the AD in November 2019, the task assigned to him by the new OIC of the AD does not include accounting for donations.  Also, no Special Order was issued by the new administration to amend the composition of the committee.



	12)	It was very clear in Special Order No. 449 s. 2019 that the tasks of the BCAC include receiving, accounting and conducting proper inventory of donations.  Since the order includes accounting of donations, the list or inventory of donated items should be submitted to AD for proper recording in the books. Absence of said list or inventory, donated items cannot be fully accounted for. The comments of the Chief of SD, who is the BCAC Vice Chairman, that there was no provision in the guidelines on submission of documents to AD is therefore not acceptable.  The Accounting staff, who was also a member of BCAC, should have been responsible for reminding the BCAC or seeing to it that the list or inventory is submitted to Accounting Division for proper recording as part of his responsibility. 



	13)	Had the Supply Division submitted the donation documents to Accounting Division and the latter had taken the initiative to ask for the submission of documents for recording in the books of account, the Donations in Kind account could have been presented fairly in the financial statements.   



	14)	We recommended that Management:



a)		revisit/amend the Guidelines on Receipt of Donations to include provisions on standard procedures, accounting and valuation of donated items, responsibilities and accountabilities of all concerned offices;

	 

b)		enforce strict compliance with the Guidelines on Receipt of Donations;  



c)		instruct all Divisions/Units/Offices that directly received donations from donors during CY 2020 to submit to Supply Division all pertinent documents on donated goods, property and equipment;



d)		require the Supply Division to furnish the Accounting Division with copy of documents pertaining to donations for proper recording in the books of accounts; and submit to the Office of the Director General a monthly report on all donations received, copy furnished the Office of the Auditor; and



e)		require the Accounting Division to prepare Journal Entry Voucher for donated goods and equipment in CY 2020.

	

	Misstated Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) account balances

	

4)	The balance of PPE accounts aggregating ₱833,147,901.90 as at year-end was misstated due to: (a) unrecorded and erroneous recording of PPE transactions; (b) misclassification of accounts; (c) non-provision and erroneous computation of depreciation; and (d) discrepancy between Accounting and Property records; hence, adversely affecting fair presentation of accounts in the financial statements.  Further, the required Supply and Accounting records were not maintained in BuCor-Main and three Colonies; physical inventory count was not conducted in Sablayan Prison and Penal Farm (SPPF) and various PPEs were not presented during physical inventory count at the BuCor–Main and CIW, contrary to existing regulations.



	1)		Section 3, Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM prescribed the criteria for recognition of PPE as follows:

	

	The cost of an item of PPE shall be recognized as assets if, and only if:

	 

a)		it is probable that the future economic benefits or service potential associated with the item will flow to the entity;

	

b)		the cost or fair value of the item can be measured reliably;

	

c)		beneficial ownership and control clearly rest with the government;

	

d)		the asset is used to achieve government objectives; and

	

e)		it meets the capitalization threshold of P15,000.

	

	Under this recognition principle, an entity shall evaluate all its PPE costs at the time they are incurred. These costs include cost incurred initially to acquire or construct an item of PPE and costs incurred subsequently to add to, replace part of, or service the PPE.

	

	2)		Likewise, Section 5 of the same manual states that: Measurement at Recognition. PPE that qualifies for recognition as an asset shall be measured at cost. However, where the PPE is acquired through a non-exchange transaction, its cost shall be measured at its fair value as at the date of acquisition. The cost of an item of PPE comprises: (Pars. 30 and 31, PPSAS 17).

	

	3)		Among the audit recommendations contained in the Consolidated Annual Audit Report (CAAR) for CY 2019 was to require the OIC, AD to prepare: (a) journal entries to record/recognize inspected and delivered PPE and set-up a corresponding liability immediately upon receipt of IAR, Sales Invoice, and other supporting documents from Supply Division, to avoid incurrence of similar errors; (b) recognize depreciation on a monthly basis; (c) compute the accurate and correct depreciation of affected assets; and (d) make necessary adjustments to correct the affected accounts, in compliance with the GAM.

	

	4)		The Statement of Financial Position as of December 31, 2020 presented the balances of the following PPE accounts:

	5)		Audit showed that the above balances were not reliable due to the following errors/deficiencies:

	

a)	Unrecorded and erroneous recording of PPE transactions



	a.1	Unrecorded Building and Structure

	

	6)		For the period January 4 to February 11, 2021, physical inventory of PPE was conducted in BuCor-Main.  During the inventory taking, it was noted that various buildings and structures constructed inside the BuCor-Main Compound were not recorded in the books of accounts.  Details are as follows:

	beside Agro Office

	Pre-Fab of Church (used as quarantine area)

	at the back of Minimum Security Compound

	Building 

	beside Bureau Security and Escort Command 

	

	7)		Said buildings and structures have long been situated in the BuCor-Main Compound.  According to the Chief, SD, these were either acquired through donation or constructed by the Bureau and that their cost could no longer be determined due to absence of necessary documents.  

	

	8)		In Iwahig Prison Penal Farm (IPPF), 18 buildings and structures with total assessed value of ₱24,069,843.19 were not recorded in the books of accounts.  Details are as follows:

	9)		Interview with the IPPF Accountant disclosed that said buildings and structures were not recorded in the books of account due to non-availability of property and accounting records that can be used as basis in determining the actual construction cost. The assessed value cannot be used as basis in recording because PPE shall be recognized either at cost or at fair market value depending on the mode of acquisition as provided in Section 5, Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM.

	

	10)		Also, the Maximum Security Dorm (Super Max) located at Central Sub-Colony of the IPPF costing to ₱4,832,326.54 was not reported in the Report of Physical Count of PPE (RPCPPE) as of December 31, 2020.

	

	a.2	Demolished building not dropped from the books

	

	11)		It was also noted during the inventory taking that the Samsung Building at the Medium Security Compound (MedSeCom), BuCor-Main, recorded in the books of accounts as Other Structures in the amount of ₱7,567,200.00 was no longer existing, because it was destroyed by fire on October 10, 2018 and the remains were already demolished.  Report of fire incident and the damage property were not submitted to the Audit Team, contrary to the following provisions of Section 41, Chapter 10 of the GAM:

	

a)		When a loss of government funds or property occurs while they are in transit or the loss is caused by fire, theft, or other casualty or force majeure, the officer accountable therefore or having custody thereof shall immediately notify the Commission or the auditor concerned x x x.

	

b)		Lost property and the related accumulated depreciation and impairment loss shall be derecognized in the books upon receipt of the Report of Lost, Stolen, Damaged, Destroyed Property (RLSDDP) (Appendix 75) supported by a Notice of Loss prepared and submitted by the Accountable Officer. The loss shall be charged to account “Loss of Assets” at an amount equal to its carrying amount.

	

	12)		The derecognition of said property was not made which resulted in the overstatement of the Building and Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) accounts.

		

	a.3	Turned-over and completed Quarantine Building not transferred to the proper asset account



	13)		Section 8.g, Chapter 10 of the GAM states that: Construction of PPE.  During the construction period, all expenses incurred in relation to the construction of the PPE shall be taken up in the books as Construction in Progress with the appropriate asset classification.  As soon as the construction is completed, the “Construction in Progress” account shall be reclassified to the proper asset account. Likewise, all expenses such as interests, license fees, etc., during the construction period shall be capitalized.



	14)		The construction of the Quarantine Building at BuCor-Main with a contract cost of ₱19,418,807.05 started in June 2020.  Review of documents pertaining to the Quarantine Building disclosed that total payment of ₱15,191,332.75 for progress billings for 78.23 percent of completion was recorded as Construction in Progress-Buildings and Structure. The project was completed in December 2020 as evidence by the Certificate of Completion and Certificate of Acceptance, both dated Decembers 16, 2020.  The building was also inaugurated on December 20, 2020.



	15)		Analysis of PPE accounts revealed that as of December 31, 2020, the Quarantine Building was not yet recorded to the Building account, contrary to Section 8.g, Chapter 10 of the GAM; thus, resulted in the understatement of the Buildings and Accounts Payable accounts.

	

	a.4	Equipment located in other Colonies recorded in BuCor-Main books of accounts

	

	16)		CCTV System and CCTV and Video Wall installed in the Colonies costing ₱2,612,399.56 were recorded in the books of BuCor-Main. Details are as follows:

	17)		Although the CCTV and Video Wall were purchased and paid using the funds of the BuCor-Main, these should have been recorded as property of the respective Colonies.

	

	a.5	Erroneous recording of progress billings

	

	18)		The process of recording in BuCor-Main of progress billings as PPE instead of Construction in Progress is not proper.  The Construction in Progress account is used to record the progress billings of projects that are on-going. The recording in the proper PPE account should only be done after completion and acceptance of the project. 

		

	19)		Analysis of Hospital Health Center account revealed that progress billings on various infrastructure projects amounting to ₱6,766,135.42 were recorded as Hospital Health Center instead of Construction in Progress.  Details are as follows:

	20)		The contract cost of Projects A and B was ₱3,950,766.00 and ₱3,695,000.00, respectively.  Analysis of the account revealed that the above projects recorded as Hospital Health Center were depreciated monthly from the time it was taken-up as PPE, instead of recognizing depreciation at the time the projects were completed/turned-over by the contractors. 



	21)		Verification with the Civil Engineering Section, General Services Division disclosed that both projects were completed sometime in CY 2011 and have been utilized by the Bureau since then.  It was also confirmed by the Accounting Division that to date, no progress billing statement for the remaining balance of ₱879,630.58 has been received from the contractor.  As a result, the erroneous recording of progress billings as Hospital Health Center was naturally corrected.  The required transfer of cost to proper asset upon completion of the asset was no longer necessary, since the cost of the Hospital Health Center shall be the total amount of the progress billings.  However, the monthly depreciation provided in CY 2009 to 2011 has overstated the Accumulated Depreciation account and understated the Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) account by ₱257,592.44.



	a.6	Erroneous recording of semi-expendable properties as PPE

	

	22)		Section 3 of the GAM states that: “The capitalization threshold of P15,000 represents the minimum cost of an individual asset recognized as a PPE on the Statement of Financial Position.”

	

	23)		Review of the PPE Ledger Cards (LCs) disclosed the following properties with acquisition cost of less than ₱15,000.00 which are recorded in the BuCor-Main books as PPE instead of Semi-Expendable Machinery and Equipment; thus, overstating the PPE accounts.  Details are shown below:

c)	Non-provision of depreciation on PPE acquired in CY 2020



	25)		Section 27 of the GAM states that: Depreciation.  PPE gradually loses its ability to provide service over the course of time. Because of this, its cost needs to be distributed on a systematic basis over its useful life. The x x x. The following are policies regarding depreciation of PPE:



a)	x x x

b)	x x x

c)	Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use such as when it is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. For simplicity and to avoid proportionate computation, depreciation shall be for one month if the PPE is available for use on or before the 15th of the month. However, if the PPE is available for use after the 15th of the month, depreciation shall be for the succeeding month.

d)	x x x

a)	A residual value equivalent to at least five percent (5%) of the cost shall be adopted unless a more appropriate percentage is determined by the entity based on its operation subject to the approval of COA.

b)	x x x

c)	The computation of monthly depreciation expense shall be as follows:

	

	Depreciation Expense = Cost – Residual Value

	                                        Estimated Useful Life (in months)

	

	26)		Further review of PPE Ledger Cards revealed that in BuCor-Main, the provision for depreciation was not applied to the following PPEs acquired in CY 2020.  Details of the computed depreciation are summarized below:

d)	Erroneous computation of provision for depreciation

	

	27)			Further review of PPELC in BuCor-Main revealed that the recorded monthly depreciations was misstated due to: (a) non-provision of residual value; (b) depreciation was continuously applied on various fully depreciated PPE; and (c) non-compliance with Sec. 27.c of the GAM.

	29)		The Audit Team has already recommended in AOM No. 2020-012 (19) dated March 26, 2020 and in CAAR for CY 2019 that the Accounting Division (AD): a) recognize depreciation on a monthly basis; b) compute the accurate and correct depreciation of affected assets; and c) make necessary adjustments to correct the balances of affected accounts.  It was noted in the audit of the current transactions that said recommendations were not implemented.

	

	30)		In CY 2019, lapses of the AD may be acceptable because majority of the Accounting Staff were transferred to another Colonies and/or Division and were replaced by Criminology Graduates, who have limited knowledge in Accounting.  However, since all transferred staff were recalled in December 2019, we find no reason why the audit recommendations could not be implemented.

	

	31)		The above errors resulted in the understatement of accounts, PPE, Construction in Progress, Accumulated Depreciation, Accounts Payable and Accumulated Surplus/ Deficit, which affected the fair presentation of the financial statements.  Detailed computation is shown in Annex F:



e)	Discrepancy between Accounting and Property records



	32)		Moreover, the regular reconciliation of Supply Division and Accounting Division records was not conducted, contrary to Appendix 70 of the GAM which requires that: PPELC shall be reconciled with the report on the physical count of the PPE, Property Cards and the control accounts. Any discrepancies shall be immediately verified and adjusted. This resulted in discrepancy/unreconciled balance of ₱144,536,987.56, between the books of BuCor-Main and the four Colonies.

	33)		 It was also noted that the required Property Card was not maintained by the Supply Office, contrary to Appendix 69 of the GAM which states that: The PC shall be maintained in the Supply and/or Property Division/Unit for each class of PPE. The Supply and/or Property Custodian shall record promptly the acquisition (based on the IAR and other supporting documents), issue/transfer/disposal and the description/information about the asset. It shall be maintained by fund cluster.

		

	34)			Furthermore, the required annual physical count of PPE was not conducted by the Inventory Committee of SPPF, contrary to Section 38 of the GAM which states that: entity shall have a periodic physical count of PPE, which shall be done annually and presented on the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) (Appendix 71) as at December 31 of each year.  Also, the RPCPPE was not submitted to the Audit Team as required in Section 42 of the GAM; thus, casting doubts on the reliability and accuracy of the account balances.

		

	35)			In Bucor-Main and CIW, various PPE (details in Annex H), were not presented during the inventory taking.

		

	36)		We recommended that Management:

	

a)		appraise the value of unrecorded building and structures and to exert all efforts to locate and submit necessary documents on the six unrecorded properties situated inside the New Bilibid Prison Reservation Compound;

	

b)		require the Accounting Division (AD) to:

	

1)		strictly adhere to the provisions of the GAM in recognition, derecognition and depreciation of PPE;

2)		compute the accurate and correct depreciation of the affected PPE accounts; and

3)		prepare all necessary adjusting entries to correct the affected accounts;

	

c)		require the Supply Division to:

	

1)		maintain all required records; and

2)		conduct physical count and regularly reconcile their records with Accounting Division records; 

	

d)		require the end-user to present the equipment during inventory taking; and

	

e)		instruct the Civil Engineering Section, General Services Division (GSD), to submit status/progress/inspection reports on the repair of New Bilibid Prison Hospital (NBPH) Annex Building and NBPH Ward 4 and Certificate of Acceptance of all completed projects to the Supply and Accounting Division. 

	

	Operation of the Firing Range



5)	In BuCor-Main, the reliability of Target Range Fees remitted to the Chief Cashier amounting to ₱335,290.00 for CYs 2019 and 2020 cannot be established due to absence of policy/guidelines for the operation of the Firing Range and non-issuance of official receipt by the Collecting Officer assigned at the Firing Range which indicate weakness of internal control that may result to possible loss of revenue to the Bureau.

    

	1)	One of the training grounds of the BuCor for its uniformed personnel is the Firing Range.  This is operated under the Correctional Training School, Training Division.  It is currently supervised by the Acting Chief, Correctional Senior Inspector Pablito A. Jacinto, a BJMP personnel on a secondment status with the BuCor.



	2)	The use of the Firing Range is not only for the officers and employees of the Bureau but also open to the public/private individuals.  It is also used by private entities for firing competitions.  



	3)	Non-uniformed personnel and outsiders are charged upon entrance with a Target Range Fee (TRF) ranging from ₱150.00 to ₱1,000.00, depending on who are the sponsors of the persons availing the use of the Firing Range.



	4)	In the reply letter dated February 5, 2021 of Director General Gerald Q. Bantag to our letter dated January 18, 2021, on the request for submission of the policy/guidelines/Operating Manual for the operation of the Firing Range, Management submitted a Memorandum dated February 2, 2021 of CSUP Joel R. Calvelo, Acting Superintendent, NBP North for CTSUPT Rommel B. Roxas, OIC, Directorate for Security and Operations informing DG Bantag that there was no record on file pertaining to the said policy/guidelines. 



	5)	Interview with the Acting Chief, Firing Range revealed that:



	a)		Upon his assumption in October 2020, there was no Standard Operating Procedure/Manual nor policy/guidelines on the operation of the Firing Range on file;



	b)	There was no fixed rate for TRF and no fixed number of hours per TRF rate;



	c)	Upon entrance, a TRF of ₱150.00 was charged to non-uniformed personnel and Filipino citizen clients, while clients of foreign nationality were charged of TRFs ranging from ₱500.00 to ₱1,000.00, depending on who are sponsoring them;



	d)	Clients of the Firing Range were required upon entrance to sign a waiver that BuCor has no responsibility in case of accident;



	e)	Ammunitions were sold at the Firing Range ranging from ₱11.00 to ₱13.00 per bullet.  The source and the profit from the sale of ammunition were not disclosed in the interview; 



	f)	The clients can fire as many ammunitions as they desired and use the facility for an unlimited period of time;



	g)	A Monthly Target Range Remittance Report (MTRRR) based on the signed waiver of the clients was prepared and submitted to DG Bantag, thru the Deputy Director of Correction Training School;



	h)	The TRFs were collected at the Firing Range and were remitted to the Chief, Cashier on a weekly basis;



	i)	The person handling the collection of TRFs was not designated as Collecting Officer and not bonded; 



	j)	No Official Receipt was issued to the clients of firing range; and



	k)	The Cashier issued Official Receipts (ORs) based on the MTRRR.



	6)	Post-audit of Official Receipts issued for Fund 284 showed that collected TRFs totaling ₱335,290.00 was remitted to the Cashier, BuCor, in CYs 2019 and 2020.  Details are summarized below:

	7)	The above table showed that there were no remittances of TRF collections for the period January to June 2019, November to December 2019 and April to September 2020.  



	8)	Review of issued ORs by the Cashier also disclosed that there was inconsistency in the issuance of ORs.  The ORs were sometimes issued individually in the name of the persons reported in the MTRRR and at times only one OR was issued for the weekly collections.



	9)	The reliability of the collected TRFs for CYs 2019 and 2020 cannot be ascertained due to the absence of policy/guidelines in the operation of the Firing Range particularly on the following:



	a)	TRF rate/rate per person/per hour;

	b)	Sale of ammunitions;

	c)	Reloading of fired bullets; 

	d)	Maintenance of the facilities;

	e)	Collection and remittance of the TRF;

	f)	Issuance of ORs; and

	g)	Qualification/requirement of clients.



	10)	The foregoing practices indicate weak internal control on the management of Firing Range that may result to possible loss of revenue to the Bureau.



	11)	Moreover, the weekly remittance of collections is contrary to Sections 68 and 69 of PD 1445 which provides that:



 Section 68.1	No payment of any nature shall be received by a collecting officer without immediately issuing an official receipt in acknowledgment thereof.   X x x.

	

Section 69.1	Public officers authorized to receive and collect moneys arising from taxes, revenues, or receipts of any kind shall remit or deposit intact the full amounts so received and collected by them to the treasury of the agency concerned and credited to the particular accounts to which the said moneys belong.

	

	12)	Also, failure to apply for fidelity bond of Collecting Officer assigned at the Firing Range is contrary to Section 7.1 of COA Circular 97-002 which provides that: Each accountable officer with a total cash accountability of P2,000.00 or more shall be bonded.  X x x.



	13)	We recommended and Management agreed to:



	a)	develop a system/manual incorporating the operating procedures, policies and guidelines for the Firing Range Operation; 



	b)	require the current Collecting Officer at the Firing Range to remit collected Target Range Fees daily to the Cashier; issue Official Receipt for fees collected; and apply for fidelity bond with the Bureau of the Treasury; and



	c)	require the Chief, Firing Range to submit to the Audit Team Monthly Target Range Remittance Report and all the necessary supporting documents.







Management Comment



	14)	The Acting Chief of the Firing Range commented that there were no collections from April to September 2020 because Muntinlupa City was locked-down and gatherings and other activities were prohibited due to the pandemic.  The range only reopened in October 2020.

	

	Income from Joint Venture Agreement (JVA)

	

6)	The approval by the Superintendent of Iwahig Prison and Penal Farm (IPPF) on the adjustment of production share of the BuCor as stipulated in the Joint Venture Agreement (JVA) cannot be considered binding and contrary to Section 23 of the JVA which resulted in the reduction of production share by ₱1,338,528.50 for the period April to December 2020.



	1)	Article 1159 of the Civil Code of the Philippines provides that: Obligations arising from contracts have the force of law between the contracting parties and should be complied with in good faith.

	

	2)	On August 5, 2019, the BuCor and Puerto Princesa City Water District (PPCWD), represented by the Director General and General Manager, respectively, entered into a Joint Venture Agreement (JVA), whereby  the BuCor shall contribute the use of 10,000 square meters lot located within the IPPF and the PPCWD shall provide the required investment, operating expenses and management needed to develop and construct the diversion dams, filtration facilities, pipelines, water treatment plant and other installation necessary for the operation of the new water source.



	3)	Section 3 of the JVA states that: The BuCor shall have a fixed revenue share of One Hundred Thousand Pesos (P100,000.00) or Php10.00 pesos per square meters every month which shall start on the date of signing.  In addition to the fixed revenue share, the BuCor is also entitled to receive a Production Share in the amount equivalent to Twenty-seven Centavos (Php0.27) per cubic meter (but not below Php8,000.00 pesos daily; subject to review and adjustment every 2 years by the parties based on the inflation or deflation of the Philippine Peso) of water produced from the facilities to be constructed on the property contribution of BuCor. The revenue share shall be remitted to the Cashier of IPPF without the need for demand every 5th day of each month. The Revenue Share shall be computed based on the actual production of the facilities located within the IPPF. To ensure the correct reading of the production meter, the same shall be jointly read by the representatives of PPCWD and IPPF at the end of each month or any reasonable time as agreed by the parties; xxx (underscore ours)



	4)	In CY 2020, the PPCWD paid production share amounting to ₱699,621.30.  Audit of the revenue from the JVA disclosed that the production shares paid and the calculated/expected production share has a difference of ₱1,338,528.50, computed as follows:

	5)	Interview with Management disclosed that the amount collected was based on the total cubic meters produced during the month multiplied by ₱0.27.  The minimum production share of ₱8,000.00 was disregarded because IPPF Management approved in the meeting held on April 3, 2020 the request of Puerto Princesa City Water District (PPCWD) to pay Production Share based on actual cubic meters extracted from the temporary facility at Montible River instead of the stipulated ₱0.27/m3 or ₱8,000.00 per day.  The Water Supply Improvement Project Phase II is still in progress which produced 12,000 m3 per day, less than the first agreement of 30,000 m3 per day. 

	

	6)	According to Management, the request was for the benefit and welfare of all the residents of Puerto Princesa City and of Ihawig Prison Penal Farm (IPPF) which provided free, uninterrupted and continuous water supply.



	7)	While the Audit Team finds the reasons for granting the request valid, the IPPF Superintendent has no authority to decide on the matter.  The approval of the request altered the terms and conditions of the agreement which is contrary to Section 23 of the Joint Venture Agreement (JVA) which states that: 



“This JVA constitutes the complete and exclusive statement of the terms and conditions of the Agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter referred to herein. No statement or agreement, oral or written, made prior to the execution hereof, and no prior conduct or practice of either party shall vary or modify the written terms and conditions set forth in this agreement. No alterations, additions or variations of the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be valid unless made in writing and signed by both parties hereunto.” (underscore ours) 

	

	Therefore, such approval rests with the DG of BuCor. 



	8)	On January 29, 2021, the IPPF Superintendent forwarded the request of the PPCWD to the Director General (DG) thru the Chief of Legal Division, for his information and approval.  However, as of April 27, 2021, the request was not yet approved by the DG.



	9)	Considering that a contract is obligatory in nature, any document that showed approval of the DG, in accordance with Section 3 of the JVA shall be strictly enforced.  Hence, the PPCWD is liable for unpaid production share of ₱1,338,528.50 in CY 2020 pursuant to the JVA. 

		 

	10)	We recommended that the Superintendent of the IPPF:



	a)		secure the approval of the Director General, BuCor, on the request of Puerto Princesa City Water District, otherwise, demand the payment of unpaid production share of ₱1,338,528.50; and 

	

	b)		instruct the concerned IPPF personnel to meticulously review the Monthly Production Report to ensure that the minimum daily production share of ₱8,000.00 was collected, until Section 3 of the Joint Venture Agreement (JVA) is duly amended.

		

		Management Comment

		

	11)	The Superintendent of IPPF commented that by virtue of BUCORDA-SO No. 2021-0194 dated 10 March 2021, he was authorized by DG Bantag to sign the Addendum to the JVA.

		

	12)	The Addendum dated 15 March 2021 signed by CSupt Raul P. Levita and the General Manager of PPCWD, stipulated among others were:



	 1.	PPCWD will construct a temporary facility at Montible River in response to the water shortage experienced by all consumers in the City of Puerto Princesa especially during drought season and while the WSIP II is still on-going construction;

	

	2. 	BuCor will receive a production share in the amount equivalent to Twenty Seven Centavos (₱0.27) per cubic meter of water produced from the temporary facility; and

	

	3.	PPCWD undertakes to remove the said temporary facility once the WSIP II’s construction is finished and the same is operation.

	

	13)	Hence, Section 3 of the JVA which states that:  Xxx In addition to the fixed revenue share, the BuCor is also entitled to receive a Production Share in the amount equivalent to Twenty-seven Centavos (Php0.27) per cubic meter (but not below Php8,000.00 pesos daily; subject to review and adjustment every 2 years by the parties based on the inflation or deflation of the Philippine Peso) of water produced from the facilities to be constructed on the property contribution of BuCor., was amended.

		

	14)	The Superintendent further commented that the concerned personnel was instructed to review the collection of production share, as recommended.

		

	 Claims paid without complete documentation

	

7)	In Davao Prison and Penal Farm (DPPF) and Sablayan Prison and Penal Farm (SPPF), disbursement vouchers (DVs) were processed and paid even without complete documentation, contrary to Section 4.6 of PD 1445 and COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012; thus, propriety and validity of these transactions were doubtful.



			a)	For payment of catering services for CY 2020 totaling ₱176,314,903.31



	1)	Section 4.6 of PD 1445 states, among others that: Claims against government funds shall be supported with complete documentation.

	

	2)	One of the general requirements for all types of disbursements as stated in COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 is the sufficient and relevant documents to establish validity of claim.

	

	3)	In DPPF, review of DVs for payment of catering services revealed that these were processed and paid even without complete documentation as enumerated below:   

	

a)		 Documents to show that the extension of contract beyond six months was immediately reported to the Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB) as required in Section 5.2 of the Revised Guidelines for the Extension of Contracts for General Services;

	

b)		 Food safety requirements as provided in the contract, to wit:

	

	--		Sanitary permit of the caterer from the local health office;

--	Health clearance certificate of food handlers both the caterer’s staff and inmate kitchen workers, from the local health authority; 

--	Certificate of Meat Inspection of Imported Meat for Domestic

		--	Distribution, if any;

--	Analysis of Water Quality by the Municipal Health Office of Braulio E. Dujali Tagum, Davao del Norte on a quarterly basis;

--	Certificate of Potability; and

--	Certificate indicating therein that pest treatment and fumigation were done at least twice a year.



	4)		Interview with the Accountant and BAC Secretariat disclosed that procurement activities of DPPF are handled by the BAC of the BuCor-Main.  After the procurement activity, documents are forwarded to their end for implementation and to support payment of claims.  In the case of Catering Services, documents forwarded were only the Agreement for Extension, Notices of extensions and BAC Res. No. 2020-18.  

	

	5)	It is emphasized that as government officials, the DPPF BAC and Accountant should see to it that all required documents for catering services are complete before processing of claim.  



	6)	Since the DPPF pays for the transactions, they should not just rely only on documents forwarded to them but should make an assertion to request from BuCor-Main copy of documents necessary for the payment of catering services.



	7)	Thus, propriety and validity of these transactions totaling ₱176,314,903.31 covering the period January to December 2020 were not established.



	8)	We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accounting Section and the BAC of DPPF to ensure completeness of supporting documents prior to the processing of claim for catering services. 

	

			b)	Payment and procurement of ammunitions/construction materials not supported with required documents

	

	9)	Section 53.2 of the RIRR of RA 9184 provides, among others, that:

	

	Emergency Cases.  In case of imminent danger to life or property during the state of calamity, or when time is of the essence arising from natural or man-made calamities or other causes where immediate action is necessary to prevent damage to or loss of life or property, or to restore vital public services, infrastructure facilities and other public utilities….

	

	10)	Section 9.2 of COA Circular 2012-001 prescribes the basic requirements common to all purchases under alternative mode of procurement.

	

	11)	The following DVs pertains to procurement of DPPF in CY 2020 through emergency mode of procurement:

		k)	Warranty Certificate of the items procured per Sections 39 and 62 of the IRR which provides among others that Performance and/or Warranty Securities are required for alternative modes of procurement.

		 

	13)			Verification with the BAC Secretariat disclosed that certain procedures were not performed in the procurement of ammunition due to time constraint. 

		

	14)			Payment without complete documentation and emergency procurement not in accordance with Section 54 of RIRR of RA 9184 casts doubt on the propriety and validity of the transactions.



	15)			We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accounting Section and the Bids and Awards Committee to strengthen the review process of all transactions on procurement to ensure completeness of documentary requirements to avoid suspension and/or disallowance in audit.

		

			c)	Payment for travelling, salaries and wages, supplies, electricity, and repairs and maintenance

8)	The contracts for the Supply and Delivery of Food Subsistence of Persons Deprived of Liberty (PDLs) at the New Bilibid Prison (NBP) and Correctional Institutions for Women (CIW) of BuCor with AFS Eatery and Mang Kiko Catering Services, Inc., were extended for more than six months, despite violation of several conditions in Section 4, Annex A of Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB) Resolution No. 23-2007 dated September 28, 2007; thus, depriving the BuCor of a more suitable/beneficial contract terms and cost.

	4)	As shown in the above table, the contracts with the two suppliers were extended in CY 2020 for more than six months, (four times for a period of three months).  The said extensions did not meet the following conditions in Annex A of GPPB Resolution No. 23-2007 dated September 28, 2007 due to deficiencies noted: 



Conditions Not Met

Observation/Comment

4.2	The original contract subject of the extension was awarded in accordance with the provisions of Republic Act 9184 (R.A. 9184) and its Implementing Rules and Regulations Part A (IRR-A).

The original contracts with AFS Eatery for Lot 1 to Lot 4 (MaxSeCom - North, West, East and South) were awarded not in accordance with RA 9184.



Said contracts were the subject of AOM No. 2020-003 (19) dated February 24, 2020 that pertains to restructuring of MaxSeCon into four quadrants (North, West, Eat and South) and was done to circumvent Section 23.4.1.3 of the 2016 RIRR of RA 9184, resulting in the computation of Single Largest Completed Contract (SLCC) based on the ABC for each quadrant instead of the Total ABC for MaxSeCom, thus, qualifying AFS Eatery as eligible to participate in the four lots of the MaxSeCom.



The required SLCC should have been 50 percent of the total ABC of ₱200,277,000.00 or ₱100,138,500.00, however, due to the restructuring of MaxSeCom, it was reduced to as low as ₱16.06 M.  As such, AFS was declared compliant and winning bidder for submitted one SLCC for Lot 1 to 4, a Contract of Agreement for the Subsistence of Provincial Jail Inmates at the Provincial Government of Bulacan with a contract amount of ₱45,272,865.00.



If the MaxSeCom was not divided into four quadrants, the AFS Eatery should have been declared non-compliant.



In June 2019, when the bidding process started, there was an appeal filed with the COA by AFS Eatery on the ND No. 17-11-001-101, disallowing payment made to AFS Eatery for the catering services rendered from July to September 2017 because the procurement process was not in accordance with the provisions of RA 9184, one of which is that, the SLCC requirement was reduced from 50 percent to 25 percent.



The appeal was Denied and the ND was Affirmed in the NGS-C4 Decision No. 2019-48 dated December 26, 2019, received by Management on January 20, 2020.



Had Management acted on the Decision of COA, the contract of AFS Eatery should not have been extended in the second and last quarter of CY 2020.

4.6	The current service provider has not violated any of the provisions of the original contract.

 

Section 4.3 of each FSA (Lot 1 to Lot 4), states that: The Second Party (AFS) shall promptly pay the rent in the amount of ₱20,000.00 directly to the BuCor Cashiers office every end of the month.  Default in payment of such rent without valid and justifiable reason will amount to liquidated damages in the amount of ₱200.00 per day from the date of default until payment is completed”



AFS Eatery violated Section 4.3 of each contract for not paying the rental of kitchen (Lot 2, 3 and 4) for the period August 2019 to October 2020 amounting to ₱960,000.00 (₱20,00.00 x 3 Lots x 16 months) and liquidated damages amounting to ₱2,194,800.00 (3,658 days x ₱200.00 per day x 3 Lots) or a total of ₱3,154,800.00 covering the period from August 2019 to November 30, 2020. 

1)	If the proposed contract extension exceeds six (6) months, the Head of the Procuring Entity or his/her duly authorized representative shall immediately report to the GPPB in writing of its intent to extend beyond six months.

The extension of contracts with AFS Eatery and MKCS exceeds six (6) months, however only extension for the period June 1 to September 30, 2020 was reported to the GPPB and not the extension for October 1 to December 31, 2020.



	5)	Had bidding for FSA in CY 2020 been conducted, proponents might have offered a more suitable terms and cost per meal that is advantageous to the Bureau.







	6)	We recommended that Management:



a)	submit explanation why: i) bidding was not conducted before the extended contract for supply and delivery of food subsistence expires on March 31, 2020; and ii) contract with AFS Eatery was extended despite not meeting all conditions prescribed in the Revised Guidelines on the Extension of Contracts for General Support Services; 



b)	immediately conduct bidding for supply and delivery of food subsistence of Persons Deprived of Liberty in NBP and CIW for CY 2021, otherwise, disbursements for food supply expenses without valid contracts shall be disallowed in audit; and



c)	strictly adhere to the rules and regulations on procurement of goods and services prescribed in RA 9184.



Management Comment

	

	7)	The Chairman, BAC commented that the conditions for contract extension as set forth in Annex “A” of GPPB Resolution on Extension of Contract were strictly followed.  First, the subject contracts were extended only within the allowable period of one year; second, the original contract was awarded in accordance with the provisions of RA 9184 and its RIRR; third, the GPPB was informed considering that the contract was extended beyond six months; fourth, the contract was treated merely as an emergency measure to maintain status quo in the operation of the Bureau; fifth, the supplier did not violate any provision in the original contract; and lastly, the contract was extended under the same terms and conditions of the original contract.



Auditor’s Rejoinder



	8)	After evaluation of the Management comments, we maintain our position that several conditions on extension of contract were not met when the contracts for Food Subsistence were extended which was discussed in detail in our Rejoinder dated December 17, 2020.

	

	Physical Inventory of Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE)

	

9)	Various management practices in the transfer of property accountability and supervision of unserviceable properties were contrary to Sections 40 and 42, Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM; hence, an indication of weakness on asset management. 



	1)	Section 38, Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM states that: Physical Count of PPE. The entity shall have a periodic physical count of PPE, which shall be done annually and presented on the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) (Appendix 71) as at December 31 of each year. This shall be submitted to the Auditor concerned not later than January 31 of the following year. Equipment found at station and losses discovered during the physical count shall be reported to the Accounting Division/Unit for proper accounting/recording.”

	

	2)	Section 40 of the same manual prescribed the policies on idle, unserviceable and fully depreciated PPE as follows:



	a.     X x x

a)		A PPE is said to be unserviceable if it is no longer capable of providing the entity with future economic benefits or service potential.

b)		All unserviceable property shall be reported in the Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP). PPE reported in the IIRUP shall be dropped from the books by debiting Impairment Loss-Property, Plant and Equipment (cost of the PPE less Accumulated Depreciation).

	

	3)	While, Section 42 of the same manual prescribes the forms/reports necessary to account for PPE:

	

	a.  	X x x

	g.	Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (Appendix 73) – this form shall be used to report the physical count and condition of PPE by type as at a given date, including those which are unrecorded and those which could not be accounted for. It shows the balance of PPE per property cards and per count and the shortage/overage, if any. It shall be rendered by the Inventory Committee, on its yearly physical count of properties owned by the entity.

	h.	Inventory and Inspection Report for Unserviceable Property (Appendix 74) – this report shall be used to account for all unserviceable property of an entity which is subject to disposal. It also serves as the basis in derecognizing the unserviceable properties carried in the PPE accounts.

	i.	X x x

	j.	Property Transfer Report (Appendix 76) – this form shall be used every time there will be transfer of property from an outgoing officer to his successor or from one accountable officer/employee to another of the same or another entity.



	4)	Likewise, COA Circular No. 2020-006 dated January 31, 2020 prescribes the Guidelines and Procedures in the Conduct of Physical Count of PPE, Recognition of PPE Items Found at Station, and Disposition for Non-existing/Missing PPE Items, for the One-Time Cleansing of PPE Account Balances of Government Agencies.

	 

	5)	The physical inventory of PPE at the BuCor-Main and CIW was conducted by Supply and Accounting Division Staff from January 4 to February 11, 2021.  A representative from the Audit Team was invited to observe the proceedings. 



	6)	In the course of the inventory taking, we observed the following:



a)		PPE did not bear official property tag;

b)		Various unserviceable properties were not returned to Supply Division (SD) and still in the possession of the AO; 

c)		Issued PPE to AO was not returned to SD even if the AO is reassigned to another Colony; and



	7)	Interview with some of the AO disclosed that the reason why they brought with them the issued PPE was due to fear of paying in case of loss by their successor. Accordingly, there were also instances that PAR/ICS for returned equipment were not cancelled by SD and still included in the inventory reports of the succeeding year. 

	

	8)	Interview with SD staff disclosed that personnel reassigned to another Colony were required to secure clearance from money and property accountabilities before assumption to their new station and were required to secure courtesy clearance after assumption to the new station.  However, due to some lapses, the clearance was signed without proper verification of the AO’s accountabilities.



	9)	The above practices were not in keeping with Sections 40 and 42 of the GAM and an indication of weakness on asset management.  Also, taking with them the equipment when transferred disrupted the operation/performance of the office; and the residual value of the equipment diminished, if disposed at a later year.  



	10)			Moreover, in IPPF, review of the RPCPPE submitted by the Inventory Team showed various unserviceable PPE totaling ₱14,326,577.69, summarized below:

	11)			The required IIRUP was not prepared and the above PPE were not disposed of contrary to Section 10, Chapter 10, Volume I of GAM and Section 79 of PD No. 1445; thereby, exposing said properties to further deterioration due to natural elements and deprived the government of a higher return if immediately disposed/sold.

	

	12)	We recommended that Management:



a)		create an Inventory Committee as required in COA Circular No. 2020-006 to cleanse PPE accounts;

	

b)		instruct the Supply Division to issue memorandum to all AOs listed in Annex H to produce/present the PPE under their accountability; otherwise, payment for lost PPE will be enforced; 



c)		instruct the AOs to return unserviceable property to Supply Division for immediate and proper disposal; 



d)		prepare the Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) and course the immediate disposal of the unserviceable properties;

	

e)		instruct the reassigned AOs to transfer their property accountabilities to their successor for proper issuance of Property Transfer Report (PTR);



f)		instruct the signatories in the Clearance Form to be vigilant and cautious in signing/issuance of clearance to reassigned personnel; and



g)		require the Supply Division to update their records regularly.

	

	Uncompleted Infrastructure Project

	

10)	Prolonged suspension by BuCor of the Build and Design of Regional Prison Facility project at Sablayan Prison and Penal Farm (SPPF) with contract cost of ₱288,878,759.61 caused the non-completion of the prison facility and termination of the contract; hence, depriving the intended users of the project of the benefits and comforts.  Moreover, payment of the 15 percent mobilization fee amounting to ₱43,331,813.94 was not supported with all the required documents, contrary to Section 47 of the GAM and Paragraph 4.2 of Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (RIRR) of RA 9184.  Further, due to neglect and long exposure to sun and rain, the reported 20.38 percent project accomplishment was damaged; thus, may result to wastage of government funds. 



	1)	Paragraph 9, Annex E of the RIRR of RA 9184 states the provisions on Suspension of Work as follows:



9.1.	The procuring entity shall have the authority to suspend the work wholly or partly by written order for such period as may be deemed necessary, due to force majeure or any fortuitous events or for failure on the part of the contractor to correct bad conditions which are unsafe for workers or for the general public, to carry out valid orders given by the procuring entity or to perform any provisions of the contract, or due to adjustment of plans to suit field conditions as found necessary during construction. The contractor shall immediately comply with such order to suspend the work wholly or partly.



9.2	The contractor or its duly authorized representative shall have the right to suspend work operation on any or all projects/activities along the critical path of activities after fifteen (15) calendar days from date of receipt of written notice from the contractor to the district engineer/regional director/consultant or equivalent official, as the case may be, due to the following: 

There exist right-of-way problems which prohibit the contractor from performing work in accordance with the approved construction schedule.

 

Requisite construction plans which must be owner-furnished are not issued to the contractor precluding any work called for by such plans.



Peace and order conditions make it extremely dangerous, if not possible, to work. However, this condition must be certified in writing by the Philippine National Police (PNP) station which has responsibility over the affected area and confirmed by the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) Regional Director. 



There is failure on the part of the procuring entity to deliver government-furnished materials and equipment as stipulated in the contract. 



Delay in the payment of contractor's claim for progress billing beyond forty-five (45) calendar days from the time the contractor's claim has been certified to by the procuring entity’s authorized representative that the documents are complete unless there are justifiable reasons thereof which shall be communicated in writing to the contractor.

 

9.3.	In case of total suspension, or suspension of activities along the critical path, which is not due to any fault of the contractor, the elapsed time between the effective order of suspending operation and the order to resume work shall be allowed the contractor by adjusting the contract time accordingly.



	2)	On July 20, 2018, the Notice to Proceed (NTP) signed by former Director General Ronald M. Dela Rosa, was issued to A. G. Araja Construction and Development Corporation (AGACDC) for the project, “Build and Design of Regional Prison Facility at Sablayan Prison and Penal Farm” with a contract cost of ₱288,878,759.61 for the duration of 425 calendar days.



	3)	The Terms of Reference (TOR) of the contract provides that: the Contractor shall submit Detailed Program of Work within fourteen (14) calendar days after the issuance of the Notice to Proceed for approval by the procuring entity.  While the Scope of Work states that: the contractor shall then proceed with the construction under the terms and conditions set forth in the contract, upon approval of the Final Detailed Architectural and Engineering Design Plans and Specifications. 



	4)	Review of documents showed that the Detailed Program of Work was not submitted to the Bureau within 14 calendar days after issuance of the NTP while the Detailed Architectural and Engineering Design was signed only by Engr. Justino G. Rosario and Engr. Cesar P. Sandoval and not by the Director General.  Also, the Building Permit required by the National Building Code of the Philippines (NBCP) was not submitted.  Despite these deficiencies, 15 percent mobilization fee was paid to AGACDC and the construction of the facility proceeded.  Details of the payment are shown below:

	5)	Review of supporting documents attached to DV revealed that the following documents required for advance payment were not attached, contrary to Section 47, Chapter 10 of the GAM and Paragraph 4.2 of RIRR of RA 9184:



a)	Irrevocable Standby Letter of Credit/Security Bond/Bank Guarantee;

b)	abstract of bids; and

c)	blue print of the project.



Section 47, Sequence 9 states that: the Supply Division, prepares DV for the payment of mobilization fee. Attaches the bill of the creditor and copies of the contract, original ORS, abstract of bids, bidder’s bond, notice to commence work, performance bond and blue print and other documents required under COA Circular No. 2012-001.



Paragraph 4.2, Annex E of the RIRR of RA 9184 states that: The advance payment shall be made only upon the submission to and acceptance by the procuring entity of an irrevocable standby letter of credit of equivalent value from a commercial bank, a bank guarantee or a surety bond callable upon demand, issued by a surety or insurance company duly licensed by the Insurance Commission and confirmed by the procuring entity.



	6)	On March 15, 2019, to further evaluate the plans/design of the project to meet and address the congestion problem in SPPF, Notice of Temporary Suspension (NTS) was issued by the Legal Division, BuCor to AGACDC.  Before the suspension, the Inspection Report of Civil Engineering Section showed that the project was 20.38 percent completed as of February 6, 2019.  Since then, the suspension is still in effect.



	7)	Three progress billings were received by the Civil Engineering Section, but were not submitted to Accounting Division; hence, no payment was made.  Details as follows:

	8)	On November 12, 2019, Management received a letter from See and Herrera Law Firm informing BuCor that their client AGACDC is terminating the contract and demanding payment within five working days the total amount of ₱40,731,905.10 representing total due and outstanding progress billings plus retention money less unrecouped down payment, and that in case of failure to pay said amount appropriate arbitration case against BuCor and its responsible officers will commence and the Complaint was ready for filing.



	9)	On November 25, 2019, the contractor filed with the Construction Industry Arbitration Commission (CIAC) a Request for Arbitration and Complaint dated November 22, 2019 against BuCor for claims of ₱44,514,772.46 due to: 1) work stoppage for eight months (March 22, 2019 to November 22, 2019) without any valid reason or justification and without any fault on the part of AGACDC; and 2) BuCor’s deliberate failure and refusal without any valid ground to pay AGACDC’s Progress Billings despite demands.  The case was docketed as CIAC Case No. 65-2019.



	10)	The CIAC Final Award dated February 8, 2021, on CIAC Case No. 65-2019, the Arbitral Tribunal ordered:



a)	BuCor to pay AGACDC the amount of ₱29,104,535.03 for unpaid billings, retention less unrecouped down payment; 



b)	Upon the Award becomes final and executory, interest of six percent per annum shall be further paid to Claimant on the outstanding amount until full payment thereof; and



c)	The Claimant and Respondent shall equally shoulder the cost of arbitration amounting to ₱1,010,081.75.



	11)	Inquiry with the Audit Team Leader of SPPF on the current condition of the 20.38 percent completed structure revealed that it was already damaged and only the columns remained.



	12)	The prolonged suspension of the project caused the non-completion of the prison facility, termination of the contract, dispute with the contractor, damage to the unfinished structure, that may result to wastage of government funds. 

	

	13)	We recommended that Management require the A. G. Araja Construction and Development Corporation (AGACDC) to submit all the documentary requirements pursuant to Section 9.1 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012; and resolve the dispute with AGACDC.



Management Comment



	14)	Management commented that BuCor, represented by the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) filed on March 25, 2021 before the Court of Appeals a Petition for Review with prayer for issuance of Writ of Preliminary Injunction enjoining CIAC from implementing the Motion for issuance of Writ of Execution dated March 5, 2021.  As of this writing, Management is waiting for the resolution of the Court of Appeals to grant favor on its petition for review



11)	Procurement of drugs and medicines totaling ₱165,896,000.21 through Emergency Mode of Procurement in Bucor-Main was in accordance with GPPB Circular No.  01-2020 dated April 6, 2020; thus, the basic need for the safety and health of Persons Deprived of Liberty against COVID-19 was immediately addressed.

	5)			Review of documents revealed that the mode of procurement adopted was through Emergency Purchase to expedite procurement of drugs and medicines. Consequently, the process undertaken was in accordance with GPPB Circular No. 01-2020 dated April 6, 2020.



	6)			Paragraph 3 of GPPB Circular No. 01-2020 states that: “PROCEDURE.  PEs are guided by the following in the conduct of Emergency Procurement under the Bayanihan Act:

	

3.1	PEs shall prepare the project requirements, with the following details: 

	X x x

	

There is no required form to be used in the preparation of the project requirements.  PEs shall formulate their project requirements and contract packaging based on their needs and the capability of suppliers as determined through initial market scanning or scoping.

3.3	PEs shall then directly negotiate or procure from a legally, technically, and financially capable supplier, distributor, manufacturer, contractor, or consultant. X x x

	

	During negotiations, a formal written offer or bid may be submitted but is not required.

3.4	X x x



3.5	The HoPE, upon recommendation of the BAC or duly authorized End-user unit or any other appropriate bureau, committee, support or procuring unit, shall immediately award the contract to a legally, technically, and financially capable supplier, distributor, manufacturer, contractor, or consultant.

	1)	Considering the urgent necessity of the items to be procured under this Circular as well as the difficulty in estimating the required quantity needed for such, and the available funding at that time of the original purchase, a Special Repeat Order may be availed by the PE provided all of the following conditions are present:

	

a)		limited to Goods to be procured under this Circular;

b)		the Goods were procured under a contract previously awarded through any mode of procurement, provided that the NOA was issued within the last six (6) months;

c)		unit prices must be the same as or lower than those in the original contract.  In the case of same unit price, the PE must ensure that there is no lower price available in the market;

d)		there has been a partial delivery, inspection and acceptance of the goods under a contract previously awarded; and 

e)		the total amount shall not exceed one hundred percent (100%) of the original contract.



	8)			Evaluation and validation of the procurement process disclosed that BuCor-Main was compliant with the prescribed procedures and guidelines on the period of action on procurement activities under the Emergency Mode of Procurement pursuant to the Bayanihan Act.
