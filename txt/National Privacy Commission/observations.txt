PART II – OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

  
Financial Audit 

 
1. There were misstatements found in the accounts Due from National 
Government Agencies (NGAs), Office Supplies Inventory, and Furniture and Fixtures 

in the total amount of ₱1,736,676.84 which represented 2.58 percent of the total 

assets and in the Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) account in the amount of 

₱646,094.36 which represented 1.19 percent of the total net assets/equity of the 

National Privacy Commission (NPC) as at December 31, 2020, hence, negatively 

affecting Management’s assertions as to the accuracy, completeness, cut-off and 

valuation of the said accounts. 

 

2. Paragraph 27 of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) 1, 
Presentation of Financial Statements, provides that financial statements shall present 

fairly the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of an entity. Fair 

presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other 

events, and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for 

assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in IPSASs. The application of IPSASs, 

with additional disclosures when necessary, is presented to result in financial statements 

that achieve a fair presentation. 

 

3. When an audited entity presents its financial statements, it is implicitly making 
assertions that certain conditions have been fulfilled in the accounts, among others, which 

are as follows: 

 

Assertion Condition 

Completeness All transactions and events that should be recorded have been recorded 

Accuracy All transactions and events were recorded without error; all information 
disclosed is in the correct amounts, and which reflect their proper values 

Cut-off All transactions and events were recorded within the correct reporting period 

Classification All transactions have been recorded in the proper accounts; assets, liabilities 
and equity interests have been recorded in the proper accounts 

Existence All account balances exist for assets, liabilities, and equity 

Rights and 
obligations 

The entity holds or controls the rights to assets, and liabilities are the 
obligations of the entity 

Valuation and 
allocation 

Assets, liabilities, and equity interests have been included in the financial 
statements at appropriate amounts and any resulting valuation or allocation 
adjustments have been appropriately recorded 

Presentation For account balances - assets, liabilities and equity interests are appropriately 
aggregated or disaggregated and clearly described, and related disclosures 
are relevant and understandable in the context of the requirements of the 
applicable financial reporting framework 

Understandability The information included in the financial statements has been appropriately 
presented and is clearly understandable. 

 



 

27 
 

4. The responsibility for the fair presentation and reliability of the financial 
statements rests with the management of the reporting entity, particularly the head of 

finance/accounting office and the head of entity or his authorized representative, as 

provided in the Philippine Application Guidance (PAG) 4 on IPSAS I and Section 4, 

Chapter 19 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume I. 

 

5. Section 6, Chapter 2 of the GAM, Volume I, provides that each entity shall 
recognize and present its financial transactions and operations conformably to the basic 

principles of government accounting, one of which is the accrual basis of accounting. 

Accrual basis is defined as a basis of accounting under which transactions and other 

events are recognized when they occur (and not only when cash or its equivalent is 

received or paid). Therefore, the transactions and events are recognized in the accounting 

records and recognized in the financial statements of the periods to which they relate.  

The elements recognized under accrual accounting are assets, liabilities, net assets/equity, 

revenue, and expenses. 

 

Accounting errors/omissions 

 

6. In our audit of the accounts of the NPC, we noted the following accounting errors 
and misstatements which were not adjusted as at year-end:

to the Procurement Services of the Department of Budget and Management (PS-DBM) 

for the procurement of airline tickets, office supplies, equipment, and other common-use 

supplies, differed with the balance of NPC account per Agency Summary of Payments 

and Deliveries (ASPD) maintained and forwarded by the PS-DBM of P9,191,315.49, or a  

discrepancy of P1,264,809.35, accounted in Table 3:

Unreconciled amount  (0.04)   

Grand Total 1,264,809.35   

 

a) Unrecorded charges in the GFA Fund - P724,691.78 
 

9. Section 70 of the Presidential Decree (PD) No. 74 otherwise known as the 
Government Auditing Code of the Philippines requires that in the receipt and disposition 

of government funds and property, depositories shall at the close of each month, report to 

the agency head, in such form as he may direct, the condition of the agency account 

standing on their books. The head of the agency shall see to it that a reconciliation is 

made between the balance shown in the reports and the balance found in the books of the 

agency.  

10. Reconciliation serves as a fundamental account process to ensure that the actual 
charges from the credit line and payments thereto matches the total tickets booked/issued 

and replenishments made. 

11. National Privacy Commission (NPC) registered in the Government Fares 
Agreement (GFA) for the procurement of airline tickets through a Memorandum of 

Agreement (MOA) executed with the PS-DBM. 

12. Notwithstanding the delisting of airline tickets under the GFA in the list of 
Common-Use Supplies and Equipment (CSE) by virtue of Government Procurement 

Policy Board (GPPB) Resolution No. 21-2019 dated September 5, 2019, the MOA 

between the NPC and PS-DBM is still effective to date considering that it was not 

terminated by any of the parties.   

13. For CY 2019, various charges from the GFA Fund totaling P724,691.78 were not 
recognized in the books of NPC because copies of sales invoices were not forwarded to 

the Accounting Office as basis for recording. Likewise, reconciliation with the PS-DBM 

was not regularly undertaken such that Management was not kept abreast of the actual 

charges out of the fund and its running balance at any given time. This resulted in the 



 

30 
 

overstatement of the receivable accounts and accumulated surplus/deficit by 

P724,691.78.  

b) Erroneous recording of adjusting entry - P141,352.58 

14. PS-DBM prescribed a separate accounting entry for the liquidation and for the 
replenishment of GFA funds. The entry for the liquidation upon receipt of Sales Invoices 

(SIs) is a debit to Travel expense account and credit to Due from NGAs account. Whilst 

upon replenishment of the GFA Funds, a debit to Due from NGAs account and credit to 

Cash account is made.  

15. In CY 2018, Journal Entry Voucher (JEV) No. 2018-12-2837 dated December 31, 
2018 was drawn to record the unreplenished sales invoices amounting to P141,352.58 but 

erroneously debited to Travel expenses. However, the entry was posted to General Ledger 

with a debit to Due from NGAs which is the correct account.  In CY 2020, looking at the 

erroneous debit under the JEV, an adjusting entry was made not knowing that the entry in 

the General Ledger was already correct. The adjusting entry under JEV No. 2020-03-

0376 March 31, 2020, therefore, overstated the Due from NGAs and Accumulated 

Surplus/ Deficit by P141,352.58. 

c) Unrecorded delivered inventories - P325,041.24 

16. It is the policy of the government to make the procurement of supplies, materials 
and equipment to be done in the most economical and efficient manner. Executive Order 

No. 40, s. 2001 provides that agencies shall procure common-use supplies, materials and 

equipment from the Procurement Service (PS) attached to the Department of Budget and 

Management (DBM), in accordance with Letter of Instructions No. 755, Executive Order 

Nos. 289 series of 1987, 359 series of 1989, and 322 series of 2000. Section 4(b) of 

Executive Order No. 359 dated June 2, 1989 further provides that agencies shall remit to 

the Procurement Service the funds needed to service their requirements for supplies, 

materials and equipment as reflected in the Work and Financial Plan.  

17. Inventories delivered covered by the Delivery Receipt Nos. M19-016220  dated 
January 28, 2019 and M19-010936 dated July 8, 2019   amounting to P78,310.40 and 

P246,730.84, respectively, as per PS-DBM record were not recorded in the NPC’s books 

due to lack of coordination between Units such that Delivery Receipts and Sales Invoices 

were not secured from PS-DBM and forwarded to the Accounting Unit for recording. 

18. The non-recording of delivered inventories overstated Due from NGAs account 
and consequently understated Office Supplies Inventory account by P325,041.24. 

d) Under-recording of deliveries amounting to P300.00 

19. Deliveries by PS-DBM amounting to P573,300.00 as per DR No. M19-001190 
dated January 28, 2019 was recorded in the NPC books in the amount of P573,000.00 as 

per Journal Entry Voucher (JEV) No. 2020-03-0357 dated March 31, 2020, thus, 

receivable account is overstated by P300.00 and understated the Office Supplies Inventory 

account.  



 

31 
 

 

 

20.  We recommended and Management agreed to require: 

a. The Supply/Property Officer to closely coordinate with the PS-DBM to 
secure copies of DRs and SIs, and  initiate reconciliation with PS-DBM; 

b. The Accountant to: (i) record the charges from the GFA Fund, delivered 
inventories based on proper supporting documents; (ii) adjust the 

erroneous entries and under-recording of deliveries, and henceforth, 

verify first the entries in the GL before any adjustment is made; and 

c. The Supply/Property Officer to coordinate with the Accountant on the 
submission of documents relating to deliveries from PS-DBM for proper 

and timely recording in the books of accounts. 

21. Management commented that the PS-DBM has forwarded the copy of unrecorded 
inventory with DR No. M19-010936 amounting to P246,730.84 and the eight (8) SIs 

pertaining to unrecorded deliveries/charges issued tickets from GFA Fund of 

P724,691.78. An adjusting entry shall be made once the related DRs and SIs were 

submitted by the Supply Officer to the Accountant. JEV No. 2021-02-024 dated February 

01, 2021 recording the adjusting entry to correct the misstatement of P300.00 was made.  

Misstatements in PPE account  

e) Unrecorded PPE  - ₱219,950.00 
 

22. Five (5) units of fire proof vaults with a total cost of P219,950.00 delivered by the 
supplier and accepted on August 20, 2020 were not recorded in the books of accounts due 

to the non-submission by the Property Officer of the Inspection and Acceptance Report 

(IAR), together with the supporting documents, to the Accountant as basis for recording. 

The details thereof are as follows:

23. Section 44 (Seq. No. 1-9), Chapter 10 of the GAM, Volume I, discussed, among 
others, the procedures in the recording of deliveries of Property Plant and Equipment 

(PPE) items which provides that upon receipt and followed by inspection and acceptance 



 

32 
 

of the PPE items, the Supply/Property Officer will forward copy 3 of the IAR and a 

photocopy of the Purchase Order (PO) and Delivery Receipt (DR) to the Accountant as 

basis for recording the received/accepted goods. 

24. The Supply/Property Officer disclosed that for deliveries other than from the PS-
DBM, advance copy of the IAR and supporting documents, as a practice were not 

directly submitted to the Accountant. Rather, only upon preparation and processing of the 

DVs by the requesting unit/end-user, will the documents be forwarded to the Accountant 

together with the IAR, DR and supporting documents. Thus, the delay/untimely 

submission of the said documents to the Accountant caused the non-recording/posting of 

said procurements in a timely manner.  

25. Consequently, the related depreciation for the PPE items above were not 
provided.  

26. We recommended and Management agreed to: 

a. Require the Supply/Property Officer to strictly comply with the 
submission of a photocopy of the PO, IAR and DR to the Accountant 

immediately upon receipt of the PPE items pursuant to Section 44, 

Chapter 10 of the GAM, Volume I; and 

b. Require the Accountant to: 

i. record the PPE items received and accepted with proper 
documentation, and henceforth, coordinate with the Supply/Property 

Officer in obtaining the PO, IAR, and DR immediately after delivery 

for the timely recording of PPE; and 

ii. compute for depreciation and record in the books the depreciation 
expense and Accumulated Depreciation based on the best estimate of 

its useful life.  

27. In summary, there were total misstatements in the Due from NGAs, Office 
Supplies Inventory, and Furniture and Fixtures accounts amounting to ₱1,736,676.84 

which represented 2.58 percent of total assets and in the Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) 

account in the amount of ₱646,094.36 which represented 1.19 percent of the total net 

assets/equity of NPC as at December 31, 2020. Due to the significant impact of the 

misstatements on its financial statements, we rendered a Qualified Opinion on the 

financial statements of the agency as at year-end.  

Accounting deficiencies 

 

28. Accounting deficiencies which affected the reliability and accuracy of reported 
balances in the FS were also observed, as discussed in Table 5. 

 

 

 



 

33 
 

Table 5.  Summary of Accounting Deficiencies 

Deficiency Standard 

a. Non-classification by type 
of PPEs presented in the  
RPCPPE  

Section 42 of Chapter 10 of the GAM, Volume I, prescribed the use of the Report 
on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) to report the 
physical count and condition of PPE by type as at a given date, including those 
which are unrecorded and those which could not be accounted for. It shows the 
balance of PPE per property cards (PC) and per count and the shortage/overage, if 
any. It shall be rendered by the Inventory Committee, on its yearly physical count 
of properties owned by the entity. 

b. Delayed recording of 
depreciation 

Section 6, Chapter 2 of the GAM, Volume I, provides that each entity shall 
recognize and present its financial transactions and operations conformably to the 
basic principles of government accounting, one of which is the accrual basis of 
accounting. Accrual basis is defined as a basis of accounting under which 
transactions and other events are recognized when they occur (and not only when 
cash or its equivalent is received or paid). Therefore, the transactions and events 
are recognized in the accounting records and recognized in the financial 
statements of the periods to which they relate.  The elements recognized under 
accrual accounting are assets, liabilities, net assets/equity, revenue, and 
expenses. 
 
Section 27, Chapter 10 of the GAM, Volume I discussed that PPE gradually loses 
its ability to provide service over the course of time. Because of this, its cost needs 
to be distributed on a systematic basis over its useful life referred to as 
depreciation. Depreciation expense shall be recognized monthly. 

Section 2.1 of COA Circular No. 2004-003 dated October 4, 2004 provides that the 
computation of the depreciation expense shall start on the following month after 
the purchase/completion of the PPE, irrespective of the date within the month. 

c. Deficiencies in internal 
control/ accounting 
procedure in recording 
and posting financial 
transactions to the GL 

 

COA Circular No. 2018-003 dated November 21, 2018 prescribes the use of the 
Internal Control Standards for the Philippine Public Sector (ICSSPS). The ICSSPS 
provides guidelines on a broad framework, within which the internal control system 
of government agencies shall be built in and integrated with the basic management 
processes of planning, executing, and monitoring.  

Section 12, Chapter 2 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume I 
provides among others the preparation of the following books of accounts: 

a. General Journal (GJ) – journals for recording of transactions not recorded in 
the Special Journals (SJs).  

b. Check Disbursement Journal (CkDJ) – a special journal used to record the 
disbursements through checks. 

c. Cash Disbursement Journal (CDJ) – a special journal used to record the 
disbursements made by the disbursing officer. 

d. Advice to Debit Account Disbursement Journal (ADADJ) – a special journal 
used to record the disbursement through List of Due and Demandable 
Accounts Payable- ADA (LDDAP-ADA). 

e. General Ledger (GL) – ledger which summarizes all transactions recorded in 
the GJ and SJs. 

 

 



 

34 
 

a. Non-classification/presentation by type of PPE  in the RPCPPE 

29. The format of RPCPPE prescribed by the GAM requires the presentation of PPE 
by type of PPE account name. Perusal of the RPCPPE submitted by Management, 

however, showed that all the PPEs were not grouped/classified by type; thus, precluding 

an easier reconciliation of the books maintained by the Accountant and the 

Supply/Property Officer.  

30. Moreover, the non-classification of PPE as to type of PPE account name in the 
RPCPPE is not in keeping with established internal control systems to account for PPE 

and Section 42, Chapter 10 of the GAM, Volume I. 

b. Delayed recording of depreciation 
 

31. The Agency procured a Unifi USG-PRO-4 for Wifi System in the amount of 
P309,200.00 on March 4, 2020 and classified in the books of accounts as Technical and 

Scientific Equipment. Audit disclosed that depreciation for the said item was not provided 

monthly, contrary to Section 27, Chapter 10 of the GAM, Volume I; rather, as a practice, 

a year-end entry is made for the provision of the depreciation for the year.   

32. While the delays noted in recording the afore-cited transactions may not have 
affected the year-end balance of the PPE account because the depreciation was recorded 

at year-end, it certainly affected the balances in the quarterly financial statements 

prepared for purposes of Management decision-making. 

c. Deficiencies in internal control/accounting procedure in the recording and 
posting of financial transactions to the GL 

33. Internal control system refers to an agency’s whole system or network of 
methods, procedures, and plans which govern its activities to accomplish its goals and 

objectives.  

34. The ICSPPS treats internal control as an integral process that is effected by an 
agency’s management and personnel, and is designed to address risks and to provide 

reasonable assurance that in pursuit of the agency’s mission, the general objectives are 

being achieved. 

35. Perusal of the Instructions in the preparation of each book required in Section 12, 
Chapter 2 of the GAM, Volume I disclosed that the entries to the General Ledger (GL) 

and SJs shall be made only on the bases of duly approved Journal Entry Vouchers 

(JEVs). Said entries shall be posted individually to the General Ledger (GL).  Hence, the 

posting to the GL shall be made directly from the journals. Both GJ and SJs have a “P” 

column which refers to posting reference wherein one can place a check mark to indicate 

completion of posting to the appropriate GL account.   

36. Instead of the GJ and SJ, the GL was prepared based on the JEV which is the 
source reference indicated in the “Reference” column of GL. Moreover, instead of 

ADADJ, the CDJ was prepared to record the disbursements through LDDAP-ADA when 



 

35 
 

the Agency’s transactions are made through checks or ADAs only, except for the petty 

cash fund (PCF). 

37. Non-compliance with the accounting procedures prescribed in the GAM 
pertaining to the recording and posting of the financial transactions may compromise the 

measures aimed by the Manual in ensuring the accuracy and completeness in recording of 

the said transactions. 

38. We have observed that while the Accounting personnel do understand their 
respective duties/responsibilities, they do not have a clear understanding of the 

Accounting Information System, the relevant aspects of internal control, how their roles 

fit into it, and how their work relates to the work of others.  

39. Although the Stock Cards (SCs) showed the ending balance as at December 31, 
2019, we noted that the entries made therein started only on October 16, 2019 as its 

beginning balance, thus, the SCs did not show the entries/postings for the movements of 

inventories before the said date. 

40. Management has no quality control which provides visual documentation of 
critical processes via flowchart other than the issued unnumbered NPC Memorandum 

dated March 20, 2017 pertaining to the Flowchart on Processing of Payment and 

Guidelines and Documentary Requirements for Common Government Transactions.  

 

41. Guidelines for ICSPPS defined Flowchart as a diagrammatic representation of the 
client’s documents and records, and the sequence in which they are processed. Flow-

charting illustrates a flow of procedures, information or documents. This technique 

makes it possible to give a summary description of complex circuits or procedures.  

42. Flowcharts would have helped the Accounting personnel and users of Accounting 
Information System to understand the step sequences of accounting processes. It will 

show how information flows from source documents through the accounting records. 

d. Other deficiencies 

43. Other reconciling items were noted between the NPC and PS-DBM records 
representing tickets booked/issued from June 1 to 15, 2019 amounting to P31,080.54 

which was replenished by the NPC but not recognized by PS-DBM;  and cost of tickets 

amounting to P42,343.25 charged from PAL credit line on November 6, 2018 but 

subsequently credited/returned to the PAL account on January 9, 2019. No SI or any 

document could be found by the Accounting to support the transaction.  

44. Although the errors in the books of PS-DBM for the amount of P31,080.54 and 
P42,343.25 may have no effect in the books of account of NPC, this should still be

Other Compliance Issues 

 

Gender and Development (GAD) 

 

47. Section 31 of the General Provisions of the General Appropriations Act for FY 
2020 states that all agencies of the government shall formulate a Gender and 

Development (GAD) Plan designed to address gender issues within their concerned 

sectors or mandate and implement the applicable provisions under RA 9710 or the Magna 

Carta of Women, Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against 

Women, the Beijing Platform for Action, the Philippine Plan for Gender-Responsive 

Development (1995-2025) and the Philippines Development Plan (2017-2022). It also 

provides that the GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of the agencies, 

which shall be at least five percent (5%) of their budgets for activities which relate to 

GAD. For this purpose, activities currently being undertaken by agencies which shall 

relate to GAD or those that contribute to poverty alleviation, economic empowerment 

especially of marginalized women, protection, promotion and fulfillment of women’s 



 

37 
 

human rights, and practice of gender-responsive governance are considered sufficient 

compliance with said requirement.  Utilization of GAD budget shall be evaluated based 

on the GAD performance indicators identified by said agencies. The preparation and 

submission of the annual GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) and annual GAD 

Accomplishment Report (AR) shall be subject to the guidelines issued by the agencies 

concerned. 

 

48. NPC had not implemented fully its GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) with total 
budget of ₱37,195,772.00, constituting 15.85 percent of the total agency budget of 

₱234,688,000.00 with only ₱9,651,709.54 or 25.95 percent of the total allocated budget 

for GAD spent for GAD-related projects mainstreamed in the regular activities of the 

NPC. 

 

49. We recommended and Management agreed to maximize utilization of GAD 
allocated budget to uplift the gender issues of employees as well as the 

implementation of the planned programs and activities. 

 

Programs and Projects for Senior Citizens and Persons with Disability (PWD) 

 

50. The National Privacy Commission has no allocated budget for Senior Citizens 
and PWD, as required under Section 32 of the general provisions of Fiscal Year 2020 

General Appropriations Act.

government shall formulate plans, programs and projects intended to address the 

concerns of SCs and PWDs, insofar as its relates to their mandated functions, and 

integrate the same in their regular activities. It further requires that all government 

infrastructure and facilities shall provide architectural or structural features, designs or 

facilities that will reasonably enhance the mobility, safety and welfare of the persons with 

disability pursuant to Batas Pambansa (BP) Blg. 344 and RA 7277.   
 

52. Records showed that the NPC has not allocated budget nor formulated programs 
addressing the concerns of senior citizens and persons with disabilities. Nevertheless, it is 

noted that the location of the NPC Office has available architectural facilities or structural 

features and designs that can reasonably enhance the mobility, safety and welfare of 

senior citizens and PWDs.  
 

53. In view of the above, we recommended and Management agreed to include in 
its plans and budget the projects and activities that will help address the concerns of 

Senior Citizens and PWDs.
