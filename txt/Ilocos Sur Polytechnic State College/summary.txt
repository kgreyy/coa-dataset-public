D. Scope of Audit 
 

 The audit covered the accounts and operations of the ISPSC, Sta. Maria, Ilocos Sur 

for CY 2020. The audit was conducted to: a) ascertain the level of assurance that may be 

placed on the Management’s assertion on the financial statements; b) determine the 

propriety of transactions as well as extent of compliance on the applicable laws, rules and 

regulations; c) recommend agency’s improvement opportunities; and d) determine the 

extent of implementation of prior years’ audit recommendations. The audit was conducted 

in accordance with International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAIs). 



 

 
 

E. Auditor’s Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 

The Auditor rendered an unmodified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the 

financial statements of ISPSC as at December 31, 2020. 

 

F. Summary of Significant Observations and Recommendations 
 

The following are the significant audit observations and the corresponding 

recommendations, which were discussed during the exit conference with Management 

officials concerned held on February 23, 2021, details of which are discussed in Part II of 

this report. Management views and comments were incorporated in the report, where 

appropriate. 

   

1. One asset and four liability accounts with total year-end balances of ₱3,395,407.00 
and ₱24,000,542.75, respectively, were not supported with detailed schedules while 

Aging Schedule of Payables was not presented with details per account as required 

under Section 111(1) of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 and Section 6 (e ) (j),  

Chapter 19 of Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government 

Agencies (NGAs), Volume I, casting doubts on the reliability, completeness and 

accuracy of affected accounts’ balances. 

 

We recommended that Management direct the Accountant to cause the preparation 

and maintenance of updated detailed schedules of said accounts and detailed Aging 

Schedule of Payables in conformity with Section 111(1) of PD No. 1445 and 

Section 6 (e) (j), Chapter 19 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I. 

 

2. Timelines, processes and procedures prescribed under RA No. 9184 and its Revised 
Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) were not strictly observed in the 14 

procurement transactions of the College aggregating, ₱106,497,719.82 thereby, 

defeating the principles of transparency, competitiveness, and accountability in 

government procurement.  

 

We recommended Management to require the Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) 

Chair, Heads of the Technical Working Group (TWG) and BAC Secretariat to 

strictly observe the applicable provisions of RA No. 9184 and its IRR. 

 

3. Past due in the amount of ₱5,402,688.50 and dormant receivables in the amount of 
₱1,357,073.25 aggregating ₱6,759,761.75 remained outstanding for lack of 

intensified collection efforts by the College resulted in the deprivation by the 

College of much needed funds to support its operations. 

 

We recommended that Management: 

 

1. Require the Accounting Office to intensify its collection efforts through 
collection and demand letters to debtors; 

 



 

 
 

2. After collection efforts and remedies have been exhausted for dormant 
accounts, request for write-off in accordance with COA Circular No. 2016-005 

dated December 19, 2016, and 

 

3. Consider the inclusion of collection targets in the College’ Key Result Areas 
and Performance Commitment to reduce its outstanding Accounts Receivables. 

 
G. Status of Implementation of Prior Years’ Audit Recommendations 

 

Of the 34 audit recommendations embodied in the Prior Years’ Annual Audit 

Reports, 22 were implemented and 12 were not implemented. The details are presented in 

Part III of this Report.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT 

 

 

The President 

Ilocos Sur Polytechnic State College 

Sta. Maria, Ilocos Sur 

 

Opinion 

 

We have audited the financial statements of the ISPSC, Sta. Maria, Ilocos Sur, which 

comprise the Statement of Financial Position as at December 31, 2020 and the Statement 

of Financial Performance, Statement of Changes in Net Assets/Equity, Statement of Cash 

Flows, and Statement of Comparison of Budget and Actual Amounts for the year then 

ended, and Notes to the Financial Statements, including a summary of significant 

accounting policies. 

 

In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material 

respects, the Financial Position of the ISPSC as at December 31, 2020, and its Financial 

Performance, Statement of Cash Flows, Statement of Changes in Assets/Equity, Statement 

of Comparison of Budget and Actual Amounts for the year then ended, and Notes to the 

Financial Statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies in 

accordance with International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSASs). 

 

Basis for Opinion 

 

We conducted our audit in accordance with ISSAIs. Our responsibilities under those 

standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 

Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the agency in accordance 

with the Revised Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Commission on Audit 

Officials and Employees (Code of Ethics) together with the ethical requirements that are 

relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the Philippines, and we have fulfilled 

our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and Code of Ethics. 

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide 

a basis for our opinion. 

 

Key Audit Matters 

 

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most 

significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters 

were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in 

forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. 



 

 
 

Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the 

Financial Statements 
 

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial 

statements in accordance with IPSASs, and for such internal control as management 

determines as necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from 

material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
 

Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the College’ financial 

reporting process.  

 

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements 
 

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements 

as a whole are free from material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue 

an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is high level of 

assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISSAIs will 

always detect a material misstatement when it exists.  Misstatements can arise from fraud 

or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably 

be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 

financial statements.

IPSAS issued by the Commission on Audit as per COA Resolution No. 2014-003 

dated January 24, 2014. 

 

The financial statements have been prepared on the basis of historical cost, unless 

stated otherwise and presented in Philippine Peso, which is the reporting currency, 

unless specifically disclosed. The currency symbol “₱” is used in the financial 

statements. The Statement of Cash flows is prepared using the direct method.

3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
 

3.1. Basis of Accounting 
 

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on an accrual basis 

in accordance with the IPSAS. 

 

The College derives funds for its operations from different fund sources, as 

follows: 

 

Sources of Funds Fund Book 

Regular Agency Fund (GAA) Fund 01 (GF – 101) 

Internally Generated Funds (Use of Income) Fund 05 (UI – 164) 

Business Related Funds (Income Generating Projects) Fund 06 (IGP – 161) 

Trust Receipts Fund 07 (TF – 184) 

 

3.2. Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and cash at bank, deposits on 

call and highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or 

less, which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are subject to 

insignificant risk of changes in value.  For the purpose of the consolidated 

statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-

term deposit as defined above, net of outstanding overdrafts. 

 

3.3. Inventories 
 

Inventories are measured using the weighted average cost method.  Inventories 

are recognized as expense when issued for utilization or consumption in the 

ordinary course of operations of ISPSC. 

 

3.4. Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) 
 

Recognition 

 

An item is recognized as PPE if it meets the characteristics and recognition 

criteria as a PPE.  It is measured at cost at date of acquisition. 

 

After recognition, all PPE are stated at cost less Accumulated Depreciation and 

Impairment Losses. 

 

When significant parts of PPE are required to be replaced at intervals, the 

ISPSC recognizes such parts as individual assets with specific useful lives and 

depreciates them accordingly.  Likewise, when a major repair/replacement is 

done, its cost is recognized in the carrying amount of the plant and equipment 

as a replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied. 



 

12 
 

All other repair and maintenance costs are recognized as expense in surplus or 

deficit as incurred. 

 

Depreciation 
 

Each part of an item of PPE with a cost that is significant in relation to the total 

cost of the item is depreciated separately. 

 

The depreciation charge for each period is recognized as expense unless it is 

included in the cost of another asset. 

 

Initial Recognition of Depreciation 

 

Depreciation of an asset begins when it is avaliable for use such as when it is in 

the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the 

manner intended by management. 

 

For simplicity and to avoid proportionate computation, the depreciation is for 

one month if the PPE is available for use on or before the 15th day of the month.  

However if PPE is available for use after the 15th day of the month, depreciation 

is for the succeeding month. 

 

Depreciation Method 

 

The ISPSC adopted the straight-line method of depreciation. 

 

Estimated Useful Life 

 

The ISPSC is guided by the Schedule of Estimated Life of PPE by classification 

prepared by COA. 

 

It uses a residual value equivalent to ten percent (10%) of the cost of PPE. 

 

Impairment 
 

An asset’s carrying amount is written down to its recoverable amount, or 

recoverable service amount, if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its 

estimated recoverable service amount. 

 

Derecognition 

 

The ISPSC derecognizes items of PPE and/or significant part of an asset upon 

disposal or when no future economic benefits or service potential is expected 

from its continuing use.  Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset 

(calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying 

amount of the asset) is included in the surplus or deficit when the asset is 

derecognized. 



 

13 
 

3.5. Revenue from Exchange Transactions 
 

Measurement of Revenue 
 

Revenue was measured at the fair value of the consideration received or 

receivable. 

 

Rendering of Services  

 

The ISPSC recognizes revenue from rendering services by reference to the stage 

or completion of the semester for which the tuition fees are collected. The stage 

of completion is measured by reference to number of months incurred to date 

as a percentage of total months in a semester. 

 

3.6. Budget Information 
 

The annual budget is prepared on a cash basis and is published in the ISPSC 

website. 

 

A separate Statement of Comparison of Budget and Actual Amounts (SCBAA) 

was prepared since the budget and the financial statements were not prepared 

on comparable basis.  The SCBAA was presented showing the original and final 

budget and the actual amounts on comparable basis to the budget.  Explanatory 

comments are provided on the notes to the annual financial statements. 

 

The annual budget figures included in the financial statements pertain only to 

the budget of ISPSC as it has no controlled entities. 

 

3.7. Impairment of Non-Cash Generating Assets 
 

The ISPSC assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that a 

non-cash generating asset may be impaired.  If any indication exists or when an 

annual impairment testing is required, the ISPSC estimates the asset’s 

recoverable service amount.  An asset’s recoverable service amount is the 

higher of the non-cash generating asset’s fair value less costs to sell and its 

value in use. 

 

When the carrying amount of an assets exceeds its recoverable service amount, 

the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable service 

amount.  The ISPSC classifies assets as cash–generating assets when those 

assets were held with the primary objective of generating a commercial return.  

Therefore, non-cash generating assets would be those assets from which the 

ISPSC does not intend (as its primary objective) to realize a commercial return. 

 

 

 

 



 

14 
 

3.8. Employee Benefits 
 

The employees of the ISPSC are members of the Government Service Insurance 

System (GSIS), which provide life and retirement insurance coverage. 

 

ISPSC recognizes the undiscounted amount of short term employee benefits, 

like salaries, wages, bonuses, allowances, etc., as expense unless capitalized, 

and as a liability after deducting the amount paid. 

 

The College recognizes expenses for accumulating compensated absences 

when these were paid (commuted or paid as terminal leave benefits). Unused 

entitlements that has accumulated at the reporting date were not recognized as 

expense. Non-accumulating compensated absences, like special leave 

privileges, were not recognized. 

 

3.9. Measurement Uncertainty 
 

The preparation of financial statement in conformity with the IPSAS, requires 

management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reporting 

amounts of assets and liabilites, and disclosure of continget assets and 

liabilities, at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of 

the revenues and expenses during the period.  Items requiring use of significant 

estimates include useful life of capital assets, estimated employee benefits, rates 

for amortization, impairment of assets, and estimated uncollectible accounts, 

etc. 

 

Estimates are based on the best information available at the time of preparation 

of the financial statements and were reviewed annually to reflect new 

information as it becomes available.  Measurement uncertainty exists in these 

financial statements.  Actual results could differ from these estimates.

OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

 

A. Financial Audit 
 

Absence of Detailed Schedules on Five Accounts - ₱3,395,407.00 and ₱24,000,542.75 

 

1. One asset and four liability accounts with total year-end balances of ₱3,395,407.00 
and ₱24,000,542.75, respectively, were not supported with detailed schedules 

while the Aging Schedule of Payables was not presented with details per account 

as required under Section 111(1) of PD No.1445 and Section 6 (e) (j), Chapter 19 

of GAM for NGAs, Volume I, casting doubts on the reliability, completeness and 

accuracy of affected accounts’ balances. 

 

Section 111(1) of PD No. 1445 provides that: 

 

The accounts of an agency shall be kept in such detail as is 

necessary to meet the needs of the agency and at the same time 

be adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or 

control agencies of the government. 

 

Section 6 (e) (j), Chapter 19 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I provides the 

following: 

 

Qualitative Characteristics of Financial Reporting. An entity 

shall present information including accounting policies in a 

manner that meets the following qualitative characteristics 

enumerated in PPSAS1 

 

e. Reliability - reliable information is free from material error 
and bias and can be depended on by users to represent 

faithfully that which it purports to represent or could 

reasonably be expected to represent. 

 

j. Completeness - the information in financial statements 
should be complete within the bounds of materiality and 

cost. 

 

Review of the Statement of Financial Position as at December 31, 2020 

revealed, that one asset account with total balance of ₱3,395,407.00 and four liability 

accounts with total balance of ₱24,000,542.75 were not supported with detailed 

schedules, as shown in the table below:

Basing from the above table, the percentage of asset and liability accounts not 

supported with detailed schedules were 0.60 percent and 27.01 percent, respectively. 

 

Further, it was also noted that the Aging Schedule of Payables was not 

supported with detailed schedules as it reflected only the aggregate balances of each 

type of payable account, instead of presenting in detail the name of creditors, along 

with the date of incurrence of each individual account, hence, prevented the conduct of 

further analysis of said liability accounts specifically those aged over three years in the 

aggregate amount of ₱48,252.49. 

 

 The table below shows the aging of each payable account for all funds which 

are considered past due for over one year to more than three years with no detailed 

individual accounts in the aggregate amount of ₱3,1333,345.33:

 Non-preparation/submission of detailed schedules to support five account 

balances in the books of the College casts doubts on the reliability, completeness and 

accuracy of account balances reflected in the financial statements. 

 

The responsibility for ensuring that financial information are kept in adequate 

detail for the needs of the agency as well as other controlling agencies rests with 

Management. To achieve such, all financial data presented need to be complete, 

accurate and reliable. Moreover, financial reports are based on official records 

maintained under an adequate accounting system that produces information objectively 

and adequately.  

 

We recommended that Management direct the Accountant to cause the 

preparation and maintenance of updated detailed schedules of said accounts and 



 

29 
 

detailed Aging Schedule of Payables in conformity with Section 111(1) of PD No. 

1445 and Section 6 (e) (j), Chapter 19 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I. 

 

During the exit conference, Management commented that supporting schedules 

and explanatory notes were already submitted to the Audit Team for evaluation and 

assured that the Accounting Office will continue to exert its effort to maintain/prepare 

schedules to support the financial statements. 

 

However, upon review of submitted schedules as of writing date, the required 

detailed schedules of above accounts and Aging Schedule of Payables remained 

unsubmitted. 

 

 

Unrecorded Receivables and Rental Income - ₱1,138,455.00 

 

2. Income from rental fees in the total amount of ₱1,138,455.00 were not recognized 
and accrued as of December 31, 2020 which was not in conformity with applicable 

provisions of Sections 2(a) and 6(b) of Chapter 2 and Sections 2(c) and 5, Chapter 

7 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I, resulting in the corresponding understatement of 

the Accounts Receivable and Rent Income accounts by such amount. 
 

GAM for NGAs, Volume I, provides the following applicable provisions in the 

recognition of revenue in the books: 

 

Accrual basis – means a basis of accounting under which 

transactions and other events are recognized when they occur 

(and not only when cash or its equivalent is received or paid). 

Therefore, the transactions and events are recognized in the 

accounting records and recognized in the financial statements of 

the periods to which they relate. The elements recognized under 

accrual accounting are assets, liabilities, net assets/equity, 

revenue, and expenses (Section 2(a), Chapter 2) 

 

Each entity shall recognize and present its financial transactions 

and operations conformably to the following: a. xxx b. accrual 

basis of accounting in accordance with the PPSA[S]; (Section 

6(b), Chapter 2) 

 

Financial instrument – is any contract that gives rise to both a 

financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity 

instrument of another entity (Section 2(c), Chapter 7) 

  

Initial Recognition of Financial Asset. An entity shall recognize 

a financial asset in its statement of financial position when it 

becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. 

(Section 5, Chapter 7) 



 

30 
 

One of the Income Generating Projects (IGPs) of the University is the 

lease/rental of its commercial building, stalls, College canteen and cottages. In CY 

2020, there were 13 lessees of stalls, commercial building and College Canteen, and 18 

employee-occupants of the College’ cottages, of which, business of four lessees have 

ceased to operate. 

 

Audit and review of contracts and individual subsidiary ledgers maintained by 

the Resource Generation Office of the College, however, disclosed an aggregate 

amount of unpaid rentals of ₱989,955.00 after having waived rental fees on stalls, 

commercial building and College Canteen during the Enhanced Community 

Quarantine period caused by COVID-19 pandemic, and 50 percent reduction of their 

monthly rentals for the period June to December 2020 under Modified/General 

Community Quarantine. As regards the occupants of the cottages, the total unpaid 

rentals amounted to ₱148,500.00. Thus, the total unpaid rental fees aggregated 

₱1,138,455.00, broken down as follows: 

 

Rental Fees 
                    Amount 

                    (₱) 

Stalls, Commercial Building, College’ Canteen 989,955.00 

Cottages 148,500.00 

Total 1,138,455.00 

 

Conversely, review of Receivables account under the IGP Fund showed that 

unpaid rentals were not accrued as of year-end. 

 

Further inquiry with the Accountant revealed, that the Accounting Office only 

records Rent Income upon collection of payments, adopting a cash basis of accounting 

which contradicts the accrual basis of accounting and was not in conformity with the 

above provisions of Sections 2(a) and 6(b) of Chapter 2 and Sections 2(c) and 5, 

Chapter 7 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I, resulting in the corresponding understatement 

of Accounts Receivable and Rent Income accounts by ₱1,138,455.00.       

  

We recommended that Management: 
 

1. Require the Head of Accounting Office to draw a journal entry voucher 
(JEV) to recognize Accounts Receivable due from lessees and 

occupants and Accumulated Surplus/Deficit  in its books of accounts; 

 

2. Instruct the OIC-Director of the Resource Generation Office to furnish 
the Accounting Office copies of contracts, as basis for recording 

accruals as well as preparing/maintaining subsidiary accounts, and 

 

3. Henceforth, strictly adopt accrual basis in recording income to conform 
with Sections 2(a) and 6(b) of Chapter 2 and Sections 2(c) and 5, 

Chapter 7 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I.

During the exit conference, the Audit Team requested the OIC - Director to 

submit needed data to update computation. It was admitted by the IGP Director that 

payments were not regularly made on a monthly basis and that no notice of increase 

were issued to inform the lessees since they assumed that the latter were aware of such 

as it was stipulated in their contracts. They already furnished copies of contracts to 

lessees who lost theirs and that they are willing to pay such balances. The Management 

is considering the review of these contracts. 

 

 

B. Compliance Audit 
 

Non-compliance with RA No. 9184 and its Revised IRR in the Conduct of Procurements 

 

3. Timelines, processes and procedures prescribed under RA No. 9184 and its 
Revised IRR were not strictly observed in the 14 procurement transactions of the 

College aggregating, ₱106,497,719.82 thereby, defeating the principles of 

transparency, competitiveness, and accountability in government procurement.  

 

Section 3 of RA No. 9184 and its Revised IRR provides the governing 

principles on government procurement which requires transparency in the procurement 

process and in the implementation of contracts; competitiveness by extending equal 

opportunity to enable private contracting parties who are eligible and qualified to 

participate in public bidding; streamlined procurement process that will uniformly 

apply to all government. The procurement process shall be simple and made adaptable 

to advances in modern technology in order to ensure an effective and efficient method.  

 

We reviewed the contracts and other related documents of 14 projects, 

composing of nine infrastructure projects and five procurement of goods aggregating 

₱106,497,719.82, and noted the following deficiencies: 

 

Deficiency Pertinent Provision of RA No. 9184 and its Revised IRR 

Pre-bid conference and posting of Invitation to 

Bid (ITB) were scheduled although the Bill of 

Quantities and Design were not yet completed, 

thus, the objectives of pre-procurement 

conference of determining the readiness of the 

procurement was not achieved. 

 

 

Unnecessary information posted in the ITB for 

the Remarks stated, “Opening of bids to be 

postponed to allow more time for bidders to 

comply with the requirements” showed that 

procurement schedule adopted was not properly 

reviewed.

Non-observance of timelines, processes and procedures as provided under RA 

No. 9184 and its Revised IRR defeated the principles of transparency, competitiveness, 

and accountability in government procurement. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the BAC Chair, 

Heads of TWG and BAC Secretariat to strictly observe the applicable provisions 

of RA No. 9184 and its IRR. 

 

 

Incomplete Documentation of Payments of Infrastructure Contracts-₱53,349,584.70 
 

4. Progress and final payments on six Infrastructure Projects of the College with 
contract cost aggregating ₱53,349,584.70 were not supported with complete 

documentation as required under Section 4(6), PD No. 1445, Section 9.1.1 of COA 

Circular No. 2012-001, Section 2.2.3 of COA Circular No. 2014-004,  

and Section 3.1.3 of COA Circular No. 2009-001, casting doubts on the validity 

and regularity of the transactions.  

 

Section 4(6) of PD No. 1445 requires that “Claims against government funds 

shall be supported with complete documentation.” 

 

Section 9.1.1 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 provides the 

documentary requirements to support for infrastructure projects procured through 

public bidding (advance payment, variation order/change order/extra work 

order, progress payment, final payment and release of retention money), and under 

negotiated procurement-adjacent or contiguous. 

 

Section 2.2.3 of COA Circular No. 2014-004 dated January 30, 2013 requires 

that “For infrastructure projects, a tarpaulin signboard must be suitable framed for 

outdoor display at the project location, and shall be posted as soon as the award has 

been mad[e].” 

 

Section 3.1.3 of COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009 states 

that “For technical review purposes, submission of contracts and their supporting 

documents shall furthermore be guided by the specific documentary 

requirements outlined in the attached checklist marked as Annexes “A” to “T” of  

this Circular.” Under Annex “E” of said Circular, entitled Checklist for Technical 

Evaluation of Infrastructure Projects and Consulting Services Time Extension 

Evaluation requires, among others, the approved time extension and copy of the 

approved revised PERT/CPM Network Diagram reflecting the effect of the subject time 

extension on the original contract time and all previously issued Time Extensions, 

Suspension/Resumption Orders. 

 

Post-audit of payments of six infrastructure projects with contract cost 

aggregating ₱53,349,584.70 procured through public bidding and negotiated 

procurement–adjacent or contiguous showed that the required documentary 

requirements prescribed under Section 4(6) of PD No. 1445, Section 9.1.1 of COA 



 

35 
 

Circular No. 2012-001, Section 2.2.3 of COA Circular No. 2014-004 and Section 3.1.3 

of COA Circular No. 2009-001 were not submitted.  

 

Moreover, it was noted that the common supporting documents not attached to 

disbursements are the following: 

 

 For procurement through public bidding: 
 

o Progress and/or final payments 
Pictures taken before, during and after construction; contractor’s 

affidavit of payment of laborers and materials; photocopy of 

Disbursement Voucher (DV) of all previous payments; picture of 

billboard; and approved request for time extension or suspension and 

resumption orders supporting the shutdown days due to weather 

 

o Variation Order 
Copy of the approved original plans indicating the affected portion (s) 

of the project and duly revised plans and specifications, if applicable, 

indicating the changes made which shall be color coded. 

 

 For adjacent/contiguous projects  
Latest Accomplishment Report of the original contract showing that there 

was no negative slippage/delay 

 

In view of the above, the validity and regularity of the transactions amounting 

to ₱53,349,584.70 were doubtful. 

 

We recommended that Management instruct the Head of Accounting 

Office/Director of Infrastructure Planning and Monitoring to submit the lacking 

documents and ensure that succeeding payments of infrastructure project 

transactions were supported with complete documents in adherence to Section 

4(6), PD No. 1445, Section 9.1.1 of COA Circular No. 2012-001, Section 2.2.3 of 

COA Circular No. 2014-004 and Section 3.1.3 of COA Circular No. 2009-001. 
 

During the exit conference, the SUC President informed the Audit Team that 

he assigned the Internal Control Office to check the completeness of documents 

attached to DV and assured the Audit Team their strict compliance with our audit 

recommendations in the payments of current and future projects of the College. They 

also committed to submit the needed documents upon return of the former Director for 

Physical, Plant and Facilities who has the custody of the needed documents.  

 

The Audit Team requested the immediate submission of such documents, 

otherwise, we shall be constrained to issue the necessary Notices of Suspension.

Titles of Three Projects Inconsistent with Scopes of Work - ₱23,775,885.68 

 

5. Three Repair and Renovation Projects of the College aggregating ₱23,775,885.68 
were programmed with scopes of work categorized as Construction inconsistent 

with Section 106, IRR of PD No. 1096, casting doubts on the validity and regularity 

of said Projects. 

 

Section 106 of the IRR of PD No. 1096, known as the National Building Code 

of the Philippines defined, among others, the following terms: 

 

CONSTRUCTION – All on-site work done in the site 

preparation, excavation, foundation, assembly of all the 

components and installation of utilities, machineries and 

equipment of buildings/structures. 

 

RENOVATION – Any physical change made on 

buildings/structures to increase the value, quality, and/or to 

improve the aesthetic.  

 

REPAIR – Remedial work done on any damaged or deteriorated 

portion/s of building/structure to restore to its original condition. 

 

Auditorial contract review of three infrastructure projects with aggregate 

contract price of ₱23,775,885.68 revealed that the scopes of work programmed 

particularly, Structure Excavation, Embankment, Gravel Bedding, Demolition of 

Existing Structure, Site Clearing and Preparation are applicable only to “construction” 

works and not to “repair and renovation” works.  Details of the scopes of “repair and 

renovation” projects implemented are shown below:

Above data proved are beyond the scopes of “repair and renovation” projects, 

inconsistent with Section 106 of the IRR of PD No. 1096, casting doubts on the validity 

and regularity of said projects. 

 

We recommended that Management instruct the Head of Physical Plant 

and Facilities, TWG for Infrastructure Projects and BAC Chair to use 

appropriate titles and/or nomenclature in creating Infrastructure Project 

Titles/Names and ensure that such is consistent with the scopes of work as defined 

under Section 106 of the IRR of PD No. 1096.  

 

During the exit conference, the SUC President commented that there was a year 

where DBM does not approve projects which are construction unless the project was 

renovation, repair or continuation of existing projects, which in his knowledge was the 

reason why such titles were used instead of construction. However, the Audit Team 

informed Management that such claim was not true as it was stated by one of the 

officials of the DBM that construction is allowed, only it was the least priority, among 

other projects. 

 

Management was advised to determine from the beginning the courses of action 

and their needs in order to prevent such.   

   

Management was informed that the request for technical inspection could not 

yet be made since the needed documents for technical evaluation pertaining to such 

projects were still lacking/unsubmitted.

Deficiencies in the Procurement of Infrastructure Works - ₱5,377,191.67 

 

6. The procurement of two “additional infrastructure works” in the aggregate 
amount of ₱5,377,191.67 through Negotiated Procurement-Adjacent/Contiguous 

modality was not in accordance with the conditions warranting the use of such 

modality as prescribed under Section 53.4  of the 2016 Revised IRR of RA No. 

9184, and non-submission of complete contract documents required under  

Section 3.1.1 of COA Circular No. 2009 - 001 prevented complete evaluation by 

the Audit Team of said Projects, casting doubts on the legality and regularity of 

subject procurement transactions. 

 

Section 53 of the 2016 Revised IRR of RA No. 9184 prescribes: 

 

Negotiated Procurement is a method of procurement of Goods, 

Infrastructure Projects and Consulting Services, whereby the 

Procuring Entity directly negotiates a contract with a 

technically, legally and financially capable supplier, contractor 

or consultant in any of the following cases: 

 

Xxx 

53.4 Adjacent or Contiguous. Where the subject contract is 

adjacent or contiguous to an ongoing Infrastructure Projec[t]: 

Provided, however, That (f) the contractor/consultant has no 

negative slippage/delay: Provided, further, That negotiations for 

the procurement of the contiguous or adjacent work are 

commenced before the expiry of the original contract.  

 

Moreover, Section 3.1.1 of COA Circular No. 2009 -001 dated February 12, 

2009, otherwise known as the Restatement with Amendment of COA Circular No. 87-

278 and COA Memorandum No. 2005-027 re: submission of copy of government 

contracts, purchase orders and their supporting documents to the Commission on Audit 

states: 

 

Within five (5) working days from the execution of a contract 

by the government or any of its subdivisions, agencies or 

instrumentalities, including government-owned and controlled 

corporations and their subsidiaries, a copy of said contract and 

each of all the documents forming part thereof by reference or 

incorporation shall be furnished to the Auditor of the agency 

concerned. 

   

The College entered into two separate contracts for “additional works” where 

subject contracts are adjacent or contiguous to ongoing Infrastructure Projects in the 

aggregate amount of ₱5,377,191.67 using the Negotiated Procurement – Adjacent / 

Contiguous modality, as presented in the table shown on the next page:

Total 5,377,191.67   

 

Review of available records, however, disclosed that the requirements for the 

adoption of said modality were not fully complied with as prescribed under Section 

53.4 of the 2016 Revised IRR of RA No. 9184, to wit:  

 

As regards Project Item No. 1 

 

 The Contractor already incurred negative slippages of 22.24 percent as of 
October 15, 2018 as determined from the Statement of Work Accomplished 

of the original contract supporting its first progress payment which the BAC 

failed to consider, instead, said procurement method was recommended by 

the BAC in its Resolution No. 2018-08 INFR dated November 22, 2018; 

 

 The revised targeted completion date of the Project based from the 
Statement of Time Elapsed was on December 21, 2019, however, 

negotiations were already made by Management in November 2018, instead 

of, before the expiration of the original contract, showing that 

negotiation/procurement was too early as there are additional scopes of 

work which needs to be finished before undertaking such. Examples of 

which are: build-up signages, toilet, painting and varnishing, doors and 

windows, and cement plaster finish. 

 

For Project Item No. 2 

 

 Negotiation with the Contractor and adoption of said modality by the BAC 
was made on December 3, 2018 was just a month after execution of the 

original contract of the above Project when its contract duration was 260 

calendar days, or expiration was July 13, 2019 which was also too early to 

negotiate. 

 

Furthermore, other supporting documents of the Contracts for the two 

Additional Works were not submitted which prevented the complete evaluation of the 

procurement process, to wit:

In view of the foregoing deficiencies, the legality and regularity of the above- 

procurement transactions were doubtful. 

 

We recommended that Management: 

 

1. Direct the BAC Chair and Head of TWG to ensure that the Contractor 
incurred no negative slippage/delay, and negotiations for the 

procurement of the contiguous or adjacent work are commenced 

before the expiry of the original contract before adopting Negotiated 

Procurement-Adjacent/Contiguous modality in accordance with the 

requirements of Section 53. 4 of The 2016 Revised IRR of RA No. 9184, 

and 

 

2. Require the BAC Secretary to submit the lacking documents of the two 
projects in adherence to Section 3.1.1 of COA Circular No. 2009 -001. 

 

During the exit conference, the Audit Team requested for the submission of the 

lacking documents to facilitate the request for technical inspection in which 

Management commented that the documents were in the custody of the former TWG, 

Head for Infrastructure Projects who is under lock down in his hometown due to Covid-

19 situation.

Invalid Payments of Salary and Bonus Differentials - ₱6,830,064.25 
 

7. The use of effectivity date of appointment as basis in computing for the payment 
of salary of 119 faculty members whose ranks were subject of reclassification was 

not in accordance with Sections 17 and 23, Rule VI of the 2017 Omnibus Rules on 

Appointments and Other Human Resource Actions (ORAOHRA) (Revised 2018), 

resulting in the overpayment of salary and bonus and GSIS RLIP differentials 

amounting to ₱6,830,064.25. 
 

 

Section 17, Rule VI, of the 2017 ORAOHRA (Revised 2018) provides, among 

others, to wit: 
 

1. If the appointee has taken his/her oath of office and assumed 
the duties of position, he/she shall be entitled to receive 

his/her salary at once without awaiting the 

approval/validation of his/her appointment by the 

Commissio[n]. 
 

2. The appointment of officials or employees who are on 
official leave of absence, training or scholarship grant, shall 

be effective upon assumption or upon return from official 

leave of absence, scholarship or training. 
 

Moreover, Section 23 of the same Rule states:  
 

The date of the actual assumption of duties of the appointees, as 

indicated in the Certification of Assumption to Duty (CS Form 

No. 4, Series of 2017), shall be the basis for the payment of 

his/her salary and determination of service rendered in the 

government[t]. 

 

Records showed that 119 faculty members were granted salary differentials 

covering the period July 1, 2019 to December 1, 2019 as a result of the 

reclassification/modification of their positions per National Budget Circular (NBC) No. 

461 – Seventh Evaluation. Said reclassification/modification was covered under DBM 

Notice of Organization, Staffing and Compensation Action (NOSCA) with Serial No. 

0102019-11-038 dated November 29, 2019 stating therein that Organization, Staffing 

Position and/or Compensation modifications were approved and effective not earlier 

than July 1, 2019. 

 

Clarification on the Effectivity Date of Appointments in SUCs based on the 

Implementation of NBC No. 461, CSC Resolution No. 2000052 dated January 21, 2020 

was issued which provides in the dispositive portion thereof the following: 

 

xxx, the Commission RESOLVES that the actual date of 

issuance of appointments shall be indicated below the signature 

of the appointing officer/authority in the appointment form, but 



 

42 
 

the effectivity of reclassification to faculty positions in the SUCs 

shall be on July 1, 2019 based on the implementation of NBC 

No. 461 pursuant to the Special Provision of the Miscellaneous 

Personnel Benefits Fund in RA No. 10924.  

xxx. 

 

Audit of payrolls and its supporting documents disclosed that the reckoning/cut-

off date used in computing for such salary adjustments was “July 1, 2019,” the 

effectivity date of reclassification stated in said CSC Resolution, instead of, “December 

1, 2019,” the date of actual assumption of duties and oaths of office taken and/or upon 

return from scholarship, inconsistent with Sections 17 and 23, Rule VI of the 2017 

ORAOHRA (Revised 2018). The appointments, certificates of actual assumption and 

oaths of office of the 119 subject faculty were all dated December 2, 2019. 

 

Between the dates laid down in CSC Resolution No. 2000052 and Sections 17 

and 23, Rule VI of the 2017 ORAOHRA, the Audit Team is of the stand, however, that 

the date per Sections 17 and 23, Rule VI of the 2017 ORAOHRA (Revised 2018) 

should prevail and be the basis for the payment of salary. After all, CSC Resolution 

No. 2000052 provides only for the date given to SUCs to effect 

reclassification/modification to faculty positions and not to be construed, otherwise, 

resulting in the overpayment of salary and bonus differentials, and GSIS RLIP covering 

the period July 1, 2019 to December 31, 2020 aggregating ₱6,830,064.25 broken down 

in the table below: 

 

No. of 

Faculty 
Period              Particulars 

Amount 

(₱) 

119 7/1/19 -12/1/19 Salary Differentials  4,692,527.27 

19 12/2/19-12/31/19 Salary and Year-End Bonus 

Differentials  216,335.57 

19 1/1/19-12/31/19 Salary, Year-End and Mid-Year 

Bonus Differentials, and GSIS 

RLIP 1,921,201.41 

Total   6,830,064.25 

  

We recommended that Management instruct its HRM Officer to ensure 

that the dates of acknowledgment of appointment, assumption to duties and oaths 

of office by appointees were the actual date such were undertaken, consistent with 

their DTRs, and to rectify and reconcile said documents with the date of actual 

return from study leave. Henceforth, strictly adhere with Sections 17 and 23, Rule 

VI of the 2017 ORAOHRA (Revised 2018). 

 

In their comments, Management justified that between the dates specified under 

Sections 17 and 23, Rule VI of the ORAOHRA (Revised 2018) and RA No. 10924, 

DBM NBC No. 461 and CSC Resolution No. 2000052, the second one should 

prevail, for it is a law as compared to a rule. Management also explained that July 1, 

2019 is not inconsistent with said provisions of ORAOHRA for the 3rd paragraph 



 

43 
 

of Section 17 of the same Rule provides “ [i]n no case shall an appointment take effect 

earlier than the date it was signed except in cases authorized by law” which itself has 

stated as an exception to the effectivity date is a law in the present case, 

DBM NBC No. 461 pursuant to the Special Provision of the Miscellaneous Personnel 

Benefits Fund in RA 10924 which stated an earlier effectivity date which was July 1, 

2019. Further, with the issuance of NOSCA from the DBM, it bolstered the fact that it 

was approved not earlier than July 1, 2019 and a fund was allocated for their salary 

differential.  

 

Moreover, the implementation of DBM NBC No. 461 7th Cycle covers the 

period July 1, 2013 to June 30, 2016 but it was only on August 30, 2019 that the CHED 

and DBM implemented the same. Likewise, it only involved increase in academic rank, 

but the duties of said faculty are the same with that of their previous rank, hence, it 

could be gleaned that the faculty members have always actually assumed their duties 

ever since the retroactivity of the NOSCA. 

 

As regards the case of the 19 scholars, they were in fact in full scholarship but 

were still given teaching loads as evidenced in their Scholarship Agreement and daily 

time records (DTRs), hence, their salary differential is due them and should not be 

presumed that due to their study leave, their positions are divested of them and are not 

entitled to their salaries.  

 

During the exit conference, the SUC President further explained that the 

issuance CSC Resolution expressly mandating July 1, 2019 as the effectivity date of  

appointment when initially, the appointments were signed on December 2, 2020 which 

was also the date of receipt of the NOSCA.  He also said that it would be unfair for the 

said faculty to be penalized for such as the December 2 date of appointment was already 

accepted until CSC issued Resolution No. 2000052.  In addition, DBM subsequently 

released an allotment for the payment of said differentials in which the College just 

followed the instructions of the two agencies and presumed regularity of the 

transactions. 

 

However, the Audit Team informed Management that we maintain our stand 

that under CSC rules, the reckoning period should be the date indicated by the 

appointee in the receipt portion of his/her appointment, Oath of Office and Notice of 

Assumption.  Also, the Audit Team informed them that Notice of Disallowance will be 

issued on this transaction and Management have the privilege to file an appeal before 

the Regional Director of COA. 

 

 

Payment of Per Diems Not in Accordance with DBM BC No. 2003-6 

 

8. Per diems in the total amount of ₱199,000.00 were paid to the members of a Search 
Committee, Secretariat, and the BOT for meetings and activities conducted 

beyond the scope and limitations prescribed under Sections 2, 3.1 and 3.2, DBM 

BC No. 2003-6, rendering the transactions irregular.  



 

44 
 

DBM BC No. 2003-6 dated September 29, 2003, otherwise known as the 

“Guidelines Relative to the Grant of Per Diems to Members of Collegial Bodies and 

Members of the Board of Regents/Trustees of State Universities and Colleges,” 

provides among others, the following: 
 

2.  The per diems authorized in this Circular shall apply to all 

members of collegial bodies covered by or following RA No. 

6758 or the SSL and members of the Board of 

Regents/Trustees of SUC[s]. 
 

xxx 
 

3.1 Collegial Body – a government entity composed of public 

and private sector members, the number and tenure of office 

of whom are determined by law, and are appointed by the 

President either on full-time, part-time or in an ex-officio 

capacity. 
 

3.2 Per Diem – amount granted to the chairperson and members 

of collegial bodies created by law for every attendance in a 

board meeting where there is a quorum. 

 

In the search for the College Presidency which became vacant due to the demise 

of the then President on September 1, 2019, a Search Committee and Secretariat, which 

are not deemed Collegial Bodies, were constituted.  

 

Audit of payrolls revealed that said Search Committee and Secretariat, 

composed of seven members were granted per diems for the seven meetings conducted 

in relation to the search for ISPSC President for the period February 15, 2020 to June 

19, 2020. Per meeting, the Chairman was paid ₱5,000.00; Committee Member was paid 

₱4,000.00, and Secretariat was paid ₱3,000.00 per member totaling ₱168,000.00. 

Further, in the validation of the documents of the applicants for ISPSC Presidency 

which was conducted twice (February 12, 2020 and June 2, 2020), the three members 

of the Secretariat were also paid per diems of ₱3,000.00 each per validation activity in 

the total amount of ₱18,000.00. 

 

As Search Committee and Secretariat are not considered Collegial Bodies, they 

are not entitled to per diems as contemplated under Sections 2 and 3.1 of DBM BC No. 

2003-6. 

 

On the part of the BOT, per diems in the total amount of ₱19,000.00 were 

granted to four members (Faculty/Student/National Economic and Development 

Authority (NEDA) Regional Director/Vice-Chairman) for ₱4,000.00 each and the 

Acting Board Secretary in the amount of ₱3,000.00 during the pre-board meeting 

conducted on March 5, 2020, in the absence of the required quorum.  Payment of their 

per diems to said pre-board meeting is not covered by Section 3.2, of said DBM BC 

No. 2003-6.   



 

45 
 

In view of the foregoing deficiencies, payments of per diems in the aggregate 

amount of ₱199,000.00 were deemed irregular, broken down as follows: 

 

Recipients Particulars 

Amount of Per 

Diem Paid 

₱ 

Search Committee and Secretariat  Search Committee meetings 162,000.00 

Secretariat Validation of documents 18,000.00 

BOT Vice-Chair, BOT Members, and 

Board Secretary 

Pre-board meeting 19,000.00 

Total  199,000.00 

 

We recommended that Management require the concerned recipients to 

refund the amounts of per diems granted to them. Henceforth, the guidelines 

relative to the grant of per diems to members of Collegial Bodies and members 

of the Board of Regents/Trustees as provided under DBM Circular No. 2003-6 

should be strictly adhered to. 

 

Management commented that the Search Committee for ISPSC Presidency was 

created by virtue of BOT Resolution No. 85-1123, s. 2019 pursuant to Section 4 of 

CMO No. 16, s. 2009. It was further justified that said Resolution also approved for the 

₱300,000.00 budget to cover all related expenses incurred by the Committee wherein 

the budget was sourced from the Use of Income and not from the General 

Appropriations Act (GAA). Although the Committee is not a collegial body as 

prescribed and defined under DBM BC No. 2003-6, it was a specific/special committee 

with specific and primary responsibility of screening the ISPSC Presidential candidates 

which was terminated upon completion of the search. 

  

During the exit conference, the Accountant explained that the payment of per 

diems and basis of rates were based from the search of ISPSC Presidency four years 

ago. The Audit Team stated also that expenses were recorded and charged to Travelling 

Expenses account which requires supporting documents such as Itinerary of Travel and 

other documents to support claims. The SUC President then requested that Itinerary of 

Travels, instead of, payrolls be submitted to justify the claims where the Audit Team 

replied that such documents will be subjected to further evaluation. 
 

As a rejoinder, we maintain our stand with our recommendations. 
 

 

Invalid Designations of Two Vice Presidents - ₱177,573.68 
 

9. Two designees to the positions of VPAF and VPAA lacked the necessary 
qualifications for the positions as required under Section 13(c) (2) of the 2017 of 

OHRAORA (Revised 2018), resulting in invalid designations and consequently, 

invalid payments of RATA aggregating ₱177,573.68. 
 

 



 

46 
 

Section 13(c) (2) of the 2017 OHRAORA (Revised 2018) states: 
 

Designees can only be designated to positions within the level 

they are currently occupying. Employees holding first level 

positions cannot be designated to perform the duties of second 

level positions except in meritorious cases as determined by 

CSC Regional Office upon request for exemption by the agency 

concerned. This exception shall not apply to positions involving 

supervisory and executive managerial functions. Division Chief 

may be designated to perform the duties of second level 

executive/managerial or third level positions. 
 

This is a reiteration with updates of prior year’s audit observation.  
 

As embodied in Item No. 12, Part II of the CY 2018 AAR of the College, two 

faculty having salary grade (SG) level below SG-24 were designated as VPAF and 

VPAA, despite their lack of necessary qualifications prescribed under Section 13(c) (2) 

of the 2017 (OHRAORA) Revised (2018). Salary and bonus differentials for the 

positions they were designated to were paid to them, hence, the issuance of Notices of 

Disallowance (NDs) in 2019. Said faculty separately filed their Appeal Memoranda 

before the Office of the Regional Director in which both cases were ruled in the 

negative as their designations were declared void ab initio.  
 

Subsequently, both faculty has filed Petitions for Review with the Commission 

Proper on February 10, 2020.  
 

In CY 2020, the designations of said faculty were not yet revoked which was 

not in conformity with Section 13(c) (2) of the 2017 OHRAORA (Revised 2018). 

Consequently, payments of salary and bonus differentials were stopped, however, the 

College continued to pay their reimbursable RATA aggregating ₱177,573.68, validity 

of which was doubtful. Details are shown in the table below:

47 
 

We recommended that Management: 

 

1. Designate employees who possess the necessary qualifications in 
conformity with Section 13(c) (2) of the 2017 OHRAORA (Revised 

2018), and  

 

2. Instruct the Head of Accounting Office to suspend payments of their 
RATA until final resolution of their Petitions for Review filed with the 

Commission Proper (CP) of COA. 

 

Management commented the following: 

 

a. The stand of the Philippine Association of State Universities and Colleges 
President on said observation was sought and they were instructed to attach 

in their answers to the Audit Team his Opinion-Letter, DBM-CHED Joint 

Circular (JC) No. 2, s. 2003, CHED Memorandum Order No. 12, s. 2018 

dated June 22, 2018 and CSC MC No. 06, s. 2005 which should not be 

applied to SUCs; 

 

b. Based from the above documents, the legality of the positions of the 
questioned VPs of the different SUCs, including ISPSC, and the salaries 

and other benefits attached to their positions was upheld; 

 

c. Subject faculty are qualified to be in their positions as the pertinent 
provisions of ORAOHRA are not applicable to SUCs, hence, there was no 

doubt that they are entitled to receive RATA which was attached to their 

position, and 

 

d. Finally, said observation is a reiteration with updates of prior year’s audit 
observation it was deemed that it is already beyond the ambit and 

jurisdiction of the Audit Team as it was already elevated to the CP of COA 

through Petition for Review. 

 

As a rejoinder, it is emphasized that there was no express provision that exempts 

SUCs from the coverage of CSC, being the central personnel agency and ORAOHRA 

(Revised 2018). 

 

On the other hand, the pendency of resolution by the CP of their Petition for 

Review does not preclude the Audit Team from reiterating its observation as we are 

responsible to monitor the extent of implementation of prior year recommendations, 

and for failure to do so, we are inclined to reiterate said observation. It was also pointed 

out that Section 7.1.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009 states 

that “The head of the agency, who is primarily responsible for all government funds 

and property pertaining to his agency shall ensure that: xxx  (d) appropriate actions are 

taken on the deficiencies noted as contained in the AOM.” 

 



 

48 
 

As such, the Audit Team maintains its stand that the subject faculty were 

ineligible to be designated as VPs which was not in conformity with Section 13 (c) (7) 

of the ORAOHRA (Revised 2018), rendering their designations invalid, consequently, 

not entitled to receive RATA.  

 

 

Non-adherence to the Terms and Conditions of Lease Contracts - ₱114,500.00 

 

10. Terms and Conditions of Lease Contracts entered into by and between the College 
and 13 employee-occupants of its cottages were not strictly enforced by both 

parties, resulting in the accumulation of unpaid rental fees in the total amount of 

₱114,500.00, and non-protection/preservation of the interests and welfare of the 

College. 

 

The College has entered into Contract of Lease of the Cottages with the 

employees of ISPSC inside the premises of Sta. Maria Campus covering the period 

from April 2019 until March 31, 2020. 

 

Sections 2, 4 and 12 of the Terms and Conditions of the said Contract states, 

the following: 

 

2. TERM: This term of lease is for one year ONE (1) YEAR, 

from April 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020 inclusive. Upon its 

expiration, this lease may be renewed under such terms and 

conditions as may be mutually agreed upon by both parties. 

A written notice to renew the lease shall be served to the 

LESSOR not later than one (1) month prior to the expiry date 

of the period herein agreed upon. A notice of non-renewal 

with order to vacate shall also be served to the lessee not later 

than three (3) months prior to the expiry date of the period 

herein agreed upon if renewal of the lease for the following 

year is deemed impossible. 

 

4. RENTAL RATE: The monthly rental rate for the leased 
premises shall be Five Hundred pesos (₱500.00). All rental 

payments shall be payable to the LESSOR through Payroll 

Deduction. 

 

12. REMEDIES FOR BREACH AGREEMENT: If the 

LESSEE fails to perform, or breaches, any agreement of this 

lease other than the agreement of the LESSEE to pay rent, 

for ten days after written notice specifying the performance 

required will have been given to the LESSEE, the LESSOR 

may terminate this lease. 

 



 

49 
 

Review and evaluation of Lease Contracts and their corresponding 

implementation including Subsidiary Ledgers-Receivables on account of all 

maintained by the Resource Generation Office revealed the following: 

 

1. Delayed/non-payment of monthly rental fees of 13 occupants covering the 
period from April 2019 – December 2020 have accumulated to ₱114,500.00 

due to failure to deduct their payments through payroll deduction as per 

Section 4, Terms and Conditions of the Contract. It was noted that three 

lessees have not paid their rentals since the start of Contract. Individual 

account balances ranged from ₱6,000.00 to ₱10,500.00; 

 

2. The College did not issue written notice to renew their lease prior to the 
expiration of the Contract in March 2020 which resulted in the non-renewal 

of their Contracts. All occupants are now occupying the Cottages in the 

absence of duly executed Lease Contracts, and 

 

3. Non-compliance with the terms as previously stated in Item No. 1 even 
before expiration of the Contract, is a form of breach of agreement, which 

the College failed to sanction or impose upon the lessee.  

 

Failure to comply fully with the specific Terms and Conditions as cited above, 

resulted in the accumulation of unpaid rental fees in the total amount of ₱114,500.00, 

and non-protection/preservation the interests and welfare of the College. 

 

We recommended that Management require the OIC – Director, Resource 

Generation Office to demand immediate settlement of all unpaid rental fees due 

them, and cause the renewal of Lease Contracts, otherwise, issue the necessary 

Notice to Vacate the property of the College. Henceforth, ensure that the Terms 

and Conditions embodied in future lease contracts are faithfully complied with 

and enforced by the College. 

 

Management commented that collection letters all dated February 15, 2021 

were sent to all occupants informing them to settle their accounts wherein some have 

settled their accounts in full.   Also, a meeting was held between Management and 

occupants which was spearheaded by the VPAF. The Terms and Conditions embodied 

in the Lease Contracts which shall be faithfully complied with. It was also informed 

that the occupants were willing to settle their balances and monthly dues. 

 

Management committed to comply with our recommendations. 

 

 

  Modified Direct Payment Scheme Not Yet Fully Adopted 
 

11. The Modified Direct Payment Scheme (MDPS) for payment of Accounts Payables 
(A/Ps) due creditors/payees as mandated under DBM Circular Letter (CL) No. 

2013-16, and Section 3.0 of DBM CL No. 2018-4 was not yet fully adopted by the 



 

50 
 

College, resulting in the non-achievement of the purpose of reducing outstanding 

checks for better cash management by the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr).  

 

MDPS refers to the payment procedure whereby the Modified Disbursement 

System-Government Servicing Bank (MDS-GSB) shall pay the creditors/payees listed 

in the List of Due and Demandable Accounts Payable with Advice to Debit Account 

(LDDAP-ADA) not later than 48 hours but not earlier than 24 hours upon receipt of 

the said document from the NGA/OU, through direct credit to the creditor’s 

current/savings ATM account (CA/SA/ATM) maintained with the MDS-GSB; or Bank 

transfer if creditor’s account is maintained outside the agency’s MDS-GSB, where 

corresponding bank charges shall be borne/paid by the creditor/payee concerned. 

 

DBM CL No. 2013-16 dated December 23, 2013 mandated NGAs to use MDPS 

for payment of A/Ps due creditors/payees of all NGAs/Operating Units and the use of 

List of Due and Demandable Accounts Payables-Advice to Debit Account (LDDAP-

ADA) effective January 1, 2014. Subsequently, its implementation was deferred to 

March 1, 2014 as per Section 2.2 of DBM Circular Letter No. 2013-16A dated February 

6, 2014. 

 

Further, DBM CL No. 2018-14 dated December 28, 2018 was issued updating 

the guidelines in the implementation of the MDPS and enhancing compliance with the 

said Scheme. 

 

Under the Section 3.0 of the same DBM CL, it prescribes: 

 

3.1 NGAs shall use the existing LDDAP-ADA and SLIEE to 

settle all A/Ps to creditors including utility companies and 

social insurance corporations except GSIS (until such time 

that GSIS is equipped to accept direct payment scheme). 

 

 The implementation of the MDPS shall strictly be followed 

for transactions entered into by NGA[s]. 

 

3.2 The NGAs shall require its creditors/payees without CA/SA 

accounts with the agency’s GSB to issue a remitter’s 

instruction to the agency GSB as sender of the fun[d]. 

  

The supplier/creditors as remitter shall shoulder the cost of 

transferring payment from the NGA’s GSB to other non-

GSBs (LBP to BDO, etc.). 

 

Audit of disbursements disclosed, that the College has not yet fully adopted 

MDPS in paying its obligations due creditors/payees as shown in the submitted Report 

of Checks Issued/DVs as the following creditors/payees’ transactions were still paid 

through the issuance of checks, to wit: 

 



 

51 
 

a. Suppliers for payment of goods and services above P10,000.00 in a year; 
b. Newly-hired employees hired through Contracts of Service for the payment 

of their salaries/wages; 

c. Other claims of regular employees (reimbursements/other benefits); 
d. Other NGAs such as the BIR for the remittance of taxes withheld by the 

College, Mariano Marcos State University for payment of SCUAA I 2020 

Institutional Share; 

e. Contractors for payment of progress/final payments of infrastructure 
projects; 

f. Cash advance of Cashier for the payment of per diems of the BOT; 
 

It was further observed that the College only adopts MDPS in paying some of 

the personnel benefits of employees and salaries/wages of re-hired employees under 

job order basis or Contracts of Service of the College. As regard obligations with 

Contractors, it was only in December 2020 that said scheme was adopted. 

 

Inquiry with Management revealed that some of the reasons for non-

implementation thereof  were the inability to secure CA/SA accounts with the College’ 

GSB/Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) from creditors; require creditors/payees 

without LBP CA/SA accounts to open such with the agency’s GSB and/or inform 

creditors without  LBP CA/SA accounts to issue a remitter’s instruction to LBP 

Narvacan, as sender of the fund and as remitter, the cost of transferring payment from 

LBP to other non-GSBs  will be shouldered by them, which were not in conformity 

with DBM CL No. 2013-16, amended by  DBM Circular Letter No. 2013-16A, and 

Section 3.0, DBM CL No. 2018-14, resulting in the non-achievement of purpose of 

reducing outstanding checks for better cash management by the (BTr). 

 

We recommended that Management instruct the Head of Accounting 

Office to secure the LBP CA/SA account of creditors/payees. If none, require them 

to open LBP CA/SA accounts or inform them to issue a remitter’s instruction to 

the agency GSB as sender of the fund wherein the cost of transferring payment 

from LBP to other non-GSBs is to be shouldered by them. Henceforth, strictly 

adhere with DBM CL No. 2013-16, Section, 2.2 of DBM CL No. 2013-16A, and 

Section 3.0, DBM CL No. 2018-14. 
 

During the exit conference, the Accountant commented that they already started 

complying with the audit recommendation when the Audit Team called their attention 

on the matter. However, such compliance was only made for transactions pertaining to 

infrastructure projects.  
 

As a rejoinder, the Audit Team will monitor Management’s compliance with 

our audit recommendation.

C. Performance Audit 
 

Low Collection Efficiency Rate of Past Due Receivables - ₱6,759,761.75 
 

12. Past due in the amount of P ₱5,402,688.50 and dormant receivables in the amount 
of ₱1,357,073.25 aggregating ₱6,759,761.75 remained outstanding for lack of 

intensified collection efforts by the College resulted in the deprivation by the 

College of much needed funds to support its operations. 
 

Dormant Receivable Accounts refer to accounts which balances remained 

inactive or non-moving in the books of accounts for 10 years or more and where 

settlement/collectability could no longer be ascertained. 
 

As at December 31, 2020, Accounts Receivable (AR) balance under the Trust 

Fund and Other Funds amounted to ₱6,759,761.75, broken down in the table below: 
 

 

Type of Fund 

AR Balance 

as at December 31, 2020 

(₱) 

Trust 5,663,526.25 

Other Fund 1,096,235.50 

Total 6,759,761.75 

 

AR under Trust Fund in the amount of ₱5,663,526.25 represents unpaid tuition 

fees of students enrolled in High School, College and Graduate School who did not 

continue with their studies or dropped out their subjects without informing the College 

covering SYs 2003-2004 to 2018-2019, while AR under Other Funds amounting to 

₱1,096,235.50 comprises STUFAP Loans granted to poor but deserving students 

covering the period from CYs 2004-2011.  
 

Review of Schedule of Aging of AR showed, that the amount of past due 

AR aged three to nine years amounted to ₱5,402,688.50 while dormant AR aged 10 to 

16 years amounted to ₱1,357,073.25 representing unpaid tuition fees and student 

loans.  
 

Inquiry with Management revealed, that in CY 2020, the College started 

deducting from the salaries of faculty who acted as guarantors to students who availed 

of the STUFAP Loans, and it sent collection letters to some debtors having records of 

their addresses. Based from the data gathered, total receivables collected during the 

year amounted to only ₱35,537.50 representing a collection efficiency rate of 00.52 

percent only. 
 

Lack of intensified collection efforts by the College resulted in the deprivation 

by the College of much needed funds to support its operations. 

 

 

 



 

53 
 

We recommended that Management: 

 

1. Require the Accountant to intensify its collection efforts through 
collection and demand letters to debtors; 

 

2. After collection efforts and remedies have been exhausted for dormant 
accounts, request write-off in accordance with COA Circular No. 2016-

005 dated December 19, 2016, and 

 

3. Consider the inclusion of collection targets in the College Key Result 
Areas and Performance Commitment to reduce its outstanding 

Accounts Receivables. 

 

During the exit conference, the Accountant justified that the College have been 

sending collection letters to debtors and some letters were returned due to the change 

in the addresses of debtors. The Accountant showed the return cards evidencing the 

receipt of demand letters from the debtors, and also demand letters which have returned 

since address could not be located according to the post man. She also explained that 

some of these debtors were already deceased, as claimed by their family, thus she 

required for the evidence of such claim, like death certificate, to facilitate their request 

for authority to write-off.  Further, Management assured the Audit Team to continue to 

intensify their collection efforts and implement our audit recommendations. 

 

 

D. Other Areas 
 

Gender and Development (GAD) 

 

13. Revised/adjusted GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) was not re-submitted for 
endorsement by the Philippine Commission for Women(PCW) and modified to 

address the COVID-19 situation, and non-establishment of GAD database/sex-

disaggregated data were not in accordance with Section 1 of Executive Order (EO) 

273, Section 32 of GAA of FY 2020, Sections 4.2,4.3, 8.6.2 of PCW-NEDA-DBM 

JC No. 2012-01 and Sections 4.1 and 4.4 of PCW MC No. 2020-03, thus, effective 

implementation of GAD projects and activities responsive to gender issues and 

development of the College and stakeholders could not be assured. 

 

Section 1 of EO No. 273 dated September 8, 1995 directs all government 

agencies, departments, bureaus, offices, and instrumentalities to take appropriate steps 

to ensure the full implementation of the policies/strategies and programs/projects 

outlined in the Plan and to institutionalize GAD efforts in government by incorporating 

GAD concerns, as spelled out in the Plan; in their dated planning, programming 

budgeting processes. 

 

Section 32, of the GAA of FY 2020 requires all agencies of the government to 

formulate a GAD Plan designed to address gender issues within their concerned sectors 



 

54 
 

and or mandate and implement applicable provisions under RA No. 9710 or the Magna 

Carta for Women, Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 

Against Women, the Beijing Platform for Action, the Philippine Plan for Gender 

Responsive Development (1995-2025) and the Philippine Development Plan (2017-

2022). 
 

PCW-NEDA-DBM JC No. 2012-01 prescribes guidelines and procedures for 

the formulation, development, submission, implementation, monitoring and evaluation 

including accounting of results of agency annual GPBs, and GAD Accomplishment 

Report, applicable provisions are the following: 
 

4.0 The following are essential elements in GAD planning and 

budgeting as they enable agencies to more effectively plan 

and implement their sectoral programs on GAD. If these are 

not present or need to be strengthened, agencies shall include 

them in their GPBs: 
 

  xxx 

4.2 Capacity Building on Gender and Development. [A]gencies 
are required to regularly undertake orientations and capacity 

development on GAD including GAD-related laws and 

commitments for their employees. Training should include 

gender mainstreaming, gender analysis and gender-

responsive planning and budgeting. 
 

 xxx 

4.3 Institutionalizing GAD Database/Sex-disaggregated Data: 

The agency shall develop or integrate in its existing database 

GAD information to include gender statistics and sex-

disaggregated data that have been systematically produced 

or gathered as inputs or bases for planning, budgeting, 

programming, and policy formation. 
 

 xxx 

8.6 PCW shall endorse agency GPBs only under the following 

conditions: 

   

 xxx 

8.6.2 if the requested revisions or additional information in 

answer to questions about the GPB are accepted by 

PCW within the prescribed deadlines;  

 

Meanwhile, Sections 4.1 and 4.4 of PCW MC No. 2020-03 dated April 27, 2020 

prescribes: 

 

4.1 All national government agencies and instrumentalities are 
enjoined to review and revise, as necessary, their FY 2020 



 

55 
 

Gender and Development (GAD) Plan and Budget to 

implement measures to address gender issues and concerns 

arising from the unequal status of their women and men 

stakeholders duet to the COVID-19 situatio[n]. 

 

xxx 

4.4 Agencies with FY 2020 GPB that has been endorsed or is 
still under review by the PCW have an option to submit 

adjusted GPB until 01 July 2020 for re-endorsement of 

PC[W]. 

 

Audit of the College relative to its GAD planning formulation, submission and 

implementation during the CY 2020, disclosed the following: 

 

1. GPB costing ₱12,750,000.00 was not duly endorsed by the PCW as it does 
not bear the Quick Response Code which serves as proof that such was 

endorsed by the PCW as required under Section 8.6 of PCW-NEDA-DBM 

JC No. 2012-01. 

 

Inquiry with the GAD Director revealed, that the PCW returned their GPB 

for revision which was complied with, however, the GAD Director failed to 

re-submit it to the PCW through the use of the Gender Mainstreaming 

Monitoring System (GMMS) portal for lack of technical capabilities to use 

the System, an indication of inadequacy of capacity building of GAD Focal 

System which was required under Section 4.2 of PCW-NEDA-DBM JC No. 

2012-0.  

 

Despite inadequacy, she should have sought the help of other GAD Focal 

Person of other SUCs having knowledge, thereof, in order to resolve the 

problem and have it re-submitted to the PCW. 

 

2. Non-modification of the GPB to address gender issues and concerns during 
the COVID-19 situation as required under Sections 4.1 and 4.4 of PCW MC 

No. 2020-03 prevented the optimum implementation and utilization of GPB 

as only 40% or ₱5,065,525.60 was incurred. 

 

Review of the GAD Accomplishment Report showed, that most activities 

not implemented due to the pandemic situation were trainings/seminars, 

colloquiums with student leaders and faculty, and research studies due to 

COVID-19 pandemic. 

 

Non-implementation of GPB may be attributed also to the lack of time of 

the GAD Director for she is a full-time faculty with 21 units of teaching 

load, and was not provided with separate office, office equipment and staff 

to help her fully and timely carry-out GAD programs, activities and 

projects. 



 

56 
 

 

3. Absence of GAD database/established sex disaggregated data essential in 
GAD planning, budgeting, programming and policy formulation as required 

in Section 4.3 of PCW-NEDA-DBM JC No. 2012-01. 

 

Sex-disaggregated data consist of information collected and analyzed 

separately on males and females stored in the GAD database which shall be 

updated, as needed and used in the preparation of the annual GPB and 

accomplishment reports, and used in their policy and program development. 

 

In the review of GAD Accomplishment Report, one of the GAD activities 

to be implemented during the year under the Organization-Focused 

Activities is the installation of GAD database for students and employees 

wherein it needs to hire a computer expert to do the task of creating a GAD 

database, but was not implemented which was not in conformity with PCW-

NEDA-DBM JC No. 2012-01. 

 

Due to the absence of GPB duly endorsed by the PCW, non-revision of GPB to 

address issues and concerns during pandemic, and absence of GAD database, there was 

no assurance that the projects and activities carried out were responsive to the gender 

issues of the College and its stakeholders which is inconsistent with Section 1 of EO 

No. 273 and Section 32, of the GAA of FY 2020.  

 

We recommended that Management: 

 

1. Strictly comply with Sections 4.2, 4.3 and 8.6 PCW-NEDA-DBM JC 
No. 2012-01 and Sections 4.1 and 4.4 of PCW MC No. 2020-03 to ensure 

that the programs, projects and activities are aligned with GAD-related 

undertakings, 

 

2. Direct the GAD Focal Point the following: 
 

a) See to it that necessary revisions of the GPB required by the PCW 
be made and re-submitted timely for endorsement by the PCW, 

 

b) Ensure full implementation/utilization of the College GPB to 
efficiently and effectively address gender issues and concerns, and 

 

c) Elevate concerns/needs of the GAD Focal System to higher 
authorities to address such that prevented the full implementation 

of College GBP as regards assigned teaching loads, absence of office 

space, office equipment and staff to assist the GAD Focal Person to 

carry out GAD programs, activities and projects. 

 

During the exit conference, the GAD Director explained that she was scheduled 

to attend training on the use of GMMS, however, due to the pandemic, it was cancelled. 



 

57 
 

Management also justified that the policies on faculty workloads are currently being 

reviewed and assured that the concerns of the GAD Director will be addressed to give 

her time to fulfill her responsibilities as a GAD Director. Moreover, the SUC President 

informed the Audit Team that the Planning Officer was instructed to coordinate with 

the GAD Director as regards GAD-related projects concerning infrastructure projects. 
 

 

Compliance with Tax Laws 

 

The requirements of the DOF-DBM-COA JC No. 1-2000 on the withholding 

of taxes and remittance to the BIR were partially complied. 

 

For CY 2020, the total withheld taxes on compensation income from progress 

and final payments of infrastructure projects, purchase of goods and services, and 

salaries and wages of employees, net of refunds, amounted to ₱15,888,193.38 and total 

remittances amounted to ₱13,860,169.75. Out of the unremitted balance as of 

December 31, 2020 in the amount of ₱2,199,942.96, the amount of ₱1,472,180.90 was 

remitted in January 2021; the total amount of ₱492,818.64 which represents withheld 

taxes from accrued income from payments of hazard pay and honoraria of employees 

will be remitted after payment to payees while the remaining balance of ₱65,237.31 

which represents collections of unwithheld taxes out of reimbursements due for 

remittance pending instruction from the BIR and the amount of ₱169,706.11 is subject 

of reconciliation with the College records. 
 

 

Compliance with GSIS Premium Deductions and Remittances 

 

14. GSIS employees’ contributions withheld from their salary differentials due to 
promotion and/or step increment and the corresponding College’ contributions in 

CYs 2019-2020 remained unremitted as of December 31, 2020 for failure of the 

College to update its employees’ records with the GSIS database which was not in 

conformity with Section 6.b of RA No. 8291, thus, precluded remittance thereof 

and possible imposition of penalties and surcharges upon the College  as provided 

under Section 7 of the same Act. 

  

Section 6.b of RA No. 8291 or the GSIS Act states that: 

 

Each employer shall remit directly to the GSIS the employees’ 

and employers’ contributions within the first ten (10) days of the 

calendar month following the month to which the contributions 

apply.  

 

Section 7 of the said RA also provides: 

 

Agencies which delay the remittance of any and all monies due 

to the GSIS as may be prescribed by the Board but not less than 

two percent simple interest per mont[h].  



 

58 
 

Review of the Statement of Financial Position as at December 31, 2020 

disclosed, that the “Due to GSIS” account balance of ₱1,281,281.28 representing RLIP 

(employee and employer’s shares) withheld from employees who were promoted and 

granted step increment for the CYs 2019 and 2020 remained unremitted, broken down 

as follows:

Inquiry revealed, that Management was precluded to remit in view of its failure 

to update its employees’ records with GSIS database which was not in conformity with 

Section 6.b of RA No. 8291, thus, precluded remittance thereof and possible imposition 

of penalties and surcharges upon the College as provided under Section 7 of the same 

Act.  

 

We recommended that Management direct the HRM Officer through its 

Authorized Administrative Officer to prioritize the updating of the concerned 

employees’ records with the GSIS so that the amount of ₱1,281,281.28 could be 

remitted already. Henceforth, strictly adhere with Section 6.b of RA No. 8291. 

 

During the exit conference, the HRMO explained that GSIS does not accept the 

payment for the remittance of the withheld amount if the amount of actual salaries are 

not billed, but has already requested for reconciliation billing with GSIS for the 

updating. 

 

 

Compliance with Pag-IBIG  

 

For CY 2020, the requirements of RA No. 9679 on the withholding of 

contributions and remittance of employees’ and employer’s share to the Home 

Development Mutual Fund or Pag-IBIG within the period prescribed under said Act 

were complied with. Out of the year-end balance of ₱8,539.74, the amount of ₱1,536.84 

was remitted in January 2021, and the remaining balance of ₱7,002.90 representing 

withheld amount in the previous years is subject for reconciliation by the College. 

 

 

Compliance with PhilHealth Contributions 

 

The requirements of RA No. 7875, as amended by RA No. 9241, on the 

withholding of contributions and remittance of the employees’ and employer’s share to 

the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation within the period prescribed under said 

Act were complied with. Out of the year-end balance of ₱5,212.31, the amount of 

₱1,152.65 was remitted in January 2021 while the remaining balance of ₱4,059.66 



 

59 
 

representing withheld amount in the previous years is subject for reconciliation by the 

College. 

 

 

Compliance with Property Insurance Law - ₱205,620,449.99 

 

15. Insurable properties of the College, except Motor Vehicles, with net book value of 
₱205,620,449.99 were not insured with General Insurance Fund of the GSIS which 

was not in compliance with Section 5 of RA No. 656, as amended by PD No. 245 

thus, exposing the College from risk of non-indemnification for uninsured 

properties in case of damage or loss due to fire, earthquake, storm, or other 

casualty. 

 

RA No. 656, otherwise known as the Property Insurance Law, as amended by 

PD No. 245 dated July 13, 1973 requires every government agency to insure its 

properties with the General Insurance Fund (GIF) of the GSIS. The GIF was established 

in order to indemnify or compensate the Government as defined in this Act for any 

damage to, or loss of, its properties due to fire, earthquake, storm, or other casualty.  

 

Section 5 of the same RA provides that: 

 

Every government, except a municipal government below first 

class, is hereby required to insure its properties, with the Fund 

against any insurable risk herein provided and pay the premiums 

thereon, which, however, shall not exceed the premiums charged  

 

by private insurance companies: Provided, however, That the 

System reserves the right to disapprove the whole or a portion 

of the amount of insurance applied for: Provided, further, That 

such property or part thereof as may not be insurable or 

acceptable for insurance may be insured with any private 

insurance company.  

 

This observation is a reiteration of a prior year audit observation, contained 

under Item No. 7, Part II - Findings and Observations of the AAR for CY 2018 which 

remained not implemented. Records showed that  only motor vehicles were insured 

with the GSIS during the year, whereas, other insurable properties  composed of Water 

Supply Systems, Power Supply Systems, Buildings, School Buildings, Other 

Structures, Office Equipment, Information and Communication Technology 

Equipment, Technology Equipment, Medical Equipment, Other Machinery and 

Equipment, Agriculture and Forestry Equipment, Marine and Fishery Equipment, 

Furniture and Fixtures, and Other Machinery Equipment having a total net book value 

of ₱205,620,449.99 remained uninsured which was not in conformity with  RA No. 

656, as amended by PD No. 245. 

 



 

60 
 

Inquiry with Management revealed, however, insurance of properties with the 

GSIS was not facilitated nor complied with in violation of Section 5, RA No. 656, as 

amended by PD No. 245, exposing the College from risk of non-indemnification for 

the uninsured properties in case of damage or loss due to fire, earthquake, storm or 

other casualty. 
 

We recommended that Management: 

 

1. Designate an employee who will be in-charge in the yearly insurance/ 
renewal of Property and Equipment with the GSIS; 
 

2. Require the Head, Administrative Office to monitor/ensure the yearly 
renewal of insurance to conform with Section 5 of RA No. 656, as 

amended by PD No. 245 in order to indemnify the College for any 

damage to, or loss of, its properties. 
 

Management commented that the College has allotted an amount of 

₱1,300,000.00 for the insurance of properties in CY 2021, and initial assessment of 

insurance premium was received from the GSIS. Further, Management committed to 

implement our recommendations.

The reliability and accuracy 

of the “Property, Plant and 

Equipment” account with 

total net book value of 

₱333,655,006.02 could not be 

ascertained due to the non-

maintenance of  SLs/ 

schedules supporting  the 

General Ledgers (GLs), and  

unreconciled variance of 

₱94,065,867.34 between the 

book balance and Report of

Section 12.b(2) of GAM for 

NGAS, Volume I and Section 

5(4) of COA Circular No. 80-

124, affecting the fairness of 

presentation of the College’

We recommended that 

Management:         

 

1. Require the Accounting 
Office to maintain SLs/ 

supporting schedules to 

support the GLs of PPE 

accounts as prescribed in 

Section 111 of P.D. No. 

1445 and Section12.b(2) of

or authority of the State 

College, which was not in 

conformity with the 

provisions of Section 4(2) of 

PD 1445, depriving the 

College from enjoying and/or 

making use of the property as 

a rightful owner in carrying 

out its mandates. 

 

28. We recommended that 
Management institute 

necessary legal action for 

the eviction of the illegal 

settlers from its premises, 

in order not to deprive the 

College from using and 

enjoying the property as 

the rightful owner thereof 

in carrying out its 

mandates. Likewise, it is 

recommended that 

Management ensure that 

no other structures be 

constructed, nor 

improvements and repairs 

done without authority 

granted by the owner. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Implemented 

 

Overtaken by events 

as the BOT has 

issued Resolution 

that the cottages 

were to be subjected 

for lease on all 

campus residents. 

 

Said properties were 

included in the Land 

Use Development 

and Infrastructure 

Plan of the College 

for submission to 

CHED. 

 

Copies of perfected contracts 

and their supporting 

documents for infrastructure 

submitted to COA within five 

working days from execution 

or issuance thereof as 

required under COA Circular 

No. 2009-001, hence, proper 

and timely review and 

evaluation of the contracts 

were not done by the Audit 

Team. 

 

29. We recommended that the 
BAC Secretariat adhere 

strictly to the provisions

The designated Vice

President for Administration

meet the necessary 

qualifications as such as 

provided under Section 13 (c) 

(2) of the 2017 ORAOHRA 

of the CSC, rendering their 

designations invalid, hence, 

salaries and other 

emoluments received by 

virtue of their designation 

shall be disallowable in audit. 

 

30. We recommended that 
Management revoke the 

designations made to Dr. 

Quitevis and Dr. 

Francisco and refrain 

from designating officials 

and employees for 

positions not within their 

level in conformity with 

Sec. 13 (c)(2) of the 

ORAOHRA, thus, such 

designations may not 

result in their eventual 

invalidity or nullity.

recommended that 

concerned designees shall 

refund the salaries and 

other emoluments paid to
