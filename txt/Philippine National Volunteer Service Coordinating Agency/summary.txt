EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 

 

A. Introduction 
 

The Philippine National Volunteer Service Coordinating Agency (PNVSCA) is the 

government agency mandated to promote volunteerism and coordinate volunteer 

programs and services in the Philippines. Started as the Philippine National 

Volunteer Service Committee on December 17, 1964 by virtue of Executive Order 

(EO) No. 134, PNVSCA became an agency on December 12, 1980 through EO No. 

635. The PNVSCA is under the administrative supervision of the National Economic 

and Development Authority. 

 

The passage of Republic Act (RA) No. 9418 or the Volunteer Act of 2007 on April 

10, 2007 marked a major milestone in the history of volunteerism in the Philippines 

and further strengthened the PNVSCA which was given the privilege to undertake 

the implementation and execution of the provisions of this Act. 

 

The agency is mandated, among others, to:  

 

a) Review and formulate policies and guidelines concerning the national volunteer 
service programs consistent with national development priorities; 

 

b) Coordinate, monitor and evaluate the national volunteer service program in 
order that volunteer assistance may fit into the total national development goals; 

 

c)   Establish and maintain a national network of volunteer organizations and serve 
as liaison between and among local and foreign governmental private voluntary 

organizations including the United Nations Volunteers; and 

 

d)   Act as clearing house for matters pertaining to international volunteer services. 
 

The PNVSCA is now headed by Executive Director Donald James D. Gawe who 

assumed office on March 17, 2020. The agency has three divisions, namely: 

Administrative, Financial and Management Division; Policy Advocacy and 

Technical Services Division; and Program Coordination, Monitoring and Evaluation 

Division. It is manned by 22 regular employees supporting the top management in 

the implementation of its programs and projects for the year.

C. Scope and Objectives of Audit 
 

The audit covered the financial accounts and operations of the PNVSCA for the year 

ended December 31, 2020. The audit was conducted to: (a) verify the level of 

assurance that may be placed on Management’s assertions on the financial 

statements (FSs); (b) determine the propriety of transactions as well as the extent of 

compliance with pertinent laws, rules and regulations; (c)  recommend agency’s 

improvement opportunities; and (d) determine the extent of implementation of prior

D. Audit Methodology 
 

We adopted a risk-based audit approach in the audit of the financial statements of 

PNVSCA and in the review of compliance with laws, rules and regulations.  The 

Audit Team which carried out the audit, among others, (i) examined financial and 

accounting procedures adopted by the PNVSCA and other relevant documentation; 

(ii) assessed internal controls regulating financial operations  and carried out 

compliance testing for determining the extent of control in operation; (iii)  

conducted substantive testing of a representative sample of selected transactions;  

(iv) carried out review, on test check basis, of a number of contracts and 

transactions related to movements in balances of assets, liabilities, revenues and 

expenses; and (v) conducted interviews and held discussions with the concerned 

staff  in the Central  Office.  

 

The results of the audit were communicated to the Head of the Agency and the 

concerned officials through the issuance of Audit Observation Memoranda.  

 

 

E. Independent Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements 
 

We rendered an unmodified opinion on the fairness of the presentation of the 

PNVSCA’s FSs as at December 31, 2020. 

 

 

F. Summary of Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations 
 

Among the audit observations and recommendations discussed in Part II, the 

significant observations are summarized as follows: 

 

1. The non-recognition of the disbursements and the remaining balances due to the 
unliquidated fund transfers to various NEDA Regional Offices (NROs) and the 

Bangsamoro Planning and Development Authority – Bangsamoro Autonomous 

Region in Muslim Mindanao (BPDA-BARMM) for the CY 2020 Search for 

Outstanding Volunteers; and the discrepancies on the reported disbursements in 

the agency’s FSs and Financial Accountability Reports (FARs) affected the 

completeness and accuracy of the balances in the FSs and related FARs.  

 

a) Non-recognition of disbursements out of the fund transfers and their balances, 

if any 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: (a) require concerned NROs 

and BPDA-BARMM with outstanding fund transfers to account the 

utilization of the fund transfers, submit the liquidation reports (LRs) and 

return any balance of fund transfers to the PNVSCA; and (b) direct the 

Accountant to recognize the disbursements of the fund transfers, including 

any unused balance, upon receipt of the LRs. 



 

 iv   

b) Discrepancy in the reported disbursements per Statement of Comparison of 

Budget and Actual Amount and Statement of Cash Flow, and FAR Nos. 1 and 

4 

We recommended and Management agreed to direct/instruct the Accountant 

and Budget Officer to further analyze the discrepancy of P7,000.02 between 

the FSs and FARs and ensure the completeness and accuracy of the balances 

therein. 

 

We also recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to 

make the necessary adjustments to correct the balances of the affected 

accounts. 

 

2. Non-inclusion in FAR No. 1-A of realignments presented in the Modification 
Advice Form (MAF) and Advice for Use of PS Allotment (APSA) totaling 

P28,708.10 did not provide complete and accurate information on the allotments 

for the budget’s line items available for obligation, among others. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to direct/instruct the Budget 

Officer to ensure that all realignments in the MAF and APSA are completely 

reflected/reported in FAR No. 1-A to provide complete and accurate 

information on allotments of the budget’s line items available for obligation, 

among others. 

 

The observations and recommendations were communicated to Management on 

April 4, 2021 thru the Summary of Observations and Recommendations for further 

comments.  Management’s views and comments were incorporated in the report, 

where appropriate.  

 

 

G. Status of Audit Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges  
 

There were no Notices of Suspension, Disallowance, or Charge issued in the audit of 

various accounts of the PNVSCA for CY 2020 while the balance of P5,970.45 

pertaining to prior year’s disallowances was settled during the year, as discussed in 

Part II of this report. 

 

 

H. Status of Implementation of Prior Year’s Recommendations 
 

Out of the nine prior year’s audit recommendations, five were implemented and four 

were not implemented. The details are discussed in Part III of this report.  

 

We enjoin Management to ensure full implementation of all audit 

recommendations to improve the financial and operational efficiency of the 

agency.
