OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

 

Financial Audit 

 

Accounting Deficiencies 

 

1. The non-recognition of the disbursements and the remaining balances due to the 
unliquidated fund transfers to various NROs and the BPDA-BARMM for the CY 

2020 SOVs; and the discrepancies on the reported disbursements in the agency’s 

FSs and FARs affected the completeness and accuracy of the balances in the FSs 

and related FARs.  

 

a. Non-recognition of disbursements out of the fund transfers and  remaining 
balances, if any 

 

Paragraph III.b of the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) under Other 

Terms and Conditions requires the submission by the NEDA Regional Offices 

(NROs) and Bangsamoro Planning and Development Authority - Bangsamoro 

Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BPDA-BARMM) to the PNVSCA of 

a liquidation report (LR) duly certified by the NRO Accountant on or before 

December 15, 2020 and for CARAGA on December 31, 2020. 

 

On the other hand,  Section 4.6 of Commission on Audit (COA) Circular 

No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994 requires the Implementing Agency (IA) to 

submit, within 10 days after the end of each month/end of the agreed period for 

the Project, the Report of Checks Issued (RCI) and the Report of Disbursements 

(RD) to report the utilization of the funds. 

 

Section 5.4 of the same Circular also provides that the Source Agency 

shall, among others, require the IA to submit the reports and furnish the IA with 

a copy of the journal vouchers taking up the expenditures.  

 

The PNVSCA conducts a yearly Search for Outstanding Volunteers 

(SOVs) from the 13 regions nationwide which started way back in CY 2001. 

However, the conduct of the SOV for CY 2020 was cancelled due to the 

implementation of the Community Quarantine throughout the country, as one of 

the precautionary measures of the government against the Coronavirus Disease 

2019 (COVID-19). In lieu of the annual SOV, the CY 2020 Search for 

Outstanding COVID-19 Volunteers (SOCV) was held to give tribute to 

outstanding COVID-19 donors and volunteers.  

 

To facilitate the evaluation of the qualifications of the nominees as well 

as the conduct of the recognition program for the SOCV winners, the agency 

engaged the services of the NROs from Regions I to XI, including Cordillera 

Administrative Region (CAR), CARAGA, and the BPDA-BARMM.  For this 



 

 30  

 

purpose, the PNVSCA entered into a MOA with the NROs and BPDA-BARMM 

and transferred the amount of P84,000.00 to each office for a total amount of 

P1.092 million from November 9 to December 18, 2020, with the requirement 

that the concerned offices submit to the PNVSCA an LR duly certified by the 

NRO Accountant on or before December 15, 2020, except for CARAGA which 

is to submit an LR on December 31, 2020.   The transferred funds were recognized 

in the books of the PNVSCA under Due from National Government Agencies.  

 

As at year-end, however, the balance of Due from National Government 

Agencies which still includes the fund transfers of P1.092 million had a balance 

of P1.094 million, showing that there had been no liquidation of the fund 

transfers. The purpose and activities related to the fund transfers had already been 

implemented and completed as the awarding of the winners for the CY 2020 

SOCV was held on December 16, 2020,  hence, all related expenses should have 

been incurred and paid for, liquidated and recognized in the books. 

 

According to the Accountant, efforts were made to follow-up the LRs 

from the NROs by the Administrative, Financial and Management Division. 

However, there were no LRs submitted, thereby leaving the amount of P1.092 

million or 100 per cent of the funds transferred unliquidated as at December 31, 

2020. Since there were no LRs submitted by the NROs, the expenses were not 

recognized in the books of accounts.  Moreover, there had been a delay in the 

fund transfer to the NRO-CARAGA as the MOA had not been returned to the 

PNVSCA.  The fund transfer was received after the activity, thus the NRO 

advanced the payment for expenses for the activity. Review of subsequent 

transactions revealed that the agency had already received LRs totaling 

P339,757.00 as at March 6, 2021, representing full liquidation of fund transfers 

from NROs V, VII, CAR, CARAGA and partial liquidation from NRO II. 

 

The unliquidated funds transferred to the NROs and the BPDA-

BARMM as at December 31, 2020 resulted in the non-recognition of the 

disbursements out of the fund transfers and the remaining fund balances, if any, 

in the year the same were incurred. 

 

The non-liquidation of the funds transferred to the NROs and the 

BPDA-BARMM by December 31, 2020 resulted in the non-recognition of the 

disbursements out of the fund transfers and the remaining fund balances, if any, 

in the year the same were incurred. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: (a) require 

concerned NROs and BPDA-BARMM with outstanding fund transfers to 

account the utilization of the fund transfers, submit the LRs and return any 

balance of fund transfers to the PNVSCA; and (b) direct the Accountant to 

recognize the disbursements of the fund transfers, including any unused 

balance, upon receipt of the LRs. 

 



 

 31  

 

Management informed the Audit Team that emails had been sent on 

December 28, 2020, January 5, March 5 and 8, 2021 to the NROs and BPDA-

ARMM to remind them of the submission of the LRs; and that as of the date of 

its comments, only P418,535.52 representing funds transferred to NROs I, II, III, 

VIII and XI remain unliquidated. It was also assured that persistent follow-ups on 

the outstanding fund transfers will be made with the concerned NROs. 

 

b. Discrepancy in the reported disbursements per SCBAA and SCF, and FAR Nos. 
1 and 4 

 

The Statement of Comparison of Budget and Actual Amount (SCBAA) 

is prepared based on the various registries maintained.  The receipts and payment 

details in the SCBAA includes: (i) the Original and Final Budget; and (ii) actual 

amounts on a comparable basis. The receipts include revenues which the national 

government agencies (NGAs) are not authorized to use and are required to be 

remitted to the National Treasury. The payments, on the other hand, include 

funds/payments received/paid and recorded in the Registry of Appropriations and 

Allotments (RAPAL) and Registry of Allotments, Obligations and 

Disbursements (RAOD). 

 

Aside from the registries being the source of data in the SCBAA, the 

information in the SCBAA can be likewise verified from the Statement of Cash 

Flow (SCF) and subsequently traced to the Financial Accountability Report 

(FAR) Nos. 1 and 4. On the payment portion of the SCBAA, the Original and 

Final Budget can be traced to FAR No. 1 under the Appropriations column while 

the actual amounts can be verified from the SCF, FAR No. 1 - Disbursements 

column and FAR No. 4. 

 

Review of the financial statements (FSs) revealed discrepancies in the 

disbursements/outflows presented in the SCBAA and the SCF.  For Payments, 

the SCF and SCBAA reflected a total of P26.524 million and P26.325 million, 

respectively, or a discrepancy of P198,546.40.  The amount presented under the 

SCF column includes remittances to the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) in the 

form of Tax Remittance Advice (TRA) and the December 2020 unremitted taxes 

withheld and excludes cash allocations reverted to the Bureau of the Treasury 

(BTr). 

 

Management was able to reconcile the difference of P198,546.40 which 

pertains to the FY 2019 Due and Demandable Obligations that were not reflected 

in the FY 2020 RAODs and subsequently not reported in the SCBAA, which 

include: (i) reissuance of stale checks with nos. 673942 and 673973 issued on 

December 23 and 26, 2019 in the amount of P6,815.87 and P173,596.52, 

respectively; and (ii) various FY 2019 Due and Demandable Obligations 

(Accounts Payable) totaling P25,134.03. It was noted, however, that the 

reconciling items showed a total of P205,546.42, instead of P198,546.40, thus a 

remaining difference of P7,000.02. 



 

 32  

 

 

Following the reconciliation by Management, the P7,000.02 is the 

difference between the taxes reported in the SCBAA, FAR Nos. 1 and 4 of 

P246,305.15 and the total amount of taxes recorded in the books and included in 

the payments in the SCF of P239,305.13. 

 

The review of the submitted FARs and FSs also revealed that the 

balances per allotment class relating to disbursements presented in the SCBAA 

and FAR No. 1 did not tally with the disbursements reported in FAR No. 4, as 

presented in Table 1:

                        *Disbursement column of FAR No. 1 

  

The disbursements under FAR No. 4 for November and December 2020 

were adjusted by P0.619 million to correct the unreconciled disbursements of 

P0.825 million per allotment class among the SCBAA and  FAR Nos. 1 and 4. 

Despite the adjustments made, the disbursement balances still reflected a variance 

of P205,546.42 which pertains to the reconciling items as earlier discussed. 

 

Consequently, the unreconciled discrepancies in the disbursements 

presented in the SCF, SCBAA and FARs affected the completeness and accuracy 

of the balances in the FSs and FARs. 
 

We recommended and Management agreed to direct/instruct the 

Accountant and Budget Officer to further analyze the discrepancy of 

P7,000.02 between the FSs and FARs and ensure the completeness and 

accuracy of the balances therein. 
 

We also recommended and Management agreed to require the 

Accountant to make the necessary adjustments to correct the balances of the 

affected accounts.

Compliance Issues  

 

Non-inclusion of realignments in the MAF and APSA in FAR No. 1-A 

 

2. Non-inclusion in FAR No. 1-A of realignments presented in the MAF and APSA 
totaling P28,708.10 did not provide complete and accurate information on the 

allotments for the budget’s line items available for obligation, among others. 

  
Under Section 5.2.1 of National Budget Circular (NBC) No. 578 dated January 

6, 2020, modifications of allotments shall be subject to the following: (a) 

accomplishment of Modification Advice Form (MAF) duly signed by the approving 

authority; (b) reflected in the appropriate Registry of Allotments and Obligations; and 

(c) reported in the accountability reports. 

 

 Review of the submitted copies of the MAF and Advice for Use of PS 

Allotment (APSA) and the effects of realigned amounts in the Statement of 

Appropriations, Allotments, Obligations, Disbursements and Balances (SAAODB) 

showed that the total realignments reflected in the SAAODB amounted to P4.669 

million which is different from the total realignments of P4.698 million in the 

accomplished MAF/APSA, resulting in a difference of P28,708.10. 

 

This noted difference of P28,708.10 was due to the non-inclusion in the 

SAAODB of the realignments of P27,208.60 from the Basic Salary-Regular to Year-

End Bonus - Civilian and P1,499.50 from Other Maintenance and Other Operating 

Expenses to Other Professional Services. 

 

Accordingly, the non-inclusion of total realignments reflected in the MAF and 

APSA of P28,708.10 but not in the agency’s FAR No. 1-A had not provided complete 

and accurate information on the allotments for the budget’s line items which are still 

available for obligations, among others.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to direct/instruct the Budget 

Officer to ensure that all realignments in the MAF and APSA are completely 

reflected/reported in FAR No. 1-A to provide complete and accurate information 

on allotments of the budget’s line items available for obligation, among others. 

 

 

Compliance with Other Mandatory Accounts/Other Areas 

 

3. COVID-19-Pandemic Response and Recovery Interventions 
 

The COVID-19-related expenses charged to PS and MOOE amounted to 

P30,881.00 and P178,615.89, respectively. The results of audit of these COVID-related 

transactions are as follows: 

 



 

 34  

 

On the grant of hazard pay to employees during the ECQ and COVID-19 duty 

allowance to volunteer employees during ECQ and GCQ 

 

Section 1 of Administrative Order (AO) No. 26 dated March 23, 2020 of the 

Office of the President authorized the NGAs to grant COVID-19 Hazard Pay to 

personnel who physically reported for work during the implementation of Enhanced 

Community Quarantines (ECQs) in their respective work stations, in an amount not 

exceeding P500.00 per day per person. 

 

Analysis of Hazard Pay  and Other Professional  Services as at December 31, 

2020 disclosed the payments of hazard pay at P500/day or  a total of  P16,000.00 and 

P2,000.00 to seven regular employees and one contract of service (COS) personnel, 

respectively, who reported to office during ECQ (March 17 to May 15, 2020) and 

modified ECQ (MECQ) (May 16 to 31, and August 4 to 18, 2020)  

 

Section of 1 of AO No. 31 dated June 15, 2020 of the Office of the President 

also authorized the grant of COVID-19 Duty Allowance to NGAs and Government 

Owned and/or Controlled Corporations to grant their respective volunteer personnel to 

the Mega Swabbing Facilities (MSF) in areas under ECG or GCQ in an amount not 

exceeding P500 per day plus a maximum 25 per cent on monthly basic salary per 

person. 

 

COVID-19 duty allowance amounting to P14,881.00 was paid to one PNVSCA 

staff, who is enlisted to assist in the COVID-19 mega swabbing facility from May 12 

to June 2, 2021 at the Philippine Arena Stadium in Bulacan. 

 

On the provision of supplies/materials for hazard control 

 

Paragraph B, Section VI of AO No. 2020-0015 of the Department of Health 

(DOH) on Risk-based Public Health Standards Across Settings provides that at the 

minimum, all actors shall implement the prescribed interventions in various settings as 

presented under Annex A-Required Public Health Standards Across All Settings as of 

April 27, 2020, depending on their Risk Severity Grading.  For each prescribed 

intervention, concrete examples of corresponding hazard controls (e.g. engineering 

control, administrative control, and property, plant and equipment (PPE) are provided. 

Column D-Offices/Workplaces of Annex A listed the administrative controls and PPE 

for offices/workplace, such as the provision of tissue, masks, among others.  On the 

other hand, engineering and administrative controls include placement of handwashing 

facilities, hand sanitizers and dispensers with alcohol-based solution in all entrances, 

exits and areas with high foot traffic and facilities. 

 

Review of Other Supplies and Materials Expenses disclosed various 

procurements in the amount of P44,361.05 of surgical masks, face shields, spray 

bottles, disinfectant sprays/solutions foot bath coil mat, thermogun, inclusive of the 

regular supplies of alcohol in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  The supplies, 

except for the thermogun, foot bath coil mat and disinfectant sprays/solutions, were 



 

 35  

 

given to all PNVSCA employees quarterly based on the Reports of Supplies and 

Materials Issued attached to Journal Entry Vouchers.  

 

On the provision of transportation facilities to employees on skeleton workforce  

 

Item C, Section 4.0 of Civil Service Commission (CSC) Memorandum Circular 

(MC) No. 18, s. 2020 states that reasonable transportation facilities and housing 

quarters shall be provided to employees assigned as skeleton workforce, whenever 

practicable, and subject to budgeting, accounting and auditing rules and regulations. 

 

Analysis of Fuel, Oil, and Lubricant Expenses disclosed fuel consumption 

totaling P132,254.84 for two service vehicles used as shuttle services for the PNVSCA  

employees from March 27  to December 29, 2020. 

 

There were no significant observations noted in the audit of the CY 2020 

COVID-19 related expenses as discussed in the foregoing paragraphs. 

 

 

4. Gender and Development (GAD) 
 

Section 31 of the General Provisions of the General Appropriations Act (GAA) 

for FY 2020 provides, among others, the formulation of a GAD Plan and Budget which 

shall be integrated in the regular activities of the agencies and which shall be funded 

by at least five per cent of their current year’s budget. 

 

The agency planned four activities and allocated a budget of P2.282 million or 

7.31 per cent of the appropriations for GAD-related projects mainstreamed in its 

regular activities for CY 2020.  The planned activities were implemented during the 

year, however, due to the pandemic there were changes in the activities and majority  

were done virtually via zoom so they were able to save on costs for meals, venues and 

other related expenses, hence only P1.933 million of the GAD allocation were actually 

spent during the year.  The activities accomplished, among others, were: (a) 75 per 

cent of partner international volunteer service organizations are adopting GAD as a 

cross cutting theme in volunteer deployment; (b) advocacy activities on volunteerism 

mainstreamed GAD programs; (c) 50 volunteers and 25 local partner institutions were 

given orientation on GAD; and (d) agency personnel provided with GAD training.  

 

 

5. Senior Citizens (SCs) and Persons with Disability (PWDs) 
 

Section 32 of the General Provisions of the GAA for FY 2020 also requires all 

agencies of the government to formulate plans, programs, and projects intended to 

address the concerns of SCs and PWDs insofar as they relate to the mandated 

functions, and integrate the same in the regular activities of the agencies. 

 



 

 36  

 

The PNVSCA spent P26,000.00 in CY 2020 for the deployment of 17 foreign 

volunteers to assist programs and projects in support of  PWDs and the elderly; and 

three volunteers to provide Filipino Sign Language interpretation during webinars to 

make the agency’s online activities more inclusive to the deaf-mute community. 

 

 

Non-posting of some information/reports in the Transparency Seal 

 

6. Non-posting of some accountability information/reports in the agency’s 
Transparency Seal in its website, for the purpose of promoting transparency and 

enforcing accountability, had not provided the general public vital information 

on the agency’s operations and performance, among others. 

 

In order to enhance transparency and enforce accountability, the following 

laws, rules and regulations were prescribed in the maintenance of Transparency Seal 

in an agency’s website with complete and updated information: 

 

a. Sections 91 (Financial and Physical Reports) and 94 (Transparency 

Seal), General Provisions of GAA FY 2020;  

b. NBC No. 578 dated January 6, 2020;

respectively; and 

d. COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2019-1 dated January 1, 2019. 

 

However, verification of the PNVSCA’s website showed that the agency did 

not fully comply with the requirements of the above-stated regulations, as shown in 

Table 2:

Inquiry with concerned agency personnel revealed that copies of approved 

budget and target, annual physical and financial accountability reports were provided 

to the Web Administrator through email, shared public documents and/or copied in a 

drive for posting in the agency’s Transparency page. For the other reports, such as the 

Report on COA Findings and modifications on the approved budget, it was informed 

that Management was not aware that these reports are required to be posted in the 

agency’s website. 

 

The purpose of sharing government information/reports to the public is to 

promote transparency and enhance accountability of all government agencies. The 

absence of these information/reports did not provide the general public with vital 

government information in assessing the agency’s performance on specific programs, 

propriety of budget utilization and agency’s action/compliance with the audit 

observations and recommendations, among others. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: (a)  direct/instruct the Web 

Administrator to post in the agency’s website the required information in the 

maintenance of its Transparency Seal; and (b) require concerned officers to 

regularly submit reports needed to update posting of necessary 

information/reports in the PNVSCA website on a timely manner.

7. Tax Laws and Regulations, GSIS and Pag-IBIG Premium Contributions and 
Loan Amortizations, PhilHealth Premium Contributions 

 

In CY 2020, the agency had complied with the monthly mandatory deductions 

and remittances of withholding taxes, premiums/contributions and loan amortizations 

pursuant to the regulations issued by BIR, Government Service Insurance System 

(GSIS), Pag-IBIG and PhilHealth, which are summarized in Table 3:

The GSIS sent a Collection Notice to the PNVSCA for outstanding loans of two 

active and 16 inactive personnel who are already separated from the agency. The 

PNVSCA is still in the process of validating the outstanding accounts and reaching 

out to the separated personnel through their last known address for confirmation 

and/or settlement of the accounts. For active personnel, verification disclosed that 

collections and remittances were religiously done by the agency, thus, unrecorded 

payments appearing in the GSIS records will be reconciled.  

 

 

8. GSIS Property Insurance Law 
 

For CY 2020, the PNVSCA had complied with COA Circular No. 2018-002 

dated March 31, 2018 on the submission of Property Inventory form as basis for all 

insurable assets, and paid a total amount of P28,059.85 to GSIS General Insurance 

Fund for the insurance premiums of insurable PPEs with a carrying value of  P3.480 

million as of insurance date.  

 

 

9. Hiring of Casual, Job Orders, Contractual and Consultant 
 

The PNVSCA had observed regulations under the CSC-COA-DBM Joint 

Circular No. 1 dated June 15, 2017, and its amendments, in the hiring of Job Orders 

(JOs)/Contract of Services (CoS) and Consultants, as follows: (a) CoS and JOs do not 

perform functions which are part of the job descriptions of the existing regular 

employees;  (b) CoS and JOs are not designated to positions exercising control or 

supervision over regular and career employees; (c) wage/salary paid were of 

comparable positions in government and includes a premium of up to 20 per cent of 

such salary/wage; and (d)  the terms of contracts do not exceed a maximum period of 

one year, renewable at the option of the Head of the Agency.  

 



 

 39  

 

As at December 31, 2020, the PNVSCA had hired three JOs/CoS with total 

disbursements of P0.771 million for their salaries and wages charged to the agency’s 

budget for MOOE.  

 

The JO/CoS personnel hired possessed relevant background and experience in 

databases and software, advocacy work and program management and other 

information technology-related works to provide technical assistance in the: (a) 

implementation of activities under the Volunteerism for Development 

Communication and Advocacy Program;  (b) operation of the Volunteer Management 

Information and Development Systems  and Volunteer Overseas Tracking System; 

and (c) improvement of the Volunteer Management System Toolkit.  

 

The agency also entered into a contract with a technical writer for P250,000.00 

to draft the National Policy Agenda on Volunteerism document.  

 

 

10. Status of Settlement of Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges 
 

There were no Notices of Suspension, Disallowance or Charge  issued relative 

to the audit of various accounts of the PNVSCA for CY 2020. The P5,970.45 balance 

of prior year’s disallowances was settled with the issuance of Notice of Settlement of 

Suspension, Disallowances and Charges dated November 4, 2020 for the same 

amount.
