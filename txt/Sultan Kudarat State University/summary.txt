EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 

INTRODUCTION 
 

The Sultan Kudarat State University (SKSU) was created on January 18, 2010 by virtue 
of Republic Act No. 9966.  The Act converted the Sultan Kudarat Polytechnic State College into 
a State University including five campuses situated in Tacurong City and municipalities of Isulan, 
Lutayan, Palimbang and Kalamansig.  It is the only state institution of higher education in the 
Province of Sultan Kudarat.  The transfer of the Institute of Arts and Education at the 
Administration site added more campuses to the formerly five campuses.   
 
          The University is mandated primarily to provide advanced instruction and offer 
professional training in science and technology, agriculture, fisheries, education and to other 
relevant fields of study.  It shall also undertake research and extension services, and provide 
progressive leadership in its areas of specialization.  

 
The university is headed by a President assisted by three Vice Presidents namely; 

Research and Development, Academic Affairs and Finance, Administration and Resource 
Generation.  The government of the university is vested in a Board of Regents (BOR).  

 
SCOPE OF AUDIT AND AUDIT METHODOLOGY 

 
A financial audit was conducted on the accounts and operations of SKSU for the year 

2020 with the aim of expressing an opinion on the fairness of presentation of the financial 
statements.  The audit consisted of verification, reconciliation, analysis of accounts on a test basis 
and such other procedures deemed necessary.  A compliance audit was also carried out to 
ascertain the propriety of disbursements, the reliability of financial reports and agency’s 
compliance with government accounting and auditing rules and regulations.  Likewise, an audit 
was conducted to assess whether plans, programs, projects and activities for the year were 
attained in an efficient, economical and effective manner.

OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS 
 

Each year, SKSU is faced with various challenges in its pursuit to carry on its mandate 
primarily to provide advanced instruction and offer professional training in different and relevant 
fields of study.  For CY 2020, greater challenges were encountered due to the global spread of 
COVID-19. SKSU has accepted the sudden changes as opportunities for SKSU to reform and 
take positive steps in carrying its mandate. 

 
AUDITOR’S REPORT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 
The Auditor rendered a modified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the financial 

statements of the SKSU for CY 2020, in view of the effects of the material exceptions observed 
in the course of the audit which are stated in the Independent Auditor’s Report and discussed in 
detail under Part II of same report. 

 
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

I. Favorable Observations 
 

1. Physical accomplishments reached the physical target for: (a) first-time take 
licensure exam takers who pass the licensure exam; (b) undergraduate programs with 
accreditation; (c) number of research outputs in the last three years utilized by 
industry or by other beneficiaries; and (d) number of extension programs organized.  
 

2. Compliance on the maintenance and posting to their official website of the

of Doing Business and efficient Government Service Delivery Act of 2018” and 
ARTA MC No. 2020-02. 

 
II. The following are the significant audit observations with their corresponding 

recommendations: 
 

1. Non-adherence to rules and regulations which resulted in (a) non-submission of 
government contracts within 5 calendar days; (b) payment of government transactions 
with incomplete/improper supporting documents; and (c) failure to judiciously examine 
the provisions of the contract, thus, entering into contract which are not advantageous to 
the government. 



iii 
 

  
We recommended and the Management agreed to (a) submit contracts and 
supporting documents within the prescribed period; (b) require the contractor to 
submit pictures of works as evidence of claims and to prepare a reasonable 
Statement of Work Accomplished in every progress billing; (c) review (BAC) every 
conditions of the contracts and strengthen coordination among all division; (d) 
prepare detailed Statement of Time Lapsed; and (e ) submission of Surety Bond for 
all advance payment released and ensure securities before payment of mobilization 
fee. 

 
2. Non-compliance with various provisions on the grant of honoraria to personnel involved 

in government procurement, hazard pay and representation and transportation allowance 
resulted in deficiencies and irregularities in payment of such expenditures rendering its 
accuracy, validity and legality doubtful. 

 
We recommended and the Management agreed to (a) require refund on the excess 
honoraria given to BAC personnel; (b) strictly adhere with the IRR of RA No. 7305 
or the Magna Carta of PHWs and DBM-DOH JC No. 1, s. 2016, in the grant of 
hazard pay; and (c) ensure that claims for RATA are duly supported with complete 
documents.  
 

3. Non-compliance with the various provisions of PCW-NEDA-DBM JC No. 2012-01, 
PCW MC No. 2019-02, PCW MC No. 2021-01, COA Circular No. 2014-001 resulted to 
delayed and/or non-submission of FY 2020 duly endorsed/approved GAD Plan and 
Budget (GPB) and GAD Accomplishment Report (AR) within the prescribed period and 
failure to utilize at least 5% of the total agency budget to activities supporting GAD plans 
and programs. 
 
We recommended and the Management agreed to (a) strictly comply with PCW-
NEDA-DBM JC No. 2012-01, PCW MC No. 2019-02, PCW MC No. 2021-01, COA 
Circular No. 2014-001, and other PCW-issued guidelines on GAD; and (b) ensure 
that at least five percent (5%) of the total agency budget appropriations authorized 
under the annual GAA is utilized to activities supporting GAD plans and programs 
 

4. Total misstatements/error totalling ₱86,248,765.72 involving various accounts have 
resulted in over/understatements of the affected accounts as at year-end, thus rendering 
questions on the accuracy, completeness and existence of the said accounts as they could 
not be relied upon. 

 
We recommended and the Management agreed to (a) reconcile records and exercise 
prudence in the recording of the collections and deposits; (b) draw accounting entry 
to restore the unreleased checks;   (c)  prepare  the  BRS  for  bank  account at LBP-

which of the amount recorded should be correctly recorded as Accounts Receivable 
and which shall be recorded as Due from NGA- CHED account; (e ) and draw 
necessary accounting entry to correct the misstatement, if possible.  

 
5. Lapses in recording and monitoring of liabilities resulted in erroneous reporting and in 

failure to prepare, maintain and submit supporting schedules, thus, reliability and 
correctness of the University’s obligations could not be ascertained and information 
about the University’s liabilities were not made readily available for use in decision-
making, prompt audit and early detection and correction of errors. 
 
We recommended and the Management agreed to (a) prepare, maintain and submit 
supporting schedules; and (b) conduct thorough review and analysis of all 
outstanding payables, record adjusting entries to reclassify to their proper accounts 
all misclassified accounts and bring the accounts with abnormal balances to its 
correct balance and require regular review and monitoring of all booked 
obligations.

SULTAN KUDARAT STATE UNIVERSITY 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

For the year ended December 31, 2019 
 
 

B. Body 
 
 

1. General Information/ Agency Profile 
 

The consolidated financial statements of Sultan Kudarat State University 
(SKSU) were authorized for issue on May 3, 2021 as shown in the 
Statement of Management Responsibility for Financial Statements signed 
by ROLANDO F. HECHANOVA, Ph.D., the University President. 
 
Sultan Kudarat State University, formerly known as Sultan Kudarat 
Polytechnic State College (SKPSC) was established in 1990, by virtue of 
R.A. No. 6973, otherwise known as the SKPSC Charter.  Unlike other 
state colleges, SKPSC was established out of the five previously 
Department of Education Culture and Sport (DECS) - supervised high 
schools in five municipalities of the province.  The five high schools in 
Isulan, Kalamansig, Palimbang, Tacurong and Lutayan became the core 
for the creation of Sultan Kudarat Polytechnic College.  As the only state 
college in the province, resolutions were made by the local government 
units, expanding its campus all throughout Senator Ninoy Aquino, 
Bagumbayan and even Glan, Sarangani.  For the last three years during the 
term of the then President, Nelson T. Binag, preparations were made for 
the conversion of the state college to university but the bill was archived. 
With the installation of the new president, Dr. Teresita Cambel, on 
January 18, 2010, by virtue of Republic Act No. 9966, SKPSC was 
converted into Sultan Kudarat State University.  The Agency’s registered 
office is located in its Access Campus, EJC Montilla, Tacurong City. 
 

2. Statement of Compliance and Basis of Preparation of Financial 
Statements 
 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with and in compliance with the Philippine Public Sector Accounting 
Standards (PPSAS) issued by the Commission on Audit per COA 
Resolution No. 2014-003 dated January 24, 2014.

The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable 
laws rules and regulations and in conformity with the generally accepted 
state accounting principles and standards. 

 
3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
 

3.1. Basis of Accounting  
 

The consolidated financial statements are prepared on an accrual 
basis in accordance with the Philippine Public Sector Accounting 
Standards (PPSAS).  
 
All expenses are recognized when incurred and reported in the 
financial statements in the period to which they relate.  Income is on 
accrual except for transactions where accrual basis is impractical or 
when other methods are required for by law. 

 
Pursuant to the Education Modernization Act of 1997, the university 
upon recommendation by the Head of the Agency and approval of the 
governing board, may be authorized to use its income and shall no 
longer be required to remit the same to the national treasury. 
 

3.2. Consolidation 
 
a. Consolidated Entities 

 
The consolidated financial statements reflect the assets, liabilities, 
revenues, and expenses of the reporting entity. 

 
b. Trusts under administration 

 
Trusts administered by SKSU are consolidated in the financial 
statements as they are controlled and accounted for by them. 

 
3.3. Financial instruments 

 
a. Financial Assets 

 
Initial recognition and measurement 
 
Financial assets within the scope of PPSAS 29 – Financial 
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement are classified as 
financial assets at fair value through surplus or deficit, held-to-
maturity investments, loans and receivables or available-for-sale 
financial assets, as appropriate.  The SKSU determines the 
classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.

PPSAS 29.10 
PPSAS 30.31 

 
 
 
 



12 
 

The SKSU’s financial assets include: cash – collecting officer, 
cash in bank – local currency, accounts receivables, notes 
receivables, loans receivables – others, and other receivables. 

 
Subsequent Measurement 
 
The subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on their 
classification. 
 
Loans and Receivables 
 
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with 
fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active 
market.  After initial measurement, such financial assets are 
subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective 
interest method, less impairment.  

 
b. Financial Liabilities  

 
Initial recognition and measurement 
 
Financial liabilities within the scope of PPSAS 29 are classified as 
financial liabilities at fair value through surplus of deficit or loans 
and borrowings, as appropriate.  The entity determines the 
classification of its financial liabilities at initial recognition. 
 
Subsequent Measurement 
 
The subsequent measurement of financial liabilities depends on 
their classification. 

 
3.4. Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and cash in bank, 
deposits on call and highly liquid investments with an original 
maturity of three months or less, which are readily convertible to 
known amounts of cash and are subject to insignificant risk of 
changes in value.  For the purpose of the consolidated statement of 
cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term 
deposits as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts. 

 
3.5. Inventories 
 

Inventory is measured at cost upon initial recognition.  To the extent 
that inventory was received through non-exchange transactions (for 
no cost or for a nominal cost), the cost of the inventory is its fair 
value at the date of acquisition.

Costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location and 
conditions are accounted for, as follows: 

 
• Raw materials: purchase cost using the weighted average cost 

method 
 

• Finished goods and work in progress: cost of direct materials 
and labour and a proportion of manufacturing overheads based 
on the normal operating capacity, but excluding borrowing 
costs 

 
Inventories are recognized as an expense when deployed for 
utilization or consumption in the ordinary course of operations of 
SKSU. 

 
Supplies and materials purchased for inventory purposes using the 
Perpetual Inventory System.  The cost of ending inventory of Office 
Supplies and Materials and Other Inventory Items are computed using 
the Moving Average method.  Other Agricultural, Fishery and 
Forestry operations were temporarily deferred due to enhancement of 
fisheries equipment and facilities. 

 
3.6. Property, Plant and Equipment 

 
Recognition 
 
An item is recognized as property, plant, and equipment (PPE) if it 
meets the characteristics and recognition criteria as a PPE. 
 
The characteristics of PPE are as follows: 

• tangible items; 
• are held for use in the production or supply of goods or 

services, for rental to others, of for administrative purposes; and 
• are expected to be used during more than one reporting 

period. 
 
An item of PPE is recognized as an asset if: 

• it is probable that future economic benefits or service 
potential associated with the item will flow to the entity; and 

• the cost or fair value of the item can be measured reliably. 
 

 Depreciation 
 

Each part of an item of property, plant, and equipment with a cost 
that is significant in relation to the total cost of the item is 
depreciated separately.

PPSAS 17.59 
 



14 
 

The depreciation charge for each period is recognized as an expense 
unless it is included in the cost of another asset. 
 
Initial Recognition of Depreciation 
 
Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use such as 
when it is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable 
of operating in the manner intended by management. 

 
Depreciation begins on the second month after the purchase or 
acquisition of the property. 

 
Depreciation Method 
 

The straight line method of depreciation is adopted unless another 
method is more appropriate for agency operation. 

 
Scrap value of ten percent (10%) of the cost of the asset is set and 
deducted from the cost of the property before depreciation is 
computed. 
 
Estimated Useful Life 
 
The SKSU uses the Schedule on the Estimated Useful Life of PPE 
by classification prepared for by COA. 

 
A residual value computed at 10% of the cost of asset is set.  

 
3.7. Intangible Assets 

 
Recognition and Measurement 
 
Intangible assets are recognized when the items are identifiable non-
monetary assets without physical substance; it is probable that the 
expected future economic benefits or service potential that are 
attributable to the assets will flow to the entity; and the cost or fair 
value of the assets can be measured reliably. 
 
Intangible assets acquired separately are initially recognized at cost. 
 
If payment for an intangible asset is deferred beyond normal credit 
terms, its cost is the cash price equivalent.  The difference between 
this amount and the total payments is recognized as interest expense 
over the period of credit unless it is capitalized in accordance with the 
capitalization treatment permitted in PPSAS 5, Borrowing Costs.

Subsequent Measurement 
 
The useful life of the intangible assets is assessed as either finite or 
indefinite.  Intangible assets with a finite are amortized over its useful 
life: 
 
The straight line method is adopted in the amortization of the 
expected pattern of consumption of the expected future economic 
benefits or service potential. 
 
Intangible asset with indefinite useful lives are not be amortized. 

 
The amortization period and the amortization method, for an 
intangible asset with a finite useful life, were received at the end of 
each reporting period.  Changes in the expected useful life or the 
expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits 
embodied in the asset were considered to modify the amortization 
period or method, as appropriate, and were treated as changes in 
accounting estimates. The amortization expense on an intangible asset 
with a finite life is recognized in surplus or deficit as the expense 
category that is consistent with the nature of the intangible asset.  

 
3.8. Revenue from non-exchange transactions 

 
Recognition and Measurement of Assets from Non-Exchange 
Transactions 
 
An inflow of resources from a non-exchange transaction, other than 
services in-kind, that meets the definition of an asset were recognized 
as an asset if the following criteria were met: 
 

• It is possible that the future economic benefits or service 
potential associated with the asset will flow to the entity; and 
 

• The fair value of the asset can be measured reliably. 
 

An asset acquired through a non-exchange transaction is initially 
measured at its fair value as at the date of acquisition. 

 
Transfers from other government entities  
 
Revenues from non-exchange transactions with other government 
entities and the related assets were measured at fair value and 
recognized on obtaining control of the asset were measured at fair 
value and recognized on obtaining control of the asset (cash, goods, 
services and property) if the transfer is free from conditions and it is 
probable that the economic benefits or service potential related to the 
asset will flow to the SKSU and can be measured reliably.

3.9. Revenue from Exchange transactions 
 

Measurement of Revenue 
 

Revenue was measured at the fair value of the consideration received 
or receivable. 

 
SKSU recognizes revenue from Fees.  These are the fees imposed to 
students of state school universities, colleges and public schools.  It 
includes tuition, registration, athletic, cultural, diploma graduation, 
and transcript of recognizes, library, training, entrance examination 
fee, comprehensive examination fee and the like. 

 
Rendering of Services 
 
The SKSU also recognizes revenue from rendering of services by 
reference to the stage of completion when the outcome of the 
transaction can be estimated reliably.  The stage of completion is 
measured by the reference to labor hours. 
 
Where the contract outcome cannot be measured reliably, revenue is 
recognized only to the extent that the expenses incurred were 
recoverable. 
 
Sale of Goods 

 
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognized when the significant 
risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer, 
usually on delivery of the goods and when the amount of revenue can 
be measured reliably and it is probable that the economic benefits or 
service potential associated with the transaction will flow to the 
SKSU. 
 
Interest Income 
 
Interest income is accrued using the effective yield method.  The 
effective yield discounts estimated future cash receipts through the 
expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net carrying amount. 
The method applies this yield to the principal outstanding to 
determine interest income each period. 
 

         Rental Income 
 
Rental income arising from operating leases on investment properties 
accounted for on a straight line basis over the lease terms and 
included in revenue.

3.10. Budget Information 
 
The annual budget was prepared on a cash basis and is published in 
the government website. 

 
A separate Statement of Comparison of Budget and Actual Amounts 
(SCBAA) was prepared since the budget and the financial statements 
were not prepared on comparable basis.  The SCBAA was presented 
showing the original and final budget and the actual amounts on 
comparable basis to the budget.  Explanatory comments as provided 
in the notes to the annual financial statements. 

 
The annual budget figures included in the financial statements were 
for the controlling entity, SKSU.  These budget figures were those 
approved by the governing body both at the beginning and during the 
year following period of consultation with the public. 
 
For purposes of the preparation of the SCBAA, inflows arising from 
assistance and subsidies are not accounted for as receipts as these are 
not technically viewed as income on the part of the agency. 

 
3.11. Impairment of Non-Financial Assets 

 
Impairment of non-cash generating assets 
 
SKSU assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication 
that a non-cash-generating asset may be impaired.  If any indication 
exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, 
SKSU estimates the asset’s recoverable service amount.  An asset’s 
recoverable service amount is the higher of the non-cash generating 
asset’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. 

 
Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable 
service amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down 
to its recoverable service amount.  SKSU classifies assets as cash- 
generating assets when those assets were held with the primary 
objective generating a commercial return.  Therefore, non-cash 
generating assets would be those assets from which the university 
does not intend (as its primary objective) to realize a commercial 
return. 

 
3.12. Honoraria 

 
This account is used to recognize the payment given to professionals 
for services in recognition of their expertise, broad and superior 
knowledge in specific fields and special projects.

similar activities in training institutions including those who render 
services beyond their regular workload. 
 
SKSU identifies the following types of Honoraria as expenses, to 
wit:

3.13. Employee Benefits 

 
The employees of the SKSU are members of the Government 
Service Insurance System (GSIS), which provides life and retirement 
insurance coverage. 
 
SKSU recognizes expenses for accumulating compensated absence 
when these were paid (commuted or paid as terminal leave benefits). 
Unused entitlements that have accumulated at the reporting date 
were not recognized as expense.  Non-accumulating compensated 
absences, like special leave privileges, were not recognized.

PART II – OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
A. Financial and Compliance 
 
1. Non-adherence to rules and regulations which resulted to (a) non-submission of 

government contracts within five calendars days which precluded the timely 
auditorial and technical review of the procurement transactions and prompt 
detection/correction of possible deficiencies; (b) payment of government 
transactions with incomplete/improper supporting documents, which casts 
doubt as to the validity and propriety of the claims; and (c) failure to judiciously 
examine the provisions of the contract, thus, entering into contract which are not 
advantageous to the government. 

  
 The following projects were included in the Annual Investment Plan (AIP) of the 
University. Accordingly, the same were within the approved budget of the agency and in 
the corresponding Annual Procurement Plan (APP) and the supporting Project 
Procurement Management Plan (PPMP) were prepared in accordance with the format 
prescribed by the Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB) which were properly 
approved by the Board of Regents by virtue of BOR Omnibus Resolution Nos. 048-2019 
dated September 26, 2019 and duly revised through BOR resolution No. 064-2020 dated 
October 7, 2020.

 Of the total proposed infrastructure projects, only three were not implemented 
during the year.  For Projects Completion of Gymnasium at Isulan and Upgrading of 
Learning Resource Center at Lutayan Campus, management manifested that it was due to 
the discontinuance advice from the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) as 
evidenced by a Negative SARO released by the DBM.  While, the project Buildings and 
Other Structures sourced from the Tuition Fund amounting to ₱20M was not pushed 
through because the payment from the CHED-UNIFAST was delayed and the University 
prioritized the payment of salaries of JOs and other operating expenditures. 
 
 Despite high obligation rate, the cash utilization rate for implementation of these 
projects is low, which means that while the University has entered into contracts within 
the fiscal year, deliveries or completion were not made within the same year.  One factor 
identified for the delayed completion was due to the strike of the COVID-19 pandemic 
which hampered the continuous work of the contractors.

 Cash-Budgeting System which requires that the completion of construction, 
inspection, acceptance and payment for infra-related capital outlay shall be made not later 
than December 31, 2021, while the delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment for 
MOOE and other CO items shall not be later than June 30, 2021.1  Given the same, an 
effective and efficient monitoring of projects must be in place, to ensure that all projects 
are completed, inspected and accepted within the deadline set by the DBM. 
 
 In our review and verification of the implementation of ongoing infrastructure 
projects, we have observed the following: 
 
Delayed/Non- submission of government contracts  
 
 Within five working days from the execution of a contract by the government or 
any of its subdivisions, agencies or instrumentalities, including government-owned and 
controlled corporations and their subsidiaries, a copy of said contract and each of all the 
documents forming part thereof by reference or incorporation shall be furnished to the 
Auditor of the agency concerned.  In case of agencies audited on an engagement basis, 
submission of a copy of the contract and its supporting documents shall be to the Auditor 
of the mother agency or parent company, as the case may be.2 
 

Copy of government contracts, purchase orders and their supporting documents 
totaling 449 with corresponding amount of ₱187,668,492.72 were delayed, if not 
submitted within the prescribed period, with delays ranging from 1 to 275 days as of 
year-end, inconsistent with Items 3.1.1 and 3.2.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated 
February 12, 2009.

 Contrary to the above-mentioned rule, copies of completed contracts were 
belatedly, if not submitted, to the audit team, thus, precluded the timely auditorial and 
technical review of the procurement transactions and prompt detection/correction of 
possible deficiencies. Likewise, the legality, validity and reasonableness of the terms and 
conditions embodied therein were not ascertained. 
 
 The management reasoned-out that the Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) was 
not, by any means, made aware of COA Circular 2009-001 that mandates the submission 
of government contracts and supporting documents to the Office of the Auditor. Further, 
the implementation of community quarantine when movement was only allowed 
sometime in June, prevented the early submission of contracts and supporting documents.  
Management committed to abide said COA Circular. 
 
Recommendation: 
 
 We recommended and the management agreed to adhere strictly to the 
prescribed period in the submission of contracts and supporting documents to the 
Office of the Auditor to avoid the penalties provided under Section 4.1 of COA 
Circular No. 2009-001, and facilitate the timely audit of transaction covered by 
these contracts. 
 
Progress billings of various infrastructure projects were paid despite insufficient and 
non-substantial documents attached to support the claims 
 
 We have post-audited transactions relative to the payment for the following 
projects and observed several deficiencies discussed below.  Some minor deficiencies 
were discussed with the management and were immediately corrected.

Non-submission of substantial pictures showing the works before, during and after 
construction of items of work especially the embedded items 
 
 Section 9.1.1 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 requires that 
picture before, during and after the works especially those embedded items must be 
attached to the claims of every progress payments.  While pictures are attached to the 
claims, it was observed that only limited copies of pictures were provided which do not 
show substantially the actual status of the project.  Moreover, pictures before the works 
were started, during the construction and the embedded items were likewise not attached. 
 
 It must be noted that pictures attached to the claims serve as reference by those 
who facilitate the payment and approval of the transactions and who were not present 
during the site inspection of the project.  It serves also as evidence to the actual works 
accomplished by the contractor at a given time. 
 
 During interview, it was revealed that the one who took the pictures are the 
University’s Resident Engineers during their site inspection. Also, no pictures were 
submitted by the contractors, hence, only pictures during the site visit are captured.  
Those works during and the embedded items were dispensed.  University Accountant, on 
the other hand, manifested that in the processing of the claims, they are relying on the 
certification issued by the Resident Project Engineer as determination of the actual 
accomplishment through examination of pictures were beyond their expertise.  
 
Recommendation: 
 
 We recommended and the management agreed to require the contractor to 
submit substantial pictures to show the works before, during especially those 
embedded items to serve as evidence in the processing of the claims.

Irregular preparation of Statement of Work Accomplished 
 
 The Statement of Work Accomplished should show the amounts which the 
CONTRACTOR considers itself to be entitled to, to cover the cumulative value of the 
works executed to date based on the items in the Bill of Quantities (BOQ).3  Contrary 
thereto, it is worth noting that the Certificate of Work Accomplished on all projects under 
audit were prepared by a University Resident Engineer instead of the contractor.  This 
practice is a pre-emption of the actual accomplishment that a contractor may actually 
claim.  Moreover, this team believes that it is the contractor who has the actual data as to 
the actual works accomplished, actual materials purchased, and actual laborers paid, 
which the agency’s representative will later verify based on his actual site inspection.  If 
in case the claims of the contractor seems unreasonable based on evaluation and 
verification, the agency’s representative may anytime recommend for review of the 
Statement of Work Accomplishment (SWA) prior to the approval of the Head of the 
Procuring Entity (HoPE). This audit team firmly believes that the role of the agency or its 
representative/s is limited to verification of the works accomplished as claimed by the 
contractor, it does not play the role on the preparation of the statement of work 
accomplished on behalf of the contractor. 
 
 In an interview, representative from Planning Division manifested that the Project 
Resident Engineer is the one who prepared the Certificate of Work Accomplishment 
since the one prepared by the contractor is bloated or unreasonable.  It was more 
convenient for them to prepare since the one prepared by the contractor are most of the 
time returned and being revised.  When asked as to the basis of their preparation, the 
representative replied that they based their evaluation on the actual work accomplished 
based on the site visit.  They do not have an on hand data as to the amount of actual 
materials used and the laborers paid for in the project.  
 
 Henceforth, this audit team believed that the claims of the contractor as contained 
in the Statement of Work Accomplished is indispensable.  The role of the Procuring 
Entity’s (PEs) representative is to verify as to whether or not the claims of the contractor 
is reasonable and/or realistic.  
 
 Management, in response to this observation, committed to require the contractors 
to submit the SWA in support to their claims for progress billing. Likewise, the assigned 
Project Engineer, shall validate the submitted SWA and will prepare a separate report 
based on the actual accomplishment during site inspection.

Recommendation: 
 
 We recommended and the management agreed to require the contractor to 
prepare a reasonable Statement of Work Accomplished in every progress billing, let 
its representative/s validate contractor’s claims prior to the approval of the HoPE. 
 
Payment of first/progress billing 
 
 The Contractor may submit a request for payment for Work accomplished.  Such 
request for payment shall be verified and certified by the Procuring Entity’s 
Representative/Project Engineer.  Except as otherwise stipulated in the Special 
Conditions of the Contract (SCC), materials and equipment delivered on the site but 
not completely put in place shall not be included for payment.4 
  
 However, the SCC provides otherwise that materials and equipment delivered on 
the site but not completely put in place shall be included for payment.  That being the 
case, this Audit Team found that such provision of the contract is disadvantageous to the 
government.  Materials delivered to the site which are not completely put in place are 
exposed to high risk of loss and/or misuse.  In such a case, the PE might be paying for 
materials or equipment which are not actually used in the project. 
 
 Likewise, Section 40.4 of the Philippine Bidding Documents (PBDs) issued for 
the procurement of infrastructure projects provides that the first payment may be paid by 
the PE to the Contractor provided that at least twenty percent (20%) of the work has 
been accomplished as Certified by the PE's Representative.  For the following projects, 
first payment was made even when the work accomplished is less than 20%, to wit: 
 

Project Name Percentage of 
Accomplishment 

Upgrading/Renovation of Learning Resource Center at SKSU Kalamansig 15.34% 
Completion of Men's Dormitory 15.19% 
Three-storey Academic Building at Isulan Campus 15.04% 
Upgrading of Learning Resource Center (Library) at Bagumbayan Campus 15.57% 
Academic Building at Lutayan Campus 10.08% 
Academic Building at Tacurong Campus 14.63% 

 
 Interview revealed that there is lack of coordination as to the implementation of 
this provision of the contract.  Inadvertently, the Planning and the Accounting Divisions 
were not aware that there is such a provision in the PBDs. 

                                                           
4 Clause 40.1, Section IV General Condition of Contract of the Philippine Bidding Documents 



 

46 

 

Recommendation: 
 
 We recommended and the management agreed that (a) the BAC shall review 
every conditions of the contract provided in the PBDs to ensure that only those 
items which are advantageous to the government are included; and (b) strengthen 
coordination among all divisions to ensure that all conditions of the contract are 
enforced in favor of the government. 
 
Statement of Time Lapsed do not contain substantial information  
 
 Section 9.1.1 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012, requires the 
attachment of Statement of Time Lapsed for every progress payments.  While the 
statement of time lapsed was attached in the claims, it does not include substantial 
information to help the users in monitoring the time progress of the projects.  To increase 
usefulness of the statement, it must include data as to the actual date of commencement 
of the work, the total number of days allowed, any extensions whether due to work 
suspension or variations, the time lapsed for each progress payment, the cumulative time 
elapsed as of the date of the claim and the estimated date of completion.  It must be noted 
that this statement shall serve as a monitoring tool of the management and contractor as 
to the time elapsed in the project and may show the possible delays in the project.  Thru 
this statement, management can easily track the lapsing of time as compared to the work 
accomplished and determine whether the project is accomplished on time in accordance 
with the plan. 
 
 Moreover, there are times that the attached Statements of Time Lapsed do not 
account in a timely manner the time extensions in case of work suspensions and/or 
variation order, thus, the usefulness of the said statement is reduced. 
 
 Management admitted that only the percentage of time lapsed was included in the 
Certification and there were no data as to actual date of commencement of the work, the 
total number of days allowed, any extensions whether due to work suspension or 
variations, the time lapsed for each progress payment, the cumulative time elapsed and 
the estimated date of completion, including extensions (if applicable). 
 
Recommendation: 
 
 We recommended and the management agreed to instruct the Planning 
Division to prepare a detailed Statement of Time Lapsed to increase its usefulness 
and help management in its decision-making.

Agency failed to secure an irrevocable standby letter of credit of equivalent value from 
a commercial bank, a bank guarantee or a Surety Bond callable upon demand, issued 
by a surety or insurance company duly licensed by the Insurance Commission and 
confirmed by the PE. 
 
 The advance payment shall be made only upon the submission to and acceptance 
by the PE of an irrevocable standby letter of credit of equivalent value from a commercial 
bank, a bank guarantee or a Surety Bond callable upon demand, issued by a surety or 
insurance company duly licensed by the Insurance Commission and confirmed by the 
PE.5 
 
 Performance Security.  To guarantee the faithful performance by the winning 
Bidder of its obligations under the contract, it shall post a performance security within a 
maximum period of ten calendar days from receipt of the Notice of Award from the PE 
and in no case later than the signing of the contract.6 
 
 In our review of the financial transactions relative to the payment of mobilization 
fee, the University failed to secure a Surety Bond or standby letter of credit from the 
contractors when releasing the 15% mobilization fee.  What is attached in the payment 
for the advance payment was a Performance Bond which pertains to the Performance 
Security required under Section 32 of the Instruction to Bidders of the PBDs.  It must be 
noted that the Surety Bond required in the payment of mobilization fee is a different bond 
from that of the Performance Bond. 
 
 An irrevocable standby letter of credit is a legal document that guarantees a 
bank’s commitment of payment to a seller in the event that the buyer or the bank’s client 
defaults on the agreement.  Thus, this serves as a security of the PE in case the contractor 
defaults.  For the following projects, the mobilization fee were released unsecured: 
 

Name of the Project Amount Paid 
Mini-grandstand at ACCESS Campus ₱844,997.12 
Renovation of Ladies Dormitory at ACCESS Campus 2,155,201.88 
Academic Building at Lutayan Campus 1,198,915.11 
Completion of Academic Building for GS at ACCESS Campus 1,550,094.99 
Academic Building at Tacurong Campus 2,304,762.08 

Total ₱8,053,971.18 

 

                                                           
5 Item 39.2, Section IV General Condition of Contract of the Philippine Bidding Documents 
6 Item 32, Section II Instructions to Bidders of the Philippine Bidding Documents

 The University Accountant manifested that it is the BAC who monitors the 
submission of the Surety Bond, however, verification revealed that the University 
Accountant refers to the Performance Bond which is submitted by the Winning bidder to 
ensure faithful performance of the projects.  The Surety Bond required for the payment of 
the 15% mobilization is a different bond as that of the Performance Bond.  This shall 
serve as the security of the PE for the advance payment made to the contractor. 
 
 The management commented that it has been of the understanding that the 
Performance Bond submitted by the supplier, as required by R.A 9184 and specified 
under items 32.1 and 32.2 of the PBD for Infrastructure Projects, is the security required 
in exchange for all payments due to the contractor and that is has not seen it as a financial 
threat to the agency as the Performance Bond covers the whole amount of the contract, 
thereby protecting the Government from unfavourable financial consequences. 
 
Recommendation 
 
 We recommended and the management agreed to require the submission of 
Surety Bond for all the advance payments released, and ensure that an irrevocable 
standby letter of credit of equivalent value from a commercial bank, a bank 
guarantee or a Surety Bond callable upon demand is secured first before payment 
of mobilization fee. 
 
Non-submission of PERT-CPM 
 
 Project Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) – Critical Path Method 
(CPM) is a statistical tool used in project management, which was designed to analyze 
and represent the tasks involved in completing a given project.7  It is used to plan, 
schedule and control complex projects.  The PERT-CPM is part of the Program of 
Work8.  
 
 There are identified transactions wherein 10%-14% of works were accomplished 
in a span of seven days from the commencement of the work.  In the absence of the 
PERT-CPM, the reasonableness of such claim is doubtful.   
 
 It is also important to note whether a 40.07% work accomplished as against 
75.71% of the contract time already lapsed is still reasonable, as in the case of payment

for second billing to Blimex Construction and Supply for the Upgrading of Learning 
Resource Center (Library) at Bagumbayan Campus.  Similarly, the work accomplished 
by Adame Construction and Supply for the construction of Academic Building at 
Lutayan Campus during its third billing is 39.88%, while the rate of time elapsed is 
already 84%.  Through the PERT-CPM, it can be determine whether there is delay and 
which item of works were already behind the schedule.  Thus, management can 
immediately notify the contractor of such delay.  
 
 Representative disclosed that PERT-CPM are most of the time not submitted.  
Also, these were not updated in case of work extension or variation orders.  Non-
submission thereof, prevented the timely monitoring of the accomplishment as compared 
with the PERT-CPM.  It cannot be determined on time whether the work is accomplished 
in accordance with the plan and the contract. 
 
 The Management has noted the comments and recommendations; thus, 
resolutions and memoranda were prepared and issued in compliance with the foregoing 
audit observation.  
 
Recommendation: 
 
 We recommended and the management agreed to require the contractor to 
submit PERT-CM prior to the signing of the contract as well as revisions thereof 
whenever there are changes made during the contract implementation to ensure 
timely monitoring of the work accomplished. 
 
 
2. Non-compliance with various provisions on the grant of honoraria to personnel 

involved in government procurement, hazard pay and representation and 
transportation allowance resulted in deficiencies and irregularities in payment 
of such expenditures rendering their accuracy, validity and legality doubtful. 

 
Honoraria- Government Personnel involved in Government Procurement 
 
Non-compliance with the provisions of DBM Budget Circular 2004-5A resulted in 
inaccuracies in the computation of the honoraria given to Bids and Awards Committee 
(BAC) members, secretariat and Technical Working Group (TWG), thus incurrence of 
irregular expenditure amounting to ₱748,188.45. 
 



 

50 

 

Section 51 of DBM Budget Circular No. 2004-5A provides the following 
guidelines on the grant of honoraria to BAC and TWG chair and members: 

5.1 The chairs and members of Bids and A wards Committee (BAC) and the 
Technical Working Group (TWG) may be paid honoraria only for successfully 
completed projects. Xxx… 

A procurement project shall be considered successfully completed once the 
contract has been awarded to the winning bidder. 

5.2 The payment of honoraria shall be limited to procurement that involves 
competitive bidding. Competitive bidding activities are present only in: 

• Open and competitive bidding; 
• Limited source bidding; 
• Negotiated procurement under Section 53(a) of the IRR-A, where there 

has been failure of bidding for the second time; and 
• Negotiated procurement under Section 53(b) of the IRR-A following the 

procedures under Section 54.2(b) thereof. 
 
5.3 The honoraria of each person shall not exceed the rates indicated below per 
completed procurement project: 

 
 Maximum Honorarium Rate 

per Procurement Project 
BAC Chair 3,000.00 
BAC Members 2,500.00 
TWG Chair and Members 2,000.00 

5.4 The average amount of honoraria per month over one year shall not exceed 
twenty five percent (25%) of the basic monthly salary. The honoraria, however, 
shall be paid only upon the successful completion of each procurement. 

5.6 The members of the BAC Secretariat who are performing the attendant 
functions in additions to their regular duties in other non-procurement units of the 
agency may likewise be paid honoraria at the same rate as the TWG Chair and 
Members, subject to the same regulations. 

 It was observed that honoraria were granted to BAC chair and members and 
TWG on a monthly basis at a uniform rate.  The honoraria were computed at 25% of the 
basic monthly salary rather than using the rate provided in Section 5.3 of the above-cited 
circular. 



 

51 

 

 Inquiry with the personnel in charge of the preparation of payroll for said 
honoraria revealed that they indeed determined the amount of honoraria based on the 
salary rate, regardless of the number of successfully completed procurement projects on a 
given date contrary to the provisions of the above–cited budget circular.

 Using the rate specified under 5.3 of the aforementioned budget circular and the 
total number of successfully completed projects (table 1) for CY 2020, considering the 
limitation set at 25% of the basic monthly salary, each of the BAC chair and members 
and TWG shall be granted honoraria, at most, as follows:

 Honoraria paid to BAC Member, Secretariat and TWG in excess of the rates 
provided in the aforementioned circular are considered irregular expenditures.9  
 
 The management recognizes its lapses in the computation of BAC Honoraria and 
noted and agreed with the recommendation to make refunds in 2021 and adhere with the 
provisions on the proper calculation of BAC Honoraria. 
  
Recommendation: 
 
 We recommended and the Management agreed to: 
 

1. Exercise prudence and diligence in approving payment of honoraria to 
personnel involved in procurement activities to ensure that the granting of 
honoraria to personnel involved in government procurement is in 
accordance with Section 5.3 of DBM Budget Circular 2004-5A and Republic 
Act No. 9184 and its 2016 IRR. Documentary requirements provided under 
Section 5.7.1 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 to support 
propriety of the claims must be attached; and  
 

2. Require the refund of the honoraria given in excess of the allowable rate. 
 
Magna Carta for Public Health Workers 
 
Non-compliance with the provisions of R.A 7305 and its IRR and DBM-DOH Joint 
Circular No. 1, s . 2016 dated July 15, 2016 resulted in payment of Hazard Pay 
amounting to ₱921,161.25 for CY 2020 to employees despite non-exposure to specific 
health hazard and/or without proof of exposure thereat for at least fifty percent (50%) 
of their working hours, thus entitlement to hazard pay is uncertain and the legality of 
the expenditure remains doubtful. Further, failure to strictly monitor the utilization of 
RLE fund resulted in payment of Hazard Pay exceeding the budget by ₱713,969.40.

 Hazard Pay is an additional compensation for performing hazardous duties and 
for enduring physical hardships in the course of performance of duties.10 
  
 Public health workers (PHW) in hospitals, sanitaria, rural health units, main 
health centers, health infirmaries, barangay health stations, clinics and other health-
related establishments located in difficult areas, strife-torn or embattled areas, distressed 
or isolated stations, prisons camps, mental hospitals, radiation-exposed clinics, 
laboratories or disease-infested areas or in areas declared under state of calamity or 
emergency for the duration thereof which expose them to great danger, contagion, 
radiation, volcanic activity/eruption, occupational risks or perils to life as determined by 
the Secretary of Health or the Head of the unit with the approval of the Secretary of 
Health, shall be compensated hazard allowances11 
 

Section 3.2 of DBM-DOH Joint Circular No. 1, s. 2016 dated July 15, 2016 
further enumerates areas and circumstances where PHW may be granted with hazard pay. 

   Section 7, Rule XV of the Revised IRR of RA 7305 provide additional guidelines 
regarding entitlement to hazard pay benefits, and outlines the procedure for the 
determination of a public health worker’s entitlement to hazard pay. 
  
 According thereat, “All public health workers covered under RA 7305 are eligible 
to receive hazard pay when the nature of their work exposes them to high risk/low risk 
hazards for at least fifty percent (50%) of their working hours as determined and 
approved by the Secretary of Health or his authorized representative”12. 
  
 Moreover, on the entitlement and determination of personnel exposed to hazard, 
“Each Agency shall prepare a list of position in its plantilla with the corresponding job 
description that describes the basis for justifying such position that are exposed to 
high/low risk hazard. The list shall be reviewed by a DOH technical committee Xxx..13” 
  
 On October 30, 2017, the College of Nursing, through its Dean, requested the 
management to allow its faculty, to enjoy hazard pay for exposure to infection and health 
threatening conditions in the hospital setting as part of their job function in the actual 
exposure for the related learning experience (RLE) of the students. The same was 
approved by the President considering also the provisions of its Board Resolution No. 
119, s. 2011 dated June 7, 2011 on the utilization of RLE Fund.

 Based on the documents supporting claims for Hazard Pay, the number of hours 
spent on RLE of the employees, which the agency claimed to have exposed its employees 
to certain health hazards are as follows:

 It appears that the University is not compliant with the RA 7305, its Revised IRR 
and other related provisions, as manifested by the following: 
 

a. Failure to prepare and submit the list of positions in its plantilla with 
corresponding job description justifying such positions that are exposed to high or 
low risk hazard and review of such list by the DOH technical committee;

b. Failure to show existence of exposure to such hazards as determined by the 
Secretary of Health or by the head of agency with the former's approval (prior to 
COVID); and 
 

c. Payment of Hazard pay at a fixed rate using the rate provided in Section 3.3 of 
DBM-DOH Joint Circular No. 1,s. 2016 without consideration to the entitlement 
thereof of the employees. As can be gleaned in Table 4 and 5, employees were 
remunerated with hazard pay even if there is no actual exposure to hazard in a 
given month and/or the total number of hours of exposure is less than 50% of the 
working hours. As mentioned earlier, a PHW is only entitled to Hazard Pay when 
the nature of their work exposes them to high risk/low risk hazards for at least 
fifty percent (50%) of their working hours as determined and approved by the 
Secretary of Health or his authorized representative 

 
 Entitlement to Hazard Pay is not absolute. As the instructors/employees did not 
meet the conditions provided in the previously cited provisions, unless proven otherwise, 
payment of hazard pay is without any legal basis. 
 
 Further, the Management failed to strictly monitor the utilization of its RLE Fund 
as the Hazard Pay goes beyond its approved budget/utilization rate.  

Board Resolution No. 119, s. 2011 approved the new rate and utilization of annual 
RLE Fee. Based thereat, Annual RLE Fee shall be utilized as follows: 

Clinical Instructors Honorarium      60% 
Base Hospital         20% 
Skills Laboratory Equipment purchase and Maintenance   5% 
Faculty Development, Travel, Hazard Pay     5% 

  Administrative Cost       10% 
  Total        100% 

The payment of Hazard Pay, including expenditures for faculty development and 
travel shall be limited to 5% of the total annual RLE Fee/collection. Total RLE collection 
for CY 2020 amounted to ₱4,143,837.00. Only 5% of such or ₱207,191.85 is to be 
utilized for such purpose. However, a total of ₱921,161.25 was paid as hazard pay in 
2020 alone, incurring up to 22% of the total RLE collection and exceeding the budget by 
₱713,969.40. 



 

56 

 

 The Management manifested that the approved RLE utilization was made in 2011 
and inadvertently was not proposed for amendment due to busy schedules. It was agreed 
that proposal will be made for adjusting the RLE utilization rate for hazard pay. Further, 
the management argued that the clinical instructors were exposed to risks as frontliners 
during the COVID 19 pandemic. The audit team argued that the COVID Hazard Pay is 
covered by separate guidelines and the audit team raises no question relative thereto. 
Furthermore, it was manifested that steps were made to comply with the recommendation 
on submitting the list approved by the Secretary of Health. 

Recommendation: 

We recommended and the Management agreed that the Accountant and 
other personnel involved shall: 

1. Submit justification on payment of hazard pay despite absence of evidence of 
actual exposure to hazard and/or proof that they have been exposed to 
hazard for more than 50% of their working hours; 
  

2. Strictly adhere with RA No. 7305 and its IRR or the Magna Carta of PHWs 
and DBM-DOH JC No. 1, s. 2016, in the grant of hazard pay;  
 

3. Identify and determine the specific positions that are eligible to receive 
hazard pay with descriptions as to actual exposure to occupational risk/perils 
to life and submit to the Audit Team for verification the required list of 
personnel duly reviewed and approved by the Secretary of Health; and 

 
4. Submit justification for utilizing more than 5% of the RLE fund for payment 

of hazard pay. 
 
Representation Allowance and Travel Allowance (RATA) 
 
The University paid RATA amounting to ₱336,000.00 despite non-submission of 
supporting documents, contrary to Section 4(6) of P.D 1445 and Section 5.2 of COA 
Circular 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012, casting doubt on the reliability and 
correctness of the payment. 
 

Claims against government funds shall be supported with complete 
documentation.14 

                                                           
14 Section 4(6) of P.D 1445 



 

57 

 

 RATA is a collective term for two distinct but complimentary allowances: 
Representation Allowance (RA) and Transportation Allowance (TA). Both allowances 
are provided to selected government officials to cover related expenses incidental to and 
in connection with the actual performance of their respective function.15  
 
 It was observed that disbursements for RATA were not supported by (a) 
certification that the official/employee did not use and is not assigned any government 
vehicle and (b) a certificate or evidence of service rendered or duly approved DTR. 
 
 Certification that the official/employee did not use or is not assigned any 
government vehicle is necessary to determine the entitlement of the government 
personnel to TA. It must be noted that TA, whether in full or partial amounts, shall not be 
granted to officials who are assigned or actually using government motor 
transportation16.   
 
 Certificate or evidence of service rendered or duly approved DTR is needed to 
determine the amount of RATA to be granted based on the actual work performance on 
workdays. A rationalized scheme for this purpose is prescribed in Section 6 of NBC 548. 
 
 Failure to attach both documents precluded the audit team from timely 
determination of the accuracy and validity of the RATA granted.   
 
 The management, in its reply to AOQ 2021-002, recognizes its lapses in 
observing the requirements laid down in Section 5.2 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 and 
committed to comply with all documentary requirements.  
 
Recommendation: 
 
 We recommended and the Management agreed to: 
 

1. Ensure that claims for RATA are duly supported with complete documents 
pursuant to COA Circular 2012-001. Entitlement to RATA must be 
warranted and the actual work performance in workdays must be taken into 
consideration; and 
 

2. Submit the documentary requirements for 2020 claims.

3. Non-compliance with various provisions of PCW-NEDA-DBM JC No. 2012-01, 
PCW MC No. 2019-02, PCW MC No. 2021-01, COA Circular No. 2014-001,  
resulted to delayed and/or non-submission of FY 2020 duly endorsed/approved 
GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) and GAD Accomplishment Report (AR) within 
the prescribed period and failure to utilize at least five percent (5%) of the total 
agency budget appropriations authorized under the annual GAA to activities 
supporting GAD plans and programs, hence failing to support the government 
in its commitment to uphold the law on gender equality. 

 
 Responsibility of the Audited Agency:  The Audited Agency shall submit a copy 
of the Annual GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) to the COA Audit Team assigned to the 
agency within five working days from the receipt of the approved plan from the PCW or 
their mother or central offices as the case maybe.  Likewise, a copy of the corresponding 
AR shall be furnished to the said Audit Team within five working days from the end of 
January of the preceding year.17 
 
 On the other hand, the preparation and submission of the Annual GPB and AR is 
prescribed by Joint Circular (JC) No. 2012-01 issued by the DBM, NEDA and PCW, as 
follows: 
 
 8.0 SUBMISSION, REVIEW AND ENDORSEMENT OF THE AGENCY GAD 
PLAS AND BUDGETS 
 
 8.1 Pursuant to Section 37A.1 of the MCW-IRR, all agencies, offices, bureaus 
and all government instrumentalities and other concerned shall formulate their annual 
GPBs within the context of their mandates. 
 
 8.2 SUCs with several constituent units shall observe the same process of 
submission.  The Commission on Higher Education (CHED) or its designated regional 
offices or gender resource centers shall review the submission of SUCs and forward the 
same to PCW for endorsement to DBM. 
 
 10.0 PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION OF GAD ACCOMPLISHMENT 
REPORTS 
 
 10.1 Attached agencies, bureaus, regional offices, constituent units and all other 
concerned shall submit their GAD ARs to theirs central offices.  The agency GFPS shall 
prepare the annual GAD AR based on the PCW-endorsed GPB or the GPB adjusted to 

                                                           
17 Section V of COA Circular No. 2014-001 



 

59 

 

the approved GAA following the form prescribed in ANNEX B.  Activities completed 
until the end of the year may be included in the final GAD AR of the agency 
submitted to PCW in January. (Emphasis ours) 
 
 Further, paragraph 1.2.2.3 of PCW MC No. 2019-02 provides that in case of 
SUCs, in line with CHED Memorandum Order No. 1, s. 2015, SUC GPBs shall first be 
submitted to and reviewed by the concerned regional office of the CHED.  After which, 
the CHED regional office shall endorse the GPB to the CHED Central Office for 
validation. Once the GOBs are acceptable to the CHED Central Office, it shall submit the 
GPB to PCW, for review and endorsement. 
 
 Paragraph 1.2.4.2 of the Memorandum Circular prescribes that the PCW-endorsed 
GPBs shall be authenticated by the Gender Mainstreaming Monitoring System (GMMS) 
with a QR code.  Concerned agencies shall print the endorsed GPB for signature of their 
agency head and submit signed copies to PCW and their respective COA Audit Team 
within five working days from endorsement. 
 
 Contrary thereto, submission of a copy of the GPB to the Audit Team was way 
beyond the deadline set under PCW MC 2019-02 which must be 5 working days after 
endorsement to PCW.  The submitted copy of the GPB was not PCW-endorsed which 
showed a note on the document status as UNENDORSED as of the time of report 
generation on March 25, 2021. 
 
 On the other hand, Memorandum Circular No. 2021-01 dated January 20, 2021 
prescribes that the deadline of SUCs for the encoding and submission of FY 2020 GAD 
Accomplishment Report (AR) through the GMMS, for review of CHED regional offices 
shall be February 26, 2021.  
 
 For SUCs, their GAD ARs that have been submitted through the GMMS shall 
first be reviewed by the concerned CHED regional office.  Once the GAD AR has been 
reviewed, the CHED regional office shall submit the GAD AR to PCW.18 
 
 FY 2020 GAD ARs submitted to the PCW shall be authenticated by the GMMS 
with a barcode.  Concerned agencies shall print the final GAD AR for signature of their 
agency head and submit signed copies to PCW and their respective COA Audit Team.19

19 Section 6.0 Ibid

 On the contrary, the GAD AR submitted to this office on March 31, 2021 
contained a notation that the document status is UNDER REVIEW, which indicates that 
the required GAD AR was not submitted on time to the CHED regional office through 
the GMMS. 
 
 Nevertheless, scrutiny of the contents of GAD AR revealed that it cannot be 
determined whether the implemented GAD Activities and the related Actual Results 
addressed the gender issues identified since the GAD AR is not duly reviewed/approved 
as required in the PCW MC No. 2021-01;  

 
 While it is manifested that 15 out of 19 Gender Issues/GAD Mandate were done, 
it was observed that only 0.05% or ₱276,370.45 of the total GAD Budget was utilized.  
This indicates failure of the management to attribute expenditure of a major agency 
program/project to GAD using existing tools, such as the Harmonized Gender and 
Development Guidelines (HGDG), to ensure that the different concerns of women and 
men in the University are addressed equally and equitably in their PAPs. 

 
  Moreover, review of the accounting records revealed that only ₱59,948.50 was 
actually recorded as expenditures for GAD Activities, broken down as follows: 
 

Source of Fund Amount 
Fund 164 ₱43,500.00 
Fund 101 16,448.50 
Total ₱59,948.50 

 
 We stress the importance of observing the guidelines in PCW-NED-DBM JC No. 
2012-01, PCW MC No. 2019-02, PCW MC No. 2021-01 and COA Circular No. 2014-
001, as well as keeping updated with the rules and regulations issued by the PCW in the 
for preparation and submission of the Annual GPB and GAD AR not just for compliance 
purposes but also because they facilitate management’s policy-making, budgeting, and 
monitoring of GAD Activities.  Management is hereby enjoined to uphold these rules and 
regulations to help government’s commitment to achieve the goal on gender equality. 
 
 The audit observation was well noted and taken and the Management, through its 
GAD Coordinator, agreed to comply with the recommendations. 
 
Recommendation: 
 
 We recommended and the Management agreed to: 



 

61 

 

 
a.  Strictly comply with PCW-NEDA-DBM JC No. 2012-01, PCW MC No. 2019-

02, PCW MC No. 2021-01, COA Circular No. 2014-001, and other PCW-
issued guidelines on GAD; and 

 
b. Ensure that at least five percent (5%) of the total agency budget 

appropriations authorized under the annual GAA is utilized for activities 
supporting GAD plans and programs. 

 
 
4. Total misstatements/error totalling ₱86,248,765.72 involving various accounts 

have resulted in over/understatements of the affected accounts as at year-end, 
thus rendering questions on the accuracy, completeness and existence of the said 
accounts as they could not be relied upon. 

 
 International Standard of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAI) 1320 deals with the 
materiality in planning and performing an audit. It defines materiality as misstatements, 
including omission, are considered to be material if they, individually or in aggregate, 
could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decision of users taken on the 
basis of the financial statements. It also requires the application of the concept of 
materiality both in planning and performing an audit of financial statements, and 
evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on the audit and of uncorrected 
misstatements, if any, on the financial statements and in forming the opinion in the 
auditor’s report. 
 
 Total Asset was selected as the most appropriate benchmark since the agency is 
not a profit-oriented.  Sultan Kudarat State University is mandated primarily to provide 
advanced instruction and offer professional training in science and technology, 
agriculture, fisheries, education and to other relevant fields of study.  It shall also 
undertake research and extension services, and provide progressive leadership in its areas 
of specialization. The auditor used the previous year’s financial statements as she sees 
that the current year’s financial results are likely to be the same and applied conservatism 
in choosing appropriate percentage for overall materiality computation which is .5% of 
the total assets. 
 
 The Financial Statements shall present fairly the financial position, financial 
performance and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires faithful representation 
of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with the 



 

62 

 

definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in 
PPSAS.20

 Section 39, Chapter 5 of Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National 
Government Agencies (NGAs) prescribes the manner of reporting receipts and deposits 
as follows:  
 

a. At the close of the business day, the Collecting Officers shall prepare the Report 
of Collections and Deposits (RCD) for submission to Accounting Office/Unit. 
The report lists all the ORs issued in numerical sequence including cancelled 
ones.  
 

b. The RCD shall be supported by documentary evidence such as duplicate copies of 
ORs and validated deposit slips.  

 
c. The Collecting government entity issuing electronic Official Receipt (eOR) 

should generate and submit daily to the Auditor a copy of the RCD. In case the

collection system is not integrated with the accounting system, the Accounting 
Unit shall recognize the collections and deposits based on the generated reports 
duly certified by the Collecting Officer/Cashier/Head of Treasury or Cash Unit.  
 

d. Field Offices (FOs)/Operating Units (OUs) without complete set of books shall 
record their collections of income chronologically in the Cash Receipts Register 
(CRReg). The certified copy of the CRReg together with the required supporting 
documents, duplicate copies of ORs and Deposit Slip (DSs) shall be submitted 
within five days after the end of each month to the concerned mother unit 
(central/regional/division office) by the FOs (a unit under the central/regional/ 
division office) for review and recording of the transactions in the CRJ by the 
Chief Accountant. 
 
Review of the financial statements revealed that balance of the Cash-Collecting 

Officer accounts amounting to ₱247,922.32 is unreliable due to the failure of the 
Accounting Unit and the respective Accountable Officers (AOs) to reconcile their records 
at year end which leaves an unreconciled balance as follows:

Total Unreconciled Balance (d+g) 175,108.53 
 
The AO and the Accountant shall reconcile their books of accounts at least

Cash – Collecting Officers as of December 31, 2020 is ₱175,108.53.  Inquiry revealed 
that AOs submit their reports along with the duplicate copies of the Official Receipts 
(ORs) and Deposit Slips (DSs) to the Accounting Units monthly, within five days after 
the end of the preceding month.  However, review of the ledgers revealed that the 
Accounting Unit does not exercise prudence in recording collections and deposits as 
there are times that collections and deposits are not completely and regularly recorded.  
Deposits are recorded on a per transaction basis, while, collections are recorded on a 
monthly and/or on a per transaction basis.  This resulted to the above unreconciled 
balances.  Inquiry further revealed that no regular reconciliation of records is being done 
by the Accounting Unit and the AOs.  These misstatements, if left uncorrected, will be 
carried to future periods and thus, mislead users of the statements.  

  
Moreover, it must be noted that non-reconciliation between the Accounting 

records and records of the AOs consistently hinders the timely completion of the Cash 
Examination Reports (CER) during cash examinations. In fact, the CER for the cash 
examination conducted to the AO of Glan Campus last June 2019 was not yet finalized as 
of this writing due to this non-reconciliation.  

 
 Section 42 of the same accounting manual prescribes the Submission of the 
Quarterly Report of Revenue and Other Receipts. The Chief Accountant shall prepare the 
Quarterly Report of Revenue and Other Receipts (QRROR) and submit the report to the 
GAS, COA, the DBM and the BTr within 30 days after the end of each quarter.  A 
separate report shall be prepared and submitted for income of the GF and for income and 
receipts for Special Account and Trust Fund.  Inconsistent thereto, Accounting Unit 
failed to submit to the office of the Auditor the Quarterly Report of Revenue and Other 
Receipts which precludes the Auditor from the timely verification of amounts reported. 
 
 The Management commented that the discrepancies are a combination in 
forwarded balance and unposted adjustments for credit/debit memos.  It was signified 
that the parties involved will continue to improve communication along this line to fix 
existing errors and minimize/prevent future ones.  The audit recommendation was 
accepted. 
 
 
Recommendation: 
 
 We recommended and the Management agreed to direct the Accounting Unit 
and the respective AOs to reconcile their records at least quarterly, trace the 
unreconciled balance as of year-end to ensure that the balance thereof is reconciled 



 

65 

 

with the records of the AOs, and exercise prudence in the recording of the 
collections and deposits. 
 
Non-restoration of unreleased Commercial Checks – ₱1,479,995.05 
 
 A Schedule of Unreleased Commercial Checks shall be prepared by the Cashier 
for submission to the Accounting Division/Unit. All unreleased checks at the end of the 
year shall be reverted back to the cash accounts. A JEV shall be prepared to recognize the 
restoration of the cash equivalent to the unreleased checks and the recognition of the 
appropriate liability/payable account. The accounting entry for the restoration of the 
unreleased check to the cash account shall be a debit to “Cash in Bank, Local Currency 
Current” account with credit to the appropriate liability account. There shall be no 
physical cancellation of the checks. The JEV supporting such restoration shall form part 
of the supporting document to the financial statements to be submitted to COA at year 
end.22 
 
 The University submitted the List of Unreleased Checks as at December 31, 2020 
showing the balances as follows: 
 
 Table 2 – Balances of Unreleased Checks as at December 31, 2020 (per Fund) 

Fund Amount 
Tuition Fund (164)                   ₱1,035,855.25 
Trust Fund (161)                         444,139.80 
Total ₱1,479,995.05* 

         *Details attached as Annex “A” 
 
 Review of the accounting records and the corresponding JEVs revealed that there 
were no entries made to revert back/restore the unreleased checks to the Cash accounts 
contrary to the above cited provision, thus understating the cash account and the 
appropriate liability accounts by ₱1,479,995.05. 
 
 When asked, University Cashier admitted that she was not able to furnish the 
Accounting Unit with the said list as she was not aware of such requirements.  
 
 The Accounting Unit takes cognizance of the provisions under Section 56, 
Chapter 9 of GAM for NGAs (Volume I) and agreed to comply with the 
recommendations.

66 

 

Recommendation: 
 
 We recommended and the Management agreed to require the Accounting 
Unit to draw accounting entry to revert back/restore the unreleased checks and to 
strictly adhere strictly with the rules and regulations on recording of transactions 
set forth in the GAM for NGAs to ensure that financial statements are presented 
fairly and free of material errors or misstatements.  
  
Non-preparation of Bank Reconciliation Statements – ₱2,737,810.85 
 
 At the close of each month, depositories shall report to the agency head, in such 
form as he may direct, the condition of the agency account standing on their books.  The 
head of the agency shall see to it that a reconciliation is made between the balance shown 
in the reports and the balance found in the books of the agency.23 
  
 The Bank Reconciliation Statement (BRS) shall be prepared in order to: a. check 
correctness of both the bank’s and agency’s/entity’s records, b. serve as a deterrent to 
fraud, and c. enable the agency/entity or bank to take up charges or credits recognized by 
the bank or agency/entity but not yet known to the agency/entity or bank.24  The monthly 
BRS shall be prepared by the Chief Accountant/designated staff for each of the bank 
accounts maintained by the agency/entity using the Adjusted Balance Method.25 
(emphasis ours) 
 
 The Monthly Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS) for bank account maintained 
by the University at Landbank of the Philippines (LBP) – Lebak Branch were not 
regularly prepared and submitted to the Office of the Auditor as required under Section 
74 of PD 1445 and Chapter 21 of the GAM for NGAs, thus correctness and accuracy of 
the balance of Cash in Bank – Local Currency – Landbank Lebak amounting to 
₱2,737,810.85 cannot be ascertained. As of this writing, the latest BRS submitted to this 
office is for the month of June 2020.  
 
 Further, non-submission of the monthly BRS negates the timely completion of the 
CERs conducted on the Accountable Officers. 
  
 The Management argued that the delay in the submission of BRS stems from the 
delay of AGDB in issuing bank statements. It was manifested that a written request for

the physical copies of bank statements will be forwarded to the servicing bank and that a 
request for granting online viewing access of account will be made with the hope that it 
will facilitate the needed monthly reconciliation  
  
Recommendation: 
 

We recommended and the Management agreed to require the Accountant to 
prepare immediately the BRS for bank account maintained at LBP-Lebak Branch 
and to strictly adhere to the provisions under Section 74 of PD 1445 and Chapter 21 
of the GAM for NGAs to ensure timely verification and reconciliation of the cash in 
bank balances per books and per bank.

It was observed that the transaction occurred in 2018 however, the Accountant 

failed to close this account to the Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) as of December 31, 
2020, which overstated the asset account and the equity account by the same amount.

 The observations were well taken and the necessary adjustment has been drawn in 
2021 in compliance with the recommendation. 
 
Recommendation: 
 

We recommended and the Management agreed to require the Accountant to 
draw accounting entry to close the Cash – Treasury/Agency Deposit, Regular 
Account to Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) Accounts and to be mindful in the use of 
accounts and in the drawing of necessary entries to bring the accounts into its 
correct balance.  
 
Inventory – ₱3,487,437.87 
 
 The accounts of an agency shall be kept in such details as is necessary to meet the 
needs of the agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish the information needed 
by fiscal or control agencies of the government.  The highest standards of honesty, 
objectivity and consistency shall be observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard 
against inaccurate or misleading information.27 
 

The weighted average method shall be used for costing inventories.  This method 
calls for the re-calculation of the average cost of all items in stock after every purchase. 
The Accounting Division/Unit shall be responsible in computing the cost of inventory on 
a regular basis.28  Supplies and materials purchased for inventory purpose shall be 
recorded using the perpetual inventory system, resulting in a more accurate inventory 
records and a running total for the cost of goods sold in each period.  The system requires 
accounting records to show the amount of inventory on hand at all times through the 
maintenance of the SLC by the Accounting Division/Unit and Stock Card by the Supply 
and/or Property Division/Unit for each item in stock.29 

 
Physical count/inventory, which is required semi-annually, is an indispensable 

procedure for checking the integrity of property custodianship.30 
 
Report of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI) – shall be prepared by the 

Property and/or Supply Custodian based on the RIS and shall be used by the Accounting 
Division/Unit as basis in preparing the JEV to record the supplies and materials issued.

Report on the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) – shall be used to report the 

physical count of supplies by type of inventory as at a given date.  It shows the balance of 
inventory items per card and per count and shortage/overage, if any.  These include the 
semi-expendable property wherein the issue is covered by ICS. 

 
Management attested in its notes to financial statements that it follows the 

Perpetual Inventory System and that the cost of ending inventories are computed using 
the Moving Average Method in pursuance with the GAM for NGAs.  However, 
interview revealed that contrary to this provision, the accounting unit records costs of 
inventories using the specific identification.  Perpetual inventory system of accounting is 
not religiously employed by the University as there were no Supplies Ledger Card (SLC) 
and Stock Card (SC) maintained by the Accounting and Supply Office, respectively. 
Thus, accuracy of the recorded inventory cannot be ascertained.  

 
The RSMI is not regularly and consistently prepared by the Supply Office, thus, 

supplies and materials used for the period were not regularly booked by the Accounting 
Unit. Interview revealed that the RSMIs were actually prepared on a regular basis and 
submitted to the Accounting Unit quarterly.  However, the personnel assigned in the 
preparation and submission of the RSMI resigned, thus preparation thereof was 
transferred to the existing personnel who is also overloaded with tasks in the Property 
and Supply Office.  Thus, accordingly, only the annual RSMI was prepared.  This Audit 
Team casted doubt in the accuracy of the report as there are inconsistencies in the 
statement of the personnel in the Supply Office and the Accountant.  The Accountant 
contented that he draw adjustment from the semi-annual RSMI prepared by the Supply 
Office, while the Supply Office manifested that only one RSMI was prepared by them for 
the whole year 2020.  

 
Further, reliability and accuracy of the RSMI is doubtful, since no SLCs were 

prepared by the Accounting Unit to check the correctness of the data indicated in the 
RSMI.  The Accounting Unit only relies on the data coming from the Supply Office, 
without them checking the correctness of the data therein. 

 
Nevertheless, analysis of the general ledgers disclosed that adjustments made by 

the Accounting Unit do not tally with the records in the RSMI.  The amount of supplies 
and materials issued per RSMI for CY 2020 is ₱15,761,228.08, while the recorded 
adjustments in the books is ₱12,273,790.21, thus, leaving an unaccounted difference 
amounting to ₱3,487,437.87.

 The Accounting Office contended that the total adjustments for CY 2020 was 
₱15,250,454.00 leaving a variance of ₱510,774.08 which was claimed to be caused likely 
by inventories under fund 161 which form part of the RSMI but recorded by the 
Accounting as part of reduction against Due to NGA liability account when purchased. 
Further, it was manifested that the specific identification method in accounting for 
inventory is more practicable for the University.  The University invokes the departure 
clause of IPSAS 1.  It was further argued that the determination of the most appropriate 
costing method(s) is left to the wisdom of the management, provided that uniform 
application of such policies are observed in compliance with paragraph 34 of IPSAS 12. 
It was also assured that the management will still maintain the necessary SLCs under the 
perpetual system, albeit the adoption of the specific identification instead of the moving 
average method. 
 
Recommendation: 
 
 We recommended to Management to direct the Accounting Unit and the 
Property Supply Office to adhere strictly with the rules and procedures prescribed 
in the GAM for NGAs and reconcile their records to account for the difference 
amounting to ₱3,487,437.87

Accounts Receivables – ₱77,306,926.26 
 
 Business Income which includes school fees, affiliation fees, examination fees, 
etc. shall be recognized when fees are billed or if not practicable, when fees are 
collected.31 
 
 Free Higher Education in SUCs and LUCs – All Filipino students who are either 
currently enrolled at the time of the effectivity of this Act, or shall enrol at any time 
thereafter, in courses in pursuance of a bachelor’s degree, certificate degree, or any 
comparable undergraduate degree in any SUC and LUC shall be exempt from paying 
tuition and other school fees for units enrolled in.32 
 
 All SUCs, LUCs and state-run TVIs shall submit to the CHED and the TESDA, 
respectively, within five days after the last day of the late registration for each semester, a 
report detailing the names of students eligible for the free tuition and other school fees in 
their institutions.33  
  
 With the implementation of Republic Act No. 10931, all school fees covered by 
the program shall be billed to the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) as “Due 
from NGAs”.  However, review of the financial statements revealed that consolidated 
billing for Free Higher Education (HE) per Actual Enrolled Students in the Second 
Semester Term of AY 2019 – 2020 from different campuses in the total amount of 
₱77,306,926.26 were recorded as “Accounts Receivables”. 
 
 During interview, the Accountant admitted that the amount recorded as Accounts 
Receivable is actually pertaining fees of the undergraduate students which are supposedly 
to be billed to both the CHED and to the individual student.  Further discussion revealed 
that this amount does not include fees which were billed to post-graduate student, which 
would have been correctly recorded as Accounts Receivables.  Admittedly, the 
Accountant manifested that they intentionally recorded this amount as Accounts 
Receivables to bring the account into normal balance.  Additionally, it was disclosed that 
the system used by the University is not capable of determining the accounts to be 
charged to the CHED from that of the accounts which should be charged to individual 
students.

 The Accountant committed to identify the accounts pertaining to those to be 
charged to the CHED and accounts of individual students.  Also, the accounts for the 
post-graduate students shall be acco unted and be recorded in the appropriate account. 
This audit team also observed that receivable accounts were only recognized at the close 
of the year contrary to the provision of the GAM that receivables shall be recognized 
when fees are billed or if not practicable, if fees are collected.  In the case of the 
University, the billing and recording should have been done upon completion of the 
enrolment process and not during the close of the year. 
 
 The management justified that the Accounting Unit has difficulty in recognizing 
the correct figures as it is a challenge to segregate the billing and collection summary by 
academic program as the UMIS, which is under development, is not yet capable of 
generating such information.  Nevertheless, the Accounting Office resorted to manual 
computation and necessary accounting entries have been made. 
 
 
Recommendation: 
 

We recommended and the Management agreed to require the Accountant to 
determine the fees to be collected from CHED and from students to determine 
which of the amount recorded should be correctly recorded as Accounts Receivable 
and which shall be recorded as Due from NGA- CHED account, and draw necessary 
accounting entry to correct the misstatement, if possible.  Also, strictly adhere to the 
provisions RA No. 10931 and the GAM for NGAs to ensure that financial 
statements are presented fairly free of material errors or misstatements.

5. Lapses in recording and monitoring of liabilities resulted in erroneous reporting 

and in failure to prepare, maintain and submit supporting schedules, thus, 
reliability and correctness of the University’s obligations could not be 
ascertained and information about the University’s liabilities were not made 
readily available for use in decision-making, prompt audit and early detection 
and correction of errors. 

 
 In the audit of liabilities, the auditor shall seek to establish that all obligations of 
the agency have been accurately recorded; only bonafide obligations of the agency have 
been included; the obligations incurred are properly authorized; all provisions of trust 
indentures or mortgages are complied with; and mortgages and other encumbrances are 
fully disclosed.34 
 
 In our financial audit of the University’s liabilities, accuracy, validity, existence 
and over-all reliability of liabilities and equity account could not be ascertained due to: 
 

a. Failure to prepare, maintain and submit supporting schedules of liabilities 
rendering the reliability of payables amounting to ₱188,833,826.27 uncertain. 

 
Whenever deemed necessary in the exigencies of the service, the Commission 

may under regulations issued by it require the agency heads, chief accountants, budget 
officers, cashiers, disbursing officers, administrative or personnel officers, and other 
responsible officials of the various agencies to submit trial balances, physical inventory 
reports, current plantilla of personnel, and such other reports as may be necessary for the 
exercise of its functions.35  

 
 In a letter dated March 25, 2021, the audit team requested various schedules of the 
University’s liability accounts but to no avail. 

 The absence of readily available schedules providing important details of its 
payables is a manifestation of weakness in monitoring of the University’s payables. 

  Further, it renders the reliability of the liabilities shown in the financial 
statement amounting to ₱188,833,826.27 doubtful as their validity, accuracy and 
existence could not be ascertained. 

                                                           
34 Section 59, P.D 1445 
35 Section 122 of P.D 1445 



 

74 

 

Furthermore, the non-submission of supporting schedules precluded the prompt 
audit of accounts and financial transactions, early detection and correction of 
errors/deficiencies and timely reporting of the audit results to the management contrary to 
Section 122 of P.D 1445. 

 The management expressed that the failure to maintain schedules stems mainly 
from the nature of the forwarded balances being accumulated and not easily identifiable 
to disaggregation. However, it was manifested that the Accounting Office will rebuild 
data regarding its Payables. The observations were duly noted and well taken and 
management agreed to comply with the recommendations. 

 

Recommendation: 

We recommended and the management agreed to instruct the accountant to 
prepare, maintain and submit supporting schedules.  Ensure also that the schedules 
are maintained and updated on a regular basis so that information needed would be 
readily available.  
 

b.  Erroneous recording and classification of liability accounts 
  
 Volume III of GAM for NGAs provides the descriptions of the following 
accounts:  
 

Accounts Payable (20101020). This account is used to recognize receipt of goods 
or services on account in the normal course of trade and business operation.  
Debit this account for payment or settlement of liabilities. 

 
Due to Officers and Employees (20101020). This account is used to recognize 
incurrence of liability to officers and employees for salaries, benefits and other 
emoluments including authorized expenses advanced by the officers and 
employees.  Debit this account for settlement or payment to officers and 
employees. 

 
Awards and Rewards Payable (20101080). This account is used to recognize 
granting of awards in recognition of any civic or professional achievement and of 
rewards to informers for the receipt of reliable information leading to successful 
arrest/capture of fugitives, seizure/confiscation of smuggled goods, or 
collection/recovery of unpaid taxes/surcharges/fines/penalties.  Debit this account 
for payment to the grantee of the award/reward. 



 

75 

 

 
Tax Refunds Payable (20103010). This account is used to recognize amount 
refundable to taxpayers for excess amount paid/withheld.  Debit this account upon 
payment or return of the tax refunds to the taxpayers. 

 
 In the examination of ledger, the following misclassifications were discovered: 
 

1. Inappropriate recording to Accounts Payable of the following: 
  

Particulars Amount 
CNA for 2020 4,374,131.32 
Salaries, Honoraria and Other Professional 
Services 

3,245,584.14 
 

Travelling Expenses 163,521.00

officers and employees 

1,297,360.26 
 

Cash Award for PRAISE-ACME awardee 70,000.00 
Total 9,150,596.72 

   
 Based on the descriptions provided under Volume III of GAM, it is more apposite 
that the above enumerated obligations be credited to Due to Officers and Employees and 
Awards and Rewards Payable. 
  

2. Payment charged against accounts payable without a previously set-up 
obligation amounting to ₱15,855.00.  

 
3. Inappropriate recording to Due to Officers and employees of the over 

withholding of income tax from 2020 compensation amounting to 
₱989,123,17.  Considering the nature of the obligation arising thereat, Tax 
Refunds Payable is the more appropriate account to be used.  Further, the 
beginning balance of ₱521,497.28 in 2012 with unknown nature and 
breakdown, remained unaccounted.  
 

4. Abnormal/Negative ledger balance of:

Total (7,777,871.59) 

  
 Review of the entries made showed that the negative balances were either a result 
of improper accounting of liabilities and charges against it, unaccounted beginning 
balances and/or overspending (in case of Inter-agency fund transfers).  This observation 
was included in our prior year findings and is hereby reiterated. 
 
 The improper accounting of payables reduces the accuracy of the reported 
liabilities in the financial statements.  Further, the lack of details affects the fair 
presentation of the University’s financial statements. 
 

The audit recommendations were duly noted and well taken.  JEVs for correcting 
misclassified accounts payable in 2021 were already submitted.  For accounts with 
abnormal balances, the management committed to conduct verifications and make 
necessary adjustments in 2021 with the hopes that the balances in its 2021 ledger will no 
longer have negative balances. 
 
Recommendation: 
 

We recommended and the management agreed to require the accountant to 
conduct thorough review and analysis of all outstanding payables, record adjusting 



 

77 

 

entries to reclassify to their proper accounts all misclassified accounts and bring the 
accounts with abnormal balances to its correct balance and require regular review 
and monitoring of all booked obligations to ensure that only valid claims remain in 
the books.  Exert effort to produce documents to support the booked obligations and 
provide details of booked obligations with undetermined nature and breakdown of 
accounts

Recommendations: 
 

14) Reconcile the accounts 
“Cash, LCCA-AREC” 
account and the “Due 
to NGA-AREC” 
account.  Submit the 
reconciliation to this 
office and the 
Terminal Financial 
Report of the project.  
Once reconciled and 
finalized, cause the 
reversion of any 
unused balance;

the identified dormant 
account following the 
procedural guidelines 
set forth under COA 
Circular 2015-001 

 Due to NGA-AREC 
ledgers. The 
transactions will be 
traced, matched, and 
analyzed.

thereof and observed strict

remittance of taxes 
withheld to avoid 
over/under/delayed 
remittances;

Accountant to: 

 
a) To draw the 

necessary adjusting 
journal entries to 
properly reflect the 
amount of inventory 
on hand and reclassify 
accounts which were 
inappropriately 
recorded to ensure fair 
and reliable 
presentation of

b) To adhere to the rules

which were identified

otherwise effect necessary

17. The correctness and 
reliability of the accounts 
and records as at 
December 31, 2015 of the 
University’s various 
Income-Generating 
Projects (IGPs), including 
but not limited to income 
arising from dormitory 
fees, school bus fees, 
concessionaires and/or 
space leases, cafeteria, 
hotel fees and the like, 
could not be relied upon 
due to inconsistencies 
uncovered in the recording 
and that the basis upon 
which income accrued and 
generated therefrom were 
recorded was the cash 
basis method, thereby 
failing to account and 
establish the would be 
receipts prior to the 
supposed collection 
therefrom contrary to 
Volume I, Section 4a, 
Chapter 2 of the MNGAS 
and as restated in Sections 
60 to 62 thereof.
