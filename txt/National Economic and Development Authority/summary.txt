EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  
  

  

A. Introduction  
  

The National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) is a cabinet-level 

agency mandated by the Philippine Constitution to serve as the independent socio-

economic planning and policy coordinating body of the government.  It was 

established through Presidential Decree No. 1 in 1972 and was reorganized in July 22, 

1987 by virtue of Executive Order No. 230 to enhance its ability to coordinate the 

development planning and policy formulation process.   

  

The NEDA consists of the NEDA Board and the NEDA Secretariat.  The NEDA 

Board is the governing body that sets major development policy directions for the 

Philippines while the NEDA Secretariat serves as its research and technical support 

arm.   

 

The Regional Development Council, established by virtue of Letter of Instruction No. 

22 issued on December 31, 1972, is every region’s highest policy-making body 

serving as the counterpart of the NEDA Board at the sub-national level. It coordinates 

and directs all regional socioeconomic development efforts, serving as a forum for 

local efforts to be related and integrated with national development activities. 

  

The NEDA Board is composed of the President as Chairperson, the Socioeconomic 

Planning Secretary as Vice Chairperson, and designated department secretaries as 

members such as from the Office of the President, Department of the Budget and 

Management,  Department of Energy, Department of Finance, Department of Human 

Settlements and Urban Development, Department of Public Works and Highways, 

Department of Trade and Industry, Department of Transportation, Mindanao 

Development Authority and Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas. 

 

Assisting the NEDA Board are seven cabinet-level inter-agency committees namely, 

the Development Budget Coordination Committee, Infrastructure Committee, 

Investment Coordination Committee, Social Development Committee, Committee on 

Tariff and Related Matters, Regional Development Committee and National Land Use 

Committee.  

 

The NEDA Secretariat, headed by the Socioeconomic Planning Secretary, is regarded 

as the authority in macroeconomic forecasting, and policy analysis and research.  It 

provides high-level policy advice to the Executive and Legislative branches of 

government.  As of December 31, 2020, the NEDA had total plantilla positions of 

1,381, of which 1,139 were filled up, and had 147 Job Order workers.

B. Scope and Objectives  
   

The audit covered the financial accounts and operations of the NEDA for the year ended 

December 31, 2020. The audit was conducted to: (a) verify the level of assurance that 

may be placed on Management’s assertions on the financial statements (FSs); (b) 

determine the propriety of transactions, as well as the extent of compliance with 

pertinent laws, rules and regulations; (c) recommend agency’s improvement 

opportunities; and (d) determine the extent of implementation of prior years’ audit 

recommendations.  

  

  

C. Audit Methodology  
  

We adopted a risk-based audit approach in the audit of the FSs of NEDA and in the 

review of compliance with laws, rules and regulations.  The Audit Team which carried 

out the audit, among others, (i) examined financial and accounting procedures adopted 

by NEDA and other relevant documentation; (ii) assessed internal controls regulating 

financial operations  and carried out compliance testing for determining the extent of 

control in operation; (iii)  conducted substantive testing of a representative sample of 

selected transactions;  (iv) carried out review, on test check basis, of a number of 

contracts and transactions related to movements in balances of assets, liabilities, 



iii 

 

revenues and expenses; and (v) conducted interviews and held discussions with the 

concerned officials and staff  in the NEDA Central  Office (NCO) and NEDA Regional 

Offices (NROs).   

  

The results of the audit were communicated to the Head of the Agency and the 

concerned officials through the issuance of Audit Observation Memoranda (AOMs).  

  

  

D. Independent Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements   
  

We rendered an unmodified opinion on the fairness of the presentation of NEDA’s 

consolidated FSs as at December 31, 2020.   

  

  

E. Summary of Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations  
  

Among the audit observations and corresponding recommendations discussed in Part 

II of this report, the significant observations are summarized as follows:  

  

1. Various accounting errors and omissions in the keeping of accounts resulted in the 
misstatement of affected accounts reported in the FSs. 

 

We reiterated our recommendations and Management agreed to direct the 

Chief Accountants of the NCO and respective NROs to: (a) prepare journal 

entries to recognize the unrecorded assets and correct the misclassification and 

other errors/discrepancies noted, to reflect the adjusted balances of the 

affected accounts in the books of accounts; and, (b) henceforth, observe the 

proper recording of accounts and transactions in accordance with the 

Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies 

(NGAs) and other existing accounting rules and regulations. 
 

2. Various accounting deficiencies that were noted in the recording and reporting of 
financial transactions amounting to P78.479 million had undermined the qualitative 

characteristics of information in the FSs.

delivered  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Supply Officer, 

NCO, to furnish the Accounting Division not only the Report of Supplies 

and Materials Issued to record the Office Supplies Expenses and Other 

Supplies and Materials Expenses upon issuance, but also a copy of Delivery 

Receipts of the items delivered for the recording of the items under Office 

Supplies Inventory and Other Supplies and Materials Inventory to come up 

with the correct balance of the inventory and expense accounts. 

   

c. Undisposed unserviceable properties  
 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Property Officers 

concerned to: (a) expedite the disposal of unserviceable Property, Plant and 

Equipment (PPEs) to prevent further deterioration and decrease in value; 

and, (b) NRO I to include in the Inventory and Inspection Report of 

Unserviceable Property all unserviceable properties including semi-

expendable assets in compliance with Sections 40(d) and 42(h), Chapter 10, 

Volume I of the GAM for NGAs. 

 

d. Discrepancies in PPE balances between General Ledger and Report on the 
Physical Count of PPE (RPCPPE)

Management Division and the Accounting Division of NCO and NRO VIII 

to analyze and reconcile the discrepancies/ differences between the books 

and RPCPPE and effect the necessary adjustments; (b) conduct 

investigation on the missing/unaccounted PPE of NCO which have been in 

the books for several years. However, if these missing PPEs are without 

available records of accountability it shall be derecognized from the books 

of accounts in accordance with Section 8 of COA Circular 2020-006 dated 

January 31, 2020 for the proper disposition for missing/unaccounted PPE;  

(c)  NRO IV-A to exert effort to locate pertinent documents that would give 

the details, such as description, acquisition dates and cost of the 

unrecognized 21 PPE items, for proper recording in the Accounting and 

Property records and reports;  (d) NRO XII to update Property Cards, PPE 

Ledger Cards and Property Acknowledgement Receipts for easy 

reconciliation of the accounts;  (e)  NRO IV-B to conduct physical inventory, 



v 

 

prepare and submit the RPCPPE to Accounting Division, pursuant to 

Section 38, Chapter 10, Volume 1 of the GAM for NGAs, for reconciliation

assign and tag PPE without numbers for easy identification and locating the 

properties in accordance with Section 6.2.5 COA Circular No. 2020-006. 

 

e. Abnormal negative balances of Inter-Agency Payables

procurement exceeded the 25 per cent ceiling required to be procured under Item 5 

(a-ii) of Annex A of Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB) Resolution 

No. 18-2007 dated May 31, 2007; and (d) non-posting of procurement activity in 

the Philippine Government Electronic Procurement System (PhilGEPS), agency’s
