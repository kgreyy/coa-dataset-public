OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

 

Financial Audit 

 
Accounting Errors and Omissions 

 

1. Various accounting errors and omissions in the keeping of accounts resulted in 
the misstatement of affected accounts reported in the Financial Statements (FSs). 

 

The International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSASs) as well as 

Section 7, Chapter 19, Volume I, Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for 

National Government Agencies (NGAs), provides that FSs shall present fairly the 

financial position, financial performance and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation 

requires the faithful presentation of the effects of transactions, other events and 

conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, 

liabilities, income and expenses set out in the IPSASs.  The application of IPSASs, 

with additional disclosure, when necessary, is presumed to result in FSs that achieve a 

fair presentation. 

 

Sections 111 and 112, Chapter 2, Title III of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 

1445, require, among others, each government agency to record its financial 

transactions and operations conformably with generally accepted accounting 

principles and in accordance with pertinent laws and regulations. 

 

                   Analysis and examination of the accounts and transactions of the NEDA 

Central Office (NCO) and Regional Offices (NROs) disclosed various errors and 

omissions that misstated the fair presentation of the year-end balance of assets, 

liabilities and net assets/equity, as summarized in Table 1.

We reiterated our recommendations and Management agreed to direct the 

Chief Accountants of the NCO and respective NROs to: (a) prepare journal 

entries to recognize the unrecorded assets and correct the misclassification and 

other errors/discrepancies noted, to reflect the adjusted balances of the affected 

accounts in the books of accounts; and, (b)  henceforth, observe the proper 

recording of accounts and transactions in accordance with the GAM for NGAs 

and other existing accounting rules and regulations. 
 

 

Accounting Deficiencies  
 

2. Various accounting deficiencies that were noted in the recording and reporting 
of financial transactions amounting to P79.979 million had undermined the 

qualitative characteristics of information in the FSs.  
 

       Examination of the accounting records revealed several accounting 

deficiencies that have an impact on the fair presentation of the year-end consolidated 

assets, liabilities, and net assets/equity, thus affecting the accounts in the FSs with an 

aggregate amount of P79.979 million.  The details are summarized in Table 2.

COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016 defines dormant 

receivable accounts as those which balances remained inactive or non-moving in 

the books of accounts for 10 years or more and where settlement/collectability 

could no longer be ascertained.  Item 8 of the same COA Circular provides the 

procedures in the write-off of dormant accounts. 

 

Verification of the subsidiary ledgers (SLs) of the NCO and NRO III 

revealed that there were still unliquidated and dormant receivable accounts with 

amounts of P33.083 million and P87,835.27, respectively. Likewise, in the books 

of NROs II and VIII, unsettled disallowances that remained outstanding for more 

than five years as at December 31, 2020 amounted to P208,706.35 and P1.450 

million, respectively.  Moreover, there was no recognition of Impairment Loss on 

uncollected receivables, thus affecting the validity and reliability of receivable 

account.  

 

The details of these dormant, unliquidated and unsettled accounts are 

summarized in Table 3.

warrant the write-off of these 

accounts, subject to the 

guidelines and procedures 

provided in COA Circular No. 

2016-005 dated December 19, 

2016. These deficiencies had 

been observed for many years 

and continuously 

unimplemented.  It was also 

noted that impairment loss has 

not been recognized on these 

dormant receivables, thus 

overstating the reported 

balances of the accounts in the

The amount pertains to the 

balance as at December 31, 

2020 of COA disallowances of 

P210,777.79 in CYs 1991 and 

1993 due to overpayment of 

lumber materials and 

overpricing per recanvass 

made by the Auditor. During 

CY 2020, Management was 

able to collect P2,070.74 from 

one of the persons liable, 

leaving an unsettled COA 

disallowances of P208,706.35 

as at year-end. NEDA 

management admitted that the 

settlement of the said 

disallowance could hardly be 

done since some of the persons 

liable were employees of 

Department of Public Works 

and Highways (DPWH) who 

were involved in the 

construction of the Regional 

Development Council (RDC) 

building. Further, the DPWH 

RO II in its letter dated 

September 24, 2019, informed 

NEDA that the persons liable 

were already dead and there 

was no information as to their 

last known addresses.

than five years due to the 

absence of SLs.  

  

We reiterated our recommendations and Management agreed to 

require the:  

 

a) Accounting Personnel of concerned offices to: (i) coordinate with 
the Implementing Agencies (IAs); and, (ii) gather and submit the 

necessary supporting documents and/or liquidation reports to the 

Accounting Division;    

 

b) Accountants of NCO, and NRO II to: (i) reconcile the submitted 
documents with  the NEDA records; and, (ii)  prepare the 

necessary adjusting entries, accordingly;   

 

c) Accountant of NRO III to: (i) exert effort to collect the amount of 
P82,425.02 from the retired Property/Supply Officer,  otherwise,  

require those who signed the clearance to pay the amount due 

from the former Property/Supply Officer; and,  (ii) henceforth, 

enforce sound control measures in the issuance of clearance to 

persons with outstanding accountabilities; and 

 

d) Accountant of NRO VIII to establish the complete records of the 
receivables and immediately initiate action to enforce settlement 

of disallowances/charges in accordance with the COA Revised 

Rules of Procedures on the Settlement of Accounts.

b. Unreconciled balance with PS  
 

The NRO V procures its common-use supplies, materials, and equipment 

from the PS in line with the national policy that procurement of supplies and 

materials by government agencies shall be through the PS. The funds needed are 

paid in advance to the PS and recognized in the books as debit to Due from 

National Government Agencies. The equivalent amount of any deliveries of 

supplies and materials is credited to the same account.  
 

Confirmation made with the PS of the balance of the account as at 

December 31, 2020 disclosed variance between the book balances of NRO V and 

PS in the amount of P37,592.36, as presented in Table 4:

            Total  127,394.06 89,801.60 37,592.36 

 

Based on various Agency Procurement Requests, the difference is 

composed of supplies and materials that have remained undelivered.  The balance 

of both the Accounting and Property Sections are reconciled. However, 

comparison of this balance with PS’s records showed a variance of P37,592.36, 

thus making the account unreliable.  The Management was amenable to the audit 

recommendation. The Property Officer will coordinate with the PS for the 

reconciliation of the records.  
 

 We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the 

Accountant to closely coordinate with the PS to reconcile their records of the 

account balances to eliminate the discrepancy of P37,592.36. 

 

c. Outright recognition of expense instead of inventory account for supplies 
delivered   

              
Comparative analysis of the GL balances of inventory accounts with the 

Report on Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) and Supplies Ledger Card (SLCs) 

showed that there were no balances of the Office Supplies and Other Supplies and 

Materials as at December 31, 2020. However, further analysis showed that the 

office supplies and other supplies and materials purchased from the PS for CY 

2020 in the amount of P1.055 million was recognized outright in the books as 

Office Supplies Expenses and Other Supplies and Materials Expenses upon 

delivery.  Interview with the Supply Officer disclosed that these deliveries were 

directly issued to the end-user within five days from delivery, since there are no 

spaces for stocking of these supplies.  Only the Report of Supplies and Materials 



 

57 

 

Issued (RSMI) was forwarded to the Accounting Division for the recording of 

expense. 

 

This practice resulted in non-recording of inventories, thus overstating the 

expense accounts and understating inventory accounts. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Supply 

Officer, NCO, to furnish the Accounting Division not only the RSMI to 

record the Office Supplies Expenses and Other Supplies and Materials 

Expenses upon issuance, but also a copy of Delivery Receipts of the items 

delivered for the recording of the items under Office Supplies Inventory and 

Other Supplies and Materials Inventory to come up with the correct balance 

of the inventory and expense accounts. 

   

d. Undisposed unserviceable properties  
     

The EO No. 309, series of 1996, provides the need to expedite the disposal 

of unserviceable equipment and property of the government to avoid further 

deterioration, especially those exposed to elements. Relative to this, Section 40(d), 

Chapter 10,  Volume I of the GAM for NGAs, requires that all unserviceable 

property be reported in the Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable 

Property (IIRUP) (Appendix 74). The PPE reported in the IIRUP shall be dropped 

from the books by debiting Impairment Loss-Property, Plant, and Equipment 

(cost of the PPE less Accumulated Depreciation). 

 

  Review of the PPE accounts disclosed that unserviceable properties of 

NCO, NRO I and NRO VIII costing P14.107 million and P1.166 million, and 

P5.859 million, respectively, or a total of P21.132 million, remained undisposed 

as at December 31, 2020. The undisposed PPE of NRO I includes semi-

expendable supplies amounting to P183,794.00, while unserviceable PPEs of 

P1.166 million were not reported in the prescribed IIRUP.   

 

 The non-disposal of unserviceable properties unnecessarily occupies 

space which could have been used for other purpose, and exposed the assets to 

further deterioration, while the ICT Equipment may pose hazardous elements.  

 

    The Management recognized the importance of adhering to the 

provisions of the Manual on Disposal of Government Properties and therefore, 

had instructed the concerned staff to undertake the disposal of the unserviceable 

properties and NRO I to finalize the preparation of IIRUP.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Property 

Officers concerned to: (a) expedite the disposal of unserviceable PPEs to 

prevent further deterioration and decrease in value; and, (b) NRO I to 

include in the IIRUP all unserviceable properties including semi-expendable 



 

58 

 

assets in compliance with Sections 40(d) and 42(h), Chapter 10, Volume I of 

the GAM for NGAs. 

 

e. Discrepancies in PPE balance s between  and RPCPPE 
 

Comparison of PPE balances per books and RPCPPE revealed that out of 

the 16 NEDA offices, only NCO has reported discrepancies of P1.362 million as 

at December 31, 2020. The variances comprised of unreconciled balances of 

Communication Equipment and Furniture and Fixtures with a total amount of 

P239,856.77, and PPE not included in the physical count, which are the Technical 

and Scientific Equipment and Watercrafts, in the total amount of P1.123 million.  

 

 The NCO Management commented that the current officers of the Asset 

Management Division (AMD) and Accounting Division have regularly conducted 

meetings to address the unreconciled accounts. In addition, the 

missing/unaccounted PPE valued at P1.123 million were booked in CY 1995. 

However, the existence of these assets was never confirmed during the conduct of 

physical count, hence, to be requested for relief from property accountability.  

 

In NRO IV-A, the total balances of PPE accounts were unreliable due to 

the non-recognition of 5 units of ICT Equipment and 16 Office Equipment in both 

the Accounting and Property records.  These properties were found during the 

physical inventory and were reflected in the RPCPPE with no amount indicated. 

 

 On the other hand, Property Cards (PCs), PPE Ledger Cards (PPELCs) 

and Property Acknowledgement Receipts (PARs) maintained by NRO XII were 

not updated.  In NRO IV-B, no RPCPPE was prepared as physical inventory of 

PPE was not conducted, hence, precluded the agency to conduct reconciliation 

with the PCs maintained by the Property Division for each item of PPE and also 

with the GL of the Accounting Division.   

 

Moreover, the NRO VIII’s unreconciled amounts of P0.586 million are 

non-accounted PPEs which are no longer found within the office premises, some 

of which were already included in the Request for Relief from Property 

Accountability.     

 

Moreover, it was noted during the physical inventory that there were PPE 

with no property numbers/stickers amounting to P193.832 million in NCO and 

P13.402 million in NRO XII, or a total of P207.233 million, which rendered it 

difficult to identify and locate the PPEs listed in the records of the Property and 

Accounting Divisions. 

 

We recommended and the Management agreed to: 

 

a) Require the AMD and the Accounting Division of NCO and NRO 
VIII to analyze and reconcile the discrepancies/ differences 



 

59 

 

between the books and RPCPPE and effect the necessary 

adjustments; 

 

b) Conduct investigation on the missing/unaccounted PPE of NCO 
which have been in the books for several years. However, if these 

missing PPEs are without available records of accountability it 

shall be derecognized from the books of accounts in accordance 

with Section 8 of COA Circular 2020-006 dated January 31, 2020 

for the proper disposition for missing/unaccounted PPE;   

 

c) NRO IV-A to exert effort to locate pertinent documents that 
would give the details, such as description, acquisition dates and 

cost of the unrecognized 21 PPE items, for proper recording in 

the Accounting and Property records and reports; 

 

d) NRO XII to update PCs, PPELCs and PARs for easy 
reconciliation of the accounts; 

 

e) NRO IV-B to conduct physical inventory, prepare and submit 
the RPCPPE to Accounting Division, pursuant to Section 38, 

Chapter 10, Volume 1 of the GAM for NGAs, for reconciliation 

of accounts; and 

 

f) Require the Property Officer of NCO and NRO XII to assign and 
tag PPE without numbers for easy identification and locating the 

properties in accordance with Section 6.2.5 COA Circular No. 

2020-006. 

 

f. Abnormal negative balances of Inter-Agency Payables 
 

Section 7, Chapter 19, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs provides that 

“Financial Statements shall present fairly the financial position, financial 

performance and cash flow of an entity.  Fair presentation requires the faithful 

presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other 

events, and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria 

for assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses set out in IPSASs. 

 

However, analysis of the account balance of the inter-agency payables 

showed the negative balances presented in Table 5 which is contrary to the above 

regulations.

adjustments in order to reflect the correct balances of the account/s.  

 

 

Compliance Issues 

 
Lapses in cash accountabilities and management control  

 

3. Various deficiencies in the management of cash exposed public funds to possible 
misuse, and non-indemnification in case of theft, robbery, and loss of government 

fund, among others.  
  

Analysis and examination of cash conducted on various Accountable Officers 

(AOs) revealed deficiencies in accounting and cash accountability controls contrary to 

accounting standards and other related prescribed rules and regulations, as presented 

in Table 6.

Unreliable balance of Inventory accounts

casting doubts on the inventory accounts in the FSs.  

 

                Chapter 8, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs, covers the definition, recognition, 

measurement, cost formulas to be used and related disclosure requirement in accordance 

with IPSAS 12 on Inventories.  It includes specific guidelines and procedures on 

acquisition, issue, disposal and impairment of inventory. 

 

              Volume II of the same Manual contains the Appendices prescribing the 

forms/templates that shall be used in the maintenance and handling of inventory such as 

the Supplies Ledger Card (SLC) (Appendix 57), Inventory Custodian Slip (ICS) 

(Appendix 59), Requisition and Issue Slip (RIS) (Appendix 63) and Waste Materials 

Report (WMR) (Appendix 65). 

 

On the other hand, Section 25 of the General Provisions of the General 

Appropriations Act (GAA) for fiscal year (FY) 2020 provides that the inventory of 

supplies, materials and equipment spare parts to be procured shall not exceed the 

agency’s two-month requirement. It further provides that the head of the agencies may 

increase their inventory of critical supplies, materials and equipment spare parts to be 

procured in any of the following instances: (i) in anticipation of cost increases; (ii) 

necessitated by national emergency; (iii) when there is an impending shortage; and (iv) 

when authorized by GAA or in the charter of the agency. 

               

Moreover, Section 7 of RA No. 9184 provides the preparation of Annual 

Procurement Plan (APP).   No government procurement shall be undertaken unless it 

is in accordance with the approved APP of the Procuring Entity. The APP shall be 

approved by the Head of the Procuring Entity and must be consistent with its duly 

approved yearly budget. It shall be formulated and revised only in accordance with the

Issuance of newly purchased semi-expendable items without 

ICS and non- maintenance of inventory reports 

 

The Property/Supply Officer of NRO XII issued semi-

expendable items without corresponding ICS issued, hence, 

accountability of such items were not established. 

Furthermore, ICSs for previously issued semi-expendable 

items was not signed by the end-users and the 2nd copy was 

not given to Property/Supply Officer, hence, accountability 

and acknowledgement of receipt were not established. In 

addition, the agency did not update the ICS and RIS.  On the 

other hand, SLCs of the Accounting Division and WMR of 

Property Division were not prepared as required under 

Letter A, Instruction of Appendix 57, 65, respectively, 

Volume II, GAM for NGAs. 

 

In NRO VIII, the Property Custodian prepared PCs instead 

of ICS for CY 2019 and prior years’ issuances.  The PCs are 

the records maintained by the Supply/Property Officer for 

deliveries of PPE rather than for the issued semi-expendable 

properties. Thus, end-users could not be made accountable 

for the issued semi-expendable items in case of loss since 

these properties were not duly acknowledged to them.

Item 6 (f) of GPPB 

Resolution No.  18-

2007 dated May 31, 

2007 

 

The abovementioned lapses in the procurement of goods and services of the 

agency may result to ineffective and poor performance of the NEDA Bids and Awards 

Committee, thus affecting the accountability, efficiency, transparency and propriety of 

the procurement process. 

 

We recommended Management to require the Directors of: 

 

a) NRO I to:  (i)  assess and collect the related liquidated damages against 
the Consulting Firm for non-completion of the work as specified in the 

Terms of Reference in order to be indemnified for any damage or 

defects incurred; (ii) Project Monitoring and Evaluation Division to 

monitor the implementation of the project so that the intended purpose 

for which the project was formulated will be achieved and to avoid 

wastage of government funds; and (iii) strictly adhere to the rules and 

regulations on the procurement of lease of venue as provided under 

Section 9 of Annex H of the 2016 RIRR of RA No. 9184; and

b) NRO VIII to: (i) strictly observe the provisions of the RIRR of RA No. 
9184 on the mode of procurement to be adopted in the procurement of 

consultancy services; (ii) henceforth, follow the provisions of Item 5 (a-

ii) of Annex A of GPPB Resolution No.  18-2007 dated May 31, 2007; 

and (iii) post the general information pertaining to the procurement 

activity conducted in the PhilGEPS, agency’s website, and any 

conspicuous place in the agency’s premises in adherence to Item 6 (f) 

of Annex A of the same GPPB Resolution.  

 

 

Deficiencies in Expenditures/Disbursements  

 

6. Deficiencies and non-compliance with prescribed rules and regulations 
pertaining to the payment of expenditures showing weakness in the disbursement 

of government funds, resulted in improper disbursement process.     

 

            Examination and inspection of documents related to various disbursements of 

the NEDA and its regions revealed various deficiencies in the payment of 

expenditures, as summarized in Table 9. 

 
Table 9 - Deficiencies in Expenditures/Disbursements 

Office Deficiencies Recommendations 

NROs V, 

VII and XIII 

Expenses paid thru reimbursement basis 

 

Disbursements amounting to P40,400.72, 

P212,804.82 and P233,625.25 of NROs V, 

VII and XIII, respectively, were paid through 

reimbursement basis instead of going through 

the regular/proper process of disbursement, 

contrary to Section 93 of PD No. 1445 and had 

been undertaken not in accordance with 

Section 10, Rule IV and XVI of the 2016 

RIRR of RA No. 9184, thereby showing 

control weakness in the disbursement of 

government funds 

 

Moreover, in the payment of expenses thru 

reimbursement, the agency may not obtain the 

best quality of goods and services at the lowest 

cost. Likewise, the NROs were not able to 

withhold the applicable taxes on the 

reimbursed purchases as required in Bureau of 

Internal Revenue (BIR) Revenue 

Memorandum Order No. 23-2014. 

 

 

 

Management agreed to discontinue 

the practice of procuring goods and 

services through reimbursement basis 

and instead adhere to the mode of 

procurement process in compliance 

with the procurement law and impose 

applicable taxes thereon.   

NRO I Improper payment of EME 

 

Of the total Extraordinary and Miscellaneous 

Expenses (EME) of P135,600.00 for the 

Office of the Regional Director,  the amount 

of P84,000.00 pertains to payment for cash 

assistance and incentive to the officials and  

 

 

The Management agreed to adhere to 

the provisions of Section 42 of RA 

No. 11465 or the GAA for FY 2020 

on the payment of EME and to 

provide the legal basis on the  



 

68 

 

Office Deficiencies Recommendations 

 employees and other personnel stationed at the 

Agency, in violation of Section 42 of the 

General Provisions of RA No. 11465 or the 

GAA for FY 2020,  thereby casting doubt on 

the legality and validity of the transaction. 

 

 

 

payment of the P84,000.00 made to 

the officials and employees, job 

order workers and security guards. 

Further, it was also recommended 

that henceforth, Management 

observe the GAA provisions on the 

utilization of EME. 

NRO XI Improper payment of RATA 

 

Disbursement pertaining to commutable 

Representation and Transportation Allowance 

(RATA) in the amount of P10,000.00 was 

paid to an employee who was designated as 

Officer-in-Charge (OIC) to the position, 

which is not allowed under Section 54 of the 

GAA for FY 2020.  

 

 

 

 

 

The Management agreed to stop the 

payment of commutable RATA to 

OICs to the position who are below 

Salary Grade 24, instead grant the 

reimbursable RATA with required 

supporting documents and direct the 

person concerned to refund the 

disallowed commutable RATA. 

 

NROs V and 

XII 

Payment of expenses through eMDS instead of 

LDDAP-ADA 

 

Payments amounting to P0.527 million and 

P4.988 million of NROs V and XII, 

respectively, were made to various 

creditors/payees through the issuance of 

Electronic Modified Disbursement System 

(eMDS) checks, instead of using the List of 

Due and Demandable Accounts Payables-

Advice to Debit Account (LDDAP-ADA) 

under the Modified Direct Payment Scheme 

(MDPS) as prescribed in DBM Circular Letter 

No. 2018-14, thus, hindering the attainment of 

a more transparent and efficient payment 

scheme. 

 

 

 

 

The Management agreed to ensure the 

full implementation of the 

MDPS/eMDS on the settlement of 

accounts to all internal and external 

creditors and payees. Likewise, NRO 

XII to encourage the creditors/payees 

to open LBP accounts to ensure the 

implementation of MDPS, as 

prescribed under DBM Circular Letter 

No. 2018-14. 

NRO V Payment of cash award to unauthorized 

person 

 

Release of checks for the “Grant of Cash 

Award” was made in the name of the 

employees of LGUs instead of awarding it to 

the Province of Sorsogon and City of Legazpi, 

which is not in consonance with sound 

practice. 

 

Moreover, no Official Receipts (ORs) were 

issued by the LGUs, contrary to the principle 

of sound internal control that OR must be 

issued for receipt of money. 
 

 

 

 

Management agreed to discontinue 

the practice of awarding the cash 

incentive directly to the employees 

and instead, prepare checks in the 

name of the LGUs in consonance with 

the existing rules and regulations.  

 

Also, OR must be issued by the 

winning LGU.

NRO VIII Payments made for food despite cancellation 

of meeting, and during virtual meeting  

 

Review of the transactions revealed that 

payment was still made to the supplier for the 

catering of food - snacks and lunch for 65 pax 

amounting to P24,040.00 for RDC VIII-

Emergency Executive Committee Meeting 

scheduled on March 20, 2020 despite its being 

cancelled per Notice of Cancellation issued by 

the Chairperson, RDC VIII, on March 19, 

2020 due to the pandemic. Moreover, the 

amount of P149,784.00 was spent for the 

payment of food catered during virtual 

meetings/conferences, resulting in irregular 

and unnecessary expenditures as stipulated in 

Section 3 and 4 of COA Circular No. 2012-

003.  

 

Management commented that it made effort to 

cancel the contract a day before the meeting 

and despite short notice, however, it can only 

cancel an amount of P14,050.00 out of the 

P38,090.00 as the supplier has already 

procured some of the food for the meeting. 

Management instead decided to distribute the 

food to front liners.   

 

On the other hand, as regards the food served 

during virtual meetings, Management 

explained that the meetings held were not 

done 100 per cent virtual as some participants 

were physically present during the meetings 

mentioned. According to one Division Chief, 

the meals of other participants were delivered 

to their respective offices within the 

government center and not in their respective 

homes. 

  

The Audit Team has maintained its stand that 

in the conduct of the virtual/via Zoom 

meetings, it is not expected that the 

participants should be physically present.  

Therefore, provision of meals and snacks 

would be unnecessary.  Moreover, under NRO 

VIII’s NEDA Awards and Incentive System 

(NAIS) Committee Resolution No 02, series 

of 2012, only the giving of plaque and 

conducting of program honoring the retiree 

were mentioned. It was not provident the said 

NAIS Resolution that foods/snacks were 

necessary and can be charged to the agency’s 

fund. 

 

 

 

Management to exercise and observe 

at all times prudence in the utilization 

and use of government funds to 

prevent incurrence of unneccesary and 

irregular expenditures. Further, 

prepare an official communication 

supported with all the necessary 

documents justifying the 

reasonableness of its course of action. 

Likewise, refrain from giving foods 

during virtual meetings.   

 



 

70 

 

   We enjoin Management to monitor compliance of NROs I, V, VII, VIII, 

XI, XII and XIII with the recommendations of the Audit Teams concerned to 

improve its disbursement process.   

 

 

Non-/delayed/incomplete submission of mandatory reports  

 

7. Non-/delayed/incomplete submission of various documents within the prescribed 
period opposed to several rules and regulations, precluded the timely and 

complete examination of related transactions for the purpose of ascertaining the 

validity and proper recording thereof in the books of accounts.  

 

Paragraph 6.06 of COA Circular No. 95-006 dated May 18, 1995 prescribes 

that the receipt and disbursement records with all paid vouchers and documents shall 

be submitted within 10 days from the date of receipt of said documents. Moreover, 

Section 7.2 of COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 16, 2009 provides that 

the financial records shall be made accessible at reasonable hours by the Chief 

Accountant to the Auditor or his authorized representatives when needed. 

 

Further, Section 3.1.1 of COA Circular 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009 

requires agencies or instrumentalities to furnish to the Auditor of the agency concerned 

a copy of the contract within five working days from the execution of the contract by 

the government or any of its subdivisions. Section 3.2.1 of the same Circular also 

provides that a copy of any purchase order irrespective of amount, and each and every 

supporting documents, shall, within five working days from issuance thereof, be 

submitted to the Auditor concerned. 

 

Likewise, COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 was issued to 

prescribe the revised guidelines and documentary requirements for common 

government transactions. 

 

  Inspection and verification of the financial and accountability reports showed 

that in NCO and NROs CAR, I, II, III, IV-A, V, VII, IX, XI, XII and XIII, there were 

either delays in submission or non-submission of documents such as DVs, Bank 

Reconciliation Statements (BRSs), contracts/Purchase Orders (POs)/Job Orders (JOs) 

, among others, or incomplete documentation on various expense transactions. The 

details are shown in Table 10.

CAR 

No submitted BRS, Contracts and DVs for various months 

of CY 2020  

NRO III No Budget and Financial Accountability Reports submitted 

for CY 2020 

 



 

71 

 

  Delayed and non-submission of the prescribed documents/reports had affected 

the timely and complete examination of related transactions for the purpose of 

ascertaining the validity and proper recognition thereof in the books of accounts.  

 

  Management had already instructed the concerned offices to comply with the 

audit recommendations and strictly adhere to the provision stated in Section 3.1.1 of 

COA Circular 2009-001.  Some offices have already submitted their reports to the 

Audit Team. 

   

We recommended that Management require the concerned officials/ 

personnel of the Accounting, Treasury, and Property Divisions in NCO and 

NROs CAR, I to IV-A, V, VII to IX, and XI to XIII to: (a) immediately submit 

the original copies of lacking DVs, BRSs, contracts/POs, duly signed or 

conformed by the suppliers concerned and their supporting documents, within 

the prescribed period; and, (b) impose suspension of salaries over all responsible 

personnel for unjustifiable causes of persistent non-compliance with the 

submission of prescribed reports and documents.  

 

 

Other Deficiencies Noted 

 

8. Deficiencies in the procurement and utilization of equipment resulted in the 
wastage of government funds and properties. Moreover, disclosure of 

information on the requirements of the IPSAS on some accounts in the Notes to 

FSs was not fully observed, thus giving vague information of the financial 

transactions of the agency.  
 

Inspection of properties and documents related to procurement activities of 

NEDA and its regions revealed the deficiencies in the management and utilization of 

its properties, as presented in Table 11. 

 
      Table 11 - Other Deficiencies in the Management and Utilization of Properties 

Office Deficiencies Recommendations 

NRO I Extravagant procurement of Semi-expendable ICT 

Equipment 

 

Procurement of six units of semi-expendable ICT 

equipment (combo multi-device wireless keyboard and 

mouse) which costs P7,500.00 each or totaling 

P45,000.00 does not adhere to the existing government 

thrust of judicious and prudent use of government 

funds as mandated under Section 2 of PD No. 1445, 

thus, casting doubt on the economy and reasonableness 

of the transaction. 

 

 

 

 

Management to provide valid justifications on the 

purchase of the six units of Semi-expendable ICT 

equipment totaling P45,000.00 and to observe 

austerity, economy and restraint in the utilization 

of government funds pursuant to Section 2 of PD 

No.1445. 

NRO III Unutilized Hydroponics System

further deterioration. 

 

NRO VII Disclosure  requirements in the Notes to FSs not fully 

observed 

 

The disclosure requirements in the Notes to FSs under 

IPSAS 1 and the required pro-forma Notes to FSs 

prescribed in the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, were not 

fully observed, thus information contained in the Notes 

did not adequately provide relevant information on the 

financial position and performance of the agency.  

 

Paragraph 127 of IPSAS 1 states that the Notes to FSs 

shall: 

 

(a) Present information about the basis of 
preparation of the financial statements and 

the specific accounting policies used;   

 

(b) Disclose the information required by IPSAS 
that is not presented on the face of the 

Statement of Financial Position, Statement 

of Financial Performance, Statement of 

Changes in Net Assets/Equity, and 

Statement of Cash Flows; and 

 

(c) Provide additional information that is not 
presented on the face of the Statement of 

Financial Position, Statement of Financial 

Performance, Statement of Changes in Net 

Assets/Equity, and Statement of Cash Flows, 

but that is relevant to an understanding of any 

of them.  

 

The affected accounts that were not fully disclosed in 

the Notes to FS include the Construction in Progress, 

Accounts Payable, Trust Liabilities, Other 

Compensation, Professional Services, Personnel 

Benefit Contributions and Other Maintenance and 

Operating Expenses.  

 

 

 

 

Management to revise the FSs and the 

accompanying Notes and observe the disclosure 

requirements in the preparation; and use the 

prescribed format as provided in GAM for NGAs, 

Volume I. 

 

We recommended that Management of NROs I and III monitor their 

compliance with the recommendations of the Audit Teams concerned to prevent 

extravagant expenditures and efficiently utilize the procured government properties, 

respectively. Likewise, Management of NRO VII to disclose relevant information in 

the Notes to FSs as provided in Volume I, GAM for NGAs.

 Compliance with Other Mandatory Accounts/Areas 

 

9. COVID-19-Pandemic Response and Recovery Interventions 
 

For CY 2020, NEDA had not received funds specifically for Coronavirus 

Disease 2019 (COVID-19) response and/or recovery but has utilized its budget for 

related expenses.   

 

COVID-19-related expenses charged to Personnel Services and Maintenance 

and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE) as of December 31, 2020 amounted to P3.173 

million and P15.543 million, respectively. The results of audit of these COVID-related 

transactions are as follows: 

 

On the provision of supplies/materials for hazard control 

 

Paragraph B, Section VI of Administrative Order No. 2020-0015 of the 

Department of Health (DOH) on Risk-based Public Health Standards Across Settings 

provides that at the minimum, all actors shall implement the prescribed interventions 

in various settings as presented under Annex A-Required Public Health Standards 

Across All Settings as of April 27, 2020, depending on their Risk Severity Grading.  

For each prescribed intervention, concrete examples of corresponding hazard controls 

(e.g. engineering control, administrative control, and PPEs.) are provided. Column D-

Offices/Workplaces of Annex A listed the administrative controls and PPE for 

offices/workplace, such as the provision of tissue, masks, among others.  On the other 

hand, engineering and administrative controls include placement of handwashing 

facilities, hand sanitizers and dispensers with alcohol-based solution in all entrances, 

exits and areas with high foot traffic and facilities. 

 

Whereas, Paragraph B, Section VII of the same Administrative Order provides 

that NGAs shall develop and submit their sector-specific plans and guidelines on the 

operationalization of the risk-based public health standards to the DOH. 

 

The NCO issued Office Circular No. 05-2020 dated May 8, 2020 to provide 

guidelines on the implementation of stringent safety measures against the COVID-19 

which are aligned with the aforementioned provisions of the DOH Administrative 

Order. 

 

Review of the account Other Supplies and Materials Inventory as at December 

31, 2020 of NCO disclosed that supplies amounting to P7.369 million for personnel 

safety and wellness in response to the COVID-19 pandemic were mostly procured from 

the PS. These purchases include facemasks, face shields and gloves for NCO 

employees and utility workers. Alcohol and supplies for disinfection and sanitation 

were also purchased. Issuance of these supplies depends on the frequency/time of 

delivery from the PS.  

 



 

74 

 

The NCO also procured acrylic barriers installed in every table of the 

employees. Necessary in removing contaminants from the air in the rooms, air ionizers 

and purifier were purchased as well. Along with health monitoring purposes, thermal 

scanners and thermometers were purchased and were placed at the main entrance. 

Contactless facial recognition biometric system was procured to avoid cross infection 

of COVID-19 among employees. Lastly, tarpaulins and signages for health and safety 

protocols were displayed at conspicuous areas in the office.  

 

The NROs on the other hand, disbursed an amount of P4.670 million for the 

purchased supplies and services for sanitation and disinfection such as face masks, face 

shields, alcohol, sanitizers, disinfectants, gloves, liquid soap, aerosol, cleaning 

supplies, etc. to be used as precautionary measures to prevent/mitigate the spread of 

COVID-19.  

 

No significant audit observations were noted in NCO and NROs, except for 

NRO XIII where Audit Observation Memorandum No. 2021-004 dated March 23, 2021 

was issued on the payments of P50,657.50 for the procurement of meals, office 

supplies, and other operating expenses made through reimbursement to the NRO’s 

personnel which is inconsistent to the provision of Section 2 of COA Circular No. 97-

002 and Section 48 of the 2016 RIRR of RA No. 9184.  

 

 On the provision of transportation facilities to employees on skeleton workforce  

 

Item C, Section 4.0 of Civil Service Commission (CSC) Memorandum Circular 

(MC) No. 18, s. 2020 states that reasonable transportation facilities and housing 

quarters shall be provided to employees assigned as skeleton workforce, whenever 

practicable, and subject to budgeting, accounting and auditing rules and regulations. 

 

Review of the expenses revealed that the amount of P2.574 million was 

expended under the account Fuel, Oil and Lubricants Expenses of NCO as at December 

31, 2020, intended to provide transportation to personnel on skeleton workforce. 

Inquiry revealed that 28 NEDA vehicles were used to transport employees. All 

available vehicles were used to observe social distancing among passengers. There was 

no acquisition of motor vehicles in CY 2020, however, the amount of P333,458.90 was 

incurred for repairs and maintenance.  

 

Except for the salary of the drivers under the existing contract between NCO 

and Triple 7 Manpower Services, Inc., no additional costs were incurred related thereto. 

 

NROs have also incurred expenses for COVID-19 related expenses such as fuel, 

oil and other lubricants for the transportation of their employees to and from their 

offices. 

 

 

 

 



 

75 

 

On the grant of hazard pay to employees during the ECQ 

 

Section 1 of Administrative Order No. 26 dated March 23, 2020 of the Office 

of the President authorized the NGAs to grant COVID-19 Hazard Pay to personnel who 

physically reported for work during the implementation of Enhanced Community 

Quarantines (ECQs) in their respective work stations, in an amount not exceeding 

P500.00 per day per person. 

 

Section 2 of the same Administrative Order  provides the conditions on the grant 

of the COVID-19 Hazard Pay and that the heads of government agencies may grant the 

COVID-19 Hazard Pay to their personnel/workers without the need for further approval 

by the DBM, subject to the following guidelines and conditions:  

 

1. The personnel are occupying regular, contractual or casual positions, or are 
workers engaged through Contract of Service (COS), job order (JO), or 

other similar schemes. 

 

2. The personnel/workers have been authorized to physically report for work 
at their respective offices or work stations on the prescribed official 

working hours by the head of agency/office during the period of 

implementation of ECQ measures in the area of such office or work station. 

 

3. The total rate of the COVID-19 Hazard Pay shall be based on the number 
of days an employee/worker physically reports for work during the ECQ 

period using the formula under Section 1, which is P500.00 x No. of days 

physically reporting for work during the quarantine period. 

 

Review of the transactions recognized under accounts Hazard Pay and Other 

Maintenance and Operating Expenses for CY 2020 disclosed that NCO granted 

COVID-19 hazard pay at P500.00/day to 189 NCO regular/plantilla officials and 

employees and 61 COS/Service Agreement personnel totaling P1.275 million and 

P0.524 million, respectively, who reported to office during the ECQ (March 17 to May 

15, 2020) and Modified ECQ (MECQ) (May 16 to 31, 2020 and August 4 to 18, 2020).  

 

Verification of the relevant DVs on the grant of hazard pay showed that the 

payments were supported with office order/s of NCO employees including 

COS/Service Agreement personnel authorized to work during the ECQ and MECQ, 

Daily Time Records and summary of all NCO personnel who actually rendered service 

as Skeleton Work Force during the ECQ and MECQ. 

 

Hazard Pay recognized by NROs for CY 2020 amounted to P1.898 million. 

Confirmation with the NROs revealed that most NROs granted hazard pay to its regular 

employees except for NROs VIII and X and to their JOs in NROs I, III, IV-B, VI and 

VIII which amounted to P72,500.   

 



 

76 

 

No significant audit observations were noted in the NROs, except for NRO XIII 

where Notice of Suspension (NS) for claims not supported with documents to validate 

the number of days claimed totaling P23,000.00, and Notice of Disallowance (ND) for 

claims in excess of P500.00 each or a total of P7,500.00. 

 

The amount recognized under Hazard Pay, however, cannot be validated as 

NROs CAR, II, IV-A, IX, and XII did not submit a schedule of COVID-19 related 

expenses. 

 

 

Gender and Development (GAD)  

 

10. Annual GPB and GAD AR were not endorsed and accepted by the PCW and not 
submitted to the Office of the Auditor as required under COA Circular No. 2014-

001 and PCW MC No. 2020-03 and 2021-01. Moreover, actual GAD 

accomplishments deviated from targets, which resulted in costs incurred 

over/under the GPB.  

 

Section 31 of the General Provisions of the GAA for FY 2020 provides, among 

others, that all agencies of the government shall formulate a GAD Plan designed to 

address gender issues within their concerned sectors or mandate. The GAD Plan shall 

be integrated in the regular activities of the agencies, which shall be at least five per 

cent of their budgets. The preparation and submission of the annual GAD Plan and 

annual GAD Accomplishment Report (AR) shall be subject to the guidelines issued 

by the agencies concerned. 

    

Section 4.4 of MC No. 2020-03 issued by the Philippine Commission on 

Women (PCW) set  July 01, 2020 as the deadline for submission for (re-) endorsement 

of adjusted FY 2020 GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) in view of the COVID-19 situation.  

 

Likewise, Section 1.0 of PCW MC No. 2021-01 set March 12, 2021 as deadline 

of submission of GAD ARs of pilot agencies, including NEDA, through Gender 

Mainstreaming Monitoring System (GMMS) Version 3. Section 3.0 of the same MC 

further provides that in line with the goal of transitioning from an output-based to a 

results-based approach to GAD planning and budgeting, the pilot agencies shall 

prepare their FY 2020 GAD AR using the revised GAD AR form. 

   

The annual GBP and AR of NROs should be submitted to NCO for 

consolidation and submission to PCW for endorsement and acceptance. Five working 

days upon the receipt by NCO, a copy of the GBP shall be submitted to the COA Audit 

Team. Likewise, a copy of the corresponding AR shall also be furnished to the Audit 

Team within five working days from the end of January of the preceding year as 

required by COA Circular No. 2014-001 dated March 18, 2014. 

 

Relative to the evaluation on the compliance with GAD requirements by the 

NCO and NROs, the observations noted are summarized in Table 12.

NROs CAR, II, III, V, VI, VII, X, 

XIII 

Formulated and/or submitted GPB and AR to NCO and/or 

COA. 

CAR, I, III, V, IV-B, IX, X Implemented GAD-related activities which are integrated in 

the regular activities.  

II, IV-A, VI, XI, XIII Actual cost incurred exceeded the allotted budget. 

III, V, VII Actual cost incurred was less than the allotted budget. 

             

The NCO was not able to provide the NROs with PCW-endorsed GPB as it 

was not able to submit the consolidated GPB to the PCW. Inquiry with the GAD Focal 

Person showed that NCO was not able to encode the Agency’s GPB in the GMMS 

Version 3. It requested for an extension from PCW for the encoding and submission. 

However, it was instructed to just reflect the CY 2020 GAD programs and activities 

in the CY 2020 AR since the GMMS Version 3 was already closed for the first-time 

submission to avoid system glitches as data from the GPB will be migrated to the 

GAD AR module. Despite the recommended remedy for the non-encoding/non-

submission, the NCO was also not able to encode and submit the consolidated AR to 

PCW on or before the set deadline. The GAD AR was submitted to COA, however, 

this is still in the process of encoding in the system according to the last update 

obtained from the Management. Predictably, the agency was not able to accomplish 

several programs and activities due to COVID-19 pandemic. 

 

Inquiry also revealed another reason for the non-/late submission of NCO 

GAD AR to the PCW and COA which is the current turnover of tasks from the Social 

Development Staff to Corporate Affairs Group and the new focal person is not yet 

familiar with the programs of NEDA’s programs, projects, and activities (PPAs). 

 

The NRO XII was not able to submit the GPB to the Audit Team since it was 

not able to obtain a copy of the PCW-endorsed GPB from the NCO. In addition, the 

NRO did not revise its GAD AR form as prescribed by PCW Memorandum No. 2021-

01. It was only upon inquiry with Management that its report was revised. 

Management explained that it had limited time to prepare the GAD AR considering 

the implementation of the new format from output-based to result-based resulting in 

the delay of its submission to the Auditor. 

 

As to the GPB, it concurred with the audit observation that it was not able to 

obtain a copy from the NCO. Thus, it committed to strictly comply with the applicable 

rules or provisions relative to the submission of the approved GPB and its 

corresponding GAD AR. 

 

To remedy the abovementioned difficulties, the newly organized NEDA GAD 

Focal Point System (GFPS) Inter-Staff Secretariat is in the transition of putting a 

system relative to the consolidation of GPB submission from various units. As one of 

the pilot agencies of the GMMS Version 3, it is currently pilot-testing the use of 



 

78 

 

internal GPB template based on the data requirement of the GMMS Version 3 to 

ensure the succeeding agency-consolidated GPBs are submitted within the deadline. 

            

We recognize the challenges the agency faced in the process of consolidating 

the reports, however, the delay/non-submission of the aforesaid reports has precluded 

the Audit Team to fully evaluate the agency’s compliance with the PPAs implemented, 

in accordance with the rules and regulations on GAD. 

 

The NROs allotted at least five per cent of their budgets and their activities 

currently being undertaken were GAD-related and contribute to economic 

empowerment of marginalized women, protection, promotion, and fulfillment of 

women’s human rights and practice of gender-responsive governance which were 

considered as sufficient compliance with the requirement of Section 31 of the General 

Provisions of the GAA for FY 2020. 

 

 Table 13 below shows the amount of over/underspending for GAD PPAs of 

the agency: 

 
Table 13 - Comparison of GAD Allotted Budget and Actual Expenditures

XIII 2,150,279.53 2,238,033.72 (87,754.19) 

 

It was observed that actual GAD expenditures of NROs III, V and VII were 

less than their allotted budgets while the actual costs incurred by NROs II, IV-A, VI, 

XI, and XIII exceeded their allotted budgets. For CY 2020, these amounts were trivial 

since the aforementioned General Provisions of the GAA for FY 2020 provided that 

the utilization of GAD budget shall be evaluated based on the GAD performance 

indicator identified by the agency. Various PPAs were accomplished by the agency or 

even go beyond its target. Table 14 shows some of the PPAs with the number of 

accomplishment/implementation significantly deviated from target.

Despite the current COVID-19 situation, although some NROs was not able to 

fully accomplish the planned PPAs, the agency was able to accomplish GAD PPAs.  

 

 We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a) Require the GAD Focal Person to strictly ensure the agency’s 
compliance with the applicable rules or provisions relative to the 

submission/endorsement of the GPB and its corresponding GAD AR; 

and 

 

b) Exert more effort to reach/achieve the agency-set targets and/or re-
assess the performance indicator based on the capability of the 

agency. 

 

 

Senior Citizens (SCs) and Persons with Disability (PWDs) 

 

11. The plans, programs, and ARs for SCs and PWDs of NEDA except NRO I were  
prepared in accordance with Section 32 of the General Provisions of FY 2020 

GAA.  

 

Section 32 of the General Provisions of the GAA for FY 2020, requires that all 

agencies of the government formulate plans, programs, and projects intended to 

address the concerns of SCs and PWDs, insofar as it relates to their mandated 

functions, and integrate the same in their regular activities. 

 

Moreover, all government infrastructures and facilities shall provide 

architectural or structural features, designs or facilities that will reasonably enhance 

the mobility, safety and welfare of PWDs pursuant to Batas Pambansa Blg. 344 and 

RA No. 7277. 

 



 

82 

 

          For CY 2020, NROs II, III, IV-A, IV-B, V, VI, VII, IX, XI, and XIII have 

implemented the following projects for SCs and PWDs: 

 

a) Provided priority assistance to SCs/PWDs with disability in facilitating 
their request or claims (e.g. retirement benefits and terminal leave 

benefits); 

b) Provided priority assistance to senior citizens thru the assigned public 
assistance counter officer; 

c) Provided health essential supplies and materials to NEDA employees, 
including senior citizen personnel, and agency contract workers during the 

pandemic;  

d) Adoption of Equal Opportunity Employment Guidelines; 
e) Conducted a webinar with a theme “Guide for NEDAns Towards a 

Fulfilling Retirement”; 

f) Conducted a seminar with topics on Active Ageing, Healthy Bodies and 
Sound Minds; 

g) Conducted a seminar with topics on Gendered and spiritual dimensions of 
retirement and recognition of retirees; 

h) Conducted an orientation on Laws for the Elderly, PWD and Pregnant 
Women; 

i) Conducted an orientation on the Implementation of the Strategic 
Performance Management System and the Grievance Machinery; 

j) Provision and maintenance of wellness room to motivate and encourage 
SCs to remain active in their desired work; 

k) Provision of painted parking signage for PWDs; 
l) Provision and maintenance of wheelchairs and spine boards; 
m) Installation and maintenance of railings in the male and female comfort 

rooms; 

n) Maintenance of elevators, ramps, signboards and wheel chair; and 
o) Maintenance of first aid kits and medical supplies. 

 

                     NRO I, on the other hand, was not able to implement programs and activities 

for the SCs and PWDs due to the COVID-19 pandemic and various protocols being 

implemented by the respective LGUs. Moreover, no data/submission was obtained 

from NCO, NROs CAR, X and XII.  

 

Plans and programs related to SCs and PWDs of NRO VI were integrated in 

the CY 2020 GPB. Accomplishments related thereto were also enumerated in its 

GAD AR for CY 2020. 

 

         We recommended that NRO I’s Management: (a) allocate funds and 

design/formulate and submit formal plans, programs, and activities that address 

the needs of SCs and PWDs; and (b) prepare and submit ARs periodically to the 

COA Audit Team for verification.

Youth Development Projects and Activities  

 

12. NEDA offices, except NCO and NROs IV-A, VI, XI and XIII, have not reported 
their allocated plans and programs intended to address the concerns of the youth, 

thus casting doubt on whether the objectives of the program had been fully 

achieved.  
 

Section 33 of the General Provision of the GAA for FY 2020 requires that all 

agencies of the government provide allocations for youth development projects and 

activities, which shall include government internship opportunities within the 

framework of the Philippine Development Plan (2017-2022).  

 

       For CY 2020, NCO, and NROs IV-A, VI, XI, and XIII have allocated funds 

and implemented the following PPAs related to youth development: 

 

a) Student Internship Program under Work-from-Home Arrangement; 
b) Conducted Economic and Financial Literacy Forum via Zoom in which 68 

students participated;  

c) Conducted knowledge sharing activities; 
d) Provided laptop and printer to deserving student; and 
e) Provided assistance to the youth by facilitating/responding to the request of 

stranded AMA University and ACLC College students for technical 

assistance during community quarantines. 

 

  The PPAs related to the youth of NRO VI were integrated in its CY 2020 GPB. 

The NRO V was able to formulate programs and activities related to youth, however, 

these were not discussed nor enumerated in the Management Letter. On the other hand, 

NRO I, was not able to implement PPAs due to the COVID-19 pandemic and various 

protocols being implemented by the respective LGUs.  

 

        The NROs CAR, II, III, IV-B, VII, IX, X and XII did not provide any 

information related to youth development while report of NRO VIII is yet to be 

submitted. 

 

         We recommended that Management of NROs CAR, II, III, IV-B, VII, 

IX, X and XII provide information on their allocated funds and formulated 

programs and activities related to youth development, as required under Section 

33 of the General Provisions of the GAA for FY 2020. 

 

 

13. Tax Laws and Regulations, GSIS and Pag-IBIG Premium Contributions and 
Loan Amortization, and PhilHealth Premium Contributions 

 

 The agency substantially complied with the witholding and remittance of 

mandatory deductions, pursuant to the regulations issued by the BIR, Government 

Service Insurance System (GSIS), PhilHealth and Pag-IBIG, including loan 



 

84 

 

amortizations. The amount of withholding and remittances for CY 2020 are 

summarized in Table 15.

a) Taxes Withheld and Remittances 
  

  Section 5 of the BIR Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 17-2003 dated March 

31, 2003, amending RR No. 2-98 dated April 17, 1998, among others, provides that 

the withholding tax return, whether creditable or final, shall be filed and payments 

shall be made, within 10 days after the end of each month except for taxes withheld 

for the month of December each year, which shall be filed on or before January 15 

of the following year.  

 

  In CY 2020, NROs I, VI, VII, IX, and X, withheld taxes from the salaries of 

its employees, including contractual service personnel and JOs, Value Added Taxes, 

and other taxes on government purchases of goods and services, amounting to 

P22.850 million which were remitted to the BIR during the year. On the other hand, 

the total balances at year-end of NROs CAR, II, III, IV-A, IV-B, XI, XII, and XIII 

of P3.426 million were remitted in the succeeding year and within the prescribed 

period.  

 

  Further, it was also observed as discussed in Item F of Observation No. 2 that 

NCO has negative balance from prior years that are still subject to 

reconciliation/adjustment. This casts doubt on the accuracy and completeness of the 

recorded balances.  

 

b) GSIS premiums and loan amortizations  
 

Non-acceptance by the Agency Authorized Officer (AAO) of the GSIS of 

premium remittances of NRO IV-A resulted in recurring delays in the 

remittances. 

 



 

85 

 

   Section 6(b) of RA No. 8291 or the GSIS Act provides that “Each employer 

shall remit directly to the GSIS the employee’s and employer’s contribution within 

the first ten (10) days of the calendar month following the month to which the 

contributions apply.  The remittance by the employer of the contribution to the GSIS 

shall take priority over and above the payment of any and all obligations, except 

salaries and wages of its employees.” 

 

   In CY 2020, GSIS contributions on premiums and loan amortizations 

remitted by the NROs amounted to P61.424 million.  

  

   Out of the P5,330.48 consolidated ending balance, the balances of P28.17, 

P1,647.93 and P1,222.29 of NROs CAR, VIII and XIII, respectively, were remitted 

in January 2021 while the P397.10 pertaining to NRO V emanated from over 

withholding of contribution which was eventually reclassified to Due to Officers and 

Employees at year-end. Moreover, the P15.48 balance of NRO XI was a reconciling 

item and was already adjusted at year-end.  

 

  The P1,923.11 balance of NRO IV-A were premiums from the first salary of 

those recent additions to the manpower of the Region. Due to the inability of the 

AAO to update the membership profile in the GSIS system, the remittances of the 

amount withheld were rejected by the system, thus delays were incurred in the 

remittances of the premiums and loan amortization. Likewise, NRO XII incurred 

delays for the same reason and also due to border lockdown caused by COVID-19 

pandemic. NRO XII’s ending balance amounting to P96.40 was remitted on March 

5, 2021. 

  

   We reiterated our recommendation that the concerned Regional 

Directors require: (a) the concerned officials of the timely and accurate 

remittance of GSIS premium contributions and loan amortizations pursuant to 

the provisions of RA No. 8291; and (b) make representations with the proper 

Offices for the expeditious releases of appointment and notices of salary 

adjustments that usually hamper inaccurate and delayed remittances.  

 

c) Pag-IBIG Premium Deductions and Remittances 
 

   The agency’s Pag-IBIG fund contributions and repayment of loan 

amortizations were all promptly remitted, in pursuance to Section 3 of the IRR of RA 

No. 9679, otherwise known as the Pag-IBIG Fund. The contributions withheld in 

NROs totaled P12.280 million, of which the amount of P12.169 million was remitted 

during the year. On the other hand, the P111,131.73 ending balance of NROs V and 

XII and the P0.639 million of NCO were remitted in January 2021. 

 

d) PhilHealth Contributions and Remittances 
 

In CY 2020, NROs, except NRO VII have a total PhilHealth contributions 

withheld of P6.447 million of which the amount of P6.446 million were remitted 



 

86 

 

during the year. However, NROs IV-A, and XI with total balances of P1,409.50 as 

at December 31, 2020 were remitted in CY 2021 within the prescribed period.  

 

It was noted that there has been a delay in the remittance of Philippine Health 

Insurance Corporation contributions for May 2020 in the books of NRO XII due to 

the late processing of payment by the Special Disbursing Officer (SDO), thus, the 

corresponding interest and surcharge amounting to P1,549.11 was charged against 

the salary of the accountable SDO. 

 

Except for the delay noted, the agency had complied and has remitted all due 

contributions, deducted from salaries of its personnel and the government share, 

pursuant to the RIRR of RA No. 9241 (amending RA No. 7875) known as The 

National Health Insurance Act. 

 

 

GSIS Property Insurance Law 

 

14. The continuing disregard of the concerned officials of NRO IV-A to insure its 
properties with the GIF administered by the GSIS is not in accordance with the 

provisions of RA No. 656, and constantly exposes the NRO’s assets to possible 

damage to or loss due to fire, earthquake or other fortuitous events without 

indemnity. 

 

RA No. 656 or the Property Insurance Law, as amended, requires all properties 

of the government to be insured with the Government Insurance Fund (GIF) 

administered by the GSIS. Section 5 of the said law states that, every government, 

except a municipal government below first class, is required to insure its property with 

the fund against any insurable risk therein provided and pay the premiums thereon. 

 

The NCO and NROs I, II, IV-A, V, VI, IX, XI, XII and XIII had complied with 

the Property Insurance Law with PPEs totaling P925.593 million insured with the GIF 

of the GSIS at a total premium of P3.633 million paid in CY 2020.  However, NRO 

IV-A did not insure all its insurable properties, thus, exposing to the risk of not being 

indemnified for any damage or loss due to any fortuitous events. On the other hand, 

NROs III, IV-B, VII, X and CAR have no information about the property insurance. 

 

We recommended that the Management of NRO IV-A to: (a) prepare and 

submit the required Property Insurance Form of all insurable properties to the 

GSIS, copy furnished the Auditor, and ensure that these are adequately covered 

or insured with the GIF of the GSIS; and (b) provide a budget for the insurance 

of all their insurable properties pursuant to the provisions of RA No. 656 to 

protect the interest of the government and to be indemnified for any damage or 

loss that may arise.

15. Hiring of Casuals, Job Orders (JOs), Contractuals, and Consultants 

 
The CSC-COA-DBM Joint Circular (JC) No. 1, series of 2017, provides the 

rules and regulations governing COS and JO workers in the government. Audit of the 

JOs in NCO showed that their contracts are on a daily wage basis as provided in 

Section 6.3.1 of the said JC. The NCO complies with the withholding and remittance 

of taxes of the JOs. Necessary deductions were also made when JOs worked 

undertime. No adverse observations were reported by our Audit Teams in the NROs. 

 

Verification with the Human Resource Management Office showed that 

NEDA has 147 JOs as of December 31, 2020. These JO workers perform mostly 

support services (clerical and administrative duties) to augment the existing manpower 

of the different offices/divisions of NEDA while it is continuously filling up the 

available plantilla positions. 
 

 

16. Status of Settlement of Audit Suspensions, Disallowances, and Charges

Disallowance and Charge (NSSDCs) were issued during the year for the full 

settlement of the NSs. As at December 31, 2020, the NCO and NROs had unsettled 

audit disallowances and charges of P104.889 million and P77,185.33, respectively, as
