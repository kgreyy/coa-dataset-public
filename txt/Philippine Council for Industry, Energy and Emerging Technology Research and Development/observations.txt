PART II – OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

 
Financial Audit 

 
Accounting Errors/Omissions 

 

1. The asset, liability and equity accounts of the Philippine Council for Industry, 
Energy and Emerging Technology Research and Development (PCIEERD) had 

misstatements totaling ₱789,051,427.01, ₱75,059,162.45, and ₱90,297,659.64, 

respectively, which represents 27.34 percent, 16.66 percent, and 3.71 percent of its 

total assets, liabilities and equity, respectively. Due to the significant impact of such 

misstatements on the reported balances of the affected accounts, Management’s 

assertions as to the accuracy, existence, completeness, rights and obligations, cut-off 

and understandability of the said accounts could not be relied upon. 

 

2. Paragraph 27, International Public Sector Accounting Standard (IPSAS) 1 provides 
that financial statements (FSs) shall present fairly the financial position, financial 

performance and cash flows of an entity.  Fair presentation requires the faithful 

presentation of the effects of the transactions, other events and conditions in accordance 

with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses set 

out in International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSASs). The application of 

IPSASs, with additional disclosures when necessary, is presumed to result in financial 

statements that achieve a fair presentation. 

 

3. In our audit of the Agency’s accounts, we noted the following misstatements that 
were not adjusted by Management as at December 31, 2020:

- Item 4.3, COA Resolution No. 2019-016 dated June 25, 2019, re: "Determining and Using Materiality Thresholds in Financial Audit" 

 

a) Erroneous classification of fund transfers to private entities and HEIs; GOCC; and 
SUCs totaling to ₱19,924,412.68 and ₱475,313,779.56 as at December 31, 2020, 

under the Due from National Government Agencies (NGAs) and Due from Non-

Government Organizations/Civil Society Organizations (NGOs/CSOs) account, 

respectively. 

 

4. Fund transfers to private Higher Education Institutes (HEIs) and subsequent 
liquidations thereof were recorded under Due from NGAs account instead of under the 

Other Receivables account, as shown in Table 2 below:

5. On the other hand, Due from NGOs/CSOs account showed that 187 projects/funds 
transfer to private entities and HEIs, GOCC, and SUCs with a total outstanding balance of 

₱475,313,779.56 were erroneously classified under the said account as shown below:

Total 187   475,313,779.56  

 

6. Fund transfer to private entities was erroneously recorded under the Due from 
NGOs/CSOs account due to the absence of COA guidelines. Further, scholarship grants are 

most of the transactions recorded under the Other Receivables account. Hence, the 

misclassification resulted in the understatement/overstatement of the following accounts:

Due from NGOs/CSOs       (475,313,779.56) 

 

7. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to 
prepare the necessary adjusting entries debiting Other Receivables and Due from 

GOCC account in the amount of ₱489,208,192.24 and ₱100,000.00, respectively, and 

crediting Due from NGAs and Due from NGOs/CSOs account by ₱13,994,412.68 and 

₱475,313,779.56, respectively.  
 

b) Duplicate recording of liquidation amounting to ₱804,053.58 under the Due from 
NGAs account 

 

8. Journal Entry Voucher (JEV) No. 2020-10-001788 dated October 30, 2020, had 
recorded the entire liquidation for the first year of implementation of Project 3: 

Investigation of the Factors Affecting the Sensory Properties and Acceptability of VCO 

under Program "Upgrading the PNS for Virgin Coconut” in SL No. 10303010-00-04-37-



48 

035.  However, liquidation amounting to ₱804,053.58 for the same project was previously 

recorded under JEV No. 2019-12-003462 dated December 20, 2019.  Thus, the double 

recording of liquidations understating the Due from NGAs and Accumulated 

Surplus/(Deficit) accounts by ₱804,053.58. 

 

9. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to 
prepare the necessary adjusting entries debiting Due from NGAs account and 

crediting Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) account by ₱804,053.58. 
 
10.  Management also commented that the said liquidation is subject to verification of 
the Accountant. 
 

c) Erroneous recognition of undelivered inventory items of ₱163,235.40 as outright 
expense. 

 

11. Section 7, Chapter 8 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, provides that “When 
inventories are sold, exchanged, or distributed, their carrying amount shall be recognized 

as an expense in the period in which the related revenue is recognized. If there is no related 

revenue, the expense is recognized when the goods are distributed or the related service is 

rendered.” 

 

12. Payment to the Procurement Service-Department of Budget and Management (PS-
DBM) amounting to ₱318,283.12 under Advice to Debit Accounts (ADA) No. 

2000000251 for the procurement of various janitorial and office supplies under Agency 

Procurement Request (APR) No. 2020-004 revealed that only inventory items worth 

₱155,047.72 was delivered. However, it can be noted that the whole amount of 

₱318,283.12 was recognized as Office Supplies Expense and Other Office Supplies and 

Materials Expense accounts amounting to ₱139,053.72 and ₱179,229.40, respectively, as 

if there was an actual delivery for the remaining ₱163,235.40.  

 

13. As a result, the Office Supplies Expense and Other Supplies and Materials Expense 
accounts were overstated by ₱139,053.72 and ₱24,181.68, respectively, and understated 

Due from National Government Agencies (NGAs) account by ₱163,235.40. 

 

14.  We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to 
prepare the necessary adjusting entries for the undelivered items amounting to 

₱163,235.40. 
 

d) Erroneous recognition of materials purchased for the fabrication of six (6) thermal 
scanners overstated the Other Professional Services and Other Supplies and 

Materials Expenses by ₱363,375.00 and ₱180,840.00, respectively, and the 

accounts Other PPE and Accumulated Depreciation were understated by 

₱544,215.00 and ₱51,700.43, respectively. 

 

15. Section 5, Chapter 10 of the GAM Volume I provides that the cost of an item of 
PPE comprised of: 



49 

a. Purchase price, including import duties and non-refundable purchase taxes, 
after deducting trade discounts and rebates; 

 

b. Any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition 
necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by the 

management such as costs of employee benefits arising directly from the 

construction or acquisition of the item of PPE; professional fees, etc; and 

 

c. The initial estimate of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and 
restoring the site on which it is located. 

 

16. Volume III of the GAM on the Revised Chart of Accounts (RCA) (Updated 2019) 
under COA Circular No. 2020-001 dated January 8, 2020, provides the definition of the 

following accounts: 

 

Other Supplies and Materials Expenses - This account is debited to recognize 

the cost of inventories issued to end-users not otherwise classified under the 

specific inventory expense accounts. This account is credited, at year end, to close 

to the Revenue and Expense Summary account, and/or adjustments. 

 

Other Professional Services – This account is debited to recognize the cost of 

other professional services contracted by the agency not otherwise classified under 

any of the specific professional services accounts. This account is credited, at year-

end, to close to the Revenue and Expense Summary account, and/or adjustments. 

 

Other Property, Plant and Equipment - This account is debited to recognize the 

cost of acquisition or fair value, if acquired through donation or transfers without 

cost, of other property, plant and equipment not falling under any of the specific 

Property, Plant and Equipment account. This account is credited upon sale, 

transfers, losses, destruction, derecognition of the carrying amount of the replaced 

portion, other disposal, and/or adjustments. 

 

17. The following payments of materials purchased and professional fees relative to the 
fabrication of six (6) thermal scanners were recorded under Other Professional Services 

and Other Supplies and Materials Expenses account, instead of the appropriate PPE 

account. Moreover, no provision of depreciation was made due to the non-recognition of 

Other PPE account upon the turned over of the thermal scanners to PCIEERD on July 3, 

2020.

18. Due to the failure of the Management to recognize the appropriate PPE account for 
the fabricated thermal scanners, the accounts Other Professional Services and Other 

Supplies and Materials Expenses were overstated by ₱363,375.00 and ₱180,840.00, 

respectively, and the accounts Other PPE and Accumulated Depreciation were understated 

by ₱544,215.00 and ₱51,700.43 as at year-end.  

 

19. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to effect 
the necessary adjusting entries reclassifying the cost of the six (6) thermal scanners 

into its appropriate PPE account and accordingly recognizing the corresponding 

depreciation amounting to ₱544,215.00 and ₱51,700.43, respectively. 
 

20. Management further commented that the Property Section shall submit the List of 
Equipment Purchased (LEP) and Property Acknowledgment Receipt (PAR) and other 

purchase documents of fabricated equipment to the Accounting Section for recording of 

PPE and recognition of depreciation expenses. 

 

e) Failure to recognize semi-expendable items upon delivery resulted in negative 
balance for Semi-Expendable ICT Equipment account under Trust Fund amounting 

to ₱58,000.00 

 

21. Section 15, Chapter 2 of the GAM, Volume I provides that “the FSs shall present 
fairly the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of an entity. Xxx.” 

 

22. We observed that a purchase of four (4) smartphones under JEV No. 2019-11-
001249 dated November 6, 2019 was charged to Trust Fund, where Semi-expendable ICT 

Equipment and Accounts Payable accounts were recognized in the amount of ₱58,000.00.  

We also observed that an adjusting entry was made under JEV No. 2019-12-001637 dated 

December 1, 2019, wherein Other Receivables and Semi-expendable ICT Equipment 



51 

accounts were debited and credited, respectively, by ₱58,000.00. However, the said 

purchase was paid and delivered as per JEV No. 2019-11-001210 dated November 27, 

2019 with no recognition of Semi-expendable ICT Equipment account. Hence, Other 

Receivables account remained outstanding by ₱58,000.00.  

 

23. Further, after the recording of the submitted project liquidation reports to the SA 
by debiting Due to NGAs account and crediting Semi-Expendable ICT Equipment account, 

the Semi-Expendable ICT Equipment account under Trust Fund showed a negative balance 

of ₱58,000.00. In addition, Other Receivables account was still outstanding by the same 

amount of ₱58,000.00.  

 

24. Negative balances are considered abnormal for asset accounts such as inventories 
and the occurrence thereof should prompt the Accounting Division to immediately verify 

their causes, and effect the necessary adjustments in the books of accounts. The existence 

of negative balances cast doubts as to whether purchases and issuances of inventories were 

correctly and completely recorded in the books, thus, affecting the reliability of the 

inventory balances. 

 

25. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to effect 
the necessary adjusting entries debiting Semi-Expendable ICT Equipment and 

crediting Other Receivables account, both by ₱58,000.00. 

 

26. Management replied that an adjusting entry was made under JEV No. 2021-02-
000189 dated February 1, 2021. 

 

27. As a rejoinder, the adjustments made were apparently not completely effected as of 
this report since negative SL balances still exist for two (2) out of the four (4) semi-

expendable items, as follows:  

 

a. Smartphone (10405030-00-02-08-00740) - ₱(9,500.00); and  
b. Smartphone (10405030-00-02-08-00743) - ₱(9,500.00) 

 

f) Non-reclassification of Other PPE of ₱52,040.00 which are below the capitalization 
threshold of ₱15,000.00 to semi-expendable property 

 

28. Section 10, Chapter 8 of the GAM, Volume I provides that “tangible items below 
the capitalization threshold of ₱15,000.00 shall be accounted as semi-expendable 

property. Semi-expendable property which were recognized as PPE shall be reclassified 

to the affected accounts and these tangible items shall be recognized as expenses upon 

issue to the end-user.” 

 

29. Validation showed erroneous recording of liquidation reports submitted by the 
implementing agency on its equipment outlay under JEV No. 2020-07-001331 dated July 

1, 2020 under the Other PPE account for semi-expendable items totaling ₱52,040.00 with 

costs below the capitalization threshold of ₱15,000.00. The related depreciation recognized 

for this was ₱609.56. The non-reclassification to semi-expendable property overstated the 



52 

cost of Other PPE account by ₱52,040.00 and the related Accumulated Depreciation-Other 

PPE and Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) accounts by ₱609.56 and ₱51,430.44, 

respectively. 

 

30. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to 
reclassify the PPE below the capital threshold of ₱15,000.00 by debiting Accumulated 

Depreciation-Other PPE and Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) account in the amount of 

₱609.56 and ₱51,430.44, respectively, and crediting Other PPE account in the amount 

of ₱52,040.00 in accordance with Section 10, Chapter 8 the GAM, Volume I. 
 

31. Management commented that they have already reclassified into semi-expendable 
property all the PPE below the capital threshold of ₱15,000.00. 

 

32. As a rejoinder, we could not validate the compliance of Management as no journal 
entry vouchers were provided. 

 

g) Non-provision of depreciation for ICT Equipment and Other PPE accounts 
amounting to ₱651,733.25 and ₱61,536,924.37, respectively. 

 

33. Chapter 10, Section 27 of the GAM, Volume I provides that “PPE gradually loses 
its ability to provide service over the course of time. Because of this, its cost needs to be 

distributed on a systematic basis over its useful life.”  

 

34. Whereas Section 27(c) states that “Depreciation of an asset begins when it is 
available for use such as when it is in the location and condition necessary for it to be 

capable of operating in the manner intended by management.”  

 

35. Section 8, Chapter 12 of the GAM, Volume I provides that “After initial 
recognition, intangible assets should be carried at its cost less any accumulated 

amortization and any accumulated impairment losses.” 
 

36. Further, Annex M of the same Manual illustrates that the IA shall recognize 
depreciation for PPE purchased and yearly liquidate the said depreciation to the SA. 

 

37. The ICT Equipment and Other PPE accounts of ₱4,051,100.00 and 
₱164,793,818.78, respectively, were not provided with depreciation which includes 

equipment acquired from both the Regular and Trust Funds in CYs 2006, 2010, 2012-2020. 

 

38. Due to the practice of bulk recording of equipment outlay of liquidation reports 
submitted by IAs, depreciation was not properly recognized from the time said equipment 

were recorded in the books of accounts of PCIEERD. Further, we observed that provision 

for depreciation of the said PPE is provided after the inventory of the Property Section and 

detailed reclassification of equipment by the Accounting Section. Consequently, the non-

provision of depreciation for these PPE affected the following accounts:

Due to NGAs (16,373.25) 

Accumulated Depreciation - ICT Equipment 651,733.25 

Accumulated Depreciation - Other PPE 61,536,924.37 

Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) (62,172,284.37) 

 

39. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to: (a) 
refrain from the aggregate recording of equipment outlay during the liquidation of 

the implementing agencies; and (b) effect the necessary adjustments and henceforth, 

ensure the provision of depreciation on all PPE being used in the operation. 

 

h) Erroneous provision for depreciation amounting to ₱1,223,340.90 resulting in 
carrying amount not equal to zero or residual value at the end of estimated useful 

life of PPE 

 

40. Section 27(c), Chapter 10 of the GAM, Volume I states that “Depreciation of an 
asset begins when it is available for use such as when it is in the location and condition 

necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. For 

simplicity and to avoid proportionate computation, depreciation shall be for one month if 

the PPE is available for use on or before the 15th of the month. However, if the PPE is 

available for use after the 15th of the month, depreciation shall be for the succeeding 

month.”  

 

41. Whereas, Section 27(d) also states that “Depreciation of an asset ceases when the 
asset is derecognized. Therefore, depreciation does not cease when the asset becomes idle 

or is retired from active use and held for disposal unless the asset is fully depreciated.” 

 

42. Analysis showed that provision for depreciation was not in accord with the above 
regulations, resulting in the carrying amount not equal to zero or the residual value past the 

end of estimated useful life of various PPE amounting to ₱23,348,328.81, as shown in 

Table 7. 

 

43. The reasons for the erroneous provision for depreciation included: (a) recognition 
of depreciation ceased prior to the end of the useful life of the PPE, (b) depreciation was 

not recorded on month of purchase for PPE purchased up to the 15th day of the month, and 

(c) depreciation was recorded on month of purchase for PPE purchased after 15th day of 

the month.

44. As can be gleaned from Table 7, the erroneous provision for depreciation of fully 
depreciated PPEs amounting to ₱23,348,328.81 resulted in a total NBV of ₱2,390,757.34. 

However, comparison between the NBV and RV amounting to ₱2,390,757.34 and 

₱1,167,416.44, respectively, showed a variance of ₱1,223,340.90. Thus, understating the 

related Accumulated Depreciation account and overstating Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) 

account by ₱1,223,340.90. 

 

45. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to 
strictly comply with Section 27, Chapter 10 of the GAM, Volume I on the provision 

for depreciation of PPE. 
 

46. Management commented that the journal entry for depreciation is auto-generated 
in the Electronic New Government Accounting System (e-NGAS) and this is still being 

referred to the COA- Information and Technology (IT) Section. 

 

i) Inconsistency in the application of estimated useful life for various PPE accounts 
amounting to ₱11,767,695.94 resulting in overstatement of the related Accumulated 

Depreciation and Depreciation Expense account by ₱800,634.64 and ₱450,951.36, 

respectively, and understatement of Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) account by 

₱349,683.28 

 

47. The PCIEERD policy on estimated useful life of PPE, as disclosed in the financial 
statements, is as follows: 

 
Table 8: PCIEERD Policy on Estimated Useful Life 

Account Name Estimated Useful Life 

Office Equipment 5 

ICT Equipment  5 

Communication Equipment 5 

Technical and Scientific Equipment  10 

Motor Vehicles 7 

Furniture and Fixtures  10 

Other PPE 5 

 

48. The above policy on estimated useful life of assets was not consistently applied on 
26 PPE amounting to ₱11,767,695.94 due to the failure of Management to ensure that the 

Accounting personnel-in-charge has an updated list of PPE classification and its useful life. 

Hence, the inconsistency in the application of estimated useful life to its PPE resulted in 

the following discrepancies:

Total (800,634.64) (450,951.46) 349,683.18 

 

49. Due to the failure to provide the correct estimated useful life to its PPE, there is an 
overstatement to the related Accumulated Depreciation and Depreciation Expense by 

₱800,634.64 and ₱450, 951.26, respectively, and an understatement of the Accumulated 

Surplus/ (Deficit) account amounting to ₱349,683.18. 

 

50. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to: 
 

a. effect the necessary adjusting entries by debiting the related Accumulated 
Depreciation account and crediting the Accumulated Surplus/ (Deficit) 

account, both by ₱800,634.64; 

 

b. ensure consistency in the assignment/application of estimated useful life 
for PPE in accordance with the agency’s policy as disclosed in the Notes to 

Financial Statements; and 

 

c. ensure that the Accounting personnel-in-charge has an updated list of PPE 
classification and its useful life. 

 

j) Failure to derecognize accumulated depreciation of ₱51,018.34 for transferred PPE  
 

51. Chapter 10, Section 39 of the GAM, Volume I states that “The cost of the PPE 
together with the related accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss shall 

be removed from the accounts. The carrying amount of an item of PPE shall be 

derecognized on disposal or when no future economic benefits or service potential is 

expected from its use or disposal.” 

 

52. The Accumulated Depreciation - Other PPE account included ₱51,018.34 for items 
already transferred to IAs, contrary to the above guidelines. Moreover, we  observed that 

depreciation on the month of transfer to IAs was not derecognized; thus, overstating the 

Accumulated Depreciation-Other PPE account and understating Accumulated 

Surplus/(Deficit) account by ₱51,018.34. 

 

53. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to (a) 
ensure that the related Accumulated Depreciation account is appropriately 

derecognized with the PPE account, and (b) effect the necessary adjustments by 



56 

debiting Accumulated Depreciation-Other PPE account and crediting Accumulated 

Surplus/(Deficit) account in the amount of ₱51,018.34. 
 

54. Management replied that adjustments were already made per JEV No. 2021-02-
000523. 

 

55. As a rejoinder, we could not validate the adjusting entry made as the said JEV No. 
cannot be found in the e-NGAS. 

 

k) Recognition of equipment/Other PPE acquisition by IAs amounting to 
₱164,523,138.78 

 

56. Section 17(b.2), Chapter 10 of the GAM, Volume I provides for recording of PPE 
acquired through fund transfer to other Government Agencies or NGOs/CSOs in which it 

states that for acquisition by IA/Entity, “The IA/entity shall record and monitor the PPE 

purchased out of inter-agency transferred funds when the PPE meets the recognition 

criteria.” 

 

57. Further, Annex M of the same Manual illustrates that the SA shall recognize PPE 
purchased by the IA upon its return to the SA. 

 

58. Analysis of the Other PPE account showed that acquisition of equipment in the 
liquidation reports submitted by IAs are recognized as PPE by PCIEERD. Moreover, we 

noted that the said recognized PPE were recorded in bulk, not itemized and still in the 

custody of the implementing agencies (IAs). 

 

59. As at December 31, 2020, a total of ₱164,523,138.78 covering 86 projects was 
recorded under Other PPE account. This is composed of equipment outlay recorded in CY 

2020 amounting to ₱33,155,136.00 and recorded in prior years amounting to 

₱131,368,002.78 with dates indicated as early as CY 2006.  

 

60. Thus, the recognition of PPE in the custody of the IA overstated the Other PPE 
account by ₱164,523,138.78 and understated the Due from NGAs and Due from Non-

Government Organizations/Civil Society Organizations accounts by ₱138,502,298.46 and 

₱26,020,840.32, respectively. 
 

61. We recommended that Management require the Accountant to record the liquidation 
of inter-agency transfer fund in strict compliance with the illustrative accounting entries 

shown in Annex M of the GAM, Volume I. 

 

62. As of this report, we did not receive any comment from Management on the 
foregoing audit observation and recommendation. 

 

l) Recognition of not yet due and demandable obligations amounting to 
₱72,940,299.76 

 



57 

63. The Revised Chart of Accounts (RCA) under Volume III of the GAM, which 
contains the list and description of accounts to be used in recording transactions, among 

others, provides the following: 

 

Accounts Payable – This account is credited to recognize receipt of goods or 

services on account in the normal course of trade and business operation. This 

account is debited for payment/settlement of liabilities, and/or adjustments 

 

Due from NGAs – This account is debited to recognize advances for purchase of 

goods/services as authorized by law, fund transfers to the NGAs for 

implementation of projects and other receivables from NGAs. This account is 

credited upon receipt of goods/services, liquidation of fund transfers, receipt of 

payment, settlement, write-off, and/or adjustments. 

 

Due from NGOs/CSOs – This account is debited to recognize amount of advances 

granted to NGOs/ CSOs for implementation of specific projects. This account is 

credited for liquidation, write-off, and/or adjustments 

   

64. Section 37, Chapter 1 of the GAM, Volume I states that no obligation shall be 
certified to accounts payable unless the obligation is founded on a valid claim that is 

properly supported by sufficient evidence and unless there is proper authority for its 

incurrence. 

 

65. Department of Budget and Management (DBM) Circular Letter No. 2013-16 dated 
December 23, 2013, defined the following terms: 

 

Section 5.1. Accounts Payable - refer to valid and legal obligations of NGAs/ 

operating units (OUs), for which, goods/services/projects have been 

delivered/rendered/completed and accepted, regardless of the year when these 

obligations were incurred. 

 

Section 5.5. List of Due and Demandable Accounts Payable with Advice to 

Debit Account (LDDAP-ADA) – refers to an accountable form integrating the 

ADA with the LDDAP which is a list reflecting the names of creditors/payees to 

be paid by the NGA/OU and the corresponding amounts of their unpaid claims, 

duly certified and approved by the heads of the accounting unit and the agency, or 

authorized officials. 

 

Section 5.6. List of Not Yet Due and Demandable Obligations (LNYDDO) – 

refers to a list reflecting the NGA/OU obligations charged against prior years’ 

budget for which, goods, services, and projects are not yet delivered, rendered, nor 

completed/accepted as of December 31 of the preceding year. 

 

66. Moreover, Section 6.1.2 of DBM Circular Letter No. 2013-16 dated December 23, 
2013, states that “Obligations, for which goods/services/projects have not yet been 

delivered/rendered/completed by the creditor and accepted by the NGA/OU, shall not be 



58 

recorded as A/Ps at the end of the year. These obligations shall only be recognized as 

A/Ps on the date of delivery/rendition/completion and acceptance of the 

goods/services/projects, regardless of the year of incurrence of such obligations.” 

 

67. Recognized payables as at year-end included fund transfers to be released to various 
IAs and NGOs/CSOs, thus, the debit to Due from NGAs or Due from NGOs/CSOs accounts 

and the credit to Accounts Payable account amounting to ₱72,940,299.76.  

 

68. We noted, however, that those payables were not yet due and demandable 
obligations or contracts which the government has entered into, i.e., the goods have not 

been delivered or the services have not been rendered. Hence, no payables should be 

recorded at year-end. Similarly, Due from NGAs and Due from NGOs/CSOs accounts 

should not be recognized as there have been no actual transfers of funds to IAs and 

NGOs/CSOs. 

 

69. Inquiry with the Accountant revealed that the noted payables were on-going 
projects which require immediate release of funds to implementing agencies in order not 

to hamper the projects’ activities and utilizing the CY 2020 budget allocation. 

 

70. As of this report, ₱23,399,353.16 or 32.08% of the total recognized NYDDO 
remained to be unpaid. 

 

71. Moreover, validation of the previous practice of recognizing NYDDO showed that 
Other Receivables account remained to be outstanding despite the payment and delivery of 

goods resulting in overstatement of Other Receivables and Accumulated Surplus/ (Deficit) 

account amounting to P26,679,187.13. Details are shown below:

72. Consequently, the above-mentioned practice affected the accuracy of the following 
accounts in the financial statements: 

 
Table 11: List of Accounts Affected 

Account 
 Understated/ 

(Overstated) (₱) 

Due from NGAs               (45,468,442.20) 

Due from NGOs/CSOs               (27,471,857.56)

Accumulated Surplus/ (Deficit)               (26,679,187.13) 

 

73. Based on the Agency Action Plan and Status of Implementation (AAPSI) submitted 
by Management via email on March 23, 2021, the Accounting Section had already stopped 

the practice of recording payables for NYDDO.  We noted, however, that the said practice 

still existed in CY 2020. 

 

74. We reiterated our prior year’s recommendations and Management agreed to 
require the Accountant to: 

 

a. stop the practice of recording of payables for NYDDO; and 
 

b. prepare necessary adjusting entries for the outstanding receivables 
amounting to ₱26,679,187.13. 

 

75. Management commented that the Accountant already stopped the recording of 
Accounts Payables that are not yet due and demandable obligations starting in January 

2021. 

 

m) Erroneous recording of liquidation and reversion of unexpended balances to the SAs 
resulted in the understatement of the Due to NGAs account by ₱2,135,235.94 and 

existence of negative balances amounting to ₱(3,045,317.96) 

 

76. Verification of subsidiary ledger (SL) balances showed erroneous recording of 
liquidations and reversion of unexpended balances to the SAs. Due to the erroneous posting 

of transactions to the SL and the double recording of refunds of unexpended balances to 

SAs resulting from erroneous adjusting entries, the following accounts were 

understated/overstated:

77. It also resulted in the existence of negative balances of some projects, as can be 
gleaned from Table 13.

78. The AAPSI as of December 31, 2020 showed that the Accounting Section had 
analyzed the SLs with negative balances and made the necessary adjusting entries. 

However, negative SL balances identified in the prior year’s audit still existed in CY 2020. 

 

79. Existence of negative SL balances is a red flag that errors were made in the 
recording of transactions. Hence, the Accounting Section should immediately verify the 

causes thereof, and effect the necessary adjustments in the books to prevent the 

accumulation of accounting errors. 

 

80. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to 
review/correct/update the project individual SL and ensure that the balances 

appearing in the SL are properly supported by information traceable to original 

documents to avoid accumulation of negative SL balances. 
 

81. In summary, the total misstatements amounting to ₱789,051,427.01, 
₱75,059,162.45, and ₱90,297,659.64, respectively, which represents 27.34 percent, 16.66 

percent, and 3.71 percent of PCIEERD’s total assets, liabilities and equity, respectively. 

Due to the significant impact of the misstatements on the financial statements of PCIEERD, 

we rendered a Qualified Opinion on the financial statements of the agency as at year-end. 

 

Accounting Deficiencies 

 

82. We also noted some accounting deficiencies which affected the reported balances 
of the accounts in the financial statements, as follows:  

 

a) Unreliable Due from NGAs and Due from NGOs/CSOs account balance of IAs 
 

83. Unreliable Due from NGAs and Due from NGOs/CSOs account balances 
amounting to ₱1,772,069,359.32 and ₱517,358,812.30, respectively, due to: (a) 

reported discrepancies of book balances with the confirmed balances of 

₱143,744,940.89 and ₱3,279,603.56 of several NGAs and NGOs/CSOs/private entities, 

correspondingly; (b) unexpended balances of completed projects in the amount of 

₱1,016,310,225.36 and ₱189,413,183.79, which are outstanding from one (1) year to 

over 10 years in the accounts; and (c) occurrence of negative SL balances amounting 

to ₱(2,935,900.70) for Due from NGAs account as well as for Due from NGOs/CSOs 

account amounting to ₱(69,578.18). 

 

84. PCIEERD, in partnership with other government and private institutions, provide 
financial assistance through its Grants-in-Aids (GIA) Program to support research and 

development program/projects that will contribute significantly to national economic and 

industrial development of the country.  The project shall be covered with Memorandum of 



62 

Agreement (MOA) which embodies the terms and conditions between PCIEERD as the 

SA/ Funding Agency (FA) and Monitoring Agency (MA) and other government agencies; 

NGOs/CSOs; and private institutions as IAs.  Funding of these research projects is sourced 

from the GIA fund of PCIEERD or from DOST and/or attached Agencies and other 

government agencies and PCIEERD may either function as FA or MA.  A Technical Report 

/Financial Report (FR) and Terminal Audited Financial Reports (TAFR) shall be submitted 

in order to account the utilization of the grant.  As MA, PCIEERD shall be in-charge in the 

evaluation, monitoring and assessment of the projects. All funds provided for the projects 

are recorded under the account Due from NGAs and Due from NGOs/CSOs account.

COA Circular No. 94-013 dated 
December 13, 1994 sets forth the 
rules and regulations in the grant, 
utilization and liquidation of funds 
transferred to IAs. This is to 
ensure that the transfer is 
properly taken up in the books of 
the SA and IA and used only for 
the intended purpose and that 
proper accounting and reporting 
is made of the utilization of the 
funds. 
Paragraph 4.6 of said Circular 
provides that within ten (10) days 
after the end of each month/end 
of the agreed period for the 
Project, the IA shall submit the 
Report of Checks Issued (RCI) 
and the Report of Disbursement 
(RD) to report the utilization of the 
funds.  

 
Paragraph 4.9 further states that 
the IA shall return to the SA any 
unused balance upon completion 
of the project while Paragraph 5.4 
provides that the SA shall require 
the IA to submit the reports and 
furnish the IA with a copy of the 
JEV taking up the expenditures.

circumstances: 
 

 Delay/non-

the required FRs

 Failure by the

 Non-forwarding

of the projects were 
attained. The 
continuous existence 
of these unliquidated 
fund transfers in the 
books demonstrates 
laxity of the 
Management in 
monitoring project 
implementation and 
fund utilization. This 
hinders the attainment 
of   the objective            
to translate the fund 
into research outputs 
and the performance 
of the Agency’s 
functions to  “Develop   
and implement 
programs for the 
optimal utilization, 
transfer and 
commercialization of 
technologies and 
other research 
outputs”, and 
“Establish, develop 
and maintain an 
effective system for 
the acquisition and 
dissemination of 
research information.” 
Moreover, the 
existence of the 
unliquidated fund 
transfers in the books.  
 
Furthermore, it 
exposes the 
government to risk of 
loss from bad debt, if 
the receivables are 
proven to be 
uncollectable due to 
failure to timely collect 
the unexpended 
budget.

"Certification by the Accountant 
that funds previously transferred 
to the lA has been liquidated 
and accounted for in the books." 

In addition, we have 
observed that the 
Accountant did not 
issue certifications 
for the previous 
grants that have 
been liquidated as 
required in COA 
Circular No. 2016-
002 dated May 31, 
2016, thus, there is 
a risk that funds are 
released without 
liquidation of 
previous grants. It 
also noteworthy to 
mention that DOST 
Central Office (CO) 
had been in 
compliance with 
COA Circular No. 
2016-002 dated

In effect, post-audit of

Thus, COA Circular No. 2017-002 
dated October 25, 2017, clarified 

Existence of

to ₱2,935,900.70

Any audit observations noted by 
the IA Auditors on the submitted 
LRs had to be communicated to 
the SA Auditor. 
 
COA Circular No. 2016-002 dated

Existence of negative 
SL balances is a red 
flag that errors were 
made in recording of 
transactions. Hence, 
the Accounting 
Section should 
immediately verify the 
cause and effect the 
necessary 
adjustments in the 
books to prevent 
accumulation of 
accounting errors. 
Further, the said 
negative SL balances 
was a reiteration of 
CY 2019 audit 
observation 

 

86. Strict compliance with COA Circular No. 2016-015 dated December 19, 2016, and 
DOST AO No. 011, Series of 2020, dated September 2, 2020, through regular monitoring 

and reconciliation of receivable balances with the IAs shall effectuate timely submission 

of liquidation reports, timely return of unexpended budget, and immediate detection and 

correction of any noted discrepancies. 

 

87. We reiterated our prior year’s recommendations and Management agreed to 
require: 
 

a. The Project Managers (PMs) and the Accountant to: 
 

i. perform periodic reconciliation with the Accountants and Project 
Leaders (PL) of the IAs for the immediate submission of the complete 

documents to PCIEERD for review and recording, in strict compliance 

with COA and DOST guidelines; 

 

ii. revisit all completed projects with outstanding balances and coordinate 
with the IAs for the immediate submission of LRs, and refund of any 

unexpended balances;  

 



66 

iii. submit status report on research outputs for completed projects to 
ensure that funds transferred to IAs were translated into project 

deliverables; and 

 

b. The Accountant to: 
 

i. return the unexpended balance of Malayan Colleges Laguna 
amounting to ₱26,421.46 to DOST; 

 

ii. ensure that the SLs and JEVs be reviewed thoroughly prior to posting 
of transactions in the SL to avoid accumulation of negative balances in 

the future transactions; and 

 

iii. record the necessary adjustments to reflect the correct balances of the 
affected SL. 

 

88. Management replied that while the concerned project managers conduct strict 
monitoring of project implementation, a variance between the book balance and the IAs 

record is likely to happen because adjustments in the Council's book of accounts will 

depend on the submission of the IAs financial report. To address this problem, the Council 

requires all project leaders to input the project releases and disbursements in the Project 

Financial Monitoring Information System (PFMIS) developed by the Council for the 

timely reporting and submission of the FRs to PCIEERD. 

 

89. The Accounting Section will issue a demand letter to the IAs, despite the PMs 
already made a follow-up through email and communication to the IA. In addition, the 

Accountant will issue a certification on the funds reverted to the Bureau of the Treasury 

(BTr) amounting to ₱26,421.46 to the DOST. DBM will no longer release funds for 

completed project.  

 

90. The Accountant also assigned one (1) Accounting Personnel to review and verify 
JEV entries made by the other Accounting Personnel before the approval of the 

Accountant. Further, reclassification has been made in January 2021 amounting to ₱2.8 

million with JEV#2020-01-00000 and the remaining balance subject for adjustment. 

 

91. As a rejoinder, the said reclassification made under JEV#2020-01-00000 could not 
be found in the eNGAS. Hence, we cannot further validate the adjusting entries made. 

 

b) Unreliable Inventory account balance 
 

92. Inventory account balance of ₱1,668,985.99 was unreliable due to: (a) 
recognition of trust funded supplies as an outright expense, and (b) reported variance 

of ₱2,819.59 between the books and the Report on the Physical Count of Inventories 

(RPCI). Moreover, supplies purchased under the trust fund and semi-expendable 

property were not reported/included in the submitted RPCI. 

 



67 

93. Section 9 – Perpetual Inventory Method, Chapter 8 of the GAM, Volume I states 
that “Supplies and materials purchased for inventory purpose shall be recorded using the 

perpetual inventory system, resulting in a more accurate inventory records and a running 

total for the cost of goods sold in each period.  The system requires accounting records to 

show the amount of inventory on hand at all times through the maintenance of the SLC 

(Appendix 57) by the Accounting Division/Unit and Stock Card (SC) (Appendix 58) by the 

Supply and/or Property Division/Unit for each item in stock. Regular purchases shall be 

coursed through the inventory account and issues thereof shall be recorded as they take 

place except for supplies and materials purchased out of PCF for immediate use or on 

emergency cases which shall be charged directly to the appropriate expense accounts.” 
 

94. Annex M of the GAM, Volume I provides illustrative entries for trust receipts – 
inter-agency transferred funds (IATF) for both the SA and IA. 

 

95. Section 17 (i), Chapter 8 of the GAM, Volume I states that “RPCI shall be used to 
report the physical count of supplies by type of inventory as at a given date.  It shows the 

balance of inventory items per card and per count and shortage/overage, if any. These 

include the semi-expendable property wherein the issue is covered by Inventory 

Custodian Slip (ICS).” 
 

96. Comparison of balances between the RPCI and the books of accounts, as at 
December 31, 2020, revealed a variance of ₱2,819.59 as shown below:

97. Further, the RPCI submitted to us on January 27, 2021, comprised only of Office 
Supplies Inventory and Other Office Supplies and Materials Inventory accounts under the 

Regular Fund.  

 

98. Inquiry with the Property Officer revealed that RPCI for trust funded supplies and 
other related materials were not prepared as those items were recognized as an Expense 



68 

account. We also noted that the Property Officer conducted a physical count for those trust 

funded inventory items and semi-expandable property. RPCI for trust funded inventory 

items was submitted to us on February 11, 2021, via email, while RPCI for semi-

expandable property was not yet submitted. 

 

99. Further, RPCI for trust funded supplies did not contain the cost per unit which 
would aid in determining the total value of supplies. Inquiry with the Property Section 

revealed that physical count of supplies under the trust fund was only conducted for 

monitoring purposes of the following year.  

 

100. We noted that some of those inventory items were not yet issued/distributed to the 
end-users and remained in the custody of the Property Section at year-end; hence, the 

reported Inventory account balance is unreliable due to the outright recognition to the 

expense account. Further, it was observed that liquidation reports submitted to the SA were 

inclusive of inventories not yet issued/consumed by the end-users but already expended, 

contrary to the illustrative entries provided in Annex M of the GAM, Volume I. 

 

101. The said practice is contrary to the illustrative entries trust receipts-IATF Annex M 
of the GAM, Volume I where it showed that receipt of supplies and materials shall be 

recorded at its appropriate Inventory account, while issuances of supplies and materials to 

end-users shall be recognized in its applicable Expense account. Further, it was clearly 

presented in the said illustrative entries that only the expensed/issued portion of the 

supplies and other related materials be liquidated to the SA. 

 

102. Hence, the Inventory account is unreliable as the value of the trust funded 
inventories under the custody of the Property Section were not reflected in the year-end 

account balance. 

 

103.  For the semi-expendable property, the RPCI had not yet been submitted to us as of 
this report since the Property Section is in the process of determining the cost and 

acquisition date as there were no previous RPCI to be used as reference. 

 

104.  We recommended and Management agreed to require: 
 

a. The Property personnel to submit RPCI for all inventory accounts under 
the regular and trust funds duly reconciled with the Accounting records; 

and  

 

b. The Accountant to implement the Perpetual Inventory Method for 
supplies and other related materials under the trust fund in accordance 

with Section 9, Chapter 8 of the GAM, Volume I by recording the 

remaining unissued supplies to its appropriate Inventory account. 

 

105. Management commented that the RPCI for office supplies procured under trust-
funded projects will be submitted to the Accounting Section for taking up in the books of 

accounts. Further, RPCI for Semi-Expendable Asset accounts were already submitted on 



69 

April 13, 2021. However, there is a lack of information in the unit value and stock number 

of semi-expendable items because some stickers were already detached. This will be 

subject for further verification with their records and concerned end-users. 

 

106. Moreover, recording of remaining/unissued supplies and materials under the Trust 
Fund will be implemented starting CY 2021 in accordance with Section 9, Chapter 8 of the 

GAM, Volume I upon receipt of the Property Section’s transmittal of the Inventory Report. 

 

c) Unreliable PPE account balance 
 

107. The balance of PPE account of  ₱798,979,035.31 as at December 31, 2020 was 
not reliable due to  a net discrepancy between the balances in the books and the 

RPCPPE amounting to ₱16,584,874.99, which resulted from: (a) recorded PPE not 

found in the RPCPPE; (b) PPE listed in the RPCPPE but not found/counted; (c) PPE 

in the RPCPPE not recorded in the books of accounts; (d) duplicate entries in the 

RPCPPE; and (e) PPE with different amounts recorded in the books and the 

RPCPPE. 

 

108. Section 42, Chapter 10, of the GAM, Volume I provides that “The Chief 
Accountant shall maintain the Property, Plant and Equipment Ledger Card (PPELC) for 

each category of PPE including work and other animals, livestock etc. The PPELC shall 

be kept to record promptly the acquisition, description, custody, estimated useful life, 

depreciation, impairment loss, disposal and other information about the asset. For check 

and balance, the Property and Supply Office/Unit shall likewise maintain Property Card 

(PC) for PPE in their custody to account for the receipt and disposition of the same. The 

balance per PC shall be reconciled with PPELC maintained by the Accounting 

Division/Unit. They shall be reconciled with other property records like PAR.” 

 

109. Comparison of the balances between the Accounting and Property records as of 
December 31, 2020, showed a net discrepancy of ₱16,584,874.99, as shown below:

112. The discrepancies/issues cast doubt on the existence and reliability of the recorded 
PPE, as well as to the related accumulated depreciation and depreciation expense. 



71 

Consequently, there is an understatement/overstatement of the following accounts due to 

unrecorded PPE but included in the RPCPPE:

Other PPE   159,369,780.97  

Total 167,905,918.07 

 

113. We recommended and Management agreed: 
 

a. for serviceable PPE included in the RPCPPE but not recorded in the books, 
to require the Property Officer to submit to the Chief Accountant the 

documents required for recording in the books; and 

 

b. for PPE recorded in the books but not included in the RPCPPE, to require 
the concerned personnel to present the PPE for verification as to existence 

and condition and propose inclusion in the RPCPPE. 

 

e) Unreliable balance of Due to NGAs 
 

114. The accuracy of the Due to NGAs account balance of ₱347,411,978.41 was 
unreliable due to: (a) inclusion of completed projects and non-moving SL balances 

amounting to ₱132,328,000.64 and ₱1,323,262.57, respectively, remained outstanding 

from one (1) year to more than 10 years in the account balances and not returned to 

the SAs, which is inconsistent with Section 63 (f) & (g) of Chapter 6, Volume I of the 

GAM,; (b) variance of ₱171,472,208.29 per confirmation with SAs; and (c) 

unreconciled balances of ₱878,383.14 from the merger of PCIERD and PCASTRD to 

PCIEERD in 2010. 

 

115. The accuracy of the balance of the Due to NGAs account as at December 31, 2020, 
was unreliable due to the following deficiencies:

Further, validation of Cash –

that the amount included trust 
receipts from PCIERD (SL

back up the liability account 
which should have been 
reverted to the BTr as the

completed. 

878,383.14 Due to NGAs 
account balance 
is unreliable as 
the said

anymore. 

 

116. We reiterated our prior year’s recommendations and Management agreed to 
require:  

 

a. The Project Managers to: 
 

i. regularly monitor the projects’ status/implementation; 
 

ii. ensure timely submission of financial reports with the return of 
unexpended balances for completed projects; and 

 

iii. ensure the attainment of the project objectives/deliverables; and 
  

b. The Accountant to: 
 

i. submit the liquidation reports and return/remit the outstanding 
balance to the concerned SAs upon completion of the project; 



73 

ii. evaluate the non-moving SL balances and facilitate the necessary 
liquidation of those projects; 

 

iii. ensure regular reconciliation with the SAs and analyze project SLs 
and effect the necessary adjustments; and 

 

iv. analyze the Due to NGAs and Cash-TAD, Trust accounts of PCIERD 
in order to revert the remaining funds to the BTr and effect the 

necessary adjustments.  

 

117. Management commented that the Accounting personnel in-charge were instructed 
to submit liquidation reports to SAs and to provide a summary of all completed projects 

with submission of FRs and status of the returned unexpended balance (UB) from the 

project. Moreover, the Accountant was instructed to closely monitor the status of 

liquidation to SAs. 

 

118. Management is also considering the creation of a separate Project Management 
Unit in the FAD with additional personnel whose assignment is to conduct regular 

reconciliation of project SLs/per Division due to the volume of projects being monitored 

and funded by PCIEERD. 

 

119. For CY 2021, the PCIEERD target is for the IAs to revert to the BTr all unexpended 
balance from the completed projects and effect the necessary adjustments accordingly. 

Memo will be issued to all IAs with unreturned unexpended balance (UB)/savings from 

completed projects. 

 

Compliance Audit 

 
Overpayment of Hazard Allowance; Subsistence Allowance, and Laundry Allowance 

 

120. Payment of Hazard Pay, Subsistence Allowance, and Laundry Allowance to 
employees working-from-home (WFH) resulted in overpayments amounting to 

₱658,467.56; ₱1,356,099.81; and ₱232,840.88, respectively, contrary to the provisions 

of DBM-DOST Joint Circular (JC) No. 1, dated 25 June 2013. 
 

a) Overpayment of Hazard Allowance amounting to ₱658,467.56  
 

121. Republic Act (RA) No. 8439 dated December 22, 1997 is the “Magna Carta for 
Scientists, Engineers, Researchers and other Science and Technology (S&T) Personnel in 

the Government.” Pursuant thereto, DBM-DOST Joint Circular (JC) No. 1, dated June 25, 

2013, set forth the revised implementing rules and regulations on the grant of 

compensation-related Magna Carta benefits to Scientists, Engineers, Researchers and 

Other Science and Technology Personnel. 

 

122. Section 9.0 of the said JC provides that “Xxx S&T Personnel whose nature of duties 
and responsibilities, actual services, and location of work expose them to great danger, 



74 

occupational risks, perils to life, and physical hardships, may be granted Hazard 

Allowance, but only during periods of actual exposure to hazards and hardships. 

Hazard Allowance may be granted to S&T Personnel if they are at high risk or low risk to 

hazards xxx; high risk to hazards are those that have direct and unavoidable exposure xxx” 

while “low risk to hazards are those exposed to less degree of occupational risks, perils to 

life, or physical harships xxx. The Hazard Allowance for a month shall be based on the 

degree of risk to hazards xxx and the number of workdays of actual exposure over 22 

workdays in a month, at rates not to exceed 30% of monthly basic salary (MBS). In case 

of exposure to both high risk and low risk to hazards, the Hazard Allowance for the month 

shall be based on only one risk level, whichever is more advantageous to the S&T 

Personnel.” Illustrated as follows: 

 

 

 

123. Comparison of the Hazard Allowance payment computation per payroll and the 
guard’s logbook recording physical reporting of employees in the workplace revealed an 

overpayment of Hazard Allowance for CY 2020 amounting to ₱658,467.57.   

 
Table 21: Overpayment of Hazard Allowance for CY 2020

December             37,946.22  

Total           658,467.57  

 

124. The overpayments noted were due to: (a) payment of hazard allowance to 
employees working from home during Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) and 

Modified Enhanced Community Quarantine (MECQ); (b) payment to employees who are 

on study leave; and (c) discrepancies in the number of days an employee reported for work 

per the HR working paper and the guard’s logbook of physical attendance of employees.

Actual Exposure 
High Risk Low Risk 

15 or more days 30% of MBS 15% of MBS 

8 to 14 days 23% of MBS 12% of MBS 

Less than 8 days 15% of MBS 10% of MBS 



75 

125. Section 9 of DBM-DOST JC No. 1 dated June 25, 2013 clearly states that hazard 
allowance may be granted only during actual exposure to hazards and hardships. Hence, 

employees working from home shall not be allowed to receive any hazard allowance as 

they are working in the comfort of their homes.  

 

b) Overpayment of Subsistence Allowance and Laundry Allowance (SALA) 
amounting to ₱1,356,099.81 and ₱232,840.88, respectively  

 

126. DBM-DOST JC No. 1 dated June 25, 2013 provides that: 
 

  10 Subsistence Allowance (SA) 

  

10.1 S&T personnel who are required to render services within the 

premises of offices, laboratories, field operations centers, research 

and development centers, and other S&T facilities, and to make their 

services available at any and all times may be entitled to SA. 

 

10.2 S&T personnel under the following circumstances are not 

entitled to SA: 

 

10.2.1 When not required to make their services available at 

all times such that they can leave their work stations 

during break-times; 

 

10.3 The SA for a S&T personnel shall be: 

 

10.3.1 ₱150 for each day (8 hours) of actual full time service; 

and 

10.3.1 ₱75 for each half-day (4 hours) of actual service. 

 

11 Laundry Allowance (LA) 

  

11.1 S&T personnel assigned in offices, laboratories, field 

operations centers, research and development centers, and 

other S&T facilities, and who are required to wear personal 

protective clothing or uniforms at all times while working, in order 

to provide them the required degree of protection at work, while 

reassuring clients of their professionalism, competency, and 

identity, may be granted LA to defray the cost for washing and 

pressing the uniform/protective clothing. 

 

11.2 An S&T personnel who rendered actual service on all 

workdays in a month may be granted LA at ₱500 per month. 

 

127. Comparison of the number of days an employee reported for work per the SALA 
payrolls and guard’s logbook revealed overpayments amounting to ₱1,356,099.81 and 



76 

₱232,840.88, for Subsistence Allowance and Laundry Allowance, respectively, due to 

payment of SALA to employees working from home.

Total           1,356,099.81               232,840.88  

 

128. Pursuant to the aforementioned provisions, it is clearly stated that SALA may be 
given to employees who reported to the office. Hence, no SALA payment is allowed for 

employees working from home. 

 

129. We recommended and Management agreed to submit a valid explanation why 
the overpayments of Hazard Allowance, Subsistence Allowance, and Laundry 

Allowance should not be refunded by concerned employees; otherwise, a Notice of 

Disallowance shall be issued. 
 

130. Management commented that an explanation and reply to the observation will be 
submitted as this is being referred to the PCIEERD legal adviser for legal interpretation/ 

implementation of DBM-DOST JC No. 1, dated June 25, 2013 and other related Circulars 

brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. 

 

Inadequate documentary requirements 

 

131. Documentary and procedural requirements as set forth in Presidential Decree 
(PD) No. 1445, and COA Circular Nos. 2007-001, 2012-001 and 2016-002 were not 

complied with by the PCIEERD in the grant and liquidation of research funds to 

various NGAs, NGOs/CSOs and private entities, and in the transfer/donation of 

assets to IAs. 
 

a. Inadequate supporting documents relative to grant and liquidation of research 
funds to various NGAs, NGOs/CSOs, and private entities 

 

132. Section 39 of PD 1445 provides that “The Commission shall have the power, for 
purposes of inspection, to require the submission of the original of any order, deed, 

contract, or other document under which any collection of, or payment from, government 



77 

funds may be made, together with any certificate, receipt, or other evidence in connection 

therewith. If an authenticated copy is needed for record purposes, the copy shall upon 

demand be furnished.”  

 

133. Section 4, Item 6 of PD 1445 also provides the fundamental principles governing 
financial transactions and operations, and states that “claims against government funds 

shall be supported with complete documentation.” 

 

134. COA Circular No. 2016-002 dated May 31, 2016 amending Item 3.1.1 of COA 
Circular No. 2012-001 requires a "Certification by the Accountant that funds previously 

transferred to the IA has been liquidated and accounted for in the books." 

 

135. Subsections B and C in Section X of DOST AO No. 011, Series of 2020, dated 
September 2, 2020 further provide the guidelines in the submission of the technical and 

financial reports, respectively, for Grants-in-Aid (GIA) funded projects. 

 

136. Verification of the release of funds to NGAs, NGOs/CSOs and private entities, and 
the liquidation thereof revealed that the Journal Entry Vouchers (JEVs) were not supported 

with complete documentation as required in the above guidelines.  

 

137. Disbursements on fund assistance were not supported with official receipts (ORs) 
to acknowledge receipt of the amount transferred. Further, we observed that funds were 

released to IAs with previously unliquidated fund transfers duly supported with a 

Certification from the Accountant that funds previously transferred to the IA has been 

liquidated and properly taken up in the books.  

 

138. Meanwhile, the majority of the liquidations are supported only by quarter/semi-
annual-annual Financial Report certified correct by the agency Accountant and approved 

by the Head of the IA, with some reports not certified correct by the agency Accountant. 

Moreover, we observed that original copies of the supporting documents were not attached 

to some vouchers, casting doubt on the reliability of the submitted financial reports and 

other related documents. 

 

b. Inadequate supporting documents relative to transfer/donation of assets 
 

139. Verification revealed that the transfer/donation under three (3) JEVs were not 
adequately supported with complete documentation, such as original property transfer 

report (PTR), MOA, and other necessary documents, to  establish the regularity and 

propriety of the recorded transactions.

c. Non-compliance with the minimum counterpart contribution 
 

140. Section 2.1 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 and Section 4.5.4 of COA Circular No. 
2007-001 provide that the NGO shall have an equity equivalent to 20 percent of the 

total project cost which shall be in the form of labor, land for the project site, facilities, 

equipment, and the like, to be used in the project. 

 

141. Section VII of DOST AO No. 011 dated September 2, 2020 provides that the 
Program/Project Leader shall submit the following documents that are required by 

respective DOST funding agencies: 

 

(c) – A counterpart fund, in kind and/or cash, shall be required from the IA 

as one of the application requirements. All projects must have a minimum 

of 15% counterpart contribution, except for projects involving public 

good; 

 

(h.6) – Document showing that NGO/CSO has equity to 20 percent of the 

total project cost, which shall be in the form of labor, land for the project 

site, facilities, equipment, and the like, to be used in the project. 

 

142. In summary, NGOs/CSOs should have a counterpart funding of at least 20% of the 
total project cost, while private sector should have a counterpart funding of at least 15% of 

the total project cost. 

 

143. However, sampling of Line-Item Budget (LIBs) showed that several projects in the 
amount of ₱75,636,065.44 and ₱2,088,458.60 implemented by five (5) NGOs/CSOs and 

one (1) private higher education institution (HEI), respectively, did not meet the required 

counterpart funding requirement with an average of only 8.91% and 5.53% equity allotted, 

as presented below:

144. It is worthy to mention the importance of required counterpart funding from the 
recipient NGO/privately-owned institution to increase their level of commitment to make 

an effective and impactful project. Hence, PCIEERD must be strict in assuring the 

compliance on the required counterpart funding set forth under COA and DOST guidelines.  

 

145. We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 

a. ensure strict compliance with the documentary and counterpart funding 
requirements set forth under DOST and COA guidelines in the approval 

of project proposals, the grants and liquidations of financial assistance, 

and the transfers/donations of assets to IAs; and 
 

b. oblige the Accountant to exercise due diligence in certifying that 
funds/cash advances previously transferred/granted to IAs have been 

liquidated and properly taken up in the books. 
 

146. Management commented on its issuance of a Memorandum to Project Managers 
reminding them of the 20% counterpart funds in compliance with DOST guidelines and 



80 

documentary requirements. The Budget Officer has also started a stricter monitoring of the 

Line-Item-Budget (LIB) requiring the inclusion of counterpart agencies/partner 

institutions. 

 

Non-compliance with Property Insurance Law 

 

147. The Agency’s non-compliance with Republic Act (RA) No. 656 and COA 
Circular No. 2018-002 dated May 31, 2018 on the timely preparation and submission 

of the Property Inventory Form (PIF) resulted in the lack of insurance coverage for 

Technical and Scientific Equipment, Other PPE, and ICT Equipment amounting to 

₱449,000.00, ₱683,921,298.66, and ₱224,938.40, thus, denying adequate protection 

against any damage or loss of its properties.  

 

148. RA 656, known as the Property Insurance Law, as amended by PD 245, requires 
all agencies, except municipal government below first class, to insure its properties against 

any insurable risk with the General Insurance Fund (GIF) administered by the Government 

Service Insurance System (GSIS). 

 

149. COA Circular No. 2018-002 dated May 31, 2018 prescribes the guidelines on the 
submission of Property Inventory Form as basis for the assessment of general insurance 

coverage over all insurable assets, properties, and interests of the government with the GIF 

of the GSIS. 

 

a) Delayed preparation and submission of the PIF precludes the timely 
evaluation of the compliance with relevant guidelines 

 

150. COA Circular No. 2018-002 dated May 31, 2018 stated that the head of the 
agencies shall direct the pertinent official under his/her supervision to: 

 

Paragraph 5.1.b: Prepare the PIF listing of all the insurable properties and other 

assets, showing their latest appraised values/valuation, appraisal date, location, 

and other information; 

 

Paragraph 5.1.d: Cause the appraisal of the insurable properties and other assets 

of their respective offices. For this purpose, an in-house appraisal shall be 

sufficient if the property or insurable interest has a value of P10 million and below. 

Otherwise, an independent appraisal shall be necessary; 

 

Paragraph 5.1.e: Submit the consolidated PIF to the Supervising Auditor/Audit 

Team Leader and the GIF, GSIS, not later than April 30 of each year. 

 

151. The PIF as of December 31, 2019 was submitted to the Audit Team only on March 
10, 2021, therefore, precluding the timely evaluation of the compliance with the related 

guidelines, as well as the communication of the findings to Management.  

 



81 

152. Moreover, the report did not disclose the appraised value of the assets listed. The 
basis of the value covered by insurance and premium payments is the book value of the 

properties, which is the acquisition cost. It must be noted that the responsibility to assess 

the accuracy of the value of the properties lies with the officials of the GIF of the GSIS. 

However, the failure of Management to cause the appraisal of the properties is a non-

compliance with COA Circular No. 2018-002 dated May 31, 2018. It exposes the assets to 

the avoidable risk of loss if the value of the properties is found to be more than the 

acquisition cost. Further, the insurance of PPE at acquisition cost may result to payment of 

higher premiums paid to the GSIS for depreciable assets. 

 

b) Lack of insurance coverage for Technical and Scientific Equipment, Other PPE, 
and ICT Equipment amounting to ₱449,000.00; ₱683,921,298.66; and 

₱224,938.40, respectively, as of December 31, 2019. 

 

153. Summary of the PIF is shown in the table below. These are insured against loss or 
damage by fire or lightning for the period from October 14, 2020 to October 14, 2021. 
 

Table 26: Summary of PIF 

Properties  Total Cost (₱) 

Office Equipment     2,073,791.91  

ICT Equipment   22,265,221.17 

Communication Equipment     1,067,648.98  

Furniture and Fixtures      1,201,407.41  

 

154. The submitted PIF excludes Motor Vehicles, Technical and Scientific Equipment, 
and Other PPE amounting to ₱13,599,704.42, ₱449,000.00; and ₱683,921,298.66, 
respectively. Consequently, there is no insurance coverage for these assets, except for 

motor vehicles which have mandatory insurance as enforced by the Land Transportation 

Office (LTO) in their registration, hence, were insured with the GSIS before the registration 

and thereafter. 

 

155. Inquiry with the Property Section disclosed that the absence of insurance coverage 
for Other PPE is due to the position/location of these assets in the IA. It must be noted that 

the IA shall record and monitor the PPE purchased out of inter-agency transferred funds, 

hence, the obligation to insure the said PPE lies with the IA. However, PCIEERD, being 

the SA, incorrectly recorded the properties purchased through funds transferred to the IAs. 

Due to the said practice, the government is denied the adequate protection against any 

damage or loss of its properties. 

 

156. In addition, not all assets under the ICT Equipment account amounting to 
₱224,938.40, were included in the PIF and consequently insured. 

 

157. The failure of Management to include all the insurable properties in the PIF and 
consequently cover it against insurable risk constitutes non-compliance with the provisions 

of RA 656 and COA Circular No. 2018-002 dated May 31, 2018 and exposes the 

government to avoidable risk of loss to its assets. 



82 

158. We recommended and Management agreed to require the responsible officials 
to: 

 

a. ensure the timely preparation and submission of the PIF to the Audit Team 
in compliance with COA Circular No. 2018-002 dated May 31, 2018; and 

 

b. ensure that all insurable properties, particularly those properties under 
the custody of the IAs, are appraised; insured against all insurable risks 

with the GIF of the GSIS, or if not acceptable to the GIF, with a private 

insurance company included in the PIF; and disclosed in the PIF; and 

 

c. refrain from recording properties that are still at the custody of the 
implementing agencies in strict compliance with the illustrative accounting 

entries shown in Annex M, GAM Volume I.  

 

Purchase of tables and chairs to be used by work-from-home employees 

 

159. Unnecessary purchases of tables and chairs amounting to P21,054.28 were 
made for work-from-home (WFH) purposes, contrary to Office of the President AO 

No. 6 dated September 19, 2017, and COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 

2012.  

 

160. Section 1 of the Office of the President AO No. 6 dated September 19, 2017, 
provided that Xxx. Notwithstanding the repeal of AO No. 103, existing laws, rules, and 

regulations mandating the judicious and prudent use of government funds shall remain 

in full force and effect, and all agencies and instrumentalities shall continue to ensure that 

no irregular, unecessary, extravagant, excessive and unconscionable expenses shall be 

incurred by the Government 

 

161. Likewise, Section 4 of COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012, defines 
Unnecessary Expenditures as expenditures which could not pass the test of prudence or 

the diligence of a good father, thereby denoting non-responsiveness to the exigencies of 

the service. Further, it is an expenditure that is not essential or that which can be dispensed 

with without loss or damage to property. 

 

162. Validation of the following replenishment of petty cash fund revealed that there 
were purchases of chairs and tables worth ₱21,054.28 to be used by PCIEERD’s WFH 

employees. We noted that ergonomic chairs worth ₱6,995.00 were purchased at Super 8 

Grocery, Visayas Avenue, Barangay Bahay Toro, Quezon City, which is more or less 23 

kilometers away from the PCIEERD office. We further noted in the Purchase Request that 

the purpose of the said purchases was for the official use of personnel who work from 

home. 

 

163. Moreover, the purchased tables and chairs worth ₱14,059.28 were delivered to 
PCIEERD and eventually brought home by the concerned personnel for WFH purposes as 

per inspection of the gate pass.

164. Inquiry with the Procurement Section revealed that no internal memorandum/ 
guidelines were issued relative to the purchases of furniture and fixtures for WFH purposes. 

Management commented that approval of the Purchase Request (PR) serves as the 

authority for the concerned personnel to purchase the chairs for WFH. The corresponding 

ICS was already issued to the concerned personnel.  

 

165. Granting that the requisition, procurement and issuance of the items were officially 
approved, the use of the items by the concerned employees in their homes is questionable 

as it is without (legal) basis. Further, the use of government funds should be in strict 

compliance with AO No. 6 dated September 19, 2017 on the continued adoption of 

austerity measures. 

 

166. We recommended and Management agreed to require the concerned 
personnel to submit their authority for the purchase of tables and chairs intended to 

be used in their homes, i.e., for WFH purposes. Otherwise, a Notice of Disallowance 

(ND) shall be issued for the concerned personnel to refund the disbursed amount of 

₱21,054.28.    

 

Project Evaluation 
 

Corona virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)-Related Projects 

 

167. Deficiencies noted in the implementation of COVID-19-related projects 
included: (a) delivery of incomplete accessories and supporting documents to 

hospitals for the swab testing stations; (b) non-operational thermal scanner; (c) 

receivables from FAME Inc. amounting to ₱9,990,000.00 remained outstanding due 

to the non-submission of liquidation reports or terminal accomplishment report with 

supporting documents within two months after project completion on the deployment 

of swab testing stations; and (d) net overpayment of salary of Job Order amounting 



84 

to ₱3,150.00 due to possible laxity in the payment process; hence, the objective of the 

COVID-19 initiative projects may not be fully attained. Moreover, the actual 

deployment of disinfecting chamber system to recipients thereof could not be 

validated in the absence of available documents.  

 

168. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the PCIEERD had initiated the implementation 
of the following projects related to COVID prevention/mitigation with a total budget of 

₱12,509,000.00:

171. In summary, the following deficiencies were noted: 
 

a. Some hospitals did not receive the complete accessories indicated in the packing 
list for assembled specimen collection booth as shown to the supporting 

documents attached to the confirmation letter replies;  

 

b. A recipient received two (2) sets of swab testing booth but received accessories 
such as aircon, chairs, etc. for one (1) set of swab testing booth only; 

 

c. A hospital did not receive any swab testing booth but validation of 
acknowledgement receipt provided by PCIEERD showed that the hospital 

received two (2) swab testing station; 

 

d. Temperature/Thermal Scanners and Bluetooth speakers are accessories received 
by some hospitals but not included in the packing list. Moreover, validation of 

attached supporting documents such as Inspection and Acceptance Report of 

some hospitals showed that no temperature scanners and blue tooth speakers 

were received by them; and 

 

e. Temperature scanner received by a recipient generates an inaccurate result and 
may need calibration or something for its eventual use. 

 

 A COVID 119 Initiative: Production of six (6) units of Artificial 
Intelligence-based thermal scan technology, pilot testing and deployment in 

selected LGUs for DWARM: Autonomous Search and Rescue using 

DWARM Technology 

 

172. Confirmation with Industrial Technology Development Institute (ITDI) on January 
8, 2021 showed that the thermal scanner received on July 3, 2020 was not working since 

September 28, 2020. It was noted that the thermal scanner generates 36.21 degrees reading 

on every person. Hence, ITDI informed PCIEERD that the transfer cannot be processed 

and PTR is on hold until the unit is operational. 

 

173. Due to the failure to provide a complete and functioning equipment/accessory, the 
objective of PCIEERD’s COVID initiative may not be fulfilled as intended. 

 

b. Failure to provide recipients of the necessary documents such as Property 
Transfer Report (PTR) and/or Deed of Donation that show information on the 

cost, technical specification, etc. of the swab testing station resulted in difficulty 

of the recipients in recording the donated equipment in their books. Moreover, no

174. Confirmation revealed that seven (7) out of 50 hospitals did not receive documents 
needed as basis in recording the received swab testing stations as shown below:

Copies of the acknowledgement receipts (ARs) were forwarded to QMMC 
through the COA-QMMC Audit Team since they do not have any available 
document to prove that they received them from DOST-PCIEERD as per the 
QMMC Supply Officer

Amang Rodriguez Memorial 
Medical Center (ARMMC)

Hospital records showed no Deed of Donation nor PTR was issued to 
ARMMC by the PCIEERD to validate the transfer of the above-mentioned 
PPE. Moreover, no copy of Purchase Order (PO) was furnished to the 
ARMMC to ascertain the cost, technical specifications, and description of the 
PPE. Likewise, the Manual of Operations and brochure were not among the 
documents forwarded to the ARMMC. 

3 Batanes General Hospital 1 

No MOA or its equivalent was entered into by parties. No deed of donation 
was received from the SA-DOST. No PTR was received from the SA. Per 
verification, the amount P130,000.00 as shown in the IAR No. 2020-110 dated 
28-May-2020 was only relayed to the Supply Officer via phone call. No formal 
document is on hand showing the actual cost. 

4 Philippine Heart Center (PHC) 1 
As per the confirmation, PHC have no copy of the AR from DOST-PCIEERD 
delivered last April 27, 2020 but attached the PHC Logistics Section 
Endorsement Table as evidenced of receipt of one (1) SCB.

According to the Accountant, the received units/items were not yet taken up 
in books since the time of receipt due to the absence of supporting documents 
as basis in recording the same.

Dr. Jose Fabella Memorial 
Hospital

The unit was delivered on a weekend without any supporting documents and 
was placed at the parking lot near the Pediatric building. Hence, not yet 
recorded in the books due to lack of the necessary documents with the costing 
of the unit to be used as reference for its recording. 

 

175. To summarize, we noted that some hospitals did not know that the deployed swab 
testing stations were from PCIEERD or did not have any documents to prove the receipt 

of the said equipment; hence, we had to provide them with a copy of the acknowledgement 

receipts provided by Management. In addition, some hospitals were not able to record the 

said equipment in their books due to lack of supporting documents such as deed of donation 

and/or PTR.  

 

 USHER GO-CLEAN Disinfecting Chamber System Deployment 
 

176. Confirmation letter was sent to the Philippine General Hospital (PGH) to validate 
whether the chamber system deployed on June 8, 2020 was received by them or not. 

However, no reply was received. In addition, no other documents to validate the actual 

deployment of the chamber system since document such as acknowledgement receipt is 

not yet provided by the Management as of this writing. 

 

177. Inquiry with the Property Officer revealed that a physical inventory of the swab 
testing station and disinfecting chamber system must be conducted before the PTR and/or 

deed of donation be processed.  



90 

 

178. We recommended and Management agreed to require the responsible 
personnel to: 

 

a. furnish a justification for the undelivered accessories; 
 

b.  provide documents that proves the deployment of the swab testing station 
and disinfecting chamber to EAMC and PGH, respectively; 

 

c. provide the lacking accessories and documents such as PTR and/or deed 
of donation to the respective recipients; and 

 

d. ensure that the deployed equipment is operational as intended. 
 

179. Management commented that there was no deployment of disinfecting chamber to 
EAMC.  PCIEERD Inventory Team will visit PGH to conduct inspection and inventory of 

one (1) unit of disinfection chamber and to provide picture of actual deployment of unit at 

the designated area. 

 

180. Management commented that a schedule of physical inventory will be arranged 
before the transfer/donation of equipment and a letter will be sent to IA for the submission 

of complete procurement documents. 

 

181. Further, Management shall issue a letter to request delivery of two (2) units re-
calibrated/repaired equipment to the designated areas. 

 

182. As a rejoinder, the recommendation requires for the submission of documents that 
proves the deployment of the swab testing station to EAMC. 

 

c. Unliquidated receivables from FAME Inc. amounting to ₱9,990,000.00  
 

183. Section 2.1 and 2.2 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 enumerates 
the required documentary requirements for the release of funds, and implementation and 

liquidation of funds to NGOs/CSOs. This is consistent with Section 4(6) of PD 1445 which 

states that claims shall be supported with complete documentation. 

 

184. Section X.A.3 of DOST AO No. 11 dated September 2, 2020 also states that: 
 

A. Roles of the Concerned Institutions/Offices/Staff – (3) The IA shall have 

primary responsibility of all project activities. It shall notify the Monitoring 

Agency of significant concerns problems related to project implementation. 

The Head of the IA shall ensure that the Project Leader submits to the FA 

all the required reports/documents on time. 
  

B. Technical Monitoring – (1.b) Program/projects with one (1) year duration shall 

submit the terminal accomplishment report using DOST Form 15 in two (2) 



91 

hard copies and an electronic copy, not later than two (2) months after 

project completion, together with DOST Form-12 List of Equipment 

Purchased 

 

185. As of this report, receivables from FAME Inc. amounting to ₱9,990,000.00 for the 
implementation of the project entitled “A COVID-19 Initiative: Development of Sixty-Six 

(66) units of Swab Testing Stations and Conduct of Testing and Data Gathering in Selected 

Areas,” remained outstanding despite completion on June 16, 2020.  

 

186. Verification on PCIEERD’s PMIS revealed that PCIEERD made a follow-up for 
the submission of documents in compliance with DOST GIA Guidelines for completed 

projects via letter to FAME Inc. dated November 5, 2020.  Further, it was noted that FAME 

Inc. sent the terminal report and partial supporting documents such as official receipts 

through email on December 9, 2020, and posted in the system on January 13, 2021.  

 

187. As a result, the fabricated and deployed swab testing stations were not yet recorded 
into PCIEERD’s PPE account due to failure to facilitate the liquidation on time despite 

receiving a follow-up letter dated November 5, 2020. Inquiry with Research Information 

and Technology Transfer Division (RITTD) revealed that coordinating and collating the 

documents was a challenge as the people with the documents were work-from-home in 

different locations. In addition, original copies of liquidation reports with complete 

supporting documents should be submitted with the terminal report to the SA-PCIEERD 

for the assigned COA Audit Team to assess and prove the regularity and propriety of the 

disbursements reported in the said FRs. 

 

188. We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Project Manager and 
Accountant to facilitate the liquidation of FAME Inc. outstanding receivables and 

ensure that liquidation reports be submitted with complete and original supporting 

documents such as official receipts (ORs), delivery receipts (DRs) and the covering 

research projects deliverables/output or terminal report duly acknowledged and 

accepted by the Research Information and Technology Transfer Division (RITTD). 
 

189. Management commented that the people with the documents were most of the time 
working from home. It was a challenge coordinating and collating the documents. 

 

d. Net overpayment of salary amounting to ₱3,150.00 
 

190. Section 105 (2) of PD 1445 states that “Every officer accountable for government 
funds shall be liable for all losses resulting from the unlawful deposit, use, or application 

thereof and for all losses attributable to negligence in the keeping of the funds.” 

 

191. Validation of payment of salary of hired job orders under the project DWARM “A 
COVID 19 initiative: Production of six (6) units of Artificial Intelligence- based thermal 

scan technology, pilot testing and deployment in selected LGUs” revealed that actual salary 

payment to the hired Material Management and Business Development Consultant 

amounting to ₱48,500.00 exceeded its monthly rate of ₱45,000.00 by ₱3,500.00. 



92 

 

192. The payment of salary was erroneously computed under LDDAP No. 2020000637 
dated May 22, 2020, for the partial payment of salary or 70% of the total salary as follows:

193. It was also observed that the schedule of computation attached in the disbursement 
voucher was correct, however, the amount paid, net of tax, was mistakenly based on the 

correct gross amount of ₱31,500.00 rather than the net of tax of ₱28,350.00. As a result, 

there was a net overpayment of ₱3,150.00 to the hired Material Management and Business 

Development Consultant. 

 

194. We recommended and Management agreed to require the concerned 
personnel to refund the overpayment of ₱3,150.00. 

 

Other Compliance Issues 
 

Gender and Development (GAD) 

 

195. PCIEERD has partially complied with the guidelines in the preparation of the 
annual Gender and Development Plans and Budgets (GBP) and Accomplishment 

Report (GAD AR) in accordance with the provisions of RA 9710, otherwise known as 

Magna Carta for Women. Further, PCIEERD has partially implemented the GBP, 

as indicated by the partial achievement of the performance indicators/targets 

indicated therein. 

 

a) Partial compliance with the guidelines in the preparation of the Annual GBP and 
GAD AR 

 

196. Section 37 of RA 9710 or the Magna Carta for Women prescribes the guideline on 
the planning, budgeting, monitoring and evaluating for GAD. Paragraph c of subsection A 

provides that: “At least five percent (5%) of the total agency or LGU budget appropriations 

shall correspond to activities supporting GAD Plans and Programs. The agency GAD 

Budget may be allocated using any or a combination of the following: 

 

i. As a separate GAD fund to support GAD-focused programs, projects, and 
activities; 

ii. As fund to support integrating gender-perspectives in regular/flagship 
programs and projects; 



93 

iii. As counterpart fund to support gender-responsiveness Official 
Development Assistance (ODA) – funded projects.” 

 

197. The same subsection designates the Philippine Commission on Women (PCW) to 
review GAD Plans, Programs, and Budgets accompanied by GAD Accomplishment 

Reports submitted annually by all NGAs, bureaus, SUCs, GOCCs, and other government 

instrumentalities for gender responsiveness.  

 

198. Sub-section C of the section prescribes the guideline on the creation on the 
strengthening of the GAD Focal Points (GFPs), including its composition. 

 

199. Section 31 of the General Provisions of the General Appropriations Act for FY 
2020 or RA 11465 states that: “All agencies of the government shall formulate a GAD Plan 

designed to address gender issues within the concerned sectors or mandate and implement 

the applicable provisions under R.A. No. 9710 or the Magna Carta of Women, Convention 

on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the Beijing Platform 

for Action, the Philippine Plan for Gender-Responsive Development (1995-2025) and the 

Philippine Development Plan (2017-2022). The GAD Plan shall be integrated in the 

regular activities of the agencies, which shall be at least five percent (5%) of their budgets. 

For this purpose, activities currently being undertaken by agencies which relate to GAD 

or those that contribute to poverty alleviation, economic empowerment especially of 

marginalized women, protection, promotion, and fulfillment of women’s human rights, and 

practice of gender-responsive governance are considered sufficient compliance with said 

requirement. Utilization of GAD Budget shall be evaluated based on the GAD performance 

indicators identified by said agencies.” 

 

200. Section V of COA Circular No. 2014-001 dated March 18, 2014, provides that “The 
Audited agency shall submit a copy of the Annual GBP to the COA Audit Team assigned 

to the agency within five (5) working days from the receipt of the approved plan from the 

PCW or their mother or central offices, as the case maybe. Likewise, a copy of the 

corresponding Accomplishment Report shall be furnished the said Audit Team within five 

(5) working days from the end of January of the preceding year. 

 

201. PCW Memorandum Circular No. 2020-05 dated September 11, 2020 provides that 
“PCW-endorsed GBPs shall be authenticated by the Gender Mainstreaming Monitoring 

System (GMMS) with a QR code. Agencies shall print the PCW-endorsed GBP for 

signature of their agency head, and disseminate the signed copy to their concerned units. 

Agencies shall also furnish their respective COA Audit Team a copy of their signed GBP 

within 5 working days from its endorsement.” 

 

202. PCW Memorandum Circular No. 2021-01 dated January 20, 2021, states that “FY 
2020 GAD ARs submitted to PCW shall be authenticated by the GMMS with a barcode. 

Concerned agencies shall print the GMMS-authenticated GAD AR for signature of their 

agency head and submit signed copies to PCW and their respective COA Audit Team.”  

 



94 

203. Further, it prescribes in paragraph 5 that “agencies shall accomplish the 
Harmonized Gender and Development Guidelines (HGDG) Project Implementation and 

Management, and Monitoring and Evaluation (PIMME) checklist (HGDG Boxes 16 & 17) 

or the Facility Implementation, Management, and Monitoring and Evaluation (FIMME) 

checklist (HGDG Box F2) to assess the gender-responsiveness of the implementation of 

the program/projects.” 

 

204. Section 4 of RA 7877: Anti-Sexual Harassment Act of 1995 prescribes the duty of 
the employer or head of office in a work-related, education or training environment to 

prevent or deter the commission of acts of sexual harassment and to provide the procedures 

for the resolution, settlement or prosecution of acts of sexual harassment. It states that the 

head of office shall: 

 

(a) “Promulgate appropriate rules and regulations in consultation with and jointly 

approved by the employees or students or trainees, through their duly 

designated representatives, prescribing the procedure for the investigation of 

sexual harassment cases and the administrative sanctions therefor.” 

 

(b) “Create a committee on decorum and investigation of cases on sexual 

harassment. The committee shall conduct meetings, as the case may be, with 

officers and employees, teachers, instructors, professors, coaches, trainors, and 

students or trainees to increase understanding and prevent incidents of sexual 

harassment. It shall also conduct the investigation of alleged cases constituting 

sexual harassment….” 

 

205. Rule XII of Civil Service Commission (CSC) Resolution 01-0940 titled 
Administrative Disciplinary Rules on Sexual Harassment Cases dated May 21, 2001 

provides the duties of the agencies of the government. The resolution also reiterates the 

creation of Committee on Decorum and Investigation (CODI) and rules and 

regulations on sexual harassment. 

 

206. Submitted reports showed that the Agency had allocated a GAD budget for Fiscal 
Year (FY) 2020 amounting to ₱32.63 million which is equivalent to 4.51 percent of 

₱723.98 million of its total appropriations in the General Appropriation Act (GAA) FY 

2020. This is non-compliant with the minimum requirement of five percent (5%).  

 

207. However, the total actual expenditure incurred for in the implementation of the 
GBP is ₱41.68 million or 5.76 percent and 127.76 percent of its total GAD budget and 

appropriation, respectively. 

 

208. The PCW-endorsed GBP for FY 2020 was submitted to the Audit Team on 
September 22, 2020. However, said report was not signed by Head of the Agency. The 

signed report was submitted to the Audit Team on February 22, 2021, due to numerous 

changes in the process; hence, transmittal of the signed report to the Audit Team was 



95 

overlooked. This is non-compliant with the submission guideline set forth in the COA 

Circular and PCW Memoranda mentioned above. 

 

209. We reiterated our prior year’s recommendation and Management and GFPS 
agreed to ensure compliance with the guidelines provided in the PCW Memorandum 

Circular to print the GMMS authenticated GBP and GAD AR for signature of the 

agency head and submit signed copies to PCW and COA within five (5) working days 

from endorsement. 
 

b) Partially implemented GBP as indicated by the partial achievement of the 
performance indicators/targets indicated therein 

 

210. The submitted GBP and GAD AR revealed partial implementation of the GAD 
plan. Summary of the performance indicators/targets not fully implemented are in the table

Failure to create and institutionalize the

211. Further, it must be noted that PCIEERD has only created the CODI on February 
22, 2021. Moreover, PCIEERD currently has no rules and regulations on sexual 

harassment, which is not compliant with the provisions of RA No. 7877 and CSC 

Resolution 01-0940. 

 

 

 



97 

212. We recommended and Management agreed to require: 
 

a. The GFPS to ensure proper and full implementation of the GAD plans; 
and 

 

b. The CODI to prioritize the creation of the rules and regulations on sexual 
harassment to ensure compliance with the RA No. 7877 and CSC 

Resolution 01-0940. 

 

Senior Citizens and Differently-abled Persons 

   

213. Failure to allocate at least one percent (1%) of its agency funds and to 
formulate plans, programs and projects which aim to address the concerns of senior 

citizens and differently-abled persons are contrary to Section 31 of Republic Act (RA) 

No. 10964. 
 

214. Section 33 of RA 11260 states that all agencies of the government shall formulate 
plans, programs and projects intended to address the concerns of senior citizens and 

persons with disability, insofar as it relates to their mandated functions, and integrate the 

same in their regular activities. 

 

215. Likewise, Section 4.2 of the Joint DBM and Department of Social Welfare and 
Development (DSWD) Circular No. 2003-01 dated April 28, 2003, provides that: “All 

government agencies, departments, bureaus, offices, commissions and state universities 

and colleges shall allocate at least one percent (1%) of their respective budget for the 

implementation of plans, programs, projects, activities and services for older persons and 

persons with disabilities.” The total actual expenditures incurred by PCIEERD for the 

following programs, projects, and activities (PAPs) intended to address the concerns of 

senior citizens and persons with disability is ₱2,881,525.00 which is 0.40 percent of the 

total appropriation of ₱723.98 million. This is the total project cost of Development of Data 

Analytics and Information System: Support on Social Welfare Services for Senior Citizens 

of Butuan City. 

 

216. PCIEERD failed to allocate at least one percent (1%) of its FY 2020 appropriation 
or ₱7,239,810.00 for PAPs intended for senior citizens and differently-abled persons in 

accordance with Section 4.2 of the Joint DBM and DSWD Circular No. 2003-01 dated 

April 28, 2003. 

 

217. A similar observation and recommendation were included in the prior year’s audit. 
Management have stated that the implementation of the recommendation is ongoing. It 

must be noted that there has been an increase in the expenditure for programs intended to 

benefit senior citizens and differently-abled persons in CY 2020 of ₱2,585,850.00 or 875 

percent from the CY 2019 expenditure of ₱295,675.00. 

 



98 

218. We reiterated our previous year’s recommendation and Management agreed 
to provide sufficient budget that would address the concern of senior citizens and 

differently-abled persons. 

 

219. The PCIEERD ensured that senior citizens and differently-abled persons are 
considered in its programs and projects. In fact, for 2021 PCIEERD partially allocated 

₱540,000.00 budget for senior citizens and differently-abled person in compliance with RA 

10964. This includes payment of honoraria to technical panel experts, including Senior 

Citizens tapped by the Council in the evaluation of project proposals. Moreover, PCIEERD 

requires its IAs of its funded and monitored projects to fill out the GAD checklist to 

determine if the project is gender sensitive. 

 
Compliance with other mandatory accounts          

 

220. For CY 2020, the status of compliance by the Agency on the withholding and 
remittances of taxes and premiums as well as the government share on various 

contributions within the prescribed period to the concerned institutions or agencies is 

shown in Table 33.
