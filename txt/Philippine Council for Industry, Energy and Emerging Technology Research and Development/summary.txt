E. Summary of Significant Observations and Recommendations 
 

  The other significant observations and recommendations, discussed in detail in 

Part II of the report, are as follows: 

 

Accounting Deficiency 

 

1. Unreliable Due from NGAs and Due from NGOs/CSOs account balances amounting 
to ₱1,772,069,359.32 and ₱517,358,812.30, respectively, due to: (a) reported 

discrepancies of book balances with the confirmed balances of ₱143,744,940.89 and 

₱3,279,603.56 of several NGAs and NGOs/CSOs/private entities, correspondingly; (b) 

unexpended balances of completed projects in the amount of ₱1,016,310,225.36 and 

₱189,413,183.79, which are outstanding from one (1) year to over 10 years in the 

accounts; and (c) occurrence of negative SL balances amounting to ₱(2,935,900.70) for 

Due from NGAs account as well as for Due from NGOs/CSOs account amounting to 

₱(69,578.18). 

 

We reiterated our prior year’s recommendations and Management agreed to 

require: 
 

a) The Project Managers (PMs) and the Accountant to: 
 

i. perform periodic reconciliation with the Accountants and Project 
Leaders (PL) of the IAs for the immediate submission of the 

complete documents to PCIEERD for review and recording, in 

strict compliance with COA and DOST guidelines; 



 iii 

 

ii. revisit all completed projects with outstanding balances and 
coordinate with the IAs for the immediate submission of LRs, and 

refund of any unexpended balances;  

 

iii. submit status report on research outputs for completed projects to 
ensure that funds transferred to IAs were translated into project 

deliverables; and 

 

b) The Accountant to: 
 

i. return the unexpended balance of Malayan Colleges Laguna 
amounting to ₱26,421.46 to DOST; 

 

ii. ensure that the SLs and JEVs be reviewed thoroughly prior to 
posting of transactions in the SL to avoid accumulation of negative 

balances in the future transactions; and 

 

iii. record the necessary adjustments to reflect the correct balances of 
the affected SL. 

 

2. The accuracy of the Due to NGAs account balance of ₱347,411,978.41 was 
unreliable due to: (a) inclusion of completed projects and non-moving SL balances 

amounting to ₱132,328,000.64 and ₱1,323,262.57, respectively, remained outstanding 

from one (1) year to more than 10 years in the account balances and not returned to the 

SAs, which is inconsistent with Section 63 (f) & (g) of Chapter 6, Volume I of the GAM,; 

(b) variance of ₱171,472,208.29 per confirmation with SAs; and (c) unreconciled 

balances of ₱878,383.14 from the merger of PCIERD and PCASTRD to PCIEERD in 

2010. 

 

3. We reiterated our prior year’s recommendations and Management agreed to 
require:  

 

a) The Project Managers to: 
 

i. regularly monitor the projects’ status/implementation; 
 

ii. ensure timely submission of financial reports with the return of 
unexpended balances for completed projects; and 

 

iii. ensure the attainment of the project objectives/deliverables; and 
  

b) The Accountant to: 
 

i. submit the liquidation reports and return/remit the outstanding 
balance to the concerned SAs upon completion of the project; 



 iv 

 

ii. evaluate the non-moving SL balances and facilitate the necessary 
liquidation of those projects; 

 

iii. ensure regular reconciliation with the SAs and analyze project SLs 
and effect the necessary adjustments; and 

 

iv. analyze the Due to NGAs and Cash-TAD, Trust accounts of 
PCIERD in order to revert the remaining funds to the BTr and 

effect the necessary adjustments. 

  

Compliance Audit 

 

4. Payment of Hazard Pay, Subsistence Allowance, and Laundry Allowance to 
employees working-from-home (WFH) resulted in overpayments amounting to 

₱658,467.56; ₱1,356,099.81; and ₱232,840.88, respectively, contrary to the provisions of 

DBM-DOST Joint Circular (JC) No. 1, dated 25 June 2013.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to submit a valid explanation 

why the overpayments of Hazard Allowance, Subsistence Allowance, and Laundry 

Allowance should not be refunded by concerned employees, otherwise, a Notice of 

Disallowance will be issued.  

 

Project Evaluation 

 

5. Deficiencies noted in the implementation of COVID-19-related projects included: (a) 
delivery of incomplete accessories and supporting documents to hospitals for the swab 

testing stations; (b) non-operational thermal scanner; (c) receivables from FAME Inc. 

amounting to ₱9,990,000.00 remained outstanding due to the non-submission of 

liquidation reports or terminal accomplishment report with supporting documents within 

two months after project completion on the deployment of swab testing stations; and (d) 

net overpayment of salary of Job Order amounting to ₱3,150.00 due to possible laxity in 

the payment process; hence, the objective of the COVID-19 initiative projects may not be 

fully attained. Moreover, the actual deployment of disinfecting chamber system to 

recipients thereof could not be validated in the absence of available documents.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the responsible 

personnel to: (a) furnish a justification for the undelivered accessories; (b) provide 

documents that proves the deployment of the swab testing station and disinfecting 

chamber to EAMC and PGH, respectively; (c) provide the lacking accessories and 

documents such as PTR and/or deed of donation to the respective recipients and (d) 

ensure that the deployed equipment is operational as intended.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Project Manager 

and Accountant to facilitate the liquidation of FAME Inc. outstanding receivables 

and ensure that liquidation reports be submitted with complete and original 



 v 

supporting documents such as official receipts (ORs), delivery receipts (DRs) and 

the covering research projects deliverables/output or terminal report duly 

acknowledged and accepted by the Research Information and Technology Transfer 

Division (RITTD). 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the concerned 

personnel to refund the overpayment of ₱3,150.00. 
 

The above observations and recommendations were discussed with the concerned 

officials of the agency through Summary of our Audit Observations and 

Recommendations (SAOR) in lieu of exit conference. Management’s views and 

comments were considered in the report, where appropriate.
