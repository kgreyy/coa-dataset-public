PART II - OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

Financial Audit 
 

Accounting Errors 

 

1. The asset, liability and equity accounts of the Philippine Science High School 
System (PSHSS) had misstatements totaling ₱179,288,588.52, ₱27,256,161.42 and 
₱40,702,949.36, respectively, which represent 2.49%, 9.35% and 0.59% of its total 

assets, liabilities and equity, respectively. Due to the significant impact of such 

misstatements on the reported balances of the affected accounts, Management’s 

assertions as to the accuracy, existence, completeness, rights and obligations, cut-off 

and understandability of the said accounts could not be relied upon. 
 

2. Paragraph 15 of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) 1 
and Section 3, Chapter 19, of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume I, 

states that “Financial statements are a structured representation of the financial position 

and financial performance of an entity. The objectives of general purpose financial 

statements are to provide information about the financial position, financial performance, 

and cash flows of an entity that is useful to a wide range of users in making and evaluating 

decisions about the allocation of resources.” The standards further states that specifically, 

the objectives of general purpose financial reporting in the public sector should be to 

provide information useful for decision making, and to demonstrate the accountability of 

the entity for the resources entrusted to it. 

 

3. Paragraph 27 of the IPSAS provides that financial statements shall present fairly 
the financial position, financial performance, and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation 

requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and 

conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, 

revenue, and expenses set out in IPSASs. The application of IPSASs, with additional 

disclosures when necessary, is presumed to result in financial statements that achieve a fair 

presentation. 

 

4. Our audit revealed several accounting errors/omissions resulting in misstatements 
in the account balances reported in the financial statements of the Philippine Science High 

School System (PSHSS), as summarized in Table 1.

7. Section 44, Chapter 6 of the GAM, Volume 1 states that checks may be cancelled 
when they become stale, voided or spoiled. Section 45 thereof further provides illustrative 

accounting entries for cancelled checks. 

 

8. Bank Reconciliation Statement (BRS) of Philippine Science High School (PSHS)–
Southern Mindanao Campus (SMC) as of December 31, 2020, showed two (2) reconciling 

items: (i) error which overstated the bank balance amounting to ₱1,799,139.98; and (ii) 

outstanding checks amounting to ₱2,036,624.26, which included four (4) stale checks 

totaling ₱57,495.00 have been dormant from 296 to 303 days. 
 

9. The error presented in the BRS amounting to ₱1,799,139.98 consisted of five (5) 
cancelled checks, wherein only four (4) checks totaling ₱118,250.70 were replaced.  The 

cancellation of these checks were not recorded in the books, however, the 

replacement/reissuance of checks/ADA were incorrectly debited to Subsidy from National 

Government instead of Accounts Payable account. 

 

10. While the remaining check amounting to ₱1,680,889.28 was issued twice to a 
certain payee and erroneously recorded in the books as debit to Technical and Scientific 

Equipment amounting to ₱1,795,000.00 and credit to Due to BIR, Guaranty/Security 



40 
  

Deposits Payables and Cash – MDS, Regular accounts in the amounts of ₱96,160.72, 

₱17,950.00 and ₱1,680,889.28, respectively. 

 

11. As a result of the improper recording of the aforementioned journal entries, the 
following accounts were affected: 

 
Account Title Amount Effect 

Technical and Scientific Equipment 1,795,000.00 Overstated 

Due to BIR        96,160.72 Overstated 

Guaranty/Security Deposits Payables 17,950.00 Overstated 

Subsidy from National Government 118,250.70 Understated 

Cash – MDS, Regular   1,799,139.98 Understated 

 

12. On the other hand, it was noted that the Accountant failed to prepare the necessary 
adjusting/reversing entries for the stale checks totaling ₱57,495.00, hence, resulted in the 

understatement of the Cash in Bank-MDS, Regular account and the overstatement of the 

appropriate Expense/Asset account (without the intention to replace) also by the same 

amount. 

 

13. The non-cancellation of stale checks which subsequently remained unadjusted/un-
reverted was due to failure of the Cashier and Accountant to properly monitor the checks 

after it has been issued to the payees.  

 

14. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to: 
 

a. draw a Journal Entry Voucher taking up the proper adjusting entries to 
correct the noted accounting errors, in order to present fairly, the balances 

in the books of accounts: Cash in Bank - MDS, Regular; Subsidy from 

National Government; and other affected real and nominal accounts; and 

 

b. henceforth, record the cancellation and replacement of checks (stale, 
voided or spoiled) and thereafter, properly monitor the checks in 

coordination with the Cashier in accordance with Sections 44 and 45, 

Chapter 6 of the GAM, Volume I.  

 

b) Misstatements in Inventory accounts - ₱ 11,898,212.61

16. Section 7, Chapter 8 of the GAM, Volume I requires that when inventories are 
distributed, their carrying amount shall be recognized as an expense. Moreover, Section 10 

provides that tangible items below the capitalization threshold of ₱15,000.00 shall be 

accounted as semi-expendable property which shall be recognized as expenses upon 

issuance to the end-user. 

 

17. Further, Section 17 of the same Manual requires the preparation of Report of 
Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMIs) (Appendix 64) by the Property/Supply Custodian 

to be used by the Accounting Division as basis in recording the supplies and materials 

issued. 

 

18. In PSHS-Cordillera Administrative Region Campus (CARC) and Ilocos Region 
Campus (IRC), the issuances/distributions of various inventories amounting to 

₱10,316,459.89 and ₱1,581,752.72, respectively, were not recognized in their respective 

books of accounts as expenses, thereby, inevitably overstated the Inventory accounts and 

understated the related expenses account by the same amount.  

 

19. The non-preparation of Requisition and Issue Slips (RIS) and Inventory Custodian 
Slip (ICS) by the Supply and Property Officers, due to overlooked responsibility for all 

issuances which should have been the basis in the preparation of the RSMIs consequently 

affected the appropriate recording of the said inventories. 

 

20. The above-cited accounting errors and omissions resulted in the overstatement of 
Inventory accounts of PSHSS by ₱11,898,212.61 and affected the assertions of accuracy 

and existence of these assets. 

 

21. We recommended and Management agreed to require: 
 

a) the Accountant to make the necessary adjusting journal entries to correct 
the errors noted based on adequate supporting documents; and 

 

b) the Supply Officer to issue RIS/ICS to cover the issuance of inventory 
items and  prepare the RSMI for submission to the Accounting Unit as

faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in 

accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and 

expenses set out in IPSAS.  

 



43 
  

24. Paragraph 14 of the IPSAS 17 provides that, “the cost of an item of PPE shall be 
recognized as an asset if, and only if: (a) It is probable that future economic benefits or 

service potential associated with the item will flow to the entity; and (b) The cost or fair 

value of the item can be measured reliably.” 

 

25. Section 8 (g), Chapter 10 of the GAM requires that as soon as the construction is 
completed, the “Construction in Progress” account shall be reclassified to the proper asset 

account. 

 

26. In CY 2020, various misclassifications and improper recording of transactions 
affecting the accuracy, classification, existence and completeness of the balances of the 

PPE accounts were noted in the following regional campuses:

27. Consequently, the above accounts were not fairly presented in the financial 
statements as of the period ended. 

 

28. We recommended that Management to: 
 

a) require their respective Accountants to prepare the necessary adjusting 
entries on the errors and omissions in recording of transactions to correct 

the reported balances of the affected accounts in the FSs; and   

 

b) direct the SRC to follow up with the concerned government agencies for 
the issuance of TCT in the name of PSHS System, and have the deed of

Management’s Comment and Auditor’s Rejoinder 

 

29. The Management, thru their respective Accounting Offices, acknowledged the 
recommendations and committed to make the necessary adjustments to present the 

financial statements of the agency fairly (CVisC, CARC and SRC). On the contrary, the 

SMC Management commented that adjustments were no longer needed, while the CRC 

Procurement Unit commented that what were paid were installation of the new unit only.  

 

30. The Audit Team stands by its recommendations that proper journal entries on 
cancellation and replacement of checks in accordance with Sections 44 and 45, Chapter 6 

of GAM Volume I; and items consisted mostly of labor component factor, it still extended 

the useful life of the stands on the position that whether the items were acquired through 

lease or outright purchase or the cost of the equipment, hence, should be accounted as asset. 

 

d) Misstatements in Intangible Assets account - ₱2,045,064.00

32. The Revised Chart of Accounts (RCA) for NGAs of the GAM, Vol. III defines 
Computer Software as the account used to recognize the purchase cost or capitalized 

development cost of computer software programs for use in government operation, when 

the software is not an integral part of the related hardware.  

 

33. As to PSHS- Calabarzon Region Campus (CBZRC), the Inspection and Acceptance 
Report (IAR) for the procurement of software licenses was not prepared and furnished to 

the Accounting Office by the Supply/Property Officer, hence, resulted in the non-

recognition of Computer Software under Intangible Assets amounting to ₱2,016,064.00 in 

the books of accounts as at year-end. 

 

34. On the other hand, in PSHS-CARC, Computer Software costing ₱29,000.00 was 
erroneously classified by the Accountant as Technical and Scientific Equipment instead of 

Intangible Assets. 

 

35. We recommended and Management agreed to require: 
 

a) The Supply and Property Officer of PSHS-CBZRC to prepare the IAR for 
the deliveries of computer software and forward the same to the 

Accounting Office together with the copy of PO/contract and Delivery 

Receipt as basis for recording; and 
 

b) The Accountants to prepare the necessary adjusting entries on the errors 
and omissions in the recording of transactions to correct the reported 

balances of the affected accounts in the FSs. 
 

e) Misstatements in Prepayments  
 

36. Disbursements of various subscription of ICT software, library and reading 
materials, cloud computing service, among others, totaling ₱415,180.62 were inadvertently 

classified as Other Prepayments account, representing 52.79% of the account, instead of 

Prepaid Subscription account, contrary to COA Circular No. 2020-001 dated January 8, 

2020 which prescribes the Revised Chart of Accounts (RCA, Updated 2019) replacing the 



46 
  

previous version of the RCA (Updated 2015) under the GAM, Volume III. Although it had 

no effect on the year-end reported Prepayments balance in the FS, said misclassification 

resulted in misstatements in the specific Prepayments balances. 

 

37. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief Accountant 
to expedite the analysis of the accounts with the view of eliminating the unaccounted 

balances and make the necessary reclassification and adjustments, if warranted. 

 

f) Misstatements in Liability accounts - ₱27,256,161.42

to the Accumulated Surplus or Deficit of the General Fund, or the Cumulative Result of 

Operations of the National Government.  Henceforth, all documented accounts payable 

which remain outstanding for at least two years, for which no actual administrative or 

judicial claim has been filed, shall be subject to automatic reversion. 

 

41. Section 2 thereof further provides that all accounts payable which are 
undocumented or not covered by perfected contracts on record, regardless of the year in 

which they were incurred, shall automatically be reverted.  The recording of undocumented 

accounts payable in the books of accounts of agencies shall be strictly prohibited.

43. The above misstatements, accordingly affected the fair presentation of the financial 
statements as at year-end. 

 

44. We recommended and Management of the concerned Campuses agreed to 
require their respective Accountants to correct all noted errors and omissions, and 

henceforth, observe the proper recording, adjustments and reclassifications of 

accounts and transactions which should be supported with necessary documentation 

in accordance with the GAM and other existing accounting rules and regulations.  
 

 

Accounting Deficiencies 

Not restated balances of CY 2019 accounts presented as corresponding figures in the CY 

2020 Consolidated Financial Statements 

 

45. The Calendar Year (CY) 2019 corresponding figures presented in the CY 2020 

FS Consolidated Financial Statements were not restated to reflect prior years’ errors 

and adjustments, which are not in compliance with Sections 43 (b) and 43, Chapter 

19 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume I. 

 

46. Sections 42 (b) and 43, Chapter 19 of the GAM, Volume I state that: 

 

An entity shall correct material prior period errors retrospectively in the first set 

of Financial Statements authorize for issue after their discovery by: 

 

a) restating the comparative amounts for prior period(s) presented in which 

the error occurred; or 

 

b) if the error occurred before the earliest period presented, restating the 

opening balances of assets, liabilities and net assets/equity for the earliest 

prior period presented. 

 

47. Section 43. Limitations of Retrospective Restatement of Prior Period Errors. The 

limitations of retrospective restatement of prior period errors are as follows: 

 

a) A prior period error shall be corrected by retrospective restatement, except 

to the extent that it is impracticable to determine either the period specific 

effects or cumulative effects of the error. (Par. 48 PPSAS 3) 

 

b) When it is impracticable to determine the period-specific effects of an error 

on comparative information for one or more prior periods presented, the 

entity shall restate the opening balances of assets, liabilities, and net 



49 
  

assets/equity for the earliest period for which retrospective restatement is 

practicable (which may be the current period). 

 

c) When it impracticable to determine the cumulative effect, at the beginning 

of the current period, of an error on all prior periods, the entity shall restate 

the comparative information to correct the error prospectively from the 

earliest date practicable. (Par. 50. PPSAS 3) 

 

48. Verification of records disclosed that the balances for CY 2019 accounts presented 

as corresponding figures in the CY 2020 FS were not restated due to the reason that 

accountants at the regional offices had difficulties in restating their FSs despite attendance 

at the seminars conducted by the Government Accountancy Sector (GAS) in the previous 

year, thus, corrections/adjustments were not appropriately reflected. 

 

49. We recommended and the Management agreed to require the accountants to 

properly present prior period errors and adjustments by restating the prior year 

balance of the affected accounts show as corresponding figures for the current year 

Financial Statements in compliance with the requirement of Sections 42 (b) and 43, 

Chapter 19 of the GAM, Volume I.

balances in the FSs were also observed as summarized in Table 10.

a. Unobligated prior year’s hazard pay 

 

51. Review of the disbursement vouchers and other corroborating documents such as: 
(1) Obligation Request and Status; (2) Report of Actual Hazard Allowance Received; (3) 

Summary of DTR on Actual Days of Exposure; (4) Certificate of Eligibility by DOST 

Secretary; and (5) Certification by the PSHS-CRC Director that the amount should be 

charged to current expenses for the payment of Hazard Allowance in CY 2020 revealed 

that the expenditures in the total amount of ₱41,838.06 were incurred in CY 2019.  

 

52. Management confirmed that those expenses pertained to CY 2019 but paid out of 
2020 allotments. The delay in obligation and payment was due to the late issuance of 

Certificate of Eligibility by DOST Secretary and lack of corresponding allotment or agency 

savings for the purpose. 

 

53. The expenditures should have been obligated in CY 2019 prior to the closing of 
books of accounts using the following documents as basis for its computation: 

 

(a) The HA Form 1 prepared by the Hazard Allowance Committee and submitted 

to DOST Secretary that contain the suggested “risk level of exposure” of an 

employee;  

 

(b) The Report of Actual Hazard Allowance Received; and 

 

(c) Summary of DTR on Actual Days of Exposure that can easily be obtain from 

the designated PSHS-CRC personnel 

 

54. If there were no savings generated in CY 2019, the same should not have been 
obligated and paid in the CY 2020 appropriations as it contravened Section 4 and 119 of 

P.D. 1445, thereby, rendering the transaction irregular and disallowable in audit. 

 

 



53 
  

55. We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a) direct the Office of the Campus Director to request from the Central 

Office a Sub-Allotment fund using the savings of FY 2019 to cover the 

claims obligated and paid in the ensuing year; de-obligate the allotment 

used for these claims and set up receivable from concerned Officers and 

Employees for the refund of the said payment; and 

 

b) enjoin the Budget Officer to exercise due diligence in the obligation of 

payables within the authorized appropriation. 

 

b. Non-provision of allowance for impairment 

 

56. The Other Receivable account represents receivables from scholars who did not 
pursue enrolment in Science and Technology courses in college and willful abandonment. 

Analysis of the Other Receivable account of PSHS-CVC and PSHS-SMC as of December 

31, 2020 revealed that allowance for impairment was not recognized/ provided, details in 

Table 11. 

 

Table 11. Other Receivables subject for impairment 

Campus Aging Balance 

CVC 2-7 years 2,332,788.19 

SMC 12 years 4,607,201.48 

 

57. The Accountant commented that the setting up of the allowance for impairment 
loss for dormant accounts was already communicated to the PSHS System and they are 

waiting for their reply for uniform application in all PSHS Campuses, although the SMC 

Accountant mentioned that the set-up will be provided only after sending the third demand 

letter to the defaulting scholars and/or to their parents/guardians.  
 

58. Non-provision of allowance for impairment for overdue/dormant accounts affects 
the Management’s assertion on accuracy and reliability of the account. 
 

59. We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a) direct the Special Committee on Allowance for Impairment Losses to 

intensify collections of scholarship refunds from defaulting scholar 

awardees;  

 

b) require the Accountant to strictly adhere to the provisions of the IPSAS 

on the provision of Allowance for Impairment, for the proper valuation of 

the Other Receivables and for the appropriate recognition of the 

impairment loss; and 

 



54 
  

c) Instruct the Accountant to request for write-off of dormant receivable 

accounts as prescribed in COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 

2016. 

 

c. Non-recognition and non-disclosure of software licenses 

 

60. Audit Team’s review of the accounting records and financial statements of PSHS-
CBZRC revealed non-recognition of Computer Software under Intangible Assets and 

payable accounts and disclosure in the Notes to Financial Statements for undelivered items 

considering that there was approved contract for the procurement of software licenses 

totaling P3,944,068.00 entered into by PSHS-CBZRC on July 1, 2019.   

 

61. The Accountant averred that neither documents relative to the above-mentioned 
procurement was furnished nor received by the Accounting Office, however, the Supply 

and Property Officer disclosed that there was delivery on November 8 and 16, 2019.  It 

was also explained that Inspection and Acceptance Report was not prepared because the 

delivery was not yet completed but the items delivered were physically accepted by the 

end-user who has the technical knowledge of the items delivered. 

 

62. The non-preparation of the Inspection and Acceptance Report by the Supply and 
Property Officer and the non-receipt of documents pertaining to the said procurement by 

the Accounting Office resulted in the non-recognition of Computer Software under 

Intangible Assets as well as payable accounts affected the fair presentation of the financial 

statements and corresponding action of the Agency for the breach of contract made by the 

supplier. 

 

63. We recommended and Management agreed to require: 

 

a) the Supply and Property Officer to: 

 

i. prepare the Inspection and Acceptance Report of deliveries in order, 

whether complete or partial and forward the same to the Accounting 

Office together with the photocopy of PO/contract and Delivery 

Receipt for recording by the Accountant to fairly present the financial 

statements;  

 

ii. submit written explanation on his failure to comply with the 

procedure cited under Sections 15 and 7, Chapters 8 and 19, 

respectively, of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for 

National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I; and 

 



55 
  

b) the Accountant to deduct from the claim of Masangkay Computer Center 

the amount of liquidated damages until such time that the contract has 

been rescinded/terminated or the unperformed items have been delivered. 

 

d. Non-setting up of payables to various creditors 

 

64. The Accounts Payable subsidiary ledgers (SLs) of PSHS-MC showed negative 
amounts of P3,181,842.35 forwarded from prior years’ balances and these negative 

balances were temporarily maintained to reconcile with the overall balance of the general 

ledger accounts. The Accountant explained that the negative balances were the result of 

prior years’ non-setting up of payables before payments to various suppliers/creditors 

which are subject of their analysis and adjustments. 
 

65. These negative amounts in the Accounts Payable account adversely affected the 
reported accounts in the Statement of Financial Position as of December 31, 2020 by 

understating the Asset and Liability accounts by the said amount, contrary to Section 15 of 

the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume I. 

 

66. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to 
conduct immediate analysis of the negative balances reflected in the SLs of Accounts 

Payable and adjust as may be necessary to reflect the correct balances of the said asset 

and liability accounts in the books of the agency, and henceforth, exercise prudent 

analysis/scrutiny of the succeeding transactions to avoid similar recordings. 

 

e. Unreconciled balances of asset accounts 

 

67. Verification of the asset accounts of PSHS-CARC, WVC and SMC revealed 
various discrepancies between general ledgers and other records pertaining to accounting, 

budget and property, thus, accuracy and reliability of the related accounts could not be 

ascertained and as such, remained doubtful. Details are as follows: 

 

i. Unreconciled balances of cash receipts in the Quarterly Report of Revenue and 

Other Receipts (QRROR), Statement of Cash Flows (SCF) and Statement of 

Comparison of Budget and Actual Amounts (SCBAA) 

 

68. Based on the Monthly Report on Collections and Deposits prepared by the Cashier 
for the Regular Agency Fund and Trust Receipts, verified by the Audit Team against the 

actual Official Receipts issued, validated deposit slips and bank statements, the total 

collections made by PSHS WVC as of December 31, 2020 amounted to P647,455.83.   
 

69. Comparison of the balance of the actual receipts presented by the Accountant in the 
QRROR, SCF and SCBAA as of December 31, 2020 against the actual amount collected 

disclosed the following:

      (467,375.07)  Accountant explained that only the

was reported  
SCBAA 439,000.00   (208,455.83) 

SCF 553,604.58     (93,851.25)       

Subject to verification by the 

Accountant and for correction, as may 

be necessary 

 

70. The unreconciled balances of the receipts presented in the QRROR, Statement of 
Cash Flows and SCBAA, rendered the reliability and fair presentation of the information 

in the Financial Statements doubtful. Further, the discrepancy of the balance of receipts 

presented in the QRROR affected the accuracy of the information submitted to the DBM 

and the COA-GAS, which is used by these oversight bodies in the effective monitoring and 

evaluation of the agency’s performance. 

 

71. We recommended and  Management agreed to require the Accountant to: 
 

a. prepare the QRROR for all funds to include the actual receipts recorded 

under the Trust Receipts in accordance with the updated guidelines 

presented in COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2019-01 dated January 1, 

2019; 

 

b. include in the QRROR the collection of receivables and refunds for cash          

advances under the line items for “Other Receipts;” 

 

c. reconcile the balances of the line items for cash inflows presented in the 

Statement of Cash Flows for receipts against the actual recorded receipts; 

 

d. include in the SCBAA under the column for “Actual Amounts on                            

Comparable Basis” all revenues and other receipts actually collected for a 

given period; and 

 

e. prepare all financial reports in accordance with the above-mentioned               

Manual and Joint Circular to ensure the reliability and fair presentation 

of the information presented in these reports. 

 

ii. Unreconciled “Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, Regular” account 

 

72. The unreconciled amount pertains to the ending balance of Philippine Science High 
School – Western Visayas Campus’ (PSHS-WVC) Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, 

Regular account with recomputed balance amounting to ₱305,070.19 as compared to the 

total remittances per audit of ₱462,201.13 which showed an unreconciled amount of 



57 
  

₱157,130.94. No information pertaining to this transaction was presented by the 

Accountant. 

 

73. The existence of the unreconciled amount rendered the balance of the Accumulated 
Surplus/(Deficit) account doubtful. 

 

74. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to:  
 

a. trace the recording of the unreconciled balance amounting to ₱157,130.94 
and make the necessary adjustments, if applicable; and  

 

b. henceforth, record all remittances made by the Cashier to the Bureau of 
the Treasury in accordance with the accounting entries provided in the 

GAM for NGAs. 

 

iii. Unreconciled Semi-expendable property 
 

75. The Statement of Financial Performance as of December 31, 2020 of PSHS WVC 
disclosed the following expenses pertaining to the issuance of Semi-expendable property 

to the end-users for CY 2020. 

 

Table 13. Issued Semi-Expendable Property by the PSHS-WC 

Account 
Balance as at 

December 31, 2020 

Semi-expendable Machinery and Equipment Expenses 403,826.00 

Semi-expendable Furniture, Fixtures and Books Expenses 345,683.75 

TOTAL 749,509.75 

 

76. Relatedly, the results of the physical count of issued semi-expendable property for 
CY 2020 revealed that the total issuances amounting to ₱1,513,155.85, duly supported by 

the Inventory Custodian Slips issued by the Supply Officer. Comparison of the above two 

(2) account balances showed an unreconciled difference of ₱763,646.10 as of December 

31, 2020.  

 

77. The Accountant asserted that all inventory-related expenses recorded in the books 
were all based on the Report of Supplies and Materials Issued submitted to him by the 

Supply Officer. However, they were not able to fully conduct the reconciliation of the 

ending balances of the inventory-related accounts due to the delayed and incomplete 

submission of the Report on the Physical Count of Inventory (RPCI) prior to the 

finalization of the financial statements. 

 

78. The inability of the Accountant and the Supply Officer to reconcile the recorded 
semi-expendable expenses against the actual issuances rendered the reliability of the semi-

expendable expenses presented in the financial statements doubtful. 

 

  



58 
  

79. We recommended and Management agreed to require:  

 

a. The Supply Officer and/or Inventory Committee to timely conduct the 

physical count and to immediately submit the complete copy of the RPCI 

to the Accountant for reconciliation;  

 

b. The Supply Officer to verify with the Accountant whether all items             

issued for CY 2020, covered with the ICS, were correctly recognized in the       

books as semi-expendable property, and the Accountant to implement               

proper accounting treatment depending on the results of the verifications      

made; and 

 

c. The Accountant and the Supply Officer to, henceforth, conduct a               

periodic reconciliation on a semi-annual basis to ensure the reliability of 

the inventory-related balances presented in the Financial Statements. 

 
iv. Unreconciled records on Property, Plant and Equipment 

 

80. Comparison of Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) account balances per 
Statement of Financial Position against the totals per Report on the Physical Count of 

Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) as at December 31, 2020 of Philippine Science 

High School – Southern Mindanao Campus (PSHS-SMC) disclosed a net discrepancy of 

P112,971,575.57. 

 

81. The discrepancy of P112,971,575.57 is due to the following: 

 

a. The Inventory Committee of the agency admitted that they were not able to 

reconcile their balances with that of the accounting records due to time 

constraints since the new deadline for the submission of the RPCPPE is on 

January 15. 

 

b. Likewise, the Property Unit records were not updated on the adjusting entries 

made by the Accounting Unit. 

 

82. Due to the absence of periodic reconciliation between the property and the 
accounting records, the existence, completeness, accuracy, and proper valuation of the PPE 

account could not be ascertained. 
 

83. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant and the 

Property Officer to: 

 

a.  exert more effort for the immediate reconciliation of their respective 

records to determine the causes of the noted discrepancies in the balances 



59 
  

of the PPE accounts so that the necessary adjustments could be effected 

and to avoid reiteration of the same observation in the ensuing year; and 

b. come up with updated records and reconcile these with the Report on the 

Physical Count of PPEs (RPCPPE). 

 

v. Unreconciled balance of Construction in Progress – Buildings and Other 

Structure 

 
84. Review of the Financial Statements (FS) showed that the amount of the 
Construction In Progress - Buildings and Other Structures account as presented in 

Statement of Financial Position (SFP) of PSHS-CARC was not the same as that in the 

Notes to FS, as follows: 

 

Table 14. Unreconciled Balances between SFP and Notes to FS  

Particulars Per SFP Per Notes to FS Difference 

CIP - Buildings and Other Structures ₱74,155,094.53   

Academic Building 1  ₱57,579,379.23  

Academic Building 2  14,997,277.56  

Dormitory Building 2  969,000.00  

TOTAL ₱74,155,094.53 ₱73,545,656.79 ₱609,437.74 

 

85. Verification from the CIP Subsidiary Ledgers (SLs) showed that the information in 
the Notes to FS on the CIP - Buildings and Other Structures was not accurate, as detailed 

below: 

 

Table 15. Unreconciled Balances between SL and Notes to FS  

Particulars Per SL Per Notes to FS Difference 

Academic Building 2 ₱16,575,715.30 ₱14,997,277.56 ₱1,578,437.74 

Dormitory Building 2 - 969,000.00 (969,000.00) 

TOTAL ₱16,575,715.30 ₱15,966,277.56 ₱   609,437.74 

 

86. One of the qualitative characteristics of financial reporting as provided in Section 
6, Chapter 19 of the GAM is reliability, which means that reliable information is free from 

material error and bias, and can be depended on by users to represent faithfully that which 

it purports to represent or could reasonably be expected to represent. 

 

87. Due to the above-mentioned deficiency, the details of the CIP - Buildings and Other 
Structures account as presented in the Notes to FS were not reliable. 

 

88. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to 

ensure that all the information presented in the Notes to Financial Statements are 

consistent with those presented on the face of the Statement of Financial Position, 



60 
  

Statement of Financial Performance, Statement of Changes in Net Assets/Equity, and 

Statement of Cash Flows. 
 

89. In summary, due to the significant impact on financial statements of the total 
misstatements of ₱179,288,588.52, ₱27,256,161.42 and ₱40,702,949.36, which represent 

2.49 percent, 9.35 percent and 0.59 percent of the total Assets, Liabilities and Net 

Assets/Equity, respectively, and with total deficiencies of ₱127,002,303.85 and 

₱3,181,842.35 in Assets and Liabilities accounts, respectively, we rendered a Qualified 

Opinion on the financial statements of the PSHSS as at year-end. 
 

 

Compliance Audit 
 

Unutilized receipts not remitted to the National Treasury 

 

90. Trust receipts of the Western Visayas Campus (WVC) amounting to 

₱482,423.63 were not deposited to the National Treasury, a reduction by 14.52 

percent of the previous year, contrary to Section 6 of the General Provisions of the 

General Appropriations Act (GAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2020. Moreover, PSHS Main 

Campus failed to comply with the advisory of the Bureau of the Treasury on the 

submission of Statement of Account (SOA) for Special Account in the General Fund 

and Trust Fund and the Utilization Report duly verified by the Auditor. 

 

91.   Section 6(a) of the General Provisions of General Appropriations Act (GAA) FY 
2020 defines trust receipts as receipts collected or received from non-tax sources such as 

insurance proceeds, guaranty, donations and deposits and those classified by law or 

regulation as such. 

 

92. Moreover, Item 6.2 of DBM Budget Circular 2004-5A states that “xxx, all agencies 
are authorized to treat the collections from the sources identified xxx as trust receipts to 

be used exclusively for the payment of honoraria and overtime pay herein authorized. 

Agencies may utilize up to one hundred percent (100%) of the said collections for the 

payment of honoraria and overtime pay subject to the guidelines in xxx  of this Circular. 

Any excess in the amount collected shall be remitted by NGAs to the Bureau of the 

Treasury. Xxx.” 

 

93. Likewise, Executive Order No. 431, s. 2005, directs the reversion to the General 
Fund of all dormant accounts, unnecessary special and trust funds for the purpose of 

augmenting the depleting funds of the National Government, which otherwise would be 

borrowed/loaned from outside sources. 

 

94. Of the total reported balance of Cash in Bank – Local Currency, Current Account 
(LCCA) of PSHS WVC amounting to ₱482,423.63 as of December 31, 2020, 94.77 percent 

or ₱457,207.43 pertained to proceeds from the sale of bidding documents, payments from 

students for the replacement of lost books and unexpended balance of funds granted to 

PSHS WVC which had remained idle. 



61 
  

 

95. Although the balance of this account decreased by ₱82,138.10 or 14.54 percent of 
the previous year’s balance of ₱564,561.73, these funds were not yet deposited to the 

National Treasury despite the Auditor’s recommendation to remit the trust receipts which 

resulted in the accumulation of cash deposits in the authorized government depository bank 

of the agency and the non-attainment of the purpose to augment the depleting funds of the 

government. 

 

96. The Accountant’s constant explanation was that, the above receipts were 
considered part of the School’s common fund, and for easy management, it was deposited 

in the local currency, current account maintained in the authorized government depository 

bank.   

 

97. On one hand, PSHS Main Campus (MC) did not comply with the submission of 
Monthly Statement of Accounts (SOA) and Utilization Report (UR) duly verified/validated 

by the COA-Resident Auditor, to the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) which prevented the 

proper accounting in the books of the BTr and reconciliation with the MC records contrary 

to the issued BTr Advisory Guidelines.   

 

98. We reiterated our recommendations and Management agreed to require:  
 

a. The WVC Campus Accountant and the Cashier to remit all unutilized 
balances of trust receipts to the National Treasury at the end of each year; 

and 

 

b. The PSHS MC Accountant to regularly submit to the BTr the required 
Monthly SOA and UR, with validation of the COA-PSHS MC. 

 

Non-compliance with the rules on cash advances 

 

99. The granting, utilization and liquidation of cash advances in three (3) PSHS 
Offices did not comply with the established rules and regulations on cash advances 

contrary to existing laws, rules and regulations. 

 

100. COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 provides that, among others, (a) 
a cash advance shall be reported and liquidated as soon as the purpose for which it was 

given has been served (Item 4.1.3); (b) transfer of cash advance from one accountable 

officer to another shall not be allowed (Item 4.1.6); (c) when a cash advance is no longer 

needed or has not been used for a period of two (2) months, it must be returned to or 

refunded immediately to the collecting officer (Item 5.7); (d) all cash advances shall be 

fully liquidated at the end of each year. Except for petty cash fund, the AO shall refund any 

unexpended balance to the Cashier/Collecting Officer who will issue the necessary official 

receipt (Item 5.8);  

 

101. Section 101 (2), Chapter 5 of P.D. No. 1445 states that every accountable officer 
shall be properly bonded in accordance with law.   Likewise, 5.1 of Treasury Circular No. 



62 
  

02-2009 provides that the amount of bond shall be based on the total accountability of the 

AO as determined by the head of the agency. 

 

102. The following summarized the deficiencies noted in the granting, utilization and 
liquidation of cash advances:

and every month end 
thereafter. 

 

103. The above deficiencies mark the inadequacy of strong control in the handling cash 
by AOs which exposed the accumulated amount to possible loss/misuse. 

 

Non-compliance with rules in the management of inventories 

 

104. Failure of three (3) regional campuses to observe rules in the proper 
supply/inventory management which may affect their operational performance in 

achieving their goals. 

 

a. Non-adherence to the two-month requirement of supplies 
 

105. The Instructions under Appendix 60 prescribed the used of Purchase Request (PR) 
form by the Supply and /or Property Custodian for purchasing goods/supplies/property 

requested not available on stock. While the Requisition and Issue Slip (RIS) form shall be 

used by the Requisitioning Office for item/s carried in stock and by the Supply and/or 

Property Division/Unit to issue the items requested as prescribed in the Instructions under 

Appendix 63 

 

106. Section 25 of the General Provisions (GP) of the GAA FY 2020 provides that 
“Inventory of Supplies, Materials and Equipment Spare Parts. The inventory of supplies, 

materials and equipment spare parts to be procured shall not exceed the agency’s two-

month requirement. The head of agencies may increase their inventory of critical supplies, 

materials and equipment spare parts to be procured in any of the following instances: (i) 

in anticipation of cost increases; (ii) necessitated by a national emergency; (iii) when there 

is an impending shortage; and (iv) when otherwise authorized in this Act or in the Charter 

of the Agency concerned. The purchase of stocks exceeding an agency’s one-year 

requirement shall be subject to approval by the President of the Philippines, upon the Joint 

recommendation of the COA and the Secretary concerned. Agencies may undertake 

emergency procurement of supplies, materials and equipment spare parts when there is an 

unforeseen contingency requiring immediate purchase subject to the conditions prescribed 

under Republic Act (RA) No. 9184, its IRR and GPPB guidelines.” 

 

107. During the last quarter of CY 2020, PSHS-Calabarzon Region Campus (CBZRC) 
proceeded with the purchase of common-used supplies despite the availability of stocks in 

the Supply and Property Unit, and did not consider the quantity of items procured that 

exceeded the two-month consumption requirement as at year-end and there was no 

occurrence of urgency/unforeseen contingency, contrary to the above-cited provisions.    

Likewise, in Bicol Region Campus (BRC), we noted the absence of proper planning and 

monitoring in the procurement of inventories that resulted in overstocking of semi-

expendable ICT equipment and semi-expendable communication equipment as these items 

exceeded the two-month requirement as provided under the GP of the GAA. There were 

also slow moving inventories like medical, dental laboratory supplies, semi-expendable 



64 
  

office equipment, semi-expendable technical and scientific equipment and semi-

expendable books that remained unutilized/un-issued for six months to one year. 

 

b. Non-conduct of physical count of semi-expendable property 
 

108. Section 13, Chapter 8, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs requires the conduct of the 
physical count/inventory on a semi-annual basis. The results of this procedure shall then 

be included in the Report on the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) to report the physical 

count of inventory items by type of inventory at a given date, including semi-expendable 

property wherein the issuance is covered by the ICS. 

 

109. The failure of the PSHS-Western Visayas Campus Inventory Committee to include 
the issued semi-expendable property amounting to P12,152,920.55 in the semi-annual 

physical count and the absence of a monitoring report over these assets cast doubt on their 

existence/condition and exposed them to the risks of loss and/or misuse. 

 

110. We recommended  and Management agreed to enjoin the Campus Directors 
of: 

 

a. CBZRC to: 
 

i. require the Supply and Property Unit Officer to stop the practice 
of overstocking in conformity with the two-month requirement as 

provided under Section 25 of the General Provisions of the 

General Appropriations Act for FY 2020; and 

 

ii. strictly adhere to the Instructions stated in Appendices 60 and 63 
of the GAM for NGAs, Volume II; 

 

b. BRC to require the Supply Unit to properly plan and monitor the 
procurement and movement of inventory in stocks to avoid 

overstocking, non-moving and slow-moving items and its possible 

wastage or obsolescence; and 

 

c. WVC to require: 
 

i. the Inventory Committee to conduct physical count of all semi-
expendable assets issued from CYs 2017 to 2020; henceforth, 

conduct regularly a semi-annual physical count of inventory items 

including issued Semi-expendable property and to report thereof 

in a separate RPCI; and  

 

ii. the Supply Officer to maintain a regularly updated master list of 
all semi-expendable property to monitor and safeguard all its 

assets. 

 



65 
  

Non-compliance with rules in property management 

 

111. Deficiencies were noted in two (2) Campuses in the management of their 
property due to non-adherence to pertinent laws and rules on property management 

in safeguarding their assets. 

 

a. Failure to submit the required Property Inventory Form (PIF) 
 

112. COA Circular No. 2018-002 dated May 31, 2018 prescribes the guidelines on the 
submission of PIF as basis for the assessment of general insurance coverage over all 

insurable assets, properties, and interest of the government with the General Insurance 

Fund (GIF) of the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS). Section 5.1.e thereof 

requires the submission of consolidated PIF to the Supervising Auditor/Audit Team Leader 

and the GIF, GSIS not later than April 30 of each year. 

 

113. The requirement of submission of PIF was not strictly complied in two (2) 
campuses, CALABARZON Region Campus (CBZRC) and Central Mindanao Campus 

(CMC), as basis for the assessment of general insurance coverage over all insurable assets, 

properties and interests of the government with the General Insurance Fund (GIF) of the 

Government Service Insurance System (GSIS), contrary to COA Circular No. 2018-002 

dated May 31, 2018. For CBZRC, the non-preparation and submission of the PIF to the 

Audit Team was due to pending application of insurance coverage of buildings and other 

properties with the GSIS while CMC Management was not familiar with the above-

mentioned circular on the submission of PIF.  

 

114. The non-submission of the prescribed PIF precluded the Audit Teams thereat from 
evaluating the completeness of assets insured vis-a-vis the adequacy of insurance coverage. 

 

b. Uninsured PPE 
 

115. Insurable assets of CBZRC with total carrying amount of P592,618,321.76 
representing 99.13 percent of the total PPE (excluding Construction in Progress-Building 

and Other Structures) were not insured with GSIS contrary to Section 5 of Republic Act 

(R.A.) No. 656, otherwise known as Property Insurance Law, thus, exposes the government 

to the risk of not being indemnified for any damage to or loss of its assets due to fire, 

earthquake, typhoon/flood, or other casualty. 

 

116. CBZRC Management submitted a letter to GSIS for insurance coverage of its 
property, excluding two (2) property/buildings and GSIS had already conducted the 

inspection. Nevertheless, Management immediately requested for insurance coverage of 

said property, however, the GSIS Office had not yet responded. 

 

117. We recommended and Management of the CBZRC and CMC agreed to enjoin 
their respective Chiefs of Finance and Administrative Division to require their Supply 

Property Unit Officer to: 

 



66 
  

a. prepare and submit the required PIF to the Audit Team and the GIF of 
the GSIS not later than April 30 of each year  to validate the completeness 

and adequacy of the existing insurance coverage; and  

 

b. ensure that all properties of the CBZRC are insured with the GIF of the 
GSIS to protect the same against loss or damage and in case of loss or 

destruction, the Campus can at least recover the costs of its assets. 

 

c. Undisposed unserviceable property 
 

118. As at December 31, 2020, the unserviceable property of SOCCSKSARGEN 
Region Campus (SRC) consisting of semi-expendable property and other machinery 

equipment in the total amount of ₱355,367.42, remained undisposed despite of the 

approved authority to dispose from COA, thus, exposing to further deterioration and 

decreasing their realizable value. 

 
Table 17. Undisposed Unserviceable Property Decreased Value 

Type of PPE No. of Units Total Cost Appraised Value 

Semi-Expendable Property 28 322,377.42 24,123.65 

Other Machinery and Equipment 1 32,990.00 19,351.35 

Total 29 355,367.42 43,475.00 

 

119. We recommended and Management of SRC agreed to require: 
 

a) the Disposal Committee the immediate sale/disposal or condemnation of 
the unserviceable property in accordance with the existing rules and 

regulations to avoid further deterioration and loss of resale value; and 

 

b) the Accounting Division and Property Unit to analyze and identify the 
unserviceable property in their respective records using the latest available 

RPCPPE and IIRUP. 

 

120.  SRC Management commented that the Request for Quotations (RFQs) were 
already sent to potential buyers on November 3, 2020; however, no responses were 

received yet to date. An immediate action of Management is to verify the salvage value of 

the items to hasten the disposal process. 

 

d. No notification of the lost property 
 

121. The Accountable Officer in the Central Visayas Campus (CVisC) failed to 
notify or report to the concerned officials lost property amounting to P79,950.00 and 

likewise failed to file with the Office of the Auditor a request for relief from property 

accountability, contrary to Section 41, Chapter 10 of the Government Accounting 

Manual (GAM), Volume I. 

 



67 
  

122. The accounting policies on the lost property under Section 41 of GAM Volume 1 
provides that when a loss of property occurs due to fire, theft or other casualty/force 

majeure, the officer accountable shall immediately notify the Auditor concerned and file 

relief from property accountability with all the available supporting evidence/ documents 

within thirty days.  

 

123. Appendix 75, Report of Lost, Stolen, Damaged, Destroyed Property (RLSDDP) 
prescribes this form to be used by the Accountable Officer to report or notify the Auditor 

of the COA, the Chief Accountant and all other concerned of the lost, stolen, damaged or 

destroyed property. 

 

124. Validation by the Audit Team of the Other Asset account revealed that one (1) unit 
of Laptop/Notebook Compaq amounting to P79,950.00 was lost and reported its existence 

in the RPCPPE instead of its loss in the Report of Lost, Stolen, Damaged or Destroyed 

Property (RLSDDP), contrary to the mentioned rulings. The inclusion of a lost property in 

the RPCPPE affects the reliability of Management’s inventory procedures and the report 

itself.  The non-reporting of the lost property to the concerned/relevant parties restrained 

the Audit Team of the prompt inspection and validation/investigation of the circumstances 

surrounding the loss of property that occurred, determination of persons liable/accountable 

for the lost property and non-derecognition of the lost PPE in the books. 

 

125. We recommended and CVisC Management agreed to require the officer 
accountable for the lost property to file a request for relief from accountability with 

all available evidence/documents together with a copy of the RLSDDP.   

 

e. Non-implementation of guidelines in the proper use of government vehicles 
 

126. One (1) of the three (3) government-owned vehicles of the Central Mindanao 
Campus (CMC) was without the necessary government plate number and was provided 

with gasoline and other needs, contrary to COA Circular No. 75-6 dated November 7, 1975 

and Administrative Order No. 239 s. 2008, which might put the interest of the government 

in jeopardy. Management explained that the motor vehicle red plate was not available from 

LTO due to the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. 

 

127. We recommended and CMC Management agreed to require its General 
Service Unit to comply with the requirements of law on the proper use of government 

vehicles so that fuel, lubricants and repairs will be authorized to be provided for these 

vehicles. 
 

Donated lots not covered with TCT  

 

128. Land donated to the Central Visayas Campus (CVisC) and Zamboanga 
Region Campus has yet to be titled/patented to assert/claim ownership over it. 

Moreover, information related thereto was not disclosed in the Notes to Financial 

Statements of the CVisC, which is inconsistent with Section 48, Chapter 10 of the 

GAM, Volume I. 



68 
  

 

129. Section 56, Chapter VI of Act No. 926, an Act prescribing rules and regulations 
governing the homesteading, selling and leasing of portions of the public domain of the 

Philippine Islands, provides that “Any person or persona, or their legal representatives or 

successors in right, claiming any land or interest in lands in the Philippines under the  

provisions of this chapter, and who now desire or claim the right to have such title         

perfected must in every case present an application in writing to the Court of Land 

Registration praying that the validity of the alleged title or claim be inquired into and that 

a certificate of title issue to then under the provisions of the Land Registration Act for the 

lands claimed.” 

 

130. Chapter 10, Section 48 of the GAM, Volume I, addresses Financial Reporting of 
Property Plant and Equipment, to wit: 

 

Sec. 48 Disclosures. The financial statements shall have the following PPE 

disclosures: 

 

a. Xxx 
b. Xxx 
c.  The Financial Statements shall also disclose for each class of PPE 

recognized in the financial statements: 

1. The existence and amounts of restrictions on title, and PPE pledged as 
securities for liabilities;  

2. The amount of expenditures recognized in the carrying amount of an item 
of PPE in the course of its construction; 

3.  Xxx 
 

  Central Visayas Campus (CVisC)  
 

131. CVisC has not yet secured the title of the three (3) donated lots by the Municipality 
of Argao with total measurement of 52,216 square meters amounting to P1,612,480.00 due 

to existing encumbrances as follows: 

 
Table 18.  Summary of CVisC Lots with Encumbrances 

Lot No. Particulars / Encumbrance 

Lot 4999 Has a previous approved plan (CSD-070020031 of lot 4999, PLS 1057- D) 
which needs to be cancelled before the application of new plan can proceed. 

Lot 4212-A Protest of Free Patent Application (F.P.A for brevity) No. 072205-95, of 
Mario I. Cabahug, over lot 4212, Pls. 1957-D claiming ownership by virtue 
of Donation. The School is awaiting the Issuance of Order for final 
Judgement. 

Lot 4229 No Original copy of the Title. The Campus is still in the process of Securing 
the Original Copy of Title through Reconstitution which will take 9 months to 
a year. 

  



69 
  

132. The Campus was required to transfer the Certificate of Title to Philippine Science 
High School System from the former, Department of Science and Technology (DOST) 

Philippine Science High School Central Visayas Campus pursuant to Memorandum No. 

074 issued by the PSHS Office of Executive Director dated April 25, 2019. 

 

133. Moreover, no information related on the three (3) lots’ encumbrances was disclosed 
in its Financial Statements which is not compliant with Sec. 48, Chapter 10 of the GAM 

Volume 1, requiring the disclosure of the existence and any restrictions, disclosures that 

may influence the decision making of the financial statement users. 

 

134. We recommended and CVisC Management agreed to require its Accountant 
to disclose in the Notes to Financial Statements the actual status of the Land account, 

which includes the existing encumbrances and pending legal actions. If future costs 

can be estimated, such estimate should also be properly disclosed. 

 

135. CVisC Management commented that they are taking gradual action to facilitate the 
processing of the requirements for the transfer of title such as the original TCT, Certificate 

Authorizing Registration (CAR) from the BIR, and Clearance from the Department of 

Agrarian Reform (DAR). 

 

 Zamboanga Peninsula Region Campus (ZRC) 
 

136. The title of the second lot donated by the City Government of Dipolog where the 
Dormitory Building III costing ₱14,666,326.72 is currently constructed was not yet 

transferred in the name of the PSHS-ZRC.  

  

137. Of the two (2) lots noted in the previous audit report to be in the name of PSHS-
ZRC, only the first/front lot is in the name of PSHS-ZRC while the second/back lot is still 

not in its name thus this reiteration.  

 

138.  A TCT is required before a building permit will be issued and it serves as the legal 
proof of ownership of the agency on the lot donated by the City Government of Dipolog. 

In its absence, problems on rightful ownership will arise for structures constructed on the 

said lots. 

 

139. This observation was noted in the previous year’s audit. 
 

140. We reiterated our recommendations and PSHS-ZRC Management agreed to 
exert extra effort to follow up with the concerned government agencies the issuance 

of the pertinent TCTs in the name of the PSHS-ZRC, and have the deed of donation 

annotated in the mother title of donated lots. 
 

Fund Utilization 

 

141.  The MIMAROPA Region Campus (MRC) reported/registered a low fund 
utilization rate of only 57.46 percent due to, among others, the delayed procurement 



70 
  

process both in goods and infrastructure projects, and the completion of the projects, 

thus, depriving the end-users of the immediate benefits that could have been derived 

from the timely delivery thereof. 

 

142. The MRC Management had obligated 91.10 percent of its total current year 
allotment of P107,840,141.57, however, it incurred a low disbursement rate of only 57.46 

percent or P56,455,629.18 out of the obligated amount of P98,246,366.16. The delay in the 

procurement process both in goods and infrastructure projects was one of the causes of its 

low utilization of funds, thus, the delay in the completion of the projects and deprived the 

end-users of the immediate benefits that could have been derived from the timely delivery 

thereof. Moreover, due to COVID-19 pandemic, the budget for SY 2020-2021 were not  

utilized: 

 

a. Scholarship - no face to face mode of teaching, hence the budget for most of 
their activities were not utilized for August-December 2020. Also, scholars 

were categorized for their stipend, thus the allotted for full scholarship were 

reduced. 

 

b. Travel & Training - Travel outside the province for training/seminar is 
restricted due the pandemic therefore travel and training were lessened. 

 

c. Utilities – electric consumption was reduced due to unoccupied dorm facilities, 
limited usage hours/months of aircon in offices.  

 

d. CO Equipment - difficulty in having a successful bid as most of the interested 
bidders of PSHS-MRC are from outside of the province and suppliers for highly 

TSE were adamant to bid due to additional cost that will be incurred for the 

delivery and installation. 
 

143. We recommended and MRC Management agreed to: 
 

a. develop strategies/measures on how to optimize fund utilization to prevent 
the eventual reversion of unexpended allotments, despite all challenges of 

the pandemic situation; and 
 

b. exert more efforts to implement early procurement activities on goods and 
infrastructure projects as allowed by the DBM. 

 

Insufficient Obligation Allotted 

 

144. Contract cost for the unfinished portion of the Cordillera Autonomous Region 
Campus (CARC) project exceeded the balance of obligations allotted for the project 

by P293,856.51. 
 

145. Section 46, Subtitle B, Title I, Book V of the Administrative Code of 1987 provides 
that no contract involving the expenditure of public funds shall be entered into unless there 



71 
  

is an appropriation therefor, the unexpended balance of which, free of other obligations, is 

sufficient to cover the proposed expenditure. 

 

146. CARC Management entered into a contract for the Completion of Academic 
Building 1 Phase 3 project funded and obligated in the amount of P19,226,214.86. Due to 

the termination of the contracts with the two (2) contractors, Management entered into a 

third contract amounting to P6,757,391.20 in December 2019 for the unfinished portion of 

the project and implementation of which was extended to 2020. However, contract cost 

exceeded the amount of available unutilized obligation of P6,463,534.69 by P293,856.51 

after the termination of two (2) contracts due to Accounting Unit’s lack of awareness on 

the allotment balance which resulted in overdraft of allotment, contrary to the above-cited 

provisions. 

 

147. We recommended and CARC Management agreed to require the Budget 
Officer to prepare/submit realignment advice documents for the additional funds 

needed for the excess/overdraft in obligations; otherwise, adjust the scope of works in 

the contract to correspond to the available balance of unutilized allotment/obligation 

for the project.  

 

Inconsistency of information in the Budget and Financial Accountability Reports 

 

148.    There were disparities noted in the information reported in various forms of 
the PSHSS Consolidated Budget and Financial Accountability Reports which are not 

in keeping with the objective of providing more details for clarity and consistency in 

information being reported under COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2019-1 dated 

January 1, 2019. 

 

149. COA-DBM Joint Circular  (JC) No. 2019-1 dated January 1, 2019 provides the 
updated guidelines relative to budget and financial accountability reports (BFARs) starting 

FY 2019, among others: 

   

 XXX 

Section 4.0 Guideline 

  xxx 

4.3  Department/Agencies/OUs shall accomplish and submit BFARs 

to COA, DBM and to BTr, as applicable through the URS, in

a. effects of adjustment/reclassification of expenditures from current 
appropriation to the continuing appropriations or prior obligation (no space 

allotted to adjust error made), 

b. cancellation/replacement of check within the month it was issued 
c. cancellation/replacement of check issued month/s after it was originally

b. FAR No. 3 vs. Financial Statements Current Payables – Unreconciled Obligations 
 

154. Aging of Unpaid Obligations (FAR No.3) as at December 31, 2020 showed an 
unpaid Obligations totalling to P177,443,417.98. 

 

155. Instruction No. 2 in filling-up FAR No. 3 (Aging of Unpaid Obligations) of the 
same JC states that: 

 

“2. Columns 1 to 12 shall reflect the following information 

 

Column 1– Particulars indicating source of funds and the name of the 

creditors broken down into Due and Demandable 

Obligations and Not Yet Due and Demandable Obligations, 

Current Year’s Appropriations and Prior Years’ 

Appropriations 

  

Due and Demandable Obligations (Accounts Payable) - 

Obligations of NGAs’ COs/ROs/OUs and GOCCs maintaining 

SAGF for which goods, services, and projects have been delivered, 

rendered, completed and/or accepted regardless of the year when 

these obligations were incurred (i.e., current year or previous 

years). (Underscoring ours) 

 

Not Yet Due and Demandable Obligations –Obligations of NGA 

COs/ROs/OUs and GOCCs maintaining SAGF, charged against 

current year and prior years’ budget for which goods, services and 

projects are not yet delivered, rendered, completed and/or 

accepted year. ” 

 

156. Likewise, Section 2, Chapter 3, Volume I of the GAM for the National Government 
Agencies (NGAs) defines Obligation as an act of a duly authorized official which binds 

the government to the immediate or eventual payment of a sum of money. Obligation 

maybe referred to as a commitment that encompasses possible future liabilities based on 

current contractual agreement. 

 

157. Further, Section 2, Chapter 6, Volume I of the GAM defines Accounts Payable as 
a valid and legal obligations of NGAs/OUs, for which, goods/services/projects have been 

delivered/rendered/completed and accepted, regardless of the year when these obligations 

were incurred. 

 

158. A review of the Due and Demandable column of FAR 3 and the current payables 
presented in the Statement of Financial Position of the PSHSS revealed that their balances 

did not tally as at December 31, 2020, to wit:

TOTAL 121,938,022.72 60,407,218.52 61,530,804.20 

 

159. The above differences cast doubt on the validity of the payable accounts reported 
in the Financial Statements and the Due and Demandable Obligations balances reported in 

the Financial Accountability Reports (related observations in paragraph no. 36-42). 

 

c. FAR No. 1A vs. FAR No. 3 – Unreconciled Obligation 
 

160. Summary of Appropriation, Allotment, Obligations, Disbursements and Balances 
by Object of Expenditures (FAR No. 1A) as at December 31, 2020 showed an unpaid 

Obligation amounting to P412,540,607.22 which does not reconcile with the unpaid 

obligation reflected on the Aging of Unpaid Obligation – Current (FAR No. 3) amounting 

to P360,217,331.27 of the even date. 

 
Table 15.  FAR No.  1-A vs. FAR No. 3

Total 412,540,607.22 360,217,331.27 52,323,275.95 

 

161. Further, the required submission of FARs was not timely observed contrary with 
the above-cited JC. 

 

162. The above deficiencies defeated the objectives of the Joint Circular, that is: to 
generate quality and adequate information to enable the DBM and the COA, as oversight 

agencies, to effectively report, monitor and/or evaluate agency performance as basis for 

sound policy decisions, in a timely manner. 

 

163. We recommended and Management agreed to enjoin the concerned Campus 
Directors to require their respective Accountants and Budget Officers to reconcile the 

amounts reported in various forms for clarity to ensure reliability, accuracy and 

consistency of information.  
 



76 
  

164. Management explained that they are aware of the discrepancies in information 
reported in various FAR forms and that the System’s Accountant has identified the reasons 

for this. They are still in the process of determining these discrepancies and improving the 

process of matching disbursements against obligation. 

 

  

Uncollected overdue receivables 

  

165. Outstanding receivables of two (2) Campuses amounting to ₱4,937,309.28 
from scholars who did not enroll in Science and Technology courses in college 

remained uncollected for more than three (3) years, thus, depriving the government 

of additional funds that could have been utilized to finance other priority programs 

and projects. 

 

166. The Scholarship Agreement between PSHS and the Scholar Awardee provides the 
responsibilities and obligations of scholars. One of which is to enroll in a degree or course 

in the field of science and technology in any university after the completion of the PSHS 

curriculum, as may be previously identified by the PSHS Board of Trustees. In case of 

breach of the said agreement, the Scholar Awardee and his/her parents/guardian shall 

jointly and solidarily reimburse PSHS the monetary value of the Scholarship Award based 

on the rates approved by the PSHS Board of Trustees. 

 

167. As of December 31, 2020, the reported Other Receivables account of Ilocos Region 
Campus (IRC) and Western Visayas Campus (WVC) amounting to P385,309.28 and 

₱4,552,000.00, respectively, represents the unpaid amount that remained to be collected 

from the six (6) and 39 defaulting scholars of IRC and WVC, respectively, who breached 

the Agreement by not enrolling in Science and Technology courses in college. For IRC, 

these receivables are now aged more than five (5) years while more than three (3) years for 

WVC, from the point of recognition in CYs 2013-2015.  

 

168. In the past five (5) years, the low collection of only 3.02% from IRC’s receivables 
caused these to be long overdue due to inadequacy of additional measures and imposition 

of legal actions to recover such receivables. 

 

169. On the other hand, the decrease in the WVC’s Other Receivable account balance, 
from the previous years of P5,814,200.00 to P4,552,000.00 by 18.37 percent or 

P1,068,000.00, was attributed to the consideration given to those defaulting scholars who 

later on pursued Science and Technology-related course, and total collections of 

P194,000.00 or 3.34% by year-end. 

 

170. WVC Management had already communicated this issue with the Legal Office of 
the PSHS System and sought their assistance through their Legal Counsel. Letters were 

also sent to the concerned defaulting scholars and/or their parents/guardians. Aside from 

this, no other actions were taken by the Management. 

 



77 
  

171. The uncollected overdue receivables deprived the government of funds that could 
have been used to finance the scholarships of those who are willing to pursue science and 

technology courses or otherwise be utilized for other government priority programs and 

projects. 

 

172. We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 

a) continue the collection of receivables through persistent follow-ups with 
the scholars/parents/guardians; and 

 

b) in case of failure of the concerned scholars and/or their parents/                            
guardians to settle the obligation, communicate with the Legal                  

Counsel and discuss other legal remedies, which may be pursued to                    

recover the monetary value of the scholarship due to breach of                           

agreement. 

   

Irregular/Excessive/Unconscionable Expenditures 

 

173. The four (4) PSHSS offices showed cases considered to be 
irregular/excessive/uneconomical expenditures of at least P9,162,866.22 due to either 

non-conformity with existing rules and regulations, and erroneous computations. 

 

174. COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012 prescribes the updated 
guidelines for the prevention and disallowance of irregular, unnecessary, excessive, 

extravagant and unconscionable expenditures (IUEEU), wherein list of situational cases 

were enumerated and defined irregular, excessive and unconscionable expenditure, as 

follows:  

 

 Irregular expenditures are those incurred contrary to established rules, regulations, 
procedural guideline, policies, principles or practices that have gained recognition 

in laws. 

 

 Excessive expenditures are unreasonable expenses incurred at an immoderate 
quantity or exorbitant price and expenses that exceed what is usual or proper.  

 

 Unconscionable expenditures are those unreasonable and immoderate expenses.  
  

175. For CY 2020, disbursements of irregular, excessive and unconscionable 
expenditures were noted in the PSHS System, summarized as follows:

Total 9,162,866.22  
*Covering the period January to September 2020 only. 

176. The granting of hazard allowance to Science and Technology (S&T) personnel 
during Work from Home arrangement was clarified by the Civil Service Commission and 

the Department of Budget and Management that the home is not considered as work 

station/area contemplated under the law on entitlement to HA although home is an 

alternative work station during work from home.   

 

177. Management of OED and MC asserted that their computation of HA was based on 
the number of days of exposure with reference to the table given in Section 9.2 of the JC, 

wherein the table already considered the number of days of actual exposure in determining 

the rate of the hazard pay applicable. The formula used was simple and straightforward 

computation as provided under the JC. 

 

178. The Audit Team of OED and MC stand by its observation that the computation of 
Hazard Pay granted to PSHS-OED and MC personnel is not in accordance with the cited 

Joint Circular which provides: 

 

 Item 9.2 of the JC states that “The Hazard Allowance for a month shall be based 

on the degree of risk to hazards, as specified in sub-items 9.1.1 and 9.1.2. above, 

and the number of workdays of actual exposure over 22 days in a month, at rates 

not to exceed 30% of monthly basic salary.”  (Underscoring ours)  

  

179. Additionally, Section 9 of the same JC stipulates that “xxx As a general 
compensation policy, and in line with Section 7(c) of R.A. No. 8439, S & T Personnel whose 

nature of duties and responsibilities, actual services, and location of work expose them to 

great danger, occupational risks, perils to life, and physical hardships, may be granted 



79 
  

Hazard Allowance, but only during periods of actual exposure to hazards and 

hardships.”  

 

180. Prior to the issuance of the JC No.1, series of 2013, S & T personnel were entitled 
to hazard allowance regardless of the number of days of exposure. It was in the issuance 

of said JC, s.2013 that prescribed the basis of hazard allowance which is the degree/level 

of risk and the number of workdays of actual exposure over 22 workdays in a month.  

 

181. For the CLC, the Audit Team thereat observed the recurring deficiencies in the 
payment of longevity pay (LP) to Campus personnel the computation of which using the 

cumulative rates and latest salary received prior to the effectivity of DBM-DOST Joint 

Circular No. 1 series of 2013, run inconsistent with Section 9.1 and 13.2 of the IRR of RA 

8439, thus, irregular and excessive expenditures of the longevity pay benefit due to 

erroneous computation.  

 

182. On the other hand, for Ilocos Region Campus (IRC), applying cost-benefit analysis, 
the cost of maintenance of outmoded and fully depreciated motor vehicle outweighed the 

benefits derived as more resources of the agency are needed to maintain its upkeep, hence, 

unconscionable/uneconomical as defined under COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 

29, 2012 and Section 9.1.3 of DBM-NBC No. 446 Series of 1995. The IRC Management 

acknowledged incurrence of excessive repairs and maintenance cost. 

 

183. We recommended and Management agreed to enjoin its concerned Campus 
Directors to: 

 

a) cause the refund of the irregular/excessive expenditures; 
 

b) consider the disposal of the outmoded and fully depreciated vehicle and the 
procurement of a new vehicle to replace the disposed unit (IRC); and  

 

c) ensure compliance with rules, regulations, procedural guidelines, policies, 
principles or practices in every disbursement transaction to avoid 

disallowance in audit.   

 

Delayed/Non-submission of financial reports and transaction documents 

 

184. Delayed/non-submission of required financial reports and other transaction 
documents, contrary to existing rules and regulations, hampered the timely audit of 

accounts/transactions and communication of audit results to Management. 

 

185. We have noted delays/non-submission of the financial reports by different region 
Campuses to their respective auditors, to wit:

186. Failure of Management to adhere to the timely submission of financial reports and 
transaction documents affected the timeliness of audit, analysis and evaluation of 

accounts/transactions/projects and reporting of audit results.   

 

187. We recommended and Management agreed to require the concerned Campus 
Accountable/Responsible Officers and Accountants to: 

 

a) submit all the unsubmitted required financial reports, and transaction 
documents to the Office of the Auditor;  

 

b) adopt strategies to fast-track the processing of documents and monitor the

documents constantly under the new normal set-up of alternative work 

arrangements of personnel;  

 

c) monitor the submission of the List of all ‘on-going’ and ‘to be implemented’

e) ensure the submission thereof within the period prescribed by existing rules 
and regulations (CVC, CBZRC, WVC, EVC, CMC, CRC). 

 

Non-compliance with the Authorized Deductions 

 

188. Personal obligations with the Cebu CFI Community Cooperative were 
deducted from the employees’ salaries and allowances of PSHS EVC as payment for 

their personal loans, contrary to Section 47 of the General Provisions of RA 11465. 

 

189. Employees of PSHS EVC allowed payroll deductions from their salaries 
subsistence allowance and laundry allowance for their installment payments of their 

personal obligations to Cebu CFI Community Cooperative based on an existing 

Memorandum of Agreement dated June 21, 2005. This payroll deductions cannot be 



82 
  

categorized as an authorized deductions cited under the General Provisions of Republic 

Act (R.A.) 11465, also known as the General Appropriations Act (GAA) for CY 2020 that 

made the EVC a collecting agent of CFI, and the reduced take home pay is disadvantageous 

to the employees’ interest. 

 

190. We recommended and EVC Management agreed to immediately stop the 
practice of deducting the employees’ CFI loan payments from their salaries and other 

personnel benefits. 

 

Disaster Risk Related Activities 

 

191. Unauthorized funds from PSHS CLC regular budget were allocated for 
COVID-19 response, contrary to paragraph 3 of Section 3.2 of GPPB Circular No. 

01-2020 and Section 4.1 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445. Likewise, 

disbursements of COVID-19 related expenditures lacked the documentary 

requirements, contrary to paragraph 6, Section 4 of PD 1445. 

 

192. Paragraph 3, Section 3.2 of GPPB Circular No. 01-2020 provides that a document 
or certification from the budget officer or equivalent position showing that there is a budget 

for the purpose be executed and likewise approved by the Head of the Agency. 

 

193. Section 4.1 of PD 1445 provides that “no money shall be paid out of any public 
treasury or depository except in pursuance of an appropriation law or other specific 

statutory authority.” 

 

194. Funds for the Covid-19 response was sourced from regular budget of CLC without 
proper authorization of funds realignment contrary to afore-cited GPPB Circular and that 

no proof that the Supplemental Annual Procurement Plan was submitted/posted in the 

GPPB online portal nor uploaded to its website for transparency; thus considered irregular 

and subject transactions may be suspended and or disallowed in audit. 

 

195. Likewise, 23 out of the 27 DVs for the COVID-19 Response lacked the necessary 
documentary requirements for which the validity, legality and propriety of the 

disbursement could not be ascertained. 

 

196. We recommended and CLC Management agreed to: 
 

a) require the Accountant and/or Budget Officer submission of the 
documentary requirements on the funds realignment for COVID-19 

response purposes; and 

 

b) require the Accountant to submit the necessary documentary 
requirements and ensure the completeness of supporting documents in 

every claim/disbursement transaction.  

 

 



83 
  

 

Non–observance of the Procurement Law (RA 9184) and its Revised IRR

Other Compliance Issues 

 

Gender and Development (GAD)  

 

200. The PSHSS was able to formulate GAD Plan and Budget and attributed the 
Scholarship Program to GAD and other gender-related activities with total funds 

allocated of at least P316,512,727.00 and spent P340,844,046.26 in compliance with 

GAA CY 2020. 

 

201. Section 31 of the General Appropriations Act (GAA) for Fiscal Year 2020 (RA 
11465), among others, that  requires that all agencies of the government formulate a GAD 

Plan designed to address gender issues within their concerned sectors or mandate and 

allocate at least five percent (5%) of their budget. 

 

202.  Moreover, Rule VI, Section 7 of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of the 
Magna Carta for Women, also required that this GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular 

activities of the agencies, which shall be at least 5% of their budgetary appropriation: 

 

203. For CY 2020, the PSHSS OED and Campuses had implemented the GAD activities, 
with an aggregate allocation and expenditures of ₱316,512,727.00 and P340,844,046.26, 

respectively, to address PSHSS Campuses identified gender issues and concerns of the 

clientele and organization.  

 

204. PSHS OED and Campuses’ allocations and expenditures incurred to address gender

205. In CVisC, out of the 24 proposed GAD activities, almost all 14 actual activities 
were not in accordance with the original GAD Plan, thus, a revised plan and budget 

inclusive of COVID-19 pandemic measures as required by PCW. Seven (7) out of the 14  

or 50% of the actual activities were dedicated to the response and assistance to COVID-19 

pandemic 

 

206. For MRC, the GAD Focal Person gathered and used erroneous total appropriation 
as basis of GAD Plan and Budget (GPB), which represents the balance of unexpended 

allotment during the first quarter 2020, thus limited activities were included in the GAD 

plans. The PCW-endorsed GPB for the year 2020 was not yet received by Management 

thus there was no yardstick in evaluating the accomplishments and that there is less 

assurance that the desired levels of consciousness in support of gender and development, 

women’s empowerment and response to gender issues were fully achieved 

 

207. In EVC, given that there were some activities in the FY 2020 GPB remained not 
implemented due to the COVID-19 circumstances, the accomplishments is 12.22% of the 

appropriation, more than the 5% GAD budget floor which is noteworthy  Likewise, in 

SMC, GAD programs were not fully implemented due to the pandemic and discontinuance 

of some activities.  

 

208. The ZRC GPB was submitted to the PSHS Main Office for inclusion in the System-
wide report and approval by PCW. 

 

209. We commended Management’s effort to attribute GAD-related activities in its 
regular programs and activities despite the challenges brought by the COVID-19 

pandemic. On the other hand, we recommended  and Management agreed to: 

 



90 
  

a) continue to commit an allocation of at least five percent (5%) of its annual 
appropriation for GAD-related activities and integrate/mainstream its 

GAD activities into its regular planning and budgeting; 

 

b) ensure submission of GPB and GAR for 2020 duly endorsed by the PCW, 
indicated therein among others, each gender issue that would serve as 

yardstick in evaluating the GAR; and 

 

c) direct the GAD Focal Point System and/or PSHSS officials concerned to 
strengthen its initiatives to accomplish the identified GAD activities. 

 

Implementation of Senior Citizen and Persons with Disability Program 

 

210. The PHSS had implemented projects and activities that addressed the needs 
of senior citizens and persons with disability in compliance with Section 32 of the 

GAA, FY 2020. 

 

211. Section 32 General Provision of the General Appropriation Act of 2020  (R.A. 
11465) requires that “All agencies of the government shall formulate plans, programs and 

projects intended to address the concerns of the senior citizens and the persons with 

disability, insofar as it relates to their mandated functions, integrate the same in their 

regular activities. Moreover, all government infrastructures and facilities shall provide 

architectural or structural provide architectural or structural design or facilities that will 

reasonably enhance the mobility, safety and welfare of persons with disability pursuant to 

Batas Pambansa Blg. 344 and RA 7277.” 

 

212. For 2020, the PSHSS reported P4,729,915.00 budget and P3,159,267.98 or 66.79% 
was expended for its implementation.  The agency implemented activities/projects to care, 

share, address issues and concerns of senior citizens and differently-abled persons such as 

Orientation on benefits and privileges of Senior Webinar on mental health to students and 

their parents/guardians, New Gender Roles and Mental Health Care in the New Normal, 

provision for access ramps within the Campus buildings as well as comfort room for them 

to enhance their mobility and safety. 
 

213. We recommended and Management agreed to continue to allocate budget for 
the formulation and implementation of plans/programs and activities which will cater 

to the needs of the senior citizens and the differently-abled persons pursuant to the 

GAA. 
 

Compliance with other Mandatory Accounts 

 

214. Shown below are the status of compliance by PSHS System with pertinent tax laws, 
deductions and remittances of premiums/contributions and loan installments for the GSIS,

Equipment reported to GSIS for insurance cannot be determined due to non-preparation of 

the agency of the PIF as required under COA Circular No. 2018-002. 

 

225. For CBZRC, PPE amounting to P592,618,321.76 net of accumulated depreciation

226. For EVC, properties with carrying amount of P33,542,137.81 were not covered by 
property insurance due to lack of funds contrary to RA No. 656, as amended by PD No. 

245, thereby, exposing these assets to unmitigated risk from natural and man-made hazards. 

 

227. For the unremitted prior years’ balances, we recommended and Management 
agreed to require the concerned Campus Accountants to exert efforts to locate the 

documents/records; and review, analyze and reconcile the account and remit the 

balances, if warranted.  

 

228. We also recommended and Management agreed to continue its efforts to 
comply with RA 656 or the Property Insurance Law. For EVC uninsured PPE, we 

recommended and Management agreed to propose an adequate amount in the annual 

budget for the ensuing years to cover all PPEs of the agency.
