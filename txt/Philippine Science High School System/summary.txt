EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

 
A. Introduction 

 

The Philippine Science High School System (PSHSS), operating under one 

system of governance and management, provides scholarship to students with high 

aptitude in science and mathematics with the purpose of preparing them for careers 

in Science and Technology (S&T) in order for them to contribute to nation building 

by helping the country attain a critical mass of professionals and leaders in S&T. It 

was created by RA No. 8496 enacted on February 12, 1998, as amended by RA No. 

9036 dated March 12, 2001, otherwise known as the Philippine Science High 

School System (PSHSS) Act of 1997. This law ensures that every region is given an 

equal opportunity to benefit from the establishment of the PSHSS and integrates the 

operation of 16 PSHS campuses located in various regions.  The regional campuses 

are as follows: 

 

1. Main Campus (MC) 
2. Ilocos Regional Campus  (IRC) 
3. Cordillera Administrative Region Campus (CARC) 
4. Cagayan Valley Campus (CVC) 
5. Central Luzon Campus (CLC) 
6. CALABARZON Regional Campus (CBZRC) 
7. MIMAROPA Regional Campus (MRC) 
8. Bicol Region Campus (BRC) 
9. Central Visayas Campus (CVisC) 
10. Western Visayas Campus (WVC) 
11. Eastern Visayas Campus (EVC) 
12. Central Mindanao Campus (CMC) 
13. Southern Mindanao Campus (SMC) 
14. Zamboanga Peninsula Region Campus (ZRC) 
15. SOCCSKSARGEN Region Campus (SRC) 
16. Caraga Region Campus (CRC) 

 

Under the administrative supervision of the Department of Science and 

Technology (DOST), the PSHSS is governed by a Board of Trustees (BOT) 

composed of the Chairman, Vice-Chairman and 10 members, which includes the 

PSHS System Executive Director who, in turn, coordinates the implementation of 

policies and guidelines set by the BOT and articulates to the Board the mutual 

concern of all the 16 PSHS campuses operating under the PSHS System. 

 

Of the approved plantilla of 1,504, the PSHSS’ operation is complemented 

with total teaching and non-teaching personnel of 1,631 in which 1,294 were 

permanent/plantilla positions augmented by 337 job orders (JO)/contractual 

personnel hired in CY 2020, detailed as follows:
