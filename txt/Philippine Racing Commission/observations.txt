OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

 

A. Financial and Compliance 
 

Unreliable Balance of Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, Trust and Special Account 

 

1. A total of P70,764,503.98 unmatched balances of accounts Cash-Treasury/Agency 
Deposit, Trust and Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, Special Account was noted 

between the PhilRaCom and the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr), casting doubt on 

the completeness and accuracy of the recorded transactions; hence, could not be 

relied upon. 

 

As described in the Revised Chart of Accounts (RCA) (Updated 2019), Volume 

III of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), the Cash-Treasury/Agency 

Deposit, Trust is debited to recognize the trust receipts/collections and trust funds 

remitted to the BTr and adjustments for lapsed NCA and credited to recognize receipt 

of NCA and upon closing of the trust account. In the BTr books, it is credited for 

remittance made by NGAs for trust receipts/collections and trust funds and debited for 

replenishments of agencies’ negotiated checks charged to MDS-Trust Accounts. 

 

While the Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, Special Account is debited in the 

agency books to recognize the amount of collections remitted to the BTr under the 

Special Account in the General Fund (SAGF), and credited to recognize receipt of 

Notice of Cash Allocation (NCA) and upon closing of the SAGF. In the BTr books, the 

account is credited for remittance made by NGAs for SAGF and debited for 

replenishments of agencies’ negotiated checks charged to respective MDS- Special 

account. As such, the agency’s records for said accounts should always reconcile with 

that of the BTr. 

 

As at December 31, 2020, the agency’s Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, Trust 

and Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, Special Account amounted to P86,316,205.25 and 

P0.00, respectively. 

 

Confirmation letters were sent to the BTr on March 23, 2021 to validate the 

balances of the accounts as at December 31, 2020, however, the confirmed balances 

showed a difference aggregating P70,764,503.98, details of which are shown below:

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to 

coordinate with the BTr for the reconciliation of the balances of Cash-

Treasury/Agency Deposits in the books of PhilRaCom and BTr. 

 

 

Discrepancy balance of account Due from NGAs-PS-DBM and PS-DBM records 

 

2. A total of P326,174.50 discrepancy between the Due from NGAs-PS-DBM account 
balance and its corresponding receivable account balance at the PS-DBM due to 

unreconciled prior year balances of the intra government accounts.  

 

Republic Act (RA) No. 9184, otherwise known as the Government Procurement 

Reform Act, provides, among others, that all government agencies are directed to 

procure common-use supplies from the PS-DBM. 

 

Verification showed that the agency may not totally procure all its common-use 

supplies from the PS-DBM but, and in line with this national policy, the agency partly 

procures its common-use supplies from the PS-DBM in line with the national policy 

that procurement of government supplies by government agencies shall be through the 

PS-DBM. 

 

Verification showed that for the CY 2020, the agency partly procured its 

common-use supplies from the PS-DBM amounting to P152,495.97, where only 

P94,695.02 were delivered during the year.  As at December 31, 2020, the account Due 

from NGAs-PS-DBM had a book balance of P467,758.17. However, the confirmed 

balance from the PS-DBM was P793,932.67 with a discrepancy of P326,174.50. 

 

Detailed analysis showed that the transactions for the year were properly 

recorded both by the agency and the PS-DBM but the beginning balances of the two 

agencies were not reconciled. 

 

Per verification, Management acted immediately upon receipt of our AOM on 

May 3, 2021, and sent a letter to the PS-DBM requesting for a statement of account to 

help them reconcile their records. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief 

Accountant and the Supply Officer to: 

 

a) verify the unreconciled prior year discrepancy of P326,174.50 between 
PhilRaCom and PS-DBM records; and  

 

b) henceforth, reconcile records periodically with the PS-DBM. 
 

 

 

 

  



33 

Unsettled disallowances 

 

3. The disallowances issued to four former employees of PhilRaCom totaling 
P354,248.13 remained unsettled as of December 31, 2020 since three of them were 

already deceased and another had already transferred to another government 

agency. 

 

Review of the account Receivables-Disallowances/Charges showed that as at 

December 31, 2020, it has a balance of P354,693.86 pertaining to disallowances issued 

to four former employees of PhilRaCom that remained unsettled. The details are shown 

below: 

 

Accountable Officers Amount (P) Remarks 

Nicanor P. Jacinto III 66,500.00 Deceased with death certificate.                       

Rolando Martinez 4,000.00 Deceased with  death certificate. 

Rodrigo Pagapong, Jr.  400.00 Deceased but with no death certificate 

submitted.                       

Enrique C. Enriquez 283,348.13 Transferred to the Philippine Statistics 

Authority (PSA).  

Total 354,248.13  

 

As gleaned from the preceding Table, three of the liable persons were already 

deceased, while Mr. Enriquez had already transferred to the PSA.  

 

Verification showed that Mr. Enriquez sent a letter request dated September 29, 

2017 to the Director, Prosecution and Litigation Office (PLO), COA, for approval to 

settle his disallowance of P283,348.13 in 36 monthly installments, however, as at audit 

date, the Management claimed that it has not received any reply from the PLO, COA. 

 

The agency failed to monitor the refund of the disallowances, thus, 

accumulation of the balance of the account Receivables-Disallowances/Charges and 

the government was deprived of the restitutions of such funds.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a) direct the Accountant to send demand letter to Mr. Enrique C. Enriquez 
through the Agency Head of the PSA; and 

 

b) file a claim against the estate of the three deceased employees.  
 

Reimbursement of expenditures without legal basis 

 

4. Reimbursement of the Chairman and Commissioners of their representation and 
travelling expenses aggregating P1,247,665.84, on top of their commutable 

allowance and per diem, were without legal basis. 



34 

In accordance with Section 7 of the PD No. 420 dated March 20, 1974 creating 

PhilRaCom, the Chairman of the Commission shall receive a monthly commutable 

allowance of P1,000.00 and a per diem not to exceed P300.00 for each meeting actually 

attended, but that said allowance and per diems shall not exceed P2,200.00 during any 

one month. The other members of the Commission shall receive P800.00 and P200.00 

for commutable allowance and per diem, respectively, but not to exceed P1,600.00. 

 

Over the years, the monthly commutable allowance and per diem of the 

Chairman and the Members of the Commission have been increased and equated to the 

monthly RATA of Director IV and Director III. 

 

Pursuant to Budget Circular (BC) No. 2003-6 dated September 29, 2003, the 

Chairman is entitled to a per diem equivalent to 25 percent of the monthly RATA of 

the PhilRaCom’s Executive Director for every meeting actually attended but not to 

exceed four paid meetings in a month.  While the other members are entitled to 25 

percent of the monthly RATA of the Deputy Executive Director. 

 

Item 4.3 of the said BC No. 2003-6 limits the benefit to be received by the 

members of the Commission, to wit: 

 

The member or their representative shall not be allowed higher 

per diem rates and/or other benefits, whether commutable or 

reimbursable, in cash or in kind unless specifically authorized by 

law or by Presidential issuance. 
   

In reply to a letter-request by the PhilRaCom to increase the per diem being 

received by members of the Board, the DBM replied that consistent with BC number 

2003-6, the chairperson and each of the six commissioners could be entitled to a 

monthly per diem in a maximum of P18,000 or P216,000 in a year and P17,000 or 

P201,000 in a year, respectively. 

 

Post-audit, however, of CY 2020 transactions showed that in addition to the per 

diem and commutable allowances received, a total of P1,247,665.84 were reimbursed 

by the Chairman and the five Commissioners pertaining to meals, gasoline, toll fees, 

among others, and were recorded under the accounts Representation Expenses and 

Traveling Expense-Local.  Details are presented below:

Total 857,087.47 390,578.37 1,247,665.84 



35 

Moreover, verification revealed that out of the P390,578.37 under Travelling 

Expense-Local, a total of P328,618.45 was for the reimbursements of gasoline 

expenses, however, per Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment 

(RPCPPE) submitted by Management, no government motor vehicle was issued by 

PhilRaCom to the Commissioners. Section 3.1.1.8 of COA Circular No. 96-004 

provides that under no circumstances should fuel be issued to privately-owned motor 

vehicle.  

 

On the other hand, the reimbursements of the late Chairman Andrew A. 

Sanchez of gasoline expenses totaling P13,412.82 was irregular since he was issued a 

motor vehicle; thus, the vehicle’s gasoline expense is directly charged to the agency. 

 

The basis of the reimbursement, as claimed by Management, was Board 

Resolution No. 34-17, approved and signed by the Chairman and the Commissioners 

on July 12, 2017, authorizing various expenses to be charged to “Horse Racing 

Incentive Scheme”, to wit: 

 

1) Publicity expenses (media outfit); 
2) Meeting expense – inclusive of meals and parking fees;  
3) Farm and club visitation – inclusive of gasoline and toll fees; 
4) Hotel accommodation for official guests; 
5) Trophies, gifts and awards; 
6) Awards and recognition ceremonies; 
7) Transportation, communication and travel expenses; and  
8) Other similar and related expenses  

 

The funds appropriated by the Congress for the “Horse Racing Incentive 

Scheme” is described as granting of racing incentives for the promotion of racing 

industry, including prizes in stakes races. 

 

The reimbursements of P1,247,665.84 were without legal basis since as 

provided in Section 7 of PD No. 420 and BC No. 2003-6, the member or their 

representative shall not be allowed higher per diem rates and/or other benefits, whether 

commutable or reimbursable, in cash or in kind unless specifically authorized by law 

or by Presidential issuance; thus illegal. 

 

Section 3.3 of COA Circular No. 2012-003 describes illegal expenditures as 

incurred in violation of laws, such as payments of allowances and per diems in excess 

of limitations prescribed by law. 

 

We recommended that Management refund the claims of reimbursement 

of travelling and representation expenses of the Chairman and the Members of 

the Commission since these are additional allowances without legal basis. 

 

 

 



36 

Management Comment: 

 

The expenses incurred were pursuant to PD No. 420 and RA No. 11465 or the 

GAA. Upon the appointment to the Chairmanship of Mr. Aurelio P. De Leon, 

PhilRaCom submitted a letter to the Office of the President on January 11, 2021 seeking 

confirmation/approval of PhilRaCom Board Resolution No. 34-17 as regards the 

reimbursement of horse racing promotional expenses.  He instructed to temporarily 

suspend the processing of reimbursements without the express approval of the OP. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

We sustained our observation that the said reimbursements were incurred not 

in accordance with PD No. 420 or the GAA; hence illegal.  Moreover, as of the audit 

date, Management has not received the approval from the OP.  

 

 

Deficiencies in the release and liquidation of additional prizes to prize recipients 

 

5. Several deficiencies were committed both by PhilRaCom and the three Racing 
Clubs against the MOA entered into by and between them, such as:                               

(a) PhilRaCom’s delay in the release of checks representing additional prizes of 

P20,480,573.95 to the Racing Clubs ranged from 2 to 29 working days; (b) the 

Racing Clubs’ delay of 1 to 60 days in releasing said additional prizes to the 

recipients; (c) the Racing Clubs failure to submit after 10 working days the 

payroll showing the total amount released to the proper recipients with delays 

ranging from 4 to 133 days; and (d) the Racing Clubs’ release of P3,750,114.47 

additional prizes to persons other than the proper recipients. 

 

 On July 11, 2018, the PhilRaCom entered into a MOA with the three Racing 

Clubs, namely: the Philippine Racing Club, Inc. (PRCI), Manila Jockey Club, Inc. 

(MJCI) and Metro Manila Turf Club, Inc. (MMTCI) to ensure timely release and 

receipt of prizes by the recipients for CY 2018 races and for every year that PhilRaCom 

would give additional prizes. 

 

The MOA provides, among others, the following:  

 

 PhilRaCom shall release to the PRCI/MJCI/MMTCI, the three 
(3) Racing Clubs, and the latter shall receive in trust from 

PhilRaCom, the total amount of added prizes granted by 

PhilRaCom computed less appropriate tax/es and the required 

deduction for the Trainers’ and Jockeys’ Fund, within a 

maximum period of three (3) working days following the race 

schedule of race clubs; 

 

 Within a period of three (3) banking days from the receipt of 
the check from PhilRaCom, the three (3) Racing Clubs shall 



37 

release the additional prizes to the proper recipients and/or 

their authorized representative; 

xxx 

 After ten (10) working days from the release of the check of 
the added prizes, the three (3) Racing Clubs shall submit to 

PhilRaCom the payroll showing the total amount of added 

prizes released to the proper recipients and/or their authorized 

representatives or deposited into the bank account of proper 

recipients and the original document/record evidencing the 

release of prizes to the recipients. xxx 

 

 Any amount not released by the three (3) Racing Clubs or not 
claimed by the proper recipients and/or their authorized 

representatives, or not deposited into the bank accounts shall 

be refunded to the PhilRaCom after the lapse of the ten (10) 

working days reckoned from the release of the check of the 

added prizes. 

 

(a) Delayed release of additional prizes by PhilRaCom to Racing Clubs  
 

Upon verification of the transactions for the period January to March 2020 and 

September to November 2020, it was noted that the total amount of added prizes of 

P20,480,573.95 received by the three Race Clubs were released beyond the maximum 

period of three working days following the race schedule of Race Clubs, showing 

delays ranging from 2 to 29 days, to wit:

It was also noted that two or more prizes from another race were lumped into a 

single check causing added delay on the earlier race performed. Upon inquiry, this 

practice is a judgment call of the Chief Accountant. According to him, there were added 

prizes in a day that were small in amount so he decided to lumped it in the next race 

schedule with bigger added prizes, which is inconsistent with the MOA. 

 
(b) Delayed release of additional prizes by Racing Clubs to recipients 

 
Moreover, the three Racing Clubs released the additional prizes to the prize 

recipients beyond three banking days from the receipt of check from PhilRaCom, 

contrary to the provisions of the MOA.  

 

Based on the table below, we noted that the release of added prizes to the prize

Further, it was also noted that as at audit date, no liquidation documents/refund 

were submitted by the three Racing Clubs to PhilRaCom for the amounts received from 

July to November 2020.

(d) the Racing Clubs released additional prizes to persons other than the proper 
recipients. 

 

As provided in the MOA, the three Racing Clubs shall only release the 

additional prizes to the authorized representatives of the recipients upon submission by 

the latter to PhilRaCom of a duly signed and notarized Special Power of Attorney 

(SPA) specifically authorizing the representative to claim the added prize/s granted by 

PhilRaCom. 

 

Verification showed that in 568 instances, additional prizes in the total amount 

of P3,750,114.47 were released by the three Racing Clubs to persons other than the 

recipients even without the necessary SPA. Further verification also revealed that some 

SPAs submitted were deficient (no effectivity date, no signature of the attorney in fact).  

 

Based on inquiry from Management, the cause of the delay in the release of the 

checks to the Racing Club was due to non-submission of complete supporting 

documents and the lack of available fund.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to strengthen its monitoring 

control to ensure that the provisions of the MOA are strictly complied with 

between parties. Further, to submit documents to establish the validity of the 

payments on the P3,750,114.47 added prizes/s released to claimants other than the 

appropriate recipients.

Failure to prepare and submit Gender and Development (GAD) plans and programs  

 

8. The agency failed to prepare and submit to the Philippine Commission on 
Women (PCW) plans and programs pertaining to Gender and Development 

contrary to Section 8.2 of PCW-NEDA-DBM JC No. 2012-01 and Section 31 of 

the General Provisions (GP) of the General Appropriations Act (GAA) of FY 2020 

(RA No. 11465). 

 

Section 8.2 of PCW-NEDA-DBM JC No. 2012-01 provides that GAD Focal 

Point System (GFPS) shall submit the final GAD Plan and Budget (GBP) and the 

corresponding GAD Accomplishment Report (AR) to PCW for review and 

endorsement to DBM. Likewise, it provides that the submission shall include a letter 

signed by the head of the agency informing the PCW that the GPFS of the agency has 

accordingly reviewed the GPBs and AR. 

 

Section 31 of the General Provisions (GP) of the General Appropriations Act 

(GAA) of FY 2020 (RA No. 11465) requires all agencies of the government to formulate 

a GAD Plan designed to address gender issues within their concerned sectors or 

mandate. The GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of the agencies, 

which shall be at least five percent of their budgets. 

 

Verification showed that PhilRaCom failed to prepare and submit to the PCW 

its GPB for CY 2020. 

 



42 

Inquiry with Management revealed that when the former GAD focal person 

resigned in 2019, there was no personnel specifically assigned to prepare and 

coordinate with the PCW regarding GAD.  It was only in October 2020 that a new 

GAD focal person was designated. 

 

However, Management assured that for CY 2022 it will exert effort to comply 

with the provision regarding GAD. 

  

We recommended and Management agreed to:  

 

a) formulate GPB in accordance with the provisions of the GAA and other 
existing rules and regulations; and  

 

b) ensure that GPB shall be integrated in the regular activities of PhilRaCom, 
which shall be at least five percent of its budget. 

 

 

Programs and Projects Related to Senior Citizens and Persons with Disability (PWD) 

9. The agency was able to formulate plans and programs for the benefit of senior citizens 
and PWDs, in compliance with Section 32 of the GP of the GAA of FY 2020 (RA No. 

11465), as follows: 

 

1) Memorandum 2019-30 dated September 24, 2019 (continuous compliance) 
 

2) PhilRaCom Omnibus Guidelines Implementing the Equal Employment 
Opportunity Principle (EEOP)  

 

Compliance with Disaster Risk Reduction and Management and Climate Change 

Adaptation and Mitigation 

10. In compliance with Section 36 of the GP of the GAA of FY 2020 (RA No. 11465), 
PhilRaCom conducted and participated in the following programs: 

 

1) Inter-office Memo OED 07-2020-155 (Workplace Health Guidelines and 
Protocols) 

2) PhilRaCom Health Symptoms Questionnaires  
 

 

Compliance with Tax Laws 

11. The PhilRaCom complied with the requirements under DBM and Department of 
Finance (DOF) Joint Circular No. 1-2000 A dated July 31, 2001 on the remittance of 

all taxes withheld on gross compensation income from the officials and employees for 

CY 2020 and on taxes withheld from private entities regarding government purchases 

and contracts of services. 



43 

 

The total tax withheld from salaries and compensations amounted to 

P2,947,970.18 while VAT/E-VAT on procurement of goods and services reached 

P534,777.09 and P7,638,588.09 for Tax on Winnings. 

 

 

Remittance to Government Service Insurance System (RA No. 8291) 

12. For CY 2020, the agency withheld and remitted to the GSIS the amount of 
P6,354,842.09 pertaining to the premiums deducted and loan payment from the 

salaries of employees, respectively.

P14,680.20 for fire insurance and motor vehicles, respectively, were covered with the 

General Insurance Fund of the GSIS for CY 2020 in compliance with COA Circular 

No. 92-390 dated November 17,1992 as required under RA No. 656, otherwise known 

as “Property Insurance Law”, as amended by PD 245 dated July 13, 1973. 
 

Status of Audit Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges 

 

15. The PhilRaCom had no unsettled suspensions and charges as at December 31, 2020. 
However, disallowances amounting to P179,466,279.58 remained unsettled as of year-

end, contrary to Section 10.4 of the 2009 Rules and Regulations on Settlement of 

Accounts (RRSA). 

 

We recommended that Management continue to enforce settlement of the 

audit disallowances, in conformity with Section 10.4 of the RRSA. 

 

 

Status of Fund Utilization 
 

16. Based on the Schedule of Appropriations, Allotments, Obligations Incurred, 
Disbursements and Balances as of December 31, 2020, P253,293,000.00 which was 

the total appropriations for 2020, P158,535,730.67 or 62.58 percent were obligated 

while P123,169,638.83 or 48.63 percent were disbursed. There were unreleased 



44 

appropriations and unpaid obligations amounting to P13,000,000.00 and 

P35,366,091.84, respectively.  

 

PhilRaCom was not able to maximize the utilization of the funds allotted for 

their programs, projects and activities for CY 2020, thereby failed in attaining their 

mandates and accomplishing their targeted goals.
