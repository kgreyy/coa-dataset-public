F. Observations and Recommendations 
 

The significant audit observations and corresponding recommendations were 

communicated with Management officials concerned through the issuance of Audit 

Observation Memoranda, and discussed during the exit conference on May 3, 2021, 

details of which are discussed in this report. Management views and comments 

were incorporated in the report, where appropriate. 

 

1. A total of ₱70,764,503.98 unmatched balances of accounts Cash-
Treasury/Agency Deposit, Trust and Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, Special 

Account was noted between the PhilRaCom and the Bureau of the Treasury 

(BTr), casting doubt on the completeness and accuracy of the recorded 

transactions; hence, could not be relied upon. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to 

coordinate with the BTr for the reconciliation of the balances of Cash-

Treasury/Agency Deposits in the books of Games and Amusements Board   

(GAB) and BTr. 

 

2. A total of ₱326,174.50 discrepancy between the Due from NGAs-
Procurement Service-Department of Budget and Management (PS-DBM)   

account balance and its corresponding receivable account balance at the PS-

DBM due to unreconciled prior year balances of the intra government ac-

counts. 

 

We recommended and Management to direct the Chief Accountant and the 

Supply Officer to: 

 

a) verify the unreconciled prior year discrepancy of ₱326,174.50 between 
PhilRaCom and PS-DBM records; and  

 

b) henceforth, reconcile records periodically with the PS-DBM. 
 

3. The disallowances issued to four former employees of PhilRaCom totaling 
₱354,248.13 remained unsettled as of December 31, 2020 since three of them 

were already deceased and another had already transferred to another 

government agency. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a) direct the Accountant to send demand letter to Mr. Enrique C. Enriquez 
through the Agency Head of the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA); and 

 

b) file a claim against the estate of the three deceased employees. 
 



v 

4. Reimbursement of the Chairman and Commissioners of their representation 
and travelling expenses aggregating ₱1,247,665.84, on top of their 

commutable allowance and per diem, were without legal basis. 

We recommended that Management refund the claims of reimbursement of 

travelling and representation expenses of the Chairman and the Members of 

the Commission since these are additional allowances without legal basis. 

 

 

G. Implementation of Prior Year’s Audit Recommendations 
 

Of the nine audit recommendations contained in the 2019 Annual Audit 

Report, four were implemented and five were not implemented. The details are 

presented in Part III of this report.
