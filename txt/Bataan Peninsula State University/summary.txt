EXECUTIVE SUMMARY



A)	INTRODUCTION



	Bataan Peninsula State University (BPSU) was converted into a state university by virtue of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9403 dated March 22, 2007.



	Before the conversion, the old name of BPSU was Bataan Polytechnic State College (BPSC) which used to have three campuses; two are located in the City of Balanga and the third in Orani, Bataan. The enactment of R.A. No. 9403 resulted in the expansion of BPSU’s campuses as the Act integrated the Bataan State College (BSC) in Dinalupihan and its satellite campus in Abucay. On June 10, 2008, BPSU made education more accessible to the residents of Bagac and Morong by establishing an extension campus in the town of Bagac, Bataan.



	BPSU is under the management of Dr. Gregorio J. Rodis. The Board of Regents is the governing body of the University which is composed of the following:

	

		Hon. Ronald L. Adamat		Chairman

		Hon. Gregorio J. Rodis		Vice Chairman

D)	INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT

	

As discussed in Part II of this Report, the following audit observations affected the fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements: (a) doubtful accuracy of the Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) accounts due to (i) unreconciled discrepancy of ₱228,036,773.15 between the accounting records and Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE); (ii) unrecorded deliveries of PPE totaling to ₱570,800.00; (iii) inclusion of unserviceable, defective, and undisposed properties both in the books and in the RPCPPE aggregating to ₱2,445,753.92; and (iv) unreconciled discrepancy of ₱66,607,275.80 between the accounting records and Report on Projects/Programs/Activities (RPPAs); and (b) unreliable account balance of the Due to National Government Agencies (NGAs) due to (i) unreconciled discrepancy of ₱6,820,559.22 between the accounting records and status report of externally funded projects; (ii) undetermined status of scholarship funds released aggregating to ₱6,118,955.00; (iii) existence of unsubstantiated accounts totaling to ₱385,657.50; (iv) erroneous recording of fund transfer amounting to ₱4,243,600.00 to the Retained Income Fund (RIF); and (v) non-maintenance of subsidiary records on fund transfers in the sum of ₱38,004,877.33. 



	In view of the foregoing, we recommended that the University President undertake the following courses of action:



--	On Property, Plant and Equipment Accounts



a)	Instruct the University Accountant to (i) coordinate with the Property Officer for the reconciliation of the variance of  ₱228,036,773.15 between accounting records and the RPCPPE; (ii) recognize delivered PPE items of ₱570,800.00  based on the delivery receipts and acceptance reports from the Property Office; (iii) transfer the completed infrastructure projects amounting to ₱64,117,380.00 to correct the balances of Construction in Progress and School Buildings account; and (iv) trace the source of the “for reconciliation balance”, unknown projects, and recording errors amounting to ₱22,394,535.53, (₱8,796,252.96), and (₱1.02), respectively, and effect the corresponding adjustments to the CIP-Buildings and Other Structures account, if warranted; and



b)	Require the Property Officer to (i) submit a report on the delivered and accepted items as of year-end together with the corresponding copy of purchase order, sales invoice, delivery receipts, and inspection and acceptance report to the Accounting Unit to facilitate recognition in the books of accounts (ii) coordinate with all campuses in the preparation of the Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) for inspection and appraisal by management in compliance with Section 40 (d), Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I; (iii) create a disposal committee for the disposition of all unserviceable properties pursuant to Section 79 of P.D. No. 1445; and (iv) require the disposal committee to submit to the Accounting Division the proofs of disposal of unserviceable property for derecognition in the books of accounts. 



--	On Due to National Government Agencies



c)	Require the Accountant to (i) analyze the discrepancy of ₱6,820,559.22 and adjust errors noted, if warranted; (ii)  draw a journal entry voucher (JEV) adjusting the Due to NGAs and Accumulated Surplus/Deficit accounts for the bank charge of ₱1,468.00, and henceforth include the bank charges in recognizing the funds received by the University in the ensuing years;  (iii) complete the subsidiary records on the eight projects, including the funds received from Cavite State University (CvSU), Commission on Higher Education (CHED) Discovery-Applied Research and Extension for Trans/Inter-disciplinary Opportunities (DARE TO), and Department of Science and Technology (DOST) totaling to ₱6,719,977.50, ₱386,305.60, ₱14.12, and ₱287,206.00, respectively; (iv) review and analyze the unsubstantiated accounts amounting to ₱385,657.50 to determine their details and nature and the office responsible for the funds received so that the Audit Team could readily confirm the fund status; (v) adjust the recording of the funds received from the Retained Income Fund (RIF) to Custodial Fund (CF) in the amount of ₱4,243,600.00, and subsequently recognize the CF for similar fund receipts in the ensuing years in consonance with the GAM and UACS requirement; and (vi) review and analyze prior years’ transactions to obtain the details and nature of the “unreconciled balance” aggregating to ₱38,004,877.33 and prepare a separate subsidiary record, if warranted, in compliance with Section 63 (e), Chapter 6 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I and Section 111 of P.D. 1445; and



d)	Instruct the Scholarship Officer to (i) submit to the Audit Team the status report of scholarship funds released together with the supporting documents such as, but not limited to, signed payroll of the students and acknowledgment receipt from the Source Agency (SA). Otherwise, if the releases could not be properly substantiated, initiate appropriate action against the personnel concerned in accordance with Section 122 (2) of P.D. No. 1445; (ii) regularly reconcile the status report of scholarship funds released with the subsidiary records maintained by the Accounting Unit; and (iii) ensure that all scholarship funds are recognized, released to the appropriate recipients/beneficiaries, and any unexpended balance is fully remitted to the SA. 



E)	SUMMARY OF OTHER SIGNIFICANT AUDIT OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 



	Summarized below are the other significant audit observations with their recommendations, the details of which are presented in Part II of this report. Management views and comments were incorporated in the report, where appropriate. 

	

1)	Payments in the sum of ₱7,612,368.32 for 2019 claims of suppliers and employees of the University were inadvertently recognized in the current year contrary to the provisions of Section 119 of P.D. No. 1445 and Section 6, Chapter 2 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I on accrual basis of accounting, thus, resulting in the overstatement of the affected Assets, Expenses and Accumulated Surplus/Deficit accounts by ₱39,710.00, ₱7,209,368.32, and ₱7,249,078.32, respectively. (Observation No. 3) 



We recommended that the University President require the Accountant to:



a)	prepare the necessary journal entries to correct/adjust errors in recording by debiting Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) amounting to ₱7,249,078.32 and crediting Accumulated Depreciation totaling to ₱39,710.00 and the different Expenses accounts aggregating to ₱7,209,368.32;

b)	recognize the assets/expenses in the year the transactions actually occurred following the accrual basis of accounting to ensure proper matching of expenses with income for the accounting period; and 

c)	set up the corresponding Accounts Payable or Due to Officers and Employees account at the end of the year for goods and services already delivered/rendered but payments thereto could not be made yet. 



2)	Submission of the financial records and reports was delayed by at least 5 to 144 calendar days which is not in consonance with Section 7.1.1 (a) of COA Circular No. 2009-006; thus, the Audit Team was prevented from conducting a timely review and evaluation of transactions for the immediate communication of any reportable deficiencies and/or observations that may be noted therein. (Observation No. 5)



We recommended that the University President require the Finance Unit to strictly comply with the COA and DBM issuances on the prescribed period of the submission of financial records and reports to the Audit Team to avoid automatic suspension of payment of salaries until compliance with the requirements of the Commission as mandated in Section 112 (2) of P.D. No. 1445. 



3)	Out of the 30 curricular programs offered by the University, 23 were aligned with the mandate explicitly mentioned in Section 2 of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9403; 17 were included in the listed priority courses as identified in the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) Memorandum Order (CMO) No. 05, series of 2019; one has no Certificate of Program Compliance (COPC) as mandated under CMO No. 14, series of 2019; and 13 have yet to undergo yet the required independent accreditation under CMO No. 01, series of 2005; thus, raising doubt on the capacity of the University to institutionalize its mandate of spearheading socio-economic development in the locality by producing job-ready graduates from specialized/relevant programs. (Observation No. 11)



We recommended that the University President (a) require the Vice President for Academic Affairs (VPAA) to: (i) consider the latest priority courses in advising students during registration and enrolment to take up priority courses for them to avail of the CSPs; and (ii) continue to follow up the status of RQAT recommendations for the immediate issuance of COPC to the BS Industrial Engineering Program and inform the Audit Team of its issuance; and (b) direct the Director for Quality Assurance to: (i) monitor closely the lapsed accreditation statuses of different programs for updating or upgrading on or before the end of the grace period; and (ii) ascertain that all curricular programs are subjected to AACCUP accreditation as soon as graduates are produced in order to enjoy the benefits thereon. 



4)	The University Passing Rates (UPRs) obtained by the Bataan Peninsula State University (BPSU) on 11 out of 18 licensure examinations given during the years 2016 to 2020 were mostly below the National Passing Rate (NPR), thus, casting doubt on the capability of the University to produce professionals from among its graduates, especially in the fields of Engineering, Education, Nursing, and Accounting. On the other hand, based on the latest monitoring done by the different Offices of the Dean, out of 3,028 graduates in CY 2018 about 1,006 were employed, 685 were unemployed while the status of the remaining 1,337 were unknown in view of unreliable tool in the gathering and consolidation of data. Nonetheless, the number of unemployed, which constitutes 22.62% of the graduates in the same batch, is quite alarming, creating a negative impact on the realization of its mandate to produce competitive and empowered individuals.  (Observation No. 12)



We recommended that the University President require the Vice President for Academic Affairs (VPAA) to: (a) take a serious study on the causes identified for the low performance in the licensure examinations, especially for degrees with in-demand jobs such as Engineering, Accounting, Education and Nursing; (b) adopt applicable interventions to raise the UPR  and make the University at par with other reputable learning institutions locally and in other countries to level up with the CHED standard for SUCs; (c) assign one specific office that will monitor and consolidate the report on the employability of the graduates which can be used effectively by the offices concerned for planning purposes and development of enhanced strategies; and (d) encourage all program deans to conduct in-depth studies of the employability of their respective graduates and submit the same to the Office in charge of consolidation. The study will provide valuable inputs to the Job Placement Office on the proper matching of skills/competence with job opportunities at hand. Accordingly, the percentage of employment of graduates will increase.  



F)	SUMMARY OF TOTAL SUSPENSIONS, DISALLOWANCES AND CHARGES AT YEAR-END



	As of December 31, 2020, the University had unsettled audit disallowances of ₱7,037,679.62 and zero balance for audit suspensions and charges. 

 

G)	STATUS OF IMPLEMENTATION OF PRIOR YEARS’ UNIMPLEMENTED AUDIT RECOMMENDATIONS



	Of the 83 unimplemented audit recommendations in the previous years’ Annual Audit Reports, 23 were fully implemented, 48 were partially implemented while 12 were not implemented at all.
