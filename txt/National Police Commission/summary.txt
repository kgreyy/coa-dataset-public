EXECUTIVE SUMMARY





A)	INTRODUCTION



In 1966, Congress enacted Republic Act (RA) No. 4864 otherwise known as the Police Act of 1966 wherein it created the Police Commission (POLCOM) “to achieve and attain a higher degree of efficiency in the organization, administration and operation of local police agencies; and to place the local police service on a professional level.”  With the passage of R.A. No. 6975 on December 13, 1990, a new National Police Commission (NAPOLCOM) was created within the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) for the purpose of effectively discharging the functions prescribed in the Constitution and provided in the Act.



The NAPOLCOM is mandated by the 1987 Constitution and the Major Police Reform Laws, R.A. Nos. 6975 and 8551 to administer and control the Philippine National Police (PNP).  Under R.A. 8551, otherwise known as the “PNP Reform and Organization Act of 1998,” the Commission's authority over the PNP were strengthened and expanded to include administration of police entrance examinations, the conduct of pre-charge investigation of police anomalies and irregularities, and summary dismissal of erring police officers.  NAPOLCOM has 17 Regional Offices (ROs) to carry-out its objectives.



	The Commission is a collegial body composed of the ex-officio Chairperson and four regular Commissioners, and the Chief, PNP as ex-officio member, one of whom is designated by the President as the Vice-Chairperson.  The DILG Secretary is the ex-officio Chairperson, while the Vice-Chairperson and four Commissioners constitute the Commission Proper which serves as the governing body.  



It has a total manpower complement of 1,134 as of December 31, 2020.

C)	SCOPE OF AUDIT



The audit covered the financial transactions and operations of the NAPOLCOM for CY 2020. However, out of the 17 regions, the Management Letter of Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR) was not included in the Consolidated Annual Audit Report (CAAR) for CY 2020. The audit was conducted to (a) ascertain the level of assurance that may be placed on the management’s assertions on the financial statements; (b) determine the propriety of transactions as well as the extent of compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations; (c) recommend agency improvement opportunities; and (d) determine the extent of implementation of prior years’ audit recommendation.



D)	INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT



A qualified opinion was rendered on the fairness of presentation of the financial statements (FS) of the NAPOLCOM as at December 31, 2020 in view of the various accounting errors/omissions amounting to ₱4,946,871.26 which represents 0.46 percent of the Total Expenditures of ₱1,077,078,919.60 and accounting deficiencies amounting to ₱60,592,053.91 which represents 2.22 percent of the Total Assets of ₱2,726,962,747.22. 



E)	SUMMARY OF OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



1)	Various accounting errors and omissions in the keeping of accounts aggregating ₱4,946,871.26 resulted in the misstatement of account balances in the FS which represents 0.46 percent of the CY 2020 total expenditures of ₱1,077,078,919.60. (Observation No. 1)



We recommended that Management require the Accountant to draw a Journal Entry Voucher (JEV) to effect necessary/appropriate adjustments on the afore-stated accounting errors to correct balances of affected accounts in the FS.



2)	Deficiencies were noted in the examination and analysis of the accounting records such as: (a) unreconciled balance of Cash in Bank (CIB) accounts,                    (b) unreconciled balance of Due from Government-Owned and Controlled Corporations (GOCCs); and (c) discrepancy between the General Ledger (GL) and Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) balances. (Observation No. 2)



We recommended that Management: (a) consider the enrollment of their current accounts with the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) we-Access, an internet banking facility developed for LBP's institutional clients to facilitate generation of the monthly bank statements (BS); (b) require the Chief Accountant to monitor preparation of monthly BRS and submission of the same to the Office of the Auditor; (c) require the Chief Accountant to analyze and reconcile noted discrepancies and adjust the same to arrive at the correct balance of the account; (d) require the Accountant to perform periodic reconciliation of its Due from GOCCs account with BCDA records and immediately effect the necessary adjustments in the accounting books in order to present its true balance at any given period; (e) require the Housing Board to comply with their duties regarding the management of the NAPOLCOM housing project as provided under Special Order 2017-255 and to submit to the Accountant the financial reports thereof with complete and valid supporting documents for recording and reconciliation purposes; (f) instruct the Supply and Property Section of Region 2 and CARAGA to undertake a complete inventory of PPEs and submit the report thereon as required in Sections 38 and 42.g, Chapter 10 of GAM, Volume 1 to ensure the existence, condition and reliability of assets recorded in the books; and perform periodic reconciliation of accounting and property records to ensure that all discrepancies are immediately investigated and reconciled with the books of accounts; and (g) require the Accountants of Region 2 and CARAGA to prepare necessary journal entries to adjust the duly investigated reconciling items and in order to reflect the correct account balances; and maintain complete and accurate Property, Plant and Equipment Ledger Cards (PPELC) for each class of equipment.



3)	The NAPOLCOM Internal Audit Service (IAS) failed to fulfill its functions and objectives due to inadequate personnel, contrary to the provisions of the Philippine Government Internal Audit Manual (PGIAM) and NAPOLCOM General Order (GO) No. 2020-01 dated February 10, 2020. (Observation No. 3)

		

We recommended that Management direct the IAS to (a) comply with their duties and responsibilities as provided in Item Nos. III and VI of GO No. 2020-001 dated February 10, 2020 pursuant to PGIAM; and (b) facilitate the complete establishment of the organizational structure of the IAS by filling up the positions thru expediting the proposed plantilla as indicated in Item No. V of GO No. 2020-001 in order to perform its functions properly and attain its set goals and objectives.



4)	Funds utilized in the procurement of various equipment totaling ₱2,065,676.48 were sourced from the allotment for Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE) without the required authority from the Department of Budget and Management (DBM), contrary to Section 17 of the GAA for FY 2020, COA Circular 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012, and the GAM; thereby, casting doubts on the legality of disbursements. (Observation No. 4)



We recommended that Management (a) stop the practice of using MOOE allotment for capital expenditures; (b) request from the DBM an allocation for CO for the purchase of equipment or secure prior approval from DBM before modifying allotment in accordance with R.A. No. 11465 for exceptional circumstances, as the case may be; and (c) for Region 11, make a representation with the Central Office during budget preparation for the allocation of Capital Outlay for the requirements of the region.



5)	Unserviceable properties amounting to ₱2,028,490.73 were not disposed contrary to Section 79 of P.D. No. 1445. (Observation No. 5)



We recommended that the Regional Directors in the three Regional Offices to (a) instruct the Property Officer to list down all obsolete and unserviceable PPEs in the IIRUP in accordance with the existing regulations; and (b) create a Disposal Committee to undertake the immediate and proper disposal of the unserviceable properties in order to facilitate the immediate disposal of the unserviceable properties to maximize the realizable value that could be derived from such disposal.



6)	Advances for special time-bound undertaking and payroll amounting to ₱2,210,959.16 were not liquidated within the prescribed period or as soon as the purpose for which these were given had already been served contrary to Section 89 of PD 1445 and COA Circular Nos. 97-002 and 2013-001. Further, additional cash advances (CAs) were granted despite unliquidated/unsettled prior CAs. (Observation No. 6)



We recommended that Management (a) follow-up the demand letters on the CARAGA Region on the enforcement of liquidation of outstanding CAs or cause the deduction of the outstanding balance from their salaries of concerned personnel until recovery of full amount; and (b) refrain from granting additional CA to officers and employees with outstanding CAs.  



7)	Claims for various transactions totaling ₱2,921,734.78 were paid even with incomplete documentation contrary to pertinent provisions of PD 1445, RA 9184 and CSC Memorandum Circular (MC); thus, casting doubts on the propriety and validity of the disbursements made. (Observation No. 7)



We recommended that the concerned Regional Director require the Acting Chief, Budget and Accounting Section, and Chief, Administrative Division to submit the lacking supporting documents to COA and henceforth, ensure that all transactions for payment are duly supported with documents. 



8)	Payment of various expenditures totaling ₱8,746,600.58 relative to the agency’s COVID-19 response for prevention, mitigation and containment of the disease was not in accordance with existing rules and regulations; thereby, casting doubt on the validity and legality of transactions. (Observation No. 8)



We recommended that Management (a) submit the lacking documents pertaining to the disbursements for procurement of other supplies and materials amounting ₱3,509,140.00; and (b) require the Supply Officer of Region 9 to: (i) observe the perpetual inventory system in recording inventories procured; and (ii) issue RIS for all issuances thereof.

(Observation No. 9)



We recommended that Management of (a) Region 10 to submit justification stating the reason why overtime pay was granted to employees despite on Work from Home schedule; and (b) Central Office submit justification why payment of overtime pay should be allowed in audit even if the employees did not render the required number of work hours in CSC-DBM JC No. 1 s. 2015 and CSC MC No. 18 s. 2020 dated October 15, 2020. 



10)	Various allowances and benefits totaling ₱25,002,128.09 without legal basis were continuously granted to NAPOLCOM officers and employees including the Contract of Service (COS) or Job Order (JO) personnel despite prior years’ recommendation to stop the grant of the same; hence, complete disregard of the existing laws and regulations. (Observation No. 10)



We recommended that Management require the concerned officials and employees to refund the unauthorized allowances and benefits granted amounting to ₱25,002,128.09.



11)	Financial reports (FRs) and supporting documents/schedules were submitted to the Office of the Auditor beyond the prescribed period contrary to the existing rules and regulations; thus, precluding the timely evaluation/verification of reports/documents, early detection of deficiencies, if any and immediate communication of results to management. (Observation No. 11)



We recommended that Management require the Accounting Division and the concerned Unit/Office to submit the required FRs and supporting documents/schedule within the prescribed period pursuant to existing rules and regulations. 



12)	The GAD budget allocation of ₱13,820,000.00 represents 0.78 percent only of the agency’s total CY 2020 appropriations of ₱1,773,480,000.00; thus, not compliant to the mandatory requirement of at least five percent pursuant to Section 31 of the GAA of CY 2020. (Observation No. 12)



We reiterated our prior year’s recommendation that Management comply with GAD budget allocation as mandated by law, and work on the full implementation of the programmed projects and activities in the succeeding years in order to ensure attainment of the goals specified in the GAD plan.
