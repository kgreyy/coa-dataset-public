PART II – OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



	A)	FINANCIAL AUDIT



Accounting Errors/Omissions



1)	Various accounting errors and omissions aggregating ₱4,946,871.26 in the keeping of accounts resulted in the misstatement of account balances in the financial statements (FS) which represents 0.46 percent of the CY 2020 Total Expenditures of ₱1,077,078,919.60. 

 

1)	

	1)	  	The responsibility for the fair presentation and reliability of FS rests with the management of the reporting agency, particularly the head of the finance/ accounting office and the head of agency or his authorized representative, as provided in IPSAS 1 and Section 4, Chapter 19 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume 1.



	2)	 	Paragraph 27 of the IPSAS provides that FS shall present fairly the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses set out in IPSAS. The application of IPSAS, with appropriate disclosures, if necessary, is presumed to result in FSs that achieve a fair presentation.

		

	3)	 	Audit of the accounts disclosed errors and omissions aggregating ₱4,946,871.26 due to unrecorded transactions and misclassification of accounts.  These errors and omissions resulted in the misstatements of account balances in the FS which represents 0.46 percent of the CY 2020 Total Expenditures of ₱1,077,078,919.60.  The details are shown hereunder:

	4)	 	We recommended that Management require the Accountant to draw a JEV to effect necessary/appropriate adjustments on the afore-stated accounting errors to correct balances of affected accounts in the FS.



Accounting Deficiencies



2)	Deficiencies were noted in the examination and analysis of the accounting records such as: (a) unreconciled balance of Cash in Bank (CIB) accounts, (b) unreconciled balance of Due from GOCCs; and (c) discrepancy between the GL and RPCPPE balances. 



	1)	 	The accuracy and validity of accounting records cannot be ascertained due to the accounting deficiencies totaling ₱60,592,053.91, as shown below:

			a)		Unreconciled Cash in Bank accounts

			c)		Discrepancy between the GL and RPCPPE balances 

1,937,010.77

	Total

60,592,053.91



	a)	Unreconciled Cash in Bank accounts - ₱5,195,146.84



	2)	 	The consolidated balance of CIB account amounting to ₱202,852,905.79 was unreliable due to discrepancy of ₱5,195,146.84 between the book balance of Region I and the confirmed bank balance which was not adjusted due to non-preparation of Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS) as of December 31, 2020 contrary to Chapter 21 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume 1. 



	3)	 	BRS is prepared monthly by the agency to detect any discrepancies between the accounting records of the agency and the bank. Through periodic reconciliation, items that need to be adjusted in the books are taken up to bring the cash account and its affected accounts to its correct balance. It is also an indispensable tool to check the existence and accuracy of the balance of cash per books and per bank.



	4)	 	Section 5 of Chapter 21, GAM, Volume 1 states that: the Chief Accountant/Designated Staff shall within ten days from receipt of the monthly Bank Statement (BS) together with the paid checks, original copies of Debit Memoranda (DM)/Credit Memoranda (CM) from the GSB, reconcile the BS with the GL and prepare the BRS in four copies.



	5)	 	Also, Section 7 of the same Chapter provides the reporting period wherein the Chief Accountant is required to submit BRS within 20 days after receipt of the monthly BS to the following: 



--	Original – COA Auditor (with all supporting documents and JEVs)

--	Copy 2 – Head of Agency/Entity 

--	Copy 3 – Accounting Division/Unit file 

--	Copy 4 – Bank, if necessary



	6)	  	In Region 1, result of Bank Confirmation Inquiry No. 2021-001 dated January 5, 2021 showed that there is a discrepancy of ₱5,195,146.84 between the Agency’s book balance and bank balance with LBP as of December 31, 2020. Details are as follows:

	7)	 	Moreover, the BRS was neither prepared nor submitted to the Auditor within the period prescribed under the abovementioned provisions of Section 7, Chapter 21, of the GAM, Volume 1.



	8)	 	Inquiry with the Management revealed that non-preparation/submission of BRS was due to the late release of BS by the bank.



	9)	 	As such, the BRS as of December 2020 was not prepared by the Accountant; thus, bank and book reconciling items and errors that require corrections/adjustments were not immediately detected and corrected, casting doubt on the reliability of the Cash in Bank accounts as presented in the Agency’s financial statements.

	10)	We recommended that Management: 



		a)	consider the enrollment of the current accounts with the LANDBANK we-Access, an internet banking facility developed for LBP's institutional clients to facilitate generation of the monthly BS; 



		b)	require the Chief Accountant to monitor preparation of monthly BRS and submission of the same to the Office of the Auditor; and



		c)		  require the Chief Accountant to analyze and reconcile noted discrepancies and adjust the same to arrive at the correct balance of the account.



	11)	Management commented that BS were not released/issued on time by the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) which consequently caused delay in the preparation of BRS. Moreover, the Cashier was directed to make constant follow up of the monthly BS from the bank. Further, they are in the process of enrolling with the LANDBANK we-Access internet banking facility for an easy access on the Account Information. 



a)	Unreconciled difference  - ₱53,459,896.30 on Due from GOCCs - BMHI



	12)	The discrepancy of ₱53,459,896.30 between the year-end balance of the Due from Government-Owned and Controlled Corporation - BCDA Management & Holdings, Inc. (GOCC-BMHI) account and the Bases Conversion Development Authority’s records of receivables from the awardees of the Pamayanang Diego Silang (PDS) housing units remained unreconciled due to failure of Management to conduct period reconciliation of records with that of the BCDA; thereby, affecting the fair presentation of the financial statements.



	13)	The consolidated balance of Due from GOCCs account of ₱104,086,400.11 as at year-end includes the account of BMHI amounting to ₱104,083,650.46 representing receivables from the awardees of the PDS housing units which has been non-moving (BHMI account) since year-end of CY 2018.  Report on the PDS housing units and Bank Reconciliation Statement as of December 31, 2020 were furnished to COA which disclosed a balance of ₱50,623,754.16 consisting of receivables and cash collections amounting to ₱38,984,282.92 and ₱11,639,471.24, respectively. Comparison of these records with that of the NAPOLCOM revealed discrepancy of ₱53,459,896.30. 



	14)	The existence of discrepancy between the NAPOLCOM accounting records and that of the BCDA is an indication of errors in recording and non-reconciliation of records which render the balance of the Due from GOCC-BMHI account inaccurate and unreliable. 



	15)	Under NAPOLCOM Special Order No. 2017-255, the responsibilities of the Housing Board include among others, the supervision and monitoring of projects as well as financial reporting comprising the analysis of transactions and submission of necessary documents to the Accounting Office for proper and timely recording. However, inquiry with the Finance Service revealed that the Housing Board failed to perform its functions by not providing them the validated documents with complete attachments; hence, the reason for non-reconciliation and non-adjustment of records. 



	16)	Management claimed that it was BCDA’s obligation to turn-over the required reports to NAPOLCOM. Nonetheless, despite NAPOLCOM’s knowledge of BCDA’s shortcomings as to the submission of reports, the former still failed to coordinate with the BCDA regarding said issue.



	17)	This observation has been raised in previous years’ audit reports of NAPOLCOM and has not been resolved because of non-compliance by Management with COA’s audit recommendations. 



	18)	We recommended that Management require the:



a)		Accountant to perform periodic reconciliation of records pertaining to Due from GOCCs-BMHI with the BCDA records and immediately effect the necessary adjustments in the accounting books in order to present the true balance of the account at any given period; and 

	

b)		Housing Board to comply with their duties regarding the management of the NAPOLCOM housing project as provided under Special Order (SO) 2017-255 and to submit to the Accountant the financial reports thereof with complete and valid supporting documents for recording and reconciliation purposes.



	19)	To date, the comment of Management has not been received by the Audit Team.



b)	Discrepancy between the GL and RPCPPE balances - ₱1,937,010.77



	20)	The existence, condition and reliability PPE accounts in Region 2 and CARAGA Region totaling P8,292,008.18 cannot be ascertained due to incomplete physical count of PPE; absence of regular reconciliation of records between the Accounting Unit and Property Unit; and non-maintenance of PPE Ledger Cards (PPELCs).



	21)	As of year-end, the Property, Plant and Equipment account has an aggregate consolidated balance of ₱2,292,464,844.06. Comparison between the GL balances and RPCPPE balance of Region 2 and CARAGA Region for the same period showed total discrepancy of ₱1,937,010.77, as follows:

Total

	22)	In Regions 2 and CARAGA, the variance of ₱534,138.14 and ₱1,402,872.63, respectively, was due to absence of regular/periodic reconciliation of records between the Accounting Unit and Property Unit. It was also disclosed that there were no PPELC maintained by the Accounting Unit which should support PPE accounts in the GL, and from which to base/refer the amount and other specifications (serial No., PAR No., etc.) of the items recorded by the Supply/Property Unit.



	23)	We recommended that Management:

	

	a)		instruct the Supply and Property Section of Region 2 and CARAGA to undertake a complete inventory of PPEs and submit the report thereon as required in Sections 38 and 42.g, Chapter 10 of GAM, Volume 1 to ensure the existence, condition and reliability of assets recorded in the books; and perform periodic reconciliation of accounting and property records to ensure that all discrepancies are immediately investigated and reconciled with the books of accounts; and



	b)		require the Accountants of both Regions to prepare necessary journal entries to adjust the duly investigated reconciling items and in order to reflect the correct account balances; and maintain complete and accurate PPELC for each class of equipment.

	

	24)	Management agreed to conduct complete inventory taking of PPEs and submit reports to COA once accomplished. They committed that they will take actions on the reconciliation of RPCPPE and books of accounts, recording of adjusting journal entries, if any, and maintain and update property ledger cards.







	B)	COMPLIANCE AUDIT



NAPOLCOM IAS not fully established  



3)	The NAPOLCOM Internal Audit Service (IAS) failed to fulfill its functions and objectives due to inadequate personnel, contrary to the provisions of the Philippine Government Internal Audit Manual (PGIAM) and NAPOLCOM General Order (GO) No. 2020-01 dated February 10, 2020.



	1)		To complement the implementation of the National Guidelines on Internal Control Systems (NGICS), the PGIAM is being issued to explain and clarify the nature and scope of internal audit in the Philippine public sector, including its institutional arrangements, as well as its protocols and processes. The Department of Budget and Management (DBM) issued the PGIAM through DBM Circular Letter 2011-05 dated May 19, 2011, to strengthen the establishment of the internal audit function in all government agencies. The manual complements the National Guidelines on Internal Control System (NGICS).



	2)		Item No. III of the NAPOLCOM General Order No. 2020-001 dated February 10, 2020 provides that, The overall objectives of the Internal Audit Unit/Service is to provide assistance to top management by way of furnishing them with analyses, appraisals, recommendations and measures concerning the financial systems and procedures, administrative and technical operations of the different services/offices/units of the Commission.



	3)		Item No. V of the aforementioned Order provides that, The IAS shall be organized and shall function under the general supervision and control of the Vice-Chairman and Executive Officer but under the administrative and operational supervision of an assigned Commissioner who is equipped with powers, authority and responsibilities mandated by the management and as stated in the aforementioned provision. xxx.. The NAPOLCOM IAS shall be headed by the Chief, IAS with five personnel and shall have two divisions, namely: an Operations Audit Division and a Financial Audit Division with 7 personnel each division.”



	4)		Item No. VI of the same Order enumerates among others the functions of the Commission, such as: 1.) advise top management on all matters relating to management control and operations audit of the Commission; 2) conduct comprehensive financial and operations audit of the Commission’s Central and Regional Offices. xxx…”



	5)		In the CAAR for CY 2019, the Audit Team recommended the creation of the IAS. The Management responded with the recommendation through the issuance of GO No. 2020-001 dated February 10, 2020 which reactivated and institutionalized the Internal Audit Service/Unit (IAS/IAU) of the NAPOLCOM. Moreover, Special Order (SO) No. 2020-040 dated February 20, 2020 was issued designating personnel to initially constitute the said service. Additional technical persons under Contract of Service (COS) shall be hired to augment the manpower complement of the IAS/IAU.



	6)		Inquiry with the Management revealed that the IAS was not able to conduct the required management and operations audit for the current year due to lack of manpower. The available personnel of IAS claimed to focus more on NAPOLCOM’s compliance with the ISO audit. As a result, the overall objectives of the IAS/IAU to provide assistance to top management by way of furnishing them with analyses, appraisals, recommendations and measures concerning the financial systems and procedures, administrative and technical operations of the different services/offices/units of the Commission were not comprehensively carried out.



	7)		Moreover, IAS’ organizational structure was not totally established due to significant unfilled positions in the proposed plantilla for the Office. To date, the IAS is headed by an Acting Chief with only two assigned personnel which is an evident indication of lack of manpower.  The IAS should have a manpower complement of 20 but currently being manned by only three personnel or short by 17. This shortage may have an adverse impact on the agency’s productivity and attainment of its goals and objectives. 



	8)		Further inquiry with the Acting Chief of the IAS disclosed that the proposed plantilla for said Office was already submitted to the Commissioners of the NAPOLCOM. If accepted, the same will be submitted to DBM for approval to fully establish the organizational structure of IAS.



	9)		It is worth noting that IAS was created in order to assist NAPOLCOM in achieving an effective, efficient, and economical operations of the agency; however, the purpose of its creation was defeated due to unavailing discharge of functions. Consequently, weakness on internal control was not minimized as demonstrated by the deficiencies noted on accounting and financial management and risks to commit error or possible fraud may not be mitigated. 



	10)		We recommended that Management direct the IAS to:



a.  	comply with their duties and responsibilities as provided in Item Nos. III and VI of GO No. 2020-001 dated February 10, 2020 pursuant to PGIAM; and



b. 	facilitate the complete establishment of the organizational structure of the IAS by filling up the positions thru expediting the proposed plantilla as indicated in Item No. V of GO No. 2020-001 in order to perform its functions properly and attain its set goals and objectives.



MOOE Funds utilized for Capital Outlay projects/procurement



4)	Funds utilized in the procurement of various equipment totaling ₱2,065,676.48 were sourced from the allotment for Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE) without the required authority from the Department of Budget and Management (DBM), contrary to Section 17 of the GAA for FY 2020, COA Circular 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012, and the GAM; thereby, casting doubts on the legality of disbursements.



	1)		COA Circular 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 provides the Fundamental Principles governing the financial transactions and operations of any government agency as provided under Section 4 of PD 1445, among others are as follows: (1) No money shall be paid out of any public treasury or depository except in pursuance of an appropriation law or other specific statutory authority. Xxx…



	2)		Section 8, Chapter 10 of the GAM on Purchase of PPE: PPE acquired through purchase are charged against appropriations/allotments or special budget for capital outlay.



	3)		Also, Section 17 of the General Provisions of GAA for FY 2020 provides among others that the funds shall be utilized in accordance with the appropriations authorized for the purpose and comply with the applicable laws, rules and regulation xxx.



	4)		Section 70 of Republic Act No. 11465 or the General Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2020 provides that: Rules on Modification in the Allotment. As a general rule, departments, bureaus, and offices of the National Government, including Constitutional Offices enjoying fiscal autonomy and SUCs shall spend what is programmed in their respective appropriations in this Act. In exceptional circumstances, agencies may modify the allotment issued within an activity or project subject to approval of the following ensued by the timely submission of reports by all offices concerned: 



								a)	The heads of agencies, for the following: 



							i)	change in the details of an activity or project without changing its nature and within the same operating unit; and 

							ii)	change in the object of expenditure (Travelling Expenses, or Investment Outlays) within an allotment class (MOOE, or Capital Outlays); 



								b)	The DBM, in the following modifications: 



i)	  from one allotment class to another; 

ii)	  from one operating unit to another; 

iii)	  within a special purpose fund; and 

iv)	  for the payment of magna carta benefits authorized under Section 50 of     hereof; xxx



	5)		Section 80 of EO No. 292 - Misuse of Government Funds and Property provides that: Any public official or employee who shall apply any government fund or property under his administration or control to any use other than for which such fund or property is appropriated by laws, shall suffer the penalty imposed under appropriate penal laws.



	6)		Examination of JEVs and the corresponding DVs revealed that NAPOLCOM procured equipment totaling ₱2,065,676.48 using the allotment for MOOE which is not in keeping with the existing laws, rules and regulation on the proper use of government funds:

2,065,676.48

               

	7)		In CO, the allotment for MOOE was utilized for procurement of PPE due to insufficient allocation for Capital Outlay (CO). In Region 11, it is informed that it has been their practice to use the allotment for MOOE due to absence of budget for CO. Accordingly, Region 11 Management was constrained to use MOOE allocation because equipment are necessary in fulfilling their mandate. While there are equipment being transferred from Central Office to Region during the year, these are not sufficient to cover the agency’s needs especially that they are implementing work-from-home (WFH) arrangement. 



	8)		Inquiry with the Accounting and Budget Section disclosed that no prior approval from the DBM has been secured by the Management as required in Section 70 (b) (i) of RA 11465 on the modification of allotment. However, the Management claimed that the purchase of these PPEs is for the benefit of the agency and was done in good faith.



	9)		It should be emphasized that such practice is tantamount to misuse of government funds with legal sanctions/penalty as provided in Section 80 of EO No. 292.



	10)		We recommended that Management:  



a)	stop the practice of using MOOE allotment for capital expenditures; 



b)	request from DBM an allocation for CO for the purchase of equipment or secure prior approval from DBM before modifying allotment in accordance with RA 11465 for exceptional circumstances, as the case may be; and 



c)	for Region 11, make a representation with the Central Office during budget preparation for the allocation of Capital Outlay for the requirements of the region. 



	11)		Region 11 explained that they had submitted to the Central Office budget proposals that include provision for Capital Outlay but due to unknown reasons, those were not favorably considered. 



	12)		The Management assured their deference to the COA findings and will cease utilizing MOOE allotment for capital expenditures such as the procurement of information technology equipment. Moreover, they committed to continuously submit budget proposal that includes provision for Capital Outlay.



Unserviceable properties not yet disposed of 



5)	Unserviceable properties amounting to ₱2,028,490.73 were not disposed contrary to Section 79 of P.D. 1445.



	1)		Section 79 of P.D. 1445 provides: When government property has become unserviceable for any cause, or is no longer needed, it shall, upon application of the officer accountable therefore, be inspected by the head of the agency or his duly authorized representative in the presence of the auditor concerned and, if found valueless, it may be sold at public auction to the highest bidder under the supervision of the proper committee on award or similar body in the presence of the auditor concerned or other duly authorized representative of the Commission, after advertising by printed notice in the Official Gazette, or for not less than three consecutive days in any newspaper of general circulation, or where the value of the property does not warrant the expense of publication, by notices posted for a like period in at least three public places in the locality where the property may be sold.  In the event that the public auction fails, the property may be sold at a private sale such as price as may be fixed by the same committee or body concerned and approved by the Commission.



	2)		Sec. 40 (d), Volume I of GAM for NGAs provides that “All unserviceable property shall be reported in the Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) (Appendix 74 of GAM Volume II). X x x.”



	3)		Various unserviceable properties valued at ₱2,028,490.73 are still being kept in the premises of NAPOLCOM Regional Offices (ROs) and not yet disposed of. Details are as follows:



Region 

Cost

Region III

107,553.06

Region 4A

548,151.16

Region XI

1,372,786.51

Total

2,028,490.73

	4)		In Region III, unserviceable properties are kept idle in the premises and are not yet disposed due to the non-constitution of a committee on matters involving the proper disposal thereof. These properties are either valued at their residual or scrap value or if valued at cost, no longer provided the necessary service potential and are beyond economic repair.



	5)		In Region 4A, unserviceable properties include two units of fully depreciated PPEs classified as Motor Vehicle and Communication Equipment totaling ₱548,151.16, which is equivalent to 16.2 percent of the total PPE in the FS of Region 4A as of December 31, 2020.



	6)		In Region X1, unserviceable properties have not yet been disposed of and were not recorded in the IIRUP or dropped from the books of accounts as mandated. It was noted that these unserviceable properties were already beyond economic repair but may still have value and can be disposed thru sale; hence, the agency may still generate revenues therefrom.



	7)		The failure to immediately dispose these unserviceable PPEs would result in the continuous exposure thereof to elements of weather, wear and tear and other risk causing further deterioration and reduction of their salvage value.



	8)		We recommended that the Regional Directors in the three Regional Offices to: 



a)	instruct the Property Officer to list down all obsolete and unserviceable PPEs in the IIRUP in accordance with the existing regulations; and 



b)	create a Disposal Committee to undertake the immediate and proper disposal of the unserviceable properties in order to facilitate the immediate disposal of the unserviceable properties to maximize the realizable value that could be derived from such disposal.



	9)		Region 11 commented that the latest disposal of unserviceable properties was conducted sometime in 2017. During the same year, there was another attempt of the RO to dispose unserviceable equipment. It was highlighted that due to the limited number of personnel of the Office in previous years, the disposal of unserviceable properties was not prioritized. Nonetheless, in view of the implementation of the NAPOLCOM’s Quality Management System (QMS) and the aggressive recruitment of additional personnel, this will now be provided with considerable importance. As to date, IIRUP is currently being updated and this will be submitted to the recently reconstituted Disposal Committee for their consideration before the same is transmitted to COA.









Unliquidated and Long Outstanding Cash Advances (CAs)



6)	Advances for special time-bound undertaking and payroll amounting to ₱2,210,959.16 were not liquidated within the prescribed period or as soon as the purpose for which these cash advances (CAs) were given had already been served contrary to Section 89 of PD 1445 and COA Circular Nos. 97-002 and 2013-001. Further, additional CAs were granted despite unliquidated/unsettled prior CAs.



	1)		A CA shall be reported on and liquidated as soon as the purpose for which it was given has been served. No additional CA shall be allowed to any official or employee unless the previous CA given to him is first settled or a proper accounting thereof is made.



	2)		CA for special time-bound undertaking shall be liquidated by the accountable officer (AO) concerned within one month from the date the purpose of the CA was accomplished. CA for Salaries, Wages, etc. shall be liquidated within five (5) days after each fifteen (15) day/end of the month pay period. A CA is settled and liquidated either by returning the money advanced if unspent, or by the presentation of regularly accomplished vouchers, giving satisfactory detail of the items thereon paid which must be in accordance with the purpose for which the CA was granted, and further supported by proper receipts and other evidence of payment, subject to the result of the post-audit thereof by the auditor concerned.



	3)		Review of GL showed that CAs to Officers and Employees and for Payroll had balances of ₱582,814.26 and ₱1,932,810.59, respectively. Out of these amounts, ₱2,210,959.16 remained unliquidated as of December 31, 2020 despite the fact that the purpose for which these were given had already been served. Details are as follows:

	4)		In Region 1, CAs to officers and employees were not liquidated immediately after the purpose has been served. Also, previous CAs were not first settled before the grant of additional CAs; thus, government funds are exposed to unnecessary risk of possible loss or misappropriation.  



	5)		In Region 5, CAs for payroll were not liquidated immediately within five (5) days after each fifteen (15) day/end of the month pay period and previous CAs were not first settled before the grant of additional CAs.

	6)		In CARAGA, Advances to Officers and Employees totaling ₱247,953.70 pertained to CAs granted in prior years that remained unliquidated as at year-end. Management sent demand letters to concerned officers and employees on December 1, 2020 for immediate liquidation of outstanding CAs. 

	

	7)		We recommended that Management:



a)		follow-up the demand letters in CARAGA Region on the enforcement of liquidation of outstanding CAs or cause the deduction of the outstanding balance from the salaries of concerned personnel until recovery of full amount; and

	 

b)		refrain from granting additional CA to officers and employees with outstanding CAs.  



	8)		The Management of Region 1 already directed the Cashier to liquidate her CAs immediately and return unused funds if any and deposit the same to BTr.



	9)		Meanwhile, Region 5 acceded to the audit observation and promised to comply with the audit recommendations to avoid similar deficiencies in the future. Moreover, the Cashier, General Services Section, Administrative Division was already instructed to strictly observe the prescribed period of liquidation of CAs and ensure that all CAs are fully liquidated at the end of each year. 



	10)		On the other hand, CARAGA Region relieved the Budget Officer from her position last February 2021 so that she can focus on the liquidation and/or enforcement of liquidation of CAs, among others.



Incomplete documentary requirements



1)	Claims for various transactions totaling ₱2,921,734.78 were paid even with incomplete documentation contrary to pertinent provisions of PD 1445, RA 9184 and CSC Memorandum Circular (MC); thus, casting doubts on the propriety and validity of the disbursements made. 



	1)		The fundamental principles governing financial transactions and operations in government, among others, provides that: (a) government funds or property shall be spent or used solely for public purpose/s; (b) the claims against government funds shall be supported with complete documentation; and (c) all laws and regulations applicable to financial transactions shall be faithfully adhered to. (paragraphs 2, 6 and 7, Section 4 of PD 1445).

	

	2)		The (1) submission of proper evidence to establish validity of the claim and (2) legality of transactions and conformity with existing rules and regulations are the two basic requirements applicable to all types of disbursements of NGAs. (Section 36, Chapter 2 of the GAM, Volume I and COA Circular No. 2012-01).

			

	3)		Section 52.1(b) of the Revised IRR of RA 9184 provides that, at least three price quotations from bona fide suppliers shall be obtained.

	

	4)		Civil Service Commission (CSC) MC No. 01, series of 2001 requires that all government agencies shall submit the PRAISE and its subsequent amendments to the Civil Service RO. It also requires for the agency to establish a CSC-approved PRAISE which shall be the basis of the grant of the Productivity Incentive Bonus (PIB), other awards and incentives, as well as revocation of accreditation to take final action on appointments.

	

	5)	   Post-audit of transactions from January to December 2020 revealed that claims for various transactions amounting to ₱2,921,734.78 were paid without necessary supporting documents, as follows:

Total



2,921,734.78





	6)		In Region 2, the urgency or need of the agency prompted them to purchase directly from suppliers without obtaining price quotations from at least three bona fide suppliers for the procurement of various goods. Also, it was observed that supporting documents relating to repairs and maintenance expenditures were inadequate and not in consonance with the rules and regulations.

	7)		In Region 4A, cash incentives were paid in recognition of their outstanding achievements. The basis for the grant of cash incentives is CSC MC No. 01, Series of 2001; however, necessary documents as required in the guidelines were not submitted which casted doubts as to the propriety of such grant.

	

	8)		In Region 4B, inquiry with the Acting Accountant revealed that the supporting documents could have been overlooked in the segregation of copies of DVs while reimbursements were resorted to for transactions they deemed emergency. However, the agency should still perform the proper mode of procurement and disbursement.

	

	9)		Meanwhile, Accountant of Region 6 disclosed that preparation of DVs and its supporting documents starts from the requesting party. Accounting personnel was assigned to review/check the necessary documentary requirements. However, some documents were overlooked and were not attached to DVs before submission to the Office of the Auditor due to the AWA adopted by the agency and limited personnel on duty during ECQ/GCQ.  



	10)		The absence of required supporting documents attached to the DVs casted doubt on the propriety and validity of transactions.	

	

	11)	We recommended that the concerned Regional Director require the Acting Chief, Budget and Accounting Section, and Chief, Administrative Division to submit the lacking supporting documents to COA and henceforth, ensure that all transactions for payment are duly supported with documents. 

	

	12)	In Region 4A, Management already submitted the “NAPOLCOM Employee Handbook”, which is the basis in granting cash incentives and awards system in line with the PRAISE under CSC MC No. 01 series of 2001. However, the necessary supporting documents showing proof of compliance with conditions enumerated above were not yet submitted to the Audit Team for review/scrutiny.



	13)	Meanwhile, Region 4B issued a memorandum directing all concerned personnel to comply with the audit recommendations by submitting lacking supporting documents to COA. 



	14)	On the other hand, Region 6 had already prepared a checklist for the basic documentary requirements to support the DVs. They admitted that there was laxity on their part in checking completeness of documents to hasten processing of DVs due to limited personnel movement and AWA. However, they assured the Audit Team of their compliance with the audit recommendation in the succeeding year.

COVID-19 Expenditures



1)	Payment of various expenditures totaling ₱8,746,600.58 relative to the agency’s COVID-19 response for prevention, mitigation and containment of the disease was not in accordance with the existing rules and regulations; thereby, casting doubt on the validity and legality of the transactions. 



1)		GPPB Circular 01-2020 dated April 6, 2020 provides guidelines for emergency procurement under RA No. 11469 or the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act (Bayanihan Act). This Circular is formulated to expedite the procurement of highly needed supplies, materials, equipment, utilities, telecommunications, and other critical services authorized under Bayanihan Act at the most advantageous price to the government with the necessary safeguards for the prevention of abuses and corruption in the procurement process.

	

2)		Section 9, Chapter 8, Volume I of the GAM mandates the observance of Perpetual Inventory Method … xxx. Meanwhile, Section 17, Item D, of the same Chapter of the GAM requires that the Requisition and Issue Slip shall be used by the end-user to request issue of supplies and materials that are carried on stock.  



3)		Furthermore, the following are the pertinent provisions of laws, rules and regulations that govern the grant of allowances and benefits of government officials and employees:



4)		Section 4 of PD No. 1445: No money shall be paid out of any public treasury or depository except in pursuance of an appropriation law or other specific statutory authority.



5)		Section 5 of P.D. No. 1597 dated June 11, 1978: Allowances, honoraria and other fringe benefits – Allowances, honoraria and other fringe benefits which may be granted to government employees, whether payable by their offices or by other agencies of government, shall be subject to the approval of the President upon recommendation of the Commissioner of the Budget. Xxx..”



6)		COA Circular No. 2013-003 dated January 30, 2013, enumerated the allowances, incentives and other benefits that are granted to officials and employees pursuant to R.A. No. 6758 or the Salary Standardization Law (SSL). 



7)		Below is the summary of transactions considered not in accordance with existing rules and regulations:

      Overtime Pay – Civilian – ₱2,601,508.23 



10)		The NAPOLCOM CO granted overtime pay totaling ₱2,601,508.23 to 85 employees. Audit revealed that the grant was deemed unauthorized since the employees did not render the actual number of hours prescribed under CSC-DBM Joint Circular No. 1. s.2015. Detailed audit observations and recommendations are discussed in Finding No. 9 of this Report.

13)		The guidelines/procedures/requirements vis-à-vis noted findings on compliance were further expounded in the table below:



 Guidelines/Procedures/Requirements

Audit Observations

GPPB Circular No. 01-2020



3.1. PEs shall prepare the project requirements, with the following details:

a. Project Name;

b. Approved Budget for the Contract (ABC);

c. Technical Specifications, Scope of Work, or Terms of Reference;

d. Date of Delivery or Implementation;

e. Required quantity; and

f. Other relevant information that the PE may require. 

The project requirements for the ₱3,509,140.00 transactions were not prepared prior to the purchase of COVID-related supplies. The only document attached to the DVs and LRs was Official Receipt.

3.2. Once the budget for the Procurement Project has been validated by the budget officer or equivalent position, the Procurement Project shall be included in the Annual Procurement Plan (APP) approved by the head of the procuring entity (HoPE) or his or her delegate. X x x However, in view of the urgent necessity of the procurement covered under the Bayanihan Act, the PE may commence with the procurement even without an approved APP, provided there is a document or certification from the budget officer or equivalent position showing that there is a budget for the purpose. The APP shall be approved thereafter and posted on the PE’s website and submitted to the Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB) or posted on the GPPB online portal for Emergency Procurement under the Bayanihan Act, once operational, on or before 30 September 2020.

The certification of the Budget Officer or equivalent position showing that there is a budget for the purpose was not attached to DVs. On the other hand, the FY 2020 Supplemental APP No. 2 indicated an estimated budget of ₱14,942,781.00 for COVID-related expenses. However, upon checking the agency’s website and the GPPB online portal for emergency procurement, the APP of NAPOLCOM-CO was not posted.

3.3. PEs shall then directly negotiate or procure from a legally, technically, and financially capable supplier, distributor, manufacturer, contractor, or consultant. 



The legal, technical and financial capability of the supplier cannot be ascertained since the related documents were not attached to the LR.

3.4 The BAC or End-user unit or any other appropriate bureau, committee, support or procuring unit duly authorized by the HoPE, shall immediately recommend award of contract to one that has the legal, technical, and financial capability to undertake the procurement at hand, to wit:

a. submitted the mandatory documentary requirements under Item 4.1 of this Circular or if said documents were to be submitted after award of contract, has committed to comply with the same in the Omnibus Sworn Statement (OSS) X x x;

b. complied with the technical specifications, scope of work or terms of reference set by the PEs, and other documents supporting the same, including appropriate licenses and permits required by law or rules X x x;

c. submitted any financial requirements of the project X x x.

Appendix A of the IRR of RA 9184 prescribes the documents that the BAC shall require from suppliers, contractors and consultants for negotiated procurement during emergency. 



The mandatory documentary requirements are the Omnibus Sworn Statement, mayor’s/ business permit and Income/ Business Tax Return (For ABCs above ₱500,000.00. However, we found out that said documents were not attached to the DVs or LRs.

3.5. Xxx The HoPE or his duly authorized representative shall immediately sign the contract or purchase order, provided that all the documents required to be submitted prior to award of contract are complied with and that the OSS has been submitted. The contract shall include a warranty clause where the supplier, distributor, manufacturer, or contractor warrants that, for the period stipulated covering the procurement at hand, the Goods or Infrastructure Projects to be delivered or implemented shall be free from defects and conform to quality standards and technical specifications of the said contract.

The purchase orders and contracts were not submitted to the Office of the Auditor. As a result, the compliance with the inclusion of warranty clause in the contract was not validated.

3.6. The BAC, through its Secretariat, shall post for information purposes the NOA, contract, or PO in (i) the website of the PE or if none, any conspicuous place in the premises of the PE; and (ii) the GPPB online portal for Emergency Procurement under the Bayanihan Act, once it becomes operational.

The Notice of Award (NOA), contract or purchase order was not posted in the Agency’s website and in the GPPB online portal.

COA Circular No. 2012-001



Paragraph 1.1 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 – Documentary requirements common to all cash advances except for travels.

All purchases amounting ₱3,509,140.00 relative to COVID 19 response were made through CA. Expenses were only supported by ORs. The SDO was not able to provide the Audit Team with information regarding disbursement process on these expenses. She asserted that only ORs were given to her to substantiate validity of the expenses and the legality of the procurement process.



14)		In Regions 5 and 6, disbursements relative to COVID-19 response include grants and assistance to its officials and employees in the amount of ₱1,186,072.00 and ₱1,911,000.00, respectively. The Management pointed out that the personnel benefits were in accord with the safety and health regulations stipulation in Sections 1 and 2, Article 6 of the NAPOLCOM Management and NAPEMA’s Collective Negotiation Agreement (CNA) for 2016 and NAPOLCOM Disposition Form dated March 27, 2020. Detailed observations and recommendations are discussed in Finding No. 10 of this Report.



15)		Meanwhile, Region 9 purchased various COVID-19 related inventories totaling ₱136,794.70. These items include, among others, drugs and medicines, alcohol, face mask, temperature guns, etc., for stock. It was noted that the same was not coursed through the inventory account. Instead, the Accounting Unit booked the items as outright expense upon purchase. Examination also revealed that ₱86,794.70 were issued without RIS thus, monitoring of its distribution to end-users and determination of the reasonableness of the quantity issued could not be easily made. While the issuance of these items is understandably urgent, it should be emphasized that control and monitoring measures at all times must be observed by the agency so as not to put the government at a disadvantage position



16)		We recommended that Management:



	a)	submit the lacking documents pertaining to the disbursements for procurement of other supplies and materials amounting ₱3,509,140.00; and



	b)	require the Supply Officer of Region 9 to: (i) observe the perpetual inventory system in recording inventories procured; and ii) issue RIS for all issuances thereof.



17)		Region 9 commented that end-users of the procured items have accomplished the RIS and that issuances totaling ₱85,252.95 were already reported in the RSMI. Likewise, management commented that, for future transactions, they will observe the perpetual inventory system in recording inventories and will ensure that issuances thereof are covered with RIS and will be summarized in the RSMI as basis for recognizing corresponding expense in the books of accounts.



Unauthorized payment of Overtime Services



2)	Payment of overtime services by the NAPOLCOM to its personnel was inconsistent to the policies and guidelines on overtime services and overtime pay for government employees prescribed under CSC – DBM JC No. 1.  s, 2015, CSC MC No. 18, series of 2020 dated October 15, 2020 and COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012, resulting in the overpayment of ₱2,221,061.01.



1)		CSC – DBM JC No. 1 s. 2015 provides the policies and guidelines on overtime services and overtime pay for government employees, to wit:



3.0 The rendition of overtime services shall be authorized only when extremely necessary, such as when a particular work or activity cannot be completed within the regular work hours and that non-completion of the same will: (a) cause financial loss to the government or its instrumentalities; (b) embarrass the government due to its inability to meet its commitments; or (c) negate the purposes for which the work or activity was conceived.



8.0 Period of Overtime Services. xxx… officers and employees of departments and agencies shall render not less than 8 hours of work a day for 5 days a week or a total of 40 hours a week, exclusive of time for lunch. Generally, such hours shall be xxx….  The period of overtime service in a workday for a full-time employee shall include those rendered beyond the normal 8 work hours on scheduled workdays or 40 hours a week, and those rendered on rest days or scheduled days off, holidays, and special non-working days, both exclusive of time for lunch and rest; xxx… 



2)		Section 3 f and 7 of CSC MC No. 18, s. 2020 dated October 15, 2020 states that:



6.2 Employees under work-from-home are not entitled to Compensatory Overtime Credit/Overtime Pay.”



6.3 This amendment to the Revised Interim Guidelines shall take effect retroactively on March 16, 2020 



3)		Likewise, COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012 provides the updated guidelines for the prevention and disallowance of Irregular, Unnecessary, Excessive, Extravagant and Unconscionable Expenditures (IUEEUE), which states, among others:



Annex C, Cases that are considered "Unnecessary" Expenditures or Uses of Government Funds and Property - Item No. 12. Grant of overtime pay for work that is not of urgent nature as to require completion within a specified time or that can be undertaken during regular office hours.



4)		Audit of DVs revealed that overtime pay was granted to personnel of the Commission totaling ₱2,221,061.01. The said amount was deemed inconsistent with pertinent rules and regulations of the DBM, CSC and COA. Details are as follows:

Total



2,221,061.01



5)		In CO, overtime pay amounting ₱2,003,593.88 was granted to 85 NAPOLCOM personnel who were allowed to report to office on specific day/s during ECQ (March 16 to May 15, 2020) and MECQ (August 4 to 18, 2020) pursuant to NAPOLCOM SO Nos. 2020-071 and 2020-078 dated June 18, 2020 and June 30, 2020, respectively, and CSC MC No. 18. s. 2020. It was indicated in the SO that the employee shall report to office during the core working hours of 9am to 4pm at the assigned day of the week. In addition, the employees who reported to office shall be granted hazard pay.

6)		Based on the DTRs attached to the DVs, we noted that overtime pay was paid even if the employees did not render the required number of hours to be able to claim overtime pay. Under CSC-DBM JC No.  1. s. 2015, the period of overtime service in a workday shall be beyond the normal 8 work hours.  



7)		Inquiry with the Chief Accountant and the Assistant Director of Financial Services disclosed that they granted overtime payments after they received the response from CSC that rendition of overtime is allowed during ECQ/MECQ. During CY 2020, the overtime payments amounted to P2,046,721.39. However, based on our audit, the overtime pay should only be P43,127.51 instead of P2,046,721.39 or overpayment of P2,003,593.88.

8)		In Region 10, the agency paid overtime services pursuant to the unnumbered Memorandum dated September 15, 2020 issued by the NAPOLCOM RD requiring all employees to render overtime work with pay starting September 7, 2020.  However, it showed that there were employees who were granted overtime pay despite performing through Wok-From-Home as well as working within regular number of hours.



9)		It was also observed that the overtime authority did not state the necessity and urgency of the work to be done and duration of the work to be done, no overtime work programs attached and accomplishment reports (ARs) submitted were generic without specific work/task and output per person. From the foregoing reasons, payment of overtime pay was deemed unauthorized.



10)		We recommended that: 



	a)	Management of Region 10 submit justification stating the reason why overtime pay was granted to employees despite on Work from Home schedule; and



	b)	Management of Central Office submit justification why payment of overtime pay should be allowed in audit even if the employees did not render the required number of work hours in CSC-DBM JC No. 1 s. 2015 and CSC MC No. 18 s. 2020 dated October 15, 2020.

Management Comments

Auditor’s Rejoinder

Central Office

While the Commission does not dispute the observation of your Office, particularly on the non-compliance with the required minimum working hours, it is nevertheless submitted that such requirement does not strictly apply to the overtime payments in question.

The Audit Team does not prohibit per se the grant of Overtime (OT) Pay during the ECQ/MECQ periods. In fact, as per audit, ₱43,127.51 was deemed authorized overtime service. It was emphasized that the OT payment amounting to ₱2,003,593.88 was deemed unauthorized due to non-rendition of the actual OT service which warrants payment of OT pay. 



It bears to stress that these payments were made for the services rendered by selected personnel of the Commission during the strict implementation of ECQ and MECQ wherein majority of personnel in government agencies were required to self-quarantine in their respective houses thereby suspending the regular working hours. During these periods, all other government personnel were not required to render actual service but were nevertheless given full salaries and allowances in the spirit of Bayanihan and thus, akin to a holiday or paid special non-working days.

Government personnel during the said periods are still required to render service through AWA such as WFH and skeletal workforce (SWF); hence, ECQ/MECQ periods are deemed not considered regular holidays or special non-working holidays.



Considering that the said periods were not holiday, the mere physical reporting to the office as part of the SWF does not automatically entitle them to OT pay without rendering actual overtime service. The said interpretation will lead to double compensation which is tantamount to unjust enrichment. 



It is only fair to conclude that the required minimum hours of work provided therein, during ECQ and MECQ, were suspended or comparable to a holiday or paid special non-working days. To hold otherwise would result in undue discrimination against those who were directed to physically report at the office and risk their lives including their families, while everyone else were safe in their homes.

The suspension of the required minimum working hours and the declaration of holidays cannot be decided by an agency at their own discretion. 



Moreover, there was no undue discrimination since government personnel who physically reported for work during the ECQ/MECQ periods are granted hazard pay pursuant to Administrative Order No. 26. On the other hand, those who are engaged in WFH arrangements are not allowed to claim hazard pay.

Region 10

The overtime was made in connection with the digitalization program of the office. Since a big volume of files need to be scanned, each process owners were required to do overtime including establishment of a database system for the Height Waiver Grantees (HWG), PNP Benefit Claims and Summary Dismissal Cases.



The Management also commented that even if concerned personnel are on a WFH arrangement, the compensation they get in terms of overtime pay will compensate for the electricity bill for doing the scanning task.

The team disagreed with management and maintained its stand that the rendition of OT service is not allowed based on the following reasons: 

The digitalization program of the office does not meet the condition mentioned in Section 3.0 of CSC and DBM JC No. 1, series of 2015 dated November 25, 2015 that allow payment of OT services.



The rendition of OT services shall be authorized only when extremely necessary, such as when a particular work or activity cannot be completed within the regular work hours and that non-completion of the same will: (a) cause financial loss to the government or its instrumentalities; (b) embarrass the government due to its inability to meet its commitments; or (c) negate the purposes for which the work or activity was conceived.

The said benefit was recorded under the Salaries and Wages account for CO and Region 10, and under Other Personnel Benefits account for Regions 7 and 8. Except for the CO with no pertinent issuances attached to the DV that would support its legality and validity, benefit given by three ROs was based on the following criteria:



--	Region 7 – Based on the request letter from NAPOLCOM Employees Association (NAPEMA) representative Gina F. Archival who pointed out the necessity in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic;

--	Region 8 – Based on Regional Resolutions dated March 20, 2020, June 29, 2020 and December 18, 2020 granted Public Health Emergency Assistance.

--	Region 10 – Based on unnumbered memorandum dated December 14, 2020 from NAPEMA representative with a subject “Request for the grant of Emergency Health Allowance/Health Benefit Allowance and other allowances to Region 10 employees”. The request was approved by the Regional Director; however, the approved letter request cannot be equated as AO by the Office of the President that can authorize the grant of allowances.



7)	In Region 4A, Other Benefits and Allowances totaling ₱608,000.00 is composed of Emergency Relief Assistance and Special Welfare Assistance. These were paid in addition to the HEA and were recognized in the books as Other Bonuses and Allowances and Other Personnel Benefits.



8)	In Region 4B, Food Subsidy Allowance and Christmas Sack Allowance totaling ₱750,000.00 and ₱349,650.00 were given to officers and employees, respectively. Upon verification, grants were based only on Disposition Forms signed by the NAPOLCOM Employees Association (NAPEMA) Regional Representative dated March 16, 2020, April 2, 2020, and June 22, 2020 addressed to the Acting RD of NAPOLCOM MIMAROPA. All these benefits were recorded in the books under Salaries and Wages account.



9)	In Region 5, NAPOLCOM employees were being granted of Emergency Amelioration Package (EAP) for ₱20,000.00 per employee totaling ₱760,000.00 and EAP-Work-From-Home Wellness Allowance for ₱10,000.00 each plus 20 kilos of rice totaling ₱426,072.00.

12)	In CARAGA Region, examination of records showed that other than the Dietary Supplement Allowance, an Annual Medical Laboratory Allowance amounting ₱15,000.00 per employee or a total of ₱270,000.00 was paid pursuant to NAPOLCOM Office Order No. 2019-002 (V) dated March 25, 2019 which provides that funds for Annual Medical Laboratory and Dietary Supplement Allowance shall be chargeable against savings identified at the end of the quarter/year. Said order aimed to promote the physical well-being of the agency’s employees through the conduct of annual laboratory tests and provision of dietary supplements. 



13)	The Auditors noted that the manner of granting incentives to NAPOLCOM employees also existed in previous years and already communicated through numerous AOMs. Moreover, it may be recalled that grant of any form of unauthorized bonuses and allowances were already raised and recommended to be stopped in prior years’ Consolidated Annual Audit Reports (CAAR) and Notices of Disallowance Nos. 20-010-101 (2019) and 20-011-101 (2019), both dated January 20, 2020 in the amount of ₱5,640,000.00 were already issued relating to these transactions.



14)	We recommended that Management require the concerned officials and employees to refund the unauthorized allowances and benefits amounting to ₱25,002,128.09.



15)	Management comments and Auditor’s Rejoinder:



Office

Management Comments

Auditor’s Rejoinder

Central Office

Payment of Public Health Emergency Assistance (PHEA) to the personnel of NAPOLCOM Central Office was supported and covered by a presidential issuance, particularly Presidential Proclamation No. 922 s. 2020.

Also, there was uncertainty particularly on the continuation of the salary of personnel as ECQ was implemented.

Presidential Proclamation No. 922 s. 2020 was issued to facilitate the implementation of Republic Act (RA) No. 11332 to address the COVID-19 threat. It must be noted that RA No. 11332 did not provide specifically the grant of PHEA; thus, the grant of the same construed to be illegal for lacking the necessary statutory basis. 

Moreover, the payment of salary was not be affected by the pandemic given the fact that the budget for the salary of government employees is included in the annual GAA.

	

	

	

	

	

Delayed Submission of Reports



4)	Financial reports (FRs) and supporting documents/schedules were submitted to the Office of the Auditor beyond the prescribed period contrary to the existing rules and regulations; thus, precluding the timely evaluation/verification of reports/documents, early detection of deficiencies, if any and immediate communication of results to management.

4)	NCR and Regions 1 and 2 admitted the lapses especially during the implementation of ECQ/MECQ/GCQ which caused the delay in the submission of reports, DVs, copy of contract and notice of delivery to the Office of the Auditor. Management assured that they will religiously comply with the audit recommendation.



5)	In Region 12, the reason for the delay in the submission of TB and its supporting schedules was due to the ISO accreditation of the agency. The accountant was so preoccupied of her tasks for the accreditation that she often forgot to submit the required report on time. As for the DVs and its supporting documents, she revealed that the reason of delay was due to insufficient manpower in the AD in addition to the AWA caused by the pandemic. She stressed that possibly by February 2021 upon completion of the hiring process, the AD will have additional personnel so that they can resolve the delayed submission of reports.



6)	The BARMM’s accountant who is also a budget officer explained that due to overlapping duties and responsibilities, it was inevitable that submission of required reports was delayed and registries and other reports were not prepared. Meanwhile, Management has directed the Chief Admin to assess the workload of the Finance Division‘s personnel in charge in the preparation of mandatory financial documents and to designate additional personnel, if warranted. Accordingly, Management instructed the Accountant to check the proper documentation of each transaction prior to payment to comply with the requirements in COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 and Section 4 (6) of PD 1445 to minimize recurring problem of deficient documentation.



7)	The delayed submission of financial reports and supporting documents precluded the Auditor from timely verification of reports/documents and detection of deficiencies, if any. 



8)	We recommended that Management require the Accounting Division and the concerned Unit/Office to submit the required FRs and supporting documents/schedule within the prescribed period pursuant to existing rules and regulations. 



Implementation of Gender and Development (GAD) Program     



5)	The GAD budget allocation of ₱13,820,000.00 represents 0.78 percent only of the agency’s total CY 2020 appropriations of ₱1,773,480,000.00; thus, not compliant to the mandatory requirement of at least five percent pursuant to Section 31 of the GAA of CY 2020.



1)	All agencies of the government shall formulate a GAD Plan designed to address gender issues within their concerned sectors or mandate and implement applicable provisions under R.A. No. 9710 or the Magna Carta of Women, Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the Beijing Platform for Action, the Philippine Plan for Gender–Responsive Development (1995-2025), and the Philippine Development Plan (2017-2022).



2)	The GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of the agencies, which shall be at least five percent of their budgets. For this purpose, activities currently being undertaken by agencies which relate to GAD or those that contribute to poverty alleviation, economic empowerment especially of marginalized women, protection, promotion, and fulfilment of women's human rights, and practice of gender-responsive governance are considered sufficient compliance with said requirement. Utilization of GAD budget shall be evaluated based on the GAD performance indicators identified by said agencies. The preparations and submission of the annual GAD Plan and annual GAD AR shall be subject to the guidelines issued by the agencies concerned.



3)	For CY 2020, the NAPOLCOM has total appropriations of ₱1,773,480,000.00; however, the budget allocated for GAD was only ₱13,820,000.00 or 0.78 percent   instead of the required five percent of the total agency appropriations, contrary to Section 31 of the GAA for CY 2020. Out of the total GAD budget, ₱6,826,673.76 or 49.39 percent was expended for gender-mainstreaming activities. Detailed GAD activities and corresponding budget allocation and actual expenditures are shown in Annex A of the Report.



4)	Despite the fact that only 0.78 percent of the appropriations were allocated to GAD programs which is below the minimum five percent mandatory requirement, fund was still not maximized; thus, the NAPOLCOM’s annual GAD activities were not fully accomplished.



5)	This issue is a reiteration of prior years’ observation. The continuous non-compliance to the mandatory requirement as well as poor utilization of the GAD budget will contribute to the delay in the implementation of gender mainstreaming which is highly encouraged by the Philippine Commission on Women (PCW).



6)	We reiterated our prior year’s recommendation that Management comply with GAD budget allocation as mandated by law, and work on the full implementation of the programmed projects and activities in the succeeding years in order to ensure attainment of the goals specified in the GAD plan.



Programs for Senior Citizens, Persons with Disability and the Youth

		

6)	Twelve out of the 17 regions formulated plans and programs for the welfare of senior citizens (SCs) and persons with disability (PWDs) in consonance with the provisions of Sections 32 and 33 of GAA of 2020.



	1)	All agencies of the government shall formulate plans, programs and projects intended to address the concerns of SCs, PWDs and the youth, insofar as it relates to their mandated functions, and integrate the same in their regular activities.



	2)	Furthermore, all government agencies, departments, bureaus, offices, commissions and state universities and colleges shall allocate at least one percent of their respective budget for the implementation of plans, programs, projects, activities and services for older persons and persons with disabilities.



	3)	Of the 17 ROs, only 12 formulated plans and programs for the welfare of SCs, PWDs and the youth. The CO and four regions neither prepared plans/programs nor allocated funds to address the concerns of the elderly, PWDs and the youth contrary to Sections 32 and 33 of the GP of the 2020 GAA and Section 4.2 of DBM and DSWD Joint Circular No. 2003-01. Moreover, the Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR) was not able to submit their Management Letter, hence, their compliance with the aforecited sections of the GAA and DBM and DSWD JC cannot be ascertained.
