PART II – OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS





A)	Financial Audit 



Unreliable Cash Balance 



1)	Stale checks totaling P83,086.41 were not adjusted and/or recorded in the books as of December 31, 2020 contrary to the provisions of Chapter 6, Section 44 of the GAM Volume 1, resulting in the understatement of the Cash-Modified Disbursement System (MDS) - Regular and Accounts Payable accounts by the same amount.



	1)	Chapter 6, Section 44 of the GAM, Volume 1 states that:



Checks may be cancelled when they become stale, voided or spoiled. The depository bank considers a check stale, if it has been outstanding for over six months from date of issue or as prescribed and reported as follows:



a)	Voided, spoiled or unclaimed stale checks with the Cashier shall be reported as cancelled in the List of Unreleased Checks that will be attached to the RCI.



b)	New checks may be issued for the replacement of stale/spoiled checks in the hands of the payees or holders in due course, upon submission of the stale/spoiled checks to the Accounting Division/Unit. A certified copy of the previously paid DVs shall be attached to the request for replacement. A JEV shall be prepared.



	2)	Treasury Circular No. 03-2017, however, reduced the expiry period of MDS check from six (6) months to three (3) months from date of issue to reduce large balances of outstanding MDS checks and to simplify accounting, reconciliation and monitoring of the age profile and composition of check floats.



	3)	Verification of Cash - MDS, Regular includes reconciling items, totaling P83,086.41, representing stale checks which remained outstanding and not adjusted in the books as of December 31, 2020.  Details are shown below:

	4)	Entries for the cancellation and replacement of stale/voided/spoiled MDS checks issued in the current year should be as follows: 



Cash-Modified Disbursement System (MDS), Regular	xxx

Accounts Payable						xxx



To recognize the cancellation of stale/voided/spoiled MDS checks



Accounts Payable						xxx

          Cash-Modified Disbursement System (MDS), Regular	xxx



To recognize the replacement of stale/voided/spoiled MDS checks.



Cash-Modified Disbursement System (MDS), Regular	xxx

          Appropriate Account		  				xxx



To recognize the cancellation of stale/voided/spoiled MDS checks without replacement



	5)	As a result of the above errors, the accounts Cash - MDS, Regular and Accounts Payable were both understated by P83,086.41 due to non-adjustment of the stale checks.



	6)	It is informed that due to COVID-19 pandemic, payees of MDS checks were not able to collect payments due them; thus, MDS checks became stale. 



	7)	We recommended that Management direct the Accountant to immediately effect necessary adjusting entries pertaining to stale checks totaling P83,086.41, to reflect the correct balances of the affected accounts. 



	8)	As of March 11, 2021, the Management immediately prepared the adjusting entries for errors found. Further, to prevent recurring error, the Management required the preparer of the BRS to submit a Notice of Stale Checks Report with the corresponding JEV. 



	9)	Auditor Rejoinder:



JEV effecting adjustments of stale checks, including attachments thereof, was not submitted to the Audit Team. 		

					

	Unreliable balance of Inventories 

	

2)	The balance of the Inventory accounts amounting to P6,652,998.20 is unreliable due to: (a) non-recording of issued supplies inventory and semi-expendable properties and equipment amounting to P62,128.36 and P1,175,572.51, respectively; (b) non-reconciliation of Supplies Ledger Card (SLC) by the Accounting Division (AD) and Stock Card (SC) by the Property Division; and (c) non-submission of Report on the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) contrary to the provisions of Chapter 8  of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I.



	1)	Chapter 8 of the GAM, Volume I provides that:



Section 7	When inventories are sold, exchanged, or distributed, their carrying amount shall be recognized as an expense in the period in which the related revenue is recognized. If there is no related revenue, the expense is recognized when the goods are distributed or the related service is rendered.



Section 9	Supplies and materials purchased for inventory purpose shall be recorded using the perpetual inventory system, resulting in a more accurate inventory records and a running total for the cost of goods sold in each period.  The system requires accounting records to show the amount of inventory on hand at all times through the maintenance of the SLC (Appendix 57) by the Accounting Division/Unit for each item in stock. Regular purchases shall be coursed through the inventory account and issues thereof shall be recorded as they take place except for supplies and materials purchased out of PCF for immediate use or on emergency cases which shall be charged directly to the appropriate expense accounts.

Section 17	The following records, forms and reports are prescribed for use:



a)	Stock Card (SC) (Appendix 58) – shall be used to record all receipts and issues of supplies and the balance in quantity at any time. It shall be maintained by the Property and/or Supply Division/Unit for each item in stock. The IAR, RIS, PO and DR serve as the original sources of information for making entries on the card.



b)	Supplies Ledger Card (SLC) (Appendix 57) – shall be used to record materials received, issued and the balance both in quantity and amount at any time. It shall be maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit for each kind of supplies and materials. The IAR, RIS, RSMI, PO and DR serve as the original sources of information for making entries on the card.



c)	Report on the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) (Appendix 66) – shall be used to report the physical count of supplies by type of inventory as at a given date. It shows the balance of inventory items per card and per count and shortage/overage, if any. These include the semi-expendable property wherein the issue is covered by ICS.



	2)	As of December 31, 2020, the Inventory accounts of LGA have an aggregate balance of P6,652,998.20, consisting of the following:

	3)	The balance of inventory accounts as enumerated above is considered unreliable for the following reasons:



	a)	non-recording of issued supplies inventory and semi-expendable properties and equipment amounting to P62,128.36 and P1,175,572.51, respectively;

	b)	non-reconciliation of SLC by the AD and SC by the Property Division; and

	c)	non-submission of RPCI.



a)	Non-recording of issued supplies inventory and semi-expendable properties and equipment amounting to P62,128.36 and P1,175,572.51, respectively



	4)	Section 7, Chapter 8 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I provides that when inventories are distributed or related service is rendered, expense should be recognized. The following schedule shows the total purchases and issuances for the year 2020:

	5)	It could be observed that there were no issuances made for the eight semi-expendable property accounts; hence, the reason for accumulated balance of P3,159,374.46 at year-end. Likewise, the balance includes properties that were reclassified from PPE to semi-expendable in compliance to Section 10 Chapter 8 of the GAM for NGAs which provides the capitalization threshold of P15,000 for PPE. Nonetheless, these items were already issued to end-users upon reclassification; hence, corresponding expenses totaling P1,175,572.51 for the following semi-expendable properties should have been recognized:

	6)	Further, upon inspection and review of documents submitted, it was observed that inventories totaling P62,128.36 were already issued per Stock Cards as of December 31, 2020. However, the balance remains outstanding in the books as the RSMI, particularly for the month of December, was not submitted on a timely manner to the Accounting Division, thereby overstating the inventory account by the same amount. Details are as follows:

	7)	Thus, the non-recording of issued inventories and semi-expendable properties and equipment amounting to P62,128.36 and P1,175,572.51, respectively, renders the Inventory accounts overstated by P1,237,700.87 while the corresponding expenses understated by the same amounts.



b)	Non-reconciliation of SLC by the Accounting Division and SC by the Property Division



	8)	As previously discussed, the SCs maintained by the Property Division and SLCs maintained by the Accounting Division did not reconcile; thus, causing discrepancies totaling P62,128.36 between the actual and recorded inventories as reported by the two offices. 



c)	Non-submission of Report on the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI)



	9)	The RPCI is a form used to report the physical count of inventory items by type such as Office Supplies Inventory; Accountable Forms Inventory; Medical, Dental and Laboratory Supplies Inventory, etc. which are owned by the agency/entity. It shall be reconciled with the SLCs and SCs maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit, and Property and/or Supply Division/Unit, respectively and shall be prepared semi-annually by the Inventory Committee and by fund cluster. The report shall be submitted to the COA Auditor concerned not later than July 31 and January 31 of each year for the first and second semesters, respectively. However, to date, no RPCI was submitted by the Property and Supply Division to COA for audit and evaluation, as no physical count was conducted at year-end



	10)	We recommended that Management require the:



a)	Property and Supply Division (PSD) to submit RSMI for the month of December   to the AD in order to promptly record issuances of inventories and make corresponding adjusting entries for reclassified semi expendable properties already issued; 



b)	AD and PSD to update and regularly reconcile SLCs and SCs; and



c)	PSD to immediately submit the RPCI to COA in conformity with the pertinent provisions of GAM for NGAs Vol 1.



	11)	Management commented that the JEV taking up the issuance of Office Supplies, Medical, Dental and Laboratory Supplies and Other Supplies and Materials inventory was submitted to COA. Accordingly, restructuring of the Property and Supply Division will be made by assigning a dedicated personnel to reconcile records with the Accounting Division. 



	12)	Auditor Rejoinder:



No adjusting entries were made on the issuance of Semi-Expendable Properties.



Recurring gaps in PPE



3)	Recurring gaps in the physical count of the agency’s PPE were noted.  Further, unserviceable PPE of the LGA-TC were not disposed. Thus, exposing it to further deterioration and devaluation contrary to the provisions of COA Circular No. 2020-006 dated January 31, 2020 and Section 79 of PD 1445. 

	

	1)	In the physical inspection conducted last February 1, 2021 at the LGA-TC, Los Baños, Laguna, gaps contrary to the provisions of COA Circular No. 2020-006 were noted. Details are as follows: 

	

	COA Circular No. 2020-006

	Lapses found during Physical Inventory Taking

	Sec 5.6 Each government agency shall adopt a uniform property identification system for PPE wherein a unique Property Number shall be assigned for each PPE item.

--		The property tag varies in format making it difficult to locate the items listed in the Inventory Count Form (ICF). 

	Sec 5.9 In coordination with the Property Division/Unit, the Inventory Committee shall plan/strategize on how to conduct and complete the physical inventory within the prescribed period. It shall prepare a PIP containing, at the least, the specific assignments/duties of the Committee members, the cut-off date and a schedule specifying the dates and locations of the inventory taking activities from start up to the targeted completion of the physical inventory.

--		No Physical Inventory Plan (PIP) was submitted to COA 10 calendar days before the scheduled start of inventory taking activities.

	Sec 6.2(2) The Inventory Committee shall use the inventory working papers provided by the Property Unit as basis for inventory taking activities, taking into consideration the capitalization threshold of P15,000.

--		Still included as inventory are properties under the capitalization threshold of P15,000.00 for PPE.

	Sec. 6.2(3) The physical count shall be recorded/documented daily in a standard Inventory Count Form (ICF), using the format in Annex A  of this Circular, which shall be used as the basis in the preparation of the RPCPPE after the physical count.

--		The Inventory Committee did not use the recommended format of ICF,  pursuant to the  above-mentioned Circular to indicate current condition and location of properties found.

	Sec 6.2(5) All PPE items counted shall be tagged with new property stickers containing the information provided under Paragraph 5.7 of this Circular.

--		The properties were not tagged with new property stickers during the count. 



	2)	Further, Section 79 of PD 1445 provides the guidelines in the destruction or sale of unserviceable property. It requires that when government property has become unserviceable for any cause, or is no longer needed, it shall, upon application of the officer accountable therefore, be inspected by the head of the agency or his duly authorized representative in the presence of the auditor concerned and, if found to be valueless or unsalable, it may be destroyed in their presence.  

	

	3)	During the physical count of PPE, various unserviceable properties were found in the area, which if remained undisposed will be exposed to further deterioration and devaluation. Also, unserviceable properties include old bed frames and old furniture, which are made of fire-hazard materials. These light materials, if exposed to fire, could pose a threat to life and limb of personnel deployed in the area.  As required under Section 40(d) Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, an IIRUP shall be prepared by the Property Officer indicating therein the complete details of unserviceable properties subject to disposal.

	

	4)	It should also be noted that the RPCPPE was not submitted to COA Audit Team which is an annual report that shall also be prepared by the Supply and/or Property Division to be submitted to the Auditor concerned and Accounting Division not later than January 31 of each year. Non-submission thereof, shall prevent the Audit Team from validating the accuracy of reports of the Management. The physical count of PPE was only conducted last February 1, 2021; hence, the reason for the delayed  submission of the required report.  

	 

	5)	We recommended that Management require the PSD to: 

		

a)			strictly comply with the procedural guidelines in the conduct of physical count of PPE as provided under COA Circular No. 2020-006 dated January 31, 2020; and 

		

b)			immediately prepare and submit the IIRUP and RPCPPE as required under the pertinent provisions of the GAM for NGAs Volume I.



	6)	The Management acknowledged the lapses noted in the conduct of physical count of PPE and committed to: 1) use the ICF and issue uniform property tag with property number conforming with the format prescribed by the said COA Circular; 2) provide a copy of PIP ahead of time during the next count; 3) drop the semi-expendable properties from the list of PPEs and likewise issue  Inventory Custodian Slip (ICS) replacing the Property Acknowledgement Receipt (PAR); and 4) submit the IIRUP and RPCPPE as soon as possible. 



Further, during the Exit Conference the Management informed COA that the LGA has already organized a Disposal Committee to make further action on the undisposed properties, so as not to become hazardous to the Training Center.  



	7)	Auditor’s Rejoinder: 



The RPCPPE was submitted to COA on March 10, 2021 only. However, balances thereof did not reconcile with the balances in the books. Unserviceable PPEs were already excluded from the RPCPPE, while the semi-expendable properties are already dropped from the books.  



Further, Management is encouraged to prioritize the disposal of unserviceable properties and reconciliation of balances between the Accounting and Property Division in order to cleanse the PPE accounts. 





Unliquidated Fund Transfers



4)	Fund transfers to National Government Agencies (NGAs), Local Government Units (LGUs) and Non-Government Organizations/Civil Society Organizations (NGOs/CSOs) totaling P72,835,649.93 remained unliquidated as of December 31, 2020 of which 64 percent of the total balances or P46,607,025.97 had been outstanding from one to over three years, casting doubt as to whether or not the Academy’s resources are being used effectively and the projects’ objective towards the delivery of the desired outputs are efficiently implemented.



	1)	COA Circular 94-013 dated December 13, 1994 provides that: 



Section 4.6 Within ten (10) days after the end of each month/end of the agreed period for the Project, the IA shall submit the Report of Checks Issued (RCI) and the Report of Disbursement (RD) to report the utilization of the funds.  Only actual project expenses shall be reported.  The reports shall be approved by the Head of the IA.



Section 4.9 The IA shall return to the SA any unused balance upon completion of the project.



Section 6.7 The Implementing Agency shall return to the Source Agency any unused balance upon completion of the project.



	2)	Further, item 3.1.1 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 as amended by COA Circular No. 2016-002 dated May 31, 2016 requires: “certification by the Accountant that funds previously transferred to the Implementing Agency (IA) has been liquidated and accounted for in the books” as part of the documentary requirements for fund transfers.



	3)	As of December 31, 2020, the balance of funds transferred to NGAs, LGUs and NGOs/CSOs amounted to P72,835,649.93 for the implementation of various capacity development projects and activities, summarized as follows:

	4)	A significant decrease of prior years’ balances was observed during 2019, however, the following practices are still presently contributing to the accumulation of unliquidated fund transfers, to wit:



a)	Continuous release of fund transfers despite outstanding balances and without certification by the Accountant that funds previously transferred to the IA has been liquidated and accounted for;



b)	Period of implementation of specific projects funded by the transfer not specified in the MOA between LGA and IAs; and



c)	Circuitous manner of releasing funds and liquidation thereof.



a)	Continuous release of fund transfers despite outstanding balances 



	5)	Additional fund transfers totaling P39,796,497.87 were made during the year despite previous years’ unliquidated balances and no certification was issued by the Accountant confirming that funds previously transferred to the IAs has been liquidated and accounted for in the books.

	7)	Meanwhile, it should be noted that only 34.09 percent (P13,567,873.91/ P39,796,497.87) of the current year’s fund transfers have been liquidated, indicating that there are still lapses in the liquidation of fund transfers to date. Remaining balances of current year’s fund transfers amounting P26,228,623.96 shall continue to accumulate unless the Management restricts granting of additional fund transfers provided however, previous cash advances are liquidated.  



	8)	Despite liquidations made in 2020, the remaining unliquidated fund transfers casts doubt to the efficiency of implementation of projects for which the fund transfers were made.



b)	Period of implementation of specific projects funded by the transfer was not specified in the MOA between LGA and IAs 



	9)	The transfer of funds to DILG Regional Offices (DILG-ROs) was covered by a Memorandum of Agreement; however, this pertains to the whole year fund transfers and does not stipulate the specific activity to be conducted by the IAs and including the corresponding period of implementation for each project. Indicating the period of implementation in the MOA will be useful to facilitate the liquidation of fund transfers to IAs and imposition of penalties, if applicable. 



c)	Circuitous manner of releasing funds and liquidation thereof



	10)	The outstanding balance of P72,835,649.93 includes funds released by DILG-CO to DILG-ROs through LGA amounting to P63,316,343.01 for the implementation of various DILG programs and activities. This manner is deemed circuitous considering that the Department can release such funds directly to its ROs. Funds could have been downloaded directly to DILG-ROs to implement activities/programs for which the transfer was made. 



	11)	Confirmation letters were sent to NGAs/LGUs/NGOs/CSOs to verify the correctness of the remaining balances recorded in the books. However, out of 59 confirmation letters sent, only 26 replies were received, of which only one IA has the same balance as recorded in the books. Other IAs have differences in the timing of recording, while majority claimed that they have fully liquidated the amounts reflected in the balances of LGA. 



	12)	Due to this circuitous manner of releasing funds, some liquidation reports did not reach the LGA because these were allegedly submitted to either DILG or COA-IA. Hence, the liquidation of fund transfers for those NGAs/LGUs cannot be recorded accordingly. Difficulty in communicating with IAs and lack of coordination is evident in the replies to confirmation (Annex B). 



	13)	We recommended that Management:



a)	issue demand letters to IAs requiring the submission of liquidation reports and require the return of unused funds especially for long outstanding fund transfers (FTs); otherwise, strictly refrain from granting additional FTs unless previous CAs are first liquidated to minimize the accumulation of unliquidated balances;



b)	revisit the MOA with the IAs to ensure that timelines/completion date of every project funded by the FT are indicated therein; and



c)	coordinate with concerned ROs and LGUs and make necessary adjustments on the outstanding FTs based on the results of the confirmation.



	14)	Management explained that they have been continuously sending demand letters to IAs for them to liquidate. Further, the Management emphasized that a regular coordination is also established with DILG-ROs via Local Governance Regional Resource Center (LGRRC) Quarterly Meetings and during these meetings, status of FTs is one of the major point of concern. During the exit conference, Management added that they are implementing internal control measures to prevent granting of additional FTs to IAs with low liquidation rate. 



	15)	Auditor’s Rejoinder: 



We maintain our position that Management continue to coordinate with IAs to reconcile records. Further, the LGA should also consider seeking assistance from the DILG Central Office in order to oblige the Regional Directors to fully liquidate prior years’ accumulated unliquidated fund transfers.





B)	COMPLIANCE AUDIT



Non-remittance of Trust Receipts to the National Treasury 



5)	Unutilized fund balances/receipts from various sources totaling P19,111,308.61 intended for various purposes covering the period 2008 to 2020 were not remitted to the BTr or returned to Source Agencies (SAs) contrary to the provisions of Section 6 of the General Provisions of RA No. 11465 or the GAA for FY 2020 and EO No. 431 dated May 30, 2005.



	1)	It is a declared policy by the State that unless otherwise specifically provided by law, all income collected by agencies of the government by virtue of the provisions of law, order and regulations shall be deposited with the National Treasury, and shall accrue to the unappropriated surplus of the General Fund of the Government. 



	2)	Section 6 of General Provisions of the GAA (RA 11465) requires that the following be deposited to the National Treasury:



a)	Receipts collected or received by departments, bureaus, offices and instrumentalities of the National Government, including Constitutional Offices enjoying fiscal autonomy and SUCs: (i) from non-tax sources, such as insurance proceeds, acting as trustee, agent or administrator; (ii) as guaranty for the fulfillment of an obligation; or (iii) donations authorized by law or contract with a term not exceeding one (1) year; and 



b)	Those classified by law or regulations as trust receipts.



	3)	EO No. 431 dated May 30, 2005, on the other hand, requires reversion of all dormant accounts, unnecessary special and trust funds to the General Fund and for other purposes.



	4)	This was further clarified by the guidelines provided in COA Circular No. 2015-001 dated January 29, 2015 which prescribes that the head of the Accounting Unit of the NGA conduct thorough analysis of the cash accounts, providing cash mapping of cash accounts, special and trust funds maintained by the government agencies with AGDBs but without valid claimants, or are no longer necessary for the attainment of the purposes for which the said funds were established/received and/or the project implementation has been completed, terminated, cancelled or abandoned.



	5)	As of December 31, 2020, the CIB-LCCA maintained by LGA with AGDB includes receipts accumulating to P19,111,308.61. This account is made up of receipts from various sources such as refunds of unused funds from IAs, receipt of funds from SAs/donors/financing entities, and others, to wit:

	6)	It should be noted that the grant from ASEAN amounting to P9,133,093.64 for the implementation of the project entitled, "Baseline Study on Governance Systems among ASEAN Plus Three Countries" was made last March 2019. However, it was observed that the grant remained unutilized for more than one year.



	7)	We recommended that Management require the Accounting Section to: 



a)	determine proper disposition of all cash balances of LGA as prescribed in COA Circular No. 2015-001 dated January 29, 2015;



b)	prepare the DV and check to support the withdrawal of fund from the AGDB and subsequently remit the same to the BTr or return to the SA; and



c)	in case of grants from foreign donors, determine from the attendant agreement if unused funds are required to be returned to the grantor.



	8)	Management commented that they have exhausted efforts to scrutinize the details of DILG-LGA Account No. 0672-1075-12 and all funds found subject for refund/return were already remitted and recorded accordingly. With regard to the grant from ASEAN amounting to P9,133,093.64 for the implementation of the project entitled, “Baseline Study on Governance Systems among ASEAN Plus Three Countries”, Management clarified that the project is supposed to be fully implemented last 2020. However, due to the pandemic, the project implementation was halted. A request for extension for its implementation was already made to ASEAN and awaiting the official document of approval.



	9)	Auditor’s Rejoinder



JEVs covering the remittance of dormant fund balances to the BTr are not yet submitted to the Audit Team for validation and audit purposes.







Delayed submission of Bank Reconciliation Statements



6)	Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS) were not submitted to COA within the prescribed period, contrary to Section 5, Chapter 21 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I, thereby precluding the Audit Team from conducting timely audit of accounts and informing the Management of any deficiencies or errors that may be noted thereat.

		

	1)	The BRS shall be prepared in order to check correctness of both the bank’s and agency’s/entity’s records, to prevent fraud and to enable the agency/entity or bank to take up charges or credits recognized by the bank or agency/entity but not yet known to the agency/entity or bank.   

	

	2)	Section 74 of PD 1445 requires the agency head to see to it that reconciliation is made between the balance shown in the reports of the depositary banks and that in the books of accounts of the agency.

	

	3)	Preparation of the BRS as discussed in Section 5, Chapter 21 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I requires that the Chief Accountant/Designated Staff shall within ten days from receipt of the monthly Bank Statement (BS) together with the paid checks, original copies of Debit Memoranda (DM)/Credit Memoranda (CM) from the GSB, reconcile the BS with the GL and prepare the BRS in four copies.

		

	4)	The Chief Accountant/Designated Staff shall then prepare a JEV to recognize all reconciling items that require adjustment and correction in the books of accounts. The BRS shall be submitted within 20 days after receipt of the monthly BS to the following: 

	

	Original – COA Auditor (with all the supporting documents and JEVs) 

	Copy 2 –  Head of Agency/Entity 

	Copy 3 –  Accounting Division/Unit file 

	Copy 4 –  Bank, if necessary 

	

	5)	The BRS as of December 31, 2020 should have been submitted to the Audit Team last January 20, 2021. However, to date the latest BRS submitted are only up to March 2020 and August 2020. Details are as follows:

	6)	Inquiry with the personnel concerned, BS are hard to obtain from the bank especially in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.

	

	7)	BRS, among others served as proof that cash exist. To be effective, the BRS should be accurate and prepared on time. Reconciling items needing adjustments should be done immediately to ensure correctness of balances of affected accounts.

	

	8)	We recommended that Management exhaust all efforts to obtain copies of BS and immediately prepare and submit the BRS in order to address possible lapses and deficiencies that could be found thereof.

Likewise, a copy of the corresponding Accomplishment Report shall be furnished to the said audit team within five (5) working days from the end of January of the preceding year.

	

	3)		For CY 2020, the GAD Focal Person failed to secure endorsement of its GPB for CY 2020 from the PCW contrary to the provisions cited above. Consequently, the Management failed to submit it GPB CY 2020 to the Audit Team while corresponding Accomplishment Report (AR) was not submitted for review and validation, contrary to the provisions of COA Circular No. 2014-001 dated March 18, 2014. 

	

	4)		We recommended that the GAD Focal Point Person immediately submit copies of the GPB as approved by PCW and the corresponding Report of Accomplishments to the Audit Team in accordance with existing laws and regulations. 



	5)		Management admitted their lapses relative to the Programs/Projects concerning GAD and therefore committed to submit GAD Accomplishment Reports of the agency.

	“All agencies of the government shall formulate plans, programs and projects intended to address the concerns of senior citizens and person with disability, insofar as it relates to their mandated functions, and integrate the same in their regular activities.”
