C)		Scope of Audit



The audit covered the financial transactions and operations of the LGA for CY 2020. 

	

D)		Independent Auditor’s Report 



The auditor rendered an unmodified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the financial statement of LGA as of December 31, 2020.



E)		Summary of Observation and Recommendations 

	

1)		Stale checks totaling P83,086.41 were not adjusted and/or recorded in the books as of December 31, 2020 contrary to the provisions of Chapter 6, Section 44 of the GAM Volume 1, resulting in the understatement of the Cash-Modified Disbursement System (MDS)-Regular and Accounts Payable accounts by the same amount. (Observation No. 1)

	

	We recommended that Management direct the Accountant to immediately effect necessary adjusting entries pertaining to stale checks totaling P83,086.41, to reflect the correct balances of the affected accounts. 

	

2)		The balance of Inventory accounts amounting to P6,652,998.20 is unreliable due to: (a) non-recording of issued supplies inventory and semi-expendable properties and equipment amounting to P62,128.36 and P1,175,572.51, respectively; (b) non-reconciliation of Supplies Ledger Card (SLC) by the Accounting Division (AD) and Stock Card (SC) by the Property Division; and (c) non-submission of Report on the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) contrary to the provisions of Chapter 8  of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I. (Observation No. 2)

	

	

	We recommended that Management require the: a) Property and Supply Division to submit RSMI for the month of December to the AD to promptly record issuances of inventories and make corresponding adjusting entries for reclassified semi expendable properties already issued; b) AD and Property and Supply Division (PSD) to update and regularly reconcile SLCs and SCs; and c) PSD to immediately submit the RPCI to COA in conformity with the pertinent provisions of the GAM for NGAs Vol 1.

	

3)		Recurring gaps in the physical count of the agency’s PPE were noted.  Further, unserviceable PPE of the LGA-TC were not disposed. Thus, exposing it to further deterioration and devaluation contrary to the provisions of COA Circular No. 2020-006 dated January 31, 2020 and Section 79 of PD 1445. (Observation No. 3)

	

We recommended that Management require the PSD to: a) strictly comply with the procedural guidelines in the conduct of physical count of PPE as provided under COA Circular No. 2020-006 dated January 31, 2020; and b) immediately prepare and submit the IIRUP and RPCPPE as required under the pertinent provisions of GAM for NGAs Volume I.

	

4)		Fund transfers (FTs) to National Government Agencies (NGAs), Local Government Units (LGUs) and Non-Government Organizations/Civil Society Organizations (NGOs/CSOs) totaling P72,835,649.93 remained unliquidated as of December 31, 2020 of which 64 percent of the total balances or P46,607,025.97 had been outstanding from one to over three years, casting doubt as to whether or not the Academy’s resources are being used effectively and the projects’ objective towards the delivery of the desired outputs are efficiently implemented. (Observation No. 4) 

	

	We recommended that Management: a) issue demand letters to IAs requiring submission of liquidation reports and require the return of unused funds especially for long outstanding FTs; otherwise, strictly refrain from granting additional FTs unless previous CAs are first liquidated to minimize accumulation of unliquidated balances; b) revisit the MOA with the IAs to ensure that timelines/completion date of every project funded by the FT are indicated therein; and c) coordinate with the Regional Office and LGUs and make necessary adjustments on the outstanding FTs based on the results of the confirmation.

	

5)		Unutilized fund balances/receipts from various sources totaling P19,111,308.61 intended for various purposes covering the period 2008 to 2020 were not remitted to the BTr or returned to Source Agencies (SAs) contrary to the provisions of Section 6 of the General Provisions of RA No. 11465 or the GAA for FY 2020 and EO No. 431 dated May 30, 2005. (Observation No. 5)



We recommended that Management require the Accounting Section to: a.) determine proper disposition of all cash balances of LGA as prescribed in COA Circular No. 2015-001 dated January 29, 2015; b.) prepare the DV and check withdrawal from the AGDB and subsequently remit the same to the BTr or return to SA; and c) in case of grants from foreign donors, determine from the attendant agreement if unused funds are required to be returned to the grantor.

	

Other significant audit observations are also discussed in detail under Part II of this report.



The foregoing observations and recommendations were discussed with concerned officials of the agency during the virtual exit conference held on March 10, 2021. Management views and comments were considered in the report, where appropriate.



F)		Status of Implementation of Prior Years’ Audit Recommendations



Of the 22 recommendations embodied in the CY 2019 Annual Audit Report, 15 were fully/considered implemented while seven were not implemented. Details are shown in Part III of this report.
