PART II –DETAILED AUDIT OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



Financial and Compliance Audit



1)	The accuracy, reliability and accountability of the Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) account with a net book value of P82,572,993.37 could not be ascertained due to significant discrepancies  in the reported PPE balances in the Financial Statements and the Report on Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE); unverified increases on PPE accounts for CY 2020; unestablished accountability and control over the PPEs; and un-updated Property Cards (PCs) and PPE Ledger Cards (PPELC), which are all contrary to Section 111 of PD 1445, COA Circular No. 2020-006 dated January 31, 2020 and relevant provisions of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM). Hence, deprived the agency and its constituents of reliable and useful information in decision-making and established accountability on agency’s assets.



1)	Section 111 of PD 1445, otherwise known as the “State Audit Code of the Philippines” provides that: 



“1. The accounts of an agency shall be kept in such detail as is necessary to meet the needs of the agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or control agencies of the government.



2)	The highest standards of honesty, objectivity and consistency shall be 

observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate or misleading information”.



	1)	Section 15, Chapter 2 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I states that: 



“The FSs shall present fairly the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in PPSAS. The application of PPSAS, with appropriate disclosures, if necessary, would result in fair presentation of the FS.”



	2)	Section 3, Chapter 10, Volume I of the same Manual further provides criteria for recognition of PPE as asset if and only if:



a)	it is probable that the future economic benefits or service potential associated with the item will flow to the entity;

b)	the cost or fair value of the item can be measured reliably;

c)	beneficial ownership and control clearly rest with the government;

d)	the asset is used to achieve government objectives; and 

e)	it meets the capitalization threshold of P15,000.00.

	3)	Likewise, the College, in its Financial Reports for CY 2020 reported the following balances of PPE accounts, net of Accumulated Depreciation:

	6)	While Notes to FS discloses additions/acquisitions during the year totalling to P18,541,706.00 on the following particular accounts:



Machinery and Equipment			    P 15,440,906.00

Furniture, Fixtures and Books		                     3,100,800.00

Total Increases in PPE CY 2020		    P 18,541,706.00



	7)	Similar with the submitted list of newly acquired PPEs which are issued with Property Acknowledgment Receipt to BSC employees during the year which yielded another total of increases inconsistent with the above totals:

 

ICT Equipment				       P	4,487,060.00

Office Equipment					1,745,095.00

Other Office Equipment				1,114,229.00

Machineries & Equipment			   	   913,850.00

Communication Equipment			  	   240,600.00

Technical & Scientific Equipment			2,873,250.00

Agricultural & Fishery Equipment	           	 	   790,000.00

Furniture & Fixtures		                      	               522,355.00

Total Increases in PPE CY 2020		       P 12,686,439.00

 

	8)	These different amounts of increments extracted from different reports renders the PPE accounts unreliable and inaccurate. In the absence of updated Property Cards and PPE Ledger Cards which shall be maintained by the Property/Supply Office and the Accounting Division/Unit, respectively, verification and reconciliation of these variances will remain unattainable.



	9)	Other factors causing these discrepancies such as inclusion of items which did not meet the required capitalization threshold of P15,000.00 and unserviceable properties which shall be dropped from the books, were also noted.



	10)	The capitalization threshold of P15,000.00 represents the minimum cost of an individual asset recognized as a PPE on the Statement of Financial Position. Items with individual values below the threshold but which work together in the form of a group of network asset whose total value exceeds the threshold shall be recognized as part of the primary PPE. Expenditures incurred on purchasing, developing, and operating hardware, like internet connections of a website is accounted for as PPE if the total value of the primary asset and these items are within the threshold of P15,000.00 and above. This threshold shall be applied on an individual asset or per item basis. Each item within the bulk acquisition with aggregate or total value of PPE, such as library books, computer peripherals and small items of equipment will need to meet the capitalization threshold to be recognized as PPE.



	11)	While the following shall be applied to idle, unserviceable and fully depreciated PPE:



a)	Temporary idle activity or abandonment of PPE does not preclude depreciating the asset, as future benefits are consumed not only through usage but also through obsolescence, and wear and tear.



b)	A PPE is said to be fully depreciated when the carrying amount is equal to zero or residual value. The cost of fully depreciated assets remaining in service and the related accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses shall not be removed from the accounts.



c)	A PPE is said to be unserviceable if it is no longer capable of providing the entity with future economic benefits or service potential.



d)	All unserviceable property shall be reported in the Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP). PPE reported in the IIRUP shall be dropped from the books by debiting Impairment Loss-Property, Plant and Equipment (cost of the PPE less Accumulated Depreciated).



	12)	However, disposal procedures of unserviceable property shall be in accordance with applicable rules and regulations on Supply and Property Management Manual, and Section 79 of P.D. No. 1445. 



	13)	Further scrutiny of the submitted RPCPPE as at December 31, 2020 discloses several properties which are still under the name of employees who are already resigned or AWOL. Kindly see details in Annex E. 



	14)	Property Acknowledgement Receipt (PAR) shall be used in the Supply and/or Property Division/Unit to record the issue of property to end-user.  It shall be renewed at least every three years or every time there is a change in accountability or custodianship of the property.



	15)	It is imperative to maintain and update regularly the PAR to strengthen the internal control of the agency, where the accountability and control over the PPEs could be established anytime or whatever happens to avoid exposure to possible loss and improper use.

	

	16)	Considering that 84% of the total assets as at December 31, 2020 is apportioned to PPE accounts, it is important to validate the existence, accountability and accuracy of reported PPE balances because of its direct and significant impact on the reliability of the Statement of Financial Position (SFP) which shall serve as basis of Management’s decisions and/or formulating policies. 



	17)	We recommended that  Management:



a)	require the Property and Accounting Units undertake immediate collaborative procedures to ensure that all PPEs included in the RPCPPE are duly recorded in their respective records and that the Property Cards maintained by the Property Unit and the PPELCs maintained by the Accounting Unit be reconciled pursuant to Item 6.3 of COA Circular 2020-006 dated January 31, 2020; 



b)	update the existing Property Acknowledgement Receipts and renew the same at least every three years or every time there is a change in accountability or custodianship of the property; and



c)	adopt a uniform property identification system for PPE wherein a unique Property Number shall be assigned for each PPE item, using the numbering system prescribed under item 5.6 of COA Circular No. 2020-006 dated January 31, 2020.



	18)	The Management directed the  Supply Officer and the Accountant to explain in writing their comments and justifications regarding this audit observations. They were also instructed to strictly comply with the recommendations of COA.





1)	Discrepancies totalling P2,472,826.67 were noted between the reported balances of Cash in Bank, Local Currency Current Account (LCCA) and Cash–MDS, Special Account in the Financial Statements and the credit balances provided by the Landbank of the Philippines, Basco Branch, with total amounts of P19,295,970.57 and P21,768,797.24, respectively, as at December 31, 2020, hence, the accuracy of the balances of Cash Accounts reflected in the Financial Statements could not be ascertained.

	1)	Section 74 of PD 1445 states that: “At the close of each month, depositories shall report to the agency head, in such form as he may direct, the condition of the agency account standing on their books. The head of the agency shall see to it that a reconciliation is made between the balance shown in the reports and the balance found in the books of the agency.”

	2)	Likewise, Section 5, Chapter 21 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for NGAs Volume I, provides that: “The Chief Accountant/Designated Staff shall within ten days from receipt of the monthly Bank Statement (BS) together with the paid checks, original copies of Debit Memoranda (DM)/Credit Memoranda (CM) from the GSB, reconcile the BS with the GL and prepare the BRS in four copies.”

	3)	Review and verification of Cash Accounts reflected in the Financial Statements submitted by the College as at December 31, 2020 together with the confirmation letter from the authorized government depository bank – Landbank of the Philippines, Basco Branch, disclosed a total discrepancy of P2,472,826.67, as follows:

	4)	Should the required monthly Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS) have been religiously prepared and maintained by the College Accountant, such discrepancies/errors or other reconciling items requiring corrections by the agency could have been detected and corrected/adjusted promptly. 

	5)	We recommended that Management submit justification and/or reconciliation on the noted discrepancies of reported balances of Cash Accounts in the Financial Statements with that of the reported credit balances from the Agency’s authorized government depository bank – Landbank of the Philippines, Basco Branch.

	6)	The discrepancies between the reported balances of Cash in Bank-LCCA is attributed to Outstanding Checks issued by the College and are not yet reflected by the bank. The details of the outstanding checks will be attached in the preparation of the BRS.

	7)	As at this report, no BRS and supporting documents have been submitted to COA.



2)	The accuracy of the Cash in Bank, Local Currency Current Account (LCCA) amounting to P19,295,970.57 as at December 31, 2020 could not be ascertained due to non-preparation and submission of the required monthly Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS), contrary to Section 74 of PD 1445 and Section 5, Chapter 21 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for NGAs, Volume I.



	1)	Section 74 of PD 1445 states that: “At the close of each month, depositories shall report to the agency head, in such form as he may direct, the condition of the agency account standing on their books. The head of the agency shall see to it that a reconciliation is made between the balance shown in the reports and the balance found in the books of the agency.”



	2)	Likewise, Section 5, Chapter 21 of the GAM for NGAs Volume I, provides that: “The Chief Accountant/Designated Staff shall within ten days from receipt of the monthly Bank Statement (BS) together with the paid checks, original copies of Debit Memoranda (DM)/Credit Memoranda (CM) from the GSB, reconcile the BS with the GL and prepare the BRS in four copies.” Section 7 thereof further requires the Accountant to submit the BRS with all supporting documents and JEVs to the Commission on Audit within twenty days after receipt of the monthly bank statements.



	3)	Verification of records showed that BRS were not completely prepared and submitted to the COA, hence, the reported balance of Cash in Bank – LCCA as at December 31, 2020 could not be ascertained. Details on the submission of BRS are as follows:

	4)	Monthly BRS settles the differences between the Cash Balance in the Books of Accounts of the Agency and the Cash Balance as reflected in the Bank Statements as of a given date.  The preparation of BRS ensures the accuracy, validity and reliability of the Cash in Bank balance between the financial records of the agency and that of the depository banks. 



	5)	Giving no attention to the timely preparation of the Bank Reconciliation Statement deprives the Agency of the benefits of timely detection of human errors in accounting,  early detection of possible fraud, tracking down clearing of checks issued, and prevention of overdraft.  In the absence of monthly BRS or delay in the submission, timely verification thereof could not be performed.

 

	6)	Management has repeatedly cited as an excuse the untimely transmittal of the bank statements by the concerned depository bank which precluded the former from complying with the regulations. However, as public servants, it is our duty to safeguard the government funds from all losses resulting to possible unlawful deposits, use or applications thereof and for all losses attributable to negligence in the keeping of the funds, by looking for the best alternatives offered from the usual manner of securing data, which other government agencies are currently employing. 



	7)	We recommended that Management instruct the College Accountant to prepare and submit immediately all the lacking BRS for CY 2020 and provide a copy of the reconciling items in the Books of Accounts, if any, and the corresponding Journal Entry Voucher/s to COA. Thenceforth, religiously submit the required monthly Bank Reconciliation Statements for all bank accounts maintained by the College pursuant to the aforecited rules and regulations.



	8)	The Accountant was reprimanded and was required to religiously prepare and submit the monthly BRS to the Auditor. To facilitate its preparation, the Cashier was instructed to request copies of bank statements immediately after the end of each month and transmit the same to the Accountant. 





3)	Discrepancies totalling P27,507,480.86 were noted in the Statement of Cash Flows (SCF) particularly on the Collection of Service and Business Income, increases in PPE and Construction in Progress, vis-à-vis Financial Performance and Position of the Agency, thereby affecting the reliability of the related accounts. Likewise, the reported balance of Cash and Cash Equivalents Account in the SCF and Financial Position could not be ascertained due to noted discrepancy of P5,627,842.20.



	1)	The SCF is one of the financial statements required under the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs) pursuant to Sections 22 and 23, Chapter 19, Volume I.  It summarizes the cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities of an entity during a given period. It identifies the sources of cash inflows, the items on which cash was expended during the reporting period, and the cash balance as at the reporting date. 

	2)	The cash flow information provides users of financial statements with a basis to assess the ability of the agency to generate cash and cash equivalents, and the needs of the agency to utilize those cash flows. 



	3)	Examination of SCF as at  December 31, 2020 disclosed discrepancies in some items presented therein vis-à-vis Statement of Financial Performance and Statement of Financial Positions, as follows:

	4)	A discrepancy was likewise noted on the reported balance of Cash and Cash Equivalents Account:

P 24,928,697.08

P 19,300,854.88   

P 5,627,842.20



	5)	Furthermore, presentation of accounts in the Financial Statements showed that the prescribed manner provided in the Government Accounting Manual were not followed, instead, the accounts were presented alphabetically. General Purpose Financial Statements should be prepared and presented to ensure comparability both with the entity’s financial statements of previous periods and with the Financial Statements of other entities.



	6)	In view of the foregoing, the submitted Financial Statements as at December 31, 2020 are not reliable and properly presented.



	7)	We recommended that Management require the College Accountant to verify  the discrepancies noted and if warranted, prepare a revised Statement of Cash Flows that would tally with that of the balance presented in Statements of Financial Position and Performance in conformity with Sections 22 and 23, Chapter 19 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I.  Also, to revise  the Financial Statements in accordance with the manner prescribed in the GAM.



	8)	The Accountant admitted in committing error on the amount captured in the SCF. She was directed to prepare a restated SCF for the Auditor’s reconsideration.



	9)	Discrepancies noted were not yet settled.



4)	There are items inappropriately debited/credited to the account Advances to Officers and Employees which yielded a negative balance of P23,205.72, affecting the fair presentation of the account in the Financial Statements to include the total Cash Advances of P515,635.98 which were long overdue and already forwarded to the Office of the Ombudsman for appropriate action.



	1)	Chapter 3, Volume III of the Government Accounting Manual for NGAs provides descriptions of all accounts to enable agencies to properly recognize and present their financial transactions. Among others is the Advances to Officers and Employees Account which is described as follows:



“This account is used to recognize amount advanced to officers and employees for official travel. Credit this account for liquidation of advances.”



	2)	Section 29, Chapter 6, Volume I of the same Manual illustrates the Accounting Entries for the granting and liquidation of Cash Advances to Officers and Employees covering official travel:



Account Title				         Account Code 	Debit 	Credit



Advances to Officers and Employees			19901040     	P1,000

	3)	Verification of the submitted subsidiary ledger of the account Advances to Officers and Employees for all funds disclosed the following:

	4)	As gleaned from the above-table, there are expense items composing the account which are not appropriate per description provided by the GAM, such as settlement of Notices of Disallowance which should be credited in the Receivables-Disallowances/Charges etc., which eventually render the account misstated and misleading.



	5)	We recommended that Management require the College Accountant to revisit the journal entries made and draw the necessary adjustments/reclassification on the account Advances to Officers and Employees to reflect the correct balance in the Financial Statements. 





5)	Advances for Payroll amounting to P648,446.49 remained unliquidated as at Dec ember 31, 2020, contrary to COA Circular 97-002 dated February 7, 1997, thus, exposing government funds to risk of misuse or loss. 

		

	1)		COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 restated with amendments the rules and regulations on the granting, utilization and liquidation of cash advances which provides the following relevant provisions:

	

Section 4.1.2 – No additional cash advances shall be allowed to any official or employee unless the previous cash advances given to him is first settled or a proper accounting thereof is made;



Section 5.7 – When cash is no longer needed or has not been used for a period of two (2) months, it must be returned to or refunded immediately to the collecting officer;



Section 5.8 – All cash advances shall be fully liquidated at the end of each year.  Except for petty cash funds, the AO shall refund any unexpended balance to the Cashier/Collecting Officer who will issue the necessary official receipt; and 



Section 5.9 – At the start of the ensuing year, a new cash advance may be granted, provided that a list of expenses against previous cash advances is submitted.  However, when no liquidation of the previous cash advance is received on or before January 20, the Accountant shall cause the withholding of the AO’s salary.

	

	2)			Examination of Financial Reports disclosed a reported outstanding cash advances totalling to P648,446.49 as at December 31, 2020, details are as follows:

	3)	The law explicitly mandates that all cash advances be liquidated when the purpose has been served.  In case the purpose has not been served or there is an unutilized balance thereof, the same must be refunded at the end of the year, whether intended for petty operating expenses, TEV, special funds, working funds, etc.  in like manner, at the end of the year, all cash advances must have been liquidated.



	4)	The presence of unliquidated cash advances as at year-end is a patent disregard of the pertinent provisions of laws, rules, and regulations on the grant and utilization of cash advances.  Further, accountability for public funds was not cautiously carried out by the accountable officers concerned.  



	5)	We recommended that Management require all cash advances granted to officers/employees be fully liquidated at year-end, pursuant to the provisions of COA Circular No. 97-002 pertaining to the granting, utilization and liquidation of cash advances.



	6)	The Management required the Cashier to liquidate all her accountabilities before the year ends.



	

6)		A discrepancy of P4,482.47 was noted between the reported balance of the account Other Receivables of P185,308.57 and the total outstanding audit disallowances which are final and executory of P180,826.10 as at December 31, 2020, hence, the reported account balance could not be ascertained.

	

	1)		The revised Chart of Accounts under Volume III of the Government Accounting Manual for National Government Agencies states that: “Other Receivables account includes among others the Receivables-Disallowances/Charges which is used to recognize the amount of disallowances/charges in audit due from public/private individuals/entities which have become final and executory and credited for settlement of disallowances/ charges.”

	

	2)		Chapter 6, Section 46 of the same Manual further provides that disallowances shall be taken up in the books of accounts only when they become final and executory. A Notice of Finality of Decision (NFD) shall be issued by the authorized COA official to the agency head to notify that a decision of the Auditor has become final and executory, there being no appeal or motion for reconsideration filed within the reglementary period. Likewise, the Chief Accountant shall, on the basis of the NFD, record in the books of accounts, the disallowance and/or charge as a receivable. (Sec. 22 of COA Circular No 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009)

	4)	Transactions which are non-compliant with existing laws and regulations are considered illegal and irregular, thus, disallowed in audit as required under existing COA regulations. Notices of Disallowance issued to auditees for non-compliance with laws, rules and regulations are not yet taken up in the books until a Notice of Finality of Decision has been issued in accordance with Rules and Regulations on Settlement of Accounts. There is a financial error or misstatement in the event that the Management failed to record disallowances which are final and executory.



	5)	We recommended that Management instruct the College Accountant to review the reported balances and if warranted, prepare JEV to take up the adjustment/s on the discrepancy noted. From thence, monitor all disallowances issued and its corresponding settlements to reflect the correct balance of receivables in the financial statements.



	6)	The Accountant was instructed to effect the necessary adjustments and follow the proper JEV in treating the settlement of disallowances.

	

	

7)	The accuracy and validity of Payable Accounts totalling P42,686,994.33 presented in the Financial Statements could not be ascertained due to the non-submission of General/Subsidiary Ledgers for verification, contrary to Sections 111 and 114 of PD 1445 and Sections 12 and 33, Chapters 2 and 19, respectively, of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for NGAs Volume I.

	1)			Section 111 of PD 1445 states that:

		 

		“1.a. The accounts of an agency shall be kept in such detail as is necessary to meet the needs of the agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or control agencies of the government. 

		

1)			The highest standards of honesty, objectivity and consistency shall be observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate or misleading information”.

		

	2)	Likewise, Section 114 of the same Decree, which requires the maintenance of General Ledger further states that:



1)	The government accounting system shall be on a double entry basis with a general ledger in which all financial transactions are recorded.



2)	Subsidiary records shall be kept where necessary.



	3)	Moreover, Section 12, Chapter 2 of Government Accounting Manual for NGAs Volume I, requires the following books of accounts and registries to be maintained by the National Government Agencies as follows:



a)	Journals

1)	General Journal (Appendix 1)

2)	Cash Receipts Journal (Appendix 2)

3. Cash Disbursements Journal (Appendix 3)

4. Check Disbursements Journal (Appendix 4)



b)	Ledgers

	1)	General Ledgers (Appendix 5)

	2)	Subsidiary Ledgers (Appendix 6)



	4)	Section 33, Chapter 19 of the GAM further provides that the Chief Accountant or the Official In-charge or keeping the accounts of a government agency shall submit to the Commission on Audit year-end trial balances and such other supporting or subsidiary statements as may be required by the Commission not later than the fourteenth day of February. (Sec. 41 (2), P.D. No. 1445)



	5)	Failure on the part of any official or employee to comply with the provisions of preceding paragraph shall cause the automatic suspension of the payment of his salary and other emoluments until he shall have complied therewith. The violation of these provisions for at least three times shall subject the offender to administrative disciplinary action. (Sec. 41 (3), P.D. No. 1445)



	6)	Verification of Payable Accounts presented in the Financial Statements submitted by the College could not be made due to non-availability of General and Subsidiary Ledgers of the following ten (10) accounts, to wit:

	7)	The Audit Team asked the College Accountant to submit the related subsidiary records of the foregoing Payable Accounts, however as at this writing, none has been submitted to COA, which precluded the team to verify and ascertain the reported balances. 



	8)	The maintenance of Ledgers as required by the aforecited rules and regulations is a sound accounting practice.  These Ledgers summarize all transactions recorded in the General and Special Journals of the Agency.  The balances of each account coming from these ledgers are the amounts presented in the financial statements.  Whilst Subsidiary Ledger shows details for each control account in the General Ledger. The non-maintenance therefore of these ledgers renders the reliability of the accounts presented in the financial statements doubtful.



	9)	We recommended that the Accountant prepare and maintain the required ledgers to ascertain the correctness and reliability of the accounts presented in the Financial Statements and to avoid imposition of appropriate administrative sanctions provided in Section 41 (3) of P.D. 1445. 



	10)	The Management instructed the Accountant to comply with the requirements of this observation by preparing and maintaining the GL/SL of Payable Accounts in accordance with the pertinent provisions of GAM.

	

	

8)		Relevant documents supporting the payment and implementation of the project “Construction of BSC Agriculture and Fisheries Building” with a contract cost of P13,326,141.13 were not submitted to the Commission on Audit for review and evaluation within the prescribed period, contrary to Section 4(6) of PD 1445 and COA Circular Nos. 2012-001 and 2009-001 dated June 14, 2012 and February 12, 2009, respectively, thereby causing undue delay in the legal and auditorial review of the infrastructure project, and depriving the Management of the opportunity to be informed of the deficiencies, if any, at earliest time possible.

		

	1)		Section 3.1.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009 requires that within five working days from the execution of a contract by the government or any of its subdivisions, agencies or instrumentalities, including GOCCs and their subsidiaries, a copy of said contract and each of all the documents forming part thereof by reference or incorporation shall be furnished to the Auditor of the agency concerned.

	

	2)		The copies of documents required to be submitted shall include but not limited to the following:

b)	Letter of Intent;

c)	Eligibility Documents and Eligibility Data Sheet;

d)	Eligibility Requirements;

e)	Results of Eligibility Check/Screening;

v)	Such other documents peculiar to the contract and/or to the mode of procurement and considered necessary in the auditorial review and in the technical evaluation thereof.



	3)	Moreover, Section 4 (6) of PD 1445 provides that: “Claims against government funds or property shall be supported with complete documentation.” 



	4)	Details and status of implementation on the Construction of BSC Agriculture and Fisheries Building as of September 30, 2020 are illustrated below:

	5)	Review and verification of various payments made to the concerned contractor disclosed that the following documents which are deemed to form, and be read and construed as part of the Contract Agreement made between the Batanes State College and REMAR Construction were not attached to the submitted Contract Agreement, viz:

a)	General and Special Conditions of Contract;

b)	Drawings/Plans;

e)	Instructions to Bidders;

f)	Bid Data Sheet;

	6)	In the absence of these essential documents, the Audit Team could not review the contract as to its legality and propriety, pursuant to COA Resolution No. 2015-014 dated April 06, 2015. Hence, immediate submission of all pertinent documents is required. 



	7)	We recommended that Management  submit immediately all lacking/required documents (in original copies) supporting the implementation of the project “Construction of BSC Agriculture and Fisheries Building”. And henceforth, the Accountant and other concerned BSC Officials are encouraged to review the pertinent provisions of PD 1445 and COA Circular Nos. 2012-001 and 2009-001 to prevent recurrence of the same findings.



	8)	Pertinent documents submitted are subject for review and verification.





9)		The grant of honoraria to the College’s Board of Trustees with an aggregate amount of P107,500.00 was inconsistent with the rules prescribed by DBM Circular No. 2003-6 and COA Circular No. 2002-022 dated September 29, 2003 and April 4, 2000, respectively. 

	

	1)	Department of Budget and Management Circular No. 2003-6 dated September 29, 2003 states that members of governing boards of SUCs who actually attended board meetings shall be entitled to compensation in the form of per diem, not honorarium. Item 5.1 thereof further provides that the amount shall be charged against the amount appropriated for the purpose in the General Appropriations Act. Any deficiency shall be charged against savings.



	2)	Upon review of the submitted disbursement/payroll vouchers together with its supporting documents pertaining on the payment of honoraria to the College’s Board of Trustees (BOTs) disclosed that, aside from the payment in the form of honorarium, the claims were charged to Fund 164 instead of the General Appropriations Act.

	3)	Commission on Audit Circular No. 2002-022 dated April 4, 2000, states among others, that: “in no case shall the special trust fund be used for the payment of salaries and creation of new position and that the special trust fund shall be used to augment the maintenance and other operating expenses and capital outlays of the university and to pay authorized allowances and fringe benefits to teachers and students who render services to the school.”



	4)	Moreover, CHED Memorandum Order No. 20 series of 2011 prescribes the policies and guidelines for use of income, special trust fund and programs of receipts and expenditures of the State Universities and Colleges and defines Special Trust Fund (STF) as the income of SUCs arising from collection of tuition fees, miscellaneous fees, service and other income. This is broken down into (1) Tuition Fees; (2) Fiduciary Fund; (3) Revenues collected by self-liquidating units; (4) Revenues generated by IGUs; and (5) Regular and other Trust Fund without separate depository account.



	5)	Fund 164 or Revolving Fund of the College to which the honoraria were charged, are funds arising out from business and income-generating activities of the College. Hence, considered as special trust fund which shall be disbursed only for specific purposes. 



	6)	The per diem of the governing boards for their attendance in board meetings partakes of the nature of compensation categorized under Personnel Services.

	7)	In any event, the special trust fund may not be utilized to pay compensation, per diems or honoraria, not even an additional allowance. (Benguet State University vs. COA, G.R. No. 169637 dated June 8, 2007)



	8)	 Hence, payment of honoraria charged from special trust fund is bereft of legal basis.



	9)	We recommended that Management to henceforth pay the College’s Board of Trustees in the form of per diem as their compensation in their actual attendance in board meetings and charging the same against the amount appropriated fpr the purpose in the General Appropriations Act of the College.



	10)	Management commented that Section 4 of the Republic Act No. 8292 grants specific powers and duties to the governing boards of state universities and colleges. Among these is the power to fix tuition fees and other necessary school charges, and later disburse them.



	11)	Management further states that, Section 4. Powers and Duties of Governing Boards. – The governing board shall have the following specific powers and duties in addition to its general powers of administration and the exercise of all the powers granted to the board of directors of a corporation under Section 36 of Batas Pambansa Blg. 68, otherwise known as the Corporation Code of the Philippines:



      X  x  x 



(d) to fix the tuition fees and other necessary school charges, such as but not limited to matriculation fees, graduation fees and laboratory fees, as their respective boards may deem proper to impose after due consultations with the involved sectors.



Such fees and charges, including government subsidies and other income generated by the university or college, shall constitute special trust funds and shall be deposited in any authorized government depository bank, and all interests shall accrue therefrom shall part of the same fund for the use of the university or college: Provided, that income derived from university hospitals shall be exclusively earmarked for the operating expenses of the hospitals.



Any provision of existing laws, rules and regulations to the contrary notwithstanding, any income generated by the university or college from tuition fees and other charges, as well as from the operation of auxiliary servies and land grants, shall be retained by the university or college, and may be disbursed by the Board of Regents/Trustees for instruction, research extension , or other programs/projects of the university or college; Provided, that all fiduciary fees shall be disbursed for the specific puposes for which they are collected.



If, for reasons beyond its control, the university or college, shall not be able to pursue any project for which funds have been appropriated and, allocated under its approved program of expenditures, the Board of Regents/Trustees may be authorized the use of said funds for any reasonable purpose which, in its discretion, may be necessary and urgent for the attainment of the objectives and goals of the universities or college.



	12)	Specifically, tuition fees and other necessary school charges collected by the state university or college constitute a special trust fund, which shall be disbursed by its governing boards for instruction, research extension, or other programs or projects. Here, it is undisputed that the additional honoraria to the members of the state universities and colleges’ governing boards when they attend board meetings are to be sourced, not from appropriations, but from their special trust funds.



	13)	Additionally, the disbursement of additional honoraria falls within the limitation of “instruction, research, extension, or other programs/projects of the university of college” in Section 4(d). They maintain that the work of the governing board during these meetings are directly related to instruction, research, and extension. It is the College’s humble submission that the conduct of meetings, and are directly related to instruction, research and extension” or “other programs/projects” of the university or college. The spirit of the law is such that the term “programs/projects” embraces the conduct of meetings, and the payment of honoraria for attendance at meetings to the members, of the BOT as these are directly related to the College’s academic programs. Meetings of the BOT are conducted in pursuance of their primary objective which is to attain quality higher education.



	14)	Not only are the meetings of BOT of the same nature as instruction, research, and extension, but they are integral, indispensable and inseparable from the instruction, research and extension programs of the university or college. Programs for instruction, research or extension are necessarily the  workings of BOT. These programs are proposed, deliberated upon, refined, and eventually approved during the meetings of the BOT. The effectiveness of their implementation is decided by the BOT. In fact, hardly anything can be undertaken in instruction, research, and extension without the policies and guidelines that must necessarily emanate from the workings of the BOT. Academic programs, as well as other programs in instruction, research, and extension are but the direct and necessary consequences of the administration and policy-making functions of the BOT.



	15)	For appropriations, Section 4(b) of Republic Act No. 8292 provides that a governing board has the power to determine, on its own discretion, how to spend such sums to caryy out the purpose and function of the state university or college. It states:



Section 4. Powers and Duties of Governing Boards – The governing board shall have the following specific powers and duitoes in addition to its general powers of administration and the exercise of all mthe powers granted to the board of directors of a corporation under Section 36 of Batas Pambansa Blg. 68, otherwise known as the Corporation Code of the Philippines:



  X x x 



(b) to receive and appropriate all sums as may be provided, for the support of the university or college in the manner it may determine, in its discretion, to carry out the purposes and functions of the university or college.



	16)	The provisions of RA Nos. 8292 and 9314 have been the legal basis of Management in granting honoraria to BOT members in leiu of per diems. The Batanes State Colege also gives the lowest honoraria to its BOT members compared to other SUCs both in the region and in the entire country.



	17)	Owing to BSC’s its geographical location where the only mode of personnel travel and transportation available is by plane, the payment of honoraria instead of per diem to the College’s Board of Trustees as their compensation in their actual attendance in board meetings, is infinitely more advantageous to BSC as well as the government. This is because the honoraria that the members of the BOT receive is miniscule compared to the expenses that the members of the BOT may claim if they actually charge their airfares and other expenses when they attend BOT meetings. Under the Auditing Code of the Philippines, it is the declared policy of the State that all resources shall be managed, expended and utilized in accordance with law and regulations, with a view to ensuring efficiency, economy and effectiveness in the operations of government.



	18)	As a rejoinder, the Audit Team maintains the decision of the Commision on Audit En Banc that Section 3(c) of Republic Act. No. 8292, in relation to  Rule 4, Section 17 of the Implementing Rules and Regulations, prohibited members of the  Governing Boards (GB) from receiving compensation, only allowing them to be reimbursed for necessary expenses in limited circumstances. Further, the members of GB were only entitled to receive compensation in the form of per diem and reimbursement of actual expenses, if any. They should not be entitled to any other benefit or allowance. The Commission on Audit En Banc also held that they were not entitled payments from special trust funds since their functions were not directly connected with the college’s instructions, research, extensions, and other programs or projects. Although they formulate policies that pertain to instruction, research, and extension projects, the Commission on Audit En Banc noted that this policy making function should not be considered as academic activity similar to those performed by teachers and students. In any case, the Commission on Audit En Banc ruled that the special trust fund should not be used to pay compensation, per diems, or honoraria, citing Benguet State University v.s. Commission on Audit.





10)	The grant of honoraria to the College’s Board of Trustees with an aggregate amount of P107,500.00 were not duly supported with sufficient documents required under COA Circular Nos. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012. Hence, the propriety and legality of the transaction could not be ascertained.



	1)	Section 6 of Presidential Decree No. 1445, otherwise known as the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines states that: “Claims against government funds shall be supported with complete documentation.”



	2)	Consequently, Item 5.7.3 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 enumerates the documentary requirements on the payment of honoraria to governing boards of collegial bodies, as follows:



		--	Appointment / designation as a member of the Board

		--	Certification that the claimant is not an appointee to a regular position in the governing board of the collegial body who receives salaries, regular allowances and other benefits

		--	Minutes of meeting and Attendance Sheet as certified by the Board Secretary



	3)	Review on the payment of honoraria to the College’s Board of Trustees revealed that the following claims for CY 2020 were not duly supported with documentary requirements under item 5.7.3 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012, viz:

	4)	Honoraria having been granted inconsistent with the above provisions are considered irregular expenditures. Hence, compliance to the foregoing requirements is required.



	5)	We recommended that Management submit immediately all the documentary requirements required under COA Circular No. 2012-001 to support the honoraria paid to the College’s Board of Trustees, and to avoid further suspension in audit.



	6)	The Management do not have files on appointments or designation papers by the Regional Directors of NEDA, DOST, and DA, neither the appointment papers of the Presidents of the Faculty Association, Student Council, Alumni Association and the President of the College, “as member of the Board”.



	7)	However, Management requested from the Office of Commissioner Lilian A. De Las Llagas to furnish them a copy of her appointment paper, as Chair of the BSC Board of Trustees, representing the CHED Chair, J. PROSPERO E. DE VERA III. 



	8)	With regard to the certification that the claimants are not appointees to a regular position in the Governing Board of the Collegial Body who receives salaries, regular allowances, and other benefits, these are already submitted.



	9)	Attendance sheets and minutes of meeting conducted by the Board on January 22 and September 7, 2020 only were submitted. However, Management assured the audit team to properly disburse the next entitlements of the BOT members.



	10)	Other required documents shall be submitted once available.





11)	Payment of first salary to the newly-hired and promoted employees of the Batanes State College were not duly supported with the documentary requirements under Item 4.1 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012, hence, the propriety and legality of the transactions could not be ascertained.

		

	1)	Pertinent Section 4.1.1 of COA Circular 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012, prescribing the Revised Guidelines and Documentary Requirements for Common Government Transactions, provides list of documentary requirements for the payment of first salary, to wit:



		--	Certified true copy of duly approved Appointment;

		--	Certified true copy of Oath of Office;

		--	Certificate of Assumption;

		--	Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Net Worth;

		--	Approved DTR;

	2)	Additional Requirements for transferees (from one government office to another)



		--	Clearance from money, property and legal accountabilities from the previous office;

		--	Certified true copy of pre-audited disbursement voucher of last salary from previous agency and/or certification by the agency Chief Accountable of last salary received from previous office duly verified by the assigned auditor thereat;

		--	BIR Form 2316 (Certificate of Compensation Payment/Tax Withheld);

		--	Certificate of Available Leave Credits; and

		--	Service Record.



	3)	Likewise, Section 4.1.3 of the same Circular enumerates documentary requirements on the payment of Salary of Casual/Contractual Personnel, as follows:



--	For accredited agencies by the CSC (for first claim)

		--	Certified true copy of the pertinent contract/appointment/job order;

		--	Copy of the ROPA of the pertinent contract/appointment marked received by the CSC;

		--	Certified true copy of approved appointment in case of promotion or Notice of Salary Adjustment in case of step increment/salary increase;

		--	Certificate of Assumption; and

		--	Approved DTR or certification that the employee has not incurred leave without pay. 



	5)	After review and verification of disbursement/payroll vouchers on the payment of first salary and differential of newly-hired/promoted BSC employees, deficiencies on its supporting documents were noted, therefore, the propriety and legality of the claims could not be ascertained. Details are found in Annex G. Hereunder are the newly-employed/promoted employees of the Batanes State College:

	6)	 In the absence of the requirements enumerated in COA Circular No. 2012-001, the propriety of the payments made to the above newly-hired/promoted employees could not be ascertained.

	

	7)	We recommended that Management submit all the lacking documents required under Section 4 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 on the payment of initial salaries of all concerned newly-hired/promoted BSC employees.



	8)	The Management made partial submission of the required documents.





12)	A total of P108,513.09 audit disallowances issued to the Batanes State College, which has become final and executory and finally issued with corresponding COA Order of Execution (COE), were still unsettled as at December 31, 2020, contrary to Section 23.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009.



	1)	Section 23.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009 prescribing the use of the Rules and Regulations on Settlement of Accounts provides that, COE shall be issued to enforce the settlement of an audit disallowance/charge, whenever the persons liable therefor refuse or fail to settle them after the decision has become final and executory. The COE directs the Cashier/Disbursing Officer to withhold payment of any money due the persons liable.



	2)	On the other hand, Section 3 of the 2009 Revised Rules of Procedure of the Commission on Audit provides that, in the case of failure by the Cashier/Disbursing Officer to comply with the COE, the Auditor shall notify the agency head concerned of the non-compliance. At the same time, the Auditor shall report the matter through the COA Director concerned, to the General Counsel who shall take any or all of the following actions:



a.	Recommend to the Commission Proper to cite defaulting party in contempt;

b.	Refer the matter to the Solicitor General for the filing of appropriate civil suit; and

c.	Refer the case to the Ombudsman for the filing of appropriate administrative or criminal action.



	3)	Copies of COE were issued to the College Cashier on December 27, 2019, however, as at this date, the total amount of P108,513.09 were still outstanding. Summary of these outstanding audit disallowances issued to the College which are already issued with corresponding COEs are hereunder provided:

	4)	 Any delay in complying or refusal to comply with the order or decision of the Commission shall constitute a ground for contempt, and/or administrative disciplinary action against the officer or employee concerned. (Section 7, Rule XIII of the 2009 Revised Rules of Procedure of COA)



	5)	We recommended that Management direct the College Accountant  to look for an avenue to let all persons liable who are already retired/separated from the service or has transferred to other agencies, settle their respective accountabilities.



	6)	The Management immediately directed the concerned College employees especially the Cashier to immediately effect the COE by deducting the  employees’ audit disallowance/charge from their salaries or any other receivables. Incumbent employees  have settled their respective audit disallowances and the remaining balance is attributed to audit disallowances of employees who have been retired/separated from the service and/or transferred to other agencies. Despite that, the Finance and Administrative Services have exerted all possible efforts and attempts in demanding them to settle their respective accountabilities. Communications through mobile phone and electronic mail were made but such efforts proved to be futile. Demand Letters were also sent though registered mail based on available records of the College HRMO. The College Accountant even conducted house visits to retired employees to follow up settlements of their accountabilities. Management assured that they will continue to exert more efforts to ccordinate, follow-up and go after these accountabilities from the concerned former employees of the College.





13)		Three (3) infrastructure projects with a total contract cost of P58,536,067.50 for accomplishment in CY 2020 were not completed within the target date of completion despite approved time extensions, hence, depriving the target beneficiaries from the immediate use of these projects.

		

	1)		Section 17.6 of the Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of R.A. No. 9184, otherwise known as the “Government Procurement Reform Act” states that: “no bidding and award of contract for Infrastructure Projects shall be made unless the detailed engineering investigations, surveys and designs, for the project have been sufficiently carried out and duly approved in accordance with the standards and specifications prescribed by the HoPE concerned or his duly authorized representative, pursuant to the recommendation of the end-user or implementing unit and in accordance with the provisions of Annex “A” of this IRR.”

	

	2)		Item 3 (j) of the Annex A of the same IRR provides the basis of Contract Time or Duration, viz:

	

	 “In the preparation of the Bidding Documents, the agency shall make an estimate of the actual number of working days required to complete the project through PERT/CPM analysis of the project activities and corrected for holidays and weekends. Likewise, the agency shall make an estimate of the number of rainy/unworkable days considered unfavorable for the prosecution of the works at the site, based on the records of the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA), and incorporate the same in the corrected actual number of working days determined above, which shall be made the basis of the total contract time. The estimated number of rainy/unworkable days considered unfavorable for the prosecution of the works at the site shall be made known before the date of bidding through the Instructions to Bidders for the purpose of guiding the contractor in preparing his bid and as reference to both the Government of the Philippines and winning contractors taking action on the requests for time extensions. Without the estimated number of rainy/unworkable days established before the bidding date and made known to all participating bidders, the contract time is presumed to have excluded the unfavorable conditions.”

	

	3)		Moreover, Annex E of RA 9184 provides the following:



	Section 8.1 - Where the contractor refuses or fails to satisfactorily complete the work within the specified contract time, plus any time extension duly granted and is hereby in default under the contract, the contractor shall pay the procuring entity for liquidated damages, and not by way of penalty, an amount, as provided in the conditions of contract, equal to at least one tenth (1/10) of one (1) percent of the cost of the unperformed portion of the works for every day of delay.

	

	Section 8.3 - To be entitled to such liquidated damages, the procuring entity does not have to prove that it has incurred actual damages. Such amount shall be deducted from any money due or which may become due the contractor under the contract and/or collect such liquidated damages from the retention money or other securities posted by the contractor whichever is convenient to the procuring entity.

	

	Section 8.4 - In case the delay in the completion of the work exceeds a time duration equivalent to ten percent (10%) of the specified contract time plus any time extension duly granted to the contractor, the procuring entity concerned may rescind the contract, forfeit the contractor’s performance security and takeover the prosecution of the project or award the same to a qualified contractor through negotiated contract.

	5)		As seen in the above table, all of the three (3) infrastructure projects were not completed as scheduled. Per approved request for extension, incurred delays were due to the implementation of Luzon-wide Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) on March 15, 2020 and unfavorable weather condition. However, revised expiry dates of the two projects appeared to be prior and shortly after implementation of ECQ and still incomplete as of September 30, 2020. These unfinished projects are now providing convenience and benefit to the College should these be implemented on time. Details per projects are found in Annex I.

	Details of payments are found in Annex J.

	

	7)		We recommended that Management  submit Statement of Work Accomplished as at revised expiry dates of each project – Construction of BSC Academic Building, College Dormitory and Agriculture and Fisheries Building, for the imposition of potential liquidated damages pursuant to Section 8 of Annex E of the Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations of R.A. 9184.

	

	8)		According to Management, the Accountant in coordination with the College Project Monitoring and Evaluation Team (PMET) requested from the Contractors the submission of the corresponding SWA as at revised dates of projects completion mentioned. Upon receipt, these will be forwarded immediately to the Commission on Audit for compliance.





14)	Various disbursements in the aggregate amount of P9,029,145.48 were  submitted but not properly supported with documents required under COA Circular 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 and Section 4(6) of PD 1445 hence, the legality and propriety of these transactions could not be ascertained.

	

	1)	Section 4(6) of PD 1445 provides that: “claims against government funds shall be supported with complete documentation”. Consequently, COA Circular 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 amended and updated by COA Circular Nos. 2013-001 and 2016-002 dated January 10, 2013 and May 31, 2016, respectively, prescribes the Revised Guidelines and Documentary Requirements for common government transactions. 



	2)	Complete documentation includes duly accomplished supporting documents e.g. proper signatories, dates, places, names and other vital information and documents as may be required by the nature of the transaction. Sufficient and relevant documents shall establish the validity, legality of the transaction and conformity with laws, rules or regulations.



	3)	 As at December 2020, various transactions in the aggregate amount of P9,029,145.48 were submitted to Commission on Audit with deficiencies/insufficient supporting documents. Details are enumerated in Annex K.



	4)	Submission of deficient documents of prior years were already required for compliance in our prior years’ audit reports, however, still unsettled as at December 31, 2020. 

	

	5)	A gentle reminder that transactions not submitted, of doubtful legality/propriety/regularity, which may result in pecuniary loss of the government, are suspended or disallowed if not satisfactorily complied/explained or validly justified by the concerned employee/s.

	

	6)	We recommended that Management direct those concerned officials and employees to facilitate immediate submission and compliance of the deficiencies/documentary requirements enumerated in the aforecited circular. The Accountant, likewise, be more prudent in scrutinizing each and every document attached to a particular transaction before certifying its completeness prior to disbursement and submission to COA to lessen these deficiencies and lapses noted in audit which may result to possible suspension and/or disallowance.



	7)	The Management directed the Accountant to facilitate immediate compliance of the deficiencies/documentary requirement, reminded and advised to exercise prudence in certifying the completeness of transactions to avoid submission of vouchers with lacking/deficient requirements.



	

15)	Approved Annual Procurement Plan (APP), Project Procurement Management Plan (PPMP) including all its attachments for CY 2020 were not submitted to the Commission on Audit completely and within the prescribed period, contrary to Item 6 of COA Circular No. 2009-002 dated May 18, 2009. Hence, precluded the Audit Team from verifying whether or not the procurement activities of the College are in accordance with the approved APP and/or supplemental APP, if any.





	1)	The Section 7 of R.A. No. 9184 and its revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) mandates the preparation of the APP which should include procurements considered crucial to the efficient discharge of governmental functions. It provides further that no procurement shall be undertaken unless it is in accordance with the approved Annual Procurement Plan (APP) which shall bear the approval of the Head of the Procuring Entity (HOPE) or second ranking official designated by the HOPE to act on his behalf. 



	2)	Per GPPB Resolution No. 20-2015, the GPPB approved the revised format of the APP to be used by all procuring entities where all of their procurement activities for the year, including the requirements in its APP-CSE, are reflected.



	3)	The APP shall contain the following information, among others:



1.	Name of the project/procurement;

2.	Project Management office/end-user unit;

3.	General description of the project/procurement;

4.	Procurement methods to be adopted;

5.	Time schedule for a) advertisement/posting; b) submission and receipt/opening of bids;  c) award of contract; d) contract signing

6.	Source of funds; and

7.	Approved Budget for the Contract.



	4)	It is further provided in  a DBM Circular Letter No. 2010-09 dated December 30, 2010 that APP is the requisite document that the agency must prepare to reflect the necessary information on the entire procurement activities (i.e., goods, services, civil works to be procured) that it plans to undertake within the calendar year. It is a document that consolidates the various PPMPs submitted by the various end-user units within the Procuring Entity. 



	5)	On the other hand, PPMP refers to the procurement plan of a specific program/project/activity (PAP) of the agency. This shall include information on whether the PAP will be contracted out, implemented by administration or consigned; the type and objectives of contract to be employed; the extent/size of contract scopes/packages, the procurement methods to be adopted, time schedule for each procurement activity and contract implementation, and estimated budget for the general components of the contract. This serves as a guide document in the procurement and contract implementation process, as well as a vital reference in procurement monitoring. It also serves as an important tool in resource and financial Management, allowing the Procurement Entity the flexibility to optimize the utilization of scarce resources. 



	6)	The PPMP shall contain the following information:



	a)	The name of the project/procurement;

	b)	General description of the project/procurement;

	c)	The extent/size of contract scopes/packages;

(This refers to the general description of the lot to be included in a particular contract, i.e. the goods, infrastructure project or services, or a combination of any two or three of these types of procurement, including quantities where applicable.)

d. The procurement methods to be adopted, and indicating if the procurement tasks are to be outsourced as provided in Section 53(e) of the IRR-A;

e. The time schedule for each procurement activity; and 

f.  The BAC.



	7)	All PPMPs shall be consolidated into APP for approval of the agency head. Any changes to the individual PPMPs and consolidated APP may be undertaken every six (6) months or as often as may be required by the Head of the Procuring Entity. These shall be submitted to the GPPB in July of the current year, and in January of the following budget year. 



	8)	In the Entrance Conference Agenda issued to the College on December 18, 2020, among the documents enumerated therein which are vital in the performance of procurement audit are the APP and PPMP. These are likewise required for submission to COA within the first quarter of the year pursuant to Item 6 of COA Circular No. 2009-002 dated May 18, 2009. 



	9)	However, despite issuance of Audit Observation Memorandum pertaining to the non-compliance of the College on the timely submission of the required APP/PPMP for CY 2019 and immediately preceding years, the College still failed to comply with the regulations for the calendar year 2020. But for the sake of compliance, incomplete copies of APPs including attachments for CY 2020 were submitted on January 11, 2021, hence, defeats the very purpose for which it should be prepared and submitted. Such failure precluded the Audit Team to immediately verify whether the procurements undertaken by the College are in accordance with the approved APP/PPMP. 



	10)	Listed hereunder are among the approved contracts/purchase orders undertaken by the agency which have been furnished to the Office of the Auditor for CY 2020 which could not be verified due to the absence of the required APP/PPMT and its attachments:

	11)	This is a reiteration of prior year’s audit observation.



	12)	We recommended that Management require the concerned agency officials/personnel to submit immediately the complete copy of approved APP and any supplemental thereto, including the PPMP and all its attachments for CY 2020 and henceforth, to submit the same within the first quarter of each calendar year to facilitate simultaneous review of procurement activities with the disbursements undertaken by the College.



	13)	The Bids and Awards Committee through its Secretariat was instructed to comply with the herein observation by submitting the APP for CY 2020 including supplemental to that effect.





Gender and Development



16)	GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) of the College for CY 2020 has been reviewed and approved by the Philippine Commission on Women (PCW). Actual results per GAD Accomplishment Report disclosed a total cost of P932,393.17 incurred in the implementation of GPB and out of the nine (9) gender issues planned and budgeted during the year, six (6) were addressed, one (1) was partially done and the remaining two (2) gender issues were still for implementation (Annex L). 





Compliance with Tax Laws



17)	Details on taxes withheld and remitted  for CY 2020 could not be verified due to the non-availability of subsidiary records that should be maintained by the Acoountant. Hence, unremitted taxes of P4,295,039.05 presented in the Financial Statement as Due to BIR could not be ascertained, contrary to Joint Circular No. 1-2000A dated July 31, 2001 of the Department of Finance, Department of Budget and Management and the Commission on Audit, and Section 5.116(B) of Revenue Regulation 2-98. 



	1)	Under DOF-DBM Joint Circular No. 1-2000A dated July 31, 2001 which prescribes the procedure for the remittance of all taxes withheld by the National Government Agencies (NGA) to the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR), an NGA shall file before the BIR a Tax Remittance Advice (TRA) supported by withholding tax returns on or before the 10th day of the following month after the said taxes had been withheld. 



	2)	Moreover, Section 5.116 of Revenue Regulation 2-98 prescribes the Withholding of Percentage Tax which states that: “Bureaus, offices and instrumentalities of the government, including government-owned or controlled corporations as well as their subsidiaries, provinces, cities and municipalities making any money payment to private individuals, corporations, partnerships and/or associations are required to deduct and withhold the taxes due from the payees on account of such money payments. 



	3)	Item B of the same Section likewise states that: “No money payments shall be made by any government office or agency unless the taxes due thereon shall have been deducted and withheld. Taxes deducted and withheld shall be covered by the Monthly Return of Internal Revenue Taxes withheld on Government Money Payments (BIR Form 1600) in duplicate to be filed and the tax to be paid to the Authorized Agent Bank located within the Revenue District Office (RDO) having jurisdiction over the place where the government office is located. In places where there are no authorized agent bank, the return shall be filed directly with the Revenue District Officer, Collection Officer or the duly authorized Treasurer of the City or Municipality where the government office is located except in cases where the Commissioner otherwise permits. The required return shall be filed and payments made within ten (10) days following the end of the month the withholding was made.”



	4)	Verification could not be made on the following balances of unremitted taxes totalling to P4,295,039.05 presented in the Financial Statements as at December 31, 2020:

	5)	Constant disregard of the BIR regulations requiring immediate remittance of taxes withheld will result to accumulation and increase of liabilities of the College and deprive the government on the revenue/income and utilization thereof for the implementation of its various programs/projects.



	6)	We recommended that Management cause the immediate remittance of the accumulated taxes withheld and thereafter, taxes withheld shall be remitted on or before the 10th day of the month following the month of withholding, except for taxes withheld for the month of December which shall be filed/remitted on or before the 15th day of the first month of the succeeding year; and ensure that any penalties imposed by the BIR due to late remittances shall be borne by responsible officials of the College and not by the government.





Remittance of GSIS Premium Contributions



18)	GSIS premiums were consistently deducted from the salaries of the BSC officials and employees, however, discrepancies amounting to P534,025.12 were noted on the balance still due to the GSIS as reported by the College Accountant and the Cashier, respectively, as at December 31, 2020.



	1)	Section 14.1 of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of R.A 8291 requires each government agency to remit directly to the GSIS, the employees’ and government agency’s contributions within the first ten (10) days of the calendar month following the month to which the contributions apply. The remittance by the government agency of the contributions to the GSIS shall take priority over and above the payment of any and all obligations, except salaries and wages of its employees.



	2)	In compliance with Section 6 (b) of RA No. 8291, or the GSIS Act of 1997 on the remittance of compulsory contributions, the BSC has consistently remitted the deductions from employee’s salary of the premiums and other contributions, as well as salary loans to the GSIS which amounted to P3,653,224.88 (per report of the Cashier) for the calendar year 2020 leaving an unremitted amount of P87,239.97 at year-end, details are shown below:

	3)	However, verification of the Financial Statements disclosed a balance of unremitted amount of P621,265.09 reported under the Due to GSIS Account, as at year-end. 



	4)	The Accountant was asked to provide the related Ledger to facilitate verification and reconciliation, however, failed to provide the same.



	5)	We recommended that Management instruct the College Accountant and the Cashier to reconcile their records and furnish the Audit Team a copy of the reconciling items and/or corrections/adjustments.





Status of Total Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges



19)	Audit suspensions and disallowances amounting to P1,398,713.33 and P176,734.10, respectively, were remained unsettled as at December 31, 2020, contrary to COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009 and COA Resolution No. 2015-031 dated August 20, 2015, as amended, which prescribed the Rules and Regulations on Settlement of Accounts. 

	

	1)	COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009 prescribing the use of the Rules and Regulations on Settlement of Accounts (RRSA) provides the following:



--	Section 7.1.1  “The Head of the Agency, who is primarily responsible for all government funds and property pertaining to his agency, shall ensure that: (a) the required financial and other reports and statements are submitted by the concerned agency officials in such form and within the period prescribed by the Commission; (b) the settlement of disallowances and charges is made within the prescribed period; (c) the requirements of transactions suspended in audit are complied with; and (d) appropriate actions are taken on the deficiencies noted as contained in the AOM.”

	

--	Section 7.2.1 “The Chief Accountant, Bookkeeper of other authorized official performing accounting and/or bookkeeping functions of the audited agency shall ensure that: the audit suspensions, disallowances and charges including their settlements, are properly monitored.”

	

--	Section 9.4  “A suspension should be settled within ninety (90) calendar days from receipt of the NS, otherwise the transaction covered by it shall be disallowed/charged after the Auditor shall have satisfied himself that such action is appropriate. Consequently, the Auditor shall issue the corresponding ND/NC.”



--	Section 10.4 “The disallowance shall be settled within six (6) months from receipt of the Notice of Disallowance (ND) by the persons liable.”



--	Section 17.1 “Any person aggrieved by a disallowance or charge may within six (6) months from receipt of the notice, appeal in writing as prescribed in these Rules. A disallowance or charge not appealed within the period prescribed shall become final and executory.”

		

	2)	Likewise, the same Circular provides the following provisions by which settlements should be made, viz:

		

--	Section 13.1.1 “A suspension shall be settled by the submission of the justification/explanation and/or documentation required under an NS and after the Auditor becomes satisfied that the transaction is regular/legal/proper and that no loss was suffered by the government. If the Auditor is not satisfied with the justification/explanation and/or documentation submitted, he shall issue corresponding ND/NC.”



--	Section 13.1.2 “A disallowance or charge shall be settled by payment of the amount disallowed or by such other applicable modes of extinguishment obligation as provided by law. In the case of the latter modes, the Auditor may refer to the General Counsel, for evaluation and advice, on the propriety of the settlement.”



--	Section 13.1.3 “Settlement of Disallowance or charge may also result from a decision of the Director, Adjudication and Settlement Board or the Commission Proper, lifting the disallowance or charge.” 

			

	3)		However, it has been a recurring practice of the Management to settle their respective disallowances on installment basis without the authority required under COA Resolution No. 2015-031 dated August 20, 2015 which has been issued to prescribe additional policies on settlement of audit disallowances considering the need to set a uniform guideline on requests for settlement of audit disallowances on installment basis by person liable, to wit:

	

1)	Only disallowed salaries and personal benefits, allowances or emoluments classified under the expenditure item of Personal Services shall be allowed to be settled by installment payment under the following schedule:



Amount of Disallowance

Maximum Number of Monthly Installment Payments

Not exceeding P1,000.00

Three (3)

Above P1,000.00 up to P10,000

Six (6)

Above P10,000.00 up to P20,000.00

Twelve (12)

Above P20,000.00 up to P40,000.00

Eighteen (18)

Above P40,000.00 up to P60,000.00

Twenty-four (24)

Above P60,000.00 up to P100,000.00

Thirty-six (36)

Above P100,000.00 up to P150,000.00

Forty-eight (48)

Above P150,000.00

Sixty (60)



2)	The monthly payment shall be deducted from the salary of the person liable, subject to the minimum take home pay requirement under the General Appropriations Act. Any deficiency in the installment payment for a given month after effecting the salary deduction shall be paid directly by the person liable to the Agency Cashier within five (5) days after the due date of the installment payment.



3)	Request for installment payment may be made directly by the persons liable to settle their liabilities. For audit disallowances involving several persons liable, the head of the agency or its authorized official may request installment payment in their behalf, provided that a written authority is issued by the persons liable and attached to the request. Only those persons liable with written authority shall be allowed to settle their liability in installment.



4)	All settlements of liabilities, whether in full or by installment, shall be paid in cash to the Cashier/Treasurer of the concerned government agency where the audit disallowances were issued and the receivable accounts were recorded.



5)	Appointive officials and employees who shall be separated from the service for whatever reason shall not be cleared from money and property accountabilities by the agency heads or their authorized representatives and shall not be issued the corresponding clearances unless their audit disallowances have been settled.



6)	For persons liable who are already separated from the service for whatever reason upon finality of the COA Decision of Notice of Disallowance, or upon issuance of Notice of Finality of Decision or COA Order of Execution, their liability should be paid in full to the agency cashier.



7)	All requests for installment payment shall be submitted to and reviewed by the Prosecution and Litigation Office (PLO), Legal Service Sector (LSS), through the concerned Auditors and Cluster/Regional Directors, with appropriate comment, recommendation, proposed installment schedule, and supporting documents. Upon due evaluation, the PLO Director shall approve/grant the request for installment payment strictly in accordance with the schedule provided, which shall be effective immediately upon receipt thereof. Any deficient request shall be returned immediately to the requesting party, through the concerned Auditors and Cluster/Regional Directors.

		 

	4)	Unfortunately, persons liable who are already separated from the service have not yet settled their respective disallowances despite issuance of NFD and COE. As per submitted Agency Action Plan and Status of Implementation, Management scheduled to issue corresponding demand letters before the end of July 2020 but to date, no copy has been furnished to the Office of the Auditor. 



	5)	Evaluation of the agency’s compliance with audit suspensions and disallowances showed a total settlements of P614,919.17 or P444,569.90 and P170,349.27 settled audit suspensions and disallowances, respectively, during the year as illustrated below:

	6)		Moreover, evaluation of documents submitted in compliance to the Notice of Suspension No. 2012-043-200-(12) dated August 29, 2012, original copy of the official receipt on the payment of fare and other incidental travel expenses totalling to P22,750.00 shall be submitted to fully settle the said suspension. 

	

	7)		On the other hand, Management’s exerted efforts in settling all these long outstanding disallowances and suspensions are well appreciated, however, it is highly encouraged to strictly follow the prescribed procedures on future settlements to promote uniform guideline and fair treatment/application to all concerned accountable persons.



	8)	Details of all outstanding audit suspensions and disallowances as at December 31, 2020 are herein attached as Annex M (Status of Issued Notices of Disallowances) and Annex N (Status of Issued Notices of Suspensions).



	9)	We recommended that  Management  submit copies of the demand letters issued to all liable persons as indicated in the submitted AAPSI and enforce immediate settlement of all outstanding disallowances which have become final and executory as well as compliance to all requirements of all transactions suspended in audit to avoid maturity into a disallowance.



	10)	The Management directed the Accountant to consolidate all demand letters to COA for further action. Concerned employees with pending Notices of Suspension are likewise required to submit all requirements for settlement of transactions suspended in audit.
