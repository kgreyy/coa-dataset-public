C)	Auditor’s Opinion on the Financial Statements



The Auditor rendered a modified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the financial statements of the Batanes State College as of December 31, 2020 due to the following exceptions noted:



a)	Unreliability of PPE accounts totaling to P82,572,993.37 representing 84% of the Agency’s total assets, as a result of the significant discrepancies  in the reported PPE balances in the Financial Statements compared with the Report on Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE), unverified increases for CY 2020, unestablished accountability and control over the PPEs, and un-updated Property Cards (PCs) and PPE Ledger Cards (PPELC); 



b)	Discrepancies totaling P2,472,826.67 noted between the reported balances of Cash in Bank, Local Currency Current Account (LCCA) and Cash–MDS, Special Account in the Financial Statements and the credit balances provided by the Landbank of the Philippines, Basco Branch with total amounts of P19,295,970.57 and 21,768,797.24, respectively, as at December 31, 2020; 



c)	Discrepancies totaling P27,507,480.86 were noted in the Statement of Cash Flows (SCF) particularly on the Collection of Service and Business Income, increases in PPE and CIP, vis-à-vis Financial Performance and Position of the Agency, thereby affecting the reliability of the related accounts. Likewise, the reported balance of Cash and Cash Equivalents Account in the SCF and Financial Position could not be ascertained due to noted discrepancy of P5,627,842.20; and



d)	The accuracy and validity of Payable Accounts totaling P42,686,994.33 presented in the Financial Statements could not be ascertained due to the non-availability of General/Subsidiary Ledgers for verification, contrary to Sections 111 and 114 of PD 1445 and Sections 12 and 33, Chapters 2 and 19, respectively, of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for NGAs Volume I.



D)	Significant Observations and Recommendations



Among the other significant observations and recommendations are the following:



1)	A total of P108,513.09 audit disallowances issued to the Batanes State College, which has become final and executory and finally issued with corresponding COA Order of Execution (COE) were still unsettled as at December 31, 2020, contrary to Section 23.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009.



We recommended that Management direct the Accountant to look for an avenue to let all persons liable who are already retired/separated from the service or has transferred to other agencies, settle their respective accountabilities.



2)	Three (3) infrastructure projects with a total contract cost of P58,536,067.50 for accomplishment in CY 2020 were not completed within the target date of completion despite approved time extensions, hence, depriving the target beneficiaries from the immediate use of these projects.



We recommended Management to submit Statement of Work Accomplished as at revised expiry dates of each project – Construction of BSC Academic Building, College Dormitory and Agriculture and Fisheries Building for the imposition of potential liquidated damages pursuant to Section 8 of Annex E of the Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations of R.A. 9184.



3)	There are items inappropriately debited/credited to the account Advances to Officers and Employees which yielded a negative balance of P23,205.72, affecting the fair presentation of the account in the Financial Statements to include the total cash advances of P515,635.98 which were long overdue and already forwarded to the Office of the Ombudsman for appropriate action.



We recommended that Management require the College Accountant to revisit the journal entries made and draw the necessary adjustments/reclassification on the account Advances to Officers and Employees to reflect the correct balance in the Financial Statements.



4)	Advances for Payroll amounting to P648,446.49 remained unliquidated as at December 31, 2020, contrary to COA Circular 97-002 dated February 7, 1997, thus, exposing government funds to risk of misuse or loss.



We recommended that Management require all cash advances granted to officers/employees be fully liquidated at year-end, pursuant to the provisions of COA Circular No. 97-002 pertaining to the granting, utilization and liquidation of cash advances.



5)	The grant of honoraria to the College’s Board of Trustees with an aggregate amount of P107,500.00 was inconsistent with the rules prescribed by DBM Circular No. 2003-6 and COA Circular No. 2002-022 dated September 29, 2003 and April 4, 2000, respectively. 



We recommended that Management to henceforth pay the College’s Board of Trustees in the form of per diem as their compensation in their actual attendance in board meetings and charging the same against the amount appropriated for the purpose in the General Appropriations Act of the College.  





E)	 Gender and Development



GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) of the College for CY 2020 has been reviewed and approved by the Philippine Commission on Women (PCW). Actual results per GAD Accomplishment Report disclosed a total cost of P932,393.17 incurred in the implementation of GPB and out of the nine (9) gender issues planned and budgeted during the year, six (6) were addressed, one (1) was partially done and the remaining two (2) gender issues were still for implementation.



F)	Compliance with Tax Laws



Details on taxes withheld and remitted for CY 2020 could not be verified due to the non-availability of subsidiary records that should be maintained by the Accountant. Hence, unremitted taxes of P4,295,039.05 presented in the Financial Statement as Due to BIR could not be ascertained, contrary to Joint Circular No. 1-2000A dated July 31, 2001 of the Department of Finance, Department of Budget and Management and the Commission on Audit, and Section 5.116(B) of Revenue Regulation 2-98.
