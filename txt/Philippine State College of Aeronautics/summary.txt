EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
  

A. Introduction  
 

The Philippine State College of Aeronautics (PhilSCA) was established in 1967 as 

a community college, the Basa Air Base Community College, in Floridablanca, 

Pampanga. The College was operated under the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) 

Regulations Series of 168-342 issued by the AFP and approved by the Department of 

National Defense (DND) on April 1, 1968 to cater to the educational needs of the military 

personnel, civilian employees and their dependents. In 1977, then President Ferdinand 

Marcos signed Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1078 converting Basa Air Base Community 

College into a full-fledged College and was renamed Philippine Air Force College of 

Aeronautics (PAFCA). On June 3, 1992, Republic Act (RA) No. 7605 was approved by 

then President Corazon C. Aquino, converting PAFCA into a state college known as the 

PhilSCA. It has four Campuses located in Mactan, Cebu; Floridablanca, Pampanga; Lipa 

City, Batangas; and the main campus in Villamor Air Base (VAB), Pasay City. 

 

The College aims to provide professional and advanced technical and 

technological instructions and trainings in the fields of aeronautical sciences and in the 

general area of science and technology for the Philippine Air Force (PAF) and the airline 

industries.   

 

The administration and management of PhilSCA is vested in the Board of 

Trustees (BOT) as the governing body of the College under Section Nos. 5 and 11 of RA 

No. 7605, composed of the following:

D. Scope of Audit 
 

The audit covered the review of accounts and operations of PhilSCA and its 

Campuses for CY 2020.  It was conducted to:  a) ascertain the level of assurance that may 

be placed on Management’s assertions on the financial statements; b) determine the 

propriety of transactions as well as the extent of compliance with applicable laws, rules 

and regulations; and c) determine the extent of implementation of prior years’ audit 

recommendations. 

 



 

 

 

 
v 

E. Independent Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements 
 

The Auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the 

financial statements of the PhilSCA for CY 2020 for reasons stated in the Independent 

Auditor’s Report in Part I, which are discussed in detail in Part II of the Report. 

F. Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations 
 

The significant observations and recommendations, among others, as discussed 

with Management and detailed in Part II of the Report are as follows: 

 

1. Total misstatements of ₱18,557,708.82 in Cash in Bank – Local Currency Current 
Account (LCCA), Due from NGAs, Inventories, Prepayments,  Liabilities, and 

Expenses accounts resulting from errors, omissions and improper accounting 

treatment of transactions as of December 31, 2020 exceeded the materiality 

threshold of ₱2,550,257.72, hence the accuracy, completeness, cut-off and 

classification of the said accounts could not be relied upon, thereby affecting the 

fair presentation of the Financial Statements (FSs). (Observation No. 1) 

 

We recommended that Management,  

 

a. thru the Accountant, effect the necessary adjustments to correct the 
misstatements in the accounts affected; 

 

For Cash in Bank – Local Currency Current Account  

 

b. provide the Audit Team with a copy of the legal basis for opening and 
maintaining the SHS VP bank account within five days  from receipt 

hereof; 

 

c. determine the necessity of SHP VP account’s continued existence and 
consider the immediate closure if no longer needed;  and 

 

For Due from NGAs 

 

d. submit supporting documents for the recorded receivables amounting 
to ₱1,153,600.00, otherwise prepare JEV to adjust the previously 

recorded accounting entry; 

 

            For Liabilities 

 

e. analyze,  reconcile  and make the necessary adjusting entry to correct 
the  discrepancies of  P2,026,441.07 noted in the audit of the previous 

and current years; and 

 

f. reconcile regularly  the monthly withholding and remittances of taxes 
to ensure proper and accurate recording and avoid errors 



 

 

 

 
vi 

 

2. Non-restatement of the material Prior Period Adjustments (PPAs) in the CY 2020 FSs 
with a total amount of ₱3,971,899.38 adversely affected the fair presentation of the 

comparative FSs contrary to the provisions of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I and the 

IPSAS. (Observation No. 2) 

 

We recommended that Management: 

 

a. comply with the retrospective application of the PPAs by restating the 
2019 FSs as stated in IPSAS 1 and 3 in reference to Sections 42, 44 and 

46, Chapter 19 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I; 

 

b. use the prescribed format provided in Section 45, Chapter 19 of the 
GAM for NGAs, Volume I for proper procedures and disclosures of 

Retrospective Restatement of Errors; and 

 

c. provide the supporting details of the prior period adjustments showing 
the specific accounts affected and present them in the Notes to FSs. 

 

3. Unresolved variances and huge discrepancies between PhilSCA’s Accounting 
records and their supporting schedules/documents and unsubstantiated balances 

were noted which affected the reliability of the Cash in Bank – LCCA and 

Accounts Receivable accounts totaling ₱524,076,604.95 as at December 31, 2020, 

contrary to Section 6.e, Chapter 19 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I. 

(Observation No. 4) 

 

We recommended that Management resolve the variances and/or 

discrepancies in the PhilSCA accounting records and provide supporting 

schedules in accordance with the aforementioned criteria. 

 

4.  The audit of Special Trust Fund (STF) budget revealed a) inconsistencies in the 
budgeted amounts in the submitted Financial Accountability Reports (FARs) 

against the FY 2020 Program of Receipts and Expenditures (PRE), with a 

difference of P24,206,555.60; and b) significant amount of unutilized budget of 

₱132,842,757.77 or 39 percent of the total STF budget of ₱342,001,890.11, thus 

affected the efficiency and effectiveness of the College’s operations that deferred 

the benefits of modernized facilities and equipment for the students. (Observation 

No. 5) 

 

We recommended that Management: 

 

a. ensure that the BOT Resolution approving the College’s PRE indicates the 
amount of the approved budget; 

 

b. submit justification on the inconsistencies of the FY 2020 budget presented 
in the PRE and the FARs; 



 

 

 

 
vii 

 

c. prepare a more realistic budget by considering the needs and capability of 
the College to disburse the same, and maximize the utilization thereof for 

the effective implementation of planned programs/projects; and 

 

d. ensure the consistency of the disclosed budget between the approved PRE 
and the SABUDB (FAR No. 2)/ SABUDBOE (FAR No. 2-A) to ensure the 

reliability and validity of the submitted reports. 

 

5.  Out of the ₱3,000,000.00 fund transfer from CHEDRO- NCR for the 
implementation of the Tulong Dunong Program (TDP), a total of ₱636,000.00 

was not utilized/released to the student-grantees by PhilSCA, thereby adversely 

affecting the educational needs of the underprivileged yet qualified and deserving 

student-grantees, contrary to the Joint CHED-DBM issuances on the Program. 

Also, the copy of Memorandum of Agreement (MOA), as vital basis for the 

evaluation of Program implementation was not submitted to the Audit Team.   

(Observation No. 6) 

 

We recommended that Management: 

 

a. furnish the Audit Team with the copy of the liquidation of the remaining 
unreleased TDP financial assistance amounting to ₱636,000.00; and 

 

b. submit the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with CHEDRO- NCR 
for the implementation of the TDP as reference in audit. 

 

6. Lapses in the implementation of the TES-ESGPPA for AYs 2018-2019 and 2019-
2020 were noted such as: a) non-compliance of the College with its 

responsibilities in the implementation of the Program; b) non-issuance of  Official 

Receipts (ORs) for funds received from CHED totaling ₱3,563,800.00; and c) 

unreleased educational assistance to the student-grantees amounting to 

₱4,781,800.00  contrary to CHED-UniFAST Memorandum Circular No. 2018-

0001 dated March 26, 2018 and CHED-UniFAST-DBM Joint Memorandum 

Circular No. 07, s. 2019 dated December 27, 2019, thus hampered the timely 

receipt of benefits that could have financially assisted the grantees (Observation 

No. 7). 

 

We recommended that Management: 

 

a. issue ORs for the funds received from CHED totaling ₱3,563,800.00 and 
furnish the COA Office copies of the ORs; 

 

b. release the financial assistance amounting to ₱4,781,800.00 to the 
qualified student-grantees of PhilSCA and furnish the Audit Team the 

copies of Fund Utilization Reports; 

 



 

 

 

 
viii 

c. maintain a separate bank account with the LBP, for proper account 
management of TES funds. 

 

7.  The minimal utilization of the budget for research projects, programs and 
activities of only ₱34,285.48 or less than one percent of the ₱5,083,027.91 

allocated budget, defeated the goals and objectives of the College to establish 

research culture by promoting and enhancing research awareness among faculty 

members and students and to conduct relevant and high impact researches in the 

fields of Aeronautical education (Observation No. 14) 

 

We recommended that Management: 

 

a. activate the research function of the College thru the implementation of 
the budgeted and programmed  research projects and activities in line 

with its objective of  promoting  and enhancing  research awareness 

and developing  high impact researches in the fields of aeronautical 

education; and 

 

b. submit relevant supporting documents on the research-related expenses 
amounting to ₱34,285.48 to preclude the issuance of a Notice of 

Suspension/Notice of Disallowance by COA. 

 

The foregoing audit observations and recommendations were communicated 

through Audit Observation Memoranda (AOM) and discussed during the Exit Conference 

with concerned PhilSCA officials and employees on May 13, 2021. Their comments were 

incorporated in this Annual Audit Report (AAR), where appropriate. 

 

G. Status of Settlement of Audit Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges 
 

As at December 31, 2020, the PhilSCA has unsettled suspensions and 

disallowances of ₱5,613,243.11 and ₱30,201,916.26, respectively. Details are discussed 

in Part II of this Report. 

 

H. Status of Implementation of Prior Years’ Audit Recommendations
