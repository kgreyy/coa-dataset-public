PART II – OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

 

FINANCIAL AUDIT 

Accounting Errors/Omissions and Other Accounting Deficiencies 
 
1. Total misstatements of ₱18,557,708.82 in Cash in Bank – Local Currency, Current 

Account (LCCA), Due from NGAs, Inventories, Prepayments,  Liabilities, and 

Expenses accounts resulting from errors, omissions and improper accounting 

treatment of transactions as of December 31, 2020 exceeded the materiality 

threshold of ₱2,550,257.72, hence the accuracy, completeness, cut-off and 

classification of the said accounts could not be relied upon, thereby affecting the 

fair presentation of the financial statements (FSs). 

 
1.1 Section 27 of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) 1 

and Section 15, Chapter 2, Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for 
National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I, states that “The financial 
statements (FS) shall present fairly the financial position, financial 
performance and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful 
representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in 
accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, 
revenue, and expenses set out in IPSAS. The application of IPSAS, with 
appropriate disclosures, if necessary, would result in fair presentation of the 
FS.” 
 

1.2 Also, Chapter 19 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, provides: 
 

“Section 4- The responsibility for the fair presentation and reliability of 
financial statements rests with the management of the reporting entity, 
particularly the head of finance/accounting office and the head of entity 
or his authorized representative.” 

 
1.3 Section 111 Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 requires agencies to keep 

accounts in such detail as necessary to meet the needs of the agency and at the 
same time be adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or control 
agencies of the government; and that the highest standard of honesty, 
objectivity and consistency shall be observed in the keeping of accounts to 
safeguard against inaccurate or misleading information. 
 

1.4 Section 112 of the same Decree requires that each government agency shall 
record its financial transactions and operations conformably with generally 
accepted accounting principles and in accordance with pertinent laws and 
regulations.

1.6 The concept of materiality is applied in evaluating the effect of identified 
misstatement or omission in the FSs. The overall materiality threshold of 
₱2,550,257.72 is set on one percent of the total Current Operating Expenses of 
₱255,025,772.70 per Statement of Financial Performance for the year ended 
December 31, 2020. 
 

1.7 Misstatements found in the audit of the FSs of the PhilSCA which the 
Management did not adjust in their books as of December 31, 2020 are 
presented and discussed in detail as follows:

1.8 We recommended that Management, thru the Accountant, effect the 
necessary adjustments to correct the misstatements in the accounts 

affected. 
 

1.9 The detailed discussion of the causes of misstatements and corresponding 
recommendations are presented in the succeeding paragraphs. 

 

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS 

 

a) Unrecorded cash balance of SHS VP bank account and Payroll Fund amounting to 
₱5,742,681.02 

 
1.10 To ensure that financial information are reliable, accurate and reported within 

the given accounting period, sound internal control on cash and bank accounts 
require prompt and correct recording and reporting of transactions. 
 

1.11 Section 74 of PD No. 1445 provides that “At the close of each month, 
depositories shall report to the agency head, in such form as he may direct, the 
condition of the agency account standing on their books.  The head of the 
agency shall see to it that a reconciliation is made between the balance shown 
in the reports and the balance found in the books of the agency.” 
 

1.12 Bank Reconciliation is the settlement of differences contained in the Bank 
Statement and the Cash account in the agency’s/entity’s books of accounts.  
Under Section 3, Chapter 21 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume 1, the objectives 
of the preparation of BRS are: to check correctness of both the bank’s and 
agency’s/entity’s records, to serve as a deterrent to fraud, and to enable the 
agency/entity or bank to take up charges or credits recognized by the bank or 
agency/entity but not yet known to the agency/entity or bank. 
 

1.13 Sections 5 to 7, Chapter 21 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I provide that the 
Chief Accountant/Designated Staff shall prepare the BRS within 10 days after 
receipt of the monthly bank statement.  It shall be prepared in four copies and 
distributed to COA Auditor, Head of the Agency, Accounting Division/Unit 
file and Bank, if necessary.  Then, they “shall prepare JEV to recognize all 
reconciling items that require adjustment and correction in the books of 
accounts.” 
 

1.14 Section 2, Chapter 2, General Provisions, Basic Standards and Policies of the 
same Manual requires the Subsidiary Ledger (SL) as one of the books of 
accounts and registries of the National Government entities.  The SL shows the 
details for each control account in the GL which is maintained per account and 
fund cluster by the Accounting Division/Unit. 
 

1.15 The totals of the SL balances shall be reconciled with the corresponding GL 
controlling account.  At the end of the year, each SL shall be ruled and closed.  



41 
 

All totals shall be written legibly in ink and the balance of the account carried 
forward as the opening balance. 
 

1.16 The account Cash in Bank - LCCA maintained with the Landbank of the 
Philippines (LBP)-Villamor Airbase, Pasay City Branch has a reported balance 
of ₱499,598,939.20 as of yearend. 
 

1.17 The table below shows the comparative balances of the bank accounts per bank 
confirmation inquiry with the LBP, per submitted BRS by the Accounting 
Office and per GL as of December 31, 2020.

1.18 Bank confirmation inquiry revealed the existence of PhilSCA’s SHS VP bank 

account with the LBP amounting to ₱5,650,825.79, which was not recorded in 
the books and not presented in its Cash in Bank-LCCA at year-end balances 
due to the delayed preparation and submission of Bank Reconciliation 
Statements (BRS), rendering the reported balances in the FSs inaccurate and 
unreliable, contrary to Section 74 of PD No. 1445 and the pertinent provisions 
of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I.  
 

1.19 On February 1, 2016, PhilSCA was granted DepED Government Permit (NCR) 
No. SHS-0050, s. 2016 as provisional permit to operate the senior high school 
program with STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) and 
ABM (Accountancy and Business Management) Strands of the Academic 
Track effective for School Year (SY) 2016-2017. 

 
1.20 On August 5, 2016, the College has opened an LBP Account for PhilSCA 

Senior High School (SHS) Voucher Payments as provided under DepED Order 
No. 46, series of 2015 with an opening balance of ₱10,000.00 as authorized 
and approved on the 3rd Special Meeting of the Board of Trustees (BOT) for 
FY 2016. 



42 
 

1.21 All DepEd voucher payments and collected fees from the non-qualified 
voucher recipients (non-QVRs) or students not covered by DepEd vouchers in 
the PhilSCA SHS Department shall be deposited in the said SHS VP account. 
 

1.22 In a BOT’s Special Meeting held on August 17, 2016, the fifteen (15) Contract 
of Service and five (5) part-time faculty members of the PhilSCA-SHS First 
Semester Academic Year 2016-2017 were approved and were paid 
immediately. In consideration of the delay of DepEd payments, their salaries 
shall be charged to the local income of the College, subject to reimbursement 
and/or repayment through transfer of account upon receipt of the voucher 
payments from the DepEd subject to the usual accounting and auditing rules 
and regulations. 
 

1.23 Subsequently, the Audit Team has requested for a copy of the legal basis for 
the opening and maintaining SHS VP account. 

 
1.24 Despite non-set up of the account in the books, the Accounting Office has 

prepared the monthly BRS of the SHS VP account. Upon scrutiny of the 
submitted monthly BRS from August 2016 to December 2020, movements of 
the account pertain only to receipts from voucher payments from the DepEd 
and collection of fees from Non-QVRs that were credited to the account, 
including the interest income earned. 
 

1.25 However, there was neither a debit made nor any repayment/transfer done with 
the account. As a result, all salaries of the SHS Faculty members and Contract 
of Service (COS) were charged to the local income of the College, contrary to 
the authority approved by the BOT. 

 
1.26 Furthermore, PhilSCA BOT Resolution No. 224 s. 2017 approved on March 

13, 2017 favorably endorsed that the College shall no longer accept incoming 
Grade 11-Senior High School (SHS) students effective SY 2017-2018, in view 
of the predicament of the College to sustain the hired COS faculty members 
due to the delay of the voucher payment from the DepEd and the lack of 
physical facilities like classrooms to be utilized by the SHS pupils. 
 

1.27 With the limited documents gathered by the Audit Team to date, PhilSCA has 
not provided any action or validation with regard to maintaining the SHS VP 
account with the LBP. 
 

1.28 Moreover, the PhilSCA Payroll Fund Account with a bank balance of 
₱91,855.23 was likewise not included in the reported Cash balance in the 
submitted Statement of Financial Position. This has to be adjusted with the 
corresponding Expense account to come up with the correct Cash balance. 
 

1.29 In view of the foregoing, the balance reported in Cash in Bank-LCCA in the 
submitted FSs for CY 2020 was understated by a total of ₱5,742,681.02 for the 



43 
 

two bank accounts rendering the said balance inaccurate and unreliable due to 
the non-preparation and submission of BRS, and non-maintenance of SLs. 
 

1.30 We recommended that Management: 
 

a. provide the Audit Team with a copy of the legal basis for opening and 
maintaining the SHS VP bank account within five days from receipt 

hereof; 

 

b. determine the necessity of SHP VP account’s continued existence and 
consider the immediate closure if no longer needed; and 

 

c. prepare Journal Entry Voucher/s (JEVs) to adjust the misstatements 
of the accounts noted in the audit and furnish a copy to the Audit 

Team. 

 
1.31 Management’s Comment: 

 
The Accounting Office submitted JEV No. GJ Local 21-03-014 dated March 
31, 2021 to adjust the misstatements. 
 

 
RECEIVABLES 

 

b) Erroneous recording and non-adjustment of prior years’ misstatements of Due from 
NGAs – DBM-PS and understatement of Due from NGAs – CHED due to double 
recording and unrecorded school fees 
 
1.32 The Due from NGAs account balance amounting to ₱66,167,048.35 as of 

December 31, 2020 cannot be relied upon due to: a) erroneous recording of 
fund transfers to DBM-PS amounting to ₱928,939.24; b) non-recording of 
delivery made by DBM-PS of ₱660,560.75; c) unreconciled and unadjusted 
prior years’ misstatements amounting to ₱776,098.17; and d) erroneous 
recording of  FHE tuition and miscellaneous fees of ₱6,271,220.00 and 
unsupported receivables due from CHED of ₱1,153,600.00,  contrary to the 
pertinent provisions of GAM for NGAs, Volumes I and III. 
 

1.33 Chapter 3 on the Description of Accounts in the Revised Chart of Accounts 
(RCA), Volume III of GAM for NGAs defines Due from National Government 
Agencies (NGAs) as account used to recognize advances for purchase of 
goods/services as authorized by law, fund transfers to the NGAs for 
implementation of projects and other receivables from NGAs. This account is 
credited upon receipt of goods/services, and liquidation of fund transfers or 
receivables. 
 



44 
 

1.34 Section 2 (a), Chapter 2 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I defines accrual basis 
as “a basis of accounting under which transactions and other events are 
recognized when they occur (and not only when cash or its equivalent is 
received or paid). Therefore, the transactions and events are recognized in the 
accounting records and recognized in the financial statements of the periods to 
which they relate. The elements recognized under accrual accounting are 
assets, liabilities, net assets/ equity, revenue, and expenses.”  
  

1.35 Section 6(b) further states that “Each entity shall recognize and present its 
financial transactions and operations conformably in the accrual basis of 
accounting in accordance with PPSAS (now IPSAS).” 
 

1.36 The balance of the Due from NGAs account should at all times be reconciled 
with the account maintained in the other national agencies where the advances 
or fund transfers were made to ascertain the completeness and accuracy of the 
recorded transactions. 
 

1.37 The Due from NGAs account has a balance of ₱66,167,048.35 as of December 
31, 2020, presented in the following table:

1.40 The erroneous recording of the ₱928,939.24 fund transfers and the non-

recording of the ₱660,560.75 subsequent delivery of supplies and materials, 
overstated the Office Supplies Expenses account and understated the Due from 
NGAs account by a net amount of ₱268,378.49. 
 

1.41 Prior years’ misstatements totaling ₱776,098.17 remained unreconciled and 
unadjusted despite the prior period audit recommendation for adjustment. 
 

ii. Due from NGAs - CHED 
 

1.42 The Due from NGAs-CHED account amounting to ₱64,235,555.00 as of

1.43 The Accounting Office prepared JEV No. GJ Local 20-06-15 dated June 30, 

2020 to recognize Due from NGAs and School Fees account for the 2nd 
Semester AY 2019-2020 FHE (tuition and miscellaneous fees) amounting to 
₱63,081,955.00. 

 
1.44 Subsequent transactions revealed that PhilSCA received the corresponding 

funds amounting to ₱61,197,655.00 under OR No. 0688044 dated November 
10, 2020.  The Accounting Office recorded the receipt of funds under JEV No. 
CRJ 20-11-041 dated November 30, 2020, instead of adjusting the previous 
entry made, thus School Fees account was doubly recorded and Due from 
NGAs account was not adjusted accordingly. 

 
1.45 Also, the Accounting Office did not record the accrual of the FHE tuition and 

miscellaneous fees for 1st Semester, AY 2020-2021 amounting to 
₱70,506,775.00, based on the billing statement submitted to CHED-UniFAST 
on December 3, 2020. 

 
1.46 Further, the Accounting Office was not able to provide supporting documents 

for the receivables due from CHED amounting to ₱1,153,600.00, thus validity 
and reliability of the recorded transaction cannot be ascertained. 
 

1.47 The erroneous and unsupported recording of the Accounting Office for the 
FHE understated both the Due from NGAs account and School Fees account in 
the total amount of ₱6,271,220.00. 
 

1.48 We recommended that Management require the Accounting Office to: 
 

a. prepare JEVs to adjust the misstatement in Due from NGAs account; 
and 

 

b. submit supporting documents for the recorded receivables amounting 
to ₱1,153,600.00, otherwise prepare JEV to adjust the previously 



47 
 

recorded accounting entry. 

 
1.49 Management’s Comment: 

 
The Accounting Office submitted JEV Nos. GJ local 21-02-015 and GJ Local 
21-02-016 both dated March 31, 2021 to partially adjust the misstatements for 
Due from NGAs – CHED. 
 

1.50 Auditor’s Rejoinder: 
 
The Audit Team advised the Management to submit JEVs to fully adjust the 
misstatements and submit supporting documents. 

 
 
OTHER CURRENT ASSETS 

 
c) Erroneous recording of Prepaid Insurance amounting to ₱2,236,383.26                                             

 

1.51 The erroneous recording of insurance premium payments resulted in 
overstatement of Prepaid Insurance account as of yearend amounting to 
₱2,236,383.26 and understatement of insurance expense in the amount of 
₱75,911.34, contrary to the pertinent provisions of GAM for NGAs, Volume I. 
 

1.52 Section 7, Chapter 19 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, states that financial 
statements shall present fairly the financial position, financial performance and 
cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful presentation of 
the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with the 
definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses 
set out in IPSASs. 
 

1.53 The account Prepaid Insurance is defined in Chapter 3 of the GAM for NGAs, 
Volume III, as the account used to recognize the amount advanced for the 
insurance of government properties. This account shall be credited for the 
expended amount. 
 

1.54 As of December 31, 2020, the Prepaid Insurance account has an outstanding 
balance of ₱2,243,294.51, which represents advance payments of insurance for 
the assets and/or interests of the College. 

 
1.55 Analysis revealed that the Accounting Office made erroneous recording in the 

payment of insurance premiums, presented as follows:

in the amounts of ₱75,911.34, ₱189,778.33 and ₱1,970,693.59, respectively. 
 

1.57 The misstatements affected the reliability and fair presentation of the 
PhilSCA’s submitted FSs. 
 

1.58 We recommended that Management, thru the Accounting Office, prepare 
JEVs to correct and adjust the misstatements in the affected accounts to 

reflect the accurate balances. 
 

LIABILITIES 

 

d)  Erroneous recording of the fund transfer from CHED as School Fees instead of Due 
to NGAs and double recording of Cash in Bank (Tulong Dunong Program)  

 

1.59 Section 4.2 of COA Circular No. 94-013 requires that the cash/money 
transferred shall be taken up as a trust liability by the implementing agency. 
 

1.60 Audit of the accounts relative to the implementation of Tulong Dunong 
Program revealed that the Cash in Bank – Local Currency, Current Account 
(LCCA) account and School Fees account were both overstated in the amounts 
of ₱2,364,000.00 and ₱3,000,000.00, respectively, due to erroneous and double 
recording of transactions, presented as follows: 

 
 
 



49 
 

 

1.61 The erroneous and double recording misstated the above-cited accounts and 
affected the reliability of the same accounts in the FSs. 
 

1.62 We recommended that Management prepare the JEV to correct and 
adjust the erroneous /double recording made. 

 

1.63 Management’s Comment: 
 

  The Accounting Office prepared and submitted JEVs to adjust the erroneous 
and double recording made. 
 

e) Unrecorded fund transfer and double/erroneous recording of receipts of TES-
ESGPPA funds from CHED 

 
1.64 Review of the JEVs pertaining to TES-ESGPPA AYs 2018-2019 and 2019-

2020 disclosed that the Accounting Office did not recognize received funds 
amounting to ₱3,563,800.00, while funds totaling ₱4,738,000.00 were 
erroneously recorded as School Fees instead of the appropriate Due to NGAs 
account, presented as follows:

understated Cash in Bank – LCCA and Due to NGAs accounts in the amounts

and Trust Liabilities accounts by ₱4,738,000.00 and ₱3,520,000.00, 
respectively, thus affecting   the reliability of the submitted FSs as of yearend. 

 
1.66 We recommended that Management prepare JEVs to record the 

unrecognized funds received from CHED amounting to ₱3,563,800.00 and 

adjust the erroneous/double recording. 

 
f) Overstatement of Due to GSIS due to erroneous recording of transactions  

 
1.67 The Due to GSIS account amounting to ₱3,051,927.91 as of yearend is 

overstated by ₱2,338,415.79 due to the erroneous recording of 
payments/remittances to GSIS, contrary to the pertinent provisions of GAM for 
NGAs, Volume III, resulting in unreliable balances of the submitted FSs for 
CY 2020. 
 

1.68 GAM for NGAs, Volume III, defines Due to GSIS as an account used to 
recognize the withholding of employees’ premium payments and other 
payables for remittance to the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS). 
The account shall be debited upon remittance of the withheld amount. 
 

1.69 Also, said Manual defines Retirement and Life Insurance Premiums as an 
account used to recognize the government’s share in premium contributions to 
the GSIS and other retirement and life benefits system. The account shall be 
closed to the Revenue and Expense Summary account. 
 

1.70 It likewise defines Employee Compensation Insurance Premiums as an account 
used to recognize the government’s share in premium contributions to the 
Employees’ Compensation Commission (ECC). The account shall be closed to 
the Revenue and Expense Summary account.

1.71 Audit of the JEVs and postings in GL of the Due to GSIS, Retirement and Life 
Insurance and ECI Premiums account for CY 2020 revealed that the 
Accounting Office made erroneous recording and posting in the 
payments/settlements to the mentioned accounts, presented as follows:

1.72 As can be gleaned from the above table, the erroneous recording overstated the 

Retirement and Life Insurance Premiums, Due to GSIS and ECI Premiums in 
the amounts of ₱2,945,626.43, ₱2,338,415.79 and ₱100.00, respectively, while 



52 
 

Interest Expenses and Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) accounts were 
understated by ₱453,128.63 and ₱154,182.01, respectively. 
 

1.73 Moreover, the government share in premiums of PhilSCA for the months of 
April to December 2020, which were remitted by DBM on behalf of PhilSCA 
remained unrecorded in the books. 
 

1.74 The misstatement of the aforementioned accounts, and the non-recording of the 
government share in premiums affected the reliability of the FSs. 
 

1.75 We recommended that Management, thru the Accounting Office, prepare 
the JEV to adjust the misstatements and to record the government share 

in premiums remitted by DBM on behalf of PhilSCA: 
 

1.76 Management’s Comment: 
 
The Accounting Office prepared and submitted the JEVs to adjust the 
misstatements and to record the government share in premiums thru JEV Nos. 
GJ MOOE 21-01-016 to GJ MOOE 21-01-019 all dated April 30, 2021. 

 
g)  Unrecorded reconciling items of Due to BIR account amounting to ₱2,026,441.07 

 
1.77 Recurring errors in the recording of taxes withheld and remitted; and 

over/under-remittance of taxes withheld each year resulted in a net 
unreconciled amount of ₱2,026,441.07 at yearend, hence rendered the year-end 
balance of Due to BIR account of ₱5,322,035.18 unreliable and of doubtful 
validity, contrary to the pertinent provisions of GAM for NGAs, Volume I. 

 
1.78 Audit of the postings in the GL revealed that PhilSCA has withheld taxes in the 

amount of ₱16,996,204.96.  However, audit of the Reports of Checks Issued 
(RCI) and TRA for CY 2020 showed total remittances of ₱16,114,761.04. 

 
1.79 The difference of ₱881,443.92 between the GL balance and the actual 

remittances made represented errors on taxes withheld in both previous and 
current years that were being recorded in the books, but neither remitted to the 
BIR nor accounted for by the Accounting Office for adjustment, if warranted.  
Details are shown in the table below:

1.80 Further analysis of the Due to BIR account which has a year-end balance of 

₱5,322,035.18 resulted in an overstatement of the account in the amount of 
₱2,026,441.07.  Review of the transactions/computations revealed a net 
unreconciled balance, as follows:

1.81 The unreconciled balance for transactions made in CY 2019 amounting to 
₱124,318.81 represented remaining reconciliations presented in last year’s 
audit not yet effected/recorded by the Accounting Office. 
 

1.82 The balance reported in the submitted FSs for CY 2020 of Due to BIR account 
is unreliable and is of doubtful validity due to the discrepancies per audit and 



54 
 

balances reflected per FSs, erroneous recording of taxes withheld for previous 
and current years yet remained unremitted and non-maintenance of SLs. 
 

1.83 We recommended that Management: 
 

a. analyze, reconcile and make the necessary adjusting entry to correct 
the discrepancies of P2,026,441.07 noted in the audit of the previous 

and current years; and 

 

b. reconcile regularly the monthly withholding and remittances of taxes 
to ensure proper and accurate recording and avoid errors.  

 
1.84 Management’s Comments: 

 
The Accounting Office submitted GJ MOOE No. 21-04-015 dated April 30, 
2021 to record partial adjustments on the understatement of the remitted 
withholding taxes amounting to ₱1,351,625.22. 

 
EXPENSES 

 

h) Prior years’ expenses recorded as current year expenses (Liquidation of prior years’ 
cash advances)  

 
1.85 Expenses totaling ₱2,530,611.78 relating to prior years’ cash advances were 

erroneously recorded as current year’s expenses, contrary to Section 2 (a), 
Chapter 2 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, resulting in overstatement of the 
related Expenses account and understating Accumulated Surplus/ (Deficit) 
account. 
 

1.86 Section 2 (a), Chapter 2 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I defines accrual basis 
as “a basis of accounting under which transactions and other events are 
recognized when they occur (and not only when cash or its equivalent is 
received or paid). Therefore, the transactions and events are recognized in the 
accounting records and recognized in the financial statements of the periods to 
which they relate. The elements recognized under accrual accounting are 
assets, liabilities, net assets/ equity, revenue, and expenses.” 
 

1.87 Section 6 (b) further states that “Each entity shall recognize and present its 
financial transactions and operations conformably in the accrual basis of 
accounting in accordance with IPSAS.” 
 

1.88 Section 119 of PD No. 1445 provides that “All lawful expenditures and 
obligations incurred during the year shall be taken up in the accounts of that 
year.” 
 



55 
 

1.89 Examination of the submitted Liquidation Reports (LRs) during CY 2020 
revealed that expenses pertaining to prior years’ activities totaling 
₱2,530,611.78 were recorded as current year’s expenses, thus overstating the 
related Expenses account, presented as follows: 

 

Table 13. Overstatement of Expenses Accounts 
Accounts Amount (in Php) 

Travelling Expenses - Local 205,681.81 
Rent/Lease Expenses 56,000.00

Subscription Expenses 750.00 
Taxes, Duties and Licenses 1,500.00 
Total              2,530,611.78  

 
1.90 Considering that the LRs submitted pertain to prior years’ transactions and 

activities, the expenses incurred should have been directly recorded in the 
Accumulated Surplus/ (Deficit) account instead of the related Expenses 
account. 

 
1.91 The error in recording the LRs overstated the related expenses account and 

understated the Accumulated Surplus/ Deficit account reflected in the 
Statement of Financial Performance for the year ended December 31, 2020, 
thus affected the fair presentation of the submitted FSs. 

 
1.92 We recommended that Management, thru the College Accountant, 

prepare the JEV to adjust/ correct the misstatements. 

 

1.93 Management’s Comments: 
 
The Accounting Office submitted GJ Local 21-03-013 dated March 31, 2021 
to partially adjust the misstatement amounting to ₱2,085,111.78. 
  

i) Erroneous recording of Hazard Pay 
 

1.94 The Salaries and Wages – Regular, Other General Services, Other Personnel 
Benefits and Other Professional Services accounts were overstated by 
₱1,144,500.00, ₱2,892,000.00, ₱698,000.00 and ₱69,000.00, respectively, 



56 
 

due to erroneous recording of payments of COVID-19 Hazard pay, contrary 
to the pertinent provisions of the GAM for NGAs, Volume III. 

 
1.95 The GAM for NGAs, Volume III (Revised Chart of Accounts, 2019 updated) 

defines Hazard Pay as an account debited to recognize the payment to 
government officials/employees assigned in difficult/dangerous/ strife-torn/ 
embattled areas as certified by appropriate government body and to those 
whose lives are directly exposed to work conditions which may cause them 
injury/sickness/death/harmful change. 

 
1.96 The Manual defines Salaries and Wages – Regular as an account debited to 

recognize the pay proper for services rendered by government employees 
occupying regular plantilla positions. 

 
1.97 Also, Other General Services is defined as an account debited to recognize 

cost of other general services contracted by the agency not otherwise 
classified under any specific general services accounts. 

 
1.98 Other Personnel Benefits is similarly defined as an account debited to 

recognize the amount contributed by the government for the employees’ 
benefits not falling under any of the specific other personnel accounts. 
 

1.99 Likewise, the Manual defines Other Professional Services as an account 
debited to recognize the cost of other professional services contracted by the 
agency not otherwise classified under any of the specific professional 
services accounts. 

 
1.100 PhilSCA disbursed ₱4,803,500.00 as payment for COVID-19 Hazard Pay for 

the period March 17, 2020 to December 17, 2020. 
 

1.101 Review of the JEVs revealed that instead of debiting the appropriate Hazard 
Pay account, the Accounting Office erroneously recorded the transactions 
under various accounts, presented as follows:

1.102 As can be gleaned from the above table, the erroneous recording overstated the 

Salaries and Wages – Regular, Other General Services, Other Personnel 
Benefits and Other Professional Services accounts by ₱1,144,500.00, 
₱2,892,000.00, ₱698,000.00 and ₱69,000.00, respectively. 
 

1.103  We recommended that Management, thru the Accounting Office, prepare 
and submit the JEV to adjust the misstatements: 

 

 
OTHER ACCOUNTING DEFICIENCIES 

 

Non-restatement of Prior Period Adjustments (PPAs) 
 
2. Non-restatement of the material Prior Period Adjustments (PPAs) in the CY 2020 

FSs with a total amount of ₱3,971,899.38 adversely affected the fair presentation of 

the comparative FSs, contrary to the provisions of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I 

and the IPSAS. 

 
2.1 Section 7, Chapter 19 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, states that the 

“Financial statements shall present fairly the financial position, financial 
performance and cash flows of an entity.  Fair presentation requires the 
faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and 
conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for 
assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses set out in PPSAS.  The application of 
PPSASs, with additional disclosures when necessary, is presumed to result in 
financial statements that achieve a fair presentation (Par. 27, PPSAS 1).  

 
2.2 Paragraph 58 of the IPSAS 1 – Presentation of FSs has referred to IPSAS 3 

which deals with the adjustments to comparative information required when 
an entity changes an accounting policy or corrects an error. 

 
2.3 The IPSAS 3 - Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and 

Errors provides the presentation and disclosure of Prior Period Errors, in 
reference to Sections 42, 44, and 45, Chapter 19 of the GAM for NGAs, 
Volume I, as follows: 

 
a) Section 42 (b). An entity shall correct material prior period errors 
retrospectively in the first set of financial statements authorized for issue 
after their discovery by: (1) restating the comparative amounts for prior 
period(s) presented in which the error occurred; or (2) if the error

occurred before the earliest prior period presented, restating the opening 
balances of assets, liabilities and net assets/equity for the earliest prior 
period presented; 
 
b) Section 44. An entity shall disclose the following: (a) the nature of 
the prior period error; (b) for each prior period presented, to the extent 
practicable, the amount of the correction for each financial statement 
line item affected; (c) the amount of the correction at the beginning of 
the earliest prior period presented; and (d) if retrospective restatement is 
impracticable for a particular prior period, the circumstances that led to 
the existence of that condition and a description of how and from when 
the error has been corrected; and 
 
c) Section 45 illustrates the sample retrospective restatement of errors. 

 
2.4 As defined in the GAM for NGAs, Volume I and paragraph 46 of IPSAS 3, 

errors are those  arising in respect of the recognition, measurement, 
presentation, or disclosure of elements of financial statements.  Financial 
statements are deemed not compliant with IPSASs if they contain either 
material errors, or immaterial errors made intentionally to achieve a particular 
presentation of an entity’s financial position, financial performance, or cash 
flows.  Thus, potential current period errors discovered in that period are 
corrected before the financial statements are authorized for issue.  Material 
errors are sometimes not discovered until a subsequent period, and these prior 
period errors are corrected in the comparative information presented in the 
financial statements for that subsequent period. 

 
2.5 Paragraph 47 of the IPSAS 3 provides further that subject to the limitations of 

retrospective adjustment, an entity shall correct material prior period errors 
retrospectively in the first set of financial statements authorized for issue after 
their discovery by: 

 
(a) Restating the comparative amounts for prior period(s) 

presented in which the error occurred; or 
(b) If the error occurred before the earliest prior period presented, 

restating the opening balances of assets, liabilities and net 
assets/equity for the earliest prior period presented.

2.6 Review of the Statement of Changes in Net Assets/Equity (SCNA/E)for the 
year ended December 31, 2020 showed that the PPAs as unrecorded income 
and expenses were presented with a total amount of ₱2,482,586.52. These 
were also disclosed in the accompanying Notes to FSs, of which Management 
identified them as transactions for previous years such liquidation of 
advances, payment of claims for various creditors/suppliers, overpayment/ 
underpayment of salaries and adjustments on the PPE accounts. The details 
are presented in the Table 15 below::

2.7 As discussed in the Notes to FSs, the amount of PPAs pertains to the effect of 

prior period adjustments derived from the restoration of Cash account due to 
stale/cancelled checks issued in prior years and other adjustments resulting in 
the increase of Net Assets/Equity. 

 
2.8 However, it can be gleaned from the above table that the names of accounts 

affected were not identified. Interview with the Accounting Officer disclosed 
that they can neither provide the details nor discuss specifically the 
adjustments with the Audit Team despite repeated requests.  

 
2.9 As audited, the PPAs amounted to a total of ₱3,971,899.38. The 

misstatements reported in the CY 2019 Annual Audit Report (AAR) were not 
adjusted amounting to ₱1.489,312.86, hence considered as part of 
misstatements in the FSs of CY 2020 in Table No. 1. Also, the PPAs 
presented in the SCNA/E for the year ended December 31, 2020 do not 
include these misstatements, as follows:

2.10 The reported misstatements in the CY 2019 AAR were not corrected 

retrospectively in the first set of FSs authorized for issue as required under the 
pertinent provisions of GAM for NGAs, Volume I and the IPSAS. 

 
2.11 We recommended that Management: 

 

a. comply with the retrospective application of the PPAs by restating the 
2019 FSs as stated in IPSAS 1 and 3 in reference to Sections 42, 44 and 

46, Chapter 19 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I; 

 

b. use the prescribed format provided in Section 45, Chapter 19 of the 
GAM for NGAs, Volume I, for proper procedures and disclosures of 

Retrospective Restatement of Errors; and 

 



61 
 

c. provide the supporting details of the prior period adjustments 
showing the specific accounts affected and present them in the Notes 

to FSs. 

 

3. The UACS Codes in the Trial Balances, FSs and Notes to FSs, and Budget and 
Financial Accountability Reports (BFARs) were not in conformity with the 

Revised Chart of Accounts (updated 2019) as of December 31, 2020. 

 
3.1 The accounts with their corresponding UACS codes in the Trial Balances, FSs 

including the Notes to FS and BFARs of the PhilSCA as of December 31, 2020 
were not in conformity with the Revised Chart of Accounts (Updated 2019) 
prescribed under COA Circular No. 2020-001 dated January 8, 2020, thereby 
affecting the proper recognition of financial transactions in the books of the 
accounts of the PhilSCA. 
 

3.2 COA Circular No. 2020-001 dated January 8, 2020 prescribes the Volume III – 
Revised Chart of Accounts (Updated 2019) replacing Volume III – The 
Revised Chart of Accounts (Updated 2015) of the Government Accounting 
Manual for National Government Agencies effective January 1, 2020 to 
facilitate proper recognition of financial transactions in the books of accounts 
and preclude misuse of account. 
 

3.3 Review of the submitted Trial Balances as well as FSs as of December 31, 
2020 revealed that some accounts were not in conformity with the Revised 
Chart of Accounts (Updated 2019), detailed as follows:

3.4 For capital outlays budgetary accounts, additional accounts were already 
included in the List of Accounts, Chapter 2 of the Revised Chart of Accounts 
(Updated 2019). 
 

3.5 Review of BFARs for CY 2020 revealed that several UACS Codes and 
account titles were still used in the FAR No. 1.  While in FAR No. 5 UACS 
codes were not provided.  The details are shown below:

3.6 Thus, the aforementioned accounts and their corresponding UACS codes 

should be used in the CY 2020 FSs as well as BFARs in order to prevent the 
misapplication of accounts and to facilitate proper recognition of financial 
transactions in the books of accounts and budget reports of the College. 
 

3.7 We recommended that Management, thru the: 
 

a. Accounting Office - use the Revised Chart of Accounts (Updated 2019) 
prescribed under COA Circular No. 2020-001 dated January 8, 2020 and 

update the affected accounts and UACS Codes thereof in the CY 2020 FSs 

including Notes to the FSs as soon as possible or within one month from 

receipt hereof; and 

 

b. Budget Office – use the budgetary accounts for Capital Outlays added in 
the List of Accounts, Chapter 2 of the Revised Chart of Accounts 

(Updated 2019) prescribed under COA Circular No. 2020-001 dated 

January 8, 2020, update the affected accounts and UACS Codes therefor 

in the BFARs as soon as possible or within one month from receipt hereof. 

 

3.8 Management’s Comment: 
 

The Budget Office submitted on March 24, 2021 the revised FAR No.1-A and 
FAR No. 5 last March 24, 2021 to update the affected accounts and UACS 
Codes. 

 



64 
 

4. Unresolved variances and huge discrepancies between PhilSCA’s Accounting 
records and their supporting schedules/documents and unsubstantiated 

balances were noted which affected the reliability of the Cash in Bank – LCCA 

and Accounts Receivable accounts totaling ₱524,076,604.95 as at December 31, 

2020, contrary to Section 6.e, Chapter 19 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I. 

 
4.1 Section 6.e, Chapter 19 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I on Qualitative 

Characteristics of Financial Reporting states that “an entity shall present 
information including accounting policies in a manner that meets reliable 
information, which is free from material error and bias, and can be depended 
on by users to represent faithfully that which it purports to represent or could 
reasonably be expected to represent.” 

 
4.2 The details of the other accounting deficiencies are discussed in the succeeding 

paragraphs. 
 

a) Non-preparation and non-submission of up-to-date BRS and absence of 
subsidiary records for the SHS VP bank account  

 
4.3 The Accounting Office did not timely prepare the BRS, thereby no adjustments 

to this account were prepared and recorded. Likewise, they have not

4.5 We recommended that Management: 
 
a. comply with the timely preparation and submission of BRS and the 

maintenance of SLs for each bank account; and 
 

b. ensure that reconciling items are properly identified and promptly 
adjusted to reflect the correct balance of the Cash - LCCA account as 

of December 31, 2020. 
 

b) Unreliable balance of accounts receivable due to accumulation of dormant 
accounts and non-submission of the quarterly report on aging of dormant 
receivables 

 
4.6 The balance of the Accounts Receivable account amounting to ₱24,477,665.75 

as of December 31, 2020 is unreliable due to: a) accumulation of dormant 
accounts totaling ₱13,096,021.42 and recording of accounts receivable without 
substantial documents/reports; b) submission of incomplete/insufficient 
documentation to support the write-off of accounts;  and c) non-submission of 
the quarterly report on aging of dormant receivables, contrary to the provisions 
of Section 121 (2) of PD No. 1445 and COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated 
December 19, 2016. 
 

4.7 Section 121 (2) of PD No. 1445 states that “The financial statements shall be 
based on official accounting records kept in accordance with law and the 
generally accepted accounting principles and standards.” 

 
4.8 COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016 prescribes the 

guidelines and procedures in reconciling and cleaning the books of accounts of 
NGAs, LGUs and GOCCs of dormant receivable accounts, unliquidated cash 
advances and fund transfer for fair presentation of accounts in the FSs. 
 

4.9 Section 5.4 of the Circular defines dormant receivables accounts as an account 
which balances remained inactive or non-moving in the books of accounts for 
ten (10) years or more and where settlement/ collectability could no longer be 
ascertained. 
 

4.10 Section 8.2 of the same Circular states that the Head of the government entity 
shall file the request for authority to write-off dormant accounts, unliquidated 
cash advances, and fund transfers to the COA Audit Team Leader (ATL) 
and/or Supervising Auditor (SA). 
 

4.11 COA Circular No. 93-404 dated October 18, 1993 prescribes the reporting 
requirement in case of losses of documents evidencing financial transactions 
and/or records of accountabilities.

i. Accumulation of dormant accounts totaling ₱13,096,021.42 
and recording of accounts receivable without substantial 
documents/reports   

 
4.12 Review of the Accounts Receivable account revealed an outstanding balance of 

₱24,477,665.75. Its Schedule of Aging is summarized as follows:

Total 24,477,665.75 

 
4.13 Based on the analysis of the aging of Accounts Receivable, ₱13,096,021.42 or 

54 percent of the ₱24,477,665.75 Accounts Receivable has been long 
outstanding for more than 10 years. This pertains to uncollected school fees 
from the College and the Graduate School. 
 

4.14 Outstanding Accounts Receivable for more than one to 10 years amounted to 
₱10,065,457.58 pertaining to uncollected receivables from SHS, College, 
Graduate School, faculty personnel (former students) and basketball varsity. 
 

4.15 The remaining ₱1,316,186.75 was outstanding for less than one year. Inquiry 
with the Collecting Office of PhilSCA-VAB Campus disclosed that the amount 
pertains to the uncollected school fees from students who are no longer eligible 
for free tuition and miscellaneous fees under RA No. 10931, also known as 
Free Higher Education (FHE) Act. 
 

4.16 The balance of the Accounts Receivable account increased by ₱9,967,126.81 
from the prior year’s balance of ₱14,510,538.94. Analysis of the substantial 



68 
 

increase disclosed that collections totaled ₱130,716.75 and that the Accounting 
Office recorded JEV No. GJ Local 20-12-110 dated December 31, 2020 to 
recognize Accounts Receivable amounting to ₱10,097,843.56. 
 

4.17 The Accounting Office was not able to furnish the Audit Team with substantial 
documents and reports to support the recorded transactions, thus casts doubt on 
the propriety and validity of the transaction. 
 

4.18 Further inquiry with the Collecting Office of PhilSCA-VAB Campus revealed 
a total Accounts Receivable from the students of VAB Campus of 
₱12,183,545.04 as of March 2021. However, the amount remained unverified 
due to lack of supporting documents and other relevant information (e.g., 
registration/enrollment certificate of the students, address and contact 
information, etc.).

4.20 The remaining ₱12,294,120.71 Accounts Receivable from other Campuses 

were also not supported with relevant and complete documentation. 
 

ii. Submission of incomplete/insufficient documentation to 
support the request for write-off of accounts 

 
4.21 On November 3, 2020, the Management submitted a request for write-off of 

long-standing unpaid tuition fee of students from SYs 2000-2010 amounting to 
₱3,969,037.86, for the reason that the necessary records to validate the claims 
were either lost or already damaged by termites, and there were no more ways 
to contact the concerned students/debtors. 

 



69 
 

4.22 The College has not submitted a report/notice of loss and copies of the 
investigation report narrating the cause(s) of loss of the documents/records 
pertaining to the accounts, and holding the official/s and employee/s liable 
thereof, as required by the pertinent COA Circulars. 
 

4.23 Proof of exhaustion of all remedies to collect the receivables such as, but not 
limited to, copies of served or returned demand letters were also not furnished 
to the Audit Team. 

 
4.24 The Audit Team issued RWO (Request for Write-Off) No. 2020-001 dated 

November 4, 2020 to the Management returning the request for write-off 
submitted by the Management due to lacking and/or not complied with 
documentation as required under COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 
19, 2016. 

 
4.25 The Audit Team emphasizes that the request for write-off of the dormant 

accounts receivable shall be supported with complete and sufficient 
documentation as prescribed under the pertinent COA Circulars. 
 

4.26 Further, the College submitted CHED Memorandum Order (CMO) No. 02 
Series of 2010 dated January 10, 2010 and CHED Memorandum from the 
Executive Office dated March 31, 2014, citing the appeal to HEIs for 
flexibility in the implementation of the “No permit, no examination policy” or 
any such policy that prohibits students from taking their periodic or final 
examinations due to unpaid tuition and other school fees. 
 

4.27 Both memoranda prescribe that “SUCs shall reserve the right to withhold the 
release or issuance of students’ clearance prior to their graduation or until 
prior accountabilities are settled.” 
 

4.28 The Audit Team acknowledges the flexibility of the PhilSCA in allowing 
students with unpaid school fees to take the examinations. However, the 
College was not able to effectively enforce the right to withhold the release or 
issuance of students’ clearance until prior accountabilities are settled, thus 
resulted in lapses in the collection of school fees and the accumulation of 
dormant accounts. 
 

iii. Non-submission of the quarterly report on aging of dormant 
receivables 

 
4.29 Section 6.1 of COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016 

prescribes that “all government entities shall conduct regular monitoring and 
analysis of receivable accounts to ensure that these are collected when these 
become due and demandable...xxx” 
 



70 
 

4.30 Section 6.2 of the same Circular further states that “All government entities 
shall prepare the schedule of all receivables, unliquidated cash advances, and 
fund transfers as of December 31, 2015 and quarterly thereafter. 
 

4.31 Appendix 55 of GAM for NGAs, Volume II prescribes the preparation of the 
schedule of accounts receivables. 
 

4.32 Our audit revealed that the Accounting Office submits the schedule of all 
receivables annually instead of quarterly; and the remarks column of the 
schedule is also not filled up with information commenting on the status or 
condition of the receivables. Likewise, documents to support the validity of the 
schedules were not being forwarded/submitted to the COA Office. 
 

4.33 We recommended that Management: 
 

a. furnish the Audit Team with copies of the supporting 
documents/reports to validate the recorded transactions amounting to 

₱10,097,843.56, otherwise adjust the recorded amount; 

 

b.  thru the Accounting Office, gather and maintain sufficient 
documents/reports to support the recorded balance of the accounts 

receivables; 

 

c. ensure that the request for write-off is submitted with 
complete/sufficient documentation as prescribed under COA Circular 

No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016; 

 

d. abide by COA Circular No. 93-404 dated October 18, 1993 in case of 
losses of documents evidencing financial transactions and/or records 

of accountabilities; 

 

e. enforce the right of the College, thru the concerned offices, to 
withhold the release or issuance of students’ clearance until prior 

accountabilities are settled; 

 

f. submit the schedule/aging of all receivables with complete details on a 
quarterly basis together with the pertinent supporting documents as 

prescribed under COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 

2016.

COMPLIANCE AUDIT 

 
STF (Special Trust Fund) Utilization 

 
5. The audit of STF budget revealed a) inconsistencies in the budgeted amounts in 

the submitted FARs against the FY 2020 Program of Receipts and Expenditures 

(PRE), with a difference of P24,206,555.60; and b) significant amount of 

unutilized budget of ₱132,842,757.77 or 39 percent of the total STF budget of 

₱342,001,890.11, thus affected the efficiency and effectiveness of the College’s 

operations that deferred the benefits of modernized facilities and equipment for 

the students. 
 

5.1 Republic Act (RA) No. 8292 or the Higher Education Modernization Act of 
1997, Section 4(d) provides, among others, that: 
 
“Any income generated by the university or college from tuition fees and other 
charges, as well as from operation of auxiliary services and land grants, shall 
be retained by the university or college, and may be disbursed by the Board of 
Regents/Trustees for instruction, research, extension or other 
programs/projects of the university or college: Provided, that all fiduciary fees 
shall be disbursed for the specific purposes for which they are collected.” 

 
5.2 COA Circular No. 2000-002 dated April 4, 2000 prescribes the guidelines and 

procedures on the use of income of SUCs pursuant to RA No. 8292. 
 

5.3 CHED Memorandum Order (CMO) No. 20, series of 2011, dated August 4, 
2011, prescribes the policies and guidelines on the use of income, Special Trust 
Fund (STF) and Programs of Receipts and Expenditures (PRE) of the State 
Universities and Colleges (SUCs).  Pertinent provisions are emphasized as 
follows: 
 

“Section 3 (v), Article I - Special Trust Fund (STF) – refers to the 
income of the SUC arising from the collection of tuition fees, 
miscellaneous fees, service and other income.” 

 
“Section 23, Article IV – Upon approval of the budget, the Office 
of the Board Secretary shall furnish a copy of the BOT approved 
budget to the COA Resident Auditor, DBM Regional Office, the 
Chief Accountant and all the fund administrators, and attach 
thereto the excerpt of minutes of the meeting and the Board 
Resolution with control number thereon for reference of the users 
of the budget document.” 

 
“Section 23, Article VII- It shall be the responsibility of the SUC to 
formulate internal procedures and process flows to implement the 
provisions in these guidelines, and the same shall be modified 



72 
 

periodically in compliance with rules and regulations that may be 
passed by other concerned National Government Agencies from 
time to time, particularly those originating from CHED, DBM, 
COA, NEDA, DOST, DA and those agencies which functions or 
mandate are allied with the functions and mandate of the SUC.”  

 
5.4 The submitted PRE amounting to ₱366,208,445.71 (STF portion) for FY 2020 

was supported with recommendation from the Finance Committee for approval 
of the PRE and an excerpt from the minutes of the combined third and fourth 
quarters BOT regular meeting for FY 2019 on January 17, 2020; which 
included Resolution No. 387, series of 2020 approving the PRE.  However, the 
amount of the approved budget was not disclosed in the submitted excerpt. 
 

5.5 Examination of the Approved Budgeted Revenue (adjusted) reported in the 
Statement of Approved Budget, Utilizations, Disbursements and Balances 
(SABUDB) (FAR No. 2) and the Summary of Approved Budget, Utilizations, 
Disbursements and Balances by Object of Expenditures (SABUDBOE) (FAR 
No.2-A) as of December 31, 2020 amounting to ₱342,001,890.11 is lower 
compared to the Approved Budget presented in the FY 2020 PRE. The details 
of the difference are as follows:

5.6 The inconsistency between the FARs and the FY 2020 Program of Receipts 

and Expenditures (PRE) affected the reliability of the submitted budgetary 
reports. 
 

5.7 Review of the submitted SABUDB (FAR No. 2) and SABUDBOE (FAR No. 
2-A) as of December 31, 2020 revealed that only ₱209,159,132.34 or 61 
percent of ₱342,001,890.00 budget allocated for FY 2020 was utilized. It can 
be observed that FAR No.2-A projected an unrealistic budget for STF as 
disclosed by huge unutilized balances amounting to ₱2,957,672.45 or 22 
percent for PS; ₱77,169,656.57 or 34 percent for MOOE; and ₱49,347,871.25 
or 52 percent for CO, presented as follows:

5.8 Further review of the SABUDBOE (FAR No. 2-A) revealed the following: 

 
a. For the MOOE, unutilized budget for survey, research, exploration and 

development expenses was observed amounting to ₱5,048,742.43 or a 
significant 99 percent of the ₱5,083,027.91 allocated budget, caused by 
non-implementation of the proposed programs and projects for research.  

 
b. Furthermore, partial utilization for the other items of expenditures under 

MOOE was noted ranging from 13 to 97 percent whereas unutilized 
budget amounted to ₱72,120,914.14, summarized as follows:

c. As can be gleaned from the table above, ₱2,609,698.32 or 87 percent of 
the ₱2,999,900.00 budget for travelling expenses was unutilized due to 
the restriction of travel during the implementation of Community 
Quarantine due to COVID-19. 

 
d. Moreover, only ₱4,951,834.68 or 47 percent of the ₱9,265,000.00 

allocated budget for supplies and materials was utilized, leaving an 
unutilized amount of ₱4,313,165.32 due to limited mobility caused by 
the COVID-19 pandemic. 

 
e. For the Capital Outlay (CO), the College was able to undertake contracts 

and substantially utilized the budget for buildings and other structures 
amounting to ₱47,704,396.25 or 86 percent of the allocated budget of 
₱55,690,000.00. 

 
f. However, the College was not able to adequately utilized the approved 

budget for the procurement of office equipment, ICT equipment, 
communication equipment, other machinery and books, thus resulted in 
low utilization of ₱1,643,475.00 or six percent of the ₱27,671,300.00 
budget. 

 
g. Moreover, appropriated budget totaling ₱18,702,000.00 pertaining to 

outlay for technical and scientific equipment; aircrafts and aircrafts 
ground equipment; and furniture and fixtures was not utilized during the 
year.

j. PhilSCA’s non-procurement of the much-needed equipment and 

furniture/fixtures embodied in the FY 2020 STF budget affected the 
efficiency and effectiveness of the College’s operations that deferred the 
benefits of modernized facilities and equipment for the students. 

 
k. Moreover, the non-procurement of medical and protective equipment 

lessened the effectivity of the health and safety protocols of the College 
and exposed health risks to the frontline employees and its stakeholders. 

 
5.9 We recommended that Management: 

 
a. ensure that the BOT Resolution approving the College’s PRE 

indicates the amount of the approved budget; 
 

b. submit justification on the inconsistencies of the FY 2020 budget 
presented in the PRE and the FARs; 

 
c. prepare a more realistic budget by considering the needs and 

capability of the College to disburse the same, and maximize the 

utilization thereof for the effective implementation of planned 

programs/projects; and 
 

d. ensure the consistency of the disclosed budget between the approved 
PRE and the SABUDB (FAR No. 2)/ SABUDBOE (FAR No. 2-A) to 

ensure the reliability and validity of the submitted reports. 
 
 
 



76 
 

5.10 Management’s Comments: 
 
The Management commented that it was in consonance with DBM National 
Budget Circular (NBC) No. 580 dated April 22, 2020 for the guidelines on the 
Adoption of Economy Measures in the Government Due to the Emergency 
Health Situation which gave way for the College to revise the PRE to reflect 
the discontinuance of the appropriations and allotment of selected programs, 
activities, projects. This brought the low utilization rate of the College in its 
STF.  

 
The Budget Office, together with the Budget Proposal Evaluation Committee, 
will look on all possible means to provide and submit conservative budget in 
the succeeding budget preparations based on capabilities of campuses, 
departments, offices and other units. 
 

5.11 Auditor’s Rejoinder: 
 
The Audit Team requested the Management to submit BOT Resolution for the 
approval of the revised PRE. 

 
Unutilized fund transfer for Tulong Dunong Program (TDP)  

 
6. Out of the ₱3,000,000.00 fund transfer from CHEDRO- NCR for the 

implementation of the Tulong Dunong Program (TDP), a total of ₱636,000.00 

was not utilized/released to the student-grantees by PhilSCA, thereby adversely 

affecting the educational needs of the underprivileged yet qualified and 

deserving student-grantees, contrary to the Joint CHED-DBM issuances on the 

Program. Also, the copy of Memorandum of Agreement (MOA), as vital basis 

for the evaluation of Program implementation was not submitted to the Audit 

Team.  

  

6.1 CHED-DBM JMC No. 2017-2 dated May 24, 2017 prescribes the 
implementing guidelines on the Tulong Dunong Program (TDP) which aim to 
provide financial assistance to deserving students in recognized programs of 
private Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) and Local Universities and 
Colleges (LUCs) or authorized program of State Universities and Colleges 
(SUCs). 
 

6.2 Similarly, CHED and DBM issued JMC No. 2017-3 dated May 24, 2017 
implementing the guidelines on the Tulong Dunong Program pursuant to the 
special provision applicable to SUCs. 
 

6.3 Section 5 of the above JMC provides that a student-grantee shall be entitled to 
a maximum of twelve thousand pesos (₱12,000.00) grant per academic year 
which may be used in support for the cost of higher education (tuition and 
other school fees), educational expenses and cost of living allowance. Ongoing 



77 
 

grantees shall also be entitled to the same amount of financial benefits they 
received prior to the approval of the JMC. 
 

6.4 Section 6 of the same JMC further states the qualification requirements for 
student-grantees, as follows: 

 
6.1   Filipino citizen; 
6.2  High school graduates, with earned units in higher education 

with at least a passing general weighted average (GWA); or 
passer of Alternative Learning System (ALS)/ Philippine 
Educational Placement Test (PEPT); and 

6.3 Combined annual gross income of parents/guardians not to 
exceed three hundred thousand pesos (₱300,000.00). 

 
       x x x 

 
6.5 Moreover, CHED and DBM JMC No. 04 s. 2019 dated September 13, 2019 

was issued to prescribe the revised implementing guidelines of the CHED-
Tulong Dunong Program (CHED-TDP). 
 

6.6 Section 5 of the JMC states the financial benefits of the student-grantees of AY 
2019-2020, to wit: “A student-grantee shall be entitled to Fifteen Thousand 
Pesos (Php15,000.00) financial assistance per academic year, which may be 
used to support the cost of higher education expenses (i.e. educational and 
living allowance).” 
 

6.7 The Audit Team noted the following deficiencies during the course of audit in 
the implementation of Tulong Dunong Program by the College: 
 
a. Unreleased Financial Assistance to the Student-Grantees 

amounting to ₱636,000.00 
 

6.8 Both Sections 8 of the two JMCs state the payment of grant and documentary 
requirements. Per Section 8.1.2 of JMC No. 2017-2, CHED Regional Offices 
(CHEDROs) shall transfer financial benefits to grantees through HEIs while 
Section 8.1 of JMC No. 2017-3 states that the payment of financial benefits 
shall be made directly to the grantees based on Section 5.0 thereof through 
issuance of check or Automated Teller Machines (ATMs). 
 

6.9 For CY 2020, PhilSCA received funds from CHEDROs for the implementation 
of the TDP for AYs 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 as follows:

6.10 Analysis of the transactions revealed that both PhilSCA-FAB Campus and 

PhilSCA-BAB Campus issued Official Receipts (ORs) with CHEDRO as the 
payor and deposited the funds in the bank accounts of PhilSCA. 
 

6.11 Audit of the fund transfers from CHED disclosed that only ₱2,364,000.00 was 
granted as cash advances to the Special Disbursing Officers (SDOs) of FAB 
and BAB Campuses to be released to the student grantees, as follows:

6.12 The unreleased financial assistance of ₱636,000.00 to the two Campuses thru 
cash advance delayed the receipt of benefits that could have financially assisted 
the grantees. 
 
b. Non-submission of copy of MOA with CHEDRO-NCR 

 
6.13 COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994 prescribes the rules and 

regulations in the grant, utilization and liquidation of funds transferred to 
implementing agencies (IAs). 
 



79 
 

6.14 One of the general guidelines of the abovementioned Circular, as embodied in 
Section 4.1, which requires the undertaking of agreement between the source 
agency (SA) with the implementing agency (IA), states that the SA shall enter 
into an agreement with the IA for the undertaking by the latter of the project of 
the former.  The Agreement shall provide for the requirements for project 
implementation and reporting. 
 

6.15 In addition, one of the documentary requirements for the release of the 
financial assistance is a MOA.  Section 8.2.1 of CHED-DBM JMC No. 2017-
02A dated September 29, 2017 requires that CHEDRO shall enter into a MOA 
with participating HEIs to facilitate the transfer of funds and to ensure 
compliance with control mechanisms. 
 

6.16 Despite the prior recommendation to furnish/submit copies of the MOA with 
the CHEDRO for the TDP, PhilSCA did not comply with the submission of the 
copies of MOA which is a documentary requirement for the abovementioned 
Circular/Memorandum. 

 
6.17 We recommended that Management: 

 

a.   furnish the Audit Team with the copy of the liquidation of the 

remaining unreleased TDP financial assistance amounting to 

₱636,000.00; and 

 

b. submit the MOA with CHEDRO-NCR for the implementation of the 
TDP as reference in audit. 

 
6.18 Management’s Comments: 

 
 The Management has furnished the Audit Team the copy of the liquidation            

report of the unreleased financial assistance amounting to ₱636,000.00.        
 
Lapses in the implementation of TES-ESGPPA for AYs 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 
 
7. Lapses in the implementation of the TES-ESGPPA for AYs 2018-2019 and 

2019-2020 were noted such as: a) non-compliance of the College with its 

responsibilities in the implementation of the Program; b) non-issuance of  

Official Receipts (ORs) for funds received from CHED totaling ₱3,563,800.00; 

and c) unreleased educational assistance to the student-grantees amounting to 

₱4,781,800.00,  contrary to CHED-UniFAST Memorandum Circular No. 2018-

0001 dated March 26, 2018 and CHED-UniFAST-DBM Joint Memorandum 

Circular No. 07, s. 2019 dated December 27, 2019, thus hampered the timely 

receipt of benefits that could have financially assisted the grantees.

7.1 The Expanded Students’ Grants-in-Aid Program for Poverty Alleviation 
(ESGP-PA) is an existing joint program of the Commission on Higher 
Education (CHED), Department of Social Welfare and Development 
(DSWD), Department of Budget and Management (DBM) and the 
Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE). As stipulated in the CHED-
DBM-DSWD-DOLE Joint Memorandum Circular No. 01 dated June 23, 2016 
regarding the ESGP-PA program coverage, the ESGP-PA shall eventually be 
under the umbrella of RA No. 10687, otherwise known as“Unified Student 
Financial Assistance System for Tertiary Education (UniFAST) Act” which 
covers all existing modalities of Student Financial Assistance Programs 
(StuFAPs) for Tertiary Education and Special Purpose Education Assistance 
in both public and private institutions. Consequently, under both RA No. 
10687 and RA No. 10931, the continuing ESGP-PA student-grantees are 
considered to be included and covered by RA No. 10931 through the TES 
program. 
 

7.2 Section 22 of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA No. 
10931, known as the “Universal Access to Quality Tertiary Education Act of 
2017,” prescribes the establishment of Tertiary Education Subsidy (TES) 
program to support the cost of tertiary education or any portion thereof, for all 
Filipino students enrolled in their first undergraduate post-secondary program 
offered in SUCs, LUCs and private HEIs. 

 
7.3 CHED-UniFAST Memorandum Circular No. 2018-0001 dated March 26, 

2018 prescribes the guidelines for the Expanded Students’ Grants-in-aid 
Program for Poverty Alleviation (ESGP-PA) covered under the Universal 
Access to Quality Tertiary Education Law (RA No. 10931) through Tertiary 
Education Subsidy (TES) during its transitory period. 

 
7.4 Continuing ESGP-PA grantees who are currently enrolled in the State 

Universities and Colleges (SUCs) in course offerings aligned with the 
priorities of the government based on the current supply and demand situation 
in the labor markets are considered to be entitled to the TES benefits. 

 
7.5 Section 4 of the abovementioned MC prescribes the financial benefits entitled 

to qualified student-grantees, to wit: “A student-grantee shall be entitled to a 
maximum of Forty Thousand Pesos (PhP40,000.00) as grant per academic 
year or Twenty Thousand Pesos (PhP20,000.00) as grant per semester.  The 
grant is intended to cover academic and extra-curricular expenses, purchase 
of textbooks, board and lodging, transportation, clothing, admission / 
entrance fees, health and other valid related education expenses and support 
services to complete the student-grantee’s degree program.”

Special Provision (SP) No.3, CHED budget on RA No. 11260, also known as 
the General Appropriations Act (GAA) of FY 2019, to promote the efficient 
utilization of all funds intended for rational implementation of the grants-in-
aid program of the government. 

 
7.7 Lapses on the implementation of the TES-ESGPPA for AYs 2018-2019 and 

2019-2020 were noted and disclosed as follows: 
 

a. Non-compliance of the College with its responsibilities in the 
implementation of the Program  

 
7.8 Section XVII (F) of CHED-DBM Joint Memorandum Circular No. 07, s. 2019

7.14 The delay in releasing the educational assistance to the student-grantees of the 

TES-ESGPPA hampered the timely receipt of benefits that could have 
financially assisted the grantees. 

 
7.15 We recommended that Management: 

 

a. issue ORs for the funds received from CHED totaling ₱3,563,800.00 
and furnish the Audit Team copies of the ORs; 

 

b. release the financial assistance amounting to ₱4,781,800.00 to the 
qualified student-grantees of PhilSCA and furnish the Audit Team 

copies of Fund Utilization Reports; 

 

c. maintain a separate bank account with the LBP, for proper account 
management of TES funds. 

 
Deficiencies in the Granting and Liquidation of Cash Advances 

 
8. Deficiencies in the granting and liquidation of cash advances (CAs) were noted 

such as: a) additional cash advances were granted to an employee without first 

liquidating the previous CAs; and b) liquidations totaling ₱4,796,033.15 were 



84 
 

liquidated/refunded beyond the reglementary period, contrary to the pertinent 

provisions of Section 89 of PD No. 1445 and COA Circular No. 97-002 dated 

February 10, 1997, thus exposing the unused/excess cash to risk elements of loss, 

unreported expenses, unaccounted cash and probable misappropriation of 

funds. 

 
8.1 The Advances to SDOs and to Officers and Employees accounts have balances 

of ₱615,147.86 and ₱7,374.28, respectively, as of December 31, 2020. 
 

8.2 Analysis on the granting of CAs for CY 2020 disclosed that an employee of 
PhilSCA was allowed additional CA despite the non-settlement of the previous 
CA, contrary to Section 4.1.2 of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 
1997, shown as follows:

8.3 On October 20, 2020, the Audit Team issued demand letters to the officers and 
employees of PhilSCA with long outstanding cash advances. 
 

8.4 Consequently, review of the LRs revealed that the College was able to 
liquidate a significant amount of the outstanding CAs during CY 2020 totaling 
₱6,818,771.72, summarized as follows:

8.5 As can be gleaned from the above table, total cash advances amounting to

significant delay of 13 to 586 days for local travel and three to 640 days for 
field operating expenses, contrary to the provisions of COA Circular No. 97-

8.6 Further analysis revealed that out of the ₱718,378.86 unused cash advances 
which were refunded, ₱609,387.34 or 84.83 percent were not returned 
immediately to the Collecting Officer/s, broken down as follows:

8.7 Unused cash advances granted in CYs 2018 and 2019 totaling ₱280,660.01 

were returned to the Collecting Officer/s only during CY 2020, incurring a 
delay ranging from 21 to 660 days or almost two years; while the remaining 
₱328,727.33 was not immediately refunded during the year, contrary to Section 
5.7 of the abovementioned Circular, thus exposed the unused cash advances to 
risk of misuse and loss. 
 

8.8 Moreover, unexpended CAs totaling ₱15,169.28 remained unreturned as of 
date, despite the submission of the liquidation of the cash advances relative 
thereto, presented as follows:

Total 28,000.00 12,830.72 15,169.28 

 
8.9 The delay in the liquidation of cash advances resulted in the accumulation of 

receivables from the officials and employees of the College. 
 

8.10 We recommended that Management: 
 

a. strictly comply with the provisions of PD No. 1445 and COA Circular 
No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 in the granting, utilization and 

timely liquidation of cash advances; 

 



87 
 

b. demand the immediate settlement/refund of the unused cash advances 
of the two employees of PhilSCA amounting to ₱15,169.28 within five 

days from receipt hereof; 

 

c. refrain from liquidating the cash advances partially, the unused cash 
advances must be returned/refunded to the Collecting Officer/s 

immediately as prescribed under Section 5.7 of COA Circular No. 97-

002 dated February 10, 1997; and 

 

d. require the AOs to liquidate the total outstanding cash advances 
totaling ₱622,522.14 as of yearend and refund immediately any 

unexpended amount within ten (10) days from receipt hereof to 

preclude the issuance of Notice of Suspension/Notice of Disallowance. 
 

8.11 Management’s Comments: 
 
Management commented that the Accounting Office has sent demand letters to 
the concerned employees to refund the unused cash advances. 
 

8.12 Auditor’s Rejoinder: 
 
Management has not provided the Audit Team copies of the demand letters 
sent. 

 

Delayed Submission of Purchase Orders (POs) for CYs 2019-2020 
 

9. Copies of Purchase Orders (POs) and their supporting documents on purchases 
of various supplies and equipment made by the College in CYs 2019 to 2020 

aggregating ₱16,158,995.15 were not submitted to the Auditor within the 

prescribed period of five (5) days from issuance thereof, contrary to the 

provision of Section 3.2 of COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009 

and COA Circular No. 96-010 dated August 15, 1996, thus precluding timely 

and objective review and evaluation of consummated transactions.  Likewise, 

inspection of deliveries to determine completeness, nature and condition cannot 

be done due to the failure of the Agency to inform the Audit Team on the 

schedule of deliveries. 

 
9.1 COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009 covers all contracts, 

purchase orders and the like, entered into by any government agency 
irrespective of amount involved. 
 

9.2 Section 3.2 of the above Circular states that a copy of any purchase order 
irrespective of amount, and each and every supporting document, shall, within 
five (5) working days from issuance thereof, be submitted to the Auditor 
concerned. Within the same period, the Auditor shall review and point out to 
Management the defects and/or deficiencies, if any.    



88 
 

 
9.3 COA Circular No. 96-010 dated August 15, 1996, which prescribes the 

guidelines in the preparation and submission of purchase orders relative to the 
procurement of supplies and equipment. Item A (1-3) thereof, states the 
following: 

 
(1)  A copy of any letter or purchase order, irrespective of amount, and 

all supporting documents thereto, shall be submitted to the unit or 
agency Auditor concerned within five (5) days from issuance.  The 
Auditor concerned shall, within five (5) days following his receipt 
thereof, inform management in writing of any defect, and/or 
deficiencies found in audit.  

 
(2)   The agency official responsible for accepting deliveries of procured 

items shall, within twenty-four (24) hours from such acceptance, 
notify the Auditor of the time and date of the scheduled deliveries.  
In case of partial delivery of any item in the P.O., the copy to be 
submitted shall indicate which items have been delivered, and 
which have not. 

 
(3)  Copy of P.O. must be legible in all respects, and shall be submitted 

to the Office the COA Auditor of the agency concerned. 
 

9.4 Review of the POs submitted to the Audit Team revealed that the College 
made purchases in an aggregate amount of ₱16,158,995.15 of various supplies 
and equipment for CYs 2019 and 2020. Attached is Annex A for the detailed 
summary of the POs and supporting documents. 
 

9.5 Per attached detailed summary, verification showed that delays in the 
submission of POs within the prescribed period reached up to 309 days or 
equivalent to ten months.  In addition, it can be gleaned from the summary that 
the POs were not pre-numbered. There was no information if some were 
cancelled and not submitted. 
 

9.6 The College failed to show action on the delayed submission of POs. It has 
been the practice of the Supply Office to submit POs together with sales 
invoices, delivery receipts and inspection reports to the Audit Team after 
delivery was made and upon distribution of the procured items to the end-
users. 
 

9.7 Moreover, upon scrutiny of the submitted POs, there were some that have no 
attached Inspection and Acceptance Reports (IARs) and/or unnumbered IARs.    
Some deliveries to PhilSCA-Basa Airbase, Pampanga have no IARs and are 
not prenumbered (as highlighted in the summary). 
 



89 
 

9.8 Appendix 62 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume II prescribes that IAR is the 
report submitted by the Inspection Officer/Committee and the Supply and/or 
Property Custodian on the inspection and acceptance, respectively, of the 
purchased supplies/goods/equipment/property. 

 
9.9 Absence of the IAR and IAR number created doubts whether the items were 

actually delivered, inspected, verified and found in order as to quantity and 
specifications and when the inspection was conducted by the Inspection 
Officer/Committee. Further, there was no acknowledgement made of the items 
whether the delivery is complete or partial as to quantity. 

 
9.10 Furthermore, the Audit Team was not notified of the time and date of the 

scheduled deliveries within 24 hours from acceptance of the procured items; 
resulting in deliveries that are not being inspected. 
 

9.11 Section 39 (1) of PD No. 1445 states that COA shall have the power, for 
purposes of inspection, to require the submission of the original of any order, 
deed, contract, or other document under which any collection of, or payment 
from, government funds may be made, together with any certificate, receipt, or 
other evidence in connection therewith. If an authenticated copy is needed for 
record purposes, the copy shall upon demand be furnished. 
 

9.12 Section 39 (3) further states that failure to comply promptly with the 
requirements or refusal to do so without justifiable cause shall constitute a 
ground for administrative disciplinary action as well as for disallowing 
permanently a claim under examination. 
 

9.13 PhilSCA did not submit copies of purchase orders within five days upon its 
issuance/execution and notify the Audit Team of the time and date of the 
scheduled deliveries, in violation of COA Circular Nos. 2009-001 and 96-010, 
thus precluding timely and objective review and evaluation of transactions. 
 

9.14 Likewise, inspection of deliveries to determine completeness, nature and 
condition cannot be done due to the failure of the College to inform the Audit 
Team of the schedule of deliveries. 
 

9.15 We recommended that Management: 
 

a. thru the Supply Officer, submit copies of POs and the supporting 
documents forming part thereof to the Audit Team within five 

working days from issuance or execution to ensure timely and 

objective review of transactions; 

 

b. thru the official responsible for accepting deliveries of procured items    
within twenty-four (24) hours from acceptance, notify the Auditor of 

the time and date of the scheduled deliveries pursuant to COA 



90 
 

Circular No. 96-010. In case of partial delivery of any item in the PO, 

the copy to be submitted shall indicate which items have been 

delivered, and which have not; 

 

c. thru the official responsible for accepting deliveries of procured items 
in Basa Airbase, Pampanga, prepare and accomplish the IAR for 

every delivery to be accepted. 

 
9.16 Management’s Comments: 

 
The Supply Officer committed to abide by the COA Circular. 

 
No sufficient documentation on the receipt and utilization of unbooked donations 

 
10. Unbooked donations amounting to ₱820,000.00 were included and presented in 

the GAD Accomplishment Report of PhilSCA for CY 2020, attributed as 

extension and technical assistance activities with no sufficient documentation on 

the receipt and utilization to ensure its accuracy, contrary to Section 31 of the 

General Provisions of GAA for FY 2020 and COA Circular No. 2014-002 dated 

April 15, 2014, thereby depriving the donors and other concerned stakeholders 

and the public in general of quality financial reports on the  status of utilization 

of every donation. 

 

10.1 Section 5 of the General Provisions of RA No. 11465, the GAA for FY 2020 
provides that: 

 
“Departments, bureaus, and offices of the National Government 
including Constitutional Offices enjoying fiscal autonomy and SUCs may 
accept donations, contributions, grants, bequests or gifs in cash or in 
kind, from various sources from domestic or foreign, for purposes 
relevant to their functions. National government agencies may accept 
donations in cash or in kind, from domestic or foreign sources, for 
purposes relevant to their functions.  x x x 

 
The donee-agency concerned shall submit its quarterly reports of all 
donations received, whether in cash or in kind, and expenditures or 
disbursements thereon, within thirty (30) days after the end of every 
quarter through the following:  

 
a. Unified Reporting System (URS) or other electronic means for 

reports not covered by the URS; and 
b. Agency’s website 
 

The donee-agency concerned shall send written notice when said reports 
have been submitted or posted on its website to the DBM, House of 
Representatives, Senate of the Philippines, House Committee on 



91 
 

Appropriations, Senate Committee on Finance, COA and other offices 
where the submission of reports is required under existing laws, rules and 
regulations. The date of notice to said agencies shall be considered the 
date of compliance with this requirement.” 

 
10.2 COA Circular No. 2014-002 dated April 15, 2014 prescribes transparency of 

and accountability in the use of disaster relief aid/donations that have become 
an issue of considerable importance for donor, bilateral and multilateral 
organizations, other stakeholders and the public which is aggravated by the 
limited information on how these funds were being utilized. 

 
10.3 The above Circular covers the accounting and reporting on the receipt and 

utilization of NDRRMF; cash and in-kind aids/donations from local and 
foreign sources; and funds allocated from the agency regular budget for 
DRRM program. 

 
10.4 Section IV.B.2 prescribes that cash donations shall be acknowledged through 

the issuance of Official Receipt, (b) deposited with an authorized government 
depository bank (AGDB) under a separate bank account for DRRM Funds 
(DRRMF); and (c) entered in the Cash Receipts Record by the designated 
Collecting Officer. 

 
10.5 Included in the submitted GAD Accomplishment Report are the   activities 

that were undertaken by the PhilSCA Management with corresponding 
expenditures incurred per activity.  Interview with the GAD Focal person 
disclosed that the expenses incurred were from donations from private persons 
and entities/local sources.

10.6 Based on the above GAD AR, there were neither details of the actual 

expenditures incurred nor any report/documents to substantiate the amounts. 
Instead, lumpsum amounts were presented in the above report. 

 
10.7 Inquiry with the Accounting Office disclosed that they were not informed of 

these kinds of donations, as there was no proof of receipts and no amount was 
entered in the Cash Receipts Record of the Collecting Officer. Therefore, 
there was no entry made in the books of accounts. 

 
10.8 Further, there were no sufficient documentation on the receipt of these 

donations and no adequate information as basis to ensure accuracy of the 
reported amounts. There was neither OR issued nor deposited in any of the 
College bank account.  Hence, these donations, which may be in cash or in 
kind, were not recorded in the Report of Collections and Deposits. 

 
10.9 The Audit Team then requested documents to support the receipts and 

utilization of the above-cited donations. Below is the summary that the GAD 
Focal person has submitted to the Audit Team, to wit:

10.10 Additional documents that were being submitted were hand-written 
Acknowledgment Receipt of some goods from private individuals, copy of 
vehicle trip ticket (for the delivery of relief goods to Lipa City, Batangas), toll 
fees official receipts, pictures taken during repacking of goods at PhilSCA 
VAB Campus, and pictures taken during the distribution of the packed goods 
to the recipients. However, the Management failed to submit proof of 
collections if donations are in kind or in cash. 

 
10.11 It can be gleaned from the above summary that there were neither prices nor 

amount indicated per item. Therefore, the validity and propriety of the 
disbursements for these in-kind aids cannot be ascertained.

10.12 It is worth conveying that for the Activity No. 3 reported in the GAD AR, 
which is distribution of food packs, toiletries, etc. on June 12, 2020 for locally 
stranded individuals (both men and women) accommodated at PhilSCA 
Villamor Campus, COA Circular No. 2020-009 dated April 21, 2020 was 
issued for the temporary relaxation in the application of certain provisions of 
COA Circular No. 2014-002 dated April 15, 2014 and COA Memorandum 
No. 2014-009 dated August 28, 2014 in areas subject to quarantine during the 
period of the State of Calamity declared under Proclamation No. 929, dated 
March 16, 2020, thus certain provisions for this activity were temporarily 
relaxed. 

 
10.13 However, for the first two activities that were undertaken during the Taal 

Volcano Eruption in January 2020, provisions of COA Circular No. 2014-002 
which are necessary controls to ensure that all donations, be it in cash or in-
kind, are accounted for shall remain in effect. 

 
10.14 As a consequence of inadequate records and non-recording of cash and in-

kind donations, the College deprived its donors and other concerned 
stakeholders and the public in general, of quality financial reports that provide 
detailed information on the status of utilization of every donation of each 
donor per purpose. 

 
10.15 We recommended that Management: 

 

a. ensure that all donations, be in cash or in-kind, shall be recognized in 
the books of accounts and properly disclosed in the Notes to FSs; 

 

b. account for all other donations received by the College; and 
 

c. secure all the necessary documents supporting the receipt and 
utilization of all donations and submit to the Audit Team for audit. 

 

10.16 Management’s Comments: 
 
  The Management committed to ensure that all donations, be in cash or in-kind, 

shall be recognized and be recorded in the books of accounts; and shall be 
properly disclosed in the Notes to FSs.  

 

 

Excess balances of the proceeds from the sale of bidding documents not deposited to the 
National Treasury - ₱395,633.35 

 
11. Excess balances of the proceeds from the sale of bid documents after the 

authorized payment of honoraria to BAC members at the end of the year in the 

amount of ₱395,633.35 were not deposited to the National Treasury, contrary to 



95 
 

Budget Circular (BC) No. 2004-5A and RA No. 9184, thereby depriving the 

government of the use of funds for other programs and projects. 

 
11.1 DBM has issued BC No. 2004-5 dated March 23, 2004, which was superseded 

by BC No. 2004-5A dated October 7, 2005 that provides the guidelines on the 
grant of honoraria and overtime pay to government personnel involved in 
government procurement as authorized under RA No. 9184. 

 
11.2 Item No. 6.1 of BC No. 2004-5A provides that the amount necessary for the 

payment of the honoraria and overtime pay authorized therein shall be sourced 
only from the following: 

 
• Proceeds from sale of bid documents;  
• Fees from contractor/supplier registry;  
• Fees charged for copies of minutes of bid openings, BAC resolutions 

and other BAC documents;  
• Protest fees;  
• Liquidated damages; and  
• Proceeds from bid/performance security forfeiture. 

 
11.3 Item No. 6.2 of the same BC further provides that “pursuant to the 

DOF/DBM/COA Permanent Committee Resolution No. 2005-2 dated June 
2005, all agencies are authorized to treat the collections from all sources 
identified in Item No. 6.1 thereof as trust receipts to be used exclusively for 
the payment of honoraria and overtime pay as authorized. Agencies may 
utilize up to 100 percent of the said collections for the payment of honoraria 
and overtime pay subject to the guidelines in Item No. 5.0 of the said Circular. 
Any excess in the amount collected shall be remitted to the National 
Treasury.” 

 
11.4 Audit of the Report of Collections and Deposits showed that the proceeds 

from sale of bid documents to various bidders for the procurement activities 
undertaken for Infrastructure Projects and for Goods and Supplies for the 
period were deposited in the Special Trust Fund account of the College, with a 
total collection, including CY 2019 balances, amounting to ₱521,800.00, to 
wit:

For CY 2019 ₱ 201,200.00 
For CY 2020 320,600.00 
Total ₱ 521,800.00 

 
11.5 Per Cash Receipts Journal, the Accounting Office recorded the proceeds as 

Other Business Income. 
 



96 
 

11.6 The submitted report on utilization of the proceeds from the sale of bid 
documents disclosed the payment of honorarium for the successfully 
completed government projects conducted at PhilSCA-VAB Campus, and 
reimbursement of various expenses for the conduct of biddings/meetings of 
the PhilSCA Bids and Awards Committee (BAC), presented as follows:

Total ₱ 17,121.00 ₱186,838.60 ₱126,166.65 ₱ 77,792.95 

 
11.7 Based on the above tables, only the honoraria amounting to ₱126,166.65 shall 

be deducted from the collection of proceeds from the sale of bid documents of 
₱521,800.00, resulting in a net balance of ₱395,633.35. This amount shall be 
remitted in compliance with the above cited budget circular. 

 
11.8 Inquiry with the personnel of Accounting Office disclosed that the collections 

from sale of bidding documents are not remitted to the National Treasury. 
 

11.9 Non-remittance of excess balances of the proceeds from the sale of bid 
documents after the authorized payment of honoraria to BAC members at the 
end of the year deprived the government of the use of funds for other 
programs and projects. 

 
11.10 We recommended that Management: 

 

a. remit to the National Treasury the excess of the proceeds from sale of 
bid documents and from other sources over the actual payments for 

honoraria and overtime of BAC and other personnel involved in the 

Agency’s procurement activities at the end of the year, as enumerated 

in Paragraph 6.1 of BC No. 2004-5A dated October 7, 2005. 

 

b. use the BAC Fund solely for the honoraria and overtime pay as 
authorized under RA No. 9184. 

 

11.11 Management’s Comments: 
 

The Management commented to abide with the audit recommendations. 
 

Missing duplicate and triplicate copies of ORs 
 

12. Duplicate copies of 53 issued ORs totaling P233,352.50 were missing and not 
attached in the RCD which was submitted to the Audit Team after 72 days from 



97 
 

due date, thus rendered doubtful the validity and accuracy of the reported 

collections and deposits in the RCD, contrary to Section 64 of PD No. 1445 and 

pertinent provisions of Revised Rules and Regulations on the Settlement of 

Accounts (RRSA) and GAM for NGAs. 

 
12.1 Section 64 of PD No. 1445 states that the head of an agency may designate 

such number of collecting officers or agents as may be deemed necessary. 
They shall render reports of their collections, under the regulations of the 
Commission, to be submitted promptly to the auditor concerned who shall 
conduct the necessary examination and audit within thirty days from receipt 
thereof. 

 
12.2 Section 39, Chapter 5 on Revenue and Other Receipts, of GAM for NGAs 

Volume I prescribes the procedures on reporting of collections and deposits. 
Receipts and deposits shall be reported as follows: 

 
a. At the close of the business day, the Collecting Officers shall prepare 

the Report of Collections and Deposits (RCD) (Appendix 26) for 
submission to Accounting Office/Unit.  The report lists all the ORs 
issued in numerical sequence including cancelled ones.   

 
b. The RCD shall be supported by documentary evidence such as 

duplicate copies of ORs and validated deposit slips. 
 

12.3 This report shall be prepared in four (4) copies daily to be distributed as 
follows: 

 

Table 41.  Distribution of Report of Collections and Deposits (RCD) 

Original  – Cash Treasury/Unit/Collecting Officer's File, together with the 
triplicate copy of the ORs and validated DSs 

Copy 2  – COA Auditor thru the Accounting Division/Unit of 
Central/Regional/ Division Office concerned, together with the

Copy 3  – Accounting Division/Unit of Central/Regional/Division Office 
concerned to be attached to the copy of the JEV 

Copy 4 – Budget Division/Unit of Central/Regional/Division Office 
concerned 

 
12.4 Likewise, Sections 7.1 and 7.2 of the Revised Rules and Regulations on the 

Settlement of Accounts (RRSA), as prescribed under COA Circular No. 2009-
006 dated September 15, 2009, provide the responsibilities of the agency head 
and accountant for audit and settlement of accounts, pertinent portions of 
which are quoted below: 

 
 
 
 



98 
 

Section 7.2 Responsibility of the Agency Accountant 
 

7.2.1 The Chief Accountant. Bookkeeper or other authorized official 
performing accounting and/or bookkeeping functions of the audited 
agency shall ensure that: 

 
a) the reports and supporting documents submitted by the 

accountable officers are immediately recorded in the 
books of accounts and submitted to the Auditor within 
the first ten (10) days of the ensuing month; 

 
b) the financial records are made accessible at reasonable 

hours to the Auditor or his authorized representatives 
when needed; 

 
X xx. 

 
12.5 On January 22, 2021, the Accounting Office of PhilSCA VAB Campus 

submitted the RCD for the month of October 2020.  It is to be noted that this 
report shall be submitted within the first ten (10) days of the ensuing month, 
that is, on or before November 10, 2020. However, the submission of report 
incurred a significant delay of 72 days. 

 
12.6 Upon examination of the submitted RCD and attached deposit slips together 

with the bundles of duplicate copies of ORs, it was revealed that duplicate 
copies of 53 issued ORs on October 1, 2020 were not submitted, as 
summarized below:

12.7 The Audit Team immediately informed the Collecting Officer to submit the 
duplicate copies for examination and validation from the submitted RCDs. 

 



100 
 

12.8 However, on January 29, 2021, the Collecting Officer of PhilSCA VAB-
Campus conveyed through a letter informing the COA Office that the 
duplicate copies of aforesaid ORs were found missing, including the triplicate 
copies. 

 
12.9 In our assessment, had the Collecting Officer immediately prepared the RCD 

at the close of each business day, and forwarded to the Accounting Office for 
recording in the books of accounts, this incident could have been avoided.  
Likewise, he could have segregated both duplicate and triplicate copies of 
ORs had he acted simultaneously. He could have filed and retained the 
triplicate ones. 

 
12.10 Non-presentation by the Collecting Officer of the duplicate and triplicate 

copies of ORs rendered the validity and accuracy of the RCD doubtful. 
 

12.11 We recommended that Management require the concerned Collecting 
Officer to: 

 

a. submit to the Audit Team the ORs to document the collections of       

₱233,352.50 in the RCD within ten days from receipt hereof to 

preclude the issuance of a Notice of Suspension/Notice of Charge; 

and 

 

b. prepare the RCD immediately at the close of each business day and 

forward to the Accounting Office for recording and submission to 

the Audit Team within the first ten (10) days of the ensuing month. 

 

12.12 Management’s Comment: 
 

The Collecting Office contacted the payees concerned and requested 
photocopies therefrom and subsequently submitted to the Audit Team the 37 
missing issued ORs amounting to ₱223,312.50, while the duplicate copies of 
the remaining 16 missing ORs for collections amounting to ₱10,040.00 
remained unpresented.   

 
Hazard Pay during the Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ)   
 
13. The propriety of payments of hazard pay amounting to ₱4,803,500.00 to the 

officials and employees of PhilSCA during the ECQ due to COVID-19 outbreak 

cannot be ascertained either due to improperly signed and accomplished Daily 

Time Records (DTRs) and Service Reports (SRs) or the absence thereof, 

contrary to the provision of Section 5.8 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated 

June 14, 2012.   Also, there was overpayment of hazard pay of ₱18,500.00. 

 



101 
 

13.1 Section 5.8 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 prescribes the documentary 
requirements for the payment of hazard duty pay, to wit: 

 
• Certification by the Secretary of the Department of Science and Technology 

(DOST)/ Department of Health (DOH)/ Department of National Defense 
(DND)/ Director of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology 
that the place of assignment/travel is a strife-torn/embattled/disease-infested/ 
distresses or isolated areas/stations, or areas declared under state of calamity 
or emergency, or with volcanic activity and/or eruption; 

• Duly accomplished record of employees or travel report; 
• Copy of special order from the agency/department head covering the 

assignment to hazardous/difficult areas; and 
• Approved DTR/Service Report 

  
13.2 In the light of the declared State of Public Health Emergency due to COVID-

19, the Office of the President issued Administrative Order (AO) No. 26 dated 
March 23, 2020 authorizing the grant of hazard pay to government personnel 
who physically report for work during the period of implementation of an 
Enhanced Community Quarantine relative to the COVID-19 outbreak. 

 
13.3 DBM subsequently issued Budget Circular No. 2020-1 dated March 24, 2020 

prescribing the guidelines on the grant of the COVID-19 hazard pay. The 
following are some of its salient provisions: 

 
• Regular, contractual, or casual government personnel and workers 

engaged under contract of service (COS) or job order (JO) who have been 
authorized to physically report for work by the head of their 
agencies/offices during the ECQ are qualified to receive COVID-19 
hazard pay; 

 
• The COVID-19 hazard pay to be granted shall not exceed ₱500.00/day per 

person; 
 

• The grant of the COVID-19 hazard pay shall be effective beginning March 
17, 2020; and 

 
• An employee entitled to hazard pay or other similar benefits will continue 

to receive those benefits or the COVID-19 hazard pay, whichever is 
higher. 

 
13.4 Analysis on the payment of COVID-19 hazard pay revealed that the College 

issued several Office Memoranda authorizing the employees of PhilSCA to 
conduct work thru alternative work arrangements – Work from Home (WFH), 
Skeletal Work Force (SWF) and other flexible work schedules. 

 



102 
 

13.5 Audit of the disbursement vouchers (DVs) disclosed that the College paid 
₱4,803,500.00 as payment for the COVID-19 hazard pay to the officials and 
employees who were assigned in Skeletal Work Force (SWF) for the period of 
March 17 to December 20, 2020. 

 
13.6 Examination of the DVs and the attached supporting documents disclosed the 

following deficiencies: 
 

a. Daily Time Records (DTRs) and Service Reports were not 
properly signed and accomplished 

 
13.7 Review of the daily time records and service reports attached as supporting 

documents in the DVs revealed the following: 
 

• Daily Time Records (DTRs) were not properly and completely signed by the 
concerned employees’ and their immediate supervisors; instead, these were 
signed by the HRMD Director.  

 
• Name of the employees’ immediate supervisor was not indicated in the 

DTRs. 
 

• Handwritten time in and/or time out in the DTRs of some employees were 
supported with certification from the Security Office validating their 
attendance that were not captured by the biometrics machine. However, 
neither the handwritten time logs in the DTRs nor the certifications were 
signed/acknowledged by the immediate supervisor of the claimants-
employees.  

 
• Several service reports were also not completely signed by the concerned 

employees, recommending and immediate supervisors.  Moreover, the 
format and period covered in the service/accomplishment reports were varied 
and inconsistent (period covered were daily, weekly, bi-weekly, monthly 
basis).   

 
b. Duly accomplished time record and approved daily time 

record (DTRs)/ Service Reports were not attached 
 

13.8 Payment of COVID-19 hazard pay for the period of March 17 to August 19, 
2020 totaling ₱259,000.00 disclosed the following deficiencies:

13.9 As can gleaned from the above table, the payment of the Hazard Pay was not 

supported with proper and complete documentation, contrary to the provisions 
of Section 5.8 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012, thus 
validity of the claims cannot be determined. 

 
13.10 The certifications confirming the attendance of the claimants-employees 

instead of the required approved DTR is improper and inadequate to support 
the payment of Hazard Pay. Moreover, the said Certifications were signed by 
the Budget Officer-in-Charge, Budget Office (VAB Campus) and Campus 
Director (FAB Campus) who are neither the immediate supervisors of the 
claimants-employees nor the appropriate officials to certify the employees’ 
attendance. 

 
c. Overpayment of Hazard Pay 

 
13.11 One employee received a hazard pay equivalent to 43 work days totaling 

₱21,500.00 instead of ₱3,000.00, covering six days that were actually 
rendered by the Payee as shown in the DTR.  There were neither attached 
Certification nor copy of Logbook from the Security Office validating the 
attendance of the employee resulting in an overpayment of ₱18,500.00, with 
the following details:

13.12 Payment of hazard pay for the period of April 16 to December 19, 2020 

revealed that no approved service reports were submitted by several 
claimants-employees amounting to ₱313,000.00.   

 
13.13 While the services supposedly rendered by the officials and employees of the 

College during the state of national health emergency due to COVID-19 was 
exceptional and merits the grant of hazard pay, the Audit Team emphasizes 
the submission of complete and proper/authorized documentation as 
prescribed under Section 5.8 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 to support the 
reliability and validity of the claims. 

 
13.14 We recommended that Management: 

 



105 
 

a. substantiate, thru the HRMD and the concerned employees, the claims 
with duly accomplished and signed DTRs/SRs, to preclude the issuance 

of Notice of Suspension (NS); and  

 

b. require the concerned employee to refund the overpayment of hazard 
pay to prevent the issuance of Notice of Disallowance. 

 
13.15 Management’s Comments: 

 
The HRMD Director commented that they are now on the process of requiring 
the concerned personnel to submit their Accomplishment Report (approved 
service report) and called the attention of their immediate supervisors to sign 
the DTRs of their subordinates as documentary requirements for the payment 
of hazard pay. 

 
Budget Utilization on Research Programs, Projects and Activities 
 
14. The minimal utilization of the budget for research projects, programs and 

activities (PPAs) of only ₱34,285.48 or less than one percent of the ₱5,083,027.91 

allocated budget, defeated the goals and objectives of the College to establish 

research culture by promoting and enhancing research awareness among 

faculty members and students and to conduct relevant and high impact 

researches in the fields of Aeronautical education.  

 
14.1 Section 8, Article III on the Specific Budgetary Allocation of the CHED 

Memorandum Order No. 20 series of 2011 on Policies and Guidelines for the 
Use of Income, Special Trust Fund and Programs of Receipt and Expenditures 
of the SUCs mandates that: 

 
 “Section 8. Budget Allocation for Research Services (10%) of tuition 
fees – Budget allocation for the second major function of the SUC, 
the research function, shall be set at a fixed rate of ten percent (10%) 
of tuition fees after deducting allowance for college wide common 
administrative costs. Said allocation shall be used for the objects of 
expenditure related to the formulation or implementation of 
programs, projects, and activities, such as but not limited to 
honoraria and incentives of researchers, lecturers, or research 
presenters, research assistants (with contract of employment), and 
wages of other personnel, office and IT equipment, facilities, supplies 
and materials, training and travel expenses, in-house research 
review, research presentation in appropriate forum and other 
research activities or undertaking that is geared towards producing 
research outputs that would be beneficial for the development of the 
community or locality where the SUC is located.”  

 



106 
 

14.2 The State Colleges and Universities (SUCs) perform three basic functions 
namely: instruction, research and extension services to achieve objectives 
under its respective charter. The research program/project plays a significant 
role in SUCs effective operations but also in directing the educational process 
towards the attainment of growth and development objectives pertinent to its 
institution and or/ national development. 

 
14.3 The PhilSCA’s Research Manual was approved by its Academic Council 

(AC) under AC Resolution No. 05 s. 2011. The Manual established the 
Research and Development Center (RDC) to be headed by a Director who 
reports directly to the College President. The Manual states the RDC’s vision, 
mission and goals and objectives, to wit: 

 
Vision:   PhilSCA shall be the leading research engine in 
aeronautical technology in the country responding to society’s needs 
of improving the aviation industry to satisfy demands for better 
quality and safety in air transportation. 

 
Mission:  To generate and disseminate knowledge in aeronautical 
sciences through meaningful and challenging research programs in 
aircraft design, innovations, maintenance and operations and 
aviation information technology for the benefit of the people and the 
society. 

 
Goals and Objectives: 
• Strengthen R & D capabilities in terms of both manpower and 

research facilities as a strategy for long-term excellence and 
competitiveness. 

• Establish research culture by promoting and enhancing 
research awareness among faculty members and students. 

• Provide financial support through research and scholarship 
grants. 

• Encourage research collaboration and cooperation among 
members of the academic community and other institutions 
locally and internationally. 

• Conduct relevant and high impact researches in the fields of 
Aeronautical education. 

 
14.4 The College allocated ₱5,083,027.91 for the implementation of research 

programs, projects and activities, as disclosed in their PRE of FY 2020, and 
supported by the FY 2020 Annual Procurement Plan (APP), presented as 
follows:

Total 5,083,027.91 

 
14.5 Review of the supporting PPMPs for the research revealed that the allocated 

budget shall be used for the remuneration of employee/s, procurement of 
supplies and equipment; personnel development activities; research 
collaboration activities; attendance to local and international 
trainings/workshops; publication of research journals; and research grants/ 
incentives.  The PPMP was signed only by the Director of the Research and 
Extension office. 

 
14.6 Examination on the implementation of the PPAs and utilization of budget for 

research revealed that only ₱34,285.48 or less than one percent of the 
₱5,083,027.91 budget was utilized for meetings conducted and travel and 
training/workshop attended, which disbursements were not properly 
documented, as shown in the table below:

14.10 We recommended that Management 

a. activate the research function of the College thru the implementation 
of the budgeted and programmed research projects and activities in 

line with its objective of promoting and enhancing research awareness 

and developing high impact researches in the fields of aeronautical 

education; and 
 

b. submit relevant supporting documents on the research-related 
expenses amounting to ₱34,285.48 to preclude the issuance of a Notice 

of Suspension/Notice of Disallowance by COA. 
 

14.11 Management’s Comments: 
 

a. The Management commented that due to the unforeseen situation of the 
COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the College halted the conduct of various 
activities pertaining to the research and development, thus implementation 
of the PPAs was not achieved. 
 
The Director for Research submitted relevant documents for research-
related expenses amounting to ₱15,565.48. 

 
14.12 Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 
The Audit Team noted that not all required documents were submitted, hence 
it is reiterating the submission of complete documents on research-related 
expenses.

OTHER COMPLIANCE ISSUES 

 
Gender and Development (GAD)  

 
15. Out of the proposed GAD Budget of ₱4,285,000.00, only ₱25,560.00 was utilized 

and only 2.42 percent instead of the five percent of the PhilSCA annual budget 

of ₱176,816,000.00 was programmed for GAD programs and projects, which 

was inconsistent with Section 6.1 of the Philippine Commission on Women 

(PCW)-National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) and 

Department of Budget and Management (DBM) Joint Circular No. 2012-01 and 

Section 31 of the GAA for FY2020; and 16 out of 17 targeted activities in the 

GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) were not accomplished while three activities not 

included therein with incurred expenditures of ₱820,000.00  were accomplished,  

as presented in the GAD Accomplishment Report (AR). 

 
15.1 Section 6.1 of R.A. 9710 of PCW-NEDA-DBM JC No. 1012-01 provides 

that: 
 

“At least five percent of the total agency budget appropriations 
authorized under the annual GAA shall correspond to activities 
supporting GAD plans and programs. The GAD budget shall be 
drawn from the agency’s maintenance and other operating expenses 
(MOOE), capital outlay (CO), and personal services (PS). It is 
understood that the GAD budget does not constitute an additional 
budget over an agency’s total budget appropriations.” 

 
15.2 Section 31 of the General Provisions of RA No. 11465, the GAA for FY 2020 

provides that: 
 

“All agencies of the government shall formulate a Gender and 
Development (GAD) Plan designed to address gender issues within 
their concerned sectors or mandate and implement the applicable 
provisions under R.A. No 9710 or the Magna Carta of Women, 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
Against Women, the Beijing Platform for Action, The Philippine Plan 
for Gender-Responsive Development (1995-2025), and the Philippine 
Development Plan (2017-2022).”   

 
15.3 Verification of PhilSCA’s GPB for CY 2020 revealed that only ₱4,285,000.00 

or 2.42 percent was allocated for GAD out of the required five percent of the 
Agency’s total budget of ₱176,816,000.00 or a deficiency of ₱4,555,800.00.

15.5 Section 8 of PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01 provides that: 

 
“8.1 Pursuant to Section 37A.1 of the MCR-IRR, all agencies, offices, 
bureaus and all government instrumentalities and others concerned 
shall formulate their annual GAD Plans and Budgets (GPB) within 
the context of their mandates. 

 
8.2 The GFPS of the agency shall review all submitted GPBs and as 
needed, provide comments or recommendations for revision. Agency 
review of GPBs   shall focus on the alignment of the GAD plan with 
the GAD agenda and the correctness and alignment of the entries in 
each column of the GPB template, e.g. if the proposed activities 
respond to the identified gender issue or cause of the issue, the issues 
are correctly identified or formulated, if there are clear indicators 
and targets, if the proposed budget is realistic, if the number of 
proposed activities are doable within the year, among others. The 
GFPS shall then submit the final GPBs and the corresponding GAD 
ARs to PCW for review and endorsement to DBM.   

 
xxxx 

 
8.7   Agencies shall submit their PCW-endorsed GPB to DBM along 
with their annual GAD Accomplishment Report for the previous year 
in accordance with the budget call.  



115 
 

 
8.8  Once the GAA has been approved and where budget and 
program adjustments have to be made based on final agency budgets, 
agencies shall submit an adjusted GPB to PCW.  The adjusted GPB 
shall be the basis for implementing the GPB, as well as, for 
monitoring and reporting.  

 
15.6 Just like in previous years, PhilSCA’s GPB was not reviewed and endorsed 

by the PCW, contrary to Section 8 of the said Joint Circular. 

15.7 This resulted in non-assurance on the propriety and validity of the total 
expenses incurred as contained in the submitted GAD AR.   

 
15.8 Based on the GAD AR, PhilSCA spent only ₱25,560.00 attributed to training 

and capability building which was way below the total agency GPB for CY 
2020 of ₱4,285,000.00. Moreover, out of the 17 identified activities in the 
2020 GPB, only one was completed and the remaining sixteen were not 
accomplished. Consequently, identified gender issues and concerns were not 
fully addressed by the College. Still, the approved GPB was not strictly 
followed by the College. 

 
15.9 In the the submitted GAD AR, the Audit Team likewise noted that there were 

three activities with incurred expenditures of ₱820,000.00 that were 
undertaken and reflected in GAD AR although not included in the GPB for 
CY 2020.  

 
15.10 The conducted activities per GAD AR were within the context of the 

PhilSCA’s mandate to mainstream gender perspectives in their policies, 
programs and projects.  However, the validity and propriety of the reported 
accomplishments and utilization of GAD funds may be refuted due to the 
absence of the PCW-reviewed/endorsed GPB.  

 
15.11 Furthermore, the continued non-allocation of the required GAD budget 

precluded PhilSCA to achieve fully the objectives of the GAD program. 
 

15.12 Section V of COA Circular No. 2014-001 dated March 18, 2014 requires that 
the audited agency shall submit a copy of the Annual GAD Plan and Budget 
to the Audit Team assigned to the agency within five working days from the 
receipt of the approved plan from the PCW or their mother or central offices 
(CO), as the case maybe. Likewise, a copy of the corresponding 
Accomplishment Report shall be furnished to the Audit Team within five 
working days from the end of January of the preceding year. 

 
15.13 We recommended that the GAD Focal Committee: 

 
a. allocate the five percent of the College appropriations for GAD 

activities thru attribution of its regular programs and activities to 



116 
 

GAD, in compliance with the requirements of the PCW-NEDA-DBM 

JC No. 2012-01 and the General Provisions of FY 2021 GAA; 

 

b. prepare and submit the GPB, thru the GAD Focal Point System 
(GFPS), for review of the PCW and for endorsement to DBM; and   

submit the reviewed and endorsed GPB and the corresponding AR to 

the Audit Team within the prescribed period in compliance with 

COA Circular No. 2014-001 dated March 18, 2014; 

 

c. develop a GPB with PPAs that will be more responsive to the gender 
issues envisioned to promote gender equality among its employees 

and students; and 

 

d. fully implement those identified GAD related activities in the 
approved GPB, thru the Chair of the GAD Focal Point System. 

 

15.14 Management’s Comments: 
 

The Management commented that in the proposed PhilSCA GPB, there were 
series of activities lined up but due to the COVID-19 pandemic and 
declaration of national lockdown in March 2020, it was impossible for them to 
implement such.  

They further committed that PhilSCA Management, through the GAD Focal 
Point System, will exert its effort to be GAD compliant and successfully 
implement the approved and endorsed PhilSCA GPB for CY 2021. 

 
Senior Citizens (SCs) and Persons with Disabilities (PWDs) 
 

16. PhilSCA did not formulate plans and programs that will address concerns of 
SCs and PWDs of the College, contrary to Section 32 of the General Provisions 

of RA No. 11465, the GAA for FY 2020. 

 

16.1 Section 32 of the General Provisions of RA No. 11465 provides that all 
agencies of the government shall formulate plans, programs and projects 
intended to address the concerns of senior citizens and persons with disability, 
insofar as it relates to their mandated functions, and integrate the same in their 
regular activities. 

 
16.2 Moreover, all government infrastructures and facilities shall provide 

architectural or structural features, designs or facilities that will reasonably 
enhance mobility, safety and welfare of persons with disability pursuant to 
Batas Pambansa Blg. 344 and RA No. 7277, as amended. 

 



117 
 

16.3 In the reply to our inquiry letter addressed to the Management dated February 
16, 2021, the Vice-President for Admin and Finance informed the Audit Team 
that there were still no concrete programs for Senior Citizens in particular but 
for the Differently Abled Persons, concerns were considered and integrated to 
all proposed infra projects. 

 

16.4 We recommended that Management strictly comply with the provisions 
of law to address the concerns of the Senior Citizens and Persons with 

Disabilities/Differently-abled Persons of the College. 
 
Compliance with Tax Laws 
 
17. In compliance with the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) Revenue Regulation 

No. 10-2008 dated July 8, 2008 for compensation and Revenue Memorandum 

Circular No. 23-2007 dated March 22, 2007 for government money payments 

due or payable to all suppliers of goods and/or services, PhilSCA was able to 

withhold and remit taxes amounting to ₱16,114,761.04 during CY 2020.  

 
17.1 Executive Order (EO) No. 651 dated February 16, 1981 requires government 

offices, agencies and instrumentalities to comply strictly with the laws and 
regulations on withholding and remittance of taxes. Such directive was 
reiterated under BIR Revenue Regulations 1-87 dated April 2, 1987 and 
Revenue Memorandum Order No. 8-2003 dated March 3, 2003. 

 
17.2 BIR Revenue Regulation No. 10-2008 dated July 8, 2008 prescribes the 

pertinent provisions on the withholding of income tax on compensation. 
 

17.3 Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 23-2007 dated March 22, 2007 
prescribes the guidelines on the computations of withholding taxes and other 
requirements on government money payments due or payable to suppliers of 
goods and/or services. 

 
17.4 Records and per audit of the monthly BIR Forms 1619Es, 1601EQs 1601-Cs, 

1600s and Tax Remittance Advices (TRA)  showed that taxes withheld in CY 
2020 amounted to ₱14,591,095.37,  details  as follows:

 Incurred Interest/penalties for delayed remittance of GSIS premiums  
 
18. Incurrence of interest/penalties totaling ₱453,128.63, caused by the delayed 

remittances of premiums due to GSIS, were paid out of Agency’s fund instead 



119 
 

of charging it to the accountable officers and employees responsible for the 

delay, which resulted in unnecessary losses and wastage of College’ funds. 

 
18.1 Section 2 2 of PD No. 1445 provides that it is the declared policy of the State 

that all resources of the government shall be managed, expended or utilized in 
accordance with law and regulations, and safeguarded against loss or wastage 
through illegal or improper disposition, with a view to ensuring efficiency, 
economy and effectiveness in the operations of government. The 
responsibility to take care that such policy is faithfully adhered to rests 
directly with the chief or head of the government agency concerned. 

 
18.2 Section 14.1, Rule III of RA No. 8291, the GSIS Act of 1997 requires that 

each government agency shall remit directly to the GSIS the employees’ and 
government agency’s contributions within the first ten days of the calendar 
month following the month to which the contributions apply. The remittance 
by the government agency of the contributions to the GSIS shall take priority 
over and above the payment of any and all obligations, except salaries and 
wages of its employees. 

 
18.3 Section 7 of the same RA discusses interests on delayed remittances that 

“Agencies which delay the remittance of any and all monies due the GSIS 
shall be charged interests as may be prescribed by the Board but not less than 
two percent (2%) simple interest per month. Such interest shall be paid by the 
employers concerned.” 

 
18.4 During CY 2020, PhilSCA remitted their premium in arrears totaling 

₱2,141,730.90 covering the period January 2012 to February 2020, 
summarized as follows:

18.5 Examination of subsequent payment to GSIS revealed that PhilSCA paid 
₱453,128.63 for the interest which resulted from the delayed remittances, 
presented as follows:

Total  ₱ 453,128.63 
 

18.6 Attached to the DV is an information letter from GSIS acknowledging the 
receipt of supplemental remittances for the months due (January 2015 to 
February 2020); and notifying the College for the immediate settlement of 
interest incurred due to the delayed remittances. 

 
18.7 Further, interest for the delayed remittances covering the period of February 

2012 to December 2014 (31 months due) has yet to be settled and/or 
condoned. The College has yet to forward to the COA Office the DV and/or 
any corresponding document as proof of payment and/or condonation. 

 
18.8 The incurrence and payment of such interest caused by delayed remittances of 

premiums to GSIS indicated oversight by the responsible officials and 
unnecessary losses/wastage of the College funds, contrary to Section 2 of PD 
No. 1445. 

 
18.9 Also, the delayed remittances of premiums to the GSIS might adversely affect 

the retirement benefits and claims of the employees of PhilSCA. 
 

18.10  Sound fiscal management dictates that all obligations shall be settled on or 
before due dates to avoid penalties and charges. Non-compliance therewith 
shall make the responsible employees liable to any penalties and surcharges 
caused by the delays. 

 
18.11 We recommended that Management: 

 

a. submit justification for the delayed remittances for evaluation of the 
Audit Team to determine whether the issuance of Notice of 

Disallowance (ND) is warranted;  

 

b. settle all the due premium remittances and interest to the GSIS 
immediately; and 

 

c. ensure complete and timely remittances of premiums to the GSIS, to 
avoid incurrence of unnecessary interest, otherwise the persons 

responsible for the delay shall be administratively and pecuniarily 

liable therefor. 

 



121 
 

18.12  Management’s Comment: 
 

The HRMD justified that the delayed remittances were due to the updating of 
the GSIS (software system) and that the notice on arrears incurred in the prior 
years were only transmitted last year (CY 2020). 

 
Compliance with GSIS, HDMF and PhilHealth on remittance of premiums 

 
19. For CY 2020, PhilSCA had faithfully withheld from the salaries of its personnel 

and remitted the required premiums to the concerned agencies within the 

prescribed period as provided under pertinent rules and regulations. However, 

remittances of government share premium by DBM-GSIS on behalf of PhilSCA 

cannot be determined and validated due to non-submission of supporting 

documents and schedules. 

 
19.1 Section 1, Rule VI of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of RA No. 

9679, the Home Development Mutual Fund Law of 2009 states the rates of 
contributions: 

 
a. Employees earning not more than One thousand five hundred 

pesos (₱1,500.00) per month – one percent (1%). 
 
b. Employees earning more than One thousand five hundred pesos 

(₱1,500.00) per month- two percent (2%). 
 
c. All employers – two percent (2%) of the monthly compensation of 

all covered employees. 
 

The maximum monthly compensation to be used in computing employee and 
employer contributions shall not be more than Five thousand pesos (₱5, 000.00). 

 
a. Remittance of Premiums to HDMF CY 2020 

 
19.2 Total remittances to HDMF for CY 2020 amounted to ₱3,227,337.21, which 

pertained to the current employees and government premium contributions, as 
well as the payment of employees’ loans, shown as follows:

19.4 Section 14.1, Rule III of RA No. 8291, the GSIS Act of 1997, requires that 

each government agency shall remit directly to the GSIS the employees’ and 
government agency’s contributions within the first ten days of the calendar 
month following the month to which the contributions apply. The remittance 
by the government agency of the contributions to the GSIS shall take priority 
over and above the payment of any and all obligations, except salaries and 
wages of its employees. 

 
19.5 DBM Circular Letter (CL) No. 2020-6 dated March 30, 2020, supplemented 

by DBM Circular Letter No. 2020-7 dated April 16, 2020, prescribes the 
revised payment arrangements of employer (government) share in retirement 
and life insurance premium (RLIP) contribution remitted to the GSIS. 

 
19.6 Section 3 of DBM Circular Letter (CL) No. 2020-6 dated March 30, 2020 

states “As a result of the existence of a National Emergency arising from the 
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), GSIS, through the Department of 
Finance, requested the timely remittance of the government share in premium 
contribution to ensure that any benefit pay-outs required by its members are 
fully provided.” 

 
19.7 Section 4.1 of the above CL further states that “While the full year 

requirement of the government share in RLIP have been released 
comprehensively under General Allotment Release Order (GARO) No. 2020-1 
dated January 6, 2020, all concerned departments/ agencies are advised that 
the amounts covering the 12% government share in premium contribution for 
the period April to December 2020 are hereby withdrawn effective 
immediately. Accordingly, the negative GARO shall be issued for the purpose 
covering the 2nd to 4th quarters funding requirement of the government 
share.” 

 



123 
 

19.8 Section 4.2 of the same CL prescribes “Starting April 2020, the DBM shall 
directly remit to the GSIS the government share in the RLIP contribution for 
all departments, bureaus and offices of the national government. A Special 
Allotment Release Order (SARO) reflecting the DBM as the responsible 
department charged with the remittance of the government share of the 
premium contribution to GSIS shall be issued. The corresponding Notice of 
Cash Allocation (NCA) will likewise be released to the DBM on a quarterly 
basis. 

 
19.9 Section 2.1 of DBM Circular Letter No. 2020-7 dated April 16, 2020 states 

that the DBM shall issue the negative SARO to immediately withdraw the 
amounts covering the second to the fourth quarter RLIP requirements for FY 
2020, earlier authorized by SAROs issued as of March 31, 2020, as 
applicable.

months of April to December 2020 were directly remitted/ paid by the DBM

19.12  In pursuance to the CL, DBM issued GARO No. 2020-2 dated April 2, 2020 

to adjust the allotment of the RLIP contributions of PhilSCA in the amount of 
₱6,053,000.00.

amounting to ₱517,000.00 to PhilSCA, to withdraw the government share for 
RLIP contributions. 

 



124 
 

19.14 However, government share premium remitted by DBM to GSIS on behalf of 
PhilSCA cannot be determined and validated due to non-submission of 
supporting documents and schedules (e.g., official receipts, confirmation 
letter, etc.). 

 
19.15  We commended the Management on their timely remittances of the 

required premiums due to HDMF, PhilHealth and GSIS. 

 
19.16 Management’s Comments: 

 
The Management submitted eBilling and Collection System (eBCS) of GSIS – 
summary amounting to ₱6,526,281.96 for the government share of PhilSCA 
covering the months of April to December 2020. 

 
Compliance with RA No. 656 or the Property Insurance Law  
 
20. As required under COA Circular No. 92-390 dated November 17, 1992 and RA 

No. 656, as amended by PD No. 245 dated July 13, 1973. PhilSCA insured its 

buildings, equipment/aircrafts, supplies and materials as well as its service 

vehicles in CY 2020, however, the insurance coverage amounted to 

₱483,378,301.92, which is higher by ₱347,604,285.41 compared with the total 

PPE total amount of only ₱135,774,016.51 reported in the submitted Property 

Inventory Form (PIF) under COA Circular No. 2018-002 dated May 31, 2018.  

Moreover, an insured Motor Vehicle (MV) was not recorded in the books, while 

four booked up MVs were not insured. 
 

20.1 RA No. 656, otherwise known as the Property Insurance Law, as amended by 
PD No. 245, requires all government agencies (except municipal governments 
below first class category) to insure against any insurable risk their properties, 
assets and interests with the General Insurance Fund (GIF), as administered by 
the GSIS. 

 
20.2 Section 3.1 of COA Circular No. 92-390 dated November 17, 1992 requires 

the responsibility of all heads of national agencies, local government units and 
government-owned or -controlled corporations on the preparation and 
submission of the inventory of all insurable physical assets. 

 
20.3 COA Circular No. 2018-002 dated May 31, 2018 prescribes the submission of 

the PIF as basis for the assessment of general insurance coverage over all 
insurable assets, properties, and interests of the government with the GIF of 
the GSIS. It is being issued to assist in the implementation of the provisions of 
RA No. 656, as amended, on the insurance and bonding of risks on insurable 
government assets and properties with the GIF.

a) Discrepancy of Insurance Coverage between Submitted PIF and 
Insurance Policies 

 
20.4 On October 15, 2020, PhilSCA submitted to the COA Office the PIF as of 

December 31, 2019, which showed a total of ₱135,774,016.51 as acquisition 
cost/ insurable interest of PPEs and inventories. However, the submitted PIF 
cannot be validated due to non-submission of the Report on the Physical 
Count of Inventories (RPCI) and Report on the Physical Count of Property, 
Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE). 

 
20.5 PhilSCA paid ₱2,890,110.25 insurance premiums to insure its school 

buildings, equipment/aircraft, supplies and materials and motor vehicles, with 
total insurance coverage in the amount of ₱483,378,301.92 based on the 
attached photocopies of insurance policies, presented as follows:

20.6 Comparison between the insurance coverage and the properties listed in the 

PIF resulted in a discrepancy amounting to ₱347,604,285.41 in insurable 
amount, determined as follows:

20.7 The College did not adhere to the provisions of COA Circular No. 2018-002 

dated May 31, 2018 which prescribes that the PIF shall be the basis for the 
assessment of general insurance coverage of all insurable assets, properties 
and interests with the GIF of the GSIS. 

 
b) Insured Motor Vehicle Unrecorded in the Books and Four Motor 

Vehicles Were Not Insured 
 

20.8 Evaluation revealed that PhilSCA paid ₱39,041.06 for the insurance of its 
motor vehicles listed in the submitted PIF, shown as follows:

20.9 Analysis revealed that the motor vehicle located in PhilSCA-BAB Campus 

Pampanga with insurable interest amounting to ₱822,200.00 in the PIF was 
not recorded in the books of accounts of PhilSCA. 

 
20.10 Moreover, based on the PPELC submitted by the Accounting Office, four 

motor vehicles totaling ₱1,299,153.49 were not listed in the PIF, thus were not 
insured with the GSIS, presented as follows:

20.11 We recommended that Management:

PIF and the values of insured properties to ascertain the amount of 

overpaid insurance premiums for possible refund from the GSIS or 

application for ensuing year’s property insurance premiums;  

 

b. submit to the Audit Team justification for the disparity in the values 
of properties as basis of decision in audit;

Provincial Government of Pampanga for the unrecognized motor vehicle 
(Mitsubishi L300 Exceed B2-D537) located in PhilSCA-BAB Campus.  
However, the MV remained unbooked due to incomplete documentation to 
determine its value.
