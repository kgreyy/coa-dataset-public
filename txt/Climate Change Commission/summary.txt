Management’s assertion on the financial statements; b) determine the propriety of 

transactions as well as extent of compliance on the applicable laws, rules and 

regulations; c) recommend agency’s improvement opportunities; and d) determine 

the extent of implementation of prior year’s audit recommendations. Moreover, the 

audit was conducted in accordance with International Standards of Supreme Audit 

Institutions (ISSAIs). 

 

 

E. Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements 
 

The auditor rendered an unqualified opinion on the fairness of the presentation 

of the financial statements as of December 31, 2020. 
 

 

F. Summary of Significant Observations and Recommendations 
 

The following are the significant audit observations and the corresponding 

recommendations, which were discussed with Management officials concerned, 

details of which are discussed in Part II of this report. Management views and 

comments were incorporated in the report, where appropriate. 
  
1.   Errors in the computation of depreciation of information technology equipment 

resulted in unrecorded depreciation charges and accumulated depreciation by 

₱74,343.16 and ₱42,879.52, respectively. Moreover, deficiencies were noted in 

property management such as none submission to the Accounting Unit by the 

Property Office the documents of the transferred property items; lost Property, 

Plant and Equipment (PPE) item of ₱3,083.44 still accounted for in the books; 

and recognizing in the books Communication Equipment instead of ICTE with 

carrying amount of ₱208,506.30. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 

a) instruct the Property Unit to: 
 

(i) obtain approval from the head of agency on the transfer of properties 
and submit the original copies of Property Transfer Report (PTR) for 

transferred properties completely, as to form and substance; and 

 



iv 

 

(ii) submit the documents for the transferred PPE to the Accounting Unit, 
for its derecognition in the books. 

 

b) require the Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) to: 
 

(i) be aware of the pertinent rules and regulations on the transfer or 
donation of PPE; and    
 

(ii) notify the Accountable Officer of her accountability regarding the lost 
laptop. 

  
c) instruct the Chief Accountant to prepare adjusting entries, when necessary. 

 

2. Deficiencies were noted in the procurement of six consultancy services, such as       
a) non-compliance with the mode of procurement as indicated in the Annual 

Procurement Plan (APP) and  absence of approval by the head of the procuring 

entity (HOPE) on the use of alternative mode; b) three contracts lacking in 

provisions on expected deliverables, time frame, coverage, effectivity date, and 

penalties in case of breach of contract; and c) one contract of which payment of 

₱411,710.50 was made for undelivered services.  
 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the: 
 

a) Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) to strictly adhere to the Revised 
Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA No. 9184, and on the 

need for BAC Resolution and approval of the HOPE for any changes in the 

mode of procurement; 
 

b) Legal Office to include necessary provisions/stipulations in the contracts of 
expected deliverables/output, timeline of submission, effectivity date/period 

of the contract and penal clause in case of breach of contract, to protect the 

interest of the agency;  
 

c) Chief Accountant to ensure completeness of supporting documents before 
processing payment of services, and  

 

d) The concerned consultants to submit the pending required scope of work as 
stated in the contract to the Accounting Office. 

 

3.   Fund transfers to Local Government Units (LGUs) totaling ₱516,000.00 as at 
December 31, 2020 remained unliquidated for more than three years after the 

completion of the project sometimes in CY 2017, due to lack of provisions in the 

Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) on project implementation timelines and 

non-issuance of demand letter to the LGU officials and personnel concerned, 

contrary to Item 4.6 of COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994. 

 

 

 



v 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 

a) instruct the Accounting Office to issue demand letters to the concerned 
LGUs for the liquidation of the fund transfer; and 

 

b) henceforth, require the Legal Officer to include in every MOA, entered into 
by CCC, the necessary stipulations on time frame/period covered and 

timelines for project implementation/working procedure. 

 

4. The provisions of the contracts/agreements by and between CCC and private 
entities on the refund of security/consumption deposits totaling ₱298,110.36 as 

at December 31, 2020 were not enforced, despite the expiration/termination of 

the lease term/contract agreements, resulting in uncollected 

security/consumption deposits. 
 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the CAO to enforce the 

provision of the contract/agreement, and demand the refund of the 

security/consumption deposits of terminated/expired contracts/agreements. 

 

5.   The year-end account balance of Due from National Government Agencies 
(NGAs) Procurement Services – Department of Budget and Management (PS-

DBM) representing undelivered common-used office supplies of ₱96,812.40 and 

₱187,295.34 for the prior year and current year, respectively, accumulated to 

₱284,107.74 due to the failure of the agency to reapply it on subsequent 

procurement or request for its refund; hence, might become idle in the hands of 

PS-DBM. 
 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief Accountant to: 
 

a) make representation to PS-DBM for the refund of the outstanding advances 
pertaining to undelivered items for CYs 2019 and prior years, to avoid 

accumulation and dormancy of receivables that might become idle; and 
 

b) request the proof of reversion, and record the same in the books if already 
reverted by the PS-DBM to the National Treasury. 

 

 

G. Implementation of Prior Year’s Audit Recommendations 
 

Of the 16 audit recommendations embodied in the CY 2019 Annual Audit 

Report, 9 were implemented and 7 were not implemented. The details are presented 

in Part III of this report.
