OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

 

A. Financial Audit 
 

Deficiencies in property management 
 

1. Errors in the computation of depreciation of information technology 
equipment resulted in unrecorded depreciation charges and accumulated 

depreciation by ₱74,343.16 and ₱42,879.52, respectively. Moreover, 

deficiencies were noted in property management such as non submission to the 

Accounting Unit by the Property Office the documents of the transferred 

property items; lost PPE item of ₱3,083.44 still accounted for in the books; and 

recognizing in the books Communication Equipment instead of ICTE with 

carrying amount of ₱208,506.30. 

 

a)  Erroneous Depreciation Expense 

 

Section 27, Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM provides, among others, that 

depreciation of asset begins when it is available for use such as when it is in the 

location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner 

intended by Management. The depreciation of an asset does not cease when the 

asset becomes idle or is retired from active use and held for disposal unless the 

asset is fully depreciated. Further, Depreciation shall be recognized on a monthly 

basis.  

 

We verified the depreciation charges of the ICTE and its corresponding 

accumulated depreciation amounting to ₱966,619.50 and ₱3,020,740.73, 

respectively as at December 31, 2020. Recalculation showed that depreciation 

charges was understated and accumulated depreciation was overstated by 

₱74,343.16 and ₱42,879.52, respectively. 

 

Account Per Books Per Audit Difference 

Depreciation Expenses - ICTE 966,619.50 1,040,962.66 74,343.16 

Accumulated Depreciation - ICTE 3,020,740.75 2,977,861.22 42,879.53 

 

The errors in the above accounts resulted in the understatements of the 

depreciation charges – ICTE by ₱74,343.16, Accumulated Depreciation – ICTE by 

₱31,463.64 and Accumulated Surplus by ₱42,879.52. 

 

b)   Donated property  to a Barangay was without PTR 

 

Section 15, Chapter 10, Volume I of the Government Accounting Manual 

(GAM) provides that the transfer from one government entity to another shall be 



28 

 

recognized by the recipient entity at carrying value while the transferor shall 

derecognize the PPE account upon transfer. 

 

Random inspection of the PPEs revealed that two properties with a total cost 

of ₱99,008.60 were missing or non-existing during inspection. Inquiry disclosed 

that said properties were donated to a barangay in Cavite, with the following 

details:

Total 99,008.60 90,245.50 8,763.10 

 

Verification showed that the donated PPE were not derecognized yet in the 

books of accounts of the agency due to the failure of the Property Unit to submit to 

the Accounting Unit the documents on the transferred PPE.  

 

It was likewise observed that the PTR was approved by the Chief 

Administrative Officer (CAO) and not the Head of the Agency, contrary to Section 76 

of PD No. 1445. 

  

Moreover, the PTR for the donated conference table does not include a 

signature of the recipient signifying receipt of the donated property. Instead, 

evidence of receipt of the item was verified through attachment of the gate pass 

containing the item with signatures of the requesting party and the guard on duty. 

The Property Officer may have overlooked the absence of the signature of the 

recipient in the PTR. It was likewise confirmed by the CAO that the Secretary had a 

verbal approval on the transfer of property to the LGUs.  

  

This shows laxity in the internal control which could be avoided had 

Management been aware of the pertinent COA provisions on. 

 

c) Lost Property remained accounted in the books as PPE 
 

Section 41, Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM I provides the following 

accounting policies on loss of property: 

 

a. When a loss of government funds or property occurs while they 
are in transit or the loss is caused by fire, theft, or other 

casualty or force majeure, the officer accountable thefore or 

having custody thereof shall immediately notify the 



29 

 

Commission or the auditor concerned and, within thirty days or 

such longer period as the Commission or auditor may in 

particular case allow, shall present his applicable for relief with 

the available supporting evidence. Whenever warranted by the 

evidence credit for the loss shall be allowed. An officer who 

fails to comply with this requirement shall not be relieved of 

liability or allowed credit for any loss in the settlement of his 

accounts. (Section 73, PD No. 1445) 

 

b. Loss property and the related accumulated depreciation and 
impairment loss shall be derecognized in the books upon 

receipt of the Report of Lost, Stolen, Damaged, Destroyed 

Property (RLSDDP) (Appendix 75) supported by a Notice of 

Loss prepared and submitted by the Accountable Officer. The 

loss shall be charged to account “Loss of Assets” at an amount 

equal to its carrying amount. xxx 

 

c. The Accountability of the accountable officer over the loss of 
depreciable asset shall be based on the depreciated replacement 

cost xxx. 

 

d. A receivable account shall be set up to record the 
accountability of the accountable officer simultaneous with 

derecognition of the lost PPE. 

 

It was noted that a lost MacBook Air Laptop, sometime in December 2019, 

costing ₱61,668.75 was still included in the Report on Physical Count of PPE 

(RPCPPE) as at December 31, 2020. The said laptop has the property number 

LPTP-12-03-0001 and was issued to an official of CCC under Property 

Acknowledgement Receipt No. 19-03-0010.  The carrying amount of the lost laptop 

is ₱3,083.44 with an accumulated depreciation of ₱58,585.31 at the time of the 

incident. 

 

According to the CAO, the Accountable Officer of the lost laptop had verbally 

notified the CAO, however, no documents were submitted to her.  The Audit Team 

was neither notified, from the CAO revealed that the Accountable Officer was 

informed of the required documents for lost property to be submitted to Accounting 

Office and the COA, however, the same were not submitted for almost a year from 

the time the item was lost, despite the constant follow-up of the Accounting Office. 

 

Due to the non-submission of the Notice of Loss and the request for the relief 

of accountability within the reglementary period as required under Section 41 (a), 

Chapter 10, Volume 1 of the GAM. Hence, the accountability of the Accountable 

Officer should have been established in the books of accounts of the agency.   

 



30 

 

Validation of the list of ICTE disclosed that lost property was still included in 

the PPE account, thus, overstating the ICTE account by the net carrying amount of 

the lost item amounting to ₱3,083.44 and understating the Due from Officers and 

Employees by the same amount. 

 

d) Misclassification of Communication Equipment account 

 

As defined in the Revised Chart of Accounts in Volume III of the GAM, 

ICTE account is used to recognized the cost incurred in the purchase of information 

and communications technology equipment, which includes hardware (computers, 

printers, scanners and the like) and pre-loaded software such as but not limited to 

operating systems which are included in the cost of the computer hardware. This 

also includes data communications equipment and such other peripherals and 

auxiliary equipment necessary to put the system into operational mode.  

 

In the verification of the Communication Equipment with a total cost of 

₱930,136.92, and carrying amount of ₱208,506.30, it was noted that these items 

should be classified as ICTE instead. Said equipment includes hardware for 

firewall, networking, internet protocol telephony, proximity card reader, 

uninterruptible power supply, etc., details as follows:

Total 930,136.92 721,630.62 208,506.30 

 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a) instruct the Property Unit to: 
 

(i) obtain approval from the head of agency on the transfer of 
properties and submit the original copies of PTR for transferred 

properties completely, as to form and substance; and 

 

(ii) submit the documents for the transferred PPE to the Accounting 
Unit, for its derecognition in the books. 

 

b) require the CAO to: 
 

(i) be aware of the pertinent rules and regulations on the transfer or 
donation of PPE; and    

 



31 

 

(ii) notify the Accountable Officer of her accountability regarding the 
lost laptop. 

  

c) instruct the Chief Accountant to prepare adjusting entries, when 
necessary. 

 

 

B. Compliance Audit  
 

Validity and regularity of Consultancy Services not ascertained 
 

2. Deficiencies were noted in the procurement of six consultancy services, such as        
a) non compliance with the mode of procurement as indicated in the APP and  

absence of approval by the HOPE on the use of alternative mode; b) three 

contracts lacking in provisions on expected deliverables, time frame, coverage, 

effectivity date, and penalties in case of breach of contract; and c) one contract 

of which payment of ₱411,710.50 was made for undelivered services.  

 

a) Non-conformity with the APP’s mode of procurement; alternative mode not 
approved by the HOPE 

 

Section 48.3 of RA No. 9184. The method of procurement to be used shall be 

as indicated in the approved APP. If the original method of procurement 

recommended in the APP was competitive bidding but cannot be ultimately 

pursued, the BAC, through a resolution, shall justify and recommend the change in 

the method of procurement to be approved by the HOPE. Such changes must be 

reflected in the APP to be submitted to the Government Procurement Policy Board 

(GPPB), pursuant to Section 7.4 of this IRR. 

 

The account balance of the Consultancy Services as at December 31, 2020 

amounted to ₱5,706,066.85, of which six consultancy contracts with a total cost of 

₱1,995,000.00, was verified by the audit team. Our verification disclosed that these 

six consultancy contracts, originally under competitive bidding in the APP, were 

procured through alternative mode of procurement despite the lack of BAC 

resolution and approval of HOPE for the change of mode of procurement, in 

violation of Section 48.3 of the Revised IRR of RA No. 9184. The details are as

The BAC Secretariat disclosed that they are not aware on the need of approval 

from the HOPE for the change of mode of procurement. They admitted that it has 

been their practice to proceed with the procurement or engagement of consultants 

upon recommendation of the BAC on the use of alternative method of procurement. 

 

The non-adherence of the CCC to the provisions of the Revised IRR of RA 

No. 9184 is contrary to the commitment of the government to promote good 

governance and effort to adhere to the principles of transparency, accountability, 

equity, efficiency, and economy in the procurement process. Section 2 of the 

Revised IRR, states that, it is the policy of the government that procurement of 

Goods, Infrastructure Projects and Consulting Services shall be competitive and 

transparent, and therefore shall undergo competitive bidding. 

 

b) contracts lacking in provisions on deliverables, timeline, effectivity date of 
contract, and penalties in case of breach of contract 

 

Out of the six contracts that were verified by the Audit Team, three 

consultants with contract deficiencies, as follows:

Penalties 

From To 

2020-011 Not indicated Not indicated None None None

2020-013 Not indicated Not indicated None None None 

2020-020 September 16, 2020 Not indicated None None None 

 

It was noted that the expected deliverables or outputs of the first two 

consultants are not specified both on their first and renewed contracts. 

 



33 

 

Further, we likewise noted that the contracts of the three consultants lacked 

provisions on time frame/period coverage/timeliness/milestones and working 

procedures, and statement of penalties in cased of breach of contract. These 

provisions should have been included in the contracts to effectively evaluate their 

performance and delivery of outputs; hence, enforced penal clause should breach of 

contract occurs. 

 

The absence of such in the contract or the Terms of Reference vis-à-vis the 

deliverables or expected outputs, time frame, commencement of contract and 

stipulation of penalties in case of breach of contract is disadvantageous to the CCC 

in case of delayed/non-submission of the deliverables/outputs within the agreed 

timeframe. 

 

c) Payment of ₱411,710.50 for undelivered services 
 

Section 4.6 of PD No. 1445 provides that claims against government funds 

shall be supported with complete documentation. 

 

Item 9.12 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 provides for the 

additional documentary requirements on consulting services, which includes among 

others, the approved consultancy progress/final reports, and/or output required 

under the contract.  

 

CCC engaged into a consultancy service of a consultant for six months and 

renewed for another three months and 15 days. The contract stipulated that payment 

of ₱70,000 shall be made every month provided that she submits to the Human 

Resources a monthly accomplishment report and updates on the required outputs.  

 

The scope of work and TOR indicated that the consultant shall develop the 

following: 

 

a. The Foreign-Assisted Project (FAPs) Protocols Manual 
b. The scorecard to be used for all climate change foreign-assisted projects 
c. The Project Management Unit (PMU) Guidelines 
d. PMU Personnel Performance Metrics 
e. Project Assessment and Recommendation Reports/Memo 
f. Proposal Reviews Selection Criteria and Process report/Memo 
g. FAPs Database: Fact Sheet Version, Matrix Version  
h. Coordination Reports/Memo 

 

Evaluation of the disbursement vouchers (DVs) showed that total payments 

made by CCC to the consultant for the six-month period amounted to ₱411,710.50, 

net of withholding tax. However, verification of the supporting documents attached 

to the DVs revealed that outputs/deliverables, such as the scorecard to be used for 

all climate change foreign-assisted projects, PMU guidelines and PMU personnel 

performance metrics, were incomplete. It was also revealed that payments were 



34 

 

made to the consultant from March 16 to April 15, 2020 despite non-submission of 

any accomplishment report for the said period; thus, propriety and regularity of the 

payment could not be established, in violation of the contract and Section 4.6 of PD 

No. 1445. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the: 

 

a) BAC to strictly adhere to the Revised IRR of RA No. 9184, and on the need 
for BAC Resolution and approval of the HOPE for any changes in the 

mode of procurement; 

 

b) Legal Office to include necessary provisions/stipulations in the contracts of 
expected deliverables/output, timeline of submission, effectivity date/period 

of the contract and penal clause in case of breach of contract, to protect the 

interest of the agency;  

 

c) Chief Accountant to ensure completeness of supporting documents before 
processing payment of services, and  

 

d) The concerned consultants to submit the pending required scope of work as 
stated in the contract to the Accounting Office. 

 

 

Unliquidated fund transfers to LGUs 

 

3. Fund transfers to LGUs totaling ₱516,000.00 as at December 31, 2020 
remained unliquidated for more than three years after the completion of the 

project in CY 2017 due to lack of provisions in the MOA on project 

implementation timelines and non-issuance of demand letter to the LGU 

officials and personnel concerned, contrary to Item 4.6 of COA Circular No. 

94-013 dated December 13, 1994. 
 

COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994 was issued to guide the 

government agencies in the grant, utilization and liquidation of funds transferred to 

implementing agencies (IAs). Item 4.6 thereof states that: 

 

“Within ten days (10) after the end of each month/end of the agreed 

period for the Project, the IA shall submit the Report of Checks 

Issued (RCI) and the Report of Disbursement (RD) to report the 

utilization of the funds.  Only actual project expenses shall be 

reported.  The reports shall be approved by the Head of the IA.” 
 

On February 27, 2014, a MOA was executed by and between the CCC, the 

Provincial Government of Surigao del Norte and the Municipalities of San Benito 

and San Isidro for the implementation of Ecotown-Climate Adaptation Support 

Service (CASS), to serve as an interim assistance to the vulnerable communities in 



35 

 

the form of Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) with the aim of building 

adaptive capacity through economic resiliency. 

The CCC, as agreed in the MOA, shall allocate the amount of ₱510,000.00 in 

favor of the Municipalities, for the pilot implementation of the project to address 

vulnerability to climate change impacts of regions, provinces, cities and 

municipalities through alternative livelihood which is one of the identified 

appropriate adaption measures. Every recipient municipality has determined 100 

households identified as poorest of the poor to receive financial support as target 

beneficiaries of the program. The projects were already completed in CY 2017. 

 

Our audit of the account Due from LGUs revealed that the fund transfers to 

the two municipalities of Surigao del Norte remained unliquidated for more than 

five years. Details as follows: 

 

Name of IA 
Check 

Number 
Check Date 

Balance as at 

December 31, 2020 

(₱) 

Municipality of San Isidro 929284 April 21, 2014 510,000.00 

Municipality of San Benito 929283 April 21, 2014 6,000.00 

Total 516,000.00 

 

Inquiry from the Chief Accountant disclosed that the Accounting Office was 

tasked to monitor the said fund transfers to LGUs. She further informed that in CY 

2018, the former Audit Team and the accounting personnel conduct validation of 

the existence of the projects and required the concerned LGUs to liquidate the fund 

transfers, where they were able to reduce the balance from ₱1,036,000.00 as at 

December 31, 2017 to ₱516,000.00 as at December 31, 2020. However, it was 

noted that after CY 2018, the Accounting Office no longer issue demand letters to 

concerned LGUs and was unable to monitor the same.  

 

Review of the MOAs implementing the CASS revealed deficiencies, such as 

the following: 

 

1) No Time Frame/Period Covered – to determine the effectivity and 
expiration of the implementation of the project. Most importantly, to 

forecast and assure the public of the completion and execution of the 

project as agreed in the MOA; and 

 

2) No Working Procedure and Timelines – to ascertain the transitional stages 
on how the fund should be utilized. 

 

The noted deficiencies of the MOAs, in addition to the non-monitor of the 

status of the fund transfer by the Accounting Office led to its long-delayed 

liquidation; thus, becoming outstanding and non-moving   for three years. 

 



36 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a) instruct the Accounting Office to issue demand letters to the 
concerned LGUs for the liquidation of the fund transfer; and 

 

b) henceforth, require the Legal Officer to include in every MOA, 
entered into by CCC, the necessary stipulations on time frame/period 

covered and timelines for project implementation/working procedure. 
 

Unenforced provisions of contract/agreement  
 

4. The provisions of the contracts/agreements by and between CCC and private 
entities on the refund of security/consumption deposits totaling ₱298,110.36 as 

at December 31, 2020 were not enforced, despite the expiration/termination of 

the lease term/contract agreements, resulting in uncollected security/ 

consumption deposits. 

 

Chapter 3, Revised Chart of Accounts, Volume III of GAM defines Guaranty 

Deposits as the account which is used to recognize amount deposited for goods such 

as deposit for containers and deposits made to guarantee compliance with the terms 

of an agreement. 

 

For CY 2020, the Audit Team conducted review of the contracts made by 

CCC, as the lessee, and the private entities, as lessors, for the lease of office space, 

and the use of power services. 

 

The contract of lease provides, among others, that the CCC shall deposit with 

the lessor an agreed amount as security for the faithful performance of each and 

every terms, provisions, covenants, and conditions of the contract. The deposit shall 

not constitute or substitute payment of rent. It also provides that the Lessor shall not 

be required to keep the security deposits from its general fund and the Lessee shall 

not be entitled to interest of such deposit, which shall remain intact during the entire 

term of the lease and shall not be applied as payment for any monetary obligations 

of the Lessee under the signed contract. 

 

Further, if the Lessee should fully comply and faithfully perform every 

provisions of the lease, the security deposit shall be refunded to the Lessee after the 

expiration of the lease agreement, or upon the satisfaction of all obligations to the 

Lessor. 

 

Likewise, under the executed power service agreement, the CCC shall pay a 

consumption deposit in an agreed amount, which shall be refunded upon 

termination of the agreement, without interest, less any amount due to the entity. 

 



37 

 

Our evaluation of the contracts/agreements revealed that six lease

Inquiry disclosed that the CAO’s office had already coordinated with the 

lessors on the refund of security deposits. 

 

It is expected that since the contracts/agreements had already 

expired/terminated, the agency should already have requested the lessors to refund 

the guaranty deposits. However, as of date, said guaranty deposits remained 

uncollected for more than one year due to the failure of the CCC to demand full 

settlements.     

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the CAO to 

enforce the provision of the contract/agreement, and demand the refund of the 

security/consumption deposits of terminated/expired contracts/agreements. 

 

 

Accumulation of receivables from PS-DBM 

 

5. The year-end account balance of Due from NGAs (PS-DBM) representing 
undelivered common-used office supplies of ₱96,812.40 and ₱187,295.34 for 

the prior year and current year, respectively, accumulated to ₱284,107.74 due 



38 

 

to the failure of the agency to reapply it on subsequent procurement or request 

for its refund; hence, might become idle in the hands of PS-DBM. 

 

Section 2 of PD No. 1445 provides the declared policy of the state that all 

resources of the government shall be managed, expended or utilized in accordance 

with law and regulations, and safeguard against loss or wastage through illegal or 

improper disposition, with a view to ensuring efficiency, economy and 

effectiveness in the operations of government. 

 

Section 4 of Executive Order (EO) No. 285 dated July 25, 1987 states that the 

function of the Supply Coordination Office is transferred to the PS-DBM whose 

function is to operate a government-wide procurement for common-use office 

supplies and monitoring of process for common-use supplies, materials and 

equipment.  While Section 5 of EO No. 40 dated October 8, 2001 requires all 

agencies to procure common-use supplies, materials and equipment from PS- DBM. 

 

During CY 2019 and prior years, the CCC made advances to PS-DBM for the 

purchase of common-use office supplies totaling ₱4,744,099.06 and delivery of the 

same amounted to ₱4,653,466.37, leaving an outstanding receivables of 

₱96,812.40. Moreover, for the current year, CCC again transferred funds amounting 

to ₱325,919.67, however, only ₱138,624.33 worth of supplies was delivered.  The 

balance accumulated in the books due to unavailability of the office supplies at the 

time of requests, with the following details:

Note: Negative balances are the result of deliveries from prior years which were

Subsequently, Item b.4 on the General Policies and Guidelines with the PS-

Philippine Government Electronic Procurement System (PhilGEPS) Depot 

Operations Manual states that depots are allowed to refund the excess deposits 



39 

 

provided that the following are presented: (a) photocopy of the Agency 

Procurement Request (APR) showing the list of items to be purchased; (b) 

photocopy of the Delivery Receipt (DR) issued by the Depot; and (c) photocopy of 

the Official Receipt (OR) issued to the agency. 

 

However, the Chief Accountant explained that the outstanding advances were 

not refunded or reapplied on subsequent procurement to PS-DBM due to the 

issuance of Memorandum No. 2009-0438 dated October 5, 2020 from the PS-Legal 

Division on the legal basis for the reversion to BTr of all expired allotments of 

agencies in the PS.  

 

The said memorandum includes, among others, the recently issued EO No. 87 

dated August 13, 2019, which provides that all documented accounts payable for 

fiscal year 2016 and years prior thereto shall be reverted to the Accumulated 

Surplus or Deficit of the General Fund, or the Cumulative Results of Operations of 

the National Government. Henceforth, all documented accounts payable which 

remain outstanding for at least two years, for which no actual administrative or 

judicial claim has been filed, shall be subject to automatic reversion. 

 

The Audit Team does not concur with the Chief Accountant’s interpretation of 

the Memorandum. The fund transfers to PS-DBM are recognized as receivables of 

Source Agency (SA) for the delivery of common-use office supplies. They are not 

considered as expired allotment considering that the purpose of the fund transfers 

was for the purchase of goods, which PS DBM has not yet fully delivered. EO No. 

87 as legal basis for the reversion of the fund transfer is not applicable. 

 

Under Section 3.4(d) and 3.5(c) COA Circular No. 2015-01 dated January 29, 

2015 on the rules and regulations in the reversion to the general fund of all dormant 

cash, unauthorized accounts, unnecessary special and trust funds and related 

accounts, provides that in case of inter-agency fund transfer, the concerned agency 

officials shall confirm from the SA the existing balance per books while the  

implementing agency shall coordinate with the SA of the reverted funds to close the 

related dormant accounts in the SA’s books of account. 

 

To verify whether PS-DBM already reverted the balance of the account Due 

from NGAs (PS-DBM), the Audit Team confirmed the balance per books with PS-

DBM, however, no reply was received, as of date.   

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief 

Accountant to: 

 

a) make representation to PS-DBM for the refund of the outstanding 
advances pertaining to undelivered items for CYs 2019 and prior years, to 

avoid accumulation and dormancy of receivables that might become idle; 

and 

 



40 

 

b) request the proof of reversion, and record the same in the books if already 
reverted by the PS-DBM to the National Treasury. 

 

 

Unserviceable and idle PPE not yet dropped from the PPE accounts 
 

6. Various unserviceable and idle PPE with a total cost of ₱237,672.35 and 
carrying amount of ₱24,550.29 were not yet dropped from the PPE accounts, 

as the IIRUP was not yet signed and remained unsubmitted to the Accounting 

Unit. 

 

Section 40, Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM provides that PPE is said to be 

unserviceable if it is no longer capable of providing the entity with future economic 

benefits or service potential.  It also provides that all unserviceable PPE shall be 

reported in the IIRUP, and which shall be dropped from the books by debiting 

Impairment Loss-PPE less Accumulated Depreciation. 

 

In addition, Section 79 of PD No. 1445 provides that when a government 

property has become unserviceable for any cause, or is no longer needed, it may be 

destroyed or sold at public auction to the highest bidder. 

 

Further, the Manual on Disposal of Government Property as embodied in NBC 

No. 425 dated January 28, 1992 was issued to guide agencies in their disposal 

undertakings. Part I (A) thereof provides, among others, that disposal occurs when a 

piece of equipment or property can no longer provide efficient service or, though still 

working, has been rendered useless due to obsolescence.  Disposal proceedings 

should be immediately initiated to avoid further deterioration of the property and the 

consequent depreciation in its value. A systematic and timely disposal will yield 

benefits in terms of a higher appraised value/selling price and enabling storage areas 

available for other purposes. 

 

Verification of properties in the RPCPPE showed the following details of idle 

and unserviceable PPEs:

The Audit Team learned that the Property Unit already prepared an IIRUP, 

however, the same was not yet signed and not submitted to the Accounting Unit; 

thus, these unserviceable properties have not been dropped from the books, contrary 

to Sections 40 (d), Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM, casting doubt on the fair 

presentation of the PPE in the financial statements. 

 

It would have been beneficial for CCC had it immediately disposed these 

unserviceable PPE; thus, would have avoided further deterioration of the property 

and the consequent depreciation in its value. A systematic and timely disposal will 

yield benefits in terms of a higher appraised value and enabling storage areas 

available for other purposes.   

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Property Unit 

to: 

 

a) complete the IIRUP, and submit the same to the Accounting Unit to serve 
as basis for dropping from the books; and 

 

b) facilitate the disposal of the idle and unserviceable PPE. 
 

 

Non-establishment of Internal Audit Service/Unit 
 

7. The agency failed to establish an Internal Audit Service/Unit (IAS/U) as 
required under PD No. 1445, Administrative Order (AO) No. 70 s. 2003 and 

DBM Budget Circular Letter No. 2004-4 due to the disapproval of the DBM on 

their request for plantilla position. 

 

Sections 123 and 124 of PD No. 1445 provides that internal control is the plan 

of the organization and all the coordinate methods and measures adopted within an 

organization or agency to safeguard its assets, check the accuracy and reliability of 

its accounting data, and encourage adherence to prescribed managerial policies. It is 

the direct responsibility of the agency head to install, implement, and monitor a 

sound system of internal control. 

 

On April 14, 2003, AO No. 70 was issued mandating all heads of government 

agencies, GOCCS, including government financial institutions (GFIs), state 

universities and colleges (SUCs) and LGUs to immediately organize an IAS in their 



42 

 

respective offices. The IAS shall be an integral part of the office and shall assist in 

the management and effective discharge of the responsibilities of the office, without 

intruding into the authority and mandate of the COA granted under the constitution. 

 

Further, Budget Circular No. 2004-4 dated March 22, 2004 was issued as 

guidelines on the reorganization and staffing of IAS/U. Item 4.1.3 thereof, and 

provides that a government entity may organize and staff its IAUS/U as follows: 

 

Government Entity Organizational Structure and Head of the IAS/U 

Department level entity The IAU in a department shall be an Internal Audit 

Service. For department level entities, the internal 

audit organization shall depend on the subdivision 

of the entity’s support staff units. The IAS/U head 

shall be classified same as those of the heads of the 

entity’s support staff units. The IAS/U shall have up 

to two divisions on operations audit and financial 

audit. Each division shall be headed by an Internal 

Auditor V, SG-24. 

Intermediate level entity 

(higher than a bureau but 

lower than a department) 

such as councils, 

commissions and boards 

whose operation cut across 

several offices or even 

departments. 

The IAS/U may be a branch, department or office, 

depending on the subdivision of the entity’s support 

staff units. Its head shall be classified same as those 

of the heads of the entity’s support staff units. The 

IAS/U shall have two divisions on operations audit 

and financial audit. Each division shall be headed 

by an Internal Auditor V, SG-24. 

Bureau level entity The IAS/U shall be an Internal Audit Division to be 

headed by an Internal Auditor V, SG-24. 

 

Our audit on the financial reports and operations of CCC disclosed that 

Management was not able to establish an IAS/U as required by PD No. 1445, AO, 

DBM and COA circulars and other issuances pertaining thereto. 

 

Inquiry from the OIC-Chief Accountant revealed that plantilla position for 

IAS/U was previously requested by Management however, it was subsequently 

disapproved by DBM during the round table discussion due to the size of the 

agency, limited budget and manpower capacity. 

 

The IAS/U is instrumental for the Management to implement and monitor a 

sound system of internal control. Its importance was recognized and 

institutionalized by the state through legislation (Republic Act and PD) and 

issuances of various rules and regulations. Its non-creation could weaken a well-

placed internal control system of the agency. 

 



43 

 

We recommended and  Management agreed to reiterate its request and 

judiciously explain to DBM the need for a plantilla position for internal 

auditor to be able to establish its IAU/IAS in accordance with PD No. 1445, AO 

No. 70 and DBM Budget Circular Letter No. 2004-4.

Programs for Senior-Citizens (SCs) and Persons with Disability (PWDs) 
 

9. Although Management had no plans, programs and projects to address the 
SCs and PWDs for nine consecutive years from CY 2012 to 2020, contrary to 

Section 32 of the General Provisions (GP) of RA No. 11465 or the General 

Appropriations Act (GAA) for FY 2020, they have hired the services of senior 

citizens for a total cost of   ₱1,432,356.00. 
 

Section 32 of the GP of RA No. 11465 or the GAA for FY 2020 provides that 

all agencies of the government shall formulate plans, programs and projects 

intended to address the concerns of SCs and PWDs, insofar as it relates to their 

mandated functions, and integrate the same in their regular activities. 

 

Further, all government infrastructure and facilities shall provide architectural 

features, designs or facilities that will reasonably enhance mobility, safety and 

welfare of PWDs. pursuant to Batas Pambansa Blg. 344 and RA No. 7277, as 

amended. 

 

The audit team verbally requested documents akin to the plans of the agency 

to address the concerns of SCs and PWDs for CY 2020 and noted that the agency 

did not formulate any plans, programs and projects for the period. Management, 

however, hired the services of senior citizens with a total cost of ₱1,432,356.00 for 

the year. 

 

We learned that an Office Order was issued in September 2019 for the 

creation of the focal team for the formulation of plans, programs and projects 

related to SCs and PWDs. However, per inquiry to one of the focal teams, we were 



46 

 

informed that they were not able to formulate plans for CY 2020 due to the threat of 

COVID-19 and limitations brought by the pandemic. 

 

The non-formulation of plans, programs and projects to the address the 

concerns of SCs and PWDs was continuously brought by the audit team to the 

attention of Management for nine consecutive years from CY 2012 to 2020. 

 

We reiterate our recommendation that Management instruct the focal 

team to earnestly formulate plans, programs and projects intended to address 

the concerns of SCs and PWDs, insofar as it relates to the agency’s mandated 

functions; and integrate the same in its regular activities, pursuant to Section 

32 of the GP of RA No. 11465. 

  

 

Covid Related Expenses 
 

10. The Management was able to respond and implement procedures to the threat 
of the COVID-19 global pandemic during CY 2020, in compliance with Section 

36 of the GP of RA No. 11465 or the GAA for FY 2020.  

 

The following activities were conducted by the agency as a response to the 

threat of COVID-19 pandemic that wreaked havoc and claimed thousands of lives 

of not only in the Philippines but in the whole world, during CY 2020, and to 

mitigate the transmission thereof:

16.  The agency’s PPE, except for the six motor vehicles, with a total acquisition 

cost of ₱13,994,911.71 as at December 31, 2020 remained to be uninsured for 

four consecutive years with the General Insurance Fund (GIF) of the GSIS 

due to the delay in the preparation of Property Inventory Form as required 

under RA No. 656 and COA Circular No. 2018-002 dated May 31, 2018; thus, 

posing risks of non-indemnification of insurable assets in case of loss or 

damages. 

 

Section 5 of RA No. 656 provides that every government, except a municipal 

government below first class, is hereby required to insure its properties, with the 

fund against any insurable risk herein provided and pay the premiums thereon. 

 

Likewise, COA Circular No. 2018-002 dated May 31, 2018 is issued to assist 

the implementation of the provisions of RA No. 656, as amended on the insurance 

and bonding risks on insurable government assets and properties with GIF. It is also 

prescribed that all of the Heads of the government agencies shall direct the 

pertinent official under his/her supervision to prepare the Property Inventory Form 

(PIF) listing of all the insurable properties and other assets and submit the 

consolidated PIF to the Supervising Auditor/Audit Team Leader and the GIF, 

GSIS, not later than April 30 of each year.

CY 2020 were only finalized in February 2020 and application for its insurance was 

not pursued due to restrictions brought by the pandemic.   

 

Further, we learned that the agency applied for insurance with GSIS only on 

December 2020 after updating and finalizing the RPCPPE for CY 2020. However, 

it was recommended by the latter that application for insurance of PPEs be made 

early part the following year in order to maximize the coverage period over the cost 

of premium. 

  

Failure to secure insurance coverage exposes government properties to risk of 

non-indemnifiable loss/damage in case of destruction, damage to or loss of 

properties through fire, flood, theft and other fortuitous event. 

 

This observation was previously reiterated in the annual audit reports for CYs 

2017 to 2019. 

 

We reiterate our prior years’ recommendation that Management should 

require the CAO to immediately secure insurance coverage from GIF of the 

GSIS for all the insurable properties of CCC to ensure recovery of cost in case 

of loss or damage.
