OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

 

A. Financial and Compliance Audit 
 

Delayed submission of financial reports 

 

1. Submission to the Auditor of financial statements (FS), the Reports of 
Disbursements (RD) and supporting documents was delayed by 10 to 249 days 

from the deadline set forth under Section 60(c), Chapter 19, Volume I of the 

Government Accounting Manual (GAM), precluding the timely analysis of 

accounts and audit of transactions for CY 2020. 

 

Section 60(c), Chapter 19, Volume I of the GAM provides that all NGAs 

shall prepare and submit the FS and schedules within the following prescribed 

deadline:

Further, Section 7.2.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 

2009 states that the Chief Accountant, Bookkeeper or other authorized official 

performing accounting and/or bookkeeping functions of the audited agency shall 

ensure that the reports and supporting documents submitted by the accountable 

officers are immediately recorded in the books of accounts and submitted to the 

Auditor within the first ten (10) days of the ensuing month. 

 

The Audit Team recorded the date of receipt of the monthly supporting 

schedules/reports and disbursement vouchers (DV), Journal Entry Vouchers (JEV)

Yearend FS 02/14/2021 April 22, 2021 62 

 

The monthly submission of the DVs, JEVs and ORs were delayed by 10 to 

249 days, while the year-end FS and notes to FS were submitted on April 22, 2021, 

a 62-day delay, contrary to the prescribed deadline of February 14.  

 

It is noted that the timely submission of financial reports and other 

supporting schedules was disrupted due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 

pandemic, which started in March 2020. In the previous years, CFO religiously 

submitted the required reports and supporting documents to the Audit Team. 

However, due to the enforcement of complete or partial lockdowns from mid-

March 2020 up to the end of the same year, CFO adopted the alternative work 

arrangement (AWA) that critically impacted on the efficiency of compiling and 

completing all the necessary supporting documents of the DVs and JEVs before 

forwarding them to the Audit Team.    

 

Hence, the considerable delay in the submission of monthly DVs and JEVs 

precluded the timely analysis and audit of accounts and transactions, and the 

detection of deficiencies and errors, if any. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Director of 

Administrative and Finance Division (AFD) to judiciously plan the Alternative 

Working Arrangement (AWA) of his staff so as not to compromise the timely 

submission of financial reports, in compliance with Section 60(c), Chapter 19, 

Volume I of the GAM and Section 7.2.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-006. 

 

 

Issuance of checks as direct payment instead of ADA 

 

2. Checks totaling ₱42,373,943.38 were issued as direct payment to creditors 
instead of Authority to Debit Account (ADA), contrary to Department of 

Budget and Management (DBM) Circular Letter No. 2018-14 dated December 

28, 2018 impeding uniform payment system across governments.  

 

DBM Circular Letter No. 2018-14 directs all NGAs to pay suppliers, 

creditors, and payees using ADA. Updated general guidelines on the Modified 

Direct Payment Scheme (MDPS) provides that NGAs shall use the existing List of 

Due and Demandable Accounts Payable (LDDAP)-ADA and Summary of 

LDDAP-ADA Issued and Invalidated ADA Entries (SLIIE) to settle all payables to 

creditors, including utility companies and social insurance corporations except 

GSIS until such time that GSIS is equipped to accept direct payment scheme. 

 

 



46 

 

Section 3.4 of the Circular Letter further clarified the procedures for 

payment of obligations to small creditors and those creditors that cannot be 

conveniently nor practicably paid, as determined by the Agency Head, using ADA 

as exemption. It states that said creditors may continue to be paid through issuance 

of MDS checks or cash, to wit:  

 

1) Small value creditors/payees with claims during the year costing ₱10,000 
and below, e.g., government scholars, recipients of DOLE's Special 

Program for the Employment of Students (SPES); 

  

2) Creditor/payee of the agency with non-regular transaction or one-time 
transaction during the year, e.g., Right-of-Way claimants, relocation 

expenses for informal settlers and others; and 

 

3) Companies which are not authorized, per their internal policy, to open 
current accounts in addition to their existing accounts. 

 

For the period ending December 31, 2020, CFO, instead of ADA, released 

386 checks totaling ₱42,373,943.38 as payments for the expenses related to the 

implementation of its normal operations and various projects, as follows:

These payments, utility expenses of its office i.e. space rent, electricity, 

water, fuel, cable subscription and internet, professional fees its legal consultant, 

GSIS remittances, were inconsistent with the exemptions to using ADA as provided 

under Section 3.4 of the DBM Circular Letter No. 2018-14. 

 

Moreover, other payments were claims above the ₱10,000.00 exemption 

ceiling, and creditors are not a one-time transaction payees. Further, the two 

checking accounts where the checks were drawn were not even MDS accounts. 

 

The Management explained that various creditors do not have existing bank 

accounts with any Government Servicing Banks (GSB). Though these suppliers can 

opt to accept payments thru bank transfer, they will have to shoulder the transfer 

fee. To avoid this, CFO pays its suppliers through check.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Director of 

AFD to comply with the provisions of DBM Circular Letter No. 2018-14 dated 

December 28, 2018 to implement checkless transactions and conform with the 

uniform payment system across governments. 

 

 

Unremitted balance of Cash in Bank, LCCA to BTr 

 

3. The Agency did not remit to the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) the year-end 
balance of the account Cash in Bank, Local Currency Current Account 

(LCCA) aggregating ₱5,445,927.36, contrary to Section 6 of the General 

Provisions (GP) of RA No. 11465 or the GAA for FY 2020 and Section 2 of 

Executive Order (EO) No. 338, depriving the government of funds that could 

have been used for other necessary projects. 

 

Donations with a term not exceeding one year shall be treated as trust 

receipts in accordance with Section 6 - Trust Receipts of the GP of the GAA for 

FY 2020, which states that receipts collected by departments, bureaus, offices and 

instrumentalities of the National Government from non-tax sources, or as a 

guaranty from fulfilment of an obligation, or from donations authorized by law or 

contract with a term not exceeding one year; and those classified by law or 

regulations as trust receipts, shall be deposited with the National Treasury and 

recorded as trust receipts in accordance with EO No. 338, s. 1996. 

 

Section 2 of EO No. 338 provides that: 

 

All existing balances of trust receipts deposited with authorized 

government depository banks or any forthcoming trust receipt 

which are intended to be deposited with authorized government 

depository banks are hereby required to be deposited with the 

National Treasury.

Verification disclosed that the balance of the account Cash in Bank-LCCA 

aggregating ₱5,445,927.36 remained unremitted to the BTr as at December 31, 

2020, depriving the government of funds that could be used for other necessary 

projects. 

 

The ₱5,445,927.36 consists mostly of collections received from various 

CFO projects and trust fund from other agencies and institutions, as detailed below:

Receipts from cash donations and trust fund from other agencies and 

institutions shall be deposited with the National Treasury and recorded as a special 

account in the General Fund and shall be available to the implementing agency 

concerned through a Special Budget, pursuant to Section 53, Chapter 5, Book VI 

of EO No. 292. The cash value of the donations shall be deemed automatically 

appropriated for the purpose specified by the donor. 

Management’s reluctance to remit the above funds to the BTr was the 

possibility that said funds might be categorized as General Fund; thus, it will no 

longer be available to the CFO. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Director of 

AFD to: 

 

a) remit the ₱5,445,927.36 to the BTr, in accordance with Section 6 of the GP 
of the GAA for FY 2020 and Section 2 of EO No. 338; and 

 

b) identify and monitor which funds are to be recorded as a special account 
in the General Fund to be available when needed through a Special Budget, 

pursuant to Section 53, Chapter 5, Book VI of EO No. 292. 

 

 

Deficiencies in the implementation of the Exchange Visitor Program (EVP) 

 

4. Several operational procedures in the implementation of the Exchange Visitor 
Program (EVP) laid down in the EVP Resolution No. 01-2016 were not 

complied with due to weak internal controls on the bill and collection of 

processing fee and scholarship assistance, such as (a) inconsistencies in 

accounting the receipt of processing fees; (b) releases of No Objection 

Statement (NOS) or waiver without proper supporting documents; and (c) 

absence of monitoring and evaluation report. 

 

EVP is an international exchange program administered by the United 

States of America (USA) to implement the Mutual Education and Cultural 

Exchange Act of 1961, as amended. It provides Filipinos with opportunities to 

participate in educational and cultural programs in the US and return home to share 

their acquired skills and knowledge. It is not an immigration program and, in many 

cases, requires participants to comply with a two-year home-country residency 

requirement after completing the program.  

 

Pursuant to Section 212(a) of the US Immigration and Nationality Act, EVP 

participants are required to reside in the country of their nationality or last legal 

permanent residence for an aggregate period of at least two years after completion 

of their respective programs before becoming eligible to apply for an immigrant 

visa or for non-immigrant visa.  

 



50 

 

The provision in Section 212(a) is applicable to the following exchange 

visitors: 

 

1) those whose training were financed in whole or in part, directly or 
indirectly, by an agency of the US Government or by the Philippine 

Government; 

2) those whose training fields are included in the skills list of the Philippines; 
and 

3) those who came to the US in order to acquire graduate medical education 
or training. 

 

An EVP participant can continue to stay in the USA if the participant is 

granted a change of status. The change of status always considers the two-year 

home-country residence requirement and will require its formal waiver.  An 

application for a waiver at the US Department of State may be approved on various 

circumstances including a No Objection Statement (NOS) that must be obtained 

from the government of the home-country of the participant. 

 

NOS is a formal indication from the Philippine Government that it poses no 

objection to the continued stay of the EVP participant in the USA, or to the waiver 

of the two-year home-country residency requirement.  

 

Section 2 of AO No. 242 states that the EVP Committee can collect such 

administrative fees and charges as may be necessary, just and reasonable to cover 

the full cost of services rendered consistent with the terms of EO No. 159 dated 

February 04, 1994 and Department of Finance-Department of Budget and 

Management Joint Circular (DOF-DBM JC) No. 02-94 dated November 14, 1994, 

and Section 3 tasked the Philippine EVP Committee, as its Secretariat, to provide 

support and assistance in coordinating with appropriate public and private sector 

representatives on matters pertinent to the program. 

 

Section 6.1 - Interim Rules and Regulations Implementing AO No. 242 

provides that EVP Committee Secretariat shall develop and maintain an 

information system that contains relevant information about the participants, which 

will be necessary in developing policy initiatives and programs concerning transfer 

of skills and knowledge to the Philippines. 

   

Section 6.d of EVP Resolution No. 01-2016 dated June 20, 2016 authorizes 

CFO to collect $125.00 processing and handling fee for NOS applications, subject 

to the standard accounting and auditing procedures. CFO shall also submit to the 

EVP Committee a quarterly financial report of all payments received from NOS 

applicants, and its utilization. 

 

CFO evaluates all applications and requests for NOS, including 

completeness of requirements, to determine which applications are eligible for 

waiver, which then are forwarded to the EVP Committee for consideration. If the 



51 

 

reasons of the applicant do not fall within the criteria set for the granting of NOS 

but there’s a valid and reasonable justification for the request, the EVP Committee 

may offer alternative arrangement in lieu of the two-year home residency 

requirement. 

 

An Alternative Arrangement is a skills-transfer or training and skills 

enhancement project proposed by an EVP participant and approved by the EVP 

Committee. It is implemented to ensure that the objective of the program is not 

compromised by the decision of the participant to continue to stay in the USA. It 

requires the applicant to individually and personally undertake a project involving 

two components:  

 

1) developing and implementing a transfer of technology project; and 
2) sponsorship in the amount of $1,500.00 Enhanced Training Sponsorship 

Project (ETSP) for the enhancement training of an identified beneficiary in 

his/her particular field of expertise. 

 

a) inconsistencies in accounting the receipt of processing fees 
 

All NOS applicants pay the non-refundable processing fee of US$125.00 

exclusive of bank charges through fund transfer to the LBP account of CFO. The 

table below presents the collection of processing fee from CY 2016 to 2019:

The number of endorsements and pending applicants was lifted from the 

monitoring report of the Secretariat while the processing fee collections were based 

on the LBP bank statements. As of audit date, no financial data is available for CY 

2020 since LBP has not yet issued bank statements for the year.  

 

Based on the monitoring report, there were a total of 320 J1 visa holders 

who pursued acquiring NOS from CY 2016 to 2019. To arrive with the peso 

equivalent of the collection of $125.00, the Audit Team used the weighted average 
peso per US dollar rate published by the BSP. Details of computation are presented 

on the next page:

Total 320  2,054,227.09 2,754,633.01 700,405.92 

 

The recomputed processing fees resulted in a total of ₱2,054,227.09, which 

is ₱700,405.92 less than the actual collections of ₱2,754,633.01. The discrepancy 

is due to the absence of internal controls on the bill and collection for EVP 

processing fee. 

 

Over the years, the AFD recognized the collections of processing fee based 

solely on the bank statement from LBP without other corroborating evidences to 

support the payment details especially the name of the payor, where the Secretariat 

could have provided had they been implementing controls over their internal 

processes. 

  

b) releases of NOS or waiver without proper supporting documents 
 

Although the EVP Secretariat claimed acknowledgement on the receipt of 

documentary requirements for NOS application through email, no 

acknowledgement receipt was issued specifically for the payment of the $125.00 

processing fee. The Secretariat also did not keep track on how many payments it 

receives.  

 

All NOS applicants, through alternative arrangement, are required to 

individually and personally undertake a project involving two components: a) 

developing and implementing a transfer of technology project; and b) sponsorship 

in the amount of $1,500.00 ETSP for the enhancement training of an identified 

beneficiary in his/her particular field of expertise. 

 

In the past five years, CY 2016 through CY 2020, the Secretariat endorsed 

nine waivers through alternative arrangement while AFD recorded 10 collections 

of ETSP. The Audit Team obtained the amounts under the column ETSP per Books 

from the bank reconciliation statements (BRS) and compared the data with the 

proof of payment provided by EVP Secretariat. The details and peso equivalent of 

$1,500.00 collections are presented on the following page:

Note: Variance was computed only for transactions with proof of payment. 
 

For the year 2017, the Secretariat processed and endorsed waivers through 

alternative arrangement to three applicants while AFD recorded only two 

collections of ETSP. Both the Secretariat and AFD did not present any proof or 

records showing the receipt of payment. There was also a discrepancy of ₱2,870.50 

between the proof of payment and the recorded collection per AFD books. 

 

For the year 2018, the Secretariat likewise processed and endorsed waivers 

to four applicants. However, review of the bank statements for the year 2018 

revealed that AFD recorded two sponsorships in its LBP account while another 

three was collected in the DBP bank account. The details of the ETSP sponsorship 

of ₱79,570.80 is yet to be identified by the Secretariat and AFD, and for the years 

2019 and 2020, only one NOS applicant each year was endorsed.  

 

Out of the nine waivers that Secretariat endorsed, only one applicant was 

presented with complete set of supporting documents, including proof of payment.  



54 

 

Accurate data and number of applicants received by EVP Committee could 

have been attained had the Secretariat issued a unique reference number for each 

applicant. This reference number may even be used to determine status (successful, 

lacked documents, for abandonment, for disapproval) of the applicant. Thus, the 

lack of internal controls on such collections/receipts   

 

c) absence of monitoring and evaluation report 
 

The EVP participant transfers $1,500.00, or its peso equivalent, to the EVP 

Committee through CFO LBP trust account after the approval of the project 

proposal, and the EVP Committee identifies a qualified beneficiary who will 

receive the sponsorship.  

 

The identification of a qualified beneficiary was not yet disclosed by the 

Secretariat as of audit date despite previous requests by the Audit Team. Per 

inquiry, there are guidelines on the selection process of the beneficiaries, however, 

a copy of the guidelines is yet to submitted as of audit date. It was also noted that 

the donor of ETSP sponsorship is not included as a party to the MOA per Section 

16.II.d of EVP Resolution No. 01-2016. 

 

In practice, instead of MOA, a Deed of Donation (DOD) is entered into by 

and between the CFO and the donor, contrary to the provisions of Section 16.II.d.  

The DOD simply states that the donor is donating $1,500.00 to CFO, and that the 

donation is intended for the scholarship assistance of a student beneficiary for a 

given semester. No other conditions are imposed on the beneficiary and 

commitment of CFO is not indicated, and the beneficiary is not yet identified. 

 

Review of the documents revealed that the obligations of the participant did 

not fully describe the Activity, Specific Milestones and Expected Date of 

Completion as compared to the approved project proposal. It was also noted that 

some MOA were not notarized nor properly accomplished. Further, the deliverables 

indicated under Section 18 were not included as part of the responsibilities of the 

EVP Committee.   

 

Likewise, there was no written report attached in the partial supporting 

documents submitted by the EVP Committee. The written report could have proven 

the proponent’s conformance with his obligations, as stated in the MOA or 

approved project proposal.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the EVP 

Secretariat to: 
 

a) issue a reference number for each applicant upon receipt of application as 
basis for the payment of $125.00 processing fee and forward the same to 

AFD as basis for recording;  



55 

 

b) identify, in coordination with AFD, the cause of discrepancy on the number 
of endorsements through alternative arrangement and reconcile the 

variance of ETSP collections of ₱2,870.50 in CY 2017 and ₱79,570.80 in 

CY 2018;  

 

c) submit a complete set of copy of the supporting documents (i.e. annual list 
of NOS applicants, proof of payment/s for each applicant, approved 

project proposal, MOAs covering the two components of alternative 

arrangement, applicant terminal report, written report by the Monitoring 

Representatives, and a copy of NOS endorsement to Philippine Embassy) 

to the Audit Team for timely evaluation and analysis; and 

 

d) institute adequate internal controls on the billing and collection processes 
to safeguard government funds against possible losses or 

misappropriations. 

 

 

Unutilized scholarship funds 

 

5. Enhancement Training Sponsorship Program (ETSP) funds totaling 
₱623,093.17 remained unutilized due to unclear policies in the administration 

of funds which caused the discontinuance of the scholarship program. 

 

Section 4 of the GP of the GAA for FY 2020 states that as a general rule, 

all fees, charges, assessments and other receipts or revenues collected by 

departments, bureaus and officials of the National Government in the exercise of 

the mandated functions, at such rates as are now or may be approved by the 

appropriate approving authority shall be deposited to the National Treasury as 

income of the General Fund pursuant to Section 44, Chapter 5, Book VI of EO No. 

292, s. 1987, and Section 65 of PD No. 1445. 

 

While Section 2 of AO No. 242 mandates that EVP Committee to collect 

such administrative fees and charges as may be necessary, just and reasonable to 

cover the full cost of services rendered. 

 

Fund utilization of the processing fees and sponsorship collected for the 

period January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2020 retained in LBP trust fund is 

presented below:

Examination of the fund utilization disclosed that there were no releases for 

scholarship assistance since CY 2018 due to the dispute between CFO and BTr. 

The latter claimed that the remittances were collections that are administrative in 

nature; hence, should be classified as General Fund.  In this note, the Secretariat 

decided to advise the donors of ETSP to deposit to the account maintained under 

DBP. 

 

The examination also noted that there were unknown releases in the 

monitoring report of EVP funds maintained by AFD in the amounts of ₱43,767.31, 

₱2,000.00 and ₱72,346.98.  These releases were shown as discrepancies between 

the ending and opening balances in a given year. 

 

In addition, the collected NOS processing fees were not utilized in handling 

the NOS applications, instead the agency utilizes the General Fund. The processing 

fees collected were used for the scholarship assistance under the enhancement 

training program. 

 

Currently, the total balance of ETSP funds retained in LBP and DBP 

accounts amount to ₱623,093.17, presented as follows: 

 

Balance LBP DBP Total 

2018 222,204.07 240,296.30 462,500.37 

2019 -  78,705.00 78,705.00 

2020 81,887.80 -  81,887.80 

Total 304,091.77 319,001.30 623,093.17 

 

Review of the prevailing laws and regulations and the amended guidelines 

and procedures on the waiver of the two-year home residency requirement showed 

that they do not specifically classify ETSP funds as trust receipts. The MOA also 

does not declare that the transfer of $1,500.00 is indeed a donation with a term not 

exceeding one year. Therefore, the collected ETSP funds does not satisfy the 

requirements of the GP of the GAA for FY 2020 to be classified as trust receipts. 

 

 



57 

 

Any excess fund from the processing fees is also remitted to BTr since no 

specific law classifies it as trust receipt. If the EVP intends to use any excess 

processing fee for ETSP, the Secretariat should propose an update and/or revise the 

guidelines regarding the utilization of the excess processing fee. 

 

The ETSP funds and the processing fees retained in LBP and DBP accounts 

totaling ₱623,093.17 and ₱607,296.71, respectively, remained unutilized and 

currently not being remitted to BTr since there is no certainty that BTr will release 

it to CFO as the need arises. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the EVP 

Secretariat to: 
 

a) revisit the policies and guidelines on the management of processing fees 
and ETSP funds to properly classify them; hence, avoid complications in 

their remittance to BTr and release to CFO;  

 

b) direct the AFD to resolve the dispute with BTr and communicate the 
release of ETSP funds previously remitted for the continuance of the 

scholarship program under the enhancement training program; and 

 

c) review and revise the rules, regulations and policies on a regular basis to 
ensure that the objectives of AO NO. 242 are achieved. 

 

We further recommended and Management agreed to instruct the 

Accountant to reconcile the subsidiary ledger of EVP funds pertaining to the 

unknown releases of ₱43,767.31, ₱2,000.00 and ₱72,346.98, and submit the 

report to the Audit Team for evaluation.

Section 31 of the General Provisions (GP) of the General Appropriations 

Act (GAA) of FY 2020 (RA No. 11465) requires all agencies of the government to 

formulate a GAD Plan designed to address gender issues within their concerned 

sectors or mandate. The GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of 

the agencies, which shall be at least five percent of their budgets. 

 

The annual GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) for CY 2020 was reviewed and 

indorsed by the Philippine Commission on Women (PCW) under Endorsed GPB 

No. 2020-008911 dated February 12, 2020, as provided under JC No. 2004-001

Programs and Projects Related to Senior Citizens and Persons with Disability (PWD) 

 

9. Except for the infrastructures that aided and increased mobility of PWD, there 
were no budget allocated and programs planned for senior citizens and PWDs.  

 

Section 32 of the GP of the GAA of FY 2020 (RA No. 11465) provides that 

all agencies of the government shall formulate plans, programs and projects intended 

to address the concerns of senior citizens and persons with disability, insofar as it 

relates to their mandated functions, and integrate the same in their regular activities. 

 

Although there were no budget allocated and programs planned for senior 

citizens and PWDs, the CFO, however, delivered programs geared towards 

providing a friendly and less rigorous transaction for them during their pre-

departure registration, such as the following: 

 

1) Emigrants aged 60 years old and above were exempted from attending the 
mandatory Pre-departure Orientation Seminar; 

2) A priority lane for senior citizens and differently-abled persons was provided 
in the CFO registration area;

website were given special assistance by CFO registration officers to encode 

their data as part of their registration procedures within the CFO premises;

focal agency in charge of coordination with the centenarians abroad.
