The audit covered the review of accounts and operations of CFO for the period

statements; b) determine the propriety of transactions as well as extent of compliance 

on the applicable laws, rules and regulations; c) recommend agency improvement 

opportunities; and d) determine the extent of implementation of prior year’s 

recommendations. Moreover, the audit was conducted in accordance with International 

Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAIs). 

 

 

E. Opinion of the auditor on the fairness of presentation of the Financial Statements 
 

The Auditor rendered an unqualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of 

the financial statements of CFO as at December 31, 2020. 

 

 

F. Summary of Significant Observations and Recommendations 
 

The following are the significant audit observations and corresponding 

recommendations, which were discussed with Management officials concerned in an 

exit conference held on June 9, 2021, details of which are further discussed in the 

report. Management views and comments were incorporated in the report, where 

appropriate. 

 

1. Submission to the Auditor of financial statements (FS), the Reports of 
Disbursements (RD) and supporting documents was delayed by 10 to 249 days 

from the deadline set forth under Section 60(c), Chapter 19, Volume I of the 

Government Accounting Manual (GAM), precluding the timely analysis of 

accounts and audit of transactions for CY 2020. 



iv  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Director of 

Administrative and Finance Division (AFD) to judiciously plan the Alternative 

Working Arrangement (AWA) of his staff so as not to compromise the timely 

submission of financial reports, in compliance with Section 60(c), Chapter 19, 

Volume I of the GAM and Section 7.2.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-006. 

 

2. Checks totaling ₱42,373,943.38 were issued as direct payment to creditors instead 
of Authority to Debit Account (ADA), contrary to Department of Budget and 

Management (DBM) Circular Letter No. 2018-14 dated December 28, 2018 

impeding uniform payment system across governments.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Director of AFD to 

comply with the provisions of DBM Circular Letter No. 2018-14 dated December 

28, 2018 to implement checkless transactions and conform with the uniform 

payment system across governments. 

 

3. The Agency did not remit to the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) the year-end balance 
of the account Cash in Bank, Local Currency Current Account (LCCA) aggregating 

₱5,445,927.36, contrary to Section 6 of the General Provisions (GP) of RA No. 

11465 or the GAA for FY 2020 and Section 2 of Executive Order (EO) No. 338, 

depriving the government of funds that could have been used for other necessary 

projects. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Director of AFD to: 

 

a) remit the ₱5,445,927.36 to the BTr, in accordance with Section 6 of the GP of 
the GAA for FY 2020 and Section 2 of EO No. 338; and 

 

b) identify and monitor which funds are to be recorded as a special account in the 
General Fund to be available when needed through a Special Budget, pursuant 

to Section 53, Chapter 5, Book VI of EO No. 292. 

 

4. Several operational procedures in the implementation of Exchange Visitor Program 
(EVP) laid down in the EVP Resolution No. 01-2016 were not complied with due 

to weak internal controls on the bill and collection of processing fee and scholarship 

assistance, such as (a) inconsistencies in accounting the receipt of processing fees; 

(b) releases of No Objection Statement (NOS) or waiver without proper supporting 

documents; and c) absence of monitoring and evaluation report. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the EVP Secretariat to: 
 

a) issue a reference number for each applicant upon receipt of application as basis 
for the payment of $125.00 processing fee and forward the same to AFD as 

basis for recording;  

 



v  

b) identify, in coordination with AFD, the cause of discrepancy on the number of 
endorsements through alternative arrangement and reconcile the variance of 

ETSP collections of ₱2,870.50 in CY 2017 and ₱79,570.80 in CY 2018;  

 

c) submit a complete set of copy of the supporting documents (i.e. annual list of 
NOS applicants, proof of payment/s for each applicant, approved project 

proposal, MOAs covering the two components of alternative arrangement, 

applicant terminal report, written report by the Monitoring Representatives, and 

a copy of NOS endorsement to Philippine Embassy) to the Audit Team for 

timely evaluation and analysis; and 

 

d) institute adequate internal controls on the billing and collection processes to 
safeguard government funds against possible losses or misappropriations. 

 

5. Enhancement Training Sponsorship Program (ETSP) funds totaling ₱623,093.17 

remained unutilized due to unclear policies in the administration of funds which 

caused the discontinuance of the scholarship program. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the EVP Secretariat to: 
 

a) revisit the policies and guidelines on the management of processing fees and 
ETSP funds to properly classify them; hence, avoid complications in their 

remittance to BTr and release to CFO;  

 

b) direct the AFD to resolve the dispute with BTr and communicate the release of 
ETSP funds previously remitted for the continuance of the scholarship program 

under the enhancement training program; and 

 

c) review and revise the rules, regulations and policies on a regular basis to ensure 
that the objectives of AO NO. 242 are achieved. 

 

We further recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Accountant to 

reconcile the subsidiary ledger of EVP funds pertaining to the unknown releases of 

₱43,767.31, ₱2,000.00 and ₱72,346.98, and submit the report to the Audit Team 

for evaluation. 
 

 

G. Implementation of Prior Year’s Audit Recommendations 
 

Of the 41 audit recommendations embodied in the CY 2019 Annual Audit 

Report, 33 were implemented and 8 were not implemented, details of which are 

discussed in Part III of this report.
