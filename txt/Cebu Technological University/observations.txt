DETAILED AUDIT OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMENDATIONS





FINANCIAL AUDIT



1)	Payments of school fees from the students and the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) aggregating ₱53.989 million were not recorded in the books of the CTU Main, Daanbantayan and Moalboal Campuses, hence the balances of the Cash in Bank, Accounts Receivable and Income accounts in the Special Trust Fund are not fairly presented as at year-end. 



Chapter 19 of the Government Accounting Manual for National Government Agencies, Volume I prescribe the manner in which the general-purpose financial statements should be prepared and presented.  Section 7 thereof pertains to the fair presentation of the financial statements, quoted as follows:



“Financial statements shall present fairly the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in PPSASs. “



Likewise, paragraph 2, Section 111, Chapter 2 of P.D. No. 1445, provides:



“(2) The highest standards of honesty, objectivity and consistency shall be observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate or misleading information.”



In the verification of school fees account during the year, the following observations were noted;



a)	Payments of school fees from the students and the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) totaling ₱52.087 million, which were directly deposited to CTU Main Campus’ depository bank accounts, were not recorded in the books, hence, the balances of the Cash in Bank, Accounts Receivable and Income accounts in the Special Trust Fund as of reporting date are not fairly presented.

The financial reports of CTU Main Campus as at December 31, 2020 disclosed that the Cash in Bank-Local Currency, Current Accounts of the Special Trust Fund have carrying balance of ₱100,500,678.70, comprising of:

Review of the bank reconciliation statements for the STF and IGP showed that the two bank accounts pertaining to the abovementioned funds have reconciling items aggregating ₱52,087,070.61. These reconciling items are attributable to the school fees, which were directly deposited to the Campus depository banks, but were not recorded in the books, such as: Graduate School students school fees, receipt of funds from CHED Central Office for the school fees of tertiary education students, school fees for the Diploma in Public Education (DPE) and for the Online Graduate School students.



Details of the unrecorded collections directly deposited in the Campus’ depository accounts are shown in Table 1:

*Bank Reconciliation Statement submitted is as of September 30, 2020.



It was learned from the Cashier that the payments of school fees directly deposited to the Campus’ bank depository accounts were not taken up in the books as the payors did not inform their Office of such payment.  Collections are receipted once the students presented their proof of deposit to the Cashier’s Office.  

	Further inquiry from the Accountant revealed that the graduate and tertiary student’s school fees were recognized as Accounts Receivable while the fees for the DPE and online graduate school students are recorded to its appropriate income account when receipted. With this condition, it appears that some of the payments which were made directly to the Campus’ depository bank were not yet deducted from the receivable account in the STF. While payment for the DPE and online graduate school studies, appropriate income was not recognized. Hence, the balances of the Cash in Bank, Accounts Receivable and Income accounts as of reporting date are not fairly presented.



We recommended and Management agreed to formulate detailed and systematic procedures in recording the collections from the students and other entities through direct deposits to the bank. Also, make representation with the concerned officials of the Campus’ depository bank to institute a system or procedure wherein the payments/deposits made directly to the Campus’ depository accounts can be readily identifiable. Henceforth, ensure that direct deposits or online payments to the bank are immediately taken up or recognized in the books in order to fairly present the financial statements at the end of the reporting period.



	The Chief Administrative Officer commented that they will coordinate with the Development Bank of the Philippines and Land Bank of the Philippines on the existing bank procedures wherein payments of students through direct deposit with the Campus depository accounts can be readily identifiable.



b)	Payments of school fees from the CHED totaling ₱1.902 million, which were directly credited to the CTU Daanbantayan and Moalboal Campus’ bank accounts were not recorded in the books, hence, the balances of the Cash in Bank, Accounts Receivable and appropriate Income accounts in the Special Trust Fund as of reporting date are not fairly presented.

Review of the Cash-in-bank balances of CTU Daanbantayan and Moalboal Campuses as at December 31, 2020 disclosed that separate bank accounts were maintained at the Authorized Government Depository Bank (AGDB). The accounts were purposely opened for the cash assistance received from the Department of Education (DepEd), which was intended for the payment of school fees of Senior High School Students of CTU Daanbantayan and Moalboal Campuses.  For the year 2020, school fees intended for the CHED Scholars were downloaded in the said account. Details of the bank transactions are as follows:

*The amount of ₱1,177,500.00, which was erroneously downloaded by CHED to CTU Daanbantayan’s Account on December 21, 2020, hence, there was double payment of school fees for Tulong-dunong Scholars. A maintaining of balance ₱10,000.00 was set up by the Campus upon opening of the account. Thus, the total receipts from CHED in CY 2020 should have been ₱1,413,500.00.

**The ending balance totaling ₱501,534.49 as of 12/31/2020 is composed of the ₱10,000.00 maintaining balance, bank interest of P2,534.49 and payment of school fees from CHED in the amount of P489,000.00.



	During the audit, it was learned that the payment of school fees from CHED, which were directly credited to CTU Daanbantayan and Moalboal Campus’ Senior High School Accounts amounting to ₱1,413,500.00 and ₱489,000.00, respectively or totaling ₱1,902,500.00, were not taken up in the books of the two campuses.  Collections are receipted only once payments are withdrawn from the said account and transferred to the campus’ Special Trust Fund account.  



Inquiry with the bookkeepers revealed that the student’s school fees were recognized as Accounts Receivable at the beginning of the semester. With this condition, it appears that some of the payments which were credited directly to the Campus’ Senior High School Account were not yet deducted from the receivable account in the STF. Hence, the balances of the Cash in Bank, Accounts Receivable and appropriate Income accounts as of reporting date are not fairly presented.



The above-mentioned circumstances did not conform to the quoted regulation on the faithful representation of the transactions in accordance with the recognition criteria for assets, and income in this particular case as substantial amount of collections were not promptly recorded in the books. 



We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the bookkeepers of CTU Daanbantayan and Moalboal Campus to record immediately the payment of school fees, which were credited directly to the Campus’ Senior High School Bank Account in the Special Trust Fund books, to ensure adherence with the standards on the principle of recognition, and to fairly present the financial statements as at year-end.

2)	School fees and other income of CTU Carmen and San Francisco Campuses were not recognized as these occurred but recorded only to its appropriate income accounts upon receipt of the collections, resulting in the overstatement of the CY 2020 Income account in the Special Trust Fund by ₱45.996 million. 



Chapter 2, Volume I of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for NGAs provide for the following, and we quote:  



“Sec. 2. Definition of Terms.



a. Accrual basis – means a basis of accounting under which transactions and other events are recognized when they occur (and not only when cash or its equivalent is received or paid). Therefore, the transactions and events are recognized in the accounting records and recognized in the financial statements of the periods to which they relate. The elements recognized under accrual accounting are assets, liabilities, net assets/equity, revenue, and expenses.

.  .  . 

Sec. 6.  Basic Government Accounting and Budget Reporting Principles. 



	Each entity shall recognize and present its financial transactions and operations conformably to the following: 

a)		. . .

b)		accrual basis of accounting in accordance with the PPSAS;

	            . . .



Moreover, paragraph 2.1 of COA Circular Letter No. 2004-002 dated September 30, 2004 provides that: 



“2.0 GENERAL GUIDELINES AND PROCEDURES 



2.1 The accrual method of accounting shall be used in recording income from tuition fees and it shall be recorded in the Regular Agency (RA) Book. Based on the final assessment of students upon enrollment, the Accounting Unit shall record the "Accounts Receivable" with the corresponding credit to income account "Tuition Fees".”



	In CY 2020, CTU-Carmen and CTU San Francisco Campuses were able to collect the prior years’ accounts receivable aggregating ₱45,996,163.59, as follows:

To recognize revenue from the accounts receivable collected



	As can be gleaned from the prepared accounting entries, revenues pertaining to the previous years were only recognized as income upon receipt of the cash collections in CY 2020. The above condition is not in keeping with the pertinent provisions of the GAM for NGAs Volume I, which adopts the accrual basis of accounting as a basic government accounting and budgeting principle, resulting in the overstatement of current year’s Income by ₱45,996,163.59. 



We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Bookkeepers of CTU Carmen and San Francisco Campuses to apply the accrual method of accounting in recording the assessed Tuition and Other School Fees for every semester to conform with the accounting guidelines as prescribed in the Government Accounting Manual and COA Circular Letter No. 2004-002.  For guidance, the following entries are recommended:

3)	COA Disallowances with issued Notices of Finality of Decision aggregating ₱3.887 million were not recorded as receivables by the seven CTU Campuses contrary to the provisions of COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009, thereby, understating the Receivables-Disallowances/Charges and Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) accounts by the same amount.



	Commission on Audit (COA) Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2019 prescribes the use of the 2009 Rules and Regulations on the Settlement of Accounts. Section 22.1 thereof provides that a decision of the Commission Proper, Director or Auditor upon any matter within their respective jurisdiction, if not appealed within the prescribed period, shall become final and executory. The rules also state that the period to file an appeal by any person aggrieved by a disallowance is within six (6) months from receipt of the notice. Consequently, the authorized COA official shall issue a Notice of Finality of Decision (NFD) to the agency head to notify that a decision of the Auditor, Director, or Commission Proper has become final and executory, there being no appeal or motion for reconsideration filed within the reglementary period.



	Section 7.2 of the same Circular specifies the responsibilities of the Agency Accountant in the settlement of accounts:



	7.2 	Responsibility of the Agency Accountant

		

7.2.1 The Chief Accountant, Bookkeeper or other authorized official performing accounting and/or bookkeeping functions of the audited agency shall ensure that:



a)	x  x  x ;

b)	x  x  x ;

c)	x  x  x ;



d)	the disallowances and charges that have become final and executory as contained in the Notice of Finality of Decision (NFD) are recorded in the books of accounts, and settlements thereof under the NSSDC are dropped therefrom; and



e)	the subsidiary ledgers/records are maintained and properly updated for each official/employee determined to be liable/responsible for the amount disallowed/charged/suspended.



Also, Section 22.6 thereof states that: “the Chief Accountant shall, on the basis of the NFD, record in the books of accounts, the disallowance and/or charge as a receivable.”



Monitoring of settlement of suspensions/disallowances/charges of the University disclosed that several Notices of Disallowances (NDs) of seven Campuses totaling P3,887,758.06, which were already issued with NFDs were not recorded in the Campus’ books of accounts. Details of the following NDs with NFDs per Campus are shown in Annex A:

	The GAM Volume III prescribes the Receivables-Disallowance/Charges as the account to be used to recognize the amount of disallowances/charges in audit due from public/private individuals/entities which have become final and executory.



Moreover, disallowances and charges shall be dropped from the books of accounts upon receipt by the Accountant of the Notice of Settlement of Suspension/Disallowances/ Charge (NSSDC) as provided in Section 24 of COA Circular No. 2009-006.



The non-recording of the COA disallowances aggregating ₱3,887,758.06, which already attained finality of decision, resulted in the understatement of the Receivables-Disallowances/Charges and Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) accounts by the same amount.



	We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Bookkeepers to record as receivables in the books of accounts the COA Disallowances with NFDs already received by concerned personnel pursuant to Section 7.2.1 and 22.6 of COA Circular No. 2009-006.  Likewise, maintain a subsidiary ledger on the said account, and accordingly notify the Audit Team in case of payment or settlement thereof.

4)	Unclaimed stale checks of seven CTU Campuses aggregating ₱3.148 million were not restored to the Cash in Bank- LCCA and appropriate liability accounts contrary to the provisions of GAM for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I, resulting in the understatement of the affected accounts as at December 31, 2020. 



The GAM for NGAs provides the guidelines on the accounting for cancelled checks when they become stale, voided or spoiled, quoted as follows:



Section

Provision

Sec. 44, Chapter 6. Accounting for Cancelled Checks.

Checks may be cancelled when they become stale, voided or spoiled.  The depository bank considers a check stale, if it has been outstanding for over six months from date of issue or as prescribed.



A stale, voided or spoiled check shall be marked cancelled on its face and reported as follows:



a)	Voided, spoiled or unclaimed stale checks with the Cashier shall be reported as cancelled in the List of Unreleased Checks that will be attached to the RCI.



b)	New checks may be issued for the replacement of stale/spoiled checks in the hands of the payees or holders in due course, upon submission of the stale/spoiled checks to the Accounting Division/Unit.  A certified copy of the previously paid DVs shall be attached to the request for replacement. A JEV shall be prepared to take up the cancellation. The replacement check shall  be reported in the RCI.



Sec. 56, Chapter 19. Adjustments for Unreleased Commercial Checks

	A Schedule of Unreleased Commercial Checks shall be prepared by the Cashier for submission to the Accounting Division/Unit. All unreleased checks at the end of the year shall be reverted back to the cash accounts. A JEV shall be prepared to recognize the restoration of the cash equivalent to the unreleased checks and the recognition of the appropriate liability/payable account. The accounting entry for the restoration of the unreleased check to the cash account shall be a debit to “Cash in Bank, Local Currency Current” account with credit to the appropriate liability account. There shall be no physical cancellation of the checks. Xxxxx….” (Emphasis supplied)



Verification of the available Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS) of the CTU Campuses revealed that seven Campuses have outstanding checks listed as reconciling items totaling ₱3,148,152.75 (details are shown in Annex B). These checks were unreleased or unclaimed and have become stale as of date of the BRS, as follows:

As required under the aforementioned quoted provisions of the GAM, the amount representing unreleased checks should be restored to the Cash in Bank and liability accounts in order to reflect the correct balances of the accounts as at a given period.  Likewise, the amount of stale checks should be treated similarly since the checks could no longer be negotiated. The non-restoration of the amount of stale checks resulted in the understatement of the cash in bank and payable accounts by ₱3,148,152.75.



We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Cashier to submit to the Accounting Division the List of Unreleased Checks to provide the Bookkeeper with a basis in reverting to the proper cash and liability accounts the corresponding amount of unreleased/unclaimed stale checks to comply with the provisions of the GAM to reflect the correct account balances in the financial statements as at year-end.

5)	Properties purchased in CY 2020 and recorded under the Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) account totaling ₱2.499 million by the CTU San Francisco Campus were not provided with depreciation contrary to the provisions of Sections 22 and 27, Chapter 10 of GAM for NGAs Volume I, thus the carrying amount of the PPE was overstated by ₱84,034.29 while the related Depreciation Expense and Accumulated Depreciation were understated by the same amount.



	Sec. 27, Chapter 10 of GAM for NGAs states the following: 

	

	“Depreciation. PPE gradually loses its ability to provide service over the course of time. Because of this, its cost needs to be distributed on a systematic basis over its useful life. The allocated cost is referred to as depreciation. The depreciation charge for each period shall be recognized as expense unless it is included in the carrying amount of another asset.  .  .  . x  x  x  .  .  .The following are policies regarding depreciation of PPE:

	

a)		.  .  .

b)		Except for land and not recognized heritage assets, all PPE shall be depreciated.

c)		Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use such as when it is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by the management. For simplicity and to avoid proportionate computation, depreciation shall be one month if the PPE is available for use on or before the 15th of the month. However, if the PPE is available for use after the 15th of the month, depreciation shall be for the succeeding month.

d)		Depreciation of an asset ceases when the asset is derecognized. Therefore, depreciation does not cease when the asset becomes idle or it is retired from active use and held for disposal unless the asset is fully depreciated.

e)		.  .  .

	.  .  . x  x  x .  .  .” (Emphasis Supplied)



Section 22, Chapter 10 of GAM for NGAs requires the application of the cost model to an entire class of PPE. Cost model means that PPE are carried at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.



	Verification of the Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) as of December 31, 2020 disclosed that several properties purchased in CY 2020 were not provided with depreciation. Computation of the corresponding depreciation revealed that the Depreciation Expense and Accumulated Depreciation as at year-end were understated by ₱84,034.29, with details shown in Annex C. 



For reference, Section 27 (i) Chapter 10 of GAM Volume I provided the guidelines for the residual value to be used as, “a residual value equivalent to at least five percent (5%) of the cost shall be adopted unless a more appropriate percentage is determined by the entity based on its operation subject to the approval of COA.” (Emphasis Supplied)



	We recommended and Management agreed to require the Bookkeeper of CTU San Francisco Campus to prepare the necessary adjusting entry to take-up the depreciation expense and the related accumulated depreciation in order to reflect the correct carrying amount of the PPE accounts. Henceforth, ensure that all depreciable PPE accounts of the Campus are subjected to periodic depreciation. 



	The proposed adjusting journal entry to take-up the depreciation expense and the related accumulated depreciation is:

6)	Other Receivables account of CTU Argao Campus totaling ₱346,343.55 was not provided with Allowance for Impairment contrary to Section 10, Chapter 7 of the GAM for NGAs Volume I, hence, the balance of the said account was not stated at its estimated realizable value as at year end.



	Section 10, Chapter 7 of the GAM for NGAs Volume I, sets forth the regulations on Impairment of Financial Assets as follows:



	“An entity shall assess at the end of each reporting period whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired. If any such evidence exists, the entity shall measure the amount of loss as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and the present value of estimated cash flows discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset shall be reduced either directly or through the use of an allowance account. The amount of loss shall be recognized in the surplus or deficit.



	In case of Accounts Receivable, the Allowance for Impairment shall be provided in an amount based on collectability of receivable balances and evaluation of such factors as aging of accounts, collection experiences of the agency, expected loss experiences, and identified doubtful accounts”. (Emphasis Supplied)	

	

	It can be gleaned in Table 14 that about 64.79 percent of the total receivables of ₱346,343.55 are amounts due from the permanent employees of the Campus, thus there is high probability of collections as they are still connected with the agency. While 35.21 percent are considered doubtful since these are receivables from officers and employees who are no longer connected with the agency, hence collection may already be remote. With the prevailing condition, it can reasonably be concluded that the Other Receivables account balance of ₱346,343.55 as at year-end was not stated at its estimated realizable value since no Allowance for Impairment was set up. 



	We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to provide an Allowance for Impairment of the Other Receivables account based on their objective assessment in the collectability of the account in accordance with the provisions of Section 10, Chapter 7 of the GAM, Volume I.



	For guidance, the journal entry for the provision of Allowance for Impairment of the Other Receivables account is:

7)	Computer Software account of CTU Danao Campus totaling ₱230,000.00 was not provided with Allowance for Amortization contrary to Section 9, Chapter 12 of the GAM for NGAs Volume I, hence, the balance of the said account was not stated at its estimated realizable value as at year end.



	Chapter 12 of the GAM Volume I covers the accounting treatment, recognition, measurement, as well as, the presentation and disclosure requirements in reporting intangible assets. 



	Intangible asset is defined as the identifiable non-monetary asset without physical substance.  In Section 5, Chapter 12 of GAM Volume I, it states that an intangible asset shall be measured initially at cost and if an intangible asset is acquired through a non-exchange transaction, its initial cost at the date of acquisition shall be measured at its fair value as at that date. Section 8 of the same chapter of that GAM provides that after initial recognition, intangible asset should be carried at its cost less any accumulated amortization and any accumulated impairment loss.



	Furthermore, Section 9 of the same chapter discussed its classification and useful life, quoted as follows:



“Intangible assets are classified as having: (a) Indefinite life – no foreseeable limit to the period over which the asset is expected to generate net cash inflows for, or provides service potential to, the entity; and (b) Finite life – a limited period of benefit to the entity. xxx



The depreciable amount of an intangible asset with a finite useful life shall be allocated on a systematic basis over its useful life. As a guideline, the finite useful life of intangible assets shall be 2 to 10 years. Amortization shall begin when the asset is available for use, i.e., when it is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Amortization shall cease at the earlier of the date that the asset is classified as held for sale (or included in a disposal group that is classified as held for sale). (Par. 96, PPSAS 31)

	The Computer Software account of CTU Danao consists of Upgrade in Student Information System of the existing Management Information System (MIS) and NVivo Qualitative Research Software of the campus. These software were purchased way back in 2015 and 2017, respectively. Computer software is among the common examples of intangible asset with finite life since the asset can be utilized for a limited period and of benefit to the Campus, as computer software are always evolving/changing.



	Review of the submitted financial statements disclosed that the Campus did not recognize the corresponding expenses for the amortization on the recorded intangible assets. Considering that the agency uses the computer software daily, it must allocate the cost of these intangible assets over their estimated useful life.



The non-provision of amortization would mean that the real net value of Computer Software as at year-end was not accurately presented, therefore, casting doubt on the reliability of the account in the financial statements.



	We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Bookkeeper of CTU Danao Campus to compute and recognize in the books of accounts the Amortization Expense and Accumulated Amortization related to the Intangible Asset in accordance with Chapter 12 of GAM Volume I.



	The following are the recommended journal entries in recognizing amortization for intangible assets:

8)	Various payables of CTU Carmen and San Francisco Campus aggregating ₱602,638.37 were not classified to their appropriate accounts in accordance with the description of the account as provided under COA Circular No. 2020-001 dated January 8, 2020 on the Revised Chart of Accounts (RCA) for NGAs. 



The descriptions of the accounts to be used in the financial transactions of NGAs are provided in the GAM Volume III as prescribed under COA Circular No. 2020-001. The following are the descriptions of some Payable accounts:

This account is credited to recognize the withholding of employees’ premium payments and other payables for remittance to the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS). This account is debited for the remittance of withheld amount, and/or adjustments.



Verification of the Payable accounts of CTU Carmen and San Francisco Campus as of December 31, 2020 disclosed that several payables were not classified to its appropriate liability accounts. Details of the misclassified accounts are shown in Annex D.



The misclassification of accounts is not in conformity with the Revised Chart of Accounts. Even though the affected accounts are all considered Liability accounts.  Proper classification of the transactions in the financial statements to be used should be in accordance with the descriptions in the Revised Chart of Accounts.



	We recommended and Management agreed to direct the bookkeeper to use the proper account code/title in recording the payables in accordance with COA Circular No. 2020-001 on the Revised Chart of Accounts (Updated 2019) for NGAs. 



COMPLIANCE AUDIT



9)		The external campuses of the Cebu Technological University (CTU) are not compliant with the requirement of Section 60, Chapter 19, and Section 7, Chapter 21 of Government Accounting Manual (GAM) Volume I as financial reports for CY 2020 and in the previous years were not submitted within the prescribed timelines. This condition had caused delay in the consolidation of financial reports of the CTU System and had prevented the Audit Team from rendering timely review of the accounts and submission of reports.

	

		Section 60, Chapter 19 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) Volume I for the National Government Agencies (NGAs), provides the deadlines on submission of reports as follows:

	

		Sec. 60. Deadlines on Submission of Reports. All NGAs shall prepare and submit the following financial statements and schedules as follows, within the prescribed deadline:

	

a)			Provincial Offices and Operating Units

		

		Entity/Office

	Statement/Report

		Deadline

		Submit to:

		Monthly

		Trial Balances (TBs) and Supporting Schedules (SSs)

		Ten days after the end of the month

		Auditor, Regional Accountant

		Quarterly

		TBs, FSs, SSs

		Ten days after the end of the quarter

		Auditor, Regional Accountant

		Yearly

		TBs, FSs, SSs

		On or before January 20 of the following year

		Auditor, Regional Accountant

	

		Section 7, Chapter 21 of the GAM Volume I for NGAs also requires the Chief Accountant to submit the original copy of the Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS) including all the supporting documents and JEVs to the Audit Team within 20 days after receipt of the monthly bank statements. 

	

		It was noted that the Bookkeepers of the external campuses of CTU continue to disregard the Audit Team’s demand for the timely and regular submission of monthly, quarterly and annual financial reports in accordance with the timeline set by the Commission.  As of April 29, 2021, all external campuses have submitted their financial reports for CY 2020 except, CTU Argao, CTU Danao and CTU Moalboal. 

	

		 Demand letters requesting for the submission of said reports were already made.  While, the audit team understands the challenges brought about by the current public health crisis, it is emphasized that government officials and employees are also required to render a timely account on government spending to ensure that there is efficient public financial accountability especially during this time of pandemic.

	

	The delayed submission of financial reports for CY 2020 not only precluded the audit team from conducting review of the financial transactions of the Campus as of December 31, 2020 but had also caused delay in the consolidation of the financial reports of the CTU System. 

	

		In addition to the reports mentioned above, Section 47, Chapter 19 of the GAM Volume I provided other reports to be submitted, such as:

	

		Sec. 47. Preparation and Submission of Other Reports. In addition to the set of financial statements enumerated in Sec. 5 of this Chapter, the following reports/schedules/statements shall be submitted to GAS, COA:

	

a)		Pre-Closing Trial Balances

b)		Post-Closing

c)		Other Schedules

1)		Regional Breakdown of Income

2)		Regional Breakdown of Expenses

	

		We recommended that Management direct the concerned Accountants/Bookkeepers to expedite the preparation and submission of the required financial reports every year thereafter, pursuant to Sections 7, 47 and 60, Chapter 19 of the GAM Volume I, and for the Campus Director to monitor its submission.



	The University had issued CTU Memorandum No. PD19-149, 2021 dated April 19, 2021 to all Campus Directors demanding for the submission of the financial statements as of December 31, 2020 on April 30, 2021.  It further stated that effective CY 2021, a policy on “No Report, No Release” of sub-allotments and funding checks shall be strictly imposed for non-submission of the required financial reports.



10)	Seven CTU external campuses still did not revert the unutilized cash allocations for FY 2019 and the preceding years aggregating ₱77.427 million in the General Fund books to the Bureau of Treasury (BTr), contrary to the provisions of COA Circular No. 90-326 dated February 22, 1990, and DBM National Budget Circulars which prescribe the guidelines on the release of funds for the year, resulting in the accumulation of substantial amount in the Cash in Bank account as at December 31, 2020. Such practice deprived the government of maximizing the use of the unutilized funds for other relevant undertakings.



CTU is among the agencies of the National Government receiving budgetary support from the National Government through the General Appropriations Act (GAA). CTU Main Campus receives Notice of Cash Allocation (NCA) from the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) for all its campuses through its Modified Disbursement System (MDS) account maintained in the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP). Subsequently, upon the receipt of NCA in the University’s MDS account, the main campus transfers the funds to its satellite campuses through their General Fund’s Local Currency, Current Account. 



For CTU external campuses, the NCAs were transferred to their current accounts under the General Fund. The following table shows the receipt of NCA for the regular operating expenditures, Cash in Bank balances and Liabilities for FY 2019.

*The balance in the Due to Operating Units Account is comprised of the receivables from CTU Argao’s Special Trust Fund (STF). This is due to the erroneous disbursements taken from the General Fund (GF), which disbursements should have been taken from the Special Trust Fund (STF). This is also due to the collections/refund of cash advances deposited in STF, which should have been reverted to the BTr. Thus, the accurate Cash balance of CTU Argao for Fund 101 should have been ₱19,054,014.65.  

**The balance in the Due to Operating Units Account is comprised of the receivables from CTU Danao’s Special Trust Fund (STF). This is due to the erroneous disbursements taken from the General Fund (GF), which disbursements should have been taken from the Special Trust Fund (STF). This is also due to the collections/refund of cash advances deposited in STF, which should have been reverted to the BTr. Thus, the accurate Cash balance of CTU Danao for Fund 101 should have been ₱23,460,048.90.  



From the books of the Main Campus, it appears that the MDS funds have already been obligated as the MDS funds were transferred to the external campuses current account, but actually it is only a mere transfer of funds from MDS account to the current account of the Campus and not as disbursements for incurrence of obligations in the General Fund books. 



Nonetheless, in the books of the external campuses, not all funds received from the Main Campus were already disbursed.  Such condition resulted in the accumulation of substantial balance ₱77,427,739,84 under the Cash in Bank accounts in the General Fund of the external campuses. 



Comparison of Cash in Bank balances against their Liabilities, as shown in the table above, would prove the huge amount of the Cash in Bank that are still under the General Fund books of the external campuses. Clearly, the unutilized or unencumbered cash balance remains in the current account of the external campuses.  There were no documents to show that there are obligations related to the University’s programs, projects and activities which were earmarked from the said funds.  Such practice is not only contrary to the provisions of COA Circular No. 90-326 dated February 22, 1990 and DBM National Budget Circular No. 567 dated January 3, 2018 but also deprived the government in maximizing the use of said unutilized/unencumbered funds for other relevant undertakings.



Inquiry with the Bookkeepers revealed that to date, there has no remittance of the unutilized cash allocation in the General Fund to the Bureau of Treasury.  However, the audit team could not determine the unutilized cash allocation as of December 31, 2020 since the Bookkeepers have not yet submitted the financial reports during the year as of the issuance of the Audit Observation Memoranda.



  COA Circular No. 90-326 dated February 22, 1990 provide the accounting guidelines and procedures in the implementation of the MDS.  This covers all funds appropriated in the General Appropriations Act (GAA). Pertinent provisions are quoted below:  



“4.0

Guidelines



4.11

Refunds of cash advances and overpayments shall be remitted to the National Treasury by Offices receiving the Notice of Allocation (NOA) directly from DBM.





4.12

Any balance of deposits per books of the Provincial Offices/ Operating Units corresponding to the unobligated allotment at the end of the year, shall be withdrawn for remittance to the National Treasury and covered by a remittance advice.  In case the unobligated allotment is not backed up by cash, no such withdrawal shall be made.





4.13

Balance of NOA at the end of the year shall automatically expire and shall no longer be valid for use in the ensuing year.



On the other hand, DBM National Budget Circular No. 577 dated May 2, 2019 provides:

“3.0

General Guidelines





3.1

….



3.2

All appropriations authorized under the FY 2019 GAA, as well as programmed automatic appropriations shall be valid for release and obligation for the purpose specified until December 31, 2019.  This validity shall be subject to the pertinent Special and General Provisions of said GAA, the President’s Veto Message on the implementation of cash budgeting, as well as other pertinent laws.”



Item 3.4.1 of DBM National Budget Circular No. 578 dated January 6, 2020 which prescribes the guidelines on the release of funds for FY 2020, states:



“3.4.1  The appropriations for the following items under the FY 2020 GAA shall be valid for obligation until December 31, 2020:



	3.4.1.1  Infrastructure Capital Outlays (CO), including subsidy releases to GOCCs for infrastructure projects: and



	3.4.1.2  MOOE and other CO items



Similar guidelines are issued by the DBM on the release of funds from the General Appropriation Act corresponding to that fiscal year.



We recommended and Management agreed to require the concerned Budget Officers to prepare a statement of the unutilized funds as of December 31, 2020 and every year thereafter. We also recommended that the concerned   Accountant/Bookkeepers prepare a disbursement voucher for the remittance of the unutilized/unencumbered funds to the Bureau of Treasury in compliance with COA Circular No. 90-326 and DBM National Budget Circulars.  



11)	Excess of registration fees derived from the conduct of National Conference for the Arts, Sciences, and Education (N-CASE) in CY 2020 amounting to ₱1.131 million was not remitted to the National Treasury but was recognized as Income Generating Projects (IGPs) of the University, contrary to Section 12 of the General Provisions of RA No.  11465 or the GAA FY 2020.



On October 23, 2019, Board of Regent (BOR) Resolution No. 126, series of 2019 was passed approving the request of CTU to open a separate bank account for the university wide research and development IGP and external grants at the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP).  Its objective was to ensure that funds are managed efficiently as well as generate income from authorized conferences and trainings.  The authorized representatives in opening the accounts are the Vice-President of the Research and Development (VPRD), the University Director for Grants Administration and the OIC-Cashier. 



On February 19-21, 2020, the Office of the VPRD organized the conduct of N-CASE which aimed to discuss epistemological, theoretical, methodological and technological issues in the human sciences that challenged researchers in the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences and education. This was participated mainly by the members of the faculty in the University.  Total registration fees collected on the said conference amounted to ₱2,017,500.00, details are shown in the table below:

	Comparison of Tables 7 and 8 showed that the conduct of N-CASE Conference generated net proceeds of ₱1,131,621.55 (₱2,017,500.00 less ₱885,878.45). The proceeds remained in the books of the University which is not compliant with the provisions of Section 12 of RA No. 11465 or the General Appropriations Act FY 2020, quoted below:



Sec. 12.  Conduct of Seminar, Conference, Training, and Oath Taking Program.  Departments, bureaus, offices, and instrumentalities of the National Government, including Constitutional Offices enjoying fiscal autonomy which conduct seminar, conference, training and oath taking programs in relation to their mandated functions are authorized to collect fees from government and  private agency participants for said activities.



The proceeds derived from each seminar, conference, training, and oath taking activities shall be deposited with the National Treasury as income of the General Fund pursuant to Section 44, Chapter 5, Book VI of E.O. No. 292.  However, the agencies which do not have appropriations in their budgets for the purpose may use the proceeds for the conduct of the said seminar, conferences, training, and oath taking activities subject to budgeting, accounting and auditing rules and regulations.  Any excess proceeds shall be deposited with the National Treasury as income of the General Fund.



	The agency concerned shall submit quarterly reports on its financial and physical accomplishments, within thirty (30) days after the end of every quarter, through the following:



a)	Unified Reporting System (URS) or other electronic means for reports not covered by the URS; and

b)	Agency’s website.



The agency concerned shall send written notice when said reports have been submitted or posted on its website to the DBM, House of Representatives, Senate of the Philippines, House Committee on Appropriations, Senate Committee on Finance, and other offices where the submission of reports is required under existing laws, rules and regulations.  The date to said agencies shall be considered the date of compliance with this requirement. (Emphasis ours)

	The above-quoted rule is very clear on the treatment of registration fees from seminars, conferences, etc, conducted by government agencies which should be deposited to the National Treasury. Hence, the net proceeds thereof could not be considered as income generating project of the University.  



	To emphasize, IGPs in tertiary-level institutions are encouraged to venture into business to generate more income that will augment the University’s resources and fill in the budget gap, if there is any, for any relevant and necessary expenditure items the University may incur.  As defined in CHED Memorandum Order No. 20, series of 2011, IGP refers to activities which generate additional revenues for the specific purpose it was created. Examples of these income generating projects are income from sale of commodities in the food production program authorized under Letter of Instruction (LOI) No. 872, income from sale of manufacturing operations under LOI No. 1046 and dorm rental and the like as provided in CHED Memorandum Order No. 20, series of 2011.  As shown in Table 7, it is obvious that the main source of income of the IGP administered by the Office of the VPRD is the registration fee of ₱1.944 million coming from the General Fund of the University, which obviously is funded by the government itself.  Thus, there is no way that the University was able to generate additional revenues. It appears that there was only a mere transfer of funds from the General Fund to the IGP.



	Considering that Training Expenses for the University personnel is among the appropriation in the approved budget of the University in the General Fund and Special Trust Fund, it is only appropriate that any expenses incurred related thereto will be charged directly to the said expense item of the particular fund.  Thus, there is no need to collect registration fees from the University personnel.   Only the registration fees derived from non-CTU personnel can be considered as income of the IGP.



	We recommended that Management remit the net proceeds derived from the registration fees of N-CASE to the National Treasury in accordance with Section 12 of the general provisions of RA No.11465 or the GAA FY 2020. Also, we recommended that Management stop the practice of collecting registration fees from the University personnel who are attending seminars/conferences/trainings initiated by the University as it merely involves transfer of one fund to another.  Instead, recognize the appropriate accounts for the charges/expenses that will be incurred in relation thereto.

	

	The Chief Administrative Officer commented that they will have to meet with the concerned Office to address the issue.



12)	Expenditures totaling ₱0.531 million were charged against the net proceeds of the registration fees from N-CASE even without an approved budget contrary to the provisions of Section 4 of PD No. 1445, Section 22, Article IV of CHED Memorandum Order No. 20, series of 2011 and Section 2.2 to 2.4 of COA Circular No. 2000-002 April 4, 2000. 



Under Section 4, Article II of CHED Memorandum Order No. 20, series of 2011, the Income-Generating Projects/Units of State Universities and Colleges is considered as Other Fiduciary Funds and form part of the Special Trust Fund of the University. Before disbursements are made, there is a need for a budget to be approved by the BOR.  This requirement is provided in the following rules listed below:



Law/Rules/Regulations

Provision

Section 4 of PD No. 1445

Section 4. Fundamental principles. Financial transactions and operations of any government agency shall be governed by the fundamental principles set forth hereunder, to wit:

Section 22, Article IV of CHED Memorandum Order No. 20, series of 2011

Section 22.  Documents to Support Budget Proposal – The budget for the use of income shall be submitted for approval to the BOR/T.  However, no budget shall be submitted for approval by the BOR/T unless the same is accompanied by the following;



a)	A certificate of duly signed by the Accountant that collections have been made, duly receipted and deposited in the official government depository bank.  Such certification shall be broken down by college, campus, and fund (fiduciary, self-liquidating projects and activities and regular funds) showing the details of the fees collected.

b)	Annual Procurement Plan (APP)/ Project Procurement Management Plan (PPMP)/

	b)	A special budget for the utilization of the STF, supported by a Certification from the Chief Accountant that sufficient income had been realized, collected and deposited with an AGDB shall be approved by the (BOR/T) of the University/College. 



	c)	The approved special budget shall be the basis of the Chief Accountant in recording appropriations and allotments



Verification of the financial transactions in the IGP fund administered by the Office of the VPRD revealed that various expenditures in CY 2020 aggregating ₱531,148.77 were charged against the net proceeds of the N-CASE registration fees.  These expenditures are not related to N-CASE activity and with no approved budget. Details are shown in Table 9.

	The fundamental principle in government financial transactions is clear that no government funds shall be disbursed unless there is an approved budget.



	We recommended that Management strictly comply with the provisions of Section 4 of PD No. 1445, Section 22, Article IV of CHED Memorandum Order No. 20 and Sections 2.2 to 2.4 of COA Circular No. 2000-002 April 4, 2000, and ensure that disbursements of government funds are supported with duly approved budget.  



The Chief Administrative Officer commented that they will have to meet with the concerned Office to address the issue.



13)	Several provisions of the 2016 Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (RIRR) of R.A. No. 9184 were not complied with by the CTU Barili Campus. Thus, Management may have been deprived of the assurance that all procurement awards and decisions resulted in the most advantageous prices and terms for the government.



		During the test review of the procurement transactions of CTU Barili for CY 2020, the audit team noted inconsistencies and inconformity with the RIRR of RA 9184 as discussed in the succeeding paragraphs.

		

a)	Procurement of goods for various construction/renovation projects aggregating ₱1.473 million could not be traced to the Annual Procurement Plan (APP) of the Campus contrary to Section 7 of the Revised IRR of RA 9184.



An Annual Procurement Plan is a requisite document that the agency must prepare to reflect the necessary information on the entire procurement activities (i.e., goods, civil works to be procured) that it plans to undertake within the calendar year, such as, name of procurement program/project, end-user unit, general description of the procurement, method to be adopted, timeline of procurement activity, source of fund, and Approved Budget of the Contract (ABC).





Section 7, Rule II of the 2016 revised Implementing Rules and Regulations of Republic Act No. 9184 provides that:



7.1 	All procurement shall be within the approved budget of the procuring entity and should be meticulously and judiciously planned by the procuring entity. Consistent with the government fiscal discipline measures, only those considered crucial to the efficient discharge of governmental functions shall be included in the Annual Procurement Plan (APP). Xxxx…. 



7.2 	No procurement shall be undertaken unless it is in accordance with the approved APP, including approved changes thereto.  The APP must be consistent with the duly approved yearly budget of the Procuring Entity and shall bear the approval of the HOPE or second-ranking official designated by the HOPE to act on his behalf.” (Emphasis Supplied)



Verification of some of the construction projects undertaken by Barili Campus during the year, which mostly pertains to major renovation of its Offices, disclosed that these could not be traced as among the projects, programs and activities in the CY 2020 APP, as follows:

Inquiry with the bookkeeper disclosed that no supplemental APP was prepared and approved during the year. It was also noted that the APP submitted did not contain the signatures of the authorized officials/signatories.

	

Inasmuch as the law mandates that all procurements to be undertaken should be in accordance with the approved APP, by failing to include the subject goods and materials in the APP, there is no assurance that the subject procurements were covered with valid appropriations. Thus, casting doubt on the legality and propriety of the said procurements.



We recommended and Management agreed to comply with the provisions, as stated in Section 7, Rule 2 of the Revised IRR of RA 9184, and ensure that all procurement transactions are included in the APP.

	

b)	Procurement transactions using the Alternative Mode of Procurement with ABC above ₱50,000.00 were not posted in the PhilGEPS website and website of the Cebu Technological University, contrary to Sections 54.2 and 54.3 of the revised IRR of RA 9184, hence, limiting the   competition and transparency of the procurement process.



	Section 54.2 and 54.3, Rule XVI of the Revised IRR of RA 9184 provides: 

	

	“54.2. For alternative methods of procurement, the Procuring Entity may dispense with the advertisement in the newspaper and posting requirement as prescribed in Section 21.2.1 of this IRR.

		

	For the following modalities, however, the BAC, through its Secretariat, shall post the invitation or request for submission of price quotations/proposals in the PhilGEPS website, the website of the Procuring Entity concerned, if available, and at any conspicuous place reserved for this purpose in the premises of the Procuring Entity for a period of at least three (3) calendar days…

	

54.3. In all instances of alternative methods of procurement, the BAC, through the Secretariat, shall post, for information purposes, the notice of award, contract or purchase order, including notice to proceed if necessary, in the PhilGEPS website, the website of the Procuring Entity concerned, if available, and at any conspicuous place reserved for this purpose in the premises of the Procuring Entity, except for contracts with ABC of Fifty Thousand Pesos ( P50,000.00) and below.”



	Examination, on a test basis, of the disbursements disclosed that seven procurement transactions were not supported with proof of posting at the PhilGEPS website or in the agency website. This practice has limited the competition and transparency of the procurement process. Details are presented below:

		Item 9.2 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 prescribed the documentary requirements for all purchases under alternative mode of procurement which include, among others, the following:

	

--		Proof of posting of invitation or request for submission of price quotation in the PhilGEPs website, website of the procuring agency, if available, and at any conspicuous place reserved for this purpose in the premises of the procuring agency for a period of seven calendar days in case of Shopping under Section 52.1(b), and Negotiated Procurement under Section 53.1(two failed bidding) and 53.9 Small Value Procurement of the Revised IRR of RA No. 9184.

	

--		Proof of posting of Notice of Award in the PhilGEPs website, the website of the procuring entity concerned, if available, and at any conspicuous place reserved for this purpose in the premises of the procuring entity.

	

We recommended and Management agreed to comply with the posting requirements of all procurement opportunities as required in Sections 54.2 and 54.3 of Revised IRR of RA 9184 and Item 9.2 of COA Circular No. 2012-001.



c)	The condition was not met in using “Shopping” as the mode of procurement by the Campus.



As a general rule, the procuring entities shall adopt competitive bidding as the general method of procurement. Under Rule XVI of the IRR of R.A. No. 9184, alternative methods of procurement may be resorted in exceptional cases.  In the case of CTU Barili Campus, the modality of procurement transactions adopted was through Shopping, as gleaned from Tables 10 and 11. However, the conditions laid down under Section 52, Rule XVI of the IRR of R.A. No. 9184 were not met in resorting Shopping as the procurement modality. Quoted below are the pertinent provisions in this instance: 



“Section 52. Shopping



52.1.	Shopping is a method of procurement of Goods whereby the Procuring Entity simply requests for the submission of price quotations for readily available off-the-shelf goods or ordinary/regular equipment to be procured directly from suppliers of known qualifications. This method of procurement shall be employed in any of the following cases:



a)	When there is an unforeseen contingency requiring immediate purchase: Provided, however, That the amount shall not exceed the thresholds prescribed in Annex “H” of this IRR.



b)	 Procurement of ordinary or regular office supplies and equipment not available in the Procurement Service involving an amount not exceeding the thresholds prescribed in Annex “H” of this IRR.”



Verification revealed that the condition in adopting “Shopping” as the alternative mode of procurement was not met as the procurements pertained to construction/repairs of the different offices of the Campus, hence, not considered as ordinary or regular office supplies.  



	We recommended and Management agreed to require the Bids and Awards Committee to adopt the appropriate alternative methods of procurement pursuant to Rule XVI of the Revised IRR of R.A. 9184.



d)	Brand names were indicated in the Purchase Requests (PR), Detailed Estimates/Bill of Quantities and Request for Quotations (RFQs) on the procurement of one unit refrigerator and constructions materials, contrary to Section 18 of the 2016 Revised IRR of the RA 9184. This practice also limits competition, which may result in the procurement of goods at a higher price but with almost the same quality/performance as that of other brands.



Section 18 of the revised IRR of RA 9184 clearly states: “Specifications for the procurement of goods shall be based on relevant characteristics and/or performance requirements. Reference to brand names shall not be allowed.” (Emphasis Supplied)



Verification of the sampled procurement transactions disclosed that the brand names were indicated in the PR, Detailed Estimates/Bill of Quantities as well as in the RFQs.  This practice is not in keeping with the requirement of Section 18 of the 2016 RIRR of RA 9184. It likewise limits competition that may result in procurement of goods at a higher price but with almost the same quality/performance as that of other brands.

We recommended and Management agreed to refrain from specifying brand names in the Purchase Requests and require the procurement unit including the Bids and Awards Committee to strictly observe the requirement of Section 18 of the 2016 Revised IRR of RA 9184. 



14)	The validity and propriety of the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) and Commission on Higher Education (CHED) funded projects for CY 2020 cannot be ascertained due to: (a) non-submission of three disbursement vouchers (DVs) totaling ₱0.468 million; and (b) non-recording of one financial transaction amounting to ₱9,804.00.



In CY 2020, the administration of funds pertaining to research projects funded from DOST and CHED was transferred to the Office of the Vice President-Research and Development (VPRD). As such, a Bookkeeper was designated to handle its books of accounts. Verification of the financial transactions during the year disclosed that:



a)	Three Disbursement Vouchers and their supporting documents were not submitted contrary to Section 4 of PD No. 1445, thus, validity and correctness of the financial transactions could not be ascertained.



Section 4 of PD No. 1445 sets the fundamental principles of financial transactions and operations of any government agency. Sections 4 (5) to 4 (7) are quoted, as follows: 



“5. Disbursements or disposition of government funds or property shall invariably bear the approval of the proper officials. 



6.  Claims against government funds shall be supported with complete documentation. 



7.  All laws and regulations applicable to financial transactions shall   be faithfully adhered to.”



 	Review of the financial transactions on the external grants received by the Main Campus for CY 2020 revealed that there were three disbursement vouchers and its supporting documents not submitted to the Audit Team, which was the subject of AOM No. 21-009-164(20) dated April 15, 2021. These DVs are as follows:

	The non-submission of these three DVs and their complete supporting documents hindered the Audit Team in ascertaining whether the said financial transactions are valid and proper.



	We recommended that Management instruct the designated Bookkeeper to exert effort in locating the three duly approved disbursement vouchers and their complete supporting documents to comply with the requirement of Section 4 of PD No. 1445 and submit these documents to the Audit Team for review/audit.

	

The Bookkeeper acknowledged that the original copies of the DVs and supporting documents of Medical Test Systems, Inc. and Noveaulab Asia Corp. cannot be found and they are trying to reconstruct the documents by communicating with the suppliers.  The DV of Gianne Eduard L. Ulanday will be submitted once the check is released by the Cashier.



b)	DV amounting to ₱9,804.00 was not recorded in the books.



Further verification of the Report of Checks Issued and Check Disbursement Journals disclosed that the DV pertaining to the claim for wages by Claire Antonnete G. Pomarejos amounting ₱9,804.00, from August 3-14, 2020, per DV No. 20-08-230 and Check No. 1345729 dated September 8, 2020 was not recorded in the books, thus understating the expenses for the year.  



	We recommended and Management agreed instruct the Bookkeeper to prepare a JEV to record the financial transaction amounting to ₱9,804.00 in the books by debiting Accumulated Surplus/Deficit account and crediting Cash in Bank, Local Currency Current Account by the same amount.



15)	Payments for various procurements totaling ₱0.453 million were made through reimbursement basis to the Campus’ personnel, instead of issuing checks directly payable to the creditors. Also, the disbursements were not subjected to the applicable withholding tax, thus depriving the government of assurance on tax collection.



Section 93 of P.D. 1445 states:



“Section 93. To whom warrants or checks payable. Warrants chargeable to revenue or trust funds of the national government or checks drawn against the treasury Checking Account for Agencies maintained with any government depository shall be made payable either directly to the creditor to whom the money is due or to a disbursing officer for official disbursement.”



	Post audit, on a test basis, of the disbursements for CY 2020 disclosed that the payments for the purchase of construction materials and office equipment were made on reimbursement basis to the Campus’ personnel, which is not in accordance with the above-quoted law. These transactions are shown in Table 13.

	Moreover, the sampled transactions in Table 13 were not subjected to the withholding of Value-added tax (VAT), notwithstanding the requirement under Section 114 (c) of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) of the Philippines, which provides that:



“The government or any of its political subdivisions, instrumentalities or agencies, including government-owned or controlled corporations (GOCCs) shall, before making payment on account of each purchase of goods and services which are subject to the value-added tax imposed in Section 106 and 108 of the Code, deduct and withhold the value-added tax due at the rate of five percent (5%) of the gross payment thereof. xxx”



	Considering that the payments were made on reimbursement basis, the corresponding tax of the subject procurement transactions were not withheld upon payment, thus the government is deprived of the assurance on tax collections for the said transactions.



We recommended and Management agreed to:



i)	stop the practice of making payments on various procurements through reimbursement basis to officials and employees and adhere with the existing law and regulation, which requires that the checks drawn be made payable directly to the creditor. 



ii)	 Ensure that all transactions subject to withholding tax are appropriately deducted/withheld with the applicable tax to avoid the sanction under Section 251 of the NIRC, as quoted:



“Sec. 251. Failure of a Withholding Agent to Collect and Remit Tax. - Any person required to withhold, account for, and remit any tax imposed by this Code or who willfully fails to withhold such tax, or account for and remit such tax, or aids or abets in any manner to evade any such tax or the payment thereof, shall, in addition to other penalties provided for under this Chapter, be liable upon conviction to a penalty equal to the total amount of the tax not withheld, or not accounted for and remitted.”



16)	The management of CTU Argao Campus did not enforce collection from its Campus personnel the receivables aggregating ₱0.346 million for the IGP products sold on account. Such circumstance not only contravenes with the provision of Section 2, P. D. No. 1445 but may also defeat the objective of the project, which is to augment the resources/income of the Campus.



Section 2 of P. D. No. 1445, also known as the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines specified the responsibilities of agency officials, to wit:



Section 2.  “Declaration of Policy. -  It is the declared policy of the State that all resources of the government shall be managed, expended or utilized in accordance with law and regulations, and safeguarded against loss or wastage through illegal or improper disposition, with a view of ensuring efficiency, economy and effectiveness in the operations of government.  The responsibility to take care that such policy is faithfully adhered to rest directly with the chief or head of the government agency concerned.” (Emphasis/Underscoring Supplied)



		Republic Act No. 8292 or the “Higher Education Modernization Act of 1997” specifically provides the power and duties of Governing Boards, as follows:

		

		  Section 4 (d) of said Act provides: “(d) to fix the tuition fees and other necessary school charges, such as but not limited to matriculation fees, graduation fees and laboratory fees, as their respective boards may deem proper to improve after due consultation with the involved sectors.

		

		Such fees and charges, including government subsidies and other income generated by the university or college, shall constitute special trust funds and shall be deposited in any authorized government depository bank and all interests shall accrue therefrom shall part of the same fund for the use of the university or college. Provided, That income derived from university hospitals shall be exclusively earmarked for the operating expenses of the hospitals.

		

		Any provision of existing laws, rules and regulations to the contrary notwithstanding, any income generated by the university or college from tuition fees and other charges, as well as from the operation of auxiliary services and land grants, shall be retained by the university or college and may be disbursed by the Board of Regents/Trustees for instruction, research, extension, or other programs/projects of the university or college. Provided, That all fiduciary fees shall be disbursed for the specific purposes for which they are collected.” (emphasis supplied)



Based on the quoted provisions, IGPs were undertaken by the management of CTU Argao Campus in order to generate additional revenue.  



Review of the schedule on the Status of Other Receivables as at December 31, 2020 revealed that there are receivables from its officers and employees pertaining to the sale on account of the products sold from the Campus’ income generating projects such as cafeteria, poultry, rice, etc. Said receivables have been long outstanding and non-moving for over three years.



	It was learned from the Accountant that these receivables existed prior to her assumption of Office and she has no information on the terms and condition of the sale on account to its Campus personnel. Also, there was no demand initiated by the Campus to collect the corresponding amount due from its officers and employees. Summary of the Other Receivables as at December 31, 2020 are as follows:

		Failure of management to collect the receivables from its employees is grossly disadvantageous to the Campus.  Also, the absence of policies, guidelines and controls in the operations of the IGP may result in the non-attainment of its objective, which is to augment the resources/income of the Campus.



We recommended and Management agreed to enforce an efficient collection strategy and institute appropriate action against delinquent Campus personnel.  



17)	The payments of salaries totaling ₱0.192 million to workers engaged as laborers of various infrastructure projects of CTU-Barili Campus were not supported with Job Order Contracts and Pakyaw Labor Contract contrary to the provisions of CSC-COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 1, series 2017 dated June 15, 2017, Item 4, Appendix 1 of the RIRR of RA 9184 and Section 4 of Presidential Decree No. 1445thus, the validity of the claims could not be ascertained.



On payment of salaries of laborers without Job Order contracts totaling ₱122,583.38



CSC-COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 1, series 2017 dated June 15, 2017 was issued to prescribe the rules and regulations governing Contract of Service and Job Order workers in the government. Item 5.4 thereof defines Job Order.



5.4  Job Order refers to piece work (pakyaw) or intermittent or emergency jobs such as clearing of debris on the roads, canals, waterways, etc. after natural/man-made disasters/occurrences and other manual/trades and crafts services such as carpentry, plumbing, electrical and the like.  These jobs are of short duration and for a specific piece of work.



Item 6.3 of the same Joint Circular enumerates the conditions in hiring job order workers, as follows: 



6.3.1 The service of a job order worker is either paid according to an agreed contract amount for the piece of work or on a daily wage basis.



6.3.2 Contracting the services of job order workers shall be subject to pertinent budgeting, accounting and auditing rules and regulations.



In addition, the fundamental principles on the financial transactions and operations of any government agency are enumerated in Section 4 of PD 1445. 



Cash advances were drawn by the Disbursing Officer for the wages of individual workers hired as emergency laborers assigned at maintenance area for the various renovation projects in the Campus. Verification of the liquidation reports revealed that these were not supported with job order contracts. Details of the disbursement are as follows:

As can be gleaned from Table 15, the Letter Orders were used as one of the bases in the payment of salaries of the hired job order workers. These letter orders, which were approved by the Campus Director, specified the date issued, names of workers, job description stated in general terms, number of days worked, rate per day and total amount due.  



Examination of the contents of the letter orders would make us conclude that these were issued only after the work has been done. It even included the total number of days worked as well as the computation of the salaries of the workers on the dates specified.  Moreover, we could not validate if the works to be done have already been accomplished considering that the scope of work was not clearly specified and the job description in the letter orders were stated in general terms.  This is also true with   the inspection reports since it did not specify the scope of work and the percentage of work accomplishment.  



In the absence of a Job Order contract, which could have specified the agreed piece of work to be done on a daily wage basis, and the other noted deficiencies, the validity of the disbursement of funds totaling ₱122,583.38 could not be ascertained.  



On payment of labor for the Renovation of Executive House undertaken by administration through Pakyaw Contracting System without Pakyaw Labor Contract  



As defined in Item 2.6 of Appendix 1 of the Revised IRR of RA 9184, Pakyaw refers to a system of hiring a labor group for the performance of a specific work and/or service incidental to the implementation of an infrastructure project by administration whereby tools and materials are furnished by the implementing agency. For the specific work/service output, a lump-sum payment is made through the group leader or divided among the pakyaw workers and disbursed using a payroll system.



Item 4 of Appendix 1 of the same IRR prescribed the guidelines for the implementation of infrastructure projects by administration through Pakyaw Contracting System as follows:



4.0  Pakyaw Conracting System



4.2 The formation of Pakyaw Groups should actively involve the Barangay leaders and the community. A Project Facilitator (PF) shall be appointed by the implementing agency to assist in the organization of the Pakyaw Groups and in the preparation of the Pakyaw Contracts. . . x  x  x .  .  .



4.6 A group Leader shall be elected from among the members of the group who shall be the signatory to the Pakyaw Contract and any other documents pertaining to the work on behalf of the Pakyaw Group.   .  .  . x   x   x  .  .  .



	It can be gleaned from the highlighted row of Table 15 that portion of the payment to emergency laborers consist of salaries paid through Pakyaw in the amount of ₱69,600.00. However, verification of the documents disclosed that it was not supported with a Pakyaw Labor Contract. Instead, a Letter Order No. 20-08-27 dated August 20, 2020 was prepared stating the amount due through “Ronnel Carreon et al” who appears to be the leader of the Pakyaw group for the work done from August 3 to 17, 2020. The scope of work and its duration were not specified. On the other hand, the accomplished inspection reports cannot also be validated since it did not specify the scope of work and the percentage of work done.  



In view of the noted deficiencies, the payment of salaries amounting to ₱69,600.00 to the Pakyaw group is contrary to existing rules and regulation on the disbursement of funds.  



We recommended and Management agreed to submit the required Job order contracts and Pakyaw labor contract to the Audit Team for further evaluation. Henceforth, comply with the fundamental principles of financial transactions in the government as prescribed under Section 4 of PD 1445 and the provisions of CSC-COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 1 series 2017 and the guidelines stated in Appendix 1 of the Revised IRR of RA 9184.



We also recommended that Management ensure that adequate documentations are attached to the disbursement vouchers to preclude suspension or disallowance in audit.



18)	Unliquidated Cash Advances of CTU Main Campus totaling ₱0.125 million as at December 31, 2020 were considered dormant pursuant to Item 6.1 of COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016.



Item 5.5 of COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016 defined Dormant Unliquidated Cash Advances as follows:



5.5 Dormant Unliquidated Cash Advances - advances granted to disbursing officers, agency officers and employees which remained non-moving for ten (10) years or more and where settlement/collectability could no longer be ascertained.



Item 6.1 of COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016 states that:



	6.1 All government entities shall conduct regular monitoring and analysis of receivable accounts to ensure that these are collected when these become due and demandable and that cash advances and fund transfers are liquidated within the prescribed period depending upon their nature and purpose.

	

Review of the Schedule on the Status of Unliquidated Cash Advances as of December 31, 2020 disclosed that several of these receivables has been long outstanding and considered dormant. Details of the Status of Unliquidated Cash Advances as of December 31, 2020 are as follows:

It can be gleaned from the above table that the collectability of ₱125,679.00 or 16.21 percent of the total unliquidated cash advances as of December 31, 2020 is considered doubtful since these officers and employees are no longer connected to the agency.



We recommended and Management agreed to evaluate the dormant unliquidated cash advances and initiate appropriate legal actions to recover the amount from officials and employees who were already separated from the service. Otherwise, consider requesting for authority from the Commission on Audit to write-off the dormant receivables that are deemed uncollectible, after all remedies have been exhausted.



19)	Cash advances for payroll, drawn by the Cashier of CTU Main Campus in the Special Trust Fund, were not liquidated within the prescribed period contrary to the provisions of Section 5.1 of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 and Section 15 of Chapter 6 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume I, thereby exposing such funds to the risk of theft and or robbery.

 

		Section 5.1. of COA Circular No. 97-002 specifically states the following:

	

		5.1	The AO shall liquidate his cash advance as follows:

	

5.1.1 Salaries, Wages, etc. – within five (5) days after each fifteen (15) day/end of the month pay period.



	Moreover, Section 15 of Chapter 6 of the GAM, Volume I described and prescribed the guidelines on Cash Advance for Payroll, quoted as follows:



“Section 15. Cash Advance for Payroll. Advances for Payroll shall be granted to Regular Disbursing Officers for payment of salaries, wages, honoraria, allowances and other personnel benefits of officials and employees. The Advances for Payroll shall not be used for encashment of checks or for liquidation of previous or other types of cash advances. It shall be equal to the net amount of the processed payroll corresponding to the pay period. Liquidation of the advances shall be made within in five (5) days after end of the pay period. Any unclaimed salaries/allowances shall be refunded and issued official receipt to close the account. (Emphasis Supplied)



	Examination of the cash and accounts of Mr. Irwin P. Allego, Cashier/Disbursing Officer of CTU Main Campus, revealed that several cash advances for payroll were not liquidated within the prescribed period or within five days after the end of the pay period. Details of the cash advances are shown in Annex E. 

	

As can be gleaned from Annex E, liquidations and refunds of unreleased funds from the cash advances drawn in the name of the Cashier, which pertained to the payment of wages for student labor, janitorial services and scholarship grants, were delayed by 10-119 days.  It is emphasized that cash advances are deemed fully liquidated only upon the return of excess cash advance in the campus’ account. Failure of the accountable officer to return the unclaimed portion of several payrolls within the prescribed period is not consistent with the provisions laid down under Section 5.1.1 of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997, thereby exposing such funds to the risk of loss or misappropriation. 



We recommended that Management instruct the Cashier/Disbursing Officer to liquidate cash advances for payroll within the prescribed period under Sections 5.1.1 of COA Circular No. 97-002 and Section 15 of the Government Accounting Manual by preparing and submitting the Report of Cash Disbursements to the Accounting Office and make the appropriate refund for the unclaimed portion of the payrolls, if any.



	Management commented that they are considering to require the students to open a bank account so that any benefits due them will be directly credited to their individual accounts.  This way, the cash advances of the Cashier could be minimized.



20)	Additional cash advances were granted to the Cashier of CTU Main Campus even if the previous cash advances were not settled/liquidated contrary to the instructions under Section 4.1.2 of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997.



	Section 4.1.2 of COA Circular No. 97-002 provides the following:



	“No additional cash advances shall be allowed to any official or employee unless the previous cash advance given to him is first settled or a proper accounting thereof is made (Section 4.1.2).”



	With reference to Annex E, the remaining cash for the unclaimed payroll which were still in the custody of the Cashier/ Disbursing Officer in the given period is a manifestation that there were Cash Advances which were not fully settled or liquidated prior to the grant of additional cash advances. 



The Cashier explained that the lag in the distribution of stipends to student beneficiaries was due to the delay of the students in claiming their benefits and the difficulty in getting in touch with them.



 This practice of granting additional cash advances without first requiring the liquidation/settlement of the previous cash advances is contrary to the provision of Section 4.1.2 of COA Circular No. 97-002.  



We recommended and Management agreed stop the practice of granting additional cash advances to its officials and employees who still have unsettled/unliquidated cash advance/s in accordance with Section 4.1.2 of the same Circular.  We also recommended to consider other appropriate methods in paying the stipends directly to the student grantees.



21)	The Inspection Report by the COA-RegionalTechnical Services Office (RTSO) noted a variance of ₱64,398.00 or approximately 0.66 percent below the reported 100 percent work accomplishment of the Project, Construction of 2-Storey, 4 Classroom Building at CTU Bantayan Island, Cebu. Said occurrence was due to the difference in length of the ramp per ocular inspection and the As-Built plan.



	On December 16, 2020, two personnel from the COA-RTS Office conducted an ocular inspection on the reported 100 percent work accomplishment of the project, Construction of 2-Storey, 4 Classroom Building at CTU Bantayan Island, Cebu, with total contract cost of ₱9,689,488.00. The objectives of the inspection were to verify the existence of the project, validate the 100 percent reported work accomplishment and to determine whether said project is in accordance with its approved plans and specifications. The inspection of the technical team was limited only to the physical/visible portions and existence of the project. The cemented and other items which can no longer be verified is implied to be in accordance with the specifications stipulated in the approved plans during the execution of the project.



	Per inspection of the COA RTSO team, the project was found to be only around 99 percent accomplished and not 100 percent as reported in the agency’s Statement of Work Accomplishment dated February 8, 2019. The report specified that the length of the ramp was measured to be 4.20 meters in length compared to the 7.00 meters length as reflected in the As-Built Plan.  The shortage of 2.80 meters caused the variance with equivalent amount of ₱64,398.00.



Shown in the table below are the items with noted variance based on the COA-RTSO Inspection Report dated February 16, 2021.

	Accordingly, the variance noted on the project accomplishment has placed the government at a disadvantage as full payment was already made albeit non-compliance with the approved plans and drawings by the Contractor.



We recommended that Management instruct the concerned personnel to explain the shortage in the length of the ramp as noted by the COA-RTSO during the inspection and as per the As-Built plan of the said project. Otherwise, require the contractor to return the sum of ₱64,398.00.



Management commented that they will require the contractor to return equivalent amount of the variance as noted by the COA RTS Office.



COVID-19 Audit



22)	The procurement of supplies and materials aggregating ₱1.116 million were charged against the DOST Region 7 funded projects in response to the COVID-19 health emergency crisis contrary to the standards set forth in the Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB) Circular No. 01-2020 dated April 6, 2020, thus, the regularity of the disbursements could not be ascertained.

***Per certified report on the status of utilization on the development of handrubs, there includes an item pertaining to reimbursement of expenses of Dr. Adrian Ybanez amounting ₱106,834.00 which was not included in the audited  summary of expenditures since this could not be traced to the Report of Checks Issued and Check Disbursement Journal and bank statements. As of reporting date, the required DVs, supporting documents and check no. were not yet submitted, for verification.

	

		With the enactment of R.A. No. 11469 otherwise known as the “Bayanihan to Heal as One Act” or the “Bayanihan Act”, guidelines were crafted to exempt the conduct of certain procurement activities from the requirements of R.A. No. 9184.  Thus, GPPB Circular No. 01-2020 was formulated to guide the Procuring Entities (PEs) in the conduct of emergency procurement to mitigate, if not contain, the transmission of COVID-19 disease. 



In the verification of the disbursements pertaining to the aforesaid projects, the following deficiencies were noted:



a)	The technical specifications of the supplies and materials needed in the development of PPE’s, handrubs, and disinfectant gels were not specified as required under Item 3.1 of the GPPB Circular 01-2020 dated April 6, 2020. Moreover,  the quantities of expected outputs were not indicated in the Memoranda of Agreement (MOA) and in the line-item budgets. 



GPPB Circular 01-2020 dated April 6, 2020 prescribes the guidelines for emergency procurement under R.A. No. 11469 or the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act. Item 3.1 thereof instructs that the Procuring Entity (PE) shall prepare the project requirement, with the following details:



1)	Project Name;

2)	Approved Budget for the Contract;

3)	Technical Specifications, Scope of Work, or Terms of Reference;

4)	Date of Delivery or implementation;

5)	Required quantity; and

6)	Other relevant information that the PE may require. 



Review of the MOA for the two projects disclosed that it is only on the project for development of PPEs wherein the quantity of expected outputs on the production of PPEs was indicated, as follows:



	Kind of PPE

Expected Outputs

Faceshield

At least 500

Facemask

At least 5,000

Apron

At least 500

Arm cover

At least 500

Leg cover

At least 500

Isolation/cover gown

At least 100

	

Other details of the project were not specified, which is contrary to the requirement of GPPB Circular 01-2020, summarized hereunder:



1)	Detailed specifications and quantity of the supplies and materials to be used in the production of face shield, facemask, apron, arm cover, leg cover, isolation/ cover gown, and the supplies and materials for the development of handrubs and disinfectant gel.



2)	Expected quantity on the production of handrubs and disinfectant gel.



3)	Concrete timeline for the production of PPEs, handrubs and disinfectant gel and its distribution to intended beneficiaries.



Failure to comply with the details of the project requirements did not provide reasonable assurance on the necessity of the procured supplies and materials and whether the expected output on the production of PPEs, handrubs and disinfectant gel were accomplished.



We recommended that Management ensure that a detailed cost estimate of supplies and materials as well as the expected outputs be clearly quantified in the preparation of the budget for a certain project.



As of this writing, Management did not provide the Audit Team with their comment on this observation. The project proponent was also not present during the conduct of the exit conference.



b)	 The requirements and procedures prescribed in GPPB Circular 01-2020 on the procurement of goods covered under the Bayanihan Act were not complied with, thus, the transparency in procurement could not be ascertained and there is no assurance that the purchased items were the most advantageous to the government.

	

		Verification of the procurement of supplies and materials pertaining to the development of PPEs, handrubs, and disinfectant gels from April to June 2020 revealed that the documentary requirements prescribed under GPPB Circular 01-2020 were not complied with, as follows:

	

	b.1 	The procurement of goods were not validated by the Budget Officer nor it was included in the agency’s Annual Procurement Plan contrary to Item 3.2 of the said GPPB Circular which states: 

	

	1)		Once the budget for the Procurement Project has been validated by the budget officer or equivalent position, the Procurement Project shall be included in the Annual Procurement Plan (APP) approved by the head of the procuring entity (HoPE) or his or her delegate.  The HoPE is encouraged to delegate his/her authority and responsibility to efficiently and expeditiously deal with the emergency sought to be addressed under the RA No. 11469.

	

	The procurement modality to be reflected in the APP for procurements to be undertaken under this Circular shall be Emergency Procurement under the Bayanihan Act.

	

	However, in view of the urgent necessity of the procurement covered under the Bayanihan Act, the PE may commence with the procurement even without an approved APP, provided there is a document or certification from the budget officer or equivalent position, showing that there is a budget for the purpose.  The APP shall be approved thereafter and posted on the PE’s website and submitted to the GPPB or posted on the GPPB online portal for Emergency Procurement under the Bayanihan Act, once operational, on or before 30 September 2020.”

	

		It was noted that the procurement transactions were not supported with Budget Utilization Request and Status (BURS), an accounting form used in the utilization of approved budget allocations for off budgetary and custodial funds such as internally generated funds, business related funds and trust funds.  There was no proof that the supplies and materials purchased were indicated in the revised APP or any supporting documents validating that funds were available for this emergency procurement. Also, there was no evidence that it was posted in agency’s website and on the GPPB online portal for Emergency Procurement as instructed under the Bayanihan Act.  

			

	b.2  The documentary requirement as prescribed in Item 4.1 of GPPB Circular No. 01-2020 for the procurement of highly needed supplies and materials authorized under RA 11469 were not complied with.  Thus, there is no assurance that the suppliers are technically and legally capable to enter into contract with the government.

	 

		Item 4.1 of GPPB Circular No. 01-2020 prescribes for the documentary requirements that Management shall require on procurement of highly needed supplies and materials authorized under RA 11469 or the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act, which states:

	

	4.1 PEs already maintaining a bidder’s updated file of any of the following requirements, whether through the Philippine Government Electronic Procurement System Certificate of Registration and Membership or its own records, shall not require its re-submission.

	

		Otherwise, PEs shall require copies of:

	

a)		Mayor’s or Business Permit

	

	Review of the disbursements pertaining to the procurement of supplies and materials for the development of PPEs, handrubs and disinfectant gel by the University from April to June 2020 disclosed that the requirements specified in Item 4.1 were not among the documents attached in the Disbursement Vouchers supporting the reimbursement of expenses. It was likewise noted that Management directly purchased the goods pertaining to the development of PPEs, handrubs and disinfectant gel to supermarkets, groceries, textile store, convenience store and other stores on a piecemeal basis and as the need arises. This is because there was no detailed specifications and quantity of the supplies and materials to be used in the production of the aforementioned PPEs. The supporting documents were only the receipts and the Purchase Requests (PRs). With regard to the PRs, it is obvious that these were only prepared after the goods were purchased since it was observed that the order of items/prices as reflected in the receipts were also the same order of items/prices as reflected in the PRs.  

	

		Without the documentary requirements prescribed under the Bayanihan Act, there is no assurance that the suppliers were technically and legally capable to enter into contract with the government.



	b.3  Management did not comply with the posting requirement of the Notice of Award or Purchase Order for procurement transactions under the Emergency Procurement contrary to Item 3.6 of GPPB Circular No. 01-2020. Thus, the principle of transparency in government procurement was not completely adhered to.

	

		Considering that there was no Notice of Award and/or Purchase Order executed as required under Item no. 3.6 of the same GPPB Circular, the posting requirement in the website of the PE or any conspicuous place in the premises of the PE and the GPPB online portal for Emergency Procurement was not complied with.

	

		For reference, quoted is Item 3.6:

	

	3.6  The BAC, through the Secretariat, shall post for information purposes the Notice of Award (NOA), contract, or purchase order in  (i) the website of the PE or if none, any conspicuous place in the premises of the PE; and (ii) the GPPB online portal for Emergency Procurement under the Bayanihan Act, once it becomes operational.

	

		The non-compliance with the posting requirement of the Notice of Award or Purchase Order does not provide reasonable assurance that the principle of transparency is completely adhered to.



We recommended and Management agreed to ensure that all the documentary requirements prescribed under the existing procurement law and its related GPPB issuances are complied with.  Also, we recommended that Management observe the posting requirement of the Notice of Award, contract, or Purchase order as provided under Item 3.6 of GPPB Circular 01-2020.



b)	There was no summary of the quantities of PPE’s, handrubs, and disinfectant gels produced, and also no  proofs of receipt by the intended beneficiaries, resulting in the difficulty of establishing accountability of the procured items, and in determining whether the objective of the projects  was fully achieved.



To reiterate, the DOST funds aggregating ₱1.565 million was downloaded to the account of CTU for development of PPEs to be used by the health personnel/frontliners in this time of COVID-19 crisis.  This is specifically for the mass production of face shield, face mask, arm cover, leg cover apron, isolation gown/cover gown and formulation of non-alcohol based handrubs and disinfectant gel.



In determining whether the production of said PPE’s were properly implemented, it is necessary that a summary report on the quantity of each type of PPE items produced, as well as the proofs that these were given/delivered to its intended beneficiaries be prepared.  Said summary report would aid in determining whether the objective of the project was fully achieved.



We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Project Team to prepare a summary report on the quantity of each type of PPE items produced and their corresponding beneficiaries duly supported with complete documentation, and to submit the same to the Audit Team, for verification/audit.



23)	The inclusion of the procurement of laptop amounting ₱90,000.00 in the line-item budget for the Development of PPEs is considered unnecessary as defined under Item 4.1 of COA Circular No.  2012-003 dated October 29, 2012.



It was observed that a laptop with a budget of ₱90,000.00 was among the items to be procured as this will be used in designing the PPE’s. In the schedule of activities, this was supposed to be done in the first month of implementation of the project. However, examination of the expenditures pertaining to the project showed no procurement of the said equipment. 



It was learned from the Bookkeeper that the procurement of said item is still in process and was not yet delivered as of this writing. Hence, this Office finds the inclusion of such item in the budget as unnecessary as it no longer addresses the purpose for which it was procured.  Unnecessary expenditures as defined in COA Circular No. 2012-003, is hereby quoted:



“The term pertains to expenditures which could not pass the test of prudence or the diligence of a good father of a family, thereby denoting non-responsiveness to the exigencies of the service.  Unnecessary expenditures are those not supportive of the implementation of the objectives and mission of the agency relative to the nature of its operation.  This would also include incurrence of expenditure not dictated by the demands of good government, and those the utility of which cannot be ascertained at a specific time.  An expenditure that is not essential or that which can be dispensed with without loss or damage to property is considered unnecessary.  The mission and thrusts of the agency incurring the expenditures must be considered in determining whether or not an expenditure is necessary.”



It appears that the procurement of laptop is not actually essential in the said project considering that there are already computers/laptops available in the University which can be used in designing the PPEs, if needed.  In fact, the production of PPEs was already carried out even in the absence of said IT equipment.  



We recommended that Management explain fully the inclusion in the budget on the purchase of a laptop, notwithstanding the availability of such IT equipment in the University, and the delayed procurement/delivery thereof.



Also, we recommended that Management exercise prudence in the formulation of budget for a certain project and refrain from inserting in the budget any unnecessary item/equipment. 



As of this writing, Management did not provide the Audit Team with their comment on this observation. The project proponent was also not present during the conduct of the exit conference.



24)	The expenditures for meals and snacks totaling ₱22,540.60 incurred by the Office of the Vice President for Research and Development (VPRD) during the development of PPEs are not in conformity with the adoption of austerity measures directed under Administrative Order No. 6 dated September 19, 2017 and National Budget Circular (NBC) No. 580 dated April 22, 2020, thus, deemed unnecessary and extravagant as provided under Items 4.1 and 6.1 of COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012.  



	Items 4.1 and 6.1 of COA Circular No. 2012-003 provide the definition of unnecessary and extravagant expenditures, to wit:



“4.1 	The term pertains to expenditures which could not pass the test of prudence or the diligence of a good father of a family, thereby denoting non-responsiveness to the exigencies of the service.  Unnecessary expenditures are those not supportive of the implementation of the objectives and mission of the agency relative to the nature of its operation.  This would also include incurrence of expenditure not dictated by the demands of good government, and those the utility of which cannot be ascertained at a specific time.  An expenditure that is not essential or that which can be dispensed with without loss or damage to property is considered unnecessary.  The mission and thrusts of the agency incurring the expenditures must be considered in determining whether or not an expenditure is necessary.”



6.1	The term “extravagant expenditure” signifies those incurred without restraint, judiciousness and economy.  Extravagant expenditures exceed the bounds of propriety.  These expenditures are immoderate, prodigal, lavish, luxurious, grossly excessive, and injudicious.”



Verification of the disbursements pertaining to the development of PPEs in response to COVID-19 pandemic funded by DOST Regional Office No. VII, disclosed that a total amount of ₱22,540.60 was spent for meals and snacks.  It appears that these were served to the personnel of the VPRD during the animal testing for the development of handrubs as shown in the attendance sheets supporting the claim.  Details are shown in the table.

*Total per DV indicated as supplies and materials amounted to P32,127.33. Examination of the supporting documents, it includes meals and snacks aggregating P15,663.30.

**Total per DV is P215.00, consisting of water amounting to P115.00 and masking tape of P100.00



In reference to the line-item budget of the development of handrubs, the animal testing for safety evaluation is among the activities to be performed on the project.  Thus, the Contracts of Service personnel were issued memorandum to perform said tasks.  As such, these personnel were appropriately remunerated for the services rendered.  With regard to the organic personnel such as the Project Leader and Assistant Project Leaders, aside from the regular salaries and allowances received, they were also receiving honoraria on the said projects. Hence, the meals and snacks of the concerned personnel while doing the animal testing should be at their personal account.  



Further examination on the receipts of the meals which were purchased either from McDonalds, Jollibee, Bonchon and Mang Inasal revealed that the adoption of austerity measures in spending the scarce government funds were not observed, resulting in unnecessary and extravagant expenditures.  A clear example is that the regular orders of meals included add-ons and/or upgrades on the items purchased such as:  medium/large orders of French fries, drinks were upgraded to medium/large pineapple juice, soda, iced coffee milky with choco, coke float, monster coke float, chocolate sundae twirl and others.  Aside from the meals which is presumably for lunch, there were also orders of burgers, waffle with blueberry and Hokkaido milk tea.  Said orders were delivered at Sikatuna Street, Cebu City while the meals ordered on September 3, 2020 was specifically delivered at Ence Pension House in Sikatuna Street.



From the foregoing observations, it is clear that the adoption of austerity measures directed under AO No. 6 was not complied with.  Pertinent provision is quoted below:



“Section 1. Notwithstanding the repeal of AO No. 103, existing laws, rules and regulations mandating the judicious and prudent use of government funds shall remain in full force and effect, and all agencies and instrumentalities shall continue to ensure that no irregular, unnecessary, extravagant, excessive and unconscionable expenses shall be incurred by the Government.”



	With the current emergency health situation in our country, NBC 580 was formulated which emphasized fiscal prudence in the utilization of scarce government funds, to wit:



“Item 1.2  While the said law identified funding sources to carry out such emergency measures given the duration and scale of the COVID-19 pandemic, adequate and readily available funds must be provided in a sustainable and responsible manner to respond to this national health emergency for reasons of fiscal prudence.” (Emphasis supplied)



With the aforecited provisions of rules/law and the observations noted, it is deemed that meals and snacks of the VPRD personnel during the animal testing for the development of handrubs charged against the government funds are unnecessary and extravagant.



We recommended and Management agreed to stop the practice of charging expenses that are personal in nature, such as the meals and snacks, against the government funds and ensure that it is utilized only for expenses, which are regular and necessary.



We also recommended that Management be judicious and prudent in utilizing the scarce government funds especially during this time of pandemic.



Gender and Development



25)	The GAD Focal Point System for CTU was already created/established through BOR Resolution No. 237 series of 2020 to comply with the requirement of Section 36 (b) of R.A. No. 9710 or the Magna Carta of Women.



	Section 36 (b) of R.A. 9710 or the Magna Carta of Women, states:



(b) Creation and/or Strengthening of the GAD Focal Points (GFP). All departments, including their attached agencies, offices, bureaus, states universities and colleges, government-owned and –controlled corporations, local government units, and other government instrumentalities shall establish or strengthen their GAD Focal Point System or similar GAD mechanism to catalyze and accelerate gender mainstreaming within the agency or local government unit”



	One of the essential elements in GAD Planning and Budgeting is the creation and/or strengthening of the GAD Focal Point System (GFPS).  Its creation/establishment is necessary to ensure that agencies have institutionalized a functional GFPS. In compliance with the above-quoted law, BOR Resolution No. 237 series of 2020, a “Resolution approving the creation of the CTU GAD Focal Point System and defining the functions of each component” was approved by the University’s Board of Regents during their virtual meeting on August 5, 2020.

	

We commended the efforts of the University Director for CTU Gender and Development in initiating the creation of GFPS which was duly approved by the University’s Board of Regents.



26)	The gender issues identified in the CY 2020 GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) with a total appropriation of ₱37.130 million were not drawn from the result of gender audit, gender statistics or sex disaggregated data. Hence, the programs and activities in the GPB may not properly identify and address the gender-related issues existing in the University.  This condition is not consistent with the provisions in Item 4.0 of PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01.



	           PCW-NEDA-DBM JC No. 2012-01 sets the guidelines in the preparation and submission of Annual GPB and Accomplishment Reports (AR) to implement the Magna Carta of Women. It enumerates the essential elements in GAD planning and budgeting to enable agencies for a more effective plan and implementation of their programs on GAD. 

		 

4.0 	 Essential Elements in GAD Planning and Budgeting 



4.3  Conduct of Gender Audit: Gender audit is an examination of the agency’s level of gender mainstreaming or extent of the gender responsiveness of its policies, programs and projects, the level of gender awareness and competence of its personnel and the presence or absence of enabling mechanisms that support gender mainstreaming. The result of the gender audit could be a basis of capacity development programs that must be implemented and in enhancing the gender-responsiveness of agency policies and PAPs



4.4 	Institutionalizing GAD Database/Sex-disaggregated Data: The agency shall develop or integrate in its existing database GAD information to include gender statistics and sex-disaggregated data that have been systematically produced or gathered as inputs or bases for planning, budgeting, programming, and policy formulation.



	Inquiry with the University Director for CTU Gender and Development revealed that the formulation of the GPB for CY 2020 with an appropriation of ₱37,130,000.00 was not based on the GAD database, which means that there was no gender audit, gender statistics or sex-disaggregated data.  This is also evident in the University’s GPB wherein among the activities that were specified therein was the development of sex-disaggregated data management system. However, due to the restrictions during COVID-19 pandemic, the development of said activity was not implemented.



It is emphasized that the review and analysis of GAD database is essential in GAD planning, in order to develop policies, programs and activities that will address the gender-related issue. Thus, in the absence of GAD database in the University, the programs and activities identified may not properly identify and address existing gender-related issues.



	We recommended that Management require the GAD Focal Point System in the University to establish/set up and maintain a GAD database containing gender statistics and sex-disaggregated data to serve as bases during gender-responsive planning, programming and policy formulation in compliance with PCW-NEDA-DBM JC No. 2012-01.



Managements committed to implement the audit recommendations with the following plan of action:



a)	Dedicate a GAD-resource center before the end of the current fiscal year;

b)	 Hire or assign staff to work specifically on the creation of a GAD database before the end of the current fiscal year;

c)	Conduct capacity-building for gender analysis or audit among all GAD focals in the University;

d)	Ensure that administrative support is afforded to all those who work for the GAD database, especially the GAD Directors who oversee the creation, maintenance, and monitoring of the GAD database; and

e)	Regularly monitor the success indicators of the aforementioned activities.



Management further explained that per assessment of the University Director for GAD, the CTU GFPS is still on its inception with the issuance of BOR Resolution No., 237, series of 2020 in August of last year. It came out late since the enabling mechanisms were not set-up in the past efforts of GAD. Thus, at present, efforts on gender mainstreaming are still on the introduction stage. Nevertheless, they assured that they are doing their best to comply with the standards set by the Philippine Commission on Women in terms of preparation of the GAD Plan and Budget for the next review period.



Compliance with Tax Laws 



Cebu Technological University has complied with the tax laws on withholding of income tax from compensation and Value-Added Tax (VAT) and Percentage Tax (PT) on goods and services purchased during the year. The taxes withheld in 2020 were remitted regularly to the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR).





Compliance with Republic Act 8291 (GSIS Act of 1997)



The mandatory GSIS Life and Retirement insurance premiums (personal share) and loan repayments were deducted from the monthly salaries of the Campus personnel during the year, in compliance with Section 3.1.1 of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of Republic Act No. 8291, otherwise known as the GSIS Act of 1997.  The deductions along with the Government Share for the compulsory GSIS insurance contribution and loan repayments were remitted regularly to the System.
