C)	FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS 





	



D)	OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS



The Cebu Technological University has produced one graduate who ranked No. 4 in the Mechanical Engineering Licensure Examination given by the Professional Regulation Commission in Calendar Year (CY) 2020.



E)	SCOPE OF AUDIT



The audit covered the financial transactions and operations of the CTU for CY 2020. The objectives of the Audit were primarily to: (a) ascertain the level of assurance that may be placed on management assertions on the financial statements; (b) recommend agency improvement opportunities; and (c) determine the extent of implementation of prior years’ audit recommendations.  On a test basis, it also included a review on the propriety of disbursements and other financial transactions to determine whether or not the transactions were made in accordance with existing laws, rules and regulations.  



F)	AUDITOR’S OPINION ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



The auditor expressed a qualified opinion on the financial statements of the University due to the audit exceptions as stated in the Independent Auditor’s Report, enumerated, as follows: 



1)	Payments of school fees from the students and the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) aggregating ₱53.989 million were not recorded in the books of the CTU Main, Daanbantayan and Moalboal Campuses, hence the balances of the Cash in Bank, Accounts Receivable and Income accounts in the Special Trust Fund are not fairly presented as at year-end. 



2)	School fees and other income of CTU Carmen and San Francisco Campuses were not recognized when they occurred but recorded only to its appropriate income accounts upon receipt of the collections, resulting in the overstatement of the CY 2020 Income account in the Special Trust Fund by ₱45.996 million.



3)	Commission on Audit (COA) Disallowances with issued Notices of Finality of Decision aggregating ₱3.887 million were not recorded as receivables by the seven CTU Campuses contrary to the provisions of COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009, thereby, understating the Receivables-Disallowances/Charges and Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) accounts by the same amount.



4)	Unclaimed stale checks of seven CTU Campuses aggregating ₱3.148 million were not restored to the Cash in Bank- LCCA and appropriate liability accounts contrary to what is required under the provisions of Government Accounting Manual for National Government Agencies, Volume I, resulting in the understatement of the affected accounts as at December 31, 2020. 



G)	SIGNIFICANT OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



In addition, the following are the significant observations and recommendations in the audit and/or evaluation of the operations of CTU for CY 2020. These and other audit observations are fully discussed in Part II of this Report:



1)	Seven CTU external campuses still did not revert the unutilized cash allocations for FY 2019 and the preceding years aggregating ₱77.427 million in the General Fund books to the Bureau of Treasury, contrary to the provisions of COA Circular No. 90-326 dated February 22, 1990, and DBM National Budget Circulars which prescribe the guidelines on the release of funds for the year, resulting in the accumulation of substantial amount in the Cash in Bank account as at December 31, 2020. Such practice deprived the government of maximizing the use of the unutilized funds for other relevant undertakings.



We recommended and Management agreed to require the concerned Budget Officers to prepare a statement of the unutilized funds as of December 31, 2020 and every year thereafter. We also recommended that the concerned   Accountant/Bookkeepers prepare a disbursement voucher for the remittance of the unutilized/unencumbered funds to the Bureau of Treasury in compliance with COA Circular No. 90-326 and DBM National Budget Circulars.  



2)	Deficiencies in the procurements of supplies and materials aggregating ₱1.116 million charged against the DOST Region 7 funded projects in response to the COVID-19 health emergency crisis, such as:  



a)	The technical specifications of the supplies and materials needed in the development of PPE’s, handrubs, and disinfectant gels were not specified as required under Item 3.1 of the GPPB Circular 01-2020 dated April 6, 2020. Moreover, the quantities of expected outputs were not indicated in the Memoranda of Agreement (MOA) and in the line-item budgets. 



We recommended that Management ensure that a detailed cost estimate of supplies and materials as well as the expected outputs be clearly quantified in the preparation of the budget for a certain project.



b)	The requirements and procedures prescribed in GPPB Circular 01-2020 on the procurement of goods covered under the Bayanihan Act were not complied with, thus, the transparency in procurement could not be ascertained and there is no assurance that the purchased items were the most advantageous to the government.



We recommended and Management agreed to ensure that all the documentary requirements prescribed under the existing procurement law and its related GPPB issuances are complied with.  Also, we recommended that Management observe the posting requirement of the Notice of Award, contract, or Purchase order as provided under Item 3.6 of GPPB Circular 01-2020.



c)	There was no summary of the quantities of PPE’s, handrubs, and disinfectant gels produced, and also no proofs of receipt by the intended beneficiaries, resulting in the difficulty of establishing accountability of the procured items, and in determining whether the objective of the projects was fully achieved.



We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Project Team to prepare a summary report on the quantity of each type of PPE items produced and their corresponding beneficiaries duly supported with complete documentation, and to submit the same to the Audit Team, for verification/audit.





H)	STATUS OF IMPLEMENTATION OF PRIOR YEAR’S UNIMPLEMENTED AUDIT RECOMMENDATIONS



	The Audit Team followed up the actions taken by Management on the implementation of prior years’ audit recommendations and noted that two of the audit recommendations reported in CY 2019 Annual Audit Report were already issued with Notices of Disallowance in CY 2020. Of the remaining 72 prior years’ audit recommendations, 24 were implemented, 13 partially implemented and 35 were not implemented as at December 31, 2020.
