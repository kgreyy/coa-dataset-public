OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

 

A. Financial and Compliance Audit 
 

Undisposed Information and Communication Technology Equipment (ICTE) 

 

1. Out of the P431,854.06 ICTE, seven items costing P217,091.06 with carrying 
amount of P21,709.06 had been unserviceable and were kept in the storage 

undisposed for more than five years. 

 

Section 40, Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM states: 

c) PPE is said to be unserviceable if it is no longer capable of 
providing the entity with future economic benefits or service 

potential.  

 

d) All unserviceable property shall be reported in the Inventory 
and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) 

(Appendix 74). PPE reported in the IIRUP shall be dropped 

from the books by debiting Impairment Loss – Property, 

Plant and Equipment (cost of the PPE less Accumulated 

Depreciation). 

 

In addition, section 79 of PD No. 1445 states that “When a government 

property has become unserviceable for any cause, or is no longer needed, it shall, 

upon application of the officer accountable therefore, be inspected by the head of 

the agency or his duly authorized representative in the presence of the auditor 

concerned and, if found to be valueless or unsalable, it may be destroyed in their 

presence.  If found to be valuable, it may be sold at public auction to the highest 

bidder under the supervision of the proper committee on award or similar body in 

the presence of the auditor concerned or other duly authorized representative of the 

Commission, xxx”. 

 

The Report on Physical Count of PPE (RPCPPE) included the following 

seven ICTE unserviceable properties, with a total acquisition cost of P217,091.06, 

which are not reported yet in the IIRUP.

The agency’s unserviceable properties are kept in the storage area, which 

upon inspection by the Audit Team confirmed that the above ICTE were indeed 

unserviceable. However, the Property and Supply Officer has not completed yet the 

inventory and inspection of all unserviceable assets; hence, no IIRUP has been 

prepared yet for these assets; thus, these unserviceable properties have not been 

dropped from the books, contrary to Sections 40(d), Chapter 10, Volume I of the 

GAM.  

 

Inquiry with the Property and Supply Officer revealed that the desktop 

computers have been unserviceable since CY 2010 and the laptop since CY 2012.  

It would have been beneficial for the TCCP to dispose these unserviceable 

properties within a reasonable period of time to avoid further deterioration of the 

properties. A systematic and timely disposal will yield benefits in terms of a higher 

appraised value and enabling storage areas available for other purposes. 

  

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the: 

 

a) Administrative Officer, in his capacity as Property and Supply Officer, to 
expedite the completion of the inventory and inspection of all 

unserviceable assets, prepare the IIRUP, and submit it to the agency’s 

Disposal Committee for the immediate disposal of the unserviceable 

equipment; and  

 

b) Accountant to prepare JEV to record the impairment loss of the 
unserviceable properties based on the IIRUP.

Payment without complete documents 

 

2. Acquisition of 50 pieces heritage books reported as inventory items for 
distribution totaling P225,000.00 was processed and paid without complete 

documentation necessary to determine the validity of the transaction as 

required under Section 4(6) of PD No. 1445.  

 

Section 4(6) of PD No. 1445 provides that claims against government funds 

shall be supported with complete documentation. 

 

The impact of the CY 2020 COVID-19 pandemic on the project 

implementation of TCCP has caused interruptions of planned trainings due to 

lockdowns and travel ban, which prompted the Management to pursue a different 

venture in order to advance with the projects and activities for least developed 

countries.  

 

In the pursuit of its Program for Culture Heritage Preservation and Eco-

Tourism for Sustainable Development as part of the Economic and Technical Skills 

Training Program, the TCCP commissioned the Phil-Asia Heritage and Art 

Management, Inc. (PHAMI) on June 1, 2020 to deliver 50 pieces heritage books 

entitled “Life and Works of Luis Ac-AC of Paete” to serve as tokens or giveaways 

to its partner Philippine embassies, consulates and participants whether local or 

foreign. 

 

The alternative mode of procurement known as Direct Contracting was 

employed in the procurement of the books since the goods are proprietary in nature, 

which can only be obtained from the proprietary source when patents, trade secrets 

and copyrights prohibit others from manufacturing the same item.  Direct 

Contracting is a method of procurement of goods whereby the supplier is simply 

asked to submit a price quotation or pro-forma invoice together with the conditions 

of sale. 

 

The PHAMI quoted the book at P4,500.00 each and TCCP prepared 

Purchase Order (PO) No. 2020-06-001 for the 50 pieces heritage books totaling 

P225,000.00 inclusive of VAT. 

 

Audit, however, of the said transaction between the TCCP and the PHAMI 

revealed that the disbursement voucher (DV) was processed and the supplier was 

paid even if the following documents were not attached to the DV, as provided for 

in COA Circular No. 2012-001, prescribing the documentary requirements for 

common government transactions. Thus, resulting in claim against government 

funds, which could not be validated as it is not supported with complete 

documentation: 

 

a) Approved Contract; 



31 

 

b) Official Receipt and Delivery Receipt (OR issued by PHAMI already 
expired on September 7, 2019 invalidating the document); 

c) Certificate of Exclusive Distributorship, if applicable; 
d) Letter or invitation to submit proposals; 
e) Certification from the agency authorized official that there are no sub 

dealers selling at lower prices and for which no suitable substitute can 

be obtained at more advantageous terms to the government; 

f) Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) registration certificate or 
other documents showing existence of juridical personality; 

g) Articles of Incorporation, By-Laws, and any amendments thereto 
reflecting its primary and secondary purposes; 

h) Tax Clearance; and 
i) Audited Financial Statements. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to strengthen the agency’s 

internal control in the processing and payment of claims/transactions such 

that appropriate supporting documents are complete and attached to the DV 

upon processing of the transaction.   

 

Management Comment: 

 

The Management commented that the Administrative Officer together with 

the Accountant have already communicated with the supplier to secure all the 

necessary documentary requirements under COA Circular No. 2012-001.  

 

 

Fund Utilization 

 

3. Budget allocation of P2,242,000.00 for trainings to implement the Economic 
and Technical Skills Program was not utilized as alternative virtual trainings 

were not planned at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.   

 

Section 3 of the General Provisions (GP) of the General Appropriations Act 

(GAA) FY 2020 provides that the GAA, upon its effectivity, shall be considered 

the allotment authorizing agencies to obligate in accordance to its provisions where 

the amounts appropriated shall be used specifically for the activities or projects 

indicated therein. 

 

Under EO No. 17 s. 1992, the major task of TCCP is to formulate and 

implement a technical cooperation program in line with the Philippine 

Government’s commitment to the United Nations Resolutions on technical and 

economic cooperation among developing countries.  Its mandates are: (a) formulate 

and implement a technical cooperation program focused on its non-degree training 

courses on programs that would help alleviate the plight of the poor so that the 

Philippines fulfills its commitment to the United Nation (UN) Millennium 

Development Goals and (b) coordinate related projects and activities.

As provided for in the GAA FY 2020, the amount of P5,221,000.00 was 

appropriated for TCCP, to wit:

For its trainings, TCCP was appropriated and deemed allotted 

P3,720,000.00. The actual Notice of Cash Allocation (NCA) released each quarter 

in CY 2020, totaled P5,222,000.00 for its general and administrative expenses 

including the budget for the implementation of its economic and technical skills 

training program. 

 

Based on the FY 2020 Proposed Program of TCCP, the following projects 

with a budget of P2,242,000.00 were scheduled to be implemented, but these were 

either cancelled or postponed for implementation in CY 2021:

Total 2,242,000.00  

 

Since the beginning of March 2020, there has been a high level of project 

delays and cancellations due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with widespread 

restrictions on the movement of people and enforcement of complete or partial 

lockdowns up to the end of the year. 

 

The TCCP initially arranged in March 2020 the training on the Capacity 

Building Program in Tourism Services and Hospitability Management in Hotel 

Benilde, Manila, however, it was subsequently cancelled in compliance with the 

Metro Manila lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

 

In June 2020, the Chairperson-Alternate was given a cash advance in the 

amount of P780,000.00 for the implementation of the training on Trainers on Palay 

Check System. The cash advance, however, was fully liquidated/returned because 

the training was postponed for implementation in CY 2021. 

 

Accordingly, the projects of TCCP were put to a halt, and all the unused 

cash allocations less administrative and preparatory cost of the cancelled project, 

were reverted to the Bureau of Treasury. The total reversal during the year that 

included the unused cash allocations for TCCP projects amounted to 

P2,181,281.31, with the following details: 

 

Particulars Amount(P) 

1st Quarter Unutilized Cash-MDS Regular 72,424.30 

Check Cancellation 32,106.01 

2nd Quarter Check Cancellation 370,000.00 

Unutilized Cash-MDS Regular 4,135.88 

3rd Quarter Check Cancellation 2,811.95 

Unutilized Cash-MDS Regular 876,542.29 

4th Quarter Check Cancellation 1,853.46 

Unutilized Cash-MDS Regular 821,407.42 

Total 2,181,281.31 

 

Despite cash allocations released and made available for the projects during 

the year, TCCP failed to complete the implementation of its projects and activities, 

defeating the timely budget releases for its identified projects and activities.  It was 

not able to utilize the allocation for trainings to implement the Economic and 

Technical Skills Program due to its failure to plan alternative virtual trainings at the 

onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.   

 



34 

 

A number of different technologies, alone or in combination with other 

approaches, can provide distance learning like virtual training or internet video 

conferencing. TCCP could have engaged these methods to facilitate its trainings; 

thereby, achieving its objectives. 

 

TCCP, on its Physical Report of Operation explained that together with its 

partner agencies, they are developing training approach to adapt to the various 

challenges brought about by the pandemic. It further stated that TCCP is suspending 

implementation of said programs and activities for a future date. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to direct the 

Administrative Officer to adapt alternative virtual/online trainings platform 

to facilitate the trainings and activities as planned, consistent with its 

objectives and mandates under EO No. 17 s. 1992. 

 

 

B. Other Areas 
 

Implementation of Gender and Development (GAD) Plans and Budget  

 

4. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the GAD projects/programs or any GAD-related 
activities of TCCP were cancelled/postponed. The only major accomplishment 

reported by the TCCP is the printing and distribution of the coffee table book by 

Celestino Palma III, entitled “The Life and Works of Luis Ac-AC of Paete costing 

P225.000.00. The coffee table books were distributed to all types of genders to 

inspire them on historical and traditional wood carving, which can be done by 

anyone regardless of gender. 

 

 

Programs for Senior-Citizens and Persons with Disability (PWDs) 

 

5. The building of DFA where the TCCP is located has provided its clients and 
employees with designs that reasonably enhanced the mobility, safety and welfare 

of Senior Citizens and PWDs in compliance with Section 32 of the GP of the GAA 

FY 2020. Although TCCP has no specific programs for the Senior Citizens and 

PWDs, its projects do not discriminate their participation. 

 

 

Disaster Risk Reduction and Management (DRRM) 

 

6. Although TCCP did not participate in the nationwide simultaneous disaster 
preparedness program and in other fire or earthquake drills or briefings due to 

pandemic restrictions, the personnel of TCCP undergone an actual earthquake 

disaster plan when hit by an earthquake on October 29, 2020. 

 

 



35 

 

Compliance with Tax Laws, Rules and Regulations 

 

7. Constructive taxes withheld and remittances for payments of expenses and 
compensation in CYs 2017 and 2018 disclosed discrepancies of unremitted 

amounts totaling P44,286.90, which could not be verified due to incomplete 

submission or non-availability of supporting documents for remittances made. 

Moreover, TCCP did not withhold taxes on GMP on its acquisition of the 

coffee table book by Celestino Palma III, entitled “The Life and Works of Luis 

Ac-AC of Paete costing P225.000.00, contrary to Section 4.114-2 of RR No. 16-

2005, as amended, and Section 4.2 of DOF-DBM-COA JC No. 1-2000 

precluding its remittance to BIR. 

 

Chapter 3, Volume III, the Revised Chart of Accounts of the GAM 

describes Due to BIR as an account used to recognize withholding of taxes from 

officers or employees and other entities. This account is debited for remittance of 

the taxes withheld to the BIR. 

 

Likewise, the account Tax Remittance Advice (TRA) is used to recognize 

the constructive remittance to BIR of taxes withheld. Sample entries for National 

Government Agency (NGA) books on the withholding and remittances of taxes are 

illustrated in Section 38, Chapter 5, Volume I of the GAM, and presented below:

Review of the General Ledger (GL) of Due to BIR and Cash-TRA disclosed 

that taxes withheld from prior years 2017 and 2018 did not reconcile with the 

amounts remitted to BIR, while taxes withheld for the years 2019 and 2020 were 

correctly remitted. Details are shown below:

Total 401,563.58 357,276.68 44,286.90  

 

The “Unknown” dates of remittances in previous years could not be verified 

due to lack of data trail in the eFiling and Payment System (EFPS). Per inquiry, 

several remittances were not inputted in the EFPS; thus, could not be downloaded 

or retrieved anytime for review. It was also noted that several TRAs were not yet 

submitted to the Office of the Auditor as of audit date. 

 

Analysis of the GL revealed that only P34,380.91 out of P66,517.80 taxes 

withheld in December 2017 were supported with the corresponding proof of 

remittance to BIR. No other remittances for the unremitted balance of P32,136.89 

were verified. 

 

Likewise, in November 2018, only P7,582.31 out of P17,267.20 was 

remitted, leaving an unremitted amount of P9,684.89. No other remittances were 

made in year 2018 pertaining to this balance. 

 

It was gathered that back in the years 2017 and 2018, TCCP did not have a 

designated full time Accountant; hence, the accounting for taxes was left 

unattended. For the years 2018 and 2019, JEVs were prepared to adjust erroneous 

and unrecorded issuances of TRA. However, the breakdown and other details of 

the total variance of P44,286.90 could not be verified due to lack of supporting 

documents. The amount remains unreconciled as of audit date. 

 

Moreover, verification of TCCP’s acquisition of the coffee table book by 

Celestino Palma III costing P225.000.00 disclosed that it did not withhold the 



37 

 

required taxes on GMP upon payment, precluding its remittance to the BIR, in 

violation of Section 4.114-2 of RR No. 16-2005, as amended, and Section 4.2 of 

DOF-DBM-COA JC No. 1-2000. As a withholding agent, TCCP should have paid 

its supplier or contractors for goods delivered net of withholding taxes and recorded 

all taxes withheld in the books of account. 

 

Section 4.114-2 of RR No. 16-2005, as amended by RA No. 10963 

otherwise known as Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion (TRAIN) Law, 

provides for the withholding of the five percent Final-Value Added Tax (VAT) on 

GMP.  

 

The application of the said provision should be synchronized with the 

provisions of RR No. 2-98, as amended, on the withholding of income tax of one 

percent on purchase of goods and two percent on purchase of services. The basis of 

the withholding of income tax should always be net of VAT imposed on the said 

purchase of goods and/or services. 

 

RR No. 2-98 also states that every officer or employee of the government 

of the Republic of the Philippines or any of its agencies and instrumentalities, its 

political subdivision, as well as Government Owned and Controlled Corporations 

(GOCC) charged with the duty to deduct and withhold any internal revenue tax and 

to remit the same in accordance with these regulation shall upon conviction for each 

act of omission herein – below specified be fine in a sum of not less than five 

thousand pesos but not more than P50,000.00 or imprisoned for a term of not less 

than six months and one day but not more than two years or both. 

 

a) Fails or causes the failure to deduct and withhold any internal revenue 
tax covered by these regulations. 

b) Fails or causes the failure to remit taxes deducted and withheld within 
the time prescribed therein. 

c) Fails or causes the failure to file the return of issue certificate required. 
 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Accountant 

to: 

 

a) continue to verify prior years transactions pertaining to the Due to BIR 
account to validate its balance, effect the necessary adjustment, and remit 

to the BIR whatever remaining balance found; and 

 

b) conform to the responsibilities of an agency as a withholding agent, in 
compliance with Section 4.114-2 of RR No. 16-2005, as amended, and 

Section 4.2 of DOF-DBM-COA JC No. 1-2000. 

 

Management Comment: 

 

The Management commented that it will communicate with the supplier.
