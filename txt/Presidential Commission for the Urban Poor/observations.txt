OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

A. Financial Audit 
 

Unreliable cash balances and overstatement of ICTE - ₱4,967,040.00 

 

1. The recorded irregularly processed payment of undelivered equipment 
resulted in the overstatement of the accounts Information and Communication 

Technology Equipment (ICTE) and Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) by 

₱4,967,040.00 and exposed the agency to possible misuse of funds. Likewise, 

the non-submission of Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRSs) and the 

corresponding bank statements precluded the Audit Team from ensuring the 

correctness of cash balances and the detection of errors. 

 

Audit of the cash transactions of the PCUP disclosed the following 

deficiencies: 

 

(a) Recording of undelivered equipment and irregular processing of its payment 
 

Sound internal control dictates that payment shall be processed and made out 

of government funds only when goods are delivered, and services are rendered or 

when there is a valid claim. Moreover, assets are recorded only upon actual delivery 

and full acceptance and inspection by the procuring entity, not when the contract is 

perfected. 

 

Sections 3 (c) and (d), Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs provides 

that “the cost of an item of PPE shall be recognized as assets if, and only if 

beneficial ownership and control clearly rest with the government; and the asset is 

used to achieve government objectives.” 

 

In December 2020, the PCUP entered into a contract with Accent Micro 

Technologies Inc. for the delivery of laptops with total costs of ₱4,967,040.00. The 

contract and its supporting documents were not submitted to the Audit Team for 

review; hence, its perfection and details were not confirmed nor validated. 

 

The Accountant narrated that the payment was processed, and a Check No. 

230954 was prepared with the assumption that the supplier will deliver these 

equipment as scheduled. Corresponding entry was made to record the laptops and 

the processed check by a debit to account ICTE and a credit to account Cash, 

Modified Disbursement System (MDS) – Regular for ₱4,700,948.57 (net of 

withholding tax). However, the supplier failed to deliver, and consequently, the 

contract was terminated. As a result, the said check became part of the unreleased 

checks and later on cancelled. 

 



27 

 

 

Review of the BRS (submitted in March 2021) and the report of cancelled 

checks established that Check No. 230954 was processed and subsequently 

cancelled in February 2021. 

 

Although aware of this deficiency, the Accountant did not correct/reverse the 

erroneous entry made. Instead, the supposed purchase of the ICTE was only 

disclosed on the face of the financial statements. As an effect, the reversal of Cash, 

MDS – Regular year-end balance to the Subsidy Income from National Government 

to record the reversion of unutilized Notice of Cash Allocation was short of the 

same amount. Consequently, the ICTE and Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) accounts 

were overstated by ₱4,967,040.00. 

 

This practice of processing payments before the procured item or service is 

delivered/rendered exposed the Agency to possible misuse of funds. 

 

(b) Non-submission of BRS and the corresponding Bank Statements  
 

Pertinent provisions on Bank Reconciliation under Chapter 21, Volume I of 

GAM for NGAs are as follows, among others: 

 

Sec. 3. Objectives. The BRS shall be prepared in order to: 

 

a. Check correctness of both the bank’s and 
agency’s/entity’s records, 

b. Serve as a deterrent to fraud, and 
c. Enable the agency/entity or bank to take up charges or 

credits recognized by the bank or agency/entity but not 

yet known to the agency/entity or bank. xxx 

 

Sec. 7. Reporting. The Chief Accountant shall submit the BRS 

within twenty days after receipt of the monthly bank statement 

to the following: 

 

Original – COA Auditor (with all the supporting documents 

and JEVs) xxx 

 

Review of the cash accounts and transactions of the PCUP revealed the 

following unsubmitted BRS for the four LBP accounts maintained by the Agency:

2069-9001-11 Regular Fund MDS, Regular November to December 2020 

2151-9010-96 Trust Fund MDS, Trust  Per record, no BRS was submitted 

since July 2017 up to audit date 

0691-1200-66 Regular Fund Used for online 

remittances of 

contributions to Pag-IBIG 

January to December 2020  

(Per record, no BRS for CY 2019 

was submitted) 

2151-9008-63  MDS, reported as inactive No BRS was submitted for CY 2020 



28 

 

 

 

Management explained that the delay in preparing and submitting the BRSs 

was due to the late receipt of bank statements from the bank, particularly on LBP 

Account No. 2069-9001-11 or the PCUP’s MDS Regular, in which the BRS for 

November and December 2020 were not yet submitted as at the date of audit. While 

the LBP Account No. 0691-1200-66 is used for remittances to Pag-IBIG via the 

online facility of LBP. However, despite the ability to print the monthly bank 

statement through online, the Agency did not prepare nor submit BRS. 

 

Moreover, LBP Account No. 2151-9010-96 is used for the Agency’s trust 

receipts from the Department of Transportation (DOT), Department of Interior and 

Local Government (DILG), and National Housing Authority (NHA) for various 

programs/projects. From the time the account was created, the Agency never 

submitted BRS. This lapse was further intensified by the delayed submission of 

Disbursement Vouchers (DVs) - June 2019 to September 2020 DVs were only 

submitted on December 29, 2020; and October to December 2020 were only 

received by the Audit Team on March 16, 2021.  

 

The non-submission of BRS and its corresponding Bank Statements, 

especially for Account No. 2151-9010-96, which transactions/DVs were submitted 

belatedly, precluded the Audit Team from ensuring the correctness of cash 

balances, and any misuse of funds could not be readily detected. 

 

In view of the preceding deficiencies, the faithful representation of the balance 

of the Cash and Cash Equivalents account as of December 31, 2020, in the amount 

of ₱1,067,447.47 was not established, and resulted in the overstatement of the ICTE 

and the Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) accounts by ₱4,967,040.00. 

 

We recommended that Management require the: 

 

a. Administrative and Finance Division (AFD) to avoid the practice of 
processing payment before the goods are received by the Agency; 

 

b. Accounting Unit to prepare the necessary adjusting entry to correct the 
irregular recording of the ICTE items and its payments amounting to 

₱4,967,040.00 by debiting the Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) and crediting 

the ICTE account; and 

 

c.    Accounting Unit to prepare and submit BRSs together with all the required 
schedules and supporting documents within the prescribed deadline to 

allow timely verification thereof.

Management Comment: 

 

On recording of undelivered equipment and irregular processing of its payment: 

 

 The payment/check was prepared given the anticipated limited personnel in 
December 2020 and that the pertinent funds will be returned to the Treasury if 

not disbursed in 2020; 

 No payment was made and the recording of undelivered laptops is not 
permanent; 

 The check was cancelled accordingly; and 
 The necessary adjusting entry to correct the recording of payment and of the 

ICTE will be done in line with the recommendation 

 

On non-submission of Bank Reconciliation Statement and the corresponding Bank 

Statement: 

 

 The delayed submission was primarily due to delayed receipt of Bank 
Statements. 

 The Accounting Unit has limited personnel because it maintains only a skeletal 
force due to the 2019 pandemic. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

The Audit Team maintain its stand that the Agency should observe regular 

processing of payment, that is, payment should only be processed when the items 

purchased are received. The same goes with the transaction recording; assets should 

only be recorded when delivered and duly received by the Agency. 

 

As this is a reiteration of prior years’ observation, this deficiency already 

existed before the pandemic. Also, of the four (4) existing bank accounts of the 

Agency, only one BRS was prepared and submitted during the audit period. 

 

 

Misstatements in Inventory and PPEs and control deficiencies - ₱3,216,572.67 

 

2. Misstatements in the Inventory accounts caused by the (a) non-recognition of 
issued Semi-Expendable Properties (SEPs) with an aggregate amount of 

₱3,216,572.67 and (b) non-recording of issued Office Supplies Inventory (OSI). 

Likewise, there were lapses in the control of accountability of the PPE and 

Inventory items such as the (c) non-issuance of PAR for issued ICTE and 

Office Equipment (OE) totaling ₱4,161,251.01 and (d) non-submission of RPCI 

and RPCPPE and incomplete PPELC data that resulted in the non-

establishment of accountabilities and the exposure of the PPEs and inventories 

to the risk of being stolen, lost or misused. 

 

 



30 

 

 

(a) Non-recognition of issued SEPs - ₱3,216,572.67  
 

Pertinent provisions on SEPs under Chapter 8, Volume I of the GAM for 

NGAs are as follows: 

 

Sec. 10. b. These tangible assets shall be recognized as 

expenses upon issue to the end-user. 

 

Sec. 11. Accountability over Semi-Expendable Property. 

Inventory Custodian Slip (ICS) (Appendix 59) shall be issued 

to end-user of Semi-Expendable Property to establish 

accountability over them. xxx 

 

The detailed statement of financial position of the PCUP as at December 31, 

2020, showed the following balances of SEPs:

While the related expenses were reported at the Agency’s detailed statement 

of financial performance as at December 31, 2020, as follows:

Total SEP Expenses 86,882.25  

  

From the tables above, it appeared that the PCUP Central Office did not issue 

SEPs for CY 2020 and the CY 2019 balances were not reduced for issuances. 

However, inquiry with the concerned Supply, Property and General Services Unit 

(SPGSU) personnel of the physical existence of these SEPs disclosed that SPGSU 

no longer holds a single stock of SEP as at year-end. The Audit Team was informed 

that SEPs were issued in the period that these were acquired; hence, no physical 

item is in their position. 

 

Moreover, there were 43 Inventory Custodian Slips (ICS) in the possession of 

the SPGSU, which were not yet submitted to the Accounting Unit for posting. 

These ICSs pertain to issuances for CY 2020 but were unrecorded as at December 

31, 2020. Details are as follows: 

 

No. of ICS Particulars Amount (₱) 

6 SEOE – seven (7) calculators 2,427.95 

3 SEFF – three (3) office tables with drawers 22,900.00 

34 
SEICTE – 33 Epson L5190 printer and one TP-

Link Wireless USB 

418,992.81 

Total 444,320.76 

 

Further, as there was no remaining stock for SEP at year-end, it can be 

inferred that there were issuances that were not issued with ICS. As a result, 

accountabilities over these properties were not established, which may lead to the 

risk of being stolen or lost or misused, and the related SEPs accounts in the 

financial statements are overstated by ₱3,216,572.67. 

 

(b) Non-recognition of issued Office Supplies Inventory 
 

Relevant provisions related to inventory under Chapter 8, Volume I of the 

GAM for NGAs are as follows: 

 

Sec. 7. Recognition as an Expense. When inventories are sold, 

exchanged, or distributed, their carrying amount shall be 

recognized as an expense in the period in which the related 

revenue is recognized. If there is no related revenue, the 



32 

 

 

expense is recognized when the goods are distributed or the 

related service is rendered. 

 

Sec. 17.g. Report of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI) 

(Appendix 64) shall be prepared by the Property and/or Supply 

Custodian based on the RIS and shall be used by the 

Accounting Division/Unit as basis in preparing the JEV to 

record the supplies and materials issued. 

 

Accounting records showed that PCUP only recognized the issued Office 

Supplies for January 2020. Issuances from February to December 2020 were not 

recorded as the SPGSU failed to submit to the Accounting Unit the 85 RSMIs 

comprising the issuances of office supplies for those periods, as follows: 

 

Month RSMI No. 
Count of 

RSMI 
RIS No. Amount 

February 2020 2020-02-027 to 043 18 2020-02-057 to 102  Not indicated  

March 2020 2020-03-044 to 054 11 2020-03-103 to 132  Not indicated  

May 2020 2020-05-055 to 060 6 2020-05-133 to 143  Not indicated  

June 2020 2020-06-061 to 063 3 2020-06-144 to 157  Not indicated  

July 2020 2020-07-064 to 066 3 2020-07-158 to 174  Not indicated  

August 2020 2020-08-067 to 069 3 2020-08-175 to 191  Not indicated  

September 2020 2020-09-070 to 071 2 2020-09-192 to 205  Not indicated  

October 2020 2020-10-072 to 084 13 2020-10-206 to 241  Not indicated  

November 2020 2020-11-085 to 097 13 2020-11-241 to 265  Not indicated  

December 2020 2020-12-098 to 110 13 2020-12-265 to 310  Not indicated  

   

As these RSMIs were not submitted to Accounting Unit, the related supplies’ 

actual costs cannot be determined. Hence, the ₱1,936,294.40 Office Supplies 

Inventory as at year-end is overstated by an undetermined amount. 

 

(c) Non-issuance of PAR for issued ICTE and OE - ₱4,161,251.01 

 

Section 21, Chapter 10, of the same volume of the GAM provides that “xxx 

the Supply and/or Property Custodian shall prepare Property Acknowledgment 

Receipt (PAR) (Appendix 71) to support the issue of property to end-user. The PAR 

shall be renewed at least every three years or every time there is a change in 

accountability or custodianship of the property.” 

 

While Section 42 (f) describes PAR as the form “to be used by the Supply 

and/or Property Division/Unit to report the issuance of PPE and the 

acknowledgement of the end-user.” 

 

Inspection of the Property Cards (PCs) and PARs maintained by the SPGSU 

showed that properties issued to end-users were not supported with PAR. Based on 

sampled ICTEs and OEs, 109 properties costing ₱4,161,251.01 were found to be 



33 

 

 

assigned to end-users as per the PCs, but PARs evidencing the acknowledgment of 

accountabilities were non-existent. Details are as follows: 

 

Particulars Qty Amount (₱) 

ICTE: 

Laptops/Notebooks 34  1,066,254.00  

Desktop Computers 38  969,101.81

Check Writer 1  27,500.00  

Total 32  2,005,112.85  

Grand Total 109 4,161,251.01 

 

Moreover, some PARs were unsigned or not acknowledged by the recipients. 

Hence, accountabilities of these properties were not established and are exposed to 

the risk of being stolen, lost or misused. 

 

(d) Non-submission of RPCI and RPCPPE, and incomplete PPELC data 
 

Sections 13 and 17 (i), Chapter 8 provide that physical count/inventory, which 

is required semi-annually, is an indispensable procedure for checking the integrity 

of property custodianship. Report on the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) 

(Appendix 66) shall be used to report the physical count of supplies by type of 

inventory and the instructions in Appendix 66 states that it shall be submitted to the 

COA Auditor not later than July 31 and January 31 of each year. 

 

Section 38, Chapter 10 provides that entity shall have a periodic physical 

count of PPE, which shall be done annually and presented on the Report on the 

Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) (Appendix 71) as at 

December 31 each year. This shall be submitted to the Auditor concerned not later 

than January 31 of the following year.” 

 

In February 2021, the PCUP invited the Audit Team to witness the physical 

count of inventories. However, as at the date of writing, no RPCI was submitted. 

Also, the Agency was not able to conduct a physical count of the PPEs; hence, no 

RPCPPE. Moreover, the Accounting Unit’s PPELC does not include the properties 

assigned/distributed to FOD-Visayas and FOD-Mindanao. 

 



34 

 

 

As a result, the existence and accuracy of the reported balances of PPEs and 

Inventories in the financial statements as at year-end could not be accurately 

established. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the: 

 

a. SPGSU to - 
 

i.   immediately prepare the ICS and RSMIs for the prior issued SEPs 
and office supplies and submit them to the Accounting Unit; 

 

ii.   periodically submit accomplished ICS to the Accounting Unit for 
timely posting/recording and ensure that duly-accomplished ICS 

should accompany every issuance of SEPs to establish 

accountabilities on them; 

 

iii.   ascertain that all issuances of inventories are supported with 
Requisition and Issue Slip (RIS), summarized in a monthly RSMIs, 

and periodically submit them to Accounting Unit for recording; 

 

iv.   ensure that accountabilities over the PPEs are established and all 
issued properties are duly supported by PAR; 

 

b. SPGSU and Accounting Unit to coordinate and conduct periodic 
reconciliation of balances and records of properties and inventories; 

 

c. Accounting Unit to - 
 

i.   include all the property of the Agency, regardless of location, in the 
PPELC; and 

 

ii.   adjust the affected accounts in the books upon receipt of the ICS and 
RSMIs from the SPGSU; and 

 

d. Inventory Committee to ensure the periodic conduct of physical count of 
inventories and PPEs, and prepare and submit the RPCI and RPCPPE as 

prescribed by GAM for NGAs. 
 

 

Misstatements and Accounting Deficiencies on Expenses 

 

3. The erroneous recording in CY 2020 of prior period disbursements totaling 
₱558,985.24 resulted in the overstatement of expenses and accumulated 

surplus/deficit by the same amount.  Moreover, travelling, other professional 

services and consultancy expenses of ₱101,540.00 was misclassified as training 

expenses, and disbursements aggregating ₱4,344,254.69 were paid without 



35 

 

 

complete documentation necessary to determine its validity and regularity, and 

accuracy, as required under Section 4.6 of PD No. 1445, and service contracts 

were not notarized/improperly notarized and were submitted late. 

 

(a) Prior period expenses recognized as expenses for CY 2020 - ₱558,985.24 
 

Section 6 (b), Chapter 2, Volume I of the GAM provides that each 

government entity shall recognize and present its financial transactions and 

operations conformably to the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with the 

International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS). 

 

While Section 2 (a) defines accrual basis as a basis of accounting under which 

transactions and other events are recognized when they occur (and not only when 

cash or its equivalent is received or paid). Therefore, the transactions and events are 

recognized in the accounting records and recognized in the financial statements of 

the periods to which they relate.  

 

Post-audit of DVs showed that CY 2019 disbursements totaling ₱558,985.24 

were recorded as CY 2020 expenses, contrary to the accrual basis of accounting 

under the aforecited Sections, 2 (a) and 6 (b). As a result, the said expenses 

accounts and accumulated surplus/deficit were overstated by the same amount, as

Misclassification of various accounts affected the reliability and faithful 

presentation of the accounts in the financial statements contrary to Section 7, 

Chapter 19, Volume I of the GAM, which provides that the Financial Statements 

shall present fairly the financial position, financial performance, and cash flows of 

an entity.  Fair presentation requires the faithful presentation of the effects of 

transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with the definitions and 

recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in IPSASs. 

 

(c) Unsupported claims against government funds - ₱4,344,254.69 
 

Section 4 (6) of PD No. 1445 sets forth the fundamental principles that govern 

any government agency’s financial transactions and operations, which provides that 

claims against government funds shall be supported with complete documentation, 

while COA Circular No. 2012-001 requires pertinent documentary requirements for 

common government transactions. 
 

Review of the documentary requirements on the payment of training 

expenses, traveling expenses – local and other professional services aggregating 

₱4,344,254.69 were not observed, as some of the claims, if not all, were not 

supported with the following documents (see Annex B for details): 

 

Training Expenses: 

 1. Official Receipts 
2. Notice of Meeting 
3. Minutes of Meeting 
4. Purchase Request 
5. Purchase Order 
6. Certificate of Emergency Purchase 
7. Inspection and Acceptance Report 
8. Abstract of Canvass 

 

Traveling Expenses: 

 9. Office Order/Travel Order approved (Sec. 3 of EO No. 298); 
10. Duly approved itinerary of travel; 
11. Certificate of appearance/attendance; 
12. Certificate of Travel Completed; and 
13. Receipts/Certificate of Expenses Not Requiring Receipts (CENRR) 

to support the valid claims of transportation allowances  
 

 

 



39 

 

 

Other Professional Services: 

 14. Daily Time Record 
15. Accomplishment Report 

 

Likewise, review of the service contracts showed the following deficiencies: 

 

1. There were contracts of the contract of service/job order personnel 
(COSs/JOs), which were not notarized or were notarized beyond the 

stipulated commencement or assumption date of the COS/JO; and  

 

2. In submitting the contracts of COS/JOs, Management incurred delays 
ranging from four to 165 days, contrary to COA Circular 2009-001 dated 

February 12, 2009. The Circular requires that within five (5) working days 

from the execution of a contract by the government or any of its 

subdivisions, agencies or instrumentalities, a copy of said contract and its 

supporting documents shall be furnished to the Auditor. 

 

The above deficiencies resulted from the Accountant’s failure to closely 

monitor and review the DVs as to their completeness of documentary requirements 

in compliance with pertinent rules and regulations; thus affecting the transactions’ 

validity and regularity. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a. require the Chief Accountant to: 
 

i. prepare adjusting entries to correct the affected accounts, and 
henceforth, to strictly conform to the accrual basis of accounting in 

accordance with the IPSAS. 

 

ii. ensure that transactions are recorded in the correct accounts; and 
 

iii. refrain from processing claims with incomplete documentation in 
compliance with Section 4(6) of PD 1445 and the prescribed 

documentary requirements under COA Circular No. 2012-001; and 

 

b. ensure that contracts of the COS/JOs are submitted within the prescribed 
period in conformity with the provisions of COA Circular 2009-001, while 

ascertaining that all contracts are notarized before the stipulated 

commencement of the COS/JO’s service. 
 

 

Non-preparation of Financial Statements for Trust Receipts 

 

4. PCUP did not prepare nor submit separate financial statements for its Trust 
Receipts/Inter-Agency Transferred Funds, totaling ₱429,422,011.52, contrary 



40 

 

 

to the provisions of COA Circular No. 2015-002 and the GAM for NGAs, and 

adversely affecting the fair presentation of the Agency’s financial statements. 

 

COA Circular No. 2015-002 dated March 9, 2015 (updated by COA 

Resolution 2020-001), provides the following provisions related to NGAs’ 

preparation and submission of financial statements: 
 

4.1. The components of financial statements, pursuant to 
PPSAS 1, are as follows: 

  
a. Statement of Financial Position 
b. Statement of Financial Performance 
c. Statement of Cash Flows 
d. Statement of Changes in Net Assets/Equity 
e. Statement of Comparison of Budget and Actual 

Amounts 

f. Notes to the Financial Statements comprising a 
summary of significant accounting policies and other 

explanatory notes. 
 

4.2. xxx, all NGAs shall submit to the COA Auditors and the 
Government Accountancy Sector, COA, the detailed 

financial statements and trial balances consolidated by 

fund cluster as follows: 
 

a. Regular Agency Fund 
b. Foreign Assisted Projects Fund 
c. Special Accounts – Locally Funded/Domestic Grants 

Fund 

d. Special Accounts – Foreign Assisted/Foreign Grants 
Fund 

e. Internally Generated Funds 
f. Business Related Funds 
g. Trust Receipts/Inter-Agency Transferred Funds (IATF) 

 

5.1. All NGAs shall prepare and submit one set of financial 
statements for all funds (combined all funds) as 

enumerated in paragraph 4.1 as their general purpose 

financial statements. 

 

Pertinent provisions of Chapter 2, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs state the 

following: 
 

Sec. 8. Financial Reporting System for the National 

Government. xxx 

 



41 

 

 

a. Each entity of the National Government (NG) maintains 
complete set of accounting books by fund cluster which is 

reconciled with the records of cash transactions maintained 

by the BTr. 

 

Sec. 13. Fund Accounting. The books of accounts shall be 

maintained by fund cluster as follows: 
 

Code Description 
01 Regular Agency Fund 

02 Foreign Assisted Projects Fund 

03 Special Account-Locally Funded/Domestic Grants Fund 

04 Special Account-Foreign Assisted/Foreign Grants Fund 

05 Internally Generated Funds 

06 Business Related Funds 

07 Trust Receipts 

  

PCUP has been maintaining a trust account for the fund transfers from the 

DILG, Department of Transportation (DOTr), and National Housing Authority 

(NHA) for various projects and programs. It has been submitting to the Audit Team, 

although belatedly, the following reports and documents related to these trust 

receipts: 
  

a. Trial Balance 
b. Reports of Checks Issued 
c. Reports of ADA Issued 
d. Disbursement Vouchers and Obligation 

Request and Status and attachments 

e. Journal Entry Voucher 
f. Other liquidation reports 

 

For CY 2020 and in prior years, the Agency did not submit financial 

statements for the Trust Receipts/IATF. The Accounting Unit was only submitting 

financial statements for the Regular Agency Fund or General Fund. 

 

It was determined from the review of the above-submitted reports that these 

unreported transactions in the Agency’s financial statements amounted to 

₱429,422,011.52. 

 

This non-compliance with the above provisions of the COA Circular No. 

2015-002 and the GAM for NGAs or non-reporting of account balances related to 

the trust receipts transactions affects the fair presentation of financial statements.  

  

We recommended and the Accountant agreed to prepare and submit: 

 

a. complete set of financial statements by fund cluster in accordance with 
Section 4.2 of COA Circular No. 2015-002 and Sections 8 and 13 of the 

GAM for NGAs; and 



42 

 

 

 

b. One set of financial statements for all funds (combined) in conformity with 
Section 5.1 of COA Circular No. 2015-002. 

 

 

B. Compliance Audit 
 

Control Weaknesses in the Grant, Utilization and Liquidation of Cash Advances (CAs) 

to Special Disbursement Officers (SDOs) 

 

5. The inadequate controls in the grant, utilization, liquidation, and monitor of 
CAs to various SDOs aggregating ₱2,924,568.43 resulted in (a) the delays in 

liquidation ranging from six to 411 days; (b) incomplete supporting documents 

of liquidation reports of expenditures amounting to ₱746,301.18; (c) grant of 

CAs in excess of maximum cash accountability (MCA) and Agency’s 

authorized CA amount; (d) unnecessary expenditures amounting to 

₱90,234.19; and (e) other noted deficiencies exposed the government funds to 

risk of loss and misappropriation or misuse. 

 

COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 provides, among others, 

the following: 
 

Sec. 4.1.2. No additional cash advances shall be allowed to any 

official or employee unless the previous cash advance given to 

him is first settled or a proper accounting thereof is made. 

 

Sec. 4.1.3. A cash advance shall be reported on as soon as the 

purpose for which it was given has been served. 

 

Sec. 5.8. All cash advances shall be fully liquidated at the end of 

each year. Except for petty cash fund, the AO shall refund any 

unexpended balance to the Cashier/Collecting Officer who will 

issue the necessary official receipt. 

 

Section 1.0 of COA Circular No. 2012-004 dated November 28, 2012, 

provides that “CAs for special purpose and time-bound activities must be liquidated 

within 20 days from accomplishment of the purpose.”   

 

Also, CSC Resolution No. 1900929 dated August 13, 2019, amending the 

Rule V of CSC Resolution No. 04-0676 dated June 17, 2004, provides: 
 

Section 8. The failure of an Accountable Officer to render an 

account in full within the periods prescribed and after formal 

demand shall constitute the administrative office of Gross 

Neglect of Duty punishable by dismissal from the service for 

the first offense. Full liquidation/settlement/payment of the 

subject cash advance outside the given periods shall constitute 



43 

 

 

the offense of Simple Neglect of Duty punishable by 

suspension from the service for one (1) month and one (1) day 

to six (6) months for the first offense, and dismissal from the 

service for the second offense. 

 

Review of the account Advances to SDOs with book balance of 

₱3,110,351.70 disclosed that CAs amounting to ₱2,924,568.43 were overdue for 14 

days to over three years already, with details as follows:

Olympia Micor 488,805.63 14 to 43 days Active 

Total 2,924,568.43   

 

It is worth noting that the then PCUP Audit Team Leader had sent SDO 

Rhinelan Lachica a demand letter in March 2019; however, as of date, his 

outstanding CAs remained unliquidated. This inaction is considered as gross neglect 

of duty as provided under Section 5.4.(a) of CSC Memorandum Circular No. 23, 

s.2019, to wit: 

 

5.4 An Accountable Office shall be held liable for Gross 

Neglect of Duty and imposed the penalty of dismissal from the 

service for the first offense in any of the following instances: 

 

a. the Accountable Officer who, after formal demand by the 
State Auditor or Audit Team Leader, fails to make any 

liquidation, whether partial or full, of the cash advances 

within the prescribed period stated in the formal demand 

letter; xxx 

 

The non-liquidation of CAs within the prescribed deadlines deprived the 

Agency of the benefits of timely accounting and auditing of disbursements and 

exposed the government funds in the hands of the SDOs to risk of loss and possible 

misappropriation. 

 



44 

 

 

The following are the noted causes of the long outstanding cash advances: 

 

(a) Delays from six to 411 days in the liquidation of CAs 
 

Audit of the liquidation reports disclosed that five SDOs incurred settlement 

delays ranging from 6 to 411 days, as provided below: 

 

SDO Amount of CAs Frequency of 

Delay 

No. of Days 

Delay 

Elsie Aradanas 646,300.00 20 7 to 411 

Rosario Nenita Mancile 405,100.00 4 23 to 222 

Olympia Micor 840,950.00 4 24 to 217 

Robert Bonifacio 607,300.00 24 6 to 179 

Daniel Ramirez 174,671.20 3 18 to 99 

Total 2,674,321.20   

 

Moreover, included in the above table were unutilized CAs that remained idle 

for 169 to 182 days in the hands of the SDOs: 

 

SDO Amount 

of CAs (₱) 

No. of 

CAs 

No. of Days 

Funds are Idle 

Remarks 

Robert Bonifacio 250,000.00 10 169 to 179 days CAs granted before the 

COVID-19 lockdown or in 

March 2020 for activities 

that did not push through, 

however, the CAs were not 

refunded as soon as the 

lockdown was lifted.  

Elsie Aradanas 180,000.00 1 182 days 

Total 430,000.00  

 

Due to the observed frequency of delay in liquidation, it appears that this is a 

normal practice of these SDOs. Late settlement and accounting of CAs expose the 

government fund to possible loss and misuse. 

 

(b) Incomplete supporting documents of expenditures amounting to ₱746,301.18 
 

Section 4 (6) of the Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 provides that “claims 

against government funds shall be supported with complete documentation.” 

 

Evaluation of the liquidation reports revealed that the following expenses 

amounting to ₱746,301.18 lacked the necessary documents to establish their 

validity and propriety:

The non-submission/completion of the necessary documents affected the 

disbursements’ validity and propriety, and an indication of weakness in the internal 

control over disbursements of funds. 

 

(c) Grant of CAs in excess of the MCA and Agency’s authorized CA amount 
 

Section 7.1 of COA Circular No. 2006-005, dated July 13, 2006, states that 

“each accountable officer whose total cash accountability is not less than ₱5,000 

shall be bonded. The amount of bond shall depend on the officer’s total 

accountability as fixed by the Head of the Agency and shall be in accordance with 

the Schedule issued by the Bureau of Treasury (BTr).” 

  



46 

 

 

Treasury Circular (TC) No. 02-2009, dated August 6, 2009, provides the 

revised Schedule of premium rates, which includes the covered cash accountability 

corresponding to a bond premium.  

 

In CY 2020, the PCUP had issued Special Orders (SOs) authorizing each 

SDO to hold a certain amount of CAs for a particular purpose. In the same year, the 

Agency subscribed fidelity bonds for its AOs. However, audit disclosed that there 

were three SDOs whose CAs exceeded the MCA per subscribed fidelity bond under 

TC 02-2009 and the Agency’s authorized CA amount, as shown below:

This occurrence is just one of the many effects of the above lapses in the 

grant, liquidation, and monitor of CAs. Had there been a mechanism to prevent the 

(a) grant of additional CAs on top of unliquidated existing balances and (b) delayed 

settlements of CAs, the total accountability determined by the Agency and the 

amount covered by the fidelity bond could have been adequate. These lapses 

exposed government funds in the hands of SDOs to risk of irrecoverable loss. 

 

(d) Unnecessary expenditures amounting to ₱90,234.19 
  

Audit showed that expenses out of the CAs were not in accordance with the 

intended purpose and were unauthorized. Scrutiny of the liquidation reports (LRs) 

of two SDOs revealed the following observations:

The foregoing findings on CAs were frequently highlighted in the Agency’s 

Annual Audit Reports, yet, non-compliance with pertinent rules persisted.  

 

The inadequate controls on cash accountabilities and the procedural lapses in 

the grant, utilization, recording, and liquidation of CAs exposed the government 

funds to risk of loss and possible misuse. 

 

We recommended that Management: 

 

a. require all concerned SDOs to: 
 

i. justify their failure to observe timely settlements of CAs and the 
incurrence of unnecessary expenditures amounting to ₱90,234.19; and 

 

ii. submit liquidation reports with complete documentary requirements 
to settle their unliquidated CAs as soon as the purpose for which these 

were given have been served; 

 

b. impose sanctions as provided under the CSC Memorandum Circular No. 
23, s. 2019 and CSC Resolution No. 1900929 to erring officials and 

employees who failed to liquidate their CAs within the prescribed period 

and upon demand; 

 

c. intensify the monitoring of controls on CAs by directing the Accountant 
to: 

 

i. strictly monitor CAs and regularly remind/require the liquidation of a 
previous CAs, or the proper accounting thereof, before another CA is 

granted to an SDO; 

 

ii. ensure that the grant and liquidation of CAs are supported with 
complete documentation and should not accept liquidation reports 

that are not adequately documented; 

 

iii. ascertain that SDOs are not granted additional CAs beyond the MCA 
and the authorized amount of CA by the Agency; 

 



49 

 

 

iv. stop the practice of paying cash on purchases that should be 
appropriately paid thru checks; and 

 

d. require the Accountant to review/correct discrepancies on book postings 
and negative balances in the subsidiary ledger (SL). 

 

Management Comment: 

 

Management justified that the delays in liquidation were brought about by the 

simultaneous activities of the SDOs and the fact that the Agency had to operate on a 

skeleton workforce basis. 

 

Management had submitted the lacking supporting documents and the 

justifications of the SDOs on their late liquidations of CAs. 

 

As regards the erring officials and employees who failed to liquidate their 

CAs within the prescribed period and upon demand, Management is under the 

process of reviewing the imposition of sanctions as provided under the CSC 

Memorandum Circular No. 23, s. 2019 and CSC Resolution No. 1900929. 

 

The Chief Accountant committed to intensify the monitoring of controls on 

CAs as recommended under letter (c.) The Accountant also committed to 

review/correct the discrepancies on book postings and negative balances in the SL. 

  

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

The Audit Team cannot sufficiently verify the veracity of the belatedly 

submitted supporting documents. In this respect, the Audit Team recommend that 

the SDOs should submit or file the necessary supporting documents in time with 

their liquidations to fend off suspicions on its credibility. 

 

Moreover, the Audit Team reiterates that Management should strengthen its 

controls over the CAs of the SDOs and observe the rules and regulations governing 

the same. 

 

 

Non-compliance with the MOA between DILG and PCUP 

 

6. PCUP spent administrative costs of ₱8,861,858.85, which was more than the 
budgeted amount, resulting in approximate excess costs of ₱7,083,024.57 with 

an accomplishment rate of only 17.79 percent or 2,022 paid Informal Settler 

Families (ISFs) out of 11,367 targeted ISFs. Moreover, the agency incurred 11 

to 711 days of delay in its submission of liquidation report, contrary to the 

provision of the IRR of the MOA between the Agency and the DILG, and 

Section 4.6 of COA Circular No. 94-013. 

 



50 

 

 

In 2016, PCUP and the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) 

entered into an agreement to facilitate the disbursement or distribution of the 

Interim Shelter Fund. The Interim Shelter Fund (Fund) is the amount allotted in 

favor of the DILG, which shall be distributed among Informal Settler Families 

(ISFs) or beneficiaries residing on top or within the three-meter easement of 

waterways, in the form of financial assistance amounting to ₱18,000.00 for each 

eligible claimant/family. 

 

Audit of the utilization of the Fund disclosed the following: 

 

(a) Administrative costs of ₱8,861,858.85 more than the budgeted amount 
 

The MOA executed between the PCUP and DILG and its IRR on the 

disbursement of the Fund define PCUP and DILG’s roles and responsibilities. 

Among others, these roles and responsibilities are the following: 

 
1) DILG shall transfer to PCUP the amount of ₱204,606,000.00 for 11,367 qualified 

beneficiaries and ₱10,000,000.00 to be allotted for social preparation, mobility, 

and Monitoring & Evaluation Expenses – referred herein as administrative cost 

(Item 2.1.1 of the MOA); 

 

2) PCUP shall treat the Fund as a trust liability and ensure that the releases of DILG 
are properly utilized for their intended purpose, subject to the applicable 

accounting and auditing rules and regulations (Item 2.2.4 of the MOA); and 

 

3) PCUP shall submit the required physical and financial reports to DILG relative to 
the utilization and liquidation of the funds (Item 2.2.9 of the MOA); 

 

The Fund was received by PCUP in two (2) tranches, the ₱95 Million on July 

18, 2017 and the ₱119.6 Million on March 31, 2019. Consistent with the MOA, 

these amounts are to finance the following: 

 
Particulars Amount 

Financial Assistance to ISFs (11,367 x ₱18,000.00) 204,606,000.00 

Administrative Cost 10,000,000.00 

Total 214,606,000.00 
Note: Based on approved work and financial plan 

 

Review of the accounting records and DVs for the years 2017 to 2019 and up 

to September 2020, disclosed that the PCUP disbursed the Fund for various social 

preparation and incurred substantial administrative costs, details of which are 

presented below:

Note:  

1. Budgeted Admin Cost per ISF of ₱879.74* = ₱10 Million/11,367 target ISF; 
2. No. of paid ISF were taken from PCUP Acctg Reports; and  
3. CY 2020 figures are as at September 30, 2020. The DVs and supporting documents from October to 

December 2020 were not received by the Audit Team during the compliance audit date. 

 

It can be deduced from the table above that as early as CY 2017, the PCUP 

had already expended/incurred administrative costs more than the budgeted cost of 

₱879.74 per ISF at an excess rate of 658 percent. As at September 30, 2020, the 

excess rate averaged at 398 percent. 

 

Although the Agency may not have exhausted yet the ₱10 Million, the 

spending trend compared to the number of paid ISFs could already be inferred that 

the Agency is exceeding its budgeted administrative cost. 

 

Further review of records, particularly the approved work and financial plan 
and the actual administrative costs incurred, disclosed that the bulk of expenditures 

was in the salary of personnel. At 2,022 paid ISFs or 17.79 percent 

accomplishment, the PCUP already exceeded its personnel budget of ₱3,960,000.00 

by ₱4,031,651.07. The comparison of the budget and administrative costs is 

provided below:

Note: Actual Cost as at September 30, 2020 

 

Interview with concerned Official and personnel disclosed that the Agency 

had already communicated to DILG its requests for additional administrative costs. 

The Audit Team was provided with the Agency’s written request to DILG dated 

November 6, 2020. The said request contained a disbursement plan detailing the 



52 

 

 

activities, adjusted targets, and an additional ₱11,335,647.00 administrative cost to 

be disbursed from CY 2021 to CY 2023 for the remaining unpaid ISFs. 

 

Although the Agency had continuously requested additional funds from the 

DILG, the original Fund of ₱10 Million in the MOA remains not amended, and, to 

date, no supplemental agreement to the MOA was made. 

 

Based on the preceding, the Agency was not compliant with the provisions of 

the MOA and its IRR and may not have been efficient in disbursing the Interim 

Shelter Fund. 

 

(b) Delay in the liquidation of the Fund 

 

Section 14 of the IRR of the MOA between PCUP and DILG states that “the 

PCUP shall submit liquidation reports to Informal Settler Families – Program 

Management Office (ISF-PMO) of DILG, particularly the Reports of Disbursement 

within the first week of the succeeding month.” 

 

Section 4.6 of COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994, provides 

that “within ten (10) days after the end of each month/end of the agreed period for 

the Project, the Implementing Agency shall submit the Report of Checks Issued and 

the Report of Disbursement to report the utilization of the funds.” 

 

Review of the reports submitted by the PCUP Accounting Unit to the DILG 

disclosed that the Agency had incurred delays in their submission of liquidation 

reports, as detailed in the following table: 
 

Year 
Covered Monthly 

Report 
Date Submitted 

No. of Days 

Delayed 

2017 September to December 03/16/2018 65 to 157 days 

2018 May to December 03/04/2019 53 to 267 days  

2019 None was submitted to the DILG 377 to 711 days 

2020 None was submitted to the DILG 11 to 346 days 
Note: Data are as at September 30, 2020 

 

Additionally, the DVs related to the Fund covering transactions from June 

2019 to September 2020 were only submitted to the Audit Team on December 29, 

2020. 

 

According to the Accountant, PCUP had emailed liquidation reports up to 

October 2020 to the DILG. These submissions were not however verified by the 

Audit Team. The Accountant also mentioned that the lack of personnel and the 

current skeletal work arrangement had caused the late submission of reports and 

records especially for CY 2020. Presently, the Accounting Unit is comprised only 

of four plantilla positions and two COS/JOs. 

 



53 

 

 

This delay in submitting reports and documents precluded the auditor from 

conducting timely review and audit of the said transactions and resulted in the 

Agency’s non-compliance with the provision of the MOA and its IRR. 

Consequently, the Agency was also denied the benefit of immediate and proper 

accounting and reporting of fund utilization. 

 

We recommended that Management: 

 

a. confer with the DILG the correct projection for the Fund’s administrative 
cost as well as the appropriate mechanisms for its efficient disbursement, 

and the need to amend or supplement the MOA and its IRR, if necessary; 

 

b. ensure that the Agency is compliant with the provisions of the MOA and 
its IRR for the benefit of the intended beneficiaries; 

 

c. require the Accounting personnel to exert more effort in the immediate 
liquidation of the Fund to ensure that it is appropriately disbursed, 

accounted for, and used only for its intended purpose, and to adhere with 

Section 14 of the IRR of the MOA and Section 4.6 of COA Circular No. 

94-013; and 

 

d. consider setting performance targets per personnel and study the need for 
manpower reassignment or augmentation. 

 

Management Comment: 

 

The needed amendments to the IRR were delayed because the PCUP changed 

leadership three times from CY 2017 to CY 2018, which inevitably affected the 

timeline of continuity of plans and programs. It recognized and acknowledged the 

costs incurred and the need to pursue more effective ways to undertake the 

disbursement, which also entailed improvements in the program’s MOA and IRR. 

 

In addition, the PCUP had an executive meeting with the DILG on January 

20, 2021, wherein the former agreed to pursue fund sourcing to provide the 

additional administrative cost of ₱11,335,647.00; and expedite the process at the 

cost of ₱1,308.00 (₱11,335,647.00/8,600 ISFs) per beneficiary. 

 

The Chief Accountant relayed that the delay in the submission of liquidation 

reports was due to the lack of personnel as the Accounting Unit was not 

complemented with additional personnel for the Interim Shelter Fund report 

preparation. He further commented that the Accounting Unit would exert extra 

effort in the immediate liquidation of the Fund while coordinating with the 

Management for the possible manpower reassignment or augmentation to ensure 

that targets set by the Accounting Unit for its personnel are complied with.

Payment of hazard pay without legal basis; erroneous use of account 

 

7. PCUP granted hazard pay without legal basis amounting to ₱20,121.93, 
contrary to Section 52 of the General Provisions (GP) of the General 

Appropriation Act (GAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2020. Moreover, various 

payments of hazard pay totaling ₱310,121.93 were erroneously recorded as 

Salaries and Wages expenses contradicting the revised RCA, Volume III of the 

GAM. 

 

Section 52 of the GP of the GAA for FY 2020 provides that “hazard pay shall 

be granted only to government personnel who are actually assigned to, and 

performing their duties in, strife-torn or embattled areas as may be determined and 

certified by the Secretary of National Defense and for the duration of such 

assignment.” 

 

The revised RCA, Volume III of the GA describes Hazard Pay as used to 

recognize the payment to government officials/employees assigned in difficult/ 

dangerous/strife-torn/embattled areas as certified by appropriate government body 

and to those whose lives are directly exposed to work conditions which may cause 

them injury/sickness/death/harmful change. 
 

Review of DV No. 101-20-02-0142 showed that PCUP granted hazard pay to 

a high-ranking official amounting to ₱20,121.93 without a legal basis. This was also 

an observation contained in CY 2019 Annual Audit Report where the disbursement 

lacked legal basis or supporting documentation that would show the validity of the 

claim, such as the certification from the Secretary of National Defense. The CY 

2019 observation was issued Notice of Disallowance (ND) No. 2020-001-

101(2019) in November 2020. 

 

Moreover, there were payments for hazard pay to employees who reported to 

work during the ECQ and MECQ period totaling ₱310,121.93, which were 

erroneously recorded under Salaries and Wages accounts. Of the ₱310,121.93, 

₱283,621.93 were charged to Salaries and Wages – Regular, while the remaining 

₱26,500.00 were charged to Salaries and Wages- Casual/Contractual. 

 

The Audit Team would like to emphasize that the recording of transactions 

should comply with the provisions of the International Public Sector Accounting 

Standards (IPSAS) and the GAM.  The validity and regularity of disbursements are 

based on the DBM rules and other pertinent laws, rules, and regulations. 

 

We reiterated our prior year’s recommendation that Management 

require the: 

 

a. Accounting Unit and the AFD to ensure that all grants of hazard pay are 
supported with complete documentation; 

 



55 

 

 

b. concerned Official to submit the certification from the Secretary of 
National Defense, otherwise, refund the amount of ₱20,121.93; and  

 

c. Accounting Unit to ensure that hazard pay transactions are recorded in 
the account Hazard Pay under the Other Compensation of the Personnel 

Services in accordance with the revised RCA. 
 

Management Comment: 

 

Management is in the process of discussing the matter on granting hazard pay 

with the concerned official and that related ND is under appeal. 

 

The Accountant committed to correct the erroneous recording of payments of 

hazard pay and ensure recording the same in the Hazard Pay account. 

 

 

Non-Compliance with pertinent Rules on Terminal Leave Benefits and Monetization of 

Leave Credits 

 

8. Leave monetization of ₱1,814,045.69 and terminal leave benefit of 
₱3,683,696.99 were processed and paid without adherence to the Omnibus 

Rules on Leave and without complete documentation necessary to determine 

the validity and regularity of the transactions as required under Section 4.6 of 

PD No. 1445. 

 

Section 22 of Rule XVI of the Omnibus Rules on Leave provides that 

“monetization of leave credits shall be allowed to Officials and employees who 

have accumulated 15 days of vacation leave credits. Provided that at least five (5) 

days is retained after monetization.” 

 

While Section 23 provides that “monetization of fifty percent (50%) or more 

of the accumulated leave credits may be allowed for valid and justifiable reasons 

such as health, medical and hospital needs, financial aid brought about by force 

majeure, educational needs of the employee and the immediate members of his/her 

family.” 

 

For CY 2020, PCUP paid terminal leave benefits and leave monetization of 

₱3,683,696.99 and ₱1,814,045.69, respectively, with deficiencies, as follows: 

 

(a) Non-observance of the 15-days accumulated vacation leave (VL) pre-requisite 
in the monetization of leave credits 

 

Evaluation of the payment for monetization of leave credits of PCUP 

employees for CY 2020 revealed that the following employees were allowed 

monetization despite having not met the 15-days accumulated VL balance: 

 



56 

 

 

Employee 
VL Before 

Monetization 

Monetized 

Leave Credits 

VL After 

Monetization 

Employee 1 10.93 25 (14.07) 

Employee 2 14.66 22 (7.34) 

Employee 3 11.25 10 1.25 

Employee 4 11.25 11 0.25 

Employee 5 11.25 10 1.25 

Employee 6 10.18 10 0.18 

Employee 7 10.91 15 (4.09) 

Employee 8 11.25 10 1.25 

Employee 9 14.09 21 (6.91) 

  

As a result, the five (5) days retention was also not met, and the unapplied 

monetized leave credits were charged to the employees’ sick leave (SL) credits, as 

discussed in the succeeding paragraphs. 

 

(b) Unjustified/erroneous granting of monetization of SL credits 
 

In light of Section 22, CSC Resolution No. 0034 dated January 5, 2000 

resolves that SL credits may be monetized if an employee has no available VL 

credits, in accordance with the general rule under Section 23 of the Omnibus Rules 

on Leave. 

 

The same CSC Resolution provides that what is allowed to be monetized as a 

general rule is the accumulated VL credits. Section 23, on the other hand, is an 

extraordinary measure to relieve an employee from financial difficulties that may be 

allowed only for valid and justifiable reasons subject to the discretion of the agency 

head and the availability of funds. Hence, Section 23 should be construed as an 

exception to the general rule. 

 

Further verification disclosed that 29 officials and employees, including the 

nine (9) employees in the preceding Table, were allowed to monetize more than 

their available VL credits, with the following details:

Employee 28 28.86 17.48 23 (5.52) 

Employee 29 28.5 14.09 21 (6.91) 

 

It can be construed that the monetized leave credits were applied to SL as the 

VL balance is not enough to cover the monetized leave. Examination of the leave 

cards confirmed that a portion of the monetized leaves were deducted from sick 

leave credits to maintain the required retention minimum of five (5) days VL and 

cover the remaining monetized leaves. 

 

However, the DV did not have the justification for the availment of the SL 

credits’ monetary value as required under Section 23, Rule XVI of the Omnibus 

Rules on Leave. 

 

(c) Incomplete supporting documents for monetization and terminal leave benefit 
claims 

 

Section 4.6 of PD No. 1445, and echoed under Section 5, Chapter 2, Volume I 

of the GAM, provides that “claims against government funds shall be supported 

with complete documentation.” 

 

Pertinent provisions of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012, 

concerning documentary requirements for payment of terminal leave benefits and 

monetization provide, among others, the following: 

 

5.13 Terminal Leave Benefits 
xxx 



58 

 

 

 Certified photocopy of employees leave card as at last 
date of service duly audited by the Personnel Division 

and COA/Certificate of leave credits issued by the

 Computation of terminal leave benefits duly 
signed/certified by the accountant 

xxx 

 

5.14 Monetization 
 Approved leave application (ten days) with leave credit 

balance certified by the Human Resource Office; and 

 Request for leave covering more than ten days duly 
approved by the Head of the Agency 

xxx 

 

Post audit of related DVs showed that payment for monetization and terminal 

leave benefits claims lacked the necessary supporting documents, as follows:

Thus, resulting in claims against government funds, which could not be 

validated and not supported with complete documentation. 



59 

 

 

We recommended that Management require: 

 

a. concerned personnel to submit the lacking documents as required under 
Items 5.13 and 5.14 of the COA Circular No. 2012-001 to establish the 

validity of the payment; 

 

b. Head of HRMU to regularly monitor/update the leave cards of officers 
and employees and recommend payment of monetization only to those 

with sufficient VL balances and justified SL balances; 

 

c. Head of HRMU and Accountant to refrain from processing/approving 
claims with incomplete documentation; and 

 

d. henceforth, to strengthen its internal control in the processing of claims 
such that claims shall not be processed and paid without the complete 

supporting documents to establish the validity thereof. 

 

Management Comment: 

 

The Chief Accountant relayed that Management paid the monetization of 

leave credits of the subject employees who have not met the 15-days accumulated 

VL pre-requisite in the monetization of leave credits based on Sec. 23 of Rule XVI 

of the Omnibus Rules on Leave and the CSC Resolution No. 0034. These bases 

provide the exceptions to the general rule under Section 22 of the Omnibus for 

cases with justifiable reasons such as health, medical and hospital needs, financial 

aid brought about by force majeure, educational needs of the employee and the 

immediate members of his/her family. 

 

Relative to the above, the Management submitted the application for leave 

monetization of the employees concerned, containing their justification for the 

monetization of fifty percent or more of their accumulated leave credits duly 

approved by the Head of the Agency. 

 

Moreover, the PCUP also submitted the lacking supporting documents for the 

payment of Terminal Leave Pay of retiring/retired employees. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

Management is informed that every disbursement of government funds should 

be supported with complete documentation as provided under Section 4 (6) of the 

PD No. 1445 for the Auditor to determine the validity and propriety thereof.

Inaccurate Employees’ Leave Credit Balances at PCUP-FODM 
 

9. The unclear policies on employee work hours and alternative work 
arrangement (AWA) had caused errors in the calculation of employees’ 

tardiness and undertime, affecting the accuracy and reliability of employees’ 

leave records and credit balances. 

 

Civil Service Form No. 48 or DTR requires the certification of the employee 

on the actual hours of work, which states that:  

 

I certify on my honor that the above is a true and correct report 

of the hours of work performed, record of which was made 

daily at the time of arrival and departure. 

 

The DTR records the employee’s daily logs in and out and likewise provides 

information relevant to performance appraisal and man-hours lost.  

 

Review of the submitted monthly DTR’s for the period January 1, 2020 to 

September 30, 2020 showed that two of six employees designated as in-place 

coordinators had some discrepancies in the computation of their undertimes, as 

follows:

  Total 3:15 8:50 5:35 

 

Upon inquiry with the Administrative Officer, we found that the original 

office work hours schedule for in-place area coordinators is 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM. 

However, the head of the Agency changed their schedule sometime in January 

2020. He allegedly told them, verbally, that the work hours schedule of in-place 

area coordinators will be changed to flexi-time of 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM.   

 

However, CSC MC No. 5, s.1997 emphasizes the promulgation of the 

Agency’s own internal rules and regulations on attendance and punctuality. Hence, 

policies made orally is not a reliable basis to establish employees’ work hours. 

 

Consequently, the verbal change of work hours schedule affected the 

computed vacation leave (VL) credits of the two (2) in-place area coordinators as 

of September 30, 2020, to wit:

The Agency adopted the combination of “work from home” and “skeleton 

workforce” AWA plan wherein each personnel shall comply with the 3-day per 

week reporting, in compliance with the Office Memorandum Loc No. 22-2020 

dated May 15, 2020.  

 

In the original policy on work hours, the Regional Office has a flexi-time 

schedule of 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM. However, during the 3-day work duty of the 

personnel, some employees timed-in beyond 9:00 AM and timed-out not earlier 

than 3:30 PM and no computation of tardy/undertime was recorded in the DTR and 

Leave Cards. Also, the memorandum did not specify the reporting hours or 

shortened work duration of the employees.  

 

The unclear policies on work hours and AWA had caused the discrepancies in 

the employees’ leave credit balances; thus records are inaccurate and unreliable. 

 

 

 



62 

 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a. establish clear-cut guidelines on the work hours of in-place area 
coordinators and in the alternative work arrangement plan; 

 

b. direct the Personnel-in-Charge to immediately adjust the leave credits of 
the personnel concerned in order to reflect the accurate balance; and 

 

c. direct the Administrative Officer to exercise her review function over the 
Personnel-In-Charge’s work to ensure accurate reporting of the number 

of work hours performed by the employees, including the number of hours 

or minutes of tardiness, undertimes, and absences.

10. During the year, the PCUP did not receive funds for NTF-ELCAC or utilize any of 
its funds for the purpose. 

 

 

COVID-19 Releases and Utilization 

 

11. PCUP was not a recipient of the COVID-19 fund; however, the PCUP-Central 
Office incurred a total of ₱1,231,869.61 for hazard pay, COVID-related trainings, 

supplies and fuel/gas consumption, while PCUP-FOD Mindanao expended Hazard 

Pay amounting to ₱38,000.00. 

 

(a) PCUP-Central Office 
 

The Audit Team found no deficiencies in the PCUP-Central Office 

expenditure of ₱1,231,869.61 except for the incorrect use of account, for Hazard 

Pay, which was communicated to Management through an AOM.  The details of the

COVID-19 Hazard Pay amounting to ₱38,000.00 were paid to personnel who 

were not authorized to physically report for work during the period of ECQ, in 

violation of DBM-BC No. 2020-1 dated March 24, 2020; thus, payments were 

considered invalid. 

 

Section 4 of DBM Budget Circular (BC) No. 2020-1 dated March 24, 2020 on 

the Guidelines on the Grant of the COVID-19 Hazard Pay provides that: 

 

The heads of government agencies may grant the COVID-19 

Hazard Pay to their personnel/workers without the need for 

further approval by the Department of Budget and Management 

(DBM), subject to the following guidelines and conditions: 

 

xxx 

4.3. The personnel/workers have been authorized to physically 
report for work at their respective offices or work stations 

on the prescribed official working hours by the head of 

agency/office during the period of implementation of 

Enhanced Community Quarantine measures in the area of 

such office or work station. 

 

During the period of ECQ, the Agency granted COVID-19 Hazard Pay to its 

personnel. However, upon reviewing the DVs, we found that a total amount of 

₱38,000.00 was paid to personnel who were not authorized to report for work 

physically. Details of payment are as follows:

64 

 

 

The payment of COVID-19 Hazard Pay to the regular and job order 

employees was invalid due to the lack of authority to physically report for work – 

this being one of the requirements for the grant of said hazard pay per Section 4.3 of 

DBM BC No. 2020-1 

 

Per inquiry, the Administrative Officer was not aware of this requirement. 

However, they have attached the following supporting documents for the claim of 

COVID-19 Hazard Pay, to wit:  

 

 Daily Time Records (DTRs);  

 Executive Orders; 

 Alternative Work Arrangement (AWA) and Grant of Hazard Duty Pay 
Memoranda; 

 Certificate of Appearance; and  

 Certification in securing Work Quarantine Pass. 
 

The authority to physically report for work is one of the requirements in the 

grant of COVID-19 Hazard Pay to personnel. The payments made despite lack of 

authority does not conform with government guidelines.  

 

We recommended that Management immediately submit a written 

justification on the payment of COVID-19 Hazard Pay to unauthorized 

personnel, otherwise demand the refund of the amount received by them. 
 

Management Comment: 

 

Management justified that the Alternative Working Arrangement (AWA) 

Memorandum and the working pass certification are the documents they made to 

support the hazard duty pay claims since they have not read the DBM-BC No. 

2020-1 dated March 24, 2020.  

 

Moreover, Management also justified that the employees were needed in the 

office and that the work from home arrangement was not possible due to the 

limitations of their PC’s and because most of their work are done manually.  

 

The Management assured the audit team of their full compliance with the 

audit recommendation. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

The Audit Team emphasizes that the rationale behind the authorization given 

to employees during the ECQ to work in the office physically is to prevent the 

transmission of COVID19. Moreover, this is also in compliance with the IATF 

guidelines.  

 



65 

 

 

Since Management justified that the employees who claimed the hazard pay 

were indeed needed in the office physically, we recommended that they submit the 

authority to work to support this justification. 

 

 

Dormant Accounts  

 

12. The ₱317,910.25 balance of the Other Receivable account had been inactive for 
over 10 years. Of the amount, ₱313,960.25 pertains to unliquidated cash advances 

from 28 separated and deceased Officers and employees. Management had already 

sent demand letters but was unsuccessful. These advances had been outstanding 

from 6 to over 31 years and may be deemed unrecoverable by the Agency.  

 

 

Gender and Development Program (GAD) 

 

13. PCUP had not endorsed nor submitted its CY 2020 GAD Plan and Budget 
(GPB) and its Accomplishment Report (AR) to the Philippine Commission on 

Women (PCW) and DBM pursuant to Sections 8.2 and 8.7 of the PCW-NEDA-

DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01. Moreover, the GAD Budget is below the five 

percent requirement embodied in Section 31 of the GP of RA No. 11465 or the 

GAA for the FY 2020. 

 

Section 31 of the GP of RA No. 11465 states that “all agencies of the 

government shall formulate a GAD Plan designed to address gender issues within 

their concerned sectors or mandate and implement the applicable provisions under 

R.A. No. 9710 or the Magna Carta of Women. The GAD Plan shall be integrated 

into the agencies’ regular activities, which shall be at least five percent (5%) of their 

budgets. For this purpose, activities currently being undertaken by agencies which 

relates to GAD or those that contribute to poverty alleviation, economic 

empowerment especially of marginalized women, protection, promotion, and 

fulfilment of women’s human rights, and practice of gender-responsive governance 

are considered sufficient compliance with said requirement.” 

 

Related provisions of PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01 are as 

follows: 

 

8.2   xxx. The GFPS shall then submit the final GPBs and the 

corresponding GAD ARs to PCW for review and 

endorsement to DBM. 

 

8.7   Agencies shall submit their PCW-endorsed GPB to DBM 

along with their annual GAD AR for the previous year in 

accordance with the budget call. 

 



66 

 

 

In April 2021, PCUP submitted the advance copies of its CY 2020 GPB and 

GAD AR. These reports were not approved by the Head of the Agency and, 

accordingly, not endorsed/submitted to PCW and DBM. Evaluation of these reports 

showed the following:

1.24% of the CY 2020 total new 

appropriations of ₱178,388,000.00 

 

Verification of the disbursements disclosed that PCUP incurred GAD-related 

expenses totaling only ₱33,090.00 or 0.019 percent of the total appropriations of 

₱178,388,000.00, which is less than 5 percent of the CY 2020 total budget of the 

Agency.  

 

As a result, PCUP had not been compliant with the provisions or rules related 

to GAD planning, implementation, and reporting. Moreover, the late submission of 

the GPB and GAD AR precluded the Audit Team from conducting timely 

evaluation/verification and audit of GAD funds and activities. 

 

We reiterated our previous recommendations and Management agreed 

to: 

 

a. ensure compliance with the requirements of the PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint 
Circular No. 2012-01, which prescribes the endorsement and submission 

of the GPBs and GAD ARs to PCW and DBM; and 

 

b. allocate an amount of at least five percent of the Agency’s total 
appropriation for the implementation of GAD plans, in accordance with 

the GP of the GAA. 

 

 

Programs for Senior Citizen and Persons with Disability 

 

14. For CY 2020, PCUP had allotted ₱357,070.80 for its plans and activities related to 
Senior Citizens (SCs) and Persons with Disability (PWDs) in compliance with 

Section 32 of the GP of RA No. 11465, as shown below:

Capacity Building on PWDs and SCs 95,570.80 

PWD Affairs Committee 10,000.00 

Total 357,070.80 

 

Due to the pandemic, the above activities were not carried out, nor has the 

Agency submitted its Accomplishment Reports for the same. 

 

 

Disaster Risk Reduction and Management (DRRM) and Climate Change Adaptation 

and Mitigation (CCAM) 

 

15. PCUP had planned activities and set aside funds for its risk reduction, climate 
change adaptation, and mitigation measures in compliance with Section 36 of the 

GP of the GAA of FY 2020, as follows: 

 

Programs/Activities Budget 

DRRM and Climate Change capacity building 467,600.00 

Production of CCAM-DRRM AVP materials for PCUP online training 30,000.00 

Production of IEC materials on COVID-19 pandemic 30,000.00

Total 607,600.00 

 

However, due to the pandemic, most of the above activities were not carried 

out, and the Agency has not submitted its Accomplishment Reports for the same. 

 

 

Compliance with Tax Laws, RA No. 8291 (GSIS), RA No. 9679 (Pag-IBIG), RA No.

16. PCUP had an aggregate ₱393,373.39 unaccounted and unremitted balance 
from Due to BIR, Due to GSIS, Due to Pag-IBIG, and Due to PhilHealth.  

Moreover, the agency failed to withhold taxes on various payments totaling

Note: CY 2020 and 2019 balances are net of remittances made in January 2021 and January 2020, respectively. 

 

Among the audit recommendations contained in the CY 2019 AAR was for 

the Management to require the Chief Accountant to monitor and reconcile the 

deductions and remittances to avoid under remittances. However, except for Due to 

GSIS, instead of reducing the amounts of unaccounted and unremitted balances, 

these increased by 83 to 171.3 percent. 

 

(b) failure to withhold taxes on various payments totaling ₱242,230.00 
 

Post-audit of various DVs showed that payments for honoraria of resource

 Section 4.114-2 (a) of Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 13-2018 provides that 

“the Government or any of its political subdivisions, instrumentalities or agencies 

shall, before making payment on account of each purchase of goods and services 

which are subject to the value-added tax, deduct and withhold a final value-added 

tax at the rate of five percent (5%) of the gross payment thereof.”
