EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 

 

A. Introduction 
 

The Presidential Commission for the Urban Poor (PCUP) was established 

under Executive Order (EO) No. 82, dated December 8, 1986, to serve as a direct 

link of the urban poor to the government in policy formulation and program 

implementation addressed to their needs. In October 2018, the PCUP was 

transferred from the Office of the President to the Department of Social Welfare 

and Development (DSWD) pursuant to EO No. 67, dated October 31, 2018. 

 

Its functions and responsibilities are to: 

 

1) coordinate the speedy implementation of government policies and programs for 
the urban poor; 

2) set up a consultative mechanism which shall provide a forum for continuing 
dialogue between the government and the urban poor on the proper planning 

and evaluation of programs and projects affecting them; 

3) accredit legitimate urban poor organizations for purposes of representation in 
the formulation of recommendations to the President; 

4) review existing legislation, policies and programs of the government relating to 
the Urban Poor, in consultation with the latter, and recommend appropriate 

actions thereon to the President; 

5) evaluate post and on-going shelter-related projects of the government in 
squatter and resettlement areas in consultation with beneficiary communities, 

and recommend appropriate action thereon to the President; 

6) help coordinate the various activities and services being rendered by different 
government organizations/non-government organizations for the Urban Poor; 

7) plan and monitor programs and projects for the development of urban poor 
communities in coordination with agencies involved; 

8) request the assistance of any ministry, bureau, office or agency in the 
performance of its functions; 

9) facilitate the funding of urban poor programs and projects both from foreign 
and domestic fund sources; and 

10) perform such other functions as may be authorized by the President of the 
Philippines. 

 

The PCUP is presently headed by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 

Alvin S. Feliciano and assisted by four Commissioners, while each of the PCUP’s 

three Field Operations Divisions (Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao) is headed by a 

Director. 

 

As at December 31, 2020, PCUP is complemented by 252 personnel, 

composed of 148 plantilla positions, and 104 staffs hired under casual and contract 

of service.

D. Scope of Audit 
 

The audit covered the accounts and operations of the PCUP for the period 

ended December 31, 2020. The audit was conducted to: (a) ascertain the level of 

assurance that may be placed on the Management’s assertion on the financial 

statements; (b) determine the propriety of transactions as well as extent of 

compliance with pertinent laws, rules and regulations; and (c) determine the extent 

of implementation of prior year’s audit recommendations. Moreover, the audit was 

conducted in accordance with the International Standards of Supreme Audit 

Institutions (ISSAIs). 

 

 

E. Independent Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements 
 

The Auditor rendered an adverse opinion on the fairness of presentation of 

the financial statements of PCUP as at December 31, 2020 in view of the material 

accounting errors and deficiencies as enumerated below: 

 

1. The recorded irregularly processed payment of undelivered equipment 
resulted in the overstatement of the accounts Information and Communication 

Technology Equipment (ICTE) and Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) by 

₱4,967,040.00. (Paragraph No. 1); 

 

2. Misstatements in the Inventory accounts caused by the non-recognition of 
issued Semi-Expendable Properties (SEPs) with an aggregate amount of 

₱3,216,572.67 and non-recording of issued Office Supplies Inventory (OSI). 

(Paragraph No. 2); 

 

3. The erroneous recording in CY 2020 of prior period disbursements totaling 
₱558,985.24 resulted in the overstatement of various Expenses and 

Accumulated Surplus/Deficit accounts. (Paragraph No. 3); and 

 

4. Non-preparation and non-submission of separate financial statements for its 
Trust Receipts/Inter-Agency Transferred Funds or non-reporting of account 

balances related to trust receipts totaling ₱429,422,011.52, adversely the fair 

presentation of the Agency’s financial statements (Paragraph No. 4).

F.  Other Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations  
 

The following are the other significant audit observations and the 

corresponding recommendations, which were discussed with Management officials 

concerned during the exit conference on April 23, 2021, details of which are 

discussed in Part II of this report. Management views and comments were 

incorporated in the report, where appropriate. 

  

1. There were lapses in the control of accountability of the Property, Plant and 
Equipment (PPE)  and Inventory items which included, among others, the non-

issuance of Property Acknowledgment Receipt (PAR) for issued ICTE and 

Office Equipment (OE) totaling ₱4,161,251.01 and non-submission of Report 

on the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) and Report on the Physical Count 

of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) and incomplete PPE Ledger Card 

(PPELC) data that resulted in the non-establishment of accountabilities and the 

exposure of the PPEs and inventories to the risk of being stolen, lost or misused. 

(Paragraph No. 2) 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the: 

 

a. Supply, Property and General Services Unit (SPGSU) to: (i) immediately 
prepare the Inventory Custodian Slip (ICS) and Report of Supplies and 

Materials Issued (RSMI) for the prior issued SEPs and office supplies and 

submit them to the Accounting Unit; (ii) periodically submit accomplished 

ICS to the Accounting Unit for timely posting/recording and ensure that 

duly-accomplished ICS should accompany every issuance of SEPs to 

establish accountabilities on them; (iii) ascertain that all issuances of 

inventories are supported with Requisition and Issue Slip (RIS), summarized 

in a monthly RSMIs, and periodically submit them to Accounting Unit for 

recording; and (iv) ensure that accountabilities over the PPEs are established 

and all issued properties are duly supported by PAR; 

 

b. SPGSU and Accounting Unit to coordinate and conduct periodic 
reconciliation of balances and records of properties and inventories; 

 

c. Accounting Unit to (i) include all the property of the Agency, regardless of 
location, in the PPE Ledger Card (PPELC); and (ii) adjust the affected 

accounts in the books upon receipt of the ICS and RSMIs from the SPGSU; 

and 

 

d. Inventory Committee to ensure the periodic conduct of physical count of 
inventories and PPEs, and prepare and submit the Report on the Physical 

Count of Inventories (RPCI) and Report on the Physical Count of Property, 

Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) as prescribed by GAM for NGAs. 

 



 

v 

 

2. Claims against government funds aggregating ₱4,344,254.69 were paid without 
complete documentation necessary to determine its validity and regularity, and 

accuracy, as required under Section 4.6 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 144, 

and service contracts were not notarized/improperly notarized and were 

submitted late. (Paragraph No. 3) 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a. refrain from processing claims with incomplete documentation in 
compliance with Section 4(6) of PD 1445 and prescribed documentary 

requirements under COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012; and 

 

b. ensure that contracts of the Contract of Service/Job Order (COS/JO) 
personnel are submitted within the prescribed period in conformity with the 

provisions of COA Circular 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009, while 

ascertaining that all contracts are notarized before the stipulated 

commencement of the COS/JO’s service. 

 

3. The inadequate controls in the grant, utilization, liquidation, and monitor of 
cash advances (CAs) to various SDOs aggregating ₱2,924,568.43 resulted in: 

(a) the delays in liquidation ranging from six to 411 days; (b) incomplete 

supporting documents of liquidation reports of expenditures amounting to 

₱746,301.18; (c) grant of CAs in excess of maximum cash accountability 

(MCA) and Agency’s authorized CA amount; (d) unnecessary expenditures 

amounting to ₱90,234.19; and (e) other noted deficiencies exposed the 

government funds to risk of loss and misappropriation or misuse. (Paragraph 

No. 5) 

 

We recommended that Management: 

 

a. require all concerned SDOs to: (i) justify their failure to observe timely 
settlements of CAs and the incurrence of unnecessary expenditures 

amounting to ₱90,234.19; and (ii) submit liquidation reports with complete 

documentary requirements to settle their unliquidated CAs as soon as the 

purpose for which these were given have been served; 

 

b. impose sanctions as provided under the Civil Service Commission (CSC) 
Memorandum Circular No. 23, s. 2019 and CSC Resolution No. 1900929 to 

erring officials and employees who failed to liquidate their cash advances 

within the prescribed period and upon demand; 

 

c. intensify the monitoring of controls on cash advances by directing the 
Accountant to: (i) strictly monitor CAs and regularly remind/require the 

liquidation of a previous cash advance, or the proper accounting thereof, 

before another cash advance is granted to an SDO; (ii) ensure that the grant 

and liquidation of CA are supported with complete documentation and 



 

vi 

 

should not accept liquidation reports that are not adequately documented; 

(iii) ascertain that SDOs are not granted additional CAs beyond the 

maximum cash accountability and the authorized amount of CA by the 

agency; and (iv) stop the practice of paying cash on purchases that should be 

appropriately paid thru checks; and 

 

d. require the Accountant to review/correct discrepancies on book postings and 
negative balances in the subsidiary ledger. 

 

4. PCUP spent administrative costs of ₱8,861,858.85, which was more than the 
budgeted amount, resulting in approximate excess costs of ₱7,083,024.57 with 

an accomplishment rate of only 17.79 percent or 2,022 paid Informal Settler 

Families (ISFs) out of 11,367 targeted ISFs. Moreover, the agency incurred 11 

to 711 days of delay in its submission of liquidation report, contrary to the 

provision of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of the 

Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between the Agency and the DILG, and 

Section 4.6 of COA Circular No. 94-013. (Paragraph No. 6) 

 

We recommended that Management: 

 

a. confer with the DILG the correct projection for the Fund’s administrative 
cost as well as the appropriate mechanisms for its efficient disbursement, 

and the need to amend or supplement the MOA and its IRR, if necessary; 

 

b. ensure that the Agency is compliant with the provisions of the MOA and its 
IRR for the benefit of the intended beneficiaries; 

 

c. require the Accounting personnel to exert more effort in the immediate 
liquidation of the Fund to ensure that it is appropriately disbursed, 

accounted for, and used only for its intended purpose, and to adhere with 

Section 14 of the IRR of the MOA and Section 4.6 of COA Circular No. 94-

013; and 

 

d. consider setting performance targets per personnel and study the need for 
manpower reassignment or augmentation. 

  

5. Leave monetization of ₱1,814,045.69 and terminal leave benefit of 
₱3,683,696.99 were processed and paid without adherence to the Omnibus 

Rules on Leave and without complete documentation necessary to determine the 

validity and regularity of the transactions as required under Section 4.6 of PD 

No. 1445. (Paragraph No. 8) 

 

 



 

vii 

 

We recommended that Management require: 

a. concerned personnel to submit the lacking documents as required under 
Items 5.13 and 5.14 of the COA Circular No. 2012-001 to establish the 

validity of the payment; 

 

b. Head of Human Resource Management Unit (HRMU) to regularly 
monitor/update the leave cards of officers and employees and recommend 

payment of monetization only to those with sufficient VL balances and 

justified SL balances; 

 

c. Head of HRMU and Accountant to refrain from processing/approving 
claims with incomplete documentation; and 

 

d. Henceforth, to strengthen its internal control in the processing of claims 
such that claims shall not be processed and paid without the complete 

supporting documents to establish the validity thereof. 

 

 

G. Implementation of Prior Year’s Recommendations   
 

Of the 54 audit recommendations embodied in the 2019 Annual Audit 

Report (AAR), 31 were implemented and 23 were not implemented. Of the 31 

implemented recommendations, 10 were passed due to absence of the underlying 

conditions as brought by the COVID-19 pandemic, while the 23 not implemented 

recommendations were reiterated in Part II of this report. The details are 

presented in Part III of this report.
