 PART II – OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS  
 

Financial Audit  

 

Accounting Errors and Omissions 
 

1. The asset and equity accounts of the Metals Industry Research and 
Development Center (MIRDC) had misstatements totaling ₱2,194,917.13 and 

₱1,771,256.53 which represent 0.19 percent and 0.27 percent of its total assets 

and equity, respectively. Due to the significant impact of such misstatements on 

the reported balances of the affected accounts, Management’s assertions as to 

the accuracy, existence, classification and completeness of the said accounts 

could not be relied upon.  

 

2. Paragraph 15 of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards 
(IPSAS) 1 and Section 3, Chapter 19 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), 
Volume I, states that “Financial statements are a structured representation of the 
financial position and financial performance of an entity. The objectives of general 

purpose financial statements are to provide information about the financial position, 

financial performance and cash flows of an entity that is useful to a wide range of 

users in making and evaluating decisions about the allocation of resources.” The 
standards further state that specifically, the objectives of the general purpose financial 
reporting in the public sector should be to provide information useful for decision 
making, and to demonstrate the accountability of the entity for the resources entrusted 
to it. 

 
3. Paragraph 27 of the IPSAS provides that Financial Statements (FSs) shall 
present fairly the financial position, financial performance, and cash flows of an 
entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of 
transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with the definitions and 
recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses set out in IPSASs. 
The application of IPSASs, with additional disclosures when necessary, is presumed 
to result in FSs that achieve a fair presentation. 

 
4. Moreover, Sections 111 and 112 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 require 
agencies to keep the accounts in such detail as necessary to meet the needs of the 
agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal 
or control agencies of the government; and that the highest standard of honesty, 
objectivity and consistency shall be observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard 
against inaccurate and misleading information. Each government agency shall record 
its financial transactions and operations conformably with IPSAS and in accordance 
with pertinent laws and regulations. 
 
5. Our audit revealed various accounting errors/omissions resulting in 
misstatements in account balances reported in the FSs of the MIRDC and affecting 
Management’s assertions that all transactions and events: should be recorded and 



47 
 

have been recorded (Completeness), were recorded without error (Accuracy), and in 
the proper accounts (Classification) as summarized in Table 1.

6. Bank Reconciliation Statement (BRS) is a report that compares the bank 
balance as per Agency’s accounting records with the balance stated in the bank 
statement.  The purpose of preparing a BRS is to detect any discrepancy between the 
accounting records of the entity and the bank due to normal timing differences.  Such 
discrepancies might exist due to an error on the part of the agency or the bank. 

 
7. Section 15, Chapter 2 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), 
Volume I provides that the Financial Statements (FSs) shall present fairly the 
financial position, financial performance and cash flows of an entity. Fair 
presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other 
events, and conditions in accordance with the definitions and the recognition criteria 
for assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in IPSAS. The application of 



48 
 

IPSAS, with appropriate disclosures, if necessary, would result in fair presentation of 
the FS. 

 
8. Review of the Subsidiary Ledgers (SL) vis-à-vis BRSs revealed that LBP 
Current Account No. 1822-1027-15 has reconciling items with net amount of 
₱2,854.45, consisting of unrecorded deposits and bank interest.  The Accounting 
Office failed to take these up in the books of accounts due to the delayed receipt of 
bank statements, thereby defeating one of the purposes of the BRS and understating 
the Cash in Bank - Local Currency, Current Account (LCCA) and Accumulated 
Surplus/(Deficit) account by ₱2,854.45.  

 
9. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant 
to: 
 

a. take up reconciling items in the books of accounts as they appear in 
the BRS in order to reflect the correct balances of the account; and 
 

b. henceforth, secure monthly bank statements immediately by making 
a request to the depository bank to furnish the agency with bank 

statements at least five (5) days after the end of each month. 
 

b) Unrecorded expenses - ₱1,983,086.83 

 
10. Chapter 3 of the GAM, Volume III provides the description of the Other 
Deposits (19903990) account, that is, it is used to recognize the amount of deposits 
not falling under any of the specific deposit accounts, and this account is credited for 
the expended amount. 

 
11. Examination of the Other Deposits account revealed that accounting records 
showed a General Ledger Balance (GL) in the total amount of ₱5,248,306.83 as at 
December 31, 2020, as shown in the herein Table 2:

12. Based on the above Table, the amount of ₱1,983,086.83 was the cash advance 
payment for the estimated cost of the project with the facilities of the Manila Electric 
Company (MERALCO).  Verification of the project documents, however, showed 
that in September 2016, the Agency entered into an Agreement for Extension of Lines 
and/or Additional Facilities with MERALCO for the installation of single-metering 
transformer vault for the upgrading of the electrical system of the MWS 1 building 
of MIRDC. 

 
13. Section 1.1 of the agreement between the MIRDC and MERALCO provides 
that the customer shall pay to MERALCO the estimated cost of the project in the 
amount of ₱1,983,086.83, Philippine currency, upon signing of the agreement.  While 
Section 1.2 of the same agreement further provides that the MERALCO shall conduct 
an accounting of the total cost of the project which is the subject of the agreement 
within six (6) months from the date of energization of the service. In case of any 
excess or deficiency in the project cost, MERALCO shall notify the customer within 
the same period and shall correspondingly refund or collect the difference to/from the 
customer. 

 
14. Taking into account the period within which MERALCO shall notify the 
MIRDC of the total cost of the project and the Management’s inaction for the timely 
correction of the account through analysis and/or reconciliatory process, the cash 
advances of ₱1,983,086.83 as the actual project cost had not been recorded in the 
books of MIRDC as expenditures for the period of its applicability. Management 
explained that they waited for the notification from the MERALCO until they have 
forgotten to prepare the necessary adjustments. 

 
15. With this failure, the project cost was not accounted for as expenses; thus, the 
Other Deposits and Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) accounts had been overstated by 
the same amount of ₱1,983,086.83 since CY 2016, which defeats the objective of the 
general purpose of financial reporting to the public sector in accordance with Section 
15, Chapter 2 of the GAM, Volume I, and Chapter 3 of the same Manual by not 
faithfully representing the effects of transaction. 
 
16. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to 
record the affected accounts by debiting Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) and 
crediting Other Deposits, both in the same amount of P1,983,086.83, to present 
the correct nature of the accounts in the financial statements.  

 

17. Moreover, the Accountant shall review every non-moving account 
balance in the FS and ensure that these were properly accounted for or if any of 

these need adjustment in the books for fair presentation of the accounts in the 

financial statements.

c) Outright expense of inventory - ₱208,975.85 
 
18. Section 9, Chapter 8 of the GAM, Volume I provides: “Perpetual Inventory 
Method.  Supplies and materials purchased for inventory purpose shall be recorded 
using the perpetual inventory system, resulting in a more accurate inventory records 
and a running total for the cost of goods sold in each period. The system requires 
accounting records to show the amount of inventory on hand at all times through the 
maintenance of the Supply Ledger Card (SLC) by the Accounting Unit and Stock 
Card (SC) by the Property and Supply Division/Unit for each item in stock. Regular 
purchases shall be coursed through the inventory account and issues thereof shall be 
recorded as they take place except for supplies and materials purchased out of Petty 
Cash Fund (PCF) for immediate use or on emergency cases which shall be charged 
directly to the appropriate expense accounts.” 

 
19. The various inventory items procured for CY 2020 amounting to 
₱2,933,057.52 were directly charged to Expense account instead of coursing the same 
to the Inventory account, contrary to the Perpetual Inventory Method.   Records 
showed that in December 2020, of the said inventory, the agency recorded office 
supplies procured from the Procurement Service - Department of Budget and 
Management (PS-DBM) amounting to P208,975.85 under JEV No. 2020-12-002300 
dated December 31, 2021, which were found to be either in the custody of the end-
users or still in their respective stockrooms; thus, overstating Office Supplies Expense 
and understating Office Supplies Inventory with the same amount as at year-end. 
 
20. While it is true that Management was complying with the forms to be 
prepared and/or maintained such as the Requisition Issue Slip (RIS) and the Report 
of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI), among others, as attachments to the 
Disbursement Voucher (DV) upon purchase, it still could not rectify the non-
compliance with the above provisions. 
 
21. Consequently, the concerned personnel of the Property and the Accounting 
Sections failed to monitor, control and record the acquisitions and issuances of 
inventories in their respective records of SC and SLC, respectively.  This persistent 
practice may result in: (a) overstocking of supplies and materials distributed to 
different MIRDC offices which may be excessive of what is needed and may not 
suitably address the requirements of the agency; and (b) shortage of supplies, which 
could hamper its operations. 
 

22. We recommended and Management agreed to require: 
 

a. The Accountant to: 
 

i. monitor, control and record the purchases of inventories to the 
appropriate Inventory account and issuances thereof as expense 

as they take place based on the RSMI; and 

 



51 
 

ii. maintain SLCs for each inventory item; and 
 

b. The Property Officer to: 
 

i. monitor and control the issuance of inventories to end-users by 
releasing only what are actually needed and thereafter, provide 

the Accountant RSMIs for issued items; and 

 

ii. maintain a record of acquisitions and issuances of procured items 
from the PS-DBM for monitoring and reconciliation. 

 
Accounting Deficiencies 
 
Unremitted trust receipts to BTr – ₱1,162,503.66 

 

23. The Cash in Bank - LCCA account with SL balance of ₱1,162,503.66 was 
not remitted to the BTr, contrary to Section 2 of Executive Order No. 338 and 

Section 4 of the General Provisions of the FY 2020 General Appropriations Act 

(GAA), thus, depriving the national government of the proper disposition of 

these funds. 

 

24. Section 2 of Executive Order (EO) No. 338 s. 1996, directing the Deposit of 
Cash Balances to the National Treasury, provides that “all government offices and 
agencies are hereby required to immediately transfer all public moneys deposited 
with depository banks and other institutions to the Bureau of the Treasury (BTR), 
regardless of income source.” 
 
25. Section 4 of the General Provisions of the FY 2020 GAA provides that “as a 
general rule, all fees, charges, assessments, and other receipts or revenues collected 
by departments, bureaus and offices of the National Government, including 
Constitutional Offices enjoying fiscal autonomy in the exercise of their mandated 
functions, at such rates as are now or may be approved by the appropriate approving 
authority shall be deposited with the National Treasury as income of the General 
Fund pursuant to Section 44, Chapter 5, Book VI of EO No. 292, s. 1987 and Section 
65 of P.D. No. 1445.”  Section 7 thereof further provides that performance bonds and 
deposits filed or posted by private persons or entities with departments, bureaus, 
offices and instrumentalities of the National Government, including Constitutional 
Offices enjoying fiscal autonomy and SUCs shall be deposited with the National 
Treasury and recorded as trust receipts in accordance with EO No. 338, as 
implemented by COA-DBM-DOF Joint Circular No. 1-97, and such other guidelines 
issued thereon. 
 
26. The Permanent Committee Joint Circular No. 4-2012 dated September 12, 
2012, defines unauthorized accounts as cash account balances maintained by 
agencies without specific authority or legal basis.  Item 5.5.1 thereof requires the 



52 
 

immediate transfer to the National Treasury of the cash balances of the unauthorized 

accounts. 
 

27. We noted that the agency maintains the following bank accounts with the 
Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) - Bicutan, Taguig City branch, with balances 
totaling ₱2,078,815.62 as at December 31, 2020:

Performance/Security Deposits and Payroll ATM for Job 
Order employee 

1,926,085.92 

 Total 2,078,815.62 

 
28. Verification of LBP account no. 1822-1027-15 revealed that it is composed 
of the deposits for the collection of the proceeds from sale of bid documents and the 
payroll account for the Job Order personnel.  In CYs 2015 and 2016, this bank 
account was also the repository of funds transferred from other government agencies 
and other trust receipts.  Further, examination of the Subsidiary Ledger (SL) showed 
an outstanding balance of ₱1,162,503.66, representing the net excess of BAC 
honoraria, payroll and trust receipts as at December 31, 2020. 
 
29. Despite its existence, we found that the agency has no specific authority to 
maintain the said bank account outside the National Treasury and the deposits had 
remained in the bank, unremitted, despite the continuous reminder of the yearly GAA 
provisions that all government offices and agencies are hereby required to 
immediately transfer all public moneys deposited with depository banks and other 

institutions to the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr), regardless of income source.  
 
30. Management averred that the difficulty of requesting a Notice of Cash 
Allocation (NCA) from the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) made it practical for the 
agency to retain a bank account for trust receipts from the sale of bid documents and 
Performance/Security Deposits, which may be utilized for the payment of honoraria 
of the BAC and/or refunds to contractors/suppliers instead of requesting for NCA.   
 
31. With the Management emphasis on the accessibility of funds, it can be 
presumed that Management had not been faithful in supporting the wisdom behind 
the rules on Section 2 of Executive Order No. 338 and Section 4 of the General 
Provisions of the FY 2020 General Appropriations Act (GAA), that is - the remittance 
to the National Treasury is necessary to allow the national government to oversee the 
proper disposition of government funds. 
 



53 
 

32. We recommended and Management agreed to: 

a. cause the immediate transfer of all trust receipts to the BTr, including 
excess funds from the BAC honoraria, pursuant to the above 

provisions of laws, rules and regulations; and 

b. henceforth, remit all collections to the BTr regardless of income 
source, in compliance with the issued rules and regulations affecting 

the said accounts. 

No Inventory Accounting System - ₱2,933,057.52 

 

33. Management failed to maintain Inventory Accounting System for its 
supplies and materials for inventory purposes, mainly due to: (a) direct 

issuances to end-users right after delivery; and (b) non-provision of central 

stock/storage rooms. As such, the validity, accuracy and existence of the 

balances of the affected accounts could not be ascertained; thus, transactions 

presented in the FS are deemed doubtful.  

 

34. Section 9, Chapter 8 of the GAM, Volume I, provides: “Perpetual Inventory 
Method. Supplies and materials purchased for inventory purpose shall be recorded 
using the perpetual inventory system, resulting in a more accurate inventory records 
and a running total for the cost of goods sold in each period. The system requires 
accounting records to show the amount of inventory on hand at all times through the 
maintenance of the Stock Ledger Card (SLC) (Appendix 67) by the Accounting Unit 
and Stock Card (SC) (Appendix 68) by the Property and Supply Division/Unit for 
each item in stock. Regular purchases shall be coursed through the inventory account 
and issues thereof shall be recorded as they take place except for supplies and 
materials purchased out of Petty Cash Fund (PCF) for immediate use or on 
emergency cases which shall be charged directly to the appropriate expense 
accounts.” 
 
35. Likewise, Section 13, Volume I, of the same Manual, states: “Inventory 
Accounting System. The Inventory Accounting System consists of the system of 

monitoring, controlling and recording of acquisition and disposal of inventory. The 

system starts with the receipt of the purchased inventory items. The requesting office 

in need of the inventory items, after the Property and Supply Division/Unit has 

determined that the items are not available in stock, shall prepare and cause the 

approval of the Purchase Request (PR) (Appendix 60). Physical count/inventory, 

which is required semi-annually, is an indispensable procedure for checking the 

integrity of property custodianship.”(underscoring ours) 

 

36. Validation of the Agency’s Inventory Accounting System and transactions on 
the procurement of inventory items showed that the Inventory accounts has a P0.00 
balance while the various Supplies and Materials expense accounts have an aggregate 
GL balance of ₱3,491,416.65 as at December 31, 2020. The Team noted the 



54 
 

following deficiencies that affected the validity, accuracy, and existence of the 
reported balances: 
 

a) Direct issuance of procured office supplies to end-users -₱2,933,057.52 

37. For CY 2020, purchases of various inventory items amounting to 
₱2,933,057.52 were immediately issued to end-users upon delivery.  These were 
evident as the prepared RSMI and RIS were the supporting documents to the DV, as 
summarized in Table 4. 
 
   Table 4. Summary of items directly issued to end-users 

Particulars GL Balance 

Office Supplies Expense ₱675,854.05 
Medical, Dental and Laboratory Supplies Expense 806,821.98 

Semi-Expendable Machinery and Equipment Expenses 301,618.73 

Semi-Expendable Furniture, Fixtures and Books Expenses 129,360.00 

Other Supplies and Materials Expenses 1,019,402.76 

Total ₱2,933,057.52 
 

38.  The process in the receipt of delivery and immediate issuance to the end-
users resulted in the failure of the Property Office to maintain the SC for each item, 
while the SLC maintained by the Accounting Office through e-NGAS showed a zero 
balance. Management failed to maintain an Inventory Accounting System and to 
observe compliance with the perpetual inventory method for its regular purchases of 
supplies and materials as required by the aforementioned provisions. Hence, the 
movement of supplies and materials were not properly monitored and controlled as 
at year-end, thus, casting doubt on the fair presentation of the inventory accounts in 
the FS. 
 

b) No central stock/storage room for inventories 

 
39. The absence of a stockroom or storage in the agency led to the continuing 
practice of direct issuance of supplies to the respective offices upon the delivery 
thereof, leaving the users no choice but to receive the supplies in bulk. Consequently, 
the physical count/inventory required semi-annually as an indispensable procedure 
for checking the integrity of property custodianship was not conducted; thus, no 
corresponding Report on the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) was submitted to 
the Audit Team.  
 
40. Management explained that the non-provision of a stockroom is due to the 
lack of space and the cost of having additional manpower that would add up to the 
cost of the inventories. However, a stockroom will not need a huge space to be an 
issue and having a Stock Personnel who is vital to the operations of the agency does 
not mean hiring a new employee, but Management can utilize its present manpower 
in the Property Office for the task.  

 



55 
 

41.  To further the practice of Management’s non-adherence to the correct 
process of maintaining an Inventory Accounting System, may cost them not only the 
unmonitored inventories and materials/properties, but may also affect the validity and 
existence of the affected account balances which inevitably will affect the fair 
presentation of the FS at the end of the year.  
 

42. We recommended and Management agreed to: 

a. provide and maintain a stockroom for supplies and materials for 
inventory purposes; 

b. require the Property Officer to: 

i.   refrain from issuing procured items directly to end-users upon 

delivery thereof; 

 

ii.   maintain stock cards for each inventory and prepare monthly 

RSMI based on RIS; and  

 

iii. conduct physical inventory of supplies and materials semi-

annually and prepare the corresponding RPCI; 

 

c. require the Accountant to maintain SLC for each item; and  

d. require the Accounting and Property Sections to regularly conduct a 
reconciliation of their records and make the necessary adjustments 

as a result of the reconciliation. 

 

Unreconciled balance of PS-DBM - ₱2,070,691.94 

 
43. Non-regular reconciliation between the Procurement Service -
Department of Budget and Management (PS-DBM) and the agency’s accounting 

records of the account Due from NGAs resulted in a variance amounting to 
₱2,070,691.94; thus, the account balance as at year-end could not be ascertained. 

 
44. Comparison between the balance from PS-DBM records and accounting 
records as at October 31, 2020 revealed a difference of ₱2,070,691.94. The Due from 
NGAs-Procurement Service (PS-DBM) account has a balance of ₱2,258,615.30 as 
recorded in the books, while the balance as per confirmation from the PS-DBM was 
only ₱187,923.36. The discrepancy could be attributed to the failure of the 
representatives of the Accounting and Property Sections to regularly reconcile with 
the PS-DBM and the failure of the latter to deliver the supplies and materials ordered 
by the agency.  

 
45. Management commented that they were regularly reconciling with the PS-
DBM to monitor deliveries and to request refunds should there be any undelivered 
item as at year-end. Verification, however, disclosed that they have reconciled with 



56 
 

the PS-DBM through emails from March to April 2021 covering January 2012 to 
April 2021 balances, only after an Audit Observation Memorandum (AOM) was 
issued. 
 
46. We recommended and Management agreed to, henceforth, require the 
Property Section personnel to conduct regular reconciliation of their records 

with the PS-DBM and effect adjustments/corrections, as necessary. 

 

Unreconciled balance of PPE accounts - ₱232,206,877.37 

 

47. The accuracy and reliability of the PPE accounts balance of 
₱1,415,193,109.06 could not be ascertained due to: (a) discrepancies of 

₱232,206,877.37 between the GL balances and the Report on the Physical Count 

of PPE (RPCPPE); and (b) non-disposal of unserviceable PPEs amounting to 

₱26,666,518.18, all owing to lack of regular reconciliation between accounting 

and property records.   
 

48. IPSAS 17 prescribes the standards on the recognition, measurement, 
depreciation, impairment, derecognition and disclosure requirements dealing with 
transactions and events affecting property, plant and equipment of the Philippine 
public sector so that users of the financial statements can discern information about 
an entity’s investment in its PPE and the changes in such investment. 

49. As at December 31, 2020, the Agency’s PPE accounts amounted to 
₱1,415,193,109.06 with net book value of ₱773,431,184.89, as presented in Table 5.

50. Analysis of the PPE accounts revealed the following deficiencies/errors 
which affected the determination of accuracy and reliability of the reported balances: 

a) Discrepancy between accounting and property records – ₱232,206,877.37 
 
51. Section 38, Chapter 10 of the GAM, Volume I requires that: “The entity shall 
have a periodic physical count of PPE, shall be done annually and presented on the 

Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) 

(Appendix 73) as at December 31, of each year.  This shall be submitted to the Auditor 

concerned not later than January 31 of the following year. Equipment found at station 

and losses discovered during the physical count shall be reported to the Accounting 

Division/Unit for proper accounting/recording”. (emphasis ours) 

 

52. Moreover, Section 42 of the same Manual also states that the Chief 
Accountant shall maintain Property Plant and Equipment Ledger Card (PPELC) for 

each category of PPE. PPELC shall be kept to record promptly the acquisition, 
description, custody, estimated useful life, depreciation, impairment loss, disposal 

and other information about the asset. For check and balance, the Property and 

Supply Office/Unit shall likewise maintain Property Card (PC) for PPE in their 

custody to account for the receipt and disposition of the same. The balance per PC 

shall be reconciled with PPELC maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit. They 

shall also be reconciled with other property records like Property Acknowledgement 

Receipt (PAR). (emphasis ours) 

 
53. In the same Manual, Section 40(d) states that all unserviceable property shall 
be reported in the Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property 

(IIRUP) (Appendix 74).  PPE reported in the IIRUP shall be dropped from the books 

by debiting Impairment Loss-Property, Plant and Equipment (cost of the PPE less 

Accumulated Depreciation).  

 

54. Verification of Accounting and Property records as at December 31, 2020 
showed that the GL balances of various PPE accounts totaling ₱1,415,193,109.06 did 
not reconcile with the RPCPPE prepared by the Supply and Maintenance Section 
with only a balance of ₱1,182,986,231.69, thus, resulting in a substantial difference 
of ₱232,206,877.37, as shown in Table 6:

Total   ₱ 1,182,986,231.69    ₱1,415,193,109.06   ₱ 232,206,877.37 
 

55. The above discrepancy is mainly attributable to the lack of coordination in the 
reconciliation of the Accounting and Property Office records.  In CY 2018 alone, the 
noted discrepancies of ₱83,088,727.33 had increased by ₱149,118,150.04 or 179 
percent bringing the total discrepancy to ₱232,206,877.37 as at December 31, 2020. 
The increase was largely shared by the Technical and Scientific Equipment 
amounting to ₱129,381,888.88 which was said to have been purchased using the 
Trust Fund.   

56. Management informed us that a separate RPCPPE for Trust Fund was 
prepared and they committed to submit it immediately.  As of this report, however, 
none has been submitted.     

  
57. Moreover, we also noted that the Supply Office personnel prepared a separate 
RPCPPE for the Other Assets account which was found to be unserviceable instead 
of using the Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP), 
contrary to Section 40, Chapter 10 of the GAM, Volume I. 
 
58. The above deficiencies noted resulted in a total variance of ₱232,206,877.37; 
thus, casting doubt on the existence of PPE as well as the accuracy of the PPE account 
balances as at December 31, 2020. 
 

 



59 
 

59. We recommended and Management agreed to require:  

a. The Supply Officer to cause the submission of the RPCPPE covering 
the physical count conducted for items under Trust Fund, and to 

prepare the IIRUP for the unserviceable property found thereafter; 

and 

b. The Accountant and the Supply Officer to conduct regular 
reconciliation of the PPEs account reported in the RPCPPE with the 
GL balances, investigate the discrepancies noted, and make the 

corresponding adjustments.   

 

b)  Non-disposal of unserviceable PPEs - ₱26,666,518.18 

 

60. Section 79 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 provides that, “When the 
government property has become unserviceable for any cause, or is no longer 

needed, it shall, upon, application of the officer accountable therefore, be inspected 

by the head of the agency or his duly representative xxx and if found to be valueless 

or unsaleable, it may be destroyed. If found to be valuable, it may be sold at public 

auction to the highest bidder under the supervision of the proper committee an award 

or similar body xxx. In the event that public auction fails, the property may be sold 

at a private sale at such prices as may be fixed by the same committee or body 

concerned xxx.”  

61. Moreover, IPSAS 17 states that, “The carrying amount of an item of property, 
plant, and equipment shall be derecognized: (a) on disposal; or (b) when no future 

economic benefit or service potential is expected from its use or disposal.”  

62. As at December 31, 2020, the unserviceable properties which remained in the 
agency’s books of accounts amounted to ₱26,666,518.18 and were recorded in the 
books as Other Assets consisting of various defective and obsolete Office Equipment, 
Information and Technology Equipment, Communication Equipment, and Technical 
and Scientific Equipment.  We have observed that these unserviceable properties 
continue to gather dust and occupy space in the agency’s storage room which could 
have been used as additional office space.   

63. Further, due to non-disposal, the carrying amounts of these assets are 
continuously carried in the books of accounts and reported in the FS as assets, even 
when they are no longer in use or already without service potential, which could 
possibly mislead the users/readers of the FS.  Moreover, the deferment of the disposal 
of unserviceable properties resulted in their further deterioration and reduction of 
saleable value. 

64. Management commented that it is their intention to begin the disposal of 
unserviceable PPEs in CY 2020; however, this requires physical activities that are 
limited during this pandemic. In prior years, MIRDC had undergone a series of 



60 
 

retrofitting and refurbishing activities that the focus on disposal was set aside 
momentarily.  

 
65. We recommended and Management agreed to require: 

a. The Disposal Committee to appraise and dispose the unserviceable 
properties to avoid deterioration and accordingly, maximize the 

potential income that could be derived from their sale; and 

 

b. The Accountant to prepare, after the disposal, the necessary 
accounting entries to derecognize the said PPEs from the books of 

accounts. 
 
66. In summary, due to the significant impact on the financial statements of the 
total misstatements of ₱2,194,917.13 and ₱1,771,256.53 which represent 0.19 
percent and 0.27 percent of its total assets and equity, respectively, and with total 
deficiencies of ₱265,039,648.67 or 23.32 percent of its total assets, we rendered a 
Qualified Opinion on the financial statements of the MIRDC as at year-end. 
 
Compliance Audit  

  

Overpayment of Hazard Allowance - ₱2,590,803.61 

 

67. The computation of the Hazard Allowance (HA) paid to the MIRDC 
officers and employees for the period January to December 2020 was not in 

accordance with the provisions of DBM-DOST Joint Circular (JC) No. 01 s. 2013 

dated June 25, 2013, Malacañang Administrative Order (AO) No. 26 dated 

March 23, 2020, and DBM Budget Circular (BC) No. 2020-1 dated March 24, 

2020, thus, resulting in an overpayment of ₱2,441,446.13.  

 

68. Section 9.1 of DBM-DOST JC No. 1 s. 2013 dated June 25, 2013, provides:     

“9.1.1 High Risk to Hazards- S&T personnel that are high risk to 
hazards are those that have direct and unavoidable exposure to 
in following areas: 

 
9.1.1.1 Work areas including laboratories and workshops that 
pose risks or dangers to health and safety due to dangerous 
working conditions or environment elements such as; 
contaminants, ionizing radiation; electromagnetic radiation 
communicable and contagious diseases; combustible, 
explosive, reactive, corrosive and toxic chemicals and 
biological substances; absence of adequate supply of safe and 
potable water, and operation of hazardous equipment. 
 



61 
 

9.1.2 Low Risk Hazards- S&T personnel that are low risk to hazards 
are those exposed to less degree of occupational risks, perils to 
life, or physical hardships such as: in work areas in prison 
camps, drug rehabilitation centers and mental health 
institutions; or in frequent interaction with employees working 
in the laboratory or highly hazardous areas.” 

 
69. In line with identifying the levels of risk of the work areas, the Secretary of 
the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) issued an undated DOST 
Certificate No. Memorandum Circular (MC)-Hazard 2020-21, received by MIRDC 
Management on March 2, 2020, enumerating the levels of risk and percentage of 
hazards for the agency officers and employees for the period January to December 
2020 ranging from Low Risk to High Risk or from 15% to 30%, respectively, 
depending upon the exposure to hazards in their work areas. 

70. Further, Section 9.2 of DBM-DOST JC No. 1, s. 2013 provides the manner 
of computing the HA, that is, “the Hazard Allowance for the month shall be based on 
the degree of risk to hazards, presented in Table 7, as specified in sub-items 9.1.1 and 
9.1.2 and the number of actual exposure over number of workdays in a month, 
at rates not to exceed 30% of monthly basic salary x x x.” 

Table 7. Rates of HA per DBM-DOST JC No. 1,  
series of 2013 dated June 25, 2013 

Level of Risk 1 
Actual Exposure High Risk Low Risk 

15 or more days 30% of monthly basic salary 15% of monthly basic salary 

8 to 14 days 23% of monthly basic salary 12% of monthly basic salary 

Less than 8 days 15% of monthly basic salary 10% of monthly basic salary 

 
71. Furthermore, Section 1 of AO No. 26  dated March 23, 2020 on the “Grant of 
the Covid-19 Hazard Pay”, issued by the Office of the President during the COVID-
19 pandemic, states that: 

“National government agencies (NGAs), including state universities 

and colleges (SUCs) and government-owned or -controlled 

corporations (GOCCs), are authorized to grant COVID-19 Hazard Pay 

to personnel who physically report for work during the implementation 

of an Enhanced Community Quarantine in their respective work 

stations, in an amount not exceeding P500 per day per person, which 

shall be computed as follows: 

            COVID-19 Hazard Pay = P500 x number of days of physical reporting 

for work during the quarantine period 

 

Personnel who are already entitled to Hazard Pay, Hazardous Duty 

Pay, Hazard Allowance or other similar benefits under existing laws, 



62 
 

issuances, rules and regulations, such as public health workers, public 

social workers, science and technology, and military and uniformed 
personnel, shall continue to be entitled to such benefits of the COVID-
19 Hazard Pay, whichever is higher.” 

 

72. Likewise, DBM BC No. 2020-1 dated March 24, 2020, in its guidelines on 
the grant of the COVID-19 Hazard Pay, plainly provides that hazard pay applies only 
in areas under Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) and Modified ECQ.    

73. Corollary to this, the Commissioner of the Civil Service Commission (CSC), 
clarified that “The grant of hazard pay to government workers is not applicable in 
areas under the General Community Quarantine (GCQ). 

74. Post-audit of transactions revealed that the Personnel and Accounting 
Sections did not consider the Certification issued by the DOST Secretary at the 
beginning of the year, i.e., enumerating the levels of risk and the percentage of 
hazards for agency officers and employees, in the computation of the HA for CY 
2020. The agency’s HA Committee instead issued a Certificate of Actual Exposure 
to Hazard in which majority of its personnel, who were previously under Low Risk 
level, were classified as High Risk-30% during the implementation of the Enhanced 
Community Quarantine (ECQ) from March 17, 2020 to May 30, 2020, and for 
months onwards, they were all categorized as High Risk with a maximum 30% of 
risk from June to December 2020 and up to the present.  

75. To illustrate, Table 8 shows the computations made by Management, while 
Table 9 shows the correct computation, to wit: 

Table 8. Agency’s Computation of HA 

 

 

76. It can be gleaned from the above Table that the actual number of workdays 
that the official/employee was exposed to hazards during the month, as provided in 
Section 9.2 of DBM-DOST JC No. 1, s. 2013, was already considered.

Emp 4 31,405.00 2 20 Low Risk  10% 314.05 

 
77. Verification of the DVs showed that the agency paid the HA for CY 2020 to 
its officials and employees amounting to ₱10,465,666.91, out of which a 
corresponding overpayment had amounted to ₱2,441,446.13, exclusive of tax. A 
Notice of Disallowance was issued relative to the said amount in May 2021.  

78. The foregoing clearly illustrate the overpayment of HA to officials and 
employees in spite of the issuance by Malacañang of AO No. 26 clarifying that under 
ECQ, personnel such as science and technology, among others, who are already 
entitled to Hazard Allowance or other similar benefits under existing laws shall 

continue to be entitled to such benefits or the COVID-19 Hazard Pay, whichever is 
higher.  This means that those who are already receiving more than ₱500/day of 
HA should stick to the present rates prescribed under the DBM-DOST JC. 

79.  However, during GCQ, from June to December 2020 and up to the present, 
the entire MIRDC personnel were categorized as High Risk level with a uniform rate 
of 30% of HA; thus, further increasing their HA, despite the declaration by the DBM 
and the CSC that ‘hazard pay applies only in areas under Enhanced Community 
Quarantine (ECQ) and Modified ECQ and is no longer applicable in areas under 
GCQ.”  

80. Further examination of documents disclosed that on December 17, 2020, all 
of the MIRDC personnel categorized as Low Risk and High Risk of 23% claimed 
adjustment for the High Risk-30% category for the period January to March 15, 2020, 
thereby, causing a full blown category of High Risk-30% for all MIRDC personnel 
for CY 2020. 

81. It is worth noting that while the front liners, especially the health workers 
under Job Order (JO) status who are not covered by the Magna Carta Law, were no 
longer entitled to the ₱500/day Hazard Pay during GCQ as per above-mentioned 
issuances due to government budget constraints, the MIRDC personnel continue to 
receive more or even double than what the law allows, on the basis of the MIRDC’s 
approved Certificate of Actual Exposure to Hazard declared by each of the 
employees. 



64 
 

82. We recommended that Management require the Chief of Administrative 
and General Services Section (AGSS) and the Accountant to: 

a. strictly follow the guidelines of Section 9.2 DBM-DOST JC No.1, s. 
2013, dated June 25, 2013, Administrative Order No. 26 dated March 

23, 2020, and DBM Budget Circular (BC) No. 2020-1 dated March 

24, 2020 in the computation of hazard pay; and 

b. re-compute the hazard pay benefits paid to its officers and 
employees, and require them to refund the overpayment of hazard 

pay for CY 2020 to avoid disallowance in audit. 

 

83. Management commented that it was through the DOST Secretary’s issuance 
of Certificate No. MC-Hazard 2020-21 which certified that the work areas of 
employees were evaluated by the DOST Hazard Committee and found to be 
hazardous.   

84. Although the said certification states the level of risk and percent of hazard 
allowance of listed MIRDC employees, it also provides that “HA shall be computed 
based on the level of risk and number of days exposed to and shall be in accordance 
with DBM-DOST JC No. 1 dated 25 June 2013, and shall be subject to the restriction 
under Sec. 2, 3, 4, 5 of the amended IRR for RA 8439. Further, exposure to hazard 
may change or vary per individual on certain periods within the year which may 
warrant change of HA entitlement but subject to submission of appropriate 
documents.” (underscoring supplied) 

85. In addition, the change of employee’s level of hazard from low risk to high 
risk or vice versa is in accordance with the DMB-DOST JC given the nature of 
business of the MIRDC as a research and development institute, employees work in 
a hazardous environment. As such, they are unavoidably exposed to different 
workplace hazards such as, but not limited, to chemical hazards (e.g., liquid, vapor, 
gas, fume, mist) and physical (e.g., liquid, vapor, gas, fume, mist) and physical 
hazards (e.g., noise, vibration, heat, cold, electricity, radiation, pressure).  These 
hazards pose danger to the health and safety of employees, and are categorized as 
HIGH RISK in item 9.1.1 of the said DBM-DOST JC. 

86. Corollary to employees’ risk to hazard in the year 2020 is the hazard brought 
about by the COVID-19 virus.  Records may show the increasing number of positive 
cases in MIRDC.  This situation is categorized as HIGH RISK as provided in said 
9.1.1.4 DBM-DOST JC 2013, which states “that work areas, under state of calamity 
or emergency where there are: earthquake, tsunami, volcanic, and pyroclastic flow, 
floods, landslides, and other natural hazards.” 

87. As a rejoinder, we maintain our stand that the HA computation of the MIRDC 
officers and employees is not in accordance with the provisions of the DBM-DOST 



65 
 

JC No. 1, s.2013 and item 2.3.4.5 of the amended IRR for RA 8439 which states that: 
the declaration of the hazardous work areas shall be duly certified by the Secretary 

of the Department upon recommendation of the agency head.  The Secretary may 

refer to the appropriate authorized agency for the necessary certification.  This ruling 
is clear, the necessary certification on hazardous work areas may be coming from the 
appropriate authorized agency with the agency head as the recommendatory for 
Department Secretary’s approval; hence, the declaration of the hazardous work areas 
is not without the approval of the Department Secretary. 

88. The agency’s understanding of the above ruling caused them to issue the          
Certificate of Actual Exposure as supporting document to the claim, which is self-
serving and without legal basis. These documents were individually certified by and 
prepared by the claimant-personnel duly approved only by the Agency’s Hazard 
Allowance Committee sans recommendatory documents by the Head of the Agency 
to and certification by the Department Secretary. 

89. The same goes with the level of hazard from low risk to high risk or vice versa 
which are essentially the contents of the declaration by the Department Secretary, 
hence, should be with the approval of the Department Secretary upon the 
recommendation of the head of the agency.  

90. While on the hazard brought about by Covid-19, this is covered by 
Administrative Order No. 26, dated March 23, 2020, issued by the President on 
“Authorizing the Grant of Hazard Pay to Government Personnel who Physically 
Report for Work During the Period of Implementation of an Enhanced Community 
Quarantine Relative to the Covid-19 Outbreak” which provides that, those personnel 
who are already entitled to Hazard Allowance or other similar benefits under existing 

laws, such as science and technology, among others, shall continue to be entitled to 
such benefits or the COVID-19 Hazard Pay, whichever is higher.  Clearly, those who 
are already receiving more than P500/day of HA should stick to the present rates 
prescribed under DBM-DOST JC. 

 

Other Compliance Issues 
     

Gender and Development (GAD) 

 

91. The Agency spent a total amount of ₱14,875,832.76 for the 
implementation of GAD activities which is 5.91 percent of their total 

appropriations for Fiscal Year (FY) 2020; however, the GAD Plan and Budget 

(GPB) was neither submitted to nor reviewed by the Philippine Commission for 

Women (PCW); thus, it could not be ascertained whether the reported 

accomplishments were indeed responsive to the gender issues and concerns 

relative thereto. 



66 
 

92. Section 31 of the FY 2020 General Appropriations Act (GAA) directs all 
government agencies to formulate a GAD Plan designed to address gender issues and 
implement applicable provisions under R.A. No. 9710 or the Magna Carta of Women, 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of discrimination Against Women, 
Beijing Platform for Action, Philippine Plan for Gender-Responsive Development 
(1995-2025) and the Philippine Development Plan. 

93. The GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of the agencies, 
which shall be at least five percent (5%) of their total appropriations.  For this 
purpose, activities currently being undertaken by agencies which relate to GAD or 
those that contribute to poverty alleviation, economic empowerment especially of 
marginalized women, protection, promotion and fulfilment of women’s human 
rights, and practice of gender-responsive governance are considered sufficient 
compliance with said requirement.  Utilization of the GAD budget shall be evaluated 
based on the GAD performance indicators identified by said agencies. The 
preparation and submission of the annual GAD plan and the annual GAD 
Accomplishment Report shall be subject to the guidelines issued by the agencies 
concerned.

97. The submitted GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) for CY 2020 to the Audit Team 
is unsigned, with reference no. Endorsed GPB #2019-008353 dated October 14, 
2019.   Hence, there is no indication that said GPB was submitted to the PCW in CYs 
2020 or 2021, contrary to the GAD personnel’s claim of its online submission to the 
PCW on March 10, 2021.  On the other hand, assuming that submission was 
undertaken, the agency has yet to wait for the result of the review and evaluation from 
the PCW, whether the information reflected in the GPB are in line with the purpose 
of the GAD and address the gender issues and concerns related thereto. 
 
98. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Focal Person 
for GAD to, henceforth: 

 

a. submit, monitor and follow up the status of review by the PCW on 
the submitted GAD Accomplishment Report for CY 2020; 

 

b. continue the conduct of more programs, activities and projects that 
are gender responsive and approved by the PCW; 

 

c. continue to comply and attribute the allocation of at least five percent 
(5%) of the agency’s appropriation for the implementation of more 

GAD-related gender-responsive programs and activities; and 

 

d. comply with the pertinent PCW Memorandum Circular on the 
preparation and online submission of GPB and GAD 

Accomplishment Reports. 

 

Senior Citizens, Differently-Abled Persons and Youth 

 

99. Management failed to submit plans, projects and activities for CY 2020, 
together with the accomplishments to address the concerns of senior citizens and 

differently-abled persons, insofar as it relates to their mandated functions, 

pursuant to Section 32 of the General Provisions of Republic Act (RA) No. 

11465, otherwise known as the General Appropriations Act (GAA) for FY 2020. 

 

100. Section 32 of RA 11465 provides that: 

 
 “All agencies of the government shall formulate plans, programs and 

projects intended to address the concerns of senior citizens and persons 

with disability, in so far as it relates to their mandated functions, and 

integrate the same in their regular activities.  Moreover, all government 

infrastructure and facilities shall provide architectural or structural 

features, designs or facilities that will reasonably enhance the mobility, 



69 
 

safety and welfare of persons with disability pursuant to Batas 

Pambansa Blg. 344 and R.A. No. 7277, as amended.” 
 

101. Despite follow-ups with Management, the agency failed to submit plans, 
projects and activities, together with their accomplishments to address the concerns 
of Senior Citizens and Differently-Abled Persons for CY 2020. 

 
102. We recommended and Management agreed to, henceforth, formulate 
and implement plans, programs and projects intended to address the concerns 

of senior citizens and differently-abled persons, and submit the accomplishment 

reports to COA for validation and reporting purposes, in compliance with 

existing laws, rules and regulations.

103. Management failed to submit accomplishment report on 
programs/projects/activities intended for youth development pursuant to 

Section 33 of the General Provisions of RA 11465 or the 2020 GAA. 

 

104. Section 33 of RA 11465 provides that all government agencies shall provide 
allocations for youth development projects and activities within the framework of the 
Philippine Youth Development Plan (2017-2022). 

 
105. For CY 2020, the agency failed to submit accomplishments on 
programs/projects/activities for youth development despite consistent follow-ups, 
thus, compliance of the agency to the aforementioned provision cannot be 
ascertained.  

 
106. We recommended Management to henceforth submit related 
accomplishment report of programs/projects/activities intended for youth 

development to the Audit Team for compliance validation and reporting 

purposes. 

 
 Hiring of Job-Orders/Contractuals
