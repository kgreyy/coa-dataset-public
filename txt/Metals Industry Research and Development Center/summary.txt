C. Scope of Audit 
 

The audit covered the accounts and operations of MIRDC for the year ended 

December 31, 2020. The audit was conducted to a) verify the level of assurance that 

may be placed on management’s assertions on the financial statements; b) 

recommend agency’s improvement opportunities; and c) determine the extent of 

implementation of prior year’s audit recommendations. 

 
D. Opinion of the Auditor on the fairness of presentation of the Financial 

Statements 
 

A qualified opinion was rendered on the financial statements as at December 31, 

2020 due to the significant impact on the financial statements of the total 

misstatements of ₱2,194,917.13 and ₱1,771,256.53 which represent 0.19 percent 

and 0.27 percent of its total assets and equity, respectively, and with total 

deficiencies of ₱265,039,648.67 or 23.32 percent of its total assets. 

 

E. Summary of Other Significant Observations and Recommendations 
 

The following were other significant audit observations to be addressed, details 

of which are further discussed in the Part II of the report.  

 

1. The Cash in Bank - LCCA account with SL balance of ₱1,162,503.66 was not 
remitted to the BTr, contrary to Section 2 of Executive Order No. 338 and 

Section 4 of the General Provisions of the FY 2020 General Appropriations Act 

(GAA), thus, depriving the national government of the proper disposition of 

these funds. 

 

 We recommended and Management agreed to: 

a. cause the immediate transfer of all trust receipts to the BTr, including 

excess funds from the BAC honoraria, pursuant to the above provisions 

of laws, rules and regulations; and 



iii 

 

b. henceforth, remit all collections to the BTr regardless of income source, 

in compliance with the issued rules and regulations affecting the said 

accounts. 

2. Management failed to maintain Inventory Accounting System for its supplies 
and materials for inventory purposes, mainly due to: (a) direct issuances to end-

users right after delivery; and (b) non-provision of central stock/storage rooms. 

As such, the validity, accuracy and existence of the balances of the affected 

accounts could not be ascertained; thus, transactions presented in the FS are 

deemed doubtful. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 

a. provide and maintain a stockroom for supplies and materials for 

inventory purposes; 

b. require the Property Officer to: 

i.   refrain from issuing procured items directly to end-users upon 

delivery thereof; 

 

ii.   maintain stock cards for each inventory and prepare monthly RSMI 

based on RIS; and  

 

iii. conduct physical inventory of supplies and materials semi-annually 

and prepare the corresponding RPCI; 

 

c. require the Accountant to maintain SLC for each item; and  

d. require the Accounting and Property Sections to regularly conduct a 

reconciliation of their records and make the necessary adjustments as a 

result of the reconciliation. 

3. Non-regular reconciliation between the Procurement Service -Department of 
Budget and Management (PS-DBM) and the agency’s accounting records of the 

account Due from NGAs resulted in a variance amounting to ₱2,070,691.94; 

thus, the account balance as at year-end could not be ascertained. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to, henceforth, require the 

Property Section personnel to conduct regular reconciliation of their 

records with the PS-DBM and effect adjustments/corrections, as necessary. 

 

4. The accuracy and reliability of the PPE accounts balance of ₱1,415,193,109.06 
could not be ascertained due to: (a) discrepancies of ₱232,206,877.37 between 

the GL balances and the Report on the Physical Count of PPE (RPCPPE); and 

(b) non-disposal of unserviceable PPEs amounting to ₱26,666,518.18, all owing 

to lack of regular reconciliation between accounting and property records.  

 



iv 

 

 

 

 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require:  

a. The Supply Officer to cause the submission of the RPCPPE covering the 

physical count conducted for items under Trust Fund, and to prepare 

the IIRUP for the unserviceable property found thereafter; 

b. The Accountant and the Supply Officer to conduct regular 

reconciliation of the PPEs account reported in the RPCPPE with the GL 

balances, investigate the discrepancies noted, and make the 

corresponding adjustments; 

c. The Disposal Committee to appraise and dispose the unserviceable 

properties to avoid deterioration and accordingly, maximize the 

potential income that could be derived from their sale; and 

d. The Accountant to prepare, after the disposal, the necessary accounting 

entries to derecognize the said PPEs from the books of accounts. 

5. The computation of the Hazard Allowance (HA) paid to the MIRDC officers and 
employees for the period January to December 2020 was not in accordance with 

the provisions of DBM-DOST Joint Circular (JC) No. 01 s. 2013 dated June 25, 

2013, Malacañang Administrative Order (AO) No. 26 dated March 23, 2020, 

and DBM Budget Circular (BC) No. 2020-1 dated March 24, 2020, thus, 

resulting in an overpayment of ₱2,441,446.13. 

 

We recommended that Management require the Chief of Administrative 

and General Services Section (AGSS) and the Accountant to: 

a. strictly follow the guidelines of Section 9.2 DBM-DOST JC No.1, s. 

2013, dated June 25, 2013, Administrative Order No. 26 dated March 

23, 2020, and DBM Budget Circular (BC) No. 2020-1 dated March 24, 

2020 in the computation of hazard pay; and 

b. re-compute the hazard pay benefits paid to its officers and employees, 

and require them to refund the overpayment of hazard pay for CY 

2020 to avoid disallowance in audit.
