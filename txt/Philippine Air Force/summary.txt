C)	SCOPE OF AUDIT



The audit covered the operations and financial transactions of PAF Headquarters and its bases for calendar year 2020. 



D)	INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT



		The Auditor rendered an unmodified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the FS of PAF as at December 31, 2020. The Matrix of Analysis on the Effects of Misstatements on the FS is shown in Annex 2.



E)	SUMMARY OF AUDIT OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



1)	The accuracy and reliability of the Cash in Bank – Local Currency Current Account balance of ₱1.631 billion as of December 31, 2020 cannot be ascertained due to: a) unrecorded book reconciling items amounting to ₱238.089 million; and b) long outstanding bank reconciling items amounting to ₱12.544 million; thus, affecting the fair presentation of the accounts in the financial statements contrary to the pertinent provisions of Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume I. (Observation No. 1)



We recommended that Management: a) require the AFFC to immediately submit supporting documents related to various unrecorded reconciling items to AFAC as basis in recording and to coordinate with depository banks regarding bank error on long outstanding Debit Advices/Letter of Transfers for immediate deposit to proper personnel/creditors; b) instruct the AFAC to prepare necessary Journal Entry Vouchers (JEVs) to correct and adjust the affected accounts upon submission of documents by AFFC; and c) investigate the validity of claims pertaining to long outstanding Debit Advices/Letters of Transfers and revert back to the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) the excess cash balance, if necessary.



2)	Dormant Cash – Treasury/Agency Deposit, Trust Account of BAB amounting to ₱3.820 million has been retained due to lack of supporting documents to close the account contrary to COA Circular No. 97-001 dated February 5, 1997. (Observation No. 2)



We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Head of the 2nd FAU to: a) exert effort to further validate and locate supporting documents for the closure of dormant Cash – Treasury/Agency Deposit, Trust account and coordinate in writing with the AFAC and the BTr to appropriately document the extent of validation made on the account; and b) request for write off and/or adjustment of dormant balance from the COA in accordance with COA Circular 1997-001.



3)	Management leniency in the imposition of sanctions to delinquent tenants/ concessionaires such as disconnection of meters, cancellation of contract/permit and eviction of delinquent occupants of housing facilities pursuant to Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) issued by the PAF resulted in the accumulation of receivables under Trust Account totaling P27.612 million at year-end. Moreover, concessionaires’ deposits were recognized as deduction to Other Receivables account instead of recognizing the same as unearned revenue which resulted in negative balances totalling ₱.95 million in various Subsidiary Ledger (SL) accounts, contrary to the accrual basis of accounting and Section 30, Chapter 5 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I.  (Observation No. 3)

	

We recommended that Management: a) strictly implement the SOP and provisions in the revocable permit/contract of lease in the settlement of accounts, collection of advance rentals and deposit and enforcement of collection of all current accounts to prevent from becoming past due; b) submit to Audit Team copy of demand letters issued to delinquent concessionaires/occupants and actions undertaken to collect the long outstanding balances; and c) prepare adjusting journal entries pertaining to advance receipt of revenues in accordance with accrual basis and Section 53(b), Chapter 19 of GAM.



4)	The balance of Due from National Government Agencies account of P20.39 million as of December 31, 2020 is unreliable due to discrepancy of P1.41 million between the balance of Headquarters, Philippine Air Force (HPAF) records of fund transfers and that of the Procurement Service - Department of Budget and Management (PS-DBM) caused by unrecorded deliveries and payments. Moreover, despite unserved Agency Procurement Requests (APRs) of P3.26 million, a total of P2.34 million was transferred during the year which resulted in the accumulation of funds lodged at the PS-DBM. (Observation No. 4)



We recommended that management: a) direct the AFAC to coordinate with PS-DBM and investigate/identify reconciling items between the PAF and PS-DBM records, particularly the January 2019 balances and if necessary, draw appropriate JEVs to take up adjustment;  b) direct the AFAC to call the attention of officers who received the items and require immediate submission of Delivery Receipts and other pertinent documents for proper accounting; and c) require the PS-DBM to immediately served the undelivered items, otherwise,  request the refund of unutilized fund transfers or apply fund balances for current procurement requests. 



5)	The reliability and accuracy of the Due from Government Owned and/or Controlled Corporations account balance of ₱471.62 million as of December 31, 2020 cannot be ascertained due net difference of ₱386.44 million between the PAF and the Philippine International Trading Corporation (PITC) records of fund transfers. Moreover, residuals/fund balances from completed projects totaling ₱1.5 million were not returned by the latter (PITC) to the former (PAF) for subsequent remittance to the BTr. (Observation No. 5)



We recommended that Management: a) direct the AFAC to reconcile unliquidated balance of the fund transfers with the PITC records; b) request the PITC to submit all documents relative to reconciling items in coordination with Office of the Assistant of Air Staff for Logistics (OA-4) and Philippine Air Force Procurement Center (PAFPC) and make necessary adjustments in the books of accounts; and c) determine the updated balance of residuals from completed projects and demand from PITC its refund for subsequent reversion to the BTr.



6)	The balance of Inventory Held for Consumption accounts totaling ₱2.868 billion as of December 31, 2020 was unreliable due to unreconciled discrepancy between accounting and property records amounting to ₱19.138 million which is attributable to: a) unrecorded issuances of inventories; b) unrecorded deliveries; and c) non-maintenance of Supplies Ledger Card (SLC) by the Accounting Division/Unit.  In addition, 410th MW failed to conduct physical count of inventory while five PAF units failed to submit the Report of Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) contrary to pertinent provisions of GAM, Volume I.  (Observation No. 6)



We recommended that Management: a) direct the AFAC to draw JEV/s to reflect the correct balance of affected accounts in the financial statements and exercise caution in recording transactions to ensure that the financial statements are fairly presented, reconcile records with 420thSW to determine additional errors and deficiencies not identified during the audit; and prepare SLC  on a per-item basis as required in the GAM; b) instruct the concerned Unit Supply Accountable Officers (SAOs) to regularly monitor the receipt and issuances of inventories under custody and submit the corresponding reports on time; and c) require the Unit SAOs and AFAC to conduct periodic reconciliation of balances per books and per property records and take necessary actions on noted discrepancies and henceforth coordinate with Unit SAOs from time to time to identify if there are items delivered/issued not recorded in accounting/property records.



7)	Buildings and Other Structures totaling ₱101.300 million located at PAF BAB were not recorded in the books of accounts due to lack of documentation as basis for recording contrary to Section 63 of PD 1445 and Section 3, Chapter 10 of the GAM, Volume I for NGAs; thus, understating the PPE and the related Accumulated Depreciation.  (Observation No. 7)



We recommended and Management agreed to: a) coordinate with AFAC to clarify the appropriate accounting treatment of subject buildings and structures and for the issuance of specific guidelines and directives on the matter; b) direct the Head of the Civil Engineer Staff Office, together with the respective SAOs of PAF Basa units to coordinate with the proponents or implementing units of the projects to secure pertinent documentation and submit the same to the Head of 2nd Field Accounting Unit for proper accounting and recording. Otherwise, seek the assistance of the Appraisal Unit of PAF for the immediate assessment as basis in recording the costs of buildings and other structures; and c) henceforth, ensure that complete documents are obtained from implementing units prior to completion of projects to facilitate accounting and recognition of projects completed.



8)	Rebates earned from Petron Corporation and its utilization amounting to P442.938 million and P67.620 million, respectively, were not recorded in the books of the Agency contrary to Section 31, Chapter 2 of GAM, Volume 1; thus, affecting the fair presentation of the accounts in the financial statements. Furthermore, only 17 projects amounting to P67.620 million or equivalent to 17.33 percent of the rebates earmarked for construction and repair of Petroleum, Oil Lubricant (POL) facilities were completed as of December 31, 2020 due to lack of specific timelines of project implementation in the Contract of Agreement between the Department of National Defense and Petron Corporation.  (Observation No. 8)



We recommended that Management direct the: a) AFAC to record the Repairs, Maintenance and Construction fund balance including the equipment delivered/works completed as utilization of fund balance in accordance to the provisions of GAM; and b) Office of the Assistant Chief of Air Staff for Logistics (OA-4) to coordinate with Petron Corporation for the immediate delivery of all undelivered equipment and/or completion of projects funded out of RMC Funds. Moreover, issue a supplemental Program of Expenditures indicating the specific and reasonable timelines for each project and furnish a copy to Petron Corporation for their compliance.



9)	The balance of Advances to Contractors account amounting to ₱378.236 million as of December 31, 2020 includes dormant balances totaling ₱0.991 million without supporting documents thereby casting doubt on the validity of the account balance. (Observation No. 9)



We recommended that Management instruct the Chief Accountant to reconcile SL records and exert efforts to secure additional information and documents on dormant balances.



10)	The balance of Due to NGAs account of ₱1.119 billion as of December 31, 2020 is overstated by a net amount of ₱4.340 million due to unremitted income to the BTr arising from use of aircrafts for cloud seeding operations; thus affecting the fair presentation of the financial statements. (Observation No. 10)



We recommended that Management direct the: a) Air Force Finance Center  and AFAC to process the remittance of all earned income to the BTr; and b) AFAC to draw necessary adjusting journal entries to record immediately all accrued income arising from the use of aircrafts for cloud seeding operations and the subsequent remittance of earned income to the BTr.



11)	The reliability and accuracy of Other Payables account balance of ₱29.796 million as of December 31, 2020 is doubtful due to existence of SLs with negative balances totaling ₱9.265 million contrary to Section 15, Chapter 2 of the GAM for NGAs Volume I. Moreover, long outstanding balance of payables for more than two years amounting to P2.775 million remained unsettled contrary to Section 17, Chapter 7 of the GAM for NGAs Volume I. (Observation No. 11)



We recommended that Management direct the: a) Air Force Finance Center  and AFAC to coordinate with financial institutions in determining the correct balance of affected SL accounts and conduct an in-depth reconciliation on non-moving unreconciled negative balances and determine if there are still valid claims for payables which are outstanding for more than two years, otherwise, revert the same to the accumulated surplus/deficit account; and b) AFAC to draw a JEV taking up the items for adjustment as a result of reconciliation made to reflect the correct balance of Other Payables account.



12)	Special fund totalling ₱30.020 million has been retained since CY 2017 and was not reverted to the Bureau of the Treasury contrary to EO No. 431 (2005) dated May 30, 2005, Permanent Committee JC No. 4-20-2012 and Section 6 of the General Provisions of the GAA, CY 2020. (Observation No. 12)



We recommended that Management remit the fund balance of 72-100 Reimbursable Fund to the National Treasury pursuant to EO No. 431 (2005) dated May 30, 2005 and Permanent Committee Joint Circular No. 4-20-2012. 



13)	Funds transferred from CYs 2018-2019 to Philippine International Trading Corp. (PITC) amounting to ₱736.14 million for the procurement of supplies and equipment posted low delivery rate of 35.93 percent during the year; thus, depriving the Command of the immediate use of the items requisitioned. (Observation No. 13)



We recommended that Management direct the Office of the Assistant Chief of Air Staff for Logistics (OA-4) and PAFPC to coordinate with PITC and demand the expedite immediate delivery of procured items covered in Agency Outsourcing Requests to enable the end-users to utilize the much-needed supplies and equipment, otherwise, request the refund of unspent advances and remit the same to the BTr.



14)	Inter-Agency Transferred Funds received from CYs 2014 to 2020 for the implementation of various projects totaling ₱1.248 billion posted low fund utilization rate of 10.16 percent due to: a) slow procurement process; and b) non-charging to the fund of operational cost incurred; thus depriving the intended end-users/beneficiaries of the economic benefits that may be derived from these projects. Moreover, the timeliness of project implementation cannot be determined due to non-submission of pertinent documents as required in COA Circular 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012. (Observation No. 14)



We recommended that Management direct the: a) PAF Bid and Award Committee to explain the reason for the prolonged procurement process in  the implementation of PAF Replication Project at Lumbia Airport, Cagayan de Oro City and submit a copy of a resolution justifying and recommending the change of mode of construction/procurement for the extension of runway of the Vigan International Airport in Vigan City or any similar document from competent authority; b) Office of the Assistant Chief of Air Staff for Logistics (OA-4) and Operations (OA-3), Philippine Air Force Procurement Center and all other concerned offices to submit deficient documents and updated status report of all outstanding inter-agency transferred funds; and c) Air Force Accounting Center to submit, in coordination with other concerned offices, copy of MOA, official receipt issued by the Source Agency to support refund of unexpended/unutilized balance of fund transfer and acceptance documents such as Technical, Inspection and Acceptance Report, sales invoice and other allied documents for completed projects and prepare Report of Disbursements to be submitted to Source Agencies.



15)	Advance payments to various contractors totaling ₱9.023 million were not recouped/recovered despite the termination of their respective contract contrary to Section 4, Annex E, of the Revised IRR of R.A 9184. Moreover, the validity of surety bonds pertaining to five contracts did not comply with the provisions of Insurance Commission Circular Letter No. 2018-47 dated September 13, 2018. (Observation No. 15)



We recommended that Management instruct the PAF Procurement Center to: a) send demand letters to surety companies and erring contractors to recover unrecouped advance payments, otherwise, pursue legal actions against them to recover not only the unrecouped balance, but also, the legal interests that may accrue in favor of the Command due to the delay in recovery; and b) ensure that the contractors posted surety bond in accordance with the existing regulations to protect the interest of the government.



16)	Retention money totaling ₱70.488 million was not refunded to suppliers/contractors even after the lapse of the warranty period or the issuance of Certificate of Acceptance contrary to Section 62, and 6.1, Annex E, of the Revised IRR of R.A 9184. Moreover, existence of dormant/unreconciled prior years’ security deposits amounting to ₱9.979 million casted doubt on the reliability and accuracy of the Guaranty/Security Deposits Payable account balance as of December 31, 2020. (Observation No. 16)



We recommended that Management: a) require the Philippine Air Force Procurement Center to initiate the release of the retention money to the respective suppliers and ensure that retention money is promptly returned to the supplier upon lapse of the retention period, provided that the delivered goods are free from patent and latent defects; and b) direct the Air Force Accounting Center to conduct an extensive and thorough reconciliation and validation of security deposits. Make necessary adjustments to reflect the correct balance of the affected accounts in the financial statements.



The foregoing observations and recommendations embodied in the report were brought to the attention of the concerned officials of the agency in our letter dated April 12, 2021 for further comment. Management’s views and reactions were considered in the report, where appropriate.



F)		STATUS OF IMPLEMENTATION OF PRIOR YEARS’ AUDIT RECOMMENDATIONS
