PART II – AUDIT OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS





The audit of financial transactions and operations of the Academy for calendar year 2020 disclosed some observations that needed improvements and/or corrections.  Our observations with the corresponding recommendations are discussed in detail in the succeeding paragraphs.

		

Financial and Compliance Audit

		

Unreliable Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) balances - ₱832.15 million



1)	The year-end balances of the Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) accounts amounting to ₱832,149,880.29 as at December 31, 2020 remained unreliable because of various lapses committed by management such as (a) incomplete conduct of physical count for all PPE accounts and unreconciled variance of ₱20,660,470.78 between the PPE book balances and the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE); (b) inaccurate provision of depreciation for 617 PPE items with net book value of ₱363,315,457.82 or 43.66% of the total PPE; (c) unrecognized land and donated property items due to absence of cost; (d) failure to de-recognize sold/donated motor vehicles amounting to  ₱891,369.09; and (e) non-reclassification of various assets lumped under Other PPE to the appropriate PPE categories in the amount of ₱241,965,986.15, resulting to the non-provision of depreciation thereon, contrary to the pertinent provisions of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I.



	1)	The audit of the Property Plant and Equipment (PPE) accounts disclosed that Management still failed to fully address the following deficiencies which were already raised in the previous years’ Annual Audit Reports (AARs); to wit:



a)	Failure to complete the physical count and non-reconciliation of Accounting and Property records



	2)	As of December 31, 2020, the Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) accounts of the Academy had a net carrying value of ₱832,149,880.29. The submitted Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) for the year was updated but no actual physical count was undertaken.  Per inquiry, the Inventory Committee has yet to finish the inventory-taking.



	3)	Comparison of the recorded PPEs per books and the RPCPPE showed balances of ₱1,714,361,274.62 and ₱1,693,700,803.84, respectively, or a material variance of ₱20,660,470.78.



	4)	The reconciliation of the records of the Accounting and the Property Offices is required under Section 42, Chapter 10 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I which states that the Chief Accountant shall maintain the Property, Plant and Equipment Ledger Card (PPELC) for each category of PPE including work and other animals, livestock etc. The PPELC shall be kept to record promptly the acquisition, description, custody, estimated useful life, depreciation, impairment loss, disposal and other information about the asset. For check and balance, the Property and Supply Office/Unit shall likewise maintain PC for PPE in their custody to account for the receipt and disposition of the same. The balance per PC shall be reconciled with PPELC maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit. They shall also be reconciled with other property records like Property Acknowledgment Receipts (PAR).



	5)	The absence of a complete inventory report and the non-reconciliation of the noted discrepancy between the Accounting and Property records cast doubts on the accuracy of the recorded PPE balances as of year-end.



b)	Unrecorded land and donated property items with unknown valuation



	6)	We noted that the value of a parcel of land with an area of 60.23 hectares, where the Academy is located, was not yet recognized in the books of accounts. The Accountant explained that they have not received any updates from the Provincial Environment and Natural Resources Office (PENRO) on the titling of the land and the assessed value assigned to the subject property.



	7)	Likewise, three Motor Vehicles donated to the Academy, as enumerated below, have remained unrecorded as of the close of CY 2020.

	8)	The above practice is inconsistent with Section 11, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, which provides that PPE acquired through a non-exchange transaction, such as donation, presidential proclamation, taxes, transfers and grants, its cost shall be measured at its fair value as at the date of acquisition. If the fair value cannot be determined, the asset shall be recorded at a nominal value (the value that is stated on currency or face value).



	9)	The concerned Accounting personnel justified that the deeds of donation, which serve as the basis for recording, are not in their possession. Relatedly, the Transportation Head assailed that their Office tried to communicate with the donors to obtain copies of the deeds of donation and information on the value of the donated vehicles but they learned that the same are no longer in the country. 



c)	PPEs not properly classified - ₱241,965,986.15



	10)	As reported in the prior years’ AARs, PPEs amounting to ₱241,965,986.15 were lumped in the Other PPE accounts way back in CY 2017.  The set of property was received by the Academy representing part of the proceeds from the loan agreement between the Department of Finance (DoF) and KfW, Germany in CY 2002 under the “Upgrading of the PMMA” Project. Initially, the property items were lodged under the Advances to Contractors account for lack of documentary basis that would allow proper identification and classification of these assets. Later, reclassification was made to the Other PPE accounts. As of December 31, 2020, the Accounting Office failed anew to determine the composition of the account for proper reclassification to the appropriate PPE category.



	11)	As a result, there was also no provision for the depreciation of the assets from the date of receipt which is a deviation from Section 27 (c) of Chapter 10 of the same Manual, which states that depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use such as when it is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.



d)	Non-derecognition of sold and donated Motor Vehicles- ₱891,369.09 (net)



	12)	Records showed that two units of motor vehicles were already sold/disposed by the Academy, yet still recorded in the books, as detailed below:

TOTAL

₱2,085,596.88

₱1,194,227.79

₱891,369.09



	13)	Relatedly, Section 39, supra, states that the cost of the PPE together with the related accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss shall be removed from the accounts. The carrying amount of an item of PPE shall be derecognized on disposal or when no future economic benefits or service potential is expected from its use or disposal.



	14)	The failure of the Accounting Office to derecognize the above property resulted to the overstatement of the PPE and Accumulated Depreciation accounts by ₱2,085,596.88 and ₱1,194,227.79, respectively.  Inversely, Equity was understated by ₱891,369.09.



e)	Inaccurate provision of depreciation for 617 PPE items with net book value of  ₱363,315,457.82



	15)	Section 27, supra, states that PPE gradually loses its ability to provide service over the course of time. Because of this, its cost needs to be distributed on a systematic basis over its useful life. The allocated cost is referred to as depreciation. The depreciation charge for each period shall be recognized as expense unless it is included in the carrying amount of another asset. xxx



	16)	There are three factors an entity must consider in determining depreciation: initial cost, useful life, and expected residual value at the end of its useful life.



	17)	Our review of the PPE Schedule as of December 31, 2020 disclosed various errors/deficiencies/inconsistencies in the provision of depreciation expense thru the e-NGAS, as follows:



a)	PPE accounts with no useful lives but with recorded depreciation expense.



Verification showed a total of 530 PPE items amounting to ₱766,518,720.29 which have zero useful lives. In addition, the PPE schedule reflected the corresponding accumulated depreciation and net book value at ₱400,664,595.49 and ₱365,854,124.80, respectively. We also noted that the acquisition dates indicated in the schedule were unusual such as January 0, 1, 5, 10, 1900, October 29, 1998 and October 27, 2005. 



i)	PPE accounts with no acquisition costs but with recorded depreciation expense. 



Further review revealed 49 items of PPE accounts with different acquisition dates and zero acquisition costs but have accumulated depreciation amounting to ₱2,510,960.20 and negative net book value of ₱2,510,960.20, thereby reducing the balance of the PPE account by the same amount.



ii)	PPE accounts with negative figures for acquisition costs, accumulated depreciation and net book value.



A total of 38 items of PPE accounts had negative acquisition value of ₱277,067.75. Similarly, accumulated depreciation and net book value were presented in abnormal/negative balances of ₱249,360.97 and ₱27,706.78 which understated the PPE account at year-end by ₱27,706.78.



	18)	In view of the aforementioned errors observed in the PPE Schedule, the total PPE amount of ₱363,315,457.82, as summarized below, or 43.61% of the total PPE balance of ₱833,171,718.65 as at year-end is rendered inaccurate/unreliable.

	19)	We recommended and the Superintendent agreed to undertake the following courses of action:



a)	instruct the Inventory Committee to complete the conduct of actual physical inventory of all PPEs including unserviceable items amounting to ₱241,965,986.15 and those received thru donation;



b)	assign an official who will monitor strictly the Inventory Committee’s conduct of actual physical inventory by requiring the submission of weekly/monthly status report thereon;



c)	instruct the Accountant and the Property Officer to reconcile their records based on the results of the actual physical inventory and effect the necessary adjustments;



d)	direct the officials concerned to follow up the titling of land occupied by the Academy and the valuation of all donated property items for proper recognition in the books of accounts; and



e)	instruct the Accountant to (i) review the details of the 617 PPE items reflected in the computerized PPE Schedule with noted errors/inconsistencies on the information relative to their acquisition costs and useful lives, and effect the necessary corrections and adjustments therefor; (ii) draw the necessary Journal Entry Voucher (JEV) to derecognize in the books the net book value of the two vehicles disposed thru donation in the amount of ₱891,369.09; and (iii) analyze the composition of Other PPEs account totaling to ₱241,965,986.15; reclassify them to the appropriate PPE categories; and provide for the respective depreciation expenses.





Unreliable Inventory account balances - ₱17,372,001.02



2)	The Academy failed to investigate, reconcile and adjust the variance amounting to ₱12,961,164.46 between the Report on Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) and the Accounting records thus, rendering the reliability of the year-end balances of the Inventories account doubtful as at year-end, inconsistent with Sections 7 and 13, Chapter 8 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I, and Section 491 of the Government Accounting and Auditing Manual (GAAM), Volume I.



	1)	Section 7, Chapter 8 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I, states that when inventories are sold, exchanged, or distributed, their carrying amount shall be recognized as an expense in the period in which the related revenue is recognized. If there is no related revenue, the expense is recognized when goods are distributed or the related service is rendered.



	2)	Section 13, supra, states that Physical count/inventory, which is required semi-annually, is an indispensable procedure for checking the integrity of property custodianship.



	3)	Section 17(i), supra, provides that Report on the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) (Appendix 66) – shall be used to report the physical count of supplies by type of inventory as at a given date. It shows the balance of inventory items per card and per count and shortage/overage, if any. These include the semi-expendable property wherein the issue is covered by ICS.



	4)	Moreover, as mentioned in Appendix 66, the report shall be reconciled with the Supplies Ledger Cards (SLCs) and Stock Cards (SCs) maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit, and Property and/or Supply Division/Unit, respectively. Any discrepancy shall be verified and/or adjusted accordingly.



	5)	In addition, consistent with the afore-cited provision on the required reconciliation of records of concerned offices, Section 491(i.b) of the same Manual, requires that All discrepancies between physical and book inventories must be investigated and cleared immediately. If necessary, written explanations shall be required from persons responsible.



	6)	Comparison of the Inventories accounts per General Ledger (GL) and the Report of Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) showed the following composition and discrepancies:

	7)	Further audit of the accounts disclosed that Management had not fully addressed some of the deficiencies raised in the previous Annual Audit Reports (AARs), thus, affecting the reliability of the reported balances of ₱17,372,001.02 as at December 31, 2020. These deficiencies include the following:



a)	Review of the GL revealed that the variances were mostly errors carried over from the CY 2014 beginning balances. Also, analysis of debits and credits of the accounts for the period covered 2015 to 2020 showed that there was no recording of inventory issuances from the year 2014 and previous years, which explained the big difference/variance in the balances; 



b)	Included in the Report on the Physical Count of Dental Supplies were several items amounting to ₱13,277.50 which were already expired a long time ago and those near the expiration date - January 2020, but still recognized in the books. It was previously recommended that the Inventory Custodian prepare Waste Materials Report (WMR) for the disposal of the expired items.



Section 17(h), supra, provides that Waste Materials Report (WMR) (Appendix 65) – shall be used by the Property and/or Supply Custodian to report all waste materials such as destroyed spare parts and other materials considered scrap due to replacement.



Appendix 65 instructed that the WMR shall be used by the Supply and/or Property Custodian to report all waste materials previously taken up in the books of accounts as assets or in his/her custody so that they may be properly disposed of and derecognized from the books.



c)	Obviously, that there was no reconciliation conducted between and among the Accounting and Supply Office/inventory custodians as evidenced by the large amount of unreconciled beginning balances contrary to Section 491(i.b) of the Government Accounting and Auditing Manual (GAAM), Volume I, which requires the investigation and reconciliation of noted discrepancies between actual physical count and accounting records.



	8)	The continuous failure of management to reconcile the accounting and property/inventory records for inventory items rendered the recorded balances of ₱12,961,164.46 inaccurate and unreliable as at year-end, affecting the fair presentation of the Agency’s financial statements. 



	9)	We reiterated our prior years’ audit recommendations and the Superintendent agreed to undertake the following courses of actions:



a)	Instruct the Accountant and concerned accounting personnel together with the personnel in charge of the Supply, Mess, and Medical Sections to (i) verify the cause of the variance amounting to ₱12,961,164.46 and draw the necessary journal entries to adjust the same, if warranted; and (ii) conduct periodic reconciliation of their respective records for the Inventories accounts to avoid discrepancies and subsequent losses of agency assets as provided in the GAM;



b)	Advise the Assistant Superintendent for Administration and Finance and Chairperson of Inventory Committee to monitor and require the submission of the results of reconciliation of Inventory records among the aforementioned personnel concerned; and



c)	Direct the Dental Unit to prioritize the preparation of Waste Materials Report (WMRs) for the long-expired items for proper disposal and dropping from the books of accounts in accordance with Section 17(h), Chapter 8 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I.





Lapses in Cash Management



Doubtful balances of Cash-Collecting Officer, Advances for Payroll and Petty Cash Fund (PCF) accounts - ₱4,475,543.73



3)	The correctness, existence, and reliability of the Subsidiary Ledger (SL) balances of Cash-Collecting Officer, Cash Advances, and Petty Cash Fund (PCF) accounts of ₱674,364.58, ₱705,852.67 and ₱475,000.00, respectively, as of various dates were uncertain due to unreconciled differences of ₱4,475,543.73 and weaknesses in internal control in the handling, monitoring, recording and reporting of the cash accountabilities of seven accountable officers, exposing government funds to misappropriation, contrary to the pertinent regulations of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I, COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012, and Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1445. Moreover, expenses amounting to ₱12,521.75, deemed to be personal in nature, were inappropriately charged against the PCF of the Medical Unit inconsistent with Section 3 of COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012 which prohibits irregular and unnecessary expenditures.



	1)	Our examination of the cash and accounts of ten Accountable Officers (AOs) showed total accountabilities amounting to ₱4,475,273.52 as of various dates, detailed as follows:

	2)	Sections 123 and 124 of P.D. No. 1445 put the direct responsibility on the Agency Head for the installation, implementation and monitoring of methods and measures to safeguard Agency assets and check the accuracy and reliability of its accounting data, among others.



	3)	Financial statements are the means by which the information accumulated and processed in financial accounting is periodically communicated to the users. Paragraph 15 of International Public Sector Accounting Standard (IPSAS) 1 defines the financial statements as the structured representation of the financial position and financial performance of an entity. 



	4)	Moreover, Paragraph 27 of the same standard provides that financial statements shall present fairly the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses set out in IPSASs. The application of IPSASs, with additional disclosures when necessary, is presumed to result in financial statements that achieve a fair presentation. (Emphasis added.)



	5)	Consistent with the afore-cited standard, Section 30 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I, requires an entity to present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that meets a number of qualitative characteristics such as reliability, among others, which is an attribute that makes an information in the financial statements useful to users.



	6)	Likewise, Section 4 of Chapter 19, supra, states that the responsibility for the fair presentation and reliability of financial statements rests with the management of the reporting entity, particularly the head of finance/accounting office and the head of entity or his authorized representative. (Emphasis added.)



	7)	In addition, Section 12, Chapter 2, supra, provides the books of accounts such as General Ledgers (GLs) and Subsidiary Ledgers (SLs) where the totals of the SL balances shall be reconciled with the corresponding GL controlling account by the Accounting Division/Unit.



	8)	Finally, one of the roles of the Agency Accountant is to supervise and oversee the personnel of Accounting Unit in performing their assigned duties and responsibilities as provided under the Quality Operations Manual (QOM) 7.0 of the PMMA.



	9)	Contrary to the aforementioned regulations, deficiencies were noted in the recording and reporting of cash under the Cash-Collecting Officer and Advances for Payroll accounts as discussed in detail below:



a)	Huge discrepancy between the SL balance and per audit of accountabilities of the Academy Cashier - ₱591,808.73



	10)	The accountabilities under the Academy Cashier are recorded under Cash-Collecting Officer and Advances for Payroll accounts. Comparison of the SL balances of these accounts as against the audited balances differed by ₱790,629.58 and ₱198,820.85, respectively, arrived at as follows:

	11)	Verification of the SL disclosed that the difference in the Cash-Collecting Officer could be attributed to the following causes: 



Particulars

Amount

1. Unrecorded collections (deposits)

(₽336,618.38)

2. Unidentified Beginning Balances

6,702.33

3. Incorrect use of fund and SL of AO in recording collections (deposits)

(160,341.00)

4. Under (over) recognition of collections (deposits)

(460.28)

5. Double recognition of collections (deposits)

(295,988.15)

6. Actual deposit of collections was made to an incorrect bank which understated one fund and overstated the other

(3,924.00)

Net overstatement 

(P790,629.58)

	12)	It was a common observation that the Cashier’s Office usually made fund transfers in order to correct erroneous deposits.			



	13)	On the other hand, scrutiny of the details of the SL balances for Advances for Payroll of the Acting Cashier revealed errors in recording and misclassifications as follows: 



Particulars

Amount

1.Incorrect use of fund and SL of AO in recording grant/liquidation

(₽52,724.67)

2. Double recognition of liquidation

6. Late recording of grant

406,582.76

7. Late recording of liquidation

(246,122.56)

Net Understatement  

P198,820.85



	14)	In summary, a net difference/variance of ₱591,808.73 was arrived at in the audit of the aforementioned accounts as of cash examination date- November 11, 2020.



	15)	The foregoing errors were incurred several years ago, but have remained unadjusted which denote lack/absence of monitoring and supervision over the work of subordinates by the Agency Accountant.



	16)	Consequently, the continual failure to adjust the errors adversely affected the accuracy and reliability of the cash account balances from year to year, inconsistent with Sections 123 and 124 of P.D. No. 1445, Paragraph 27 of IPSAS 1, Section 12 and 30 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, and the Agency’s QOM 7.0.

 

b)	Huge discrepancy between the SL balance and per audit of accountabilities of the Cash Collecting Officer for PMO Trust Receipt Extension - (₱116,265.00)

	17)	Verification disclosed that the subsidiary ledger (SL) balance of the Cash Collecting Officer account, being maintained by the Collecting Officer at the PMO Trust Receipt Extension, differed by (₱116,265.00) as compared to the audited balances, as detailed below.

	18)	Further verification disclosed that the difference in balances was caused by the incorrect use of SL account of AO. The deposit and collection amounting ₱116,700.00 and ₱435.00, respectively, were recognized under the SL of the Collecting Officer at the PMO Trust Receipt Extension instead of the SLs of the Collecting Officer of the Training Center-Manila and Cashier (Main Campus), respectively.



c)	Expenses incurred in the prior year were paid in the current year-₱292,785.85



	19)	Post-audit of the replenishment vouchers of the six Petty Cash Fund (PCF) Custodians being maintained in various offices of the Academy revealed that the CY 2019 petty expenses amounting to ₱292,785.85 were paid out of CY 2020 PCF.



	20)	The above practice is not compatible with the procedures prescribed under Section 35(c) of Chapter 6 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I, which states that at the end of the year, the PCFC shall submit to the Accounting Division/Unit all unreplenished Petty Cash Vouchers (PCVs) for recording in the books of accounts. As a consequence, the Expenses account for CY 2020 was overstated while Income was inversely understated by ₱292,785.85.



d)	Replenishment Vouchers with incomplete supporting documents-₱89,913.50



	21)	Further audit showed that various expenses charged against the PCF in various offices of the Academy, and cash advances granted to AOs of Supply Unit and Maintenance Unit amounting to ₱149,281.50 and ₱94,918.00, respectively, were not supported with appropriate documents such as canvass from at least three suppliers, summary/abstract of canvass and letter/memorandum requiring the rapid test, as required under Sections 35(a) and 36, Chapter 6 of the said Manual and Section 4(6) of P.D. No. 1445.



	22)	On the other hand, the reimbursements of travelling expenses out of the PCF for Travelling Fund were not consistently supported with Certificate of Appearance. Also, the attached Itineraries of Travel were not properly filled out, i.e. time of departure and arrival were left blank, contrary to COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012.



	23)	The failure to abide with the required documentation rendered doubt on the necessity, validity and propriety of the financial transactions.



e)	Cash Disbursement Record not maintained and insufficient details in the cashbook/PCF Record 



	24)	Our audit also showed that the AOs for PCF in the Transportation Unit, Training Center Extension, Supply Office, and Maintenance Office did not maintain Cash Disbursement Record (CDR) to monitor their cash advance balance, contrary to Section 17 of the GAM, Volume I which states that the Disbursing Officer shall maintain the Cash Disbursements Record (CDRec) to monitor the cash advances/payroll, current operating expenses, and special purpose/time-bound undertakings.

	25)	On the other hand, the details in the cashbook/PCF Record of the Transportation Unit, Training Center Main and Extension, and Supply Officer did not conform to the requirements of the PCFR as prescribed in Section 37 of the Manual (i.e. reference/check number and name of payee after every recorded transaction); thus, monitoring of the fund was not facilitated.



f)	Cash advances of Supply Officer was utilized by Maintenance Head - ₱91,500.00



	26)	Further verification of cash advances of  ₱91,500.00 drawn by the Supply Officer for Graduation Expenses revealed that the said cash advance was utilized by the Maintenance Head which was confirmed by the former. Our review of the supporting documents also showed that the Letter Request for the grant of cash advance as well as the Breakdown of Estimate of Expenses were both signed by the Maintenance Head in violation of Section 14(g) of GAM, Volume I which states that transfer of cash advances from one accountable officer to another shall not be allowed.



g)	Expenses charged to PCF deemed personal in nature-₱12,521.75



	27)	Review of the expenses charged against the PCF for the Medical Unit showed expenses amounting to ₱12,521.75 per PCV No. 2020-12-140 dated 02/12/2020 which are deemed personal in nature. The expenses pertained to various grocery items consisting of white bread, eggs, oil, squash, mineral water, paper towel, alcohol, fuji apple, mini bath towel, dazz lemon, silka papaya lotion, babyflo jel, JB Cologne, nivea deodorant, J&J shampoo gold, JB active fresh powder, Bactidol 160ML, Paganini collection, and medicines. These items were purchased for one of the employees of the Academy who was hospitalized but there were no immediate relatives to attend to his needs. As stated in the letter dated November 9, 2020 of the Medical Officer IV, approved accordingly by the Superintendent, the Medical PCF was used in response to the medical emergency needs of the sick employee.



	28)	We understand the good intention of the Academy for approving the request for assistance; however, the expenses involved are considered personal in nature which were not in consonance with Section 4(2) of P.D. No. 1445 which states that government funds or property shall be spent or used solely for public purposes.



	29)	Under Section 3.1 of COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012, the afore-cited expenses are also considered “irregular”. As defined in the Circular, an irregular expenditure signifies an expenditure incurred without adhering to established rules, regulations, procedural guidelines, policies, principles or practices that have gained recognition in laws. Irregular expenditures are incurred if funds are disbursed without conforming to prescribed usages and rules of discipline. xxx. A transaction conducted in a manner that deviates or departs from, or which does not comply with standards set is deemed irregular. xxx.



	30)	The foregoing weaknesses/lapses are indications of weak internal control in the grant, handling and utilization of PCF/cash advances which may expose these funds to loss or misuse, the responsibility for which directly falls under the Agency Head pursuant to Section 124 of P.D. No. 1445.



	31)	We recommended and the Superintendent agreed to undertake the following courses of action:

a)	Instruct the Accountant to (i) effect the necessary adjusting entries to reconcile the balances of the Subsidiary Ledgers (SLs) with the audited balances of the Cash-Collecting Officer and Advances for Payroll accounts of the seven AOs; (ii) practice due care in the recognition of collections/deposits and grant/liquidation of cash advances to avoid numerous erroneous accounting entries; (iii) closely monitor and regularly check the entries of said accounts to ensure their accuracy;



b)	Direct the PCF Custodians to (i) submit to the Accounting Office all the unreplenished Petty Cash Vouchers (PCV) at the end of the year for proper recognition; and (ii) ensure that Petty Cash Vouchers (PCV) are supported with complete documents, as required under COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012, Sections 35(c) and 36 of Chapter 6 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I and Section 4 of P.D. No. 1445; 



c)	Require the Transportation Head and Special Disbursing Officer for Training Center Extension, Supply Officer and Maintenance Head to maintain Cash Disbursement Record to monitor cash advance balance; and ensure that the PCFR/cashbook details conform to the requirements of the PCFR as prescribed in Section 37of the above Manual; and



d)	Ensure that the transfer of cash advances from one accountable officer to another will not be allowed; and



e)	Cause the return to the Bureau of Treasury of the amount of ₱12,521.75 improperly charged against the PCF for the Medical Unit.  





Unreliable Receivable and Prepayment Accounts - ₱6,056,995.23



1)	The accuracy, existence, and reliability of various asset accounts presented in the Financial Statements (FS) as at December 31, 2020 were uncertain due to (a) unaccounted/undocumented receivables of ₱3,380,183.48; and (b) unadjusted expired portions of prepayments amounting  to ₱2,677,162.83, thus, misstating the Assets and Equity Accounts, ultimately affecting the faithful representation of the FS contrary to Sections 4 and 30 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I, Paragraph 15, International Public Sector Accounting Standard (IPSAS) 1, and Sections 123 and 124 of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1445.



	1)	Paragraph 27 of the IPSAS 1 provides that financial statements shall present fairly the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses set out in IPSASs. The application of IPSASs, with additional disclosures when necessary, is presumed to result in financial statements that achieve a fair presentation. (Emphasis added.)



	2)	Consistent with the afore-cited standard, Section 30 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I, requires an entity to present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that meets a number of qualitative characteristics such as reliability, among others, which is an attribute that make the information provided in the financial statements useful to users.



	3)	Likewise, Section 4 of Chapter 19, supra, states that the responsibility for the fair presentation and reliability of financial statements rests with the management of the reporting entity, particularly the head of finance/accounting office and the head of entity or his authorized representative. (Emphasis added.)



	4)	Our financial audit covering the calendar year 2020 revealed that there were seven asset accounts whose balances were unaccounted/undocumented and/or requiring adjustment as summarized below:

	5)	A detailed analysis of the above accounts disclosed the following deficiencies:



	a)	Unreliable balances of Accounts Receivable - ₱1,602,963.89



	6)	The existence and validity of the Accounts Receivable of ₱1,602,963.89 or 58% of the total Accounts Receivable of ₱2,785,545.39 as of December 31, 2020 could not be established due to lack of supporting schedules/documents to support the recorded amount of ₱1,598,410.32 while an erroneous recording of ₱4,553.57 remained unadjusted.



	7)	As discussed in the previous AOM issued, the balance of ₱609,030.32 was already in the books of accounts since CY 2005 without any details. The same was carried over in the subsidiary ledger (SL) as beginning balance for the purpose of setting up the e-NGAS in CY 2005 but the existence thereof was questionable owing to absence of records and reports/supporting schedules. 



	8)	Likewise, the Accounting Office failed to provide the details/breakdown for the amount of ₱989,380.00, representing accrued income for the tuition fees of Graduate School for the period covered 2006 to 2015.



	9)	In view of the foregoing circumstances, abovementioned receivables totaling to ₱1,598,410.32 became dormant.



	10)	Further review of the General Ledger (GL) showed journal entries amounting to ₱4,553.57 that require an adjustment due to incorrect amount of fund transferred for the payment of a supplier. Incidentally, this amount was erroneously charged to Income Account instead of Miscellaneous Fund; to wit:

₱4,553.57



a)	Unaccounted/unreconciled receivables from the DBM-PS -₱88,573.28



	11)	The balance of Due from National Government Agencies (NGAs) of ₱88,573.28 as of December 31, 2020 pertains to the undelivered supplies from the DBM Procurement Service (PS) of which ₱73,262.55 has been outstanding for more than six years under the Income Fund; to wit:

Total

	12)	The accumulated undelivered items from the PS-DBM were noted in the previous Annual Audit Reports (AARs). Since then, the personnel concerned have not fully reconciled unserved items with the PS-DBM resulting in the accumulation of unaccounted or long outstanding account balances.



b)	Unsupported Receivables - Disallowances/Charges - ₱463,090.10



	13)	Under the GAM for NGAs, Volume III, the Receivables-Disallowances/Charges account is used to recognize the amounts of disallowances/charges in audit due from public/private individuals/entities which have become final and executory. Credit this account for settlement of disallowances/ charges.



	14)	Per COA records, there was no outstanding Notice(s) of Disallowance (ND) with Notice of Finality of Decision (NFD) issued to the Academy as of December 31, 2020. However, our review of the related GL showed that a sum of ₱467,994.75 was reflected as beginning balance of the account since CY 2015 under the General Fund with no available details in the Accounting Office. 



	15)	On the other hand, the GL maintained under the Trust Fund disclosed that the account Receivables-Disallowances/Charges was erroneously credited for ₱4,904.65 instead of Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) account to recognize the settlement made on the ND.  Since the expenses subject of the disallowance were incurred in the prior period, and there was no corresponding NFD yet, the credit to the Receivables account is a departure from the regulations of GAM, Volume III, quoted as follows:



Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) account is used to recognize the cumulative results of normal and continuous operations of an agency including prior period adjustments, effect of changes in accounting policy and other capital adjustments. xxx



c)	Doubtful balances of Other Receivables - ₱1,215,165.13



	16)	The year-end balance of Other Receivables account was ₱1,673,225.45 composed of the following:

	17)	As shown above, receivables amounting to ₱1,215,165.13, aged seven to 16 years, or 73% of the total balance of the Other Receivables account of ₱1,673,225.45 as of December 31, 2020 were of doubtful validity and existence.



	18)	Management previously commented that the condition was not yet totally addressed due to the absence of related documents that were believed to have been left at the old site of the Academy in Taguig, Metro Manila. Also, they mentioned that the financial records at the old site prior to CY 2005 were not that organized making it difficult for them to set up accurate beginning balances. 



	19)	Be that as it may, it should not have deterred Management from exerting more effort to provide a more reliable balance of the account pursuant to Section 121 (2) of P.D. No. 1445 which states that the financial statements shall be based on official accounting records kept in accordance with law and the generally accepted accounting principles and standards.



	20)	Going back to the table above, the amount of ₱184,982.55 and ₱2,064.36 represent uncollected telephone billings since CY 2005 to CY 2013 under the GF and Income Fund, respectively. The matter was communicated to the Management in the previous years, and they tried to retrieve the relative documents for further verification; however, as of this writing, these remained uncollected.

 

	21)	The failure of the Management to exert more effort to collect receivables is not consistent with Section 64 of the GAAM, Volume I, which provides that Quarterly, each agency accounting unit shall prepare a statement scheduling overdue accounts receivable. The agency head, or his authorized representative, shall review and sign this statement as an indication that he has examined the list of overdue accounts and has instituted, or will institute, action for their collection.

	22)	Moreover, we observed that the Academy resorted to inter-fund borrowings to settle tax remittances. As explained, this was because the BIR did not approve of creating an additional Electronic Filing and Payment System (EFPS) account for other funds being maintained by the Academy. Nonetheless, our review of the account showed increasing amounts of receivables since March 2019 due to unsettled/unreturned funds resulting in an outstanding balance of ₱458,060.32 or 27.38% of the total Other Receivables account, as detailed below:

	23)	We also noted an abnormal balance of ₱53,750.00 under the Miscellaneous Fund, which decreased the account balance by the same amount.



	24)	We observed further that Other Receivables account was used to record inter-fund borrowings instead of Due from Other Funds account to represent fairly the transfers to other funds and/or receivables from other funds of the agency, consistent with the Chart of Accounts provided under Volume III of the GAM.



d)	Undocumented Guaranty Deposits - ₱10,040.00



	25)	Our review of the GL showed that this account has been outstanding since January 1, 2015 or non-moving for a period of six years. The Accounting Office failed anew to submit the details and documentation we have requested in our Audit Query dated November 04, 2020.



e)	Unadjusted Prepaid Insurance and Other Prepayments - ₱2,677,162.83



	26)	Section 50, Chapter 19 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I, provides that adjusting journal entries are made at the end of an accounting period to allocate revenue and expenses to the period in which they actually occurred. AJEs are required every time a financial statement is prepared to make the statement truly reflective of the financial condition of the entity as at a given period. Adjustments are of two main types: (a) Accrued items; and (b) Deferred items.



	27)	On the other hand, Section 53, supra, explains that Adjustment for Deferred Items are adjusting entries transferring data previously recognized in an asset account to an expense account, or data previously recognized in a liability account to a revenue account. In contrast to the accrued items, it requires asset/expense adjustments and liability/revenue adjustments.



a)	Asset/Expense Adjustments. These pertain to assets, portion of which are consumed/used/incurred at the end of the accounting period. Examples of these adjustments are prepayments. Prepayments are expenses paid before they are incurred. At the end of the accounting period, the expired portion shall be determined and an adjusting journal entry shall be prepared to recognize the expense applicable to the period being reported.



xxx



	28)	The following description of accounts for proper recognition/accounting for fidelity bond premiums and insurance paid for government properties are provided for under GAM, Volume III:

This account is used to recognize the amounts of prepayments not falling under any of the specific prepayment accounts. Credit this account for the expended amount.

This account is used to recognize the amount of premiums paid by the agency for the fidelity bonds of accountable officers. This account shall be closed to the Revenue and Expense Summary account.

Insurance Expenses

50215030

Debit

This account is used to recognize the amount of premiums paid by the agency for the insurable risks of government properties. This account shall be closed to the Revenue and Expense Summary account.



	29)	The audit of the payments of insurance for government properties of ₱2,563,615.23 and fidelity bond premiums of ₱113,547.60 showed that these transactions were recognized from January 2015 to September 2017 under the Prepaid Insurance and Other Prepayments accounts, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, the accounts were not adjusted accordingly to recognize the expensed portions or expired insurance since calendar year 2016 which consequently bloated the account balances, as detailed below:

113,547.60



TOTAL

₱2,677,162.83



	30)	The non-recognition of the expensed portion or expired prepaid insurance was not in accordance with Sections 50 and 53, Chapter 19 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I, consequently overstating the total assets as of December 31, 2020 by ₱2,677,162.83. In effect, the Accumulated Surplus (Deficit) was also overstated. 



	31)	Further audit also showed that the Accountant has been treating fidelity bond premiums of bonded AOs as Other Prepayments instead of Fidelity Bond Premiums account considering that the nature of the transaction does not fall among the prepayments defined in the Chart of Accounts in GAM, Volume III.



	32)	The responsibility for the fair presentation and reliability of financial statements rests with the management of the reporting agency; thus, all appropriate steps should have been taken to ensure that all financial data presented were accurate, reliable and truthful.



	33)	We recommended and the Superintendent agreed to undertake the following courses of actions:



a)	Require the Accountant to (i) exert more effort to review the unaccounted/non-moving/dormant receivables; locate the necessary documents to substantiate the balances totaling to ₱3,380,183.48 and effect the necessary adjustment/correcting entry as warranted; (ii) send demand/collection letters to identified/verified receivable accounts; (iii) prepare the necessary documents to support fund transfers to settle inter-fund borrowings due to tax remittance made thru other funding source totaling to ₱458,060.32; (iv) draw the necessary correcting/adjusting entries on the expired or expensed portions of prepayments amounting ₱2,676,811.75; and (v) closely monitor and regularly check the accounting entries for financial transactions to ensure their accuracy and fair presentation in the financial statements;



b)	Determine the proper official to (i) make representation to PS-DBM for the delivery of the unserved orders in the sum of ₱88,573.28; and (ii) devise a scheme that will reduce, if not eliminate, incidences of undelivered orders from PS-DBM; and



c)	Keep with the existing standards in the presentation of all financial information in the Financial Statements to make them more useful to all stakeholders and users. 





Academic Enhancement of Maritime Education and Training (AEMET) Project - ₱121,500,452.84



2)	Substantial implementation of the Academic Enhancement of Maritime Education and Training (AEMET) Project was not attained as evidenced by the Agency’s  (a) failure to meet the target number of eligible scholars/trainees; (b) non-implementation of various projects with fund allotment of ₱45,225,020.14 due to poor planning and execution strategies; and (c) inaction on accounting flaws in the monitoring of fund transfers and expenditures contrary to the pertinent provisions of the Memorandum of Agreement dated December 14, 2015 and Section 4(6) of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1445.



	1)	The Philippine Merchant Marine Academy (PMMA) is the only state-owned specialized maritime school in the country that prepares its students to become ship officers, both on-board and land-based, through education and training.



	2)	The Philippines, being the manning capital of the world, contributes 30% Filipino seafarers out of the 1.2 million mariners all over the world. Inevitably, the Philippine Merchant Marine Academy (PMMA) recognizes the existing labor shortage especially for officers and the need to prepare the Maritime Education and Training (MET) schools, including the faculty members, to address the continuous demand for competitiveness of its products.



	3)	In line with the faculty and student development, both national and international, as initiated by the Commission on Higher Education (CHED), the PMMA is committed to the advancement of maritime education and training; thus, the Academic Enhancement for Maritime Project or Project AEM was launched.



	4)	The AEM Project has two major integral components: (a) Human Resource Development (HRD) and (b) Capacity Building in Maritime Research and Development (MR&D).



	5)	The HRD is the scholarship component of the AEM Project wherein the faculty and students of PMMA shall be granted scholarships both local and international to gain expertise in maritime-related field. The MR&D involves capacity building and partnership in research involving the faculty researchers in pursuit of new knowledge related to maritime.



	6)	The objective of the AEM project is not only directed to the concerns of the HRD and MR&D of the PMMA. It intends to expand its perspective by assisting other maritime schools in the country through training and collaboration. In this way, CHED can address the issue on the quality of the MET schools in the country and eventually, the Philippine Government can continuously provide the shipping industry with quality seafarers.



	7)	Excerpts from the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) and the PMMA on December 28, 2015 are shown below: 



It is the specific responsibility of CHED, as well as PMMA being the premier institution of higher learning in Marine Transportation and Marine Engineering, to ensure that the country’s maritime higher education programs meet the 1978 Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers, as amended; thereby ensuring the Philippines’ continuing retention in the International Maritime Organization’s White List of countries eligible to provide the merchant marine fleet with officers-in-charge and officers;



On 7 December 2015, in line with the said objective, the Commission en Banc (CEB) approved and rewarded a grant of financial assistance to the Academic Enhancement for Maritime Education and Training (Project AEMET) –with additional amendments on the amount of the assistance issued on 14 December 2015 and 23 December 2015 – to PMMA which agreed to devote its facilitative services for this purpose.



	8)	The financial assistance of ₱121,500,452.84 for the different components of the AEMET Project was released through the PMMA in accordance with the approved Schedule of Milestones and Tranche Payments as follows:

	9)	Article 2(A) of the same MOA further states that such releases shall be subject to the submission of duly audited financial statements and liquidation report as provided under the applicable Philippine Government accounting and auditing laws, rules and regulations.

	

	10)	As this is a four-year project, completion was expected on December 31, 2019. However, during the whole duration of the project, the CHED only released the first tranche for the first phase amounting to ₱44,517,197.40 on May 24, 2016, broken down as follows.

	11)	Supposedly, the first tranche shall cover the expenditures of the project for the period covered January to May 2016, and since this was already delayed, the timetable for the project activities had to be adjusted accordingly to which the concerned official of the CHED concurred thru an e-mail to the AEMET Project Manager on September 29, 2016. Likewise, in the same e-mail, it was suggested that the first release of funds have to be utilized in full before the CHED will release the succeeding tranches subject to submission of liquidation report for the previous fund transfer.



	12)	Relatedly, the funds for Faculty Scholarship Program (FSP) scheduled to start in August 2016 were not received because the initial receipt of funds on May 24, 2016 was not yet liquidated. Nonetheless, if the Program will not push through as planned, the timetable for the implementation thereof will be delayed for another year.  As such, the first tranche received from the CHED was used to fund the related expenses.



	13)	Our review of the AEMET fund utilization as of December 31, 2020 disclosed that the PMMA was only able to spend a total of ₱32,651,887.40 or 27% of the approved budget of ₱121,500,452.84, as shown below:

	14)	In view of the foregoing, several lapses were noted in the program implementation as follows:



	a)	Unimplemented programs - ₱88,848,565.44



	15)	Our review of the AEMET Four-Year Work and Financial Plan disclosed that the Academy failed to carry out or undertake 73% of the targeted projects; to wit:

₱88,848,565.44

73%





	16)	The Project Manager disclosed that during the initial implementation of the project, there were programs/activities that needed revisions such as the Short-Term Program for MHEI Faculty with equivalent budget of ₱21,447,862.14 or 17.65% of the total budget of the project, thus, contributed to the unimplemented programs.



	17)	In addition, as explained in one of the project reports, it was later found out that the AEMET funds which originated from the Higher Education Development Fund (HEDF) could not be used for related capital outlays which comprised ₱25,000,000.00 or 20.58% of the total budget of the project, thus, had to be re-allocated.



	18)	Nonetheless, with the changes in the officials-in-charge in the CHED Technical Panel for Maritime Education (chaired by the Administrator of the Maritime Industry Authority (MARINA) and the Official/Committee assigned by CHED for the project development and implementation), the Academy’s designated Program Management Team (PMT) encountered challenges in presenting the revisions and securing approval of the same.



	19)	Moreover, as shown in Appendix A, the target number of scholars was not achieved despite a big budget of ₱25,253,920.39 due to limited applicants eligible under the Program.



	20)	Notwithstanding, the foregoing deficiencies denote poor planning in terms of the determination/identification of specific programs/projects, the manner of program execution, and the possible number of scholars that will benefit from the different programs; thus, the project objective to improve/enhance maritime education in the country was not attained.



	21)	Likewise, the failure of the PMT to implement 73% of the AEMET plan had significantly affected the attainment of the Academy’s commitment towards the advancement of maritime education and training.



	b)	Scholarship grants not supported with complete eligibility requirements - ₱26,797,931.35



	22)	Meanwhile, the validity and propriety of the total expenditures spent for 12 scholars for Master’s Degree and one for Doctorate Degrees with cost aggregating to ₱26,797,931.35 were doubtful due to inadequacy of eligibility documents required in Annex A of the MOA, contrary to Section 4(6) of P.D. No. 1445 which states that claims against government funds shall be supported with complete documentation. Presented below are our observations during the verification of applicants’ submitted documents; to wit:

4. Have no other scholarships at the time of application





c. Unreconciled balances between the CHED and Academy records for the fund transfer- ₱11,253,282.05   



	23)	Confirmation with the CHED’s balance on the funds transferred to the PMMA and comparison of the results with the accounting records of the Academy for Due to National Government Agencies (NGAs) account disclosed a variance of ₱11,523,282.05; to wit:

(₱11,253,282.05)



	24)	Volume III of the GAM for NGAs provides the following descriptions of Due to NGAs and Other Payables accounts.



Due to NGAs 

20201050

Credit 

This account is used to recognize the receipt of funds for delivery of goods/services as authorized by law, fund transfers from NGAs, other than the BIR, for implementation of specific programs or projects and other interagency transactions. Debit this account for delivery of goods /services, liquidation of funds received and settlement of liabilities.

Other Payables

29999990

Credit 

This account is used to recognize other liabilities not falling under any of the specific payable accounts. Debit this account for settlement of liabilities.

	25)	Consequently, the Inter-Agency Payables (Due to NGAs) was overstated by a net amount of ₱11,253,282.05 as at year-end due to the Accounting Unit’s failure to properly account for the AEMET funds received from the CHED and erroneous recording to Other Payables of the amount returned to the latter in July 2020. Moreover, the related liquidation reports were not submitted yet for audit. 



	26)	As of this writing, the only ongoing program is the Doctorate Scholarship Program of one faculty member from the Maritime Academy of Asia and the Pacific (MAAP) which is expected to be completed by the year 2021, pending approval by the Academy’s Board of Trustees (BOT) and the CHED of his request for an extension of the program due to the COVID-19 pandemic.



	27)	We recommended and the Superintendent agreed, together with the key officials of the Academy, to: (i) carefully assess the programs/projects identified by partner government agencies to ensure their relevance to the objectives and training needs of the Academy;  avoid premature revisions; and possible incurrence of delay during the project execution phase; (ii) conduct an in-depth evaluation of the viable programs related to maritime training and education to make them sustainable;  and (iii) make sure that the timeline set with partner government agencies for every project is realistic and strictly followed since the timing of execution determines the success of a project.



	28)	We also recommended and the Superintendent agreed to require the Accountant to (i) prepare the necessary adjustment to correct the overstatement of the Inter-Agency Payables (Due to NGAs) of ₱11,253,282.05 stated above; and (ii) submit the required liquidation reports therefor.



	29)	Likewise, we recommended and the Superintendent agreed to submit the documents enumerated in Appendix D to enable the Audit Team to render a decision in audit.





Implementation of Various Projects for CY 2020 - ₱39,100,922.93



3)	Due to non-conduct of Early Procurement Activities (EPA) and deficient procurement planning, two major projects such as Acquisition of Various Equipment and IT software and Renovation/Extension of Various Buildings aggregating to ₱39,100,922.93 were not implemented/completed in CY 2020 as planned, contrary to Section 19 of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 11465, the General Provisions of the General Appropriations Act (GAA) for FY 2020 and pertinent provisions of the 2016 Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (RIRR)  of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9184, thus, depriving the students and employees of the immediate use of upgraded and modernized facilities.



	1)	In Calendar Year 2020, the Academy had 24 programs/projects/activities (PPAs) which included, among others, the acquisition of various equipment and IT software and renovation/extension of various buildings with a total cost of ₱62,071,959.53, as detailed in Appendix E.



	2)	The status report submitted as of December 31, 2020 showed that 67% or 16 out of the 24 projects listed were not implemented and all of the related contracts have just commenced on December 29, 2020. Meanwhile, six projects or 25% were already completed and the remaining two projects are ongoing. 



	3)	Our review of the pertinent documents and interview with concerned officials disclosed the following lapses/deficiencies in the procurement planning and processes that were identified as the contributing factors in the non-implementation of 16 PPAs funded under Capital Outlay (CO) of the GAA for FY 2020; to wit:



				a)	Early Procurement Activities (EPA) not undertaken for various projects funded under the Capital Outlay of the GAA for FY 2020. 



	4)	Section 19 of R.A. No. 11465 or the General Provisions for the GAA of FY 2020 states that notwithstanding the mandatory procurement timelines under R.A. No. 9184 and its IRR, agencies are authorized to undertake early procurement activities as soon as the proposed national budget is submitted to Congress. However, agencies may only proceed with the issuance of notice of award of contract upon approval or enactment of their respective appropriations and issuance of budget authorization document and based on the amount authorized therein.



	5)	Further review of the Status Report disclosed several observations, as summarized below:



							a)	A total of 18 or 75% of the 24 procurement projects were undertaken through competitive public bidding;



a)	The earliest advertisements for projects undertaken through competitive bidding were posted in March, May and June 2020 with one procurement project scheduled for each month.



b)	Advertisement and/or the issuance of the Invitation to Bid (ITB)/Request for Expression of Interest (REI) for 13 procurement projects under public bidding was done only in November 2020, where eight out of these 13 projects were posted/advertised on November 26, 2020 or nearly the end of the year.



c)	In summary, during the first and second semesters of CY 2020, five and 19, respectively, of the 24 targeted procurement activities were started for implementation, staggered per quarter as follows:

d)	Notices to Proceed (NTPs) for the 13 bid projects in the 4th Quarter were all received by the respective contractors on the same date- December 29, 2020.



	6)	As explained in the status report, the 2020 Capital Outlay Projects of PMMA was slightly hampered due to the delay of the release of GAA 2019, the implementation of the 2019 Capital Outlay projects coincided with the 2020 supposed-to-be early procurement activities. Thus, the 2019 projects were prioritized. Then, when 2020 Capital Outlay projects were to be implemented during the 1st and 2nd quarters of CY 2020, the COVID19 health crisis happened which resulted to the accumulation of procurement activities mostly on the last quarter of 2020. Moreover, due to the busy schedule of the Board of Trustee members, the scheduling and approval of procurement activities were subject to their availability and unfortunately fell on the last month of the calendar year.



	7)	We understand that the unforeseeable circumstances such as the delay in the release of GAA 2019 and the implementation of community quarantine due to COVID-19 pandemic both affected the timely and efficient conduct of procurement activities of the Agency. Notwithstanding, all procurement activities, except for one, funded under Capital Outlay for CY 2019 were completed within that same year.



	8)	To our mind, the implementation of the CY 2019 Capital Outlay (CO) projects, which coincided with the CY 2020 CO projects, had no effect on the procurement activities for CY 2020. This is because the responsibility to monitor the actual execution of the CY 2019 CO projects and the conduct of new procurement activities for the current year was delineated separately to the Planning Office (Item 4.2.13 of the Academy’s Quality Operations Manual) and the BAC Office, respectively.



	9)	It is also worthy to mention that prior to the onset of COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, only one bidding process was started by the Academy out of the 18 CO projects. The bulk of which or 13 bid proceedings were undertaken only in November 2020 as mentioned in the observations above.



	10)	Based on the foregoing observations, had the EPA been executed promptly for the CY 2020 CO projects as prescribed under Section 19 of the General Provisions for GAA FY 2020 and the pertinent guidelines provided under the 2016 RIRR of R.A. No. 9184, the BAC would have maximized the Agency’s accomplishments for procurement thru bidding prior to the onset of COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020.



b)	Deficient procurement planning by the implementing units



	11)	Section 7.1 of the 2016 RIRR of R.A. No. 9184 states that all procurement shall be within the approved budget of the Procuring Entity and should be meticulously and judiciously planned by the Procuring Entity. Consistent with government fiscal discipline measures, only those considered crucial to the efficient discharge of governmental functions shall be included in the Annual Procurement Plan (APP). xxx



	12)	Moreover, Section 7.3, supra, provides that in the preparation of the indicative APP, the end-user or implementing units of the Procuring Entity shall formulate their respective Project Procurement Management Plans (PPMPs) for their different programs, activities, and projects (PAPs). The PPMP shall include the extent/size of contract scopes/packages; the time schedule for each procurement activity and for the contract implementation; and the estimated budget for the general components of the contract, among others, which will be likewise included in the indicative and final APP.



	13)	Based on the specific needs, the end-user or implementing units of the Procuring Entity shall be responsible for the preparation of all documents necessary for the procurement activity, including but shall not be limited to, the technical specifications, scope of work, or terms of reference. (Emphasis added.)



	14)	In addition, Section 7.3.5 provides that as soon as the GAA, corporate budget, or appropriation ordinance, as the case may be, becomes final, the end-user or implementing units shall revise and adjust the PPMPs to reflect the budgetary allocation for their respective PAPs. The revised PPMPs shall be submitted to the BAC, through its Secretariat, for the final recommendation of the methods of procurement. The indicative APP shall then be revised and approved in accordance with Section 7.2 of this IRR.



	15)	Our review of the Annual Procurement Plan (APP) for CY 2020 and the PPMP for various projects funded out of Capital Outlay (CO) under the GAA for FY 2020 showed no specific schedule and milestones for each procurement activity, including deadlines and timeframes, from Advertisement/Posting of IB/REI, Submission/Opening of Bids, to the awarding and signing of the contracts.



	16)	The failure to implement/complete the targeted 16 projects can be attributed to the failure of the Management to properly plan the timing/schedule for each procurement activity, which should have been assessed and reviewed, and adjusted accordingly during the implementation of community quarantine, or similar restrictions where movement of people and mass public and private transport are limited, for the efficient conduct of all procurement activities, regardless of procurement modality.



	17)	Further inquiry disclosed that there were revisions in the technical specifications, design for the renovation/extension of various buildings and in the cost estimates for some of the CO projects which caused delay in the conduct of procurement procedures. However, such revisions/changes could have been made when the GAA for FY 2020 became final on January 6, 2020 which required the end-user or implementing units to revise and adjust the PPMPs to reflect the budgetary allocation for their respective PAPs pursuant to Section 7.3.5 cited above. Also, along with the revision of PPMPs is the finalization of the technical specifications and design for the renovation/extension of various buildings which are pertinent supporting documents to the PPMP.



	18)	It is an admitted fact that changes to the individual PPMPs and the consolidated APP may be undertaken every six months or as often as may be required by the Agency Head as provided under Section 7.4, supra. Nonetheless, the big number of unimplemented projects only denotes that planning for procurement processes was poorly done by the respective end-users or implementing units of the Academy in terms of the preparation of technical specifications, engineering design, and in the estimation of cost.



	19)	The failure to finish the projects within the prescribed timeframe deprived the students and employees of the Academy the benefits from upgraded, improved and modernized facilities.



	20)	We recommended and the Superintendent, together with the other approving officials of the Academy, agreed to (a) ensure that the PPMPs and APP are completely and properly accomplished, and supported with well-studied and well-planned time schedule for each procurement activity; and (b) formulate plans that are adequate and time-bound to avoid unnecessary delay in the procurement process and implementation of the Agency’s PPAs.



	21)	In addition, we recommended and the Superintendent agreed to instruct the:



a)	BAC to undertake Early Procurement Activities (EPA) to expedite the procurement process for various projects of the Academy;



b)	End-users or implementing units to (i) properly plan their procurement projects which will include the time schedule for each procurement activity and for the contract implementation; the estimated budget for the general components of the contract; the technical specifications, scope of work, or terms of reference, among others; and (ii) meticulously and judiciously plan and study critical components of the procurement project such as the technical specifications, engineering design, and cost estimates to avoid unnecessary delay in the procurement proceedings and eventual execution of the projects;



c)	End-users or implementing units together with the Planning Office, the BAC and other concerned offices to (i) enhance the procurement planning processes and make sure that projects are implemented as planned, among others; and (ii) ensure the immediate completion of the ongoing projects and immediately resolve all issues/concerns pertaining to the project implementation; and



d)	Planning Office to perform regular and thorough monitoring and supervision of projects to safeguard the contracts and the interest of the Academy as well from disadvantageous terms and breach of rules and procedures.





Deficiencies in the procurement and implementation of the PMMA IT Software and Equipment CY 2019 Project -₱7,797,108.48



4)	Procedural lapses and deficiencies were noted in the procurement and implementation of the Philippine Merchant Marine Academy (PMMA) IT Software and Equipment CY 2019 Project amounting to ₱7,797,108.48 in violation of pertinent provisions of R.A. No. 9184 and its 2016 Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (RIRR); thus, the Academy was not assured of a fair, competitive and efficient implementation of awarded contracts.



	1)	In CY 2019, the Academy procured IT Software and Equipment with total appropriations and contract costs of ₱8,695,000.00 and ₱7,797,108.48, respectively. The contracts were awarded to three suppliers on different dates with their bid prices considered as the Lowest Calculated and Responsive Bid (LCRB) as shown below:

	3)	Lots A and B described above were paid in full under Check Numbers 166967 and 167055 dated April 28, 2020 and June 25, 2020, respectively.



	4)	Our post-audit, review and evaluation of the procurement contract, disbursement vouchers and other related documents showed procedural lapses and deficiencies in the procurement and implementation of the Philippine Merchant Marine Academy (PMMA) IT Software and Equipment CY 2019 Project, which cast doubt on the regularity of the procurement processes and payments made. These are the following:



	a)	Inadequacy of documents -₱7,797,108.48 



	5)	Our review of the three contracts and other procurement documents showed the following lacking documents required under pertinent provisions of R.A. No. 9184 and its 2016 RIRR and Annex F of COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009, thus, rendering doubt on the regularity of the procurement processes and payments made therefor.



--	Approved Budget for Contract (ABC) with Detailed Quantity and Cost Estimates (Annex F of COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009);

--	Approved BAC Resolution on the Creation of the TWG for CY 2019 (Section 12.1.m. of 2016 Revised IRR);

--	Records on downloading of Bidding Documents from any of the said websites with corresponding official receipt paid upon submission of their Bids (Section 17.4 of 2016 Revised IRR);

--	Records of BAC on the Bid Documents issued with corresponding official receipt;

--	Notification Letter by the BAC Secretariat to all bidders who submitted their bid proposal to ensure transparency and accurate representation of the bid submission received through its PhilGEPS-registered physical address or official e-mail address within seven (7) calendar days from the date of the bid opening (Section 25.7 of the 2016 Revised IRR);

--	PhilGEPS Sworn Statement of each bidder (Section 8.5.2 of the 2016 Revised IRR); and 

--	Printout of posting of Notice of Award, Contract and Notice to Proceed to Agency website (if any) and to conspicuous place certified by the Head of BAC Secretariat (Section 37.1.6 of the 2016 Revised IRR);



	b)	Statement of All Ongoing and Completed Government and Private Contracts submitted by the bidder lacked pertinent information for effective and thorough conduct of post-qualification evaluation procedure.



	6)	Further review of bid documents and contract documents showed that the template provided by the Academy to be accomplished by the bidders for Statement of all its ongoing government and private contracts, including contracts awarded but not yet started, if any, whether similar or not similar in nature and complexity to the contract to be bid; and Statement of the Bidder’s SLCC similar to the contract to be bid lacked pertinent information. The template only included the date, name of contract, kinds of goods sold, contract amount and remarks for both statements, which is not in accordance with Item 12.1 (a.ii) of the Instructions to Bidders (ITB) stating that the two statements required shall indicate for each contract the following:



(ii.1)	name of the contract;

(ii.2)	date of the contract;

(ii.3) 	contract duration;

(ii.4) 	owner’s name and address;

(ii.5)	kinds of Goods;

(ii.6)	For Statement of Ongoing Contracts - amount of contract and value of outstanding contracts;

(ii.7)	For Statement of SLCC - amount of completed contracts, adjusted by the Bidder to current prices using PSA’s consumer price index, if necessary, for the purpose of meeting the SLCC requirement;

(ii.8)	date of delivery; and 

(ii.9)	end user’s acceptance or official receipt(s) or sales invoice issued for the contract, if completed, which shall be attached to the statements.



	7)	The existence of a complete set of documents would have facilitated the BAC and the TWG in the verification and/or inspection and testing of the goods/product, after-sales and/or maintenance capabilities, in applicable cases, as well as checking the following:



a. Delay in the partial delivery of goods amounting to ten percent (10%) of the contract price in its ongoing government and private contracts;

b. If any of these contracts shows the bidder’s failure to deliver or perform any or all of the goods or services within the period(s) specified in the contract or within any extension thereof granted by the Procuring Entity pursuant to a request made by the supplier prior to the delay, and such failure amounts to at least ten percent (10%) of the contract price; or

c. Unsatisfactory performance of the supplier’s obligations as per contract terms and conditions at the time of inspection.

	8)	Simply put, the lacking information would have helped the BAC and TWG to determine the bidder’s capacity to deliver the project without delay. We noted that as of October 8, 2020 the supplier has already incurred delay in the performance of the project. A separate discussion of such delay is under letter (d) of this audit observation. 

	

	9)	Moreover, we also noted that the statements submitted by PCI Innovations Tech Center Inc. were not duly signed/approved by the preparer/representative of the supplier.



c)	Two winning bidders not disqualified despite non-submission of the required latest income and business tax returns.



	10)	Further review of the bidding documents submitted by the two winning bidders, PCI Innovations Tech Center and Columbia Technologies Inc. for Lot A - Development of Maritime eLearning System and Virtual/Augmented Reality; and Lot B - 55 units Laptop, costing ₱4,170,000.00 and ₱2,485,400.00, respectively, showed that the latest income and business tax returns were not included.



	11)	Nonetheless, despite the non-submission of said documents, the contracts were still awarded to those two bidders contrary to Section 34.2., supra, which states that within five (5) calendar days from receipt by the bidder of the notice from the BAC that the bidder has the Lowest Calculated Bid or Highest Rated Bid, the bidder shall submit to the BAC its latest income and business tax returns, among others as required by law and stated in the Bidding Documents. Failure to submit any of the post-qualification requirements on time, or a finding against the veracity thereof, shall disqualify the bidder for award x x x.



d)	Delay in the delivery and installation of procured Lot C - firewall device by ePLDT with contract cost of ₱1,141,708.48.



	12)	Paragraph 3.1 of Annex “D” of R.A. No. 9184 and its Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (RIRR) states: When the supplier fails to satisfactorily deliver goods under the contract within specified delivery schedule, inclusive of duly granted time extensions, if any, the supplier shall be liable for damages for the delay and shall pay the procuring entity liquidated damages, not by way of penalty, an amount equal to one-tenth (1/10) of one percent (1%) of the cost of the delayed goods scheduled for delivery for every day of delay until such goods are finally delivered and accepted by the procuring entity concerned.



	13)	The provision for liquidated damages was likewise provided under Clause 19 of the General Conditions of Contract and further provides that the Procuring Entity shall, without prejudice to its other remedies under this Contract and under the applicable law, deduct from the Contract Price, as liquidated damages, the applicable rate of one tenth (1/10) of one (1) percent of the cost of the unperformed portion for every day of delay until actual delivery or performance. The maximum deduction shall be ten percent (10%) of the amount of contract. Once the maximum is reached, the Procuring Entity may rescind or terminate the Contract pursuant to GCC Clause 23, without prejudice to other courses of action and remedies open to it. (Emphasis added.)



	14)	Our auditorial review and evaluation for the completion of the ongoing project Lot C - Firewall Device with contract amount of ₱1,141,708.48 revealed that it was already delayed by 169 days as of October 8, 2020, inclusive of two duly granted time extensions as shown in Appendix F.



	15)	It was learned from an IT personnel that the installation of firewall device is still ongoing. The hardware needed for the installation arrived only on June 15, 2020, almost two months delayed from the extended delivery schedule of April 22, 2020. Further delay in the installation of firewall device was due to slow internet connection of the Academy. It was also noted that the supplier’s personnel in charge of the installation is located in India.



	16)	We further observed inconsistencies in the terms of delivery per Invitation to Bid (60 days), PhilGEPS posting (45 days), Instructions to Bidders (45 calendar days from receipt of NTP), and eventually ePLDT’s Schedule of Delivery (60 calendar days from receipt of NTP). Per inquiry, there was no supplemental bid bulletin issued and posted pursuant to the posting requirement embodied in Section 22.5.3, supra; thus, the delivery term per PhilGEPS posting was followed in the initial computation of liquidated damages.



e)	Non-compliance with the prescribed timelines in the preparation and issuance of Contract Agreement and Notice to Proceed (NTP) for Lot C-Firewall Device with contract cost of ₱1,141,708.48. 



	17)	Verification showed that the contract entered into by the Academy with ePLDT was only approved on December 27, 2019 while the Notice to Proceed (NTP) was belatedly issued on January 23, 2020. The contract was approved beyond the prescribed period of ten calendar days from receipt by the winning bidder of the Notice of Award on December 10, 2019. Meanwhile, the issuance of NTP was delayed by 20 c.d. which exceeded the prescribed period of seven c.d. upon approval of the contract.  These practices are contrary to Section 37.2.1-2 and 37.4.1, supra, in that order.



	18)	The foregoing observations showed that pertinent provisions of R.A. No. 9184 and its 2016 RIRR in all stages of the bidding were not strictly adhered to by the Management; thus, the Academy was not assured of a fair, competitive, and efficient execution of the awarded contract. 



	19)	We recommended and the Superintendent agreed to instruct the Accountant, the BAC, TWG, and BAC Secretariat to:



a)	Ensure that the Statement of all Ongoing Government and Private Contracts and Statement of the Bidder’s SLCC include all pertinent information required under Item 12.1 (a.ii) of the Instructions to Bidders (ITB) and are duly signed by the representative of the winning bidder;



b)	Make sure that the latest Income and Business Tax Returns, among other licenses and permits as required by law and stated in the Bidding Documents, are submitted by the winning bidder within five calendar days from receipt of the notice from the BAC, before the latter is declared as the LCRB or Highest Rated Bid, as the case may be; and



c)	See to it that the Bid Price per Bid Form and accompanying detailed price schedule are meticulously evaluated and calculated in accordance with the IRR of R.A. No. 9184;



d)	Strengthen internal control procedures and make sure that all stages of the bidding, including evaluation and post-evaluation of bids, are in strict adherence to the rules and regulations of the Procurement Law;



e)	Ensure that liquidated damages are imposed or collected against ePLDT Inc. due to the delay in the installation of firewall device from April 22, 2020, reckoned from the last day of the approved extension letter up to the date of final acceptance; 



f)	Ensure that prescribed timelines provided under Section 37 of R.A. No. 9184 in the contract signing and issuance of Notice to Proceed (NTP) are strictly observed by the Academy; and



g)	Submit the lacking documents enumerated in Appendix G to enable the Audit Team to make a decision in audit.





Irregular payment of Representation Allowance and Transportation Allowance (RATA) – ₱472,000.00



5)	The Special Trust Fund (STF) was improperly used to pay out the Representation Allowance and Transportation Allowance (RATA) of Academy officials and designated Officers for a sum of ₱472,000.00 contrary to Section 17 of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 11465. This amount included a total of ₱250,000.00 paid to 12 personnel, during the period August to December 2020, even if the recipients were not entitled to receive said allowances contrary to Section 4 of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1445, Section 54 of the Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 General Appropriations Act (GAA) and other pertinent issuances of the Department of Budget and Management (DBM), thus, rendering the payments irregular per COA Circular 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012.



	1)	Section 17 of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 11465 provides that government funds shall be utilized in accordance with the appropriations authorized for the purpose and comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations xxx.



	2)	Section 4(7) of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1445 also provides that all laws and regulations applicable to financial transactions shall be faithfully adhered to.



	3)	Section 54 of the FY 2020 General Appropriations Act (GAA) enumerates the government officials, with the ranks and their equivalent as determined by the DBM, who are entitled to receive monthly commutable representation and transportation allowances (RATA) at the rates provided therein:



Officials/Employees

Monthly RA or TA

Dept. Secretaries and those of equivalent ranks

₱14,000

Dept. Undersecretaries and those of equivalent ranks

₱11,000

Dept. Asst. Secretaries and those of equivalent ranks

Bureau Directors, Department Regional Directors, and those of equivalent ranks

₱  9,000

Asst. Bureau Directors, Department Assistant Regional Directors, Bureau RDs, Department Service Directors, and those of equivalent ranks

Asst. Bureau Reg’l Directors and those of equivalent ranks   

₱ 7,500

Chiefs of Division identified as such in the Personal Services Itemization and Plantilla of Personnel and those of equivalent ranks

₱ 5,000



	4)	Section 3.0 of the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) National Budget Circular (NBC) No. 548 dated May 15, 2013 provides that RATA is a collective term for two distinct but complementary allowances: Representation Allowance (RA) and Transportation Allowance (TA). Both allowances are provided to select government officials to cover related expenses incidental to and in connection with the actual performance of their respective functions. RATA may either be commutable or reimbursable.



	5)	NBC No. 404 dated March 29, 1989 identifies the SUC officials entitled to RATA and who are considered equivalent to government officials identified in the General Provisions of the GAA, provided that conditions/criteria required are met.



	6)	Consistent with the afore-stated NBC, Section 7.13.2, Chapter 7 of the Manual on Position Classification and Compensation (MPCC) published under the DBM Circular Letter No. 2007-6 dated February 19, 2007 provides the faculty members who are designated as Vice- Presidents/Deans/Directors/Department Heads authorized to receive RATA based on their rank equivalent at the rates provided in the annual GAA, subject to the conditions/criteria provided therewith.



	7)	Moreover, Paragraph 13.0 of DBM NBC No. 548 dated May 15, 2013 instructed the funding source of RATA. The amounts required for the grant of commutable or reimbursable RATA to incumbents or OICs of regular positions and to designated officials in SUCs shall be charged to the respective agency appropriations/budgets for the purpose. In case of deficiencies, the same shall be charged against agency savings. (Emphasis added.)



	8)	Contrary to the aforementioned regulations, various infractions were noted in the grant and payment of RATA, discussed in detail below:



	a)	Insufficient allotment for payment of RATA - ₱472,000.00



	9)	For CY 2020, based on the GAA, the appropriations and allotment for RATA of the Academy amounted to ₱90,000.00 each or a total of ₱180,000.00.



	10)	Records showed, however, that for the year a total of ₱832,000.00 was utilized for the payment of RATA of 17 Academy officials, employees, and designated personnel charged against the Fund 101 (General Fund) and Fund 164 (Income) amounting to ₱180,000.00 and ₱652,000.00, respectively, summarized as follows:

	11)	The budgeted amount of ₱180,000.00 under the GF was fully expended/utilized specifically for the RATA of one of the two Assistant Superintendents.



	12)	The total amount ₱652,000.00 was charged against the Fund 164 (Income), which is the special trust fund maintained from collections of the Graduate School, Training Center, Service Income (Official Transcript of Records (OTR), Certificate of Honorable Dismissal (CHD), Good Moral, Authentication, overdue & Board and Lodging), collections from Commission on Higher Education (CHED) for payment of tuition fees and other school fees, and others.



	13)	Out of the amount of ₱652,000.00, a total of ₱180,000.00 pertained to the RATA of the other Vice-President (VP) or the Assistant Superintendent of the Academy which is allowed under Paragraph 10.0 of the DBM-CHED Joint Circular (JC) No. 2, dated July 28, 2003. On the other hand, the remaining ₱472,000.00 pertained to the RATA of the Superintendent, Acting Chief Administrative Officer, and designated deans/directors/heads of offices pursuant to Paragraph 13.0 of DBM NBC No. 548 which instructs that the funding source of RATA should be charged against the agency savings from the regular fund.



	14)	The Budget Officer explained that the RATA for the Superintendent and Acting Chief Administrative Officer were charged against Fund 164 (Income) because there was no allotment/appropriation received for the purpose in CY 2020. She alleged that the allotment of funds for RATA was based on the filled-up positions of the Personnel Services Itemization and Plantilla of Personnel (PSIPOP). Incidentally, said positions were not yet filled-up at the time the PSIPOP was submitted to the DBM.



	15)	Meanwhile, Board Resolution No. 34 s. 2020 authorized the PMMA Superintendent to grant RATA to PMMA department heads amounting to ₱5,000.00 each chargeable to the Academy’s SUC-wide common fund from income collections for the year. The Resolution explained that PMMA, with agency appropriations/budget released as per GAA for specific purpose/s the payment of RATA of officers other than specified in the GAA, is not authorized though savings from the appropriations has been identified. Also, in that Resolution, it was stated that CMO No. 20 series of 2011, specifically Section 3 and Section 18, respectively, state that “Other Income are collections that cannot be classified under any of the categories or receipts and collections identified. These collections shall be for the use of the administration.” While Section 18 states that the SUC shall provide for a common fund out of which the expenditures considered as SUC wide common administrative costs shall be paid.



	16)	In the immediately preceding paragraph, it is true that the collection and utilization of the Special Trust Fund (STF) are governed by the said CHED Memorandum Order No. 20, series of 2011. In the said Memorandum, the purpose on the use of the fund is specific. As such, the STF can only be utilized for the purpose it was created. Relatedly, the payment of additional compensation to regular employees by way of RATA, is not one of the purposes for its creation.



	17)	On that premise, the grant of RATA to the Superintendent, Acting Chief Administrative Officer, and designated university personnel out of Fund 164 is considered not valid, rendering the disbursements thereof irregular. The Budget Officer and the Chief Accountant who certified the availability of allotment and the availability of funds, respectively, have overlooked the regularity of the utilization of the funds. They could have applied the ruling under DBM NBC No. 548 which clearly provided an option in case of insufficiency of funds in the payment of RATA, which is the use of agency savings from the regular fund. (Emphasis added.)

	

	b)	Payment from STF to 12 Academy officials/employees whose positions are not entitled to RATA -₱250,000.00



	18)	The audit further showed that a total of ₱250,000.00 was disbursed to pay the RATA of 12 officials and employees whose positions are neither among those expressly authorized in the GAA nor considered as equivalent to government officials identified in DBM NBC No. 548 dated May 15, 2013, NBC No. 404 dated March 29, 1989, and Chapter 7 of the MPPC published under DBM Circular Letter No. 2007-6 dated February 19, 2007. (Refer to Appendix H for the details.)



	19)	Per inquiry, the above payment of RATA was founded on the approved Board Resolution No. 34 s. 2020 dated July 22, 2020. Based on the said resolution, the designated department heads were determined by the Academy Management to be of equivalent ranks to those officers specified in the pertinent DBM NBC Nos. 548 and 404, and of Section 7.13.2 of the MPCC. Nevertheless, our verification disclosed that aforesaid designated positions did not meet the standards provided in the pertinent guidelines in terms of the required number of degree programs, full-time faculty members under their supervision, and number of college students, as presented below:



--	Designated deans of colleges and directors with Salary Grade (SG) Levels 18, 19, and 24



Our verification showed that the designated deans of colleges and directors did not meet the minimum requirements as stated in Section 7.13.2 of the Manual on Positions Classification and Compensation. (Refer to Appendix I.)



--	Designated Planning Officer, Quality Management Representative, Financial Management Officer (FMO), and DST Director (SGs 11, 15, and 19)



The above designations are not among the positions entitled to RATA as enumerated under the aforementioned issuances which limit the entitlement thereof to Deans equivalent to Assistant Bureau Regional Director, Directors/Department Heads equivalent to Chiefs of Division, Designated Director of Research Services, Designated Director of Extension Services, Designated Director of Auxiliary Services, Designated Director of each satellite campus/branch/center/institute, duly mandated by law, Designated Director of Student Affairs Services, and Designated Department Heads of different departments/colleges.



--	Designated Graduate School Dean, Training Center Director, and Research & Development Director (SGs 12 and 19)



While the above three designations met the requirements provided in the MPCC, the Academy had no appropriation/budget for the payment of their RATA. Be that as it may, the use of the Fund 164 (Income) to pay their RATA is contrary to the aforementioned Paragraph 13.0 of DBM NBC No. 548 dated May 15, 2013. (Refer to Appendix J.)



	20)	The Audit Team acknowledges the explanation/justification rendered by the designated officials in their reply of February 4, 2021 to our Audit Query.  The following were the responses received; viz:

 

--	RATA was provided to the Deans of the College of Marine Transportation and Marine Engineering due to the high technicality of each individually distinct colleges where the number of faculty and degree programs is an inconsequential prerequisite;



--	The Dean of DMA was allowed to receive RATA even if the PMMA only has around 1,000 students considering that they are required to stay in-house needing 24/7 supervision;



--	The DST Director plays an integral role in the provision of higher education services in the maritime field since this is the sole office in charge of ensuring that the cadets will have an opportunity to undergo shipboard year aside from the required 3-year theoretical classroom instructions;

--	The FMO is the designated Finance Department Head in which she has a total of 23 administrative staff;



--	The QMR is directly responsible for the audit of stakeholders and compliance with     the requirements laid down by CHED, MARINA, and other inspecting/auditing institutions; and



--	 The Planning Officer is responsible for the implementation/monitoring/coordination of school-wide planning matters.



	21)	We cannot discount the volume and technical responsibilities under the shoulder of the abovementioned designated officials considering PMMA’s heavy role not only as a learning institution for merchant marine fleet but more of a training ground for future members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG). 



	22)	Nonetheless, as stated previously, Section 4(7) of P.D. No. 1445 ruled that all laws and regulations applicable to financial transactions shall be faithfully adhered to.



	23)	As such, the grant and payment for RATA shall be anchored on two elements: budget availability and compliance with standards and requirements set by authorized oversight bodies, such as the DBM. Otherwise, the expenditures shall be deemed irregular and, therefore, disallowable in audit, in the purview of COA Circular 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012, which defines irregular expenditures as those incurred without adhering to established rules, regulations, procedural guidelines, policies, principles or practices that have gained recognition in laws. 



	24)	We recommended and the Superintendent agreed to implement the following courses of action:



a)	Desist from charging RATA against the Special Trust Fund (Fund 164/Income). In case of deficiency, the expenditures shall be charged against the agency savings from the regular fund, if there are any; and



b)	Henceforth, strictly and faithfully enforce the promulgated laws, rules and regulations on the utilization of government funds. In the grant of RATA, the agency head is held responsible for the proper implementation of governing rules pursuant to NBC No. 548 dated May 15, 2013.





Unsubmitted Contracts - ₱101,650,345.58



6)	Copies of 22 perfected contracts, together with the documents forming part thereof, with a total consideration of ₱101,650,345.58 were not submitted to the Audit Team contrary to COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009; thus, the Audit Team was precluded from conducting timely review of management’s compliance with the legal and documentary requirements of applicable laws, rules and regulations, and from recommending prompt resolution in cases when the contract covenants  are found disadvantageous to the government.



	1)	Section 3.1.1 of the COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009 provides that Within five (5) working days from the execution of a contract by the government or any of its subdivisions, agencies, or instrumentalities, including government-owned and controlled corporations and their subsidiaries, a copy of said contract and each of all the documents forming part thereof by reference or incorporation shall be furnished to the Auditor of the agency concerned. (Emphasis added.)



	2)	Likewise, Section 37.2.3 of the 2016 Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (RIRR) of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9184, or The government Procurement Reform Act, prescribes the documents that shall form part of the contract which include the following:



a)	Contract Agreement;

b)	Bidding Documents;

c)	Winning bidder’s bid, including the Eligibility requirements, Technical and Financial Proposals, and all other documents/statements submitted;

d)	Performance Security;

e)	Notice of Award of Contract; and

f)	Other contract documents that may be required by existing laws and/or the Procuring Entity concerned in the Bidding Documents, such as the construction schedule and S-curve, manpower schedule, construction methods, equipment utilization schedule, construction safety and health program approved by the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE), and Program Evaluation Review Technique/Critical Path Method (PERT/CPM) or other acceptable tools of project scheduling for infrastructure projects. 



	3)	In the review of the status of the projects implemented under the Capital Outlay (CO) of the General Appropriations Act (GAA) for the Fiscal Years 2019 and 2020, and the status of submission of the related contracts as of December 31, 2020, we noted that the pertinent documents of 22 contracts with an aggregate cost of ₱101,650,345.58 related to various acquisitions of goods, services and infrastructures remained unsubmitted to the Audit Team as of to date. Refer to Appendix K for the details of the contracts and the corresponding deficiencies observed during such review. 



	4)	The failure of management to submit within the prescribed period the contracts together with the complete set supporting documents forming part thereof hampered the Audit Team from performing timely review of the management’s compliance with the requirements of applicable laws, rules and regulations; validation of the completeness of documents; and an initial evaluation that the contractual covenants are not disadvantageous to the government.



	5)	Agency Officials and employees concerned are cautioned under Section 4.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-001 which also provides the PENALTY CLAUSE in case of non- submission of contracts, quoted as follows:



Any unjustified failure of the officials and employees concerned to comply with the requirements herein imposed shall be subject to the administrative disciplinary action provided in (a) Section 127 of Presidential Decree No. 1445; (b) Section 55, Title I-B, Book V of the Revised Administrative Code of 1987; and (c) Section 11 of Republic Act No. 6713.

 

	6)	We recommended and the Superintendent agreed to require the personnel in charge to submit the copies of 22 contracts for procurement activities in CY 2020 and, henceforth, strictly comply with COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009 and the pertinent provision of the RIRR of R.A. No. 9184 requiring the prompt submission of perfected contracts with complete supporting documents  to ensure timely review and verification of the transactions and avoid incurrence of future penalties as stated in the same Circular.





Review of PMMA Mandate vis-à-vis Graduates’ Employability and Performance in Licensure Examinations 



7)	The Academy obtained satisfactory passing rates of 77.84% and 91.85 % in the Marine Engineering and Marine Transportation licensure examinations conducted in calendar years 2018 and 2019, respectively, and secured a high employability percentage of 96.48 for its graduates during the Academic Year (AY) 2018.



	1)	The Philippine Merchant Marine Academy (PMMA) confers the degrees of Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in Marine Transportation or Bachelor of Science (BS) in Marine Engineering to deserving midshipmen. It trains and/or upgrades (a) midshipmen as licensed officers of the Philippine Merchant Marine; (b) merchant marine officers in shipboard or off-shore positions as shipping executives and technical consultants; and (c) student apprentices in various shipboard or shore facilities rank and file billets through the offering of practicum classes. 



	2)	PMMA also (a) prepares and recommends graduates thereof as commissioned officers of the Philippine Navy; (b) offers post-graduate studies in maritime education and shipping business; and (c) conducts research and development projects affecting the education and training of PMMA midshipmen and post-graduate students and in the pursuit of new information and knowledge of value to the maritime industry.



	3)	As already mentioned in the prior year’s Annual Audit Report (AAR), comparison of the mandate with the courses offered by the Academy showed that the two courses/programs and two graduate courses in the Higher Education Services and Advance Education Services, respectively, were within the Academy’s mandate.



	4)	Our assessment on the Academy’s academic performance disclosed the following:



On the Number of Graduates



	5)	Presented in the graph below is the number of graduates for CYs 2018 to 2020. 

	----media/image1.png----





























	6)	As shown, there was a decrease in the number of graduates for the AY 2019 attributable to low number of enrolled student-cadets with the implementation of K to 12 Basic Education Program, as explained by the Acting Head of the Registrar’s Office. 



On Performance in Licensure Examinations

	7)	Using the data provided by the Registrar’s Office, the Audit Team was able to determine the number and percentage of graduates that took and passed the licensure examination for AYs 2018 and 2019, presented in the following table and graph:





	8)	As shown, not all of the graduates took the licensure examination after their graduation. On the average, 76 percent of the graduates for the two academic years took the licensure examinations. The Planning Office and Department of Shipboard Training explained that some of the student-cadets missed taking the licensure examination right after their graduation because they were already hired for employment and needed to board the ship immediately. 



	9)	Further review of the list of passers from the Maritime Industry Authority (MARINA), the agency that conducted the examinations, disclosed that there was an increased percentage of passers from the year 2018 to 2019, as exhibited in the table below. However, the data for CY 2020 licensure examination is not yet available. The Registrar’s Office as well as the Planning Office explained that MARINA has not responded to any of their communication since the start of the pandemic. Effort was exerted to communicate through e-mail and phone calls but MARINA could not be reached.

	10)	The Academy’s outcome indicator in the General Appropriations Act (GAA) for the FY 2020 for the percentage of graduates that are employed is based on the data for graduates in the two prior years.



	11)	In compliance thereto, the Academy surveyed and based on their Accomplishment Report for CY 2020, out of the 227 graduates for the AY 2018, 219 or 96.48% were employed, seven were not tracked while one was unemployed; to wit:

	13)	Meanwhile, for the AYs 2019 to 2020 graduates, the Academy has not monitored/tracked the employment status of their graduates yet, since it was quite difficult to trace the graduate-cadets after their graduation. Nevertheless, the Director of the Department of Shipboard Training asserted that most likely the graduate-cadets will be employed either by the shipping line companies where they had their on-the-job training (OJT) or by the PN and PCG where some student-cadets were scholars.  



	14)	The table below shows the data for possible employment of graduates for AYs 2019-2020 based on their OJT.





Note: No. of Student-Trainees: AY 2019 – 174; AY 2020 - 224



	15)	In summary, the overall performance of the Academy indicated effective use of the government resources invested into its operations since they were able to secure 96.48 percent employment for their AY 2018 graduate-cadets after graduation. Nonetheless, the considerable number of graduates who did not take the licensure examinations after graduation is an aspect to be looked into by the Academy to ensure that 100% of the graduates will take the licensure examination. 



	16)	We recommended and the Superintendent agreed to instruct the Deans of the Colleges to (i) continue to strengthen the delivery of maritime training through its dedicated effort of producing qualified and competent merchant marine officers pursuant to the Academy’s mandate; and (ii) study how the graduates will be substantially prepared to take the licensure examinations after graduation so as to optimize their chances of becoming licensed mariners. 



	17)	We further recommended and the Superintendent agreed that the Heads of the Registrar’s Office and/or Academic Affairs Office be directed to (i) summarize the school statistics into categories that would further enhance and facilitate their usefulness to the users of the information; and (ii) devise a system that would allow the Academy to monitor the employment status of their graduate-cadets, thereby facilitating the collection of inputs needed for the continuous enhancement of the Academic Programs.





Compliance with R.A. No. 8291 or the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) Act



8)	The accuracy of the reported year-end balance totaling to ₱13,591.44 of the Due to GSIS account was uncertain due to (a) unaccounted dormant balances totaling to ₱13,591.44 maintained under the Trust Fund; (b) unadjusted balances of ₱167,594.86 representing amounts withheld under the Income Fund (Special Trust Fund) which were remitted using the General Fund; and (c) unsubstantiated beginning balances aggregating to ₱305,020.28 maintained under the General Fund. Moreover, amounts withheld were not promptly and fully remitted contrary to Section 6.b of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 8291, otherwise known as the “Government Service Insurance System Act of 1997” dated May 30, 1997. Overall, these lapses could possibly result to erroneous remittances of premium contributions, affecting the employees’ benefits and privileges accorded by these GOCCs.



	1)	Review of accounting records revealed inaccuracies in the recording of transactions affecting the reliability of the Due to GSIS account of the Academy as discussed below.



				a)	Non-moving or dormant balance of Due to GSIS account remained unaccounted under the Trust Fund - ₱13,591.44



	2)	Review of the General Ledger (GL) maintained for Due to GSIS account under the Trust Fund showed an ending balance of ₱13,591.44 which was non-moving since January 1, 2015 with no details available to verify the same. 



				b)	Withheld premiums/contributions in the Income Fund (Special Trust Fund) remitted using the General Fund-₱167,594.86



	3)	Analysis of the GL showed that the Due to GSIS account maintained under the Income Fund had year-end balance of ₱167,594.86 which represents contributions/premiums withheld from the salaries of the Assistant Superintendent. However, the same remained outstanding in that Fund since July 2017. Further verification and inquiry with the accounting personnel concerned disclosed that these contributions/premiums were already remitted using the General Fund (GF) instead. No fund transfer was made from the Income Fund to indemnify the GF. 



	c)	Unsubstantiated beginning balance of Due to GSIS account maintained under General Fund - ₱305,020.28



	4)	The Due to GSIS account had an ending balance of ₱537,205.52. We noted, though, that the beginning balance of the account under the General Fund totaling to ₱305,020.28 was unsubstantiated.



	5)	This observation was mentioned already in the previous years’ Annual Audit Reports (AARs); however, the Accounting and Human Resource personnel concerned still failed to exhaust all available remedies to identify the composition and/or details of the beginning balances. As such, the balance of ₱537,205.52 of the Due to GSIS account was deemed unreliable as at year-end.



	d)	Possible under remittance of amounts due to GSIS - ₱52,453.30 



	6)	Accounting records showed the composition of the balance of Due to GSIS account per fund as of December 31, 2020, as follows:

₱11,430,301.92 

₱11,377,848.62 

₱52,453.30 



	8)	As shown in the table above, the Academy withheld a total of ₱11,430,301.92 during the year of which only a sum of ₱11,377,848.62 was remitted as at December 31, 2020, leaving a balance of ₱52,453.30.00. It was glaring that every month, the Academy did not remit the exact amount due the GSIS, resulting in under(over) remittance of premiums/contributions in violation of Section 6.b of R.A. No. 8291, otherwise known as the “Government Service Insurance System Act of 1997” dated May 30, 1997, which states that each employer shall remit directly to the GSIS the employees’ and employers’ contributions within the first ten (10) days of the calendar month following the month to which the contributions apply. The remittance by the employer of the contributions to the GSIS shall take priority over and above the payment of any and all obligations, except salaries and wages of its employees. Partial remittance to the GSIS is questionable and seemingly unfair to the employees considering that the full amounts have already been deducted from their monthly compensation.



	9)	Discrepancies in the amounts withheld and remitted to the GSIS raised questions on the integrity of the reports and records of the Accounting Office. This, in turn, affected the reliability of the account balances reflected in the year-end financial statements.  



	10)	It should also be emphasized that sound internal control system requires adequate checking and monitoring to produce accurate and reliable results of transactions which transpired during the year. It is worth mentioning that the responsibility for the fair presentation of the financial statements rests with the management of the reporting agency.



	11)	We recommended and the Superintendent agreed to instruct the Accountant and Human Resource Head and other personnel involved in the handling of GSIS deductions and remittances to undertake the following courses of action:



a. Return the amount of ₱167,594.86 to the Bureau of Treasury (BT) for the remittance of withheld deductions in the Income Fund (Special Trust Fund) taken out of the General Fund; 



b. Exert more effort to analyze those (i) unaccounted dormant balances of ₱13,591.44 maintained under the Trust Fund; and (ii) unsubstantiated beginning balance of ₱305,020.28 which may represent unremitted premium contributions subject for reconciliation and proper disposition;



c. Exhaust all available remedies to verify and trace the accumulated differences of ₱52,453.30 between the amounts withheld and remitted for CY 2020;



d. Thoroughly check and review the schedules and reports on amounts due to these GOCCs to ensure that amounts withheld are remitted in full to avoid erroneous remittances;   



e)	Observe and implement strictly the provisions of the existing laws and regulations on the prompt remittance of amounts due to the GSIS; 



f)	Conduct a regular review, analysis and reconciliation of these accounts prior to and after the monthly remittance based on the Payroll Deduction and Remittance Reports; and



g)	Cause the necessary adjustments/corrections on the accounting records and/or reports, where appropriate.





Compliance with National Health Insurance Act of 2013



9)	The accuracy of the reported year-end balances of the Due to PhilHealth account was uncertain due to (a) unaccounted dormant balance of ₱1,900.00 maintained under the Trust Fund; (b) unadjusted balance of ₱27,500.00, representing amounts withheld under the Income Fund (Special Trust Fund) which was remitted using the General Fund; and (c) unsubstantiated beginning balance aggregating to ₱21,075.32 maintained under the General Fund. Moreover, amounts withheld were not promptly and fully remitted contrary to Republic Act (R.A.) No. 7875 as amended by R.A. Nos. 9241 and 10606, or The Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (RIRR) of the National Health Insurance Act of 2013. Overall, these lapses could possibly result to erroneous remittances of premium contributions, affecting the employees’ benefits and privileges accorded by this GOCC. 



	1)	Review of accounting records revealed inaccuracies in the recording of transactions affecting the reliability of the Due to PhilHealth account of the Academy as discussed below.



				a)	Non-moving or dormant balances of Due to PhilHealth account remained unaccounted under the Trust Fund - ₱1,900.00



	2)	Review of the General Ledger (GL) maintained for Due to PhilHealth account under the Trust Fund showed an ending balance of ₱1,900.00 which was non-moving since January 1, 2015 with no details available to verify the same. 



				b)	Withheld premiums/contributions in the Income Fund (Special Trust Fund) remitted using the General Fund-₱27,500.00



	3)	Analysis of the GL showed that the Due to PhilHealth account maintained under the Income Fund had year-end balance of ₱27,500.00 which represents contributions/premiums withheld from the contractual employees of the Training Center under the Income Fund (Special Trust Fund). However, the same remained outstanding in that Fund since July 2017. Further verification and inquiry with the accounting personnel concerned disclosed that this amount was already remitted using the General Fund (GF) instead. No fund transfer was made from the Income Fund to indemnify the GF.



				c)	Unsubstantiated beginning balance of Due to PhilHealth account maintained under General Fund - ₱21,075.32



	4)	The Due to PhilHealth account had ending balance of ₱23,604.67. We noted, though, that the beginning balance of the account under the General Fund totaling to ₱21,075.32 was unsubstantiated.

	5)	This observation was mentioned already in the previous years’ Annual Audit Reports (AARs); however, the Accounting and Human Resource personnel concerned still failed to exhaust all available remedies to identify the composition and/or details of the beginning balances. As such, the balance of ₱23,604.67 for the Due to PhilHealth account was deemed unreliable as at year-end.



				d)	Possible over remittance of amounts due to PhilHealth - ₱27,270.65 



	6)	Accounting records showed the composition of the balance of Due to PhilHealth account per fund as of December 31, 2020, as follows:

	9)	In CY 2020, the Academy withheld a total of ₱920,731.51 representing National Health Insurance premium contributions; however, remittances amounted to ₱948,002.16 which were more than the withheld amount by ₱27,270.65. Again, the Academy’s Accounting Office failed to monitor the movements of the Due to PhilHealth account, resulting in under (over) remittances in a particular month. 



	10)	Republic Act (R.A.) No. 7875, as amended by R.A. Nos. 9241 and 10606, and the Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (RIRR) of the National Health Insurance Act of 2013 requires that the member’s monthly contribution shall be deducted and withheld automatically by the employer from the former’s salary, wage or earnings to be remitted by the employer on or before the date prescribed by the Corporation.



	e)	Interests imposed due to late remittance of PhilHealth premiums -₱8,397.26



	11)	Section 11, supra, states that remittance of contribution shall be mandatory to all members. It shall be made to PhilHealth offices or to any of the accredited collecting agents. Failure to timely remit the appropriate premium contribution shall be subject to interest and penalties as prescribed by the Corporation without prejudice to other applicable penalties herein provided. (Emphasis added.)



	12)	The PhilHealth issued an advisory on June 16, 2020 extending the payment deadline; viz:



Employers in the public and private sectors have also been advised that their premium remittances for the applicable months of February, March and April 2020 can be paid until June 22, 2020 without interest, in line with the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act. They may also pay at any LHIOs and ACAs including CIS Bayad Centers and their third-party agents, or through the electronic premium remittance system (EPRS) online.

	14)	As shown above, the Academy had incurred delays in the payment of remittances for the months of March, April, May and July 2020. Likewise, it can be noticed that there were no interests imposed by the PhilHealth for the months of March and April despite delay in payments for at least 15 days, which was consistent with the aforementioned PhilHealth’s Advisory issued on June 16, 2020 that the months of February, March and April 2020 can be paid until June 22, 2020 without interest, in line with the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act.



	15)	On the other hand, in accordance with the said advisory, the late payments for the months of May and July were consequently charged with interests amounting to ₱4,100.63 and ₱4,296.63, respectively, which were inappropriately paid out of the General Fund. The incurrence of penalties could be due to the negligence of the agency personnel/officials concerned in charge of the transactions. Charging the same against government funds is deemed irregular and unnecessary and, therefore, disallowable in audit pursuant to COA Circular 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012. The Circular defines irregular expenditures as those incurred without adhering to established rules, regulations, procedural guidelines, policies, principles or practices that have gained recognition in laws.



	16)	The Academy Accountant appealed that the penalty imposed for the month of May 2020 by the PhilHealth be condoned in a letter dated August 14, 2020 to the CSIO-PhilHealth, Iba, Zambales for the reason that most of our employees residing outside the PMMA premises were placed under quarantine status resulting to late remittance. He averred that such lapses were not intentional on their part and that they were merely forced by the prevailing circumstances of complying with the health protocols since the employees needed to be protected at the same time. Reportedly, that was the first time that they experienced such case of delay in remittances in a span of 20 years since the transfer of the Academy in Zambales from Makati City.



	17)	Meanwhile, the Statement of Premium Account (SPA) for premiums due for the month of July 2020 where the first interest was included in the total billed amount was not paid on time again because as explained, the Accountant was waiting for a positive response from the PhilHealth which gave rise to another penalty or interest.



	18)	However, apparently, the Management did not receive any positive response from the PhilHealth.



	19)	The Audit Team understands the current pandemic situation which caused disruptions to the Academy’s normal operations. Nonetheless, the officials/personnel concerned should have been more cautious with the remittance deadline even in the middle of the pandemic because of the possible penalties for repeated failure to promptly remit the appropriate premium contribution. Moreover, the Management was aware of the period subject to interest, considering the advisory issued by the PhilHealth; thus, other employees available should have been tapped to undertake the work left by the regular personnel in charge. 



	20)	Further audit disclosed that interests paid amounting to ₱8,397.26 were recognized in the books as PhilHealth Contributions (50103030 01), representing an adjustment to the additional remittance of mandatory deductions for employer's share to the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PHIC) for the months of July 2020 and September 2020, the period when the interests were billed to the Academy. There being no basis for the recognition of the transaction, the PhilHealth Contributions was overstated by the same amount. 



	21)	Discrepancies in the amounts withheld and remitted to the PhilHealth raised questions on the integrity of the reports and records of the Accounting Office. This, in turn, affected the reliability of the account balance reflected in the year-end financial statements.  



	22)	It should also be emphasized that sound internal control system requires adequate checking and monitoring to produce accurate and reliable results of transactions which transpired during the year. It is worth mentioning that the responsibility for the fair presentation of the financial statements rests with the management of the reporting agency.



	23)	We recommended and the Superintendent agreed to instruct the Accountant and Human Resource Head and other personnel involved in the handling of PhilHealth deductions and remittances to undertake the following courses of action:



a.  Return the amount of ₱27,500.00 to the Bureau of Treasury (BT) for the remittance of withheld deductions in the Income Fund (Special Trust Fund) taken out of the General Fund; 



b.  Exert more effort to analyze those (i) unaccounted dormant balances of ₱1,900.00 maintained under the Trust Fund; and (ii) unsubstantiated beginning balances for the Due to PhilHealth account in the amount of ₱21,075.32 which represents unremitted premium contributions subject for reconciliation and proper disposition;

  

c)	 Exhaust all available remedies to verify and trace the accumulated differences between the amounts withheld and remitted for CY 2020 in the amount of ₱27,270.65;



d)	 Check and review closely the schedules and reports on amounts due to these GOCCs to ensure that amounts withheld are remitted in full to avoid erroneous remittances;  

 

e)	 Observe and implement strictly the provisions of the existing laws and  regulations on the prompt remittance of amounts due to the PhilHealth; 



e)	Conduct a regular review, analysis and reconciliation of the account prior to and after the monthly remittance based on the Payroll Deduction and Remittance Reports; and



f)	Cause the necessary adjustments/corrections on the accounting records and/or reports, where appropriate.  



	24)	We likewise recommended and, together with other officials concerned, the Superintendent agreed to (i) cause the return of the total amount of ₱8,397.26 improperly charged against the General Fund to the Bureau of Treasury; and (ii) install/implement a scheme that will ensure timely remittance of premiums/contributions not only to the PhilHealth but also to other GOCCs during the time of pandemic and/or other fortuitous events. Likewise, we recommended that the Superintendent instruct the Accountant to draw the necessary adjusting journal entry to present correctly the total expenses for PhilHealth Contributions in CY 2020.





Compliance with Home Development Mutual Fund (HDMF) Law



10)	The accuracy of the reported year-end balance of the Due to Pag-IBIG account was uncertain due to (a) unaccounted dormant balances of ₱12,500.00 maintained under the Trust Fund; (b) unadjusted balance of ₱8,100.00 representing amounts withheld under the Income Fund (Special Trust Fund) which were remitted using the General Fund; and (c) unsubstantiated/abnormal beginning balance of ₱858.53 maintained under the General Fund. Moreover, amounts withheld were not promptly and fully remitted contrary to Item E (5) of the Home Development Mutual Fund (HDMF)/Pag-IBIG Circular No. 274 dated January 7, 2010. Overall, these lapses could possibly result to erroneous remittances of premium contributions, affecting the employees’ benefits and privileges accorded by this GOCC.



	1)	Review of accounting records revealed inaccuracies in the recording of transactions affecting the reliability of the Due to Pag-IBIG account of the Academy as discussed below.



				a)	Non-moving or dormant balance of Due to Pag-IBIG account remained unaccounted under the Trust Fund - ₱12,500.00



	2)	Review of the General Ledger (GL) maintained for Due to Pag-IBIG account under the Trust Fund showed an ending balance of ₱12,500.00 which was non-moving since January 1, 2015 with no details available to verify the same. 



				b)	Withheld premiums/contributions in the Income Fund (Special Trust Fund) remitted using the General Fund-₱8,100.00



	3)	Analysis of the GL showed that the Due to Pag-IBIG account maintained under the Income Fund had year-end balance of ₱8,100.00 which represents contributions/premiums withheld from the salaries of the contractual employees of the Training Center under the Income Fund (Special Trust Fund). However, the same remained outstanding in that Fund since July 2017. Further verification and inquiry with the accounting personnel concerned disclosed that the amount was already remitted using the General Fund (GF) instead. No fund transfer was made from the Income Fund to indemnify the GF. 





				c)	Unsubstantiated/abnormal beginning balance of Due to Pag-IBIG account maintained under General Fund - (₱858.53)



	4)	The Due to Pag-IBIG account had an ending balance of ₱114,873.42. We noted, though, that the account had an abnormal beginning balance under the General Fund of ₱858.53 which was unsubstantiated.



	5)	This observation was mentioned already in the previous years’ Annual Audit Reports (AARs); however, the Accounting and Human Resource personnel concerned still failed to exhaust all available remedies to identify the composition and/or details of the beginning balances. 



				d)	Possible under remittance of amounts due to Pag-IBIG - ₱95,131.95



	6)	Accounting records showed the composition of the balance of Due to Pag-IBIG account per fund as of December 31, 2020, as follows: 



Fund

 Due to Pag-IBIG

General Fund (GF)

₱94,273.42

Trust Fund (TF)

12,500.00

Income

8,100.00

Total

₱114,873.42



	7)	We analyzed the amounts withheld vis-a-vis the corresponding remittances for the three accounts, and arrived at the following discrepancies at the end of each month:



	8)	Item E(5) of the Home Development Mutual Fund (HDMF)/Pag-IBIG Circular No. 274 dated January 7, 2010 provides that all employers and trade associations/cooperatives with existing agreement with the Fund shall remit the required monthly employer and employee contributions to the Fund or its authorized collecting banks in accordance with the following schedule:

	10)	Evidently, based on the table above, Pag-IBIG premiums and loan amortizations were not remitted in full, resulting in unremitted balance of ₱95,131.95. 



	11)	Discrepancies in the amounts withheld and remitted to the Pag-IBIG raised questions on the integrity of the reports and records of the Accounting Office. This, in turn, affected the reliability of the account balances reflected in the year-end financial statements.  



	12)	It should also be emphasized that sound internal control system requires adequate checking and monitoring to produce accurate and reliable results of transactions which transpired during the year. It is worth mentioning that the responsibility for the fair presentation of the financial statements rests with the management of the reporting agency.



	13)	We recommended and the Superintendent agreed to instruct the Accountant and Human Resource Head and other personnel involved in the handling of Pag-IBIG deductions and remittances to undertake the following courses of action:



a)	Return the amount of ₱8,100.00 to the Bureau of Treasury (BT) for the remittance of withheld deductions in the Income Fund (Special Trust Fund) taken out of the General Fund; 



b)	Exert more effort to analyze those (i) unaccounted dormant balances of ₱12,500.00 maintained under the Trust Fund; and (ii) unsubstantiated beginning balance of (₱858.53) under the General Fund which may represent over remittance of premium contributions subject for reconciliation and proper disposition;



c)	Exhaust all available remedies to verify and trace the accumulated differences between the amounts withheld and remitted for CY 2020 in the amount of ₱95,131.95;



d)	Check and review closely the schedules and reports on amounts due to this GOCC to ensure that amounts withheld are remitted in full to avoid erroneous remittances;   



e)	Observe and implement strictly the provisions of the existing laws and regulations on the prompt remittance of amounts due to the Pag-IBIG;



f)	Conduct a regular review, analysis and reconciliation of these accounts prior to and after the monthly remittance based on the Payroll Deduction and Remittance Reports; and



g)	Cause the necessary adjustments/corrections on the accounting records and/or reports, where appropriate.





Compliance with Gender and Development (GAD)



11)	The Academy failed to institutionalize Gender and Development (GAD) processes and mechanisms such as the utilization of the Harmonized Gender and Development Guidelines (HGDG) tools in the preparation of GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) and GAD Accomplishment Report (GAD AR);  thus, a systematic budget allocation and reporting was not assured which resulted in low GAD accomplishment rate of 2.56 percent, inconsistent with Section 31 of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 11465, the General Provisions of the General Appropriations Act (GAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2020, and Paragraph 3.4 and Annex A of the Philippine Commission on Women-National Economic and Development Authority- Department of Budget and Management (PCW-NEDA-DBM) Joint Circular No. 2012-01.



	1)	Section 32 of the Republic Act (R.A.) No. 11260, General Provisions of the General Appropriations Act (GAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2019, as reiterated in the Philippine Commission on Women -National Economic and Development Authority-Department of Budget and Management (PCW-NEDA-DBM) Joint Circular (JC) No. 2012-01, states that the Gender and Development (GAD) Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of the agencies, which shall correspond to at least five percent of their budgets.



	2)	Our review of the Annual GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) for FY 2020 as reviewed/endorsed by the PCW showed that Management appropriated a total of ₱15,291,512.69 for GAD activities comprising 5.74% of the Annual Budget of the Academy under FY 2020 GAA of ₱266,182,000.00, categorized as follows:



GAD Activity

Various activities

2,625,760.70

17.17%

Total

₱15,291,512.69

100%



	3)	Despite the prior year’s recommendation of the Audit Team, the current audit showed that the Academy failed anew to comply fully with the GAD mandate pursuant to Executive Order (EO) No. 273 (Approving and Adopting the Philippine Plan for Gender-Responsive Development [PPGD  1995-2025]). The following deficiencies were noted:



							a)	The HGDG tools not fully utilized in the preparation of GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) and GAD Accomplishment Report (GAR)



	4)	Paragraph 3.4, of the PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01 partly states that to aid gender mainstreaming, agencies shall perform gender analysis using existing tools, such as the Harmonized Gender and Development Guidelines (HGDG), to ensure that the different concerns of women and men are addressed equally and equitably in their PAPs. Activities to address these differential concerns through capacity development on GAD or GAD-focused activities shall be included in agency GPBs.



	5)	Comparison of the Annual GPB and the Accomplishment Report (not yet officially endorsed) showed GAD activities for the Major Final Output (MFO) - Higher Education Program and General Administration and Support. Nevertheless, for the rest of the PAPs under the Support to Operations, Operations, Advanced Education Program, and Research Program, there were no identified linkages to GAD which lost harmony with the provisions cited in Annex A of the aforementioned PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular. 



	6)	Interview with the former GAD Focal Person (GFP) disclosed that the Harmonized Gender and Development Guidelines (HGDG) tool was used only to attribute projects under the Capital Outlay budget for FY 2020 of ₱67,598,000.00, which all fell under the Higher Education Program where a total of ₱6,335,000.00 or 41.43% of the GPB was attributed.



	7)	Similarly, the reported accomplishments did not show indications of systematic allocation of the cost of various activities of the Academy that were GAD-related, hence, inconsistent with the said Joint Circular. 



	8)	Relatedly, comparison of the GAD budget for trainings/seminars of ₱6,330,751.99 against the Academy’s overall budget for training and scholarship expenses as per FY 2020 GAA of ₱2,155,000.00 showed a budget deficit of ₱4,175,751.99. Understandably, the Academy would not be able to meet its target for the training program under the given circumstance of a tight budget. 



	9)	Moreover, we noted that a GAD Activity with a budget of ₱343,000.00, specifically the “Serbisyo ni Juana- Beauty Care (Juana be Beautiful?)” with performance indicator of 100 women employees and 50 female cadettes was not really gender-responsive. The activity involved the provision of Beauty Care to increase confidence among women employees and cadets which we found as contrary to the provisions in Annex A, supra, prohibiting the use of GAD fund for expenses related to social, rest and recreation activities. As to responsiveness, this activity did not clearly address the gender issue identified in the Plan which was Limited understanding and support to GAD among the PMMA personnel with GAD Objective of to establish a broad base of support for GAD across the agency. 



							b)	Utilization of GAD budget not optimized.



	10)	Comparison of the CY 2020 GAD budget of ₱15,291,512.69 vis-a-vis the GAD AR showed that actual GAD expenses amounted to ₱391,927.20 only for seven out of the 21 GAD activities or 2.56 percent of the GAD budget.



	11)	Out of the seven GAD activities focused on the MFO - Higher Education, only one activity was accomplished. The reason cited for this was due to COVID-19 pandemic, so the training for the cadets and cadettes was postponed and rescheduled for the year 2021 thru online platform.



	12)	Under the General Administration and Support Services (GASS), only six out of the 13 activities were accomplished. The reason for partial accomplishment was likewise due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As such, the remaining planned activities were postponed and rescheduled for the year 2021.



	13)	Lastly, the amount of ₱6,335,000.00, which constitutes 41.43% of the total GPB for CY 2020, was attributed to the renovation of various offices such as the dormitory and guard house which were likewise not accomplished during the year. The related Notices to Proceed (NTP) for the related projects were received by the contractor on December 29, 2020 only.



	14)	The detailed schedule of the Programs/Activities/Projects (PAPs) under the GPB and the corresponding status of accomplishments and costs incurred are presented in Appendices L to N. 



	15)	It is an accepted fact that the pandemic caused disturbances in the smooth implementation of the regular programs of the Academy for GAD. Notwithstanding, the agency officials could have at least adopted measures to institutionalize the required GAD mechanisms and tools that will ensure the attainment of gender responsiveness in all PAPs pursued during the year.   



	16)	We recommended and the Superintendent agreed to instruct the GAD Focal Person, Committee on GAD Planning, Budgeting and Implementation, and the Budget Officer to (a) prepare a  GAD Plan and Budget with proper attribution of costs for GAD-related activities by applying the HGDG tool for a more reliable/comprehensive inputs or bases in GAD planning and reporting; and (b) consider the regular programs, activities and projects of the Academy, which are considered GAD responsive, in the formulation of the Academy’s planning framework for GAD in order to rationalize the use of the budget and optimize the realization of the GAD mandate.





Compliance with Tax Laws



12)	The accuracy of the reported year-end balance of the Due to BIR account of ₱5,633,525.10 was uncertain due to (a) unaccounted non-moving or dormant balance of ₱270,095.50; and (b) unsubstantiated beginning balance of ₱2,677,330.88. Moreover, unremitted taxes amounted to ₱928,276.31 in calendar year 2020 contrary to Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 2-98 issued on May 17, 1998, as amended by RR No. 11-2018 dated March 15, 2018, thus, exposing government funds to possible misapplication and may subject the Academy of probable imposition of penalty from the BIR.



	1)	Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 2-98 issued on May 17, 1998, as amended by RR No. 11-2018 dated March 15, 2018, prescribes the regulations relative to withholding and remittance of taxes on income subject to Expanded Withholding Tax and Final Withholding Tax, Withholding of Income Tax on Compensation, Withholding of Creditable Value-Added Tax and Other Percentage Taxes and its remittance to the BIR.



	2)	As of year-end, the balance of the account Due to BIR amounted to ₱5,633,525.10.



	3)	Review of accounting records as of December 31, 2020 revealed that transactions affecting the Due to BIR account of the Academy for the four funds, General Fund (GF)-Regular, General Fund (GF)-Capital Outlay, Income and Trust Funds were inaccurately recorded as discussed below.

				a)	Unaccounted non-moving or dormant balance of Due to BIR account under General Fund (GF)-Capital Outlay - ₱270,095.50



	4)	Review of the GL showed that under the General Fund (GF)-Capital Outlay, Due to BIR account has an ending balance of ₱270,095.50 which has been non-moving since January 1, 2015 with no details available to verify the same. 



				b)	Unsubstantiated beginning balances under General Fund (GF)-Regular, Income and Trust Funds - ₱2,677,330.88



	5)	The Due to BIR account has an ending balance of ₱5,554,562.25. Analysis of the year-end balance showed that 48% or ₱2,677,330.88 represents unsubstantiated amount under General Fund (GF)-Regular, Income and Trust Funds; to wit:

	6)	It could be recalled that the unsubstantiated balances from previous years were already brought to Management’s attention for appropriate action in the prior year’s report. These represent unidentified amounts withheld but were not remitted to the BIR, casting doubts on the Academy’s full compliance with BIR RR No. 2-98 issued on May 17, 1998, as amended by RR No. 11-2018 dated March 15, 2018, and indicative of lapses in the withholding, recording and remittance of the same. Apparently, the Accountant still failed to exhaust all available remedies to identify/account these balances.



				c)	Under remittance of taxes withheld under the General Fund (GF)-Regular, Income and Trust Funds during the year 2020 - ₱928,276.31



	7)	Further review of records and analysis showed that for CY 2020, the Academy withheld taxes due from its employees and creditable value added taxes, expanded withholding taxes and other percentage taxes from its contractors/suppliers under the GF, Income, and TF; and remitted the same to the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR). However, the SLs disclosed that there were huge variances between the monthly reported taxes withheld and the monthly remittances as presented below.

	8)	As shown in the above table, the amount withheld during the month was not equal to the amount remitted casting doubt on the correctness of the actual remittances. 



	9)	The table also clearly shows that the taxes withheld by the Academy were not fully and promptly remitted to the BIR contrary to BIR Regulation No. 2-98, as amended, which requires that monthly remittance of withholding taxes shall be made on the following dates or deadlines:



1)	For withholding taxes on compensation – on or before the tenth (10th) day of the following month the withholding tax was made, except for the taxes withheld for the month of December which shall be filed on or before January 15 of the succeeding year.



2)	For expanded withholding taxes – on or before the tenth (10th) day of the following month the withholding tax was made, except for the taxes withheld for the month of December which shall be filed on or before January 15 of the succeeding year.



	10)	We also noted that on some occasions, the remittances were more than the amounts withheld and recognized in the books. This could be attributed to the failure of the Accounting Office to regularly review, analyze and reconcile the Due to BIR account prior to and after remittance with the Tax Remittance Advice and Tax Remittance Reports.

	11)	The foregoing practice may expose government funds to possible misapplication and may subject the Academy to possible imposition of penalty from the BIR.



	12)	Relatively, penalties and surcharges may be imposed by the BIR to the Academy personnel in-charge of the withholding of taxes for failure or causing the failure to remit the taxes deducted and withheld within the time prescribed by law as specified in Section 272 of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC).



	13)	The Management is reminded that the BIR issued Revenue Memorandum Order No. 8-2003 dated March 3, 2003 naming the Heads of Offices (officials holding the highest position) and Chief Accountants or other persons holding similar positions in departments, bureaus, agencies and instrumentalities officially designated as such by the head of office who shall be personally charged with the duty to correctly withhold taxes on compensation, expanded and final withholding tax as well as government money payments to persons registered as Non-VAT (percentage, franchise, etc.) and VAT taxpayers and the timely remittance of taxes withheld.



	14)	In view of the continual failure of the Accounting Office to act on the dormant amount and unsubstantiated beginning balances of ₱270,095.50 and ₱2,677,330.88, respectively, the accuracy of the Due to BIR account reported in the Financial Statements was uncertain.



	15)	We reiterated our prior years’ audit recommendations and the Superintendent agreed to instruct the Accountant to:



a)	Cause the timely and full remittance of the taxes withheld to the BIR in compliance with BIR Regulations No. 2-98, as amended;



b)	Exert effort to verify and substantiate the dormant amount and unaccounted beginning balances of ₱270,095.50 and ₱2,677,330.88, respectively, and cause necessary adjustments/action thereon, if warranted, to reflect the correct balance of the Due to BIR account;



c)	Ensure proper recording of taxes withheld from employees and suppliers and the corresponding remittances to the BIR to arrive at the right balance in any given period; and



d)	Conduct a regular review, analysis and reconciliation of the Due to BIR account prior to and after the monthly remittance vis-a-vis the Tax Remittance Advice and Tax Remittance Reports; and prepare the necessary adjusting entries to correct the discrepancy, if any.











Enforcement of Suspensions, Disallowances, and Charges 



Status of audit suspensions and disallowances  



13)	As of December 31, 2020, audit suspensions stood at ₱43,495,000.00. There were no unsettled disallowances and charges as of year-end.



	1)	The outstanding amount of ₱43,495,000.00 in the Statement of Audit Disallowances, Suspensions and Charges (SASDC) as of December 31, 2020 pertains to unsettled Notice of Suspension (NS) issued by the Audit Team in October 2020 due to the payment of the Full Mission Bridge, five Mini Bridges Simulator and Full Mission Engine Room Simulator despite inadequacy of supporting documents and incomplete delivery, among other deficiencies.



	2)	We recommended and the Superintendent agreed to exercise prudence and perform diligent review of significant transactions before processing payments to avoid audit suspensions.
