EXECUTIVE  SUMMARY





A)	INTRODUCTION



		The Philippine Merchant Marine Academy (PMMA) was established on April 5, 1820 by virtue of a Spanish Royal Decree, as the Escuela Nautica de Manila. In 1899, it was changed to Nautical School of the Philippine Islands. One year thereafter, it was renamed Philippine Nautical School and since 1963 up to the present, the school was popularly known as the Philippine Merchant Marine Academy.



	The PMMA envisions, through its academic program and quasi-military training, to produce a balanced personality out of every graduate, i.e., an internationally acceptable officer and gentleman who can function efficiently in their field of endeavor and contribute to the development and progress of the Filipino nation. To achieve this vision, the Academy educates and trains midshipmen/women to become qualified and competent merchant marine officers for shipboard and shore-based positions, in response to the global requirements of the expanding international maritime industry, as well as to become competent and capable naval officers who can serve as naval and military auxiliaries in times of war and national emergencies and to  contribute to the improvement of maritime education and the pool of ship business managers through graduate school programs.



	The policy-making body of the Academy is the Board of Trustees composed of 11 members, as follows:



Chairperson            - Chairperson, Commission on Higher Education

Vice-Chairperson   - Superintendent, Philippine Merchant Marine Academy

Members                 - Chairman, Senate Committee on Higher Education	

		        - Chairman, Committee on Technical Education (Congress)

		        - Regional Director, NEDA Region III

		        - Flag-Officer-in-Command, Philippine Navy

		        - President, PMMA Student Trustee

		        - National Prominent Citizen

     		        - Local Prominent Citizen



	The management and administration of the Academy is vested in the Superintendent and is assisted by two designated Assistant Superintendents, one for Administration and Finance and another for Academic, Research, Training and Extension. 



For the year 2020, the Academy had a total personnel complement of 269, of which 156 are permanent employees composed of 30 teaching and 126 non-teaching employees.

	As discussed in Part II of this Report, the following audit observations affected the fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements: (a) doubtful accuracy of the Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) accounts due to (i) unreconciled variance of ₱20,660,470.78 between the PPE book balances and the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE); (ii) inaccurate provision of depreciation for 617 PPE items with net book value of ₱363,315,457.82 or 43.66% of the total PPE; (iii) failure to de-recognize sold/donated motor vehicles amounting to  ₱891,369.09; and (iv) various assets amounting to ₱241,965,986.15 not reclassified to proper PPE accounts; and (b) unreconciled difference of ₱12,961,164.46 between the Report of Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) and the General Ledger (GL) balances of the Inventories accounts.



In view of the foregoing, we recommended that the Superintendent undertake the following courses of action:



--	On Property, Plant and Equipment Accounts



a)	Instruct the Accountant and the Property Officer to reconcile their records based on the results of the actual physical inventory and effect the necessary adjustments;

b)	direct the officials concerned to follow up the titling of land occupied by the Academy and the valuation of all donated property items for proper recognition in the books of accounts; and

c)	instruct the Accountant to (i) review the details of the 617 PPE items reflected in the computerized PPE Schedule with noted errors/inconsistencies on the information relative to their acquisition costs and useful lives, and effect the necessary corrections and adjustments therefor; (ii) draw the necessary Journal Entry Voucher (JEV) to derecognize in the books the net book value of the two vehicles disposed thru donation in the amount of ₱891,369.09; and (iii) analyze the composition of Other PPE account totaling to ₱241,965,986.15; reclassify them to the appropriate PPE categories; and provide for the respective depreciation expenses.



--	On Inventories Accounts



d)	Instruct the Accountant and concerned accounting personnel together with personnel in charge of the Supply, Mess, and Medical Sections to (i) verify the cause of the variance amounting to ₱12,563,566.22 and draw the necessary journal entries to adjust the same, if warranted; and (ii) conduct periodic reconciliation of their respective records for the Inventories accounts to avoid discrepancies and subsequent losses of agency assets as provided in the GAM.

We recommended and the Superintendent agreed, together with the key officials of the Academy, to: (i) carefully assess the programs/projects identified by partner government agencies to ensure their relevance to the objectives and training needs of the Academy;  avoid premature revisions; and possible incurrence of delay during the project execution phase; (ii) conduct an in-depth evaluation of the viable programs related to maritime training and education to make them sustainable;  and (iii) make sure that the timeline set with partner government agencies for every project is realistic and strictly followed since the timing of execution determines the success of a project. We also recommended and the Superintendent agreed to require the Accountant to (i) prepare the necessary adjustment to correct the overstatement of the Inter-Agency Payables (Due to NGAs) of ₱11,253,282.05 stated above; and (ii) submit the required liquidation reports and the documents enumerated to enable us to render a decision in audit. Likewise, we recommended and the Superintendent agreed to submit the documents enumerated in Appendix D to enable the Audit Team to render a decision in audit.



			2)	Due to to non-conduct of Early Procurement Activities (EPA) and deficient procurement planning, two major projects such as Acquisition of Various Equipment and IT software and Renovation/Extension of Various Buildings aggregating to ₱39,100,922.93 were not implemented/completed in CY 2020 as planned, contrary to Section 19 of Republic Act (R.A.)

No. 9184, thus, depriving the students and employees of the immediate use of upgraded and modernized facilities. (Observation No. 6)



We recommended and the Superintendent agreed that together with other approving officials of the Academy, to ensure that PPMPs and APP are completely and properly accomplished, and supported with well-studied and well-planned time schedule for each procurement activity; and (b) formulate plans that are adequate and time-bound to avoid unnecessary delay in the procurement process and implementation of the Agency’s PPAs.

No. 9184 and its 2016 Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (RIRR); thus, the Academy was not assured of a fair, competitive and efficient implementation of awarded contracts. (Observation No. 7)



We recommended and the Superintendent agreed to instruct the Accountant, the BAC, TWG, and BAC Secretariat to (a) see to it that the Bid Price per Bid Form and accompanying detailed price schedule are meticulously evaluated and calculated in accordance with the IRR of R.A.

			4)	The Special Trust Fund (STF) was improperly used to pay out the Representation Allowance and Transportation Allowance (RATA) of Academy officials and designated Officers for a sum of ₱472,000.00 contrary to Section 17 of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 11465. This amount included a total of ₱250,000.00 paid to 12 personnel, during the period August to December 2020, even if the recipients were not entitled to receive said allowances contrary to Section 4 of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1445, Section 54 of the Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 General Appropriations Act (GAA) and other pertinent issuances of the Department of Budget and Management (DBM), thus, rendering the payments irregular per COA Circular 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012.

(Observation No. 9)



	We recommended and the Superintendent agreed to require the personnel in charge to submit the copies of 22 contracts for procurement activities in CY 2020 and, henceforth, strictly comply with COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009 and the pertinent provision of the RIRR of R.A.
