EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

 

A. Introduction 
 

The Department of Energy (DOE) is the executive department of the Philippine 

Government mandated to prepare, integrate, coordinate, supervise and control all plans, 

programs, projects, and activities of the Government relative to energy exploration, 

development, utilization, distribution and conservation. 

 

Under Presidential Decree No. 1206 dated October 6, 1977, the Ministry of Energy 

was created to formulate and implement the government's policies, plans and programs on 

energy resources development. The Ministry was abolished and was downgraded to Office of 

Energy Affairs during the Regime of President Corazon Aquino. On December 9, 1992, 

Republic Act (RA) No. 7638 or the DOE Act of 1992 was enacted, which created the DOE, 

rationalizing the organization and functions of government agencies related to energy and for 

other purposes. The Department was also vested additional powers and functions to implement 

pertinent energy and power related legislations such as Section 37 of RA No. 9136 or the 

Electric Power Industry Reform Act (EPIRA) of 2001, RA No. 9513 (An Act Promoting the 

Development, Utilization and Commercialization of Renewable Energy Resources and for 

Other Purposes), and RA No. 9367 or "Biofuels Act of 2006". 

 

DOE is headed by Secretary Alfonso G. Cusi who has direct supervision and control 

of the overall functions and activities of the Department and assisted by six Undersecretaries 

and five Assistant Secretaries.  

 

As of December 31, 2020, the Department reported a total manpower complement of 

988, of which, 950 are holding plantilla positions while 38 are on job order basis. The 950 

filled-up plantilla positions consists of 906 permanent/regular positions while 44 are on co-

terminus with the incumbent positions.

D. Scope of Audit 
 

The audit covered the financial transactions and operations of DOE for CY 2020. The 

audit was conducted to: (a) verify the level of assurance that may be placed on Management’s 

assertions on the financial statements; (b) determine the propriety of transactions as well as the 

extent of compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations; (c) recommend agency 

improvement opportunities; and (d) determine the extent of implementation of prior years’ 

audit recommendations. 

 

 

E. Independent Auditor’s Report 
 

The Auditor rendered an unmodified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the 

financial statements of DOE as at December 31, 2020.  

 

 

F. Summary of Significant Observations and Recommendations 
 

 The significant audit observations and recommendations which are discussed in details 

in Part II of this Report, are as follows: 

 

1. There were total misstatements of P37,199,029.29 due to the following accounting 
errors and improper accounting treatment of  transactions that are considered departure 

from the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSASs) affecting some of 

DOE’s financial accounts, but considered not material enough to affect the fair 

presentation of the financial statements as at year-end of the DOE: (Observation No. 

1) 
 

a. Unrecorded various PPE items in the books of accounts and in the Report on the 
Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) in the amount of  

P34,910,805.05; 

 

b. Error in recording refund of unutilized/excess fund transfer of P562,594.51; and 
 

c. Erroneous treatment in recording of remittance of taxes withheld amounting to 
P1,725,629.73.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accounting Division to:  

 

a. immediately prepare the necessary journal entry voucher to take up in the books 
the delivered PPE items amounting to P34,910,805.05, and the General Service 

Division (GSD) to conduct final inspection and include the said items of PPE in 

CY 2020 RPCPPE considering their year of acquisition; 

 

b. make the necessary journal entry to correct the error in the accounts affected, 
including the posting in the related Subsidiary Ledgers; and 



vii 

 

 

c. make the necessary journal entry to correct the error in accounting treatment, and; 
henceforth, strengthen the review process in preparing journal entries to ensure 

that all transactions are properly recorded in the books of accounts. 

 

2. Accounting deficiencies affecting some accounts to the extent of P662,130,324.26          
due to the inability of agency officials concerned to implement the controls required 

under existing regulations in the reconciliation and validation of account balances were 

noted. Based on the possible/potential effects of these deficiencies, the reported 

balances of the affected accounts could not be relied upon: (Observation   No. 2) 

 

a. Unreconciled difference in the book and bank records, and non-transfer of 
Training Commitment Fund (TCF) from Fund 101 (Trust Fund) to Fund 151 

affecting the Cash account for P105,973,618.38 and P279,848,114.27, 

respectively 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accounting Division to 

conduct reconciliation of the book and bank records pertaining to the Training 

Commitment Fund in Cash in Bank – Local Currency, Current Account and 

prepare necessary journal entries, and the Treasury Division to transfer the TCF 

from Fund 101 (Trust Fund) to Fund 151. 

 

b. Unreconciled differences between the DOE accounting records and project 
implementers’ records on fund transfers affecting the Receivables account by 

P239,356,386.16 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Accounting Division and 

responsible bureaus to reconcile, review and coordinate with the project 

implementers on the variance noted between DOE’s books and project 

implementers’ records, and thereafter make the necessary adjusting journal 

entries. 

 

c. Unreconciled differences between accounting records and RPCPPE on PPE 
accounts in the amount of P295,164,530.94 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accounting Division 

and the General Services Division (GSD) to complete the reconciliation of their 

respective PPE records to identify the nature and details of the unreconciled 

difference and to update their respective Property, Plant and Equipment Ledger 

Cards (PPELCs) and Property Cards (PCs); accordingly, make the necessary 

adjustments/corrections affecting their respective records for the reconciling items 

noted; and thereafter to periodically reconcile their records to ensure accurate 

year-end balances of PPE accounts. 

 

d. Unaccounted discrepancy between the accounting records and the Summary 
Report on the Inter-Agency Payables for P21,635,788.78 



viii 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Accounting Division to:          

(a) conduct reconciliation of the Due to BIR, Due to GSIS, Due to Pag-IBIG and 

Due to PhilHealth accounts with the corresponding Summary Report of 

Deductions and Remittances; (b) prepare the necessary adjusting journal entries to 

correct the account balances in the books; and (c) maintain an efficient and 

complete monitoring tool/subsidiary ledger for all the DOE employees to facilitate 

verification and reconciliation of their contributions and payments. 

 

3. DOE obligated P1,320,918,889.04 or 72.32 percent of its total allotments of 
P1,826,542,531.66 and disbursed P879,395,168.75 or 66.57 percent thereof, while 

P1,251,340,675.48 or 61.59 percent of the total received cash allocation of 

P2,031,758,290.00 was utilized, indicating low utilization of its fund releases in CY 

2020 contrary to Section 60 of Republic Act (RA) No. 11465 or the General 

Appropriation Act (GAA) for Fiscal year (FY) 2020 and paragraph 3.4 of the National 

Budget Circular (NBC) No. 578 dated January 6, 2020. (Observation No. 3) 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to improve its absorptive/spending 

capacity through timely implementation of projects/activities/programs for the 

efficient utilization of its fund releases for the operation and attainment of the mandate 

of the agency and to avoid lapsing of cash allocation. 

 

4. The non-collection of the training commitments (TCs) and development assistance 
(DA) earned from the energy service contracts as authorized receipts/revenues under 

RA No. 7638 amounting to P907,855,222.15  and P202,021,442.74, respectively, due 

to lack of clear policy on the process and enforcement of collection thereof by the 

responsible divisions, deprived the DOE and the government as a whole of the 

technical and financial support to augment resources for the energy development 

programs/projects. (Observation No. 4) 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: (a) conduct extensive review of the 

internal process in the preparation of billing statements and demand letters for the 

collection of TC and DA arising from the service contracts of DOE; (b) immediately 

resolve as to who shall be the responsible office to submit the Status Report on DA 

earned from Conventional Energy (CE) and furnish the Audit Team with a copy of 

their report for CY 2020; (c)  revisit DO No. 2006-02-002 as to the existence and 

function of the Training Commitment Management Committee and amend, if 

necessary, to conform with the current scenario of DOE; (d) submit the list of non-

collected TC and DA on terminated contracts, and the copies of the Semestral Status 

Reports on TC mentioned in the DO No. 2006-02-002; (e) send periodic billing 

statements or letters requesting the collection from Service Contractors of their 

outstanding TC and DA to have substantial improvement in their collection thereof; 

and (f) copy furnish the Audit Team for any collection cases filed against the erring 

Service Contractors. 

 

5. Dormant and other unnecessary cash in bank accounts maintained as Local Currency, 
Current Account (LCCA) amounting to P33,698,120.37 were not remitted to the 



ix 

 

National Treasury contrary to Section 6 of the General Provisions of RA No. 11465, 

or the GAA for FY 2020, and Permanent Committee Joint Circular No. 4-2012 dated 

September 11, 2012, thus, depriving the National Government of the proper disposition 

and productive use of the funds. (Observation No. 5) 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the concerned Official/s to cause 

the closing of all inactive, dormant, and unnecessary bank accounts and deposit the 

cash proceeds to the Bureau of the Treasury pursuant to Sections 6 and 10, General 

Provisions of the GAA FY 2020. 

 

6. The Monthly Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS) were not submitted within the 
prescribed period to the Audit Team contrary to Section 7, Chapter 21 of the 

Government Accounting Manual for National Government Agencies (GAM for 

NGAs) Volume 1, thus, preventing timely review of cash transactions and early 

detection of errors, if any. (Observation No. 6) 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: (a) direct the designated staff at the 

Accounting Division to make representation and/or closely coordinate with LBP for 

the timely issuance of the monthly bank statement and/or consider availing of the 

bank’s we-Access online facility to view and download or print needed statement to 

facilitate the preparation of BRS; and (b) immediately submit the monthly BRS to the 

Office of the Auditor, and henceforth, strictly adhere with Section 60 of Chapter 19, 

and Sections 3, 5 and 7 of Chapter 21 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume 1 for the prompt 

submission of BRS to the Office of the Auditor to facilitate timely audit of cash 

accounts. 

 

7. Long outstanding fund transfers to 88 Implementing Agencies amounting to 
P122,162,945.45 remained unliquidated/unrefunded for 10 to 38 years, hence, 

considered dormant accounts as defined under Sections 5.4 and 5.6 of COA Circular 

No. 2016-005. The dormant accounts imply the inability of the DOE to strictly enforce 

the submission of fund utilization reports on transferred funds and the return of any 

unutilized balance by project implementers pursuant to Sections 4.6 and 4.9 of COA 

Circular No. 94-013 as a tool in monitoring completion or progress of the projects. 

(Observation No. 7) 
 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the responsible 

bureaus/divisions to: (a) coordinate with project implementers for the refund of 

unliquidated fund transfers of completed projects; (b) identify the persons responsible 

for the existence of dormant accounts and file appropriate actions against them, if 

warranted; and (c) request for the write-off of the dormant accounts by complying with 

the procedural and documentary requirements of COA Circular No. 2016-005. 

 

We further recommended and Management agreed to direct the responsible bureaus 

in-charge with project implementation and the Accounting Division to periodically 

coordinate on the monitoring and follow-up of periodic liquidation of fund transfers of 

the respective implementing partners as required under COA Circular 94-013, and for 



x 

 

the inclusion in the Semestral Status of Unliquidated Fund Transfers the status of 

outstanding fund transfers.  

 

8. The General Services Division incurred a delay of forty-three (43) days in the 
submission of the RPCPPE for CY 2020 to the Audit Team as set under Section 38, 

Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs Volume I. Moreover, deficiencies in the submitted 

RPCPPE were noted and Property Acknowledgement Receipts (PARs) were not 

renewed every three years. (Observation No. 8) 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the: (a) Inventory 

Committee/Chief of GSD to strictly comply with the submission of the RPCPPE on or 

before January 31 of each year to the Office of the Auditor as required under Section 

38, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs Volume 1; (b) Chief of GSD to strictly comply 

with prescribed format of RPCPPE as provided under Appendix 73 of the GAM for 

NGAs Volume II to ensure complete capture of significant information; and (c) GSD 

to expedite the renewal of PARs and ensure that the PAR issued are renewed once 

every three (3) years or every time there is a change in custodianship/user of the 

property to establish the accountability over the properties. 

 

9. The Enhanced Energy Virtual One-Stop Shop (EVOSS) System project disclosed (a) 
delayed completion of the project according to the terms and conditions of the contract; 

(b) the procurement lacks sufficient documentation to comply with the conditions of 

awarding the contract through direct contracting; and (c) other deficiencies in the 

contract documents compromising the propriety, transparency, efficiency and 

economy in the procurement of services worth P34,496,000.00. (Observation No. 9)  

 

We recommended to the Management to: (a) coordinate with other government 

agencies to submit the streamlined processes pertaining to them to facilitate the 

completion and implementation of the enhanced EVOSS system; (b) submit to the 

Office of the COA Auditor copy of the following: 

 

i. Certificate of Proprietary Rights and Certificate of Exclusive Distributorship of 
EOI over the old EVOSS system as required under Section V, Paragraph A No.1, 

Annex H, of the 2016 Revised IRR of RA No. 9184; 
 

ii. Result of study/survey done to determine that there are no companies 

selling/offering such services at lower price; the justification/proof of the necessity 

of the services that it may only be procured through direct contracting, and that 

there is no other suitable substitute in the market that can be obtained at more 

advantageous terms as required under Section V, Paragraph A No.1 last paragraph, 

Annex H, of the 2016 Revised IRR of RA No. 9184;  
 

iii. all other documentary requirements such as Warranty Security, Mayor’s/Business

(c) henceforth, ensure adherence to the provisions of Section 3.1.1 of COA Circular 

No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009 on the submission of the perfected contract to 

the Office of the Auditor within five (5) working days from its execution, and COA 

Circular No. 82-122-B dated January 8, 1982 requiring the Accounting Official as 

signatory witness in the government contracts. 

 

10. The DOE did not observe the provisions of Paragraphs 5 and 6 relative to procedural 
requirements of the Implementing Guidelines on the Agency-to-Agency Agreement 

issued by the GPPB, and RA No. 9184 and the 2016 Revised Implementing Rules and 

Regulations (RIRR) on its procurement of the Digital Transformation Enterprise 

Content Management (ECM) with Business Process Management project worth 

P18,135,000.00, thus, there was no assurance that the agency procured the services at 

the most advantageous price available in the market. (Observation No. 10)  

 

We recommended that Management: (a) submit to the Office of the Auditor a copy of 

cost-benefit-analysis done taking into consideration the factors to justify that the 

Agency-to-Agency procurement is more efficient and economical for the government 

as required under paragraph 5 of the General Conditions of the Implementing 

Guidelines on Agency-to-Agency Agreements, Negotiated Procurement of the GPPB, 

and Section V par. D sub-par. 5(c)(i) of Annex H of the 2016 Revised Implementing 

Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA No. 9184; (b) approve and sign the MOA only 

upon the approval/issuance of the BAC Resolution and NOA as required under 

Paragraph 6 (d) of the Procedural Requirements of the Implementing Guidelines on 

Agency-to-Agency Agreement, Negotiated Procurement of the GPPB, and Section V 

par. D sub-par. 5(c)(iv) of Annex H of the 2016 Revised Implementing Rules and 

Regulations (IRR) of RA No. 9184; and (c) ensure that future similar transactions must 

be compliant with the pertinent rules and regulations.
