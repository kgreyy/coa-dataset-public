OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

 

A. FINANCIAL AUDIT 
 

Accounting Errors and Improper Accounting Treatment of Transactions 

 

1. There were total misstatements of P37,199,029.29 due to accounting errors and 
improper accounting treatment of transactions that are considered departure from 

the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSASs) affecting some of 

DOE’s financial accounts, but considered not material enough to affect the fair 

presentation of the financial statements as at year-end of the DOE.    
 

1.1 Section 15, Chapter 2, of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National 
Government Agencies (NGAs) Volume I requires that the Financial Statements (FSs) 

present fairly the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of an entity. 

Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other 

events, and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for 

assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in International Public Sector 

Accounting Standards (IPSASs). 

 

1.2 Audit of the various accounts in the FSs as at December 31, 2020 of the DOE disclosed 
total uncorrected misstatements/errors of P37,199,029.29 summarized in the matrix 

below and discussed in the succeeding paragraphs:

a) Unrecorded various PPE items in the books of accounts and in the RPCPPE – 
P34,910,805.05 

 

1.3 Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs Volume I provides the accounting standards on PPE 
covering the accounting treatment, measurement, recognition and derecognition to 

ensure that all reported PPEs are existing, accurately valued and completely recorded 

with proper disclosure requirements in the agency FSs. 

 

1.4 Section 3 of the same chapter of the GAM provides that, “the cost of PPE shall be 
recognized as assets if, and only if: (a) it is probable that the future economic benefits 

or service potential associated with the item will flow to the entity; (b) the cost or fair 

value of the item can be measured reliably; (c) beneficial ownership and control clearly 

rest with the government; (d) the asset is used to achieve government objectives; and  

(e) it meets the capitalization threshold of P15,000.00.” 
 

1.5 Section 42 thereof on property forms necessary to account for PPE includes the Report 
on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE), which is the 

prescribed form to report the physical count and condition of PPE by type as at a given 

date, including those which are unrecorded and those which could not be accounted for. 

It shall be rendered on its yearly physical count of properties owned by the agency. 

 

1.6 Review of the Notices of Deliveries for CY 2020 revealed that at least three deliveries 
from different suppliers were not recorded in the books nor reported in the RPCPPE as 

of December 31, 2020. Details are shown below:

1.7 Verification for the delivery of Appcentric Solutions Inc., revealed that only the 
lumpsum amount of P290,273.98 for the LCDs, Computers and TVs was presented in 

the Delivery Receipt (DR), thus, the value/amount of each unit cannot be 

identified/determined for recording purposes. 

 

1.8 The non-recording of the delivered furniture and IT equipment costing P20,249,214.55 
and P14,661.590.50, respectively, in the books of DOE despite meeting the criteria for 

their recognition according to Section 3, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs Volume I 

resulted in the understatement of the PPE account balance as at year-end by 

P34,910,805.05. 
 

1.9 Management informed the Audit Team that the General Service Division (GSD) did not 
include the PPE amounting to P34,910,805.05 in the CY 2020 RPCPPE because the 

deliveries did not go through the final inspection, considering the strict quarantine 

protocols and the limited manpower brought about by the pandemic in the past few 

months that hampered the conduct of final inspection. The GSD however intend to 

include them in the CY 2021 report. 

 

1.10 We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accounting Division to 
immediately prepare the necessary journal entry voucher to take up in the books 

the delivered PPE items amounting to P34,910,805.05, and the GSD to conduct 

final inspection and include the said items of PPE in CY 2020 RPCPPE considering 

their year of acquisition. 

 

b) Error in recording refund of unutilized/excess fund transfer - P562,594.51 
 

1.11 Verification of the Subsidiary Ledgers (SLs) of fund transfers revealed that Fund 151-
Due from GOCC account has a negative balance of P562,594.51. This pertains to the 



50 

 

excess fund transfer refunded by the Development Academy of the Philippines (DAP) 

per OR No. 27090 dated January 23, 2020. The related SL for the recorded fund transfer 

balance was in Fund 151-Due from NGAs. Thus, the Due from NGAs and Due from 

GOCCs account is overstated and understated, respectively, by the amount of 

P562,594.51. 
 

1.12 We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accounting Division to 
make the necessary journal entry to correct the error in the accounts affected, 

including the posting in the related SLs. 
 

c) Erroneous treatment in recording of remittance of taxes withheld  – P1,725,629.73  
 

1.13 Chapter 3 of the GAM for NGAs Volume III provides for the following description of 
the accounts, to wit: 

 
Account Name Description 

Repairs and Maintenance-

Buildings and Other 

Structures 

This account is used to recognize the cost of repairs and maintenance 

on office buildings, school buildings, hospitals and health centers, 

markets, slaughterhouses, hostels and dormitories, and other structures. 

 

Due to BIR This account is used to recognize withholding of taxes from 

officers/employees and other entities, and the subsequent remittance 

thereof to the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR). 

 

 

1.14 Audit of the accounts and financial transactions as verified from the tax remittance 
advice (TRA) and the summary of taxes withheld disclosed that the remittance of taxes 

withheld from DOE employees, suppliers and contractors for CY 2020 was erroneously 

recorded as Repairs and Maintenance-Buildings and Other Structures instead of 

settlement under the Due to BIR account in the amount of P1,725,629.73. This is 

inconsistent with the description of the accounts affected above.  

 

1.15  The misclassification of account overstated both the account Repairs and Maintenance 
– Buildings and Other Structures and the Due to BIR account by P1,725,629.73. The 

inadvertent error manifests existence of gaps in the review process in financial reporting. 

Inadequate review of the journal entries leads to erroneous recorded transactions which 

affect the fair presentation of account/s balance/s in the financial statements.  
 

1.16  We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accounting Division to 
make the necessary journal entry to correct the error in accounting treatment, and; 

henceforth, strengthen the review process in preparing journal entries to ensure 

that all transactions are properly recorded in the books of accounts. 

 

Accounting Deficiencies Affecting Reliability of Account Balances 

2. Accounting deficiencies affecting some accounts to the extent of P662,130,324.26 
due to the inability of agency officials concerned to implement the controls 

required under existing regulations in the reconciliation and validation of account 



51 

 

balances were noted. Based on the possible/potential effects of these deficiencies, 

the reported balances of the affected accounts could not be relied upon.  
 

2.1 Section 6, Chapter 19 of the GAM for NGAs Volume I on Qualitative Characteristics of 
Financial Reporting states that an entity shall present information including accounting 

policies in a manner that meets reliable information which is free from material error and 

bias, and can be depended on by users to represent faithfully that which it purports to 

represent or could reasonably be expected to represent. 

 

2.2 Audit disclosed that there were accounting deficiencies in the financial accounts 
requiring further analysis, reconciliation, physical count/verification, coordination and 

future corrective actions as these have possible effects on the accuracy and reliability of 

their reported balances in the aggregate amount of P17,301,362,882.91.  The table below 

presents the accounts affected and the deficiencies noted, together with the corresponding 

amounts compromised.

a. Unreconciled difference in the book and bank records, and non-transfer of Training 
Commitment Fund (TCF) from Fund 101 (Trust Fund) to Fund 151 affecting the Cash 

account – P105,973,618.38 and P279,848,114.27, respectively 

 

2.3 Section 74 of PD No. 1445 or the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines states 
that at the close of each month, depositories shall report to the agency head, in such form 

as he may direct, the condition of the agency account standing on their books. The head 

of the agency shall see to it that a reconciliation is made between the balance shown in 

the reports and the balance found in the books of the agency. 

 



52 

 

2.4 Section 3 of Chapter 21 of the GAM for NGAs Volume I provides that the Bank 
Reconciliation Statement (BRS) shall be prepared in order to check correctness of both 

the bank’s and agency’s records; serve as a deterrent to fraud; and enable the agency or 

bank to take up charges or credits recognized by the bank or agency but not yet known 

to the agency or bank. 

 

2.5 The reliability of the Training Commitment Fund (TCF) in Cash in Bank – LCCA could 
not be ascertained due to unreconciled difference amounting to P105,973,618.38 

between the book and bank records. The Subsidiary Ledger (SL) for TCF shows a 

balance of P317,298,423.39 as of December 31, 2020 while confirmation from the Land 

Bank of the Philippines shows that the Trust Fund/TCF balance was P423,272,041.77. 

 

2.6 Verification disclosed that the TCF’s balance was bloated because of the Unnumbered 
Memorandum dated March 26, 2020 issued by the Administrative and Finance Services 

requiring all Bureaus/ Services/Offices to deposit all collections to Fund 101 (Trust 

Funds) temporarily to avoid going to the Office premises and then transfer afterwards 

to their respective accounts. 

 

2.7 Further verification disclosed that for CY 2020, the total deposited collections to Fund 
101 (Trust Fund) was P1,135,409,752.84. Of this amount P855,561,638.27 was 

transferred to Fund 151 leaving a balance of P279,848,114.27 which remained to be in 

the Fund 101 (Trust Fund) as of December 31, 2020. 

 

2.8 We recommended and Management agreed to require the: 
 

a. Accounting Division to conduct reconciliation of the book and bank records 
pertaining to the Training Commitment Fund in Cash in Bank–Local 

Currency, Current Account and prepare necessary journal entries; and 
 

b. Treasury Division to transfer the TCF from Fund 101 (Trust Fund) to Fund 
151. 

 

2.9 Management commented that the Accounting Division will coordinate with the 
Administrative Services (AS)-Treasury Division (TD) for the reconciliation of the 

accounts and eventual fund transfer of funds from Fund 101 (Trust Fund) to Fund 151. 

 

b. Unreconciled difference between the DOE accounting records and project implementers’ 
records on fund transfers affecting the Receivables account– P239,356,386.16  

 

2.10 Pars. 6.1, 7.1 and 7.2 of the COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016 
prescribes the general and specific guidelines on outstanding receivables as follows: 

 

6.1 All government entities shall conduct regular monitoring and analysis of 

receivable accounts to ensure that these are collected when these become due and 

demandable and that cash advances and fund transfers are liquidated within the 

prescribed period depending upon their nature and purpose. 



53 

 

The Accountant shall: 

 

7.1  Conduct regular and periodic verification, analysis, and validation of the existence 

of the receivables, unliquidated cash advances, and fund transfers, and determine 

the concerned debtors, accountable officers (Regular and Special Disbursing 

Officers, Collecting Officers, Cashiers) and the source and implementing 

government entities concerned. 

 

7.2  Reconcile the unliquidated fund transfers between the source and implementing 

government entities, prepare the adjusting entries for the reconciling items noted, 

and require liquidation of the balances. 

 

2.11 As of December 31, 2020, the outstanding fund transfers to project implementers 
amounted to P1,868,367,595.78, out of which, P1,772,895,091.34 were transferred to 

government agencies while P95,472,504.44 were transferred to non-government 

organizations and private entities. 

 

2.12 The Audit Team sent Confirmation Letters (CLs) to various National Government 
Offices, Electric Cooperatives, Local Government Units, Non-Government 

Organizations/ People's Organizations and Private Institutions on various dates for 

balances on cut-off dates as of June 30 and October 31, 2019. The CLs were for projects 

funded from the Regular Agency Fund (Fund 101), Foreign Assisted Fund (F102), 

Special Accounts in the General Fund (Fund151) and Trust Fund (Fund 184), 

respectively to ensure correctness and reliability of the receivables balance. A total of 

292 CLs in total amount of P1,729,749,665.66 were sent to implementers. 

 

2.13 Out of the 292 confirmation letters sent, 144 replied with a total cut-off date balance of 
P1,003,128,954.44 and confirmed amount of P570,210,364.25, resulting in a difference 

of P432,918,590.19. 

 

2.14 Roll forward of balances was then conducted to bring the balances from confirmation 
cut-off date to as of December 31, 2020. As noted, out of the 144 replies received, 69 

replies from project implementers with a total balance of P354,436,629.37 as of 

December 31, 2020 were still outstanding in the books of DOE despite that these 

projects were already completed and fully implemented, while confirmation from 

various project implementers whether completed, fully implemented, and ongoing and 

partly utilize shows a total of P115,080,243.21 which resulted to P239,356,386.16 

unreconciled difference.  

 

2.15 Due to limited data, the Audit Team could not further confirm whether the implementers 
already submitted the required documents or are still pending with the DOE for 

validation as of December 31, 2020.  

 

2.16 Verification of the reply to CLs disclosed that some projects implementers indicated that 
they have no records on the fund transfer received from DOE. 

 



54 

 

2.17 Further verification of the reply to CLs disclosed that MERALCO’s account recorded 
in Fund 184 in the amount of P71,686,840.31 as of October 31, 2019 for various 

electrification projects were already completed and still waiting for DOE’s feedback on 

the results of their verification/validation. All financial documents were submitted to 

DOE on September 30, 2019 and January 30, 2020 for final validation of project cost, 

but the balance showed that only P4,945,418.67 was recorded as liquidated and 

P66,741,421.64 remained outstanding as of December 31, 2020. 

 

2.18 Moreover, confirmation reply from the Department of Agriculture (DA) with a balance 
of P2,000,000.00 per DOE accounting records stated that the recipient for the fund 

transfer could be the Philippine Agricultural Development and Commercial Corporation 

(PADCC). The Audit Team sent another letter but was returned to sender with reason 

of RTS as “moved out”. Verification of the 2019 Management Letter (ML) on the 

PADCC issued by COA disclosed that the PADCC closed its operations on June 30, 

2014 and was in the process of winding up the business. Based on the ML, the full 

liquidation of affairs of the PADCC is not yet completed despite the lapse of more than 

6 years from the approval of its dissolution on November 26, 2013. The 2019 PADCC 

ML shows that out of the P2,000,000.00 funds received from DOE on December 23, 

2010 for the 1st Philippine International Biofuels Feedstock Conference, only 

P365,189.00 remained as outstanding, while the DOE’s books showed that the entire 

P2,000,000.00 funds were still outstanding as of December 31, 2020 as there was no 

movement in the account from November 1, 2019 to December 31, 2020, thus registered 

a difference of P1,634,811.00. 

 

2.19 Delayed and liquidation of project cost would result in out of period recognition of 
expenses in DOE’s books and would cause significant prior period errors in the 

accumulated surplus and deficit as of year-end. Likewise, long-outstanding fund 

transfers resulted in the accumulation of dormant fund transfers and non-collection of 

excess funds that could have been used in other projects. 

 

2.20 We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Accounting Division and 
responsible bureaus to reconcile, review and coordinate with the project 

implementers on the variance noted between DOE’s books and project 

implementers’ records, and thereafter make the necessary adjusting journal 

entries. 

 

2.21 Management acknowledged the observations and recommendations and informed that 
they will endeavor to implement/comment once relevant verification within the 

Accounting Division and/or other units of DOE is done. Copy of confirmation letter 

replies were requested in line with the effort to reconcile the difference between DOE’s 

books and the various Project Implementers’ records.

c. Unreconciled differences between accounting records and RPCPPE on PPE accounts – 
P295,164,530.94 

 

2.22 Section 42, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs Volume 1 provides that “The Chief 
Accountant shall maintain the PPELC for each category of PPE including work and 

other animals, livestock etc. The PPELC shall be kept to record promptly the 

acquisition, description, custody, estimated useful life, depreciation, impairment loss, 

disposal and other information about the asset. For check and balance, the Property and 

Supply Office/Unit shall likewise maintain PC for PPE in their custody to account for 

the receipt and disposition of the same. The balance per PC shall be reconciled with 

PPELC maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit. They shall also be reconciled with 

other property records like PAR.” 

 

2.23 The same section of the GAM prescribes the use of Report on the Physical Count of 
Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) to report the physical count and condition of 

PPE by type as at a given date, including those which are unrecorded and those which 

could not be accounted for. It shows the balance of PPE per PC and per count and the 

shortage/overage, if any. 

 

2.24 The Audit Team’s comparison of the PPE account balances between the General Ledger 
(GL) and the RPCPPE disclosed an unreconciled difference of P295,164,530.94 as of 

year-end. Details are as follows: 

 

Account 
Per GL Per RPCPPE Difference 

(In PhP) 

Land 47,756,000.00 47,756,000.00 0.00 

Land Improvements 0.00 2,015,115.10 2,015,115.10

Machinery and Equipment 1,404,444,679.94 1,273,215,873.66 131,228,806.28 

Transportation Equipment 170,161,706.99 213,358,059.75 43,196,352.76 

Furniture and Fixtures  5,112,547.47 29,361,827.45 24,249,279.98 

Total  1,772,019,903.60 1,804,726,821.98 295,164,530.94 

 

2.25 Interview with the Accountant and the Property Officer disclosed that the discrepancies 
were from the unreconciled differences from prior years due to improper classification 

of accounts. 

 

2.26 Verification also disclosed that the Supply and Property Section and Accounting 
Division do not regularly update their Property Cards (PC) and Property Plant and 

Equipment Ledger Cards (PPELCs), respectively, which caused the unreconciled 

discrepancies.   

 

2.27 Further, we noted that there was no regular reconciliation of records between the AD 
and the GSD which resulted in the significant amount of unreconciled difference 

affecting reliability of the PPE accounts. The Audit Team however was informed that 

for CY 2020, the AD and GSD have already commenced the reconciliation of the 

differences of the PPE balances of P295,164,530.94. 

 



56 

 

2.28 We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accounting Division and 
the General Services Division to complete the reconciliation of their respective PPE 

records to identify the nature and details of the unreconciled difference and to 

update their respective PPELCs and PCs; accordingly, make the necessary 

adjustments/corrections affecting their respective records for the reconciling items 

noted; and thereafter, to periodically reconcile their records to ensure accurate 

year-end balances of PPE accounts. 

 

2.29 Management has taken note of the differences and that the AD is still coordinating with 
Supplies and Property Section of GSD regarding the one-time cleaning of PPE accounts 

in CY 2020. 

 

d. Unaccounted discrepancy between the accounting records and the Summary Report on the 
Inter-Agency Payables – P21,635,788.78 

 

2.30 The GAM for NGAs Volume III prescribes that the Due to BIR account is used to 
recognize withholding of taxes from officers/ employees and other entities. Debit this 

account for remittance of the taxes withheld to the BIR. 

 

2.31 Likewise, the accounts Due to PhilHealth, Due to Pag-Ibig and Due to GSIS are used to 
recognize withholding of employees’ premium payments and other payables for 

remittance to PhilHealth, Pag-Ibig and GSIS, respectively.  Debit these accounts for the 

remittance of withheld amounts. 

 

2.32 Annex 6 of the GAM for NGAs Volume II prescribes the use of SL showing details for 
each control account in the GL.  

 

2.33 Audit revealed that the balances presented in the Summary Report of Deductions and 
Remittances for the Due to BIR, Due to PhilHealth, Due to Pag-Ibig and Due to GSIS 

accounts did not reconcile with their corresponding GL accounts as of year-end, as 

shown below: 

 

Account 
Per GL Per Summary Report Difference 

(In PhP) 

Due to BIR 12,894,244.53 0.00 12,894,244.53 

Due to GSIS 6,987,928.48 (544,676.36) 7,532,604.84 

Due to Pag-IBIG 385,307.08 54,600.00 330,707.08 

Due to PhilHealth 878,262.49 30.16 878,232.33 

Total  21,145,742.58 (490,046.20) 21,635,788.78 

 

2.34 Upon verification, it was noted that the unreconciled record and report was caused by 
the absence of efficient and complete monitoring tool on taxes and premiums withheld 

and remitted including loan repayments withheld and remitted for each DOE personnel, 

and timing difference between the actual date of remittance and the late posting of 

transactions in the eNGAS. 

 



57 

 

2.35 The Audit Team would like to emphasize that the Summary Reports for these Inter-
Agency Payables served as subsidiary records to be regularly reconciled with the 

corresponding GL controlling accounts. Non-reconciliation thereof casts doubt on the 

accuracy and reliability of the year-end balances of affected accounts that could 

compromise the continues availment of personnel benefits of the DOE employees. 

 

2.36 We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Accounting Division to: 
 

a. conduct reconciliation of the Due to BIR, Due to GSIS, Due to Pag-IBIG and 
Due to PhilHealth accounts with the corresponding Summary Report of 

Deductions and Remittances; 
 

b. prepare the necessary adjusting journal entries to correct the account balances 
in the books; and  

 

c. maintain an efficient and complete monitoring tool/subsidiary ledgers for all 
the DOE employees to facilitate verification and reconciliation of their 

contributions and payments. 
 

2.37 Management commented on the following: 
 

a. Due to GSIS - The deductions and remittances are in accordance with RA No. 8291. 
Much as we would like to remit the exact amount as deducted from the officers and 

employees, however, GSIS accept remittance/payments based on their generated 

billing statements, hence there is a discrepancy between the Due to GSIS account 

and Summary Report of Deductions and Remittances.  

 

GSIS records can only be updated and/or adjusted through Agency Remittance 

Advice (ARA) which shall be handled by the Human Resources Division (HRD) as 

they are the ones authorized to do so. When these are updated and reconciled, the 

Accounting Division will record the adjustments as warranted. 

 

b. Due to Pag-Ibig - The deductions and remittances are in accordance with HDMF 
Law RA No. 7742 and RA No. 9679. However, the premium contributions from 

March to May 2020 were remitted only in November 2020 by the Treasury Division 

(TD) since this was the start of the pandemic and adequate working arrangements 

and timings were not yet in place. 

 

c. Due to PhilHealth Fund - The monthly contributions and remittances are in 
accordance with Section 18 of RA No. 10606. Please be informed that the monthly 

remittances made through Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) is within the 

prescribed period. Copies of Official Receipt (OR) on file would show the 

validation date of LBP receipt. It is possible that discrepancies occur between 

PhilHealth and DOE records as there are adjustments not known to us until and 

unless reconciliation is prepared. The necessary adjusting entries will be prepared, 

if any, to correct the account balance in the books and to update SL as needed. 



58 

 

 

d. Due to BIR - The Accounting Division strictly adhered to BIR Regulation No 1-
2013. As a result of timing difference between actual date of remittance and posting 

of transactions in the General Ledger, there is a noted difference in the ending 

balance of Due to BIR account. The necessary adjusting entries will be prepared, if 

any, to correct the account balance in the books and to update SL as needed. 

  

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

2.38 Government offices has resumed operations in June 2020, hence, remittances of Pag-
IBIG premium contribution could have done earlier. 

 

2.39 We remain to encourage the Management to conduct reconciliation of the Due to BIR, 
Due to GSIS, Due to Pag-IBIG and Due to PhilHealth accounts with the corresponding 

Summary Report of Deductions and Remittances and adjust the respective accounts 

accordingly. 

 

 

B. COMPLIANCE AUDIT 
 

Low Budget Utilization  
 

3. DOE obligated P1,320,918,889.04 or 72.32 percent of its total allotments of 
P1,826,542,531.66 and disbursed P879,395,168.75 or 66.57 percent thereof, while 

P1,251,340,675.48 or 61.59 percent of the total received cash allocation of 

P2,031,758,290.00 was utilized, indicating low utilization of its fund releases in CY 

2020 contrary to Section 60 of Republic Act (RA) No. 11465 or the General 

Appropriation Act (GAA) for FY 2020 and paragraph 3.4 of the National Budget 

Circular (NBC) No. 578 dated January 6, 2020. 

 

3.1 Section 60 of RA No. 11465, or the GAA for FY 2020 and Section 3.4 of the National 
Budget Circular (NBC) No. 578 dated January 6, 2020 state that - “all appropriation 

authorized under FY 2020 GAA, including budgetary support to GOCCs and SAGF, 

shall be available for release and disbursement for the purpose specified, and under the 

same General and Special Provisions of the said GAA applicable thereto December 31, 

2020.” 

 

3.2 Moreover, Section 1 of RA No. 11464, An Act Extending the Availability of the 2019 
Appropriations to December 31, 2020, amending for the Purpose Section 65 of the 

General Provisions of RA No. 11260, the GAA for FY 2019, provides that – “All 

appropriations authorized in this Act shall be available for release and obligation for the 

purpose specified, and under the same special provisions applicable thereto, until 

December 31, 2020.” 
 

3.3 Review of DOE’s appropriations, allotments, and obligations as of December 31, 2020 
showed that out of the total funds received and available for spending in the aggregate 

amount of P1,826,542,531.66, the total amount of P1,320,918,889.04 or 72.32 percent 



59 

 

was obligated, leaving P505,623,642.62 or 27.68 percent unobligated/unutilized 

balance. The summary of the budgetary allocations and balances including the

3.5 As can be observed from the above table, the CY 2020 allotment decreased by 31.21 
percent   due to re-alignment of fund to be used to implement the national policy to 

address the COVID 19 situations as required under DBM National Budget Circular No. 

580 dated April 22, 2020. Moreover, the DOE was not able to fully utilize its allotment 

and incurred a low obligation and disbursement rates of 72.32 percent and 66.57 percent 

respectively, in CY 2020. Of the obligations incurred, P879,395,168.75 were 

utilized/disbursed, and the remaining P441,523,720.29 were unpaid. Of the undisbursed 



60 

 

amount, P410,120,805.82 were already due and demandable while P31,402,914.47 were 

committed to the projects of the National Energy Efficiency and Conservation Program 

(NEECP). 

 

3.6 The low obligation and disbursement rates were due to the delayed/non-implementation 
of the programmed projects/activities for the year because of the declaration of the 

Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) and travel restrictions, followed by a series of 

lockdown by reason of the pandemic. 

 

3.7 In like manner, the cash allocations received were also not fully utilized and lapsed 
during the year. For CY 2020, DOE received a total NCAs of P2,031,758,290.00, of 

which, only P1,251,340,675.48 or 61.59 percent was utilized, thereby, leaving a balance 
of P780,417,614.52, which was reverted to the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr). Details

3.8 The unutilized NCAs amounting to P780,417,614.52 or 38.41 percent of the total cash 
received can be attributed to: (a) non/partial implementation of the locally funded 

projects, and (b) non-implementation of their programs/activities/projects for CY 2020.

3.9 As can be observed from the above table, the project Total Electrification Project (TEP) 
has the lowest utilization rate of only one (1) percent. Its low utilization was due to the 

non-conduct of various activities such as consultations, assessment, review, evaluation, 

meetings, public consultations, and workshops because of the implementation of ECQ 

and travel restrictions. Moreover, the Management is still in the process of addressing 

the issuance of a clear policy/guidelines in the implementation of TEP. 

 

3.10 The under-utilization/spending of NCAs by 38.41 percent is an indication of the 
agency’s inefficient utilization of its fund releases in CY 2020. 

 

3.11 We recommended and Management agreed to improve its absorptive/spending 
capacity through timely implementation of projects/activities/programs for the 

efficient utilization of its fund releases for the operation and attainment of the 

mandate of the agency and to avoid lapsing of cash allocation. 

 

3.12 Management is amenable to the audit observation. The COVID-19 Pandemic and strict 
implementation of Enhanced Community Quarantined (ECQ) affected most of the 

planned activities of DOE which contributed to the low budget utilization and 

disbursement rate. However, DOE still managed to provide continuous delivery of 

service with the use of virtual platform mechanisms, hence less costs were incurred. 

 

3.13 Implementing units are also encouraged to improve their absorptive/spending capacity 
through timely implementation of projects/activities/programs for the efficient 

utilization of the fund releases. 

 



62 

 

3.14 They will continue to monitor financial performance of DOE including the cash 
programming provision of the Cash Planning Report as required by the Bureau of 

Treasury and adapt continuous coordination and consultation with the various units and 

the Department's officials, to strictly implement adoption of the Cash-Based Budgeting 

Approach, for optimum utilization of government resources. 

 

3.15 As a new development, the Department looks forward to the immediate implementation 
of the Budget Treasury Management System (BTMS) as a common modern, integrated, 

accurate, reliable and secure information system that will provide a sustainable 

government resource planning solution. Such will also provide a real time online 

monitoring of appropriations vs. allotments versus obligations and disbursements with 

a systematic real time recording and reporting. With this new system, DOE can be 

assured that funds are efficiently and effectively monitored. 

 

3.16 Also, following COA's recommendations, the DOE, through the Task Force E-Power 
Mo (TFEM) already prepared the Policy Guidelines on the TEP covering the seven (7) 

electrification strategies in providing electricity services to unserved and underserved 

areas in remote and unviable areas. The policy guidelines intend to ensure that timelines 

in the TEP will be strictly followed and the conditions to be set forth in the Memoranda 

of Agreement (MOAs) to be entered into by the DOE with the concerned implementing 

entities (distribution utilities, National Electrification Administration and NPC) are 

firmly observed. Further, a provision allowing the utilization of the unreleased funds 

and/or funds already released to distribution utilities/electric cooperatives servicing the 

affected area/s is likewise included. 

 

Uncollected income from Training Commitment and Development Assistance fees 
  

4. The non-collection of the training commitments and development assistance 
earned from the energy service contracts as authorized receipts/revenues under 

RA No. 7638 amounting to P907,855,222.15 and P202,021,442.74, respectively, due 

to lack of clear policy on the process and enforcement of collection thereof by the 

responsible divisions, deprived the DOE and the government as a whole, of the 

technical and financial support to augment resources for the energy development 

programs/projects. 

 

4.1 As the main energy exploration and development arm of the government, the DOE is 
mandated to prepare, integrate, coordinate, supervise and control all plans, programs, 

projects, and activities of the Government relative to energy exploration, development, 

utilization, distribution and conservation. In line with their vision to achieve total and 

reliable energization and energy self-sufficiency of the country, the DOE encourages 

greater private sector participation through various arrangements such as service 

contracts in the active exploration, development, and extraction of energy resources in 

selected areas. 

 

4.2 Accordingly, the DOE’s Special Account in the General Fund (SAGF-151) was 
established pursuant to Section 8 of PD No. 910 or An Act Creating the Energy 



63 

 

Development Board dated March 22, 1976, as amended by RA No. 7638 or the 

Department of Energy Act of 1992 dated December 9, 1992, which provides that: 

 

“All fees, revenues and receipts of the Board (Energy Development 

Board – now the DOE) from any and all sources including receipts from 

service contracts and agreements such as application and processing fees, 

signature bonus, discovery bonus, production bonus; all money collected 

from concessionaires, representing unspent work obligations, fines and 

penalties under the Petroleum Act of 1949; as well as the government 

share representing royalties, rentals, production share on service 

contracts and similar payments on the exploration, development and 

exploitation of energy resources, shall form part of a Special Fund to be 

used to finance energy resource development and exploitation programs 

and projects of the government and for such other purposes as may be 

hereafter directed by the President.” 

 

4.3 Service Contracts (SC) entered into by and between the DOE and various 
contractors/operators/developers relative to the exploration, development and 

production of Conventional Energy (CE) such as Petroleum and Coal, and Renewable 

Energy (RE) such as Biomass, Geothermal, Hydropower, Ocean Energy, Wind Energy 

and Solar Energy detailed the work and financial obligations of the latter to DOE, 

including the payment/remittance of one or more of the following:  

 

a. Government share from production/sale of petroleum, coal, and renewable energy; 
b. Signature bonus; Training commitment for DOE personnel for each contract year;  
c. Development assistance (in kind or in cash) to DOE during pre-development/ 

exploration and development/production stage; 

d. Discovery bonus; and 
e. Production bonus. 

 

4.4 The Training Commitment (TC) is intended to support the training needs of DOE 
personnel such as technical training (SAP), seminar on capacity building, and 

seminar/workshop on technology innovations. It is an annual commitment, but 

cumulative during the duration of the contract if not availed in a particular year. Any 

unfulfilled training obligation shall survive the cancellation of the contract and any 

unutilized amount accrued prior to the termination of the contract shall be remitted to 

the DOE by the service contractors.  

 

4.5 While, the Development Assistance (DA) is a financial obligation, often in-kind, 
intended to augment the technical resources of the DOE to facilitate administration and 

monitoring of pertinent projects. It accrues either once or twice a year during the 

duration of the contract, with the corresponding value of goods to be delivered already 

specified in the contract.

4.6 Verification disclosed that based on the submitted Status of Training Commitment and 
Development Assistance (STCDA) provided by the Financial Services (FS) as of 

December 31, 2020,  a total of P22,346,277.75 and P1,022,000.00 were collected on TC 

and DA, respectively. However, uncollected TC amounting to P907,855,222.15 and at 

least P202,021,442.74 for DA were noted, with details presented in the next tables.

4.9 During the meeting with the officials of Financial Services (FS), Accounting Division 
(AD), Energy Resource Development Bureau (ERDB), Renewable Energy Management 

Bureau (REMB), Conventional Energy Resource Compliance Division (CERCD), and 

Renewable Energy Resource Compliance Division (RERCD) on March 2, 2021, the 

Audit Team deduced that the low rate of collection was due to lapses in the internal 

process such as the inability of the concerned divisions to send billing statement/request 

to Service Contractors, and demand letter for those contracts that have already expired. 

These are necessary in order for them to remit the outstanding TC and DA to DOE 

regularly and religiously.   

 

4.10 The ERDB, tasked with the formulation and implementation of government policies, 
programs and regulations relating to the exploration, development and production of 

indigenous petroleum, coal and geothermal energy resources, and related product and 

market development thereof, explained that the TC and DA for the service contracts that 

were due for termination and request for relinquishment were collected being a 

requirement for the Secretary’s approval of the termination and relinquishment. While 

REMB, which is in-charge of the formulation and implementation of policies, plans and 

programs related to the accelerated development, transformation, utilization and 

commercialization of renewable energy resources including emerging energy 

technologies, disclosed that collection of TC and DA for RE service contracts is not a 

requirement for the Secretary’s approval of the terminated, surrendered and relinquished 

service contracts. 

 

4.11 As to the Service Contracts (SC) with status reported as active, cancelled, development, 
existing, expired, inactive, for conversion, force majeure, operating contract, 

overwritten, pre-development, production and show cause, the DOE is already in the 

process of sending billing statements and demand letters to all service contracts which 

are already cancelled, expired, and inactive for the collection of their corresponding 

outstanding TC and DA.  

 

4.12 The ERDB and REMB collections during CY 2020 were mainly attributed to 
terminated, relinquished, surrendered and withdrawn contracts. For other contracts 

which are active, under pre-development and development, almost none were collected 

and remained outstanding as of December 31, 2020. Out of 1,231 SCs, only 37 SCs were 

reported with minimal collections of TC and DA. The details are as follows:

4.13 As presented to the Audit Team by the ERDB and REMB, the DOE has an existing 
process flow on the collection of the TC and DA from the service contracts for 

termination and relinquishment. However, there is no process presented on the 

collection for service contracts such as those considered active, inactive, for conversion 

to development, expired, cancelled, etc.  

 

4.14 The Audit Team  was also informed that the RERCD and CERCD are the ones preparing 
the  order of payment based on the Memorandum issued by ERDB and REMB to service 

contractors for the settlement of their  outstanding TC and DA. The RERCD and 

CERCD are also the responsible offices when it comes to monitoring and collection of 

financial obligations of the Service Contractors.  

 

4.15 Based on the reports submitted, the offices responsible for the collection of TC and DA 
are as follows: 

 

Type of SC TC DA 

CE (petroleum, 

coal) 
CERCD 

CERCD informed that ERBD monitors and collects it, 

however, the latter insists that the records of it was 

responsibility of CERCD, since it was a financial obligation.  

RE (biomass, 

geothermal, solar, 

hydropower, 

ocean, wind) 

RERCD RERCD 

        

4.16 There were no reports submitted to the Audit Team for the Status of Collections and 
Receivables for DA as of December 31, 2020. Management was not able to clearly 

inform us whether it is ERDB or CERCD that is responsible for the monitoring and 

collection of DA for Conventional Energy Service Contract.  

 

4.17 Department Order (DO) No. 2006-02-002 dated January 31, 2006 issued by the former 
DOE Secretary is still effective and has not been amended. In the said DO, the Training 

Commitment Management Committee was created, composed of the three 

Undersecretaries with a Chairperson among themselves. It shall be the manager of the 

TCF and responsible for allocating funds for the various uses thereof. The Compliance 

Division, now CERCD and RERCD, shall serve as the Secretariat, who will submit a 

semestral status report on the TC to the Committee. 

 

4.18 Despite the DO, the Management was still not able to clearly establish the duties and 
responsibilities of the supervising Undersecretaries, Assistant Secretaries, Directors and 

Division Chiefs of ERDB, REMB, CERCD and RERCD as to who shall be responsible 

to collect for the TC and DA and to formulate a systematic way of sending billing 

statements yearly to the service contractors. This contributed to the low collections of 

TC and DA. 

 

4.19 It is emphasized that this audit finding on non-collection of TC and DA is not new. This 
was already brought to the attention DOE and formally communicated through  the CYs 

2017 and 2018 Annual Audit Reports. 



67 

 

 

4.20 Review of the submitted STCDA showed that Service Contractors status has been 
classified in the report as active, cancelled, development, existing, expired, for 

conversion to development, force majeure, inactive, operating contract, overwritten, 

pre-development, production, show cause, relinquished, terminated, with motion for 

reconsideration and withdrawn.  

 

4.21 A total of P181,000,804.12 and P78,675,289.02 of TC and DA, respectively, were not 
collected despite having been cancelled, expired, surrendered, for relinquishment, for 

termination, force majeure, inactive, relinquished, show cause, surrendered, terminated, 

with motion for reconsideration and withdrawn. These could indicate doubtful collection 

or the probability of impairment as their collectivity is affected. The details are presented

4.22 The Audit Team requested documents that contain relevant information on the non-
collection of some of the terminated contracts. However, as of audit date, none were 

submitted. Management however explained that some of these Service Contractors have 

financial constraints to pay their outstanding financial obligations. Nonetheless, the 

DOE’s way forward is to send final demand letter immediately and if still no collection, 

they will file appropriate collection cases. 

 

4.23 Further, the Audit Team pointed out that the purpose of the TC and DA was not achieved 
because no trainings that will capacitate the DOE’s officials and employees in the 

monitoring of compliance and audit of the technical and financial obligation of the SCs 

were conducted during the tenure of their appropriate service contracts.  However, the 

DOE contested that, the TC and DA will still serve its purpose once they utilize it for 

the trainings of DOE officials and employees in the future as its nature will benefit all 

and not intended for specific contract.  



68 

 

 

4.24 The non-collection of the TC and DA which resulted in low collection of DOE was due 
to the lapses in the process of collection specifically on who shall be the responsible 

divisions in charge. The DOE did not provide a valid reason on non-collection of other 

SCs that are still active. 

 

4.25 We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 

a. conduct extensive review of the internal process in the preparation of billing 
statements and demand letters for the collection of TC and DA arising from 

the service contracts of DOE; 

  

b. immediately resolve as to who shall be the responsible office to submit the 
Status Report on DA earned from CE and furnish the Audit Team with a copy 

of their report for CY 2020; 

 

c. revisit DO No. 2006-02-002 as to the existence and function of the Training 
Commitment Management Committee and amend, if necessary, to conform 

with the current scenario of DOE; 

 

d. submit the list of non-collected TC and DA on terminated contracts, and the 
copies of the Semestral Status Reports on Training Commitment mentioned in 

the DO No. 2006-02-002; 

 

e. send periodic billing statements or letters requesting the collection from 
Service Contractors of their outstanding TC and DA to have substantial 

improvement in their collection thereof; and 

 

f. copy furnish the Audit Team for any collection cases filed against the erring 
Service Contractors. 

 

4.26 Management commented that the Financial Services (FS) has no objection regarding 
COA’s recommendations that an extensive review of the internal process such as the 

preparation of billing statements and demand letter on the collection of TC and DA 

arising from the SCs be done as soon as possible. The FS Director suggested that the 

review should be presided by the Assistant Secretary and/or Undersecretary supervising 

FS and AS or as assigned/designated by the Secretary because such process involves 

different units of the DOE and such units may have different opinions that have to be 

resolved at once. The review may also include LS and AS in the process. 

 

4.27 The FS Director also suggested that the review may consider that since the concerned 
Bureaus' mandate is to supervise the Service Contractors activities and that they have 

the manpower and the related data needed (work targets vs. accomplishments, status of 

service contracts, resolution of technical and other issues, etc.), they are more in a 

position to also look into the TC and DA obligations of the SCs.   Payment Orders, 

though prepared by the RERCD and CERCD, are usually based on demand letters 



69 

 

initiated by the Bureaus concerned. The plan to resolve the matter includes consultation 

with the Bureau of the Treasury and the COA Government Accountancy Sector hence, 

all inputs from them should be integrated in the internal process. 

 

4.28 Moreover, DO No. 2006-02-0002 is no longer being followed and the Training 
Commitment Management Committee (TCMC) composed of three (3) former  DOE 

Undersecretaries   no longer exists. Also, at that time there was only one (1) Compliance 

Division when the DO was issued, and most contracts pertain to CE. Now,  the DOE 

has more than 1,000 contracts from RE related activities. 
 

Dormant Cash in Bank – LCCA accounts 

 

5. Dormant and other unnecessary cash in bank accounts maintained as Local 
Currency, Current Account (LCCA) amounting to P33,698,120.37 were not 

remitted to the National Treasury contrary to Section 6 of the General Provisions 

of RA No. 11465, or the GAA for FY 2020, and Permanent Committee Joint 

Circular No. 4-2012 dated September 11, 2012, thus, depriving the National 

Government of the proper disposition and productive use of the funds. 

 

5.1 Section 6 of RA No. 11465 or the 2020 GAA requires that the following shall be 
deposited with the National Treasury and recorded as trust receipts in accordance with 

EO No. 338 s. 1996 as implemented by COA-DBM-DOF Joint Circular (JC) No. 1-97 

dated January 2, 1997, and such other guidelines issued thereon:  

 

a. Receipts collected or received by departments, bureaus, offices and 
instrumentalities of the National Government, including Constitutional Offices 

enjoying fiscal autonomy and SUCs: (i) from non-tax sources, such as insurance 

proceeds, acting as trustee, agent or administrator; (ii) as a guaranty for the 

fulfillment of an obligation; or (iii) from donations authorized by law or contract 

with a term not exceeding one (1) year; and  

 

b. Those classified by law or regulations as trust receipts. 
 

Trust receipts shall be disbursed in accordance with the purpose to which it is     

created, subject to the applicable special provisions and accounting and auditing 

rules and regulations. 

 

5.2 Further, Section 10 of the same RA provides the general provision regarding the 
reversion, closure and transfer of balances of Special Accounts, Fiduciary or Trust 

Funds, Revolving Funds and Unauthorized Accounts, to wit: 

 

“Departments, bureaus, offices and instrumentalities of the National Government, 

including Constitutional Offices enjoying fiscal autonomy and SUCs are mandated 

to close and revert all balances of Special Accounts, Fiduciary or Trust Funds, and 

Revolving Funds to the General Fund in any of the following instances: (i) when 

there is no legal basis for its creation; (ii) when their terms have expired; or                      



70 

 

(iii) when they are no longer necessary for the attainment of the purposes for which 

said funds were established.”  

 

5.3 Verification of the account Cash in Bank-LCCA revealed that trust receipts/cash 
donations amounting to P33,698,120.37 that are deposited in unnecessary bank accounts 

remained to be unremitted to the National Treasury as of report date contrary to the 

abovementioned provisions of law, rules and regulations. Details are as follows:

5.4 The difference between the balances per books and bank includes the bank interest in 
the amount of P16,484.58 earned but was not yet reflected in the books, and the 

remaining difference is still unidentified by the Accounting Division due to non-

preparation of BRS for these accounts. 

 

5.5 The GSTLF accounts under the Cash in Bank–LCCA–Trust Fund was set aside as trust 
by DOE to serve as capital for the establishment and operation of gasoline stations. 

 

5.6 The GSTLF was created under RA No. 8479 known as “Downstream Oil Deregulation 
Act of 1998”. This shall serve as capital for the establishment and operations of gasoline 

stations and shall be administered by the DOE under a separate account. The GSTLF 

amounting to P300 million was earmarked by PAGCOR to DOE as required under 

Section 10 of RA No. 8479. The PAGCOR has already allocated the entire amount of 

P300 million, P60 million of which has been remitted to the DOE, leaving a balance of 

P240 million for release upon liquidation of the previous remittance. 

 

5.7 Interview with the Accounting personnel disclosed that the GSTLF was not yet reverted 
to the National Treasury because they were waiting for the documentary requirement 

from the Oil Industry Management Bureau (OIMB) which was the implementing 

division of the GSTLF. The Management further disclosed that they are experiencing a 

hard time implementing the program due to lack of loan takers because of stringent 

requirements of the Program. The only transactions incurring on these accounts were 

Professional Fees and Broker’s fee. 



71 

 

 

5.8 Moreover, the Typhoon Yolanda Assistance was considered dormant by the bank 
because of no financial activity for two years. 

 

5.9 This is a reiteration of our prior years’ audit observations as reported in the AARs for 
CYs 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019. Currently, these collections are still deposited 

in Authorized Government Depository Bank and treated as a trust fund without 

clearance or authority from the Permanent Committee contrary to the abovementioned 

provisions of the FY 2020 GAA. For CY 2020, the funds in the bank accounts as LCCA 

were still not used for the purpose which they were established, hence, they are 

considered dormant, no longer necessary to be maintained and qualified for closure in 

accordance with Section 10 of the RA No. 11465 and therefore, should be reverted to 

the National Treasury in accordance with EO No. 338, s. 1996, as implemented by COA-

DBM-DOF JC No. 1-97 dated January 2, 1997. 

 

5.10 We recommended and Management agreed to require the concerned Official/s to 
cause the closing of all inactive, dormant, and unnecessary bank accounts and 

deposit the cash proceeds to the Bureau of the Treasury pursuant to Sections 6 and 

10, General Provisions of the GAA FY 2020. 

 

5.11 Management commented that in compliance with COA’s recommendation, the 
Financial Services through the Accounting Division (AD) is now implementing such 

recommendations and has taken the following courses of action: 

 

a. Caused the remittance of the Mirant and Old 2TCF fund in the amount of 
P1,395,298.31 to the BTr. 

b. Coordinated with the OIMB to terminate the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) 
with the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) regarding the Gasoline Station 

Training Loan Fund (GSTL) in the amount of P32,269,829.11 thereby providing 

legal basis to close and declare such fund as no longer necessary for the attainment 

of the purposes for which such fund was established. 

c. Made follow-up with the PMS for the release and validation of the Typhoon Yolanda 
Assistance Fund which is still pending with them since December 2020.  

d. Coordinated with the Administrative Services (AS)-Treasury Division (TD) for the 
reconciliation of the accounts and eventual fund transfer from Fund 101 (Trust Fund) 

to Fund 151. 

 

Late and Non-submission of Bank Reconciliation Statements 

 

6. The Monthly Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS) were not submitted within the 
prescribed period to the Audit Team contrary to Section 7, Chapter 21 of the GAM 

for NGAs Volume 1, thus, preventing timely review of cash transactions and early 

detection of errors, if any. 

 

6.1 Section 3, Chapter 21 of the GAM for NGAs Volume 1 states that the BRS shall be 
prepared in order to: a) check the correctness of both the bank’s and agency’s/entity’s 

records; b) serve as a deterrent to fraud; and c) enable the agency/entity or bank to take 



72 

 

up charges or credits recognized by the bank or agency/entity but not yet known to the 

agency/entity or bank. 

 

6.2 Further, Section 5 of Chapter 21 of the same Manual provides that “the Chief 
Accountant/Designated Staff shall within ten days from receipt of the monthly Bank 

Statement (BS) together with the paid checks, original copies of Debit Memoranda 

(DM)/Credit Memoranda (CM) from the Government Servicing Bank (GSB), reconcile 

the BS with the GL and prepare the BRS in four copies.” 

 

6.3 Moreover, Section 7 of the same Chapter and Manual requires the Chief Accountant to 
submit the BRS within twenty days after receipt of the monthly BS to the following: 

 

Original – COA Auditor (with all the supporting documents and JEVS) 

Copy 2 – Head of Agency/Entity 

Copy 3 – Accounting Division/Unit File 

Copy 4 – Bank, if necessary

6.5 As shown in the table above, the Accounting Division has not submitted the BRS for 

Luzon Field Office from June to December 2020, Mindanao Filed Office from January 

to December 2020, and Typhoon Yolanda Assistance Fund from July to December 2020 

to the Office of the Auditor. Moreover, delays ranging from 1 to 270 days in the 



74 

 

submission of BRS to the Office of the Auditor was incurred by the Accounting 

Division. 

 

6.6 Interview with the concerned personnel revealed that the personnel in-charge of the 
maintenance and safekeeping of BS decided to pick-up the same with the LBP on a 

quarterly basis, thus they incurred delays in the submission of BRS. 

 

6.7 Consequently, the non-observance of prompt and/or timely submission of BRS to the 
Auditor was not only a violation of the above-mentioned provisions of the GAM on 

BRS preparation and reporting but primarily prevented the Audit Team to conduct 

timely review of cash transactions and early detection of errors, if any. 

 

6.8 We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 

a. direct the designated staff at the Accounting Division to make representation 
and/or closely coordinate with LBP for the timely issuance of the monthly BS 

and/or consider availing of the bank’s we-Access online facility to view and 

download or print needed statement to facilitate the preparation of BRS; and 

 

b. immediately submit the monthly BRS to the Office of the Auditor, and 
henceforth, strictly adhere with Section 60 of Chapter 19, and Sections 3, 5 and 

7 of Chapter 21 of the GAM for NGAs Volume 1 for the prompt submission of 

BRS to the Office of the Auditor to facilitate timely audit of cash accounts. 

 

6.9 Management commented that for the Mindanao Field Office, the BRS are being 
submitted to their respective resident COA Auditor and will be required to send the Head 

Office Audit Team with a copy. The BRS of the Luzon Field Office from June to 

December 2020 is now ready for transmittal to AD.   

 

6.10 Management also informed that it will coordinate with its Administrative Services-
Treasury Division (AS-TD) to expedite on-line access to certain bank accounts since the 

physical bank statements take about three (3) months to reach the office while it is also 

cumbersome to sort and file such bank statements even before actual bank reconciliation 

starts. 

 

Dormant Receivable Accounts – P122,162,945.45 

 

7. Long outstanding fund transfers to 88 Implementing Agencies amounting to 
P122,162,945.45 remained unliquidated/unrefunded for 10 to 38 years, hence, 

considered dormant accounts as defined under Sections 5.4 and 5.6 of COA 

Circular No. 2016-005. The dormant accounts imply the inability of the DOE to 

strictly enforce the submission of fund utilization reports on transferred funds and 

the return of any unutilized balance by project implementers pursuant to Sections 

4.6 and 4.9 of COA Circular No. 94-013 as a tool in monitoring completion or 

progress of the projects. 
 



75 

 

 

7.1 Section 63, Chapter 6, GAM for NGAS Volume I provides for the accounting policies 
for the transfer of funds by the Source Agency (SA) to the Implementing Agency (IA) 

covered with Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) for the completion of projects. 

 

7.2 COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 03, 1994 provides for the Rules and 
Regulations in the Grant, Utilization and Liquidation of Funds Transferred to IAs.  

Specifically, Section 4.6 of COA Circular No. 94-013 provides that within 10 days after 

the end of each month or after the end of the project, the IA shall submit to the SA the 

Report of Checks Issued (RCI) and the Report of Disbursements to report the utilization 

of funds or the actual project expenses. The reports shall be approved by the Head of the 

IA. Section 4.9 further requires that the IA shall return to the SA any unused balance 

upon completion of the project. 

 

7.3 Section 6.1 of COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016 provides that – 
“All government entities shall conduct regular monitoring and analysis of receivable 

accounts to ensure that these are collected when these become due and demandable and 

that cash advances and fund transfers are liquidated within the prescribed period 

depending upon their nature and purpose. 

 

7.4 Moreover, COA Circular 2016-005 prescribes the guidelines and procedures in 
reconciling and cleaning of the books of accounts of NGAs, LGUs, and GOCCs of 

dormant receivable accounts, unliquidated cash advances and fund transfers for fair 

presentation of accounts in the financial statements. Item 5.0 of COA Circular No. 2016-

005 provides the definition of the following terms:  

 

5.4.  Dormant Receivable Accounts – accounts which balances that remained inactive 

or non-moving in the books of accounts for ten (10) years or more and where 

settlement /collectability could no longer be ascertained. 

 

5.6  Dormant Unliquidated Fund Transfers – advances granted by the source entity to 

implementing entity for the implementation of programs/projects which remained 

non-moving for ten (10) years or more and where settlement/ collectability could 

no longer be ascertained. 

 

5.9 Write-off of Dormant Accounts – the process of derecognizing the asset account 

and the corresponding allowance for impairment from the books of accounts and 

transferring the same to the Registry of Accounts Written Off (RAWO). This does 

not mean condoning/extinguishing the obligation of the accountable 

officer/debtor. 

 

7.5 Verification and analysis of Inter-Agency Receivables and Other Receivables accounts 
as of December 31, 2020 showed that 88 IAs with 116 fund transfers amounting to 

P122,162,945.45 are inactive in the books of accounts for a period ranging from 10 to 

38 years. The fund transfers have remained unliquidated/unrefunded despite that some 



76 

 

of the projects are already completed, while the others are considered dormant 

unliquidated fund transfers pursuant to COA Circular No. 2016-005. 

 

7.6 Out of the total dormant fund transfers, P17,894,102.73 or 15 percent are outstanding 
for more than 20 years, P63,927,986.78 or 52 percent for 12 to 20 years, while 

P38,287,773.98 or 31 percent and P2,053,082.06 or 2 percent have no available data. 

 

7.7 The issue on dormant fund transfers is a reiteration of prior year’s audit findings. It is 
emphasized that the responsibility to monitor and follow-up with the status of 

implementation of the projects rests with the Management. The inability of Management 

to monitor the status/progress of implementation of the intended projects can be 

attributed as laxity on their part to strictly demand submission of required reports as a 

tool to monitor the projects within the timelines supposedly set in the MOA covering 

each fund transfer. 

 

7.8 The Management informed that there was no MOA or other similar documents on most 
dormant fund transfers; hence, they have no available data that such fund transfer 

occurred.  

 

7.9 In the DOE Agency Action Plan and Status of Implementation (AAPSI) as of December 
31, 2020, management commented that the Financial Service-Office of the Director (FS-

OD) and Accounting Division (AD) have started an initial meeting with GOCCs 

regarding the dormant accounts. Further verification also revealed that the AD is in the 

process of complying with the requirements of dormant accounts as stated in Section 8 

of COA Circular No. 2016-005. As of report date, however, the Management has not 

yet submitted a request for write-off. 

 

7.10 We recommended and Management agreed to require the responsible bureaus/ 
divisions to: 

 

a. coordinate with project implementers for the refund of unliquidated fund 

transfers of completed projects; 

 

b. identify the persons responsible for the existence of dormant accounts and file 

appropriate actions against them, if warranted; and 

 

c. request for the write-off of the dormant accounts by complying with the 
procedural and documentary requirements of COA Circular No. 2016-005.  

 

7.11 We further recommended and Management agreed to direct the responsible 
bureaus in-charge with project implementation and the Accounting Division to 

periodically coordinate on the monitoring and follow-up of periodic liquidation of 

fund transfers of the respective implementing partners as required under COA 

Circular No. 94-013, and for the inclusion in the Semestral Status of Unliquidated 

Fund Transfers the status of outstanding fund transfers.  



77 

 

Delayed submission of the RPCPPE, which is not in the prescribed format and non-renewal of 

Property Acknowledgement Receipt (PAR) 

 

8. The General Services Division incurred a delay of forty-three (43) days in the 
submission of the RPCPPE for CY 2020 to the Audit Team as set under Section 38, 

Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs Volume I. Moreover, deficiencies in the 

submitted RPCPPE were noted and Property Acknowledgement Receipts (PARs) 

were not renewed every three years. 
             

8.1 Section 38, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs Volume I requires every government 
entity to have a periodic physical count of PPE, which shall be done annually and 

presented on the RPCPPE as at December 31 of each year. This shall be submitted to 

the Auditor concerned not later than January 31 of the following year. Equipment found 

at station and losses discovered during the physical count shall be reported to the 

Accounting Division/Unit for proper accounting/recording. 

 

8.2 Relative thereto, the RPCPPE shall be prepared yearly in four (4) copies and shall be 
certified correct by the Inventory Committee Chair and Members, approved by the Head 

of the Agency/Entity or his/her Authorized Representative, and verified by the COA 

Representative. It shall be submitted to the Auditor concerned and Accounting 

Division/Unit not later than January 31 of each year. 

 

8.3 Verification disclosed that the RPCPPE for CY 2020 was submitted only on March 15, 
2021 or 43 days beyond the required date of submission to the Office of the Auditor. 

 

8.4 This audit finding was already reported in the AARs for CYs 2018 and 2019, however, 
the DOE has not yet addressed the issue.  

 

8.5 The RPCPPE is the main document where the actual physical existence of assets 
recorded in the books is affirmed and any losses, transfers, disposals, impairments and 

other information affecting custodianship and actual status of depreciable assets 

discovered during the count are presented and communicated to the Accounting 

Division/Unit for reconciliation and to authorities for appropriate action, such as in cases 

of loses where relief for accountability will be sought. 
 

8.6 Consequently, the late-submission of the RPCPPE has prevented the complete and 
prompt determination on whether all PPE items composing the balances in the books 

are actually existing, unimpaired, presently under the custody of the agency and are 

serviceable as of December 31, 2020. 

 

8.7 Moreover, the following deficiencies in the review of the submitted RPCPPE and PARs 
were noted: 

 

a. The submitted RPCPPE showed that the required signatories were not indicated in 
the report itself but were contained in a separate paper attached to the transmittal 

memorandum on the submission of the RPCPPE. The required signatories for the 



78 

 

“Certified Correct by” of the Chair and Members of the Inventory Committee, the 

“Approved by” of the Head of Agency or its authorized representative.  

 

b. A test verification of the submitted PARs disclosed that issuances of some PPEs 
have no updated PARs acknowledging the receipt of the properties to current and/or 

new end users. This is not in conformity with the instruction in Appendix 71 of the 
GAM for NGAs Volume II, which provides that the PAR shall be renewed every 

three years or every time there is a change in custodianship/user of the property. 

 

8.8 Inquiry with the GSD disclosed that the DOE has no Inventory Committee as of this 
reporting, thus signatories to effect the certified correctness of the report cannot be 

established. The draft Department Order however for the creation of an Inventory 

Committee was already submitted to the Secretary for his review and approval. 

However, to comply with the requirement of COA, the GSD designated the Supply and 

Property Section (SPS) to conduct and prepare the RPCPPE  while still waiting for the 

approval of the DO. 

 

8.9 The GSD also informed the Audit Team that the non-renewal of PAR was attributable 
to the lack of manpower in the Property Section, the frequent lockdowns of DOE offices 

and the implementation of alternative work arrangements during the pandemic. 
 

8.10 The Audit Team acknowledged the ongoing predicament and limitations of the DOE as 
identified. However, it is important that PARs should be updated and maintained as this 

evidences  responsibility of the personnel who has direct custody or possession of the 

properties indicated therein. 
 

8.11 We recommended and Management agreed to require the:  
 

a. Inventory Committee/Chief of GSD to strictly comply with the submission of 
the RPCPPE on or before January 31 of each year to the Office of the Auditor 

as required under Section 38, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs Volume 1; 

 

b. Chief of GSD to strictly comply with the prescribed format of RPCPPE as 
provided under Appendix 73 of the GAM for NGAs Volume II to ensure 

complete capture of significant information; and 

 

c. GSD to expedite the renewal of PARs and ensure that the PAR issued are 
renewed once every three (3) years or every time there is a change in 

custodianship/user of the property to establish the accountability over the 

properties. 
 

8.12 The Management informed that the GSD is in the process of procuring a computer 
program to automate the property inventory management system for easier recording, 

tracking and report generation.

Deficiencies noted in the review of contract covering the Enhanced Energy Virtual One-Stop 

Shop (EVOSS) project  

 

9. The Enhanced Energy Virtual One-Stop Shop (EVOSS) System project disclosed 
(a) delayed completion of the project according to the terms and conditions of the 

contract; (b) the procurement lacks sufficient documentation to comply with the 

conditions of awarding the contract through direct contracting; and (c) other 

deficiencies in the contract documents compromising the propriety, transparency, 

efficiency and economy in the procurement of services worth P34,496,000.00. 
 

9.1 The DOE through the Investment Promotion Office (IPO) developed the Energy Virtual 
One-Shared System (EVOSS) in collaboration with Building Low Emission 

Alternatives to Develop Economic Resilience and Sustainability Project (B-LEADERS) 

project of USAID on December 6, 2016. The B-LEADERS provided the hardware and 

relevant software license for DOE to operate the said EVOSS, on March 8, 2019, RA 

No. 11234 or the Energy Virtual One-Stop Shop (EVOSS) Act of 2018 was enacted and 

approved by the President of the Republic and became effective on March 30, 2019. 

Section 4 paragraph (e) provides that the EVOSS is an online system that allows the 

coordinated submission and synchronous processing of all required data and 

information, and provides a single decision-making portal for actions on applications 

for permits and/or certifications necessary for, or related to, an application of a 

proponent for new power generation, transmission, or distribution projects.” 

 

9.2 The objectives and purposes of this Act is enumerated in Section 2 which provides: (a) 
Ensure the quality, reliability, and security of energy at reasonable cost by undertaking 

measures to guarantee that supply meets demand in a timely manner;  (b) Recognize the 

indispensable role of the private sector in power generation, transmission, and 

distribution by attracting new power generation, transmission, or distribution projects 

through an improved ease of doing business index, and reducing high transaction costs 

associated with copious requisites for proponents; (c) Ensure transparency and 

accountability in the process of approving power generation, transmission, or 

distribution projects; and (d) Deliver efficient and effective service to the public by: (1) 

Ensuring timely completion of power generation, transmission, or distribution projects 

by eliminating duplication, redundancy, and overlapping mandates in documentary 

submissions and processes by supplying an online platform for government agencies to 

coordinate and share information; and (2) Providing a paperless and electronic 

application and processing system which serves as a single gateway through which 

proponents can access all information necessary in the application for a new generation, 

transmission, or distribution project, submit all requirements related to the application, 

and monitor the approval of such application. 

 

9.3 Section 5 of RA No. 11234 also provides that the EVOSS shall be established under the 
supervision of the DOE. The DOE shall operate and maintain an effective information 

technology infrastructure system, which shall be updated regularly. 

 



80 

 

9.4 The amount of One Hundred Million Pesos (P100,000,000.00) for the initial 
implementation of the Act shall be charged against the current year’s  appropriations of 

the DOE and thereafter, such amount as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of 

the Act shall be included in the General Appropriations Act.   

 

9.5 The Contract of Infrastructure Project was entered into by and between the DOE and 
Excent One, Inc., (EOI) on January 10, 2020 for the Procurement of Services for the 

Software Enhancement of the EVOSS System in the total amount of P34,496,000.00, 

awarded using direct contracting modality, which is one of the alternative modes of 

procurement (AMP). 

 

9.6 Results of the Audit Team’s review of the procurement contract on EVOSS System 
disclosed the following observations: 

 

a. Delayed completion/implementation of the Enhanced EVOSS System as provided 
under the terms and conditions of the contract 

 

9.7 Section 3 of the contract provides that – “the customer hereby engages the services of 
the service provider commencing upon receipt of the Notice to Proceed and shall end 

automatically upon the expiration of the period on June 1, 2020.”  

 

9.8 Review and evaluation of the contract for the software enhancement of the old EVOSS 
system revealed that the DOE and the EOI were not able to complete/ implement the 

enhanced EVOSS System on time or seven (7) months beyond the date of expected 

completion of the project as of year-end, which did not conform with the provisions of 

Section 3 of the Contract. 

 

9.9 The Audit Team’s verification of the time lag in the implementation of the enhanced 
EVOSS System can be associated to the following reasons: 

 

a. The Investment Promotion Office (IPO) of the DOE disclosed that the non-
completion/non-implementation of the enhanced EVOSS system was due to the 

non-submission by the other government agencies such as the DOLE, NCIP, DAR, 

ERC, and DENR of the necessary data on streamlined processes that need to be 

incorporated/integrated in the system. 

 

b. The responsible office for the creation of the process flow of each phase of the 
permitting process for every kind of power generation, transmission, or distribution 

project is the EVOSS Steering Committee which shall consist of the Office of the 

President as the Chairperson, the Secretary of the DOE as the Vice-Chairperson, 

and other Cabinet Secretaries as members. Each member has the responsibility to 

submit their own process flows to the steering committee. 

 

c. The DOE and EOI subjected/analyzed/tested the submitted process flows/data into 
several phases to determine whether it is compatible with the system. However, 



81 

 

majority of the submitted data were not compatible with the system thus, they 

returned them to the respective agencies for enhancement. 

 

d. The DOE-IPO is still coordinating with various government agencies involved for 
the submission of the required process flows to speed up the completion of the 

enhanced EVOSS. 

 

e. As of December 31, 2020, the process flows were not yet completed and DOE and 
EOI is  still in the process of gathering, collecting, and testing of data.  

 

9.10 Nonetheless, the IPO submitted to the Office of the Auditor a copy of the written request 
dated March 31, 2021 from the EOI for extension of the contract, but has not provided 

a copy of the extension of  contract with the approval of the DOE as of audit date.  

 

9.11 The Management commented that the project encountered various challenges at the 
early stages of its development, specifically on the consultation for the integration of the 

existing processes of involved national government agencies (NGAs) and the Regional, 

Provincial and Municipal Offices. The depth and scope of the integration requires 

additional time to guide these agencies/offices in streamlining their respective processes 

for energy-related transactions and services. The delay was further aggravated by the 

unexpected constraints in logistics, coordination and operations of the government 

agencies involved in the project. These challenges and constraints have caused delays 

in the first stage of the project's data gathering activities. The data gathering is 

considered as a critical work activity since the output of this activity is necessary for the 

succeeding activities to proceed. 

 

b. The procurement lacks sufficient documentation to comply with the conditions of 
awarding the contract through direct contracting    

 

9.12 Rule 8, Section 1, paragraph (e) of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of 
RA No. 11234 provides the creation of the EVOSS Steering Committee who shall 

develop the terms of reference for the EVOSS developer and/or supplier, which will be 

chosen through public bidding or any other modes of procurement in accordance with 

RA No. 9184.  

 

9.13 Whereas, Section V, Paragraph A No.1, Annex H, of the 2016 Revised IRR of RA No. 
9184 provides that Direct Contracting or single source procurement is a method of 

procurement of goods that does not require elaborate Bidding Documents. The supplier 

is simply asked to submit a price quotation or a pro-forma invoice together with the 

conditions of sale. The offer may be accepted immediately or after some negotiations. 

Direct Contracting may be resorted to under any of the following conditions: 
 

a. Procurement of goods of proprietary nature which can be obtained only from the 
proprietary source, i.e., when patents, trade secrets, and copyrights prohibit others 

from manufacturing the same item; 



82 

 

b. When the procurement of critical components from a specific supplier is a condition 
precedent to hold a contractor to guarantee its project performance, in accordance 

with the provisions of its contract; or 

 

c. Those sold by an exclusive dealer or manufacturer which does not have sub-dealers 
selling at lower prices and for which no suitable substitute can be obtained at more 

advantageous terms to the government. 

 

9.14 To justify the need to procure through the Direct Contracting method, the End-User 
should conduct a survey of the industry and determine the supply source. In all cases 

where Direct Contracting is contemplated, the survey must be conducted prior to the 

commencement of the procurement process. Moreover, the End-User must justify the 

necessity for an item that may only be procured through Direct Contracting, and it must 

be able to prove that there is no suitable substitute in the market that can be obtained at 

more advantageous terms. 
 

9.15 Review of the procurement contract for the Software Enhancement of the EVOSS 
System disclosed that the DOE awarded the said contract using the direct contracting as 

one of the Alternative Modes of Procurements authorized under Rule 8, Section 1, 

paragraph (e) of the IRR of the RA No. 11234. Further evaluation of the awarded 

contract revealed the following observations: 

 

a. There was no provision in the contract that the service provider is the exclusive 
distributor/dealer/manufacturer of the products as required under paragraph c of 

Section V, Paragraph A No.1, Annex H, of the 2016 Revised IRR of RA No. 9184, 

the contract merely states that “the service provider has the necessary technical 

skills, expertise, and experience needed to carry out the required services, and has 

express willingness to perform such services.” 

 

b. The Management was not able to submit the copies of the study/survey done to 
determine that there are no companies selling or offering at lower prices of such 

services, and to justify/prove the necessity of the service that it may only be 

procured through direct contracting, and that there is no suitable substitute in the 

market that can be obtained at more advantageous term as required under Section 

V, Paragraph A No.1 last paragraph, Annex H, of the 2016 Revised IRR of RA No.

9.16 As claimed by Management, they procured the contract of service for the enhancement 
of EVOSS system through direct contracting because their existing IT provider is the 

exclusive distributor/manufacturer of the system and has the proprietary rights over the 

old EVOSS. However, the Management was not able to furnish the Audit Team with a 

copy of certificate that the EOI is the exclusive distributor/manufacturer and has the 

proprietary rights over the old EVOSS system.

c. Other noted deficiencies 
 

9.17 The Audit Team also noted the following deficiencies on the submitted EVOSS contract 
and its contract documents: 

 

Particulars Deficiencies/Observations Applicable Rules and Regulations 

Submission of copy 

of perfected 

contract and 

supporting 

documents  to the 

Office of the 

Auditor 

 

The Enhancement of EVOSS System 

contract was submitted late. It was 

executed and notarized on January 10, 

2020 and submitted to the Office of the 

Auditor only on February 18, 2021 or 

more than one (1) year and one (1) month 

beyond the prescribed period of 

submission. 

Section 3.1.1 of COA Circular No. 

2009-001 dated February 12, 2009 
provides that within five (5) working 

days from the execution of a 

contract, a copy shall be furnished to 

the Auditor of the agency 

concerned. 

 

Submission of other 

documentary 

requirements on the 

contract 

Copies of the following documents were 

not submitted among the documentary 

attachments to the contract: 

 Warranty Security 

 Mayor’s/Business Permit 

 Income/Business Tax Returns – for 
ABC above P500,000.00 

 Tax Clearance

EO No. 398, s.2005 

Signature of the 

Chief Accountant 

as witness to the 

contract.  

The Accountant did not sign as witness to 

the contract but merely signed the 

contract as to availability of funds.  

COA Circular No. 82-122-B dated 

January 18, 1982 requires that the 

Accounting Official shall sign the 

contract as witness. 

 

9.18 The observations on the delayed project completion according to the contract, the 
modality of awarding the contract and on other lacking contract documents 

compromised the propriety, efficiency, economy and transparency of the procurement 

processes. Therefore, there was no assurance that the agency procured the services at 

the most advantageous prices available in the market. Moreover, the intention of the 

enhanced EVOSS System to provide a single decision-making portal for actions on 

applications for permits and/or certifications necessary for, or related to, an application 

of a proponent for new power generation, transmission, or distribution projects has been 

delayed. 
 

9.19 We recommended to the Management to: 
 

a. coordinate with other government agencies to submit the streamlined processes 
pertaining to them to facilitate the completion and implementation of the 

enhanced EVOSS system; 

 

b. submit to the Office of the COA Auditor copy of the following: 
 

i. Certificate of Proprietary Rights and Certificate of Exclusive 
Distributorship of EOI over the old EVOSS system as required under 

Section V, Paragraph A No.1, Annex H, of the 2016 Revised IRR of RA 

No. 9184; 



84 

 

 

ii. result of study/survey done to determine that there are no companies 
selling/offering such services at lower price; the justification/proof of the 

necessity of the services that it may only be procured through direct 

contracting, and that there is no other suitable substitute in the market 

that can be obtained at more advantageous terms as required under 

Section V, Paragraph A No.1 last paragraph, Annex H, of the 2016 

Revised IRR of RA No. 9184; 

 

iii. all other documentary requirements such as Warranty Security, 
Mayor’s/Business Permit, and Tax Clearance of the EOI; and 

 

c. henceforth, ensure adherence to the provisions of Section 3.1.1 of COA Circular 
No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009 on the submission of the perfected 

contract to the Office of the Auditor within five (5) working days from its 

execution, and COA Circular No. 82-122-B dated January 8, 1982 requiring the 

Accounting Official as signatory witness in government contracts. 

 

9.20 Management provided the following comments:  
 

Audit 

Observations 
Management’s Comments Auditor’s Rejoinder 

On awarding of the 

contract through 

direct contracting 

EOI is the software developer and that under 

Item No. 3 of the Software License 

Agreement issued by its CEO, the license is a 

limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable 

perpetual license. It further provides that the 

licensor EOI remains the owner of all titles, 

rights, and interests of the software. This 

provision when liberally interpreted 

expresses the EOI's propriety right over the 

software being the developer of the previous 

EVOSS system. Likewise, having recognized 

that EOI was the software developer of the 

first EVOSS system, it would be difficult to 

find a substitute supplier to develop the 

Enhanced EVOSS system that will be more 

advantageous to the government. 

The Management has not 

submitted the Certificate of 

Proprietary Rights and Certificate 

of Exclusive Distributorship of 

EOI over the old EVOSS system 

and the copies of the study/survey 

results done to determine that there 

are no companies selling/offering 

such services at lower price, and 

the justification/proof of the 

necessity of the services that it 

may only be procured through 

direct contracting, and that there is 

no suitable substitute in the market 

that can be obtained at more 

advantageous terms as required 

under Section V, Paragraph A 

No.1, and last par. of Annex H, of 

the 2016 Revised IRR of RA No. 

9184, respectively. 

 

Late submission of 

copy of perfected 

contract and 

supporting 

documents to the 

Office of the 

Auditor 

To avoid the recurrence of such event, the 

Management has issued the necessary 

Memorandum mandating the PMD as the 

focal unit to submit to COA within five 

working days from its execution the copy of 

contracts and related documents that were 

procured and awarded under RA No. 9184. 

 

This is noted and Management’s 

compliance will be periodically 

evaluated.

Audit 

Observations 
Management’s Comments Auditor’s Rejoinder 

Failure of the Chief 

Accountant to sign 

as witness in the 

contract 

To avoid the recurrence of such event, the 

Management has issued the necessary 

Memorandum for the Chief Accountant to 

sign as witness in contracts. Further, the 

management instructed the BAC Secretariat 

to revise the current contract form to include 

the Chief Accountant to sign as witness in the 

contract. The PMD BAC Secretariat has 

started implementing the said changes in the 

contract form in its May 12, 2021, posting of 

Bid Documents. 

 

This is noted and Management’s 

compliance will be evaluated in 

succeeding contracts. 

Non-submission of 

Warranty 

Certificate, 

Mayor's/Business 

Permit and 

Income/Business 

Tax Returns  

On the submission of Warranty Certificate, 

since the item is classified as a service, the 

Warranty is stipulated in Item No. 7 of the 

Contract, in lieu of the Warranty Certificate. 

For the Mayor's/Business Permit and 

Income/Business Tax Returns however, these 

documents were submitted to the BAC as part 

of the evaluation prior to the award of the 

contract. 

 

The provision in item No. 7 in the 

contract cannot be a substitute for 

the submission of warranty 

certificate as required under 

Sections 54.5 and 62 of the 2016 

RIRR of RA No. 9184, and GPPB 

Resolution No. 30-2017 dated July 

31, 2017. 

 

As of report date, the Management 

still failed to submit the required 

warranty certificate, mayor’s 

permit, business permit, income 

tax returns and business tax. 

  

 

Non-observance of the provisions of the Implementing Guidelines on the Agency-to-Agency 

Agreement 

 

10. The DOE did not observe the provisions of Paragraphs 5 and 6 relative to the 
procedural requirements of the Implementing Guidelines on the Agency-to-Agency 

Agreement issued by the GPPB, and RA No. 9184 and the 2016 RIRR on its 

procurement of the Digital Transformation Enterprise Content Management 

(ECM) with Business Process Management project worth P18,135,000.00, thus, 

there was no assurance that the agency procured the services at the most 

advantageous price available in the market. 
 

10.1 Paragraph 5 of the Implementing Guidelines on Agency-to-Agency Agreements, Annex 
A of GPPB Resolution No. 18-2017 in relation to Negotiated Procurement under Section 

53 (e) of the 2016 Revised IRR of RA No. 9184 provides that – “Agency-to-Agency 

Agreements may only be resorted to if the following conditions are complied with: (i) 

Conduct of a Cost-Benefit-Analysis by the Procuring Agency indicating that entering 

into an Agency-to-Agency Agreement with the Servicing Agency is more efficient and 

economical for the government.” 

 

 



86 

 

10.2 Paragraph 6 of the same Implementing Guidelines on Agency-to-Agency Agreements, 
also prescribes the following procedures: 

 

a. The end-user unit shall undertake a Cost-Benefit-Analysis, taking into 
consideration the following factors: (i) prevailing standard cost for the project in 

the market, (ii) absorptive capacity of the Servicing Agency, and (iii) such other 

factors. 

b. It shall likewise secure a certificate from the relevant officer of the Servicing 
Agency that the latter complies with all the conditions prescribed under Section 5 

(a) and (b). 

c. Based on the assessment and recommendation of the end-user unit, the BAC shall 
issue a resolution recommending the use of Agency-to-Agency Agreement to the 

head of the Procuring Agency.  

d. Upon approval of the BAC resolution, the Procuring Agency shall enter into a 
Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with the Servicing Agency. 

 

10.3 On January 8, 2018, the DOE entered into a Memorandum of Agreement with the 
Philippine International Trading Corporation (PITC) for the procurement of the Digital 

Transformation Enterprise Content Management System (ECM) through the Agency-

to-Agency alternative mode of procurement. The Management accordingly engaged the 

services of PITC because of its vast portfolio and expertise in outsourcing and providing 

procurement services for highly technical software applications and that they have the 

capability to assess and evaluate the complex technical proposal of the bidders. 

 

10.4 The ECM will enable the DOE to save time and cost associated with managing 
documents, improve workflows by allowing automation of routine task, allow easy 

access, management and monitoring on information and data, increase document 

security control, eliminate duplication of files and outdated information, reduce storage 

and paper requirements from moving to electronic format, prevent loss of documents 

and eliminate bottleneck in document processing, and ensure compliance with 

government regulatory requirements and policies. 

 

10.5 In line with the MOA, the DOE transferred funds in the amount of P17,357,867.54 (net 
of applicable service fee and value added tax) on January 9, 2020 to PITC for the ECM 

procurement, of which,  the full amount remained outstanding as of December 31, 2020. 

   

10.6 Verification disclosed that the DOE did not submit the Cost-Benefit-Analysis to justify 
that entering into an Agency-to-Agency Agreement with the Servicing Agency-PITC on 

its procurement of the Digital Transformation ECM with Business Process Management 

project worth P18,135,000.00 is more efficient and economical for the government than 

to conduct a regular public bidding as provided in paragraph 5 of the General Conditions 

of the Implementing Guidelines on Agency-to-agency Agreements, Negotiated 

Procurement of the GPPB and Section V par. D sub-par. 5(c)(i) of Annex H of the 2016 

Revised IRR of RA No. 9184. 
 

10.7 Further verification of the documents submitted by DOE revealed that the MOA 
between the DOE and PITC and the Notice of Award (NOA) was signed and notarized 



87 

 

on January 08, 2018 and December 28, 2018, respectively, while the BAC Resolution 

No. 494 s. 2018 was signed only on December 28, 2018 or almost one (1) year after the 

signing of the MOA. This violates paragraph 6 (d) of the Procedural Requirements of 

the Implementing Guidelines on Agency-to-Agency Agreement, Annex A of GPPB 

Resolution No. 18-2017 which provides that the Agency shall enter into a MOA upon 

or after the approval of the BAC resolution. 

 

10.8 In this case, the DOE already approved the MOA with PITC more than eleven months 
ahead of the approval of the BAC resolution recommending the award of the contract 

through the use of alternative method of procurement or Agency-to-Agency, and the 

issuance of notice of award. 

 

10.9 In view of the aforesaid deficiencies, there was no assurance that the agency procured 
the services at the most advantageous price available in the market. 

 

10.10 We recommended that Management: 
 

a. submit to the Office of the Auditor a copy of the cost-benefit-analysis done 
taking into consideration the factors to justify that the Agency-to-Agency 

procurement is more efficient and economical for the government as required 

under paragraph 5 of the General Conditions of the Implementing Guidelines 

on Agency-to-Agency Agreements, Negotiated Procurement of the GPPB, and 

Section V par. D sub-par. 5(c)(i) of Annex H of the 2016 Revised Implementing 

Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA No. 9184; 

 

b. approve and sign the MOA only upon the approval/issuance of the BAC 
Resolution and NOA as required under Paragraph 6 (d) of the Procedural 

Requirements of the Implementing Guidelines on Agency-to-Agency 

Agreement, Negotiated Procurement of the GPPB, and Section V par. D sub-

par. 5(c)(iv) of Annex H of the 2016 Revised Implementing Rules and 

Regulations (IRR) of RA No. 9184; and 

 

c. ensure that future similar transactions must be compliant with the pertinent 
rules and regulations. 

 

10.11 Management replied that they agree that as per GPPB paragraph 5 of the general 
conditions of the implementing guidelines of the Agency-to-Agency mode of 

procurement, the conduct of the cost benefit analysis is required to determine whether 

engaging other government agency as Servicing Agency is more efficient and 

economical as compared to procuring the same requirement through a private supplier 

or other source. However, for this specific case, the engagement of PITC is not for the 

supply of goods and services, consultancy, or infrastructure for DOE but for the conduct 

of procurement for the DOE requirement through competitive bidding.  

 

10.12 The DOE has engaged PITC considering its vast portfolio and expertise in outsourcing 
and providing procurement services for highly technical software applications. PITC 

technical experts have provided valuable input in the preparation of the project's terms 



88 

 

of reference and specifications. The DOE is also expecting that the same experts will be 

needed to assess and evaluate the very complex technical proposal of the bidders. The 

enhanced TOR, specification and proper evaluation and assessment of technical bid 

proposal will ensure that the DOE will get the best value for money and will be able to 

engage a highly capable supplier to develop the DOE ECM. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

10.13 The Audit Team maintains that based on the Implementing Guidelines on Agency-to-
Agency Agreements, Annex A of GPPB Resolution No. 18-2017 in relation to 

Negotiated Procurement under Section 53 (e) of the 2016 Revised IRR of RA No. 9184, 

the submission of Cost-Benefit-Analysis is mandatory/pre-requisite before the end-user 

may enter into an Agency-to-Agency procurement and to justify that entering into an 

Agency-to-Agency Agreement with the Servicing Agency is more efficient and 

economical for the government.

of Women (MCW) and its 

Implementing Rules and 

Regulations (IRR) which 

mandates all government 

instrumentalities to adopt gender 

mainstreaming as a strategy for 

implementing the law and 

attaining its objectives. One of the 

institutional mechanisms for 

gender mainstreaming prescribed 

by the law is the development and 

maintenance of a GAD database 

containing gender statistics and 

sex-disaggregated data. In this 

regard, all government agencies 

were enjoined to regularly collect 

and generate sex-disaggregated 

data and statistics in support of the 

MCW indicators relevant to their 

agency. Such data shall be stored 

and maintained in the agency's 

GAD database or similar system, 

updated as needed, and used in 

policy and program development 

to address gender issues in their 

respective sectors, particularly in 

the preparation of their annual 

GAD plans and budgets and 

accomplishment reports. 

 

program development in addressing 

gender issues in the agency.  

 

According to Management, the EPPB 

has already drafted a statistical policy 

framework for the data collection, 

processing, analysis, generation of 

reports and dissemination of SDD-GDD 

for the DOE only. However, this is now 

currently being revised and enhanced to 

include the generation of SDD-GDD of 

the DOE attached Agencies to have a 

complete picture of the energy sector. 

 

Part of the draft policy framework is the 

creation of a Technical Working Group 

(TWG) for each agency and an Energy 

Family TWG which shall ensure 

implementation of activities relative to 

generation of SDD-GDD based on the 

established statistical policy framework 

of the DOE and as required under PCW

Circular No. 2014-05 is 

established so that planned 

activities relating thereto are 

fully implemented  and 

thereby the budgeted

well; and 

 

 

 

Annex A of PCW-NEDA-DBM-

JC No. 2012-01 states that to be 

able to impute the cost of gender 

mainstreaming in a flagship or 

regular program of an agency, it 

may assess the program or project 

using the Harmonized GAD 

Guidelines (HGDG). The program 

or project should be assessed at 

two levels: (1) the design of the 

project or program, using the 

original/revised design 

documents; and (2) at the 

project/program implementation, 

management, and monitoring and 

evaluation (PIMME). 

The Harmonized GAD Guidelines 

(HGDG) tool was not utilized in 

evaluating CY 2020 DOE P/A/Ps for 

attribution to GAD Plans and Budget 

(GPB) and AR for CY 2020. 

 

Management said that GAD-FPS, in 

coordination with the DOE-Project 

Review Committee (PRC) had required 

all the Locally Funded Projects (LFP) to 

comply with the ten (10) elements of a 

gender-responsive project, and to use 

the HGDG Tool: Energy Checklist or

of the SCs and PWDs.  

 

However, none of the eight (8) activities 

were fully implemented.  Two activities 

were partially implemented  and six 

activities were not implemented at all.  

 

Moreover, the accuracy of the reported 

cost of P25,000.00 incurred to date for 

the construction of ramp/ walk-way 

could not be adequately validated due to 

non-disclosure and/or non-submission 

of detailed expenses. 

 

Management regret that they have not 

fully implemented the CY 2020 Plans 

and Programs for the SCs and PWDs. 

The year 2020 had indeed been a 

challenging year due to the COVID-19 

pandemic which caused the 

implementation of community 

lockdowns, restricted transportation, 

and limited face-to-face gatherings. 

This further caused the deferment of the 

implementation of various activities and 

programs, including the activities lined-

up for SCs and PWDs under the Energy 

Safety Practices and Efficiency 

Measures (ESPEM), among others. 

 

Management, however, further assured 

the Audit Team with greater hope that in 

CY 2021, they will strive to implement 

all the proposed Plans and Programs to 

provide more outputs in the AR. 

 

a. direct the Administrative 
Service to always include in 

the accomplishment report,  

sufficient details of expenses 

(i.e. vendor name, document 

reference no. such as, official 

receipt, billing, 

disbursement voucher or 

liquidation report no. and 

document date, 

corresponding cost, etc.), in 

addition to the reported 

actual cost of 

implementation of the SCs 

and PWDs 

programs/projects/ 

activities, for reference in 

audit; 

 

b. formulate more plans, 
programs and activities 

within the mandated 

functions of DOE which will 

address the concerns of both 

the SCs and PWDs, both 

internally and externally; 

and 
 

c. utilize alternative ways to

Compliance with Tax Laws 

Revenue Regulation No. 1- 2013 

and DOF-DBM-COA Joint 

Circular No. 1-2000, as amended 

by Joint Circular No. 1-2000A 

dated July 31, 2001 provides that 

the filing of return and payment of 

tax due should be on or before the 

10th day following the month in 

which the withholding was made, 

except for taxes withheld for the 

month of December of each year, 

which shall be filed on or before 

January 15 of the succeeding year. 

 

DOE was compliant on the timely 

remittance of taxes withheld on 

compensation and withholding from 

various suppliers in CY 2020 except in 

March when the entire Luzon was 

placed in strict Enhanced Community 

Quarantine due to worldwide pandemic.  

 
However, the book balance of Due to 
BIR accounts are doubtful due to 

unreconciled difference of 

P12,894,244.53 between the general 

ledger and the Summary Report of 

Deductions and Remittance.  

We recommended and the Chief 

Accountant agreed to exert extra 

effort to reconcile prior years’ 

difference.

Recommendation 

  

The Accounting Division strictly 

adhered to BIR Regulation No 1-2013. 

As a result of timing difference between 

actual date of remittance and posting of 

transactions in the General Ledger, 

there is a noted difference in the ending 

balance of Due to BIR account. The 

necessary adjusting entries will be 

prepared, if any, to correct the account 

balance in the books and to update SL 

as needed. 

 

Compliance with Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) Law 

RA No. 8291, Rule III provides the 

following: 

 

Section 11.1 – The rate of 

contribution payable by the 

member and government agency 

shall be 9% and 12% respectively, 

based on the actual monthly salary 

of the member. 

 

Section 14.1 – Each government 

agency shall remit directly to the 

GSIS the employees’ and 

government agency’s contribution 

within the first ten (10) days of the 

calendar month following the 

month to which the contributions 

apply. 

 

DOE substantially complied with the 

pertinent provisions of RA No. 8291 or 

the GSIS Act of 1997 on the timely 

remittance of life/retirement premium 

contributions for personal share (PS), 

and loans amortizations deducted from 

DOE employees’ payroll totalled to 

P80,694,533.33 in CY 2020.   

 

Of the total contributions and loan 

amortizations, P59,155,662.31 was 

remitted to GSIS and P14,550,942.54 

was refunded to DOE employees due to 

moratorium imposed on all loans, 

leaving a balance of P6,987,928.48 as of 

December 31, 2020. 

 

However, the book balance of Due to 
GSIS accounts are doubtful due to 

unreconciled difference of 

P7,532,604.84 between the general 

ledger and the Summary Report of 

Deductions and Remittance.  

 

The deductions and remittances are in 

accordance with RA No. 8291. Much as 

Management would like to remit the 

exact amount as deducted from the 

officers and employees, however, GSIS 

accept remittance/payments based on 

their generated billing statements, hence 

there is a discrepancy between the Due 

to GSIS account and Summary Report 

of Deductions and Remittances.  

 

GSIS records can only be updated 

and/or adjusted through Agency 

Remittance Advice (ARA) which shall 

We recommended and the Chief 

Accountant agreed to: 

 

a. immediately remit the 
unremitted amount of GSIS 

premiums to GSIS; 

 

b. maintain and update each 
employee’s Subsidiary 

Ledger; and 

 

c. exert extra effort to reconcile 
the unreconciled difference.

Compliance with Property Insurance Law 

RA No. 656 otherwise known as 

the “Property Insurance Law”, as 

amended by P.D. No. 245 

established the Property Insurance 

Fund and required every 

government, except municipal 

government below first class, to 

insure its properties with the Fund 

against any insurable risk. 

 

Executive Order No. 33 was issued 

directing all heads of government 

agencies and their subsidiaries to 

secure from General Insurance 

Fund, directly, all insurances or 

bonds covering properties, 

contracts, rights of action and 

other insurable risks and all those 

in which they have an insurable 

interest only. 

 

COA Circular No. 92-390 was 

issued directing all head of the 

agencies to be responsible for the 

preparation and submission of the 

inventory of all insurable physical 

assets using the format prescribed 

therein. Under the said circular, 

the latest inventory report, 

preferably as of December 31, 

shall be submitted not later than 

October 31 of the ensuring year. 

 

DOE failed to comply with the 

provisions of RA No. 656 otherwise 

known as the “Property Insurance Law”  

due to delayed renewal of property 

insurance against all risks with the 

General Insurance Fund of GSIS of 

some insurable properties which 

resulted in a gap of 10 days to 130 days 

in the insurance coverage, leaving the 

government unprotected against any 

damage to, or loss of, its properties due 

to casualties or force majeure. 

 

Moreover, the Management failed to 

secure an insurance policy   for several 

donated motor vehicles due to non-

transfer of ownership from the 

contractors to DOE. 

 

The GSD has been complying the 

provisions of the Property Insurance 

Law under R.A. 656, E.O. No. 33, and 

COA-Circular No. 92-390 in ensuring 

that all properties of DOE are covered 

by insurance and having renewed it 

annually based on schedule period, to 

indemnify or compensate the 

Government for any damage to, or loss 

of, its properties due to fire, earthquake, 

storm, or other casualty. 

 

The GSD to prepare a memorandum to 

all Bureau and Services reiterating the 

necessary documents for the service 

contractor to prepare during 

transfer/donation of property 

specifically service vehicle to the 

ownership of DOE and information to 

GSD when there are activities for its 

participation during inspection and 

process of the said transfer/donation to 

avoid same occurrence in the future. 

 

 

We recommended and  

Management agreed to instruct 

GSD to: 

 

a. strictly comply with the 
provisions of the property 

insurance under RA No. 656, 

EO No. 33, and COA-

Circular No. 92-390, thereby 

ensuring that all insurable 

properties were fully covered 

with insurance policy and 

henceforth apply for the 

renewal of insurance policy 

at least one month before the 

expiration of the policy to 

ensure that there is no gap in 

the insurance coverage; and 

 

b. coordinate with the 
contractors to submit the 

necessary documents to 

facilitate the transfer of 

ownership of donated 

properties to DOE such as 

the (a) original copy of Deed 

of Donation (DOD), (b) 

original copy of Certificate of 

Registration (CR), (c) 

original copy of latest 

Official Receipt (OR), (d) 

original copy of Deed of Sale 

(DOS), and (e) other 

documents required by the 

LTO.

Recommendation 

Compliance with Home Development Mutual Fund Law 

RA No. 9679 provides that: 

 

Section 1, Rule VI - Employees 

and employers shall contribute to 

the Fund based on the monthly 

compensation of covered 

employees. 

 

Section 3, Rule VII – each 

government agency shall remit 

directly to the Pag-IBIG the 

employees’ and government 

agency’s contribution within the 

first 15 days of the calendar month 

following the month to which the 

contributions apply. 

 

During CY 2020, DOE’s remittances of 

Pag-IBIG Fund contributions totalling 

P4,937,103.75 showed that the agency 

has substantially complied the law.  

 

However, the contributions from March 

to May 2020 were remitted only on 

November 2020 due the declaration of 

the Enhanced Community Quarantine 

(ECQ) because of the COVID-19 

pandemic. 

   
Management claims that the deductions 

and remittances were in accordance 

with HDMF Law RA No. 7742 and RA 

No. 9679. However, the premium 

contributions from March to May 2020 

were remitted only in November 2020 

by the Treasury Division (TD) because 

of the ECQ and adequate working 

arrangements   were not yet in place. 

 

However, the Audit Team argued that 

the ECQ was already lifted on May 31, 

2020, and the work in the government 

already resumed on June 1, 2020, thus, 

the remittance made in November 2020 

for the premiums from March to May 

2020 were considered delayed. 

 

We recommended and the Chief 

Accountant agreed to pay 

remittances on time to avoid 

penalties and to comply with the 

payment/ remittance schedule 

set forth under Paragraph E of 

HDMF Circular No. 275 dated 

January 22, 2010. 

 

 

Compliance with Philippine Health Insurance Law 

PhilHealth Circular No. 0001 s. 

2014 provides that employers with 

PhilHealth Employer Number 

(PEN) ending in 0-4 will remit 

every 11th – 15th day of the month 

following the applicable period 

and employers with PEN ending in 

5-9 will remit every 16th – 20th 

day of the month following the 

applicable period. 

Analysis, verification and reconciliation 

of account Due to PhilHealth showed 

that in CY 2020, DOE withheld a total 

of P6,890,768.29 from salaries of its 

officers and employees representing 

personal shares in PhilHealth 

contributions, P5,106,129.71 of which 

was remitted in CY 2020 leaving an 

unremitted balance of P1,784,638.58 as 

of December 31, 2020. 

 

DOE also incurred delays ranging from 

30 days to 100 days in the remittance of 

PhilHealth premium contribution in CY 

2020. The number of days of delay was 

computed based on the prescribed 

payment schedule of every 11th to 15th 

day of the month following the 

applicable period as DOE’s PEN ends in 

4 pursuant to PhilHealth Circular No. 

We recommended and 

Management agreed to direct 

the Accountant to:  

 

a. remit the PhilHealth 
premium contributions on 

time as mandated by RA No. 

10606 and PhilHealth 

Circular No. 0001 s. 2014; 

and 

 

b. reconcile the difference of 
P878,232.33.

Moreover, the Audit Team noted an 

unreconciled difference of P878,232.33 

per GL and Summary Remittance 

Report submitted by Management. 

 

According to Management, the amounts 

of monthly contributions and 

remittances were in accordance with
