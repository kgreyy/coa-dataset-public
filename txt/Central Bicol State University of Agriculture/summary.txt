Independent Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements



The Auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the financial statements for Calendar Year 2020 due of the following audit observations:



1)	Non-reconciliation of CBSUA Main Campus’ PPE account balances between the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) and General Ledger (GL) resulted in the unreconciled net variance of ₱106.03 million as at December 31, 2020, thereby, affecting the reliability and fair presentation of the account in the financial statements.



2)	The accuracy/correctness of the balances of the Cash in Bank–Local Currency, Current Account (CIB-LCCA) of the University as at December 31, 2020 amounting to ₱151.44 million could not be ascertained in view of the material discrepancies of  ₱23.89 million between the book and bank records and ₱25.49 million compared to the subsidiary ledgers due to the inability of the Accounting Office to prepare and update  the Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS) and the non-reconciliation of the balances between the General and Subsidiary Ledgers.



3)	The balance of the Inventory accounts of CBSUA Main Campus in the aggregate amount of ₱8.94 million as of December 31, 2020 was unreliable due to the material variance between the Accounting and Property records amounting to ₱5.75 million and various deficiencies noted, thus, accuracy, reliability and existence of the inventory accounts as presented in the financial statements cannot be ascertained.



4)	The recorded Accounts Payable of CBSUA Main Campus for CY 2020 amounting to ₱55.68 million did not reconcile with the balance of the unpaid obligations under due and demandable in the Financial Accountability Reports (FARs) of ₱34.35 million as of December 31, 2020, disclosing a material difference of ₱21.34 million, thus, rendering the balance of the Accounts Payable at year-end unreliable.





Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations



For the exceptions mentioned earlier, the Auditor recommended that Management:



1.a. Require the Inventory Committee to expedite the preparation and submission of the RPCPPE and Inventory and Inspection Report for Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) for CY 2020, with the RCPPE for CY 2019 as basis/starting report to come up with the CY 2020 RPCPPE, and as required in the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs) Volume I; and



b. Require the Accounting and Supply Offices to maintain complete and updated PPELCs and PCs, respectively, and conduct reconciliation of their property records in order to ensure accuracy, reliability and correctness of the accounts balances as presented in the Financial Statements.



2.a. Designate an Accountant to take charge and focus on the immediate reconciliation of the book and bank transactions and items due for reconciliation and update the preparation of the BRS for all the Cash in Bank-LCCA accounts;



b. Instruct the Accountant to prepare Journal Entry Voucher (JEV) for any book   reconciling items noted that need adjustment; and



c.  Submit to the Audit Team complete and updated monthly BRS for each bank accounts together with copies of bank statements, paid checks, debit or credit memos and other pertinent documents, for review and verification.



3.a. Require the Accounting and Supply Unit to check, verify and/or investigate the noted differences. Look into the source documents to determine possible errors in their records and trace the discrepancies and effect the necessary adjustment on the affected inventory accounts; 



b. Require the Accounting Unit to expedite the recording (from 2017 to 2020) of the issued inventories per RSMIs submitted by the Supply Office. Also, to prepare and maintain updated SLCs and religiously conduct periodic reconciliation with the controlling accounts in the financial statements; 

c. Require the Supply Office to reclassify the inventory items erroneously recorded in the RPCI as Office Supplies and Other Office Supplies to the appropriate Semi-Expendable Inventory Accounts. Also, include in the inventory Report the unaccounted Construction and Hardware Materials; and 



d. Require the Supply Office to reconcile the RPCI with the SCs as well as with the SLCs maintained by the Accounting Office. Any discrepancy shall also be verified and /or adjusted accordingly.



1)	Require the Accountant to review and reconcile the amounts of recorded expenditures, disbursements and accounts payable with the budget records to present accurate and reliable information in the financial accountability reports.



Henceforth, the Accounting and Budget Units to religiously conduct reconciliation of their recorded information in the Budget and Financial Accountability Reports.





Moreover, the following are the other notable observations and recommendations: 



1)	Cash advances totaling ₱7.08 million which remained unliquidated at year-end were unreliable due to unreconciled difference of ₱18,183 between the Subsidiary Ledgers (SLs) and General Ledger (GL) balances and the existence of a negative balance of ₱102,715 under Advances for Payroll account. Moreover, inadequate internal control was noted on the granting, utilization and liquidation of cash advances. 



We recommended that the Management: 



a)	Require the Accountable Officers to immediately liquidate their cash advances and strictly follow the prescribed period of liquidation pursuant to COA Circular No. 97-002; 



b)	Instruct all campus Accountants to prepare and issue demand letter to concerned AOs with unliquidated cash advances, ensure that all cash advances are fully liquidated at year-end and cause the withholding of the concerned AO's salary in case of non-liquidation of his/her cash advance after the receipt of the demand letter;



c)	Instruct the Management of Sipocot Campus to stop the granting of cash advances to SDO for the payment of salaries, bonuses and other remuneration to permanent, casual and JOs, COS employees of the University. Instead, payment to all personnel shall be made through Advice to Debit Account (ADA);



d)	Direct the JOs and COS of Sipocot Campus to open bank account and secure an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) card with Landbank of the Philippines. Utilize the same for the payment of accounts payable due to them by way of issuance of Advice to Debit Account (ADA); 



e)	Require the Sipocot Campus Accountant to reconcile the unidentified balances which were outstanding for over one year already and prepare adjusting entries, if necessary; and



f)	Require the Main Campus Accountant to reconcile the difference between the SL and GL balances as at year end, review the records of cash advances and their liquidations to locate the cause of negative balance and prepare necessary adjusting entry to eliminate the unreconciled difference and the negative balance of the accounts.



2)	Receivable from the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) for payment of tuition fees and other school fees under the Free Higher Education (FHE) Program of CBSUA Main Campus amounting to ₱35.32 million was erroneously recorded as Accounts Receivable instead of Due from NGAs account, contrary to Chapter 3 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume III, resulting in the overstatement and understatement of both accounts, respectively, thus, affecting the fair presentation thereof in the Statement of Financial Position.



We recommended that Management instruct the Accountant to take the following courses of action:



a)	Use the proper account Due from NGAs in recording the receivables of tuition fees and other fees from student under the FHE program, which are collected from CHED in accordance with the Revised Chart (Updated 2019); and



b)	Make the necessary adjusting entries to correct the balances of both the Accounts Receivable and Due from NGAs accounts.



3)	Inadequate monitoring and inability of the CBSUA Main Campus’ Office of the Students Affairs and Services (OSAS) to effectively enforce the terms and conditions of the loan agreements under the various student loan programs of the CHED resulted in long outstanding receivable balance totaling ₱6.70 million as of December 31, 2020, thus, the program’s objective of providing loans continuously to the students was not fully achieved.



We recommended that the Management: 

	

a)	Require the OSAS to retrieve the pertinent documents supporting the receivables from students’ loans particularly the MOA/loan agreements on various loan grants to ensure the correctness of the recorded balance in the books; 

b)	Require the OSAS to set up an effective monitoring system to keep track of the whereabouts of the student grantees who have already graduated or are gainfully employed; 

c)	Require the Credit Officer to intensify the collection of due and demandable accounts by issuance of demand letters to student borrowers and to the co-makers in case of refusal or failure of student borrowers to settle their liabilities, in order to have adequate funds for relending to financially needy students; and 

d)	Require the Accountant to reconcile the Loans Receivable-Others balance per schedule and that of the balance reported in the SFP to have fair presentation of the account in the financial statements.

e)	If the settlement/collectability of the loans receivable can no longer be ascertained, the Head of the Agency may file a request for authority to write-off Loans Receivable - Others accounts to the Commission on Audit thru the COA Audit Team Leader and/or Supervising Auditor, supported with the documents enumerated in Section 8.3 of COA Circular No. 2016-005.



4)	The inability of Management to immediately file claims against the Bonding Company that issued the Performance and Advance Payment Surety bonds and the inability to exercise all remedies against the contractor whose contract was terminated due to abandonment of contract works, may result in loss of government fund thru non-recovery of the Performance Security in the amount of ₱1.90 million and unrecouped advance payment in the amount of ₱0.65 million, contrary to the Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA No. 9184.



We recommended that Management to continue to assert its claim against the bonding company to recover the performance security posted by the contractor including the surety bond for the unrecouped portion of the advance payment to avoid possible loss of government fund. Management is also enjoined to strictly enforce other sanctions/remedies available under the above-stated regulation to protect the interest of the government and to forestall the happening of the same incident in the future.



5)	CBSUA Sipocot and Calabanga Campuses did not impose liquidated damages totaling ₱170,009 to the suppliers who were not able to deliver the goods on time. Moreover, some Purchase Orders of Calabanga Campus did not indicate the date of delivery and/or date of receipt by the suppliers, hence, determination of the delays in delivery could not be established and application of liquidated damages could not be imposed, contrary to Item 3 Annex D of the 2016 IRR of RA No. 9184 and Appendix 61 (Purchase Order - Instructions) of the GAM for NGAs, Volume II.



We recommended that the Management: 



a)	Ensure that all POs are properly filled up, indicate the date of delivery and/or properly acknowledged by the supplier with the date of receipt to easily determine the delay in delivery; 



b)	Follow the instructions in accomplishing the PO as provided in Appendix 61 (Purchase Order - Instructions) of the GAM for NGAs Volume II; and 



c)	Impose liquidated damages to all suppliers who were unable to deliver on time, in accordance with Item 3 Annex D of 2016 IRR of RA No. 9184. 



6)		Disbursements relative to the procurement of goods and infrastructure projects amounting to ₱32.78 million were not adequately supported with the required documents, contrary to the Revised IRR of RA No. 9184 and COA Circular No. 2012-001, hence, propriety of the procurement process and regularity of the payments made thereof could not be ascertained. 



We recommended that Management submit the lacking documents of the related disbursements presented in Annex P. Henceforth, ensure that all succeeding disbursements are supported with complete documentation in accordance with the Revised IRR of RA No. 9184 and COA Circular No. 2012-001.



7)	The grant of cash incentive under the Programs on Awards and Incentives for Service Excellence (PRAISE) to its employees amounting to ₱8.23 million was not in accordance with its implementing guidelines. 



We recommended that Management require the three casual employees from Pasacao Campus and two employees from Research Service Personnel to refund the excess/incentives received amounting to ₱90,000. 



Likewise, submission of the following documents is required to facilitate audit disposition; otherwise, this warrant the issuance of Notice of Suspension/Disallowance:



a)	Proof that there were available savings from Personnel Services of the General Appropriations Act in FY 2020; 



b)		  Valid justification on the utilization of Fund 164 instead of GAA for the payment of said incentive, and; 

		

c)	Supporting documents on the achievement of targets as shown on the PREXC. 



8)	Disbursements relative to the payment of Collective Negotiation Agreement (CNA) to CBSUA Pili and Pasacao Campuses’ employees amounting to ₱7.55 million were not adequately supported with the required documents, contrary to COA Circular No. 2012-001.



We recommended that Management submit the lacking documents of the disbursements made. Henceforth, ensure that all succeeding disbursements are supported with complete documentation in accordance with COA Circular No. 2012-001 to avoid possible suspension/disallowance of the transaction.



9)	The University granted monthly communication allowance of ₱2,000 to each of the members of the Board of Regents and the Board Secretary amounting to ₱214,000 in CY 2020, without legal basis.



We recommended that Management refrain from granting/paying communication allowance and other similar benefits to the members of the Board of Regents and the Board Secretary unless there is a specific law or authority thereof. Also, require said officials to refund subject allowance paid to them in CY 2020.



10)	Payment of BAC honoraria to BAC Members, Secretariat and Technical Working Group (TWG) amounting to ₱188,800 was not in compliance with DBM Budget Circular 2004-5A as amended by DBM Circular No. 2007-03.



We recommended that the Management stop the aforementioned practices and strictly adhere with the guidelines on granting BAC honoraria as stipulated in DBM Budget Circular No. 2004-5A as amended by DBM Circular 2007-03 to avoid possible disallowance in audit.
