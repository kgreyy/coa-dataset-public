The Agency’s inability to submit the said accounts within the prescribed period as required under existing laws and regulations precluded the Audit Team from timely determination of the validity, propriety and regularity of the transactions pertaining thereto and reliability and correctness of the year-end balances of the affected accounts in the financial statements cannot be ascertained.



We recommended that Management submit immediately to the Audit Team all the remaining unsubmitted DVs for CY 2020 totaling 1,283 DVs and strictly adhere with the timelines on the submission of the accounts pursuant to the existing COA rules and regulations.



Management Comment:



During the exit conference, the President promised to cause the immediate submission of the accounts for CY 2020.  Likewise, the University Accountant justified that the causes of the delay on the submission of accounts were due to the voluminous transactions at the Accounting Office, overlapping duties of accounting staff and lack of manpower.



For Sipocot Campus, the Accountant agreed to comply with the recommendations.  She informed the Audit Team that 62 DVs amounting to ₱ 12.83 million were already submitted as of April 19, 2021.



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



We appreciate Management for their positive action on our recommendations.  However, we emphasize on the timely submission of the accounts and other reports to facilitate the conduct of audit thereof.  



We acknowledged receipt of the submitted DVs, however, the same will still be for audit by the Audit Team.



2)		The balances of the Cash in Bank-Local Currency, Current Account (CIB-LCCA) of CBSUA-Main Campus as at December 31, 2020 in the total amount of ₱151.44 million differed from the balances per bank by ₱23.89 million and had a variance of ₱25.49 million compared to the subsidiary ledgers.



Section 111 of PD No. 1445 on keeping of accounts provides:



1)	The accounts of an agency shall be kept in such detail as is necessary to meet the needs of the agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or control agencies of the government.



2)	The highest standards of honesty, objectivity and consistency shall be observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate or misleading information.

	

Section 123 of the same decree defines internal control as the plan of organization and all the coordinate methods and measures adopted within an organization or agency to safeguard its assets, check the accuracy and reliability of its accounting data, and encourage adherence to prescribed managerial policies.



Further, Section 124 of the same law provides that it shall be the direct responsibility of the agency head to install, implement, and monitor a sound system of internal control.



Also, Section 5, Chapter 21 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I, on the preparation of Bank Reconciliation Statement (BRS) provides that the Chief Accountant/Designated Staff shall within ten days from receipt of the monthly Bank Statement (BS) together with the paid checks, original copies of Debit Memoranda (DM)/Credit Memoranda (CM) from the GSB, reconcile the BS with the GL and prepare the BRS in four copies and distributed as follows:



Original – COA Auditor (with all the supporting documents and JEVs)

Copy 2 – Head of Agency/Entity

Copy 3 – Accounting Division/Unit file

Copy 4 – Bank, if necessary



Section 12, Chapter 2 of the same manual provides for the books of accounts and registries of the National Government entities, which consist of, among others, the General Ledgers (GL) (Appendix 5) and the Subsidiary Ledgers (SL) (Appendix 6). The GL, as described under Volume II of the same manual, summarizes all transactions recorded in the General Journal (GJ) and special journals (e.g. CRJ, CDJ, CkDJ, etc.) maintained in the Accounting Unit/Division. Controlling accounts in the GL shall be supported by details in the SLs. Meanwhile, the SL shows detail for each controlling account in the GL which is maintained per account and fund cluster by the Accounting Unit/Division. The total of the SL balances shall be reconciled with the corresponding GL controlling account.



Verification of the financial statements of University’s Main Campus disclosed that as of December 31, 2020, the account Cash in Bank-LCCA has a balance of ₱151.44 million broken down as follows:

Our audit showed that the University has 21 Cash in Bank accounts. Confirmations were made with the depository banks, namely, Land Bank of the Philippines, Pili Branch (16 accounts), and Development Bank of the Philippines, Naga Branch (5 accounts) to ascertain the accuracy of the booked-up amounts of the CIB-LCAA as of December 31, 2020. However, results of the bank confirmation showed a material discrepancy in the total amount of ₱23.89 million as the total confirmed bank balance amounted to ₱175.34 million while the total recorded amount by the University amounted to ₱151.44 million.

The noted discrepancy could not be identified and determined by the Audit Team due to the absence of updated bank reconciliation statements. The non-preparation of updated BRS had been a perennial observation reported by the Audit Team in the prior years’ audit reports. Despite Management’s assurance that the preparation of BRS will be prioritized, still we find that the effort of the University fell short to efficiently reconcile book and bank balance for its 21 bank accounts up to this time.



Inquiry with the Accountant revealed that the BRSs for some bank accounts were already prepared up to June 30, 2020, however, they were not yet printed, hence, were not yet submitted as of this writing.



Furthermore, the audit disclosed that the balance of the CIB-LCCA account per GL was not reconciled with the SLs balances which disclosed a total variance of ₱25.49 million, computed as follows:

Bank reconciliation is a form of internal control over cash. When done on a monthly basis, this measure is expected to provide reliable and accurate financial information on cash in bank balance as the latter is reconciled with the balance in the bank statement.



The inability of the Accounting Unit/Division to prepare the updated BRS and to reconcile the balances of the accounts between the GL/SLs has rendered the CIB-LCCA balance in the financial statements as at December 31, 2020 in the amount of ₱151.44 unreliable.





We reiterated our prior years’ recommendations that Management:



	a)	Designate an Accountant to take charge and focus on the immediate reconciliation of the book and bank transactions and items due for reconciliation and update the preparation of the BRS for all the Cash in Bank-LCCA accounts;



	b)	Instruct the Accountant to prepare Journal Entry Voucher (JEV) for any book reconciling items noted that need adjustment; and



	c)	Submit to the Audit Team complete and updated monthly BRS for each bank accounts together with copies of bank statements, paid checks, debit or credit memos and other pertinent documents, for review and verification.



Management Comment:



Management was amenable with our recommendations.  They justified that the cause of the variance is due to unrecorded reconciling items that pertain to previous years as well as adjustments during the year.  Also, the delay in the preparation and submission of BRS is attributable to the delay of the banks to transmit the Bank Statements.



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



The BRS is an effective tool to ensure that bank balances agree with book balances, if not timely prepared and submitted for review, then, errors or items for adjustment cannot be corrected or adjusted in the books, thus, may affect the fair presentation of the Cash in Bank accounts in the financial statements. Also, snap shots of the bank transactions can be easily secured/taken from the banks which can be the basis in the conduct of bank reconciliation.





1)	The Cashier was not able to present an updated cashbook on cash advances and Report of Accountability for Accountable Forms (RAAF) during the course of the cash examination. 



Section 122 of PD No. 1445 states:



Section 122. Submission of reports. Whenever deemed necessary in the exigencies of the service, the Commission may under regulations issued by it require the agency heads, chief accountants, budget officers, cashiers, disbursing officers, administrative or personnel officers, and other responsible officials of the various agencies to submit trial balances, physical inventory reports, current plantilla of personnel, and such other reports as may be necessary for the exercise of its functions.



(2) Failure on the part of the officials concerned to submit the documents and reports mentioned herein shall automatically cause the suspension of payment of their salaries until they shall have complied with the requirements of the Commission.



(3) No appropriation authorized in the General Appropriations Act shall be available to pay the salary or any official or employee who violates the provisions of this section, without prejudice to any disciplinary action that may be instituted against such official or employee.



Item No. 7, Chapter 2 of the Revised Cash Examination Manual provides that: 



7. An AO shall maintain his cashbook/CRR/CDR/CkDR20 and such other records or their equivalents as may be prescribed by the agency’s operating procedures, and reconcile with the accounting records at least quarterly21, unless the agency requires a more frequent reconciliation.



Section 17, Chapter 6 of GAM for NGAs Volume I also states that:



Sec. 17. Accounting Books, Records, Forms and Reports to be Prepared and Maintained. The Disbursing Officer shall maintain the Cash Disbursements Record (CDRec) (Appendix 40) to monitor the cash advances/payroll, current operating expenses, and special purpose/time-bound undertakings and prepare the Report of Cash Disbursements (RCDisb) (Appendix 41) to report its utilization. Payments shall be based on duly approved Payroll and shall be posted by the Designated Staff to the IP. The JEV shall be prepared based on the RD and shall be recorded in the CDJ.



Furthermore, Section 17, Chapter 8 of GAM for NGAs Volume I states that:



Sec. 17. Records, Forms and Reports to be prepared and/or maintained. The following records, forms and reports are prescribed for use:



k. Report of Accountability for Accountable Forms (RAAF) (Appendix 67) – shall be prepared by the Accountable Officer to report on the movement and status of accountable forms in his/her possession. The accountable forms include those with or without face value.



The Audit Team conducted a cash examination on the cash and accounts of the CBSUA-Main Campus’ Cashier on October 13, 2020. The cash examination aims to determine whether all government funds in the hands of the Accountable Officer (AO) are actually existing and properly accounted for; the Agency and its AOs are adhering strictly to prescribed rules and regulations on cash transactions; and the Agency’s practices and procedures provide adequate safeguards against fraud and losses of government funds. Thus, aside from demanding her to produce all her cash, checks, money orders, cash items, paid vouchers, and unused accountable forms, etc. for which she is accountable for as Cashier, and any fund, checks and/or cash items in her possession held by her for deposit and safekeeping, we also required her to submit her cashbooks and all the records and reports essential for the Audit Team to be able to determine her accountability as of the date of the cash examination.



As of this writing, the Cashier has not submitted yet her updated cashbook on cash advances, when it is the responsibility of an accountable officer to maintain her cashbook/CRR/CDR/CkDr and reconcile with the Accounting records at least quarterly. Likewise, the latest submitted RAAF was for the month of June, 2020. The Cashier averred that she is on the process of updating her cashbook and the RAAF has not been updated ever since the person who has been maintaining it severed her employment with CBSUA.



The practice of the Cashier in not updating her cashbooks and reports is not in accordance with the afore-mentioned rules and regulations. It may also manifest the inability of the accountable officer to efficiently perform the responsibility vital to her position. Also, it deters the Audit Team from promptly determining the Cashier’s accountability and finalizing the on-going cash examination.



Timely and complete submission of accounts is a condition precedent to audit and examination. Unless and until these reports are fully and completely submitted to the Audit Team and subsequently examined, the existence, propriety and validity of the Cashier’s accountability cannot be ascertained.



We recommended that Management require the Cashier to submit as soon as possible her updated Cashbook/Cash Disbursements Record on cash advances and updated monthly RAAFs to this Audit Team.



We recommended further that Management direct the Cashier to strictly comply with the rules and regulations mandated by the GAM for NGAs and religiously update and maintain Cashbooks and Reports that are under her responsibility as an Accountable Officer.



Management Comment:



The Cashier, in her reply letter dated February 4, 2021, explained that the delay in the submission of an updated cashbook and the MRAAF was due to the sudden transfer of one of her staff to another agency, man hours lost because of the two consecutive lockdown of the office due to COVID-19 and corrupted e-files.  However, she affirmed to comply with our recommendations.



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



We understand the predicament of the Cashier, however, we would like to emphasize the need to maintain an updated cashbook and reports so that her accountability can be determined without any difficulty and to avoid suspicions regarding her accountability.   The AO should revisit her mandated responsibility and fulfill it religiously. 

2)	The details under the “Particulars” column of the Subsidiary Ledger for the Cashier’s cash advances for Funds 101 and 164 were not provided, thus, causing difficulty in the determination of the Cashier’s correct accountability.



Section 111 of PD No. 1445 on the keeping of accounts states:



1)	The accounts of an agency shall be kept in such detail as is necessary to meet the needs of the agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or control agencies of the government.



2)	The highest standards of honesty, objectivity and consistency shall be observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate or misleading information.



GAM for NGAs Volume II, on the other hand, provides for instructions on how to properly fill-out the Subsidiary Ledger (Appendix 6). For the “Particulars” column, it shall contain other information or details pertaining to the transaction.



To determine the actual cash accountability of the Cashier, balances of the cashbooks and SLs must be compared and discrepancies must be reconciled. This, however, was made difficult because the SLs for the Cashier’s cash advances for Funds 101 and 164 contain very limited details and essential information were not indicated under the particulars column to be understandable. The following table shows an example of the entries taken from the subject SLs:

The excerpt shows that the particulars column only indicates check number (and sometimes DV number) when a cash advance was made, DV number when a liquidation was made and OR number and DV number when a refund was made. 



The Audit Team finds it difficult to ascertain as to which cash advance is being liquidated or being refunded because of the very limited information contained under the particulars column. The Audit Team needed to exert extra time and effort in interpreting and monitoring every cash advance and liquidation/refund made hampering the finalization of the cash examination. 



One qualitative characteristic of financial reporting is understandability. A financial report must be comprehensible to a user with reasonable knowledge of the entity’s activities and the environment in which it operates. To achieve this, PD No. 1445 requires that the accounts of an agency shall be kept in such detail as is necessary to meet the needs of the agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or control agencies of the government. 



GAM for NGAs Volume II also provided for the instructions in correctly filling out the Subsidiary Ledger Format.



We recommended that Management require the Accountant to accomplish the Subsidiary Ledgers following the instructions provided by the GAM for NGAs Volume II (Appendix 6) and with the guidance of the provisions of PD No. 1445 to make them more understandable to users.



Management Comment:



Management, in the letter reply dated March 24, 2021 avowed to comply with the recommendation.





3)	Pertinent rules and regulations on cash advances are continually not being complied with, causing a total unliquidated amount of ₱0.65 million as of cash examination date.



Section 89 of PD No. 1445 states that no cash advance shall be given unless for a legally authorized specific purpose. A cash advance shall be reported on and liquidated as the purpose for which it was given has been served. No additional shall be allowed to any official or employee unless the previous cash advance given to him is first settled or a proper accounting thereof is made.



Also, pertinent provisions under COA Circular No. 97-002 states that:



Section 4.1.6 Transfer of cash advance from one Accountable Officer (AO) to another shall not be allowed.



xxx



Section 5.1 – The AO shall liquidate his cash advance as follows:



5.1.1 Salaries, wages, etc. – within five (5) days after each fifteen (15) day/end of the month pay period.



5.1.2 Petty Operating Expenses and Field Operating Expenses – within twenty (20) days after the end of the year; subject to replenishment as frequently as necessary during the year.



5.1.3 Official Travel – within sixty (60) days after the return to the Philippines in the case of foreign travel or within thirty (30) days after the return to his permanent official station in the case of local travel as provided for in EO 248 and COA Circular No. 96-004.



Failure of the AO to liquidate his cash advance within the prescribed period shall constitute a valid cause for the withholding of his salary and the institution of other sanctions as provided for under paragraphs 9.2 and 9.3 hereof.



Xxx



5.8 All cash advances shall be fully liquidated at the end of each year. Except for petty cash fund, the AO shall refund any unexpended balance to the Cashier/Collecting Officer who will issue the necessary official receipt.



This is a reiteration of an audit observation from the previous cash examination.

Review of the cash advances granted to the AO in the total amount of ₱0.78 million disclosed that 83 per cent thereof remained unliquidated ranging from 228 days to 585 days as of October 13, 2020. The table above also revealed that cash advances were not liquidated within the prescribed period even if the purposes thereof have already been served. It is noteworthy to mention that items 1 to 4 were part of the unliquidated cash advances during the cash examination conducted last September 2019 but remained unliquidated as of October 13, 2020. Moreover, the AO was allowed and granted additional/new cash advances even though her previous cash advances were not yet settled/liquidated.



The same explanation as the previous audit observation was averred by the AO which is the delay in the liquidation was because some cash advances granted to her for some school activities and Board of Regents meetings were transferred to other employees of the University who are in-charge of the activities and that she is still waiting for the liquidation papers to be submitted.



Further, the transfer of cash advance from one AO to another is specifically prohibited by the aforementioned rules and regulations. In this case, the AO shall be held accountable and responsible for any loss and/or misuse of the cash advances illegally transferred to other officials/employees.



We also noted that of the total credits to accountability of ₱1.81 million (see Annex A) for cash advances under Fund 101, ₱108,660 or six per cent of which was cash refund with notable six staggered cash settlements for cash advance granted on March 8, 2019. Similarly, for Fund 164, of the total ₱0.69 million (see Annex B) credits to accountability, ₱143,059 or 20 per cent thereof was cash refund. Moreover, it is very notable from Annexes A and B that the cash refunds were not made on the same dates the liquidation reports are submitted. This indicates that the amount of cash advance granted was more than what is actually needed for the intended activity/project or was not at all needed which may lead to misuse of government funds.



The above practices are contrary to Section 89 of PD No. 1445 and pertinent provisions of COA Circular No. 97-002, dated February 10, 1997 and a clear indication of Management’s disregard of the existing laws, rules and regulations governing the grant, utilization and liquidation of cash advances resulting in accumulation of unliquidated cash advances amounting to ₱0.65 million. The holding of such amount for extended period will only expose government funds to unnecessary risk of loss and/or misuse.



We recommended that Management enforce the proper granting and liquidation of cash advances by requiring the Accounting Office to strictly implement the existing pertinent rules and regulations. Also, stop the practice of granting additional cash advance to the Cashier if she still has existing unliquidated cash advances.



Moreover, we recommended that the Cashier immediately settle/liquidate the total unliquidated cash advances of ₱0.65 million and refund/deposit the unspent balances of the cash advances already due for liquidation and refrain from transferring cash advances to other officers/personnel.



Management Comment:



During the exit conference, Management had agreed to comply with the recommendation. Likewise, in the letter reply of the Cashier dated March 12, 2021, she submitted the matrix of cash advances and liquidation showing that the balance of her cash advances as of October 13, 2020 were fully liquidated as of March 4, 2021. She promised to coordinate with the Accounting Unit relative to the grant, use and liquidation of her cash advances.





Auditors Rejoinder:



We stand firm that there is a need to comply with existing rules and regulations on the grant, utilization and liquidation of cash advances to avoid the possible loss and/or misuse of government funds.  



	

4)	Cash advances totaling ₱7.08 million which remained unliquidated at year-end were unreliable due to unreconciled difference of ₱18,183 between the SLs and GL balances and the existence of a negative balance of ₱102,715 under Advances for Payroll account. Moreover, inadequate internal control was noted on the granting, utilization and liquidation of cash advances. 



Section 5 of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 provides that: 



“5.7. When a cash advance is no longer needed or has not been used for a period of two (2) months, it must be returned to or refunded immediately to the collecting officer. 

 5.8. All cash advances shall be fully liquidated at the end of each year. Except for petty cash fund, the AO shall refund any unexpended balance to the Cashier/Collecting Officer who will issue the necessary official receipt. 

 5.9. At the start of an ensuing year, a new cash advance may be granted, provided that a list of expenses against the previous cash advance is submitted. However, when no liquidation of the previous cash advance is received on or before January 20, the Accountant shall cause the withholding of the AO's salary.”

Also, Section 124 of PD No. 1445 and Department of Budget and Management (DBM) Circular Letter No. 2008-08 dated October 23, 2008, pertaining to the adoption of National Guidelines on Internal Control System (NGICS), provides that the direct responsibility for installing, implementing and monitoring a sound system of internal control rest with the head of the agency. It can strengthen accountability, ensure ethical, economical, efficient and effective operations, improve quality and quantity of outputs and enable agencies to better respond to the requirements of the public they serve. 



Moreover, DBM issued Circular Letter No. 2013-16, as updated by DBM Circular Letter No. 2018-14, provides updated guidelines in the implementation of the Modified Direct Payment Scheme (MDPS) Due to Creditors/Payees of All National Government Agencies (NGAs). This Circular specifically mandates all NGAs to pay using the Advice to Debit Account (ADA) to creditors/payees.



As defined in the said circular, Creditors/payees refer to internal and external creditors/payees of the NGA/OU, as enumerated but not limited to the following: 



5.4.1 Internal creditors/payees, enumerated but not limited to the following: 



5.4.1.1 Employees of the department or agency; 

xxx



 5.4.1.7 Others, such as: 

xxx

- Service providers, such as janitorial, security services, contracted services 



Appendix 6 of the GAM for NGAs Volume II provides the instructions about the Subsidiary Ledgers (SLs), to wit:

a)	This ledger shows detail for each control account in the GL which is maintained per account and fund cluster by the Accounting Division/Unit. 



b)	xxx 



c)	At the end of each month, after all transactions in the journals have been posted, the debit and credit columns of each account shall be footed in pencil and the balance indicated in ink. The totals of the SL balances shall be reconciled with the corresponding GL controlling account. 



d)	At the end of the fiscal year, each SL shall be ruled and closed. All totals shall be written legibly in ink and the balance of the account carried forward as the opening balance of the new SL for the next fiscal year.



Verification of the cash advances accounts of CBSUA revealed that a total amount of ₱7.08 million remained unliquidated as of December 31, 2020, contrary to the above- mentioned regulations that all cash advances shall be fully liquidated at year end.  The details are presented below:

The aging of the unliquidated cash advances of Sipocot Campus and Calabanga Campus is shown in Annexes C and D, respectively.

Perusal of the details of these accounts revealed that:

	

For Main Campus



a)	The balance of Advances to Officers and Employees pertains to the unsettled cash advances granted to University personnel for their traveling allowance for foreign and local travel, registration fee for several seminars and/or trainings, and thesis/dissertation and book allowance. 



b)	Outstanding cash advances granted to Special Disbursing Officers (including Advances for Operating Expense and Payroll) were for various expenses pertaining to ISO Audit, University accreditation, payment for e-book subscription to EBSCO International, post-typhoon expenses and prizes for winners during the leadership webinar conducted by the University. 



For Calabanga Campus



c)	Among the unliquidated cash advances of ₱ 331,239, the cash advance amounting to ₱133,005 has been outstanding for almost nine months already as this was granted on March 3, 2020 for the costume, props and set design for five stage plays of SALIKHA Project supposedly scheduled in January to July 2020. However, due to the restrictions brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic the activity was not carried out, hence, this could have been returned/liquidated by the AO immediately.



For Sipocot Campus



d)	The balance of Advances for Payroll aged less than 30 days pertains to cash advances granted on December 23, 28 and 29, 2020 for the payment of Service Recognition Incentive (SRI) of regular and casual employees, salary of University Management Information System (UMIS) Contract of Service (COS), additional five per cent and ₱20 premium of COS and Job Orders (JOs), salary of part-time teachers in College of Criminology, incentive for faculty who assisted in the extension programs of the University, honoraria of Graduate Studies’ faculty, and Productivity and Self- Development Incentives (PRAISE) of permanent and casual employees. 



Analysis of the transactions under this account revealed that salary, bonuses and other remuneration of permanent, casual, JO, and COS employees of the University were being cash advanced and manually distributed by the SDO on a monthly or bi-monthly basis. Further verification showed that for CY 2020, a total of ₱15.36 million was granted to the SDO as cash advance for the said transactions, ranging from ₱4,000 to ₱1.90 million (Annex E).



Consequently, huge amount of cash is being handled by the SDO from these advances. This practice contravenes with sound internal control system, therefore, exposed the government fund to high risk of loss and/or misapplication. Likewise, it defeated the purpose of DBM Circular Letter No 2018-14, which directs all NGAs to pay its creditors/payees using ADA. The same also entails unnecessary effort on the part of the SDO on manually counting and distributing cash to the payees, and liquidating said cash advances. 



It was learned that some of the employees, particularly the JOs and COs, have no bank account with the Land Bank of the Philippines. 



e)		The balance on Advances to Special Disbursing Officer aged less than 30 days was the cash advances for the expenses for Technology Transfer Meat Processing activity, and Community Outreach granted on December 15 and 22, respectively. 

	

f)		Cash advances aged 31 days to 365 days under Advances to Officers and Employees account were granted for thesis and dissertation allowances of several employees of the University which remained unsettled by concerned personnel. 

	

g)		The total unliquidated amount of ₱163,789 outstanding for over 1 year pertains to unidentified balances, thus, liquidation thereof is remote. 

	

Under the above-mentioned rules and regulations, as soon as the purpose for which the cash advance was granted and has been served or it has not been used for a period of two months, the AO must liquidate the amount and refund any excess or unused balance thereof. Besides, the abovementioned regulation requires full settlement of cash advance at the end of the year.



The abovementioned practice contravenes with the rules and regulations on the granting, utilization, and liquidation of cash advances and exposes the government funds to possible risk of loss and/or misuse if money is kept by the AOs for an extended period of time.



For Main Campus:



	The submitted Statement of Financial Position as at December 31, 2020 of CBSUA Main Campus disclosed that the balance of cash advances accounts totaled to ₱2.34 million. However, verification of the balances against its SLs showed that there was an unreconciled difference totaling to ₱18,183 in the Advances for Payroll and Advances to Special Disbursing Officers accounts. Details are presented below:

Analysis of the records disclosed that the beginning balance of the Advances to Special Disbursing Officers account per SL amounted only to ₱37,992 compared to the GL balance of ₱75,146, hence, the difference of ₱37,154. 



Likewise, the beginning balances of Advances to Payroll account per SL and GL were ₱2,175 and negative balance of ₱163,999, respectively, or a difference of negative ₱166,174. Further scrutiny also revealed that in June 2020, liquidation totaling to ₱119,437 was recorded in the SL but only ₱8,600 was recorded in the GL, thus, an under recording of liquidation amounting to ₱110,837. 



	Moreover, further examination revealed that the Advances for Operating Expenses and Advances for Payroll accounts has an existing negative balance as of September 2020 in Fund 163 and as of December 2020 in Fund 164, respectively, as shown on the following table:

Accordingly, these negative balances were due to: (a)erroneous posting; (b) cash advance directly recorded as expense but subsequent liquidation was credited on the cash advance account; (c.) over-liquidation as in the case of one of the SDOs, and; (d.) not all cash advances in the prior years were recorded due to non-maintenance of SL and proper records, hence, some liquidation reports submitted during the year but pertaining to prior years’ transactions have no corresponding cash advance recorded in the books. 



Due to the preceding circumstances, the balances of the cash advances accounts recorded in the financial statements as of year-end were unreliable.



We recommended that Management: 

a)	Require the AOs to immediately liquidate their cash advances and strictly follow the prescribed period of liquidation pursuant to COA Circular No. 97-002;



b)	Instruct all campus Accountants to prepare and issue demand letter to concerned AOs with unliquidated cash advances, ensure that all cash advances are fully liquidated at year-end and cause the withholding of the concerned AO's salary in case of non-liquidation of his/her cash advance after the receipt of the demand letter;



c)	Instruct the Management of Sipocot Campus to stop the granting of cash advances to SDO for the payment of salaries, bonuses and other remuneration to permanent, casual and JOs, COS employees of the University. Instead, payment to all personnel shall be made through Advice to Debit Account (ADA);



d)	Direct the JOs and COS of Sipocot Campus to open bank account and secure an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) card with Landbank of the Philippines. Utilize the same for the payment of accounts payable due to them by way of issuance of ADA;



e)	Require the Sipocot Campus Accountant to reconcile the unidentified balances which were outstanding for over one year already and prepare adjusting entries, if necessary; and



f)	Require the Main Campus Accountant to reconcile the difference between the SL and GL balances as at year end, review the records of cash advances and their liquidations to locate the cause of negative balance and prepare necessary adjusting entry to eliminate the unreconciled difference and the negative balance of the accounts.



Management Comment:



Management was amenable with our recommendations.



The Campus Accountant of CBSUA-Calabanga Campus averred that the unliquidated cash advances as of December 31, 2020 were fully liquidated on March 5, 2021.



Management of CBSUA-Sipocot, in their letter reply to AOM 2021-001(2020) dated March 19, 2021, justified that the cash advances granted to SDO for various purposes amounting to ₱3.86 million were already liquidated.  Likewise, a Memorandum was already issued by the Campus Administrator requiring the concerned personnel to open bank account and apply for an ATM with LBP to facilitate payment of their claims.





5)	Receivable from the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) for payment of tuition fees and other school fees under the Free Higher Education (FHE) Program of CBSUA Main Campus amounting to ₱35.32 million was erroneously recorded as Accounts Receivable instead of Due from National Government Agencies (NGAs) account.



COA Circular No. 2020-001 dated January 8, 2020 prescribes the Revised Chart of Accounts (Updated 2019) to replace Volume III-The Revised Chart of Accounts (Updated 2015) of the GAM for NGAs, Volume III. It defines, among others, the following:



a)	Accounts Receivable- This account is debited to recognize the amount due from customers arising from regular trade and business transactions. This account is credited upon collection, transfers, write-off, and/or adjustments of receivables.



b)	Due from National Government Agencies- This account is debited to recognize advances for purchase of goods/services as authorized by law, fund transfers to the NGAs for implementation of projects and other receivables from NGAs. This account is credited upon receipt of goods/services, and liquidation of fund transfers, receipt of payment, settlement, write-off, and/or adjustments.



CBSUA is eligible to provide the Free Higher Education (FHE) program as stated under Section 5 of the Implementing Rules and Regulation (IRR) of Republic Act (RA) No. 10931. The benefits include among others, free tuition for all courses/subject/classes enrolled during a particular semester, and free miscellaneous, other school and related fees.



The IRR further provides that State Universities and Colleges (SUCs) shall bill the CHED every semester based on actual qualified students who availed the FHE program.



The financial statements of CBSUA Main Campus as of December 31, 2020 disclosed that the Accounts Receivable has a balance of ₱99.48 million. However, examination of the entries made in the GL of the Accounts Receivable disclosed that the amount includes receivables from CHED for payment of tuition fees and other school fees of student-beneficiaries under the FHE program of the National Government for 1stsemester AY 2020-2021 in the total amount of ₱35.32 million (details shown in Annex F). The receivables were from the Pili and Pasacao Campuses amounting to ₱28.50 million and ₱6.81 million, respectively. Said amount should have been debited to the Due from NGAs account instead of the Accounts Receivable account in accordance with the afore cited rules and regulations. As a result, Accounts Receivables account was overstated and the Due from NGAs account was understated in the amount of ₱35.32 million.



The accounting personnel in charge in the preparation of the JEV for billing and collection of the FHE program explained that they usually record the assessment for tuition and other fees of students as Accounts Receivables.



The improper classification made pertaining to the recognition of the receivables is not in conformity with the Revised Chart of Accounts and may mislead the users of the University’s financial report as it does not reflect the true nature of the affected asset accounts. Although these accounts are considered asset accounts under Receivables, it is still necessary that the accounts used be in accordance with the descriptions in the Revised Chart of Accounts for proper classification of the transactions in the financial statements.



We recommended that Management instruct the Accountant to take the following courses of action:



a)	Use the proper account Due from NGAs in recording the receivables of tuition and other fees from student under the FHE program, which are collected from CHED in accordance with the Revised Chart of Accounts (Updated 2019); and



b)	Make the necessary adjusting entries to correct the balances of both the Accounts Receivable and Due from NGAs accounts.



Management Comment:



In the letter reply of Management dated March 24, 2021, they assured the Audit Team that they will comply with the recommendation during the year.  





6)	Inadequate monitoring and inability of the CBSUA Main Campus’ Office of the Students Affairs and Services (OSAS) to effectively enforce the terms and conditions of the loan agreements under the various student loan programs of the CHED resulted in long outstanding receivable balance totaling ₱6.70 million as of December 31, 2020.



The Loans Receivable-Others account of the University’s Main Campus, as reflected in the Statement of Financial Position as at December 31, 2020, showed a balance of ₱6.70 million. The amount pertains to loan assistance to students under the various programs of CHED. However, review of the schedule of Loans Receivable-Others showed that the unpaid loans amounted to ₱6.44 million or a difference of ₱255,952 as against the Loans Receivable-Others reflected in the SFP amounting to ₱6.70 million as of December 31, 2020. The breakdown of the Loans Receivables-Others per schedule is shown below:

₱  6,816,000.00



To determine the effectiveness and accomplishment of program objectives, the Audit Team conducted an analysis of these accounts, viz: 



1)	Student Assistance Fund for Education (SAFE) for Loan 



CHED Memorandum No. 25, series of 2008 stipulates the guidelines for the implementation of SAFE for loan program. This program caters to students in financial need who are in their 3rd, 4th, 5th or graduating year of study. The loan grant may be used for tuition and other school fees, books and course projects, thesis writing, board and lodging, graduation fees and other valid related educational expenses. Qualified loan grantees can borrow as much as Eight Thousand Pesos (₱8,000.00), depending on individual circumstances and requirements. The loans granted to students shall be interest free and will be paid within two to five years after graduation. 



Item IX of the same memorandum also provides the duties and responsibilities involved in the implementation and administration of the program. 



	B. Participating Higher Education Institution-shall perform the following:



xxx

ii. Treat the fund transferred from CHED Regional Office as Revolving Fund to expand the number of beneficiaries of the SAFE Loan Program;

xxx 

v. Draw corresponding duly notarized promissory note for repayment within 2 to 5 years after graduation, duly signed by the student borrower when grant of loan is awarded;

xxx

viii. Maintain separate accounting records for the program that will be subjected to periodic monitoring by CHED and/or COA Audit Teams; 

xxx

	x. Assist CHEDRO to monitor or track the whereabouts of the scholars after graduation in order that the latter properly comply with their obligation to refund the loan at the intended period of repayment; 

	xxx



The reports from the Office of the OSAS, showed that the University was able to release the amount of ₱1.37 million from SAFE loan program to 206 qualified students. Out of the 206 grantees, 21 had paid their loans amounting to ₱325,616. As of December 31, 2020, the unpaid loans receivable balances of ₱1.04 million pertain to 185 student beneficiaries which remain outstanding for almost 11 years. 



2)	 Student Financial Assistance Program (STUFAP) 



CHED Memorandum Order No. 4 series of 2004 provided the guidelines for the implementation of the STUFAP. The program caters to financially needy 3rd, 4th and graduating students. The student loan can be used for tuition and other school fees, books and course projects, thesis writing, board and lodging, graduation fees and other valid educational expense. 



Item IV of the same memorandum provides the duties, functions and responsibilities involved in the implementation and administration of the program. This section enumerates the functions of the participating higher education institution such as entering into loan agreement and keeping of separate accounting records subject to periodic inspectorial visit by CHED finance personnel and/or COA resident auditor, among others. 



Further, Item VII states that Qualified borrowers may be allowed to borrow a maximum of ₱8,000.00 per semester xxx.



--	Loans below ₱4,000.00 are payable within five years.

--	Loans above ₱4,001.00 are payable within ten years.



Item VI (e) of the Memorandum provided further that applicants for the STUFAP must have a co-borrower either his/her parents, his/her relatives or any person who is a GSIS/SSS member. 



As one of the participating higher education institutions qualified for the grant of STUPAF loans, the University had released loans to 607 qualified students amounting to ₱2.33 million from CYs 2002 to 2008. Perusal of the records also showed that there were 54 students who had paid their loans amounting to ₱200,500. The balance of ₱2.13 million represents unpaid loans of 553 student grantees. Similar with the SAFE loan program, the loan receivables were outstanding for 16 years already.



3)	Student Loan Fund (SLF) 



Report on the monitoring of the implementation of SLF of the University as of December 31, 2019, submitted to the Regional Director, CHED Regional Office No. V by the Education Program Specialist (EPS) of CHED disclose the following conditions and qualifications for the SLF of the University: 



xxx

IV. Loanable Amount 



Qualified students were able to borrow from ₱1,000.00 to ₱5,000.00 per semester for tuition and other school fees. 



V. Mode of Payment and Interest Rate 



	a)		The loan is payable in 10 equal parts at six per cent per annum interest. 

a)	The loan grantee will pay the loan immediately after the end of the semester if there is a failing grade in the enrolled subject. 

b)	The loan grantee will pay the total amount on instalment basis two years after graduation if she/he maintained 100 percent passing in all the enrolled subject until graduation. 



Records revealed that the University released the total amount of ₱3.92 million to 411 students who availed of the Student Loan Fund (SLF). The collections amounted to ₱0.66 million, leaving an outstanding balance of ₱3.26 million representing unpaid loans of 342 student grantees of the SLF which remained unpaid for 20 years already. 



Inquiry with the Accountant disclosed that the discrepancy of ₱255,952 between the balance per schedule and the amount reflected in the SFP as of December 31, 2020 was due to unrecorded payments for CY 2019. The Accounting Office is in the process of verifying where to deduct the payments particularly those student grantees that availed of the different loan programs. 



Further, inquiry with the personnel in-charge of the accounts assigned at the OSAS revealed that some of the records were burned when part of the Administration Building was razed by fire last January 6, 2017. According to him, the low collection efficiency can be attributed to the following: 



	a)	Absence of some loan contracts; 

	b)	Whereabouts of some loan grantees cannot be located; 

	c)	Death of some loan grantees; 

	d)	Some loan grantees refused to pay alleging that they were granted general clearance; and 

	e)	Frequent turn-over of personnel assigned to the account.



The inability of Management to properly monitor and collect past due loans receivable accounts deprived other students that could have also benefited from the programs. Further, the unavailability of records and documents precluded verification of the correctness and reliability of the balances reflected in the financial statement. 



We recommended that Management: 



a)	Require the OSAS to retrieve the pertinent documents supporting the receivables from students’ loans particularly the MOA/loan agreements on various loan grants to ensure the correctness of the recorded balance in the books; 



b)	Require the OSAS to set up an effective monitoring system to keep track of the whereabouts of the student grantees who have already graduated or are gainfully employed; 



c)	Require the Credit Officer to intensify the collection of due and demandable accounts by issuance of demand letters to student borrowers and to the co-makers in case of refusal or failure of student borrowers to settle their liabilities, in order to have adequate funds for relending to financially needy students; 



d)	Require the Accountant to reconcile the Loans Receivable-Others balance per schedule and that of the balance reported in the SFP to have fair presentation of the account in the financial statements; and



e)	If the settlement/collectability of the loans receivable can no longer be ascertained, the Head of the Agency may file a request for authority to write-off Loans Receivable - Others accounts to the Commission on Audit thru the COA Audit Team Leader and/or Supervising Auditor, supported with the documents enumerated in Section 8.3 of COA Circular No. 2016-005.



Management Comment:



In reply letter dated April 13, 2021 by the President, he informed the Audit Team that a directive was already issued to the Accounting and OSAS to comply with the recommendations.  He also stated that additional personnel will be utilized to help.  Likewise, he promised that the University, thru the OSAS, will continue their efforts to collect the outstanding loans receivable and keep an effective monitoring system of the loan grantees. 





7)	The Inventory accounts of CBSUA Main Campus with a balance of ₱8.94 million as of December 31, 2020 disclosed various deficiencies and discrepancy amounting to ₱5.75 million between the accounting and property records.



Pursuant to GAM for NGAs, Volume I, the accounting for the inventories rests with the property and accounting units of the agency.

Moreover, instructions provided in Appendices 57, 58, 64 and 66, Volume II of the GAM for NGAs state that the balance per SC shall be reconciled regularly with the SLCs and controlling accounts maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit. Any discrepancies shall be immediately verified and adjusted. Also, the Agency shall conduct physical count of inventories every semester and shall be reported thru the RPCI. The RPCI shall be reconciled with the SLCs and SCs maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit, and Property and/or Supply Division/Unit, respectively. Any discrepancy shall also be verified and /or adjusted accordingly. 



On the other hand, the RSMIs prepared by the Supply and/or Property Unit shall be consolidated by the Accounting Division, by accomplishing the unit cost and total amount using weighted average method or specific identification of costs method, for the preparation of the JEV, at the end of each month. The Accounting Division and Supply and/or Property Unit shall conduct periodic reconciliation of the SLC and SC to identify and adjust any discrepancy.



The comparative balances of inventories per Accounting and Property records of the CBSUA Main Campus as of December 31, 2020 which disclosed a total variance of ₱5.75 million are summarized in the table next page.

The table above showed that per Statement of Financial Position as of December 31, 2020 the recorded balance of various inventory accounts amounted to ₱8.95 million, while the RPCI reported a balance of ₱3.19 million only, hence, disclosing a material variance of ₱5.75 million which represent 64 percent of the total balance of the inventory account. 



Moreover, audit of the inventories disclosed the following observations: 



a)	Although the Supply Office was able to prepare the SCs and submits the RSMIs monthly to the Accounting Unit as their basis in the preparation of the JEV, however, the latter was not able to immediately prepare the JEV for all the RSMIs submitted by the former. The Accounting Unit informed the Audit Team that the latest JEVs prepared and recorded were for the issuances of inventories up to CY 2017 only. Consequently, this resulted in the under recording of expenses and overstatement of inventory accounts in the financial statements as at year-end. 



b)	Although the Supply Office prepares and maintains updated SCs, the total of the SCs of some inventory items did not tally with the actual count per RPCI amounting to ₱202,129, thus, making the report doubtful. The details are shown in Annex G. 



c)	Review of the RPCI as of December 31, 2020 also showed that various inventory items amounting to ₱0.99 million (Annex H) were not reclassified to the appropriate semi-expendable inventory accounts but were recognized either as Office Supplies or Other Office Supplies. 



d)	During the ocular inspection in one of the storerooms of the University, it was noted that there were various construction materials stored thereat, such as, PVC Pipes and PPR Pipes of different sizes, bags of cement, concrete nails and ordinary nails of different sizes, good lumber, Hardiflex, Marine plywood, flat bars, Toilet Bowls, colored G.I. sheets and galloons of Paints, etc., however, these construction materials were not included in the RPCI, therefore, rendering the RCPI incomplete and unreliable.



e)	The Accounting Unit was not able to maintain updated SLCs as required, thus, reconciliation with the Supply Office records cannot be conducted. The Accountant assured the Audit Team that they are already updating the SLCs to establish the accurate balances of the inventory accounts and to facilitate the reconciliation with the Supply Office records.



Due to the above noted deficiencies, the balance of the Inventory account in the Financial Statements as of December 31, 2020 in the amount of ₱8.94 million was not reliable and accurate, hence, not fairly presented in the financial statements.



We recommended that Management require: 



	a)	The Accounting and Supply Unit to check, verify and/or investigate the noted differences. Look into the source documents to determine possible errors in their records, trace the discrepancies and effect the necessary adjustment on the affected inventory accounts; 



	b)	The Accounting Unit to expedite the recording (from 2017 to 2020) of the issued inventories per RSMIs submitted by the Supply Office. Also, to prepare and maintain updated SLCs and religiously conduct periodic reconciliation with the controlling accounts in the financial statements; 



	c)	The Supply Office to reclassify the inventory items erroneously recorded in the RPCI as Office Supplies and Other Office Supplies to the appropriate Semi-Expendable Inventory accounts. Also, include in the inventory Report the unaccounted Construction and Hardware Materials; and 



	d)	The Supply Office to reconcile the RPCI with the SCs as well as with the SLCs maintained by the Accounting Office. Any discrepancy shall also be verified and/or adjusted accordingly. 



Management Comment:



Management assured compliance with the recommendations.  They averred that the recent reorganization of personnel was undertaken to resolve the continuing problem regarding unreconciled property records.  A CPA employee was assigned to head the Supply Office to hasten the reconciliation of the Property and Accounting records. The timeline to accomplish the work is until December 31, 2021. Additional personnel will be assigned to the Accounting Office to augment the workforce to accomplish the work within the deadline. 





8)	Non-reconciliation of CBSUA Main Campus’ PPE account balances between the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) and General Ledger (GL) resulted in the unreconciled net variance of ₱106.03 million as at December 31, 2020, thereby, affecting the reliability and fair presentation of the account in the financial statements.



PD No. 1445 states that:



Section 2. Declaration of Policy. It is the declared policy of the State that all resources of the government shall be managed, expended or utilized in accordance with law and regulations, and safeguard against loss or wastage through illegal or improper disposition, with a view to ensuring efficiency, economy and effectiveness in the operations of government. The responsibility to take care that such policy is faithfully adhered to rests directly with the chief or head of the government agency concerned.



Section 38, Chapter 10 of GAM for NGAs Volume I also states that:



Sec. 38. Physical Count of PPE. The entity shall have a periodic physical count of PPE, which shall be done annually and presented on the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) (Appendix 71) as at December 31 of each year. This shall be submitted to the Auditor concerned not later than January 31 of the following year. Equipment found at station and losses discovered during the physical count shall be reported to the Accounting Division/Unit for proper accounting/recording.



Further, Section 42 of the same Manual provides that: 



Sec. 42. Accounting and Property Records to be maintained for PPE. The Chief Accountant shall maintain the PPELC for each category of PPE including work and other animals, livestock etc. The PPELC shall be kept to record promptly the acquisition, description, custody, estimated useful life, depreciation, impairment loss, disposal and other information about the asset. For check and balance, the Property and Supply Office/Unit shall likewise maintain PC for PPE in their custody to account for the receipt and disposition of the same. The balance per PC shall be reconciled with PPELC maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit. They shall also be reconciled with other property records like PAR. 



The following are the forms/reports necessary to account for PPE:



xxx



a)	Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (Appendix 73) – this form shall be used to report the physical count and condition of PPE by type as at a given date, including those which are unrecorded and those which could not be accounted for. It shows the balance of PPE per property cards and per count and the shortage/overage, if any. It shall be rendered by the Inventory Committee, on its yearly physical count of properties owned by the entity. 



b)	Inventory and Inspection Report for Unserviceable Property (Appendix 74) – this report shall be used to account for all unserviceable property of an entity which is subject to disposal. It also serves as the basis in derecognizing the unserviceable properties carried in the PPE accounts. 



As of this writing, the Inventory Committee of CBSUA Main Campus was not able to submit the CY 2020 RPCPPE for the PPE accounts with the following balances as of December 31, 2020 per FS:

To safeguard the government resources, such as property, plant and equipment (PPE), from the risk of loss, wastage and/or misuse, it is imperative that a proper internal control must be in place. Internal control commands perpetual monitoring and check and balance. This is being done by conducting at least an annual physical inventory taking and report making. This would ensure that the recorded PPEs are still in their place, existing and in a working condition. 



The report on the PPEs status must then be compared with the updated accounting records to validate the accuracy, reliability and completeness of the PPEs’ account balances. 



Shown in Annex I is the analysis of the PPE accounts based on the available records with the following noted observations:



a)	The RPCPPE for CY 2019 amounting to ₱443.44 million contains balances for reconciliation of ₱6.92 million with the accounting records balance amounting to ₱639.21 million. The non-submission of the RPCPPE for CY 2020 and the inability of the Accounting Unit and Supply Unit to maintain complete and updated PPELCs and PCs, respectively, hinder the reconciliation of the PPE accounts. As of this date, the Supply Office is still in the process of updating and printing the PCs. 



b)	Likewise, the variance between the FS balances of PPE accounts for CY 2020 and the RPCPPE for CY 2019 as presented, indicated an increase of ₱188.84 million. Verification of the GL and the GJ showed that the increase in PPEs, as shown in the Financial Statements, includes the currents year’s purchases amounting to ₱82.81 million (see Annex I for the details). The current year’s purchases were already taken up in the books of accounts, thus, the PPE per FS were much higher than the PPE as shown in the RPCPPE for CY 2019. If we deduct the current year’s purchases of ₱82.81 million from the increase of ₱188.84 million, then the net variance between the PPE balances in the FS and RCPPE would still be ₱106.03 million. As shown in Annex I, the PPEs with huge increases during the year that need further verification, scrutiny and reconciliation were the School Building, Other Structures, Road Network, Information and Communication Technology, Motor Vehicles, Land Improvement and Other Machinery and Equipment amounting to ₱22.52 million, ₱13.21 million, ₱11.47 million, ₱8.37 million, ₱4.40 million, ₱3.00 million and ₱2.34 million, respectively. 



Inquiry with the Supply Officer/Property Officer disclosed that the conduct of inventory taking of all PPE is on-going. After the inventory taking, the report will be prepared and submitted as required. The Accountant and the Supply Officer assured the Audit Team, that after the submission of the RCPPE for CY 2020, they will focus on the reconciliation of the PPE accounts to have an accurate and reliable PPE report. 



It is essential that the Agency conducts an annual physical inventory count on the PPE and submit on a timely basis the RPCPPE and the Inventory and Inspection Report for Unserviceable Property (IIRUP), should there be an unserviceable property upon inventory count. Also, reconciliation thereof with the Accounting records shall be made to ascertain the accuracy, reliability, correctness of the PPE account balances in the Financial Statements and to ascertain the PPE’s existence. 



We recommended that Management require: 



	a)	The Inventory Committee to expedite the preparation and submission of the RPCPPE and IIRUP for CY 2020, with the RCPPE for CY 2019 as basis/starting report to come up with the CY 2020 RPCPPE, and as required in GAM for NGAs Volume I; and 



	b)	The Accounting and Supply Offices to maintain complete and updated PPELCs and PCs, respectively, and conduct reconciliation of their property records in order to ensure accuracy, reliability and correctness of the accounts balances as presented in the Financial Statements.



Management Comment:



Management averred to comply with the recommendations.  The newly designated Supply Officer, as head of the Inventory Committee assured the Audit Team that they will submit the report as soon as possible. They also informed the Audit Team that they will follow the procedures mandated under COA Circular No. 2020-06 during the conduct of inventory taking of plants, property and equipment of the University to come up with an accurate and reliable PPE report. 





9)	Non-disposal of unserviceable properties of undetermined amount resulted in the accumulation thereof and consequently diminished their value due to prolonged exposure to natural elements.



Section 79 of PD No. 1445 provides that when government property has become unserviceable for any cause, or is no longer needed, it shall, upon application of the officer accountable therefore, be inspected by the head of the Agency or his duly authorized representative in the presence of the auditor concerned and, if found valueless or unsalable, it may be destroyed in the presence. If found to be valuable, it may be sold at public auction to the highest bidder under the supervision of the proper committee on award or similar body in the presence of the auditor or other duly authorized representative of the Commission on Audit.



In addition, Section 40 (c) and (d) of Chapter of GAM for NGAs, Volume I states that:



“A Plant, Property and Equipment (PPE) is said to be unserviceable if it is no longer capable of providing the entity with future economic benefits or service potential.”



“All unserviceable property shall be reported in the Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) (Appendix 76, GAM Vol. II)”



Ocular inspection of the storage rooms at the Gabaldon Building showed that unserviceable PPEs of undetermined value were stockpiled thereat. While some unserviceable PPEs that used to be scattered at the back of the Supply Office were already transferred temporarily at the Barn House for safekeeping. Likewise, unserviceable motor vehicles, spare parts, junk and scrap materials were left outside the motor pool and some areas of the Campus, exposing them to various perils which reduced their recoverable value and deprived the University of a possible additional income from the sale thereof.



According to the Supply Officer they are still in the process of segregating the unserviceable PPEs according to their classification. However, they encountered difficulty with regard to unserviceable PPEs without corresponding value or price indicated in the RPCPPE.



The absence of action by Management since CY 2014, as this was already embodied in the Audit Report for that year, on the immediate disposal of these unserviceable PPEs despite knowledge of their conditions, resulted in the overstatement of the assets in the financial statements. These properties are no longer usable to the University's operations, hence, it is proper that Management, particularly the Supply Office, should take initiative in the conduct of appropriate disposal thereof. Likewise, additional income can be generated if these properties will be sold and ultimately, the storerooms/bodegas and other open spaces where these properties are dumped/kept will be cleared and eventually be used for some other purposes.



We recommended that Management:



a)	Require the Supply Office to report all unserviceable properties of the University in the IIRUP and submit it to the Disposal Committee, copy furnished the Audit Team for their respective appropriate action; and



b)	Require the Disposal Committee to hasten the segregation and appraisal of the unserviceable PPEs and dispose them in accordance with Section 79, PD No. 1445 in order to generate additional revenue from its sale.



Management Comment:



Management assured the Audit Team that the University is fully committed to abide with the audit recommendations.  He informed the Audit Team that a team was already created to conduct physical inventory taking of all unserviceable properties, including scrap and waste materials with salvage value at Pili Campus. At present, the inventory taking of the unserviceable properties is on-going and the University intends to dispose the unserviceable properties the soonest possible time in accordance with applicable rules and regulations on disposal of unserviceable properties.





10)	Some of the motor vehicles owned by the University were exposed to climatic adversities and possible loss/wastage of government properties as these were just parked in open areas/spaces inside the campuses.



Section 2 of PD No. 1445 states:



“It is the declared policy of the State that all resources of the government shall be managed, expended or utilized in accordance with law and regulations, and safeguarded against loss or wastage through illegal or improper disposition, with a view of ensuring efficiency, economy and effectiveness in the operations of government. The responsibility to take care that such policy is faithfully adhered to rests directly with the chief or head of the government agency concerned.”



Likewise, Section 123 of the same Decree provides that:



“Internal Control as a plan of organization and all coordinated methods and measures adopted within the organization or agency to safeguard its assets, checks the accuracy and reliability of its accounting data, and encourage adherence to prescribed managerial policies.”



For CY 2020, the University owned 21 motor vehicles valued in the books at ₱16.80 million. Out of the 21 motor vehicles, two vehicles costing ₱0.83 million were assigned to CBSUA-Pasacao Campus and the newly purchased Hi-Ace Commuter Van valued at ₱1.34 million was given to CBSUA-Sipocot Campus for their use. The remaining 17 motor vehicles costing ₱14.62 million were retained at CBSUA-Pili Campus.



Actual inspection conducted at the motor pool of the University revealed that the space allocated as garage for motor vehicles is not sufficient to accommodate all the vehicles owned by the University. In fact, some of the vehicles were just parked outside the motor pool without any protection or shelter, thus, exposing the vehicle to natural elements that would eventually contribute to the early deterioration of these assets.



According to the personnel at the motor pool, considering that the space is not enough to accommodate all the motor vehicles owned by the University, only the new vehicles were parked at the garage. The rest were parked outside the motor pool without any protection from the effect of scorching weather.



Confirmation also revealed that CBSUA-Pasacao Campus does not have garage to safe keep the two vehicles assigned to them. The vehicles were just parked at the open space between the school stage and the Administration Building without any protection or shelter from natural elements.



Exposure of the motor vehicles to the elements and changing climate may cause their early deterioration and eventually shorten their lifespan and usefulness. If not properly addressed, this may result in possible loss and wastage of government properties.



We recommended that Management consider the immediate construction of garage to protect the motor vehicles of the University from undue deterioration and possible loss.



Management Comment: 



The President, on his letter reply dated March 2, 2021, assured the Audit Team full commitment to comply with the recommendation.  He stated that meanwhile that the proposal for the construction of garage is being work-out, temporary shed will be constructed to serve as garage.  He also stated that he directed the Motorpool in-charge to optimize and use all available spaces at the existing garage and to use the Social Hall or other suitable roofed structure in the campus as temporary garage.



During the exit conference, the Director of Plant Property Development Office also informed the Audit Team that two temporary structures were already constructed to serve as temporary garage.





11)	The Property Acknowledgment Receipt (PAR) being issued by the Supply Officer is wanting of significant details. 



Section 111 of PD No. 1445 on keeping of accounts states that:



1)	The accounts of an agency shall be kept in such detail as is necessary to meet the needs of the agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or control agencies of the government.



2)	The highest standards of honesty, objectivity and consistency shall be observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate or misleading information.



GAM for NGAs Volume II, on the other hand, provides for instructions on how to properly fill-out the Property Acknowledgment Receipt (Appendix 71). Pertinent details to be accomplished include: 1) Entity Name; 2) Fund Cluster; 3) PAR No.; 4) Quantity; 5) Unit; 6) Description; 7) Property Number; 8) Date Acquired; and 9) Amount.





The instructions also state:



“D. The recipient or end user of the property shall acknowledge receipt of the property by signing the “Received by” portion and also indicate the date of receipt of the property. The designated Supply and/or Property Custodian shall sign the “Issued by” portion and indicate the date of issue of the property.”



The purpose of PAR is to evidence the issuance of a property to an end-user and the acceptance of the end-user of said property thru acknowledgement of receipt thereof. This is to ensure that all of the School’s Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) are being properly accounted for and are secured with the end-users’ safekeeping. Also, it readily determines accountability and liability for the PPE in case of its loss or misuse.



This purpose, however, is being defeated when the PAR’s details are insufficient or the essential information which are supposed to be included in the PAR are not properly indicated.



Perusal of the PAR issued by the Supply Officer of CBSUA Sipocot showed that only the following columns were presents:



a)	Quantity

b)	Unit

c)	Description

d)	Property No.



It is noted that the columns for “Date Acquired” and “Amount” are missing. Also, there are some PARs with the PAR No. detail not duly filled-out. Further, the date of receipt by the end user and issuance of the PAR are not indicated. The date of issuance of the PAR is important since the PAR shall be renewed every three years.



PD No. 1445 requires that the accounts of an Agency shall be kept in such detail as is necessary to meet the needs of the agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or control agencies of the government. The details omitted from the PARs are important in the proper accounting, monitoring and safekeeping of the University’s PPEs, hence, should be properly and fully accomplished.



We recommended that Management require the Supply Officer to accomplish the PARs strictly following the instructions provided by the GAM for NGAs Volume II (Appendix 71) and with the guidance of the provisions of PD No. 1445.



Management Comment:



In the letter reply of the Supply Officer dated April 6, 2021, he explained that upon checking of the form being use, he found out that it was the old form.  However, he promised that he will comply with the recommendation and strictly follow the instructions on the proper accomplishment of the PAR as provided in the GAM for NGAS. 





12)	The recorded Accounts Payable of CBSUA Main Campus for CY 2020 amounting to ₱55.68 million did not reconcile with the balance of the unpaid obligations under due and demandable in the Financial Accountability Reports (FARs) amounting to ₱34.35 million as of December 31, 2020.



COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2019-1 dated January 1, 2019 was issued as update to prescribe the modified formats for the budget and financial accountability report (BFARs), as earlier prescribed under COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2014-1 dated July 2, 2014 for approved budget/utilization commitments and disbursements of agencies authorized by law to use their income; and COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2013-1 dated March 15, 2013 in prescribing the harmonized formats for the financial accountability reports on appropriations, allotments, obligations and disbursements.



Item 5 of COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2014-1, provides for the responsibilities of official concerned, as follows:



5.0 The BFARs shall be prepared and certified correct by the following officials:



5.1.1. Budget Officer/Head of Budget Unit – for the portion of the report pertaining to appropriations, allotments, obligations, unpaid obligations-not yet due and demandable and unobligated allotments.



5.1.2. Chief Accountant/Head of Accounting Unit – for the portion of the report pertaining to the disbursements and unpaid obligations-due and demandable.



Also, Section 111 of the PD No. 1445, on keeping of accounts provides that:



1)	The accounts of an agency shall be kept in such detail as is necessary to meet the needs of the agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or control agencies of the government.



2)	The highest standards of honesty, objectivity and consistency shall be observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate or misleading information.



The Statement of Allotment, Obligations, Disbursements and Balances (SAAODB) (FAR No. 1-A) for Current and Continuing Appropriations under the Regular Agency Fund and the Statement of Approved Budget, Utilizations, Disbursements and Balances (SABUDB) (FAR No.2-A) for internally generated fund of the Main Campus showed that the total balance of unpaid obligations-due and demandable obligations did not reconcile with the related general ledger amounts of Accounts Payable for CY 2020 transactions, as presented below:

The preceding table disclosed that the total Due and Demandable Obligations accounts payable reported in FAR Nos. 1-A and 2-A is considerably lower than the amounts of Accounts Payable recognized in the books of accounts by ₱21.34 million.



As provided under Item 5 of the same Circular, the responsible and accountable persons with regard to the preparation of correct FARs are the Chief Accountant/Head of Accounting Unit and Budget Officer/Head of Budget Unit.



The inability of the Accounting Unit to reconcile the information reported in the various financial accountability reports rendered them inaccurate and the balance of the Accounts Payable in the financial statements at year-end unreliable.



We recommended that Management require the Accountant to review and reconcile the amounts of recorded expenditures, disbursements and accounts payable with the budget records to present accurate and reliable information in the financial accountability reports.



Henceforth, the Accounting and Budget Units to religiously conduct reconciliation of their recorded information in the Budget and Financial Accountability Reports.



Management Comment:



Management promised to work on the reconciliation of the budget and accounting records.





13)	Due to Officers and Employees of CBSUA Calabanga Campus amounting to ₱321,902 outstanding for two years and more, was not supported with complete documents and not reverted to Accumulated Surplus account.



Section 98, Chapter 4, PD No. 1445 states that:



The Commission, upon notice to the head of agency concerned, may revert to unappropriated surplus of the general fund of the national government, any unliquidated balance of accounts payable in the books of the national government, which have been outstanding for two years or more and against which no actual claim, administrative or judicial, has been filed or which is not covered by perfected contracts on record.



Executive Order No. 87 also requires that:



All documented accounts payable which have been outstanding for two years or more and all undocumented accounts payable regardless of the year the same were incurred shall be reverted to the Accumulated Surplus.



Further, COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 prescribes that all claims against government funds shall be supported with complete documentation.



Verification of the Aging of Due to Officers and Employees account of the Calabanga Campus showed the following, viz:

As can be gleaned from the above table, the Due to Officers and Employees account of ₱1.53 million still includes claims that were maintained in the books for more than three years amounting to ₱193,472. These payables existed in the books for almost 18 years starting CY 2002.



Further verification revealed the amount of ₱193,472 pertains to claims of various officers and employees mostly for reimbursement of travelling expenses, reimbursement of various expenses, honoraria, catering services, gratuity pay, salaries and wages (Annex J). However, perusal of the Schedule of Due to Officers and Employees unveiled that the amount of ₱193,472 does not include AP for 2015 and 2016 under Internally Generated Fund (Fund 164) amounting to ₱128,431 as follows:

₱     128,430.66



Based from the preceding table, the correct amount of AP to be reverted to Accumulated Surplus is ₱321,902 (₱193,472 + ₱128,431).



Inquiry with the Accountant disclosed that the constraint on the non-payment of claims was due to absence of complete and proper documents to support the transactions that were recorded as liability.



The omission of the Accountant to revert long outstanding accounts payable to Accumulated Surplus, contrary to the aforementioned rules and regulations, resulted in overstatement of the liability account and understatement of the Surplus account in the books of the Agency.



We recommended that Management require the Accountant to comply with the following courses of action:



a)	Prepare confirmation letters to claimants and conduct a regular review and monitoring of all recorded obligations to ensure that only valid claims remain in the books;



b)	Comply with Section 98 of PD No. 1445 and EO No. 87 on the reversion of accounts payable outstanding for two years or more; and



c)	Strictly conform with COA Circular No. 2012 dated June 14, 2012, relative to rules/regulations on all claims against government funds which shall be supported with complete documentation and only claims with complete documents should be booked as AP.



Management Comment:



During the exit conference, Management promised to comply with the recommendation.



14)	Unexpended balances of the funds received from various NGAs recorded under Due to NGAs account for projects completed as of December 31, 2020 amounting to ₱1.51 million were not yet returned to the Source Agencies (SAs).



Section 2 of PD No. 1445 states that:



“It is the declared policy of the State that all resources of the government shall be managed, expended or utilized in accordance with law and regulations, and safeguarded against loss or wastage through illegal or improper disposition, with a view of ensuring efficiency, economy and effectiveness in the operations of government. The responsibility to take care that such policy is faithfully adhered to rests directly with the chief or head of the government agency concerned.”



Likewise, COA Circular No. 94-013 provides for the Rules and Regulations in the Grant, Utilization and Liquidation of Funds Transferred to Implementing Agencies (IAs). It directs that:



6.7 return to the SA any unused balance and refund of disallowance upon completion of the project.



Also Chapter 6, Section 63, Item “g.” provides that:



Sec.63. Disbursement for Inter-Agency Transferred Funds (IATF). The following are the accounting policies for the transfer of funds:

xxx



g. The IA shall return to the SA any unused balance upon completion of the project, if stipulated in the MOA.



Audit of the Due to NGAs account revealed that there were projects undertaken through an Inter-Agency Transferred Funds from various NGAs which are 100 percent complete, however, the unexpended balances were not yet returned to their respective SAs and remained in the books of the University. Details are shown the attached Annex K.



Analyzing the table, it can be gleaned that:



	a)	There are seven projects funded by other NGAs way back CYs 2011 to 2016, six of which are reported to be 100 per cent completed while one project has been reported to be discontinued. Also, six of which still have unexpended balances totaling to ₱1.51 million. This balance should be returned to their SAs upon completion of the project as provided for in the MOA.



	b)	There are two projects, namely: Mass Production of Breadfruit Planting Materials and Research Initiatives and Establishment and Operation of ORGANIKA Center, the targeted completion date of which way back in 2013, or seven years ago, thus, their full liquidation of the fund transfers by returning the unexpended balances to the SAs is already long overdue. Further verification disclosed that the project Mass Production of Breadfruit Planting Materials and Research Initiatives and Establishment with unutilized balance of ₱0.50 million was not completed but discontinued due to unknown reason.



The audited financial reports of these projects have already been submitted to the Audit Team. These projects were already tagged as 100 per cent completed but have yet to be recorded or journalized in the books because there were still few documentary requirements that need to be accomplished.



The inability of the University to return the unexpended balance of the completed and discontinued projects exposes government funds to possible misuse and/or misappropriation. In addition, the funds remain idle in the custody of the IA when it could have been used to execute other more profitable or productive venture of the SA.



We recommended that Management require the Accountant to coordinate with the personnel of the Department in charge of the project implementation to evaluate the status of completed projects and prepare the necessary disbursement voucher for the return to the SA of the unutilized balance of ₱1.51 million in accordance with the MOA/Contract and the afore-cited issuances.



Management Comment:



Management was amenable to return the unutilized balance of ₱1.51 million to the SA.  They informed the Audit Team that finalization of the terminal reports is on process.



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



Management should return immediately the unexpended balance to the SA in accordance with the MOA/Contract. 





15)	Withheld premiums and/or contributions and loan repayments to GSIS, HDMF and PhilHealth were not remitted by the three Campuses within the prescribed period.

As presented in Annexes L, L-1 and L-2, it can be gleaned that the total withheld premiums and/or contributions and loan repayments did not tally with the total remittances in the following month they were withheld for all the Inter-Agency Payables accounts. Remittances were either over-remitted or under-remitted. This shows that the three campuses were unable to fully remit said premiums/contributions within the prescribed period.



Moreover, based on the submitted aging schedule of the Main Campus at year-end, the balances of Due to GSIS, Pag-IBIG and PhilHealth accounts include negative balances of ₱107,384, ₱0.80 million and ₱31,373, respectively, which were still for reconciliation by the Accountant.

Based on the table, the total amount of ₱4,568 was due in less than 30 days while the remaining ₱146,758 was already overdue which aged 31 days to 3 years and above. This should have been remitted immediately in the ensuing month from the time it was withheld. Thus, it clearly shows that the Calabanga Campus was unable to remit premiums and/or contributions and loan repayments from their employees’ salaries within the prescribed period. Moreover, from the total overdue, ₱71,933 or 47.54 percent of which are already outstanding for 3 years and above and represents the majority of the unremitted premiums and /or contributions. 



Inquiry with the Calabanga Campus Accountant disclosed that the premiums in arrears for Due to GSIS include over/under recording of remittances for government and personal shares, insurance premium-optional, employee compensation premium and various loans such as salary, emergency, calamity, cash advance/eCard Plus loans. 



For the Due to PhilHealth account of Calabanga Campus, the balance of ₱51,371 which aged three years and above pertains to premiums on government and personal share for a particular period that has been overlooked and is currently subject for reconciliation. 



Likewise, for Due to Pag-IBIG account of Calabanga Campus, the balances represent the unremitted premiums on government and personal share, and calamity and multi-purpose loans also subject for reconciliation.



Finally, the inability of Management to remit the required premiums and/or contributions in arrears to GSIS, PhilHealth, HDMF within the prescribed periods poses risks that the employees may be deprived of the loan privileges, medical reimbursements and the full benefits that they may avail upon retirement from government service. Likewise, non-reconciliation of the Due to GSIS, PhilHealth and Pag-IBIG accounts as to the over/under recording of remittances renders the accuracy of the affected accounts doubtful.



This is a reiteration of the prior year’s audit findings that remained unacted upon by the concerned offices.



We reiterated our recommendations that Management:



a)	Require the Accountant to immediately conduct reconciliation on the balances of the Due to GSIS, Pag-IBIG, and PhilHealth accounts and thereafter, the reconciled amounts be immediately remitted to the abovementioned agencies and any adjustments on such accounts be immediately effected; and



b)	Give the highest priority on the immediate remittance of all the premiums and contributions of the agency personnel to GSIS, HDMF, and PhilHealth within the prescribed period provided in the regulations cited above.



Management Comment:



Management was amenable to comply with the recommendations.  They averred that they will conduct monthly reconciliation of the accounts to ensure that all the contributions are remitted on time and intact. 



In the reply letter of the Accountant of Sipocot Campus, she stated that the discrepancy of the amount withheld and remitted for the month was due to the unadjusted system in the other government agencies.  At their end, deductions are adjusted accordingly when there are salary adjustments during the month.  However, the billing received from the collecting agencies of the government was computed on the unadjusted salary, thus, the amount remitted is not equal to the amount withheld. She also stated that the beginning balances of Due to Other Government Agencies pertain to previous years’ balances. Nevertheless, she assured the Audit Team that the Accounting Office is currently reconciling these accounts. 



In the letter reply of the Accountant of CBSUA-Calabanga Campus, she informed the Audit Team that as of March 16, 2021, the personnel of HRMO was able to reconcile the amount of ₱20,690 and ₱ 15,732 for HMDF and PhilHealth, respectively.  She promised to complete the reconciliation not later than the 2nd quarter of the year.  



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



The need to remit the correct amount and reconcile their records is paramount in order that employees will not be deprived of the benefits from GSIS, PhilHealth and HDMF.





16)	The inability of Management to immediately file claims against the Bonding Company that issued the Performance and Advance Payment Surety bonds and the inability to exercise all remedies against the contractor whose contract was terminated due to abandonment of contract works, may result in loss of government fund thru non-recovery of the Performance Security in the amount of ₱1.90 million and unrecouped advance payment in the amount of ₱0.65 million.



The pertinent provisions of Section 4 of Annex E of the Revised IRR of RA No. 9184 are quoted as follows: 



4. ADVANCE PAYMENT 



4.1 The procuring entity shall, upon a written request of the contractor which shall be submitted as a contract document, make an advance payment to the contractor in an amount not exceeding fifteen percent (15%) of the total contract price, to be made in lump sum or, at the most, two installments according to a schedule specified in the Instructions to Bidders and other relevant Tender Documents. 



	1)	The advance payment shall be made only upon the submission to and acceptance by the procuring entity of an irrevocable standby letter of credit of equivalent value from a commercial bank, a bank guarantee or a surety bond callable upon demand, issued by a surety or insurance company duly licensed by the Insurance Commission and confirmed by the procuring entity. 



	2)	The advance payment shall be repaid by the contractor by deducting fifteen percent (15%) from his periodic progress payments a percentage equal to the percentage of the total contract price used for the advance payment.  

Likewise, Section 69 of the same law provides for the imposition of Administrative Penalties, viz: 



69.1 In addition to the provisions of Rule XXI and XXII of the IRR, the HOPE, subject to the authority delegated to the BAC, if any, shall impose on bidders or prospective bidders, the administrative penalty of suspension for one (1) year for the first offense, and suspension of two (2) years for the second offense from participating in the competitive bidding process, as well as disqualification from further participating in the competitive bidding being undertaken by the Procuring Entity concerned, where applicable for the following violations: 



a) to e) xxx 

f) Termination of contract due to default of the bidder. 



xxx



69.2 In addition to the penalty of suspension, the bid security or the performance security posted by the concerned bidder or prospective bidder shall also be forfeited. 



69.4 The procedure for suspension or blacklisting of suppliers, contractors, or consultants for GoP projects shall be undertaken in accordance with the guidelines issued by GPPB. 



Suspension or blacklisting of suppliers, contractors, or consultants shall be made in accordance with the Uniform Guidelines for Blacklisting of Manufacturers, Supplier, Distributors, Contractors and Consultants. A suspended or blacklisted supplier, contractor or consultant shall not be allowed to participate in all procurement opportunities of the government during the duration of the suspension or blacklisting, regardless of the modality of procurement employed by the Procuring Entity. 



Moreover, attention is invited on the following sections of RA No. 9184: 



“62.2.1. From the time project construction commenced up to final acceptance, the contractor shall assume full responsibility for the following: a) any damage or destruction of the works except those occasioned by force majeure; and b) safety, protection, security, and convenience of his personnel, third parties, and the public at large, as well as the works, equipment, installation and the like to be affected by his construction work.(a) “



“62.2.2. One (1) year from project completion up to final acceptance or the defects liability period. “

“62.2.2.2. The defects liability period shall be covered by the Performance Security of the contractor required in Section 39.1 of this IRR, which shall guarantee that the contractor performs his responsibilities stated in the immediately preceding Section. If the contractor fails to comply with its obligations under Section 62.2.2.1 of this IRR, the Procuring Entity shall forfeit its performance security, subject its property(ies) to attachment or garnishment proceedings, and perpetually disqualify it from participating in any competitive bidding. All payables of the GoP in his favor shall be offset to recover the costs.” (Emphasis supplied) 



Verification of records disclosed that on October 28, 2019, the Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) of the University conducted the opening of bid for the Rehabilitation of University Atrium (Infra 19-11). The Approved Budget of the Contract (ABC) amounted to ₱7.42 million sourced from the General Appropriations Act (GAA) of 2019 and Internally Generated Fund (IGF) amounting to ₱3.42 million and ₱4.00 million, respectively. 



Review of the Minutes of the Bidding showed that six contractors had submitted and participated in the said bidding and were all declared by the BAC as complying. The BAC declared Contractor A with bid price of ₱6.28 million as the lowest calculated bid. Post-Qualification was conducted by the Technical Working Group (TWG) and on November 25, 2019 the BAC recommended the award to Contractor A. Contract was executed by and between the University and Contractor A. The project should be completed within 90 calendar days. 



Examination of the documents showed that on January 17, 2020, the contractor requested for the release of the 15 per cent advance payment or mobilization fund in the amount of ₱0.94 million (₱6,283,382.07 x 15%) and was released in two installments, viz:

In compliance with Section 4.2 of Annex E of the Revised IRR of RA No. 9184, which requires that advance payment shall be made only upon the submission to and acceptance of the procuring entity of an irrevocable standby letter of credit of equivalent value from commercial bank, a bank guarantee or a surety bond callable upon demand, issued by a surety or insurance company duly registered by the Insurance Commission and confirmed by the procuring entity, the contactor posted an Advance Payment Bond (Surety Bond) in the amount of ₱0.94 million to guarantee the repayment of the advance payment/down payment made to the contractor.



The contract was terminated on September 7, 2020 due to abandonment by the contractor of the contract works. Based from the Technical Report dated August 10, 2020, accomplishment of the contractor amounted to ₱287,150. However, as of this writing, Management was unable to enforce the sanctions or remedies provided for under the above stated regulations. 



Inquiry from the Legal Officer disclosed that a demand letter was already sent to the Bonding Company with regard to the Performance Bond in the amount of ₱1.90 million, but the Bonding Company did not comply with such demand. She also informed the Audit Team that blacklisting is being considered, but, as of this date, no concrete plan to implement the blacklisting was made. However, as regards to the surety bond issued by the contractor for the advance payment of ₱0.94 million, which was reduced to ₱0.65 million after considering the accomplishment of the contractor, no further actions were made by the Agency to forfeit said surety bonds. 



The leniency of Management to enforce the sanctions/remedies available under the circumstances, particularly the surety bonds issued as performance security and for the unrecouped advance payment in the amounts of ₱1.90 million and ₱0.65 million, respectively, may result in loss of government funds thru the non-recovery thereof from the surety bond company. 



We recommended that Management continue to assert its claim against the bonding company to recover the performance security posted by the contractor including the surety bond for the unrecouped portion of the advance payment to avoid possible loss of government fund. Management is also enjoined to strictly enforce other sanctions/remedies available under the afore-stated regulation to protect the interest of the government and to forestall the happening of the same incident in the future.



Management Comment:



Management informed the Audit Team that they will do their best to recover the amount from the Bonding Company or if not they will file a case against the Contractor in order to recover the said amount. 



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



We reminded Management to act immediately on the claim, keeping in mind the liability clause in the performance and the advance payment bonds posted by the contractor. 





17)	The inability of the BAC to deduct the actual accomplishment of the previous contractor to the take-over contract awarded to the next lowest calculated bidder of the project under consideration resulted in the overprice/excess in the contract amount awarded thereto by ₱73,888.



Section 4(D)(3) of Annex H of the Revised IRR of RA No. 9184 provides:



a)	Instances when Take-over of contracts may be resorted to:



I) The contract previously awarded through Competitive Bidding has been rescinded or terminated for causes provided for in the contract and existing laws;



II) Where immediate action is necessary:



a) to prevent damage to or loss of life or property, or

b) to restore vital public services, infrastructure facilities and other public utilities.



b)	Procedure



i. The BAC shall post- qualify and negotiate with the second lowest calculated /highest rated bidder for the project under consideration at the said bidder's own original bid price, applicable to the remaining works to be done. Authority to negotiate contracts for the projects under the foregoing exceptional cases shall be subject to prior approval of the HOPE concerned, within their respective limit of approving authority.



ii. If negotiation fails then the BAC shall post-qualify and negotiate with the next lowest calculated/highest rated bidder at the said bidder's original bid price.



iii. If the negotiation fails another time, the process is repeated until all the bidders from the previous bidding have been considered.



iv. If the negotiation fails and there is no bidder left from the previous bidding or if the original awardees is a Single Calculated Responsive Bidder/Single Rated Responsive Bidder, the BAC may either invite at least three (3) suppliers/contractors/consultants to submit their bids, or resort to any other appropriate alternative method of procurement.



v. In case of successful post-qualification and negotiation, the BAC shall recommend to the HOPE the award of contract with the said supplier, contractor or consultant. Award of contract shall be made in accordance with Section IV (L) of these Guidelines.



Likewise, Section 2 of PD No. 1445 states:



“It is the declared policy of the State that all resources of the government shall be managed, expended or utilized in accordance with law and regulations, and safeguarded against loss or wastage through illegal or improper disposition, with a view of ensuring efficiency, economy and effectiveness in the operations of government. The responsibility to take care that such policy is faithfully adhered to rests directly with the chief or head of the government agency concerned.”



Verification of records disclosed that on October 28, 2019, the BAC of the University conducted the opening of bid for the Rehabilitation of University Atrium (Infra 19-11). The Approved Budget for the Contract (ABC) amounted to ₱7.42 million sourced from the GAA of 2019 and the IGF amounting to ₱3.42 million and ₱4.00 million, respectively.



Review of the Minutes of the Bidding showed that six contractors had submitted and participated in the said bidding and were all declared by the BAC as complying. The BAC declared Contractor A with bid price of ₱6.28 million as the lowest calculated bid. Post-Qualification was conducted by the TWG and on November 25, 2019, the BAC recommended the award to said contractor. Immediately thereafter, a Contract was executed by and between the University and the said contractor with an agreed contract period of 90 calendar days. The Notice to Proceed was then received by the contractor on February 2, 2020 with a contract duration starting from February 12, 2020 to May 12, 2020. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the work was suspended for 90 days, hence, the revised period of completion was moved to August 10, 2020.



Verification of the Technical Report dated August 17, 2020 showed that as of August 10, 2020, the contractor had incurred a negative slippage of 94.34 percent. Premised on the above report, the contract was terminated on September 7, 2020 due to abandonment of the contract works. The University resorted to take-over of contracts thru negotiation with the second lowest complying bidder for the project under consideration. Review of the Post-Qualification and Evaluation Report disclosed that on September 21, 2020 the TWG conducted the post-qualification of Contractor B being the second LCB during the original bidding with a bid price of ₱6.40 million. After the post-qualification, a contract was entered into by and between the CBSUA and Contractor B on October 8, 2020 with a negotiated contract price of ₱6.33 million to be completed within 90 calendar days starting on October 14, 2020 until January 12, 2021.



However, evaluation of the contract entered into by and between the University and the contractor, it was noted that there was a reduction of ₱69,496 as against the original bid price of ₱6.39 million. Further examination of the submitted Inspection Report as of August 10, 2020 showed that the former contractor has an actual accomplishment on the original scope of work which amounted to ₱143,384. Thus, if the BAC had correctly considered the actual accomplishment of the previous contractor, the contract cost for the take-over contract should be ₱6.25 million. Due to the inability of the BAC to consider the actual accomplishment of the previous contractor as reflected in the Inspection Report, the University had suffered monetary loss amounting to ₱73,888, computed as follows:



Original bid price of Contractor B

₱    6,395,916.79

Less: Actual accomplishments of Contractor A

143,383.94

Should be amount of Take-over contract

₱    6,252,532.85

Cost of Take-over contract awarded to Contractor B

6,326,421.14

Loss

₱         73,888.29

We recommended that Management:



			a)	Require the BAC to submit their computation or basis on how they arrived at the contract amount of ₱6.33 million and take appropriate action on the noted overstatement of contract amount based on subject accomplishment made by the previous contractor; and



			b)	Require the BAC to coordinate closely with the PPD Division with respect to the computation of contractor’s accomplishment to avoid possible loss of government funds in case of take-over contracts.



Management Comment:



In the reply letter of the BAC Chairman dated March 25, 2021, he stated that the government did not suffer loss on the takeover contract.  The computation on how they arrived with the contract amount was submitted.  The BAC Chairman also stated that the Head of BAC Secretariat had consulted the PPD in the finalization of the contract. 



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



We maintain our stand that the takeover contract was unfavorable to the University.  The submitted computation by the BAC will be reviewed in order to determine the correctness of the contract price.





18)	Original copies of bids documents received and opened were not initialed on every page by the BAC members who were present during the opening of bids.  



Section 24.5 of the Philippine Bidding Documents for the Procurement of goods and infrastructure, 5th Edition, dated August 2016, states that:



All members of the BAC who are present during the bid opening shall initial every page of the original copies of all bids received and opened.



Likewise, Section 29 of the 2016 Revised IRR of RA No. 9184 on bid Opening provides that:



The BAC shall open immediately after the deadline for submission and receipt of bids. The time, date and place of the opening of bids shall be specified in the Bidding documents.



The bidders or their duly authorized representatives may attend the opening of bids. The BAC shall ensure the integrity, security and confidentiality of all submitted bids. The abstract of bids as read shall be made available to the public upon written requests and payment of a specified fee to recover cost of materials.



During the conduct of auditorial review, it was noted that the bidding documents submitted by the bidders during the opening of bids were not initialed by all members of the BAC present. Please see Annex M for the List of Procurements through Public Bidding not compliant with Section 24.5 of the Philippine Bidding Documents for the Procurement of Goods and Infrastructure. Scrutiny of the related documents also disclosed that out of the 20 submitted documents for auditorial review, only one set of bidding documents bears the initials of all the BAC members present during the bid opening, while the 19 bid documents were not signed or initialed as required by the above-mentioned regulations. Thus, the integrity of the submitted documents for auditorial review and post audit may not be the same documents submitted by the participating bidders during the opening of bids.

The BAC was already informed of the need to initial or sign every page of the original copies of all bids received and opened, however, as of this date, the same was not complied with.



We recommended that Management require the BAC members present during the bid opening to initial each and every page of the bid documents received as required in the afore stated regulations to preserve the integrity of the bidding documents and to avoid the possible modification of bids.



Management Comment:



The BAC Chairman of CBSUA-Pili Campus, in his reply dated March 15, 2021, promised to comply with the recommendation.  However, the President, during the exit conference was requesting consideration on the recommendation.  He stated that the recommendation to initial each and every page of bid documents received during the bidding is time consuming.  The time devoted in signing the documents could be used for more productive endeavor of the BAC members.  



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



We understand the sentiment of the President, however, we stand firm on our recommendation.  We are only implementing the rules and regulations of the Revised IRR of RA No. 9184 on the procurement of goods and infrastructures as well as to preserve the integrity of the bidding documents and to avoid the possible modification of bids.





19)	CBSUA Sipocot and Calabanga Campuses did not impose liquidated damages totaling ₱170,009 to the suppliers who were not able to deliver the goods on time. Moreover, some Purchase Orders (PO) of Calabanga Campus did not indicate the date of delivery and/or date of receipt by the suppliers, hence, determination of the delays in delivery could not be established and application of liquidated damages could not be imposed.



Item 3 Annex D of 2016 IRR of RA No. 9184 states that: 



3.1 When the supplier fails to satisfactorily deliver goods under the contract within the specified delivery schedule, inclusive of duly granted time extensions, if any, the supplier shall be liable for damages for the delay and shall pay the procuring entity liquidated damages, not by way of penalty, an amount equal to one-tenth (1/10) of one percent (1%) of the cost of the delayed goods scheduled for delivery for every day of delay until such goods are finally delivered and accepted by the procuring entity concerned.



3.2. The procuring entity need not prove that it has incurred actual damages to be entitled to liquidated damages. Such amount shall be deducted from any money due or which may become due to the supplier, or collected from any securities or warranties posted by the supplier, whichever is convenient to the procuring entity concerned. In no case shall the total sum of liquidated damages exceed ten percent (10%) of the total contract price, in which event the procuring entity concerned may rescind the contract and impose appropriate sanctions over and above the liquidated damages to be paid. 



Also, Appendix 61 (Purchase Order - Instructions) of GAM for NGAs Volume II provides that: 



B. This form shall be accomplished as follows: 

              xxx 



6. Place/Date of Delivery – place of delivery and definite date/s of delivery; if not stated, the date of delivery shall mean seven (7) calendar days after the receipt of the PO by the supplier. 



Audit of the procurement of goods of CBSUA Sipocot and Calabanga Campuses for CY 2020 showed that liquidated damages of ₱147,425 and ₱22,583, respectively or a total of ₱170,009 were not properly imposed to the suppliers despite their inability to deliver the goods on time.  Delays in delivery ranged from five to 193 days for Sipocot Campus and six to 66 days for Calabanga Campus, despite considering the imposition of Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) and other circumstances relating to COVID-19 pandemic. Details are shown in Annex N.



Moreover, other deficiencies noted are discussed below:



For Calabanga Campus 



Further verification showed that the dates of delivery were not stated on several POs attached to the disbursement vouchers, therefore, as stated in the GAM for NGAs Volume II, the date of delivery shall mean seven days after the receipt of the PO by the supplier, however, said date was also not indicated on the PO. List of these POs is presented in Annex O.



Accordingly, determination of the delays in delivery could not be established since there is no reckoning date as to when shall the computation of delay will start, and therefore application of liquidated damages could not be imposed to the disadvantage of the Campus.



For Sipocot Campus



Although some payments to suppliers have been deducted with liquidated damages for late deliveries, re-computation thereof showed that the same was insufficient as to the correct amount of liquidated damages that should have been deducted. Examination showed that the Accountant only applied liquidated damages for those items not delivered within 30 days after receipt of the PO. This was also confirmed during the interview with the Supply Officer. He admitted that their basis of computing late deliveries was 30 days after receipt of PO by the supplier since no date of delivery was indicated in the PO. This is not in accordance with the instructions in accomplishing PO per Appendix 61 of GAM for NGAs Volume II which states that in case date of delivery is not stated in the PO, the latter shall mean seven calendar days after the receipt of the PO by the supplier. Moreover, in some cases, the Request for Quotation (RFQ) and/or Invitation to Bid (ITB) attached to the DVs indicate the delivery period of the items procured, hence, should have been the basis for computing liquidated damages. 



Non-imposition of liquidated damages and/or confusion in the computation thereof arises mainly due to the absence of date of delivery in the PO. It could have been easier to identify and compute liquidated damages if it was properly indicated. 



Furthermore, payment to a supplier with Check Nos. 835190 and 835191 amounting to ₱1.82 million was not subjected to liquidated damages despite delayed delivery of procured items. The supplier has no valid request for time extension duly granted by the University but only a letter dated September 16, 2020 requesting for consideration not to be imposed with liquidated damages.



We recommended that Management: 



a)	Ensure that all POs are properly filled up, indicate the date of delivery and/or properly acknowledged by the supplier with the date of receipt to easily determine the delay in delivery; 



b)	Follow the instructions in accomplishing the PO as provided in Appendix 61 (Purchase Order - Instructions) of the GAM for NGAs Volume II; and 



c)	Impose liquidated damages to all suppliers who were unable to deliver on time, in accordance with Item 3 Annex D of 2016 IRR of RA No. 9184. 



Management Comment:



In the letter reply to CBSUA-Sipocot AOM 2021-002 (2020) dated March 19, 2021, Management informed the Audit Team that during the last quarter of CY 2020, the Accountant and Supply Officer already discussed the issue and had started indicating the number of days to deliver and required the supplier to issue the necessary Delivery Receipt (DR).



For Calabanga Campus, in their letter reply dated February 26, 2021, the Supply Officer admitted her shortcomings, however, she justified that her leniency to impose liquidated damages was due to problems encountered during the onslaught of COVID-19 pandemic such as mobility and scarcity of goods. They promised to comply with the governing rules and regulations on procurement.  

  

Auditor’s Rejoinder:



We maintain our stand that the Accountant should impose liquidated damages to all suppliers who were not able to deliver on time.  Request for extension to deliver must be approved by the Campus Administrator before the supplier can be relieved from paying the liquidated damages.

Examination of the supporting documents attached to the DVs showed that the payments made by the University were not in accordance with the payment schedule provided in the TOR. 



For the first payment, the consultant submitted the Inception Report for the preparation of CBSUA Land Use Development and Investment Plan (LUDIP), conducted ocular inspection and imagery of the four campuses, and completed two workshops/meetings – Consultation Meeting cum Workshop on LUDIP on February 14-15, 2020 and two sessions of Committee Meeting on the crafting of CBSUA’s LUDIP on March 3, 2020. Hence, it has satisfied the required outputs to be able to be paid the first payment of 15 per cent or ₱123,000 of the contract price. However, review of the DV showed that the University already paid ₱125,000 to the consultant which is 15.24 percent of the contract price. 



Whereas for the subsequent payment, the consultant submitted the draft of Volume 1 and Volume 2 of the LUDIP manuscript and claimed 66.71 per cent or ₱0.55 million of the total contract price. Considering the deliverables required on the payment tranche of the TOR and based on the submitted documents, the consultant should have been paid only the additional 25 per cent since it was only able to submit the draft of Volume 1 and conduct two workshops which were already included on the accomplishments/attachments in the first payment. Although Volume 2 was already submitted, the consultant is required to complete a total of three workshops in order to be paid with another additional 25 per cent. 



Based on the attached Accomplishment Report and Request for Progress Payment, the consultant’s basis for computing the percentage of their accomplishment for the first and second payments was on the particulars provided in the PO, as presented in the table next page.

It can be gleaned that the deliverables in the TOR were not the same with the PO. However, the TOR clearly defined the scope of work required from the consultant as well as the time table of activities and payment tranche for the said consultancy services, hence, shall be the basis of determining the amount of payment due to the consultant. 



Consequently, the University paid more than the actual accomplishment by the consultant. Had the required output and payment schedule in the TOR been followed, the total amount paid to the consultant should have been ₱328,000 only or 40 per cent of the contract price, thus, there was an excess payment made of ₱344,000 from the ₱0.67 million actual disbursements. 



Furthermore, scrutiny of the Request for Quotations accomplished by the bidders and Abstract of Bids for the said consultancy services showed that Consultant A and Consultant B have the same bid price amounting to ₱0.82 million. However, the BAC did not attach any documents supporting its award to Consultant A despite having the same bid price with Consultant B, hence, casts doubt on the veracity of the procurement process. 



	We recommended that Management: 

	

a)		Ensure that all required deliverables were submitted/accomplished before the payment and strictly follow the payment schedule provided in the TOR for subsequent payments; and 

	

b)		Submit necessary documents supporting the basis for awarding the contract to Consultant A and not considering Consultant B despite having same bid amount.



Management Comment:



During the exit conference, Management justified that the basis of the payment was the accomplishment indicated in the PO and not the Payment Tranches found in the TOR.  They also informed the Audit Team that the project was already completed and turned over to the University. 



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



We maintain our stand that the payment in tranches stated in the TOR should be the basis for the payment since this is a Contract of Consultancy Services.  However, considering that the project was already completed, Management is forewarned not to commit the same error in the future. Management must see to it that the contract is in agreement with the TOR to avoid confusion during payment of claims.





21)	Procurement of consulting services for the design of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Competency Building and Resource Center Phase II for CBSUA-Sipocot Campus amounting to ₱0.99 million was not supported with complete documentation.



Sections 10 of 2016 Revised IRR of RA No. 9184 states that all procurement shall be done through competitive bidding, except as provided in Rule XVI of the said IRR.

Moreover, Section 9.1 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 provided the basic requirements for all types of procurement through public bidding, such as:

Verification of the supporting documents attached to the DVs on the aforementioned payments disclosed that the outputs or proofs that the consultant provided the services required under the contract were not included, contrary to Section 9.1.2 of COA Circular No. 2012-001. Relevant attachments relating to the services provided by the consultant include only the BAC Resolution recommending approval to award the construction of the project, and Physical Accomplishment Report prepared by said consultant wherein per observation, the contents are the same. These documents, however, are not sufficient alternatives of the outputs required in the contract. Moreover, the following necessary documents were not attached showing that the BAC complied with the requirements of conducting public bidding and awarding contract to an eligible supplier, to wit:



				a)	Terms of Reference

a)	Minutes of Pre-Bid Conference

b)	Minutes of Bid Opening

c)	Abstract of Bids

d)	Post –Qualification Report

e)	Performance Security

f)	Copy of advertisement of Invitation to Bid/Request for expression of interest

i)	Ranking of short listed bidders for consulting services

j)	Printout copy of posting of Notice of Award, Notice to Proceed and Contract of Award in the PhilGEPS

With the foregoing, the awarded contract and payments made to the consultant were doubtful and affected the validity and regularity of the transactions pertaining thereto.



We recommended that Management submit all lacking supporting documents as enumerated above to support the payment and awarding of contract for the procurement of the said consulting services, to avoid possible suspension thereof in audit.



Management Comment:



The Campus Administrator of CBSUA–Sipocot avowed to submit the lacking documents as soon as possible. 





22)	Disbursements relative to the procurement of goods and infrastructure projects amounting to ₱32.78 million were not adequately supported with the required documents.



One of the fundamental principles governing the financial transactions and operations of any government agency under Section 4(6) of PD No. 1445 is that all claims against government funds shall be supported with complete documentation. 



Pertinent provisions of the 2016 Revised IRR of RA No. 9184 are quoted as follows:



Section 20. Pre-procurement Conference



20.1. Prior to the advertisement or the issuance of the Invitation to Bid/Request for Expression of Interest for each procurement undertaken through a competitive bidding, the BAC, through its Secretariat, shall call for a pre-procurement conference. The pre-procurement conference shall be attended by the BAC, the Secretariat, the unit or officials, including consultants hired by the Procuring Entity, who prepared the Bidding Documents and the draft Invitation to Bid/Request for Expression of Interest for each procurement. xxx



20.2. The holding of a pre-procurement conference may not be required for small procurements, i.e., procurement of Goods costing Two Million Pesos (₱2,000,000.00) and below, procurement of Infrastructure Projects costing Five Million Pesos (₱5,000,000.00) and below, and procurement of Consulting Services costing One Million Pesos (₱1,000,000.00) and below. 



 	 xxx



Section 22. Pre-bid Conference 



22.1. For contracts to be bid with an ABC of One Million Peso (₱1,000,000.00) or more, the BAC shall convene at least one (1) pre-bid conference to clarify and/or explain any of the requirements, terms, conditions, and specifications stipulated in the Bidding Documents. For contracts to be bid with an ABC of less than One Million Pesos (₱1,000,000), pre-bid conferences may be conducted at the discretion of the BAC. Subject to the approval of the BAC, a pre-bid conference may also be conducted upon written request of any prospective bidder. 



 	xxx



Section 23. Eligibility Requirements for the Procurement of Goods and Infrastructure Projects 



23.1. For purposes of determining the eligibility of bidders using the criteria stated in Section 23.4 of this IRR, only the following documents shall be required by the BAC, using the forms prescribed in the Bidding Documents: 



a)	a) Class “A” Documents 

Legal Documents 

	i)	Registration certificate from SEC, Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) for sole proprietorship, or CDA for cooperatives. 

	ii)	Mayor’s/Business permit issued by the city or municipality where the principal place of business of the prospective bidder is located, or the equivalent document for Exclusive Economic Zones or Areas xxx 

	iii)	Tax clearance per E.O. 398, s. 2005, as finally reviewed and approved by the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR). 



Moreover, Section 9.1 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 provides the documentary requirements for all types of procurement through public bidding: 



Basic Requirements: 

xxx



--		Evidence of Invitation of three observers in all stages of the procurement process pursuant to Section 13.1 of the Revised IRR of RA No. 9184 



9.1.1 Infrastructure 



--	Letter Request from contractors for advance/progress/final payment or for substitution in case of release of retention money 

--	Common to progress/final payments 

xxx

o Monthly Certificate of Payment 

o Contractor's Affidavit on payment of laborers and materials 

o Photocopy of vouchers of all previous payments 



9.1.1.4 Final Payment 

xxx

--	Warranty security 



9.1.3 Goods 

9.1.3.1 Supplies, Materials, Equipment and Motor Vehicles 

     		xxx

--		For Equipment, Property Acknowledgment Receipt 



Audit of disbursements relative to the procurement of goods and infrastructure projects procured through competitive bidding disclosed that they were not supported with complete documentation, contrary to the above-cited criteria. Details of the transactions amounting to ₱32.78 million are shown in Annex P. 



As presented in the said Annex, the most common required documents that were not submitted are the following: 



	a)	Minutes of Pre-procurement Conference 

	b)	Minutes of Pre-bid conference 

	c)	Registration certificate from SEC, DTI for sole proprietorship, or CDA for cooperatives 

	d)	Mayor’s/Business permit 

	e)	Tax clearance per E.O. 398, s. 2005, as finally reviewed and approved by the BIR 

	f)	Evidence of Invitation to 3 observers in all stages of the procurement process 

	g)	Official receipts (OR) 

	h)	Property Acknowledgment Receipt (PAR) 

	i)	Contractor’s Affidavit on payment of laborers and materials 

	j)	Photocopy of vouchers of all previous payments 

	k)	Warranty Security (for the procurement of infrastructure projects only) 



The absence of the foregoing documents cast doubt on the propriety of the procurement process conducted by the University and regularity of the payments made thereof. 



We recommended that Management submit the lacking documents of the disbursements as presented on the attached Annex P. Henceforth, ensure that all succeeding disbursements are supported with complete documentation in accordance with the Revised IRR of RA No. 9184 and COA Circular No. 2012-001.



Management Comment:



Management agreed with our recommendation.  The Accountant averred that some of the lacking documents are already ready for submission.





23)	The University was unable to submit to Philippine Commission on Women (PCW) an adjusted and revised CY 2020 Gender and Development (GAD) Plan and Budget that are more COVID 19 responsive, thus, 48.84 per cent of the GAD Programs, Activities and Projects (PAPs) were not implemented.



PCW Memorandum Circular (MC) No. 2020-03 provides:



1.0 Rationale

xxx

1.2 Due to the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), the President issued Proclamation Nos. 922 and 929 declaring a State of Public Health Emergency and, consequently, a State of Calamity throughout the Philippines. Section 2 of Proclamation No. 922 and Section 3 of Proclamation No. 929 enjoin all government agencies “to render full assistance to and cooperation with each other and mobilize the necessary resources to undertake critical, urgent, and appropriate disaster response aid and measures in a timely manner to curtail and eliminate the threat of COVID-19.



xxx



1.4 National Budget Circular No. 580, dated 22 April 2020, provides the possible measures for the discontinuance of appropriated programs, activities and projects (PPAs) of the National Government, including State Universities and Colleges (SUCs), and Government-Owned or – Controlled Corporations (GOCCs) receiving budgetary appropriation authorized under the FYs 2019 and 2020 GAAs, to fund the operations and response measures related to the COVID-19 emergency situation.



xxx



4.1 All national government agencies and instrumentalities are enjoined to review and revise, as necessary, their FY 2020 Gender and Development (GAD) Plan and Budget (GPB) to implement measures to address gender issues and concerns arising from the unequal status of their women and men stakeholders due to the COVID- 19 situation. Such measures should be in line with their respective agency mandates, Republic Act No. 9710 or the Magna Carta of Women and the Bayanihan to Heal As One Act.



Review of the submitted GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) for CY 2020 disclosed that the University was not able to submit to PCW an adjusted and revised GPB that is more aligned with addressing the COVID-19 disease situation, thus, was unable to utilize most of their GAD Budget to prioritize GAD PAPs that are more inclined in tackling gender-related issues and concerns brought by the COVID 19 situation and rendering almost half of the GAD PAPs infeasible due to the pandemic, thus, were unaccomplished.



Based on the submitted GPB and GAD Accomplishment Report (AR), it can be gleaned that:



			a)	The University was able to formulate 86 GAD PAPs, university-wide. However, only 42 or 48.84 percent of the 86 were accomplished. Forty-two or 48.84 percent were not undertaken due to COVID 19 restrictions and two or 2.33 percent were not accomplished because of other reasons.



			b)	Per submitted GPB, only one is aligned with the PCW MC, that is:



--	Item No. 63: “Representation and Participation of Women in Policy Making on Decision Making Bodies”

			c)		However, in the GAD AR, another two (2) GAD PAPs were renamed in the efforts to conform with the PCW MC mandate, to wit:

	

--	Item No. 6: Seminar/Webinar on Violence Against Women and other Gender- Related Laws Amidst the Pandemic

--	Item No. 11: Webinar on Coping with Psychological Challenges of New Normal



			d)	All of the three aforementioned GAD PAPs were accomplished.



			e)		Also, the submitted GPB does not provide for measures to ensure that women and men stakeholders are informed of the actions instituted or programs offered by the agency to prevent and respond to the COVID-19 situation.



The GAD Focal person profess that the reason for the non-submission of an adjusted or revised GPB is that they were not able to submit within the deadline given by the PCW MC under item 4.4 which was until July 1, 2020. However, they were able to conform with item 4.5 of the PCW MC which is to reflect all changes made in the original FY 2020 GPB e.g., cancellation/postponement of a GAD activity due to the Enhanced Community Quarantine in their GAD AR.



The absence of a well-defined and GAD PAPs which are aligned with gender-related issues and concerns related to COVID 19 situation defeat the very intent and purpose of the above cited issuances in pursuance of gender equality and women’s empowerment and protection amid the pandemic.



Had the University adjusted and revised their GAD Plan and Budget in accordance with the PCW MC, more GAD PAPs that will address gender-related issues and concerns that are more COVID 19 responsive could have been implemented.



We recommended that Management:



						a)	Strictly adhere with Section 4.1 of PCW MC No. 2020-03 to ensure that GAD PAPs of the Agency are in consonance with undertakings of the government relative to the COVID-19 disease situation; and



						b)	Formulate coherent, well-define and specific activities that are responsive to the call of the times and will meet the standards and criteria specified in the guidelines set forth above.



Management Comment:



Management was amenable with the recommendation.  The GAD Focal Person had tried to revise the GPB in accordance with PCW MC No. 2020-03 but they were not able to submit it on time.  





24)	Taxes withheld were not remitted in full and within the reglementary period to the BIR.



BIR Revenue Memorandum Circular (RMC) No. 57-2014 dated July 15, 2014 provides the prescribed period in the filing of applicable tax returns, as follows:

Evaluation and analysis of the preceding table showed that withheld taxes are not remitted in full within the reglementary period. This is evidenced by the lesser amount of tax remittance for the beginning balance as well as the monthly remittance for the current year’s tax withheld amounts during the months of February, March, May, June, August, and October. For the other months, tax remittance had already exceeded the tax withheld, however, it still registered carried over unremitted balances from the previous months.



Inquiry also with the campus Accountants disclosed that out of the ₱7.57 million ending balance, only ₱6.64 million was remitted in January 2021 leaving a balance of unremitted amount of ₱0.92 million. Breakdown for each campus is as follows:

The foregoing practice is not in accordance with the BIR regulations and as a result thereof, government funds are exposed to possible misuse and the National Government is deprived of the immediate use of funds beneficial to the general public. 



We recommended that Management require the Accountant to: 



a)	Remit all withheld taxes to the BIR in accordance with the schedules of remittances provided under BIR RMC No. 57-2014 to avoid penalties and surcharges; and



b)	Reconcile the balance of the Due to BIR account, prepare adjusting entries, if warranted, and/or remit immediately to the BIR any unremitted balances from prior years to avoid further penalties and surcharges. 



Management Comment:



During the exit conference, Management promised to comply with the recommendations.

The Accountant of Sipocot Campus stated that they will render overtime in order to reconcile the balance of the Due to BIR account and prepare the necessary adjusting entries to have an accurate report of the account.



The Accountant of Calabanga Campus also informed the Audit Team that the unremitted amount pertains to prior year’s balances which cannot be remitted due to unavailability of source documents to determine the name of the payor, income payment and the tax rate.  Nevertheless, she admitted that this should not be an excuse not to remit the taxes withheld as required by law.





Compliance with GSIS Property Insurance Law



25)	The CBSUA insured their insurable PPEs with the GSIS pursuant to RA No. 656, as amended by PD No. 245.  Please see Annexes R, R-1 and R-2 for the List of PPEs insured for CY 2020 for the CBSUA-Main, Calabanga and Sipocot Campuses. 





COVID-19 Related Receipts and Disbursements



26)	The grant of ₱1.01 million COVID-19 Hazard Pay to CBSUA Main and Sipocot Campuses employees without the written authority from the head of agency, not evidenced by DTRs, and charging a portion thereof to the Internally Generated Fund amounting ₱151,500 were contrary to existing rules and regulations.



Sec. 5.8 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 provides the guidelines and documentary requirements in the payment of hazard pay. Among the documentary requirements enumerated therein are the written authority by the head of the agency, duly accomplished time record of employees and approved DTR/Service Report.



Section 2(b) of Administrative Order No. 26 and Section 4.3 of DBM Budget Circular No. 1 dated March 23, 2020 states that the heads of government agencies may grant the COVID-19 Hazard Pay to their personnel/workers without the need for further approval by the DBM provided the personnel/workers have been authorized to physically report for work at their respective offices or work stations on the prescribed official working hours by the head of agency/office during the period of implementation of Enhanced Community Quarantine measures in the area of such office or work station.

Among the guidelines and conditions on the grant were set forth under Section 4.0 of the DBM Budget Circular No. 1 which states that:



“4.0 Guidelines and Conditions on the Grant of the COVID-19 Hazard Pay

The heads of government agencies may grant the COVID-19 Hazard Pay to their personnel/workers without the need for further approval by the DBM, subject to the following guidelines and conditions:



xxx



	1)	The personnel/workers have been authorized to physically report for work at their respective offices or work stations on the prescribed official working hours by the head of agency/office during the period of implementation of Enhanced Community Quarantine measures in the area of such office or work station.”



On March 16, 2020, the President issued Proclamation No. 929 declaring a state of calamity throughout the Philippines due to corona virus disease 2019 and imposing enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) throughout Luzon beginning March 17 until April 13, 2020. The imposition of ECQ was then extended by the President until April 30, 2020.



Verification of documents relative to the payment of COVID-19 hazard pay of CBSUA Main and Sipocot Campuses disclosed that employees whether permanent, casual and job orders who physically reported for work during the implementation of the ECQ in the province from March 17 to April 30, 2020 were granted hazard pay in the amount of ₱500 per day amounting to ₱0.93 million and ₱78,500, respectively, or a total of ₱1.01 million. However, further verification of the related transactions revealed that:



For Main Campus



There were three casual employees who physically reported to work during the period of implementation of ECQ without written authority by their heads of office to physically report for work but were paid COVID-19 hazard pay, viz:

₱8,500.00





Our audit also revealed that the total COVID-19 hazard pay disbursed by the CBSUA Main Campus amounted to ₱0.93 million covering the period from March 17 to April 30, 2020 taken from the following funds:



Regular Agency Fund (Fund 101)

₱          782,650.00

Internally Generated Fund (Fund 164)  

            151,500.00

Total

₱          934,150.00



The breakdown of the total COVID-19 hazard pay per fund is found in Annex S.



As shown in the table, the CBSUA Main Campus had partially charged the payment of hazard pay to Fund 164 contrary to the provisions on the funding source for the grant in accordance with AO No. 26 and DBM BC No. 1 which provides that the amount required for personnel occupying regular, contractual or casual positions shall be charged against their available released Personnel Services (PS) allotments, while the amount required for COS or JO workers shall be charged against their available released Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE) allotments, without need for prior authority from the DBM, provided that all authorized mandatory expenses shall have been paid first. Should an NGA or SUC have insufficient PS or MOOE allotments, as the case may be, to fully cover the COVID-19 Hazard Pay at the rate of ₱500/day per person, a lower but uniform rate may be granted for all qualified personnel.



For Sipocot Campus



For CY 2020, CBSUA-Sipocot Campus disbursed a total of ₱78,500 for the payment of hazard pay to its 23 employees who physically reported for work during the implementation of the ECQ in the province from March 17 to April 30, 2020.



During the course of audit, it was noted that the related transactions have the following deficiencies:



	a)	several employees were granted COVID 19 hazard pay even without the required written authority by their heads of office to physically report for work;

	b)	absence of DTRs to evidence their attendance to work;

	c)	an employee was paid hazard pay more than the actual days he reported for worked; and

	d)	an employee was granted hazard pay for the day worked prior to the effectivity date of the declared ECQ.



The details of the noted deficiencies are presented in Annex T.



The grant of hazard pay to the CBSUA Main Campus and Sipocot Campus employees who reported for work without the written authority of their heads of office and are not evidenced by DTRs and charging the amount of ₱151,500 of CBSUA Main Campus from Fund 164 were not in pursuance to the aforementioned provision of COA Circular No. 2012-001 and the guidelines and conditions set forth by AO No. 26 and DBM Budget Circular No. 1, thereby, casting doubt on the propriety and validity of the transaction. 



We recommended that Management strictly adhere with pertinent issuances relative to COVID-19 particularly on the grant of hazard pay to avoid possible suspension and/or disallowance thereof in audit. Likewise, submission of the lacking supporting documents as shown in Annex T is required to facilitate audit disposition.







Management Comment:



Management explained that the authority to report from the Head of the Agency of the three casual employees was inadvertently not attached to the DV for the payment of their hazard pay.  Nonetheless, these employees were really required to report to work during the ECQ to do some urgent tasks which cannot be done at home like the online encoding and submission of the 1st Quarter BFARS in the Unified Reporting System (URS), assisted in processing of claims, and a driver who conveyed the personnel who were physically required to report to work due to unavailability of public transport.



In the reply letter dated April 12, 2021, Management of CBSUA Sipocot assured the Audit Team that they will comply with the recommendations.





Programs on Awards and Incentives for Service Excellence (PRAISE) and Collective Negotiation Agreement (CNA)



27)	The grant of cash incentive under the PRAISE to its employees amounting to ₱8.23 million was not in accordance with its implementing guidelines. 



CBSUA Implementing Guidelines for the grant of productivity incentives/career and self-development incentives under the PRAISE, provides that: 



“This is an annual, across-the-board cash incentive that shall be given to CBSUA personnel on permanent, temporary or casual/contractual status/job order whose wages are drawn from government appropriation or internally generated income (special trust fund).

1. Incentives- Entitlement 



A)	A. Economic Compensation Benefits – shall be given to every individual employee (teaching or non-teaching personnel) who is instrumental in achieving the annual target of the University with the adoption of cost-cutting and saving measures that lower down the expenses of the University but still achieved the expected annual targets and output.

Sources of Funds – Available savings of the University from Personnel Services of the General Appropriations Act will be utilized in the implementation of this program. (Emphasis supplied)” 



During the conduct of 4th Quarter Regular Board Meeting on November 26, 2020, the members of the Board of Regents issued Resolution No. 68, Series of 2020 approving the grant of cash incentive under the PRAISE to qualified employees of CBSUA, subject to the submission of the Revised IRR of the PRAISE and the List of PRAISE grantees. 



Said resolution was approved on the ground that based on the Civil Service Commission (CSC) approved CBSUA PRAISE Manual, which provides that Economic Compensation Benefits shall be given to every individual employee (teaching or non-teaching personnel) who is instrumental in achieving the annual target of the University with the adoption of cost-cutting and saving measures that lower down the expenses of the University but still achieved the expected annual targets and outputs. Whereas, the University has accomplished an average of more than 70 per cent of all performance targets specified under the FY 2020 Program Expenditure Classification (PREXC). 



Additionally, the resolution provides that the incentive shall be distributed to the four delivering units – CBSUA Pili, Calabanga, Sipocot and Pasacao Campuses, based on the met targets per PREXC 2020, to wit:

In compliance with the resolution, CBSUA submitted its Revised IRR of the PRAISE and the list of its grantees and adhered with the incentive payment scheme provided thereto. 



Accordingly, the CBSUA – Main (Pili and Pasacao) Campus disbursed a total of ₱8.23 million for the grant of cash incentive under the PRAISE to its employees, as presented below:

However, during the audit of these disbursements, the following audit observations were noted: 



				a)	Implementing guidelines of PRAISE provides that payment for the said incentive shall be sourced from the available savings of the University from Personnel Services of the GAA. However, it can be gleaned from the table above that disbursements for the grant of PRAISE were funded out of Fund 164 or IGF, contrary to the above stated provisions of the IRR for PRAISE. 



Moreover, it was also noted that there were no supporting documents specifying that there were available savings from Personnel Services of the GAA. Instead, a Certificate of Availability of Savings in the allowable MOOE allotments in FY 2020 was attached. Further examination showed that this certification was issued for the purpose of giving CNA incentive to the employees of the University. 



Thus, the inability of Management to provide proof that there were available savings from Personnel Services of the GAA and its erroneous utilization of Fund 164-IGF in the implementation of the program, affected the propriety and regularity of the payment. 



				b)	Based on the attached PREXC, the following were the ranks of each campus and the amount of incentive the employees assigned thereto were entitled:

However, the Audit Team was precluded from verifying the veracity and basis of accomplishments reported on the said PREXC as there were no documents submitted in support thereof.



				c)	Memorandum No. 12-221 was issued by the University President ordering that only employees who submitted their respective Office/Individual Performance Commitment and Review (OPCR/IPCR) shall be included in the processing of PRAISE benefits.

Examination of the preceding table shows that three casual employees from Pasacao Campus were given ₱30,000 each as their incentive, however, based on the targets met, Pasacao Campus employees were only entitled to ₱20,000 as they only achieved 76% - 100% of their target. Hence, an excess payment of ₱10,000 per employee or a total of ₱30,000 was made, and therefore subject for refund. 



Furthermore, examination also revealed that the University excluded those employees with unsigned and unsubmitted IPCR/OPCR from the grant. However, there were two employees from Research Services who were still granted with PRAISE for ₱30,000 each or a total of ₱60,000, despite their unsigned IPCRs, thus, should also be refunded. 



Due to the observations discussed above, regularity of the grant of PRAISE incentive to the University’s officials and employees has been compromised. 



We recommended that Management require the three casual employees from Pasacao Campus and two employees from Research Service Personnel to refund the excess/incentives received amounting to ₱90,000.



Likewise, submission of the following documents is required to facilitate audit disposition; otherwise, this warrant the issuance of Notice of Suspension/Disallowance: 



a)	Proof that there were available savings from Personnel Services of the GAA in FY 2020; 



b)			Valid justification on the utilization of Fund 164 instead of GAA for the payment of said incentive; and

		

c)		Supporting documents on the achievement of targets as shown on the PREXC. 



Management Comment:



Management was amenable to comply with the recommendations.  They informed the Audit Team that three employees of Pasacao Campus who were paid more than the allowable PRAISE for the campus already refunded the excess benefit and they will submit the required supporting documents.





28)	Disbursements relative to the payment of CNA to CBSUA Pili and Pasacao Campuses’ employees amounting to ₱7.55 million were not adequately supported with the required documents.



One of the fundamental principles governing the financial transactions and operations of any government agency under Section 4(6) of PD No. 1445 is that all claims against government funds shall be supported with complete documentation. 



Section 5.16 of COA Circular 2012-001 provides the following documentary requirements for the payment of CNA:



--	Resolution signed by both parties incorporating the guidelines/criteria for granting CNA Incentive

--	Comparative statement of DBM approved level operating expenses and actual operating expenses

--	Copy of CNA

--	Certificate issued by the Head of the Agency on the total amount of unencumbered savings generated from cost-cutting measures identified in the CNA which resulted from the joint efforts of labor and management and systems/productivity/income improvement

--	Proof that the planned programs/activities/projects have been implemented and completed in accordance with targets for the year

						a)	Comparative statement of DBM approved level operating expenses and actual operating expenses; 

			a)	Copy of CNA; and 

			b)	Proof that the planned programs/activities/projects have been implemented and completed in accordance with targets for the year. 



The absence of the foregoing documents cast doubt on the regularity of the payments made and may warrant the issuance of Notice of suspension/disallowance. 



We recommended that Management submit the lacking documents for the   disbursements made. Henceforth, ensure that all succeeding disbursements are supported with complete documentation in accordance with COA Circular No. 2012-001 to avoid possible suspension/disallowance of the transaction.



Management Comment:



Management avowed to submit the required documents the soonest time possible.





Other Areas



29)	The University granted monthly communication allowance of ₱2,000 to each of the members of the Board of Regents and the Board Secretary amounting to ₱214,000 in CY 2020, without legal basis.



Section 4(1) of PD No. 1445 provides that: 



“No money shall be paid out of any public treasury or depository except in pursuance of an appropriation law or other specific statutory authority.”



Section 5.3 of the National Budget Circular (NBC) No. 2007-510- Guidelines on the Grant of Honoraria to the Governing Boards of Collegial Bodies also states that: 



“5.0 Guidelines 



5.1 Chairs, vice-chairs and members of governing boards of collegial bodies who hold such positions in ex-officio capacities, and are neither paid salaries nor per diems, or any other form of compensation, may be granted honoraria if provided for by laws. 



xxx



5.3 They shall not be allowed other benefits, whether in cash or in kind, on top of the honoraria, except when specifically provided for by law.” 



Audit of the CY 2020 transactions showed that the University granted communication allowance to all members of the Board of Regents and the Board Secretary at ₱2,000 per month. The total disbursements incurred during the year 2020 amounted to ₱214,000 with the following details:

Verification of documents disclosed that the basis of the payment of the said communication allowance was CBSUA Board of Regents Board Resolution No. 17, Series of 2018, which authorized the grant of monthly communication allowance of ₱2,000 to the members of the Board of Regents and the Board Secretary. 



However, perusal of said Board Resolution disclosed that it is self-serving. The Resolution cannot be a legal basis for such benefit unless there is a specific law that grants communication allowance to the Board of Regents of Universities. It is clear from the provision of Section 5.3 of the NBC No. 2007-510 that the Board shall not be allowed other benefits, whether in cash or in kind, on top of the honoraria, except when specifically provided for by law. 



Thus, the payment of the communication allowance is contrary to the above stated regulations, hence, considered as illegal expenditures. 



We recommended that Management refrain from granting/paying communication allowance and other similar benefits to the members of the Board of Regents and the Board Secretary unless there is a specific law or authority thereof. Also, require said officials to refund subject allowance paid to them in CY 2020.



Management Comment:



During the exit conference, Management promised to comply with our recommendation.  However, they averred that never has it been the intent of the BOR Resolution to treat the amount authorized therein as emolument or additional compensation but as reimbursement of communication expenses of the recipients.



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



Management is advised to refrain from giving benefits in the form of an allowance to the Board of Regents and the Board Secretary unless there is a specific law authorizing such grant. 





30)	Payment of BAC honoraria to BAC Members, Secretariat and TWG amounting to ₱188,800 was not in compliance with DBM Budget Circular No. 2004-5A as amended by DBM Circular No. 2007-03.



Section 3.0 of DBM Circular No. 2007-03 amending DBM Budget Circular NO. 2004-5A states that:



	3.1 The amount necessary for payment of honoraria and overtime pay authorized under BC No. 2004-5A dated October 7, 2005 shall be sourced from the following:



3.1.1 Collections from successfully completed procurement projects limited, however, to activities prior to awarding of contracts to winning bidders:



• Proceeds from sale of bid documents;

• Fees from contractor/supplier registry;

• Fees charged for copies of minutes of bid openings, BAC resolutions and other BAC documents;

• Protest fees; and,

• Proceeds from bid security forfeiture.



3.1.2 Savings realized from the current year specific budget of the agency under the General Appropriations Act (GAA).



xxx



3.2 Savings refer to portions or balances of agencies’ budgets as referred to in items 3.1.2, 3.1.3 and 3.1.4 above, free from any obligation of encumbrance which are:



3.2.1 still available after the completion or final discontinuance or abandonment of the work, activity or purpose for which the appropriation is authorized;



3.2.2 arising from unpaid compensation and related costs pertaining to vacant positions and leaves of absences without pay; and,



3.2.3 realized from the implementation of collective negotiation agreements which resulted in improved systems and efficiencies and thus enabled an agency to meet and deliver the required or planned targets, programs and services at lesser cost.



xxx



3.5 In cases of deficiency in collections from procurement activities and non-availability of agency savings, the amount of honoraria and overtime pay shall be adjusted proportionately for all those entitled thereto.



The University granted honoraria to its BAC Members, Secretariat and TWG (including Special TWG) totaling ₱188,800 for the period September 2019 to September 2020 by way of cash advance under Check No. 685991.



Perusal of the documents attached thereto revealed that the BAC members, secretariat and its regular TWG have successfully awarded seven projects procured through competitive bidding to its winning bidders, one of which was awarded in September 2019 while the remaining six were awarded from the period January to December 2020. As shown in the payroll, the amount due as honoraria for the projects in 2019 and 2020 were ₱21,000 and ₱126,000, respectively, or a total of ₱147,000.



There was also an unpaid balance of honoraria from the previous payment in August 2019 due to insufficient fund amounting to ₱65,943. Consequently, this was added to the amount due for payment in September 2020. Additionally, the members of the special TWG were granted honoraria totaling ₱12,000 for one successfully completed procurement project within the covered period in CY 2020. Thus, the total amount payable as honoraria for the BAC amounted to ₱224,943.

Conversely, the campus has collected ₱2,500 in September to December 2019, and ₱186,300 in January to September 2020, aggregating to ₱188,800, from the sale of bidding documents and registration fee from contractors/suppliers.



Since the said collection of ₱188,800 was lesser than the total amount payable of ₱224,943, the campus prioritized the full payment of honoraria to the members of special TWG amounting to ₱12,000 while the remaining balance from the collection amounting to ₱176,800 was pro-rated among the BAC members, secretariat and regular TWG.



The foregoing practice of the Campus, was not in compliance with the above-stated criteria. Unpaid balance in August 2019 due to insufficient fund should have not been added to the payment for the current year. If proceeds from collections from procurement activities were not sufficient, the campus should have sourced from savings of that year’s specific budget under the GAA, if any, to augment their funding source to be able to pay the said honoraria. In case there is still deficiency, payment thereof should not be prioritized to any member of the BAC but rather be given proportionately to all those entitled thereto in accordance with Section 3.5 of the same Circular.  Moreover, forwarding the deficiency/unpaid amount of honoraria for the prior year onto the next payment sourced from the succeeding year’s collections is not allowed per above cited guidelines, hence, subject to possible disallowance in audit.



Also, payment for the period September to December 2019 amounting to ₱21,000 should have been sourced from the collections and savings from CY 2019 GAA, if any, and be paid proportionally among the BAC members, secretariat and TWG at the end of CY 2019.



Had the unpaid balance of honoraria as of August 2019 and honoraria for the remaining months of CY 2019 not been added in the total amount due in September 2020, the actual collections of ₱186,300 would have been sufficient to pay the total amount due in CY 2020 of ₱126,000.



We recommended that Management stop the aforementioned practices and strictly adhere with the guidelines on granting BAC honoraria as stipulated in DBM Budget Circular No. 2004-5A as amended by DBM Circular No. 2007-03 to avoid possible disallowance in audit.



Management Comment:



Management was amenable with the recommendation.





31)	The Monthly Report of Official Travels and Monthly Report of Fuel Consumptions of 24 motor vehicles owned by the University were continuously not being prepared and submitted to the Office of the Auditor.



COA Circular No. 77-61 dated September 26, 1977, otherwise known as the Manual of Consumption of Fuel of Government Vehicles, provides that:

Section 2. The use of government vehicles should be controlled through properly accomplished and duly approved Driver’s Trip tickets which shall be serially numbered, a summary of which shall be made at the end of the month in a Monthly Report of Official Travels for audit purposes.



Section 3. Fuel consumption of government motor transportations shall be properly controlled and accounted for through the approved Requisition and Issue Vouchers or its equivalent.



Section 4. Monthly Report of Fuel Consumption of government motor transportation shall be submitted to the auditor for verification purposes to determine the reasonableness of the fuel consumption during the period.



The University owned a total of 24 motor vehicles wherein 20 were in Main Campus and four were in Sipocot Campus (see Annex U). However, the Monthly Report of Official Travels of these 24 motor vehicles were continuously not prepared and submitted to the Office of the Auditor as required under the above-cited circular despite prior year’s similar recommendation. The report shall be prepared by the Driver concerned summarizing in chronological order the trips for the month for each vehicle, certified correct by the Driver and approved by the Administrative Officer.



Similarly, the Monthly Report of Fuel Consumption was not prepared and submitted by the agency personnel to the Audit Team for verification purposes. The report shall show among others, the following:



	a)	The different type of motor vehicles utilized by the agency during the month;

	b)	The total distance travelled;

	c)	The total fuel used; and

	d)	The normal fuel consumption for each type of vehicle.



The report must be prepared in three copies by the agency personnel concerned and shall be verified by the Auditor.



The inability of the University to prepare and submit the required reports precluded the Audit Team from verifying the correctness, propriety and validity of the claims for fuel, oil and lubricants, as well as the proper use of government vehicles.



This audit observation was already discussed with Management and included in the previous audit report for the University, however, as of this writing, compliance is still wanting.



We recommended that Management require the responsible agency personnel to comply with the preparation and submission of the Monthly Report of Official Travels and Report of Fuel Consumption in consonance with the abovementioned COA Circular on the Utilization of Government Motor Vehicles.



Management Comment:



Management was receptive of the recommendation.  They informed the Audit Team that an employee was already assigned to prepare the report.



The Accountant of Sipocot Campus also stated that they have an existing report but not in the proper form and they were not able to furnish the Office of the Audit Team Leader.



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



The Motor pool in-charge had submitted the report for the period January to June 2020, however, the same will be validated if all the information incorporated in the said report is compliant with COA Circular 77-61.





32)	Copies of the Contracts/Purchase Orders together with their supporting documents were not submitted within the prescribed period.



COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009 is a restatement of COA Circular 87-278 and COA Memorandum 2005-027 regarding the submission of copy of government contracts, purchase orders and their supporting documents to the Commission on Audit within five (5) days after the perfection thereof for review and evaluation.



Section 3.1.1 thereof states that:



“Within five (5) working days from the execution of a contract by the government or any of its subdivisions, agencies or instrumentalities, including government-owned and controlled corporations and their subsidiaries, a copy of said contract and each of all the documents forming part thereof by reference or incorporation shall be furnished to the Auditor of the agency concerned. xxx”



Likewise, Section 3.2.1 of the same Circular further states that:

“A copy of any purchase order irrespective of amount, and each and every supporting document, shall, within five (5) working days from issuance thereof, be submitted to the Auditor concerned. xxx.”



Furthermore, Section 4.1 of the same Circular provides that:



“Any unjustified failure of the officials and employees concerned to comply with the requirements herein imposed shall be subject to the administrative disciplinary action provided in (a) Section 127 of PD No. 1445; (b) Section 55, Title I-B, Book V of the Revised Administrative Code of 1987; and (c) Section 11 of Republic Act No. 6713.”



Notwithstanding the above provisions, we have noted that contracts/purchase orders and their supporting documents of Main Campus and Sipocot Campus were not submitted to the Audit Team within the period of five days from the date of perfection or issuance. Our records revealed that out of the total 504 contracts/purchase orders submitted from January to December 2020, 317 or 63 percent were submitted beyond the prescribed period. Shown below is the breakdown of submission by the two campuses, while the Summary of Contracts/Purchase Orders submitted from January 1 to December 31, 2020 for each campus is shown in Annex V.

A glance at the table above also unveiled that the delay in the submission of contracts/purchase orders ranges from one to 265 days for Main Campus and one to 426 days for Sipocot Campus. 



Non-compliance with the rules and regulations stated above precluded the Auditor from the timely evaluation of the transactions as to their conformity with applicable laws, rules and regulations, completeness of documentary requirements and an initial evaluation that the contractual covenants are not disadvantageous to the government.



We recommended that Management require the Supply Officer and Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) Secretariat to submit contracts/purchase orders together with the supporting documents within the prescribed period for the timely review and evaluation thereof and to avoid the imposition of the administrative sanctions provided under the said circular.



Management Comment:



Management, thru the BAC Chairman promised to comply with the recommendation during the ensuing year. However, he justified that their inability to strictly comply with the prescribed period to submit the documents was due to some problems encountered by the Office, such as difficulty to educate the end-users to observe the procurement procedures embodied in the Revised IRR of RA No. 9184, missing or misplaced documents for infrastructure projects and difficulty in sending and retrieving documents from suppliers due to COVID-19 pandemic.

In the letter reply dated March 24, 2021, Management of CBSUA-Sipocot justified that almost all of the Purchase Orders issued in CY 2020 were submitted on time.

Auditor’s Rejoinder:



The contention of the CBSUA-Sipocot Management with respect to PO issued in CY 2020 is acceptable, however, they have not considered that the subject of our audit observation were all the POs received by the Commission during the year whether issued in CY 2019 or in CY 2020.  





Status of Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges



33)	Audit suspensions totaling ₱60.43 million were not settled within 90 days resulting in their maturity into disallowance, while disallowances that have become final and executory totaling ₱10.22 million for all funds remained unsettled as of December 31, 2020.



COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009 prescribed the use of the Rules and Regulations on Settlement of Accounts (RRSA). Section 9.4, Chapter III of the RRSA states that:



“9.4	A suspension should be settled within ninety (90) calendar days from receipt of the NS; otherwise the transaction covered by it shall be disallowed/charged after the auditor shall have satisfied himself that such action is appropriate. Consequently, the Auditor shall issue the corresponding ND/NC.”



While, Section 7, Chapter II of the same Circular provides the following:



“7.1	Responsibility of the Agency Head



7.1.1	The head of the agency, who is primarily responsible for all government funds and property pertaining to his agency, shall ensure that: (a) the required financial and other reports and statements are submitted by the concerned agency officials in such form and within the period prescribed by the Commission; (b) the settlement of disallowances and charges is made within the prescribed period; (c) the requirements of transactions suspended in audit are complied with; and (d) appropriate actions are taken on the deficiencies noted as contained in the AOM.



7.1.2	The head of the agency shall initiate the necessary administrative and/or criminal action in case of unjustified failure/refusal to effect compliance with the foregoing requirements by subordinate officials. Gross negligence in disciplining subordinates who are subject of repeated adverse audit findings shall subject the officials concerned to disciplinary action by the proper authorities as the evidence may warrant.”



Verification of the Statement of Audit Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges (SASDC) as of December 31, 2020 showed that CBSUA has an unsettled suspensions and disallowances amounting to ₱60.43 and ₱10.22 million, respectively, viz:

The inability of Management to settle the suspensions within 90 days from their issuance resulted to their automatic maturity into disallowances pursuant to Section 9.4 of the RRSA while the non-settlement of disallowance that has become final and executory is contrary to Section 7.1.1 of the same regulation and may subject the Agency Head with the sanctions provided thereof.



We recommended that Management settle the suspensions within 90 days to avoid the maturity thereof into disallowance. Likewise, enforce the settlement of disallowances that have already become final and executory pursuant to Sections 7.1.1 and 7.1.2 of the RRSA to avoid the imposition of sanctions provided by law.



Management Comment:



Management assured the Audit Team that they are exerting efforts to expedite the settlement of all the transactions issued with Notice of Suspension.  They stated that the clearances of employees found to be responsible and/or liable who are retiring from service or transferring to other offices are not signed unless suspensions or disallowances are settled.
