PART II- OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

 

A. FINANCIAL AUDIT 
 

Unrecorded book reconciling items - Cash in Bank, LCCA 

 

1. Book reconciling items amounting to P36,687,145.06 in the Cash in Bank-Local 
Currency, Current Account were not recorded in the books of accounts as at 

December 31, 2020, hence resulting in material understatement of the cash, income 

and other related accounts thereof for a given period. 

 

The Statement of Financial Position (SFP) as at December 31, 2020 reflected the following 

balances of Cash in Bank-Local Currency, Current Account, viz: 

 

Fund Balance, 12/31/20 

164 39,735,504.66 

161 243,721.87 

163-Auxiliary 231.27 

163-External 607,076.81 

Total P40,342,812.74 

 

Our examination of the Bank Reconciliation Statements revealed that the reported 

balances in the Statement of Financial Position were still the unadjusted balances because 

the appropriate adjustments were not made pertaining to the book reconciling items, hence 

materially understating the Cash in Bank-LCCA by a total of P36,687,145.06, broken down 

as follows:

Due to failure by the Accountant to take up these reconciling items in the books, 

the cash account as well as its related income/expense accounts were also understated. 

Upon inquiry, the Accounting personnel disclosed that the Credit Memos (164) which 

represent fund transfer from CHED ROXI for the Free Higher Education Program totaling 

to P30,485,929.04 was not yet issued with Official Receipts by the Cashier during that time 

and that there were no documents forwarded by the Scholarship Office such as tuition fee 

assessment/billing statement to serve as basis for recording the collection of school fees. 

Whereas, per information, the other credit memos pertain to funds downloaded by various 

CHED Scholarship Grants such as CHED-TDP/UniFAST-TES/Sugarcane/SSP, or by 

other sources/entities for programs in which the College is a beneficiary. For the same 

reason, these bank credit memos remain unrecorded in the books as at year-end for absence 

of official receipts and other source documents from the offices concerned. 

 

 This condition could have been avoided had close coordination been practiced 

among the Accounting Office, the Scholarship Office, the Cashier and other offices 

concerned.  Each office plays a vital role in ensuring that the transactions of the College 

would be completely recorded and the lack of coordination thereof would not be reflective 

of the financial transactions/activities that actually transpired during the year.   

 

Had the Accountant regularly requested the bank statements from the bank at least 

every end of the month and as needed, and had the Scholarship Office regularly coordinated 

with CHED, immediately informed the Accounting Office for any fund transfers and in 

turn forwarded the necessary supporting documents, the said collections could have been 

promptly receipted as the income from school fees be recognized in the books as of year-

end. From the foregoing condition, it can be concluded that the following accounting 

entries were not properly drawn upon occurrence of the transaction, viz:

Upon billing of tuition and miscellaneous fees to 

CHED: 

Debit Credit 

Accounts Receivable xxx  

School Fees  xxx 

   

Upon receipt of downloaded funds from CHED-

b. Cash in bank, LCCA xxx

grants/financial assistance:

Upon liquidation:   

b. Other Payables or appropriate account xxx  

            Advances to Special Disbursing Officer  xxx 

   

 

Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standards (PPSAS) 1 prescribes the minimum 

requirement that financial statements must be prepared under the accrual basis of 

accounting.  Accrual basis is a basis of accounting under which transactions and other 

events are recognized when they occur (and not only when cash or its equivalent is received 

or paid). Therefore, the transactions and events are recorded in the accounting records and 

recognized in the financial statements of the periods to which they relate. But in the case 

of the College particularly on the collection of its tuition fees, the Accounts Receivable as 

well as the School Fees were not established right away upon billing but only when the 

funds were receipted by the Cashier which is contrary to existing standards. Thus, a high 

probability of understating the College’s assets, income, and other related accounts. 

 



40 
 

 Another consequence of such lack of sufficient coordination is the failure to release 

in a timely manner the Scholarship Grants to the student-beneficiaries which funds have 

already been received or downloaded from CHED as noted in the bloated balance of the 

Other Payables account under Fund 164 amounting to P18,446,100.00.  The Other 

Payables account was used to record the subsidies/allowances for student-beneficiaries but 

not yet released to them as at year-end.  Some of these funds were received since October 

but not yet released to the students. Had the official master list from CHED been forwarded 

by the Scholarship Office to the Accounting Office, the payroll for the release of the 

financial benefits to students could have already been processed. Also, the Audit Team 

observed that there was lack of monitoring mechanism to identify whether financial 

benefits or other scholarship grants are already due for release to beneficiaries or grantees. 

This contributed to delayed or non-release of financial benefits. As a result, it is not only 

depriving the student-beneficiaries of the timely entitlements of the said benefits but also 

derailing the purpose of the whole scholarship program. 

 

It bears stressing that a material understatement in the financial statement accounts 

would be the basis for rendering a qualified or adverse opinion on the College’s financial 

statements. 

 

Recommendations: 

We recommended that Management: 

 

a. Direct the Accountant, the Head-Scholarship Office, and the Cashier to closely 
coordinate among themselves, so as to completely and accurately record the 

transactions of the College by promptly monitoring for all fund transfers from the 

CHED Central/Regional Offices, providing the necessary documents to Offices 

concerned and to set-up a monitoring mechanism through the Scholarship 

Coordinators/Officers-In-Charge to take charge of the scholarship activities, 

focusing on the Free Higher Education Program;  

 

b. Institute monitoring mechanisms to timely identify those released and unreleased 
scholarship/financial benefits of student beneficiaries to eliminate delays/failure in 

releasing such benefits. Moreover, proper identification facilitates the 

recording/posting into the appropriate accounts and subsidiary ledgers the 

tuition/miscellaneous fees or other payables to students; 

 

c. Direct the Accountant to make the appropriate adjusting entries in the books of 
accounts to record the book reconciling items. Regularly request from the Bank, 

the bank statements as well as the Credit Memos and Debit Memos at least every 

end of the month and as needed and immediately prepare the bank reconciliation 

statements on a monthly basis; 

 

d. Advise the Accountant to follow the accrual basis of accounting in the recording of 
transactions in accordance with Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standards; 

and 

 



41 
 

e. Direct the Cashier to issue the respective Official Receipts to CHED CO/RO and 
closely coordinate with the Accounting Office. The release of financial benefits to 

students by way of Cash Advance through the Special Disbursing Officer is 

suggested to save cost of checks if paid individually to students. 

 
Management Comment: 

 

In their letter-reply, Management explained that the heads of the accounting and 

scholarship units are all designated faculty and new to the assignment, while the cashier is 

handled by an admin assistant designated as Cashier. For all of them, it was their first 

encounter working in the admin operations and are adjusting from their admin tasks. They 

were used to facilitate all documents during the SPAMAST admin and sent it to Malita 

Campus when their attention was called. Nevertheless, Management heeded the Audit 

Team’s audit recommendations and already called a meeting with all the personnel 

concerned regarding this matter. In addition, Management assured that with the newly-

hired plantilla personnel in January 2021, particularly the Accountant and the Cashier, the 

deficiencies found in audit will be corrected and the College’s processes will be improved. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

The Audit Team acknowledged Management’s explanation which is 

understandable for a young agency. That’s why the Audit Team related that the audit 

recommendations provided were procedural in a manner that Management will be guided 

on the correct processes for its operations as early as possible. The Audit Team commended 

Management for a positive take on the audit observations and its commitment to act on the 

recommendations as the team will regularly monitor its compliance. 

 

 

Property, Plant and Equipment 

 
2. a.) The provision for CY 2020 depreciation on the Property, Plant and Equipment’s 

(PPE) net book value of P82,206,883.26 was not recognized by the Accountant as at 

December 31, 2020, thereby understating the Depreciation Expense and the related 

Accumulated Depreciation for the year. 

 

Section 27, Chapter 10 of the GAM Volume 1 prescribes: 

 

 The following are policies regarding depreciation of PPE: 

 

 There are three factors an entity must consider in determining 
depreciation: 

a. Initial cost, 
b. Useful life, and 
c. Expected residual value at the end of its useful life. 

 



42 
 

 Except for land and not recognized heritage assets, all PPE 
shall be depreciated. 

 

 Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use 
such as when it is in the location and condition necessary for 

it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by 

management. For simplicity and to avoid proportionate 

computation, depreciation shall be for one month if the PPE 

is available for use after the 15th of the month, depreciation 

shall be for the succeeding month. 

 

 The straight line method of depreciation shall be adopted 
unless another method is more appropriate for entity 

operation. 

 

 Depreciation shall be recognized as a debit to the 
“Depreciation Expense” account and a credit to the 

“Accumulated Depreciation” account. Accumulated 

Depreciation is a contra-asset account presented in the FS as 

deduction from the related asset account. Depreciation 

expense shall be recognized on a monthly basis subject to 

item (c) of this Section. 

  

 

Our examination on the Consolidated Financial Statements of the College as at 

December 31, 2020 showed a total balance in Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE), net of 

Accumulated Depreciation of P82,206,883.26, broken down as follows:

The Davao del Sur State College’s PPE account was set-up upon the transfer of 

assets from SPAMAST Malita to DSSC Digos as per the official Property Transfer Report 

dated October 29, 2020 in view of their separation pursuant to Section 20 of RA No. 11220 

which states that “All assets, real and personal, personnel and records of the SPAMAST-

Digos City Campus, the SPAMAST Laboratory and Production Campus in the 

Municipality of Matanao, the SPAMAST Extension Classes in Barangay Kapatagan, Digos 

City and the SPAMAST Extension Campus in the Municipality of Sulop, as well as the 

liabilities and obligations are hereby transferred to the College.”  

 

 Perusal of the transfer documents showed that the assets’ book values received and 

recorded by DSSC were as of December 31, 2019 which connotes that the provision for 

CY 2020 depreciation expense and its related accumulated depreciation was not 

recognized, thereby understating the said accounts and overstating the net book value of 

the assets as at December 31, 2020. Moreover, the additions to PPE which were purchased 

by DSSC in CY2020 costing P252,252.77 were also not depreciated (See Annex A). The 

College may continue using the lapsing schedule provided by the SPAMAST to DSSC 

particularly on the assets’ estimated useful life and residual value in determining 

depreciation but these factors are a matter of judgment by DSSC Management. Under 

Section 27 of Chapter 10 of GAM Volume 1 prescribes that the Management is in the best 

position to estimate the expected useful life of its PPE which shall be reviewed on a regular 

basis and revised when appropriate. Guidelines on the life span of PPE are provided under 

item (f) of said section. 

  

b.) The non-maintenance by the Accountant of the Property, Plant and Equipment 

(PPE) Ledger Cards (PPELC), that should have been used to reconcile the Report on 

the Physical Count of PPE (RPCPPE) as prepared/submitted by the Supply Officer, 

has resulted in the failure to identify/rectify any variance that could have established 

the accuracy and reliability of the balances of the PPEs as reflected in the Financial 

Statements amounting to P82,206,883.26, inconsistent with the pertinent sections of 

the Government Accounting Manual.  
 

Section 42, Chapter 10 of the GAM Volume 1 provides: 

 

Accounting and Property Records to be maintained for PPE. 
The Chief Accountant shall maintain the PPELC for each category 

of PPE including work and other animals, livestock etc. The 

PPELC shall be kept to record promptly the acquisition, 

description, custody, estimated useful life, depreciation, 

impairment loss, disposal and other information about the asset. 

For check and balance, the Property and Supply Office/Unit shall 

likewise maintain PC for PPE in their custody to account for the 

receipt and disposition of the same. The balance per PC shall be 

reconciled with PPELC maintained by the Accounting 

Division/Unit. They shall also be reconciled with other property 

records like PAR. 

 



44 
 

The PPELC shall be used for each class of PPE to record the 

acquisition, description, custody, estimated useful life, 

depreciation, impairment, disposal, transfer/adjustment, repair 

history and other information about the property. It shall be kept 

and maintained by the Accounting Office/Unit. 

 

   

 The Property/Supply Officer submitted the CY 2020 RPCPPE based on the 

Property Cards that he maintained while on the other hand, the Accountant did not maintain 

the required PPE Ledger Cards that could have facilitated the reconciliation between the 

two records. The Accountant-Designate disclosed that the ledger cards were not prepared 

due to time constraints as she was too busy preparing for the year-end financial reports, 

which was unfortunately submitted beyond the legal deadline. It should be noted that the 

PPELC serve as supporting schedules for the FS and an indispensable tool/information in 

preparing the lapsing schedule of PPE for the computation of the depreciation of assets. 

Without the ledger cards and the absence of reconciliation of records by the Accountant 

and the Supply Officer, the resultant variance cannot be detected and corrected to establish 

the correctness/accuracy and completeness of the reported balance of the PPEs in the 

Financial Statements. 

  

Recommendations:    

We recommended that Management: 

a. Assess the present condition of the College’s properties and equipment as there 
may be unserviceable properties subject for disposal and eventual derecognition in 

the PPE accounts, and thereafter determine the remaining useful life of the PPEs 

particularly those transferred assets from SPAMAST. Should the DSSC 

Management decide to re-evaluate the estimated useful life of the assets, the 

guidelines are provided under Section 27, Chapter 10 of GAM Vol. 1 so that the 

appropriate computation of the depreciation expense may be provided;  

 

b. Direct the Accountant to recognize the depreciation expense on a monthly basis 
starting CY 2021. Make the necessary adjustments in the beginning balance of the 

PPE, net of Accumulated Depreciation after computing for the appropriate 

depreciation; and 

 

c. Advise the Accountant to maintain the PPE Ledger Cards pursuant to Section 42, 
Chapter 10 of the GAM Volume 1. See Appendix 70 of the GAM for the prescribed 

format. Ensure that the PPELC is regularly reconciled with the Property Cards 

maintained by the Property/Supply Officer. 

 

Management Comment: 

 

In their letter-reply, Management explained that during CY 2020, the Accountant, 

Supply Officer, and Property Custodian were all designated faculty. The records of 

Property and Equipment were centralized in SPAMAST-Malita Campus which it was 



45 
 

assumed that recognition of Depreciation Expense and related Accumulated Depreciation 

of the Property Plant and Equipment was the duty and responsibility of the personnel in 

SPAMAST Malita Campus and then transfer the records to the College. However, 

Management heeded the Audit Team’s recommendations particularly on re-evaluating all 

serviceable properties received from SPAMAST and all unserviceable properties shall be 

reported and recommended for disposal. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

 The Management’s comments are well noted as the Audit Team will regularly 

monitor its compliance. 

 

 

Cash Advances 

 

3. a.) Cash advances of one accountable officer have overlapped due to the grant of 
additional cash advances despite an existing unliquidated balance contrary to the 

rules and regulations on the granting, utilization, and liquidation of cash advances 

prescribed in Section 4.1.2 of COA Circular No. 97-002 and Section 89 of P.D. No. 

1445. 

 

Section 4.1.2 of COA Circular No. 97-002 and Section 89 of P.D. No. 1445 state 

that no additional cash advances shall be allowed to any official or employee unless the 

previous cash advance given to him is first settled or a proper accounting thereof is made. 

 

Review of the Report of Checks Issued (RCI) for the Calendar Year 2020 revealed 

simultaneous grant of cash advances to one Accountable Officer even though she has still 

outstanding cash advances. For the whole year, the disbursing officer was granted a total 

of P11,084,283.28 in cash advances and it was noted that in a day, several checks were 

issued under the AO’s name for various purposes such as petty cash fund, payroll, and 

special purpose. This resulted in the accumulation of cash advances which violated the 

provisions in COA Circular 97-002 and P.D. 1445. Details are provided in Annex B hereof. 

  

b.) The handling and/or possession of government funds by an accountable officer 

despite inadequate Fidelity Bond contravened P.D. No. 1445 and the Public Bonding 

Law, thereby posing risks to possible loss of government funds in case of defalcation, 

shortages and unrelieved losses. 

 

P.D. No. 1445 states that “every accountable officer shall be properly bonded in 

accordance with law.”  

 

Section 4.8 of Treasury Circular No. 02-2009 dated August 6, 2009 was issued 

pursuant to the Public Bonding Law, which provides, among others, that a public officer 

whose fidelity is insured in the Fidelity Fund shall, from the moment he assumes the duties 

of the office, is considered bonded to the government for the faithful performance of all 

duties imposed upon him by law, and for the faithful accounting of all funds and public 



46 
 

properties coming into his possession, custody or control by appropriation, collection, 

transfer or otherwise, as well as for the lawful payment, disbursement and expenditure or 

transfer of all such funds or public properties in his custody, possession or under his control 

as accountable or responsible officer (Sec. 13, PBL). The Fidelity Fund shall be available 

for the purpose of replacing defalcations, shortages, unrelieved losses in the accounts of 

bonded public officers, for the payment of fees and costs incident to civil proceedings 

brought against them to recover sums paid on their account from said Fund (Sec. 326, 

PBL). 

 

 To determine whether an accountable officer is adequately bonded, the collections 

and disbursements per day is compared with the amount of maximum accountability shown 

in the AO’s bond confirmation letter with Risk No. 66-19-3842N. Examination of the daily 

cash receipts and cash disbursements handled by the collecting and/or disbursing officer 

revealed that daily collections and disbursements exceeded the maximum daily cash 

accountability of P500,000.00 covered by her fidelity bond, viz:

 The Revised Schedule of Premium Rates included in the mentioned Treasury 

Circular provides the appropriate amount of bond for the AO’s total money accountability 

as determined by the Agency Head, provided that the individual maximum accountability 

of each accountable public officer shall not exceed P100 Million. Section 5 of said circular 

further states that the Agency Head may assign to other public officers the excess 

accountability for which a separate Fidelity Bond shall be secured. Basing from the 

schedule, the agency’s accountable officer currently has an insufficient bond. It is worthy 

to note that failure of the agency’s Management to assess the adequacy of the fidelity bonds 

of accountable officers under them can be detrimental to the government as funds are not 

adequately safeguarded against losses. 

 

 

Recommendations: 
 

We recommended that Management: 
 

a. Comply the prescribed rules and regulations on the granting, utilization, and 
liquidation of cash advances under COA Circular No. 97-002 and P.D. No. 1445; 
Refrain from granting overlapping cash advances to one accountable officer to 

avoid accumulation of unliquidated cash advances and avoid exceeding his/her 

maximum cash accountability. If possible, assign to other public officers the excess 

accountability to which a separate bond shall be secured; and 

 

b. Comply with the bonding requirements for accountable public officers pursuant to 
P.D. No. 1445 and the Public Bonding Law by increasing the Fidelity Bond of its 

accountable officers in order to adequately safeguard government funds and 

property from defalcation, shortages, and unrelieved losses. 

 

 

Management Comment: 

  

 The Management committed to comply with the audit recommendations. 

  

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 The Management’s comment is well noted as the Audit Team will regularly 

monitor its compliance.

Inventories directly charged to expenses 

 

4. Regular purchases of office supplies and other supplies/materials amounting to 
P107,615.58, as well as tangible items procured during the period amounting to 

P82,727.56 were directly charged to various expense accounts instead of recognizing 

them first in appropriate inventory and semi-expendable property accounts contrary 

to Sections 9, 10 and 18, Chapter 8, Volume I of the Government Accounting Manual 

(GAM), hence exposing the government properties to possible loss or misuse since the 

receipts and issuances thereof were not properly controlled and monitored. 
 

Chapter 8, Volume I of the GAM provides that: 

 

Sec. 9. Perpetual Inventory Method. Supplies and 

materials purchased for inventory purpose shall be recorded 

using the perpetual inventory system, resulting in a more 

accurate inventory records and a running total for the cost of 

goods sold in each period. The system requires accounting 

records to show the amount of inventory on hand at all times 

through the maintenance of the SLC (Appendix 57) by the 

Accounting Division/Unit and Stock Card (SC) (Appendix 

58) by the Supply and/or Property Division/Unit for each 

item in stock. Regular purchases shall be coursed 

through the inventory account and issues thereof shall be 

recorded as they take place except for supplies and 

materials purchased out of PCF for immediate use or on 

emergency cases which shall be charged directly to the 

appropriate expense accounts. (Emphasis supplied) 

 

Sec. 10. Semi-expendable Property. Tangible items below 

the capitalization threshold of P 15,000.00 shall be 

accounted as semi-expendable property.   

 

(b) These tangible items shall be recognized as expenses 

upon issue to the end- user. 

 

Furthermore, Sec. 18, items d and f, illustrates the procedures in the recording of 

inventory and its succeeding issuance:

Review of the Report of Checks Issued for the period covered May 01 to December 

31, 2020 revealed that regular purchases of Office Supplies, Drugs and Medicines, 

Medical, Dental & Laboratory Supplies and Textbooks and Instructional Materials 

amounting to P107,615.58,  as well as tangible items purchased during the period 

amounting to P82,727.56 were directly charged to various expense accounts instead of

 The outright recording of regular purchases of inventory items to various expense 

accounts contravenes the observance of Perpetual Inventory Method, while those tangible 

items categorized as below the capitalization of P15,000.00 were recorded directly to 

expense accounts contrary to the policy that it shall be accounted as semi-expendable 

property unless released to the end user with Inventory Custodian Slip duly received by the 

end users to establish accountability over them as required under the GAM. 

 

 Accordingly, the supplies were directly released to the end-users. The utilization of 

those inventory items were no longer reflected in the Requisition Issue Slip (RIS) for 

proper monitoring and recording in the Stock Cards (SC) by the Supply Office and 

summarized in the Report of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI) to be submitted to the 

College Accountant for recording in their Supplies Ledger Cards (SLC). And the absence 

of Inventory Custodian Slip (ICS) of tangible items duly received by the end users defeats 

the establishment of accountability over them. However, the newly appointed Supply 

Officer started preparing the ICS for tangible items mentioned above to be released and 

acknowledged by end users.  

 

The prevailing practice further exposes government properties to possible loss or 

misuse since the receipts were not properly monitored and issuances were not properly 

controlled. This may also affect the accuracy of the balances of the related inventory and 

semi-expendable property accounts at a certain period for items that were not actually 

utilized and released but were already recognized as expenses. 

 

  

Recommendations: 

 

We recommended that Management: 

 
a. Direct the College Accountant to observe the Perpetual Inventory Method in 

recording purchased supplies and materials and to ensure that regular purchases 

of supplies are coursed through the inventory account/s, except those purchased 

out of the petty cash fund, and issuance thereof be recorded as they take place 

with the Report of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI) as supporting 

document;  

 

b. Direct the Supply Officer to observe the correct procedures in the issuance and 
utilization of inventory items and semi-expendable property and or tangible 

items; 

 



52 
 

c. Advise the College Accountant to observe the proper recording of tangible items 
to semi-expendable property accounts unless issued with ICS by the Supply 

Officer for the establishment of accountability over them; and 

 

d. Advise the Supply Officer to have a regular reconciliation of records with that 
of the records maintained by the College Accountant. 

 

Management Comment: 

 

In their letter-reply, the Management admitted that a proper orientation/training and 

system of recording of supplies and materials were not yet in place during that time but 

assured that they shall correct these errors following the audit recommendations. The 

Management is optimistic that with their present set-up of duly appointed personnel such 

as the Supply Officer and the Accountant, the improvement of the College’s inventory 

system shall be given utmost attention. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

  

The Management’s actions on this matter are well taken and shall monitor its 

compliance. 

 

Cancelled Checks 

 

5. Fifty-eight (58) cancelled checks from May 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020 were not 
marked cancelled and were still reported as issued checks in the Checks and ADA 

Disbursements Record (CkADADRec) contrary to Section 44, Chapter 6 of GAM, 

Volume 1, thereby resulting in inaccurate and unreliable reports and defeating the 

purpose of providing useful information to the users of financial reports required 

under Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standards. 

 

Section 12, Chapter 6 of GAM Volume 1 provides the following procedures on 

Disbursements by Checks: 

 

  

 Preparation of Reports 

 Daily 

Cashier/ 

Designated Staff 

Prepares Advice of Checks Issued and Cancelled 

(ACIC) (Appendix 39) in accordance with existing rules 

and regulations and forwards to the GSB. 

 Retrieves Copies 2-3 of checks, Copies 1-3 of DV, 

Copies 2-3 of ORS and SDs and prepares the RCI in 

four copies.  

 Note 8 – The RCI shall include all checks drawn during 

the day whether released or unreleased to the payees 

including cancelled ones. 

 



53 
 

 

The ACIC is a report prepared and submitted at least daily by an agency/entity to 

the GSB to enable the payees to encash/negotiate the issued checks. Appendix 39 of the 

GAM Vol. 2 contains the instructions on how to properly fill-up the ACIC and that for 

cancelled checks, it requires the disclosure of the reason why the check was cancelled. The 

advice shall be promptly submitted to the GSB. 
 

Furthermore, Section 44, Chapter 6, of GAM Vol. 1 prescribes that:  

 

Checks may be cancelled when they become stale, voided or 

spoiled. The depository bank considers a check stale, if it has been 

outstanding for over six months from date of issue or as prescribed. 

 

A stale, voided or spoiled check shall be marked cancelled on its 

face and reported as follows: 

 

a. Voided, spoiled or unclaimed stale checks with the Cashier shall 
be reported as cancelled in the List of Unreleased Checks that 

will be attached to the RCI. 

 

b. New checks may be issued for the replacement of stale/spoiled 
checks in the hands of the payees or holders in due course, upon 

submission of the stale/spoiled checks to the Accounting 

Division/Unit. A certified copy of the previously paid DVs shall 

be attached to the request for replacement. A JEV shall be 

prepared to take up the cancellation. The replacement check 

shall be reported in the RCI. 

 

The GAM requires that all checks/ADA drawn during the day, whether released or 

unreleased including cancelled checks shall be recognized chronologically in the 

Checks/ADA Disbursements Record maintained by the Cash/Treasury Unit. The dates the 

checks were actually released shall be indicated in the appropriate column provided for in 

the CkADADRec. 

 

Accounting 
Division/Unit 

Preparation of JEV 

 Daily 

 Receives Copies 1-2 of RCI with Copy 2 of the Check, 

Copies 1 and 3 of DVs, Copies 2-3 of ORS and other 

SDs from Cash/Treasury Unit. Forwards the documents 

to the Designated Staff for JEV preparation. 

Designated Staff Examines DVs and checks against RCI. Verifies if the 

serial number of all checks drawn whether released or 

unreleased, including spoiled or cancelled ones, are all 

accounted for. 



54 
 

The audit team’s review of the cashier’s List of Unreleased and Cancelled Checks 

for CY 2020 showed a total of fifty-eight (58) checks that were cancelled. The non-

submission of the DVs to the COA Office precluded a timely inspection of these cancelled 

checks. Upon validation last February 08, 2021, the original signed checks were found 

attached to the disbursement vouchers but were not marked “cancelled” on its face contrary 

to the prescribed regulations (See Figures 1-4 of Annex C). The signed DVs and the 

supporting documents therein were likewise not marked cancelled or only the photocopy 

but not the original checks were marked cancelled (See Figures 5-7 of Annex C). This 

poses a risk because anyone can still negotiate those signed checks at the bank if the ACIC 

is not promptly submitted to the Authorized Government Servicing Bank (AGSB) to advice 

the bank of these cancelled checks, thereby exposing government funds to possible loss or 

misuse. The audit team immediately apprised the Cash/Treasury Unit of this deficiency 

and to correct the same. 

  

Upon further inquiry, it was known that every time a check is cancelled, a new DV 

containing the same transaction is prepared replacing the previously paid DV without 

cancelling the same (See Annex D).  But based on the above-mentioned regulation, it 

already suffices that the previously paid DVs be used and attached to the replacement check 

instead of unnecessarily preparing another DV especially if there was one and the same 

transaction and payee. It must be emphasized that frequent cancellation of checks can be 

minimized or avoided through good fiscal management mechanism. 

 

Moreover, for the said cancelled checks, it was noted that although chronologically 

recorded both in the Report of Checks Issued (RCI) and the Check/ADA Disbursements 

Record (CkADADRec), the cancelled checks were considered in the reports as “issued” 

thereby overstating the disbursements reported therein. In effect, the Cash in Bank balance 

monitored or reported by the Cashier was incorrect or unreliable. These RCIs together with 

the DVs and other supporting documents are the source documents forwarded to the 

Accounting Unit for complete and proper recording of transactions. Inaccurate and 

unreliable reports generated by each unit or department defeat the purpose of providing 

useful information to the users of the financial reports for decision making which is 

contrary to the Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standards. 

 

Recommendations: 

We recommended that Management: 

a. Comply with the prescribed rules and regulations set forth in accounting for 
cancelled checks under Chapter 6 of GAM Volume 1 by clearly indicating the word 

“cancelled” on the face of the checks as well as on the DVs accompanying the same 

to avoid the risk of loss or misuse; 

 

b. Direct the Cashier to completely fill-out the Advice of Checks Issued and Cancelled 
(ACIC) by indicating the reasons why the checks were cancelled and promptly 

submit the same to the GSB; and 

 



55 
 

c. Direct the Cashier to ensure accuracy and reliability of reports prepared such as the 
RCI and the CkADADRec that they include all checks drawn during the day 

whether released or unreleased to the payees including cancelled ones, and properly 

make corrections in said reports for any cancelled checks so as to maintain a correct 

cash balance and provide reliable updated information to the Accounting Unit for 

accurate recording. 

 

Management Comment: 

 

 The Management is amenable to the Audit Team’s recommendations and will 

ensure strict compliance thereof. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

 The Management’s comment is well noted as the Audit Team will monitor its 

compliance. 

 

Non-submission of Bank Reconciliation Statements 

 

6. The Monthly Bank Reconciliation Statements were not submitted to the Office of the 
Commission on Audit within the prescribed timeline contrary to Section 74 of PD 

1445, thus preventing the timely verification on the accuracy and reliability of the 

Cash in Bank account balances amounting to P17,226764.51 as reported in the Trial 

Balance as at June 30, 2020. 

 

 Sec. 74 of Presidential Decree No. 1445 states:  

 

Monthly reports of depositories to agency head. At the close 

of each month, depositories shall report to the agency head, in such 

from as he may direct, the condition of the agency account standing 

on their books. The head of the agency shall see to it that a 

reconciliation is made between the balance shown in the reports and 

the balance found in the books of the agency. 

 

Further, the National Guidelines on Internal Control Systems, as 

circularized in DBM Circular Letter No. 2008-8 dated October 23, 2008, 

specifically stated among others that the reconciliation of financial and non-

financial data is among the most common control policies and procedures that are 

part of the coordinated measures and procedures that every office should have, viz: 

 

Operating procedures of every office require that the cash records of 

the Accounting and Cash units should be regularly reconciled. The 

records of the depository banks pertaining to the cash accounts of 

the agency should be reconciled with the records of the Accounting 

and Cash units. This process will detect errors or fraud either by the 

bank, the Accounting unit or the Cash unit.  



56 
 

 

Furthermore, Sec. 3, Chapter 21, Volume 1 of the Government Accounting Manual 

provides that the Bank Reconciliation Statement (BRS) shall be prepared in order 

to: 

 

a. Check the correctness of both the bank’s and 
agency’s/entity’s Records; 

b. Serve as a deterrent to fraud; and 
c. Enable the agency/entity or bank to take up charges or 

credits recognized by the bank or agency/entity but not 

yet known to the agency/entity or bank. 

 

“Sec.4. Method of Bank Reconciliation. The monthly Bank Reconciliation 

Statement (BRS) shall be prepared by the Chief Accountant/designated staff for 

each of the bank accounts maintained by the agency/entity using the Adjusted 

Balance Method. Under this method, the book balance and the bank balance are 

brought to an adjusted cash balance that must appear on the Statement of Financial 

Position.” 

  

Preparation of the BRS shall be within ten days from receipt of the monthly Bank 

Statement (BS) together with the paid checks, original copies of DM/CM from the 

Government Servicing Banks (GSB).  Finally, within twenty days after receipt of the 

monthly BS, the Chief Accountant shall submit the original BRS, with all the supporting 

documents and JEVs, to COA Auditor. This is the flow from the preparation to reporting 

and submission of the monthly BRS. 

 

One of the audit procedures employed in the verification of the accuracy and 

reliability of the cash accounts reported and presented in the Financial Statements by the 

agency is the examination of the BRS. The BRS should reconcile the unadjusted cash 

balance per book with that of the cash balance per bank. Any reconciling items found 

therein, either in the cash book or cash in bank should be considered. The reconciled cash 

balance will then be the cash balance to be reported in the financial statement particularly 

in the Statement of Financial Position. The absence of a timely, accurate and reliable BRS 

would raise questions on the reliability and accuracy of the cash accounts balances and 

may also result in reporting erroneous balances of other accounts in the FS. 

 

The Davao del Sur State College (DSSC) commenced its financial operations as a 

State College on May, 2020 pursuant to RA 11220 or “An Act Separating the Southern 

Philippines Agri-Business, Marine and Aquatic School of Technology (SPAMAST)-Digos 

City Campus in the City of Digos, Davao del Sur, from the SPAMAST in the Municipality 

of Malita, Davao Occidental, and Converting it into a State College to be known as the 

Davao del Sur State College. 

 

In our review of the cash accounts of the Davao del Sur State College, we have 

observed that the BRS for the period May and June were only submitted on September 21, 

2020 and September 24, 2020, respectively which was already 2 to 3 months delayed. We

also observed that these were prepared on a consolidated (all funds) basis instead of on a 

per bank account basis contrary to the method prescribed in Sec. 4, GAM Volume 1.  The 

suggested format of which can be found in Appendices 80-81 of GAM Volume 2.  

 

While, the July and August 2020 were not yet submitted in violation of Sec.74 of 

PD 1445 and DBM Circular Letter No. 2008-8 dated October 23, 2008. This prevented the 

Audit Team from conducting reconciliation and a thorough verification of the College’s 

cash accounts. 

 

Accordingly, the designate Accountant informed the Audit Team that she is a 

regular Instructor of the College and was designated as the College Accountant and a 

Budget Officer. During the second quarter of this year, she prioritizes the preparation of 

the budget proposals for CY 2021.   However, she promised to double her efforts to comply 

with the said regulations.  

 

In addition, Section 122 (2) of PD 1445 states that “Failure on the part of the 

officials concerned to submit the documents and reports mentioned herein shall 

automatically cause the suspension of payment of their salaries until they shall have 

complied with the requirements of the Commission.” 

 

It must be noted that the delays or non-submission of the BRS might not be justified 

by management in view of the current trends in the banking industry of providing to clients 

the internet banking facilities, like the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) weAccess 

facility which provides real time access on the balances of the clients’ deposits, loans and 

other selected banking transactions. 

 

Upon enrolment of the College of this LBP weAccess facility, the BRS can now be 

easily prepared because the online access facilitates the preparation of the monthly BRS as 

the confirmation of bank accounts will be real-time, meaning, the balances of the accounts 

will be accessed anytime of the day.  The balance inquiry, account statement, ATM Payroll, 

Check Status Inquiry, transaction history, security, etc. are built-in facility and can now be 

availed on a real time basis. 

 
Recommendations: 

We recommended that Management: 

a. The Management ensure proper compliance in accordance with Sec.74 of PD 1445 
and DBM Circular Letter No. 2008-8 dated October 23, 2008 and should submit 

timely, accurate and reliable monthly bank reconciliation statements to the Office 

of the Auditor; 

 

b. Require the Accounting Section to immediately submit the BRS with complete 
supporting documents; 

 

c. Facilitate the enrollment of the LBP weAccess facility to avail on real time basis 
the account statements and other related financial records and information 



58 
 

necessary in the preparation of the BRS or while not yet enrolled, instruct the Chief 

Administrative Officer and the Chief Accountant to request for monthly snap shots 

of the bank statements to facilitate the preparation of the monthly BRS; and 

 

d. Submit a written explanation for reason/s of the incurrence of the delays in the 
submission of BRS with proof evidencing that these data could not be complied by 

the Accounting Section on or before every 20th day of the succeeding month as 

required under Section 74 of P.D. 1445. 

 

Management Comment: 

In their letter-reply, the Management informed the Audit Team that on August 

2020, the College has processed its enrolment in the LBP weAcess facility to avail on a 

real-time basis the bank statements. However, its application is not yet approved by Land 

Bank until now. Delays of the reply could be attributed to the restrictions of the movement 

of employees. They further added that the College has just been operating as a new college 

for around 10 months, which has no administrative staff to handle each office. The 

designated College Accountant is a full-time faculty with multiple designations who also 

handles the Budget Office. Personal to her is that she is currently pregnant. Various urgent 

matters were also attended such as with DBM budget preparations and submissions, as well 

as report preparations for presentation during Board Finance Committee and Board of 

Trustees meetings. 

For action taken to this observation, the college has instituted a Timesheet 

Procedure that will ensure an accurate and on time submission of reports to avoid a 

recurrence of this audit finding. 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

The Management’s comments are noted. With the newly-hired Head of Offices 

starting January 2021 particularly the Accountant and the Cashier, there will no longer be 

an excuse for occurrence of any delays in the future. The Audit Team shall strictly monitor 

its compliance in CY 2021. As of the date of the Exit Conference held last February 26, 

2021, all the Bank Reconciliation Statements from May 2020 to December 2020 were 

already submitted to the Office of the Auditor. 

 

B. COMPLIANCE AUDIT 
 

Non-submission of Disbursement Vouchers 

 

7. A total of 1,189 Disbursement Vouchers and their supporting documents amounting 
to P27,492,616.63 was not submitted to the Office of the Auditor, hence, the timely 

and proper submission of reports prescribed in Section 59(20), Chapter 19, Volume 

I, Government Accounting Manual (GAM) and as required under Section 122(1) of 

P.D. No. 1445 were not complied with, thus rendering questions on the regularity, 



59 
 

propriety and legality of the related transactions, as the same could not be ascertained 

in a timely manner. 

 
Section 59(20), Chapter 19, Volume I, GAM states that the frequency of submission 

of Pre-Closing Trial Balance/Post Closing Trial Balance and other reports shall be monthly, 

within ten (10) days after the end of the month to the COA Resident Auditor and DBM. 

Section 122 of P.D. No. 1445 further states that whenever deemed necessary in the 

exigencies of the service, the Commission may under regulations issued by it require the 

agency heads, chief accountants, budget officers, cashiers, disbursing officers, 

administrative or personnel officers, and other responsible officials of the various agencies 

to submit trial balances, physical inventory reports, current plantilla of personnel, and such 

other reports as may be necessary for the exercise of its functions.  “Failure on the part of 

the officials concerned to submit the documents and reports mentioned herein shall 

automatically cause the suspension of payment of their salaries until they shall have 

complied with the requirements of the Commission.” 

 

Review of the Report of Checks Issued (RCI) for the Calendar Year 2020 revealed 

that as of February 01, 2021, the paid disbursement vouchers and all their complete 

supporting documents for the months of May to December 2020 were not submitted to the 

Office of the Resident Auditor for post-audit and safekeeping, as summarized per fund 

below: 

 

Fund No. of DVs Amount  

101 14           P       432,958.30 

164 1,110 26,724,445.96 

163 42 156,294.46 

163-EF 23 178,917.91 

Total 1,189 P  27,492,616.63 

 

Details of the unsubmitted disbursement vouchers are shown in the herein attached 

schedule marked as Annexes H1 to H4. 

 

 The non-submission of these documents precludes the Auditor from performing 

timely audit and verification of the accounts which resulted in the non-determination of the 

regularity, propriety and legality of the related transactions. 

In view of this, and in pursuance with PD 1445 on suspending the salaries of the 

officials concerned for failure to submit the documents and reports, a Notice of Suspension 

on such amount was issued dated February 3, 2021. 

 

Recommendations:    

We recommended that Management: 



60 
 

a. Comply with the requirements set forth under Section 59(20), Chapter 19, Volume 
I, GAM and Section 122(1) of P.D. No. 1445 in the submission of financial reports 

in order to have a reliable basis in the verification and analysis of the financial 

transactions of the agency; and 

 

b. Require the officer responsible to comply with the deficiencies noted herein and 
submit immediately the lacking 1,189 Disbursement Vouchers along with their 

supporting documents pertaining to CY 2020 in order to prevent the possible 

suspension in audit. 

 

Management Comment:  

 

In their letter-reply, the Management explained that the College was still on its 

transition in being separated from SPAMAST starting January 2020. As it operated as an 

independent College, it did not have its own plantilla items for administrative staff, thus, 

the College was forced to tap faculty members designated to handle some tasks in the 

admin. This is to mention one (1) faculty designated both as Accountant and Budget 

Officer. This employee is also handling academic loads meeting her students regularly.  

  

It further added that it was aggravated with the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 

that this greatly limited the movement of employees coming to school for work; 

specifically, when the school implements alternative work arrangements based on CSC 

Resolution No. 2000912, which resulted in delays in the closing of transactions among 

clients (suppliers, students, and faculty and staff) such as in claiming payments, salaries 

and wages and allowances (students). Admittedly, the Accounting Unit operated with only 

the manpower of Job Order workers but, still some deliverables were not met like the timely 

and proper submission of reports. Nevertheless, Management assured that with their 

present set-up, the submission of reports shall be improved. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

 The Management’s comments are noted and understandably, all were affected 

and/or restricted by the pandemic. However, as we were adapting to the new normal, new 

strategies and means are expectably in place so as not to hamper the agency’s operations 

as well as the submission of reports. The Audit Team related that the audit 

recommendations are procedural in such a manner that Management will be guided 

accordingly of the correct processes as early as possible so that such deficiencies noted in 

audit will not recur or be minimized in the future. As of the date of the Exit Conference, 

the May 2020 to July 2020 DVs were already submitted to the office and were found in 

order. Accordingly, the Notice of Settlement or NSSDC dated February 17, 2021 was 

issued for the amount of P3,714,012.48.

Reimbursements 

 

8. Regular expenses totaling to P53,365.50 were paid on reimbursement basis which is 
not among those prescribed modes of procurement due to lack of procurement 

planning and training contrary to Section 7, Chapter 6 of the New Government 

Accounting Manual, hence casting doubt on the validity and propriety of the 

College’s transactions. 

 

Section 7, Chapter 6 of the Government Accounting Manual, states that “The 

different modes of disbursements are as follows: (a) checks (MDS or commercial checks), 

(b) cash (out of cash advance granted to authorized Disbursing Officer), (c) advice to debit 

the account, (d) tax remittance advice, (e) working Fund/CDC, and (f) direct payment 

method.” 

 The College paid its expenses through reimbursement for office supplies, minor 

repairs, food/meal/snacks, materials for training programs and maintenance of cleanliness 

of the entire campus. These expenses cannot be classified as urgent/emergency in nature 

and should have undergone the usual government procurement process and should have 

been paid directly to the name/account of the supplier/payee through any of the applicable 

mode of disbursements enumerated above. 

The payment of various expenses totaling P53,365.50 as shown below were regular 

expenses for regular programs/activities which could have been planned and procured in 

compliance with RA 9184 and which could have been paid through checks payable to the 

account of the supplier/creditor and not to office personnel, viz:

Some of the above transactions were not included in the agency’s APP which is the 

consolidated PPMPs from different offices of the college inconsistent with the provisions 

under RA 9184 as stated below, thus creating doubts on the validity and propriety of those 

transactions. 

Section 7.1. Rule II of RA 9184 provides that all procurement shall be within the 

approved budget of the procuring entity and should be meticulously and judiciously 

planned by the procuring entity. Consistent with government fiscal discipline measures, 

only those considered crucial to the efficient discharge of governmental functions shall be 

included in the Annual Procurement Plan (APP). 

Accordingly, in CY 2019 Digos Campus now DSSC submitted PPMP for CY 2020 

to the main campus SPAMAST Malita. However, not all items in their PPMP were given 

to the new College because starting May, 2020 they already separated and started to 

disburse through their own internally generated fund through DSSC BOT Resolution No. 

003 Series of 2020 dated February 12, 2020.  They admitted that reimbursements were their 

options and or the easiest way in order not to hamper the operation of the newly created 



64 
 

College. Management assured the Audit Team that with their present set-up, it will abide 

with the stated regulations and coordinate with all affected offices. 

 This practice if continued will result to disbursements not undergoing the prescribed 

government procurement process and disbursements wherein the applicable taxes were not 

withheld as required by applicable BIR rules and regulations.   

 

Recommendations: 

 
We recommended that Management: 

a. Refrain from using reimbursements as a regular mode of payment/disbursement. 
Instead, practice the payment thru checks to the account of the supplier/payee as 

prescribed by GAM and ensure the correct computation of withholding tax as 

required by BIR regulations; 

 

b. Properly plan the agency’s programs/ activities/ projects (PAPs) as required in 
order to systematize the procurement process for each quarter and in order to 

comply with the required process of procurement in all instances; 

 

c. Require the end-user units/division of the College to prepare their respective Project 
Procurement Management Plan (PPMP) for their different programs, activities, and 

projects (PAPs) meticulously and judiciously; and 

 

d. In some instances, Submit to COA Office for monitoring purposes, copies of the 
amendments/changes/modifications of PPMPs as well as supplemental PPMPs 

from the different offices of the College during the year.  

 

Management Comment: 

 

 The Management is amenable to the audit recommendations and will ensure 

compliance thereof.  

 

 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

 The Management’s comment is well noted as the Audit Team will monitor its 

compliance. 

 

 

Untransferred titles of land 

 

9. The Certificates of Title of recorded Land containing an area of 354,172 square 
meters in the total amount of P3,436,128.23 were not transferred in the name of Davao 

del Sur State College as they are still with SPAMAST, inconsistent with the provisions 



65 
 

of Sec. 1 of RA 11220, thus not supporting ownership thereof as at December 31, 2020 

and giving undue disadvantage to the College.   

 

Section l. of RA 11220, Separation/Establishment. - The Southern Philippines 

Agri-Business,     Marine and Aquatic School of Technology (SPAMAST)-Digos City 

Campus in the City of Digos, Province of Davao del Sur, is hereby separated from the 

SPAMAST in the Municipality of Malita, Davao Occidental, and converted into a state 

college to be known as the Davao del Sur State College, and integrating therewith the 

SPAMAST-Digos City Campus in Barangay Matti, Digos City, the SPAMAST Laboratory 

and Production Campus in the Municipality of Matanao, the SPAMAST Extension Classes 

in Barangay Kapatagan, Digos City, and the SPAMAST Extension Campus in the 

Municipality of Sulop, all located in the Province of Davao del Sur. Its main campus shall 

be in Digos City.  

 

Per available records in the Davao del Sur State College, they revealed that in the 

middle of CY 2020, SPAMAST turned over the total assets amounting to P94,304,875.07 

net of accumulated depreciation of P21,424,306.13 to the College. One of the assets turned 

over was the Land specifically mentioned in the above Section of RA 11220 or AN ACT 

SEPARATING THE SOUTHERN PHILIPPINES AGRI-BUSINESS, MARINE AND 

AQUATIC SCHOOL OF TECHNOLOGY (SPAMAST)-DIGOS CITY CAMPUS IN 

THE CITY OF DIGOS, DAVAO DEL SUR, FROM THE SPAMAST IN THE 

MUNICIPALITY OF MALITA, DAVAO OCCIDENTAL, AND CONVERTING IT

Further, we noted that the lots in Digos City Campus and extension campus in 

Matanao both in Davao del Sur were already registered with the Register of Deeds in the 

name of SPAMAST. (Please see Annexes E & F) other lot with Deed of Donation is the 

Sulop extension campus but present status reveals that it is still not executed by both parties 

and record would show that it is  kept by the property custodian with  SB Resolution No. 

16-201, s. of 2018- “Authorizing the Municipal Mayor Honorable Maria S. Sagarino, 

Municipality of Sulop to donate twenty thousand seventy (20,070) square meters of Land 

owned the Municipality of Sulop, Davao del Sur to SPAMAST for school site of SPAMAST- 

Sulop extension college”.   (ANNEX G) 

 



66 
 

Inquiry with the newly appointed Supply Officer of the College revealed that the 

Management has not yet started collating documents needed to process the transfer of the 

titles of the above-mentioned three (3) lots, as well as failing to coordinate with the 

Municipality of Sulop the request for the Deed of Donation to be executed in the name of 

the Davao del Sur State College. 

 

As at December 31, 2020, though the above properties were already turned over to 

the DSSC, records would show that the legal documents/titles issued by the Register of 

Deeds to prove the ownership thereof are still in the name of SPAMAST, inconsistent with 

the provisions of Section 1, RA 11220, thus giving undue disadvantage to the College. 

 

Recommendations: 

 

We recommended that Management: 

a. Allocate funds for the processing of the transfer of certificates of title and other 
incidental expenses; 

 

b. Fast track the transfer of ownership in the name of the Davao del Sur State College 
to avoid legal problems. If possible, request for a relocation survey to ensure that 

all proposed projects are in placed within the area of jurisdiction;    

 

c. Follow up the management of Municipality of  Sulop on the  Deed of Donation to 
be executed in the name of the Sulop extension Campus of the Davao del Sur State 

College; and 

 

d. Upon receipt of the Deed of Donation, process the titling thereof in the name of 
DSSC. 

 

Management Comment: 

 

In their letter-reply, the Management thanked the audit team’s observations and 

will comply with the recommendations. During the exit conference, the Supply Officer 

updated that he already taken initial steps in processing at the Registry of Deeds. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

 The Management’s comments are well noted as the Audit Team will monitor its 

compliance. 

 

 

Non-submission of Purchase Orders (POs) 

 

10. Copies of one hundred sixty (160) approved Purchase Orders (POs) and their 
supporting documents were not submitted to the Office of the Auditor within five (5) 

working days upon approval thereof contrary to COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated 



67 
 

February 12, 2009, thereby precluding timely auditorial review/technical evaluation 

thereof and preventing the Audit Team from informing management if there were 

deficiencies found in audit. 

 

Section 3.2.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009 provides:  

A copy of any purchase order irrespective of amount, and each 

and every supporting document, shall within five (5) working days from 

issuance thereof, be submitted to the Auditor concerned. Within the same 

period, the Auditor shall review and point out to management defects 

and/or deficiencies, if any, in the same manner provided in the second 

and third sentences of item 3.1.4 hereof. 

Likewise, the said Circular requires the agencies to furnish the auditor with a copy 

of the perfected contracts. Sections 3.1.1 and 3.1.2 provide: 

Within five (5) working days from the execution of a contract by 

the government or any of its subdivisions, agencies or instrumentalities, 

including government-owned and controlled corporations and their 

subsidiaries, a copy of said contract and each of all the documents 

forming part thereof by reference or incorporation shall be furnished to 

the Auditor of the agency concerned. In case of agencies audited on an 

engagement basis, submission of a copy of the contract and its supporting 

documents shall be to the Auditor of the mother agency or parent 

company, as the case may be. 

The copies of documents required to be submitted shall include but 

not limited to the following: 

a. Invitation to Apply for Eligibility and to Bid;

procurement and considered necessary in the auditorial review and in 

the technical evaluation thereof. 

 

 From May 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020, one hundred sixty (160) processed or 

approved POs were not furnished to the Auditor’s Office within 5 working days from 

approval thereof which prevented the Auditor from performing auditorial review and 

technical evaluation of such documents to determine compliance with applicable laws, 

rules and regulations and correct in a timely manner any material deficiencies found to be 

disadvantageous to the government. 

The management is enjoined to observe the submission within the prescribed 

deadline to avoid the penalty under Section 4.1 (Penalty Clause) of the above-cited Circular 

which states that “Any unjust failure of the officials and employees concerned to comply 

with the requirements herein imposed shall be subject to the administrative disciplinary 

action provided in (a) Section 127 of Presidential Decree No. 1445; (b) Section 55, Title 

I-B, Book V of the Revised Administrative Code of 1987; and (c) Section II of RA No. 

6713.” 

 

Recommendations: 

 

We recommended that Management: 

 

a. Direct the Procurement Service Unit to submit copies of all approved Purchase 
Orders during CY 2020 and furnish copies of any perfected contracts and all their 

supporting documents to the Office of the Auditor within fifteen (15) days from 

receipt of this AOM; and 

 

b. Direct the Procurement Service Unit to ensure that starting CY 2021, copies of 
POs/Contracts and all their supporting documents are completely submitted to the 

Office of the Auditor within the prescribed deadline in accordance with COA 

Circular 2009-001 to avoid the penalty imposed under the law. 

 

Management Comment: 

 

During the exit conference, the Procurement Unit Head updated that the CY 2021 

POs were already submitted to the Office of the Auditor, while the CY 2020 POs are still 

being retrieved and will submit the same once complete. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

 The Management’s comment and actions are well noted as the Audit Team will 

regularly monitor its compliance.
