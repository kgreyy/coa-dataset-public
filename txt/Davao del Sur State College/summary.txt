B.  Audit Methodology  

 

The Commission on Audit has been implementing risk-based audit in the conduct 

of its audit services.  However, to meet the evolving developments in public governance 

and fund management, the results-based audit approach was incorporated.  The integration 



ii 

 

of these two approaches, called the Integrated Results and Risk-Based Audit (IRRBA) 

Methodology was applied in the audit of the accounts and operations of the DSSC. 

 

 

C.  Scope of Audit

covered May 1 to December 31, 2020. The audit consisted of review of operating 

procedures, evaluation of the DSSC’s programs and projects, interview of concerned 

government officials and employees, verification, reconciliation, analysis of accounts and 

such other procedures considered necessary.

 Sources and Applications of Funds 

 

In the implementation of programs, projects and activities, the College has 

generated cash derived from national agency intended for the salary of the newly appointed 

President of DSSC starting October 1 to December 31,2020. The College also derived its 

income from collection of tuition and other fees that were constituted as Special Trust Fund 

(164) by virtue of RA 8292.

E.  Auditor’s Opinion on the Financial Statements  

 

The Auditor rendered a modified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the 

financial statements of the Davao del Sur State College for CY 2020 because of the 

exception noted in audit as discussed in detail in Part II of this Report as follows: 

  

a. The non-recording of book reconciling items amounting to P36,687,145.06 in 

the Cash in Bank-LCCA, thus materially understating the cash, income and 

other related accounts; 

  

b. The non-recognition of CY 2020 depreciation on the Plant, Property and 
Equipment Accounts of P82,206,883.26 thereby understating the depreciation 

expense and the related accumulated depreciation for the year; 

 

c. The failure to maintain by the Accountant of the PPE Ledger Cards and 
 

d. The non-submission of 1,189 Disbursement Vouchers and their supporting 
documents amounting to P27,492,616.63, thus rendering question on the 

regularity, propriety and legality of the related transactions and their effect on 

the related accounts in the financial statements.

F.  Summary of Significant Observations and Recommendations 

 

  The following are the significant audit observations and recommendations for the 

year 2020, which were duly discussed with DSSC management officials concerned last 

February 26, 2020.  Management’s views and comments were incorporated in the report 

where appropriate.  

 

1. Book reconciling items in the Cash in Bank-Local Currency, Current Account 

amounting to 36,687,145.06 were not recorded in the books of accounts as at 

December 31, 2020, hence resulting in the material understatement of the cash, 

income and other related accounts for the period. 

We recommended that Management: 

1. Direct the Accounting Office, Scholarship Office, and the Cashier to practice close 
coordination so as to completely and accurately record the transactions of the 

College, and the Scholarship Office to promptly monitor for any fund transfers and 

provide the necessary documents to the Accountant by closely coordinating with 

CHED Central Office/Regional Office to. If possible, Scholarship Coordinators and 

Officers-in-Charge must be put in place to focus especially on the Free Higher 

Education Program considering that the College has various type of scholarships;  

 

2. Institute monitoring mechanisms to timely identify those released and the 
unreleased scholarship/financial benefits to student beneficiaries to eliminate 

delays and/or failure in releasing such benefits. Moreover, proper identification 

facilitates the recording and posting into the appropriate accounts and subsidiary 

ledgers as either tuition/miscellaneous fees or other payables to students. 

 

3. Direct the Accountant to make the appropriate adjusting entries in the books of 
accounts to record the book reconciling items. Regularly request from the bank the 

bank statements as well as the Credit Memos and Debit Memos at least every end 

of the month and as needed and immediately prepare the bank reconciliation 

statements on a monthly basis; 

 

4. Advise the Accountant to follow the accrual basis of accounting in the recording of 
transactions in accordance with Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standards; 

and 

 

5. Direct the Cashier to issue the respective Official Receipts to CHED CO/RO and 
closely coordinate with the Accounting Office. The release of financial benefits to 

students by way of Cash Advance to Special Disbursing Officer is suggested to 

save cost of checks if paid individually to students. 

 

2. The provision for CY 2020 depreciation on the Property, Plant and Equipment’s 
(PPE) net book value of P82,206,883.26 was not recognized by the Accountant as 

at December 31, 2020, thereby understating the Depreciation Expense and the 

related Accumulated Depreciation for the year. 



v 

 

 

The non-maintenance by the Accountant of the Property, Plant and Equipment 

(PPE) Ledger Cards (PPELC), that should have been used to reconcile the Report 

on the Physical Count of PPE (RPCPPE) as prepared/submitted by the Supply 

Officer, has resulted in the failure to identify/rectify any variance that could have 

establish the accuracy and reliability of the balances of the PPEs as reflected in 

the Financial Statements amounting to P82,206,883.26, inconsistent with the 

pertinent sections of the Government Accounting Manual.  

 

We recommended that Management: 

1. Assess the present condition of the College’s properties and equipment as there 
may be unserviceable properties subject for disposal and eventual derecognition in 

the PPE accounts, and thereafter determine the remaining useful life of the PPEs 

particularly those transferred assets from SPAMAST. Should the DSSC 

Management decide to re-evaluate the estimated useful life of the assets, the 

guidelines are provided under Section 27, Chapter 10 of GAM Vol. 1 so that the 

appropriate computation of the depreciation expense may be provided;  

 

2. Direct the Accountant to recognize the depreciation expense on a monthly basis 
starting CY 2021. Make the necessary adjustments to in the beginning balance of 

the PPE, net of Accumulated Depreciation after computing for the appropriate 

depreciation; and 

 

3. Advise the Accountant to maintain the PPE Ledger Cards pursuant to Section 42, 
Chapter 10 of the GAM Volume 1. See Appendix 70 of the GAM for the prescribed 

format. Ensure that the PPELC is regularly reconciled with the Property Cards 

maintained by the Property/Supply Officer. 

 

3. A total of 1,189 Disbursement Vouchers and their supporting documents 
amounting to P27,492,616.63 was not submitted to the Office of the Auditor, 

hence, the timely and proper submission of reports prescribed in Section 59(20), 

Chapter 19, Volume I, Government Accounting Manual (GAM) and as required 

under Section 122(1) of P.D. No. 1445 were not complied with, thus rendering 

questions on the regularity, propriety and legality of the related transactions, as 

the same could not be ascertained in a timely manner. 

 

We recommended that Management: 

1. Comply with the requirements set forth under Section 59(20), Chapter 19, Volume 
I, GAM and Section 122(1) of P.D. No. 1445 in the submission of financial reports 

in order to have a reliable basis in the verification and analysis of the financial 

transactions of the agency; and 

 

2. Require the officer responsible to comply with the deficiencies noted herein and 
submit immediately the lacking 1,189 Disbursement Vouchers along with their 



vi 

 

supporting documents pertaining to CY 2020 in order to prevent the possible 

suspension in audit.
