AUDIT OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS





FINANCIAL ISSUES



Accrued Expenses



1)		Expenses totaling P4.208 million incurred in CY 2019 for payment of Special Allowances for the Judiciary (SAJ) were erroneously charged against CY 2020 funds, contrary to the accrual basis of accounting and recognition of liability.

	

	1)			Section 119 of Presidential Decree (PD) 1445, Accounting for obligations and expenditures states that “all lawful expenditures and obligations incurred during the year shall be taken up in the accounts of that year”.

	

	2)			Section 2(a) Chapter 2 of Volume 1 Government Accounting Manual (GAM), provides: “Accrual Basis – means a basis of accounting under which transactions and other events are recognized when they occur (and not only when cash or its equivalent is received or paid). Therefore, the transactions and events are recognized in the accounting records and recognized in the financial statements of the periods to which they relate. The elements recognized under accrual accounting are assets, liabilities, net assets/equity, revenue, and expenses.”

	

	3)			Payment of the SAJ (thru Payroll Fund Account) covering the period from July to December 2019 paid under Check No. 852262 dated February 7, 2020 in the amount of P4,208,340.00 was recognized as current expenditures (Other Bonuses and Allowances) and charged against CY 2020 funds, contrary to the above cited law and regulation.

	

	4)			 As a result, the beginning balance of the Due to Officers and Employees account for CY 2020 was understated while the Other Bonuses and Allowances account for the current year was overstated.

	

	5)			This prior period improper charging which is deemed material, affects the fair presentation of the Financial Statements (FS), thus, requires correction by retrospective restatement, as provided for under Sections 42(b) and 43, Chapter 19 of the GAM Vol. I, implementing the specific provisions of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSASs).

	

	6)			The Accountant acknowledged the deficiency and reasoned that the inadvertence was in view of the numerous periodic reports at year end.

	

	

	

	

	7)			We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to:

	

a)		Strictly adhere to the accrual basis of accounting by recognizing all transactions and events as they occur and to report the same in the FS in the period to which they relate; and

		

b)		Properly present the adjusted balances of each affected component of net assets/equity by restating the corresponding prior year balances of the affected accounts shown as corresponding figures for the current year (CY 2020) FS, in compliance with the requirement of IPSASs.

	

		

	OTHER FINANCIAL ISSUES

	

	Incomplete Submission of Disbursement Vouchers



2)		Management's incomplete submission of paid Disbursement Vouchers (DVs) covering disbursement transactions for CY 2020 totaling P12.130 million in view of the unnecessary routing of the same to the Internal Audit Service (IAS) after payment, hindered the timely application of audit procedures to determine the validity and propriety of said transactions and immediate communication of deficiencies, if any, to Management.

	

	1)			Sections 4 (6) and 119 of PD 1445 provide that claims against government funds shall be supported with complete documentations.

	

	2)			Disbursement Vouchers are the forms used to pay an obligation to employees/ individuals/agencies/creditors for goods purchased or services rendered.  These DVs are required to be submitted through the Chief Accountant, to the COA office for post-audit, within the first 10 days of the ensuing month, pursuant to Section 7.2.1 (a) of COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009.  



	3)			Adherence to the internal controls governing financial transactions ensures that the disbursements are processed correctly.  These DVs complete with proper documentations and duly approved, would sufficiently establish validity of the claims.

		

	4)			Internal Control, as defined under Internal Control Standards for the Philippine Public Sector (ICSPPS), is an integral process that is effected by an agency’s management and personnel, and is designed to address risks and provide reasonable assurance that in pursuit of the agency’s mission, the general objectives are being achieved.

	

	5)			However, inventory of the DVs submitted covering CY 2020 for all funds revealed that as of February 28, 2021, at least 79 DVs totaling P12,129,693.57 have not yet been submitted to the COA Office, as required.  Details are shown in Table No.1.

	6)			Analysis of the above data shows that 75 out of the 79 DVs or 95 per cent were paid during the last quarter of the year, and that a number of transactions have significant amounts such as the disbursement for SB payroll in the total amount at P4,418,549.17, remittances of JDF Loans in the total amount of P697,201.50 and the payment of telephone bills four times in a single month in the total amount of P244,952.82.

		

	7)			The undue delay or non-submission of the DVs and their supporting documents did not provide the basis for the propriety of the payment of the claims and the expenditures reported in the Financial Statements.  It likewise hindered the timely application of audit procedures, to determine the validity and propriety of the transactions and immediate identification/correction of irregularities/deficiencies, if any.  Moreover, it may warrant the issuance of Notice of Suspension/Disallowance.

		

	8)			The Accountant reasoned that aside from the current pandemic that prevented them from the prompt submission of the DV owing to the skeletal workforce, there is also delay in the receipt of the DVs from the Court’s IAS.

	

	9)			Audit verification disclosed that as a matter of routine procedure, as prescribed in the Flowchart Payment Process under the Memorandum of the Presiding Justice dated July 6, 2018, the IAS conducts review of all DVs prior to submission to the COA.

		

	10)			The review of the SB IAS on disbursement vouchers is basically in accordance with ICSPPS guidelines in enhancing good governance, transparency, accountability, efficiency and effectiveness of government operations, including risk management and the internal control framework of its agency.

		

	11)			The Memorandum directs the Budget, Finance and Property and Supply Sections to strictly follow the designed flowchart on the “Procedures in the Payment Process of Goods/Services Delivered or Rendered by the Suppliers”.  

	

	12)			The flowchart provides the end of the payment process as follows:

		

	Before preparation of reports, the Cashier section shall submit the original copy of the paid Disbursement Vouchers and supporting documents for the day to the IAS for review and examination as part of post audit and return the same to the Cashier section the following day.

	

	13)			The Management has the primary responsibility for developing the detailed policies, procedures, and practices to fit their agency’s operations and to ensure that they are built into and an integral part of operations.

	

	14)			We recommended and Management agreed to require the:

Accountant to:

			a)	Immediately cause the submission of all unsubmitted DVs, for verification and post audit; 



			b)	Consider to institute effective strategies to facilitate the prompt submission of the DVs or within 10 days after end of each month;



Head of Internal Audit Service to:

			c)	Refrain from conducting post-audit but to examine and contribute to the ongoing effectiveness of the internal control system through their evaluations and recommendations designed to add value and improve the SB's operations.;



Chief, Budget and Finance Division to:

	

			d)		Provide the necessary oversight to ensure compliance with the financial reporting requirements; and

	

			e)	Assess management and operational compliance are in conformity with existing laws and other regulatory requirements.

		

		

Unserviceable Properties remain undisposed



3)		Unserviceable Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) with carrying amounts totaling P1.889 million still remain undisposed as at December 31, 2020, thus, exposing them to further deterioration, diminution of value, incurrence of additional storage, and deprived the agency of additional income that may be derived from disposal.

	

	1)			Section 79 of PD No. 1445 provides that “when government property has become unserviceable for any cause, or is no longer needed, it shall, upon application of the officer accountable therefor, be inspected by the head of the agency, or his duly authorized representative in the presence of the auditor concerned and, if found to be valueless or unsalable, it may be destroyed in their presence.”

	

	2)			Executive Order (EO) No. 309 s. 1996 emphasized the need to expedite the disposal of unserviceable equipment and property of the government to avoid further deterioration, especially those exposed to the elements.

	

	3)			Section 40, Chapter 10. GAM Volume 1 provides the policies on idle, unserviceable and fully depreciated PPE where it states, among others;



	a)				A PPE is said to be fully depreciated when the carrying amount is equal to zero or residual value.  The cost of fully depreciated assets remaining in service and the related accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses shall not be removed from the accounts.

			

	b)				A PPE is said to be unserviceable if it is no longer capable of providing the entity with future economic benefits or service potential. 

	

	c)				All unserviceable property shall be reported in the Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP). PPE reported in the IIRUP shall be dropped from the books by debiting Impairment Loss-Property, Plant and Equipment (cost of the PPE less Accumulated Depreciation)

		

	4)			A Journal Entry Voucher (JEV) shall be prepared by the Accounting Division/Unit to derecognize the asset from the books of accounts only after its disposal.



	5)	The Court’s PPE accounts as at December 31, 2020 with aggregate balance of P330,664,559.60 include unserviceable properties consisting of motor vehicles and various equipment with carrying amounts totaling P1,888,600.57. These unserviceable properties are identified as such in the current year’s RPCPPE but still included in the inventory. Details are in Table No. 2.

	6)			The Audit Team’s ocular inspection of the SB’s stockyard confirmed the unserviceable state of the motor vehicles as indicated in Table No. 2.  The three big buses definitely occupy sizeable space which could have otherwise been allotted to other serviceable vehicles.

	

	7)			Also found in the stockyard are two idle units - Honda CRV 2006 model and KIA Sorrento 2012 model, which were not reported as unserviceable, hence not included in the list above, pending the issuance of an En Banc Resolution.

	

	8)			Verification showed that the additional two units have acquisition dates of 2007 and 2013, and had their last repairs done during January and February, 2020, incurring repair costs of P52,650.36 and P60,576.00, respectively.  However, even after the aforesaid repairs, the vehicles still did not achieve optimum performance. 

	

	9)			The Supervising Judicial Staff Officer (SJSO), Administrative Division commented that the disposal thru donation of the three big buses to TESDA-Abra is already in process while motor vehicles not yet reported as unserviceable are still used as standby service units due to lack of available motor vehicles. 

	

	10)			The Sandiganbayan in its Office Order No. 234-2019, dated September 18, 2019 clearly defined the grounds, modes and procedures of disposal on its unserviceable motor vehicles. The subject PPEs as mentioned above, meet all the conditions and restrictions stated in the Office Order.

	

	11)			Inquiry from the Officer-in-Charge of the Property and Supply Section disclosed that the delay in the disposal is due to the lack of interested buyers, given the actual state of the motor vehicles.  For the other equipment, the Audit Team was informed that there are still ongoing reconciliation and sorting of various property documents owing to the early retirement of the then Property Officer.

	

	

	12)			The non-disposal of the unserviceable properties may result in their further deterioration, incurrence of additional storage, and loss of possible income from sale thereof.

	

	13)			We recommended and Management agreed to require the: 

	OIC-Property and Supply Section to:

	

a)	Facilitate disposal of the unserviceable motor vehicles such as but not limited to public auction (one lot sale); sale thru negotiation if there is failure of bidding, or donation/transfer to other government agencies, giving priority to the big buses, and submit the original Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) to the Accounting Division; 

	

b)	Develop and operate a more systematic process to expedite the documentation for the disposal of all unserviceable properties or those which are deemed beyond economic repair; and



	Accountant to:

	

c)	Prepare Journal Entry Voucher to drop from the books the respective carrying amounts of the unserviceable properties after the disposal, with proper documentations such as the IIRUP, photos, and Official Receipt for the sale.

	

	

	Loss of Property



4)	Accounting policies on loss of property were not complied with, resulting in the non-derecognition from the books of the value of 35 units of  lost Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Equipment totaling P1.551 million, and the inability to establish the liability of the concerned accountable officer/s for the loss of these Equipment, thereby overstating the value of the Property, Plant and Equipment account, and understating the related Accumulated Depreciation and the Due from Officers and Employees accounts.

	

	1)			Section 41(a), Chapter 10 of the GAM, Volume I prescribes that when government properties are lost due to fire, theft, or other casualty or force majeure, the officer accountable therefore or having custody thereof shall immediately notify the Auditor concerned and, within 30 days or such longer period as the COA or Auditor may in the particular case allow, shall present his application for relief, with the available supporting evidence.

	

	2)			Section 41(b) of the same Chapter states that the lost property and the related accumulated depreciation and impairment loss shall be derecognized in the books upon receipt of the Report of Lost, Stolen, Damaged, Destroyed Property (RLSDDP) supported by a Notice of Loss prepared and submitted by the Accountable Officer.  The loss shall be charged to the account Loss of Assets at an amount equal to its carrying amount.



	3)			Moreover, paragraph 82, IPSAS No. 17, provides that the carrying amount of the PPE shall be derecognized upon disposal or when no future economic benefits or service potential is expected from its use or disposal.

	

	4)			The SB’s Statement of Financial Position as of December 31, 2020 reflects the balance of P45,067,834.40  in the Information and Communication Technology Equipment account.   



	5)			Analysis of the details of the account revealed that no derecognition was made during the year for the loss of the following 35 units of ICT equipment as indicated in the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) as of year-end:

	6)			Our audit verification however disclosed the lack of adequate processes as to the transfers of property from one unit to another are not properly controlled and documented, and lack of coordination among offices in charge of pertinent transactions relative to the lost or damaged properties and their eventual disposal.  

	

	7)			The circumstances covering the loss have yet to be established and verified by the Property and Supply Unit, inasmuch as no Request for Relief from Property Accountability has been received.  The persons accountable for the lost properties have also not been identified as the verification of the Accountability Receipt for Equipment (ARE) is still underway.



	8)			Moreover, it was noted that there were ICT Equipment in the Property and Supply Unit’s stockroom that were previously surrendered by the respective custodians due to some defects or obsolescence.  However, such items which were declared lost or missing cannot be identified with the units found in the stockroom due to the lack of decals with property numbers. 

	

	9)			Inquiry from the Property and Supply Unit disclosed that the losses or missing ICT equipment were discovered only after a thorough inventory and reconciliation with Property records, in response to the prior year’s Audit Recommendation hence, no RLSDDP or Notice of Loss yet was submitted to the Accounting Unit to support derecognition of the pertinent PPE account.  It was likewise informed that other end-users of the properties have already retired or no longer in active service, and have since been cleared of their property accountabilities.  

	

	10)			Audit believes that this lack of proper documentations to recognize losses affected the reliability of the recorded ICT Equipment account and its related Accumulated Depreciation, as well as the Due from Officers and Employees account.



	11)			It may likewise be reminded that as provided under Section 105(1) of P.D. 1445, every officer accountable for government property is liable for all losses, damages, or deterioration occasioned by negligence in the keeping or use of the property, whether or not it be at the time in his actual custody.  

	

	12)			We recommended and Management agreed to require the:

Inventory Committee to:

a)		Investigate  the deficiencies noted and appropriate actions should be made, if any, and comply with the pertinent procedures in the handling of lost properties pursuant to the provisions of Section 41(a), Chapter 10 of the GAM, Volume I;

	

	Property Officer to:



b)		Maintain complete and updated PPE records for efficiency in the determination of property accountabilities; 

	

c)		Identify all the persons accountable for the filing of request for relief from property accountability, based on existing documents related to the lost or missing properties; and



eennce,er accountable thereforee Notice of LossitiesChief Accountant to:



d)		Prepare the JEV to record the reported losses and set up the appropriate receivable account, Due from Officers and Employees, upon identification of the responsible Accountable Officer. 

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	COMPLIANCE ISSUES

	

	Procurement Process

	

5)	The lack of adequate and effective procurement process caused prolonged processing time from 32 to 367 days, of procurement requisitions totaling P13.957 million thus, preventing the immediate provision of critical logistical support to the requesting operating units.

		

	1)			Section 3 of the Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (RIRR) of Republic Act (RA) 9184 provides the Governing Principles on Government Procurement, to wit: 

		

	a) Transparency in the procurement process and in the implementation of procurement contracts through wide dissemination of bid opportunities and participation of pertinent non-government organizations. 

		

	b) Competitiveness by extending equal opportunity to enable private contracting parties who are eligible and qualified to participate in competitive bidding. 

		

	c) Streamlined procurement process that will uniformly apply to all government procurement. The procurement process shall be simple and made adaptable to advances in modern technology in order to ensure an effective and efficient method. 

		

	d) System of accountability where both the public officials directly or indirectly involved in the procurement process as well as in the implementation of procurement contracts and the private parties that deal with GoP are, when warranted by circumstances, investigated and held liable for their actions relative thereto. 

		

	e)  Public monitoring of the procurement process and the implementation of awarded contracts with the end in view of guaranteeing that these contracts are awarded pursuant to the provisions of the Act and this IRR, and that all these contracts are performed strictly according to specifications.

		 

	2)			Likewise, Section 7.3 of RIRR of RA 9184  states that: “Based on the specific needs, the end-user or implementing units of the Procuring Entity shall be responsible for the preparation of all documents necessary for the procurement activity, including but shall not be limited to, the technical specifications, scope of work, or terms of reference.”

	

	3)			The above procurement function is delegated to the Property and Supply Section.  Crucial in its contracting function is to ensure that the acquisition of goods and services are made in a manner that enhances access, competition, fairness and transparency, which results in the best value for money.

	

	4)			No procurement shall be undertaken unless it is in accordance with the approved Annual Procurement Plan (APP), including approved changes thereto. The APP must be consistent with the duly approved yearly budget of the Procuring Entity and shall bear the approval of the HoPE or second-ranking official designated by the HoPE to act on his behalf. (Section 7.2, RRIR of RA 9184) 



	5)			The Procurement Request (PR) is a tangible authorization to obtain supplies and materials and other items for official use.  It is used to request the Property Office the purchase of inventory/item not available on stock and it is the basis in preparing the Purchase Order (PO).

	

	6)			In our review of the Court’s procurement process, we noted the lack of adequate procedures to facilitate consistency in controls to optimize operational objectives and conform to planned activities of the requisitioning offices.  

	

	7)			Procurement workflow actions were neither systematically done nor efficiently carried out, as there were no adequate criteria to identify or keep track PRs to be processed, or consolidate common requirements, which resulted in unclear decisions on why some requests were prioritized over the others.  

	

	8)			The processed PRs covering CYs 2019 to 2020 showed that it takes a considerable number of days before a requisition is acted upon.  Table No. 4 provides details of PRs processed in excess of one month to over one year from the time these were received up to the time the quotation/bid was solicited:

	9)			Inquiry from the Officer-in-Charge, Property and Supply Section, disclosed that not all PRs were assigned control numbers to uniquely identify the document and serve as reference in tracking the status of the requisition which initiates the purchasing process.  Only a logbook is used to record all PRs received, which did not help in the efficient monitoring of the same.

	

	10)			The Audit Team believes that the Officer-in-Charge can either approve and generate a PO for funding approval, or send back the request to the requester with specific comments as to why the request was denied.  Section 7.3 of RIRR of RA 9184 states that Based on the specific needs, the end-user or implementing units of the Procuring Entity shall be responsible for the preparation of all documents necessary for the procurement activity, including but shall not be limited to, the technical specifications, scope of work, or terms of reference.



	11)			The Court in accomplishing its procurement function during the Calendar Year 2020 had been consistent in complying with the “Recommended Earliest Possible Time and Maximum Period for the Procurement of Goods and Services Allowed" in all their procurement transactions. However, it did not make the procurement process transparent and streamlined to be simple and made adaptable to advances in modern technology in order to ensure an effective and efficient method. Moreover, this may lead to unclear accountability for performance and execution of procurement functions, and may likewise affect some key activities or functions impacting on the deliverables of the requesting office/division.

	

	

	

	

	

	

	12)			We recommended and Management agreed to require the Officer-in- Charge, Property and Supply Section to:



a)		Establish and conduct periodic assessment of the procurement processes and procedures to streamline procurement activities pursuant to Section 3(c) of the revised IRR of RA 9184; and



b)		Take custody of procurement documents and other records to ensure that all procurements undertaken by the procuring entity are properly documented.

	

	

	OTHER COMPLIANCE ISSUES

	

Gender and Development (GAD)



6)		The Sandiganbayan utilized only five per cent or P1.497 million of the budgeted amount of P31.638 million for its Gender and Development (GAD) plans for CY 2020 thereby, affecting the full attainment of its GAD Plan and Objectives.

	1)			Section 31 of the General Provisions of Republic Act (RA) No.11465 or the General Appropriations Act for FY 2020 requires that the GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of the agencies, which shall be at least five percent of their budgets. For this purpose, activities currently being undertaken by agencies which relate to GAD or those that contribute to poverty alleviation, economic empowerment especially of marginal women, protection, promotion and fulfillment of women’s human rights, and practice of gender-responsive governance are considered sufficient compliance with said requirement. Utilization of the GAD budget shall be evaluated based on the GAD performance indicators identified by said agencies.

	

	2)			Of the 55 GAD planned activities for the year, only 18 activities or 33 percent thereof were accomplished, with corresponding expenditures incurred totaling P1,497,441.97 or five percent of the total budget of P31,638,000.00, as itemized in Table No. 5:

	3)			In our interview, Management commented that, due to the skeletal workforce during the pandemic, their activities had focused mostly on webinars utilizing various meeting platform, such that expenditures incurred were mainly for honoraria of lecturers and internet subscriptions. Furthermore, the attribution for the salaries and wages of the participants were not also accounted in the total expenses reported therein. 

	

	4)			Validation of the trainings conducted cannot be made inasmuch as the expenditures were not supported with complete and necessary documents, such as venues and actual programs.

	

	5)			We believe that while the low implementation rate may well be attributed to the effects of quarantine restrictions related to the COVID-19 outbreak, however, alternative course/s of action/s could have been promptly undertaken to adjust and/or redirect the other activities to maximize the attainment of the goals. The underutilization of GAD Fund resulted in non-attainment of GAD Plan and Objectives.

	

	

	

	

	

	6)			We recommended and Management agreed to direct the GAD Focal Point System (GFPS) to:



a)		Reevaluate the current project approaches and present a modified plan, and to consider implementing planned activities through other forms such as integrating GAD programs /projects in the regular activities of the agency and apply the applicable GAD Attribution thereon; and



b)		Continue to enhance the implementation of GAD plans and projects to better address the gender issues and concerns.

	

Senior Citizens and Persons with Disability (PWD)

7)		The SB has complied with Section 32 of the General Provisions of RA No. 11465 (FY 2020 GAA) on the formulation and implementation of programs, projects and activities (PPA) for the senior citizens and PWDs. 

	

	1)			Section 32 of the GAA for FY 2020 requires all agencies of the government to formulate plans, programs and projects intended to address the concerns of senior citizens and persons with disability (PWDs) insofar as it relates to their mandated functions and integrate the same in their regular activities. Moreover, all government infrastructures and facilities shall provide architectural or structural features, designs or facilities that will reasonably enhance the mobility, safety and welfare of persons with disability pursuant to Batas Pambansa Blg. 344 and RA No. 7277, as amended.

	

	2)			The Court created a Senior Citizens and PWDs Committee as a sub-committee under the employees’ Welfare Committee per SB Administrative Order No. 188-2014 dated May 29, 2014, later subsumed by the GAD Focal Point under SB Administrative Order No. 108-2017 dated March 27, 2017, purposely to draw and initiate plans, programs and activities intended for the support and welfare of employees who are senior citizens defined under RA No. 9257, as amended by RA No. 9994 and/or for PWDs defined under RA No. 7277.

	

	3)			On January 13, 2021, the Committee provided the Audit Team its PPAs for the Court’s senior citizens and PWDs Accomplishment Report for CY 2020. During the year, the Committee carried out the following PPAs, among others:
