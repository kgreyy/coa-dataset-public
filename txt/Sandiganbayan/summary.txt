A)	Introduction



The Sandiganbayan (SB) is a special court of justice provided in Article XIII of the 1973 Constitution but was established only on June 11, 1978 with the issuance of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1486, amended by PD 1606, Batas Pambansa Blg. 129 also known as “The Judiciary Reorganization Act of 1980” and Republic Act (RA) Nos. 7975 and 8249.   



Originally, the SB had three divisions until it expanded to five divisions of three members each on March 30, 1995. With the passage of RA No. 10660, otherwise known as “An Act Strengthening the Functional and Structural Organization of the Sandiganbayan” that the President signed into law on April 16, 2015, the anti-graft court now has seven divisions with three members each or a total of 21 Justices. The Court is currently headed by Presiding Justice Amparo M. Cabotaje-Tang. 

The SB is a constitutionally mandated anti-graft court which was envisioned to be a judicial institution that the Filipino people can rely on for the attainment of the highest norms of official conduct and as such, embark on a mission to give life and meaning to the constitutional precept that a public office is a public trust and to impress upon public officers and employees that they are at all times accountable to the people with their duty to serve with the highest degree of responsibility, integrity, loyalty and efficiency.    



To realize its vision and mission, the SB aims to conduct expeditious trials of criminal and civil cases involving offenses committed by public officers and employees brought within their vested jurisdiction.



As of December 31, 2020, the SB has a manpower complement of 477 personnel composed of 316 permanent, 129 co-terminous and 32 casual positions in the performance of adjudicative support functions with some non-adjudicative or administrative functions among the Office of the Clerk of Court (OCC), Judicial Records Division, Management Information Systems Division, Internal Audit Services, Legal Research and Technical Staff, Administrative Division, Budget and Finance Division and Security and Sheriff Services Division.

C)	Scope of Audit



A financial and compliance audit was conducted on the accounts and operations of the SB for the year ended December 31, 2020. It was conducted to a) verify the level of reliance that may be placed on Management’s assertions on the financial statements; b) determine the extent of compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations; c) recommend agency improvement opportunities; and d) determine the extent of implementation of prior years’ audit recommendations.





D)	Audit Opinion on the Financial Statements



The Auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the financial statements of the Sandiganbayan for CY 2020 due to accounting errors and omissions totaling P4.208 million, the details of which are discussed in Part II of this report and the analysis of their effects on the Financial Statements (FS)  are shown in Annex B:



1)		Expenses totaling P4.208 million incurred in CY 2019 for payment of Special Allowances for the Judiciary (SAJ) were erroneously charged against CY 2020 funds, contrary to the accrual basis of accounting and recognition of liability. (Observation No. 1)

	

		We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to:

a)		Strictly adhere to the accrual basis of accounting by recognizing all transactions and events as they occur and to report the same in the Financial Statements (FS) in the period to which they relate; and 

		

b)		Properly present the adjusted balances of each affected component of net assets/equity by restating the corresponding prior year balances of the affected accounts shown as corresponding figures for the current year (CY 2020) FS, in compliance with the requirement of International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSASs).





E)	Other Significant Observations and Recommendations



The following are other significant audit observations and recommendations, the details of which are discussed in Part II of this report:



 1.    Management's incomplete submission of paid Disbursement Vouchers (DVs) covering disbursement transactions for CY 2020 totaling P12.130 million in view of the unnecessary routing of the same to the Internal Audit Service (IAS) after payment, hindered the timely application of audit procedures to determine the validity and propriety of said transactions and immediate communication of deficiencies, if any, to Management. (Observation No.2)

		

	We recommended and Management agreed to require the:

		

	Accountant to:

	

a)		Immediately cause the submission of all unsubmitted DVs, for verification and post audit; 

	

b)		Consider to institute effective strategies to facilitate the prompt submission of the DVs or within 10 days after end of each month;

	

	Head of Internal Audit Service to :

	

c)		Refrain from conducting post-audit but to examine and contribute to the ongoing effectiveness of the internal control system through their evaluations and recommendations designed to add value and improve the SB’s  operations.;

	

	

	

	Chief, Budget and Finance Division to:

	

d)		Provide the necessary oversight to ensure compliance with the financial reporting requirements; and

	

e)		Assess management and operational compliance are in conformity with existing laws and other regulatory requirements.

	

2)		Unserviceable Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) with carrying amounts totaling P1.889 million still remain undisposed as at December 31, 2020, thus, exposing them to further deterioration and diminution of value, incurrence of additional storage, and deprived the agency of additional income that may be derived from disposal. (Observation No.3)

	

		We recommended and Management agreed to require the: 

		

	OIC-Property and Supply Section to:

	

a)	Facilitate disposal of the unserviceable motor vehicles such as but not limited to public auction (one lot sale); sale thru negotiation if there is failure of bidding, or donation/transfer to other government agencies, giving priority to the big buses, and submit the original Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) to the Accounting Division; 

	

b)	Develop and operate a more systematic process to expedite the documentation for the disposal of all unserviceable properties or those which are deemed beyond economic repair; and

	

	Accountant to:

	

c)	Prepare Journal Entry Voucher to drop from the books the respective carrying amounts of the unserviceable properties after the disposal, with proper documentations such as the IIRUP, photos, and Official Receipt for the sale.

	

3)		Accounting policies on loss of property were not complied with, resulting in the non-derecognition from the books of the value of 35 units of  lost Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Equipment totaling P1.551 million, and the inability to establish the liability of the concerned accountable officer/s for the loss of these Equipment, thereby overstating the value of the Property, Plant and Equipment account, and understating the related Accumulated Depreciation and the Due from Officers and Employees accounts. (Observation No.4)

	

	

		We recommended and Management agreed to require the:

		

Inventory Committee to:



a)		Investigate  the deficiencies noted and appropriate actions should be made, if any, and comply with the pertinent procedures in the handling of lost properties pursuant to the provisions of Section 41(a), Chapter 10 of the GAM, Volume I;



Property Officer to:



b)		Maintain complete and updated PPE records for efficiency in the determination of property accountabilities; 

	

c)		Identify all the persons accountable for the filing of request for relief from property accountability, based on existing documents related to the lost or missing properties; and

	

	Chief Accountant to:



d)		Prepare the JEV to record the reported losses and set up the appropriate receivable account, Due from Officers and Employees, upon determination of the proper accountable officer.

	

Other equally significant audit observations and recommendations were also noted and discussed in detail under Part II of this report.

	

The observations and recommendations covered in this report have been communicated and discussed with Management through the Summary of Audit Observations and Recommendations issued on May 14, 2021.  Management comments were incorporated in the report, where appropriate.

	

	

F)	Status of Audit Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges

	

	There were no audit suspensions, disallowances and charges issued during the year.  Deficiencies noted during the year were either complied with or settled immediately upon communicating to the concerned officials and employees of such findings.  There were also no unsettled audit suspensions, disallowances and charges in prior years.
