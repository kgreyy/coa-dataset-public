PART II - OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

 

FINANCIAL AUDIT 

 

Accounting Errors, Omissions, and Misstatements 

 

1. The financial statements (FSs) of the National Museum of the Philippines (NMP) 
are misstated in the aggregate amount of ₱1,111,063,504.27 on account of errors, 

omissions and improper accounting treatment of transactions that are considered 

as departures from the International Public Sector Accounting Standards 

(IPSAS), hence affecting the fair presentation of its financial position as at 

December 31, 2020, and its financial performance and cash flows for the year then 

ended. 

 

1.1 Section 15, Chapter 2 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for 
National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I states that: “The financial 

statements (FSs) shall present fairly the financial position, financial 

performance and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful 

representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in 

accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, 

revenue, expenses set out in Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standards1 

(PPSAS).” 

 

1.2 Moreover, Section 111 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 provides that the 
accounts of the agency shall be kept in such detail as necessary to meet the needs 

of the agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish the information needed 

by the fiscal or control agencies of the government. 

 

1.3 Audit of the accounts and related transactions showed various accounting 
misstatements, omissions and errors in several of its accounts as of December 

31, 2020, as shown below:

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS 

 

a) Understatement in CIB-LCCA due to unrecorded book reconciling items and 
unaccounted discrepancy  

 

1.5 Section 74 of PD No. 1445 states that at the close of each month, depositories 
shall report to the agency head, in such form as he may direct, the condition of 

the agency account standing on their books. The head of the agency shall see to 

it that a reconciliation is made between the balance shown in the reports and the 

balance found in the books of the agency. 

 

1.6 Sound internal control on cash requires prompt and correct recording and 
reporting of transactions to ensure that financial information is reliable, accurate 

and reported within the given accounting period. 

 

1.7 The reported balance of the CIB-LCCA was ₱21,300,036.21 as at yearend, 
which consists of seven current accounts maintained at Land Bank of the 

Philippines (LBP), broken down as follows:

Total discrepancy   98,206.04 

 

1.10 The discrepancy of ₱63,899.38 was fully accounted but remained unadjusted as 
at yearend which resulted in the understatement of the CIB – LCCA by the same 

amount. On the other hand, the amount of ₱20,306.66 in LBP Account No. 0012-

1172-80 was not accounted due to the absence of Bank Reconciliation Statement 

(BRS). 

 

1.11 We have also observed that the subsidiary ledger (SL) of the CIB-LCCA SPCA– 
MEF Fund 06 has an abnormal negative balance due to an incorrect adjusting 

entry made on September 17, 2019 per Journal Entry Voucher (JEV)-2019-09-

000331.  The adjusting entry amounting to ₱71,800.00 was made to reclassify a 

collection to the SL of the RF and was supposed to be credited from the SL of 

the SPCA instead of the SPCA-MEF.  The details of the aforementioned 

deficiency and the suggested correcting entry is as follows:

58 
 

1.12 Due to the discrepancy, the balance of CIB-LCCA and other affected accounts 
were inaccurate and not fairly presented in the FS.  

 

1.13 We recommended that Management direct the Accounting Section to: 
 

a. effect the necessary adjustments for the unrecorded reconciling items in 
the amount of ₱63,899.38 before closing the books of accounts to reflect 

the true balance of CIB-LCCA and make an adjusting entry to correct 

the negative subsidiary ledger (SL) of the SPCA-MEF Fund 06; and 
 

b. prepare the Bank Reconciliation Statement (BRS) for LBP Account No. 
0012-1172-80 to fully account the discrepancy of  ₱20,306.66. 

 

 

RECEIVABLES 

 

b) Unrecorded receipt of airline tickets from DBM-PS 
 

1.14 The total reported balance of Receivable accounts is misstated by ₱707,682.73 
due to unrecorded receipt of prior and current years’ airline tickets from DBM-

PS with the following details:

Subtotal  141,258.29 

Total  707,682.73 

 

1.15 Copies of the airline bookings were not provided by the Supply Management 
Section (SMS) to the Accounting Section. As a consequence, the Travelling 

Expenses in Calendar Years (CYs) 2019 and 2020 were understated by 

₱566,424.44 and ₱141,258.29, correspondingly, thus the Due from NGAs - 

DBM-PS and Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) accounts were overstated by 

₱707,682.73 and ₱566,424.44, respectively. 

  

1.16 We recommended that Management require the Accounting Section to: 
 

a. prepare the necessary adjusting entries for the misstatements noted to 
properly reflect the correct outstanding balance of the account Due from 

NGAs and affected accounts; and 



 

59 
 

b. coordinate closely with the SMS to address the recurrence of deficiencies 
in the recording of transactions with the DBM-PS. 

 

 

PREPAYMENT 

 

c) Recoupment of Advances to Contractors was erroneously credited to Other 
Payables account. 

 

1.17 The breakdown of payment in September 2015 to Digiscript for the second 
progress billing of the project “Detailed Engineering Studies of Heritage 

Structures Declared as NCT/ICP in Bohol and Samar Affected by Calamities” is 

shown below:

Amount 

(In PhP)

Due to BIR (389,070.56) 

Net Amount (Check No. 1208852) 4,404,278.75 

 

1.18 However, it was observed in JEV No. 15-09-516  dated September 2015 that the 
recoupment of advances in the amount of ₱809,266.77 was erroneously credited 

to the Other Payables account together with the retention fee of ₱622,512.90; 

thus a total amount of ₱1,431,779.67 was credited to the Other Payables account 

instead of just ₱622,512.90.  The erroneous entry made resulted in the 

overstatement in the Advances to Contractor and Other Payables accounts.  

 

1.19 We recommended that Management require the Accounting Section to 
adjust the erroneous entry in the account to reflect the correct balances of 

Advances to Contractors account and affected accounts in the financial 

statement. 

 

 

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (PPE) 

 

d) Unrecorded donations and purchases  

 

1.20 COA Circular No. 2015-007 dated October 22, 2015 was issued to prescribe the

1.25 These unrecorded transactions resulted in the understatement of the Works of 
Arts and Archaeological account by ₱2,367,615.00. 

 

1.26 Management commented that the PMS already submitted a Request for Booking 
to Accounting Section of the donations made in CYs 2018 and 2019 as well as 

the eight purchased ethnographic collections. 

 

e) Erroneous recording of transactions  in an aggregate amount of  ₱18,183,944.20 

 

1.27 GAM for NGAs, Volume I states the following: 
 

a. Sec. 7, Chapter 19 – “Fair presentation requires the faithful representation 
of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance 

with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, 

and expenses set out in PPSASs.” 

 

b. Sec. 8(g), Chapter 10 – “During the construction period, all expenses 
incurred in relation to the construction of the PPE shall be taken up in the 

books as Construction in Progress (CIP) with the appropriate asset 

classification. As soon as the construction is completed, the “Construction 

in Progress” account shall be reclassified to the proper asset account. 

Likewise, all expenses such as interests, license fees, etc., during the 

construction period shall be capitalized.” 

 

1.28 During our audit, we have noted several errors in recording of transactions in the 
aggregate amount of ₱18,183,944.20, which affected the fair presentation of the 

CIP account in the Financial Statements, as summarized in the succeeding table:

1.29 Audit of the CIP account revealed that the amount transferred to Buildings 
account for the three previously completed infrastructure projects of NMP was 

not equal to the aggregate CIP amount for the said projects, hence resulted in the 

overstatement of the CIP account and understatement of the Buildings account 

by the same amount of ₱251,002.67.  Details are presented hereunder:

respectively, by debiting the CIP account and crediting the Accounts Payable

year, the CIP account was again debited while the Accounts Payable account 

remained unadjusted, thus resulting in the overstatement of the CIP and

1.34 Review of the entries made for the liquidation of Department of Public Works

erroneously recorded in the books of NMP in the Trust Receipts Fund instead of 

Regular Agency Fund.  Although correcting entries were made in CY 2019 to 

reclassify the liquidation to its proper fund cluster, the adjusting entry to close 

the erroneous recording in the Trust Receipts Fund was omitted, thereby

1.37 The continuous non-reclassification of completed projects resulted in the

understatement of Historical Buildings and Buildings accounts by 

₱123,291,895.95 and ₱961,387,169.21, respectively. Moreover, depreciation 

expenses were also not recognized for these completed projects.

1.38 We recommended that Management require the Accounting Section to: 
 

a. properly record donated and purchased items in the books of account; 
 

b. review the CIP – Buildings and Other Structures accounts and prepare 
journal entries to correct the errors and misclassifications noted;  and 

 

c. prepare entries to transfer the CIP account to the appropriate PPE 
accounts on the basis of Certificates of Completion to be attached to the 

JEVs as supporting documents.

balances which were confirmed to be non-existent and have no valid claims, not 

only violated EO No. 87 but also overstated the reported balance of liabilities in 

the financial statement. 

 

1.41 We recommended that Management require the Accounting Section to 
effect reversion of Accounts Payable and Other Payables accounts which 

have no valid claims. 
 

h) Erroneous journal entry on the payment of retention money 
 

1.42 During CY 2018, retention fees were deducted from the 1st to 3rd progress 
billings of Stage Craft International for the NMNH Exhibition and Facilities and 

Associated NM Complex Site Development Project Phase IV Package 1. These 

retention fees were credited to Guaranty/Security Deposits Payable account in 

the following JEVs:

Balance   6,271,259.40 

 

1.43 Also, as illustrated in the above table, the total Guaranty/Security Deposits 
Payable for the project was reduced by ₱418,083.96 to represent an adjustment 

for additional tax withheld by the Agency for the said transaction with Stage 

Craft as provided in JEV-2020-08-002488 dated August 13, 2020. 

 

1.44 On September 2, 2020, JEV No. 2020-09-003072 was drawn to record the 
payment for retention money deducted from the 1st to 3rd billing of the 

abovementioned project disbursed under ADA No. LD20000316.  However, the 



 

70 
 

Accounts Payable account, instead of Guaranty/Security Deposits Payable  

account, was erroneously debited, as shown below:

1.45 The erroneous entry made above resulted in the overstatement of the 
Guaranty/Security Deposits Payable account by ₱6,271,259.40 and 

understatement of the Accounts Payable account by the same amount. To correct 

the entry, the following should be drawn:

1.46 We recommended that Management require the Accounting Section to 
prepare the necessary adjusting journal entries to correct the errors noted 

for fair presentation of the account in the financial statements. 

 

 

EXPENSES 

 

i) Erroneous recording of transactions 
 

1.47 Both IPSAS No. 1 and Section 2(a), Chapter 2, of the GAM for NGAs, Volume 
I define accrual basis as: 

 

“Accrual basis means a basis of accounting under which 

transactions and other events are recognized when they occur (and 

not only when cash or its equivalent is received or paid). Therefore, 

the transactions and events are recorded in the accounting records 

and recognized in the FSs of the periods to which they relate. The 

elements recognized under accrual accounting are assets, liabilities, 

net assets/equity, revenue, and expenses.” 

 

1.48 The penalties and charges of ₱42,261.65 paid to Zamboanga City Electric 
Cooperative and Sulu Electric Cooperative, Inc. were incorporated in the 

monthly billing statements issued by the said electric companies. Thus, these 

expenses were inadvertently recorded as Electricity Expenses account by the 

Accountant which consequently overstated the reported balance of said account. 

 



 

71 
 

1.49 It was also noted that two transactions included in the Electricity Expenses 
account totaling ₱7,171.55 were actually CY 2019 electric billings, details are 

as follows:

1.50 The enumerated transactions being booked and recognized as expenses in CY 
2020 is inconsistent with the principle of accrual basis of accounting as 

prescribed in IPSAS No. 1 and Section 2, Chapter 2, of GAM for NGAs, Volume 

I.  This further resulted in the overstatement of the Expenses account by 

₱7,171.55.    

 

1.51 Thus, the Electricity Expenses account balance of ₱34,842,311.48 is overstated 
by a total of ₱49,433.20, details are as follows:

1.52 We recommended that Management direct the Accountant to: 
 

a. record the necessary adjusting entries to reflect the correct balance of 
the Electricity Expenses account; and 

 

b. adhere with the basic principle of accrual basis of accounting in 
recording transactions in the books of accounts by recording 

expenditures as accounts payable in the year to which the transaction 

pertains to assure fund allocation solely intended for its payment. 

 

 

OTHER ACCOUNTING DEFICIENCIES 

 

2. Unresolved variances and huge discrepancies between NMP accounting records 
and the supporting schedules/documents and unsubstantiated balances in the 

amount of ₱480,566,642.34 were noted, which affected the reliability of the total 



 

72 
 

Assets and Liabilities balance of ₱3,890,601,228.04, contrary to Section 6.e, 

Chapter 19 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I. 

 

2.1 Section 6.e, Chapter 19 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I on Qualitative 
Characteristics of Financial Reporting states that an entity shall present 

information including accounting policies in a manner that meets reliable 

information, which is free from material error and bias, and can be depended on 

by users to represent faithfully that which it purports to represent or could 

reasonably be expected to represent. 

 

2.2 The following deficiencies in recording and reporting financial transactions 
resulting from lack of reconciliation of Accounting records and Property records 

and lack of supporting documents and reconciliation with the records of other 

government agencies also affected the reliability, accuracy, completeness, and 

valuation of the reported account balances of the financial statements (FSs).

2.3 Section 20 of the General Provisions of the Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 General 
Appropriations Act (GAA) or Republic Act (RA) No. 11465 requires that all 

agencies of the government shall purchase common-use supplies from the PS as 

mandated under Letter of Instructions (LOI) No. 755 dated October 18, 1978, 

Executive Order (E.O.) No. 359, s. 1989, Administrative Order (A.O.) No. 17, 

s. 2011 and such guidelines issued thereon. 

 

2.4 Chapter 3 of GAM for NGAs, Volume III describes the Due from NGAs as the 
account used to recognize advances for purchase of goods/services as authorized 

by law, fund transfers to the NGAs for implementation of projects and other 

receivables from NGAs.  Credit this account upon the receipt of goods/services, 

and liquidation of fund transfers/receivables. 

 

2.5 Section 2.c., Chapter 8 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I provides, among others, 
that Inventories are assets in the form of materials or supplies to be consumed or 

distributed in the rendering of services (examples: office supplies, ammunitions, 

maintenance materials).  

 

2.6 On the other hand, Section 10 of the same Manual states that tangible items 
below the capitalization threshold of ₱15,000 shall be accounted as semi-

expendable property.  

 

2.7 Under the Government Fares Agreement (GFA), DBM-PS had entered into a 
Memorandum of Agreement with NMP on July 19, 2018, wherein the latter shall 

procure its airline ticket requirements for travel from the former.  The GFA is an 

initiative of the DBM and the PS-PhilGEPS that will ensure fast, efficiency, 

flexibility including savings in time, energy and money when processing the air 

transportation needs of all government officers and personnel for their official 

domestic and international trips. 

 

2.8 During CY 2020, NMP procured most of its common-use supplies and 
equipment (CSE), as well as airline tickets, from the DBM-PS.  It requires an 

advance payment corresponding to the total amount indicated in the Agency 

Purchase Request (APR) for CSE and GFA Fund Replenishment Form for 

airline bookings.  The advance payment is recorded under the Due from NGAs 

account, and this is credited upon the acceptance of the items delivered and 

receipt of airline booking tickets from the DBM-PS. 

 

2.9 As of December 31, 2020, the account Due from NGAs pertaining to 
transactions from DBM-PS, showed a balance of ₱1,124,958.75.  For the year, 

the total funds transferred, including the beginning balance, amounted to 

₱7,472,865.91 and the deliveries/refund/adjustments amounted to 



 

74 
 

₱6,347,907.16, thus there was an undelivered CSE and unexpended advances for 

airline tickets of ₱1,124,958.75, as shown below:

outstanding balance of ₱360,121.13 as of December 31, 2020 as against the book 

balance of ₱1,124,958.75, or a net overstatement of ₱764,837.62, which affects

75 
 

2.11 Meanwhile, the unreconciled difference of ₱57,154.89 pertains to the ending 
balances reported per books of NMP and DBM-PS as of December 31, 2015, 

which remained unadjusted in the books and may represent unrecorded 

deliveries relating to prior years’ period.  Details of which cannot yet be 

determined due to non-preparation of SLs in the previous years.  This deficiency 

was also mentioned in previous years’ audit memoranda. 

 

2.12 It was also noted that the deliveries of purchased items from DBM-PS were 
directly recorded in the Office Supplies Inventory account, thus various items 

were misclassified in the said account, such as the following:

2.13 Although the above misclassifications have no effect on the total balance of the 
Inventories as of December 31, 2020, the reported balances taken individually 

affected the fair presentation of each Inventories accounts in the financial 

statements. 

 

2.14 We recommended that Management: 

 
a. require the Accounting Section and SMS to meticulously examine the 

details of the prior years’ unreconciled balance of ₱57,154.89 to hasten 

the reconciliation of the records maintained by NMP and DBM-PS;  

 



 

76 
 

b. require the Accounting Section to make necessary adjustments in the 
books to correct the misclassifications noted; and 

 
c. require the SMS to continuously monitor the deliveries and airline 

bookings made by comparing the same against the corresponding fund 

transfers and immediately inform the DBM-PS about the existence of 

undelivered common-use supplies and equipment and 

unreceived/unbooked airline tickets to avoid accumulation thereof. 

 

2.15 Management commented that the SMS already endorsed to the Accounting 
Section the copies of the FY 2015 – 2017 Delivery Receipts from the DBM-PS 

as additional reference for the continuous reconciliation of records. Also, the 

SMS will continuously monitor the deliveries of CSE and receipt of airline 

bookings of the NMP from DBM-PS. 

 

b) Non-conduct of semestral inventory count and incorrect preparation of RPCI 

 

2.16 Section 13 of Chapter 8 on Inventories, of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, 
provides, among others, that physical count/inventory, which is required semi-

annually, is an indispensable procedure for checking the integrity of property 

custodianship.  

 

2.17 Instructions on the Preparation of RPCI (Appendix 66) of the GAM for NGAs, 
Volume II provides, among others, that the RPCI is a form used to report the 

physical count of inventory items by type such as Office Supplies Inventory; 

Accountable Forms Inventory; Medical, Dental and Laboratory Supplies 

Inventory; Food Supplies Inventory, etc., which are owned by the agency/entity. 

It shall be prepared semi-annually by the Inventory Committee and by fund 

cluster.  It also states how the forms shall be accomplished, the need for the 

reconciliation of the Accounting and Property Units, how many copies of the 

report shall be prepared and to whom this shall be distributed and the deadline 

of submission of the semestral reports to COA. 

 

2.18 For CY 2020, the Agency was able to conduct the semestral physical count on 
its Office Supplies Inventory account.   The other types of inventories totaling 

₱10,783,471.68 that are carried in the books of accounts were not included 

during the conducted inventory, contrary to Section 13 of Chapter 8 of the GAM 

for NGAs, Volume I, details are as follows: 

 

Type of Inventory 
 Amount  

(In PhP) 
Inventory Held for Sale   
   Merchandise Inventory              351,576.18

   Animal/ Zoological Supplies Inventory                88,870.00

   Chemical and Filtering Supplies Inventory              565,357.00  
   Construction Materials Inventory              441,489.00  
   Other Supplies and Materials Inventory           9,306,124.50  
   Subtotal        10,431,895.50  
Total         10,783,471.68  

 

2.19 Thus, the physical existence and condition of the Inventories accounts reported 
in the financial statements cannot be ascertained due to the lack of physical 

inventory-taking. 

 

2.20 Moreover, it was observed that the submitted RPCI as of December 31, 2020 did 
not conform with the Appendix 66 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume II, 

particularly on the  data on  Parts Requiring Revision/Additional Information,  

as follows:

indicated in the RPCI 

 

 

2.21 The information provided in the RPCI should be complete since this is important 
to facilitate verification and reconciliation of the inventories. 

 

 



 

78 
 

2.22 We recommended that the Management require the SMS to:  
 

a. conduct semestral physical count for all types of inventories, which are 
owned by the Agency; and 

  

b. abide by the instructions on the preparation of RPCI (Appendix 66) of 
the GAM for NGAs, Volume II and provide all the necessary 

information indicated therein. 

 

2.23 Management commented that the SMS has been constantly performing semi-
annual physical inventories together with the COA representative and the rest of 

the Inventory Committee.  Also, they committed to abide with the instructions 

on the preparation of RPCI. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

2.24 We affirm that the SMS has been regularly conducting semestral physical count 
of its inventories.  However, only the Office Supplies Inventory was subjected 

to the said procedure while the other Inventories carried in the books of account, 

as discussed above, were not.  Actual count of Inventories is important because 

it can reveal what you have on hand and it can provide assurance on the 

reliability of the amounts recorded in the books. 

 

c) Unreconciled difference between the GL and Monthly Schedule/Report of Aging  

 
2.25 Comparison between the balances reported per GL and the Monthly 

Schedule/Report of Aging as at December 31, 2020 revealed a difference of 

₱26,351.00 for Advances for Operating Expenses (OpEx), (₱0.96) for Advances 

to Payroll, (₱575,774.40) for Advances to Special Disbursing Officer (SDO), 

and ₱209,311.07 for Advances to Officers and Employees (O&E), which 

remained unreconciled in the books, thus rendering these account balances 

unreliable.  Details are shown below:

2.27 On the other hand, erroneous recording of liquidation and refunds of four cash 
advances to the Advances to SDO account, instead of the Advances to O&E and 

Advances for OpEx accounts, resulted in the understatement of the Advances to 

SDO account by ₱980,120.86, and the overstatement of the Advances to O&E 

and Advances for OpEx accounts by ₱978,598.86   and ₱1,522.00, respectively.

2.28 We recommended that Management require the Accounting Section to: 
 

a. review and reconcile the balances reported in the Schedule of Aging of 
Cash Advances and General Ledger to determine the correct 

accountabilities of the accountable officers concerned;  

 

b. maintain/update SLs for the Advances accounts including necessary 
information such as date and purpose of grant as well as check number 

or ADA number; and 

 

c. effect the necessary adjustments on recording errors and be consistent 
in the treatment of cash advances following GAM, Volume III. 

 

d) Unreliable balance in PPE accounts due to lack of data and/or supporting details 
affecting the completeness and accuracy of recording various transactions are

Observations 

Land Unidentified Eighteen parcels of land acquired by the agency were unrecorded 

in the books of accounts. These also remained unsupported with 

Original Certificate of Title (OCT)/ Transfer Certificate of Title 

(TCT) as an incontrovertible proof of ownership and right of the 

property.  The legal documents like the RAs/Presidential 

Proclamations and Deeds of Donation were presented by the 

agency as their evidence/claim of ownership but these cannot 

prevail over a Certificate of Title as a proof of registration under 

the Torrens system in the Registry of Deeds.  A land title is 

significant since it is a definitive evidence of the right of the owner 

or the extent of his/her interest, and by which means he/she can 

maintain control and as a rule assert right to exclusive possession 

and enjoyment of the property.  Hence, this will also secure the 

Agency’s right over the constructed buildings and any 

improvements made therein.

neither details nor supporting documents to ascertain its valuation 

and validity.

Unidentified Two donated works of arts were not reported by the PMS and 

consequently, not yet recorded in the books by the Accounting 

Section which indicates defect in the internal control since these 

were not accounted as NMP property. The existence, location and 

status of these items were not validated, thereby, exposing the 

properties to possible loss and damage if improperly stored.

Remarks:  

The 25 paintings were loaned to Malacañang and were covered by a 

Memorandum Receipt (MR) dated June 9, 1994 except for Moro Vinta which 
was transferred without cost to Malacañang as stated in the Inventory Report 

but no document presented to support the latter claim. The last physical 

inventory made by the NMP Inventory Team was on March 5, 2009 but no 
report or documentation was presented to account for the missing items found 

in the location.  

Nevertheless, based on the submitted report on the status of these loaned 
paintings, the Fine Arts Division (FAD) intends to request for the renewal of 

MOA. 

Loaned to: Philippine Army Museum 

 
“Gen. Antonio Luna Statue” by Fermin Gomez, 

Sculpture 

80,000.00 

Remarks:  

The loan was covered by MR dated September 12, 1991 and a contract dated 

October 2, 1991. This was also renewed on March 13, 2000. On March 1, 2012, 

a team of NMP personnel conducted an ocular inspection at the Government 
Arsenal, Department of National Defense- (GA-DND), Limay Bataan for the 

possible renewal of the agreement. However, “Gen. Antonio Luna” sculpture 

in Bataan was bronze-casted and not the GAL Plaster of Paris Sculpture loaned 
from NMP. 

 

FAD mentioned that they will follow up their request for assistance in locating 
the sculpture and will make consultation on the corrective action with regard to 

the loan agreement.

Quilles 

15,000.00 

Remarks:  

The “Lambat” (Biyaya ng Dagat) painting along with the other four works of 

art were covered by MR dated June 30, 1986. When the loan was renewed on 
February 8, 1994, it was noted that “Lambat” was given as a gift by then 

Secretary of Education, Mr. Isidro I. Carino when he attended the Southeast 

Asian Ministers of Education Organization in Thailand as certified by 
Undersecretary of DECS on April 8, 1994. It was further requested by the latter 

that the said painting be dropped officially from the accountability of DECS. 

The request was not given consideration by the DECS and NMP auditors and 
stated that the signatory in the MR shall be liable pursuant to Sections 101 and 

102 of PD No. 1445. 

FAD remarked that it will follow up the request to resolve the matter regarding 
DepEd personnel's accountability. 

 

Total ₱ 101,093.00 

 
The failure by the Management to act and take appropriate 

measures to locate and retrieve the missing and unaccounted art 

collections might result in loss of invaluable objects that 

encompasses years of Philippine history and cultural heritage. 

287,275,255.64 

 

Include unidentified amount totaling ₱287,275,255.64 in the SL 

‘For Reconciliation’. The amount was carried over from CY 2017 

year-end balance and was set up as beginning balance in CY 2018 

upon NMP’s migration to Electronic New Government 

Accounting System (eNGAS).  This was neither identified nor 

reconciled by the Accounting Section. 

CIP 131,988,356.75 Includes an SL named ‘For Reconciliation’ with an amount of 

₱131,988.356.75 as beginning balance of CY 2018 upon NMP’s 

migration to eNGAS.  

The breakdown of the aforementioned SL ‘For Reconciliation’ 

was previously identified during our audit in CY 2019 but was not 

taken into account by the Accounting Office 

Total 419,688,575.39  

 

2.29 We recommended that Management: 
 

a. determine the fair value as at the date of acquisition of the land 
acquisitions through non-exchange transactions based on pertinent 

documents available; 

 

b. instruct the Accounting Section to: 
 

i. record the cost of the land acquired through non-exchange 
transactions and cost of the donated works of arts and specimens 

once the fair value has already been reliably measured and 

established by Management; 

 



 

84 
 

ii. locate the supporting documents to prove the validity of the amount 
recorded under the SL named National Museum of Fine Arts; and 

 

iii. maintain SLs, retrieve pertinent supporting documents and 
reconcile with PMS to identify the breakdown of SL ‘For 

Reconciliation’; 

 

c. make the necessary representations with proper authorities/offices to: 
 

i. facilitate land titling over the lots acquired through non-exchange 
transactions and have an annotation at the back of the title in the 

Register of Deeds to claim ownership on the portion of donated land 

until such time that the TCT is secured; and 
 

ii. determine the correct land area of the properties noted with 
deficiency to ascertain the correctness of the boundaries of the 

properties owned by NMP; 
 

d. require the Regional Administration and Operations Division to: 
 

i. locate/trace relevant documents to support the other land under the 
jurisdiction of the NMP without legal document on transfer; 

 

ii. confirm the status of lot in Tuguegarao, Cagayan and submit the 
necessary documents to support the claim of its reversion to the 

Provincial Government; and 

 

iii. regularly submit supporting documents about any changes in the 
Real Properties of NMP Branches and Satellite Offices to the 

Property Management Section to facilitate the updating of its 

record;  

 

e. disclose in the Notes to Financial Statements the land/land rights 

recorded in the books, which were not supported with Certificate of 

Title and the existence and amounts of restrictions on the title; and 
 

f. create an appraisal committee to determine the fair value as at the date 
of acquisition of donated works of arts and archaeological / ethnological 

specimens reported at no value. 

 

2.30 Management commented that the PMS in collaboration with the Research 
Collection and Conservation Management Division (RCCMD) and Fine Arts 

Division will propose for the creation of an Appraisal Committee for the Works 

of Arts to determine proper valuation and latest appraised value of all insurable 

artworks.

e) Abnormal/negative balance in the Other Payables account  
 

2.31 It was also noted that the Other Payables account includes abnormal/negative 
balances totaling to ₱22,224,561.20, of which ₱12,926,065.84 is unreconciled, 

as shown below:

2.32 The abnormal balances mentioned above is attributable to the non-preparation 
of updated SLs by the Accounting Section which made it difficult for them to 

monitor the receipt for goods/services delivered and payment or settlement of 

the liability and eventually led to the mispostings and misclassification of the 

account.    

 

2.33 We recommended that Management require the Accountant to: 
 

a. make a detailed analysis of the abnormal/negative liabilities;  
 

b. maintain and regularly update SLs; and 
 

c. prepare the necessary adjusting entries to correct the balance of the 
account.  

 

f) Dormant balance of Assets and Liabilities accounts due to inadequate supporting 
documents 

 

2.34 Section 111 of PD No. 1445 states that: 
 

1.   The account of an agency shall be kept in such detail as is necessary to 

meet the needs of the agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish 

the information needed by fiscal or control agencies of the government. 

 

2.  The highest standards of honesty, objectivity and consistency shall be 

observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate or 

misleading information.

2.35 COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 9, 2016 prescribes the guidelines 
and procedures on the write-off of dormant receivable accounts that remained 

inactive or non-moving in the books of accounts for 10 years and where 

settlement/collectability could no longer be ascertained. 

 

2.36 On the other hand, COA Circular No. 97-001 dated February 5, 1997 provides 
for the guidelines and procedures on proper disposition/closure of dormant 

accounts that remained non-moving for more than five (5) years.

2.39 Although the Implementing Agencies confirmed that they do not have 
outstanding liabilities to NMP, no final liquidation or accomplishment reports 

was submitted by the said agencies to support such claims. Thus, the Due from 

NGAs account balance of ₱440,797.65, in relation to the implementation of 

various infrastructure projects remained dormant and unliquidated. 

 

2.40 Further, the Due from LGUs account balance of ₱6,934,887.27 represents 
unliquidated fund transfers due to non-submission of final Liquidation Reports 

(LRs) by Mandaluyong City, Malabang, Lanao del Sur and Cebu City, and the 

non-submission of Certificate of Actual Consumption by the Vigan, Ilocos Sur 

with a verification by the City Auditor as per request letter dated September 6, 

2007 by the Director of NMP.    

 

2.41 Verification of previous Annual Audit Reports (AARs) showed that two LGUs 
replied from confirmation letters that they have no outstanding liability or have 

already liquidated the outstanding balance. However, no final LRs were 

submitted by these LGUs to support such claims. Details of the prior year’s

Municipality of Malabang, Lanao del Sur, Cebu City Cultural and Historical 

Affairs, and TIEZA; however, no reply has been received yet. 

 

2.43 On the other hand, the Due from Officers and Employees account balance of 
₱724,653.25 pertains to three accountable officers who are no longer connected 

with the Agency.  Receivables from Mr. Dumlao and Mr. Zamora pertain to cash 

advances granted which remained unliquidated while the amount due from Ms. 

Guevarra represents unrelieved losses of fixed assets for the cost of four 

ethnological specimens which were lost through theft on December 16, 1983 

while on exhibit at the gallery (per 2005 and 2006 AARs).   

 

2.44 Meanwhile, the non-moving balances of the Merchandise Inventory, Office 
Supplies Inventory and Accountable Forms, Plates and Stickers Inventory 

accounts of ₱351,576.18, ₱1,006,705.24 and ₱1,500.00, respectively, were 

caused by the deficient controls in monitoring the issuances thereof as well as 

failure to conduct regularly the physical count of inventory of supplies and 

materials in prior years.   

 

2.45 Review of records revealed that the Advances to Contractors account under the 
Regular Agency Fund includes an aggregate amount of ₱14,969,635.96, which 

remained non-moving for five to more than 10 years, and consists of the

2.46 As gleaned from the above table, three projects were already completed and were 
transferred to their corresponding PPE accounts, however, unrecouped advances 

totaling ₱4,914,138.94 still remained in the books.  

 

2.47 On the other hand, records revealed that the amount of ₱9,133,565.90 under the 
SL named ‘For Reconciliation’ pertains to FY 2008 balance with no specified 

additional information while the amount of ₱112,664.35 referring to the 

advances granted to Fujitech, Inc. was reflected in FY 2010 Schedule of 

Advances, the purpose of which was also not provided. These receivables 

totaling ₱9,246,230.25 have been inactive for more than ten years and may 

therefore be considered as dormant receivables. The validity and propriety of 

existence of these amounts can no longer be determined due to absence of 

supporting documents or SLs, contrary to Section 111 of PD No. 1445. 

 

2.48 Audit also disclosed that there were withheld retention fees and collected bid/

                   *Part of SL ‘For Reconciliation’ with a balance of ₱1,392,059.94. 

 

2.49 The outstanding balance in Guaranty/Security Deposits Payable account totaling 
₱2,335,327.61 which remain non-moving for five (5) years and above have been 

noted during our previous year’s audit, however, this matter remains unresolved 

which may result to accumulation of dormant balances over time and may make 

it more difficult to trace the transactions and retrieve the pertinent documents 

later on. 
 

2.50 Also, the amount of ₱1,299,921.06 under SL named ‘For Reconciliation’ has 
been dormant for eleven (11) years already. The breakdown of which cannot be 

identified due to non-preparation of SLs and absence of readily available records 

in previous years when the beginning balance was set-up during the agency’s 

adoption and implementation of eNGAS.  
 

2.51 Furthermore, it was established on the review of the prior year entries that the 
collected bid bonds from Tork Philippines, Inc. totaling ₱92,138.88 were 

included in the SL ‘For Reconciliation under the RA Fund. Consequently, a 

journal entry should be made to reclassify the said amount to an identified SL 

for proper documentation and presentation of details in the Guaranty/Security 

Deposits Payable account. 

 

2.52 The above audit observations on dormant account balances had been reported 
repeatedly in our previous years’ AARs to put emphasis on the matter. Despite 

this, Management had not taken utmost effort to comply with our 

recommendations.  



 

91 
 

2.53 The continued existence of these dormant balances reflects Management’s 
inability or inadequate action to address this deficiency, which casts more doubts 

on the existence, validity and collectability of these claims rendering the reported 

balances unreliable. 
 

2.54 We recommended that Management require the Accounting Section to:  

 
a. exhaust all viable means to collect the dormant receivable accounts 

through coordination with the concerned NGAs/LGUs to reconcile their 

records with NMP and sending of demand letters or initiating legal 

actions to the concerned former NMP employees with unliquidated cash 

advances and unrelieved losses at their last known addresses; 

 

b. review and analyze the account’s long outstanding balances to 
determine its validity and propriety; prepare adjustment for erroneous 

entries, if any and for confirmed unrecouped Advances to Contractors, 

initiate its immediate refund or deduct the unrecouped amount from 

any claims due to the contractors;  

 

c. after all the possible measures were undertaken to ascertain the details 
of the Receivables account and proven futile, be guided by the 

procedures in the write-off of dormant accounts set forth under COA 

Circular No. 2016-005;  

 

d. expedite the verification, review and analysis of the unaccounted 
dormant balances of Inventories accounts per books of ₱1,359,781.42, 

as required under COA Circular No. 97-001 and effect necessary 

adjustment/s, if warranted, to arrive at the correct account balances at 

yearend; 
 

e. record the identified suppliers to their proper SLs for fair presentation 
of the account in the financial statements; 

 

f. coordinate/communicate with the contractors to submit their claims for 
the release of retention moneys totaling ₱1,035,406.55 aged five years to 

less than 10 years, and comply with the requirements for the issuance of 

the Certificate of Acceptance within the set timelines.  Otherwise, forfeit 

the retention money for failure to comply with the terms of the contract 

or revert the same to Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit), pursuant to COA 

Circular No. 97-001; and 

 

g. review, analyze and reconcile the Guaranty/Security Deposits Payable 

balance amounting to ₱1,299,921.06 which remained dormant for 11 

years and thereafter, prepare entry to derecognize the dormant forfeited 

retention money, if necessary.

COMPLIANCE AUDIT 

 

Unserviceable properties not yet disposed and still carried in the books 

 

3. Office supplies amounting to at least ₱17,289.66 were found obsolete, expired, and 
non-moving for one to three years and were not yet disposed of, contrary to 

Section 79 of  PD No. 1445. 

 

3.1 Section 79 of PD No. 1445 states that when government property has become 
unserviceable for any cause, or is no longer needed, it shall, upon application of 

the officer accountable therefore, be inspected by the head of the agency or his 

duly authorized representative in the presence of the auditor concerned and, if 

found to be valueless or unsalable, it may be destroyed in their presence. If found 

to be valuable, it may be sold at public auction to the highest bidder under the 

supervision of the proper committee an award or similar body in the presence of 

the auditor concerned or other duly authorized representative of the COA. 

 

3.2 On the other hand, during the year-end physical count of Office Supplies 
Inventory account, we noted that obsolete, expired and unused office supplies 

amounting to at least ₱17,289.66 were still kept by the SMS despite year/s of 

continued non-usage of the procured items. Some of these office supplies were 

not provided with unit value, thus only the amount of those items with complete 

details can be computed.  Details  are presented below:

3.3 The presence of obsolete/expired/non-moving inventories is indicative of lapses 
in the procurement process, improper planning and poor supply management.  

Keeping these items exposes the same to further deterioration and risk of loss 

through theft, thus depriving the agency of the optimum benefit of additional 

revenue that may be derived from the sale or disposal of these items, or the 

savings that may be derived by the government if these were transferred to other 

agencies who need them, and not to mention the use/utilization of the space 

occupied by the unused supplies for other productive purposes.   

 

3.4 We recommended that the Management require the SMS to dispose 
obsolete, expired, and non-moving supplies and materials in accordance 

with prescribed rules and regulations.  Henceforth, all requisitions should 

be evaluated carefully before procurement to ensure that the same are 

needed. 
 

3.5 Management commented that the SMS shall notify Division Heads / Officers-
In-Charge (OICs) with identified non-moving or unused office supplies and 

materials. They shall formally request PMS for proper disposal of obsolete and 

expired supplies and materials as well as items no longer needed by Division 

Heads / OICs with approved disposal requests from the Director-General. 

 

 

Unliquidated Cash Advances 

 

4. Lapses by Management in strictly implementing the provisions of Section 89 of 
PD No. 1445 and COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 and the 

accountable officers’ (AO) non-compliance thereof resulted in the accumulation 

of unliquidated cash advances (CA) amounting to ₱6,269,844.87 as at yearend and   

excessive grant of CAs with refunds ranging from ₱10,122.00 to ₱266,033.30 in 24 



 

94 
 

instances.  Moreover, the accuracy of the reported balance cannot be fully 

ascertained due to:  a) past due CAs ranging from one to 42 years totaling 

₱6,067,973.50; and b) unliquidated CAs of deceased/retired/resigned employees 

totaling ₱42,380.46. 

 

4.1 Section 89 of PD No. 1445 requires that: “No cash advance shall be given unless 
for a legally authorized specific purpose. A cash advance shall be reported on 

and liquidated as soon as the purpose for which it was given has been served. 

No additional cash advance shall be allowed to any official or employee unless 

the previous cash advance given to him is first settled or proper accounting 

thereof is made. Xxx” 

 

4.2 Likewise, the following provisions of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 
10, 1997 provides, among others, that:  

 

 The amount of the cash advance shall be limited to the requirement for two 
months. Within 5 days after the end of each month, the AO shall submit a 

Report of Disbursements. Additional cash advances shall be granted on the 

basis of the activity budget or requirement for two months, whichever is 

lower. 

 

 When a cash advance is no longer needed or has not been used for a period 
of two (2) months, it must be returned to or refunded immediately to the 

collecting officer. 

 

 The AO shall liquidate his cash advance as follows: 
 

o Salaries, Wages, etc. – within five (5) days after each fifteen (15) 
day/end of the month pay period. 

 

o Petty Operating Expenses and Field Operating Expenses – within 
twenty (20) days after the end of the year; subject to replenishment as 

frequently as necessary during the year. 

 

o Official travel –within sixty (60) days after the return to the Philippines 
in the case of foreign travel or within thirty (30) days after return to his 

permanent official station in the case of local travel. 

 

 Failure of the AO to liquidate his cash advance within the prescribed period 
shall constitute a valid cause for the withholding of his salary and the 

instruction of other sanctions.

₱6,269,844.87 as at yearend, details of which are shown in the succeeding table:

4.6 The unliquidated balances were caused by the non-submission of LRs within the 
prescribed period, delayed processing of LRs by the Accounting Section and 

returned LRs to AOs for submission of additional documents.  It also indicates 

either accumulation of unutilized cash in the hands of the AO, thus putting these 

to risk of loss or misapplication, or expenses not reported, which overstates the 

Advances account for the period.

monitoring the liquidation of the cash advances and this effort effectively 

reduced the PYs’ unliquidated balance of ₱22,078,389.10 to ₱6,081,123.50. 

This was due to the significant improvement in the liquidation and refund of 

prior years’ cash advances totaling to ₱16,090,528.21 or 72.88 percent 

settlement during the year.  On the other hand, of the cash advances granted in 

CY 2020 amounting to ₱1,244,965.37, ₱716,130.71 or 57.52 percent was 

liquidated and refunded. Conversely, no liquidation or refund was made for the 

Advances for Payroll account in CY 2020. 

 

b. Excessive grant of CAs with refunds ranging from ₱10,122.00 to ₱266,033.30 in                 

24 instances 

 

4.9 Comparison of the cash advances granted against the refunds revealed that in 24 
instances, the unutilized cash ranges from ₱10,122.00 to ₱266,033.30.  

Considering that refunds of cash advances are deposited with the Bureau of the 

Treasury (BTr) and Authorized Government Depository Banks, Management 

can no longer use the funds for its operational requirements.

is deemed uncertain. The unliquidated cash advances totaling ₱42,380.46 pertain 

to balances of employees who are no longer connected with the NMP due to 

either death, retirement, resignation and has been dormant for five (5) to 42 years 

already.

submit their LRs with complete supporting documents immediately 

after accomplishing the purpose for which they were given or within the 

period prescribed under COA Circular No. 97-002;  

 

b. consider previous data in calculating probable costs of future 
projects/travels in order to come up with realistic budgets to avoid 

significant amount of excess cash advances; 

 

c. observe the guidelines and procedures in COA Circular No. 2016-005 
dated December 19, 2016 on the write-off of dormant accounts especially 

for those long outstanding cash advances of former employees of NMP;  

 

d. issue demand letters to AOs to settle their cash advances, in case of 
failure to comply, implement the withholding of salaries or any money 

due to them, including appropriate legal sanctions pursuant to Article 

218 of the Revised Penal Code for failure to render accounts; and 

 

e. henceforth, strictly adhere to the provisions of Section 89 of PD No. 1445 
and COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997.

Inadequate internal control on the receipt and transfer of Works of Arts and Archeological 

Specimens 

 

5. Inadequate internal control on the Works of Arts and Archeological Specimens’ 
loaned/ transferred  to/from other government agencies and private institutions 

by the Archaeology Division resulted in: a.) unsubstantiated report on loaned 

NMP Collections; and b.) unverified loaned collections in the Inventory Report 

due to lack of details and reference numbers.  Also, the non-submission of the list 

of artworks and specimens loaned to/from government agencies and private 

institutions by five NMP Divisions prevented the Audit Team to fully verify 

whether the internal procedures and policies are being enforced and complied 

with accordingly. 

 

a. Unsubstantiated Reports on loaned NMP Collections 
 

5.1 The Archaeology Division reported that 1,084 items listed in the table below 
were still on loan but no Memorandum of Agreement or other supporting 

documentation was presented. Furthermore, due to absence of documentation on 

hand, some were noted in the report as ‘for verification’.

5.2 The lack of documents on these loans indicates procedural lapses, thus 
monitoring of the status of these loans and the return of the specimens to NMP 

cannot be easily facilitated. In addition to this, the loan status cannot also be 

regularly verified by the PMS since they were not provided with necessary 

copies of related documents.  

 

b. Unverified loaned collections in the Inventory Report due to lack of details and 
reference numbers  

 

5.3 Verification was made as to the inclusion in the Inventory Report of the NMP 
collections on loan to other agencies/institutions, but it was revealed that the 

PMS was unable to match the above specimens to their record or fully determine 

if these items are included in the Inventory Report due to lack of detailed 

description and complete reference numbers, thereby making NMP Collections 

more vulnerable to loss which might also be unnoticed by the Property Custodian 

or Management. 

 

c. Non-submission of the list of artworks and specimens loaned to/from government 

agencies and private institutions by five NMP Divisions 

 

5.4 Despite of our letter-request dated January 27, 2021 for the submission of list of 
the artworks and specimens loaned to/from government agencies and private 

institutions, together with the loan agreements, the following five NMP 

Divisions have not yet submitted the requested report: 
 

1. Botany and National Herbarium Division 
2. Maritime and Underwater Cultural and Heritage Division 
3. Ethnology Division 
4. Zoology Division 
5. Geology and Paleontology Division 

 

5.5 The failure of the various/concerned Divisions of NMP to report the list and 
status of loans on their respective records and to submit the supporting 

documents prevented the Audit Team to fully verify whether the internal 

procedures and policies are being enforced and complied with, particularly that 

all NMP Collections in their custody are fully accounted for and that there was 

adequate check and balance in place as protection  against possible loss of works 

of arts and specimens embodying the cultural and natural heritage of the Filipino 

Nation.  
 

5.6 We recommended that Management: 
 

a. validate the status of the loaned/transferred Collections through sending 
of confirmation letters and conducting inventory count of those loaned 

to other agencies/institutions within/outside the country and transferred 

to NMP branches;   



 

101 
 

 

b. document the results of validation through issuance/renewal of Property 
Acknowledgment Receipt (PAR) and Property Transfer Report (PTR); 

 

c. furnish the Audit Team the abovementioned report on NMP Collections 
loaned to other government agencies and private institutions and loaned 

items from outside entities with attached Memorandum of Agreements 

and other pertinent documents to support the report; 

  
d. improve and enforce NMP policies on the donations and loans of 

artworks and specimens and install the necessary internal control in the 

receipt and transfer of Works of Arts and Archeological Specimens, to 

wit: 

 

i. ensure that received artworks and specimens, whether purchased 
or donated, be initially accounted by the Property Custodian and 

copies thereto be provided to the Accounting Section and 

concerned divisions for proper recording and disposition.  

Similarly, the Property Custodian shall primarily register the 

borrowed items in a separate book before issuing the same to the 

respective accountable officer; and 

 

ii. ensure that the Property Custodian and the other Collection 
Managers are informed of the NMP Collections loaned to other 

government agencies and private institutions by providing them a 

copy of the loan agreements to enable them to update their record 

and to monitor the status of loaned specimens. 

 

5.7 Management commented that Office Policies/Procedures are being prepared by 
the RCCMD in collaboration with the PMS and all Curatorial Divisions 

concerned to ensure a centralized procedure on proper documentation, booking 

and issuance of PAR and PTR by the PMS.      

 

5.8 Also, the RCCMD and NMP Curatorial Divisions will ensure that all NMP 
loaned and/or transferred collections to other agencies/institutions 

within/outside the country and transferred to NMP branches and shall 

consistently provide/furnish the PMS and the Records Management Section a 

copy with complete documentation of the loan agreements for proper monitoring 

of status of loaned collections for recording, updating and reconciliation of 

records, issuance and/or transfer of PAR.

Non-reversion of dormant Payables totaling ₱26,335,635.80 to Accumulated 

Surplus/(Deficit) account  

 

6. The aggregate balance of the Accounts Payable and Other Payables accounts of 
₱80,725,876.60 is of doubtful validity due to the existence of long outstanding 

balances amounting to ₱26,335,635.80 for a period ranging from three to 18 years, 

of which ₱22,852,988.56 pertains to Accounts Payable account and ₱3,482,647.24 

to the Other Payables account, which should have been reverted to Accumulated 

Surplus or Deficit of the General Fund, pursuant to EO No. 87 dated August 13, 

2019. 

 

6.1 EO No. 87 signed on August 13, 2019 provides, among others, that: 
 

“Section 1. Reversion of Documented Accounts Payable. All documented 

accounts payable for FY 2016 and years prior thereto shall be reverted to the 

Accumulated Surplus or Deficit of the General Fund, or the Cumulative Result 

of Operations of National Government. Henceforth, all documented accounts 

payable which remain outstanding for at least two years, for which no actual 

administrative or judicial claim has been filed, shall be subject to automatic 

reversion. 

 

Section 2. Treatment of Undocumented Accounts Payable. All accounts 

payable which are undocumented or not covered by perfected contracts on 

record, regardless of the year in which they were incurred, shall automatically 

be reverted.  The recording of undocumented accounts payable in the books of 

accounts of agencies shall be strictly prohibited.” 

 

6.2 Section 111 of PD No. 1445 states that: 
 

“1. The account of an agency shall be kept in such details as is necessary to 

meet the needs of the agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish 

the information needed by fiscal or control agencies of the government. 

 

2. The highest standards of honesty, objectivity and consistency shall be 

observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate or 

misleading information.” 

 

6.3 As of December 31, 2020, the Accounts Payable and Other Payables accounts 
have an aggregate balance of ₱80,725,876.60, which includes claims totaling to 

₱26,335,635.80, which remained outstanding for more than two years, as shown

extended to the NMP. 

 

6.6 Included in the abovementioned unreverted Accounts Payable balance are stale 
checks totaling ₱78,535.00. The validity of such claims cannot be ascertained 

due to lack of details such as ORS Numbers, to wit:

6.7 Hence, the continued existence of the dormant accounts of ₱26,335,635.80, 
including those balances which were confirmed to be non-existent and have no 

valid claims, not only violated EO No. 87 but also overstated the reported 

balance of liabilities in the financial statement. 

 

6.8 These dormant balances remain to be included in the books despite the 
recommendation of the Audit Team in the previous years’ AARs to reconcile 

these balances with the records of the concerned creditors and to cause the 

immediate reversion of accounts payable which have no valid claims.  

 

6.9 We recommended that Management require the Accountant to:  
 

a. cause the automatic reversion of all  documented accounts payable 
which remain outstanding for at least two years, for which no actual 

administrative or judicial claim has been filed; and 
 

b. determine if there are payables that are undocumented or not covered 

by perfected contracts on record, and immediately cause its reversion. 

 

 

Lapses in disbursements of government funds 

 

7. Disbursements totaling ₱42,985,891.69, including claims with inadequate 
supporting documents of ₱42,738,928.30,  were found contrary to existing 

government laws, rules, and regulations, thus considered irregular and/or of 

doubtful validity that are grounds for the issuance of Notice of 

Suspensions/Disallowance.  

 

7.1 Audit of disbursements made by NMP revealed the following deficiencies: 
 

a) Irregular claims of Hazard Pay -₱20,967.80 
 

7.2 AO No. 26 dated March 23, 2020 authorizes the grant of Hazard Pay, to be called 
as COVID-19 Hazard Pay, to government employees and workers engaged 

through Contract of Service (COS) or Job Order (JO) basis who physically report 

for work during the implementation of an Enhanced Community Quarantine 

(ECQ) in their respective work stations, in an amount not exceeding ₱500/day 

per person. Said benefit shall be granted to the aforementioned government 

employees and workers since they are inevitably exposed to health risks and 

hazards if they physically report for work during the period of an ECQ. 



 

105 
 

7.3 On the other hand, Budget Circular (BC) No. 2020-1 dated March 24, 2020 was 
issued by the DBM to prescribe the guidelines on the grant of the COVID-19 

Hazard Pay pursuant to AO No. 26. 

 

7.4 Item 4.4 of the said Circular states that the total rate of the COVID-19 Hazard 
Pay shall be based on the number of days an employee/worker physically reports 

for work during the ECQ period. 

 

7.5 In order to support the grant for COVID-19 Hazard Pay, the following 
documents are required to be submitted: 

 

 Office Order from agency head/ Authority to report for work/ Certification 
as member of the designated Skeleton Work Force (SWF), in lieu of the 

Copy of Special Order from the agency/department head covering the 

assignment to hazardous/difficult areas mentioned in Item 5.8 of COA 

Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012; 

 

 Approved Daily Time Record (DTR) or Service Report as enumerated also 
in Item 5.8 of COA Circular No. 2012-001; and 

 

 Accomplishment Report as stipulated in Item 5.7 of Civil Service 
Commission Memorandum Circular No. 10 dated May 7, 2020 with 

retroactive effectivity on March 16, 2020. 

 

7.6 Meanwhile, different community quarantine status were imposed throughout the 
country by virtue of the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) for the Management 

of Emerging Infectious Diseases Resolutions, Provincial/City EO, and other

7.8 Claims which are not in consonance with the set guidelines are considered 
irregular and may be a ground for the issuance of a Notice of Disallowance. 

 

b) Excessive grant of honoraria -₱163,822.08 
 

7.9 Section 3.1 of DBM Budget Circular (BC) No. 2007-3 dated November 29, 2007 
provides that:  

 
“The amount necessary for payment of honoraria and overtime pay 

authorized under BC No.  2004-5A dated October 7, 2005   shall be sourced 

from the following: 

 

3.1.1 Collections from successfully   completed    procurement     projects 

limited, however, to activities prior to awarding of contracts to winning   

bidders: 

•    Proceeds from sale of bid documents; 

•    Fees from contractor/supplier    registry; 

•    Fees charged   for copies of minutes of bid openings, Bids and 

Awards Committee (BAC) resolutions and other BAC documents; 

•    Protest fees; and 

•    Proceeds from bid security forfeiture. 

 

3.1.2 Savings realized   from   the current   year specific budget of the 

agency under the General Appropriations Act (GAA). 

 

3.1.3 In the case of GOCCs, savings from the DBM-approved corporate 

operating   budgets. 

 

3.1.4 In the  case of LGUs, savings from  the  local budgets  approved  

by their   respective   Sanggunian   subject   to  the  pertinent   

provisions of R. A. 7160  (Local Government   Code of  1991).” 

 

7.10 Section 73 of the GP of the 2019 GAA states that savings shall refer to portions 
or balances of any released appropriations in this Act which have not been 

obligated as a result of any of the following: 



 

108 
 

 
“a. completion, final discontinuance, or abandonment of a program, activity or 

project  for which the appropriation is authorized; or 

b. implementation of measures resulting in improved systems and efficiencies 

and thus enabled an agency to meet and deliver the required or planned 

targets, programs and services approved in this Act at a lesser cost.”  

(Underscoring ours) 

 

7.11 Further, Section 11.2.4 of the Revised IRR provides that the Head of the 
Procuring Entity (HoPE) may designate alternate BAC members, who shall have 

the same qualifications as that of the members originally designated under 

Section 11.2.2. The alternate members shall attend meetings of the BAC and 

receive the proportionate Honoraria, whenever the original members are absent.  

The alternate members shall have the same term as the original members. 

 

7.12 The Agency paid a total amount of ₱490,500.00 representing payment of 
Honoraria to government personnel involved in government procurement for CY 

2019. Evaluation of DVs disclosed that of the total amount of ₱490,500.00, the 

amount of ₱344,000.00 paid to BAC and Technical Working Group (TWG) 

members was charged from the proceeds of the sale of bid documents under the 

Trust Fund while the amount of ₱146,500.00 was charged from the General 

Fund. Below is the breakdown of the payment of honoraria by source of fund.

Total   490,500.00 

 

7.13 On March 13, 2019, an amount of ₱473,441.29 was remitted to the National 
Treasury (NT) representing the unutilized balance from the proceeds of the sale 

of bid documents for CY 2018 and prior years.  However, an improper recording 

of a bid security as a collection in CY 2017 was noted on April 2, 2019 and hence 

was not taken in the books prior to the remittance to the NT which resulted to an 

over-remittance of ₱51,322.08. During CY 2019, the collections from the sale 

of bid documents totaled ₱378,000.00; thus, an unutilized balance of 

₱326,677.92 at yearend. Details are as follows:

12/31/19    Unutilized Balance 326,677.92 

 



 

109 
 

7.14 Although the collection from bid documents of ₱378,000.00 was sufficient to 
cover the amount of ₱344,000.00 Honoraria being claimed, the over-remittance 

to the NT resulted in the reduction of the available balance of the Trust Fund to 

₱326,677.92; hence the amount of Honoraria disbursed was more than the 

remaining balance of the fund.   Also, we would like to emphasize that charging 

of payments of Honoraria to the General Fund must satisfy the conditions set 

forth in Section 73 of the GP of the 2019 GAA.  Unobligated balances of 

appropriations cannot be immediately regarded as savings.   Hence, Honoraria 

totaling ₱163,822.08 were found not compliant with the abovementioned 

criteria, details of which are as follows: 

 

Particulars 
Amount 

(In PhP) 

Honoraria Pay from January to December 2019 charged from TF    344,000.00  

TF as of January 1, 2020 (available for payment of honoraria) 326,677.92 

 Subtotal 17,322.08 

Honoraria Pay from January to December 2019 charged from GF 146,500.00 

 Total 163,822.08 

 

7.15 As set by Section 3.5 of the BC No. 2007-3, in cases of deficiency in collections 
from procurement activities and non-availability of agency savings, the amount 

of Honoraria and overtime pay shall be adjusted proportionately for all those 

entitled thereto. 

 

7.16 Additionally, evaluation of the payroll and minutes of the meetings attached to 
the DVs showed that Honoraria paid to BAC and TWG members totaling 

₱24,000.00 are not valid since they did not participate in any meetings related to 

successfully completed procurement projects as discussed under Section 11.2.4 

of the 2016 Revised IRR of RA No. 9184. The details of the invalid claims are

7.17 Claims which are not in consonance with the set guidelines are considered 
irregular and may be a ground for the issuance of a Notice of Disallowance. 

 

c) Unnecessary payment of penalties -₱62,173.51 
 

7.18 Section 2 of PD No. 1445 provides that “It is the declared policy of the State 
that all resources of the government shall be managed, expended or utilized in 

accordance with law and regulations, and safeguard against loss or wastage 

through illegal or improper disposition, with a view to ensuring efficiency, 

economy and effectiveness in the operations of government. The responsibility 

to take care that such policy is faithfully adhered to rests directly with the chief 

or head of the government agency concerned.” 

 

7.19 In the audit of disbursements made for the Electricity Expenses account of the 
Agency, we have noted that four operating units incurred penalties and charges 

amounting to ₱62,173.51 in CY 2020 due to late payment of electric bills.

7.20 The said charges were incurred by four Regional Museum and Satellite Offices, 
which are situated outside Metro Manila.  Since NMP implements a centralized 

processing of its disbursements, the distance of these operating units greatly 

affected the delays incurred in the receipt of the billing statements, which 

consequently had a domino effect on the preparation and release of checks and 

ADA payments.   

 

7.21 The penalties and charges of ₱42,261.65 paid to Zamboanga City Electric 
Cooperative and Sulu Electric Cooperative, Inc. were incorporated in the 

monthly billing statements issued by the said electric companies. Thus, these 

expenses were inadvertently recorded as Electricity Expenses account by the 

Accountant.  Meanwhile, the surcharges totaling ₱19,911.86 were reflected in 

the Official Receipts (ORs) issued by Bohol Light Company Inc. and Palawan 

Electric Cooperative.  Since NMP have been consistently delayed in the payment 

of its electric charges, the two electric providers then applied the current 

payments of NMP to the arrears which were neglected.  

 

7.22 The incurrence of these unnecessary expenditures is apparent wastage of 
government funds and is not in accordance with the principle of sound 

management of government resources, as required in the aforementioned 

provision of law. 

 

d) Disbursements with inadequate supporting documents -₱42,738,928.30 
 

7.23 Section 5(f), Chapter 2, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs provides that “Claims 
against government funds shall be supported with complete documentation.” 

 



 

112 
 

7.24 Likewise, COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012, as amended by 
COA Circular No. 2013-001 dated January 10, 2013, prescribed the 

documentary requirements for common government transactions depending on 

the nature of expenses. 

 

7.25 Section 39(1) of PD No. 1445 on the submission of papers relative to 
government obligations states that: 

 
“The Commission shall have the power, for purposes of inspection, to require 

the submission of the original of any order, deed, contract, or other 

document under which any collection of, or payment from, government funds 

may be made, together with any certificate, receipt, or other evidence in 

connection therewith. If an authenticated copy is needed for record purposes, 

the copy shall upon demand be furnished.” (Emphasis ours) 

 

7.26 Section 22 of RA No. 11333 known as the “National Museum of the Philippines 
Act” dated July 23, 2018 provides that procurement of unique, special and/or 

original items by the National Museum for its collections charged to any of its 

sources of funds as may be allowed, and authorized by the Head of the Agency 

and concurred to by the Board, shall be exempted from applicable laws, rules 

and regulations regarding government procurement.  Moreover, it enumerates 

the requirements for the procurement of NMP collection items by means of 

direct negotiation with the owners of such items, or their duly designated

7.28 Disbursements of government funds are subject to the usual accounting and 
auditing rules, thus all payments should comply with COA Circular No. 2012-

001 on the documentary requirements for common government transactions 

and/or other laws, rules and regulations applicable thereof. 

 

7.29 We recommended that Management: 
 

a. substantiate the propriety and validity of the disbursements made 
through compliance or submission of the aforementioned lacking 

supporting documents, explanations on the deficiencies noted and 

sufficient relative information to enable us to make a decision in audit; 

 

b. recompute the Honoraria amounts proportionately for all those entitled 
thereto as stated in Section 3.4 of DBM Budget Circular No. 2007-3 and 

refund the amounts representing overpayment; 

 

c. implement measures to facilitate prompt payment of electric bills and 
other expenses incurred in the Regional Museums and Satellite Offices 

to avoid the incurrence of penalties and surcharges; and 

 

d. determine the officials liable for the incurrence of the surcharges and 
make them personally liable thereof. 

 

7.30 Management commented that the BAC employs a different perspective or view 
in the computation of Honoraria. While attendance to these conferences are 

necessary, meeting held by the committee in deliberation of results, as well as 

the adoption and approval of resolutions of award, is also being taken into 



 

117 
 

consideration. A member may be absent in a particular conference but that does 

not mean he or she did not participate. A member may still participate directly 

when he or she takes active part in the review of the Post Qualification 

Evaluation Report, as well as the preparation and review of the award resolution 

to be signed thereafter. Thus, signature of a member in the resolution of award 

is also made as a supporting document in their claim of honorarium. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

7.31 As clarified by our inquiry from Government Procurement Policy Board 
(GPPB), the BAC and TWG members should be present in all the meetings, at 

which there is quorum, to be qualified to receive the maximum amount of 

honoraria.  Otherwise, they shall only be entitled to honoraria proportionate to 

the meetings they attended. 

 

 

Non-compliance with RA No. 9184 and other issuances on government procurement 

 

8. Delayed contract execution, deficiencies in Performance Security/Surety Bond/ 
postings of procurement opportunities, splitting of contracts,  deployment of two 

groups of people undertaking two projects in one location,  General Conditions of 

Contract (GCC) not in the form prescribed in the Philippine Bidding Documents, 

insufficiency of documents attached to the contracts that were submitted late to 

the Audit Team for review and withholding of retention money  on the final 

payment after the project completion are aspects showing non-compliance by the  

NMP with  RA No. 9184 and its Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations 

(IRR), and Section 3.1.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009, 

hence casting doubts on the integrity and reliability of the procurement process 

and reasonableness of the awarded infrastructure and service contracts 

amounting to ₱51,113,520.20. 

 

8.1 The 2016 Revised IRR of RA No. 9184 provides the list of documentary 
requirements and information needed to check/ensure the regularity/validity of 

the procurement activities on infrastructure projects and the efficient/effective 

implementation of the projects. 

 

8.2 Furthermore, Section 3.1.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 
2009 states that within five working days from the execution of a contract by the 

government or any of its subdivision, a copy of said contract and each of all the 

documents forming part thereof by reference or incorporation shall be furnished 

to the Auditor of the agency concerned.  

 

8.3 GPPB Resolution No. 23-2007 dated September 28, 2007 was issued to provide 
guidelines and to identify the conditions for the allowance of contract extension 

for general support service. It was emphasized therein that as a general policy, 

extensions of contracts for general support services are discouraged. 



 

118 
 

 

8.4 Section IV of the Philippine Bidding Documents for the Procurement of 
Infrastructure Projects, 5th edition states that: 

 
“Notes on the General Conditions of Contract (GCC) 

 

The GCC in Section IV, read in conjunction with the Special Conditions of 

Contract (SCC) in Section V and other documents listed therein, should be a 

complete document expressing all the rights and obligations of the parties. 

 

The GCC herein shall not be altered. Any changes and complementary 

information, which may be needed, shall be introduced only through the SCC 

in Section V.” 

 

8.5 Section 11.2.1 of the 2016 Revised IRR of RA No. 9184 provides that the BAC 
must consist of at least five members and not exceed seven. Of the five members, 

three must be regular members, and two must be provisional members. Should 

the HoPE desire to create a 7-member BAC, he/she may designate two additional 

regular members, or two additional provisional members, or one additional 

regular and provisional members.  

 

8.6 Audit of services and infrastructure contracts in CY 2020 disclosed that NMP 
has not complied with the provisions of RA No. 9184, its Revised IRR, and other 

existing rules and regulations covering government procurement. These are 

summarized in the succeeding table:

a. It took a month from the issuance of Notice 
of Award (NOA) to the execution of the 

contract. The NOA was dated May 20, 2019 

and was received by the contractor on May 

28, 2019 while the contract agreement was 

only entered by both parties on June 25, 

2019. This contradicts the specific 

guidelines in the Revised IRR of RA No. 

9184, which requires the Head of Procuring 

Entity to immediately enter into contract 

with the said contractor.  

799,988.32  

b. The BAC failed to verify the accuracy of 
the computation in the bidder’s submitted 

price quotation before the preparation of 

Abstract of Quotation, which resulted in 

execution of contract with an erroneous 

amount. To correct the error, an amendment 

to the contract was subsequently executed 

on August 19, 2019, changing the amount 

from ₱799,988.32 to ₱723,192.21. 

c. The validity of Performance Security is 
only until May 28, 2020, which contradicts 

Section 62.2.2.2 of the Revised IRR that

provides that Performance Security shall

d. The surety bond with an amount of 
₱79,998.83 substituted for the retention 

money to answer for the uncorrected 

discovered defects and third party liabilities 

for a period of one (1) year lacks the actual 

date of issuance except that it specifies the 

year 2019. Although the surety bond was 

transmitted to NMP on November 6, 2019, 

its exact validity or expiry cannot be 

identified. 

e. The NMP’s report establishing the

Development 

and

Corporation 

a. Two similar projects for restoration of the 
Loon Church is indicative of splitting of 

contracts since the contract implementation 

is divided into phases with no clear 

delineation of work. Moreover, the 

requirement that the project must be usable 

is not determined since the first project 

sourced from the FY 2016 GAA is not yet 

completed when the second project has 

started. 

49,003,888.88 

b. Records show that the FY 2016 and 2019 
related projects with an aggregate amount 

of ₱150,276,305.66 are being implemented 

simultaneously in Loon, Bohol. Without a 

clear and distinct scope of work and close 

coordination, two different groups of 

people deployed by the contractor in the 

project site will affect the contractor’s 

planning, assigning of duties to personnel, 

time of doing works, NMP’s evaluation of 

completed portion of works and other 

conflicts that may arise due to the 

deployment of two groups of people 

undertaking two projects in one location. 

c. The GCC attached in the bidding 
documents which is deemed part of the 

contract differs from the form prescribed in 

the Philippine Bidding Documents. The 

submitted bidding documents also lack the 

SCC.  

 

We acknowledge that the NMP adopted 

these specific conditions or rules in their 

dealings with the contractors to avoid or 

resolve possible conflicts. However,

specifications in contract and the bidding 

documents with the Revised IRR of RA No. 

9184. Thus, it is suggested that these GCC 

that NMP has adopted be included as one of 

the annexes in the contract agreement as 

long as clauses therein conforms to the 

applicable laws, rules and guidelines. 

 

The attached GCC consists of the detailed 

rights and obligations of the contractor and 

NMP from the awarding of contract, project 

execution, completion, up to correction of 

work after final payment. This includes 

provisions on the documentation and 

drawing requirements, site inspection, 

permits, taxes and surveys, equipment and 

materials, temporary structures and 

facilities, protection of work, owner’s 

property, adjacent property and existing 

utilities, evaluation of contractor’s work, 

extension and suspension of work, change 

orders or extra work requirements for 

payment and settlement of disputes. 

d. NMP failed to enter into a contract with the 
winning bidder within ten (10) days from 

the bidder’s receipt of NOA. The NOA was 

received by the 401 Development and 

Construction Corporation on September 13, 

2019 but the contract was executed after 20 

days or on October 3, 2019. 

e. The Certification from the Head of BAC 
Secretariat on the posting of Invitation to 

Bid at conspicuous places does not indicate 

the actual duration when the same was 

posted. 

f. The NOA was posted in PhilGEPS on 
September 23, 2019 or after 10 calendar 

days which exceeded the 3-day requirement 

in the Revised IRR of RA No. 9184.

8.9 On the other hand, post-audit of disbursement for the release of mobilization fee 
for the project “Restoration of Malacanang sa Sugbu, Cebu City and Conversion 

to NM Cebu” disclosed attached Performance Security in the form of Bank 

Guaranty with an amount of ₱13,977,380.02 is only valid until January 3, 2022, 

which is contrary to Section 39.4 of the Revised IRR of RA No. 9184.  

Specifying the date of validity in Performance Security is disadvantageous to the 

government since there are risks of work deficiencies, fortuitous events and other 

factors that can cause delays in the project completion.  Thus, contract time 

extensions may be granted or project period might be lengthened in the absence 

of a valid Performance Security that could guaranty the faithful performance by 

the winning bidder of its obligations under the contract. 
 

8.10 Post-audit also revealed that instead of withholding the 10% retention money 
(warranty), from every progress payment until 50% of the value of works are 

completed as provided in Section 6.1, Annex E of the 2016 Revised IRR of RA 



 

122 
 

No. 9184, records show that only the retention fee on the final payment was

8.11 The non-deduction of retention money (warranty) from the progress payments 
is disadvantageous to the government as it does not provide for ample protection 

to cover the uncorrected discovered defects and liabilities of works undertaken 

by contracting parties. This is important since it is a safeguard provided by the 

contractor assuring that their work is timely and satisfactorily done. 
 



 

123 
 

8.12 It may be  mentioned that for the retention money for the procurement of goods, 
the guidelines set by  GPPB Resolution No. 30-2017 dated May 30, 2017 will 

be followed, which provides that: 

 
“For procurement of goods….xxx. 

 

The obligation for the warranty shall be covered by either retention money in 

an amount equivalent to at least one percent (1%) but not to exceed five 

percent (5%) of every progress payment, or a special bank guarantee 

equivalent to at least one percent (1%) but not to exceed five percent (5%) 

of the total contract price. The said amounts shall only be released after the 

lapse of the warranty period or, in the case of Expendable Supplies, after 

consumption thereof: Provided, however, That the supplies delivered are free 

from patent and latent defects and all the conditions imposed under the 

contract have been fully met.” 

 

8.13 It was noted in our audit that disbursements totaling ₱1,214,818.82 were 
processed and approved in the absence of the necessary supporting documents,

8.14 Moreover, the NMP did not strictly adhere to Section 11.2.1 of the 2016 Revised 
IRR of RA No. 9184 with regards to the composition of the BAC.  In CY 2019, 

three Office Orders were issued to establish the BAC for NMP’s procurement. 

However, the BAC was composed of a total of nine members including four 

provisional members instead of the five to seven BAC members mentioned in 

the above cited regulation. The details of the composition of the BAC for the 

three Office Orders are shown below:

8.15 The non-compliance had defeated the purpose of the law on transparency, 
competitiveness, equity, efficiency, economy and accountability in the 

procurement of the Agency’s various projects. 

 

8.16 We recommended that Management: 
 

a. submit detailed explanation on the deficiencies noted and submit the 
necessary documents required in the review of contracts and in the 

validation of the projects’ implementation to preclude the issuance of 

Notices of Suspension;  

 

b. adopt the bidding forms prescribed in the Philippine Bidding 
Documents;  

 



 

125 
 

c. constantly check that posted Performance Securities of the contractors 
are valid until the issuance by the Agency of the Certificate of Final 

Acceptance as stated in Section 39.4 of the Revised IRR of RA No. 9184 

to guarantee the faithful performance by the winning bidder of its 

obligations under the contract; and 

 

d. withhold the retention money on the gross amount due to the supplier 
/contractor, equivalent to 10% of every progress payment until 50% of 

the value of works are completed, for infrastructure projects, while at 

least 1% but not to exceed 5% of every progress payment for 

procurement of goods, in compliance with Section 6.1 Annex E of the 

2016 Revised IRR of RA No. 9184 and GPPB Resolution No. 30-2017. 

 

8.17 Management commented that the purpose of naming and assigning provisional 
members to the Committee is to serve as alternate members. In the Office Order 

No. 2019-001, and its subsequent amendments, alternate members were not 

assigned with an understanding that provisional and alternate members perform 

the same functions and duties. Alternate membership is sanctioned under Section 

11.2.4 of the 2016 Revised IRR of R.A. No. 9184. To avoid situations where 

quorum cannot be obtained due to absence of the regular members, the NMP 

deemed it necessary to assign and name provisional members to serve as 

alternate members who will attend in place of the absent regular members. 

 

8.18 In a recent Office Order No. 040 series of 2021, or the “Re-organization of the 
National Museum BAC, TWG and Secretariat”, alternate member was used 

instead of provisional member in order resolve the issue on nomenclature and to 

prevent further confusion on the improper designation may brought about in the 

future. 

 

 

Undeposited Performance Bond to BTr 

 

9. The failure of the Agency to deposit the collected Performance Security to the 
BTr, contrary to Section 7 of the GP of the GAAs for FYs 2019 and 2020, poses 

risks of misuse of entrusted funds. 

 

9.1 Section 7 of the GP of the GAA for FYs 2019 and 2020 provides that: 
 

“Sec. 7. Performance Bonds and Deposits. Performance bonds and deposits 

filed or posted by private persons or entities with departments, bureaus, 

offices and instrumentalities of the National Government, including 

Constitutional Offices enjoying fiscal autonomy and SUCs shall be deposited 

with the National Treasury and recorded as trust receipts in accordance with 

E.O. No. 338, as implemented by COA-DBM-DOF J.C. No. 1-97, and such 

other guidelines issued thereon.”  

 



 

126 
 

9.2 Review of the supporting documents on the released Performance Securities to 
the contractors revealed that their equivalent previously collected cash bonds in 

FY 2019 were directly deposited to the Agency’s LCCA, ‘NM- SPCA, instead 

of remitting the same to the BTr, contrary to Section 7 of the GP of GAA FY 

2019.   Consequently, disbursements of the FY 2019 Performance Bonds were 

made through release of checks under the LCCA NM-SPCA.  The same practice 

was also observed currently. Details are presented hereunder:

9.3 The unauthorized retention of funds in the Agency’s account exposes it to the 
risks of misuse or misappropriation of funds and also deprives the government 

of the use thereof to finance other priority programs. 

 

9.4 We recommended that Management require the Accounting Section to 
deposit all cash collections on Performance Security to the BTr, in 

adherence to Section 7 of the GP of FYs 2019 and 2020 GAAs, otherwise, 

disbursements or expenditures by the Agency shall be void and shall subject 

the erring officials and employees to disciplinary actions in accordance with 

Section 43, Chapter 5 and Section 80, Chapter 7, Book VI of Executive 

Order No. 292, and the appropriate criminal sanctions under existing penal 

laws. 

 

 

Transparency and Full Public Disclosure of Government Transactions 

 

10. Transparency in governance was not fully assured by the  NMP when the posting 
and updating of the information on donations, trust receipts, public funds, audit, 

financial  and physical reports, as well as the required ‘Transparency Seal’ in its 

official website have not been completely undertaken as mandated under Sections 

5, 6, 7, 11, 89, 90, 91 and 94 of the GP, GAA for FY 2020 or RA No. 11465; thus, 

depriving the public of pertinent information necessary to enforce accountability 

among its officials.   

 



 

127 
 

Moreover, this also affected the Agency’s eligibility for Performance-Based Bonus 

(PBB) in CY 2020 due to non-compliance with the good governance conditions 

required under Memorandum Circular No. 2020-1 dated June 2, 2020. 

 

10.1 Section 94 of the GP of the  GAA of FY 2020 or RA No. 11465 on the 
Transparency Seal provides that: 

 
“To enhance transparency and enforce accountability, all agencies of the 

government shall maintain a Transparency Seal to be posted on their 

websites. The Transparency Seal shall contain the following information: (i) 

the agency’s mandates and functions, names of its officials with their position 

and designation, and contact information; (ii) approved budgets and 

corresponding targets, immediately upon approval of this Act; (iii) 

modifications made pursuant to the general and special provisions in this Act; 

(iv) annual procurement plan/s and contracts awarded with the winning 

supplier, contractor or consultant; (v) major activities or projects 

categorized in accordance with the 0+10 point socio economic agenda and 

their target beneficiaries;   (vi) status of implementation, evaluation or 

assessment reports of said programs or projects; (vii) Budget and Financial 

Accountability Reports; (viii) People’s Freedom of Information (FOI) 

Manual signed  by head of agency, Agency Information Inventory, 2018 and 

2019 FOI Summary Report, and 2018 and 2019 FOI Registry; and (ix) annual 

reports on the status of income authorized by law to be retained and/or used 

and be deposited outside of the National Treasury, which shall include the 

legal basis for its retention and/or use, the beginning balance, income 

collected and its sources, expenditures, and ending balance for the preceding 

fiscal year. 
 

The heads of the agencies and their web administrators or their equivalent 

shall be responsible for ensuring compliance with this section.” 

(Underscoring supplied) 
 

10.2 Further, Section 4 of Memorandum Circular (MC) No. 2020-1 dated June 2, 
2020 issued by IATF on the Harmonization of National Government 

Performance Monitoring, Information and Reporting Systems on Guidelines on 

the Grant of the PBB for FY 2020 under Executive Order Nos. 80 s. 2012 and 

201 s. 2016 likewise provides the Good Governance Conditions (GCGs) based 

on performance drivers of the Results-Based Performance Management System 

(RBPMS) and the priorities of the Duterte Administration for 1) heightened 

transparency; 2) stronger public accountability; and 3) more inclusive and 

people-centered public service, as one of the conditions to be eligible for the 

grant of PBB. Among these is the maintenance/update of the agency 

Transparency Seal (TS) under Section 94 of the GP of the FY 2020 GAA.   
 

10.3 Ideally, the Transparency Seal summarizes all the needed data in the nine 
identified components as prescribed in the current budget act. It is depicted by a 

pearl shining out of an open shell, which is a symbol of a policy shift towards 

openness in access to government information. It hopes to inspire Filipinos in 



 

128 
 

the civil service to be more open to citizen engagement; on the other hand, it 

invites the citizenry to exercise their right to participate in governance. This 

initiative is envisioned as a step in the right direction towards solidifying the 

position of the country as a shining example for democratic virtue in the region. 
 

10.4 Verification of the Agency’s official website at 
https://www.nationalmuseum.gov.ph  showed the extent of compliance of NMP 

to the following requirements mandated under Section 94 of the GP, GAA for 

FY 2020:

10.6 Management’s failure to fully utilize its official website to disclose to the public 
all the vital information enumerated above is a glaring setback in adopting 

measures to ensure transparency and accountability, which is required from the 

Agency as one of the budgetary reforms being undertaken to encourage good 

governance among the different branches of government.   
 

10.7 Similarly, the need to employ these available digital platforms is more fitting 
nowadays due to the challenges brought in by the Pandemic, where restriction 

of movement is imposed across the country. Making use of the advances 

provided by this website to communicate the important information is now the 

new norm that is unparalleled and paramount under these circumstances. 

 

10.8 Moreover, like what happened in previous years, these deficiencies also affected 
the Agency’s eligibility for PBB in CY 2020 due to non-compliance with the 

good governance conditions required under MC No. 2020-1 dated June 2, 2020 

issued by IATF on the Harmonization of National Government Performance 

Monitoring, Information, and Reporting Systems.  
 

10.9 We recommended that Management: 
 

a. comply strictly with Sections 5, 6, 7, 11, 89, 90, 91, and 94 of the GP of 
the GAA of 2020 or RA No. 11465 and Section 4 of Memorandum 

Circular No. 2020-1 dated June 2, 2020 issued by Inter-Agency Task 

Force on the Harmonization of National Government Performance 

Monitoring, Information and Reporting Systems; and 

 

b. ensure that the Agency’s available information technology resources are 
utilized to make certain that the transparency and accountability of its 

operational and financial affairs are strictly implemented.

Non-/Delayed submission of financial reports 

 

11. The regularity, validity, completeness, and accuracy of recorded transactions 
could not be fully ascertained due to delayed/non-submission of financial reports, 

DVs, ORs, and supporting documents to the Office of the Auditor within the 

reglementary period, contrary to existing laws and COA rules and regulations, 

thereby affecting the timely and complete review of the said reports/statements, 

communication of results to concerned offices, and correction of errors/omissions, 

if there are any. 

 

11.1 Section 7.1.1(a) of COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009 
provides that “the head of the agency, who is primarily responsible for all 

government funds and property pertaining to his agency, shall ensure that: a) 

the required financial and other reports and statements are submitted by the 

concerned agency officials in such form and within the period prescribed by the 

Commission, xxx.” 

 

11.2 Further, Section 7.2.1(a) of the Revised Rules and Regulations on the Settlement 
of Accounts (RRSA), as prescribed under COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated 

September 15, 2009 provides that the Chief Accountant, Bookkeeper or other 

authorized official performing accounting and/or bookkeeping functions of the 

audited agency shall ensure that the reports and supporting documents submitted 

by the accountable officers are immediately recorded in the books of accounts 

and submitted to the Auditor within the first ten (10) days of the ensuing month. 

 

11.3 On the other hand, Section 41(2) of PD No. 1445, on the submission of annual 
report by the COA to the President and the Congress, states that to carry out the 

purposes of this section, the chief accountant or the official in charge of keeping 

the accounts of a government agency shall submit to the Commission year-end 

trial balances and such other supporting or subsidiary statements as may be 

required by the Commission not later than the fourteenth day of February. 

 

11.4 While, Sections 5 and 7, Chapter 21, GAM for NGAs, Volume I require that the 
Chief Accountant/Designated Staff shall within ten days from receipt of the 

monthly Bank Statement (BS), together with the paid checks, original copies of 

Debit Memoranda (DM)/Credit Memoranda (CM) from the Government 

Servicing Bank (GSB), reconcile the BS with the GL, and prepare the BRS in 

four copies.  The Chief Accountant shall submit the BRS within twenty days 

after receipt of the monthly BS to the following: 

 
Original - COA Auditor (with all the supporting documents and            

                      JEVs) 

Copy 2 - Head of Agency/Entity 

Copy 3 - Accounting Division/Unit file 

Copy 4 - Bank, if necessary 

 



 

132 
 

11.5 Contrary to the above regulations, review of reports and documents submitted to 
the Office of the Auditor as of April 30, 2021 showed that the Cashier and 

Accounting Units were not timely in the submission of required financial reports.  

Analysis showed substantial delays, which ranged from three days to four years 

on the submission of collections, disbursements, and LRs, as presented below:

11.8 The late preparation of BRS resulted in the loss of timely and correct informative 
value to the Management and decision-makers.  It deprived the Agency of the 

opportunity to detect errors/omissions in both the book and bank records on a 

timely basis, and make necessary corrections immediately to ensure that the 

reported Cash in Bank balance reconcile with the balance/s shown in the 

Agency’s depository banks as of a given date, had the Management complied 

with Sections 5 and 7, Chapter 21, Volume I of the GAM.   

 

11.9 The delayed/non-submission of financial reports and documents affected the 
timely audit on the accounts and financial transactions, early detection and 

correction of errors or discrepancies, if there are any, including the timely 

communication of audit results to Management, thus casting doubt on the 

completeness and propriety of the transactions.   

 



 

136 
 

11.10  This lapse could cause the automatic suspension in the payment of the salaries 
of the concerned Cashiers, Accountant, and Disbursing Officers until they have 

complied with the requirements of the Commission pursuant to Section 122 of 

PD No. 1445, which reads as follows: 

 

“(2) Failure on the part of the officials concerned to submit the 

documents and reports mentioned herein shall automatically cause the 

suspension of payment of their salaries until they shall have complied 

with the requirements of the Commission.” (Emphasis supplied) 

 

11.11 We recommended that Management instruct the concerned personnel to 
submit the required financial reports, together with their supporting 

documents, within the reglementary period and expedite the submission of 

overdue reports, ORs, DVs, LRs and supporting documents to preclude 

audit suspensions/disallowances and enforcement of suspension of the 

payment of salaries of officials/employees concerned until they shall have 

complied with the requirement. 

 

 

Delayed/Non-submission of Purchases Orders (POs) and Delivery Receipts (DRs) 

  

12. Copies of the POs, together with their supporting documents and the 
corresponding delivery documents, were not submitted to the COA Auditor 

within the prescribed period, contrary to COA Circular Nos. 2009-001 and 95-006 

dated February 12, 2009, and May 18, 1995, respectively, thereby, affecting the 

timely review and inspection of deliveries and correction of any deficiencies.   

           

12.1 Section 3.2.1 of the COA Circular No. 2009-001 states that: 
 

“A copy of any purchase order irrespective of amount, and each and 

every supporting document, shall, within five (5) working days from 

issuance thereof, be submitted to the Auditor concerned.”   
 

12.2 While, Section 6.06 of COA Circular No. 95-006 dated May 18, 1995 states that 
the official responsible for or in charge of accepting deliveries of procured items 

shall, within twenty-four (24) hours from such acceptance, notify the auditor of 

the time and date of the scheduled deliveries. 

 

12.3 Records of the NMP showed that for CY 2020, a total of 64 POs were prepared 
and issued for the procurement of goods with an aggregate amount of 

₱5,362,873.93.  However, verification disclosed that out of these POs, only 37 

POs amounting to ₱650,661.24 were submitted to the Office of the Auditor and 

these were submitted five to 89 days after the prescribed period for their 

submission, as shown in the succeeding table:

12.4 The remaining 27 POs totaling to ₱4,712,212.69 were received by the Auditor 
only when the DVs were submitted to the Office of the Auditor forming part of 

the supporting documents thereof.  

 

12.5 Moreover, Management failed to submit the delivery documents or send notices 
to the Auditor about the time and date of the scheduled deliveries within twenty-

four hours from the time of acceptance of the goods from the suppliers.  When 

the Head of the SMS was informed of the COA Circular requirement, 40 DRs 

totaling ₱1,582,172.80 were immediately submitted to COA.  However, the 

submission was already delayed by 27 to 191 days. The remaining DRs were 

submitted as supporting documents to the DVs for post- audit.    

 

12.6 The non-submission by Management of the POs and DRs within the prescribed 
period hindered the timely review/evaluation of these documents and the 

conduct of spot inspection of the deliveries.  As such, defects cannot be readily 

determined/evaluated and communicated to Management for appropriate 

action/remedy, thus defeating the intentions of the aforecited regulations. 

 

12.7 We recommended that Management require the SMS to: 
 

a. strictly adhere to the prescribed period in the submission of copies of  
the approved POs to the Office of the Auditor for the timely conduct of 

the evaluation and auditorial review;  and 

 

b. notify the Office of the Auditor within 24 hours from receipt of deliveries 
of the procured items. 

 

12.8 Management commented that the SMS will be more compliant to the timely 
submission of the PO/Job Orders together with the supporting documents. 

Moreover, the SMS has already implemented a standard template or procedure 



 

138 
 

of informing the Office of the Auditor on the schedule of deliveries of procured 

items. 

 

 

UTILIZATION OF BUDGET  

 

Fund Utilization and Spending Capacity 

 

13. Out of total allotments of ₱512,099,344.17 for CY 2020, ₱434,369,846.21 was 
obligated and ₱376,137,096.71 was disbursed,  with  budget and disbursement 

utilization rates of only 84.82% and 86.59%, respectively, while its unobligated 

allotment of ₱77,729,497.96  includes  the ₱10,879,380.81 continuing 

appropriations that can no longer be used and  for reversion to the National 

Treasury, thereby depriving all of its stakeholders of the fullest possible 

use/benefits that can be derived from the allocated resources considering further 

the  a) incurrence of unobligated allotments for Museum Programs and Locally 

Funded Projects totaling ₱53,132,168.08; b) late incurrence of obligation 

amounting to ₱16,500,000.00 undertaken only in December 2020; and                                 

c) disbursements for Museum Programs of ₱52,249,212.44 or 87.19% of the 

obligated allotment were only done during the last quarter. 

 

13.1 The government budget is the financial plan of the agency for a given period, 
usually for a FY, which shows what its resources are, and how they will be 

generated and used over the fiscal period. The budget is the government’s key 

instrument for promoting its socio-economic objectives. It also refers to the 

income, expenditures, and sources of borrowings of the National Government 

(NG) that are used to achieve the national objectives, strategies and programs 

during the year. 

 

13.2 Section 70 of the GP of RA No. 11465 or the GAA of FY 2020 states that: 
 

“As a general rule, departments, bureaus and offices of the National 

Government, including Constitutional Offices enjoying fiscal 

autonomy and SUCs shall spend what is programmed in their 

respective appropriations in this Act.”  

 

13.3 Review of the NMP’s appropriation, allotments and obligations for CY 2020 
disclosed that the total appropriation during the year was ₱673,227,092.17, 

including the continuing appropriations of ₱165,529,092.17. Out of the 

authorized appropriations, allotment received totaled to ₱512,099,344.17, 

₱434,369,846.21 or 84.82 percent was obligated, leaving an unobligated balance 

as of December 31, 2020 of ₱77,729,497.96, of which P10,879,380.81 

pertaining to continuing appropriation  shall be reverted to the National 

Treasury, pursuant to Section 2 of EO No. 91 dated  September 9, 2019 re. 

Adopting the Cash Budgeting System Beginning FY 2019, and for Other 

Purposes.  A summary of the Agency’s utilization for CY  2020 is shown below:

balance of ₱66,850,117.15 has an extended availability up to December 31, 

2021. 
 

13.5 On the other hand, NMP posted also an overall disbursement utilization rate of 
86.59% based on its total obligated amount of ₱434,369,846.21, while unpaid

the following: 

 

a. Incurrence of unobligated allotments for Museum Programs and Locally Funded 
Projects totaling ₱53,132,168.08 

 

13.7 Of the total unobligated allotments of ₱77,729,497.96, ₱53,132,168.08 or

Percentage   43.74 39.34 68.36 

 

13.8 One of the cited reasons by Management for the unobligated MOOE is the partial 
and non-implementation of the GAD activities in CY 2020. 

 

13.9 Another reason was the declaration of community quarantines through COVID-
19 IATF for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases Resolutions 

which imposed both local and foreign travel restrictions, logistics hurdle, and 

prohibition on non-essential activities and gatherings. These restrictions caused 

the delay in the scheduled procurement activities of NMP, more so, its operations 

were halted since it was temporarily closed for public viewing. 

 

b. Late incurrence of obligation amounting to ₱16,500,000.00, which was only 
undertaken in December 2020 

  

13.10 An allotment amounting to ₱16,500,000.00 was available for spending on the 1st 
Quarter of FY 2020 for acquisition of various original Works of Arts, Gold 

(Electrum) Piloncitos, and various set of Patadyong, Pinilian, Panubok, Barong 



 

141 
 

Tagalog, Filipiniana and Pure Piña, hand embroidered piña-seda cloth and 

embroidery materials.  However, obligations thereto were only incurred on 

December 18, 2020. The said amount represents 3.80 percent of the total 

obligated allotment of ₱434,369,846.21 as of December 31, 2020.   The project’s 

commencement in the latter part of the year resulted in a delay in budget 

utilization and subsequently affected the timely and full attainment of the 

project’s objectives.  

 

c. Disbursements for Museum Programs of 87.19 percent or ₱52,249,212.44  of 
obligated allotment were only done during the last quarter 

 

13.11 Disbursements for the Management and Development of the National 
Collections and Related Knowledge Resources amounted to ₱15,000,000.00 or 

90.91 percent of the obligated allotment while 86.52 percent or ₱44,927,205.58 

disbursements for the Restoration, Preservation, Protection and Development of 

Cultural Property.   However, it was noted that substantial portion of this 

disbursements representing 87.19 percent thereof, equivalent to ₱52,249,212.44, 

was only spent during the fourth quarter of CY 2020, details are as follows:

13.12 The above scenario is not indicative of sound cash management. Moreover, 
similar to the effect of the delay/late incurrence of obligation, the payments made 

only on the last quarter of the year also implies a delay in the implementation of 

programs which had a domino effect on the attainment of the PPA’s expected 

outputs to be accomplished during the year. 

 

13.13 We recommended that Management continue to better optimize the 
utilization of its allotments and cash resources by being proactive in 

addressing the issues it encountered. Likewise, consider other 

options/strategies by having a catch-up plan so that the Agency's mandate 



 

142 
 

towards the delivery of its programs/projects’ objectives are realized and 

the benefits derived from the funds are fully maximized. 

 

 

OTHER AUDIT AREAS 

 

Compliance with the requirements of the Property Insurance Law  

 

14. Although the NMP has significantly increased the sum of its insured assets to 
₱2,667,435,856.54 in FY 2020, various properties including Buildings, Works of 

Arts and Archaeological Specimens aggregating to ₱745,611,993.69 remain not 

insured with the General Insurance Fund of the Government Service Insurance 

System (GSIS), contrary to   RA No. 656, otherwise known as the Property 

Insurance Law; thus, exposing the Agency to unnecessary losses due to non-

indemnification of the same amount in the event of damage to or loss of property 

caused by  fire, earthquake, storm, flood, theft and other force majeure. 

 

14.1 RA No. 656, otherwise known as the Property Insurance Law, as amended by 
PD No. 245, requires all government agencies (except municipal governments 

below first-class category) to insure against any insurable risk their properties, 

assets, and interests with the General Insurance Fund (GIF), as administered by 

the GSIS. 

 

14.2 Records show that the NMP paid a total premium amount of ₱13,655,127.35 to 
GSIS for the insurance coverage of most of its PPE, with a total insured amount 

of ₱2,667,435,856.54 as shown in the table below:

14.3 As presented in the above table, the PPE aggregating ₱560,599,056.59 had 
insurance coverage of less than a year during FY 2020 which runs from July 1 

to December 31, 2020 only.    The said insurance coverage represents the 

additional policies applied for by the PMS, in compliance with AOM No. 2020-

011-01(2019) emailed to NMP on April 13, 2020, which pertains to the 

uninsured PPEs in their Inventory Report for FY 2019.  This compliance 

represents the substantial increase of ₱559 million in the insured assets of NMP 

during FY 2020.  In this regard, we acknowledge the actions of NMP to secure 

their assets with the GIF of GSIS and its substantial compliance with the 

provisions of RA No. 656.   

 



 

144 
 

14.4 On the other hand, the four Museum Artifacts included in the above table were 
loaned by NMP from Intramuros Administration (IA) and were insured by the 

latter with GSIS in the amount of ₱5,080,000.00 until August 30, 2020.  Upon 

non-renewal of the Loan Agreement, the said artifacts were transported and 

returned to IA as shown in the submitted copy of acknowledgment receipt dated 

August 26, 2020. 

 

14.5 Despite the substantial compliance of NMP, we have noted that the remaining 
properties totaling to ₱745,611,993.69 were not covered with insurance under 

the GSIS GIF, as required under RA No. 656; thus exposing these government 

assets to inadequate protection and non-indemnification against any damage to 

or loss of its properties or assets and interests due to fire, earthquake, storm or 

other fortuitous events/casualty.  The breakdown of uninsured properties is as 

follows: 

 

PPE 
Amount 

(In PhP) 

Buildings  

   Buildings (Existing amount from 2008 downwards)         504,638,901.92         

   Buildings (Region) 230,938,682.29 

Works of Arts and Archeological Specimens  

   Works of Arts 4,250,000.00 

   Archaeological Specimens 5,757,463.66 

   Ethnological Collections 15,845.82 

   Geological Collections 11,100.00 

 Total         745,611,993.69 

 

14.6 It was also noted that only the buildings located in Metro Manila were provided 
with insurance coverage while those Buildings in the Regional Museums and 

Satellite Offices, included in the Inventory Report of PMS, were not amply 

protected. Furthermore, the abovementioned Buildings (Existing amount from 

2008 downwards) in the amount of ₱504,638,901.92 lacks the details/ 

breakdown in the Inventory Report but it was accounted to the NM Fine Arts 

(NMFA) Building which has a significantly lesser value as shown in its Tax 

Declaration market value of ₱58,818,560.00 in 2005.  Also, NMP has previously 

reported that it has been occupying three buildings in Manila and 13 buildings 

in different Regions from 1979 to 2007, however, these buildings were not 

included in the Inventory Report but only those buildings acquired from CY 

2008 onwards. Hence, the uninsured amount of buildings may pertain to the 

other unidentified buildings of NMP that shall be properly reconciled, 

accounted, and must be covered by property insurance. 

 

14.7 We recommended that Management:  
 

a. require the Accounting Section and PMS to continue reconciling their 
records to be able to correctly establish the value of insurable assets; 

and 

 



 

145 
 

b. henceforth, continue to include in the Agency’s annual appropriation 
the amount necessary to cover the insurance premium of its properties 

for each fiscal year. 

 

14.8 Management commented that the PMS and Accounting Section have agreed to 
reconcile and make the necessary adjustments for the noted discrepancies 

regarding insurable assets. The PMS already requested from the Budget Section 

for additional funding to cover other insurable assets including newly purchased 

Equipment and Specimens/Collections. The PMS also committed that they shall 

continue to review, reconcile and include in the agency’s annual appropriation 

the amount necessary to cover the insurance premium of all NMP properties for 

each fiscal year.   

 

 

Gender and Development (GAD) Program 

  

15. The attainment of the benefits envisioned for its GAD program was not fully 
accomplished since only 11 out of the 18 planned activities were fully implemented 

with ₱8,669,980.95 or 35.94% of the ₱24,121,755.00 budgeted amount was utilized 

during the year, contrary to Section 31 of the GP of RA No. 11465 and PCW-

NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01. 

 

15.1 Section 31 of the GP of RA No. 11465, otherwise known as the GAA for FY 
2020, provides, among others, that all agencies of the government shall 

formulate a GAD Plan designed to address gender issues within their concerned 

sectors or mandate and implement the applicable provisions under RA No. 9710 

or the Magna Carta of Women (MCW), Convention on the Elimination of all 

Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the Beijing Platform for Action, the 

Philippine Plan for Gender Responsive Development (1995 – 2025) and the 

Philippine Development Plan (2017-2022).  The GAD Plan shall be integrated 

in the regular activities of the agencies, which shall be at least five percent (5%) 

of their budgets.  

 

15.2 PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01 provides the guidelines in the 
preparation of the Annual GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) and GAD 

Accomplishment Report (AR) to implement the MCW. 

 

15.3 Pursuant to Philippine Commission on Women (PCW) Memorandum Circular 
No. 2011-01 dated October 21, 2011, agencies with existing GAD Focal Point 

System (GFPS) or similar mechanisms shall reconstitute and strengthen said 

mechanisms. Further, GFPS shall lead in mainstreaming gender perspective, 

assist in monitoring new policies, ensure the review and updating of sex-

disaggregated data, lead in monitoring the effective implementation of GAD 

related policies and the annual GAD Plans, Programs and Budget and in 

preparation of the annual agency GAD Accomplishment Report.  Likewise, 

agencies shall conduct periodic monitoring and evaluation of their GFPS and 



 

146 
 

shall undertake measures to address possible issues hindering the performance 

of their functions in accordance with the MCW and other GAD related laws, 

policies and plans. 

 

15.4 For CY 2020, the NMP allotted the amount of ₱24,121,755.00 for its GAD-
related activities, which is equivalent to only 4.89% or 0.11% below the five 

percent (5%) mandatory appropriation for GAD based on FY 2020 total 

appropriation of ₱493,078,000.00. The same was noted in the previous year’s 

audit wherein the 5% threshold was not met since the GPB was based on the 

estimated agency budget, which is less than the authorized agency budget. No 

adjustment in the GPB was made thereafter when the FY 2020 GAA was finally 

approved on January 6, 2020. 

 

15.5 The PCW-approved GPB for FY 2020 was structured based on the identified 
gender issues in the Agency along with the statutory requirements addressing 

women’s needs. In response to the gender issues and to promote gender equality, 

client and organization-focused activities were developed by the GFPS 

consistent with the Agency’s mandate and compliant with the set criteria of the 

MCW and other relevant laws.  The GAD issues, together with the activities 

undertaken and the budget versus the actual GAD cost or expenditures embodied 

in the Agency’s GAD AR, are shown below:

15.8 The imposition of quarantine measures and closing of various institutions, 
including the Museums, in an attempt to contain the spread of the COVID-19, 

had an impact on the implementation of the planned activities for GAD, as 

shown in the GAD AR. In order not to derail the realization of the set objectives 

despite the emergence of the COVID-19 Pandemic, some activities were done 

online such as conducting virtual meetings and webinars. Furthermore, the five 

GAD planned projects/activities did not materialize since these were hampered 

by the problems encountered in logistics, travel restrictions and prohibition on 

non-essential activities and gatherings. 

 

15.9 The underutilization in the allocated fund also indicates deficiencies in 
budgeting as observed in comparing the budgeted amount and the actual 

expenditure on the 11 fully implemented projects wherein almost 50% of the 

budget allocation was not utilized.  

 

15.10 We commend the NMP for adopting alternative measures to continue the 
implementation of some activities, which can be undertaken online and for 

having additional relevant programs during the year in response to COVID-19 

Pandemic. However, had the GFPS ensured that at least 5% of the total agency 

budget was allocated and attribution of its regular programs/activities/projects 

(PAPs) were properly carried out to address the gender-related issues in the 

formulation of its Annual GPB, the GAD Budget as well as the GAD AR, the 



 

153 
 

objectives of women empowerment, gender equity and equality would have been 

assured.  

 
15.11 We recommended that Management: 

 

a. ensure that at least five percent of the Agency’s authorized 
appropriation shall be set aside for GAD activities and the proper 

attribution of its regular PAPs is undertaken for the year. Whenever the 

estimated agency budget is used for the initial submission of the GPB, 

see to it that adjustments thereafter are made once the GAA is approved 

to conform to at least five percent requirement set by the General 

Provisions of the GAA; and 

  

b. instruct the GAD Focal Point System to formulate the annual GPB with 
realistic or reasonable amounts, and closely monitor the effective 

implementation of GAD related policies and activities to maximize its 

utilization in addressing the identified women and gender issues of the 

Agency.  

 

 

Yolanda Funds  

 

16. Out of the total funds of ₱13,099,849.98 received by the NMP from the US 
Embassy for the Restoration of the Early 18th La Immaculada Concepcion Church 

in Guiuan, Eastern Samar, ₱11,181,613.42 or 85.36% was utilized, leaving a total 

of ₱1,918,236.56 or 14.64% unutilized balance which was refunded on June 22, 

2020.  However, cash advances granted from CYs 2016 to 2018 to seven NMP 

employees totaling ₱264,349.95 remained unliquidated for more than two years 

already. 
 

16.1 The NMP is one of the national government agencies mandated to restore and 
conserve heritage structure and cultural properties including the La Immaculada 

Concepcion Church in Guiuan, Eastern Samar that was greatly devastated by 

Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan) in CY 2013. 

 

16.2 A Federal Assistance Award from the US Embassy of USD300,000.00 which 
shall be given in four tranches from September 15, 2014 to June 30, 2020 was 

donated to NMP for the “Restoration of the Early 18th La Immaculada 

Concepcion Church in Guiuan, Eastern Samar.”  

 

16.3 The total funds received by NMP amounted to ₱13,099,849.98, of which

16.6 LRs for the abovementioned cash advances were not yet submitted, thus already 

delayed in the liquidation for more than two years already.  Misplacement or loss 



 

155 
 

of liquidation documents may occur if liquidation is not immediately done right 

after the project implementation or upon return from official travel.   

 

16.7 We recommended that Management demand from the  AOs to expedite the 
submission of the  LRs of their cash advances,  which have been overdue for 

more than two year already,  for appropriate accounting of the 

disbursements funded by the US Embassy. If not, withhold their salaries 

pursuant to COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997. 

 

 

Senior Citizens and Persons with Disability 

 

17. The planned projects intended for its elderly and person with a disability were not 
fully accomplished as at yearend due to non-/delayed procurement of harness and 

body belts; thus, the objective of addressing their concerns was not fully met. 

Moreover, no documents were submitted by the Agency to indicate that it has 

included the structural features or facilities in its infrastructure projects that will 

enhance mobility, safety, and welfare of the PWDs pursuant to Sec. 32, GP of RA 

No. 11465. 

 

17.1 Section 32 of the GP of RA No. 11465 or the GAA of FY 2020 provides that: 
 

“All agencies of the government shall formulate plans, programs and 

projects intended to address the concerns of senior citizens and 

persons with disability, insofar as it relates to their mandated 

functions, and integrate the same in their regular activities. 

 

Moreover, all government infrastructures and facilities shall provide 

architectural or structural features, designs or facilities that will 

reasonably enhance the mobility, safety and welfare of persons with 

disability pursuant to Batas Pambansa Blg. 344 and R.A. No. 7277, as 

amended.” 

 

17.2 The National Museum Committee on Senior Citizen and Differently-abled 
Persons was formed per Office Order No. 152, s. 2018 and was tasked to 

convene, formulate plans, programs and projects including drafting of policies 

for the senior citizens and differently-abled persons and to integrate the same in 

the regular activities of the Office. 

 

17.3 For CY 2020, the following were enumerated in the Accomplishment Report 
submitted by the National Museum Committee:

17.4 Contrary to the above table, verification disclosed that the procurement of body 
belts, harness, etc. was not 100% accomplished since no supplier responded for 

the procurement of drop support safety harness while the delivery of the gait 

transfer safety belt was only made in CY 2021. 

 

17.5 On October 12, 2020, the SMS requested for quotation of prices from three  
suppliers for three pieces each of drop support safety harness and gait transfer 

safety belt.   The quotations for the price were received and were dated October 

19 and 27, however, the Abstract of Quotation was only prepared on December 

23, 2020 or almost two months after the last quotation was received.  The 

Abstract of Quotation declared Science Gear Enterprises as the most responsive 

bid for the gait transfer safety belt as it offered items in accordance with the 

sample picture attached, while no supplier was recognized for the drop support 

safety harness. 

 

17.6 The PO dated December 23, 2020 was then prepared and was obligated on 
December 28, 2020, however, it was only approved by the Accountant on 

January 13, 2021.  The purchase only proceeded on February 1, 2021 as 

embodied by the receipt of the supplier of the PO.  The gait transfer safety belts 

were then delivered to NMP on February 9, 2021.  This scenario reveals a 

considerable gap from the PO preparation to supplier’s acknowledgment of PO 

terms; hence, conveys a delayed procurement. 

 

17.7 In view of the non-purchase of drop support safety harness and delayed 
procurement of the gait transfer safety belts which was only delivered in the 

succeeding year, the planned project for the senior citizens and PWD cannot be 

considered fully implemented; thus showing no concrete result was 

accomplished as reported by Management at yearend of CY 2020.   

 



 

157 
 

17.8 On the other hand, no documents were submitted to indicate that the Agency has 
included structural features or facilities in its infrastructure projects; therefore, 

prevented the Audit Team to evaluate the extent of management compliance 

with requirements prescribed under existing regulations for these vulnerable 

sectors. 

 

17.9 We recommended that the Management: 
 

a. formulate annual plans of programs/projects for Senior Citizens and 
PWD and integrate the same to the regular activities of the Agency.  

Likewise,  rigorously follow the timeline set in implementing  these plans 

in order to attain the objective of providing programs for the welfare of 

the elderly and disabled individuals; and 

 

b. include the structural features and facilities in the Agency’s yearly 
infrastructure projects to enhance the mobility, safety and welfare of 

PWDs.
