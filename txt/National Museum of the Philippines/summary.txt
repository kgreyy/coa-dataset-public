EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

 

A. Introduction  
 

The National Museum (NM) was established on October 29, 1901 as the “Insular 

Museum of Ethnology, National History and Commerce” under the Department of Public 

Instruction by virtue of Act No. 284 passed by the Philippine Commission. It has changed 

names since then, transferred and merged with other offices, abolished, recreated and 

organized until finally being established as an independent institution under Republic Act 

(RA) No. 8492, otherwise known as the “National Museum Act of 1998,” which was 

enacted/approved by Congress on February 12, 1998. 

 

On April 26, 2019, RA No. 11333 entitled the “National Museum of the 

Philippines Act,” was signed by President Rodrigo Roa Duterte and took effect on July 

31, 2019. As provided in the RA, the NM is renamed as the “National Museum of the 

Philippines (NMP)” or alternatively in Filipino, “Pambansang Museo ng Pilipinas.”  The 

shortened name “National Museum” or “Pambansang Museo” shall be understood as 

exclusively referring to the same. 

 

The whole Executive House Building, also known as the Old Congress Building, 

the Department of Finance (DOF) Building and Department of Tourism (DOT) Building 

in Agrifina Circle shall be the permanent and exclusive site of the Museum and shall be 

known as the National Museum Complex.  

 

The DOT building is the subject of a massive retrofitting project covered by five 

separate contracts/agreements which commenced in December 2013 and still ongoing as 

of this writing at a cost of ₱1.5 billion.  Henceforth, it will be named the “National 

Museum of Natural History (NMNH).” Housed in the Old Congress Building, the NMP 

is mandated to preserve the former Session Halls in the said building as a tribute to the 

legacy of the great men and women of the Philippine Legislature for their invaluable 

contributions to the Filipino people, and as historical sites where democracy and freedom 

reigned and events of national significance transpired. 

 

 Also, the NMP shall be the primary government entity responsible for the 

preservation of the Gomburza Monument by Solomon Saprid, opposite of the former 

Legislative Building, and the Sentinel of Freedom, or Lapu-Lapu Monument, by Juan 

Sajid Imao, in the present Agrifina Circle of Rizal Park. 

 

Under Section 2 of the said Act, it was declared that the State shall pursue and 

support the cultural development of the Filipino people, through the preservation, 

enrichment and dynamic evolution of Filipino national culture, based on the principle of 

unity in diversity in a climate of free artistic and intellectual expression.  

 

The NMP is a Trust of the Government and is attached to the Department of 

Education (DepEd) for budgetary purposes. It is considered as higher in level than a 

Bureau or Bureau-level agency, primarily for administrative purposes as to staffing 



ii 

 

pattern and compensation scales. It shall enjoy privileges and special rules characteristics 

of both a Government-Owned and/or -Controlled Corporation (GOCC) and a State 

University or College (SUC) wherever possible. 
 

The existence of NMP is anchored on the basic philosophy that a Filipino nation 

is kept unified by a deep sense of pride in their common identity, cultural heritage and 

natural patrimony, and imbibed with the spirit of nationalism and strong commitment to 

the protection and dissemination of legacy. Its mission is to acquire documents, preserve, 

exhibit, and foster scholarly study and appreciation of works of the art specimens and 

cultural and historical artifacts. 

 

To implement the foregoing state policy, and to ensure its independence and 

autonomy, the NMP is governed by a Board of Trustees (BOT), which is composed of 

seven government officials, as ex-officio members, and eight representatives from the 

private sector, to include at least one distinguished Filipino artist, architect or cultural 

worker, one distinguished anthropologist or historian, and one distinguished Filipino 

scientist in the field of natural history. The BOT is composed of the following Trustees:

E. Independent Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements 
 

The Auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the 

financial statements of the NMP as at December 31, 2020 in view of the deficiencies 

noted in the accounts as stated in the Independent Auditor’s Report and discussed in 

detail in Part II of the Report. 
 

 

F. Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations 
 

Presented hereunder are the significant observations and recommendations in the 

audit of the NMP for CY 2020, details of which are discussed in Part II of the Report: 

 

1. The financial statements (FSs) of the NMP are misstated in the aggregate amount of 
₱1,111,063,504.27 on account of errors, omissions and improper accounting 

treatment of transactions that are considered as departures from the International 

Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS), hence affecting the fair presentation 

of its financial position as at December 31, 2020, and its financial performance and 

cash flows for the year then ended. (Observation No. 1)  

 

For the Cash and Cash Equivalents account: 

 

We recommended that Management direct the Accounting Section to: 

 

a. effect the necessary adjustments for the unrecorded reconciling items in 
the amount of ₱63,899.38 before closing the books of accounts to reflect 

the true balance of Cash in Bank-Local Currency, Current Account and 

make an adjusting entry to correct the negative subsidiary ledger (SL) 

of the Special Project Cultural Activities - Museum Endowment Fund 

Fund 06; and 
 

b. prepare the Bank Reconciliation Statement for Landbank of the 
Philippines Account No. 0012-1172-80 to fully account the discrepancy 

of  ₱20,306.66. 
 

For the Receivables account: 

 

We recommended that Management require the Accounting Section to: 

 

a. prepare the necessary adjusting entries for the misstatements noted to 
properly reflect the correct outstanding balance of the account Due 

from National Government Agencies (NGAs) and affected accounts; 

and 

 

b. coordinate closely with the Supply Management Section (SMS) to 
address the recurrence of deficiencies in the recording of transactions 



viii 

 

with the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) - Procurement 

Service (PS). 

 

For the Prepayment account: 

 

We recommended that Management require the Accounting Section to adjust 

the erroneous entry in the account to reflect the correct balances of Advances 

to Contractors account and affected accounts in the FS. 
 

For the Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) accounts: 

 

We recommended that Management require the Accounting Section to: 

 

a. properly record donated and purchased items in the books of account; 
 

b. review the Construction in Progress (CIP) – Buildings and Other 
Structures accounts and prepare journal entries to correct the errors 

and misclassifications noted;  and 

 

c. prepare entries to transfer the CIP account to the appropriate PPE 
accounts on the basis of Certificates of Completion to be attached to the 

Journal Entry Vouchers as supporting documents. 

 

For the Payables account: 

 

We recommended that Management require the Accounting Section to: 

 

a. effect reversion of Accounts Payable and Other Payables accounts 
which have no valid claims; and 

 

b. prepare the necessary adjusting journal entries to correct the errors 
noted for fair presentation of the account in the FSs. 
 

For the Expenses account: 

 

We recommended that Management direct the Accountant to: 

 

a. record the necessary adjusting entries to reflect the correct balance of 
the Electricity Expenses account; and 

 

b. adhere with the basic principle of accrual basis of accounting in 
recording transactions in the books of accounts by recording 

expenditures as accounts payable in the year to which the transaction 

pertains to assure fund allocation solely intended for its payment. 

 

2. Unresolved variances and huge discrepancies between NMP accounting records 
and the supporting schedules/documents and unsubstantiated balances in the 



ix 

 

amount of ₱480,566,642.34 were noted, which affected the reliability of the total 

Assets and Liabilities balance of ₱3,890,601,228.04, contrary to Section 6.e, 

Chapter 19 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for NGAs, Volume I. 

(Observation No. 2) 

 

For the Unreliable balance of Due from NGA – DBM-PS account:  

 

We recommended that Management: 

 

a. require the Accounting Section and SMS  to meticulously examine the 
details of the prior years’ unreconciled balance of ₱57,154.89 to hasten 

the reconciliation of the records maintained by NMP and DBM-PS;  

 

b. require the Accounting Section to make necessary adjustments in the 
books to correct the misclassifications noted; and 

 
c. require the SMS to continuously monitor the deliveries and airline 

bookings made by comparing the same against the corresponding fund 

transfers and immediately inform the DBM-PS about the existence of 

undelivered common-use supplies and equipment and 

unreceived/unbooked airline tickets to avoid accumulation thereof. 

 

For the Unreliable balance of Inventories accounts:  

 

We recommended that the Management require the SMS:  

 

a. conduct semestral physical count for all types of inventories, which are 
owned by the Agency; and 

  

b. abide by the instructions on the preparation of Report on the Physical 
Count of Inventories (Appendix 66) of the GAM for NGAs, Volume II 

and provide all the necessary information indicated therein.  
 

For the Unreliable balance of Advances account:  
 

We recommended that Management require the Accounting Section to: 

 
a. review and reconcile the balances reported in the Schedule of Aging of 

Cash Advances and General Ledger to determine the correct 

accountabilities of the accountable officers concerned;  

 

b. maintain/update SLs for the Advances accounts including necessary 
information such as date and purpose of grant as well as check number 

or Advice to Debit Account number; and 

 



x 

 

c. effect the necessary adjustments on recording errors and be consistent 
in the treatment of cash advances following GAM, Volume III. 

 

For the Unreliable balance of PPE accounts:  
 

We recommended that Management: 
 

a. determine the fair value as at the date of acquisition of the land 
acquisitions through non-exchange transactions based on pertinent 

documents available; 

 

b. instruct the Accounting Section to: 
 

i. record the cost of the land acquired through non-exchange 
transactions and cost of the donated works of arts and specimens 

once the fair value has already been reliably measured and 

established by Management; 

 

ii. locate the supporting documents to prove the validity of the 
amount recorded under the SL named National Museum of Fine 

Arts; and 

 

iii. maintain SLs, retrieve pertinent supporting documents and 
reconcile with Property Management Section (PMS) to identify the 

breakdown of SL ‘For Reconciliation’; 

 

c. make the necessary representations with proper authorities/offices to: 
 

i. facilitate land titling over the lots acquired through non-exchange 
transactions and have an annotation at the back of the title in the 

Register of Deeds to claim ownership on the portion of donated 

land until such time that the Transfer Certificate of Title is 

secured; and 
 

ii. determine the correct land area of the properties noted with 
deficiency to ascertain the correctness of the boundaries of the 

properties owned by NMP; 
 

d. require the Regional Administration and Operations Division to: 
 

i. locate/trace relevant documents to support the other land under 
the jurisdiction of the NMP without legal document on transfer; 

 

ii. confirm the status of lot in Tuguegarao, Cagayan and submit the 
necessary documents to support the claim of its reversion to the 

Provincial Government; and 

 



xi 

 

iii. regularly submit supporting documents about any changes in the 
Real Properties of NMP Branches and Satellite Offices to the PMS 

to facilitate the updating of its record;  

 

e. disclose in the Notes to FSs the land/land rights recorded in the books, 

which were not supported with Certificate of Title and the existence and 

amounts of restrictions on the title; and 
 

f. create an appraisal committee to determine the fair value as at the date 
of acquisition of donated works of arts and archaeological / ethnological 

specimens reported at no value. 
 

For the Unreliable balance of Other Payables account:  
 

We recommended that Management require the Accountant to make a 

detailed analysis of the abnormal/negative liabilities; maintain and regularly 

update SLs; and prepare the necessary adjusting entries to correct the balance 

of the account.  

 

For the Dormant balance of Assets and Liabilities accounts: 

 

We recommended that Management require the Accounting Section to:  

 
a. exhaust all viable means to collect the dormant receivable accounts 

through coordination with the concerned NGAs/ Local Government 

Units to reconcile their records with NMP and sending of demand letters 
or initiating legal actions to the concerned former NMP employees with 

unliquidated cash advances and unrelieved losses at their last known 

addresses; 

 

b. review and analyze the account’s long outstanding balances to determine 
its validity and propriety; prepare adjustment for erroneous entries, if 

any and for confirmed unrecouped Advances to Contractors, initiate its 

immediate refund or deduct the unrecouped amount from any claims 

due to the contractors;  

 

c. after all the possible measures were undertaken to ascertain the details 
of the Receivables account and proven futile, be guided by the 

procedures in the write-off of dormant accounts set forth under COA 

Circular No. 2016-005;  

 

d. expedite the verification, review and analysis of the unaccounted 
dormant balances of Inventories accounts per books of ₱1,359,781.42, as 

required under COA Circular No. 97-001 and effect necessary 

adjustment/s, if warranted, to arrive at the correct account balances at 

yearend; 

 



xii 

 

e. record the identified suppliers to their proper SLs for fair presentation 
of the account in the FSs; 
 

f. coordinate/communicate with the contractors to submit their claims for 
the release of retention moneys totaling ₱1,035,406.55 aged five years to 

less than 10 years, and comply with the requirements for the issuance of 

the Certificate of Acceptance within the set timelines.  Otherwise, forfeit 

the retention money for failure to comply with the terms of the contract 

or revert the same to Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit), pursuant to COA 

Circular No. 97-001; and 

 

g. review, analyze and reconcile the Guaranty/Security Deposits Payable 

balance amounting to ₱1,299,921.06 which remained dormant for 11 

years and thereafter, prepare entry to derecognize the dormant forfeited 

retention money, if necessary. 
 

3. Lapses by Management in strictly implementing the provisions of Section 89 of 
Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 and COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 

10, 1997 and the accountable officers’ (AO) non-compliance thereof resulted in the 

accumulation of unliquidated cash advances (CAs) amounting to ₱6,269,844.87 as 

at yearend and   excessive grant of CAs with refunds ranging from ₱10,122.00 to 

₱266,033.30 in 24 instances.  Moreover, the accuracy of the reported balance 

cannot be fully ascertained due to:  a) past due CAs ranging from one to 42 years 

totaling ₱6,067,973.50; and b) unliquidated CAs of deceased/retired/resigned 

employees totaling ₱42,380.46. (Observation No. 4) 

 

We recommended that Management: 

 

a. require all concerned employees to settle their cash advances and to 
submit their liquidation reports with complete supporting documents 

immediately after accomplishing the purpose for which they were given 

or within the period prescribed under COA Circular No. 97-002;  

 

b. consider previous data in calculating probable costs of future 
projects/travels in order to come up with realistic budgets to avoid 

significant amount of excess cash advances; 

 

c. observe the guidelines and procedures in COA Circular No. 2016-005 
dated December 19, 2016 on the write-off of dormant accounts 

especially for those long outstanding cash advances of former employees 

of NMP;  

 

d. issue demand letters to AOs to settle their cash advances, in case of 
failure to comply, implement the withholding of salaries or any money 

due to them, including appropriate legal sanctions pursuant to Article 

218 of the Revised Penal Code for failure to render accounts; and 

 



xiii 

 

e. henceforth, strictly adhere to the provisions of Section 89 of PD No. 
1445 and COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997. 

 

4. Inadequate internal control on the Works of Arts and Archeological Specimens’ 
loaned/ transferred  to/from other government agencies and private institutions by 

the Archaeology Division resulted in: a.) unsubstantiated report on loaned NMP 

Collections; and b.) unverified loaned collections in the Inventory Report due to 

lack of details and reference numbers.  Also, the non-submission of the list of 

artworks and specimens loaned to/from government agencies and private 

institutions by five NMP Divisions prevented the Audit Team to fully verify 

whether the internal procedures and policies are being enforced and complied with 

accordingly. (Observation No. 5) 

 

We recommended that Management: 

 

a. validate the status of the loaned/transferred Collections through 
sending of confirmation letters and conducting inventory count of those 

loaned to other agencies/institutions within/outside the country and 

transferred to NMP branches;   

 

b. document the results of validation through issuance/renewal of 
Property Acknowledgment Receipt and Property Transfer Report; 

 

c. furnish the Audit Team the abovementioned report on NMP Collections 
loaned to other government agencies and private institutions and 

loaned items from outside entities with attached Memorandum of 

Agreements and other pertinent documents to support the report; 

  
d. improve and enforce NMP policies on the donations and loans of 

artworks and specimens and install the necessary internal control in the 

receipt and transfer of Works of Arts and Archeological Specimens, to 

wit: 

 

i. ensure that received artworks and specimens, whether purchased 
or donated, be initially accounted by the Property Custodian and 

copies thereto be provided to the Accounting Section and 

concerned divisions for proper recording and disposition.  

Similarly, the Property Custodian shall primarily register the 

borrowed items in a separate book before issuing the same to the 

respective accountable officer; and 

 

ii. ensure that the Property Custodian and the other Collection 
Managers are informed of the NMP Collections loaned to other 

government agencies and private institutions by providing them a 

copy of the loan agreements to enable them to update their record 

and to monitor the status of loaned specimens.

5. The aggregate balance of the Accounts Payable and Other Payables accounts of 
₱80,725,876.60 is of doubtful validity due to the existence of long outstanding 

balances amounting to ₱26,335,635.80 for a period ranging from three to 18 years, 

of which ₱22,852,988.56 pertains to Accounts Payable account and ₱3,482,647.24 

to the Other Payables account, which should have been reverted to Accumulated 

Surplus or Deficit of the General Fund, pursuant to Executive Order No. 87 dated 

August 13, 2019. (Observation No. 6) 

 

We recommended that Management require the Accountant to:  

 

a. cause the automatic reversion of all  documented accounts payable 
which remain outstanding for at least two years, for which no actual 

administrative or judicial claim has been filed; and 
 

b. determine if there are payables that are undocumented or not covered 

by perfected contracts on record, and immediately cause its reversion. 

 

6. Disbursements totaling ₱42,985,891.69, including claims with inadequate 
supporting documents of ₱42,738,928.30,  were found contrary to existing 

government laws, rules, and regulations, thus considered irregular and/or of 

doubtful validity that are grounds for the issuance of Notice of 

Suspensions/Disallowance. (Observation No. 7) 

 

We recommended that Management: 

 

a. substantiate the propriety and validity of the disbursements made 
through compliance or submission of the lacking supporting 

documents, explanations on the deficiencies noted and sufficient relative 

information to enable us to make a decision in audit; 

 

b. recompute the Honoraria amounts proportionately for all those entitled 
thereto as stated in Section 3.4 of DBM Budget Circular No. 2007-3 and 

refund the amounts representing overpayment; 

 

c. implement measures to facilitate prompt payment of electric bills and 
other expenses incurred in the Regional Museums and Satellite Offices 

to avoid the incurrence of penalties and surcharges; and 

 

d. determine the officials liable for the incurrence of the surcharges and 
make them personally liable thereof. 

 

7. Delayed contract execution, deficiencies in Performance Security/Surety Bond/ 
postings of procurement opportunities, splitting of contracts,  deployment of two 

groups of people undertaking two projects in one location,  General Conditions of 

Contract not in the form prescribed in the Philippine Bidding Documents, 

insufficiency of documents attached to the contracts that were submitted late to the 



xv 

 

Audit Team for review and withholding of retention money  on the final payment 

after the project completion are aspects showing non-compliance by the  NMP with  

RA No. 9184 and its Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR), and 

Section 3.1.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009, hence 

casting doubts on the integrity and reliability of the procurement process and 

reasonableness of the awarded infrastructure and service contracts amounting to 

₱51,113,520.20. (Observation No. 8) 

 

We recommended that Management: 

 

a. submit detailed explanation on the deficiencies noted and submit the 
necessary documents required in the review of contracts and in the 

validation of the projects’ implementation to preclude the issuance of 

Notices of Suspension;  

 

b. adopt the bidding forms prescribed in the Philippine Bidding 
Documents;  

 

c. constantly check that posted Performance Securities of the contractors 
are valid until the issuance by the Agency of the Certificate of Final 

Acceptance as stated in Section 39.4 of the Revised IRR of RA No. 9184 

to guarantee the faithful performance by the winning bidder of its 

obligations under the contract; and 

 

d. withhold the retention money on the gross amount due to the supplier 
/contractor, equivalent to 10% of every progress payment until 50% of 

the value of works are completed, for infrastructure projects, while at 

least 1% but not to exceed 5% of every progress payment for 

procurement of goods, in compliance with Section 6.1 Annex E of the 

2016 Revised IRR of RA No. 9184 and Government Procurement Policy 

Board Resolution No. 30-2017. 

 

8. Out of total allotments of ₱512,099,344.17 for CY 2020, ₱434,369,846.21 was 
obligated and ₱376,137,096.71 was disbursed,  with  budget and disbursement 

utilization rates of only 84.82% and 86.59%, respectively, while its unobligated 

allotment of ₱77,729,497.96  includes  the ₱10,879,380.81 continuing 

appropriations that can no longer be used and  for reversion to the National 

Treasury, thereby depriving all of its stakeholders of the fullest possible 

use/benefits that can be derived from the allocated resources considering further the  

a) incurrence of unobligated allotments for Museum Programs and Locally Funded 

Projects totaling ₱53,132,168.08; b) late incurrence of obligation amounting to 

₱16,500,000.00 undertaken only in December 2020; and c) disbursements for 

Museum Programs of ₱52,249,212.44 or 87.19%  of the obligated allotment were 

only done during the last quarter. (Observation No. 13) 

 



xvi 

 

We recommended that Management continue to better optimize the utilization 

of its allotments and cash resources by being proactive in addressing the issues 

it encountered. Likewise, consider other options/strategies by having a catch-

up plan so that the Agency's mandate towards the delivery of its 

programs/projects’ objectives are realized and the benefits derived from the 

funds are fully maximized. 

 

The foregoing audit observations and recommendations were communicated
