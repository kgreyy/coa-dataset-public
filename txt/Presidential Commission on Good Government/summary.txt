		C.	Scope of Audit

	

The audit covered the review on a test basis, the accounts and operations of PCGG for Calendar Year 2020.  Our audit was also made to assess the propriety of financial transactions and compliance with laws, rules and regulations.



D.	Independent Auditor’s Report 

		

An unmodified opinion was rendered on the fairness of presentation of the financial statements (FS) of PCGG as at December 31, 2020.



E.	Summary of Observations and Recommendations 



1)	The balance of Cash in Bank – Foreign Currency, Savings Account (CIB-FCSA) amounting to ₱82,155,849.27 as at December 31, 2020 cannot be relied upon due to non-preparation and submission of monthly Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS) for the entire year contrary to existing rules and regulations, caused by non-provision of Financial Reports (FRs) by the Philippine National Bank (PNB) to PCGG in view of the expiration of the Escrow Agreement between the former and the latter. 



We recommended and Management agreed to: a) renew the Escrow Agreement with the PNB; and b) direct the Chief Accountant to request in writing submission of FRs by the PNB as basis for recording of transactions and prepare the corresponding BRS to prove the accuracy of the FCSA balance.



2)	The balance of Due from NGAs account of ₱1,252,831,052.63 as of December 31, 2020 is unreliable due to discrepancy of ₱879,175.21 between the balance per books of the PCGG and per records of the Sandiganbayan caused by recognition of accrued interest income.  Moreover, the agency transferred funds way beyond the required minimum balance of the eWallet maintained with the PS-DBM for the procurement of common-use supplies through virtual store contrary to GPBB Resolution No. 20-2018.



We recommended and Management agreed to: a) continue the recognition of accrued interest income pursuant to Sec. 52 Chapter 19 of the GAM Volume I; and b) comply with the provisions of GPBB Resolution No. 20-2018 in maintaining the PS eWallet.  Also, demand from PS to return of all unexpended balances of the eWallet as of year-end.



3)	The Office Supplies Inventory (OSI) account balance of ₱488,955.07 as of December 31, 2020 includes: (a) non-moving/idle items totaling ₱110,244.09 of which ₱42,700.65 of OSI has already expired; and (b) expired moving items amounting to ₱37,456.19 caused by weakness on stock/inventory monitoring by Management.  



We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Property personnel to:  a) use First In, First Out (FIFO) method in issuing supplies and materials where the items with the earliest expiration date should be issued first to avoid further obsolescence of items that are still usable as to date; and b) prepare Waste Material Report (WMR) for expired non-moving and moving inventory items and submit the same to the Accounting Division for proper adjustments.  Henceforth, Property personnel strictly monitor balances of inventories and evaluate carefully the requisitions before procurement to ensure that items are bought in appropriate quantities at an opportune time to avoid existence of non-moving and expired items.



4)	The balance of PPE accounts with carrying amount of ₱141,535,863.46 at year-end is unreliable due to unreconciled difference between accounting records and property records amounting to ₱718,926,225.55 which include misclassification of semi-expendable items as PPE amounting to ₱19,140.00. Moreover, various deficiencies indicating weakness over asset management were noted.



We recommended and Management agreed to: a) immediately reconcile the accounting and property records in compliance with Section 42, Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs and make the necessary adjustments in the respective records, as needed; b) ensure that PPE records are reconciled regularly and that only PPE purchased and delivered as of year-end costing at least ₱15,000.00 are included in the RPCPPE to facilitate reconciliation with accounting records; c) instruct the Chief Accountant to make necessary adjusting entry to reclassify misclassified assets to its appropriate account; d) reconcile the assigned cost/value in the RPCPPE and PPELC following the cost model, pursuant to Section 22, Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs; e) vouch source documents to determine the cost/value of items reported in the RPCPPE without assigned cost/value. If not available, conduct appraisal of subject properties for proper measurement and valuation; f) submit necessary documents to Accounting Division (AD) to support items found during physical count but remained unrecorded in the books; g) demand the production of or locate items recorded in the books which were not reported in the RPCPPE. In case of inexistent items, identify the person/s responsible/liable therefor and demand payment equivalent to the money value of the missing/lost property;  h) trace the reference property numbers from available source documents, otherwise, reassign property numbers to items without proper identification numbers and those with duplicate or multiple property numbers using a systematic property identification system that can provide a unique code for each class/type of PPE, as prescribed in the GAM for NGAs; i) implement COA Circular No. 2020-006 dated January 31, 2020 for the one-time cleansing of PPE balances, if appropriate; j) institute actions for the immediate disposal of the listed unserviceable properties pursuant to Section 79 of PD 1445; k) investigate issues raised and for items without PAR, direct the concerned personnel of Property Division to issue PARs duly acknowledged by end-users; l) for PPEs with inconsistency on end-user, instruct the concerned personnel of Property Division to cancel previous PAR and issue new PAR to the actual end-users; and update the PAR every time there is change of end-user;  m) instruct the concerned accounting and property personnel to conform and accomplish the required forms and reports as prescribed in Volume II of the GAM for NGAs to strengthen the monitoring and accounting control system of the agency, pursuant to Section 42, Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs; and n) direct the concerned property personnel in the conduct of future annual inventory taking to undertake the same ahead of time in order to cope up with the deadline.



5)	Nine short firearms confiscated from former President Ferdinand E. Marcos and officially turned over to the Philippine Government through the PCGG in April 1993 remained unrecorded in the books of PCGG for almost 28 years, thereby understating the Confiscated Property/Assets and Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) accounts as of December 31, 2020 by its total current fair market value. 



We recommended and Management agreed to conduct an appraisal of the nine confiscated firearms found in the custody of the PCGG to determine its current fair market value and record the same in the books under the account Confiscated Property/Assets in the amount equivalent to its total fair market value.



6)	Uncollected rentals totaling ₱2,846,722.18 from three sequestered condominium units at GdM and from seven tenants at the People’s Center Library and Sto. Nińo Shrine in Tacloban City were not recognized in the books as Operating Lease Receivable as of December 31, 2020; thus, misstating the affected accounts in the financial statements.



	We recommended and Management agreed to: a) instruct the Chief Accountant to record in the books the amount of ₱2,282,523.00 representing uncollected rentals from unit nos. K-102; AA-212; and AA-318; b) direct the personnel-in-charge at GdM to collect the same as they become due, pursuant to RA No. 11469 also known as “Bayanihan to Heal as One Act” and RA No. 11494 cited as “Bayanihan to Recover as One Act”; and c) set up receivable from tenants for unpaid rentals and continue to send collection letters for remaining balances.



7)	Delayed submission of Accomplishment Reports (ARs) and Post-trial Reports (PTRs) by some private lawyers ranging from three to 90 days were not in conformity with the provisions of the Contract of Service (COS) entered into by and between the PCGG and private lawyers; thus, resulted in the overpayment of ₱45,600.00. Further, the payments for appearance fees lacked the requisite supporting documents contrary to Section 5.6 of COA Circular No. 2012-001.



We recommended and Management agreed to: a) strictly implement the provisions in the COS as regards submission of ARs and PTRs and demand the refund of overpayment of professional fees amounting to ₱45,600.00 from the concerned lawyers; and b) submit the lacking certifications as required under Section 5.6 of COA Circular No. 2012-001.  Henceforth, instruct the Chief Accountant to strictly monitor and examine supporting documents before processing of any claims.



8)	Out of the 12 Disbursement Vouchers (DVs) representing payment of Hazard Pay totaling ₱306,500.00 to its personnel who physically reported for work during Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) and Modified Enhanced Community Quarantine (MECQ), six DVs amounting to ₱95,000.00 were not supported with documentary requirements prescribed in Item 5.6 of COA Memorandum No. 2020-019 dated November 9, 2020 while six DVs totaling ₱211,500.00 and its supporting documents were not submitted for post audit, contrary to Sections 4 (5-6), 100 and 122 of PD 1445.  Moreover, the lists of personnel/workers who reported for work were not attached, inconsistent with Item 4.3 of the DBM Circular No. 2020-1 dated March 24, 2020; hence, casting doubt on the legitimacy of the hazard pay recipients.



	We recommended and Management agreed to: a) submit the lacking DVs with its documentary requirements in compliance with Item 5.6 of COA Memorandum No. 2020-019 dated November 9, 2020 and Sections 4 (5-6), 100 and 122 of PD 1445; and b) instruct the Human Resource Development Division (HRDD) to submit schedules/lists of employees per department who are required to physically report for work during ECQ/MECQ in compliance with Item 4.3 of the DBM BC No. 2020-01.

	

9)	Delayed remittance of taxes withheld and Philhealth and GSIS contributions of employees ranging from one to 69 days, contrary to existing laws and regulations pertinent thereto, may result in unnecessary penalties and charges. 



We recommended and Management agreed to remit immediately withheld taxes and contributions to BIR, Philhealth and GSIS to ensure full compliance to existing laws and regulations and to avoid risk of penal sanctions.



10)	Management failed to prepare and submit Property Inventory Form (PIF) to COA to support the assessment of general insurance coverage of all insurable assets and properties of the government with the General Insurance Fund (GIF) of the GSIS in violation of COA Circular No. 2018-002.



	We recommended and Management agreed to prepare and submit PIF to COA as prescribed under COA Circular No. 2018-002.

	

11)	The GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) and Accomplishment Report (AR) for the year 2020 submitted by the Agency were not endorsed by the Philippine Commission on Women (PCW) contrary to PCW-National Economic and Development Authority-Department of Budget and Management (PCW-NEDA-DBM) Joint Circular (JC) No. 2012-01.  Moreover, the agency failed to comply with the mandatory requirement of allocating at least five percent of its total appropriations for GAD programs, projects and activities, contrary to Section 31 of the 2020 GAA.

	

	We recommended and Management agreed to submit its GPB and AR pursuant to the prescribed guidelines of PCW-NEDA JC No. 2012-01 and allocate the required amount of at least five percent of its total budget for GAD projects and activities in compliance with Section 31 of 2020 GAA.

	

12)	Identified programs and activities intended for senior citizens and persons with disability were not implemented contrary to Section 32 of the GAA of FY 2020.



	We recommended and Management agreed to introduce/adopt innovations on programs and activities to suit the present condition and implement the same for SC and PWD’s benefit in compliance with Section 32 of 2020 GAA.



		The foregoing findings and recommendations were discussed with the concerned officials of the agency during the virtual exit conference on March 15, 2021. Management’s views and reactions were considered in this report, where appropriate.
