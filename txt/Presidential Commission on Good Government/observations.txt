PART II – OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS





A)	FINANCIAL AUDIT



Unreliable Cash in Bank – Foreign Currency, Savings Accounts



1)	The balance of Cash in Bank – Foreign Currency, Savings Account (CIB-FCSA) amounting to ₱82,155,849.27 as at December 31, 2020 cannot be relied upon due to non-preparation and submission of monthly Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS) for the entire year contrary to existing rules and regulations, caused by non-provision of Financial Reports (FRs) by the Philippine National Bank (PNB) to PCGG in view of the expiration of the Escrow Agreement between the former and the latter. 



1)	Section 74 of PD 1445 states that: At the close of each month, depositories shall report to the agency head, in such form as he may direct, the condition of the agency account standing on their books. The head of the agency shall see to it that a reconciliation is made between the balance shown in the reports and the balance found in the books of the agency.



2)	The objective of the BRS is embodied in Section 3, Chapter 21, GAM for NGAs Volume I, which provides that it shall be prepared in order to:  a) check correctness of both the bank and agency/entity records; b) serves as a deterrent to fraud; and c) enable the agency/entity or bank to take up charges or credits recognized by the bank or agency/entity but not yet known to the agency/entity or bank.



3)	Moreover, Section 5 of the same manual states that the Chief Accountant/designated staff shall within 10 days from receipt of the monthly Bank Statement (BS) together with the paid checks, original copies of Debit Memoranda (DM)/Credit Memoranda (CM) from the GSB, reconcile the BS with the GL and prepare the BRS in four copies.



4)	The Chief Accountant shall submit the BRS with all supporting documents and JEVs within 20 days after receipt of the monthly BS to the Auditor concerned as required under Section 7, Chapter 21 of the GAM, Volume I.



5)	The preparation of the BRS is an indispensable tool in determining whether CIB balances recorded in the books of accounts reconcile with the bank accounts maintained by the agency with the authorized depository banks.



6)	The CIB-FCSA pertained to the Philippine National Bank (PNB) Retained Fund created thru Resolution No. 2004-Y-002 dated January 26, 2004 signed by then Chairperson Haydee B. Yorac intended to cover necessary administrative and litigation expenses in the recovery and transfer to the Republic of the Philippines - PNB Account, the proceeds of ARELMA account in the United States and West LB Account in Singapore, and all other necessary expenses relative to the execution of the Escrow Agreement entered into between the PCGG and the PNB.



7)	Interview with concerned personnel disclosed that the non-submission of the required Financial Reports (FRs) was due to the expiration of the said Escrow Agreement. The PNB refused to provide copies of monthly FRs for the period covering January to December 2020 to the Accounting Division (AD) to properly reflect all disbursements, interests, charges, and other DMs and CMs accumulated as of year-end.  It is worth mentioning that PNB is continuously charging the dollar account for transaction charges, trust fees and payments to foreign lawyer. Due to the absence of FR, these transactions were not reflected in the books of PCGG as of year-end.



8)	It was noted that there was no change or movement in the dollar account since last year. The decrease of ₱4,631,485.55 from last year’s ending balance of ₱86,787,334.82 was due to the recognition of forex loss during the current year. The reported CIB-FCSA balance of ₱82,155,849.27 as of December 31, 2020 therefore did not reflect all disbursements/charges made by PNB in the account as at year-end; thus, rendering the account balance unreliable.   



9)	The non-submission of FRs as well as non-preparation of BRS with its supporting documents precluded the Audit Team from reviewing and verifying the accuracy of the CIB-FCSA which may result in discrepancies/errors, unrecorded disbursements and DMs/CMs, and other reconciling items not identified/adjusted to its appropriate accounts.



10)	We recommended and Management agreed to:



a)	 renew the Escrow Agreement with the PNB; and

 

b)	direct the Chief Accountant to request in writing submission of FRs by the PNB as basis for recording of transactions and prepare the corresponding BRS to prove the accuracy of the FCSA balance.

    



Due from National Government Agencies (NGAs) account



2)	The balance of Due from NGAs account of ₱1,252,831,052.63 as of December 31, 2020 is unreliable due to discrepancy of ₱879,175.21 between the balance per books of the PCGG and per records of the Sandiganbayan caused by recognition of accrued interest income.  Moreover, the agency transferred funds way beyond the required minimum balance of the eWallet maintained with the PS-DBM for the procurement of common-use supplies through virtual store contrary to GPBB Resolution No. 20-2018.



1)	Section 3.3, Chapter 1, Volume III of the GAM states that:  Due from NGAs is used to recognize advances for purchases of goods/services as authorized by law, fund transfers to NGAs for implementation of projects and other receivables from NGAs.  Credit this account upon receipt of goods/services, and liquidation of fund transfers/receivables.



2)	Section 52, Chapter 19, Volume I of the GAM, states that: Adjustment for Accrued Items.  It is an adjusting entry for an economic activity already undertaken but not yet recognized into asset and revenue accounts or liability and expense accounts. It requires asset/revenue adjustments and liability/expense adjustments.



Assets/Revenue Adjustment.  It involves earned revenues not yet recognized as assets and income at the end of the accounting period.  Examples are receivables for revenue already earned but not yet collected nor billed as at year-end.



3)	The Due from NGAs account has a balance of ₱1,252,831,052.63 as at  December 31, 2020 consisting of the following:

5)	The difference of ₱879,175.21 can be attributed to the recognition of accrued interest income for the month of December 2020 for all escrow account recorded in the books in compliance with the provisions of Section 52, Chapter 19 of the GAM, Volume I. 



6)	We recommended and Management agreed to continue the recognition of accrued interest income pursuant to Sec. 52 Chapter 19 of the GAM Volume I.



b)	Non-compliance with the GPPB Resolution No. 20-2018



7)	GPPB Resolution No. 20-2018 provides the guidelines on the use of virtual store for procurement of Common Use Supplies and Equipment (CSEs) as follows:



5.

Requirements before using the virtual store –



5.4

The Procurement Service (PS) shall create e-wallet for the Agencies for the purpose of depositing funds, which shall be used to pay for the CSEs procured from the Virtual Store.



5.4.1

Agencies shall initially deposit cash funds equivalent to three months of their APP-CSE, whether allocated for the Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE) or Capital Outlay, to a single fund in the PS against which payment for CSEs procured through Virtual Store will be charged.



5.4.2

Agencies shall maintain an eWallet Balance with the PS amounting to at least eight percent of its allocated budget for CSEs for the budget year.



Agencies shall remit to PS, within five working days from receipt of NCA, the amount equivalent to the eWallet Balance required of them.



5.4.3

PS shall automatically return to the Agencies the unexpended amount of the eWallet Balance at the end of the fiscal year.



7.1

The Virtual Store will automatically draw down from the eWallet and update the eWallet Balance upon order confirmation.

	

8)	In compliance with the provisions of GPPB Resolution No. 20-2018, PCGG maintained eWallet with PS-DBM to be able to procure CSEs using the Virtual Store. During the year, the PCGG transferred funds to PS the total amount of ₱2,438,693.60 to cover funding for eWallet and Desktop Computers/Softwares as follows:

10)	It was noted that the PCGG needed ₱241,400.27 to maintain the PS eWallet during the year. However, the year-end balance of eWallet amounting to ₱1,160,093.77 and ₱594,998.94 for CSE and Airfare, respectively, was way beyond the required maintaining balance of at least eight percent.



11)	Verification showed that PCGG made the following cash transfers to eWallet before the year ends, to wit:

Replenishment of air fare as of December 15, 2020

94,531.14

Total

₱564,722.47



12)	Based on the computed maintaining eWallet balance of ₱241,400.37, the replenishment made by the agency in the amount of ₱564,722.47 before the year ends was contrary to the guidelines. This incident was attributed to the failure of Management to coordinate with PS on the proper use of the Virtual Store so as to avoid over remittance to PS eWallet. Also, the agency need not have to transfer fund at year-end since the GPPB Resolution clearly states that the PS shall return all unexpended balance of the eWallet as of year-end.



13)	We recommended and Management agreed to comply with the provisions of GPBB Resolution No. 20-2018 in maintaining the PS eWallet.  Also, demand from PS to return all unexpended balances of the eWallet as of year-end.





	Weakness on stock/inventory monitoring 



3)	The Office Supplies Inventory (OSI) account balance of ₱488,955.07 as of December 31, 2020 includes: (a) non-moving/idle items totaling ₱110,244.09 of which ₱42,700.65 of OSI has already expired; and (b) expired moving items amounting to ₱37,456.19 caused by weakness on stock/inventory monitoring by Management. 



1)	Section 15 of Chapter 2 states that:  Fair Presentation.  The FSs shall present fairly the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of an entity.  Fair presentation requires faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in PPSAS. The application of PPSAS, with appropriate disclosures, if necessary, would result in fair presentation of the FS.



2)	Review of the Schedule of OSI purchases/deliveries and the Report on the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) covering the years 2018 to 2020 disclosed non-moving inventory items amounting to ₱110,244.09. Details are as follows:

5)	The audit team took one expired cartridge as sample to determine if the same can still be used after the expiration date. While we observed that it can still be used even beyond the expiration date, some expired ink/cartridge may not be compatible with the existing printer and may eventually dry out and become useless over time.



6)	This deficiency can be attributed to the failure of Management to monitor stocks and to use First In, First Out method of issuance of stock.



7)	We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Property personnel to:



a)	use First In, First Out (FIFO) method in issuing supplies and materials where the items with the earliest expiration date should be issued first to avoid further obsolescence of items that are still usable as to date; and 



b)	prepare Waste Material Report (WMR) for expired non-moving and moving inventory items and submit the same to the Accounting Division for proper adjustments.  Henceforth, Property personnel strictly monitor balances of inventories and evaluate carefully the requisitions before procurement to ensure that items are bought in appropriate quantities at an opportune time to avoid existence of non-moving and expired items.



8)	Management commented that the Property Division will revisit procedures in the procurement of office supplies to ensure that appropriate quantity/amount will be procured and existence of non-moving and expired items will be avoided.





Unreliable Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) account balance



4)	The balance of PPE accounts with carrying amount of ₱141,535,863.46 at year-end is unreliable due to unreconciled difference between accounting records and property records amounting to ₱718,926,225.55 which include misclassification of semi-expendable items as PPE amounting to ₱19,140.00. Moreover, various deficiencies indicating weakness over asset management were noted.



1)	One of the qualitative characteristics of financial reporting as provided in Section 6(e), Chapter 19, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs is reliability of information free from material errors and bias that can be depended on by users to represent faithfully that which it purports to represent or could reasonably be expected to represent.



2)	COA Circular No. 2020-006 dated January 31, 2020 provides the guidelines for the one-time cleansing of PPE balances and the procedures in the conduct of physical count of PPE, recognition of PPE items found at station, and disposition for non-existing/missing PPE items.



3)	Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM provides basic accounting policies and principles on PPE in accordance with the IPSAS. Audit of PPE accounts disclosed a number of deficiencies affecting the accounts, to wit: 



a)	Unreconciled difference between the accounting and property records ₱718,926,225.55



4)	Section 42, Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs provides that: the Chief Accountant shall maintain the Property Plant and Equipment Ledger Card (PPELC) for each category of PPE including work and other animals, livestock etc. The PPELC shall be kept to record promptly the acquisition, description, custody, estimated useful life, depreciation, impairment loss, disposal and other information about the asset. For check and balance, the Property and Supply Office/Unit shall likewise maintain PC for PPE in their custody to account for the receipt and disposition of the same. The balance per PC shall be reconciled with PPELC maintained by Accounting Division (AD). They shall also be reconciled with other property records like PAR.



5)	Comparison of the balances between the PPELC and RPCPPE disclosed an aggregate difference of ₱718,926,225.55, as summarized below:

c)	Misclassification of issued semi-expendable items as PPE amounting to ₱19,140.00



Section 3, Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs laid down the criteria for recognition of PPE. Item e thereof specifically states that the cost of an item of PPE shall be recognized as asset if, and only if it meets the capitalization threshold of ₱15,000.00.



Furthermore, Section 4(b), Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM provides that the threshold of ₱15,000.00 shall be applied on an individual asset or per item basis. Each item within the bulk acquisition with aggregate or total value of PPE, such as library books, computer peripherals and small items of equipment, will need to meet the capitalization threshold to be recognized as PPE.



Review of accounting records disclosed that at least three tangible items, already issued to end-user, with costs falling below the capitalization threshold were classified as PPE resulting in the overstatement of Books by ₱19,140.00 and Accumulated Depreciation-Books by ₱17,226.00 and the overstatement of Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) by ₱1,914.00.  Details of the issued semi-expendable items are shown below:

d)	A number of PPE items had matching property numbers/unique descriptions but with different assigned cost/value due to error in recording and use of revaluation cost in the RPCPPE as shown in Annex B	. The use of revaluation cost by Property Division to record the value of land is inconsistent with the cost model in the measurement of PPE after recognition.



Section 22, Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs states that, for consistency and uniformity, the cost model shall be applied to an entire class of PPE. Cost model means that PPE are carried at cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.



e)	PPE items without assigned cost/value in the RPCPPE.



The following PPEs have no corresponding cost in the RPCPPE that added up to the unreconciled amount between the PPELC and the RPCPPE:

f)	Unrecorded PPE amounting to ₱8,422,319.43 (Annex C) or those found in station during physical count but not recorded in the books. Some of these items have no property number/unique description in the PPELC. 



g)	Unaccounted PPE totaling ₱5,429,679.24 (Annex D) or those recorded in the books but were not reported in the RPCPPE. Some items were recorded in the books but with property number or unique property description that did not match with that of in the RPCPPE. 



7)	The failure to match and reconcile PPE without property number/unique description per records of Accounting Division and Administrative Services Division was brought about by the following reasons:

8)	We recommended and Management agreed to:



a)	immediately reconcile the accounting and property records in compliance with Section 42, Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs and make the necessary adjustments in the respective records, as needed; 



b)	ensure that PPE records are reconciled regularly and that only PPE purchased and delivered as of year-end costing at least ₱15,000.00 are included in the RPCPPE to facilitate reconciliation with accounting records;



c)	instruct the Chief Accountant to make necessary adjusting entry to reclassify misclassified assets to its appropriate account;



d)	reconcile the assigned cost/value in the RPCPPE and PPELC following the cost model, pursuant to Section 22, Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs;



e)	vouch source documents to determine the cost/value of items reported in the RPCPPE without assigned cost/value. If not available, conduct appraisal of subject properties for proper measurement and valuation;



f)	submit necessary documents to Accounting Division (AD) to support items found during physical count but remained unrecorded in the books;



g)	demand the production of or locate items recorded in the books which were not reported in the RPCPPE. In case of inexistent items, identify the person/s responsible/liable therefor and demand payment equivalent to the money value of the missing/lost property; 



h)	trace the reference property numbers from available source documents, otherwise, reassign property numbers to items without proper identification numbers and those with duplicate or multiple property numbers using a systematic property identification system that can provide a unique code for each class/type of PPE, as prescribed in the GAM for NGAs; and



i)	implement COA Circular No. 2020-006 dated January 31, 2020 for the one-time cleansing of PPE balances, if appropriate.



b)	Undisposed unserviceable PPE valued at ₱3,704,930.00



9)	Section 79 of PD No. 1445 states that: When government property has become unserviceable for any cause, or is no longer needed, it shall, upon application of the officer accountable therefore, be inspected by the head of the agency or his duly authorized representative in the presence of the auditor concerned and, if found to be valueless or unsalable, it may be destroyed in their presence. If found to be valuable, it may be sold at public auction to the highest bidder under the supervision of the proper committee on award or similar body in the presence of the auditor concerned or other duly authorized representative of the Commission, after advertising by printed notice in the Official Gazette, or for not less than three consecutive days in any newspaper of general circulation, or where the value of the property does not warrant the expense of publication, by notices posted for a like period in at least three public places in the locality where the property is to be sold. In the event that the public auction fails, the property may be sold at a private sale at such price as may be fixed by the same committee or body concerned and approved by the Commission.



10)	Various unserviceable properties consisting of air conditioners, CPUs, laptops, printer, fax machine and motor vehicles remained undisposed at year-end which expose the same to further damage, deterioration and diminution in fair market value. Details are as follows:

11)	It was noted that the space occupied by these properties, especially motor vehicles, could have been used for other useful purposes considering the limited parking space for serviceable vehicles within the agency premises.



12)	We recommended and Management agreed to institute actions for the immediate disposal of the listed unserviceable properties pursuant to Section 79 of PD 1445.



13)	The Management also commented that there were several attempts to dispose the motor vehicles, but it failed due to various reasons. There was a plan to conduct disposal in 2020 but it did not prosper because of various limitations caused by the emerging pandemic. 



c)	Ninety-three (93) PPEs not supported with PAR and in several instances, the official end-user of PPE per PAR either differs from the actual/present end-user or no longer connected with the agency



14)	Section 42(f), Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs emphasizes the use and importance of PAR in ensuring property accountability for the agency’s PPE.  It is a form used in the Supply and/or Property Division/Unit to record issuance of PPE to end-user maintained by fund cluster and renewed every three years or every time there is a change in custodianship/user of the property. 



15)	At least 93 PPEs totaling ₱9,254,878.69 were issued to end-users without corresponding PAR (Annex F). In some cases, the official end-user indicated in the latest PAR differs from the actual or present end-user as specified in the RPCPPE.  We also noted that two end-users were no longer connected with the agency and one was confirmed deceased but remained accountable per property records, as shown below.

*No longer with the agency**Deceased

  Latest PAR issued/official end-user per PAR



16)	Clearly, some PARs were not updated regularly as the actual or present end-users were not issued with a new PAR to transfer property accountabilities, a clear manifestations of a weak internal control system and poor monitoring of accountability for government properties as contemplated under Chapter 5 of PD 1445. Under Section 102(2) thereof, it states that, persons entrusted with the possession or custody of funds or property under the agency head shall be immediately responsible to him, without prejudice to the liability of either party to the government.



17)	Furthermore, Section 105(1) of the same Chapter and PD provides that, every officer accountable for government property shall be liable for its money value in case of improper or unauthorized use or misappropriation thereof, by himself or any person for whose acts he may be responsible. He shall likewise be liable for all losses, damages, or deterioration occasioned by negligence in the keeping or use of the property whether or not it be at the time in his actual custody.  The failure of the Property Division to update PARs and monitor issuances may lead to conflict on property accountability in the event of loss/damage due to negligence of actual/present user/s.









18)	We recommended and Management agreed to:



a)	investigate issues raised and for items without PAR, direct the concerned personnel of Property Division to issue PARs duly acknowledged by end-users; and



b)	for PPEs with inconsistency on end-user, instruct the concerned personnel of Property Division to cancel previous PAR and issue new PAR to the actual end-users; and update the PAR every time there is change of end-user.  



d)	Required PPE reports/forms not properly accomplished



19)	Section 42, Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs listed down various forms and reports necessary in the accounting for PPE while Volume II of the GAM also provides the pro forma forms and reports including detailed instructions on how to properly accomplish the same. 



20)	Review of various forms/reports maintained by the Accounting and Property Divisions showed a number of deficiencies or deviations from that prescribed in the GAM. The forms/reports were either lacking of the prescribed information such as fund code/name, account code, estimated useful life, property number, etc., some required fields/columns were not filled-out, and several others were not prepared or maintained by fund cluster.  The observations are as follows:



Required Forms/Reports

Deficiencies/Errors

Property Card (Appendix 70)

PCs were not maintained by the Property Division by fund cluster. The fund cluster name/code was also not indicated on the face of PCs.



PCs did not function as intended. Per GAM, it shall be used to record acquisitions (based on the IAR and other supporting documents), issue/transfer/disposal and the description/ information about the asset. However, audit of PCs revealed that the quantity of items under the receipt and issue columns including the balance per item were not indicated, contrary to its intended purpose. Again, PCs are used to account for the quantity of PPE items received and issued to eventually monitor the remaining PPE in the custody of the Property Division and for planning, budgeting and accounting purposes.



Some items bear no reference numbers for cross-referencing and reconciliation purposes.

Property, Plant and Equipment Ledger Card (Appendix 71)

Some fields/columns were not filled-out such as:

--	Object Account Code

--	Estimated Useful Life

--	Rate of Depreciation

--	Adjusted Cost

--	Repair History



The type of document such as JEV was not indicated in most cases under the reference column. Only numbers were indicated without specifying the type of document for easier cross-referencing.



A number of PPE items had no assigned property numbers.

Property Acknowledgment Receipt (Appendix 72)

PARs were not maintained by the Property Division by fund cluster. The fund cluster name/code was also not indicated on the face of PARs.



The numbering system was not in accordance with the GAM prescribing the year-month-serial number (one series for each year) format. PAR numbers did not show the specific year and month of issuance and serial numbers were continuous across years and not on a per year basis.



In many cases, the amount, date of acquisition and property numbers were not indicated.

Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (Appendix 73)

The report submitted was consolidated (all funds) and not by fund cluster making it more difficult to reconcile with the accounting records. The fund cluster name/code was also not indicated in the report.



The “Quantity per Property Card” and “Shortage/Overage” columns were not filled-out. These are significant reconciling tools to immediately identify missing/ unaccounted and unrecorded items and other discrepancies that may be encountered during the conduct of physical count.



Some items in the report have no indicated quantity per physical count but with assigned cost/value composing the total amount.



21)	The noted observations on the preparation and accomplishment of the required PPE reports and forms were indicative of a weak internal control system, contrary to the purpose/s for which the forms/reports were created as provided under Section 42, Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs.



22)	We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the concerned accounting and property personnel to conform and accomplish the required forms and reports as prescribed in Volume II of the GAM for NGAs to strengthen the monitoring and accounting control system of the agency, pursuant to Section 42, Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs.



e)	Delayed submission of RPCPPE



23)	Section 38, Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs states that, the entity shall have a periodic physical count of PPE, which shall be done annually and presented on the RPCPPE (Appendix 71) as at December 31 of each year. This shall be submitted to the Auditor concerned not later than January 31 of the following year.



24)	Verification of PPE report disclosed that the CY 2020 RPCPPE was submitted only on February 23, 2021 or 23 days delayed from the deadline of submission of the report which precluded the Audit Team from conducting timely analysis and reconciliation of PPE items between the accounting and property records.



25)	We recommended and Management agreed to direct the concerned property personnel in the conduct of future annual inventory taking to undertake the same ahead of time in order to cope up with the deadline. 





Unrecorded Confiscated Property/Assets



5)	Nine short firearms confiscated from former President Ferdinand E. Marcos and officially turned over to the Philippine Government through the PCGG in April 1993 remained unrecorded in the books of PCGG for almost 28 years, thereby understating the Confiscated Property/Assets and Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) accounts as of December 31, 2020 by its total current fair market value. 



1)	The PCGG was created on February 28, 1986 by EO No. 1 to assist the President of the Philippines in the recovery of all ill-gotten wealth accumulated by former President Ferdinand E. Marcos, his immediate family, relatives, subordinates and close associates, whether located in the Philippines or abroad, including the takeover or sequestration of all business enterprises and entities owned or controlled by them, during his administration, directly or through nominees, by taking undue advantage of their public office and/or using their powers, authority, influence, connections or relationship.



2)	Former President Marcos and his close family members and friends fled to the United States of America, after the successful EDSA Revolution on February 26, 1986.



3)	As stated in PCGG Resolution No. 93-015A dated April 28, 1993, the United States Bureau of Customs confiscated from the entourage of former President Marcos various personal properties among which were nine short firearms described as follows:

4)	The United States Bureau of Customs turned over the above listed nine firearms to the Philippine Government through the PCGG sometime in April 1993 for the use of its Commissioners and other officials for their security and personal protection.



5)	Verification of accounting records disclosed that said firearms were not appraised at the time of turn-over and never recorded in the books of PCGG since April 1993 or for almost 28 years. 



6)	Under the Revised Chart of Accounts (RCA), updated 2019, Volume III of the GAM for NGAs, Confiscated Property/Assets account is defined as, an account debited to recognize the fair value of confiscated property/assets controlled by the government. This account is credited for disposal, reclassification to other PPE accounts, and/or adjustments.



7)	The firearms being confiscated properties were not properly recorded in the books and measured at its fair market value as of December 31, 2020. The failure of Management to record the nine confiscated firearms understated the Confiscated Property/Assets account by its total fair market value and Accumulated Surplus/ (Deficit) account by the same amount.



8)	We recommended and Management agreed to conduct an appraisal of the nine confiscated firearms found in the custody of the PCGG to determine its current fair market value and record the same in the books under the account Confiscated Property/Assets in the amount equivalent to its total fair market value.



	

	

	

	

Non-recognition of operating lease receivables for uncollected rentals as of year-end 



6)	Uncollected rentals totaling ₱2,846,722.18 from three sequestered condominium units at GdM and from seven tenants at the People’s Center Library and Sto. Nińo Shrine in Tacloban City were not recognized in the books as Operating Lease Receivable as of December 31, 2020; thus, misstating the affected accounts in the financial statements.



a)	Unrecorded lease receivables on three sequestered condominium units at GdM totaling ₱2,282,523.00.

4)		As can be gleaned from the above table, Management failed to collect rental fees amounting to ₱71,772.74 from lessee number 2 during the months of April and May 2020. However, the amount was not taken up in the books as receivable under the account Operating Lease Receivable and a corresponding credit to Other Payables account which understate both accounts as of year-end by the same amount. Other Payables account is credited because all collections from sequestered properties under Fund 184 (Trust Receipts Fund) should be properly remitted to the BTr under escrow pending decision on ownership by the proper court.

6)		Interview with the personnel-in-charge and concerned GdM staff disclosed that association dues for unit nos. AA-212 and AA-318 were regularly paid by the existing tenant for the whole year.  Audit of DVs also revealed that no payment of association dues for the said units transpired during the year.

	

7)		Based on the foregoing information, it is clear that unit nos. AA-212 and AA-318 were not vacant in CY 2020 but no rental fees for said units were collected and recorded in the books during the year. It should be noted that PCGG collected rental fees from three units (unit nos. AA-214; K-102; and AA-129) only instead of five units, raising doubts on the accuracy and completeness of recorded collections.



8)		Based on the Management’s comment, the total uncollected rental fee for CY 2020 amounted to ₱2,210,750.26 for unit nos. AA-212 and AA-318 which resulted in the understatement of Operating Lease Receivable and Other Payables by ₱2,282,523.00 as summarized below:

9)		We recommended and Management agreed to:

	b)		direct the personnel-in-charge at GdM to collect the same as they become due, pursuant to RA No. 11469 also known as “Bayanihan to Heal as One Act” and RA No. 11494 cited as “Bayanihan to Recover as One Act”.

	

10)		Management commented that collection letters were already sent to both tenants on March 8, 2021 for their compliance and the outcome shall be reported to the COA Resident Auditor for information and consideration. Non-compliance on the matter shall be endorsed to the PCGG Legal Department for appropriate legal action. The breakdown of the total collectibles as of February 28, 2021 follows:

B)	COMPLIANCE AUDIT



Deputation and/or confirmation requirements of private and in-house lawyers



7)	Deputation and/or confirmation requirements of PCGG private and in-house lawyers by the OSG and COA were complied with by the Agency.  



1)	PCGG was created by virtue of EO No. 1 issued on February 28, 1986 by then President Corazon C. Aquino.  Its role as a catalyst to enhance the recovery of ill-gotten wealth was further strengthened by the issuance of EO No. 2 on March 12, 1986, EO No. 13 on April 23, 1986 and EO No. 14 on May 7, 1986.  



2)	To attain its mandate, the PCGG secured legal services of private lawyers under various Contracts of Services (COS) and in-house lawyers to render legal services in assistance to the OSG, pursuant to COA Circular Nos. 95-011 and 2012-001. 



3)	COA Circular No. 95-011 dated December 4, 1995 states that public funds shall not be utilized for payment of services of a private legal counsel or law firm to represent government agencies in court or to render legal services for them. However, in the event that such legal services cannot be avoided or is justified under extraordinary or exceptional circumstances, a written conformity and acquiescence of the Solicitor General (SolGen) or the Government Corporate Counsel, as the case may be, with the written concurrence of COA shall first be secured before hiring or employment of a private lawyer or law firm.



4)	Moreover, Section 5.6 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 provides that, lawyer personnel, including those designated to assume the duties of a legal officer and those in the legal staff of departments, bureaus, offices or agencies of the national government, are authorized to receive an allowance, subject to pertinent provisions of the GAA for the year, for each appearance or attendance in a court hearing except pursuant to a motion for extension, provided that the concerned lawyer is duly deputized by the OSG to appear in court as special counsel in collaboration with the SolGen or prosecutors concerned.



5)	Audit of Fund 151 disclosed that all transactions involving payments of professional and appearance fees of private lawyers for CY 2020 were supported with COS and letter of OSG deputizing the concerned lawyer duly concurred by the COA.  It was also noted that the sole in-house lawyer-payee was deputized by OSG to appear in court as special counsel on behalf of PCGG, which resulted in PCGG’s compliance with pertinent provisions of COA Circular No. 95-011 and Section 5.6 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 (Annex H for details).



6)	We recommended and Management agreed to continuously comply with the provisions of COA Circular No. 95-011 and Section 5.6 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 in order to secure qualified and competent lawyers to assist the OSG in different cases involving recovery of ill-gotten wealth.





Delayed submission of Accomplishment Reports (ARs) and Post-trial Reports (PTRs)



8)	Delayed submission of ARs and PTRs by some private lawyers ranging from three to 90 days were not in conformity with the provisions of the Contract of Service (COS) entered into by and between the PCGG and private lawyers; thus, resulted in the overpayment of ₱45,600.00. Further, the payments for appearance fees lacked the requisite supporting documents contrary to Section 5.6 of COA Circular No. 2012-001.



The PCGG engaged the services of private lawyers in CYs 2019 and 2020 through COS between the former and the latter with validity from August 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019 and July 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020.

a)		Xxxx;

b)		Xxxx;

c)		The SLC shall submit to the PCGG a post-trial report via e-mail or hard copy within 15 calendar days after each appearance in a hearing/trial;







2)	Section 56, and Section 51, General Provisions of the GAA for FY 2019 and FY 2020, respectively, state that, government lawyers designated to assume the duties of a legal officer are authorized an allowance of ₱5,000 for each appearance or attendance to court hearings.



3)	The allowances granted were subject to conditions as stipulated in the GAA and must be duly supported with the following required documents enumerated under Section 5.6 of COA Circular No. 2012-001, to wit:



“

1)	Office Order/Designation/Letter of the OSG deputizing the claimant to appear in court as special counsel;

3)	Certification that the cases to be attended by the lawyer personnel are directly related to the nature/function of the particular office represented; and 

4)	Certification issued by the concerned lawyer and the Agency Accountant that the amount being claimed is still within the limitation under the GAA.”



a)	 Some private lawyers incurred delays ranging from three to 90 days in the submission of ARs and PTRs



Accomplishment Reports



4)	Audit showed that for CY 2019 and 2020, the COS consistently require the submission of ARs on time, otherwise, deductions of ₱100.00 per day of delay in the submission of reportorial requirements will be imposed.



5)	We noted that, out of the 59 transactions/pay periods covered by 15 DVs, nine DVs consisting of 26 transactions or equivalent to 44 percent, incurred delays ranging from three to 90 days in the submission of ARs (Annex I for details).



6)	Moreover, of the total 26 transactions, 20 were paid in full without corresponding deductions totaling ₱44,300.00 for late submission of ARs.  On the other hand, the delays in the remaining six transactions were not fully deducted from the claims of the lawyers or a balance of ₱1,300.00. Thus, the total overpayment of allowance amounted to ₱45,600.00 (₱44,300.00+₱1,300.00) as a result of Management’s failure to deduct/fully deduct the delays incurred in the submission of ARs. 



Post-trial Reports (PTRs)



7)	Further, audit of the DVs relevant to claims of appearance fees disclosed that the following private lawyers appeared in five hearings and were paid in CY 2020 as shown below.

8)	Records showed that private lawyers appeared in five hearings, however, three were noted to have been supported with PTRs submitted beyond the deadline of submission per COS. Nevertheless, the total computed amount of penalty amounting to ₱3,500.00 for late submission of PTR was already deducted in full under various DVs.



9)	We recommended and Management agreed to strictly implement the provisions in the COS as regards submission of ARs and PTRs and demand the refund of overpayment of professional fees amounting to ₱45,600.00 from the concerned lawyers.



10)	As of this report, the total amount of ₱45,600.00 was refunded by the concerned lawyers under various ORs. Management also committed to monitor submission of ARs and PTRs to avoid the incurrence of delay and penalties.



b)	Lack of documentary requirements for appearance fees 



11)	Further review and evaluation of DVs and supporting documents revealed that claims for appearance fees totaling ₱16,065.00 were paid despite absence of required certification from the concerned lawyers and agency accountant, detailed as follows:

12)	During the year, there were seven transactions representing payment of appearance fees to various lawyers.  Two (f and g) complied with the submission of required documents while five transactions or equivalent to 71 percent were paid without the certifications issued by concerned lawyers and the agency accountant contrary to Section 5.6 of COA Cir. No. 2012-001.



13)	Inquiry with concerned officials revealed that there was laxity in the monitoring and examination of supporting documents in the payments of professional and appearance fees.



14)	We recommended and Management agreed to submit the lacking certifications as required under Section 5.6 of COA Circular No. 2012-001.  Henceforth, instruct the Chief Accountant to strictly monitor and examine supporting documents before processing of any claims.



15)	In compliance with audit recommendations, Management already submitted the lacking certifications to the Audit Team to support payment of appearance fees to private lawyers and committed to comply with submission of required certification in the future.





COVID Funds



9)	Out of the 12 Disbursement Vouchers (DVs) representing payment of Hazard Pay totaling ₱306,500.00 to its personnel who physically reported for work during Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) and Modified Enhanced Community Quarantine (MECQ), six DVs amounting to ₱95,000.00 were not supported with documentary requirements prescribed in Item 5.6 of COA Memorandum No. 2020-019 dated November 9, 2020 while six DVs totaling ₱211,500.00 and its supporting documents were not submitted for post audit, contrary to Sections 4 (5-6), 100 and 122 of PD 1445.  Moreover, the lists of personnel/workers who reported for work were not attached, inconsistent with Item 4.3 of the DBM Circular No. 2020-1 dated March 24, 2020; hence, casting doubt on the legitimacy of the hazard pay recipients.



1)		Administrative Order (AO) No. 26 dated March 23, 2020 was issued by the Office of the President authorizing the grant of hazard pay to government personnel occupying regular, contractual or casual positions, or who are engaged through COS or JO basis who physically report for work in their respective work stations during the implementation of an ECQ relative to the COVID-19 outbreak in the country. The authorized amount of COVID-19 Hazard Pay was ₱500.00 per day per person.



a)		Payments for Hazard Pay amounting to P95,000.00 were not supported with documentary requirements

	

2)		COA Memorandum No. 2020-019 dated November 9, 2020 was issued prescribing guidelines in the Financial and Compliance Audit of COVID-19 Funds during the State of National Emergency.

	

3)		Item 5.6 of the aforementioned memorandum provides that:

	

The auditor shall examine whether the payment for Hazard Pay, SRA and Duty Allowance were supported by the following: 

	

a)		Authority for the entitlement of the allowance;

b)		Terms of Reference/Memorandum of Understanding with provisions for authority to pay private health workers; 

c)		Certificate of attendance during the ECQ/MECQ period; and

d)		ATF Resolution of the Risk Classification in the workplace.



4)		Section 4 of PD 1445 further provides that:



Fundamental principles. Financial transactions and operations of any government agency shall be governed by the fundamental principles set forth hereunder, to wit:



     x    x    x    x

5)	Disbursements or disposition of government funds or property shall invariably bear the approval of the proper officials.

6)	Claims against government funds shall be supported with complete documentation.



5)		Section 100 and 122 of PD 1445 also provides that:

	

	Reports of disbursing officers in a government agency. Disbursing officers in any government agency shall render monthly reports of their transactions pursuant to regulations of the Commission to be submitted not later than the fifth day of the ensuing month to the auditor concerned who shall conduct the necessary examination and audit within thirty days from receipt thereof.



Section 122. Submission of reports. Whenever deemed necessary in the exigencies of the service, the Commission may under regulations issued by it require the agency heads, chief accountants, budget officers, cashiers, disbursing officers, administrative or personnel officers, and other responsible officials of the various agencies to submit trial balances, physical inventory reports, current plantilla of personnel, and such other reports as may be necessary for the exercise of its functions.



6)		Verification of the Report of ADA Issued and LDDAP-ADA-Nos. 01101101-11-277 to 279-2020 dated November 5, 2020 amounting to ₱84,500.00 and DV’s proof of receipt of payment for Check Nos. 1418832-1418834 dated December 7, 2020 amounting to ₱10,500.00 representing six related DVs totaling ₱95,000.00 (₱84,500.00+₱10,500.00) disclosed that Certificate of Attendance during the ECQ and MECQ period and IATF Resolution of the Risk Classification in the workplace were not attached as supporting documents for payment of hazard pay, contrary to Item 5.6 of said COA Memorandum.  Neither certified true copy of the DTR nor copy of the Logbook was submitted. Payments were processed even without complete supporting documents to prove validity and propriety of claims, contrary to Section 4 (5-6) of PD 1445. Details are as follows:

8)		The delayed submission of DVs and its supporting documents hindered the Auditor from conducting timely audit of accounts and communication of deficiencies, if any.

	

9)		We recommended and Management agreed to submit the lacking DVs with its documentary requirements in compliance with Item 5.6 of COA Memorandum No. 2020-019 dated November 9, 2020 and Sections 4 (5-6), 100 and 122 of PD 1445.



10)		In compliance with audit recommendations, DVs and supporting documents were submitted on March 9, 2021.

	

b)		Recipients of the Hazard Pay (HP) were not specifically identified



11)		The DBM Budget Circular No. 2020-01 dated March 24, 2020 provides the guidelines on the grant of COVID-19 HP. Item 4.3 of the said Budget Circular states one of the conditions on the grant of the hazard pay, to wit:

	

	The personnel/workers have been authorized to physically report for work at their respective offices or work stations on the prescribed official working hours by the head of agency/office during the period of implementation of ECQ measures in the area of such office or work station.



12)		Review of agency’s compliance with the Budget Circular revealed that Management observed the following conditions on grant of HP:

		

1)		The paid employees are occupying regular, contractual or casual positions, or who are engaged through COS or JO basis; and

	

2)		The amount paid was P500 per day based on the actual number of days the employee reported for work during the ECQ and MECQ.



13)		The Office of the Acting Chairperson issued Office Order (OO) No. 162 (RSM-03-16-2020) dated March 16, 2020 providing the Interim Policy on Alternative Work Arrangement (AWA) of PCGG employees as a response to the directive of President Rodrigo R. Duterte to form skeletal workforce in the government. The OO sets forth the guidelines in the AWA of the agency effective March 16, 2020 to April 30, 2020 only, unless extended by another OO.

			

14)		The audit team noted that the OO did not specifically indicate or identify the persons who would be reporting on specific dates during the ECQ/MECQ. Though the OO specifically tasked the Unit/Division/Department to submit to HRDD and Office of the Commission Secretary the schedules of employees who will serve as skeletal workforce (SWF) from March 16 to April 30, 2020, no schedule was attached as supporting documents in the DVs for employees’ claim of HP. Post audit of DVs supporting documents showed that employees who reported for work only submitted ARs and were summarized in the Authority to Pay COVID-19 HP duly approved by the Unit/Division/Department Head; thus, inconsistent with item 4.3 of the DBM BC No. 2020-01 that requires the personnel/workers to have authority to physically report for work at their respective offices or work stations on prescribed official working hours by the head of agency/office during the period of implementation of ECQ measures in the area of such office or work station.

				

15)		Inquiry with HRDD personnel disclosed that each division submitted a list of employees that will report physically for work during ECQ/MECQ.  However, no such schedule/list was attached to DVs for payment of HP for the periods March 17-31, May 1-30 and August 4-18, 2020; thus, casting doubt on the validity of claims. Moreover, confirmation with the Officer–in-Charge (OIC) of HRDD revealed that except for OO No. 162 that is effective until April 30, 2020, no other OO was issued; thus payments of HP for the period May 1, 2020 to August 18, 2020 were not covered with OO. The OIC-HRDD also submitted a Memorandum on Internal Guidelines of PCGG Implementation of AWA pursuant to CSC MC.10, s. 2020 dated September 21, 2020 which took effect on October 1, 2020. The memo states that heads of the offices shall continue to provide HRDD, one week prior to the 1st day of the month, their respective employees AWA schedules for one (1) month.



16)		We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Human Resource Development Division (HRDD) to submit schedules/lists of employees per department who are required to physically report for work during ECQ/MECQ in compliance with Item 4.3 of the DBM BC No. 2020-01.



17)		In compliance with the audit recommendation, schedules/lists from each department specifying employees required to report physically for work during the implementation of ECQ/MECQ were submitted on March 9, 2021.





Compliance with BIR, GSIS, Pag-IBIG and Philhealth regulations



10)	Delayed remittance of taxes withheld and Philhealth and GSIS contributions of employees ranging from one to 69 days, contrary to existing laws and regulations pertinent thereto, may result in unnecessary penalties and charges. 



1)	Section 69 of PD 1445 states that:



	1. Public officers authorized to receive and collect moneys arising from taxes, revenues, or receipts of any kind shall remit or deposit intact the full amounts so received and collected by them to the treasury of the agency concerned xxx.

	

2)	The PCGG pays salaries of its regular employees and job order workers on a semi-monthly basis where taxes, GSIS, Pag-IBIG and Philhealth premium contributions are deducted. The taxes and premium contributions withheld and remitted for CY 020 are summarized below:

12)	We recommended and Management agreed to remit immediately withheld taxes and contributions to BIR, Philhealth and GSIS to ensure full compliance to existing laws and regulations and to avoid risk of penal sanctions.





Compliance with Property Insurance Law



11)	Management failed to prepare and submit Property Inventory Form (PIF) to COA to support the assessment of general insurance coverage of all insurable assets and properties of the government with the General Insurance Fund (GIF) of the GSIS in violation of COA Circular No. 2018-002.

	

1)		COA Circular No. 2018-002 dated May 31, 2018 provides guidelines prescribing submission of PIF.  It sets out the guidelines that heads of the agencies shall direct the pertinent official under his/her supervision to:





a)	Secure directly from the GSIS GIF, all insurances or bonds covering properties, contracts, rights of action, and other insurable risks of their respective offices;



b)	Prepare the PIF listing of all the insurable properties and other assets, showing their latest appraised values/valuation, appraisal date, location, and other information; 

	

2)		Review of the Summary of Service Payments (SSP) for the period January to December 2020, DVs and supporting documents revealed insurance payments in compliance with RA No. 656 otherwise known as the Property Insurance Law detailed in Annex J.



3)		To date, Management has submitted only 17 existing GSIS insurance coverage with a total amount insured of ₱45,512,086.50. It was noted that no duly accomplished PIF was prepared and submitted to this Office and to GSIS to validate completeness and adequacy of existing coverage. Management used previous insurance policy as basis in the renewal of its insurance of properties.



4)		Verification of the agency’s APP for FY 2020 disclosed that the amount budgeted for the insurance of its insurable properties and other assets amounted to ₱350,000.00 which is sufficient to cover the actual amount paid for insurance premiums totaling ₱193,082.41.

	

5)		We recommended and Management agreed to prepare and submit PIF to COA as prescribed under COA Circular No. 2018-002.





GAD programs, projects and accomplishments



12)	The GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) and Accomplishment Report (AR) for the year 2020 submitted by the Agency were not endorsed by the Philippine Commission on Women (PCW) contrary to PCW-National Economic and Development Authority-Department of Budget and Management (PCW-NEDA-DBM) Joint Circular (JC) No. 2012-01.  Moreover, the agency failed to comply with the mandatory requirement of allocating at least five percent of its total appropriations for GAD programs, projects and activities, contrary to Section 31 of the 2020 GAA.



1)		The PCW-NEDA-DBM JC No. 2012-01 sets forth the guidelines for the preparation of Annual GPB and AR to implement the Magna Carta of Women. Item 8.2 of the circular provides that the GAD Focal Point Systems (GFPS) shall then submit the final GPBs and the corresponding GAD ARs to PCW for review and endorsement to DBM.

	

2)		Section 31 of 2020 GAA on the programs and projects related to GAD states that:

Programs and Projects Related to Gender and Development. All agencies of the government shall formulate a GAD Plan designed to address gender issues within their concerned sectors or mandate and implement the applicable provisions under R.A. No. 9710 or the Magna Carta for Women, Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the Beijing Platform for Action, the Philippine Plan for Gender-Responsive Development, and the Philippine Development Plan.  



The GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of the agencies, which shall be at least five percent of their budgets. For this purpose, activities being undertaken by agencies which relate to GAD or those that contribute to poverty alleviation, economic empowerment especially of marginalized women, protection, promotion, and fulfillment of women’s human rights, and practice of gender responsive governance are considered sufficient compliance with said requirement. xxx.



3)		The submitted GPB and AR by the PCGG GAD Focal Point Team on January 28, 2021 and February 27,2021, respectively, were not duly approved and endorsed by the PCW. The GPB is under review by PCW while the AR is still for submission to PCW.  

	

4)		Verification of the submitted GPB revealed that Management allocated only 4.68 percent or ₱7,130,000.00 of its total appropriations of ₱152,414,000.00. They should have allocated ₱7,620,000.00 representing five percent of the total budget of the agency pursuant to Section 31 of 2020 GAA.

PWD and SC Programs, activities and accomplishments



13)	Identified programs and activities intended for senior citizens and persons with disability were not implemented contrary to Section 32 of the GAA of FY 2020.



1)	Section 32 of the 2020 GAA on programs and projects related to SC and PWD states that:



All agencies of the government shall formulate plans, programs and projects intended to address the concerns of senior citizens and persons with disability, insofar as it relates to their mandated functions, and integrate the same in their regular activities.



Moreover, all government infrastructures and facilities shall provide architectural or structural features, designs or facilities that will reasonably enhance the mobility, safety and welfare of the persons with disability pursuant to Batas Pambansa Blg. 344 and R.A No. 7277, as amended.



2)	The Audit Team verified the submitted 2020 Proposed List of Programs of Activities by Management and observed that the approved budget allocated for SC and PWDs for the year 2020 was ₱381,000.00.
