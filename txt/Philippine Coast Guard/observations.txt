A. FINANCIAL AUDIT 
 

Accounting Errors and Improper Accounting Treatment of Transactions 

 

1. Of the total misstatements of P4.230 billion found in audit due to accounting 
errors and improper accounting treatment of transactions that are considered 

departure from the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSASs), 

P4.101 billion have been adjusted, while P129.489 million remained uncorrected 

as at year-end. Hence, based on the material impact of the uncorrected 

misstatements, the reported balances of the affected accounts could not be fully 

relied upon which affect the fairness of the financial statements of PCG as at 

year-end. 

 

1.1 IPSAS 1, paragraph 27 provides that, “Financial statements shall present fairly the 
financial position, financial performance and cash flows of an entity. Fair 

presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other 

events and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for 

assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses set out in IPSASs. The application of IPSASs, 

with additional disclosures when necessary, is presumed to result in financial 

statements that achieve a fair presentation.” 

 

1.2 Management, in its submitted Statement of Management Responsibility, declares that 
it is responsible for faithful representation of the effects of transactions as well as the 

appropriate assertions regarding the recognition, measurement and presentation of 

assets, liabilities, equity, income, expenses and disclosures in accordance with the 

IPSASs. 

 

1.3 Accounting errors and misclassifications aggregating to P4,230,293,696.63 were 
noted in audit of the financial accounts and related transactions of PCG. Of the total 

misstatements, P4,100,804,744.32 were adjusted in the books of accounts, leaving an 

uncorrected total misstatement of P129,488,952.31 (See Annex A).  

 

1.4 The uncorrected misstatements are summarized in Table 1 with details in the 
succeeding paragraphs.

a. Non-recognition of donated Motor Vehicles – P13,515,725.60 
 

1.6 Paragraph 78 of IPSAS 23 states that transfers satisfy the definition of an asset when 
the entity controls the resources as a result of a past event (the transfer) and expects to 

receive future economic benefits or service potential from those resources. Also, 

Section 6.1.f.2 of COA Circular No. 2015-002 dated March 9, 2015 states that for 

PPE controlled but not owned, the entity shall, in accordance to IPSAS 17, recognize 



 

52 
 

the cost and the related accumulated depreciation and impairment loss of existing PPE 

which were not previously recognized due to absence of ownership/title based on 

contract, memorandum of agreements and other reasons. 

 

1.7 Review of the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment 
(RPCPPE) submitted by the Supply Accountable Office (SAO) showed that 11 units 

of Motor Vehicles totaling P13,515,725.60 acquired in various years through 

donations from the Armed Forces and Police Mutual Benefit Association, Inc. 

(AFPMBAI), Department of Transportation (DOTr), Petron Corporation and United 

States of America (USA) remained unrecorded in the books of accounts as of 

December 31, 2020.  Details are as follows:

1.8 The Accounting Services Office (ASO) commented that it did not record the donated 
motor vehicles due to the non-submission of documents by the SAO as basis in the 

recording thereof.  Hence, the Motor Vehicles, Income from Grants and Donations in 

Kind and Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) accounts are understated by P13,515,725.60, 

P3,914,725.60 and P9,601,000.00, respectively. 

 

b. Erroneous account classifications affecting PPE accounts – P111,609,622.26 
 

1.9 Paragraph 14 of IPSAS 17 provides that “The cost of an item of property, plant and 
equipment shall be recognized in the books as an asset if and only if: (a) It is 

probable that the future economic benefits or service potential associated with the 

item will flow to the entity; and (b) the cost or fair value of the item can be measured 

reliably. 

 

1.10 Moreover, Section 10, Chapter 8 of the Government Accounting Manual for National 
Government Agencies (GAM for NGAs) Volume I states that tangible items below 

the capitalization threshold of P15,000.00 shall be accounted as semi-expendable 

property. 

 

1.11 Verification and analysis of the recording of  various items of PPE in the Journal 
Entry Vouchers (JEVs) and General Ledgers (GLs) during the year revealed the 



 

53 
 

following erroneous classification of accounts due to non-observance of the foregoing 

rules and guidelines:

1.12 The failure of the ASO to properly classify the transactions in Table 4 significantly

Net understatement of PPE accounts 111,609,622.26  

 

c. Non-provision of depreciation on Motor Vehicles and Seaport Systems – 
P4,452,795.55 

 

1.13 Paragraph 66 of IPSAS 17 states that the depreciable amount of an asset shall be 
allocated on a systematic basis over its useful life while paragraph 17 thereof provides 

that Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use, i.e. when it is in the 



 

54 
 

location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner 

intended by Management.  

 

1.14 The deficiencies on the affected PPE accounts discussed in the aforementioned 
paragraphs also affected the provision of depreciation from the period the assets 

became available for their intended use, thus, resulted in the understatement of 

Accumulated Depreciation, Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) and Depreciation Expense 

by P4,452,795.55, P1,041,148.93 and P3,411,646.62, respectively. The details are as

1.15 Furthermore, audit of K9 Dogs classified under Work and/or Other Animals account 
amounting to P113,724,743.93 as of December 31, 2020 disclosed that there was no 

depreciation or impairment losses provided to arrive at the true value of the asset, 

contrary to Chapter 3 of the GAM for NGAs Volume III which provides that, “Work 

and/or Other Animals shall be allocated/recognized depreciation or impairment 

losses in case of cost reduction of work/zoo animals to its recoverable amount due to 

impairment”. This resulted in the misstatement of the true value of the asset. This is a 

reiteration of prior year’s finding pointing out the inability of the Management to 

come up with policies and procedures on how to depreciate each K9 Dogs. 

 

1.16 We recommended and Management agreed to require the ASO to prepare 
necessary adjusting entries to correct the misstatements pertaining to 

unrecorded donated Motor Vehicles, erroneous account classifications affecting 

PPE accounts and unrecorded depreciation. 
 



 

55 
 

SUBSISTENCE ALLOWANCE 

 

Misstatement in Subsistence Allowance account – P8,816,400.00 

 

1.17 The Subsistence Allowance account with a year-end balance of P889,419,086.54 was 
understated by P8,816,400.00 due to erroneous accounting treatment of the payments 

of subsistence allowance to PCG officers and employees as office supplies expense.  

 

1.18 As provided in the GAM for NGAs Volume III, Subsistence Allowance account is 
used to recognize the amount granted to authorize government officials/employees to 

cover cost of accommodations, meals and incidental expenses incurred by employees 

who are on official business. 

  

1.19 Furthermore, the Office Supplies Expense account is used to recognize the cost or 
value of office supplies such as bond paper, ink, and small tangible items like staple 

wire remover, puncher, stapler and other similar items issued to end-users for 

government operations. 

  

1.20 In the course of audit of liquidation reports on cash advances, we noted in the Cash 
Disbursements Journals (CDJ) and GL that some liquidations include the grant of 

subsistence allowance which were erroneously recorded as debits to Office Supplies 

Expense account instead of Subsistence Allowance–Uniformed account, thereby 

overstating Office Supplies Expense and understating Subsistence Allowance, both by 

P8,816,400.00. 

 

1.21 We recommended and Management agreed to require the ASO to prepare 
necessary adjusting entries to correct the payment of subsistence allowance to its 

proper classification to ensure fairness of presentation of expenses.  
 

 

Accounting Deficiencies Affecting the Reliability of Account Balances 
 

2. Accounting deficiencies such as unreconciled/unsubstantiated balances due to 
absence or inadequate records and/or schedules/documents affecting some 

accounts to the extent of P5.551 billion were noted. Based on the possible/ 

potential effects of the various accounting deficiencies, the reported balances of 

the affected accounts could not be fully relied upon. 

 

2.1 Section 6, Paragraph (e) Chapter 19 of the GAM for NGAs Volume I on Qualitative 
Characteristics of Financial Reporting states that an entity shall present information 

including accounting policies in a manner that meets reliable information which is 

free from material error and bias, and can be depended on by users to represent 

faithfully that which it purports to represent or could reasonably be expected to 

represent. 

 

2.2 Audit of financial accounts with an aggregate balance of  P15,133,118,490.80 as at 
year-end disclosed accounting deficiencies such as unreconciled/unsubstantiated 



 

56 
 

balances due to absence or inadequate records and/or schedules/ documents requiring 

further analysis, reconciliation, physical count/ verification, coordination and future 

corrective actions as they affect the accuracy and reliability of the reported account 

balances to the extent of P5,551,197,375.39:

2.4 Appendix 6 of the GAM for NGAs Volume II states that the Report on the Physical 
Count of Inventories (RPCI) is a form used to report the physical count of inventory 

items. It further provides that the report shall be reconciled with the Supply Ledger 

Cards and Stock Cards maintained by the Accounting Division/ Unit, and Property 

and Supply Division/Unit, respectively, and any discrepancy shall be verified and/or 

adjusted accordingly. 

 

2.5 Appendix 57 of the GAM for NGAs Volume II states that “the agency shall conduct 
physical count of inventories every semester. The semestral physical inventory of 

supplies shall be reconciled with the SLCs and controlling accounts and Supply 



 

57 
 

and/or Property records. Any discrepancies shall be immediately verified and 

adjusted.” 

 

2.6 Comparison of inventory accounts disclosed that the year-end inventory balances per 
books and the RPCI submitted by the Supply Accountable Office (SAO) had a total 

unreconciled difference of P961,937,483.67, as shown below:

2.7 Verification and inquiry from the ASO disclosed that the discrepancy was largely 
attributed to the non-submission of delivery receipts of items purchased and the non-

preparation of the Requisition and Issue Slips (RIS) by the SAO.  The concerned 

personnel from the ASO commented that most deliveries are received directly by the 

end-users from the Suppliers without notifying and furnishing the ASO of the 

deliveries made and receipts thereof.  Hence, only those issued items reported to ASO 

by the SAO were covered with the Report of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI). 

 

2.8 Further in audit, we noted that there was no regular reconciliation of records between 
the ASO and the SAO which resulted in the considerably large amount of 

unreconciled difference totaling P961,937,483.67. 

 



 

58 
 

2.9 We recommended and Management agreed to require the: (a) SAO to regularly 
submit to ASO copies of delivery receipts of goods and the monthly RSMI 

together with the RIS as the ASO’s bases in recording the delivery and issuances 

of inventory items; and (b) ASO and SAO to periodically reconcile their records 

to ensure correctness of year-end balances of inventory accounts. 
 

b. Non-maintenance of Supply Ledger Cards (SLCs) and/or absence of other 
documents/ reports necessary in the verification of  the year-end Inventories 

account balances 

 

2.10 One control procedure to establish the fair valuation of properties and supplies and 
materials is the reconciliation of the balances per books and per physical count. It is 

through periodic reconciliation that the items need to be adjusted in the books are 

taken up to reflect the correct book balances. 

 

2.11 Audit of the inventory accounts disclosed that the ASO did not maintain complete 
SLCs which is not in keeping with Appendix 57 of the GAM for NGAs Volume II.  

 

2.12 The failure of the ASO to maintain SLCs in recording the receipts and issuances of 
various inventory items and non-reconciliation of SLCs with that of corresponding 

GL accounts and Stock Cards of SAO affected the accuracy, reliability and fair 

presentation of the inventory accounts in the financial statements. 

 

2.13 The Management had commented that ASO maintains SLCs but was not updated 
since the assigned staff is on absent without leave (AWOL) and a new staff was 

assigned. 

 

2.14 We recommended and Management agreed to require the concerned personnel 
of ASO to maintain/update the SLCs and the SAO to update Stock Cards for 

each inventory item received and issued which should be reconciled with the 

SLCs.  
 

c. Unreconciled difference between book and RPCPPE balances on PPE accounts – 
P4,552,938,232.22 

 

2.15 Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs Volume I provides the following accounting 
standards on PPE: 

 

a. Section 20. Deliveries of PPE shall be recorded immediately in the Property Card 
maintained by the Supply and/or Property Division/Unit on the basis of the 

Inspection and Acceptance Report and other supporting documents to be 

forwarded to the Accounting Division/Unit for the recording of deliveries in the 

books of accounts and in the PPE Ledger Card (PPELC). 

 

b. Section 38. The entity shall have a periodic physical count of PPE, which shall be 
done annually and presented on the Report of Physical Count of PPE (RPCPPE) 



 

59 
 

as at December 31 of each year. This shall be submitted to the Auditor concerned 

not later than January 31 of the following year. Equipment found at station and 

losses discovered during the physical count shall be reported to the Accounting 

Division/ Unit for proper accounting/ recording.” 

 

c. Section 42. The PPELC shall be kept and maintained by the Accounting Office/ 
Unit, while the Property Card (PC) shall be kept for each class of PPE by the 

Supply and/or Property Division/ Unit. 

 

2.16 Comparison of the year-end book balances of various PPE items and the RPCPPE 
balances revealed differences in the total amount of P4,552,938,232.22. Failure to 

account the difference or to reconcile the accounting and property records with the 

RPCPPE defeated the purpose thereof to support validity of PPEs’ existence and their 

accurate book balances. Verification revealed that the non-reconciliation was 

attributed to incomplete/un-updated PPELCs maintained by ASO and PCs of SAO. 

Thus, the following unreconciled and unaccounted differences render the PPE balance 

in the financial statements inaccurate and unreliable:

d. Long outstanding and dormant payables aged more than two years in 
Guaranty/Security Deposits Payable – P15,664,798.79 

 

2.18. Long outstanding and dormant payables to various creditors, aged more than two (2) 
years and recorded under Guaranty/Security Deposits Payable account totaling  

P15,664,798.79 were not reverted to the Accumulated Surplus or Deficit of the 

General Fund of the Government pursuant to Executive Order  (EO) No. 87 dated  

August 13, 2019, thereby affecting the fairness of presentation of the year-end 

account balance of Guaranty/Security Deposits Payable. 

 

2.19. Section 1 of EO No. 87 s. 2019 states that all documented accounts payable for fiscal 
year 2016 and years prior thereto shall be reverted to the Accumulated Surplus or 

Deficit of the General Fund, or the Cumulative Result of Operations of the National 

Government. Henceforth, all documented accounts payable which remained 

outstanding for at least two years, for which no actual administrative or judicial claim 

has been filed, shall be subject to automatic reversion. 

 

2.20. Section 2 of EO No. 87 also states that all accounts payable which are undocumented 
or not covered by perfected contracts on record, regardless of the year in which they 

were incurred, shall automatically be reverted. The recording of undocumented 

accounts payable in the books of accounts of agencies shall be strictly prohibited. 

 

2.21. Guaranty/Security Deposits Payable account balance of P70,417,920.68 as of 
December 31, 2020 is composed of unreleased 10 percent retention from billings of 

the contractor and unrefunded performance/security/warranty bonds posted by 

bidders/ contractors.  
 

2.22. Audit of the subsidiary ledger balances of the account disclosed existence of the 
following long outstanding and dormant payables to various creditors as of December 

31, 2020 aged  more than two (2) years in the total amount of P15,664,798.79 which 
were not reverted to Accumulated Surplus or Deficit of the General Fund  pursuant to

2.23. It should be noted that the performance bonds were backed-up by cash which were 
deposited with the BTr under Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, Trust account.  

Likewise, considering that the purposes for which the bonds were posted were already 

served due to the completion/delivery and acceptance of the projects, the said bonds 

should have already been refunded to contractors.  

 

2.24. Absence of filed claims of PCG contractors/creditors and the refund of the bonds 
posted by the bidders/contractors within the prescribed time resulted in the 



 

62 
 

accumulation of outstanding liabilities that should have been reverted to the 

Accumulated Surplus or Deficit of the General Fund pursuant to EO No. 87. 

Moreover, the long overdue accounts of more than two (2) years in the total amount 

of P15,664,798.79 casts doubts on their validity and reliability, thereby affecting the 

year-end balances and the fairness of presentation of the account Guaranty/Security 

Deposits Payable.  
 

2.25. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to revert 
the dormant payables aged more than two (2) years to the Accumulated Surplus 

or Deficit of the General Fund of the Government in consonance with EO No. 87.  

 

2.26. The Management commented that the accumulation of Guaranty/Security Deposits 
Payable in the books of accounts was due to lack of time to assess and evaluate the 

validity of the accounts. The ASO will pursue with its scheduled task properly and 

submit JEV for the necessary adjustments and reversions, or copies of DV/LDDAP 

for the refunded securities, if there are any. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

2.27. The Audit Team would like to emphasize the directives of Sections 1 and 2 of EO No. 
87 on the automatic reversion of all outstanding accounts payable without filed 

claims. As remedy of the creditors, Section 3 thereof provides that in the event that 

reverted accounts payable are subsequently validated by competent authorities or by 

final and executory decisions, the funding therefor shall be determined by the 

Department of Budget and Management (DBM) subject to the applicable laws, rules 

and regulations.   

 

e. Unaccounted prior year’s balance of Due to BIR account – P17,901,733.21 

 

2.28. The Due to BIR account with a year-end balance of P71,582,741.17 was unreliable 
due to an unaccounted  balance of P17,901,733.21.  

 

2.29. Due to BIR refers to the unremitted taxes withheld from employees and suppliers. 
Taxes withheld from the salaries and benefits of the uniformed/civilian employees 

and payments of purchases on infrastructure, goods and services from suppliers and 

contractors including VAT amounted to P521,457,009.29 inclusive of the balance 

from prior years, of which the amount of P449,874,268.12 was remitted to the Bureau 

of Internal Revenue during the year. The amount of P53,681,007.96 was subsequently 

remitted on January 11, 2021, leaving a balance of P17,901,733.21, which is still 

subject to review, analysis, adjustment and remittance, if warranted. Further 

verification disclosed that the amount pertains to the unaccounted prior years’ 

transactions that was forwarded as beginning balance in the current year, which 

affects the reliability of the year-end balance of the Due to BIR account. 

 

2.30. We recommended  and Management agreed to conduct further review and  
analysis of  the prior years’ unaccounted amount of P17,901,733.21 and remit 



 

63 
 

whatever amount is due to the BIR and/or make the necessary adjustments 

thereof. 
 

f. Direct treatment as expenses of the regular purchases of office supplies and other 
supplies and materials instead of Inventories accounts – P2,755,127.50 

 

2.31 Section 9, Chapter 8 of the GAM for NGAs Volume I prescribes the use of Perpetual 
Inventory Method wherein the regular purchases shall be coursed through the 

inventory account and issues thereof shall be recorded as they take place except for 

supplies and materials purchased out of the Petty Cash Fund (PCF) for immediate use 

or on emergency cases which shall be charged directly to the appropriate expense 

accounts. 

 

2.32 Purchases of office supplies and other supplies and materials by Coast Guard District 
Southern Tagalog (CGDSTL) in the amount of P182,800.00 and P2,572,327.50, 

respectively, were not recorded using the inventory accounts but instead treated as 

outright expenses, thus, the inventory account balances could not be accurately and 

reliably established at any given time. 

 

2.33 The Management commented that it instructed the District Accountant to strictly 
observe the regulations in the proper recording of inventories. 

 

2.34 We recommended and Management agreed to:  
 

a. strictly observe the regulatory requirement on the proper management 
of Supplies Inventory; and 

 

b. henceforth, ensure that all regular purchases of supplies are recorded 
and accounted for using the Perpetual Inventory Method to establish the 

balance of inventory on hand at any given time. 

 

 

B. COMPLIANCE AUDIT 
 

Utilization of Budget/Allotments and Cash Allocations 

 

3. Of the total allotments of P15.609 billion received by PCG in CY 2020, P15.551 
billion or 99.63 percent thereof was obligated, leaving an unobligated balance of 

P57.951 million as at year-end. However, PCG had incurred obligations in excess 

of allotments for Personal Services (PS) of P450.650 million due to the hiring of 

additional manpower with no corresponding additional allotments, which is not 

in accordance with Book VI, Chapter 5, Section 41 of EO No. 292.  Moreover, 

actual disbursements amounted only to P13.125 billion or 84.40 percent of the 

obligated allotments due to delayed project implementation, late delivery of 

procured items and slow processing of payments. 

 



 

64 
 

a. Utilization of Budget/Allotments 

 

3.1. Section 60 of the General Provisions of Republic Act (RA) No. 11465 or the General 
Appropriations Act (GAA) of FY 2020 provides that, “all appropriations authorized 

under FY 2020 GAA, including budgetary support to GOCCs and SAGF, shall be 

available for release and disbursement for the purpose specified, and under the same 

General and Special Provisions of said GAA applicable thereto until December 31, 

2020. All unreleased appropriations or unexpended or undisbursed funds shall revert 

to the unappropriated Surplus of the General Fund.”. 
 

3.2. Section 70 thereof also provides that “as a general rule, departments, bureaus and 
offices of the national government xxx shall spend what is programmed in their 

respective appropriations in this Act.” 
 

3.3. On the other hand, DBM Circular Letter No. 2008-11 provides the guidelines in the 
release of the Notice of Cash Allocation (NCA) while DBM Circular Letter No. 2020-

1 dated January 2, 2020, was issued “to ensure the timely implementation of 

programs and projects, disbursement authorization documents are issued to make 

cash available within the scheduled program/activity/project implementation period 

as reflected in the corresponding DBM-evaluated Monthly Disbursement Programs 

submitted by agencies.”  
 

3.4. Review of PCG’s allotments, obligations, disbursements and balances as of December 
31, 2020, as reported in PCG’s Budget and Financial Accountability Reports, 

(BFARs) showed that the total funds received for current and continuing 

appropriation was P15,609,354,973.93. Of this amount, P15,551,403,876.88 or 99.63 

percent was obligated, leaving an unobligated allotment of P57,951,097.05 or 0.37 

percent as at year-end. Of the allotments released for continuing appropriations of 

P1,272,189,514.93, the amount of P199,367,409.46 was reverted to the 

unappropriated surplus of the General Fund. Breakdown are presented as follows:

**The computation of 99.63% includes the obligations in excess of allotments for PS of P450,649,573.92. 

 

3.5. Shown differently, the bar graph below viewed the graphical representation of the 
PCG’s budget utilization in CY 2020. 

 

 
 

3.6. Table 12 shows that PCG had incurred obligations in excess of allotments for PS of 
P450,649,573.92, which is contrary to Book VI, Chapter 5, Section 41 of EO No. 292 

and reiterated under Section 38, Chapter 2 of the GAM for NGAs Volume I, which 

read as follows: 

 

“Heads of departments, bureaus, offices and agencies shall not incur nor authorize 

the incurrence of expenditures or obligations in excess of allotments released by the 

DBM Secretary for their respective departments, offices and agencies. Parties 

responsible for the incurrence of overdrafts shall be held personally liable therefor.” 

 

3.7. It was noted that the overdraft in PS amounting to P450,649,573.92 resulted from the 
hiring of additional 1,785 PCG personnel as of December 31, 2020. Of this number, 

1,500 was approved by DBM on May 8, 2020. The PCG, in its letter to the DBM, had 

requested for additional allotment and cash allocation for Personnel Services of 

P603,100,656.19 to cover the mandatory salaries and allowances of the newly 



 

66 
 

recruited uniformed and non-uniformed personnel.  However, the DBM had not 

responded to the PCG’s request as of audit report date.  

 

3.8. Notwithstanding the considerably high obligation rate of PCG of 99.63 percent as 
shown in Table 12 which yielded an overdraft in obligation of P450,649,573.92 

pertaining to the payments of unfunded Personal Services, the computed 

disbursement rate or the absorptive capacity was only at 84.40 percent. Further, it is 

noteworthy that there was zero disbursement for Capital Outlay (CO) in the current 

year and only a minimal amount of P22,869,830.00 or 3.06 percent was disbursed out 

of  the obligated allotments for continuing appropriations.  

 

3.9. As claimed by the PCG Management, the obligation and disbursement rates were 
affected by the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic which slowed down 

their project implementation and the speedy processing of transactions because of the 

adoption of the Alternative Work Arrangement or the Work from Home Scheme 

among personnel. In addition, funds for the current year and continuing 

appropriations were re-aligned to give way to COVID-19 related expenditures, as 

authorized under (Republic Act) RA No. 11469 (Bayanihan to Heal as One Act) and 

RA No. 11494 (Bayanihan to Recover as One Act).   

 

b. Utilization of NCAs 
 

3.10. The PCG was able to maximize the utilization of its NCAs because of the 
accommodation of payments of the overdraft in allotment for PS which has no 

corresponding NCAs. Out of the P14,330,011,000.20 NCAs and Tax Remittance 

Advices (TRAs) received by PCG for CY 2020, the amount of P14,248,824,826.68 

was utilized while P81,186,173.52 was unutilized as at year-end and was reverted to 

the unappropriated Surplus of the General Fund. These are as follows:

3.11. We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 

a. follow-up from DBM the release of funds to cover the overdraft in the 
obligation of Personal Services; and 

 

b. consider other approaches, ways and strategies to ensure the optimum 
utilization of its budget such as adequate planning and monitoring of the 



 

67 
 

Agency’s programs and projects and the timely execution of all planned 

activities despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. 

 

3.12. Management commented that: (a) it had requested an additional SARO and 
corresponding NCA of P603,100,656.19 and the DBM had replied on December 21, 

2020 that it would act on the said request on the first working day of FY 2021. 

However, no appropriate action was made by the DBM as of date, thus, a follow up 

letter-request was made on April 20, 2021; (b) the unbooked obligations for PS are 

authorized under Budget Circular No. 583 dated January 4, 2021; (c) the decrease in 

actual disbursements to 84.40 percent was caused by economic and social disruption 

due to pandemic which affected the transportation, service and deliveries due to 

localized lockdowns; and likewise, processing of payments is dependent on the 

submission of complete documentary requirements; and (d) prospectively, in order to 

ensure timely implementation of procurement process and standardize the project 

management within the PCG, the Command will prepare and issue Procurement 

handbook Manual to standardize all PCG related procurements, and likewise, the CG-

6 recommends creation of a Project Management Office (PMO).  The Management is 

also committed to adhere to Section 7.6 of the 2016 Revised Implementing Rules and 

Regulations (RIRR) of RA No. 9184. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

3.13. Under DBM Budget Circular No. 578 dated January 06, 2020, the unobligated PS, 
may be charged against the current year’s allotment.  However, with the huge amount 

of overdraft totaling P450,649,573.92, it can deplete substantially the PS allotment for 

the current year if applied thereat.  The SARO for the unobligated PS is necessary to 

cover the overdraft in allotment, otherwise, the possibility of overdraft at year end 

2021 is highly probable. Thus, we maintain the Audit Team’s position for PCG to 

follow up from DBM the release of the SARO to cover the overdraft in PS of 

P450,649,573.92. 

 

 

Uncollected excess of fund transfers to Procurement Service – P2,675,200.00 

 

4. The PCG did not demand for the refund of the excess funds of P2.675 million 
from the fund transfers to Procurement Service (PS)-DBM for the procurement 

of light to medium-weight multi-purpose Twin Engine Helicopters, contrary to 

Section 4.9 of COA Circular No. 94-013. The excess funds could have been 

remitted to the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) to fund other programs and 

projects of the government. 

 

4.1 Section 4.9 of COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994 states that,   
“the IA shall return to the SA any unused balance upon completion of the project”, 

which in turn be remitted  to the account of the Bureau of the Treasury pursuant to 

Section 10 of the General Provisions of 2020 General Appropriations Act which 

provides that, 



 

68 
 

 

“Departments, bureaus, offices, and instrumentalities of the National Government, 

including Constitutional Offices enjoying fiscal autonomy and SUCs are mandated to 

close and revert all balances of Special accounts, Fiduciary or Trust Funds, and 

Revolving Funds to the General Fund in any of the following instances: (i) when there 

is no legal basis for its creation; (ii) when their terms have expired; or (iii) when they 

are no longer necessary for the attainment of the purpose for which said funds were 

established”.  

 

4.2 Post-audit of Disbursement Voucher (DV) No. 18-06-3791 dated June 5, 2018 and 
LDDAP-ADA No. 2018-07-1161 dated July 2, 2018 showed that out of the fund 

transfer to the PS-DBM of P777,600,000.00 for the procurement of light to medium- 

weight multi-purpose Twin Engine Helicopter, the PS-DBM was able to deliver the  

item on July 30, 2020 per Delivery Receipt (DR) No. M20-004901-NCSE for the 

amount of P774,924,800.00. The PCG’s acceptance of the delivered helicopter 

subsequently recognized on December 29, 2020 the aircraft in the books of accounts 

as debit to Aircraft and Aircraft Grounds Equipment and credit to Due from NGAs-

PS-DBM, both by the same amount of P774,924,800.00. 

 

4.3 Further in audit, we noted that out of the fund transfer and the actual cost of the 
procured aircraft, the excess thereof amounting to P2,675,200.00 has remained with 

the PS-DBM  as at year-end which should have been refunded to the PCG pursuant to 

Section 4.9 of COA Circular No. 94-01. The amount could have been remitted to the 

Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) to fund other programs and projects of the government. 

  

4.4 We recommended and Management agreed to issue a demand letter requiring 

the PS-DBM the refund of the excess/unutilized balance of P2.675 million from 

fund transfers and thereafter deposit the same to the BTr.  
 

 

Overpayment of salaries and various allowances – P1,716,286.67 

 

5. The overpayment of salaries and various allowances of PCG officers and 

employees which have accrued to P1.716 million remained uncollected as of 

December 31, 2020, contrary to COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 

2012. 

 

5.1 COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012 provides the guidelines in the 
prevention of irregular unnecessary, excessive, extravagance, or unconscionable 

(IUEEU) expenditures which defines - 

 

“Excessive Expenditures are expenditures which signifies unreasonable expense or 

expenses incurred at an immoderate quantity and exorbitant price.  It also includes 

expenses which exceed what is usual or proper, as well as expenses which are 

unreasonably high and beyond just measure or amount.  They also include expenses 

in excess of reasonable limits.” 



 

69 
 

5.2 Audit of Due from Officers and Employees account revealed that the overpayment of 
salaries and allowances to 136 PCG officers and employees amounting to 

P1,716,286.67 was due to the advance preparation of payroll for salaries and 

allowances for  1 to 2 weeks, late report of personnel on AWOL cases, late report of 

actual entitlement of collateral pay and delayed reporting of absences without pay.  

This is a recurring issue and a serious concern which the PCG Management was not 

able to address. As a result, overpayment in salaries amounting to at least 

P1,716,286.67 remained uncollected as of date, as summarized in Table 14:

5.4 Moreover, Management has not initiated collection efforts to refund overpayments 
amounting to P740,672.77 of 61 former PCG officers and employees who have either 

resigned or on AWOL status, which could result in the loss of government funds.   

 

5.5 The Centralized Payroll Management Unit (CPMU), in-charge in the preparation of 
payrolls, failed to collect/recover the overpayments through payroll deduction from 

concerned officers and employees, resulting in accumulation of receivables.  

 

5.6 The overpayment of salaries and allowances can also be attributed to the failure of the 
ASO to conduct regular reconciliation, analysis and monitoring of the individual 

subsidiary ledger accounts of the Due from Officers and Employees account, to 

ensure that overpayments are collected/refunded thru payroll deduction.   

 

5.7 If Management will not intensify its efforts to recover the overpayment in salaries and 
allowances of active and retired/resigned PCG personnel including those on AWOL, 

the Audit Team will be constrained to disallow the payments pursuant to COA 

Circular No. 2012-003.  

 



 

70 
 

5.8 We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 

a. require the CPMU to institute control measures to avoid overpayment of 
salaries and allowances; 

 

b. ensure that any overpayment is deducted immediately from the payrolls of 
concerned officers and employees who are still in the active service; 

otherwise, Notices of Disallowance will be issued; and  

 

c. issue Demand Letters to those who are not anymore in the service to refund 
their overpayments. 

 

5.9 The Management commented that the CPMU had been continuously deducting the 
overpayment made to the concerned personnel from their payroll accounts. Likewise, 

Collateral Pay are being prepared separately from regular payroll beginning February 

2021 to avoid overpayments, and Demand Letters dated February 26, 2021 had been 

sent to retired/resigned PCG personnel to refund immediately their outstanding 

balances. 

 

 

Unliquidated Cash Advances to Special Disbursing Officers – P23,969,000.00 

 

6. Cash advances to Special Disbursing Officers (SDOs) totaling P23.969 million 
remained unliquidated as at year-end despite completion of the related activities 

for which the cash advances were granted, contrary to Section 1.2 of COA 

Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012. 

 

6.1 Section 1.2 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 provides that, “Cash advances for special 
purpose should be liquidated as soon as the purpose of such has been served.” 

 

6.2 Audit of the cash advances granted to 15 SDOs with a total amount of 
P23,969,000.00 remained unliquidated for 72 days to one (1) year and 37 days as of 

December 31, 2020 despite having served the identified projects/purposes below for

6.3 It bears emphasis that the cash advances granted to two (2) SDOs remained 
unliquidated for more than a year despite the letter of the former Acting Chief 

Accountant of ASO dated November 19, 2020 on the withholding of their salaries 

until the said cash advances are liquidated. Correspondingly, Notices of Suspension 

Nos. 2021-001 and 2021-002, both dated February 18, 2021, were issued by the Audit 

Team. 

 

6.4 We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Accounting Service 
Office to: 

 

a. require the SDOs concerned to immediately liquidate/refund their cash 
advances totaling P23.969 million; and 

 

b. henceforth, strictly comply with  the laws, rules and regulations on the  
grant and liquidation of cash advances pursuant to COA Circular No. 2012-

001. 

 

6.5 Management commented that liquidations were already made in the 1st quarter of CY 
2021, except for one (1) SDO who was recommended for the withholding of his 

salary. Likewise, it had initiated the crafting of the revised Standard Operating 

Procedures to consolidate and harmonize all issuances, rules and regulations, policies 

and directives pertaining to the Cash Advances System in the PCG on February 17, 

2021 pending review and approval.  Moreover, it will conduct orientation webinar to 

be participated in by all PCFCs/SDOs. 

 

 

Loss on Foreign Exchange – P71,980,539.98 

 

7. The PCG’s lack of immediate action in the cancellation/termination of expired 
Letters of Credits (LCs) placed with the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) for 

the procurement of military weapons and weapon stations from foreign suppliers 

resulted in delayed refund thereof to PCG, thereby incurring opportunity loss to 



 

72 
 

the Agency in the form of foreign exchange devaluation and penalty charges 

totaling to P71.980 million.  

 

7.1 Section 2 of PD No. 1445, provides that, “It is the declared policy of the State that all 
resources of the government shall be managed, expended or utilized in accordance 

with the law and regulations, and safeguarded against loss or wastage through illegal 

or improper disposition, with in a view to ensuring efficiency, economy and 

effectiveness in the operations of government.  The responsibility to take care that 

such policy is faithfully adhered to rests directly with the chief or head of the 

government agency concerned”. 

 

7.2 As defined in the GAM for NGAs Volume III, Deposits on Letters of Credits account 
is used to recognize the amount paid by the agency to the bank for opening letters of 

credit.  This account is credited for delivery of goods purchased. 

 

7.3 The account, Deposits on Letters of Credit represents PCG’s deposits on letters of 
credits maintained with the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) for payment of 

various purchases to foreign suppliers/creditors.  All of the LCs are with validity 

period, and payments to Suppliers are charged thereat. The payment to foreign 

suppliers should be made within the validity period, otherwise, the LCs are cancelled 

immediately, and the outstanding balance of which is refunded to PCG upon the 

latter’s request. Charges to the LC account is made by the LBP upon the submission 

of an approved Order of Payment by the Head of PCG, supported with other required 

supporting documents in favor of the Supplier/Contractor. 

 

7.4 The PCG had applied with the LBP, South Harbor Branch for the opening of an 
account for Deposits on Letters of Credit in the total of P1,707,613,395.73 in 

February and April 2019 for the eventual payments of deliveries on various military 

supplies and equipment and twin engine helicopter procured from foreign suppliers, 

as contained in the contracts between PCG and various foreign suppliers. As of 

December 31, 2020, said account has an outstanding balance of P745,514,803.24. 
 

7.5 Audit of the account disclosed that the LBP charged the PCG for foreign exchange 
adjustments/losses and penalties in the total amount of P71,980,539.98 for the 

transactions shown as follows:

7.6 Audit revealed that the LC Nos. 1HO020419 and 1HO280219 in the amount of 
P961,758,698.32 for the procurement of supply and delivery of weapons and supply 

and delivery of remote control weapon stations, respectively, had expired on April 26, 

2020 and May 23, 2020, with a total outstanding balance of P817,495,269.83.  The 

amounts of the LCs were supposedly for the payments to foreign suppliers upon full 

deliveries of procured items and upon presentation of an Order of Payment issued by 

PCG. However, payments to foreign suppliers did not push through before the expiry 

of the LCs because of several issues on documentary requirements and compliance 

with technical specifications per contract as reported by Management. 

  

7.7 It bears to note that the expired LCs amounting to P133,720,197.70 and 
P611,794,532.15 were only requested by PCG for closure and eventual remittance to 

the BTr on  January 7 and 27, 2021, respectively, or 7 and 9 months after their expiry 

dates.  

 

7.8 The Credit Memos involving the remittances by LBP to the BTr did not indicate any 
details/computation but only the net proceeds of the LCs. We requested Management 

to give the Audit Team the details/computation of the net proceeds indicated in the 

Credit Memos. The Management acted on the request by writing a letter dated April 

21, 2021 to LBP requesting the information. The details/computation of the net 

proceeds of the LCs was provided by LBP dated April 30, 2021, as follows:

7.9 We wish to point out that the contracts for the abovementioned projects were 
executed in the early part of CY 2018. Had Management acted with dispatch in 

resolving various issues and glitches and that payment/s were made on time to the two 

(2) suppliers through the respective deposits on LCs; or, if payments to the foreign 

suppliers are not possible due to some valid reasons, the Management could have 

requested immediate closure of the expired LCs and deposit the proceeds to the BTr; 

thus, any possible losses in foreign exchange and penalties could have been avoided. 
 

7.10 Management had explained that the unprecedented onset of COVID-19 pandemic is 
the primary factor for the unintentional delay in the acquisition of projects charged to 

the LCs. With the implementation of the nationwide lockdown and travel restrictions, 

majority of the transactions were put on hold.  These eventually became the reasons 

for the unwanted delay in payment. The Management reiterates that under no 

circumstances that the causes of delay was intentional nor it is with malice but rather 

caused by fortuitous events beyond control. Per LBP policy, all foreign LC 

cancellations, the prevailing Forex rate of the day is to be used when the LC will be 

returned back to the BTr, thus, resulted in huge amount of forex losses and penalties.   
 

7.11 We recommended and Management agreed to require the officials concerned to: 
 

a. strengthen monitoring and act with prudence on similar contracts in the 
future vis-à-vis with the LC and the immediate cancellation thereof in case 

of termination/cancellation of LCs; and 

 

b. conduct a proper, meticulous, judicious, prudence and economical 
procurement activity to prevent incurrence of unnecessary expenditures for 

good governance on procurement activities. 

 

 

Undelivered goods, services and infrastructure projects on fund transfers to other 

government agencies – P579,199,451.14 

 

8. Various procurement through fund transfers to the Philippine International 
Trading Corporation (PITC) and Zamboanga Economic Zone Authority 

(Zambo Ecozone) in total amount of P349.674 million for the delivery of goods, 

services and infrastructure projects remained undelivered/ unliquidated for 

more than one to three years as of December 31, 2020, contrary to COA Circular 

No. 94-013 dated December 3, 1994, thus, depriving the PCG end-users of the 

benefits that would be derived from the use of these assets.  

 

8.1 Section 53.5 of the RIRR of RA No. 9184 provides the rules on Agency-to-Agency 
procurement of goods, infrastructure projects and consulting services from another 

Agency of the Government of the Philippines (GoP). 

 

8.2 COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 3, 1994 provides for the Rules and 
Regulations in the Grant, Utilization and Liquidation of Funds Transferred to IAs. 

Section 4.6 of the Circular prescribes that within ten (10) days after the end of each 



 

75 
 

month/end of the agreed period for the Project, the IA shall submit the Report of 

Checks Issued (RCI) and the Report of Disbursement (RD) to report the utilization of 

the funds, while Section 4.9 requires that the Implementing Agency shall return to the 

Source Agency any unused balance upon completion of the project. 

 

8.3 The PCG, in partnership with the Philippine International Trading Corporation 
(PITC) and Zamboanga Economic Zone Authority (Zambo Ecozone), has entered into 

the following Memorandum of Agreements (MOA) to facilitate procurement of 

PCG’s numerous infrastructure, goods and services requirements: 

 

a. PCG through MOA with PITC dated May 10, 2017 has commissioned and 
engaged the PITC as the supplier of the Agency’s goods and services 

requirements, for and in consideration of applicable service fees and contract 

prices for goods and services to be procured through/from the latter.  Related 

thereto, fund transfers were made by PCG to PITC for the procurement of various 

goods and services. Upon completion of each procurement project, PITC shall 

submit to PCG a Liquidation Report, together with required documents, and 

return to PCG the unexpended balance of funds transferred and/or deposited in the 

MOA account for that particular project including any and all income earned.  

 

b. PCG through MOA with Zamboanga Economic Zone Authority (Zambo 
Ecozone) dated December 20, 2018 was executed for the Zambo Ecozone to 

undertake design and build for the construction of Coast Guard District South 

Western Mindanao (CGDSWM) complex inside Zamboanga Ecozone’s First and 

Second Industrial Parks to be occupied by PCG by virtue of the Deed of Usufruct 

on a 1.4 hectare seafront area. One of the salient features of the MOA, among 

others, is to comply with the rules and regulations embodied under COA Circular 

No. 94-013, Item 3 of Circular No. 2012-001 and COA Circular 2016-002 dated 

December 13, 1994, June 14, 2012, and May 31,2016, respectively for the receipt, 

utilization, documentation, disbursement and liquidation of money / cash transfer. 

 

8.4 Audit disclosed that a total of P349,674,794.80 of fund transfers to PITC and Zambo 
Ecozone for the acquisition/implementation of 16 projects remained undelivered and 

unliquidated as of December 31, 2020, 14 of which pertain to fund transfers to PITC 

aging more than three years.  Details of the projects are presented as follows:

8.5 It was noted that the PCG Management was not able to regularly coordinate with the 
implementing government agencies to monitor the status of the acquisition/delivery of 

the goods and services or implementation of the projects on the transferred funds 

which are considered long overdue considering the non-liquidation of transferred 

funds to as late as more than three years.  

 

8.6 It is emphasized that the responsibility to monitor the implementation/delivery of the 
projects and follow-ups with implementing agencies on the submission of required 

reports pursuant to COA Circular No. 94-013, rests with the PCG Management. Thus, 

non-delivery of these goods/services/projects, deprived the end-users of the benefits 

that would be derived from the use of these assets. 

 

8.7 We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 

a. demand from the Implementing Agencies the immediate delivery of goods, 
services and implementation of infrastructure projects, otherwise, require 

the refund of the unutilized funds for PCG’s subsequent remittance to the 

BTr;  

 

b. henceforth, MOAs for the fund transfer and delivery of infrastructure, 
goods and services should consider, among others, provisions for the 

delivery period and fines and penalties in case of breach, late or non-

delivery; and 

 

c. strictly enforce the guidelines in monitoring the liquidation of fund transfers 
pursuant to COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 3, 1994.

Delayed Implementation/Completion of Projects - P1,358,854,921.64 

 

9. Eighty-nine projects amounting to P1.359 billion, which remained not 
implemented and not completed since CY 2014 to CY 2020, were not terminated, 

and the contractors thereof were not considered blacklisted nor imposed with 

liquidated damages for the delays incurred, contrary to Annexes E and I of the 

RIRR of RA No. 9184.  Likewise, contractors in 14 projects were granted 

advance payments of P8.580 million which remained unrecovered by PCG.  

Thus, the public is deprived of the benefits that could have been derived from 

the immediate and maximum use of the intended projects and could lead to loss 

and wastage of government funds.  

 

9.1 Section 8.1, Annex E of RIRR of RA No. 9184 states that:  
 

“Where the contractor refuses or fails to satisfactorily complete the work within the 

specified contract time, plus any time extension duly granted and is hereby in default 

under the contract, the contractor shall pay the procuring entity for liquidated 

damages, not by way of penalty, an amount, equal to one tenth (1/10) of one (1) 

percent of the cost of the unperformed portion of the works for every day of delay”.  

 

9.2 Section A.2, Item III of Annex “I” of the RIRR of RA No. 9184 provides that: 
 

“The Procuring Entity shall terminate a contract for default when any of the 

following conditions attend its implementation: 

 

a) Due to the Contractor’s fault and while the project is on-going, it has incurred 
negative slippage of fifteen percent (15%) or more in accordance with 

Presidential Decree 1870; 

 

b) Due to the Contractor’s fault and after the contract time has expired, it has 
incurred a negative slippage of ten percent (10%) or more in the completion of 

the work;  

 

c) The Contractor (i) abandons the contract works, refuses or fails to comply with a 
valid instruction of the Procuring Entity or fails to proceed expeditiously and 

without delay despite a written notice by the Procuring Entity; (ii) does not 

actually have on the project site the minimum essential equipment listed on the 

Bid necessary to prosecute the Works in accordance with the approved work plan 

and equipment deployment schedule as required for the project; (iii) does not 

execute the works in accordance with the contract or persistently or flagrantly 

neglects to carry out its obligations under the contract; (iv) neglects or refuses to 

remove materials or to perform a new work that has been rejected as defective or 

unsuitable; or (v) sub-lets any part of the contract works without approval by the 

Procuring Entity.” 

 



 

78 
 

9.3 Review and validation of the Consolidated Quarterly Report of Government 
Projects/Programs/Activities (RGPPA) as of December 31 2020 disclosed that 89 

projects of the PCG with a total cost of P1,358,854,921.64 which were supposed to be 

implemented from CY 2014 to CY 2020 remained unimplemented as at year-end but 

projects were not terminated, contractors were not blacklisted and liquidated damages 

were not imposed despite non-completion and considerable delays in implementation.

9.4 Further review revealed that 29 infrastructure projects with aggregate contract cost of 
P560,844,812.18 remained uncompleted or are still on going  as at year-end despite 

their target completion period on CY 2014 up to CY 2020. As reported by 

Management, these 29 projects which were supposed to have already been completed 

have accomplishment rates ranging only from 7.72 percent to 95.61 percent. If not 

fully completed, it will result in wastage of government resources. Details of these are 

shown in Table 20:

9.7 The Management, instead of penalizing or blacklisting the contractor for the non-
completion of the projects, awarded more projects to said contractor for 

implementation, posing more risks in loss of government resources.  

 

9.8 Likewise, as shown in Table 20, of the 60 projects that were unimplemented, 
contractors in 14 projects were granted advances equivalent to 15 percent of the 



 

82 
 

contract cost for mobilization fee with an aggregate amount of P8,579,592.47 but 

which remained unrecovered as at year-end, contrary to Appendix E, item 4.3 of the 

2016 RIRR of RA No. 9184  which provides that, 

 
“The advance payment shall be repaid by the contractor by deducting fifteen 

percent (15%) from his periodic progress payments a percentage  equal to 

the percentage of the total contract price used for the advance payment”.  

 

9.9 There being no periodic progress payments from where to recoup the 15 percent 
advances, Management should have taken legal steps to recover said advances.  

Alternatively, when it was established that the winning bidder was in default in his 

obligations under the contract, PCG Management should have immediately forfeited 

the posted performance security in whatever form pursuant to Section 39.3, Rule XI 

of the 2016 RIRR of RA No. 9184. 

 

9.10 The failure to terminate, blacklist the erring contractors, impose liquidated damages 
and recover the advance payments from contractors due to lack of adequate control 

mechanisms in project monitoring, deprived the public of the benefits that could have 

been derived from the immediate and maximum use of the said projects and could 

lead to loss and wastage of government funds. 

 

9.11 It bears to note that the Audit Team has drawn the attention of Management on this 
observation in prior year’s audit and the same was the subject of several Audit 

Observation Memoranda and audit reports in the past but no final action has yet been 

taken by Management to address such observation.  Lest Management take legal steps 

to recover the advances to contractors, the Audit Team will be constrained to issue a 

Notice of Disallowance. 

 

9.12 We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 

a. terminate contracts/projects which are already long overdue, and institute 
blacklisting processes to erring contractors;  

 

b. submit the PCG’s way forward/action plan on the uncompleted/idle projects 
with the timelines on the full implementation thereof to avoid wastage of 

government resources. If full implementation is no longer practicable, 

institute legal steps against erring contractors; 

 

c. impose liquidated damages for delays in project completion;  
 

d. take legal steps to recover the advances granted  to contractors with 
unimplemented projects, else, a Notice of Disallowance will be issued; and 

 

e. closely monitor implementation and delivery of all PCG projects within the 
timelines set forth in the contracts.  

 



 

83 
 

9.13 Management commented that: (a) the Contract Termination & Review Committee 
had the following action plan: (i) it will take legal steps to recover/ demand refunds of 

the 15 percent down payments from erring contractors; (ii) terminate contracts, 

imposition of LD and blacklisting to RM Mondares, JFJ Construction, FPN 

Construction and CMO Construction; and (iii) re-evaluate the percentage of 

completion of all the concerned projects; (b) it had explained the  reasons for non-

completion of the projects and conducted investigation for non-completion of the 

projects; and (c) the projects with 15 percent unrecouped advance payments and other 

unfinished projects were recommended for contract termination. 

 

 

Non-submission of contracts, purchase orders, work orders 

 

10. Contracts, purchase orders and work orders for the procurement of 

infrastructures, goods and services with an aggregate amount of P487.979 

million were not submitted to the Audit Team contrary to COA Circular No. 

2009-001 dated February 12, 2009; thus, affecting the timely and effective review 

of contracts and rendition of relevant audit results.   

 

10.1 Section 3.1.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009 requires that 
within five days from the execution of a contract by the government or any of its 

instrumentalities, including government-owned and controlled corporations and their 

subsidiaries, a copy of said contract and each of all the documents forming part 

thereof by reference or incorporation shall be furnished to the Auditor of the agency 

concerned.  

 

10.2 Further, Item 3.1.2 provides that, “a copy of any purchase order irrespective of 
amount, and each and every supporting document, shall within five (5) working days 

from the issuance thereof, be submitted to the Auditor concerned. Within the same 

period, the Auditor shall review and point out to management defects and/or 

deficiencies, if any, in the same manner provided in the second and third sentences of 

item 3.1.4 hereof.” 

 

10.3 Based on the records of the Audit Team, at least 408 Contracts, Purchase Orders 
(POs) and Work Orders (WOs) were issued during CY 2020 by offices in the PCG 

Headquarters and some by the PCG Districts located in the NCR for the procurement 

of infrastructure projects, goods and services amounting to P2,766,555,661.08. Of the 

total issued, 151 POs/WOs with an aggregate amount of P487,979,191.05 remained 

unsubmitted for audit as of reporting date, as summarized below:

10.4 It is emphasized that the number of Contracts/POs issued does not include those of 
PCG Districts with respective COA Audit Team assigned thereat. Various PCG 



 

85 
 

offices are authorized to conduct procurement activities and approve contracts/POs/ 

WOs as well, for small value procurement of goods and services of less than 

P1,000,000.00.  

 

10.5 Verification from the PCG offices at Headquarters involved in the procurement 
activities revealed that some offices were not aware that advanced copies of the 

contracts/POs and WOs, together with required supporting documents, should be 

furnished the Office of the Auditor within five (5) working days from issuance or 

approval thereof; thus, violating COA Circular No. 2009-001.   

 

10.6 Management’s inadvertence to furnish the Office of the COA Auditor with copies of 
approved contracts/POs/WOs together with the supporting documents within the 

prescribed period affected the timely and effective auditorial review of contracts and 

rendition of relevant audit results. Had Management submitted the approved 

POs/WOs/Contracts on time, the defects, if any, could have been detected and 

rectified early on and communicated to the Management for appropriate action.  

 

10.7 We recommended and Management agreed to require the responsible officials 
concerned to submit immediately to the Office of the Auditor, the 151 purchase 

orders/work orders/contracts, together with supporting documents, and strictly 

comply with the requirement under COA Circular No. 2009-001. 

 

10.8 As at audit reporting date, Management had submitted a total of 81 POs/WOs in 
March and April 2021 while nine (9) POs were cancelled. 

 

 

Compliance to RA No. 9184 and its Implementing Rules and Regulation 

 

11. The PCG was not fully compliant with the provisions of RA No. 9184 and its  

RIRR in view of the deficiencies noted in the review of the contracts, such as the 

use of alternative method instead of public bidding in the procurement of 

supplies and materials worth P1 million and above, and incomplete submission 

of procurement documents.  

 

a. Use of alternative method instead of public bidding in the procurement of supplies 
and materials worth P1 million and above  

 

11.1 The Government Procurement Reform Act (RA No. 9184) was enacted to ensure that 
all procurement of the national government, its departments, bureaus, offices and 

agencies shall be governed by the principles of transparency, competitiveness, 

streamlined or efficient and effective procurement process, system of accountability 

and public monitoring. 

 

Section 10, Rule IV of RIRR of RA No. 9184 provides that all procurement shall be 

done through competitive public bidding. Section 48.2 of Rule XVI of the same RIRR 

allows alternative methods of procurement only in highly exceptional cases, such as 



 

86 
 

limited source bidding, direct contracting, repeat order, shopping, and negotiated 

procurement. 

  

11.2 Annex H of RIRR of RA 9184 provides that procurement of goods under Shopping 
and Small Value procurement modes of procurement shall not exceed one million 

pesos (P1,000,000.00) for NGAs, GOCCs, GFIs, SUCs, and Autonomous Regional 

Government.  

 

11.3 Further, Section 54.1, Rule XVI of RIRR of RA No. 9184 states that,  
 

  “Splitting of government contracts is not allowed.  Splitting of government contracts 

means the division or breaking up of GOP contracts into smaller quantities and 

amounts, or dividing contract implementation into artificial phases or sub-contracts 

for the purpose of evading or circumventing the requirements of law and the IRR, 

especially the necessity of public bidding and the requirements for the alternative 

methods of procurement”. 

 

11.4 In addition, COA Circular No. 76-41 dated July 30, 1976 defines “splitting” in its 
literal sense, as the means of “dividing or breaking up into separate parts or portion, 

or an act resulting in a fissure, rapture, breach.  Within the sphere of government 

procurement, splitting is associated with requisitions, purchase orders, deliveries and 

payments.” 

 

11.5 Under the said COA Circular, “splitting” may be in the form of: (a) Splitting of 
Requisitions which consists in the non-consolidation of requisition for one or more 

items needed at or about the same time by the requisitioner; (b) Splitting of Purchase 

Orders (POs) which consists in the issuance of two or more purchase orders based on 

two or more requisitions for the same or about the same time by the different 

requisitioners; and (c) Splitting of payments which consists in making two or more 

payments for one or more items involving one purchase order. 

 

11.6 It is an established policy of PCG that various Offices in the PCG Headquarters and 
its Districts are authorized to conduct procurement activities for goods and services 

costing below P1 million, which is in accordance with Letter J of Section IV of RIRR 

of RA No. 9184 which provides that, “The conduct of Shopping and Negotiated 

Procurement under Emergency Cases, Small Value Procurement and Lease of Real 

Property and venue may be delegated to the End-user unit or any other appropriate 

bureau, committee, or support unit duly authorized by the BAC through a Resolution 

approved by the HOPE”. 
   

11.7 Review and verification of the 322 POs/Contracts issued by PCG during CY 2020 in 
the aggregate amount of P163,807,918.16 for the procurement of goods and services 

disclosed that the POs/Contracts were made through “Shopping and Small Value 

Procurement” as the mode of procurement. However, for 146 POs/Contracts 

amounting to P93,866,760.35, Management resorted to multiple or splitting of  POs 

as can be gleaned from the data/information presented in Table 23 contrary  to the

above mentioned Section 54.1, Rule XVI  of RIRR of RA No. 9184 and COA

11.8 The above table shows that procurement of various similar kind of items/supplies and 
other materials was broken down into small purchases as evidenced by the issuance of 

POs/contracts of various dates within the month, every month or at close intervals 

between months.   

 

11.9 Splitting of purchases is an artificial scheme to make multiple awards to avoid 
existing rules and provisions of law, which has the effect of circumventing the 

provisions of RA No. 9184 and its RIRR on public bidding. 

 

11.10 Public biddings could have been conducted for the above procurement of supplies, 
materials and equipment had proper planning, meticulous and judicious procurement 

been installed, so that reasonableness in price could be obtained. Procurement 

Planning is important to ensure the readiness of a government agency to undertake the 

projects and programs including necessary procurement and logistics for the ensuing 

calendar year.   

 

11.11 We recommended that Management: 
 

a. stop the practice of splitting POs and requisitions and adopt public bidding 
as the mode of procurement and other modes, if circumstances so require, in 

order to ensure that the best value for money is always obtained in the 

procurement of goods and to comply strictly with the pertinent provisions of 

RA No. 9184 and its RIRR; and 
 

b. likewise, conduct a proper, meticulous and judicious planning to avoid 
incurrence of splitting of procurement of supplies and materials which is 

detrimental to good governance on procurement activities. 
 

11.12 The Management, through the Commander of Maritime Security and Law 
Enforcement Command (HMARSLEC), had commented that it asserts no intention to 

commit any splitting in the procurement of goods and no deliberate intent to 

circumvent the provisions on Small Value Procurement of RA No. 9184 in the 

purchasing of supplies and materials, nor was there lack of diligence in the process.  

The result was merely an oversight due to the exigency of the requirement to purchase 

these items and the inexperience of the newly aboard personnel handling the logistics 

and procurement. The Management is also committed in sustaining procurement 

system improvement as part of its initiatives and response to audit observation and 

recommendations.  They would now be extra mindful and cautious on its procurement 



 

89 
 

processes to ensure that its practices are adhering with the Government Procurement 

standards to obviate receiving similar report in the future and best serve the interest of 

the government in promoting the efficiency and integrity of the operations of the 

government agencies. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 
 

11.13 The Management should strictly monitor the procurement activities through small 
value mode of procurement being done by various PCG Offices to prevent splitting of 

contracts/POs and to avoid circumventing the requirements of RA No. 9184 and its 

RIRR, particularly the necessity of competitive public bidding.  All procurement of 

regular supplies and materials, and other items, should be meticulously and 

judiciously planned and anticipated as indicated in the agency’s Annual Procurement 

Plan, which should generally be done through public bidding. 

 

b. Incomplete submission of procurement documents  
 

11.14 The PCG had substantially complied with pertinent provisions of RA No. 9184 and 
COA Circular No. 2012-001, except for the following deficiencies noted in the review 

of 162 contracts:

Gender and Development (GAD) 

Section 31 of the General 

Provisions of RA No. 11465  

requires, among others, all 

agencies of the government to 

integrate GAD Plan in their 

regular activities and allocate at 

least five percent (5%) of their 

budgets for GAD.  

 

Item V of COA Circular No. 

2014-001 dated March 18, 2014 

requires that the Audited agency 

shall submit a copy of the Annual 

GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) to 

the COA, Audit Team assigned to 

the agency within five (5) 

working days from the receipt of 

the approved plan from the PCW 

or their mother or central offices, 

as the case maybe. 

  

PCW Memorandum Circular No. 

2014-05 dated 28 November 

2014 emphasized the need to 

implement the provisions of the 

Magna Carta of Women (MCW) 

and its Implementing Rules and 

Regulations (IRR) which 

mandates all government 

instrumentalities to adopt gender 

mainstreaming as a strategy for 

implementing the law and 

attaining its objectives. 

 

Section 4.4 of PCW-NEDA-

DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-

01. 

 

Section 5 of COA Circular No. 

2014-001 dated March 18, 2014 

provides that -  “The audited 

agency shall submit a copy of 

the Annual GAD Plan and 

Budget (GPB) to the COA 

Audit Team assigned to the 

agency within five (5) working 

days from receipt of the 

approved plan from the PCW or 

their mother or central offices, 

as the case maybe. Likewise, a 

copy of the corresponding 

Accomplishment Report shall 

be furnished the said Audit 

A total amount of P17.010 million or 0.11 percent of the total 

PCG appropriations of P15.230 billion was allocated for GAD-

related activities which was less than the five (5) percent 

minimum required by law. Of the allocated amount, only 

P7.335 million or 43.12 percent thereof was actually utilized 

thus, defeating the intent of the program to pursue women’s 

empowerment and gender equality.   

  
Validation of GAD accomplishment reports revealed that the 

allocated budget of P17,010,000.00 was intended for the 

implementation of 16 programmed/planned GAD-related activities 

which were not fully attained and implemented during CY 2020, 

with actual fund utilization of only P7,334,987.00 or 43.15 percent 

of the total allocated budget. 

 

The activities were not fully mainstreamed with the mandated 

functions of the agency  pursuant to the Philippine Commission on 

Women (PCW) Memorandum Circular No. 2014-05 dated 

November 28, 2014 due to COVID-19 pandemic, hence, defeating 

the intent of   the program to pursue women’s empowerment and 

gender equality.  It likewise, deprived the targeted beneficiaries in 

the workplace of the opportunity to fully enjoy and avail of the 

intended benefits from poverty alleviation, economic 

empowerment of marginalized women, protection, promotion and 

fulfilment of human rights and gender responsive governance.   

 

The Audit Team also observed the following deficiencies: 

 

a. Non-submission of the Approved PCG Annual Plan and Budget 
to the PCW, and delayed submission of the Accomplishment 

Report to COA Audit Team within five (5) working days from 

the end of the preceding year, pursuant to COA Circular No. 

2014-001 dated March 18, 2014; and 

 

b. Non-development or non-integration in its existing database a 
GAD Information on gender statistics and sex-disaggregation 

data that have been systematically produced or gathered, as 

inputs or bases for planning, budgeting, programming, and 

policy formulation, pursuant to Section 4.4 of PCW-NEDA-

DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01. 

 

We recommended that Management direct the GAD Focal 

Point System Committee to: 

 

a. exert best effort to devise or formulate a more realistic and 
attainable GAD Plan for its human resource which are also 

mainstreamed or integrated in their regular activities and be 

funded with at least five percent (5%) of the PCG budget 

pursuant to Section 31 of the General Provisions of the GAA 

and to fully utilize the same for the purpose for which the 

funds were intended;  

 

b. submit to the Audit Team the GPB and GAD 



 

92 
 

LRRs Audit Observation 

Team within five (5) working 

days from the end of January of 

the preceding year.” 

 

Section 4.4 of PCW-NEDA-DBM 

Joint Circular No. 2012-01 states - 

“The agency shall develop or 

integrate in its existing database 

GAD information to include gender 

statistics and sex-disaggregated data 

that have been systematically 

produced or gathered as inputs or 

bases for planning, budgeting, 

programming, and policy 

formulation.” 

 

Accomplishment Reports within the prescribed five working 

days from the end of the preceding year, pursuant to COA 

Circular No. 2014-001 dated March 18, 2014; and 

 

c. establish/institutionalize a GAD Database/Sex Disaggregated 
Data (SDD) and conduct gender analysis, results of which 

shall be used in policy making and program development in 

addressing gender issues to be contained in the GPB. 

 

The Management, thru its CGHRMC, headed by Commo Ramos, 

commented that the PCG had realigned P4,360,000 or almost 50 

percent of the GAD annual budget (as authorized under Bayanihan 

to Heal as one Act) to support COVID-19 response and operations.  

Nonetheless, many of the GAD activities were achieved despite the 

pandemic.  The GAD also was able to amend policies on anti-

sexual harassment and other amendments and policies related to 

GAD. The PCG Plans and programs are on-going. The date of 

submission to   PCW is on or before March 12, 2021. 

 
Programs/Projects for Senior Citizens (SCs) and Persons with Disabilities (PWDs) 

Section 32 of the 2020 

GAA states, “all agencies of the 

government shall formulate plans, 

programs and projects intended to 

address the concerns of senior 

citizens and persons with 

disability, insofar as it relates to 

their mandated functions, and 

integrate the same in their regular 

activities.” 

The PCG also failed to formulate plans, programs and projects 

that would address the concerns of the Senior Citizens and 

Persons with Disability, contrary to Section 32 of the General 

Provisions of GAA CY 2020.  

 

For CY 2020, the PCG was unable to formulate projects related to 

Senior Citizens and Persons with Disability due to the limited 

movement of PCG Personnel because of the COVID-19 ongoing 

pandemic. 

 

We recommended that the Management prepare and submit its 

plans and programs that would address the concerns of the 

Senior Citizens and Persons with Disability pursuant to Section 

32 of the General Provisions of GAA CY 2020.  

 

Compliance with Tax Laws 

Section 7 of Revenue Regulation 

No. 1-2013 dated January 23, 

2013 provides the filing of tax 

returns using the electronic Tax 

Remittance Advice (eTRA) on or 

before the 10th day following the 

month in which the withholding 

was made except for taxes 

withheld in December of each 

year, which shall be 

filed/remitted on or before 

January 15 of the following year.  

Section 4.110-1 of Revenue 

Regulation No.8-2002 dated June 

13, 2002 provides that every 

person liable to pay VAT shall 

file quarterly return of the amount 

of his quarterly gross sales or 

Of the total taxes withheld by the PCG in CY 2020 amounting 

to P521.457 million, the amount of P449.748 million or 86.25 

percent thereof was remitted to the Bureau of Internal 

Revenue. Of the unremitted balance of P71.583 million, the 

amount of P53.681 million was remitted in January 2021, 

leaving an unaccounted amount  of  P17.902 million. 

 

For CY 2020, PCG withheld taxes from the salaries and benefits of 

the uniformed/civilian employees and payments of purchases on 

infrastructure, goods and services from suppliers and contractors 

including VAT amounting to P521,457,009.29; of which the 

amount of P449,874,268.12 was remitted to the Bureau of Internal 

Revenue during the year. The amount of P53,681,007.96 was 

remitted in January 11, 2021, leaving a balance of P17,901,733.21, 

which is still subject for review, analysis, adjustment and 

remittance. 

 

The Management had commented that the balance of 



 

93 
 

LRRs Audit Observation 

receipts within twenty five (25) 

days following the close of the 

taxable quarter. 

P17,901,733.21 shall be subjected for further evaluation and will 

immediately inform the Audit Team as soon as the result/s are 

available. 

  

We recommended  and Management agreed to conduct 

further review and  analysis of  the prior years’ unaccounted 

amount of P17,901,733.21 and remit whatever  amount that is 

due to the BIR or make necessary adjustments, if warranted. 
 

Compliance with the Government Service Insurance System  Act of 1997 

Section 14.1 Rule III of the IRR 

of RA No. 8291, otherwise 

known as the “Government 

Service Insurance System Act of 

1997” states that, “Each 

government agency shall remit 

directly to the GSIS the 

employees’ and government 

agency’s contributions within the 

first ten (10) days of the calendar 

month following the month to 

which the contributions apply. 

The remittance by the 

government agency of the GSIS 

shall take priority over and above 

the payment of any and all 

obligations except salaries and 

wages of its employees.” 

 

Section 26 of PD No. 1638 

requires that, “Retired military 

personnel receiving monthly 

pension shall to contribute to the 

AFP Retirement and Separation 

Benefit System in the amount 

equivalent to four percent (4%) of 

the base and longevity pay of the 

last permanent grade he holds

equivalent to the length of service 

rendered as a civilian official of 

employee of the Philippine 

Government xxx.” 

 

Section 4.2 of DBM Circular No. 

2020-6 dated March 30, 2020, 

provides that, “Starting April 

2020, the DBM shall directly

contributions and obligating funds for its share and remittance 

thereof to GSIS.  

 

The PCG uniformed personnel are covered by PD No. 1638 which 

called for the establishment of a system of retirement and 

separation for military personnel of the Armed Forces of the 

Philippines and   for other purposes.   Thus, the Agency is only 

obliged to deduct and remit the contribution’s share of civilian 

officers and employees to GSIS. 

 

Audit of the account balance of the Retirement and Life Insurance 

Premium (RLIP) expense as of December 31, 2020 revealed that 

the amount of P3,024,867.03 represented only obligations and 

remittances thereof for the period January to April 2020.  The 

DBM, thru its Section 4.2 of DBM Circular No. 2020-6 dated 

March 30, 2020, will be responsible for the remittance to GSIS the 

Government’s share on RLIP effective April, 2020.  Consequently, 

GARO No. 2020-02 was issued to negate the allotment of PCG for 

RLIP in the amount of P6,166,000.00.  

 

We commended the PCG Management for continuously 

withholding member’s contributions and obligating funds for 

its share and remitting thereof to the GSIS, before the 

deadlines set.

Funds for the Coronavirus Disease 2019 – P500,706,172.80 

 

13. The PCG did not receive allotments or fund transfers from any government 
agencies for COVID-19 related expenditures; however, the amount of P500.706 

million was realigned from its regular allotments to fund various projects to 

address the COVID-19 pandemic. Of this amount, P400.607 million  was 

expended for COVID -19 as at year-end.    

 

13.1 The Philippine Coast Guard remains at the frontline of national emergencies, together 
with the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and the Philippine National Police 

(PNP).  

 

13.2 Since the COVID-19 outbreak, the PCG was designated to hold patrol missions to 
secure cruise ships in various parts of the country using the Multi-role Response 

Vessels (MRRVs). They also assisted medical personnel in collecting swabs for 

testing of Filipino crews in the quarantined ships following the protocols of the 

Philippine Red Cross (PRC) and the Bureau of Quarantine. It had activated the PCG 

Task Force Laban COVID-19 amid the increasing cases of individuals infected by 

COVID-19 in various areas in the country. Under the PCG Task Force Laban 

COVID-19, members are trained and deployed to medical facilities to assist medical 

front liners and implement health protocols to persons under investigation (PUIs) and 

COVID-19 patients. 

 

13.3 As the lead Agency in the water security cluster, PCG has deployed five (5) of the 10 
44-meter MRRVs in transporting medicines and medical supplies in Visayas, ferrying 

stranded international tourists to their sweeper flights, and securing the cruise ships 

quarantined in Manila Bay while assisting the virus testing of its passengers. 

 

13.4 Furthermore, composite law enforcement and medical teams of the PCG, Philippine 
National Police – Maritime Group, PNP – NCRPO, and Joint Task Force Armed 

Forces of the Philippines – NCR have been deployed to implement health protocols 

and safety guidelines on passengers and crew members of domestic and foreign 

passenger ships, domestic and foreign cargo vessels, fishing boats, motor bancas, 

private watercrafts, government vessels, tugboats, and pilot boats in Manila Bay and 

its coastal areas, Pasig River, Navotas River, Cainta River, Laguna de Bay, Parañaque 

River, Manggahan Floodway, Marikina River, and Las Piñas Bay. 

 

13.5 As authorized under RA Nos. 11469 and 11494 and NBC Circular No. 580 dated 
April 22, 2020, the unobligated allotments intended for various programs, proejcts 

and activities amounting to P500,706,172.80 was realigned to fund various projects to 

address the COVID-19 pandemic of which, a total of P400,607,880.46  was obligated, 

with an unexpended balance of P100,098,292.34  as at year-end, as shown in Table

13.6 Procurement of  COVID-19 related programs, projects, goods and services  regardless 
of amount, effective March  to September 10, 2020 are through Emergency 

Procurement modality as authorized under the Bayanihan Act One, dispensing the 

public bidding mode of procurement. However,  from September 11, 2020 up to 

December 31, 2020, procurement of programs, projects, goods and services  with 

monetary thresholds of 1 million and above is through public bidding with some 

modifications in the procurement process as provided under  Bayanihan Act Two, and 

GPPB Resolution No. 19-2020 dated September 21, 2020. 

 

13.7 Audit of the expenses for COVID-19 disclosed the following:  
 

a. Non-issuance of Property Acknowledgment Receipts and Inventory Custodian 
Slips  on various equipment and semi-expendable items - P35,237,234.00 

 

Issuances to end-users  of medical equipment and medical supplies for     

COVID-19 amounting to P35.315 million were not covered by Property 

Acknowledgment Receipts and Inventory Custodian Slips; hence, proper 

accountability and responsibility thereof could not be established, which may 

result in loss and wastage of government resources. 
 

13.8 Section 9.1.3.1 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 provides the 
documentary requirements for supplies, materials, equipment and Motor vehicles, 

among which is the submission of the Property Acknowledgment Receipt (PAR) or 

Inventory Custodian Slips (ICS), whichever is applicable. 

 



 

97 
 

13.9 The PAR is prepared to support the issuance of Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) 
to the end-user to establish accountability and custodianship over the property. Under 

Section 4 of the GAM for NGAs Volume 1, the capitalization threshold of P15,000.00 

represents the minimum cost of an individual asset recognized as a PPE on the 

Statement of Financial Position. 

 

13.10 Thus, an item purchased costing P15,000.00 or more is capitalized and considered 
PPE and supported with a PAR.  However, an ICS is issued to end-users of semi-

expendable properties below the capitalization threshold of P15,000.00. 

 

13.11 Review and validation of the procurement of various PPE and semi-expendable 
properties with an aggregate amount of P18,156,000.00 and P17,081,234.00, 

respectively, disclosed that the issuance of the items were not supported with either 

PAR or ICS to establish accountability and responsibility of end-users. Details of this 

are as follows:

13.12 Further, all DVs were not also supported with pictures of the delivered items, casting 
doubts on whether or not there were actual deliveries made on the items, 

notwithstanding the submission of signed Inspection and Acceptance Reports (IAR) 

and Certificates of Acceptance (CA). The snap shots of the delivered items as 

additional documents should have been considered and required by Management prior 

to the distribution and use of the items purchased to strengthen controls and provide 

reasonable assurance that indeed, there were actual deliveries made. This control 

procedure, if made prior to use and distribution, will also reduce the risk of loss and 

wastage of government resources and would ensure Management’s confidence on the 

physical existence and delivery of goods. 
  
13.13  Moreover, all Delivery Receipts lacked the specific description of each items 

purchased and delivered, such as but not limited to, brand names, brochures, manuals, 

model type, warranty certificates, and serial numbers of each item delivered, which 

may result in confusion and ambiguity in terms of technical inspection, identification 



 

99 
 

and recording of the items purchased and delivered. In view of these, the preparation 

and submission of PARs and ICSs for the items listed in Table 27 is an indispensable 

control measure to ensure proper accountability and responsibility of end-users. The 

absence of these documents may cast doubts on the regularity of the purchase of the 

items.  

 

13.14 The Management commented that it furnished the Audit Team of copies of the issued 
PARs and ICS to ENS Claire E, Esquivias, assigned at Coast Guard Medical Service, 

Nelvin G Jazo, assigned at CGLSC Office, NHQ and ENS Benus P Epa, assigned at 

CGSBPS. 

 

13.15 The Audit Team finds the issuance of PARs and ICS to ENS Claire E, Esquivias, 
Nelvin G Jazo, and ENS Benus P Epa improperly done and were not in accord to the 

purpose/objective for which the PAR/ICS is issued because the properties were not in 

their custody/possession and they are not the end-users of the items issued. Section 

21, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs Volume I, provides that, “Based on Approved 

RIS, the Supply and/or Property Custodian shall prepare the PAR to support the issue 

of Property to end-users.  

 

13.16 The PAR and ICS should be issued only to the end-users or those in custody or has 
direct control of the issued properties and equipment. As a control measure for 

numerous inventoriable items or semi-expendable properties such as the 3,600 

infrared thermometer guns, a distribution list duly received by the recipients, 

indicating their designation and office location should be prepared. 

 

13.17 Moreover,  the PARs and ICS issued  were unnumbered and the items have no 
Property Number, amount and dates.  

 

13.18 We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 

a. cancel the PAR/ICS issued to ENS Claire E. Esquivias, Nelvin G Jazo, and 
ENS Benus P Epa  and issue the PAR/ICS to transfer the accountability to 

the end-users who have physical custody of the items or properties;  

 

b. ensure that PARs and ICS are numbered  and should bear the property 
number, date and amount of the items issued; and  

 

c. henceforth, require copies of pictures on all goods delivered as additional 
documents attached to the DVs to strengthen controls and to ensure 

confidence and reasonable assurance on the physical existence of the goods 

delivered and to reduce the risk of loss or wastage of government resources.

b. Idle Medical Equipment for COVID-19 – P7,873,000.00 
 

The PCG purchased nine (9) units of medical equipment amounting to P7.873 

million thru the emergency mode of procurement pursuant to RA No. 114691, 

which had remained idle and unutilized as at year-end or about eight (8) months 

from its delivery on May 5, 2020 in spite of the reported high positivity rate of 

COVID-19 infection among PCG personnel; thereby defeating the purpose for 

which the acquisition of equipment was intended. 

 

13.19 In response to the National Health Emergency under Presidential Proclamation No. 
922 and  the enactment of RA No. 11469, PCG urgently procured essential  supplies 

and medical equipment in order to contain the spread of the virus and protect the 

16,785 PCG  personnel  to include senior leadership as well as front-liners led by 

medical personnel composed of Doctors, Nurses and Medical Technologists 

conducting health assessments, risk stratification, information collection, personnel 

evaluation and testing, monitoring and management of patients, national risk 

assessment of ships as part of port state control and other essential requirements for 

Quarantine Facilities (QFs). 

 

13.20 The emergency procurement of medical equipment, supplies and materials for 
containment of COVID-19 without need of public bidding is authorized under Item 

k.1 of RA No. 11469 or otherwise known as “Bayanihan to Heal As One Act”.  The 

PCG procured these medical equipment and supplies which were considered by the 

PCG as essential items to prevent the spread of the virus and to protect all PCG 

personnel.  The emergency mode of procurement, as authorized under the said Act, 

was aimed not to hamper the operational capabilities of Coast Guard Medical Service 

(CGMEDS), and to be well equipped for the emergency health care of PCG personnel 

affected with the virus, as well as its containment. 

 

13.21 Under PO No. PCG-20-04-0014 dated April 29, 2020, 10 units of various medical 
equipment amounting to P8,023,000.00 were procured for the urgent requirement for 

critically ill PCG personnel afflicted with COVID-19 virus, as follows:

13.22 Ocular inspection on January 21, 2021 on the delivered medical equipment disclosed 
that, except for the Gurney/Stretcher, all other nine (9) items costing P7,873,000.00 

had remained idle and unutilized as evidenced by their physical condition, as follows:  

  

a. ventilator machine was still in carton- box packaging unopened  
b. anaesthesia machine in a crate packaging unopened  
c. the cardiac monitor and ECG Machine in each boxes unopened  
d. the automated external defibrillator, autoclave machine portable, CBC Machine; 

and 

e. microscope binocular and diagnostic set were just opened for inspection 
purposes. 

 

13.23 As of audit date, the unused medical equipment are stored in the CGMEDS and are 
still subject for calibration and/or testing by the Supplier, though the TWG had 

already issued the IAR.  Per audit of the disbursement voucher, all medical equipment 

were already paid under LDDAP-ADA No. 05-0958-2020 dated May 26, 2020 in the 

amount of P8,023,000.00. 

 

13.24 Had these equipment been urgently needed and essential in PCG’s thrusts and 
objectives to address the need of its critically ill PCG personnel due to the COVID-19 

pandemic, these would not have been idle for eight months and the same should have 

been in use to serve its purpose.  

 

13.25 The Audit Team acknowledges the untiring efforts of PCG to contain the transmission 
of the COVID-19 virus within its workforce. However, prior to procurement, the 

Management should have carefully planned what equipment are urgently needed in 

the attainment of its thrusts and objectives to ensure that government resources are 

effectively and efficiently utilized. Moreover, the equipment, even if not in use, will 

depreciate due to wear and tear or obsolescence; thus, may result in loss of 

government funds. 

 

13.26 Management commented that according to the CGMEDS, the procurement of the 
medical equipment was in support with the DOTr’s initiative to address ventilatory 

support, cardiac monitoring and resuscitative measures based on the original plan that 

the Eva Macapagal Super Terminal was retrofitted as a treatment facility for 

moderate, severe and critical COVID-19 cases, to which the PCG personnel were also

PCG Medical Unit to prevent further losses due to wear and tear.
