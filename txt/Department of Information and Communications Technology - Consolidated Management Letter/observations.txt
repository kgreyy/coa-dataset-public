Department of Information and Communications Technology 

For the period 1 January to 31 December 2020 

 

 

1. Pursuant to Section 2, Article IX-D of the Constitution of the Philippines and 
Section 43 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445, otherwise known as the Government 

Auditing Code of the Philippines, we have audited the accounts and operations of the 

Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) for the period ended 

31 December 2020. 

 

2. The audit was conducted to: (a) verify the level of assurance that maybe placed on 
Management’s assertion on the FSs; (b) recommend agency improvement opportunities; 

and (c) determine the extent of implementation of prior years’ audit recommendations. 

 

3. Deficiencies observed in the course of the audit were previously communicated 
through various Audit Observation Memoranda (AOM). Management’s comments were 

incorporated in this Management Letter, where appropriate. Significant audit observations 

and pertinent recommendations shall be incorporated in the Consolidated Annual Audit 

Report (CAAR) on the DICT for CY 2020. 

 

 

A. Introduction 
 

4. The DICT was created by virtue of Republic Act (RA) No. 10844, otherwise known 
as the DICT Act of 2015, which was signed into law on 23 May 2016. The DICT is the



2

1. National Telecommunications Commission, 
2. National Privacy Commission, and 
3. Cybercrime Investigation and Coordinating Center. 

 

7. On 01 July 2019, the President of the Republic of the Philippines appointed ad 
interim Secretary Gregorio B. Honasan, as the Secretary of the DICT. He is assisted by 

seven (7) Undersecretaries, six (6) Assistant Secretaries and 33 Directors. 

 

8. The DICT has eight (8) Field Operating Offices (FOOs), namely: Luzon Cluster 
(LC) 1 – Regions 1, 2 & CAR (Baguio); LC2 – Regions 3 & 4A (Malolos); LC3 – Regions 

4B & 5 (Batangas); Visayas Cluster (VC) 1 – Region 6 (Iloilo); VC2 – Regions 7, 8 (Cebu);

B. Summary of Audit Observations and Recommendations 
 

11. For the significant audit observations noted during the audit, we recommended the 
following courses of action: 

 

a.          Despite the previous year’s audit recommendation, Cash In Bank   totaling 
₱255,645,642.98, which comprised of unutilized/ idle cash in bank of the CO of 
₱1,393,781.47, excess balances of training fees collections with bank balance    of 

₱17,648,209.36 (net of outstanding checks) as at 30 November 2020 and 

unauthorized/unnecessary Cash In Bank accounts of FOOs of ₱236,603,652.15 as 

at 31 December 2020 were maintained in the depository bank and remained 

unremitted to the National Treasury. 

 

We reiterated our prior year’s recommendation, with modification, that 

Management cause the return to the National Treasury of the unauthorized/ 

dormant/unnecessary cash in bank balances of the DICT-CO and FOOs 

amounting to ₱19,041,990.83 and ₱236,603,652.15, respectively, in accordance 

with the steps provided in COA Circular No. 2015-001 dated 29 January 2015 

in relation to DOF-DBM-COA Permanent Committee JC No. 4-2012 dated 11 

September 2012. 

 

b. Management failed to collect/settle the disallowances in full totaling 
₱236,911,749.10 despite receipt of the Notice of Finality of Decision and the COA 

Order of Execution (COE). 



4  

We recommended that Management direct the Legal Office to issue demand 

letters and enforce settlement/collection from the persons liable, or consider 

filing a case in court, if warranted. 
 

c. Out of the ₱3,351,211,862.80 allotted for the DICT programs, only 
₱2,185,909,131.93 or 65.23 percent were obligated while ₱406,827,567.73 or 18.61 

percent of obligated funds were disbursed indicating an overall low fund utilization 

rate and very low disbursement rate which may adversely affect the delivery of vital 

services to the public, especially during this time of pandemic. Further, out of the 

continuing allotments totaling ₱3,110,833,949.12, the utilization rate was an 

average of 80 percent but the disbursement rate was a mere 18.76 percent and the 

unobligated balance of ₱5,635,711,806.31 may lapse at year-end even before its 

full utilization and the completion of the intended projects. 

 

We recommended that Management: (a) submit an explanation on the 

causes/reasons for the low utilization rate of the CY 2020 allotments and 

continuing allotments, and the reasons for the very low disbursement rate of 

the obligated funds; (b) require the Budget Division to submit to the Audit 

Team the basis for recognition of the not yet due and demandable accounts 

payable of the DICT as at 31 December 2020, together with its supporting 

documents, for verification; and (c) institute measures to improve DICT’s 

fiscal planning in order to address the gap between the allotted budget and the 

actual disbursements and to fully implement the program/project/activities of 

the agency. 

 

C. Detailed Observations and Recommendations 
 

Financial Audit 

 

Non-submission of Financial Statements/Delayed submission of Trial Balances 

 

12. The non-submission of the financial statements and the delayed submission of 
the trial balances precluded the timely analysis and verification of the account 

balances to establish fully the validity of accounts and transactions as at 31 December 

2020. 

 

13. Section 60, Chapter 19 of Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National 
Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I, provides the deadline on the submission of 

financial statements and schedules. The monthly pre-closing Trial Balance (TB) and 

supporting schedules shall be submitted within ten (10) days after the end of the month 

while the quarterly TB, FSs and supporting schedules shall be submitted within ten (10) 

days after the end of the quarter. 

 

14. Records showed that for Calendar Year (CY) 2020, the DICT was able to submit 
only the TBs for the months of January to November 2020 and with delays ranging from 

four (4) to 197 days, while the December 2020 as well as all the quarterly and year-end 



5  

FSs for the year 2020 were still unsubmitted as of this report, as shown in the following 

table.

February 8/25/2020 168   

March 6/18/2020 69 Not yet submitted 

April 9/16/2020 129   
May 9/16/2020 98

September 10/14/2020 4 Not yet submitted 

October 11/23/2020 13   
November 12/18/2020 8   

December July 21, 2021 192 Not yet submitted 

 

15. Moreover, the TBs submitted were not supported with schedules such as the 
breakdown of cash advances, receivables and liabilities, among others. 

 

16. Further, the agency still uses the manual system of accounting and keeps its books 
of accounts in Excel files. The use of the e-NGAS may improve the agency’s  efficiency 

in the preparation and submission of the aforementioned financial reports and transaction 

documents. 

 

17. We recommended that Management: 
 

a. submit an explanation for the considerable delays and/or non-submission 
of the trial balance and the financial statements; 

 

b. require the Accounting Division to strategize given the existing manpower 
on how to minimize delays in the submission of the financial statements 

and its supporting schedules and subsidiary records; 

 

c. strictly adhere to the provision under Section 60, Chapter 19, Volume I of 
the GAM; and 

 

d. coordinate with the COA Government Accountancy Sector for the 
installation of the e-NGAS and the conduct of relevant trainings thereon. 

 

18. As of this report, the Audit Team has not received any Management comment 
pertaining to the foregoing observations and recommendations. 



6  

Accounting Errors/Omissions 

 

19. Errors/omissions in the recording of the DICT’s various asset, liability, 
revenue, expense and equity accounts as at 30 November 2020, negatively affected 

Management’s assertions as to the accuracy, existence, completeness, rights and 

obligations, cut-off, classification and understandability of the various accounts. 

 

20. Paragraph 15 of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) 1 
and Section 3, Chapter 19, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs, states, “Financial statements 

are a structured representation of the financial position and financial performance of an 

entity. The objectives of general purpose financial statements are to provide information 

about the financial position, financial performance, and cash flows of an entity that is 

useful to a wide range of users in making and evaluating decisions about the allocation of 

resources.” The standards further state that specifically, the objectives of general purpose 

financial reporting in the public sector should be to provide information useful for decision 

making, and to demonstrate the accountability of the entity for the resources entrusted to 

it. 

 

21. Paragraph 27 of the IPSAS provides that FSs shall present fairly the financial 
position, financial performance, and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the 

faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in 

accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and 

expenses set out in IPSASs. The application of IPSASs, with additional disclosures, when 

necessary, is presumed to result in financial statements that achieve a fair presentation. 

 

22. As at CY 2020, the recording of the financial transactions of the DICT is 
“centralized” in the books of accounts maintained by the DICT-Central Office (CO) as the 

FOOs have no books of accounts. 

 

23. Audit revealed several accounting errors/omissions in the account balances 
reported in the General Ledger (GL)/Trial Balance as at 30 November 2020, as summarized 

in Table 2.

Grand Total – CO / FOO 4,984,051.04 (60,068.19) 
 

28. The unrecorded Debit Memoranda (DMs) in the amount of ₱20,120.07 pertaining 
to CY 2016 to 2018 transactions were included in the findings in the CAARs for CYs 2018 

and 2019 yet these remained unadjusted in the books of accounts due to the absence of 

supporting documents. The recommendation in the previous years that the Finance Service 

and Accounting Division should request copies of the DMs from the bank was not 

implemented as shown in the Agency Action Plan and Status of Implementation (AAPSI) 

for CY 2019 submitted on 14 April 2021. 

 

29. The breakdown of the deposits totaling ₱4,876,014.76 was as follows: 
 

a.   The ₱30,600.00 credited by the bank to the Trust Liabilities account of the CO 

included in the CY 2019 CAAR remained unadjusted in the books of accounts 

due to the absence of supporting documents; 

 

b.  The ₱3,069.76 and ₱4,739,000.00, or the total of ₱4,742,069.76 erroneously 

debited to the account Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, Regular instead of Cash 

in Bank-Local Currency, Current Account resulting in the overstatement of the 

former account and the understatement of the latter account; 

 

c.   The ₱103,345.00 training fees directly deposited by clients (individuals/private 

companies/other government institutions) to the DICT’s bank account but were 

not recorded in the books because the corresponding Official Receipts (ORs) 

were not yet issued by the Cash Division due to the absence of information such 

as the name of the payors to whom the ORs will be issued; thus, no reference 

document for the Accounting Division to record the receipt of fund. 

 

30. The recommendation in CY 2019 that Management issue clear policy/guidelines to 
address the direct deposit to the DICT bank account was not implemented due to the on- 

going review and discussion of policy/guidelines, taking into consideration the adjustments 

to be made on the non-conduct of face to face learning and adoption of online courses due 

to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

 

31. The stale checks totaling ₱572,695.98 remained unadjusted in the books of 
accounts reportedly due to the lack of supporting documents. 



14  

32. Moreover, the FOOs did not use the book balances per DICT books of accounts in 
preparing the Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRSs) but instead used the balances 

reflected in their own records. With this practice, there could still be reconciling items 

which remained undetermined. 

 

33. The failure to effect and recognize the necessary adjusting entries in the books for 
the reconciling items reflected in the BRSs resulted in the understatement of the CIB-LCCA 

account by ₱4,923,982.85. 

 

b) Inexistent Cash in Bank balance 
 

34. The reported balance of Cash in Bank - LCCA account still included the amount of 
₱618,159.12 and (₱140.98) pertaining to LBP Account Nos. 0232-1115-18 and 0232- 

1100-74, respectively, confirmed to have zero balances as the bank accounts had long been 

closed, as shown in Table 9.

c) Unrecorded FOO transactions 
 

35. Section 39.d, Chapter 5, Volume I of the GAM, provides that Field Offices (FOs)/ 
Operating Units (OUs) without a complete set of books shall record their collections of 

income chronologically in the Cash Receipts Register (CRReg). The certified copy of the 

CRReg together with the required supporting documents, duplicate copies of ORs and 

Deposit Slip shall be submitted within five (5) days after the end of each month to the 

concerned mother unit (central/regional/division office) by the FOs (a unit under the 

central/regional/ division office) for review and recording of the transactions in the CRJ by 

the Chief Accountant. 

 

36. Section 11, Chapter 6 of the same Manual requires FOs without a complete set of 
books to record chronologically in the Cash in Bank Register (CBReg) all checks 

issued/charged to deposits with the authorized government depository bank (AGDB). The 

certified copy of the CBReg together with the required supporting documents shall be 

submitted within five (5) days after the end of each month to the concerned mother unit by 

the field offices for review and recording of the transactions in the books of accounts. 

 

37. The GL of the Cash-Collecting Officers account disclosed that the total FOO 
collections and deposits made in January to November 2020 both amounted to 

₱156,623.31. However, per confirmation with the FOO Auditors, the collections and 

deposits, amounted to ₱14,490,687.14 and ₱14,645,437.16, respectively, or an unrecorded 

collection and deposit of ₱14,334,063.83 and ₱14,488,813.85, as shown in Table 10.

₱11,421,244.46 and ₱11,315,630.98, were recorded as at 30 November 2020, leaving the 

total unrecorded collections of ₱24,001,031.54 and ₱14,658,586.01, respectively, thus, 

resulting in the understatement of the Cash-Collecting Officers account by a net amount of 

₱9,342,445.53. 

 

39. On the other hand, the amount of FOO disbursements per FOO records totaling 
₱235,491,472,80 varies significantly with the amount recorded in the DICT CO books 

amounting to ₱11,228,046.63 as at 30 November 2020, as summarized in Table 11:

granted to Accountable Officers in CYs 2016 to 2020, replenishment of PCF in CYs 2016 

to 2020 in the amount of ₱2,561,249.45, and liquidations and refunds of accountabilities 

amounting to ₱5,387.75 and ₱49,612.25, respectively, were not recorded in the DICT- CO 

books as at 30 November 2020. 

 

44. As explained by the concerned Accounting personnel, the Accounting Division had 
backlogs of unrecorded FOO transactions and was not able to keep up with the recording 

due to lack of manpower and on-going placement and hiring process. 

 

45. The incomplete recording of the afore-cited transactions in the DICT-CO books of 
accounts may also be attributed to the failure to conduct regular/periodic reconciliation of 

accounting records of DICT-CO and FOOs, confusion on the decentralization of the 

DICT’s accounting system due to the failure of Management to issue directives/guidelines 

on the matter, leniency of the Accountant in requiring the FOOs on the submission of 

CRReg and CBReg with supporting reports/records, and failure of the FOOs to furnish the 

DICT-CO with copies of the said reports/records. 

 

d) Misclassification of fund transfer to FOOs 
 

46. Section 19, Chapter 2, Volume I of the GAM, states that the presentation and 
classification of items in the FSs shall be retained from one period to the next unless laws, 

rules and regulations, and IPSAS require a change in presentation. 

 

47. Furthermore, Section 12, Chapter 19 of the said GAM, provides that when the 
presentation or classification of items in the financial statements is amended, comparative 

amounts shall be reclassified unless the reclassification is impracticable. When it is 

impracticable to reclassify comparative amounts, an entity shall disclose: (a) the reason for 



17  

not reclassifying the amounts; and (b) the nature of the adjustments that would have been 

made if the amounts had been reclassified. 

 

48. Every month, the DICT-CO transfers funds to the specific bank accounts of the 
FOOs for their operational expenses by issuing Advice to Debit Account (ADA) charged 

to its regular Modified Disbursement System (MDS) account. 

 

49. Previously, such fund transfers were recognized in the books as debit to Advances 
for Operating Expenses. As it is merely a fund transfer from the MDS account of the DICT 

CO to the Cash in Bank account of the FOOs, it was recommended under AOM No. 2018- 

003 (2016-2018) dated 02 October 2018 that the Chief Accountant reclassify the 

outstanding balances of Advances for Operating Expenses to CIB-LCCA, and henceforth, 

recognize transfers of funds to FOOs under the same account, maintain the corresponding 

SLs, and prepare monthly BRSs for each bank account. 

 

50. The Accountant implemented the recommendation and on 31 October 2018, JEV 
no. GJ-18-10-603 was drawn reclassifying the amount of ₱479,636,887.38 from the 

Advances for Operating Expenses account to Cash-in Bank – Local Currency, Current 

Account. The practice continued until CY 2019. 

 

51. However, in CY 2020, fund transfers amounting to ₱327,107,877.27 from CO- 
MDS to FOO bank accounts were debited to the another account, Due from Regional 

Offices, instead of Cash-in Bank – Local Currency, Current Account which resulted in the 

overstatement of the former account and understatement of the latter account by the same 

amount. 

 

52. In effect, the unliquidated balance of fund transfers to FOOs in previous years were 
retained in the account CIB – LCCA while the fund transfers for the period January to 

November 2020 were recognized as Intra-Agency Receivables. This showed not only the 

unreliability and inaccuracy of the reported balances but also the inconsistency in reporting. 

 

53. Accordingly, such entry was made due to the on-going decentralization of the 
DICT’s accounting system. However, such claim was negated because the entry 

transferring the FOO balances to the FOO books of accounts were subsequently reverted 

to DICT CO books of accounts. 

 

54. To clear the matter, the Audit Team sent a letter dated 24 March 2021 to DICT 
Management requesting for a copy of the guidelines/directives on the decentralization of 

accounting system, if any, but as of this report, no response was received. 

 

e) Misstatements in recording collections and deposits of the DICT-CO and FOO 
 

55. Audit of the accounts Cash - Collecting Officers and Cash-Treasury/Agency 
Deposit, Regular revealed misstatements such as overstatement in recording deposits, 

understatement  in  recording collections, and non-cancellation of journal entry pertaining 



18  

to the collections and deposits of the dishonored checks, resulting in the overstatement of 

Cash and Revenue account by a net amount of ₱84,577.28, summarized in Table 13.

56. In addition, various deposits made in December 2019 and January 2020 by LC 2 
were erroneously posted in the DICT books on 31 March 2020, as a debit to Cash- 

Treasury/Agency Deposit, Regular account instead of Cash in Bank-Local Currency, 

Current Account; thus, the Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, Regular account was 

overstated by ₱120,072.75 while the Cash in Bank-Local Currency, Current Account was 

understated by same amount. 

 

57. Overall, the reported balance of the DICT’s Cash accounts was understated by an 
approximate amount of ₱67,952,009.85. Due to the afore-cited accounting 

errors/omissions  and  improper declaration of cash in bank, Management assertions as to 



19  

completeness, existence, classification, accuracy, understandability, cut-off, rights and 

obligations of the reported Cash balance as at 30 November 2020 were doubtful. 

 

58. We reiterated our prior year’s recommendations, with modification, that 
Management: 

 

a. Require the Finance Service and Accounting Division to: 
 

i. request from the bank copies of Debit Memoranda and locate other 
supporting documents as bases in recording the identified reconciling 

items; 

 

ii. timely prepare and submit monthly Bank Reconciliation Statements for 
each bank account and ensure that the book balances used in the 

reconciliation are those reflected in the subsidiary and general ledgers; 

 

iii. strictly monitor the FOOs’ submission of CRReg and CBReg, timely 
review and record in the books the transactions reported therein to 

ensure that all FOO transactions are recognized in the books of 

accounts during the periods to which they relate; 

 

iv. conduct thorough investigation to determine the causes of unaccounted 
variances, especially those disbursements/withdrawals charged to 

Account Nos. 0232-1100-74 and 0232-1115-18, locate disbursement 

vouchers, effect the necessary accounting entries, and if warranted, 

demand restitution of determined amounts from officials/employees 

accountable therefor and file appropriate legal charges against them; 

 

v. coordinate with the FOOs and conduct regular reconciliation of DICT- 
CO and FOO records on fund transfers and disbursements, collections 

and deposits, including establishment, replenishment and settlement of 

FOO petty cash funds and immediately take up in the books the 

unrecorded prior years’ and current year’s transactions based on 

adequate supporting documents; 

 

vi. make the necessary accounting entries to reclassify the outstanding 
balances of fund transfers made by the DICT-CO to the FOOs as Cash 

in Bank-Local Currency, Current Account, and henceforth, record 

transfers of funds to FOOs under the same account, until formal 

instructions/guidelines/ directives are issued and FOOs are properly 

oriented regarding the decentralization of the DICT’s Accounting 

System; and 

 

vii. prepare the necessary adjusting entries to correct the misstatements in 
recording deposits and collections, and to cancel the journal entry 

pertaining to the collections and deposits of the dishonored checks; 



20  

b. Enjoin the FOOs to: (a) maintain Cash in Bank Register (CBReg) and Cash 
Receipts Register (CRReg) to record disbursements, collections and 

deposits chronologically; (b) keep the register updated; and (c) religiously 

submit certified copies thereof together with the required supporting 

documents within five (5) days after the end of each month to the DICT- 

CO Accounting Division for review and recording in the books of accounts; 

 

c. Issue policy/guidelines on the recognition of training fees directly deposited 
by clients to DICT’s bank accounts including the issuance of Official 

Receipts for those amounts with unidentified payees. The policy should, 

likewise, define the conditions and period when the Department can 

reasonably forfeit the unclaimed training fees for reversion to the General 

Fund of the National Government; 

 

d. Direct the Internal Audit Service (IAS) or any concerned office to revisit, 
evaluate and strengthen the existing internal control system affecting 

financial transactions and draft proposed internal policy/guidelines to 

facilitate the recording of various transactions in the books of accounts, 

incorporating therein applicable laws, rules and regulations. 

 

e. Issue directives and guidelines towards the decentralization of the 
accounting system and properly orient all concerned DICT officials and 

employees so as not to create confusion and towards the smooth and 

efficient transition; and 

 

f. Assign sufficient personnel to perform all the needed tasks in the 
Accounting Division of the DICT-CO as well as in the FOOs. 

 

59. As of this report, the Audit Team has not received any Management comment 
pertaining to the foregoing observations and recommendations. 

 

Misstatements on Receivable accounts - ₱317,704,940.00

Total Accounting Misstatement for Receivable Accounts (317,704,940.00) 

 

61. The amount of ₱2,000,000.00 transferred by the DICT to the Philippine Institute 
for Development Studies (PIDS) for the conduct of the Expanded Data Analysis and Policy 

Research of the National ICT Household Survey 2019 was erroneously debited to Due from 

NGAs instead of Due from GOCCs since PIDS is a government corporation established by 

virtue of PD 1201. 

 

62. In addition, as earlier discussed under the Cash account, fund transfers of the DICT- 
CO to FOOs for the latter’s monthly operating expenses amounting to ₱327,107,877.27 

were incorrectly debited to Due from Regional Offices account instead of CIB – LCCA 

account. 

 

63. Likewise, the rent/lease income from the lease of DICT assets by DITO for July to 
November, 2020 totaling ₱9,781,650.00 were not recorded in the books of accounts due to 

lack of coordination between the General Services Division (GSD) and Cashier’s Office 

such that the documents necessary in the recognition of income was not transmitted on 

time to the Accounting Division for recording, leading to the understatement of Operating 

Lease Receivable and Rent/Lease Income by said amount. 
 

64. We learned that there was no clear-cut policy on the above transactions and the 
Offices concerned have no defined functions. Firstly, the GSD received checks from the 

Client which should be the function of the Cashier’s Office. Secondly, it is not clear 

whether the Records Archive Section should transmit automatically to the concerned 

Offices the copies of contracts or if there is a need to wait for requests coming from Offices 

in need of the contracts. Thirdly, the GSD failed to document their request for copies of 

contracts, hence, they cannot prove that a request has been made. Lastly, it is not clear 

which Office/Officer has the responsibility to inform the Client on the manner of payment 

(if not included in the Contract), thus, such problem occurred. 

 

65. As provided by law, it is the direct responsibility of the agency head to institute, to 
install, implement, and monitor a sound system of internal control. The lack of coordination 

between the concerned offices which resulted in the non-recording of income clearly shows 

the absence of a sound internal control system which may pose risks of possible 

mishandling of government resources. 



22  

66. We recommended that Management require: 
 

a. The Accountant to draw JEVs to reclassify the amount of ₱2,000,000.00 
from Due from NGAs account to Due from GOCCs account, and the 

₱327,107,877.27 fund transfer to FOOs from Due from Regional Offices 

account  to  CIB  -  LCCA  account,  and  record  the  rent/lease  income of 

₱9,781,650.00 from DITO; 

 

b. The GSD, Cashier’s Office and Accounting Division to coordinate for the 
proper handling of lease contracts, documents and payments; and 

 

c. The Internal Audit Service (IAS) or any concerned office to evaluate the 
existing internal control system and craft proposed policies which will 

address the issues concerning the proper flow of documents, delineation of 

the functions and responsibilities of every Office/Officer, and other 

guidelines which are deemed necessary for the orderly execution and 

recording of transactions. 
 

67. Moreover, we recommended that the appropriate office issue the necessary 
policies recommended by the IAS or any concerned office, if any, for guidance of the 

DICT personnel and ensure compliance therewith. 

 

Management comments: 

 

68. As for the misclassification of accounts, the Accounting Division already effected 
the necessary adjusting entries with JEV No. GJ-20-12-431 dated 31 December 2020 in 

the amount of ₱2,000,000.00. Concerning the unrecorded accrued rent/lease income from 

lease of assets, the GSD will immediately transmit the checks issued by DITO, together 

with its supporting documents, to the Cash Division and refrain from accepting any 

payment as it is not the GSD’s function. With regard to the issuance of the necessary check 

covering the security deposits as agreed in the contracts, the GSD has already informed 

DITO through a letter dated 15 April 2021. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

69. We could not validate Management’s reply/comments due to their non-submission 
of the December 2020 TBs and FSs.

71. Section 17, Chapter 8, Volume I of the GAM, prescribes the use of the Report of 
Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI) which shall be prepared by the Property and/or 

Supply Custodian based on the Requisition and Issue Slip (RIS) to report/summarize all 

issuance of inventories (by stock number) during the day. At the end of the month, all 

RSMIs shall be consolidated by the Accounting Division/Unit which is then used as basis 

in preparing the JEV to record the supplies and materials issued. 

 

72. The amounts of ₱157,280.00 and ₱347,900.00 were purchases which were 
subsequently issued to end-users but the issuances totaling ₱505,180.00 were not recorded 

in the books, while the amount of ₱5,747,758.22 and ₱2,533,926.17 were the total RSMIs 

and Inventory Custodian Slips (ICSs) issued during the year which were, likewise, not 

recorded as expense. 

 

73. The above deficiencies may have been brought about by the non-submission of 
RSMIs by the PPMD regularly to the Accounting Division for recording, and sometimes, 

even though the PPMD has submitted the RSMIs, the Accounting personnel record these 

only at the end of the year. 

 

74. On the other hand, the procured computer equipment with a total cost of 
₱29,961,999.14 intended for distribution to schools under the Tech4Ed program were 

erroneously recorded as PPE instead of Property and Equipment for Distribution, due to 

non-awareness of the program and purpose of the procurement. 

 

75. In summary, the unrecorded inventory issuances totaling ₱8,786,864.39 
(₱505,180.00+₱5,747,758.22+₱2,533,926.17) overstated the inventory accounts and 

understated the related expense accounts, while the error in recording the acquired PPE for 

distribution overstated the PPE account Office Equipment and understated the inventory 

account Property and Equipment for Distribution, resulting in a net understatement of 

₱21,175,134.75 in the inventory account. 



24  

76. We recommended that Management require the Accounting Division to 
record correctly and completely all issuances of inventories in CY 2020 and prior 

years based on adequate supporting documents and reclassify the procured PPE 

intended for distribution from PPE to inventory account. 

 

77. As of this report, the Audit Team has not received any Management comment 
pertaining to the foregoing observations and recommendations. 

 

Misstatements on PPE accounts - ₱99,046,624.63

Total Accounting Misstatements for PPE Accounts (99,046,624.63) 
 

79. COA Circular No. 2020-001 dated 08 January 2020 was issued to prescribe the 
Volume III-Revised Chart of Accounts (Updated 2019) of the GAM for NGAs. The 

Revised Chart of Accounts (Updated 2019) provides additional accounts and modified 

account codes and descriptions to facilitate proper recognition of financial transactions in 

the books of accounts and preclude misuse of accounts. 

 

80. During the year, DICT procured PPE totaling ₱562,727,461.15. Out of this amount, 
₱34,243,591.58 were inadvertently misclassified from one PPE account to another 

resulting  in  the  over/understatement  of  affected  PPE  accounts  while  the  amount  of 

₱29,961,999.14 computers for distribution was erroneously recorded as Office Equipment 



25  

instead of inventory account, thus, with all errors considered, it resulted in a net 

overstatement of PPE accounts by ₱29,553,589.14. 

 

81. On the other hand, the non-computation and inadequate provision of depreciation 
charges by at least ₱60,868,666.70 representing current year’s depreciation of 

approximately ₱50,220,896.38 and for prior year’s depreciation amounting to at least 

₱10,647,770.32 understated the Depreciation Expense and Accumulated Depreciation 

accounts and consequently overstated the book values of the affected PPE accounts by the 

same amount. 

 

82. Likewise, depreciation on PPEs with total value of ₱2,566,513,832.12 pertaining 
to balances as at 01 January 2016, absorbed from the defunct Information and 

Communications Technology Office (ICTO) without SLs/PPE Ledger Cards (PPELCs) 

were not provided since the pertinent records/documents were not located, thus, no basis 

in the computation of depreciation. 

 

83. Moreover, despite the previous years’ audit recommendations, the Accounting 
Division still failed to derecognize the unserviceable PPEs disposed in CYs 2017 and 2018 

with net book value of ₱8,624,368.79 due to the non-submission of the Inventory and 

Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) and other pertinent documents by 

the General Services Division to the Accounting Division. 

 

84. We recommended that Management require: 
 

a. The Accounting Division to: 
 

i. record completely and correctly all PPEs acquired during the year and 
effect the necessary accounting entries to correct the noted errors in 

recording of PPE duly supported with sufficient documents; 

 

ii. compute the depreciation for all the depreciable PPEs in conformity 
with Section 27, Chapter 10 of the GAM, Volume I, and effect the 

necessary accounting entries to provide adequate depreciation for the 

affected PPE accounts; 

 

iii. derecognize the carrying value of the disposed PPEs from the books of 
accounts; and 

 

iv. fast track the gathering of pertinent records/documents pertaining to 
the PPEs with total value of ₱2,566,513,832.12 absorbed from the 

defunct ICTO, prepare corresponding PPELCs based on the 

documents gathered, and provide the necessary depreciation for said 

PPEs; and 

 

b. The Property/Supply Officer to submit the IIRUP/s and pertinent 
documents to the Accounting Division.

87. Included in the observations in the CYs 2018 and 2019 CAARs were the presence 
of training costs, and repairs and maintenance expenses, as well as the expired software 

license subscriptions, in the reported balance of the Intangible Assets - Computer Software 

account which were not yet reclassified as at 30 November 2020 to appropriate expenses 

account and subsequently closed to Accumulated Surplus / (Deficit) as at year-end. 

 

88. Moreover, due to the absence of Management’s considerable effort to assess the 
useful lives of its purchased software items, amortizations of the DICT’s computer 

software items acquired in the years 2017 to 2019 as well as the intangible assets that were 

absorbed from ICTO, were not computed and recorded in the books of accounts. 

 

89. In view of the absence of information on the useful lives of the computer software 
supposed to be determined by Management, we computed the amortization using the 

estimated useful life based on the number of years of the license period, if clearly stated, 

or the maximum useful life of ten (10) years based on the provisions of Section 9, Chapter 

12, Volume I of the GAM and came up with the calculation of Amortization Expenses of 

at least ₱38,080,921.19 and Accumulated Amortization - Computer Software account of at 

least ₱155,420,323.18 as at 30 November 2020. 

 

90. The continuous non-provision and non-recording of amortization has caused the 
overstatement of the carrying value of the Computer Software account and the balance of 

the Accumulated Surplus/Deficit account by at least ₱155,420,323.18 and 

₱117,339,401.99, respectively. Furthermore, the accounts Amortization - Intangible Assets 

and Accumulated Amortization - Computer Software were understated by approximate 

amounts of ₱38,080,921.19 and ₱155,420,323.18, respectively. 



27  

91. We reiterated our prior year’s recommendations, with modification, that 
Management require: 

 

a. The Accounting Division to: 
 

i. draw a JEV to derecognize the non-capitalizable costs included in 
the Computer Software account; and 

 

ii. compute the correct amortization expense for each computer 
software based on their assessed useful life, using the straight-line 

method and record on a timely basis and draw JEV to recognize the 

accumulated amortization; and 

 

b. The General Service Division or any appropriate office to 
estimate/assess the useful life of the computer software and provide the 

relevant information to the Accounting Division to facilitate the 

computation and recording of the amortization. 

 

Management comments: 

 

92. The GSD will coordinate with the Management Information System Service 
(MISS) in assessing the average life span of the computer software and provide the 

necessary information on the computation and recording of amortization of the computer 

software to the Accounting Division. 

 

Accounting Deficiencies 

 

Unaccounted balances of assets and liabilities 

 

93. The asset and liability accounts with total values of ₱5,686,966,644.65 and 
₱409,757,685.87, respectively, as at 30 November 2020, remained unaccounted in view 

of unavailability of sufficient supporting documents, absence or non-maintenance of 

prescribed accounting records, and inability by Management to reconcile/account for 

the prior years’ balances absorbed from its predecessor agency, thus, negatively 

affecting Management’s assertions on the existence, accuracy, rights and obligations 

and completeness of reported account balances. 
 

94. Section 110 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 provides that government 
accounting shall aim to: (1) produce information concerning past operations and present 

conditions; (2) provide a basis for guidance for future operations; (3) provide for control 

of the acts of public bodies and officers in the receipt, disposition and utilization of funds 

and property; and (4) report on the financial position and the results of operations of 

government agencies for the information of all persons concerned. 

 

95. Section 111 provides that: (1) the accounts of an agency shall be kept in such detail 
as is necessary to meet the needs of the agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish 



28  

the information needed by fiscal or control agencies of the government; and (2) the highest 

standards of honesty, objectivity and consistency shall be observed in the keeping of 

accounts to safeguard against inaccurate or misleading information. 

 

96. COA Circular No. 92-375 dated 09 March 1992 prescribes the accounting 
guidelines for the closing of books of accounts of 

abolished/transferred/merged/consolidated/converted/sub-divided agencies and the 

opening of books of accounts for the agencies affected by such 

abolition/transfer/merger/consolidation/conversion/subdivision pursuant to provisions of 

law. 

 

97. Despite previous recommendations to address the unaccounted account balances, 
to which Management agreed, still, unaccounted balances exist in the DICT’s books of 

accounts as at 30 November 2020, due to lack of information and documents on the 

forwarded balances from the predecessor agency, as shown in Table18 below.

by DICT even in the absence of important information 
including the names of payees, nature and coverage of 
prepayments. This should be analyzed by the Accounting 
Division and effect necessary adjusting entries to recognize 
the expensed portion, if any.

Visayas Cluster 1 (6,547.41) This amount has SL however the details such as JEV, 
particulars and date of recording were not indicated in the 
SL and possible correcting entries could not be determined. 
Moreover, the name of the collecting officer was unknown, 
thus accountability could not be established. This was 
discussed in AOM No.  2021-016  (2020)  dated 13    April 
2021. 

Due from 
Officers and 
Employees 

TelOf-NCR (832.90) This balance was the net effect of transactions in CY 2013 
which stayed in the ICTO books and then absorbed by the 
DICT, with no details as to names of officers and/or 
employees. 

ICTO (2,226.74) The amount in the SL pertained to transaction recorded in 
CY 2013 which stayed in the ICTO books and then 
absorbed by the DICT, with no details as to names of 
officers and/or employees. 

Luzon Cluster 3 (21,054.00) The amounts were the caused by the recorded 
transactions in CY 2019, with no details as to names of 
officers and/or employees. 

Mindanao Cluster 2 (51.24) 

Receivables- 
Disallowance/

Visayas Cluster 2 (17,600.00) The SL was not named to the person liable but was 
recorded with no corresponding receivable previously 
recognized. 

Other 
Receivables 

Mindanao Cluster 1 (834,999.32) Per SL, the balance pertained to payments from different 
employees which were recorded in the books in CY 2020. 

Mindanao Cluster 2 (749,137.54) Based on the SL, the balance was caused by various 
transactions recorded in CYs 2015 to 2019. 

Advances to 
Special 
Disbursing 
Officers 

Mindanao Cluster 3 (132,519.24) To record the transfer of book balances as of 31 December 
2014 of Mindanao Cluster 3 to ICTO-CO which was later on 
absorbed by DICT. The balance has no details and could 
not be traced to any accountable officer, making it difficult 
to verify the cause of such negative balance and determine 
the necessary correcting entries to reflect in the books of 
accounts. This was discussed in AOM No. 2021- 014 
(2015-2020) dated 06 April 2021. 

Advances to 
Officers and 
Employees 

Luzon Cluster 3 (858.30) The amount in the SL pertained to the transaction recorded 
in CY 2017. No SL was prepared and maintained for the 
name of the accountable officer. 

Mindanao Cluster 2 (490.00) The amount pertained to the collection of advances 
recorded in CY 2016 which stayed in the ICTO books and 
then absorbed by the DICT, with no details as to the name 
of accountable officer/s. 

Total (1,766,316.69)

99. The substantial amounts of unaccounted balances were traced from the ICTO 
accounts absorbed by DICT indicating that DICT did not strictly comply with COA 

Circular No. 92-3751 dated 09 March 1992, as apparently, the absorbed amounts were not 

completely analyzed and reconciled and accountabilities not fully liquidated, resulting in 

the continuous inclusion of these accounts in the DICT-CO books of accounts without 

SLs/ledger cards, details and/or breakdown. 

 

100. The Accountant reasoned then that there was difficulty in tracing the details of the 
accounts and retrieval of documents since there was no proper reconciliation made before 

the transfer. However, it was emphasized that the approval of the JEV transferring the 

accounts from ICTO to DICT, effectively assigned DICT the full responsibility over the 

accounts and in ensuring the full accounting and liquidation of cash advances. 

 

101. It is worth mentioning that in CY 2019, a Task Force on the COA Finding Closure 
(TF-CFC) was created by Management through Department Order (DO) No. 081 dated  

26 November 2019 to facilitate the planning, implementing, monitoring and reporting of 

activities. The Task Force was assigned with specific responsibilities, among which, were 

to recommend solutions (business process improvements/changes, policy changes/updates, 

acquisition of system/application, hiring of consultant/s) to the root causes and create a 

detailed work plan for immediate implementation and to submit a final report on COA 

findings. However, no report yet was furnished to the Audit Team. 

 

102. As a result, the unavailability of accounting records and insufficiency of 
documentary support necessary for the verification of accounts cast doubt on the existence, 

accuracy and understandability of several accounts reported in the books. 

 

103. We recommended that Management: 

 
a. Mobilize the TF-CFC or direct any appropriate office to: 

 

i. execute the devised plan, if any, specifically for the purpose of 
determining the pertinent information and details of the 

aforementioned unaccounted balances; 

 

ii. provide the Accounting Division with pertinent information and details 
that may be discovered during the implementation of the plan; 

 

iii. evaluate if the account balances are qualified for write-off, pursuant to 
COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated 19 December 2016, and consider 

complying with the prescribed guidelines/procedures therein; and 
 

 

 
 

 

1Subject: Accounting guidelines and procedures for the closing of books of accounts of 
abolished/transferred/merged/consolidated/converted/sub-divided agencies and the opening of books of 

accounts for agencies affected by such abolition/transfer/merger/consolidation/conversion/ subdivision 

pursuant to provisions of law. 



36  

iv. submit updates to the Audit Team with the status of implementation 
and progress of the plan; 

 

b. Issue a directive requiring the Accountant and other concerned 
officials/employees in the DICT-CO and/or FOOs to: 

 

i. coordinate with the TF-CFC or any appropriate office in determining 
the pertinent information and details of the unaccounted balances; and 

 

ii. collaborate with the IAS in the preparation of proposed internal 
control procedure/policies, if warranted; and 

 

c. Require the Accounting Division to: 
 

i. verify and analyze information and details submitted by the TF-CFC 
or any appropriate office, if any; 

 

ii. prepare schedules, subsidiary ledgers, Supplies, PPE and CIP Ledger 
Cards showing details/breakdown to support the account balances 

using the prescribed format by the GAM; 

 

iii. conduct thorough investigation to determine the causes of unaccounted 
variances, especially those disbursements/withdrawals charged to 

Account No. 0702-1054-55, locate disbursement vouchers, effect the 

necessary accounting entries, and if warranted, demand restitution of 

determined amounts from officials/employees accountable therefor 

and file appropriate legal charges against them; 

 

iv. require immediate submission by the FOOs of the report of remittances 
to the DICT-CO; and 

 

v. effect necessary adjusting entries to reflect the correct and proper 
balances of all affected accounts in the books accounts, such as the 

recognition of prior year expenses pertaining to the Prepayment 

accounts duly supported with sufficient documents. 

 

104. As of this report, the Audit Team has not received any Management comment 
pertaining to the foregoing observations and recommendations.

cancelled OR with OR Number 
20DICT00002449 dated 01 
October 2020 were not attached to 
the Report of Collections and 
Deposits. 

Chapter IV, Letter B, Number 1.1.3 of the Revised Cash 
Examination Manual which mandates the Auditor to ascertain that 
the original and duplicate copies of cancelled ORs or accountable 
forms are submitted with corresponding Report/Abstract of 
Collections or equivalent. 

LC 2 b)  Collections totaling  ₱147,348.20 
were not deposited daily and intact 
with the authorized depository 
bank. 

Section 32, Chapter II of the Revised Cash Examination Manual 
provides that all Collecting Officers (COs) shall deposit intact all 
their collections, as well as collections turned over to them by sub- 
collectors/tellers, with AGDB daily or not later than the next 
banking day. Where collections are minimal and daily deposit 
thereof becomes costly and impractical, the COs shall deposit their 
collections at least once a week, or as soon as the collections 
reach ₱10,000.00. 

CO Accounts 
Receivables 

a)    Failure  of  Management  to assess 
the collectability of its Accounts 
receivables and provide 
appropriate and supported 
allowance for impairment. 

Section 6, Chapter 5, Volume I of the GAM defines revenue from 
exchange transactions as those received by national government 
agencies from exchange transactions such as those derived from 
provision of services which are recognized as Service Income, 
including Permit Fees, Licensing Fees, Supervision and 
Regulation Enforcement Fees, Spectrum Usage Fees, Inspection 
Fees, among others; and Business Income which includes among 
others, Affiliation Fees, Examination Fees, Seminar/Training Fees, 
Rent/Lease Income. 

 
IPSAS 9 provides the accounting standards for Revenue from 
Exchange Transactions. Paragraph 32 thereof provides that 
revenue is recognized only when it is probable that the economic 
benefits or service potential associated with the transaction will 
flow to the entity. In some cases, this may not be probable until 
the consideration is received or until an uncertainty is removed. 
However, when an uncertainty arises about the collectability of an 
amount already included in revenue, the uncollectable amount (or 
the amount in respect of which recovery has ceased to be 
probable) is recognized as an expense, rather than as an 
adjustment of the amount of revenue originally recognized. 

 

Under Section 9, Chapter 5, Volume I of the GAM, the recognition 
of expense for amounts recognized as revenue with uncertainty 
about its collectability is done through the recognition of 
Impairment Losses and Allowance for Impairment Losses. 

 
Further, Section 10, Chapter 7 of the same Manual provides that 
an entity shall assess at the end of each reporting period whether 
there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or group of 
financial assets is impaired. If any such evidence exists, the entity 
shall measure the amount of loss as the difference between the 
carrying amount of the asset and the present value of estimated 
future cash flows discounted at the financial asset’s original 
effective interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset shall be 
reduced either directly or through use of an allowance account. 
The amount of the loss shall be recognized in surplus or deficit. In 
case of Accounts Receivable, the Allowance for Impairment shall 
be provided in an amount based on collectability of receivable 
balances and evaluation of such factors as aging of accounts, 
collection experiences of the agency, expected loss experiences 
and identified doubtful accounts.

Accounts Deficiency Standard/Criteria 

CO  b) Incomplete Subsidiary Ledger Section 12, Chapter 2, Volume I of the GAM enumerates the books 
of accounts to be maintained by national government agencies, 
one of which is the SL. Appendix 6, Volume II of the GAM states 
that the SL shows the details for each control account in the GL 
which is maintained per account by the Accounting Unit. At the end 
of each month, after all transactions in the journals have been 
posted, the debit and credit columns of each account shall be 
footed in pencil and the balance indicated in ink. The totals of the 
SL balances shall be reconciled with the corresponding GL 
controlling account. 

CO Due from NGAs a) Significant  delays  in  recording  of 
liquidations. 

Section 6, Chapter 19, Volume I of the GAM provides the 
qualitative characteristics of financial reporting, such as relevance, 
timeliness and reliability. An information is relevant to users if it 
can be used to assist in evaluating past, present or future events 
or in confirming, or correcting, past evaluations. In order to be 
relevant, information must also be timely. On the other hand, a 
reliable information is free from material error and bias, and can be 
depended on by users to represent faithfully that which it purports 
to represent or could reasonably be expected to represent. 

b)  Non-submission of Certified True 
Copy (CTC) of the original 
Liquidation Report (LR) and Official 
Receipt or equivalent document 
evidencing the return of the 
unexpended/unutilized fund of the 
said project/s 

COA Circular No. 94-013 dated 13 December 1994 prescribing the 
Rules and Regulations in the Grant, Utilization and Liquidation of 
Funds Transferred to Implementing Agencies was issued to 
ensure that (a) the transfer is properly taken up in the books of 
both agencies (b) the transferred funds are used only for the 
intended purpose and that (c) proper accounting and reporting is 
made of the utilization of the funds. It also states that the SA need 
to require the IA to submit the reports and furnish the IA with a 
copy of the Journal Voucher (JV) taking up the expenditures. Upon 
receipt of the copy of the Certificate of Settlement and Balances 
(CSB) and the Credit Notice (CN) issued by the IA Auditor, the 
Accountant shall draw a journal voucher restoring back the amount 
previously credited. The SA shall then furnish the IA with copy of 
JV and issue the OR for the unexpended balance. 

c)  Unliquidated/undelivered   prior 
years’ balances of fund transfers 
Recording of deliveries from DBM- 
PS in lumped amount 

Section 111 of PD 1445 requires that the accounts of an agency 
shall be kept in such detail as is necessary to meet the needs of 
the agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish the 
information needed by fiscal or control agencies of the 
government. It further states that the highest standards of honesty, 
objectivity and consistency shall be observed in the keeping of 
accounts to safeguard against inaccurate or misleading 
information. 

 

Executive Order No. 40, s. 2001 provides that agencies shall 
procure common-use supplies, materials and equipment from the 
PS-DBM, in accordance with Letter of Instructions No. 755, 
Executive Order Nos. 289 series of 1987, 359 series of 1989, and

Accounting Division/Unit. A certified copy of the previously paid 
DVs shall be attached to the request for replacement. A JEV shall 
be prepared to take up the cancellation. The replacement check 
shall be reported in the RCI. 

 

106. Interview with a DICT personnel disclosed that the Accounting Division is manned 
by three (3) regular and five (5) Job Order employees. However, it was not clarified as to 

who are in-charge of the recording of all collection and disbursement transactions, and the 

preparation of the required financial reports. We have requested for Management’s 

comments but they have not submitted their reply. With the significant volume of 

accounting transactions vis-à-vis the number of available personnel, the Accounting 

Division could not properly and fully perform its mandated functions. 

 

107. We recommended that Management, through the Human Resource 
Management Division (HRMD), fast-track its recruitment process, prioritizing the 

human resource needs of the Accounting Division. 

 

108. We also recommended that Management:

Management’s comments: 

Re: Accounts Receivable 

109. The unaccounted, unsupported variance were based on the SLs of the predecessor 
agencies absorbed by the DICT. There are no accurate or updated documents to validate 

their SL. Since these balances remained unverified, the DICT is constrained from updating 

or accurately identifying the specific details that would account for or support each 

receivable. 

 

110. The Accounting Division reported that they were constrained from updating and 
reconciling the SL on time due to the lack of accurate documents of these balances turned 

over from defunct agencies to DICT. 

 

Re: Due from NGAs (PS-DBM) 

 

111. The report prepared by the PPMD is a lumped amount because there are no 
personnel available to handle the monitoring of the deliveries against the APR. This is the 

basis of recording by the Accounting Division. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

112. In view of PPMD’s admission that a lumped amount was included in the Report 
(since there are no personnel available to handle the monitoring of the deliveries against 

the APR), we further recommend that Management require: 

 

a. The PPMD to match the deliveries upon inspection with the APR and 
reconcile records with the Accounting Division; and 

 

b. The Accounting Division to reconcile the APRs of the delivered items with 
the records supporting the JEVs of the fund transfers to the PS-DBM to 

prevent the accumulation of unreconciled/unaccounted amounts in the Due 

from NGAs account. 

 

Compliance Audit 

 

Idle/unutilized cash and non-remittance of collections to the BTr 

 

113. Despite the previous year’s audit recommendation, Cash In Bank totaling 
₱255,645,642.98, which comprised of unutilized/ idle cash in bank of the CO of 

₱1,393,781.47,  excess  balances  of  training  fees  collections  with  bank  balance  of

unauthorized/unnecessary Cash In Bank accounts of FOOs of ₱236,603,652.15 as at 

31 December 2020 were maintained in the depository bank and remained unremitted 

to the National Treasury. 

 

114. Paragraph 2.1 of the DOF-DBM-COA Permanent Committee Joint Circular (JC) 
No. 4-2012 dated 11 September 2012 states that, all income collected by agencies by virtue 

of the provisions of law, orders and regulations shall be deposited in the National Treasury 

and shall accrue to the unappropriated surplus of the General Fund of the Government. 

Section 3.4 thereof defines unnecessary special and trust funds to refer to authorized special 

and trust funds maintained by government agencies with AGDBs but which are no longer 

necessary for the attainment of the purposes for which said funds were established, i.e., 

specific projects/programs, the implementation of which have been completed or 

abandoned. 

 

115. COA Circular No. 2015-001 dated 29 January 2015 prescribes the guidelines and 
procedures in the “Reversion to the General Fund of all Dormant Cash, Unauthorized 

Accounts, Unnecessary Special and Trust Funds and Related Accounts, in conformity with 

the Permanent Committee Joint Circular No. 4-2012 dated 11 September 2012 

implementing Executive Order No. 431 dated 30 May 2005”. Section 3 thereof provides 

the procedural guidelines to be undertaken by NGAs with dormant cash/unauthorized 

accounts and unnecessary special and trust funds including recipients of inter-agency fund 

transfers, starting from the thorough analysis of the cash accounts, providing cash account 

mapping and/or grouping the cash accounts up to the disposition of the said accounts/funds. 

 

116. Section 2 of EO 338, series of 1996, provides that, all government offices and 
agencies are hereby required to immediately transfer all public moneys deposited with 

depository banks and other institutions to the BTr, regardless of income source. 

 

117. Section 12 of the General Provisions of the General Appropriations Act (GAA) for 
CY 2020, requires Departments and other agencies of the Government which conduct 

training programs in relation to their mandated functions to deposit the proceeds derived 

therefrom with the National Treasury as income of the General Fund pursuant to Section 

44, Chapter 5, Book VI of EO 292. However, the agencies which do not have 

appropriations in their budgets for the purpose may use the proceeds for the conduct of the 

said seminar, conference, training, or oath taking activities subject to budgeting, accounting 

and auditing rules and regulations. Any excess proceeds shall be deposited with the 

National Treasury as income of the General Fund. 

 

118. The DICT Central Office maintains with the Land Bank of the Philippines bank 
accounts which are already dormant totaling ₱1,393,781.47 and the unutilized training fees 

amounting to ₱17,648,209.36, or a total of ₱19,041,990.83, while at the FOOs, the amount 

of cash at banks of ₱236,603,652.15 were still maintained without legal basis, as follows:

119. The continuous practice of unauthorized, unnecessary and unutilized balance of 
cash receipts deprived the National Government from the use of idle cash deposited in the 

AGDB for other priority projects and defeated the purpose of the Government which is to 

maximize the use of its financial resources. Moreover, the National Government continues 

to borrow funds when there are huge cash immobilized and deposited in AGDBs which 

should had been used for operations of the Government. 



45  

120. We reiterated our prior year’s recommendations, with modification, that 
Management: 

 

a. Cause the return to the National Treasury of the unauthorized/ 
dormant/unnecessary cash in bank balances of the DICT-CO and FOOs 

amounting to ₱19,041,990.83 and ₱236,603,652.15, respectively, following 

the steps provided in COA Circular No. 2015-001 dated 29 January 2015 

in relation to DOF-DBM-COA Permanent Committee JC No. 4-2012 dated 

11 September 2012; and 

 

b. Direct the Accountant of the DICT-CO to prepare and submit to the DBM 
a report on the fees collected and expenses incurred relative to all the 

trainings conducted by the Department, and, henceforth, regularly submit 

such report upon the conclusion of every seminar or training and promptly 

remit excess balances of training fees to the BTr. 
 

121. As of this report, the Audit Team has not received any Management comment 
pertaining to the foregoing observations and recommendations. 

 

Non-compliance with rules and regulations on cash advances 

 

122. The non-adherence to pertinent laws, rules and regulations on the granting, 
utilization, liquidation and recording of cash advances resulted in the significant 

amount of unliquidated balances, indicating weak internal control and exposes 

government funds to possible risks of loss or misuse. 
 

123. COA Circular No. 97-0022 dated 10 February 1997 provides, among others, the 
following rules and regulations on the granting, utilization and liquidation of cash 

advances: 

 

4.1.2 No additional cash advance shall be allowed to any official or employee 
unless the previous cash advance given to him is first settled or a proper 

accounting thereof is made.3 
 

4.1.3 A cash advance shall be reported on as soon as the purpose for which it was 
given has been served. 

 

4.1.4 Transfer of cash advance from one (1) Accountable Officer (AO) to another 
shall not be allowed. 

 

4.3.1  The cash advance shall be sufficient for the recurring expenses of the agency 

for one (1) month. 
 

 
 

2 Restatement with amendments of the rules and regulations on the granting, utilization and liquidation of 
cash advances provided under COA Circular No. 90-331 dated 03 May 1990. 
3  Reiterated in Section 89, Chapter 4 of PD 1445. 



46  

5.1      Failure of the AO to liquidate his cash advance within the prescribed period 

shall constitute a valid cause for the withholding of his salary and the 

instruction of other sanctions as provided for under paragraphs 9.2 and 9.3 

hereof. 

 

5.7      When a cash advance is no longer needed or has not been used for a  period 

of two (2) months, it must be returned to or refunded immediately to the 

collecting officer. 

 

124. As at 30 November 2020, the DICT’s Advances accounts had a total balance of 
₱45,129,734.71, broken down as follows:

respectively. 

Due to lack of manpower, 
subsidiary ledgers were not timely

making and planning purposes. 

1,741,237.86 

LC1 Additional cash advances were 
granted to the Cashiers even when 
their previous cash advances were not 
yet settled. 

Due to simultaneous activities that 
need to be financed by cash 
advances and delayed liquidations 
of the AOs. 

 

LC2 Transfer of cash advance from one 
officer to another was allowed, thus 
exposing government funds to 
possible risk of loss or misuse. 

Accountable Officer could not 
personally handle the cash 
advances of the different provinces 
considering the distance of travel to 
and from those areas from his 
present assignment, thus the 
transfer of cash advance to another 
personnel. There were personnel 
assigned in the provinces, however 
most of these personnel were job 
orders and others were permanent 
employee but were not qualified to 
hold cash advances. 

 

LC3 Multiple and/or series of cash 
advances for special/time-bound 
projects were still granted to 
Accountable Officers and liquidation. 
thereof were beyond the prescribed 
period with delays ranging from 57 to 
688 days. 

Management commented that the 
deficiency in the granting and 
liquidation of cash advances is due 
to the number of projects that 
needs to be implemented 
simultaneously, the lack of 
accounting personnel to handle the

  processes and lack of organic 
bonded personnel. Some of the 
cash advances are still to be used 
in different provinces for their 
trainings and for operating 
expenses. The implementation of 
the trainings was greatly affected 
due to COVID-19 and the late 
download of funds. 

 

VC1 Non-liquidation of prior year’s cash 
advances granted to the SDO 
amounting to ₱51,000.00 as of 
December 31, 2020 resulted in the 
non-recording of expenses during the 
period it was incurred and exposed 
government funds to the risk of loss 
and/or misuse. 

The Accountable Officer was not 
able to immediately liquidate the 
cash advance in CY 2019 since the 
activity was held in the last quarter 
of the year, together with other 
year-end activities. Furthermore, 
due to the COVID pandemic in CY 
2020, the Accountable Officer was 
not able to prioritize the liquidation 
of his cash advances despite 
regular reminders from the 
Accounting Section. 

51,000.00 

MC3 Cash advances granted to the Special 
Disbursing Officer were transferred to 
the Project Engineers without proper 
authority and fidelity bond. 

As disclosed by the 
Cashier/Disbursing Officer, he was 
not aware that delegation of funds 
to another person without proper 
authority and fidelity bond is 
prohibited considering he just 
assumed as the new 
cashier/disbursing officer and no 
seminars were attended due to the 
pandemic situation. 

 

Total  ₱52,689,225.98 
 

126. In addition, analysis of the Petty Cash account revealed several deficiencies in the 
granting, utilization and liquidation of petty cash fund, as follows:

Observations Causes Standard/Criteria 

CO CAs totaling ₱230,000.00 issued to six(6) petty 
cash custodians of the CO were considered 
excessive as evidenced by the monthly 
disbursements made with minimal utilization of 3.72 
percent to 14.18 percent compared to their 
accountabilities. It is notable that out of the CAs, 
expenses totaling ₱119,005.15 were disbursed 
during the operations of the DICT and remained 
unreplenished within three (3) months to one (1) 
year. 

Poor cash management and 
planning, particularly on 
determining the amount

Fidelity bonds of two (2) Petty Cash Fund 
Custodians with cash accountabilities of 
₱50,000.00 were not renewed as of 31 December 
2020. 

Validity of the fidelity bonds 
was overlooked by the DICT 
personnel who is in charge 
in processing the application 
of fidelity bond, hence, not 
renewed. 

Section 101 (2) of PD 1445 
states that every accountable 
officer shall be properly bonded 
in accordance with law. Section 
4.1 of Treasury Circular No. 02- 
2009 provides that all officials 
and employees whose duties 
require the custody of funds, 
property or accountable forms 
shall be covered by a fidelity 
bond in accordance with the 
schedule issued by the Bureau 
of the Treasury. Section 7.2 of 
the same Treasury Circular 
provides that the fidelity bond of 
an accountable public officer 
shall be renewed before the 
expiration of the bond. 

LC 2 Petty Cash Funds amounting to ₱60,000.00 were 
granted to two (2) accountable officers despite non- 
renewal of their fidelity bond before its expiration, 
thus, recovery of funds in case of defalcations, 
shortages unrelieved losses could not be 
appropriately assured. 

The fidelity bond of the 
accountable officers was not 
renewed due to the outbreak 
of the COVID 19 pandemic. 

The Petty Cash Fund granted to the Custodian was 
not replenished as soon as the disbursements 
reach at least 75% or as needed. 

The accountable officer 
allowed the funds to deplete 
entirely instead of 
replenishing it as soon as it 
reaches at least 75% or as 
needed. 

Section 35, Chapter 6, Volume I 
of the GAM provides among 
others that Petty Cash Fund 
shall be replenished as soon as 
the disbursements reach at least 
75% or as needed. 

The expenses paid out of the PCF was supported 
with Purchase Request with Certificate of 
Emergency Purchase and Petty Cash Vouchers 
(PCVs); however, these documents were not duly 
accomplished, signed and approved by designated 
and/or authorized personnel/official, thus creating 
doubt on the validity, legality and propriety of the 
transactions. 

Leniency of the AO in 
complying with rules on

supported among others with 
duly approved Purchase 
Request with Certificate of 
Emergency Purchase if 
necessary and duly 
accomplished and signed PCVs. 

 

127. We recommended that Management: 
 

a. Direct the Finance Service to: 
 

i. demand the immediate liquidation of all outstanding CAs from 
accountable officers; and 

 

ii. coordinate with the Personnel Division to locate the whereabouts of 
the  accountable  officers  who had already retired or transferred to 



50  

other agencies and likewise issue demand letters for the liquidation 

of their unsettled accountabilities; 

 

b. Direct the Legal Service Office to issue demand letters and/or institute 
appropriate legal action, such as the imposition of appropriate sanctions 

provided under paragraphs 9.2 and 9.3 of COA Circular No. 97-002, to 

accountable officers who failed to liquidate their CAs and other sanctions, 

such as withholding of salaries, whenever warranted under the 

circumstances; 

 

c. Require the DICT-CO Accountant to: 
 

i. record properly, completely and timely the CAs and 
liquidations/refunds to determine the correct remaining balances of 

each concerned accountable officer; 

 

ii. conduct thorough review of the subsidiary ledgers to determine the 
cause/s of the negative balances and effect adjusting entries, as 

necessary and submit to the Audit Team the result of the review; and 

 

iii. ensure the closure of funds granted to Petty Cash Custodians who 
are cleared of accountabilities and demand the restitution of fund 

from AOs who are not yet cleared upon resignation, transfer or 

retirement; 

 

d. Require the DICT-CO and concerned FOO Accountants to: 
 

i. issue certifications that the previous CAs have been liquidated and 
recorded in the books before processing the grant of cash advances; 

and 

 

ii. refrain from processing grants of CAs to AOs with unliquidated 
accountabilities; 

 

e. Enjoin the concerned FOO accountable officers to: 
 

i. refrain/stop the practice of transferring their cash advance to 
another person without the proper authority and appropriate 

documentation, otherwise, comply fully on the requirements of the 

regulations before any transfer is effected; 

 

ii. strictly comply with rules on submitting complete and valid and 
documents supporting the PCF disbursements; and 

 

iii. replenish the PCF when the disbursements reach 75%. 



51  

f. Direct the concerned offices of the DICT-CO to meticulously estimate the 
needed funds for the miscellaneous expenses or activities to be financed by 

a petty cash in order to ensure that the amounts granted are not excessive; 

 

g. Require the accountable officers of the DICT-CO and LC 2 and the 
concerned DICT personnel to immediately apply for the fidelity bonds and 

always observe prudence in complying with the bonding requirement 

prescribed by law; and 

 

h. Direct the Internal Audit Service or any concerned office to evaluate the 
existing internal control system and draft proposed internal 

policy/guidelines to ensure compliance with the existing laws, rules and 

regulations concerning the grant, utilization and liquidation of CAs. 
 

128. As of this report, the Audit Team has not received any Management comment 
pertaining to the foregoing observations and recommendations. 

 

Deficiencies noted in the supply management 

 

129. The pertinent rules and policies in the proper management of inventories were 
not faithfully adhered to, showing lapses in the operational processes of the DICT. 

 

a) Failure to identify causes of variances in prior years’ accounting and supply records 
and non-conduct of physical count of inventories 

 

130. Section 9, Chapter 8, Volume I of the GAM requires the use of the perpetual 
inventory system which requires accounting records to show the amount of inventory on 

hand at all times through the maintenance of the SLCs by the Accounting Division/Unit 

and SC by the Supply and/or Property Division/Unit for each item in stock. Thus, the 

balances per SLCs and SCs should always reconcile. 

 

131. Section 13 thereof provides that, “physical count/inventory, which is required semi- 
annually, is an indispensable procedure for checking the integrity of property 

custodianship.” Section 17.i further prescribe the use of records, forms and reports, among 

others, such as the Report on the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) (Appendix 66) 

which shall be used to report the physical count of supplies by type of inventory as at a 

given date. It shows the balance of inventory items per card and per count and 

shortage/overage, if any. These include the semi-expendable property wherein the issue is 

covered by ICS. 

 

132. In CYs 2018 and 2019, we observed significant variances between the balances of 
inventory accounts per books and physical inventory in the amount of ₱34,647,860.45 and 

₱33,075,423.48, respectively. In addition, the failure to undertake physical count of 

inventory was noted in CY 2019. To address these deficiencies, we recommended 

Management to: (1) consider creating a team to investigate and determine the causes of 

prior year variances in inventory balances between accounting and supply records, and 



52  

require the team to come up with documented reports for prior years’ balances with no 

supporting documents and which cannot be found per physical inventory; and (2) create a 

supply inventory committee and ensure the periodic conduct of physical count of 

inventories as well as its reconciliation. 

 

133. These recommendations were, however, not implemented during the year nor were 
alternative measures employed. Hence, the causes of the prior year variance were still not 

determined, and accounting and supply records remained unreconciled. 

 

b) Non-compliance with the prescribed template for RSMI 
 

134. In previous years, we noted that the Report of Supplies and Materials Issued 
(RSMI) prepared by the PPMD was not compliant with the prescribed format (Appendix 

64, Volume II of the GAM). In CY 2020, we observed the same deficiencies despite the 

previous years’ recommendations, to wit: 

 

1. The RSMIs do not contain the stock numbers of inventories issued and the 
recapitulations by the Supply Officer/Custodian and Accounting Staff; 

2. The required columns to be filled up by the Accounting Division such as unit 
cost and amount were filled up by the PPMD; and 

3. The RSMIs do not have certification as to correctness by the Chief of PPMD, 
the Department’s Supply Custodian and does not provide a portion for “Posted 

by/date” where the Accounting staff may sign once the RSMI was posted in the 

SLC. 

 

c) Use of RSMI in PPEs issuances 
 

135. To reiterate, RSMIs shall be prepared by the Property and/or Supply Custodian 
based on the Requisition and Issue Slip (RIS) and shall be used by the Accounting 

Division/Unit as basis in preparing the JEV to record the supplies and materials issued. 

 

136. Section 3 (e), Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM states that the cost of an item of 
PPE shall be recognized as assets if it meets the capitalization threshold of ₱15,000.00. 

 

137. Section 42 (g), thereof provides that a Report on the Physical Count of Property, 
Plant and Equipment (Appendix 73) shall be used to report the physical count and condition 

of PPE by type as at a given date, including those which are unrecorded and those which 

could not be accounted for. It shows the balance of PPE per property cards and per count 

and the shortage/overage, if any. It shall be rendered by the Inventory Committee, on its 

yearly physical count of properties owned by the entity. 

 

138. Included in the Report of RSMIs were the 470 PPE items with unit costs of 
₱15,000.00 and above or with total a cost of ₱60,258,182.04, which should have been 

reported in the RPCPPE (not in the RSMI) after the conduct of physical count by the 

inventory committee. 



53  

139. The use of RSMIs in the issuance of PPE effectively recognizes expense; thus, 
accountability over the PPE may be lost. 

 

d) Non-segregation of duties on supply management 
 

140. Section 124 of PD 1445 states that it shall be the direct responsibility of the agency 
head to install, implement, and monitor a sound system of internal control. 

 

141. According to the Internal Auditing Standards for the Philippine Public Sector 
(IASPPS), Internal Control is an integral process that is effected by agency’s management 

and personnel and is designed to address risk and to provide reasonable assurance that in 

pursuit of the agency’s mission, the general objectives are being achieved. One of the 

internal control’s components is the control activities. Control activities include a diverse 

range of policies and procedure which help ensure that all actions needed to address risks 

in achieving agency objectives are undertaken and these include segregation of duties. 

 

142. Segregation of duties is a type of control where no singular individual or team 
should control all key stages (authorizing, processing, recording, reviewing) of a 

transaction or event to reduce the risk of error, waste, or wrongful acts, and the risk of not 

detecting such problems. 

 

143. The PPMD still performs the function as inventory custodian including the 
maintenance of Stock Cards (SCs) and preparation of RSMIs in addition to its main 

function as in-charge in the planning of procurement-related transactions of the Department 

despite the audit observation in CYs 2018 and 2019 of such conflicting functions which 

may give rise to several risks. Examples of these risks are processing fictitious purchase 

orders for personal use, accepting the goods through goods receipt and preparing fake 

documents of issuance of stocks, and other collusion risks. Thus, it was recommended that 

the inventory management function be transferred to the GSD. 

 

144. The non-segregation of duties in inventory management reflects the Agency’s 
lapses in proper management of government properties which may result in the wastage of 

resources. It bears stressing that Section 102 (a) of PD 1445 states that “the head of any 

agency of the government is immediately and primarily responsible for all government 

funds and property pertaining to his agency.” 

 
145. We recommended that Management: 

 

a. Direct the TF-CFC or any appropriate office to cause the conduct of 
physical count and preparation of report thereon, reconciliation of 

Accounting and Supply records and investigate the causes of variances, 

and if warranted, impose sanctions against erring personnel, both those 

who are responsible for any loss or negligence in their duties causing the 

unaccounted variance between book and physical count balances. 



54  

b. Enjoin the PPMD or designated supply officer to: (i) refrain from using 
RSMIs in the issuances of PPE; (ii) use the prescribed format for RSMIs; 

and (iii) submit the RSMIs and ICSs timely and completely to the 

Accounting Division with supporting RISs; 

 

c. Transfer the function of inventory management to the GSD and designate 
a supply officer; 

 

d. Require the Accounting Division and the PPMD or the designated supply 
officer to: (i) reconcile their records regularly; and (ii) coordinate with the 

IAS in the preparation of proposed internal control procedure/policies; 

and 

 

e. Direct the IAS or any concerned office to evaluate the existing internal 
control system and craft proposed internal control procedure/policies on 

both inventory management system and inventory accounting system. 

 

146. As of this report, the Audit Team has not received any Management comment 
pertaining to the foregoing observations and recommendations. 

 

Deficiencies noted in property management 

 

147. The non-reconciliation of property and accounting records and the non- 
maintenance of PCs precluded the verification of the existence and completeness of 

PPE, thus, casting doubt on the adequacy of the DICT’s internal control in 

safeguarding its properties. 

 

a) Non-reconciliation of property and accounting records 
 

148. In CY 2020, the GSD submitted the RPCPPE as of 31 December 2020 with a total 
PPE amount of ₱2,545,915,727.54 but for the Central Office only, and it does not include 

data from the FOOs, hence, could not be used to compare with the consolidated balance 

per books of ₱4,090,421,926.06. 

 

149. However, data available and obtained for the account Computer Software with 
SL/GL balance of ₱788,648,311.81 showed considerable amount of disparity totaling 

₱299,810,458.10 against the GSD records of ₱488,837,853.71. 

 

b) Non-maintenance of PCs 
 

150. Section 42, Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM requires, “The Chief Accountant 
shall maintain the PPELC for each category of PPE. The PPELC shall be kept to record 

promptly the acquisition, description, custody, estimated useful life, depreciation, 

impairment loss, disposal and other information about the asset. For check and balance, 

the Property and Supply Office/Unit shall likewise maintain PC for PPE in their custody 

to account for the receipt and disposition of the same. The balance per PC shall be 



55  

reconciled with PPELC maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit. They shall also be 

reconciled with other property records like PAR.” 

 

151. Despite the previous years’ audit recommendations, the property division did not 
prepare and maintain PCs for all purchased PPEs including those acquired by the defunct 

agencies. It is noteworthy that inquiry with the GSD disclosed that PCs were not prepared 

even for the PPEs acquired during the year. In the absence of PCs, it also prevented the 

reconciliation of accounting and property records. 

 

152. We recommended that Management: 
 

a. Direct the TF-CFC or any appropriate office to conduct complete 
inventory count of all PPE and Intangible Assets both at the DICT-CO and 

FOO and base on the report, RPCPPE, reconcile the Accounting and 

Property records; 

 

b. Direct the Property/Supply Officer to prepare Property Cards for all 
acquired PPEs of the DICT and those absorbed from the abolished 

agencies; 

 

c. Direct the Accounting Division and the GSD to: (1) coordinate with the TF- 
CFC in investigating the causes of variances between their records; (2) 

effect the necessary adjustments in their respective records; and (3) 

coordinate with the IAS in the preparation of proposed internal control 

procedure/policies; and 

 

d. Direct the IAS or any concerned office to evaluate the existing internal 
control system and draft/propose internal control procedure/policies on 

both property management system and property accounting system. 

 

Management Comments: 

 

153. The GSD is seeking the assistance of the Procurement Contract Management 
Division (PCMD) in collecting the records of the intangible assets that the previous offices 

had procured in order to update the Book Inventory of this Office. The GSD shall ensure 

the issuance of Property Acknowledgement Receipt (PAR) on future procurements of 

intangible assets of the Department. The GSD is also coordinating with the Accounting 

Division to conduct inventory of PPE for every six (6) months. 

 

Delayed/Non-submission of financial reports and transaction documents 

 

154. Non-submission or delays in the submission of financial reports, transaction 
records, bank reconciliation statements, advance copies of contracts/purchase orders 

with supporting documents, and the non-submission of status report of actions taken 

on prior years’ audit recommendations precluded the Audit Team from conducting



56  

a systematic and effective review of the documents with the end view of generating 

timely and relevant audit results. 

 

155. The late submission of the financial reports, disbursement and collection records 
and copies of contracts/POs and other reports during the year, were shown in Table 25.

Status report on the 
actions taken on prior 
year’s audit 
recommendations using 
the Agency Action Plan 
and Status of 
Implementation (AAPSI) 
format provided by the 
Audit Team upon 
transmittal of the CY 
2018 CAAR 

Within sixty (60) 
days from 
receipt of the 
COA Annual 
Audit Report 

Section 99 of the 
General 
Provisions of the 
General 
Appropriations 
Act for FY 2020 

CO  AAPSI for CY 2019 was submitted on 
14 April 2021 which incurred delays of 
136 days. 

 

156. The delayed submission of the transaction records and financial reports precluded 
us from timely and systematical review of the propriety of the disbursements and analyzing 

correctness of accounting entries recorded in the books of accounts. 

 

157. On the other hand, the delayed and incomplete submission of BFARs precluded 
the DBM and the COA, as oversight agencies, from monitoring and/or evaluating DICT’s 

performance in a timely manner. It also prevented us from conducting timely evaluation of 

the DICT’s utilization of its appropriations and/or allotments. 

 

158. Moreover, with the lack of central database for contracts and projects, completeness 
of the contracts submitted for review could not be determined. This condition also 

contributed to the inefficient monitoring of PPA implementation. 

 

159. Further, the delayed submission of the AAPSI prevented us from evaluating and 
validating in timely manner on whatever actions were already taken by Management, if 

there are any, to implement the prior year’s audit recommendations. 

 

160. More importantly, timely and relevant information was not afforded to the DICT 
Management for decision making as well as to the wide range of users of the financial 

statements, which includes the oversight agencies and the public, in making and evaluating 

decisions about the DICT’s allocation of resources and its accountability for the resources 

entrusted to it. 

 

161. Furthermore, the agency still uses the manual system of accounting and keeps its 
books of accounts in Excel files. The use of the e-NGAS may improve the agency’s 

efficiency in the preparation and submission of the aforementioned financial reports and 

transaction documents. 



60  

162. Management reasoned that the delayed and/or non- submission of the afore-cited 
reports and records was due to lack of personnel. 

 

163. We recommended that Management: 
 

a. Submit immediately the financial reports as at 31 December 2020, together 
with the supporting schedules; 

 

b. Maintain a central list or database of all contracts/projects for the efficient 
monitoring of the Department’s PPA implementation; 

 

c. Ensure and monitor the submission of the following, in compliance with 
COA Circular No. 2013-004: (i) List of all on-going government PPAs and 

those that are to be implemented during the year every February 15; and 

(ii) Notice of compliance before the start of the PPA; and 

 

d. Ensure to submit the status report on its actions taken on prior years’ audit 
recommendations using the AAPSI format within the prescribed period. 

 

164. We further recommended that Management require: 
 

a. the Accounting Unit to strategize with the existing manpower on how to 
minimize delay in submission of financial reports and transaction records 

to the Audit Team; 

 

b. the PCMD and other concerned office to submit to the Audit Team 
advance copies of contracts/POs with complete supporting documents 

within the prescribed period; 

 

c. the Planning Officer, Budget Officer and/or the Accountant, depending on 
the type of BFARs, to strictly comply with the preparation of the BFARs 

and submission of hard and electronic copies thereof to the DBM and 

COA, within the prescribed timelines as required in the COA-DBM JC No. 

2019-1 dated 1 January 2019; and 

 

d. all the concerned officials to, henceforth, religiously comply with the 
pertinent rules and regulations on the submission of financial 

reports/records and copies of all contracts, POs including all supporting 

documents and delivery documents to the Audit Team. 

 

165. As of this report, the Audit Team has not received any Management comment 
pertaining to the foregoing observations and recommendations.

Non-collection/settlement of disallowances 

 

166. Management failed to collect/settle the disallowances in full totaling 
₱236,911,749.10 despite the receipt of the Notice of Finality of Decision and the COA 

Order of Execution (COE). 
 

167. COA Circular No. 2009-0064 dated 15 September 2009 states that a COE shall be 
issued to enforce the settlement of audit disallowance/charge, whenever the persons liable 

refuse or fail to settle the same after the decisions has become final and executory. 

 

168. The recorded Receivables-Disallowances/Charges of DICT as at 30 November 
2020 amounted to ₱236,911,749.10 which pertains to the amount due from officers and 

employees for transactions disallowed in audit by the COA. 

 

169. For the purpose of presenting the age of the outstanding balances and in the absence 
of the aging schedule prepared by the Accounting Division, we prepared an aging schedule 

of Receivables- Disallowances/Charges based on the SLs submitted, as shown in the Table

170. Verification of the submitted SLs showed that balances amounting to ₱30,092.42 
remained outstanding for 10 years and above while ₱2,876,621.03 aged 5 years and above 

but less than 10 years, and ₱236,904,349.10 aged 1-2 years. The balances outstanding for 

5 years and above pertains to defunct offices which were absorbed in the DICT books. 

 

171. It was learned that two (2) COEs have been issued by the Office of the Cluster 
Director, National Government Sector – Cluster 6 to DICT Management on 25 May 2018 

and 31 August 2018 amounting to ₱7,400.00 and ₱236,904,349.10, respectively, with

172. However, for the Year 2020, only ₱11,520.00 or .0048% of the total amount of 
Receivables-Disallowances with COE was collected/settled. 

 

173. It bears emphasizing that Section 7 of the Rules and Regulations on the Settlement 
of Accounts under COA Circular No. 2009-006 outlines the responsibility of the Agency 

Head in the settlement of accounts, as follows: 

 

7.1.1 The head of the agency, who is primarily responsible for all the government 
funds and property pertaining to his agency, shall ensure that: (a) the required 

financial and other reports and statements are submitted by the concerned 

agency officials in such forms and within the period prescribed by the 

commission; (b) the settlement of disallowances and charges is made within 

the prescribed period; (c) the requirements of transactions suspended in audit 

are complied with; (d) appropriate actions are taken on the deficiencies noted 

as contained in the AOM. 

 

7.1.2 The head of the agency shall initiate the necessary administrative and/or 
criminal action in case of unjustified failure/refusal to effect compliance with 

the foregoing requirements by subordinate officials. 

 

7.1.3 He shall enforce the COA Order of Execution (COE) by requiring the 
withholding of salaries or other compensation due the person liable in 

satisfaction of disallowance/charge. 

 

7.1.4 He shall ensure that all employees who are retiring or transferring to other 
agencies shall first settle the disallowances and charges for which they are 

liable. 



63  

174. Inquiry from the Accounting Division on the action taken thereon was made on 11 
February 2021 and 3 March 2021 through electronic mail, but as of this report, no response 

was received. 

 

175. We recommended that Management direct the Legal Office to issue demand 
letters and enforce the settlement/collection from the persons liable, or consider filing 

a case in court, if warranted. 
 

176. As of this report, the Audit Team has not received any Management comment 
pertaining to the foregoing observations and recommendations.

178. Review of contracts, POs and pertinent documents disclosed the following 
deficiencies: 

 

Alternative Modes of Procurement 
 

Lack of judicious planning (Procurement No. 1) 

 

179. GovMail is one of the services offered by the DICT. With more than 30,000 users 
consisting of different NGAs, Local Government Units (LGUs), GOCCs, Government 

Financial Institutions (GFIs) and other government projects. It is claimed to be a critical 

information infrastructure that needs to be secured and available 24/7 with at least a 99.9% 

Service Level Agreement. Hence, every downtime could result to the loss of government 

data or information. 

 

180. In CY 2019, the DICT has recorded downtime occurrences in January, May, June, 
September and October or a total of almost 85 hours of downtime attributed to the aging 

Government Common Platform (GCP) infrastructure (around four (4) years old already 

and nearing the standard five (5) year end of life for hardware), where the GovMail is 

hosted, and the lack of redundancy system in place. Due to these occurrences, in November 

2019, the DICT conducted the Negotiated Procurement-Emergency Cases (NP-EC) of 

“Five (5) Months Subscription to a Cloud Based Electronic Messaging Service for the 

Government Wide Email System (GovMail).” The DICT invited the Kollab Guru Group, 

Inc. (Kollab) to submit its proposal and upon determination that it is technically, legally 



65  

and financially capable of implementing the project, it was awarded with the project for a 

contract amount of ₱25,675,440.00. In their explanation, the end-user justified that 

emergency procurement is proper since it would address the imminent loss of government 

data because of increasing downtimes and “the emergency procurement is an interim 

solution (5 months subscription) which cover 31,000 accounts, under the 2020 DICT NEP, 

a considerable amount was earmarked for a one year subscription of the same solution. 

We will conduct early procurement for this in 2019 and request for a Multi-Year 

Obligational Authority (MYOA) and adapt Multi-Year Contracts (MYCs) to ensure 

continuous service in the succeeding years.” 

 

181. However, in CY 2020, the DICT conducted another NP-EC, this time for the 
procurement of “One-year subscription of a Cloud Based Electronic Mail System with 

Videoconference Solutions for the Government Wide Email System (GovMail)”, with 

contract amount of ₱61,621,180.00, still awarded to Kollab. In their justification, the end- 

user explained that GovMail facilitates work from home (WFH) arrangement through 

email, chat, and video conferencing features. This mitigates or reduces exposure of users 

from imminent danger to life brought upon by corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 

during the State of Public Health Emergency as declared under Proclamation No. 929, 

series of 2020. 

 

182. Sections 48.1 and 48.2, Rule XVI of the 2016 IRR of RA 9184 state that: 
 

Subject to the prior approval of the HoPE, and whenever justified by the 

conditions provided in this Act, the Procuring Entity may, in order to promote 

economy and efficiency, resort to any of the alternative methods of procurement 

provided in this Rule. In all instances, the Procuring Entity shall ensure that 

the most advantageous price for the government is obtained. 

 

In accordance with Section 10 of this IRR, as a general rule, the Procuring 

Entities shall adopt competitive bidding as the general method of procurement 

and shall see to it that the procurement program allows sufficient lead time for 

such competitive bidding. Alternative methods of procurement shall be resorted 

to only in highly exceptional cases provided in this rule. (Emphasis supplied) 
 

183. In this case, while it can be argued that the loss of government data may justify the 
NP-EC; however, it is already a belated remedy on the part of the Agency to the already 

existing problem at the beginning of CY 2019. If the GovMail is already experiencing 

downtimes since January 2019, then they should have already procured through 

competitive bidding during the start of the year and not resort to NP-EC in November 2019 

when there is already an imminent danger of data loss. 

 

184. Moreover, it was included in the justification for the first emergency procurement 
that the five-month subscription to a cloud-based electronic messaging service for the 

GovMail was only an interim solution, that an early procurement short of award will be 

conducted, and that a MYOA will be requested. If it was already planned that an early 

procurement will be conducted, then it should have been proper that a competitive bidding 



66  

should have been used in the procurement of the one-year subscription to a cloud-based 

electronic messaging service for the GovMail. However, it was apparently omitted in the 

justification submitted for the second emergency procurement the reason as to why no 

competitive bidding was conducted or whether a MYOA was requested. 

 

185. In sum, the presence of conditions, which may have justified the use of the said 
alternative mode, were not the sole bases for resorting to NP-EC but may also be attributed 

to the fault of the Agency due to its lack of judicious planning. 

 

186. We recommended that Management require the BAC/end-user to submit an 
explanation on: 

 

a. why the procurement of Five (5) Months Subscription to a Cloud Based 
Electronic Messaging Service for the Government Wide Email System 

(GovMail) was conducted only in November 2019 and why no competitive 

bidding was made when the problem with the GCP infrastructure became 

apparent; 

 

b. whether an early procurement short of award was conducted; and 
 

c. whether a MYOA was requested by the DICT. 
 

Management comments: 

 

187. It should be noted that on July 2019, a change in leadership in the Department 
occurred as the President appointed the incumbent Secretary and other new officials in the 

DICT. Upon assuming office, the administration opted to reassess and review on-going 

and proposed projects to ensure prompt and effective delivery of services. The review 

included determining the viability and practicality of existing projects in relation to 

advances in technology. It was only after the assumption of the new officials and the 

reassessment of the GovMail program that the circumstances could be acted upon. The 

appointment of new DICT officials resulted in the reorganization of internal units, 

transition of personnel, and reconstitution of the Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) in 

October 2019. Hence, upon the determination that the loss of government data is imminent 

and migration to the cloud is immediately necessary, the Department procured the project 

through NP-EC. 

 

188. As for the One (1) Year Subscription of a Cloud Based Electronic Mail System 
with Videoconference Solutions for the GovMail System, it should be considered that the 

NTP for the 5 Month GovMail Subscription was issued on December 19, 2019. As such, 

early procurement for the long-term subscription of GovMail was no longer feasible 

without undertaking proper evaluation and review since it must be undertaken prior to the 

end of 2019. Accordingly, competitive bidding was targeted to be scheduled prior to the 

expiration of the initial 5 Month GovMail Subscription. However, on March 8, 2020, 

proclamation No. 922 was issued declaring the Philippines to be under a State of Public 

Health Emergency because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Subsequently, on March 12, 2020, 



67  

the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Disease (IATF- 

MEID) issued Resolution No. 11 placing Metro Manila under Community Quarantine as a 

precaution against Covid-19. In line with this, competitive bidding for the GovMail 

Subscription would have been dangerous and impossible for both the Department and 

prospective bidders. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

189. Moving forward, we reminded the Department to judiciously plan its procurement 
in order to efficiently and economically deliver the projects to its intended beneficiaries in 

accordance with our procurement laws, rules and regulations. 

 

Inappropriate mode of procurement (Procurement Nos. 2, 9 and 10) 
 

190. The following are the justifications for resorting to NP-EC vis-à-vis reason why it 
is an inappropriate mode of procurement: 

 
Table 29. Summary of Justifications vis-à-vis Deficiencies Noted 

 

Procurement No. 
Justification/Basis for resorting 

to Negotiated Procurement 
Deficiencies Noted 

2 The GovMail became a vital part in 
the continuous operation of 184 
hosted government agencies, 
particularly during COVID-19 crisis 
and the ECQ due to the following 
reasons: (a) in addition to the email 
accounts, GovMail provides chat and 
video conferencing facilities through 
G Suite subscription included in the 
contract; (b) that this allowed 
GovMail clients to continue 
operations, collaborate and 
exchange information with other 
users and stakeholders despite the 
ECQ; and (c) that GovMail facilitates 
WFH arrangement through email, 
chat, and video conferencing 
features. This mitigates or reduces 
exposure of users from imminent 
danger to life brought upon by 
COVID-19. 

Section 53 of RA 9184 states that NP-EC shall be allowed in case of 
imminent danger to life or property during a state of calamity, or when 
time is of the essence arising from natural or man-made calamities 
or other causes where immediate action is necessary to prevent 
damage to or loss of life or property, or to restore vital public 
services, infrastructure facilities and other public utilities. 

 
The subject of procurement contemplated in Section 53 refers to the 
procurement of urgently needed goods, infrastructure project or 
consulting services in order to immediately address the emergency, 
such as the procurement of supplies, equipment or services to 
directly address the current COVID-19 situation. While the use of the 
GovMail may prevent the users of GovMail to exposure from the 
hazards of COVID-19; however, as explained by the DICT, this may 
only mitigate or reduce the exposure of users from imminent danger 
brought upon by COVID-19 since they may opt to use their personal 
email accounts, social media accounts or use other modes of 
communication. Moreover, the danger of exposure to COVID-19 will 
still persist even after the subject procurements. Hence, the subject 
of the herein procurement may not be considered as urgent as those 
services needed in the COVID-19 response since it will not directly 
address the danger to life that is already existing even if the said 
procurement was not made. 

9 & 10 By virtue of Memorandum of 
Agreement (MOA) executed on 21 
October 2020 by the DICT and 
Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), 
pursuant to Section 18 of RA 
110555, the DICT shall provide, 
among     others,     technical     and 

Item V(D)(9), Annex H of the 2016 IRR of RA 9184, provides that 
real property refers to land and buildings (office spaces or units) and 
construction of all kinds adhered to the soil. Under Appendix B 
thereof, the lease of real property and venue may include ancillary 
services such as janitorial and security, air conditioning, repair and 
maintenance, water and light consumption, and secured parking 
space. 

 
 

5Otherwise known as the Philippine Identification System Act.

Procurement No. 
Justification/Basis for resorting 

to Negotiated Procurement 
Deficiencies Noted 

 advisory assistance to the PSA with 
regard to the implementation of the 
Philippine Identification System 
(PhilSys). Under Section II thereof, 
the DICT shall have the following 
responsibility, among others: 

Provide, to the PSA, Data 
Center Facility Hosting or 
Colocation Services, cloud 
services, and Secured Link for 
data transmission, subject to 
availability. In relation thereto, 
DICT shall provide physical 
security measures at its data 
center facilities. 

Here, other than the use of the real property, the following 
requirements were also included in the technical specifications for 
the IT facility, among others: 
A. Room space: 

 Must provide biometric authentication and PIN entry; 

 Must provide CCTV facilities; 
 

B. Rack requirements: 

 Rack cabinets for server and network hardware 
equipment; 

 

C. Security, Access, and Site availability 

 Physical access control mechanisms, such as proximity 
card readers, biometric authentication and PIN entry for 
highly secured areas, round-the-clock security (stationed 
and roving) covering the entire facility, and video 
surveillance using CCTV security cameras; 

 Continuous Power Supply; 

 Facilities Management Support – e.g. all building facilities 
should be centrally and automatically monitored via an 
intelligent Facility Management System or Building 
Management System, Data Center must have ISO 9001 
and ISO 27001 certification; 

 Network Infrastructure – must provide 48-port switch, two 
firewalls, must have anti-virus etc., ten (10) mobile 
computing devices, i.e., laptops, to technical/PMO 
personnel of the DICT; and 

 Customer support – must have available 24x7 Network 
Operations Center (NOC) 

 

D. Training – to cover at least fifteen (15) personnel 
 

Based on the foregoing, it appears that the Procuring Entity (PE) 
does not only intend to procure a room space and racks but also 
other IT services which are essential for the maintenance of a data 
center facility and not only mere ancillary services. Hence, the use 
of NP – Lease of Real Property may not be the appropriate mode of 
procurement since the main consideration is not the use of the real 
property (with incidental services). This means that all conditions are 
not present in order to justify the use of alternative mode of 
procurement of NP – Lease of Real Property and Venue contrary to 
Section 48 of RA 9184. 

 

191. We recommended that Management require: 
 

a. The end-user to submit further explanation as to why the herein 
procurement falls within the highly exceptional cases which should justify 

the Negotiated Procurement (Emergency Cases) of “One year subscription 

of a Cloud Based Electronic Mail System with Videoconference Solutions for 

the Government Wide Email System (GovMail)”; and 



69  

b. The BAC to submit explanation on the following: (i) basis for using 
Negotiated Procurement - Lease of Real Property and Venue than other 

modes of procurement; and (ii) whether the use of this mode promotes 

economy and efficiency. 

 

Management Comments: 

 

192. The procurement of the One (1) Year GovMail Subscription contract may be 
justified under Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB) Resolution No. 03-2020 

dated 09 March 2020 which amended Section 53. 2 of the 2016 IRR of RA 9184. By virtue 

of amendments introduce by GPPB Resolution No. 03-2020, the Department may resort to 

NP-EC in procuring the One (1) Year GovMail with Video Conference Solutions as it is 

intended to promote and support Work-From-Home Arrangements and lessen the exposure 

of National and Local Government Clients and users to Covid-19. As such, resorting to 

NP-EC is further justified because the GovMail project allows government personnel to 

remain productive through email. Chat and videoconferencing facilities. The addition of 

videoconferencing facilities enabled the users of the GovMail System ranging from NGAs, 

LGUs, GOCCs, GFIs and other government projects to continue with their functions in 

providing uninterrupted government service, despite the quarantine restrictions. Through 

GovMail services, client agencies may avoid disruption in the day to day functions of their 

respective offices leading to loss of government services. The “.gov.ph” domain also serves 

as a deterrent against unscrupulous individuals who may falsely claim to represent a 

government agency. In the absence of this domain, the general public may not trust the 

email address and will be discouraged from transacting online. 

 

193. A data center is defined as a centralized repository that may be physical or virtual, 
analog or digital, used for the storage, management and dissemination of data. As used in 

this project, it is the actual physical facility which houses the computer systems, 

networking equipment and associated hardware needed to ensure the connectivity of the 

computer systems to the Internet or other networks. It includes the power supply, 

subsystems, electrical switches, backup generators and environmental controls (such as air 

conditioning and server cooling devices) that protect the data center hardware and keep it 

running. The ancillary services referred to are inherently part and parcel of the actual 

facility, the real property that is the subject of the lease arrangement under this project. 

Further, the personnel training indicated is simply to recalibrate and transfer the know-how 

involved in the appropriate use, interoperability, and maintenance of the built-in 

infrastructure, devices and equipment, with the current system and processes of the DICT. 

This is intended to ensure seamless integration and operation of data center assets. In the 

same manner, this procurement is simply for the lease of the room space, inclusive of the 

racks, service requirements, security features, and other details of facilities specified in the 

terms of reference. Simply stated, what is being procured is the part of the room space of 

the data center facility that already includes the technical specifications identified in the 

terms of reference. The main consideration therefore is the procurement of the data center 

space that already offers such ancillary services. 



70  

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

194. The PE is in the best position to determine the main object of its procurement. Based 
on their explanation, the main consideration of the subject procurement is a data center 

space with ancillary services. This may be considered as real property; hence, we accept 

the justification submitted, and moving forward, will use it as reference in the conduct of 

audit. 

 

Winning bidder has doubtful technical, legal and financial capacity to implement 

the project (Procurement Nos. 5, 6 and 7) 

 

195. By virtue of Proclamation Nos. 9226 and 9297, series of 2020, all government 
agencies and LGUs were enjoined to render full assistance and cooperation and mobilize 

the necessary resources to undertake critical, urgent, and appropriate response and 

measures in a timely manner to curtail and eliminate the threat of Covid-19. In response to 

this global pandemic, the Congress likewise passed RA 114698, otherwise known as the 

Bayanihan to Heal as One Act. 
 

196. In line with this public policy, the DICT has issued Department Circular (DC) No. 
12, series of 2020, dated 15 June 2020 entitled “Accelerated Implementation of the Digital 

Education Program and its Component Projects in response to the State of Public Health 

Emergency due to Covid-19.” It was stated therein that RA 10844, also known as 

“Department of Information and Communications Technology Act of 2015,” declared the 

policy of the State to promote the use of Information and Communications Technology to 

enhance key public services, such as education, among others, and to promote digital 

literacy, ICT expertise, and knowledge-building to enable Filipinos to live and compete in 

an evolving ICT age. Moreover, that the DICT is mandated to formulate and implement 

policies and initiatives, in coordination with the Department of Education (DepEd), the 

Commission on Higher Education (CHED), and the Technical Education and Skills 

Development Authority (TESDA), to develop and promote in education, consistent with 

the national goals and objectives, responsive to the human resource needs of the ICT and 

ICT-Enabled Services (ICT-ES) sectors. 

 

197. Under the Digital Philippines, one of the DICT’s flagship strategy to implement its 
mandate, is the DICT Digital Education Program which aims to create virtual and physical 

systems, solutions, platforms for developing digital skills, stimulating the creation of   

ICT- based jobs and industries, delivering instructions in formal, informal, vocational, 

and non- formal education through ICT, and facilitating the participation of public 

and private sectors in the evolving digital society.

199. Section 53 of the 2016 IRR of RA 9184 states: 
 

Negotiated Procurement is a method of procurement of Goods, Infrastructure 

Projects and Consulting services, whereby the Procuring Entity directly 

negotiates a contract with a technically, legally and financially capable 

supplier, contractor or consultant xxx 

 

a. On the supplier’s financial capacity: 

 

200. Examination of the Audited FSs as at 31 December 2019 and 2018 showed that 
Lex-mar is a sole proprietor with total Current Assets of ₱44,578,450.00 and 

₱45,539,417.00, respectively. On the other hand, there are no reported Current Liabilities 

while the Other Liabilities for both year pertains to VAT and Income Tax Payable only. 

Absent any loan or insufficient current assets to support the project, gives an impression 

that  Lex-Mar  has  not  enough  funding  to  finance  the  herein  projects  amounting    to 

₱170,273,000.00. Hence, the herein supplier has doubtful financial capacity to implement 

the herein projects. 



72  

b. On supplier’s legal capacity: 
 

201. A supplier’s BIR Certification of Registration and Permit to Operate issued by the 
appropriate Local Government Unit enumerates the kind or Line of Business/Industry 

where it can transact or conduct its business. Here, there is no showing both in Lex-Mar’s 

BIR Certificate of Registration and Permit to Operate that it is engaged in the business of 

supply and delivery of ICT devices such as laptops, tablets and pocket WIFI. Further, the 

Notes to FSs showed that primary purpose of the company is to engage in the business of 

general construction. Hence, it is doubtful whether the herein supplier has the legal capacity 

to engage in this kind of business. 

 

c. On the supplier’s technical capacity: 
 

202. Under the POs, Lex-Mar is likewise obligated to deliver the following ancillary 
services: 

 

i. One (1) year after sales warranty and product technical support 
services; 

ii. Hotline support (Monday to Sunday, 9AM to 9PM); 
iii. Online help; and 
iv. Offline Support Services Center. 

 

203. Examination of Lex-Mar’s Audited FSs likewise showed that the Operating 
Expenses of the company do not consist of Salaries Expense, which is an account used to 

record the employees’ compensation. Hence, it was not shown that Lex-Mar has available 

employees which may show that it is technically capable to comply with the requirements 

of the projects. 

 

204. Moreover, the supporting documents submitted to the Audit Team did not include 
a copy of the Certificate of Exclusive Distributorship or supplier’s Statement of Single 

Largest contract similar to the herein project (or any document showing that the bidder has 

previously engaged in this kind of business). 

 

205. In sum, considering that these are big budget procurement projects and NP-EC 
modality was used, the Procuring Entity should be more prudent in conducting the 

procurement activities in order to avoid the wastage of government funds. 

 

The DICT’s policy-making mandate does not include the authority to provide ICT 

devices to the intended beneficiaries (Procurement Nos. 5, 6 and 7) 

 

206. The DICT’s mandate of formulating and implementing policies and initiatives does 
not include the authority of providing ICT devices to the intended beneficiaries. Hence, 

while we sympathize with the plight of Learners and Teachers in this time of distance 

learning or online classes, a donation of government property, such as in this case, may be 

considered as illegal expenditure. 



73  

207. We recommended that Management: 
 

a. Direct the end-user to submit: (i) Bid Evaluation and Post Qualification 
Report or any similar report showing the evaluations conducted in order 

to determine the technical, legal and financial capacity of the supplier, if 

any; and (ii) explanation as to why the contract was awarded to a supplier 

with doubtful technical, legal, and financial capacity; and 

 

b. Submit explanation as to whether it is within the DICT’s mandate to 
provide ICT devices to intended beneficiaries including the legal basis for 

the donation of laptop, tablets and pocket WIFI to the Learners and 

Teachers. 

 

208. As of this report, the Audit Team has not received any Management comment 
pertaining to the foregoing observations and recommendations. 

 

Failure to follow the procedures in Negotiated Procurement (Two Failed Biddings) 

(Procurement No. 8) 

 

209. On 19 May 2017, the concerned BAC conducted the pre-procurement conference 
of the project “Design, Supply, Delivery, Installation, Splicing, Testing and 

Commissioning of Brand New Fiber Optic Cable Network in Zamboanga City.” At this 

stage, the BAC already instructed the end-user to perform the following, among others: (a) 

revise the Purchase Request and Terms of Reference for the project to prevent failure of 

bidding; (b) do a comprehensive market research; and (c) revise the payment terms. 

 

210. Extant records show that the first two (2) public biddings for this project have failed 
due to the following reasons:

and Almatel Construction 
Services, Inc. 

The lone bidder failed to comply with all the bid 
requirements. 

 
[The lone bidder submitted an invalid PCAB license. 
The bidder likewise submitted a copy of the official 
receipt on the renewal of PCAB license; however, it 
failed to submit the PCAB application] 

18 September 2017 JV of Comm Trend 
Construction Corporation, Zeal 
Power Construction & Dev’t 
Corp. and Almatel 
Construction Services, Inc. 

The lone bidder was declared post-disqualified. 
 

[The Certificate of Completion of the Single Largest 
Project and Certificate of Performance Evaluation were 
found to be invalid] 

 

211. The BAC then conducted a negotiated procurement in view of these two (2) failed 
biddings. The submission and bid opening was held on 18 December 2017. In BAC 

Resolution No. B-2017-065 dated 27 December 2021 which was approved by the HoPE, 



74  

the bid of the Joint Venture of Zeal Power Construction and Development Corporation, 

Comm Trend Construction Corporation, and Lasaya RCA Builders, Inc., was declared as 

Single Calculated and Responsive Bid and was recommended for issuance of Notice of 

Award (NOA). Later, a NOA was issued and the contracting parties executed Contract No. 

2017-12-36 for the mentioned project on 29 December 2017. 

 

Mandatory review of the terms, conditions, specifications, and cost estimates, was 

conducted by the BAC. 

 

212. Section 35 of the 2016 IRR of RA 9184 states: 
 

In order to determine the reason for the failed bidding, the BAC shall conduct 

a mandatory review and evaluation of the terms, conditions, and specifications 

in the Bidding Documents, including its cost estimates. 

 

Based on its findings, the BAC shall revise the terms, conditions, and 

specifications, and if necessary, adjust the ABC, subject to the required 

approvals, and conduct a re-bidding with re-advertisement and/or posting, as 

provided in Section 21.2 of this IRR. 

 

213. Item V(D)(1)(b)(i), Annex H of the same IRR reads: 
 

After conduct of the mandatory review of the terms, conditions, and 

specifications, and cost estimates, as prescribed in Section 35 of the IRR, the 

BAC, based on its findings, as assisted by its Secretariat, TWG and end-user 

unit may revise and agree on the technical, legal and financial eligibility 

requirements and technical specifications or terms of reference, and if 

necessary, adjust the ABC, subject to the required approvals. However, the 

ABC cannot be increased by more than twenty percent (20%) of the ABC for 

the last failed bidding. 

 

214. In this project, there is no showing that a mandatory review was conducted by the 
BAC or any of the Agency’s concerned office. In fact, it was not stated in any BAC 

Resolution or even in the contract that such review was conducted. 

 

Instead of inviting at least three (3) suppliers/contractors, the BAC opted to post another 

Invitation to Bid at the PhilGEPS website and at DICT premises. 

 

215. Annex H of the 2016 IRR of RA 9184 states: 
 

The BAC shall invite at least three (3) suppliers, contractors, or consultants or 

consultants, including those disqualified in previous biddings for the project, for 

negotiations to ensure effective competition. This, notwithstanding, those who 

responded through any of the required postings shall be allowed to participate. 

Even if only one (1) bidder should respond to such invitation or posting, the BAC 

shall proceed with the negotiation subject to the rules prescribed hereunder. 



75  

216. In BAC Resolution No. B-2017-065 dated 27 December 2021, the following were 
stated: (a) that BAC posted another invitation to bid at PhilGEPS and DICT premises; (b) 

the JV, as the sole bidder, passed in the Eligibility and Technical Documents and Financial 

Documents; and (c) the JV submitted their best and final offer. Based on this document, it 

appears that the BAC opted to follow the procedure in public bidding. While it is not 

prohibited to follow the said procedure, however, it is not efficient for the BAC to create 

its own procedure since the procedure was already enumerated in the IRR. 

 

217. We recommended that Management: 
 

a. direct the BAC to submit: (a) proof of mandatory review of the terms, 
conditions, specifications, and cost estimates, before the negotiated 

procurement was conducted or explain if none was conducted; and (b) 

Proof of invitation to at least three (3) suppliers or contractors or explain 

if none was invited; and 

 

b. The PCMD to explain why the contract together with its supporting 
documents was submitted after almost three (3) years from its execution. 

 

218. As of this report, the Audit Team has not received any Management comment 
pertaining to the foregoing observations and recommendations. 

 

Competitive Bidding 
 

The bidder that was number 1 in the ranking after the bid evaluation was not declared 

as the LCB (Procurement No. 3) 

 

219. After the bid submission and opening, the BAC shall evaluate the financial 
component of the bids. The bids that passed the preliminary examination shall be ranked 

from lowest to highest in terms of their corresponding calculated prices. The bid with the 

lowest calculated bid price shall be referred to as the Lowest Calculated Bid (LCB). Then 

the bidder with the LCB undergoes post-qualification or verification and validation 

whether it has passed all the requirements and conditions as specified in the Bidding 

Documents. If the bidder with the LCB passes all the criteria for post-qualification, his Bid 

shall be considered the Lowest Calculated and Responsive Bid (LCRB) and shall be 

recommended to the HoPE for approval of award.9 The BAC may create a TWG to assist, 

among others, in the evaluation of bids and post-qualification. 
 

220. Perusal of the Bid Evaluation Report and Post-Qualification Report of the TWG, 
BAC Resolution No. BAC3-2019-003 dated 04 December 2019, BAC Resolution No. 

BAC3-2019-007 dated 18 December 2019, and the financial proposals of the bidders 

showed the following details:

Ione 12,141,192.00 12,141,191.88 3 
 

221. As shown in the Table, under Lot 2-C, Converge’s bid price as calculated was 
₱12,555,085.66 while Telectronic’s bid price as calculated was ₱12,161,689.80. However, 

Converge ranked number one (1) or bidder with LCB. It was later declared as bidder with 

LCRB and was eventually awarded with the contract. This is contrary to Sections 32 to 37 

of RA 9184 which clearly states that the bidder with LCRB shall undergo post-qualification 

and be awarded of the contract if post-qualified. 

 

222. We recommended that Management direct the BAC to submit justification for 
declaring Converge as bidder with LCB when its bid is not the lowest among the 

bidders. 

 

Management Comments: 

 

223. To emphasize, the correct bid price as calculated of Converge Lot 2 – C is 
₱6,706,349.00 and not ₱12,555,085.66. It is also worth emphasizing that the correct bid 

price as calculated of Converge for Lot 2 – C is lower than the bid price as calculated of 

Telectronic for the same Lot 2 – C. Thus, the TWG correctly identified Converge as the 

bidder with the LCB. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

224. This is subject to further evaluation by the Audit Team. 
 

The TWG failed to verify the bidders’ ongoing contracts which could have 

determined whether the bidders have incurred delay, if any, in the delivery of goods 

or failed to deliver/perform any of its obligations (Procurement Nos. 3, 4, 11 and 12) 

 

225. After bid evaluation, the LCB shall undergo post-qualification in order to determine 
whether the bidder concerned complies with and is responsive to all the requirements and 

conditions as specified in the bidding documents. Post-qualification shall verify, validate, 

and ascertain all statements made and documents submitted by the bidder with the LCB, 

using non-discretionary criteria, as stated in the Bidding Documents, including, among 



77  

others, the Technical Requirements. 10 Under Section 34.3 of the 2016 IRR of RA 9184, 

these criteria shall consider, but shall not be limited to, the following, among others: 

 

226. “Verification and/or inspection and testing of the goods/product, after sales and or 
maintenance capabilities, in applicable case, as well as checking the following: 

 

a. Delay in the partial delivery of goods amounting to 10% of the contract price 
in its ongoing government and private contracts; 

 

b. If any of these contracts shows the bidder’s failure to deliver or perform any 
or all of the goods or services within the period(s) specified in the contract 

or within any extension thereof granted by the Procuring Entity pursuant to 

a request made by the supplier prior to the delay, and such failure amounts 

to at least ten percent (10%) of the contract price; or 

 

c. Unsatisfactory performance of the supplier’s obligations as per contract 
terms and conditions at the time of inspection. 

 

If the BAC verifies any of these deficiencies to be due to the bidder’s fault or 

negligence, the BAC shall disqualify the bidder from the award, for the procurement of 

goods.” 

 

227. In procurement nos. 3, 4, 11 and 12, Converge, Joint Venture of LDLA Marketing 
and Trading, Inc. and Computrade Technology Philippines, Inc., and LDLA Marketing and 

Trading, Inc., have passed the Bid Evaluation and their bid was subjected to post- 

qualification evaluation by the TWG. However, the TWG’s Post Qualification Report did 

not mention any verification made on the status of delivery or performance of the bidders 

on their ongoing contracts, including the contracts with the DICT. 

 

228. We recommended that Management: (a) direct the TWG to submit comment 
on the non-inclusion in their Post-Qualification Report the verification of the bidder’s 

ongoing contracts; and (b) henceforth, include in the Post-Qualification Report the 

result of verification of all ongoing contracts of the bidder pursuant to Section 34.3 

(iii) of the 2016 IRR of RA 9184. 

 

Management Comments: 

 

229. It must be considered that there was substantial compliance with the 2016 IRR of 
RA 9184 when the Statement of All Ongoing Government and Private Contracts of 

Converge within year 2019 was verified and validated through the certified true copy of 

the NOA and NTP. The TWG carefully examined, verified and ascertained all documents 

submitted by Converge in relation to its bid. There were other documents that were 

considered by the TWG and served as bases for the TWG to conclude that the Converge 

passed all the criteria for post-qualification. 
 

 
 

10 Section 34 of the 2016 IRR of RA 9184. 



78  

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

230. The Audit Team takes note of the assurance to comply with the recommendations. 
 

The BAC failed to ensure that at least two (2) observers, other than a representative 

of the COA, were invited in the procurement activities for this project (Procurement 

Nos. 3, 4, 11 and 12) 
 

231. Section 3 of RA 9184 states that government procurement shall be governed by the 
principle of transparency in the procurement process and in the implementation of 

procurement contracts. 

 

232. Section 13, Rule V of the 2016 IRR of RA 9184 states that “to enhance transparency 
of the process, the BAC shall, during the eligibility checking, shortlisting, pre-bid 

conference, preliminary examination of bids, bid evaluation, and post-qualification, invite, 

in addition to the representative of the COA, at least two (2) observers, x x x.” Further, it 

was likewise stated in Section 13.3 therein that: 

 

Observers shall be invited at least five (5) calendar days before the date of the 

procurement stage/activity. The absence of observers will not nullify the BAC 

proceedings: provided, that they have been duly invited in writing. The 

Procuring Entity shall ensure that the invitation is received at least five (5) 

calendar days before each procurement activity. (Emphasis supplied) 
 

233. In procurement nos. 3, 4, 11 and 12, the BAC has invited a representative from the 
COA and three (3) private entities. However, perusal of the invitations showed that only 

one (1) of the said private entities has proof of receipt stamped on the face of the invitation. 

Hence, the Procuring Entity (PE) has failed to show that invitations were received by the 

observers at least five (5) calendar days before the procurement activities; contrary to the 

principle of transparency. 

 

234. We recommended that Management direct the BAC/BAC Secretariat to 
ensure that at least two (2) observers, other than a representative of the COA, are 

invited in the procurement activities of the DICT pursuant to Section 13, Rule V of 

the 2016 IRR of RA 9184. 

 

Management Comments: 

 

235. Respectfully, it must be noted that the BAC complied with the requirements set 
forth in the 2016 IRR of RA 9184 when it sent out the invitations to private entities. Further, 

the absence of observers will not nullify the BAC proceedings as stated in Section 13, Rule 

V of the 2016 IRR of R.A. 9184. 



79  

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

236. The law is clear that the PE should ensure that the invitation is received at least five 
(5) calendar days before each procurement activity. Non-compliance therewith affects 
the transparency of the procurement activities. 

 

The Joint Venture Agreement (JVA) executed by the bidder did not disclose the 

contributions of each of the members of the JV (Procurement No. 3) 

 

237. Section 3 of RA 9184 states that Government procurement shall be governed, 
among others, by the following principle: 

 

Competitiveness by extending equal opportunity to enable private contracting 

parties who are eligible and qualified to participate in public bidding. 

 

238. Section 23.4.1.1 of the 2016 Revised IRR of RA 9184 enumerates the 
persons/entities that are eligible in the bidding for the supply of goods. Among those, is 

stated in Item (e), to wit: 

 

“Persons/entities forming themselves into a joint venture, i.e., a group of two (2) 

or more persons/entities that intend to be jointly and severally responsible or 

liable for a particular contract. Provided, however, That Filipino ownership or 

interest of the joint venture concerned shall be at least sixty percent (60%). For 

this purpose, Filipino ownership or interest shall be based on the contributions 

of each of the members of the joint venture as specified in their JVA. (Emphasis 

supplied) 

 

239. Perusal of the proof of SEC registration submitted by the bidder showed that under 
the Stockholder’s Information (page 5 of the General Information Sheet for the year 2019), 

the following is the ownership composition of the members of the JV: 
 

Table 33. Subscribed Capital of the members of the JV as per GIS 
 

JV Member 
Ownership Composition 

Filipino (a) Foreigner (b) Total (c) 

Computrade 3,000,004.00 26,999,996.00 30,000,000.00 
LDLA 30,000,000.00 - 30,000,000.00 

Total 33,000,004.00 26,999,996.00 60,000,000.00 

% of total Filipino ownership (a/c) = 55% 
 

240. As shown in the Table, out of the subscribed capital of the JV of ₱60,000,000.00, 
55% or ₱33,000,004.00 belongs to the Filipino owners. On the other hand, the submitted 

JVA merely states that LDLA owns a share of 70%, while Computrade owns 30%. 

 

241. Without the statement of their actual contribution in the JV, we cannot determine 
the actual Filipino ownership or interest of the JV; hence, based on the above table, it can 

be presumed that the Filipino ownership or interest in the JV is equivalent to 55% which 

is short of 5% of the required 60% Filipino ownership/interest in the JV; thus, the JV should 



80  

have been declared ineligible. This is contrary to the principle of competitiveness which 

states that public bidding shall be open to eligible and qualified bidders. 

 

242. We recommended that Management: (a) direct the BAC to submit an 
explanation as to the basis used in determining the Filipino ownership of the JV and 

their failure to require the JV from stating the actual contribution of their members; 

and (b) henceforth, to require the declaration of actual contribution of each of the 

members of the JV in their JVA pursuant to Section 23.4.1.1 (e) of the IRR. 

 

Management Comments: 

 

243. The terms of the JVA are sufficient to determine the Filipino ownership in the 
subject JV notwithstanding the absence of a direct statement on the actual contributions of 

each of the members of JV. Undisputed is the fact that the JVA specifically states that 

LDLA’s ownership and interest in the JV is 70% while Computrade consists of 30%. 

Further, the JVA states that LDLA and Computrade “agree to join together their cash, 

manpower, equipment and what is needed to facilitate the Joint Venture to participate in 

the Eligibility, Bidding and Undertaking xxx.” With all due respect, the only tenable 

interpretation is that LDLA’s and Computrade’s contribution to the JV is 70% and 30%, 

respectively, and nothing else. Any other interpretation would result in utter disregard of 

the evident intention of the parties to the JVA. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

244. The subject AOM neither challenges the validity of the JVA nor questions the 
regularity of its notarization. Our observation centers on the compliance of the bidder with 

the eligibility requirements pursuant to Section 23.4.1.1 (e) of the 2016 IRR of RA 9184. 

While we maintain our view that the actual contribution of the JV members should be 

reflected in the JVA, we agree that the provision in the JVA showing the shares owned by 

each members of the JV may be considered as substantial compliance with the rules. 

 

Procurement of various ICT equipment and e-learning applications not in 

accordance with the approved APP (Procurement Nos. 11 and 12) 

 

245. Section 7, Article II of RA 9184 states: 
 

All procurement should be within the approved budget of the Procuring Entity 

and should be meticulously and judiciously planned by the Procuring Entity 

concerned. 

x x x 

 

No government Procurement shall be undertaken unless it is in accordance 

with the approved Annual Procurement Plan of the Procuring Entity. 

 

246. The Technology for Education, Employment, Entrepreneurs, and Economic 
Development (Tech4ED) is a program of the DICT that provides ICT-enabled services to 



81  

communities that have minimal access or no access to ICT and government services. As a 

national digital inclusion initiative, the Tech4ED Program caters to disadvantaged 

communities such as rural and urban poor, PWDs and indigenous communities.11 
 

247. During CY 2018 and 2019, the DICT procured the two (2) projects for the 
implementation of the Tech4ED program, both awarded to LDLA Marketing and Trading, 

Inc., with a total amount of ₱214,726,892.00. 

 

248. According to their Terms of Reference, the projects aim to provide IT equipment 
and software and e-learning materials to numerous public schools and LGUs necessary to 

achieve the government’s goal for quality education and efficient services to the people. 

 

249. Analysis of pertinent documents showed the variance between the following: (a) 
Budget chargeable against the Capital Outlay (CO) and Maintenance and Other Operating 

Expenses (MOOE) as specified in the Annual Procurement Plan (APP); and (b) the amount 

paid for each component as enumerated in the PO:

250. As shown in the Table, out of the total budget for CO of ₱205,000,000.00, the DICT 
has procured various ICT equipment/software costing ₱135,618,996.00 leaving a balance 

of ₱69,381,004.00. On the other hand, the budget allotted for MOOE was ₱10,000,000.00 

while the amount incurred for training and licenses was a total of ₱79,107,896.00 which is 

way more than the approved budget; thus, leaving a negative balance of (₱69,107,896.00). 

This is contrary to Section 7, Article II of RA 9184 which explicitly states that “no 

government Procurement shall be undertaken unless it is in accordance with the approved 

Annual Procurement Plan of the Procuring Entity.” 

 

251. Further, Sections 72 and 76 of the GAA for FY 2018 and 2019 states: 
 

Rules on Modification in Allotment. As a general rule, departments, bureaus and 

offices of the national government, including Constitutional Offices enjoying 

fiscal autonomy and SUCs shall spend what is programmed in their respective 

appropriations in this Act. In exceptional circumstances, agencies may modify 

the allotment issued within an activity or project subject to approval of the 

following ensued by the timely submission of reports by all offices concerned:

(a) The heads of agencies for change in the object of expenditure (Salaries and 
Wages, Travelling Expenses, or Investment Outlays) within an allotment 

class (Personnel Services, MOOE, Financial Expenses or Capital Outlays); 

 

(b) The DBM, in the following modifications: (i) from one allotment class to 
another; (ii) from one operating unit to another; (iii) within a special 

purpose fund; and (iv) for the payment of magna carta benefits authorized 

under /section 50 hereof. (Emphasis supplied) 

x x x 

 

252. In order to fully utilize the approved budget, the DICT could have requested for the 
modification of the approved budget. However, records do not show whether the DICT 

requested the DBM for the modification of one allotment class to another, i.e., CO to 

MOOE and vice versa. 

 

253. We recommended that Management: (a) submit an explanation on why the 
items procured in these projects were not in accordance with the approved APP 

and/or a document showing the amended APP or the approval of the DBM for the 

modification of the allotment from CO to MOOE and vice versa, whichever is 

applicable; and (b) direct the Director of Finance Service and the Chief Accountant 

to submit justification for allowing the payment of items contrary to the approved 

budget. 

 

254. As of this report, the Audit Team has not received any Management comment 
pertaining to the foregoing observations and recommendations. 

 

Failure to post additional performance security or request for extension of the 

original performance security in order to guarantee the faithful performance of 

LDLA of its obligations (Procurement Nos. 11 and 12) 
 

255. Section 39, Rule XI of the IRR of RA 9184 states that “to guarantee the 
performance of the winning bidder of its obligations under the contract in accordance with 

the bidding documents, it shall post a performance security prior to the signing of the 

contract.” 

 

256. Perusal of the performance security (surety bond) posted by LDLA for project 
“Supply and Delivery of Information Technology Equipment Hardware Bundled with 

software and E-learning Applications of the DICT for the Tech4Ed Schools” (Procurement 

No. 11) amounting to ₱124,935,412.00 disclosed that the liability of the surety, Travellers 

Insurance & Surety Corporation, under the bond “will expire on 05 September 2019 and 

the said Bond shall be deemed automatically cancelled fifteen (15) days after its expiration 

unless the Surety is notified of any existing obligations thereunder”. In Notice for Third 

Extension issued by then Undersecretary Elisio M. Rio, Jr., the delivery of the training was 

extended until 08 September 2019. However, the DICT failed to request for the posting of 

additional bond or the extension of the validity of the original surety bond. Further, there 

is no showing in the records whether such request was made by the DICT. Hence, from 09 



83  

September 2019 to the date of completion of delivery on 16 January 2020, the DICT was 

not protected by any performance security in case of breach of contract by the LDLA. This 

posed risk against the government and placed it in a disadvantageous position. 

 

257. We recommended that Management submit an explanation on its failure to 
post additional performance security or request for extension of the original 

performance security in order to guarantee the faithful performance of the 

supplier’s obligations. 

 

258. As of this report, the Audit Team has not received any Management comment 
pertaining to the foregoing observation and recommendation. 

 

259. Other deficiencies noted: (Procurement No. 4). Obligation Request and Status 
(ORS) No. 02-LFP-01101101-2020-03-0647 showed that the Account Code of 5-02-99- 

070-01 was used. This pertains to Subscription Expenses, an account used for subscription 

of reading materials; hence, not the appropriate account code for this transaction. 

 

260. We recommended that Management require the Budget Officer to: (a) make 
the necessary adjustment on the ORS to reflect the correct Account Code; and (b) 

henceforth, ensure that the correct account code is used in the Agency’s transactions. 
 

261. As of this report, the Audit Team has not received any Management comment 
pertaining to the foregoing observation and recommendation. 

 

Non-submission of contracts within five (5) calendar days (CD) from date of 

execution and non-submission of authenticated copy of supporting documents 
 

262. Item 3.1.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated 12 February 2009 states that 
“within five (5) working days from the execution of a contract by the government x x x, a 

copy of said contract and each of all the documents forming part thereof by reference or 

incorporation shall be furnished to the Auditor of the agency concerned.” 

 

263. Here, the following table shows the number of days elapsed from date of execution 
until the date of receipt of the Audit Team:

but the appearance does not include the phrase “digitally signed” and 

provides no date and time of signing, the printed copy should be 

authenticated by either: (i) stamping on the face of the document the 

phrase “certified true copy” specifically indicating the full name, 

designation, signature and date and time of signing; or (ii) by submitting a 

certification by the concerned office or personnel of the DICT stating that 

it is an authentic digital signature; (Procurement Nos. 1, 2, 9 and 10) and 

 

b. The PCMD or other concerned office to: (i) submit to the Audit Team all 
contracts/purchase orders, together with its supporting documents, within 

five (5) working days from its execution pursuant to COA Circular No. 

2009-001; (Procurement Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 8); and (ii) submit the original 

or authenticated copies of the enumerated documents. (Procurement Nos. 

1 to 11)

Low fund utilization 

 

267. Out of the ₱3,351,211,862.80 allotted for the DICT programs, only 
₱2,185,909,131.93 or 65.23 percent were obligated while ₱406,827,567.73 or 18.61 

percent of obligated funds were disbursed indicating an overall low fund utilization 

rate and very low disbursement rate which may adversely affect the delivery of vital 

services to the public especially during this time of pandemic. Further, out of the 

continuing allotments totaling ₱3,110,833,949.12, the utilization rate is an average of 

80 percent but the disbursement rate was a mere 18.76 percent and the unobligated 

balance of ₱563,939,458.67 may lapse at year end even before its full utilization and 

completion of the intended projects. 

 

268. Section 29, Article VI of the Constitution states that “no money shall be paid out 
of the Treasury except in pursuance of an appropriation made by law.” 

 

269. Section 60 of the General Provisions of RA 11465, also known as the FY 2020 
GAA, states: 

 

Cash Budgeting System. All appropriations authorized in this Act, including 

budgetary support to GOCCs, shall be available for release and disbursement 

for release and disbursement for the purpose specified, and under the same 

general and special provisions applicable thereto, until December 31, 2020. 

x x x. 

 

After the end of validity period, all unreleased appropriations shall lapse, while 

unexpended or undisbursed funds shall revert to the unappropriated surplus of 

the General Fund in accordance with Section 28, Chapter 4, Book VI of E.O. 

No. 292 and shall not thereafter be available for expenditure except by 

subsequent legislative enactment. Departments, bureaus, and offices of the 

National Government, including constitutional offices enjoying fiscal 

autonomy, SUCs and GOCCs, shall strictly observe the validity of 

appropriations and the reversion of funds. 

 

270. It is the declared policy of the State that all resources of the government shall be 
managed, expended or utilized in accordance with law and regulations, and safeguard 

against loss or wastage through illegal or improper disposition, with a view to ensuring 

efficiency, economy and effectiveness in the operations of government. The responsibility 

to take care that such policy is faithfully adhered to rests directly with the chief or head of 

the government agency concerned.12 Fiscal responsibility shall, to the greatest extent, be 

shared by all those exercising authority over the financial affairs, transactions, and 

operations of the government.13 This include, among others, the proper planning and 

formulation of strategies in order to fully utilize the Agency’s budget and perform its 

mandate.

271. The DICT is mandated to be the primary policy, planning, coordinating, 
implementing, and administrative entity of the Executive Branch of the government that 

will plan, develop, and promote the national information and communications technology 

(ICT) development agenda. 

 

272. During FY 2020, the DICT had a total appropriation of ₱10,327,905,883.12. 
Analysis of the Statement of Appropriations, Allotments, Obligations and Disbursements

273. As shown in Table 37, the DICT was able to obligate ₱5,635,711,806.31 of the total 
allotment of ₱7,457,884,883.12 showing an overall utilization rate of 76 percent. However, 

it was able to disbursed a total of ₱1,677,358,965.15 out of the said obligation or a dismal 

29.76 percent only. Moreover, under current appropriations, the very low utilization rate is 

apparent for Capital Outlay (CO) with total allotment of ₱294,956,000.00 which posted 16 

percent utilization rate and 9.4 percent disbursement rate. On the other hand, the MOOE 

with total allotment of ₱3,268,425,840, posted a utilization rate of 70 percent but has a 

disbursement rate of 24.57 percent only. 

 

274. With respect to the continuing appropriations totaling ₱3,110,833,949.12, the 
utilization rate is an average of 80 percent but the disbursement rate was a mere 18.76 

percent only. At the end of FY 2020, there still remains an unobligated balance of 

₱563,939,458.670      (allotments      of      ₱3,110,833,949.12      less      obligations     of 



89  

₱2,546,894,490.45) which may lapse at year end even before its full utilization and 

completion of the intended projects. 

 

275. Further analysis showed the following utilization rate for the DICT’s programs:

276. As shown in Table 38, the DICT programs with total allotment of 
₱3,351,211,862.80 posted an overall utilization and disbursement rate of 65.23 percent and 

18.61 percent, respectively. Specifically, ICT Systems and Infrastructure Development, 

Management and Advisory Program has a relatively fair utilization rate of 74.14 percent 

but suffered a very low disbursement rate of 15.10 percent. On the other hand, the ICT 

Governance has a low utilization rate of 50.61 percent while the ICT Capacity 

Development and Management Program has a very low utilization rate of 29.16 percent. 

 

277. Moreover, while the Free Internet WI-FI Connectivity has the highest utilization 
rate of 93.98 percent among the DICT projects, it has, however, a very low disbursement 

rate of 9.01 percent. Records showed that the balance of undisbursed obligations of 

₱1,248,295,838.19 (Obligations amounting to ₱1,371,954,231.48 less Disbursement of 

₱123,658,393.29) comprises the ₱1,005,189,385.51 which were obligated in December 

2020. The latter includes the following: (a) due and demandable accounts payable 

amounting to ₱355,718,152.85 which were set up for Free WI-FI contract extensions; and 

(b) not yet due and demandable accounts payable amounting to ₱649,471,232.66 pertaining 

to obligations for procurement contracts awarded in December 2020. This shows that some 

procurement activities were undertaken on the last quarter of the year but most were 

awarded in December 2020 which may have resulted in the deferment of delivery of goods 

and services. 

 

278. We already requested for the submission of the basis for recognition of the DICT’s 
not yet due and demandable accounts payable as at 31 December 2020 including the 

supporting documents thereof. We are still waiting for its compliance as of this report. 

 

279. Finally, the National ICT Household Survey program of the DICT has a utilization 
rate of 56.95 percent but has no disbursement as at year-end. Meanwhile, the National 

Government Portal has a very low utilization and disbursement rate of 24.88 percent and 

17.88 percent, respectively. 

 

280. In sum, the timely and efficient implementation of the aforementioned 
programs/projects are necessary in order for the Department to attain its organizational 

outcomes, and its allotment utilization rate reflects its implementation capabilities. Based 

on the foregoing conditions, it appears that the Department was not able to maximize the 

utilization of the appropriations and allotments which may adversely affect its delivery of 

services to the public especially in this time of pandemic where the DICT is in the frontline 

of government’s response against the COVID-19 and when most employees are working 



91  

at home and students are attending classes online. This could mean that the Department 

has low capability to utilize legislated budget or it may have set ambitious targets with a 

huge amount of appropriations disregarding its absorptive capacity. 

 

281. We recommended that Management: 
 

a. Submit an explanation on: (i) the causes/reasons for low utilization rate of 
the CY 2020 allotments and continuing allotments; and (ii) the reasons for 

the very low disbursement rate of obligated funds; 
 

b. Require the Budget Division to submit to the Audit Team the basis for 
recognition of the not yet due and demandable accounts payable of the 

DICT as at 31 December 2020, together with its supporting documents, for 

its verification; and 
 

c. Institute measures to improve DICT’s fiscal planning in order to address 
the gap between the allotted budget and the actual disbursement, and to 

fully implement the program/project/activities of the agency. 
 

282. As of this report, the Audit Team has not received any Management comment 
pertaining to the foregoing observations and recommendations. 

 

Other Compliance Issues 
 

Gender and Development (GAD) 

 

283. Programs, projects and activities (PPAs) in the GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) 
were either partially implemented or not implemented as of the end of the year; hence, 

the low utilization rate of the budget which is not in accordance with RA No. 11465 

or the GAA for FY 2020. Moreover, the Accomplishment Report was not submitted 

to the Auditor within the period prescribed under Item V of COA Circular No. 2014- 

001 dated 18 March 2014. 

 

a) Low utilization rate, and partial/non-implementation of some GAD programs, projects 
and activities 

 

284. Section 31 of RA 11465 or the GAA for FY 2020 provides that all agencies of the 
government shall formulate a GAD plan designed to address gender issues within their 

concerned sectors or mandate and implement the applicable provisions under RA 9710 or 

the Magna Carta for Women, Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 

Discrimination Against Women, the Beijing Platform for Action, the Philippine Plan for 

Gender-Responsive Development (1995-2025) and the Philippine Development Plan 

(2017-2022). It also provides that the GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities 

of the agencies, which shall be at least five percent (5%) of the agency’s budget. 

 

285. The agency had a total appropriation of P4,098,698,840.00 for the year 2020. Out 
of said amount, it allocated P1,820,887,875.09 or 44.43% thereof for the implementation 



92  

of GAD activities, classified into two (2) groups namely: (a) Client-focused Activities; and 

(b) Attributed Programs, constituting 90.88% and 9.12% of the total GAD budget, 

respectively. 

 

286. The DICT has submitted the Accomplishment Report (AR) to the Philippine 
Commission on Women (PCW) and is still under review; however, an advance copy of 

that document for reference in audit was provided to the audit team only on March 18, 

2021 which is beyond the prescribed period provided by COA Circular No. 2014-001 dated 

18 March 2014. 

 

287. Evaluation of the AR disclosed that the actual expenditures incurred for CY 2020 
compared against the budget allocated for each GAD activity showed low overall 

utilization rate of only 25.99%, as shown in the table below:

Total 1,820,887,875.09 473,182,478.01 25.99% 
 

288. Review of the report disclosed that some of the PPAs identified in the GPB and AR 
as client-focused undertakings were either partially implemented or not implemented at all; 

hence, the low utilization rate of the GAD budget, the details of which are presented in the 

table below.

Number of attendees was 
not met. Management 
stated that the intended 
attendees are the GAD 
Project focal persons, 
RCO GAD focal persons, 
and CODI officers, and that 
resource speaker as well 
requested a limited 
number of participants to 
efficiently manage the 
discussion. 

 

289. Moreover, we noted that attributed programs or the regular/flagship programs and 
projects of the DICT, i.e., Free WiFi, Tech4Ed, among others, which are considered as 

programs supporting GAD Plans and Programs, also incurred low utilization rates 

registering at 25.78% only out of its total budget. 

 

290. The low utilization rate for the implementation of these attributed programs, as well 
as the client-focused activities, were mainly due to the negative impact of the COVID-19 

pandemic which resulted in lockdowns and limited human activities around the world. The 

Management also reasoned that some of these activities were originally planned to be 

conducted on a face-to-face manner and the cost estimates for the budget were based on a 

pre-pandemic setting. However, the imposition of community quarantine necessitated the 

shift to virtual activities which were less costly as compared to the original plan. 

 

291. In Luzon Cluster 1, the GAD Focal Point System (GFPS) informed that the 
activities were not implemented because the focal person retired in January 2020, and the 

members of the GFPS were based in field offices and they had no training yet on GAD. 

 

292. In light of the discussions above, due to its inability to completely implement or 
meet the targeted outputs on GAD PPAs, the Agency is short in its objective of fully 

addressing the identified gender gaps and issues not only for the personnel of the DICT but 

also the public who are the intended recipients of the programs and services of the agency. 

 

293. We recommended that Management require the Heads of implementing 
departments/offices to: 

 

a. adopt new strategies and/or appropriate methodologies to ensure that 
GAD programs, projects and activities are implemented as planned even 

during the time when group or physical activities are limited due to health 

protocols brought about by the pandemic; 

 

b. reconsider GAD activities which are partially and not implemented for CY 
2020 to be included in formulating GAD Plan and Budget for the 

succeeding years; and 



94  

c. maximize the utilization of GAD funds through the implementation of 
GAD-related programs and projects in order to attain the objectives to 

which the funds were provided. 

 

294. We also recommended, in Luzon Cluster 1, that the members of the GAD 
Focal Point System undergo training on GAD planning, budgeting, and monitoring 

and evaluation. 

 

Management comments 

 

295. The low utilization rate was attributed mainly to the negative impact of the COVID- 
19 pandemic, where conduct of physical activities was restricted. Due to COVID-19 

pandemic, several plans of the national government were shelved to free up funds for 

COVID-19 response, which is also one of the agency’s reason for non-implementation of 

some of its planned projects in adherence to NB Circular No. 580. With respect to the low 

participation and number of attendees, the participants involved were mostly unprepared 

to the immediate shift to virtual activities due to the learning curved involved. The 

pandemic also prevented the implementation of GAD attributed projects due to strict health 

protocols. The Management issued a Memorandum signed by the Honorable Secretary 

enjoining all concerned offices to adhere to the recommendations under “i”. Further, GAD 

activities that were partially/not implemented for CY 2020 are already included in the GAD 

Plan and Budget for 2021, on attributed projects (e.g. Digital Workforce). 

 

b) Late submission of Accomplishment Report 
 

296. COA Circular No. 2014-001 dated 18 March 2014 provides that “the Audited 
agency shall submit a copy of the Annual GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) to the COA Audit 

Team assigned to the agency within five (5) working days from the receipt of the approved 

plan from the PCW or their mother or central offices as the case maybe. Likewise, a copy 

of the corresponding Accomplishment Report shall be furnished the said Audit Team within 

five (5) working days from the end of January of the preceding year.” 

 

297. Based on record, the initial/advance copy of the AR was submitted by the DICT to 
the Audit Team only on 18 March 2021, or 72 days elapsed from the supposed deadline 

provided by the aforementioned issuance. While it is true that the PCW allowed its 

submission beyond what is required by the above-cited circular (i.e., for CY 2019 AR, 

PCW set the deadline on 28 February 2020; and for CY 2020, the deadline was on 12 

March 2021), an initial or advance copy should have been provided to the Audit Team in 

order to facilitate the audit of the concerned transactions. 

 

298. The delayed submission of reports, such as the AR, prevented us from conducting 
a timely audit of the GAD activities as well as the timely communication to Management 

of the recommendations which may be beneficial to the ongoing implementation of GAD 

PPAs for the succeeding year. 



95  

299. We recommended that Management require the GFPS to strictly adhere to 
Item V of COA Circular No. 2014-001 dated 18 March 2014 for the timely submission 

of the initial/advance copy of said report to the COA Audit Team. 

 

Management comments: 

 

300. Due to the pandemic, collation of relevant documents and reports were very 
limited. Health restrictions posed a great challenge for manpower and personnel to have 

access to actual records that contributed to the delay in the submission of 

Accomplishment Report. In acknowledgment of the Auditor’s recommendations on the 

strict adherence to COA rules and regulations, Management shall require all 

implementing offices to submit to the GFPS reports on all activities and actions taken to 

systematize the collection of data, thereby, expediting formulation of reports. 

 

Programs/Projects for Senior Citizens (SCs), Persons with Disabilities (PWDs), and the 

Youth 

 

301. Section 32 of the General Provisions of the FY 2020 GAA provides that all agencies 
of the government shall formulate plans, programs and projects intended to address the 

concerns of SCs and PWDs, insofar as it relates to their mandated functions, and integrate 

the same in their regular activities. It further requires that all government infrastructure and 

facilities shall provide architectural or structural features, designs or facilities that will 

reasonably enhance the mobility, safety and welfare of the persons with disability pursuant 

to Batas Pambansa (BP) Blg. 344 and RA 7277, as amended. 

 

302. Section 33 thereof states that all agencies shall provide allocations for youth 
development projects and activities within the framework of the Philippine Youth 

Development Plan (2017-2022). 

 

303. Management integrated in its program various activities for the SCs, PWDs and the 
Youth, among which are the following: 

 

a. Trainings under the Digital Literacy Trainings; 
 

b. Webinar series on Data Driven Governance, Data Privacy protection, Digital 
Transformative Technologies, and Cybersecurity Competency Framework; 

 

c. Technical assistance in ZDS Provincial Zoom Orientation on RA 11350 or the 
National Commission on Senior Citizen and online meeting on 3rd Regional 

Committee on disability affairs; and 

 

d. Webinars intended to address the concerns of youth despite the ongoing 
COVID-19 pandemic that restricted mobility among employees and 

stakeholders. 

 

304. We recommended that Management continuously comply with the General 
Provisions of the GAA in addressing the concerns of SCs, PWDs and Youth. 



96  

Hiring of Consultants/Contractual/Job Order (JO) Personnel 

 

305. During the year, the DICT and its FOOs had 1,637 personnel, consisting of 404 
regular plantilla position employees, 2 Secondment, 265 co-terminus, 72 consultants and 

894 Job Order employees. The total amount of ₱234,634,337.48 for the services of 

consultants/contractual/JO personnel was charged under accounts Consultancy Services, 

Other Professional Services and Other General Services. 

 

Compliance with tax laws, GSIS, Pag-IBIG and PhilHealth premiums Laws, and Property 

Insurance Law 

 

306. The Table below shows the status of compliance by the DICT with pertinent tax 
laws, deduction and remittance of premiums/contributions and loan installments for the 

GSIS, PhilHealth and Pag-IBIG as well as insurance of all insurable assets with the General 

Insurance Fund in CY 2020.

remained uninsured with the General Insurance Fund (GIF) of the GSIS. 

 

In addition, in LC1, insurable properties amounting to ₱59,127,918.48 were 
not fully covered with the GIF. 

 

In VC1, property, assets and interests were not covered with the GIF. 
 

In MC2, Management did not insure all their buildings with a book value of 
₱40,893,799.65 with the GIF.

Area 
Accounts 
Affected 

Status/Compliance with Laws 

  The lack of adequate insurance exposed the government to unnecessary risk 
of not being indemnified for any damage or loss due to any fortuitous events. 

 

307. However, review in CY 2020 revealed that significant balances of Due to BIR, Due 
to GSIS, Due to Pag-IBIG and Due to PhilHealth accounts existed as at 30 November 2020. 

It is good to note that for CY 2020, the withheld amounts were almost equal with the 

remittances but the beginning balances could not be validated due to lack of documents. 

 

308. Inquiry with the personnel from the Accounting Division disclosed that portions of 
the unaccounted balances are carried over from the defunct agencies without the proper 

supporting schedules and not duly supported with documents and remittances from 

different FOOs which were yet to be completely analyzed and segregated before recording 

in the books. 

 

309. It is to be noted that recording of transactions is centralized in the DICT-CO which 
means that records and reports from FOOs, i.e., General Journal, Cash Receipts Journal, 

and Check Disbursements Journal, are submitted to CO as bases for recording. 

 

310. Further inquiry disclosed that a monitoring report on the withheld amounts and 
remittances thereof is being maintained by a staff of Accounting Division who was then 

transferred to the Internal Audit Service, thus monitoring of accounts was no longer 

updated. 

 

311. The possible delayed/non-remittance of said balances, if any, poses uneconomical, 
inefficient and ineffective disposition of government assets by paying penalties, surcharges 

and interests which could have been prevented had there been timely remittance. 

 

312. We recommended that Management require: 
 

a. The Finance Service and Accounting Division of both the DICT-CO and 
the FOOs to immediately remit the remaining balances due to the BIR, 

GSIS, Pag-IBIG and PhilHealth, if any; 

 

b. The GSD or any concerned office to: 
 

i. submit explanation for DICT’s failure to insure all its insurable assets 
with the GIF of the GSIS and to comply with the requirements of COA 

Circular No. 2018-002; 

 

ii. impose sanctions for non-compliance therewith, if warranted; and 
 

iii. henceforth, apply for the insurance of all insurable properties of the 
DICT; and 



98  

c. The IAS or any concerned office to evaluate the existing internal control 
system and craft the proposed internal control procedure/policies to 

properly insure all insurable assets of the DICT. 
 

313. As of this report, the Audit Team has not received any Management comment 
pertaining to the foregoing observations and recommendations.
