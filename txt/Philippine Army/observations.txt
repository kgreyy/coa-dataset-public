II – OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



Accounting Errors



1)	The reliability of PA’s Consolidated Financial Statements cannot be established due to accounting errors and omissions totaling P4,526,718,411.42 which include unrecorded deposits, inventories, and PPEs, erroneous recording of fund transfers, unreconciled accounting and property records, non-preparation and submission of RSMIs, among others; thereby, resulted in the misstatement of affected accounts.



	1)	The International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) requires that the financial statements shall present fairly the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful presentation of the effects of transactions, other events and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income and expenses set out in the IPSAS.----footnote1----



	2)	Each government agency shall record its financial transactions and operations conformably with the generally accepted accounting principles and in accordance with pertinent laws, rules and regulations.----footnote2---- 



	3)	On a test basis and based on the financial records submitted, we performed the standard procedures such as review, examination, verification and analysis, among others, for the audit of the accounts presented in the financial statements of the PA. The accounting errors and omissions resulted in the misstatement of account balances as presented below:

Unrecognized stale checks



	2)	Section 44, Chapter 6 of GAM Volume 1 states that: Checks may be cancelled when they become stale, voided or spoiled. The depository bank considers a check stale, if it has been outstanding for over six months from date of issue or as prescribed.



	3)	On the period of validity of government checks, the BTr issued Treasury Circular No. 03-2017 dated 20 October 2017, reducing the expiry period of MDS checks from six (6) months to three (3) months from date of issue for the purpose of reducing the large balances of outstanding MDS checks. This is to simplify the reconciliation and monitoring of outstanding checks as stated in the Circular.



	4)	Stale checks totaling P2,520,234.67 in the HPA----footnote10---- and 7th ID were neither cancelled nor restored to Cash account, thereby, understating the Cash-MDS, Regular and Accounts Payable accounts by the same amount.

	5)	Section 56, Chapter 9 of GAM Volume I provides that all unreleased checks at the end of the year shall be reverted to the cash account by debiting Cash in Bank, Local Currency Current Account and crediting the appropriate liability account.



	6)	In 7th ID, unreleased checks amounting to P1,565,714.30 were not reverted to the cash accounts resulting in the understatement of the Cash in Bank, LCCA and related liability account.

Non-recognition of transferred FOL Inventory



	8)	Chapter 3 of the GAM Volume III prescribes that the Fuel, Oil and Lubricant Inventory account shall be credited for the issuance to end-users, transfers, loss or other disposal.



	9)	The total cost of FOL inventory received by PA recorded in the Subsidiary Ledgers (SL) of the operating units amounted to P437,319,861.71 while the total amount transferred to operating units per SL, was P331,178,540.42 leaving a balance of P106,141,321.29.



	10)	Inquiry with concerned personnel revealed that these FOL inventories were not received by the HPA but were delivered straight to operating units.  



	11)	To recognize constructive receipt of deliveries to operating units , the Accounting Service, Philippine Army (ASPA) recorded these by debiting Fuel, Oil and Lubricant Inventory and crediting Accounts Payable. However, verification of various JEVs revealed that the inventory account was only credited by ASPA several months later.  



	12)	The late recognition of the inventory transfers overstated the Fuel, Oil and Lubricant Inventory account and understated the Subsidy to Operating Units account of the HPA both by P106,141,321.29 as at year-end.



	13)	This practice may also give rise to double recording on both books of the concerned FAUs and the ASPA.



Unrecognized receipt of Military, Police and Traffic Supplies Inventory



	14)	In 7th ID, the 3FAU failed to recognize inventories received from the HPA----footnote13---- amounting to P375,981,369.95. Inquiry with concerned accounting personnel disclosed that the 3FPAO----footnote14---- and PAMUs----footnote15---- did not provide documents for the receipt, issuance and distribution of inventories. On the other hand, the concerned personnel in the Property Accountability Office advised that they were monitoring and maintaining records of received inventories; however, ASPA was not able to provide the transfer JEV to serve as basis in recording by 3FAU.



	15)	The non-recognition of the receipt of inventories understated the Military, Police and Traffic Supplies Inventory and Subsidy from Central Office accounts.

		

Unrecognized issuances of Military, Police and Traffic Supplies Inventory 



	16)	Section 7, Chapter 8 of the GAM Volume I states, when inventories are sold, exchanged, or distributed, their carrying amount shall be recognized as an expense in the period in which the related revenue is recognized. If there is no related revenue, the expense is recognized when the goods are distributed or the related service is rendered.”



	17)	Verification of the Summary of RSMI provided by PAO, GS showed issuances from stock totaling P229,265,250.61 in CY 2020 which were not yet derecognized in the books of ASPA; resulting in the overstatement of the account by the same amount.



	18)	In 7th ID, Military, Police, and Traffic Supplies Inventory (MPTSI) totaling P356,591,924.65 issued to different PAMUs under the 3FPAOs were likewise unrecognized.



Unrecognized FOL deliveries



	19)	In 9th ID, 256,915 liters of fuel received from HPA valued at P11,026,169.00 were not recognized in the books resulting in the understatement of the Fuel, Oil and Lubricant Inventory and Subsidy from Central Office accounts both by the same amount.

	22)	In 2nd ID, motor vehicles amounting to P2,998,260.00 were not recorded in the books pending receipt of Property Transfer Reports (PTRs) and supporting documents from 4FPAO.



	23)	In 53rd EBde, motor vehicles and disaster response equipment amounting to P8,100,000.00 and P135,202.02, respectively, were also unrecognized due to absence of JEV from the ASPA.



	24)	Likewise, eight (8) units of 785XL-2 Motor Graders totaling P79,984,000.00 transferred to the 54th EBde were not recognized by the 16FAU as of year-end.



Unrecorded SFRA property



	25)	In 7th ID, a building costing P9,721,538.07 under the BCDA accounts of the Special Forces Regiment Airborne (SFRA) was reported in the RPCPPE but not recognized in the books.



Lost properties not derecognized from the books



	26)	In HPA, review of Requests for Relief from Property Accountability filed by PA personnel in 2019 and 2020 revealed that eight lost firearms costing P88,727.30 were still included under the Military, Police, Traffic and Security Equipment account as of year-end. Per records, the value of the lost firearms had already been paid for by the accountable officers through various ORs.----footnote19----



	27)	Likewise, 10 lost firearms in 9th ID totaling P487,974.89 were not derecognized from the books of accounts due to non-submission of Notices of Loss and RLSDDP for lost properties by the concerned AOs.



Non-derecognition of PPE transferred to field units



	28)	Transferred PPE from HPA to field units totaling P209,405,510.65 were not dropped from the books of accounts as of December 2020. Moreover, since the transferred PPE were still recorded in the books, the related Depreciation Expense was also misstated making balances of affected accounts unreliable.



Improper recognition of loaned firearms



	29)	In 2nd ID, 394 units of firearms totaling P3,401,594.00 received on loan basis in CY 2014 from the AFP Western Command were recorded in the books under the Military, Police and Security Equipment account.

	33)	In 9th ID, 17 units of motor vehicles costing P3,515,170.00 were erroneously credited to the Accumulated Surplus (Deficit) account instead of Donations in Kind and Subsidy from Central Office accounts.



	34)	Likewise, financial support for the period August 1 to December 31, 2020 totaling P39,032,000.00 granted to several members of the Citizen Armed Forces Geographical Unit Active Auxiliary (CAA) units were not recognized in the books as at year-end resulting in the understatement of the Expense and Liability accounts.



	35)	Moreover, financial support for the period July 1 to December 31, 2019 amounting to P48,056,000.00 was not recognized as liability at the end of CY 2019 but recorded under the Subsidies-Others account in July 2020, thereby, overstating the current year’s expenses.----footnote22----



	36)	The foregoing errors resulted in the misstatement of various accounts casting doubt on the fairness of the PA’s financial position and performance presented in its Consolidated financial statements.



	37)	We recommended that Management direct the concerned accountants of ASPA and Field Accounting Units (FAUs) to correct immediately all accounting errors discussed herein.



	38)	Management comments, are summarized as follows:

The Accounting Unit replied and clarified during the Exit Conference that for reason of common consent by previous management and previous auditors, they have agreed not to revert the amount of unreleased checks and not to set up a liability account because all unreleased checks at the end of the year were all promptly encashed at the beginning of the succeeding year.

Receivables





Erroneous recording of fund transfers (FTs) to PITC

54EB

Management committed to immediately make appropriate adjusting entry for noted erroneous entry made for the fund transfers to PITC that will be reflected in the agency’s February 2021 monthly report.

Inventories



 

Late recognition of transferred FOL inventory

HPA



ASPA will transmit copies of JEVs for the transfer to the different field units of the remaining P52,929,481.99 out of the P106,141,321.29 in the books of accounts as of 31 December 2020.

Non-recognition of receipt/ issuance of MPTSI





A total of P62 million received RSMIs from PAO-GS was already recorded under various JEVs. As for the remaining unrecognized issuances, ASPA is yet to receive the pertinent supporting documents for the receipt of Military, Police, Traffic and Security Inventories procured mostly with Letters of Credit as mode of payment.



7ID

The Chief Property Officer (CPO) assured the Audit Team that they have all the records/reports ready for submission, that instead of waiting for the transfer JEV from HPA, they will submit the report to the accounting office who will then follow up the transfer of JEV to HPA to facilitate the process. The Chief Accountant concurred with the CPO’s suggestion and further stated that they will wait for the submission of the RSMI and RIS from the property office.

Unrecognized FOL deliveries

9ID

The Field Accountant averred that the procedure of relying only to journal entries of ASPA in recording of fuel deliveries is the existing practice of PA. She already elevated the matter to the Chief, ASPA for guidance. The Command committed to implement the prescribed procedure in the recording of fuel deliveries in fiscal year 2021. The timely recognition of FOL deliveries in the books of accounts will be based on the submission of Inspection and Acceptance Report and Sales Invoice by the units concerned.

PPE





Unrecognized PPE found in station

HPA



The unrecognized PPE found in station amounting to P66M were already recorded under JEV Nos. 2021-01-002509 and 2021-01-002499.

Unrecognized PPE delivered in CY 2020



The unrecognized PPE delivered in CY 2020 were already recorded under JEV Nos. 2020-12-014391, 2020-12-014392 and 2021-03-000432.

Unrecognized PPE received from the HPA

2ID

The Chief, 4FAU stated that they have issued the corresponding JEV to record the said Motor Vehicles. The Chief 4FPAO committed to coordinate with PAO, GS, HPA to expedite issuance of PTRs for immediate transmittal to the 4FAU.



53EB

7FAU will closely coordinate with ASPA to verify transfer of PPEs from PAO, GS and coordinated already with Chief, FPAO to require PAO, GS to submit copy of JEV as counterpart of ASPA in recording transfer to FAUs; and that PAO, GS must be responsible to ensure that PPEs transferred to FPAOs will be recorded in accounting records on a timely basis.



54EB

Management informed the Audit Team that it had implemented the recommendation, whereby, the scanned copy of the Letter Request by 16FPAO and all pertinent documents to book up the transferred brand-new equipment were already forwarded by the 16FAU to ASPA to support its request for a copy of the JEV for the said transfer of equipment.

Unrecognized building under BCDA Fund - SFRA

7ID

The Chief Accountant confirmed that the unrecognized building of SFRA was already adjusted in the books per JEV No. 2021-01-001 dated 08 January 2021.

Lost properties not derecognized in the books

HPA

ASPA awaits supporting documents, specifically the Report of Lost, Stolen, Damaged, Destroyed Property (RLSDDP) from PAO, GS for the derecognition of lost properties.

Non-derecognition of PPE transferred to field units



A total of P12.8M was already recorded under various JEVs. As for the remaining amount unrecognized, ASPA awaits pertinent supporting documents to record the same in the books of accounts.

Lost properties not derecognized in the books

9ID

Management agreed to comply with the audit recommendations.  The 5FAU had already dropped from records one unit of 5.56mm R4A3 Carbine with JEV No. 2021-01-001 dated 28 January 2021 under AFPMF.

Improper recording of loaned equipment

2ID

The Chief, 4FAU said to have issued corresponding JEV to derecognize said firearms from PPELC of the Division. She acknowledged that recording was due to the result of PY’s physical inventory wherein said firearms were physically with the Battalion under this Division but not included/recorded in the PPELC.

Incorrect recording of unserviceable property

7ID

The 3FAU and 3FPAO made the required adjustments in the books in January 2021.

Misclassification of PPE accounts

3ID

Management said that JEVs were already made in the months of January and February 2021 except for the misclassification in ICT Equipment accounts since they believed that they classified it correctly based on SOP No. 14 dated November 10, 2017 which states that items such as projectors, telephone/cellphone, digital cameras, television and the like were classified as ICT Equipment.

Improper recognition of transferred projects

54EB

Management directed 16FAU to immediately conduct proper discussion and provide within seven days resolution of the recording without basis in agency’s books of accounts, in which the pertaining amount remained unadjusted.

Non-submission of required documents for lost properties

9th ID

Management agreed to comply with the audit recommendations.  The 5FAU had already dropped from records one unit of 5.56mm R4A3 Carbine with reference to JEV No. 2021-01-001 dated January 28, 2021 under AFP Modernization Fund. 

Other Accounts



 

Erroneous recording of donated/ transferred PPE

9ID



The Field Accountant committed to implement the recommended remedial action.

Unrecognized expenses



The 5FAU explained that as of 31 December 2020, no DVs and supporting documents were submitted to their Office for the payment of CAA service allowance for the period August 1 to December 31, 2020 to use as basis to recognize liability in the accounting records.  Further, the Accountant averred that per verification from the FMIS and the Office of MFO, 9ID, PA, there was no Advice of Sub-Allotment of Fund released to 9ID for that purpose.

Prior year expenses recorded in 2020



The 5FAU explained that as of December 31, 2019, no Advice of Sub-Allotment (ASA) was released to 9ID for the payment of CAA service allowance from July to December 2019.  Hence, while expenses were already incurred for that period, the same cannot be recognized as Accounts Payable in the accounting records.  DVs, Obligation Request and Status and supporting documents will be their basis to recognize said liability in the books.  Further, the allotment intended for payment of said claim was released on 18 March 2020 only thru ASA No. 0900-2020-0350.  Since fund was released by DBM, thru SARO, in 2020 and subsequently sub-allotted to PAMUs, payment was recognized as debit to Subsidies-Others account, instead of Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) account.



Auditor’s Rejoinder 



	39)	On classification of ICT Equipment in 3rd ID, the Audit Team maintained its position that the balance of ICT Equipment account was misstated as of December 31, 2020 since SOP No. 14 was not in accordance with COA Circular No. 2020-001 dated January 8, 2020 (Revised Chart of Accounts).



	40)	Management’s comments are duly noted and compliance to the recommendations will be strictly monitored.



Accounting Deficiencies



2)	Accounting deficiencies in recording and reporting financial transactions totaling P8,768,637,605.31 undermined the quality of information presented in the financial statements.  



	1)	Verification and analysis of the PA accounts and their underyling transactions showed accounting deficiencies in the aggregate amount of P8,768,637,605.31.

The 6FPAO has already submitted RSMI to 6FAU amounting to P972,421.58 while waiting for other units who have not yet submitted their RIS with the remaining amount of P229,693.73.

Non-submission of Report of Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI)

2nd ID

The 4FPAO and 4FAU stated that reconciliation of records has started last year but due to reassignment of personnel, it was temporarily halted.  They promised that this year, they will make sure that it will be continued. 



10th ID

The turned-in properties recorded in 1FSSU were already appraised by COA and for approval by ASCOM, PA.



52nd EBde

The Management provided the following comments:



--	The delay in the posting of JEV was due to late submission of documents from 10FPAO;



--	The only remaining unreconciled PPE balances left are those of the buildings, which the Accounting Unit (10FAU) has already booked up but the Property Unit (10FPAO) has not; and



--	Another reason for the delay in posting of JEV, particularly the vehicles, was the late forwarding of the PTR and transfer JEV by the ASPA, despite actual receipt and existence of the vehicles; hence, there is no basis for the 10FAU for the recording of said vehicles.  



53rd EBde

7FAU, ASPA, 7FPAO, APAO were exerting their best efforts to identify, correct and adjust the records of PPEs in order to reconcile the discrepancies in the trial balance.

Maintenance of inactive/unnecessary bank accounts



3)	The HPA continued to maintain 17 bank accounts with the LBP----footnote24---- which are already inactive and/or considered unnecessary; hence, contrary to Section 3, DOF-DBM-COA Joint Circular No. 4-2012 dated 11 September 2012. Likewise, submission of BRS remained delayed despite enrollment of some accounts with the Landbank weAccess; thus, not in keeping with Chapter 21 of GAM Volume 1. Moreover, three MDS accounts, instead of a single account, were utilized to fund intended disbursements through two level of transfer of funds from mother account to disbursing (FCPA) account which contribute to the volume of transactions.



Delayed/non-submission of BRS



	1)	Chapter 21 of GAM Volume I provides:



Section 3. The BRS shall be prepared in order to: (a) check correctness of both the bank’s and agency’s records; (b) serve as a deterrent to fraud; and (c) enable the agency/bank to take up charges or credits recognized by the bank/agency but not yet known to the agency/bank.

Unnecessary special and trust funds – authorized special and trust funds maintained by government agencies with AGDBs but which are no longer necessary for the attainment of the purposes for which said funds were established



	7)	EO No. 431 dated 30 May 2005 which prescribes reversion of all dormant accounts, unnecessary special and trust funds to the general funds and for other purposes, cites Section 29(3), Article VI of the Constitution which provides that once the purpose for which a special fund was created has been fulfilled or abandoned, the balance, if any, shall be transferred to the general funds of the government.



	8)	Review of records disclosed that 17 accounts were already inactive, some of which had no posted transactions in the SLs since CY 2016. Except for the 72-100RF account, 16 accounts had zero balances as of 31 December 2020. Details are as follows:

	10)	Since bank accounts were already inactive, though not yet dormant, we found it impractical to continue maintenance thereof. Further, the accounts under Trust Fund could already be considered unnecessary as defined under paragraph No. 3. 6 above.



	11)	Considering the limited manpower in ASPA, the continued preparation of required monthly BRS for inactive accounts could result to inefficient use of manhours and resources which could have been otherwise used for more productive tasks. Hence, if accounts are indeed unnecessary, closure thereof may be urgently considered if it would be beneficial to Management.



Conduit Accounts



	12)	Review of the nature of transactions recorded in each of the three MDS primary bank accounts under Regular Fund showed the following:



Account Number

Account Name

Transactions Recorded Per books (SL)





Debit

Credit

2168-9001-15

PA, CY (mother account)

Receipt of NCA----footnote26----

Transfers to 2168-9000-42 (ASPA)

2168-9000-42

PA, Accounting Service, CY (ASPA)

Transfers from 2168-9001-15 

(mother account)

Withdrawal of NTA and restoration to account

Issuance of NTA----footnote27----



Transfers to 2168-9000-85 (FCPA)

2168-9000-85

PA, FCPA, CY (FCPA)

Transfers from 2168-9000-42 (ASPA)

Various transactions/ disbursements (payments, remittances, etc.)



	13)	With the current set-up, issuance of NTAs is done thru ASPA account which also serves as a conduit account from the mother account to the Finance Center, Philippine Army (FCPA) account for funds intended for disbursements which contribute to the volume of transactions.



	14)	Taking into account the flow of funds from the mother account to the ASPA and FCPA accounts, it appears that the receipt of NCA, issuance of NTA and payment of expenses can be processed using a single account without the need to maintain all three bank accounts; thus, processing time could be greatly reduced that would redound to the benefit of the agency.









	15)	We recommended that Management:



a)	direct the Army Chief Accountant to submit immediately all unsubmitted BRS and observe timely submission of reports as prescribed by the GAM;



b)	consider the need to close without further delay those inactive and unnecessary accounts or provide satisfactory explanation as to the necessity for its continued maintenance including the maintenance of the three primary MDS accounts; and



c)	revert the remaining balance of P32,491,553.48 under the 72-100RF account to the BTr pursuant to EO No. 431. 



	16)	On the delayed/non-submission of BRS, Management commented that the ASPA was not able to submit required reports because of several lockdowns----footnote28---- of the office and delayed issuance of bank statements (BS) by LBP due to adoption of skeletal/alternative work arrangement and other precautionary measures.



	17)	Management further commented that they will immediately facilitate closure of 17 inactive accounts of PA.  Management asserted necessity of the identified conduit accounts in facilitating and monitoring efficient and timely disbursement of funds PA-wide.



	18)	Furthermore, Management will facilitate immediate reversion of the 72-100RF account balance of P32,491,553.48 to the BTr and the subsequent closure thereof.



	19)	Management’s comments are duly noted and compliance with the recommendations will be strictly monitored.



Dormant Receivables



4)	The balances of Due from Officers and Employees and Other Receivables accounts of six field units include dormant----footnote29---- accounts amounting to P1,193,394.40 and P3,200,276.98, respectively, which have been outstanding for 10 to 37 years, due to failure of Management to monitor liquidation of cash advances and enforce settlement of accounts; thus, collectability of the same is doubtful. 



	1)	Section 6.1 of COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated 19 December 2016 requires that “All government entities shall conduct regular monitoring and analysis of receivable accounts to ensure that these are collected when these become due and demandable and that cash advances and fund transfers are liquidated within the prescribed period depending upon their nature and purpose.”

	2)	Dormant receivables totaling P4,393,671.38 were noted in the following units:

	3)	We recommended that Management direct the concerned Accountant to:



a)	conduct regular monitoring and analysis of receivable accounts to ensure that these are collected when becomes due and demandable; 



b)	exhaust all possible remedies to collect receivables and demand liquidation thereof or file appropriate judicial action against AO or against his estate, if deceased, among others; and 



c)	reassess chances of recoverability of receivables, if warranted, and consider filing a request to write-off dormant accounts with COA pursuant to COA Circular No. 2016-005, dated December 19, 2016.



	4)	Management commented the following:



Unit

Management Comment

1st ID

Management served demand letters to the responsible officers whose accounts become due and demandable or dormant and will further comply with documentary requirements to request for authority to write-off said dormant accounts.

3rd ID

Management commented that the Accountant is coordinating with OG1 for the whereabouts of personnel with accountabilities so that demand for immediate settlement can be served and request for write-off will be submitted to AT for deceased AOs.



A letter request to write-off Other Receivables Account of deceased MUP (records of death confirmed by Philippine Statistics Authority) amounting to P204,732.15 has been submitted to the Resident Auditor, 3ID, on 23 March 2021.

4th ID

Management, particularly the representative from the 10FAU, recommended transfer of Other Receivables to PA HQ for the collection thereof.

7th ID

The Provost Marshal had consolidated all dormant accounts of  PA, sending letter to all accounts officers; however, only a small portion was deducted from the 7ID’s account because they can no longer locate the accountable officers. Moreover, the Accounting Unit will coordinate with the OG1, 7ID, PA for the request of related documents to write-off the accounts.  

52nd EBde

Management committed to send another demand letter through PAALAC----footnote30----.

53rd EBde

Several demand letters were already sent to the retiree reminding him of his accountability but to no avail. Secretary of PAALAC had already sent a letter to the Chief, AFP PGMC but as of this date, no update or letter-reply from Chief, PGMC was received by 7FAU.Management recommended to Secretary of PAALAC to deduct accountability from monthly pension of the retired AO and remit deductions to Collecting Officer, 7FSFO.



Long-outstanding balances of Due from GOCCs (PITC)



5)	The Due from Government Owned and/or Controlled Corporations balance of P9,129,158,169.51 includes excess balances/unutilized fund transfers amounting to P2,394,848,286.08 aged three years and above which were not refunded by PITC to the Philippine Army or remitted to the Bureau of the Treasury contrary to E.O. No. 431 and COA Circular 94-013. 



	1)	PA has been using the agency-to-agency mode of procurement by engaging PITC as a servicing agency to undertake its procurement. This is authorized under Section 53.6 of the Revised IRR of RA No. 9184 in order to hasten project implementation.----footnote31---- Under this mode of procurement, PA is governed by the MOA between AFP and PITC.----footnote32----



	2)	Section 4.9 of COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994 prescribing Rules and Regulations in the Grant, Utilization and Liquidation of Funds Transferred to Implementing Agencies (IAs) requires that the IA shall return to the Source Agency (SA) any unused balance upon completion of the project. In addition, DOF-DBM-COA Permanent Committee JC No. 4-2012 dated September 11, 2012 provides rules and regulations implementing EO No. 431 directing the reversion of all dormant accounts, unnecessary special and fund transfers to the general fund (GF) and for other purposes.

	4)	As can be gleaned from the table above, the long-outstanding fund transfers aged three (3) years and above amounted to P2,394,848,286.08. Its accumulation may have been avoided had PA Management closely monitored its procurement transactions with PITC. 



	5)	Moreover, analysis of fund transfers viz a viz its liquidations from 2007 to 2020 showed that residuals/outstanding balances amounted to P8,523,781,103.49 or equivalent to 46.49 percent completion only. Details, as follows:

	6)	Verification also showed that fund transfers made in CYs 2019 and 2020 showed dismal delivery rate or percentage of completion of 0.01 percent and 0.22 percent, respectively. The slow rate of delivery is indicative of poor monitoring in the procurement transactions of the PA with PITC.



	7)	In view of the foregoing circumstances, fund transfers to PITC may not be viewed in the context of hastening the Agency’s procurement or project implementation as contemplated in Section 53.6 of the Revised IRR of RA 9184. Rather, noted delays imply inefficient utilization of funds transferred and denied PA of the needed supplies and equipment that may have affected the Agency’s operational efficiency and effectiveness.



	8)	Despite reiteration of this observation in the audit reports, we have noted that PA still transfers funds to PITC. Such practice is viewed as disadvantageous to Agency considering that substantial amount of funds remains idle with PITC which could have been otherwise used to finance other worthwhile projects/activities of the government especially during this time of pandemic.



	9)	We reiterated our prior year’s recommendation that Management:



a)	demand the immediate refund of long-outstanding excess/unutilized balances totaling P2,394,848,286.08 and subsequently remit the same to the BTr; and 



b)	require the PITC to deliver immediately the requested items for procurement which are crucial in the Agency’s operations.



	10)	Management commented that out of the noted long-outstanding balance, only P1,374,860,654.52 remained outstanding per records of ASPA, breakdown as follows:

Total

P1,374,860,654.52





	11)	Management further commented that they will continue to engage PITC to fast track implementation of the 22 projects while for the nine projects in early stages of procurement, reversion to the BTr will be demanded. Moreover, they will send demand letter to PITC to settle unreconciled records of residuals/ liquidation in the amount of P554,986,353.54 and subsequently remit to the BTr once reconciled.



	12)	With regard to strict enforcement of PITC’s timely delivery, Management commented that arrangement with PITC has already been made to fast-track implementation of projects and a regular meeting with PITC will be conducted twice a month to ensure that implementation is effectively carried out.



Auditor’s Rejoinder



	13)	Verification disclosed that delivery of procured items totaling P90,705,361.57 funded out of 2018 fund transfers were recorded in various JEVs on April 23, 2021; thus, leaving a balance of P8,433,075,741.92 as of May 17, 2021.  Long-outstanding balance from PITC aged 3 years and above as appearing in the books of accounts remained at P2,394,848,286.08 not P1,374,860,654.52 as claimed. 



	14)	The Audit Team maintained its position that Management demand from PITC immediate refund of long- outstanding/unutilized balances and subsequently remit the same to the BTr.

 

Non-submission of accounting reports 



6)	The non-submission of accounting reports and supporting documents amounting to P412,655,610,203.21 limited the scope of audit and precluded prompt examination of transactions, detection and corrections of errors and deficiencies, and timely reporting of audit results to Management.



	1)	The Head of the Agency, who is primarily responsible for all government funds and property pertaining to his/her agency, shall ensure that the required financial and other reports and statements are submitted by the concerned agency officials in such form and within the period prescribed.----footnote33----



	2)	The Chief Accountant, Bookkeeper or other authorized officials performing accounting or bookkeeping functions are mandated to ensure that reports and supporting documents submitted by AOs are immediately recorded in the books of accounts and submitted to the Auditor within 10 days of the ensuing month.----footnote34----



	3)	Inventory of the accounting reports/documents of the HPA received as of 15 April 2021 for the following funds disclosed that out of the 16,855 posted JEVs----footnote35---- in CY 2020, 7,167 JEVs remained unsubmitted:

	5)	In summary, accounting reports and supporting records/documents for CY 2020 amounting to P412,655,610,203.21 were not submitted by HPA and five FUs.



	6)	The non-submission of those JEVs and other required financial reports with their supporting documents, limited the scope of audit and precluded prompt examination of those financial transactions, early detection and correction of errors/deficiencies and timely reporting of audit results to management. This observation had been raised in our prior years’ audit reports.



	7)	We recommended that Management direct the concerned Chief Accountants to submit without further delay all the unsubmitted financial reports and supporting documents for CY 2020 and henceforth, observe strictly the reporting deadlines.



	8)	In HPA, Management commented that P377 billion out of the P400 billion unsubmitted JEVs were already submitted to the Audit Team as of 17 May 2021. As for the remaining unsubmitted documents, Accounting Service Philippine Army (ASPA) is exerting efforts to immediately submit the same for post audit.



	9)	In 7th ID, the 3FAU reassured that all liquidation and DVs were accounted for and recorded in the agency books. Delay/non-submission within the prescribed deadline was due to voluminous transactions especially last December 2020.



	10)	In 9th ID, DVs totaling P476,601,872.78 were forwarded to COA for post-audit while the remaining are still held pending in 5th FSFO due to some noted deficiencies.  Once complied, said DVs shall be transmitted to COA without further delay. 



	11)	In 10th ID, the Accountant explained that the submission of JEVs within the prescribed period cannot be attained due to the volume of transactions and the difficulty in requesting supporting documents from HPA as basis in the recording of receipt of funds, inventories, and properties, among others.  To date, the Field Accountant has transmitted all JEVs for 2020 to the Office of the Auditor. 



	12)	Management’s comments are duly noted and compliance with recommendations will be strictly monitored.



Non-implementation of RMC projects



7)	The non-implementation of 10 projects from CYs 2015 to 2018 costing P85,578,868.65 resulted in unutilized Repairs, Maintenance and Construction (RMC) Funds and non-attainment of fund’s intended purpose; thus, depriving the agency of timely benefits that could have been derived therefrom had those projects been implemented as programmed.



	1)	RMC Fund is intended for the repair, maintenance, rehabilitation and construction of POL facilities as well as procurement of additional POL equipment in accordance with the POE duly approved by the HOPE.----footnote38----



	2)	The RMC Projects that will be implemented shall depend on the available RMC Funds paid in the hands of the Supplier out of Contracts (Lots 1, 2 and 3) and shall be completed depending on its nature and complexity for a duration as agreed upon by parties giving primordial consideration to the Entity’s intended utilization period.



	3)	The Status of RMC Fund Projects----footnote39---- as of 18 December 2020 showed unimplemented projects totaling P85,578,868.65, to wit:

	4)	As presented above, there were 10 projects from CYs 2015 to 2018 that remained unimplemented with zero percentage of completion as of 18 December 2020. 



	5)	The non-implementation of the aforesaid projects even after the lapse of two to five years resulted in unutilized RMC funds and non-attainment of the purpose to which said fund was set up; thus, depriving the agency of timely benefits that could have been derived therefrom had those projects been implemented as programmed.



	6)	The delayed implementation of said projects could be attributed to the absence of project timeline in the agreement between DND and Petron Corporation. 



	7)	We recommended that Management coordinate with Petron Corporation on   the immediate delivery/implementation of 10 projects under the RMC Fund and make a representation with DND on the inclusion of timeframe in the Memorandum of Agreement within which the project shall be undertaken. 



	8)	Management commented that the OAQM----footnote41---- had been in close coordination with Petron Corporation as supplier/contractor of ongoing projects. Implementation of Repairs, Maintenance and Construction (RMC) Funds-funded project normally takes some time to implement because of the following factors: (a) reconciliation of records (payments and computation of rebates) between PA-AFP and Petron which determines the generation of RMC Funds, usually takes time depending on the final payments made by PA-AFP of its POL procurement; (b) approval of projects under RMC Funds is at GHQ, AFP level; and (c) Petron conducts the procurement process and determines the availability of RMC Funds.



Outdated cost valuation of firearms



8)	The pecuniary liability of five PA personnel who filed their requests for relief from property accountability for lost firearms could not be established due to the outdated list of firearms contained in DND Circular No. 34----footnote42---- resulting in the stalled issuance of COA Decisions on said requests and subsequent settlement of liability, in case requests are denied.



	1)	COA Memorandum No. 92-751 dated 24 February 1992 prescribes the guidelines in documentation on petitions/request for relief from accountability.



	2)	DND----footnote43---- Circular No. 34 dated 17 September 1998 standardizes the valuation of firearms issued or loaned by AFP and other agencies under the DND to uniformed and/or civilian personnel of the AFP and other DND Bureaus/ Offices and to authorized personnel of the government and semi-government agencies or entities.



	3)	In the review of requests for relief from property accountability received in CY 2020, it was noted that five requests pertained to a new type/model of pistol particularly Pistol 9mm Glock 17 costing P17,474.76----footnote44----.



	4)	The aforementioned DND Circular does not include said type of firearm; thus, evaluation and subsequent issuance of COA Decisions on the requests cannot be completed due to lack of cost valuation as reference for the pecuniary liability.----footnote45----



	5)	Said Circular was issued in 1998 or more than two decades ago; hence, the cost valuation authorized therein is deemed outdated.  Moreover, new models/types of firearms issued to PA personnel from 1999 to present are not included in the list; thus, determination of pecuniary liability of concerned PA personnel who lost their issued firearms could not be established.



	6)	The absence of relevant or updated cost valuation of issued or loaned firearms that includes new models or types may cause delay in the issuance of COA Decisions pertaining to filed requests for relief from property accountability for lost firearms and subsequent settlement of liability pertaining thereto, whenever applicable.



	7)	We recommended that Management: 



a)	make immediate representations with concerned DND office/officials relative to updating of DND Circular No. 34; or



b)	create a Technical Working Group that will primarily update both existing list of firearms and cost valuation authorized in the outdated DND Circular.



	8)	Management commented that the APAO----footnote46---- and ASPA have requested from OG4, PA to make a representation with Higher HQ for the updating of the DND Circular No. 34.



	9)	Management’s comments are duly noted and compliance with the recommendations will be strictly monitored.



Army General Hospital Mess Fund



9)	The utilization of the Army General Hospital (AGH) Mess Fund was inconsistent with existing laws, rules and regulations due to: a) irregular use of income sourced from PhilHealth Trust Receipts (PHTR) as initial funding for the mess support; b) absence of legal basis or authority to open bank account for the purpose; c) lack of check and balance in the disbursement of funds; and d) improper accounting of collections and disbursements.



	1)	HPA Letter Directive No. 04----footnote47---- dated 13 March 2018 sets forth policies, guidelines and procedures in providing timely and sufficient meal/mess support to Army personnel confined in military hospitals, dispensaries and other treatment facilities.



	2)	The directive provides, among others –



5.b For military operations casualties----footnote48----, the Command shall fully support the daily patients’ mess requirements while for non-military operations casualties, the concerned personnel shall shoulder the cost of their respective mess using their Subsistence Allowance or deductible from their pay and allowances in case of dependents.



6.b Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) shall utilize their collections from PhilHealth Trust Receipts (PHTR) for the initial fund requirement of mess patients based on their average monthly bed capacity and will be initially used to pay for the mess requirements of patients falling under non-military casualty category which cannot pay immediately upon admission.



7.h The Accounting Unit of concerned MTFs shall maintain a separate SL to cover receipts of mess collection. They shall also include in their monthly report military personnel who have unsettled accountability and submit the list to FCPA or FSFO for proper disposition.



Irregular use of PHTR



	3)	Section 1, Special Provisions of the GAA 2018 provides:



(ii) income sourced from Philhealth reimbursements from availment of medical services shall be used exclusively for the improvement of facilities, and the replenishment of drugs, medicines and vaccines, including medical and dental supplies used in government health care facilities. (Emphasis ours)



In no case shall said amount be used for the payment of salaries, allowances and other benefits.



	4)	The Revised Policy on Mess of Patients in MTFs issued in March 2018 expressly states that MTFs, in this case AGH, shall utilize their collections from PHTR for the initial fund requirement of mess of patients falling under non-military casualty category.  This practice is contrary to the above provision of the GAA; hence, considered irregular since payment for mess support does not fall within the uses of PhilHealth income as enumerated in paragraph 9.3 above.



Absence of authority to open bank account



	5)	Section 4, General Provisions of the GAA 2018 states:



As a general rule, all fees, charges, assessments, and other receipts of revenues collected by departments, bureaus and offices of the National Government, including Constitutional Offices enjoying fiscal autonomy in the exercise of their mandated functions shall be deposited with the National Treasury as income of the General Fund:



Exceptions are:



a)	Receipts authorized by law to be recorded as a Special Account in the General Fund, Trust Fund or a fund other than the General Fund which shall be established in accordance with rules and regulations as may be issued by the Permanent Committee created under Section 45, Chapter 5, Book VI of EO No. 292. The said special funds may be made available for expenditure, subject to any special provision of the agencies concerned; and xxxx



	6)	In relation thereto, the AGH opened a current account with the Land Bank of the Philippines for Mess Funds bearing account No. 1682-1031-12. It was noted; however, that there was no document to support the opening of the account. The absence of legal basis or authority to open said bank account renders it void ab initio.



Lack of check and balance in the disbursement of funds



	7)	Item 7.b of AGH SOP No. 01 dated 06 November 2018 provides:



AGH SDO for Mess shall request for the release of fund from mess collections to be front-loaded for patients’ mess through a Disbursement Voucher (DV) in the amount of P1,000,000.00. The DV will have the following signatories and attachments:



Signatories:



Payee:		DO, AGH

Box A:		Mess Officer, AGH

Box C:		Chief, MFO, AGH

Box D:		CO, AGH



	8)	We noted in the above provision that the signatories in the DVs include personnel and officers of AGH only. Accordingly, it appears that check and balance were not observed indicating a potential weakness in the HPA’s internal control process.



Improper accounting of collections and disbursements



	9)	The Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 provides:



Section 11. The accounts of an agency shall be kept in such detail as is necessary to meet the needs of the agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or control agencies of the government. The highest standards of honesty, objectivity and consistency shall be observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate or misleading information.



Section 112. Each government agency shall record its financial transactions and operations conformably with generally accepted accounting principles and in accordance with pertinent laws and regulations.



	10)	Review of records disclosed that the ASPA----footnote49---- does not maintain a separate SL for AGH Landbank Current Account No. 1682-1031-12. Collections and fund requirements for mess support are deposited to and disbursed from the said account.----footnote50----



	11)	While AGH monitors transactions in a separate cashbook----footnote51----, absence of accounting records particularly a separate SL precludes the accurate reporting of transactions in the books of accounts; thus, casting doubt on the reliability of HPA’s financial reports.



	12)	The following circumstances were further noted: 



a)	In a letter dated 11 July 2018 to CGPA, the AGH requested for immediate resolution of the mess policy to properly follow the appropriate government accounting rules and regulations as set forth by higher Headquarters (HQ);



b)	The AGH requested through a letter dated 12 November 2018 to Commander, ASCOM, PA, a representation to higher HQ for the issuance of revised policy on mess of patients, amending the provision of “deduction from subsistence allowance” to “deduction from pay and allowances”. The unit also cited that the approved P3.2 million fund from the PHIC Trust Receipts for the mess of patients had already been exhausted;



c)	The provision of mess/meal support from the PHTR funds has been in effect from 2018 to present through HPA Letter Directive No. 04.



	13)	We recommended that Management:



a)	 require concerned official of Army General Hospital (AGH) to submit explanation on the use of Philhealth Trust Receipts (PHTR) to fund the mess requirements of patients falling under non-military casualty category;



b)	direct concerned official of AGH to submit to the Audit Team legal authority in the opening of bank account for Mess Fund;



c)	consider the revision of AGH SOP No. 1 particularly the provisions on signatories to disbursement vouchers; and



d)	 direct the Chief Accountant to maintain subsidiary ledger for Mess Fund to monitor additions to and deductions from the Fund.



	14)	Management provided the following comments:



	--	Based on previous GAAs until FY 2017, a recurring special provision which authorizes use of PHTR or reimbursement of AGH to augment MOOE requirements provided that at least 25 percent of the TR should be utilized to upgrade hospital equipment.  Likewise, AFP Personnel Directive Nr. 1 dated 02 January 2008, and HPA Letter Directive dated 11 September 2012 explicitly authorized the use of portion of PHTR in the procurement of additional foodstuffs to improve nutritional requirements of its patients.  As such, the Command approved and released Allotment Advice Order No. 2018-02-07 dated 30 May 2018 to support the procurement of patient’s mess of AGH for CY 2018 which were funded from PHIC reimbursements from 2017 and earlier years. Sustaining the operational requirements including mess of patients of AGH in 2018 had become so challenging for the management due to sudden spike of admitted battle casualties and other patients from the Marawi City crisis in 2017, and other national emergencies and calamities.  As such, the Command looked-out from all its available resources including the PHIC TR to address the immediate and urgent requirements of its Military Treatment Facilities.



However, when the provision of GAA 2018 came out which limits the use of PHIC TR into particular MOOE related expenses excluding mess of patients, the PA had complied with that provision, and no other AA for the same purpose and fund source were released thereafter.



	--	The PA has reviewed and is currently revising existing policies regarding Mess of Patients in AGH and other hospitals to comply with the recommendation and align the same with the existing laws and regulations.



	--	The Command will direct the AGH to desist from using the LBP Bank Account in question.  In addition, the said bank account shall be closed and the bank balance and related collections shall be remitted to the AGH TRF 1682-1022-99 as part of the hospital income.



Auditor’s Rejoinder



	15)	Management comments are duly noted and compliance with the recommendations will be monitored.



Granting of huge cash advances – 1st ID



10)	Extremely huge amounts of cash advances ranging from P22 million to P89 million were granted to accountable officers by 1st ID, rendering government funds exposed to risk of loss or misappropriation.



	1)	Section 2 of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 on the general principles of cash states that cash should be handled under the general principles of the imprest system wherein all payments must be made by check and only payments in small amounts may be made through the petty cash fund. However, in certain instances when it may be very difficult, impractical or impossible to make payments by check, payments may be made by the DO in the form of cash through his CA.



	2)	DBM Circular Letter (CL) No. 2013-16 dated December 23, 2013, CL No. 2013-16B dated February 25, 2014 and CL No. 2018-14 dated December 28, 2018 were issued by DBM implementing the Expanded Modified Direct Payment Scheme (ExMDPS) and Modified Direct Payment Scheme (MDPS) require NGAs to pay its obligations using the Advice to Debit Account (ADA) to suppliers/creditors/payees in lieu of checks.



	3)	In relation with the said provisions, selected Government Servicing Banks (GSB) offers products like the Cash Cards which is an electronic debit card that utilizes the stored value system like the ATM Card, operates on magnetic stripe technology with PIN-based protocol. 



	4)	Transactions of the 1st ID disclosed that extremely huge amount of cash advances were granted to AOs for payment of Service Allowance and Subsistence Allowance to members of CAFGU at P2,000.00 and P4,350.00 each per month, respectively, for an estimated 11,000 CAFGU members more or less. These CAFGU members are distributed/deployed in areas of Misamis Occidental, Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte, Lanao del Sur, Zamboanga del Norte, Zamboanga Sibugay, Zamboanga City and Basilan. Details of cash advances are as follows:

	5)	The amounts of cash advances granted to AOs as shown in the table above were noted to be huge, an amount in the hands of AOs and render these funds exposed to high risk of loss, misuse or misappropriation. Additionally, it is impractical for cash in huge amounts to be carried and transported by AOs to pay each and every CAFGU members deployed to areas of Misamis Occidental, Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte, Lanao del Sur, Zamboanga del Norte, Zamboanga Sibugay, Zamboanga City and Basilan.



	6)	Moreover, cash advances in five (5) field units totaling P9,081,604.16 granted to officers and employees remained unliquidated as at year-end, details are as follows:



Unit

Unliquidated Cash Advance

3rd ID

P    80,000.00

52nd EBde

1,366,258.82

AD Tradoc

500,550.00

Total

P 9,081,604.16



	7)	Above practice is not in consonance with Section 89 of PD No. 1445 and Sections 5.8 and 5.11 of COA Circular No. 97-002 which provides among others that all cash advances shall be fully liquidated at the end of each year.



	8)	We recommended that Management pay the Service Allowance and Subsistence Allowance of members of Citizen Armed Force Geographical Unit (CAFGU), thru Cash Card system (CCS) or any similar products offered by any Government Servicing Banks or Authorized Government Depository Banks (AGDBs) to protect the interest of the government.



	9)	We also recommended and Management agreed to require the concerned Accountable Officers to immediately liquidate their outstanding cash advances and henceforth, see to it that all cash advances are liquidated at the end of the year. 



	10)	Management expressed its willingness to implement the CCS by phases and that they are currently deciding where and when to conduct its first pilot test considering near-city units where there are available ATM services yielding convenience to the CAFGU members and lessen the risk of exposure of the funds to loss or misappropriation in the hands of AOs. Hence, the processing of documentary requirements is currently underway in coordination with the management of LBP.



Unregistered lots – 5th ID



11)	Recorded four (4) parcels of land in the books of 5th Infantry Division amounting to P270,597,823.10 were not yet registered in the name of the Division; thus, ownership thereof could not be ascertained.

	

	1)	Section 58 of PD 1445 states that, the examination and audit of assets shall be performed with a view to ascertaining their existence, ownership, valuation and encumbrance as well as the propriety of items composing the respective asset accounts, determining their agreement with records; proving the accuracy of such records; ascertaining if the assets were utilized economically, efficiently and effectively; and evaluating the adequacy of controls over the accounts.



	2)			Verification of financial statements as of December 31, 2020 disclosed that the Land account has a balance of P675,162,823.10, composed of the following:

		

	Mode of Acquisition

	Status

	Ownership

	No. of Lots

	P675,162,823.10

	

	3)		As can be gleaned from the above table, four lots acquired through Presidential Proclamations 100 and 319, EO No. 40 and donation totaling P270,597,823.10 remained unregistered under the name of the Division; thus, ownership thereof could not be ascertained.

	

	4)		Despite non-existence of Land Title, the values of the four lots were recorded in the books of accounts of the 5th ID.



	5)		We recommended that Management facilitate the titling of four lots to prove ownership thereof and to avoid further risk of future claims by private individuals. 



	6)		Management committed to monitor and coordinate with DENR and a Private Surveyor for the processing of title and special patent of the four military reservations with different location.







Other observations noted in the Field Units (FUs)



12)	Deficiencies in the completion of projects in the 10th ID and 51st EBde were observed.



	1)	The following deficiencies were observed in the audit conducted in the field units:

	

Unit

Audit Observation

Laws, Rules and /or Regulations Not Observed

10th ID

Delayed/non-completion of the projects



Four projects with total contract costs of P74.06 million remained undelivered and/or unfinished despite expiration of the contract time; thus, depriving intended beneficiaries of the early use/operation of the facilities.

Paragraph 8.1, RA No. 9184

Section 68, Rule XXII, RA No. 9184

51st EBde

The status of 61 on-going construction projects undertaken from CY 2002 to 2015 remains undetermined due to failure of the Brigade to comply with AFP Circular No. 21; thus, resulting in the inclusion of these long-outstanding projects in the CIP----footnote52---- accounts amounting to P342,780,761.80.



Relevant information pertaining to the project such as particulars, implementing unit, and status of progress of work, among others are lacking and/or undetermined in the Construction in Progress Ledger Cards.



Moreover, supporting documents for the said projects have already been lost and cannot be located. Even the bi-monthly project status reports do not provide for any information on the said long-outstanding construction projects.

AFP Circular No. 21



	2)	We recommended that Management:



a)	For 10th ID, impose liquidated damages for the delays incurred in project implementation and closely monitor the completion of the projects; and 



b)	For 51st EBde, require the Accounting Unit to exert extra efforts to locate documents to support the projects listed under Construction in Progress.



	3)	Management provided the following comments:



	--	In 10th ID, Management commented that delay in the implementation of projects was expected because the contractor cannot resume its operation due to strict implementation of restrictions inside the camp. However, the Division is appreciative of the audit observation and ask the guidance from the Audit Team on how to compute liquidated damages that will be charged and deducted from the last and final payment. The Division through the 306th Contracting Office will closely monitor future similar projects so as not to recur similar observations in the future.



	--	In 51st EBde, Management commented that the Brigade directed the line units to search for supporting documents and conduct on-site investigation, inspection, and verification to support the existence of listed Construction in Progress. The Brigade will immediately submit pertinent documents to support completion of the CIPs.



	4)	Management comments are duly noted and compliance with the recommendations will be monitored.



Non-compliance with certain provisions of laws, rules and regulations on financial operations



13)	Certain provisions of laws, rules and regulations on reportorial requirements, funds and property management, and procurement were not faithfully adhered to; thus, indicative of weak compliance monitoring by the agency. 



	1)	Laws, rules and regulations on government financial operations provide controls that ensure, among others, validity of transactions and promote adherence to policies and procedures. The PA however, did not observe certain provisions of laws, rules and regulations, as follows:

	2)	The foregoing non-compliance issues are mostly reiteration of reported in PYs’ audit reports which means that the existing compliance monitoring system of PA has not improved.



	3)	To strengthen control over PA’s financial and accounting operation, we recommended that Management intensify monitoring of compliance to the existing laws, rules and regulation and ensure faithful observance thereof.



Compliance with Other Mandatory Accounts/Areas

Non-compliance with NBC No. 580



Repair works on buildings and structures of the 51st EBde and Civil Military Operations Regiment (CMOR) totaling P7,363,928.00 were pursued and implemented during the effectivity of R.A. No. 11469 or the “Bayanihan To Heal As One Act” contrary to the economy measures required under NBC No. 580.



	3)	On April 22, 2020, the DBM issued NBC No. 580 for the adoption of economy measures due to emergency health situation. Its purpose was to provide for the possible measures for the discontinuance of appropriated programs, activities and projects, whether released or unreleased as well as unobligated allotments of covered entities to fund operations and response measures related to COVID-19 emergency situation, among others. One of the economy measures mentioned was the discontinuance of start-up construction of government buildings, as well as repairs/renovation works which may be deferred.  



	4)	The NBC had been in full force and effect through the duration of R.A. No. 11469 or the “Bayanihan To Heal As One Act” which was from March 25 to June 25, 2020.



	5)	Review of compliance of 51st EBde and CMOR with said economy measure disclosed that various Repairs and Maintenance works on its buildings and structures were pursued and carried out from April to June 2020, summarized as follows:

	6)	Despite issuance of NBC No. 580 requiring all government agencies receiving budgetary appropriations to adopt necessary economy measures, field units opted to pursue and implement repair works programmed for CY 2020 resulting in its non-compliance with Item 4.3.1.2, of NBC No. 580.

 

	7)	We recommended that Management require the Assistant Chief of Staff for Logistics (G4) to provide justification/explanation on the implementation of 25 repair works totaling P7,363,928.00 despite requirement on the discontinuance of repair/renovation works adopted as an economy measure under NBC No. 580.



	8)	In 51st EBde, Management commented that majority of repair works/projects were intended for the improvement of the workplace and billeting of troops. Moreover, in order to comply with safety protocols implemented during the time of pandemic, the Brigade and its line units need to enhance its facilities to protect its troops from the spread of COVID-19 by constructing dividers, extension of barracks/SOQs and additional facilities that will serve as quarantine area. 



	9)	Further, by the time that the NBC was published, some of construction materials were already delivered and some of it have short storage life. Also, the Brigade including its line units have no storage facilities for the safekeeping of construction materials; hence, the need for it to be consumed. Lastly, noteworthy is the fact that no government fund was misused/misspent, funds were used for public purpose and benefited the personnel of the Brigade.



	10)	In CMOR, Management commented that the facilities are in dire need to undergo repair in order to support the capability build-up of the unit due to its various activities in support to the battle of COVID-19 pandemic. Further, the enhancement of the four facilities were undertaken due to the following:



	a)	To serve as an isolation facility for personnel involved in numerous COVID-19 pandemic activities in support of government’s effort in providing communities under ECQ with their basic needs;



	b)	To serve as temporary isolation facility for suspended personnel who were determined to have been exposed to individuals positive for COVID-19 virus. The facility was specifically designed to minimize further contraction of the virus within the Agency premises and avoid increase of COVID-19 cases. Moreover, the facility provided medical health personnel venue to give proper care to suspended personnel without risking their own health as the facility was sanitized frequently;



	c)	Facilities were enhanced in order to ensure to preserve the force and still be able to accomplish the Agency’s mandate in serving people and securing the land despite of the pandemic. This initiative was critical since 80 percent of Agency’s personnel are involved in the ground activity due to the pandemic.



	11)	During Exit Conference, the Regiment Commander commented that there was no guideline issued nor any information disseminated by HPA regarding said NBC and elaborated that all repair works were COVID-related efforts during the ECQ.











Inclusion of warranty clause in contracts



The inclusion of warranty clause in contracts entered into by HPA for the procurement of goods within the period covered by the State of National Emergency is in compliance with Section 3.5 of Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB) Circular No. 01-2020.



	12)	Presidential Proclamation No. 922, s. 2020 was issued declaring a State of Public Health Emergency throughout the Philippines due to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Thus, RA No. 11469 or the “Bayanihan to Heal as One Act” was enacted declaring a state of national emergency over the country to control the spread of the disease.



	13)	In line with this, GPPB Circular No. 01-2020 dated 06 April 2020 was formulated to expedite procurement of highly needed supplies, materials, equipment, utilities, telecommunications, and other critical services authorized under RA No. 11469 at the most advantageous price to the government with the necessary safeguards for the prevention of abuses and corruption in the procurement process. Further, the Circular provides for the inclusion of warranty clause in contracts for the procurement of goods or projects.



	14)	A warranty clause is a provision in a contract that generally provides an assurance to the procuring entity that the goods or projects to be delivered or implemented conform to certain standards. Inclusion of the said clause ensures the strict compliance by the supplier/compliance of his obligations and can serve as basis in imposing liabilities, in case of non-compliance.



	15)	Section 3.5 of GPPB Circular No. 01-2020 provides:



The contract shall include a warranty clause where the supplier, distributor, manufacturer, or contractor warrants that, for the period stipulated covering the procurement at hand, the Goods or Infrastructure Projects to be delivered or implemented shall be free from defects and conform to quality standards and technical specifications of the said contract. The contract awardee shall fulfill all the obligations and undertakings under the contract and the OSS.



	16)	The 12 contracts for the procurement of various supplies and equipment entered into by the HPA and various suppliers during the period of State of National Emergency in 2020 were in compliance with the above provisions.

Property Insurance Law



22)	All government agencies are required to insure its property with the GSIS against any insurable risk therein provided and pay the premiums thereon.----footnote63---- Properties, assets, agreements, rights or causes of action or other insurable interest of the Armed Forces of the Philippines are bound by this to the extent acceptable to the General Insurance Fund (GIF) being administered by the GSIS.----footnote64----



	1)	Based on available records, the PA paid P9,497,184.09 in 2020 for the insurance premium and documentary stamp tax (DST) for its insurable assets.



	2)	In 3rd ID, audit showed that 26 Motor Vehicles assigned to and used by the different brigades and battalion units of the PA were not insured with the GSIS since ownership is not yet transferred in the name of the PA.  This exposes the agency to the risk of not being indemnified in case of loss or damage on said properties.



	3)	The Management commented that the OG4 has already instructed the line units to facilitate the transfer of registration of motor vehicles to government-owned and to insure the same with the General Insurance Fund of the GSIS.
