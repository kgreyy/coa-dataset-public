C. Scope and Objectives of Audit 

 

The audit covered the accounts and operations of the DSWD Central Office and 16 

FOs for CY 2020.  The audit was conducted to: a) verify the level of assurance that maybe 

placed on management’s assertions on the financial statements; (b) recommend agency’s 

improvement opportunities, (c) determine the propriety of transactions as well as the extent 

of compliance with pertinent laws, rules and regulations, and (d) determine the extent of 

implementation of prior year’s audit recommendations. 

 

D. Independent Auditor’s Report 
 

A qualified opinion was rendered on the financial statements of the DSWD as at 

December 31, 2020 for the misstatements to the total Assets and Net Assets/Equity by 

₱1,251,884,797.75 and ₱1,204,675,520.04, respectively, and Liabilities by 

₱715,711,692.71 which represent 0.87 percent, 1.11 percent and 1.99 percent of its total 

Assets, Liabilities and Net Assets/Equity, respectively. 

 

Moreover, we noted deficiencies amounting to ₱5,463,472,788.19 in keeping of the 

accounts affecting fair presentation of the assets and liabilities accounts balances reported 

in the financial statements by ₱5,434,962,122.25 and ₱28,510,665.94, respectively. 

 

E. Significant Observations and Recommendations 
 

Among the audit observations and corresponding recommendations discussed in 

Part II of this report, the significant observations are summarized as follows: 

 



iii 
 

1. Various accounts of the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) 
have misstatements resulting in aggregate errors on the reported total Assets, 

Liabilities and Net Assets/Equity by ₱1,251,884,797.75, ₱715,711,692.71 and 

₱1,204,675,520.04, representing 0.87%, 1.99% and 1.11% thereof, respectively. 

Due to the significant impact of such misstatements on the reported balances of the 

affected accounts, Management’s assertions as to the accuracy, existence, 

completeness, rights and obligations, cut-off and understandability of the said 

accounts could not be relied upon.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require:  

 

a. the concerned Accounting Unit (AU) to draw journal entry vouchers 
(JEVs) to correct all the noted accounting errors and omissions; and 

henceforth, observe the proper recording, adjustments and 

reclassifications of accounts and transactions which should be supported 

with necessary documentations in accordance with the GAM and other 

existing accounting rules and regulations; and 

 

b. the concerned offices/process owners to coordinate and timely submit 
reports to their respective AUs to support the recording of transactions 

and conduct regular reconciliation therefor, in accordance with existing 

accounting rules and regulations. 

 
2. In FO-2, The validity/regularity of the Procurement amounting to ₱26,861,100.00 

for the payment of 1,790,740 Nutripack at ₱15.00 per pack under the SFP could not 

be established due to lack of supporting documents. Moreover, a total of 17,220 

packs amounting to ₱258,300.00 were procured in excess of what was required 

based on the total number of proposed beneficiaries. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to strictly comply with the 

Guidelines, Procedures, Documentary Requirements of RA 9184, or the 

Government Procurement Reform Act, and its Revised IRR to establish 

legality and regularity of any procurement transaction; otherwise, non-

compliance may prompt a suspension or disallowance in audit. 

 

3. In FO-13, the distribution lists (DL) that were attached to 13 payments to suppliers 
totaling ₱7,862,289.44 revealed various questionable signatures due to the laxity of 

procedures in the actual distribution of various food items to the beneficiaries. 

 

We recommended and management agreed that the FO 13 Management: 

 

a. Coordinate with the Local Focal Person assigned in the 
Municipalities/Cities to strictly require the submission of Letter of 

Authority or its equivalents duly signed and acknowledged by the 

beneficiaries in order to substantiate and provide evidence of the actual 

receipt of food items; 



iv 
 

b. Strictly validate/verify the authenticity and legitimacy of the authorized 
representatives based on the documents presented; and 

 

c. Strengthen the whole procedures to be observed during the deliveries of 
food Item. 

 

4. The FO-5 have processed payments of Seed Capital Fund grants for SLP to 79 
identified Civic Society Organizations (CSOs) amounting to ₱24,430,170.94 in 

CYs 2017 and 2018 despite incomplete submission by CSOs of the required 

documents and poor implementation of Skills Training Programs, which resulted 

to staled/cancelled checks and deprived the intended beneficiaries of the benefits  

thereof, hence, defeating the purpose of improving the socio-economic conditions 

of the poor, vulnerable and disadvantaged households.  

 

We recommended and FO-5 Management agreed to exercise prudence in 

processing payments/claims to avoid wastage of government funds; 

henceforth, strictly comply with Section 4(6) of PD No. 1445.  

 

5. In FO-13, Disbursed Enhanced Comprehensive Local Integration Program (E-
CLIP) and Livelihood Settlement Grants (LSG) Assistance amounting to 

₱1,280,000.00 and ₱4,040,000.00, respectively, to 330 former rebels were 

supported with inappropriate and/or with lacking documentation, thereby, casting 

doubt on the propriety and validity of the transactions. 

 

We recommended and FO-13 Management agreed to: 
 

a. Enjoin the CIS Head and SLP RPC to submit the original copies of (i) 
Certification from JAPIC and (ii) Endorsement from E-CLIP Committee 

to attest the eligibility of the beneficiaries; and 

 

b. Henceforth, require the Accountant to “review thoroughly” all 
documentation supporting any claims against government funds to 

establish propriety and validity of transactions.  

 

6. Disbursements amounting to ₱32.511 million were made contrary to pertinent 
provisions of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012, DSWD MC 04 

series of 2020, and DSWD Administrative Order No. 03 series of 2015, on the 

distribution of FNI by FOs 3 and 11 to LGUs affected by COVID-19, casting doubt 

on the regularity of transactions 

 

We recommended and Management of FO 3 and 11 agreed to: 

 

a. Follow up the submission of the RDS from the concerned 
LGUs/offices/groups as proof of actual receipt of food and non-food items; 

and 

 



v 
 

b. require the assigned personnel to diligently monitor, update and check 
compliance with the reportorial requirements and distribution scheme of 

the LGUs for the subsequent completion of FNI transactions 

 

7. Social Amelioration Program from CO, and FOs 6 representing the 1st and/or 2nd 
tranche were paid to identified beneficiaries who were considered not eligible 

pursuant to the DA-DBM-CSC-DILG Joint Memorandum Circular (JMC) No. 2 

series of 2020 and DSWD Memorandum Circular No. 09, Series of 2020 resulting 

in payment to unqualified beneficiaries base on the Audit Team’s sample size 

amounting ₱3.587 million. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to direct the concerned DSWD 

officers to: 

 

a. Investigate/evaluate the list of beneficiaries and their qualification for the 
Social Amelioration Program; 

 

b. Initiate refund to the identified unqualified beneficiaries;  
 

c. assign/hire additional personnel to conduct the validation of beneficiaries in 
cases where there will be additional benefits to be granted; and  

 

d. Adopt measures to strengthen the selection process of beneficiaries in 
accordance with existing laws/rules and regulations.  

 

8. The SAP from CO and FOs 1, 2, 3, 4A, 5, 6, 7 and 13 granted to identified 
beneficiaries for the 1st and/or 2nd tranche also received other Emergency 

Assistance from government agencies other than DSWD in excess of the threshold 

set in Joint Memorandum Circular (JMC) No. 2 series of 2020 and DSWD 

Memorandum Circulars No. 9, 10 and 14 s. of 2020. Consequently, the 

deduplication procedures set by the Management is not sufficient to detect 

duplication resulting in excessive payments based on the Audit Team’s sampling 

of at least ₱112,900,645.00. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to direct CO and FOs’ concerned 

officers to: 

 

a. Conduct a strict and thorough deduplication procedure to establish the 
magnitude of the excess received by the SAP beneficiaries;  

 

b. Create a team who will validate, investigate and resolve the data issues; 
 

c. Demand the refund of the excess Emergency Assistance given to SAP 
beneficiaries that were also recipients from other government agencies, in 

conformity with Joint Memorandum Circular No. 2 series of 2020; 

 



vi 
 

d. submit a status report regularly for monitoring purposes; and  
 

e. disseminate information/ policy campaign to all 4Ps beneficiaries and 
discourage/ strictly prohibit any duplicity in all claims. 

 

9. Poor implementation on the supplemental guideline of the MOA between the 
DSWD and the FSPs resulted in 135 identified SAP beneficiaries who have not 

received the benefits totaling ₱920,000.00 that was tagged as “PAID” in the 

database, thus, casting doubt on the validity of payments made by the FSPs.  
 

We recommended and Management agreed to direct the concerned CO and 

FOs’ officers to: 
 

a. Provide justification, details and supporting documents to corroborate and 
clear the observation on beneficiaries’ declaration that they are unpaid but 

per database they are paid; and 

 

b. Conduct a strict and thorough review of documents/records/ 
representations uploaded in the SAP database, if accurate and in 

accordance with existing guidelines to prevent the observations noted, from 

happening in the future. 

 

10. Incomplete validation of the encoded Social Amelioration Card (SAC) of the 
Emergency Subsidy Program (ESP) beneficiaries by DSWD that resulted in the 

following observations: (1) Ineligible Beneficiaries, (2) Duplicate/Same 

Beneficiaries, (3) Beneficiaries employed/ with monthly income and (4) 

Beneficiaries paid despite defective and inadequacy of supporting documents, 

contrary to the provisions of DSWD Memorandum Circular No. 2020-09 and 

Article VII of DSWD Memorandum Circular No. 04, series of 2020. Furthermore, 

failure to post the complete list of SAP beneficiaries paid through Financial Service 

Provider (FSP) and SDO payout on the Agency’s live monitoring and DSWD 

official website raise the possibility of double payment of the ESP to same 

beneficiaries. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Regional Directors 

to: 

 

a. Assign personnel who will conduct the validation of SAC Forms. Such 
personnel will establish and ensure that all the listed beneficiaries are 

qualified and that there are no duplications in the benefits granted. Then 

submit the result thereof to the Audit Team; 

 

b. Require the accountable officers and/or paymasters to strictly assess the 
completeness of the supporting documents before payment; 

 



vii 
 

c. Cause the submission of lacking documents to determine the validity and 
propriety of the subject payment;  

 

d. Require all the beneficiaries that have been excessively paid to refund the 
amount of the benefit received;  

 

e. Adopt a monitoring system to ensure that the list of all paid SAP 
beneficiaries are properly encoded, uploaded and posted in the DSWD 

Master list; and 

 

f. Create a team who will validate, investigate and resolve the data with 
anomalies and communicate the result to the Operation Center copy furnish 

the respective ICTMS.  

 

11. Failure of Management to: (a) provide access to the database hindered the early 
communication of audit results to Management in relation to COA Circular No. 

2020-010 dated December 2, 2020; and (b) issue supplemental MOA caused 

confusion to LGUs and omission of action as required in the MOA. 
 

We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Regional Director 

instruct the SAP Focal Person and Head of the ICTMS to immediately 

provide the Audit Teams access to the SAP database or provide copy of the 

back- up files for audit purposes. 

 

The above observations and recommendations were discussed with the concerned 

officials of the agency through the Summary of Audit Observations and Recommendations 

(SAOR), transmitted on June 8, 2021, in lieu of exit conference. Management’s views and 

comments were considered in the report, where appropriate. 

 

F. Status of Settlement of Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges 
 

 The non-compliance with laws, rules and regulations resulted in the total 

suspensions and disallowances and charges in the audit of various transactions amounting
