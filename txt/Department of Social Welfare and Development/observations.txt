Part II - OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
Financial Audit 
 
A. Accounting Errors/Omissions 
 
1. Various accounts of the Department of Social Welfare and Development 
(DSWD) have misstatements resulting in aggregate errors on the reported total Assets, 
Liabilities and Net Assets/Equity by ₱1,251,884,797.75, ₱715,711,692.71 and 
₱1,204,675,520.04, representing 0.87%, 1.99% and 1.11% thereof, respectively. Due to 
the significant impact of such misstatements on the reported balances of the affected 
accounts, Management’s assertions as to the accuracy, existence, completeness, rights 
and obligations, cut-off and understandability of the said accounts could not be relied 
upon.  
 
2. Paragraph 15 of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) 1 and 
Section 3, Chapter 19, of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume I, states that 
“Financial statements are a structured representation of the financial position and financial 
performance of an entity. The objectives of general purpose financial statements are to 
provide information about the financial position, financial performance, and cash flows of 
an entity that is useful to a wide range of users in making and evaluating decisions about 
the allocation of resources.” The standards further states that specifically, the objectives of 
general purpose financial reporting in the public sector should be to provide information 
useful for decision making, and to demonstrate the accountability of the entity for the 
resources entrusted to it. 
 
3. Paragraph 27 of the IPSAS provides that the “Financial Statements (FSs) shall 
present fairly the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of an entity. Fair 
presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, 
and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, 
liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in IPSAS. The application of IPSASs, with 
additional disclosures when necessary, is presented to result in FSs that achieve a fair 
presentation.” 

 
4.      When an audited entity presents its FSs, it is implicitly making assertions that certain 
conditions have been fulfilled in the accounts, among others, which are as follows:  

 
Assertion Condition 

Completeness All transactions and events that should be recorded have been recorded 
Accuracy All transactions and events were recorded without error; all information disclosed 

is in the correct amounts, and which reflect their proper values 
Cut-off All transactions and events were recorded within the correct reported period 
Classification All transactions have been recorded in the proper accounts; assets, liabilities and 

equity interests have been recorded in the proper accounts 
Existence All account balances exist for assets, liabilities and equity 
Rights and obligation The entity holds or controls the rights to assets and liabilities are the obligations of 

the entity 



65 
 

Assertion Condition 
Valuation and allocation Assets, liabilities and equity interests have been included in the financial statements 

at appropriate amounts and any resulting valuation or allocation adjustments have 
been appropriately recorded 

Presentation For account balances- assets, liabilities and equity interests are appropriately 
aggregated or disaggregated and clearly described and related disclosures are 
relevant and understandable in the context of the requirements of the applicable 
financial reporting 

Understandability The information included in the financial statements has been appropriately 
presented and is clearly understandable. 

 
5. The responsibility for the fair presentation and reliability of the FSs rests with the 
Management of the reporting entity, particularly the Head of Finance/Accounting Office 
and the head of entity or his authorized representative, as provided in the Philippine 
Application Guidance (PAG) 4 on IPSAS 1 and Section 4, Chapter 19 of the GAM, Volume 
I. 
 
6. Our audit revealed several accounting errors/omissions committed resulting in the 
misstatements in account balances reported in the FSs of the DSWD, as summarized in Table 
1.

8. The foregoing errors and omissions in recording and reporting of financial 
transactions were due to the following:  

 
a. Delayed or non-submission of reports by concerned offices/process owners to 

the Accounting Unit (AU); 
b. Lack of necessary documents to support the adjusting entries; 
c. Lack of regular reconciliation and coordination between the concerned 

offices/process owners and the AU; and 



75 
 

d. Lack of awareness on the policies and guidelines on the recording of 
accounts/transactions provided in the GAM. 
 

9. We recommended and Management agreed to require:  
 
a. the concerned Accounting Unit (AU) to draw journal entry vouchers (JEVs) 

to correct all the noted accounting errors and omissions; and henceforth, 
observe the proper recording, adjustments and reclassifications of accounts 
and transactions which should be supported with necessary documentations 
in accordance with the GAM and other existing accounting rules and 
regulations; and 
 

b. the concerned offices/process owners to coordinate and timely submit 
reports to their respective AUs to support the recording of transactions and 
conduct regular reconciliation therefor, in accordance with existing 
accounting rules and regulations. 

 

Accounting Deficiencies 
 
Unaccounted balances of assets and liabilities 
 
10. The account balance of various Asset and Liability accounts with total value of 
₱5,434,962,122.25 and ₱28,510,665.94, respectively, as at December 31, 2020, remained 
unaccounted due to the continuous non-maintenance of prescribed accounting records, 
unavailability of sufficient documentary requirements, and inability to provide 
details/breakdown and pertinent information thereon as well as continuous failure to 
reconcile prior years’ balances despite the lapse of time, thus, negatively affecting  
Management’s assertions on existence, accuracy, rights and obligations, and 
completeness of reported account balances. 
 
11. The following accounting rules and regulations mandates the faithful presentation in 
the recognition of the agency’s financial transactions: 

  
 Section 27 of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) 1 

provides that “Financial statements shall present fairly the financial position; 
financial performance, and cash flow of an entity. Fair presentation requires the 
faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions 
in accordance with definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, 
revenue, and expenses set out in IPSASs.” 

 
 Section 110 of PD 1445 provides that government accounting shall aim to                   

(1) produce information concerning past operations and present conditions;              
(2) provide a basis for guidance for future operations; (3) provide for control of 
the acts of public bodies and officers I the receipt, disposition and utilization of 
funds and property; and (4) report on the financial position and the results of 
operations of government agencies for the information of all persons concerned. 



76 
 

 Section 111 thereof also provides that (1) the accounts of an agency shall be kept 
in such a detail as is necessary to meet the needs of the agency and at the same 
time be adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or control agencies 
of the government; and (2) the highest standards of honesty, objectivity and 
consistency shall be observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against 
inaccurate or misleading information. 

 
12. However, the correctness of the reported balances of the following DSWD Offices 
cannot be ascertained due to various deficiencies in keeping the accounts, the details of 
which are presented in Table 3.

23. The FO-4A Management commented that they will validate, confirm and check the 
transactions with the concerned SDO and will comply with the Audit Team’s 
recommendations. They also agreed to submit the listed lacking documents. 
 
24. The FO-6 Management likewise commented that: 
 

a. for CY 2021, there is an authority to hire 19 Administrative Assistants II to assist 
the DSWD Social Workers; 

 
b. the Crisis Intervention Section has encoded an additional ₱102,666,382.00 to the 

CrIMS as of February 22, 2021 and came up with a plan on how to fully encode 
the transactions; and 

 
c. the CIS-Head had already sent feedback to the Central Office on the need to 

simplify the CrIMS. 
 
25. The FO-8 Management explained that the employees mentioned were in crisis 
situations at that time, caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. According to them, these clients 
were assessed by the Social Worker of the FO-8 and found qualified to avail of the said 
assistance. 

Deficiencies in the Implementation of Social Pension (SocPen) 
 
26. Delayed implementation and submission of the liquidation documents for FOs- 
NCR, 3 and 8 as well as the restriction imposed in the registry of the beneficiaries in 
FO-3, thus, depriving the timely augmentation to the qualified target senior citizens 
and precluded the prompt audit of the Social Pension for Indigent Senior Citizens 
Program. 
 
27. Republic Act (RA) No. 9994 or the “Expanded Senior Citizens Act of 2010” 
institutionalizes social protection to senior citizens by providing additional government 
assistance through Social Pension for Indigent Senior Citizens (SPISC). In this program, 
indigent senior citizens as beneficiaries are entitled to a monthly stipend of five hundred 
pesos (₱500.00) to augment their daily subsistence and other medical needs. 
 
28. RA 9994 defines an Indigent Senior Citizen as any elderly, who is frail, sickly, or 
with disability, and without pension or permanent source of income, compensation or 
financial assistance from his/her relatives to support his/her basic needs. 
 



88 
 

29. Further, DSWD Memorandum Circular No. 04, series of 2019 provides that the 
beneficiary shall receive the stipend on a semestral basis, using the most cost-effective and 
efficient payment modality such as, but not limited to, direct payment to the beneficiary 
through cash advance by a designated SDO, door-to-door delivery scheme, or use of a cash 
card. 
 
30. The following were the results of our validation of the implementation of the SocPen

Total Amount  2,402.731     

 
31. Emphasis is given in the review of the program in FO 8 which disclosed that the SPP 
has a total allotment of ₱1,683,840,600.00. Out of this allocation, the amount of 
₱1,683,498,600.00 was obligated during the year, representing 99.98% of the allotment.   
 
32. However, the reported accomplishment, which Management already considered as 
substantial compliance with the implementation of the planned activities, was very minimal, 
as discussed below:   
 

a. A total of 54 centenarians were provided with cash gifts during the year. The 
accomplishment was higher than the target of 30 centenarians, with a total 
disbursements of ₱5,400,000.00; 
 

b. Only 41,544 beneficiaries out of the 276,807 targeted senior citizens have 
received their stipend for CY 2020. This accomplishment only represents 
15.01% of the target, which cannot be concluded as substantial compliance to 
the implementation of the program. Clearly, an accomplishment below 
50.00% cannot be treated as a success indicator.  Actual disbursement for the 
pay out to the senior citizens only amounted to ₱249,264,000.00 computed at 
₱6,000.00 per year for 41,544 recipients. The rest of the unpaid senior citizens 
were part of the total unpaid obligations recorded as accounts payable. 

 
33. Management commented that the major negative variance of 235,263 was due to the 
following reasons: 
 

a. Limited bonded officials in the Field Office; 
b. Temporary suspension of the Transfer of Funds to local government units as 

per memorandum from the Secretary dated September 2018; 
c. Special Disbursing Officers with cash advances covering multiple localities 

and with huge amount took time in disbursing the amount as well as in 
liquidating the cash advance due to other deliverables which are part of the 
core functions of the staff; 

d. With the COVID-19 pandemic effects of suspended transportations, declared 
lockdown by LGUs, strict border pass despite being APOR and no mass 
gathering; pay-outs were either rescheduled or cancelled; and 



92 
 

e. Weather disturbances during the onset of pay-out in the last quarter affected 
the scheduled pay-out especially in island municipalities and in both 
Geographically Isolated and Disadvantaged Areas (GIDA) as well as non-
GIDA. 

34. The Focal Person of the SocPen in FO 8 explained that modality for the distribution 
of benefits was through cash pay-out from the cash advances of the SDO because the 
transfers of funds to LGUs were suspended by the Secretary of the Department on 
September 18, 2018 due to non-settlement of their unliquidated advances.  
 
35. However, the DSWD Secretary wrote a letter dated March 30, 2020 to the COA 
Chairperson to allow the transfer of funds to LGUs, including those with pending obligations 
of liquidating their remaining unliquidated fund transfer. The letter was received and 
approved by the COA Chairperson on March 31, 2020. 
 
36. The Audit Team has different view with the reasons in paragraph 28 items (a) to (c) 
because DSWD MC No. 04 series of 2019 requires the release of stipend to senior citizens 
beneficiaries every six (6) months.  There are still 45,237 unpaid beneficiaries in CY 2019 
as of CY 2020 which is already more than one year. Also, the unpaid beneficiaries in CY 
2020 could have been paid had the agency strictly followed the guidelines thus, low level of 
accomplishments in the implementation of the program deprived the targeted beneficiaries 
of the benefits it intends to serve to the defeat of the objectives for which funds were 
allocated. Also, the high disparity between the accomplishment level and incurred 
expenditures gives hint of unnecessary uses of funds that may not be consonant to the 
purposes for which the program was conceived. 
 
37. The audit also has different view with the explanation of the Focal Person in 
paragraph 29 because, the modality in the cash pay-out could have been implemented 
through transfer of funds as requested by the DSWD Secretary for the speedy distribution 
of the Social Pension. 

Deficiencies in the Implementation of Supplementary Feeding Program (SFP) 
 
38. Lapses in the implementation of the Supplementary Feeding Program (SFP) 
cast doubt on the reliability of the transactions as well as the distribution of the food 
items to the identified beneficiaries. 
 
39. The SFP is the provision of food to currently enrolled day care center children as 
part of the DSWD’s contribution to the Early Childhood Care and Development (ECCD) 
Program of the government. The food supplementation is in the form of hot meals served 
during snack/mealtime to children for a minimum of five (5) days and a maximum of seven 
(7) days a week, for 120 days. The feeding program is managed by parents/caregivers based 
on a prepared cycle menu using available indigenous food supplies. Children-beneficiaries 
are weighed at the start of the feeding and monthly thereafter until completion of 120 days 
to determine the improvement and sustenance in their nutritional status. 
 



93 
 

40. SFP aims to: (1) provide augmentation support for feeding program for children 
using indigenous foods and/or locally produced foods equivalent to 1/3 of the 
Recommended Energy and Nutrient Intake (RENI); (2) improve the knowledge, attitude and 
practices of children, parents and caregivers through intensified nutrition and health 
education; and (3) improve and sustain the nutritional status of the target children 
beneficiaries. 
 
41. MC No. 12 series of 2020 states that the “rationale of the SFP is the provision of 
food in addition to the regular meals to target children ages 3-4 years old enrolled in Child 
Development Centers (CDC) and 2-4 years old children in Supervised Neighborhood Play 
(SNP). The program is part of the Department’s contribution to the ECCD and was 
strengthened by the enactment of RA 11037 or the “Masustansyang Pagkain Para sa 
Batang Pilipino Act”, signed on June 20, 2018. The DSWD, together with the Department 
of Education (DepEd), are the lead agencies in the implementation of the said law.” 
 
42. One of the objectives of the program is to address under-nutrition among Filipino 
children on which the attainment of this objective will ultimately help the child to grow and 
develop his/her physical and mental abilities. 
 
Review, analysis and assessment of the implementation of the SFP are as follows: 
 
43. In FO-2, cash advances granted for the implementation of the 9th cycle feeding 
program were excessive due to the unreleased amount of ₱1,334,532.36 after the 
completion of the said cycle, thus, exposing government funds to risks of loss and/or 
misappropriation. 
 
44. Section 5 (7) of COA Cicular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 states that, “When 
a cash advance is no longer needed or has not been used for a period of two (2) months, it 
must be returned to or refunded immediately to the collecting officer.” 
 
45. Further, Section 65 (1) of PD 1445 states that, “Unless otherwise specifically 
provided by law, all income accruing to the agencies by virtue of the provisions of law, 
orders and regulations shall be deposited in the National Treasury or in any duly authorized 
government depository, and shall accrue to the Unappropriated Surplus of the General 
Fund of the Government.” 
 
46. In the implementation of the 9th Cycle Feeding Program under the SFP, the cash 
needed in the purchase of highly perishable goods were drawn in the form of cash advance 
by the SDOs in the SFP Section.  These SDOs in turn release these funds to all the Child 
Development Workers (CDWs) in the region depending on the number of pupils enrolled in 
day care centers. These CDWs directly conduct the procurement of highly perishable goods 
to be used in the feeding program such as eggs, pork, beef, chicken, fruits, vegetables and 
others, which shall be pack ration to the day care pupils because there is no face-to-face 
classes in all levels due to the pandemic. 
 



94 
 

47. Records showed that the total cash advances granted to SDOs amounted to 
₱71,559,099.84, of which ₱70,224,567.48 was released based on the actual needs of the 
CDWs and based on the actual day care pupils actually enrolled during the school year, 
thereby leaving an excess cash advance of ₱1,334,532.36. This was due to the decreased 
number of pupils participated during the actual implementation of the feeding program. 
Verification of the said event disclosed that some participants already moved out or 
transferred from their place of residence and some participants discontinued due to the effect 
of the pandemic. 
 
48.  It was also gathered that the SDOs returned/refunded the amount of ₱227,681.00 to 
the Cashier while the amount of ₱603,060.00 was again released to LGU Alcala and the 
amount of ₱503,791.36 remained unreturned/unrefunded by the SDO.   
 
49. We recommended and Management agreed to require: 

 
a.  The SDOs to return or refund immediately the balance of undisbursed cash 

advance amounting to ₱503,251.36; and  
 

b. The Cashier to remit the same to the BTr and furnish the Auditor a copy of 
the Official Receipt, in compliance with Section 5 (7) of COA Circular No. 
97-002 dated February 10, 1997 and Section 65 of PD 1445. 

 
50. In FO-2, the SDO released the amount of ₱603,060.00 to LGU Alcala, in three 
(3) tranches for the implementation of the Supervised Neighborhood Play (SNP) under 
the 9th Cycle Feeding Program, instead of returning/refunding the said amount, thus, 
resulting in unauthorized disbursement.  
 
51. DSWD AO No. 231, series of 2002, as amended by DSWD AO No. 031, series of 
2004, or the Guidelines in the Implementation of SNP, defined SNP “as a neighborhood 
community-based early childhood care program for children six years old and below under 
the care of child development worker, children whose parents served as participants of 
Parent Effectiveness Service and those that are not accommodated by the center-based 
programs due to space limitations and eligibility requirements. The target areas for SNP 
implementation shall be those areas where there are no established day care and child 
minding centers.” 
 
52. Audit disclosed that the cash advance granted for LGU Alcala of ₱603,060.00 was 
more than what was needed. The SDO, instead of returning/refunding the unutilized amount, 
released the same to CDWs for the implementation of SNP as per DSWD AO No. 031, 
series of 2004.  
 
53. The SDO committed an error in releasing the funds for SNP because the guidelines 
specifically provides that “the target areas for SNP implementation shall be those areas 
where there are no established day care and child minding centers.”  In the case of LGU 
Alcala, there were established day care centers in almost all the barangays.   
 



95 
 

54. Moreover, review of the documents disclosed that 84 out of the 459 recipients of 
SNP were also among those included in the feeding program of children enrolled in CDCs 
under the same 9th cycle, hence, the unnecessary expenditure of ₱151,200.00 representing 
cost of meals of the recipients who benefited twice during the said cycle.   
 
55. In conclusion, it was unnecessary for the SDO to release the said amount for the 
provision of meals for the 84 SNP beneficiaries who were also beneficiaries of the CDC.   
Had the SDO released the said amount in accordance with rules and regulations governing 
the authorized utilization of SNP funds, the amount of ₱603,060.00 could have been used 
for SNP in areas where there are no established day care centers as provided by the 
aforementioned regulations.  
 
56. The SDO explained that the basis in the release of funds was the Masterlist of 
Beneficiaries for Supervised Neighborhood Feeding Program submitted by the CDWs.  It 
appeared that the SFP focal person  failed to review the master lists submitted by the CDWs 
because they failed to detect that the 84 beneficiaries of the SNPs were also beneficiaries of 
the CDCs.   
 
57. Furthermore, the submitted weight and height for age status of the 84 beneficiaries 
were tagged as normal based on the monitoring status of the CDWs, thus, they were not 
qualified for twice a day feeding under DSWD AO No. 03 and 07, series of 2017.  As a 
result, the amount of ₱151,200.00 was incurred which could have been used for the benefit 
of other malnourished children. 
 
58. We recommended and FO-2 Management agreed to: 

 
a. grant cash advances to the SDOs for SFP at an amount that is equivalent to 

the number of beneficiaries in an LGU to prevent excessive cash advances;   
 

b. require the SDO to immediately return in full the excess amount of cash 
advance in case the actual number of beneficiaries, during a particular 
cycle, is less than the cash advance drawn; and  

 
c. require the Head of the SFP to maintain a data base of eligible beneficiaries 

of the program submitted by the CDWs, to prevent incurrence of double 
expenditure and to benefit other qualified children who were excluded in 
the implementation of the program due to budget restrictions.   

 
59. In FO-2, the validity/regularity of the procurement amounting to 
₱26,861,100.00 for the payment of 1,790,740 Nutripacks at ₱15.00 per pack under the 
SFP could not be established due to the lack of supporting documents. Moreover, a 
total of 17,220 packs amounting to ₱258,300.00 were procured in excess of what was 
required based on the total number of proposed beneficiaries. 
 
60. Section 4(6) of PD 1445 states that, “Claims against government funds or property 
shall be supported with complete documentation.”  



96 
 

61. COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012 defines “Irregular” 
Expenditures as an expenditure incurred without adhering to established rules, regulations, 
procedural guidelines, policies, principles or practices that have gained recognition in laws. 
  
62. Sections 50 and 54.5, Rule XVI, and Sections IV (L), V(A.1) and Appendix A, 
Annex “H” of the 2016 Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA 9184, or 
the Government Procurement Reform Act, provides the guidelines, procedures and 
documentary requirements in Direct Contracting. 
 
63. Review and evaluation of the disbursement amounting to ₱26,861,100.00 for the 
payment of 1,790,740 Nutripacks at ₱15.00 per pack under the SFP disclosed that the 
supporting documents attached to the DV were insufficient to satisfy the payment made to 
the supplier. The said transaction was procured under the Alternative Method of 
Procurement through Direct Contracting where it was supported only with the following 
documents: 
 

a. Purchase Order (PO) showing the item procured as “Nutripack” without any 
description of its package components, quantity, unit cost and total amount, and 
signed by the Assistant Regional Director for Operations, with the Conforme 
signed by a certain person under the name Paul Hipolito; 

 
b. Certificate of Sole Distributorship issued by the supplier, Philippine Nutri-foods 

Corporation, which was signed by its Executive Director; and 
 
c. BAC Resolution No. 2020-10-0061 recommending and adopting the Alternative 

Method of Procurement through Direct Contracting. 
 
64. As a result, the validity of the contract cannot be established due to lack of document 
proving the authority of the person signing the Conforme portion of the PO to enter into 
contract in behalf of the supplier.  
 
65. Moreover, the detailed components of the package of the product “Nutripak” were 
not specifically disclosed in the PO, thus, we could not validate if the items delivered were 
the items ordered and contracted considering that the Certificate of Sole Distributorship 
issued by the supplier indicated their food products, to wit: 

 
a. Nutri-Pak (Champorado, beef and chicken flavors); 
b. Nutri-Super Nutri-Pasta/Noodles (spaghetti, beef and chicken flavors); 
c. Nutri-Milk (fortified milk in chocolate and vanilla flavors) 
d. Nutribun (plain, ube, and chocolate flavors) 
e. Nutri-oats Cereal Mix (chocolate and sweet corn flavors) 
f. Enov Lipid Nutrient Supplement (LNS) available in two variants; 
g. Enov Nutributter –single serve 20 gm. Sachets for infants and young children; 
h. Enov Moms – single serve 20 gm. Sachets for pregnant and lactating mothers; 
i. NF-MNP-Micronutrient powder with 15 vitamins and minerals in 1 gm. Sachets;

j. Vitameena MNP-Micronutrient powder with 22 vitamins and mineral in 1.2 gm. 
Sachets; and 

k. Vitameena Kids MNP – Micronutrient powder with 21 vitamins and minerals for 
older children. 

 
66. Further verification disclosed that the nutri-foods delivered were “Nutri-foods 
Fortified Rice Porridge/Macaroni Soup/Pasta –Beef flavor,” which was not among the food 
products listed and as certified by the supplier in the Certificate of Sole Distributorship. 
Likewise, except for the penalty in case of delay, the PO does not contain any terms, 
conditions or guidance in the delivery of the contract especially that it involved voluminous 
quantity to be delivered to different areas in the region. 
 
67. Moreover, the Nutrition Center of the Philippines (NCP) should be the certifying 
authority for its subsidiary companies, not the supplier itself, to establish legitimacy that the 
supplier is certainly the Sole Distributor of the said product. The NCP is a non-profit 
organization that plays a critical role in developing and implementing policy-shaping 
nutrition interventions through their core partners in the community, and works with both 
government and non-government sectors to help address malnutrition in the Philippines.  
 
68. With regard to the Procurement process and documentary requirements, we noted 
that the following critical areas were not conducted to satisfy the adoption of Direct 
Contracting method of procurement: 

 
a. There was no attached price quotation or filled-out Request for quotation (RFQ) 

or a pro-forma invoice together with the terms and conditions of sale of the 
identified direct supplier to identify what was the initial offer of the supplier. 
Thus, simplified negotiations on the price, terms and conditions of the contract 
may not be conducted by the BAC to ensure that the supplier is technically, 
legally and financially capable to deliver the goods at the most advantageous 
price for the Government; 

 
b. Prior to the procurement process, to justify the need to procure through Direct 

Contracting Method, the End-User should conduct a survey of the industry and 
determine the supply source. Moreover, the End-User must justify the necessity 
for an item that may only be procured through Direct Contracting, and it must be 
able to prove that there is no suitable substitute in the market that can be obtained 
at more advantageous terms. 

 
c. The Notice of Award was not issued to the supplier prior to the preparation of 

the contract/PO; 
 
d. The procurement was not supported with Warranty Security (WS) that serves as 

a protectional tool to provide assurance to the agency against defective products 
that fail to perform satisfactorily over the warranty period; 

 



98 
 

e. The BAC did not require the submission of Mayor’s/Business Permit, PhilGEPS 
Registration Number, and Income/Business Tax Return to establish the 
authenticity of the supplier; and  

 
f. Verification further disclosed that this procurement was not posted in the 

PhilGEPS website, for information, transparency and accountability purposes 
despite the provision of the Procurement Reform Act. 

 
69. On the other hand, we also noted that the total quantity procured was more than the 
number of required quantity per the target children, as shown below: 

 
Table 7. Schedule of excess procurement 

Particulars Amount 

Number of target Children 88,676 

Quantity or packs per child 20 

Total packs 1,773,520 

Purchase Order -1,790,740 

Excess packs -17,220 

Price per pack 15 

Excess amount 258,300.00 

 
70. We recommended and Management agreed to strictly comply with the 
Guidelines, Procedures, Documentary Requirements of RA 9184, or the Government 
Procurement Reform Act, and its Revised IRR to establish legality and regularity of 
any procurement transaction; otherwise, non-compliance may prompt a suspension or 
disallowance in audit. 
 
71. In FO-13, the distribution lists (DL) that were attached to 13 payments to 
suppliers totaling ₱7,862,289.44 revealed various questionable signatures due to the 
laxity of procedures in the actual distribution of various food items to the beneficiaries.  
 
72. One of the objectives of the program is to address undernutrition among Filipino 
children of which the attainment of this objective will ultimately help the child to grow and 
develop his/her physical and mental abilities. 
 
73. For CY 2020, the review and post-audit of the 13 SFP payments to creditors showed 
common deficiencies such as various questionable signatures found in the DL, summarized 
as follows: 

 
a. 49 beneficiaries signed “FOR” signatures in the DL in behalf of other 

beneficiaries without any letter of authority or its equivalent; 
 
b. 21 beneficiaries have no apparent signature found in the DL; 
 
c. one (1)  beneficiary appeared to have different signatures in two (2) or more 

deliveries; and 
 
d. 22 different beneficiaries appeared to have the same signatures. 



99 
 

74. Management recognized the lapses committed in the affixing of signatures of the 
recipients in the DL during the actual deliveries of the Food Items. However, they reasoned 
that the deliveries of the food allocations especially on the 21st to 24th deliveries occurred 
during the Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) imposed for the whole country in the 
early part of CY 2020. The strict health protocols, the no back-ride policy, and the limitation 
of movement being imposed nationwide hampered the smooth delivery of the said food 
items to the community and eventually to the actual beneficiaries.  
 
75. Validation disclosed that only two (2) payments of suppliers for the 21st to 24th 
deliveries really occurred on the onset of the declaration of the ECQ, while all others were 
presumably done before the declaration of ECQ and the lapses could have been avoided if 
the right procedures were strictly followed during the deliveries.  
 
76. Only the payment to EJ & JY Wet Market dated April 4, 2020 in the amount of 
₱836,947.80 for the 21st to 24th delivery for the Lot 4, Prosperidad, Agusan del Sur, had 
lapses of 15 same signatures in the DL, which really occurred during the ECQ. These lapses 
implied that the true intention was to sign on behalf of absent beneficiaries but they 
unintentionally forgot to affix the word FOR before their signatures to signify their capacity. 
The same with the other lapses, such as the one (1) beneficiary having different signatures 
in two (2) or more deliveries, and the 22 beneficiaries that have the same signatures. 
 
77. In all of the foregoing circumstances, no documentary evidence was presented in 
support of the “FOR” signatures in the DL to substantiate their claim that they were really 
authorized by the absent beneficiaries to claim for them. As a result, the existence and 
validity of the deliveries to the intended beneficiaries could not be reasonably relied upon. 
 
78. More so, the online interview conducted with some beneficiaries in the last quarter 
of CY 2020 disclosed other significant lapses, such as the master lists of SFP beneficiaries 
in the DCC for CY 2020-2021 which contained the names of beneficiaries enrolled in CY 
2012 and unqualified beneficiaries received food items once. 
 
79. Furthermore, during the actual distribution of the Food Items, the Local Focal Person 
also signed various deliveries or let the nearby barangay daycare worker(s) to accept and 
sign the deliveries in behalf of the absent daycare worker. Considering all the justifications 
given for the said lapses, proper documentation and monitoring should be made for 
accountability to ensure that the food items had been delivered to the rightly intended 
beneficiaries.  
 
80. In doing so, it is necessary that documentary evidence must be shown to provide 
proof that the intended beneficiaries actually received the food items. A Letter of Authority 
or its equivalent is sufficient as a support to the DLs to show proof that the deliveries of 
food items were received by the intended beneficiaries. The authorized representatives of 
the absent beneficiaries must show the said document or its equivalent, together with their 
valid IDs, and must be subjected to scrutiny and validation in order to prove the authenticity 
and legitimacy of their representations. 
 



100 
 

81. Lastly, the agency neglected to address in their comment the issue on the 21 
beneficiaries who did not apparently sign in the DL. Thus, the issue is not yet settled. 
 
82. Based on the foregoing circumstances, the laxity of procedures in the actual 
distribution of various food items to the SFP beneficiaries resulted in various questionable 
signatures found in the DL that cast doubt on the existence and validity of the distribution. 
 
83. We recommended and FO-13 Management agreed to: 

 
a. coordinate with the Local Focal Person assigned in the Municipalities/Cities 

to strictly require the submission of Letters of Authority or its equivalent 
duly signed and acknowledged by the beneficiaries in order to substantiate 
and provide evidence of the actual receipt of food items; 
 

b. strictly validate/verify the authenticity and legitimacy of the authorized 
representatives based on the documents presented; and 
 

c. strengthen the whole procedures to be observed during the deliveries of food 
Item. 

 
Lapses in the construction of sub-projects of KALAHI-CIDSS 
 
84. In FO-6, the Kalahi-CIDSS NCDDP funded projects in Barangays Fundacion, 
Dueñas, Iloilo and Botbot, Pandan, Antique amounting to ₱625,000.00 and 
₱846,432.52 respectively, were affected by various programs of other government 
agencies, thus, the maximum utilization of the sub-project was not fully attained, 
resulting in the wastage of government funds. 
 
85. The Kapit-Bisig Laban sa Kahirapan - Comprehensive and Integrated Delivery of 
Social Services (KALAHI-CIDSS), is one of the poverty alleviation programs of the 
Philippine Government being implemented by the DSWD. It uses the community-driven 
development (CDD) approach, and it is implemented through the Community 
Empowerment Activity Cycle (CEAC), or a series of activities where local communities 
collectively work to analyze local conditions and identify community problems related to 
poverty, develop solutions, implement sub-projects and manage resources.

a. Inability to consider the development plans of other Agencies in the construction 
of sub-projects 

 

86. Management commented that the KC-Regional Program Management Office 
(RPMO) is coordinating with the LGU to assist the community to ensure that the affected 
sub-project is properly documented. Further, technical assistance will be provided to the 
LGU and the community on this matter. 
 

87. In addition, to ensure that the future community-identified sub-projects will not 
experience the same concern like that of Fundacion, Dueñas, Iloilo, Management will 
strengthen the safeguard of the project by requiring certifications from other agencies 
implementing the same projects that there is no funded, proposed and pipe-lined projects of 
the same nature and location identified by the communities. The DSWD FO-6 will 
strengthen its partnership with different agencies to ensure that issues like this will no longer 
happen in the future. 
 

b. KC Health Station project not aligned with the DOH standards  
 

88. On November 12, 2020, the Municipal Vice Mayor of Pandan, Antique wrote a letter 
addressed to the Regional Director of the DSWD, FO-6 informing that Barangay Botbot is 
one of the recipients of the priority projects of the DOH, that is, “Improvement, Renovation 
& Rehabilitation of Barangay Health Station.” In line with the said project, they requested 
approval for the modification of the completed KC-NCDDP sub-project since its design was 
not aligned with the DOH standardized specifications for a Barangay Health Station 
structure. 
 

89. The partial demolition of the KC-NCDDP sub-project was necessary to pave way to 
the DOH funded project, however, it resulted in the wastage of government funds since its 
maximum utilization was not fully attained. 
 

90. Management commented that KC-RPMO will coordinate with the National Project 
Management Office (NPMO) to revisit the design of the Health Station projects. The Health 



102 
 

Station design was provided by the DOH when the program started in CY 2003 and it was 
not changed up to the present. The RPMO will ensure that the future sub-project proposals 
for Health Stations will be coordinated with the Regional and Provincial DOH Offices to 
avoid duplication of projects. 
 

91. We recommended and FO-6 Management agreed to: 
 

a. require the RPMO and the Barangays affected to document properly the 
KC sub-project affected by the DA-FMR and DOH-funded projects to 
provide a paper trail for monitoring purposes;  

 
b. ensure that the future community-identified priority projects are not the 

potential sites of other agencies’ projects to avoid the demolition of the 
completed and functional KC sub-projects; and 

 
c. require the RPMO to recommend to the NPMO of KC to revisit the design 

of the KC Barangay Health Station sub-projects to ensure that future sub-
projects conform with the DOH standards to avoid demolition/modification 
of the completed sub-projects. 

 
Lapses in the Implementation of Sustainable Livelihood Program (SLP) 
 
92. The FO-5 processed payments of Seed Capital Fund grants for SLP to 79 
identified Civic Society Organizations (CSOs) amounting to ₱24,430,170.94 in CYs 
2017 and 2018 despite incomplete submission by CSOs of the required documents and 
poor implementation of Skills Training Programs, which resulted in staled/cancelled 
checks and deprived the intended beneficiaries of the benefits thereof, hence, defeating 
the purpose of improving the socio-economic conditions of the poor, vulnerable and 
disadvantaged households.  
 
93. The Sustainable Livelihood Program (SLP), one of the core programs of the DSWD, 
is a community-based capacity building program that seeks to improve the program 
participants’ socio-economic status. Its main objectives are to improve the socio-economic 
capacity of the poor, to enhance access to basic social services and to improve their standard 
of living. There are two modalities of assistance for the SLP program, namely: (a) Micro-
enterprise Development (MD) Track; and (b) Employment Facilitation (EF) Track.   
  
94. MD Track is an SLP track which focuses on the establishment of micro-enterprise 
through provision of a one-time financial capital, enhancement of skills, and 
building/rebuilding and developing physical and natural assets such as Seed Capital Fund 
(SCF), Skills Training Fund (STF) and Cash for Building Livelihood Assets (CBLA). SCF 
is a start-up capital used to purchase small tools, raw materials, and common service 
facilities such as machinery, equipment and plant needed in starting or expanding a micro-
enterprise. STF is a grant used for the acquisition of knowledge and skills needed in the 
management of the micro-enterprise to be managed by the Sustainable Livelihood Program 
Association (SLPA) or its members; while CBLA is an allowance or stipend provided to 



103 
 

program participants who have rendered work for labor-intensive projects to build, re-build, 
and/or protect natural and physical assets necessary for more profitable, self-sustaining and 
resilient micro-enterprise.  
  
95. EF Track is an SLP track that provides one-time assistance through the provision of 
Employment Assistance Fund and Skills Training Fund.   
 
96. Verification and validation of the implementation of the SLP disclosed the following 
deficiencies: 

 
a. Incomplete submission by CSOs of the required documents - ₱24,430,170.94 

 
97. Section 4, PD 1445 states the fundamental principles of financial transactions and 
operations, which provide in part:  
  

 (4) Fiscal Responsibility shall, to the greatest extent, be shared by all those 
exercising authority over the financial affairs, transactions and operation of the 
government agency.  
  
 (6) Claims against government funds shall be supported with complete 
documentation.  

   
98. Section 28, Chapter 4, Book VI of EO 292 on the Reversion of Unexpended Balances 
of Appropriations, Continuing Appropriation requires that “unexpended balances of 
appropriations authorized in the GAA shall revert to the unappropriated surplus of the 
General Fund at the end of the fiscal year and shall not thereafter be available for 
expenditure except by subsequent legislative enactment. Xxx.” 
  
99. Section 3.4.5 of Budget Circular (BC) No. 578 states that “all agencies are reminded 
that the validity of MDS checks has been shortened from six (6) months to three (3) months 
from date of issue, pursuant to Treasury Circular No. 03-2017 dated October 20, 2017.” 
  
100. Our audit of issued replacement checks for CY 2020 disclosed 79 checks were 
previously issued for SLP SCF amounting to ₱24,430,170.94. This comprises SCF granted 
to several CSOs/SLPA for Catanduanes amounting to ₱19,316,425.94 and SCF granted to 
SLPAs of Camarines Sur, Camarines Norte and Sorsogon amounting to ₱5,113,745.00. 
Corresponding checks were previously issued in CYs 2018 and 2019.  
  
101. Verification of documents supporting the justification for the requests for 
replacement of checks within CY 2020 disclosed the following reasons:  
  

a. For grant of SCFs for SLPAs in Catanduanes - was due to incomplete 
submission of documents required for issuance of SCF and delayed 
implementation of skills training supposedly to be conducted by Bicol 
University (BU).  

  



104 
 

b. For grant of SCFs for SLPAs in Camarines Sur, Camarines Norte and Sorsogon 
- was due to delayed submission of required documents.  

  
102. Our inquiry with the concerned personnel from SLP revealed that they processed 
payments of said grants, particularly those projects with corresponding skills training to be 
conducted by BU, in anticipation that after the conduct of trainings they will immediately 
release the SCFs to the SLPAs for them to be able to immediately start the projects. 
Unfortunately, conduct of said trainings were not immediately implemented. Transactions 
were also processed without the required supporting documents, hence, resulting in 
staled/cancelled checks.  
  
103. The practice of processing payments without complete documentation is not in 
accord with Section 4 (6) of PD 1445. Likewise, Box A of the DV requires the certification 
of the Accountant that supporting documents are complete and the amount claimed is proper. 
Further, it appeared that payments were processed in order to avoid lapsing of funds and 
cash allocations for CYs 2017 and 2018. This practice deprived the government of the funds 
that could have been utilized for other priority programs and projects. The government also 
incurred additional cost for the cancelled checks which could have been avoided had they 
been more prudent in processing transactions.   
  
104. We recommended and FO-5 Management agreed to exercise prudence in 
processing payments/claims to avoid wastage of government funds; henceforth, strictly 
comply with Section 4(6) of PD No. 1445.  

 
b. Poor implementation of the Skills Training Program under the SLP  

 
105. COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994, enumerates the Rules and 
Regulations in the Grant, Utilization, and Liquidation of Funds Transferred to Implementing 
Agencies (IAs). Relevant sections of the said Circular are restated below:  
  
106. “Section 4.3 - The fund to be transferred or sub-allotted to the IA shall be (a) in an 
amount sufficient for three months’ operation subject to replenishment upon submission of 
the reports of disbursements by the IA, or (b) the total project cost, as may be determined 
by the Heads of the two agencies in either case.” 
  
107. “Section 4.6 - Within ten (10) days after the end of each month/end of the agreed 
period for the Project, the Implementing Agency shall submit the Report of Checks Issued 
(RCI) and the Report of Disbursement (RD) to report the utilization of the funds.” 
 
108.  In November 2017, the Agency tapped the services of the Bicol University (BU) as 
the IA and entered into a contract to provide technical education and skills training to the 
Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program beneficiaries in order to develop and empower them 
through livelihood opportunities. The skills training is one of the assistance provided under 
the SLP. As indicated in the approved proposal, the BU will provide skills training including 
the starting/training kits to SLP beneficiaries under the MD Track and EF Track with some 
projects includes provision of Employment Assistance Fund (EAF).  



105 
 

109. Initially, the amount transferred to the IA was ₱280,102,173.35, then in February 
2018 additional fund was transferred amounting to ₱32,920,343.00 for the same purpose, 
provision of skills training to chosen SLP beneficiaries, for a total of ₱313,022,516.35. As 
indicated in the approved schedule of projects, the funds were for the cost of skills trainings 
amounting to ₱301,098,881.35 and ₱11,923,635.00 for EAF.  
  
110. However, verification of the status of implementation of the skills trainings for the 
different livelihood projects as of December 31, 2020 disclosed minimal accomplishments, 
the details of which were as follows:  

 
Table 9.  Status of implementation of Skills Training as of December 31, 2020 

Status of Projects Amount 
Percentage of Skills 

Trainings Undertaken 

On-going  ₱   43,201,670.62  14.35% 
Completed  752,750.00  .25% 

Cancelled  9,488,100.85  3.15% 

Not Implemented  247,656,359.88  82.25% 

Total  ₱ 301,098,881.35  100% 
  
111. Out of the 26,798 intended beneficiaries, only 5,513 individuals have been provided 
skills training. The cancellation and non-implementation of the required skills trainings 
deprived 21,285 or 79.43 percent of the intended beneficiaries of the benefits that could have 
been derived from the projects had the IA conducted the required trainings.  
   
112. Inquiry with the personnel in-charge of monitoring the projects and as reflected in 
the status reports revealed that some projects are still on-going because the items needed for 
the trainings like the starter kits are not available yet and still for procurement by the IA. 
The much-delayed procurement of the needed materials should have been a ground for the 
termination of the contract. Moreover, the processing of the licenses for security services 
projects contributed to the delay in the implementation of the projects.     
  
113. The cancelled projects pertained to those considered as not feasible and those that 
can be implemented without the provision of skills trainings. There are also projects that are 
still feasible with only minimal trainings required. According to the personnel in charge of 
the projects, at times they even tap the services of the Philippine Fiber Industry Development 
Authority (Philfida), Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) and even the LGUs to provide 
the trainings needed by the associations that should have been undertaken by the Bicol 
University.     
  
114. Projects that are feasible and can be implemented even without the provision of skills 
trainings as assessed by the Provincial Coordinator and are still included in the agreement 
with the BU should be cancelled. The Agency should release the SCF for these projects 
upon request in order for the beneficiaries to utilize the funds intended in improving their 
standard of living.    
  



106 
 

115. Management also informed that the IA requested for the extension of the project 
implementation up to December 31, 2020, which was approved by the DSWD FO-5 in 
coordination with the DSWD CO. Yet, despite the extension, the status of implementation 
of the required deliverables was still very low.  
  
116. The foregoing status and conditions appeared that the objective of the program, that 
is, to improve the socio-economic conditions of the poor, vulnerable and disadvantaged 
households, was still not attained. Similarly, the program endeavors to improve the 
implementation process to a more efficient implementation time but was also not attained 
as the project already incurred delays, hence, depriving the beneficiaries of the benefits that 
they could have enjoyed had the required skills trainings and the starting kits been provided 
on time.    
  
117. Had Management regularly coordinated and monitored the funds transferred to the 
IA, the latter could have been compelled to submit its liquidation reports promptly in 
accordance with the reportorial requirements under COA Circular No. 94-013 dated 
December 13, 1994, to determine whether the funds transferred have been utilized for its 
intended purpose. Management could have compelled the IA to fast-track project 
implementation and/or terminated the agreement so that the funds could have been utilized 
to augment other priority programs and projects of the government.  
  
118. We recommended and FO-5 Management agreed to demand from the IA:  
  

a. the immediate performance and completion of the required deliverables of 
the agreement they have entered into, particularly those projects which are 
still under a ‘not implemented’ status;  
  

b. the refund of the corresponding cost of skills trainings including the EAF 
for projects identified by the DSWD as ‘cancelled’; and  
  

c. the submission of the Liquidation Reports/Reports of Disbursements for the 
completed projects, and if they have opted not to continue the provision of 
technical and skills trainings for some of the projects due to some reasons 
like the project is already not feasible, immediately return the 
corresponding cost to the DSWD FO-5, which should be remitted by the 
latter to the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr).  

  
119. We also recommended and FO 5 Management agreed to:  
  

a. require the Focal Person for SLP to review and reassess the feasibility of 
those projects being proposed to be provided by the IA with technical and 
skills trainings, as to whether the organized associations for the project still 
exist and are available, the level of interest and willingness of the 
member/beneficiaries to continue and sustain the chosen project, and 
whether the materials needed for the proposed projects are still available in 



107 
 

the locality, as well as its funding to acquire such materials, if it is still 
enough to acquire such;  
  

b. confer with the IA and ask the timelines when they can perform the 
remaining projects, which is equivalent to 82 percent of the total project 
cost, and if possible, set them a deadline when they can completely deliver 
it, and if ever they decide not to continue some of the projects, immediately 
require them to return the equivalent cost of the projects; and   

  
c. organize a monitoring team to regularly visit and inspect the 

implementation of the program to ensure its success and that the execution 
is still in line with the program’s objective.   

 
Lapses in the implementation of SLP-Livelihood Assistance Grants (LAG) 
 
120. Various lapses in the distribution and monitoring of Livelihood Assistance 
Grants (LAG) to various beneficiaries in FOs 8, 9 and 11 were observed resulting in 
various deficiencies, and thereby affecting the full attainment of the program’s 
objectives. 
 
121. The DSWD issued Memorandum Circular No. 19 Series of 2020, a Special 
Guidelines on the Provision LAG in order to render full assistance as well as cooperation, 
and facilitate mobilization of necessary resources to make possible the undertaking of 
appropriate disaster response aid and measures in a timely manner to curtail and eliminate 
the threat of COVID-19 and to continue to provide basic services to the affected population.   
  
122. The LAG can be used as a seed capital for new alternative income-generating 
activities or certain micro-enterprise ventures.  Further, the grant may also be used as a 
support and an additional capital to the existing viable micro-enterprise of the target 
beneficiary, income of which had been severely affected on account of the declaration of 
public health emergency in the country. 
 
123. Moreover, the LAG can be used to support beneficiaries’ needs for pre-employment 
requirements, with a view of augmenting the expenses to be incurred in securing documents 
in relation thereto, such as payment of certifications (birth certificate, NBI clearance, etc.), 
food and transportation in securing pre-employment documents kits, and food and 
transportation allowance during the first month of employment.  
 
124. The maximum amount of LAG per eligible family shall not exceed fifteen thousand 
pesos (₱15,000.00), the same intended for micro-enterprise or employment-related projects 
or a combination of both and shall only be provided once per family. 
 
125. Table 10, shows the deficiencies noted in the audit of the implementation of SLP-
LAG, to wit:

Memorandum 

Circular No. 19 

Series of 2020 

 

 

The reasons for the 

delay were the 

following 

a. Late receipt of 
Sub-Allotment 
Advise (SAA) 
from DSWD CO;  

b. Delayed budget 
utilization in the 
Regional Level,  

c. Late 
identification of 
targeted 
beneficiaries as 
explained by the 
focal person of 
the SLP Office 
because, they 
would wait for 
any referral from 
different offices, 
presidential 
hotline and  
8888 hotline; 
and  

d. No identified 
beneficiaries for 
the second 
tranche of LAG 
according to the 
focal person of 
the SLP Office 
as also reflected 
in their annual 
accomplishment 
report for CY 
2020. 

 

Hindered the 

implementation 

of projects and 

in turn limits the 

capacity of 

beneficiaries in 

the generation 

of additional 

income intended 

to improve their 

socio-economic 

status. 

 

Deprived the 
beneficiaries 
qualified to avail 
the program of 
the benefits 
thereof. 

FO-8 Management 

agreed to: 

a. give priority to the full 
implementation of the 
SLP through proper 
coordination, 
collaboration and 
communication with 
the program 
implementers to 
improve the socio-
economic status of 
the beneficiaries, 
maximize the 
benefits to be derived 
therefrom, attain the 
ultimate goal of 
reducing poverty 
incidence and 
improving the quality 
of life for the poor, 
vulnerable and 
disadvantaged 
sector; and  

 

b. constantly make a 
follow-up on the Sub 
Allotment Advice 
(SAA) from the 
DSWD CO because 
late receipt of SAA 
would also delay the 
budget utilization in 
the Regional Level 
resulting in delay in 
the implementation of 
the projects and 
inability of the 
beneficiaries to 
generate additional 
income from the 
livelihood and 
business 
opportunities to 
improve their socio-
economic status.

126. In FO-9, various defects/deficiencies were noted in the Grant Utilization Plans 
(GUPs) totaling ₱400,000.00 under the Livelihood Settlement Grants (LSG) for 



114 
 

Former Rebels due to the absence of a full review of the plan by the SLP-RPMO, 
contrary to F.2.a of Annex G of Memorandum Circular (MC) No. 03, Series of 2020.  
 
127. F.2.a of Annex G of MC No. 03, Series of 2020 provides that “The submitted IGP 
with the GUP shall undergo the review of the SLP Regional Program Management Office 
prior to the approval of the Regional Director or his/her OIC. Once approved, it shall 
undergo usual processing prior to disbursement.” 
 
128. Audit of the NTF-ELCAC funds revealed that 20 GUPs with a total amount of 
₱400,000.00 were not fully reviewed by the SLP-RPMO before the approval of the Regional 
Director or his/her OIC, which is not in accordance with the afore-mentioned MC. The 
following were noted during the evaluation of the NTF-ELCAC funds indicating that the 
SLP-RPMO failed to thoroughly review the GUPs: 
 

a. One (1) GUP indicated that its project title was Chicken Production. However, 
the Individual Grant Proposal showed that the project title was Hog Production; 

 
b. Two (2) GUPs contained wrong mathematical computation such as 2 bags of 

hybrid corn seeds at ₱3,500.00 per bag = ₱10,500.00, should be ₱7,000.00; 3 
bags of fertilizer at ₱1,550.00 per bag = ₱2,100.00, should be ₱4,650.00; and 3 
units of ammonium sulfate at ₱950 per unit = ₱1,900.00, should be ₱2,850.00; 

 
c. One (1) GUP specified Corn and Banana Production as the project. However, 

review of the GUP revealed that corn seeds and banana seedlings were not 
among the items to be purchased; 

 
d. 13 GUPs failed to indicate the Target Monthly Income; and 
 
e. One (1) GUPs showed Duck Egg Production and two (2) GUPs specified Piggery 

as proposed projects. Monthly target incomes were ₱28,000.00, ₱24,000.00 and 
₱28,000.00, respectively, which are not realistic for a start-up working fund of 
₱20,000.00 each. 

 
129. The SLP-RPMO in FO-9 explained that the reviews were hurriedly done due to time 
constraints as the project was rolled out towards the end of the year already. 
 
130. While the timely distribution of grants to beneficiaries is crucial, review is very 
important in any economic climate. Its purpose is to assess the proposal and institute change, 
if necessary. A quick but thorough review is required even for small scale livelihood projects 
such as the LSG by ensuring that mathematical computations are checked; targets are 
realistic; and information is complete and consistent.   
 
131. Information on the monthly target income seems to be minute. However, a business 
plan is not complete without a financial forecast.  
 



115 
 

132. We recommended and FO-9 Management agreed to issue an Office 
Memorandum to all Project Development Officers (PDOs) including Regional Project 
Management Officers (RPMOs), Regional Program Coordinators (RPCs), and Special 
Project Focal Persons (SPFPs) reminding them the importance of review of any project 
proposal ensuring correctness, completeness and logical information on the project 
proposals. 
 
Inappropriate Documentation of E-CLIP and LSG Assistance 
 
133. In FO-13, disbursed Enhanced Comprehensive Local Integration Program (E-
CLIP) and Livelihood Settlement Grants (LSG) Assistance amounting to 
₱1,280,000.00 and ₱4,040,000.00, respectively, to 330 former rebels were supported 
with inappropriate and/or with lacking documentation, thereby, casting doubt on the 
propriety and validity of the transactions. 
 
134. Section 4 (6) of PD 1445 provides that “Claims against government funds shall be 
supported with complete documentation.” 
 
135. Section 1 of Administrative Order (AO) No. 10, series of 2018 states that E-CLIP 
aimed to provide complete package of assistance to former rebels (FR) who were members 
of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP), New People’s Army (NPA), and National 
Democratic Front (NDF) as well as their immediate family members, who have surfaced 
beginning on the date of the effectivity of the Order and expressed their desire to abandon 
armed struggle and become productive members of society. 
 
136. Likewise, DSWD MC No. 3, series of 2020, was issued as a “Revised Guidelines in 
the Implementation of EO No. 70, series of 2018 or the Institutionalizing the whole-of-
nation approach in attaining inclusive and sustainable peace, creating a national task force 
to end local communist armed conflict, and directing the adoption of a national peace 
framework.” 
 
137. Section VII (B) of the above MC stipulated the implementation of EO 70 through 
two (2) tracks such that the first track focuses on providing assistance to former rebels as 
they reintegrate into the community, and the second track addresses risks and vulnerabilities 
to build community resiliency by ensuring the delivery of basic services, strengthening the 
government mechanisms and processes, among others. 
 
138. Basically, in the first track, the DSWD interventions include the assessment of the 
qualification of former rebels to the existing programs to expedite service delivery by 
taking into consideration their profile and the peculiarities of their circumstances, with focus 
on, but not limited to the following: 

 
 Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (4Ps); 
 Sustainable Livelihood Program (SLP); and 
 Assistance to Individuals in Crisis Situation (AICS) 

 



116 
 

139. The eligible former rebels may be provided by the SLP with LSG amounting to 
₱20,000.00. It will be provided on a per family basis with one (1) or more Former Rebels 
(FR) who are “duly certified by the Joint AFP-PNP Intelligence Committee (JAPIC), 
endorsed by the E-CLIP Committee and at least 18 years old. However, in case the 
beneficiary representing the family is 16-17 years old, a consent from the legal guardians or 
parents must be submitted.  
 
140. Moreover, DSWD provides allocation for AICS services pursuant to DSWD MC 
No. 11, series of 2019 now superseded by DSWD MC No. 24, series of 2020, otherwise 
known as the Amended Revised Guidelines on the Implementation of the AICS. To qualify, 
former rebels and their family must present their JAPIC Certification and endorsement by 
the E-CLIP committees of LGUs. For this type of clients, DSWD provided an amount of 
₱10,000.00 financial assistance. 
 
141. Audit of the CY 2020 Cash Advances and Liquidations documents of the AOs who 
rendered the payout intended for the beneficiaries of either the E-CLIP under Crisis 
Intervention Section (CIS) and Provision for LSG under SLP disclosed observations which 
are presented below.

 Signed Original Cash Assistance

 ID/ Barangay. Certificate of Identity 
wherein 16 beneficiaries were not

117 
 

 
142. Based on the enumerated observations, DSWD only supported the transactions with 
either a photocopy or Certified True Copy (CTC) of the Certification from JAPIC. 
Moreover, for the E-CLIP Enrollment Form/Endorsement from E-CLIP Committee, only 
CIS submitted a CTC while SLP submitted none. The Certification from JAPIC and the 
Endorsement from the E-CLIP Committee are the only vital documents attesting the 
eligibility of the beneficiaries to receive the assistance. Moreover, the identity could not be 
ascertained through the usual and proper channel like presentation of government-issued 
identity cards. Thus, the original copy of the certification attesting the identity and eligibility 
of the beneficiaries should not be dispensed with or replaced with the certified copy of the 
document. These documents could pinpoint accountability and can hold signatories 
accountable for any unwarranted event related to the certifications issued.  
 
143. It is noteworthy to mention that on other AICS transactions or claims, the DSWD 
requires from their client’s original copies of all proofs of eligibility documents such as 
billing statements and medical abstracts, among others. The same manner should be applied 
to the assistance given to the rebel returnees. If the certification from JAPIC and the 
Endorsement from E-CLIP Committee are the only documents that could be produced to 
attest eligibility, then the same should be submitted in original copies. Had these transactions 
been properly reviewed as to propriety of supporting documents, these lapses could have 
been corrected prior to submission of documents to the Audit Team for post-audit. 
 
144. The foregoing requirements are provided in DSWD MC No. 3 series of 2020, thus, 
improper/incomplete documentation of claims could have been detected and corrected if the 
Accounting Section had properly reviewed the documents supporting the cash advances and 
liquidations for this assistance vis-a-vis the guidelines issued. 
 
145. Because of the foregoing gaps, the propriety and validity of the disbursements for E-
CLIP and LSG Assistance could not be ascertained in the total amount of ₱5,320,000.00 
given to 330 former rebels’ beneficiaries. 
 
146. We recommended and FO-13 Management agreed to: 

 
a. Enjoin the CIS Head and SLP RPC to submit the original copies of the (i) 

Certification from JAPIC, and (ii) Endorsement from E-CLIP Committee 
to attest to the eligibility of the beneficiaries; and 

 
b. Henceforth, require the Accountant to “review thoroughly” all 

documentation supporting any claims against government funds to establish 
propriety and validity of transactions.

COVID-19 related expenses 
 
Procurement 
 
147. Various lapses in the procurement of goods and services under the Bayanihan 
Acts 1 and 2 were noted in FOs 2, 4A, 9 and 11, thus, casting doubt on the 
accountability and transparency of procurement and regularity of the transactions. 
 
148. GPBB Circular No. 01-2020 dated April 6, 2020 set guidelines for emergency 
procurement under Republic Act No. 11469 or the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act. It 
enumerates the procedures and documentary requirements in the procurement of goods and 
services. 
 
149. Meanwhile, GPPB Resolution No. 18-2020 under Bayanihan 2 requires the 
Procuring Entities (PEs) to submit: 
 

a. revised Omnibus Sworn Statement, regardless of the amount of the approved 
budget for the contract (ABC); and 

 
b. a certification stating that it exerted all efforts to secure the most advantageous 

price for the government based on existing price data of the agency, the DTI or 
other relevant agencies or preliminary market scanning done by the agency 
showing prevailing market prices and practice.  

 
150. GPPB Resolution No. 19-2020 under Bayanihan 2 already adopted the rules and 
procedure of Competitive Bidding or Public Bidding under RA 9184 and its 2016 revised

Payment of Hazard Pay  
 

153. Payments of hazard pay during the period of Enhanced Community 
Quarantine (ECQ) for FOs 2, 9 and 11 were not in accordance with the provisions of 
DSWD Administrative Order (AO) No. 26 dated March 23, 2020 and DBM Budget 
Circular (BC) No. 2020-1 dated March 24, 2020, which resulted in overpayment of the 
said benefit and overstatement of the Hazard Pay account by ₱8.500 million because of 
payment made to unauthorized personnel who physically reported to work during the 
ECQ. 
 
154. Section 1 of AO 26 states that, “National Government Agencies (NGAs) are 
authorized to grant COVID-19 Hazard Pay to personnel who physically report for work 
during the implementation of an Enhanced Community Quarantine in their respective work 
stations, in an amount not exceeding ₱500.00 per day per person.” 
  
155. Likewise, Section 4.3 of DBM BC No. 2020-1 provides that, “The 
personnel/workers have been authorized to physically report for work at their respective 
offices or work stations on the prescribed official working hours by the head of agency/office 



122 
 

during the period of implementation of Enhanced Community Quarantine measures in the 
area of such office or work station.” 
 
156. Further, Section 4.4 of the same Circular provides that,“The total rate of the COVID-
19 Hazard Pay shall be based on the number of days an employee/worker physically reports 
for work during the Enhanced Community Quarantine period using the formula: 

 
COVID-19 Hazard Pay = ₱500 x No. of Days Physically Reporting for                                                                 
Work during the Quarantine Period” 

 
157. Section 5.6 of COA Circular No. 2020-019 provides the following as supporting 
documents for the payment of Hazard Pay: 

 
a. Authority for the entitlement to the allowance;  
b. Terms of Reference/Memorandum of Understanding with provisions for 

authority to pay private health workers;  
c. Certificate of attendance during the ECQ/MECQ period; and 
d. IATF Resolution of the Risk Classification in the workplace.

vouchers had missing supporting documents as provided in the above-mentioned circulars 
and/or administrative orders.

160. We also observed in FO-9 that income and/or final taxes were not imposed on the 
above hazard pay, except for one claimant. Although taxes due and withheld may be 
adjusted at year-end, we reserve our right to examine the reasonableness and accuracy of 
the computation thereof upon submission of the related documents to the Audit Team. 
 
161. The rules and regulations outlined in the various Regional Office Orders issued by 
the agency incorporates sound internal control measures, creation of audit trail and 
compliance with public policy on transparency in government transactions. The lack of 
supporting documents runs counter to rules and regulations, hence, renders doubtful the 
accuracy, validity and propriety of the related disbursements. 
 
162. We recommended and the Management of FOs 2, 9 and 11 agreed to: 
 

a.  Enjoin FO-2 concerned officials and employees to: 
 

i. abide by the provisions of Administrative Order No. 26 dated March 23, 
2020 and DBM Budget Circular No. 2020-1 dated March 24, 2020 in the 
grant and payment of Hazard Pay to prevent irregular, unnecessary, 
excessive and extravagant expenditures of government resources;  

 
ii. return in the most expeditious manner the excessive hazard pay 

received; and 
 
iii. henceforth, strictly comply with the guidelines on the grant of COVID-

19 Hazard Pay and provide the necessary supporting documents.  
 

b. Direct the FO-9 responsible officials to: 
 

i. remind the Accountant to ensure that any transaction without the 
required documentation shall not be processed for payment;  

 
ii. review and improve its existing practices and policies on processing 

disbursements which shall include, but not limited to, issuing a 
memorandum to all personnel on the required supporting documents of 
each type of claim; and 

 
iii. require the concerned payees to submit the lacking documents.  

 
c. Enjoin FO-11 responsible officials to require: 

 



124 
 

i. the approving authority to provide the Audit Team a copy of the duly 
signed and approved Disbursement Voucher for the payment of 
P58,000.00 Hazard Pay; 

 
ii. the submission of the Special Orders or Memorandum authorizing those 

who report for work as Skeletal Workforce during the period being 
claimed for payment of COVID-19 Hazard Pay to preclude the 
transaction from being suspended in audit; 

 
iii. the justification as to the validity of the computation for those personnel 

who have claimed one (1) day on May 15, 2020 despite having rendered 
only a portion thereof to preclude the transaction from being disallowed 
in audit;  

 
iv. the justification as to the validity of the claim for those personnel who 

have submitted daily time records that have not been approved and 
those without entries to preclude the transaction from being disallowed 
in audit;  

 
v. the justification as to the excessive imposition of income tax and present 

proof that no overage/shortage of withholding taxes were made; and 
 
vi. henceforth, ensure strict adherence to the documentary requirements 

for payments as set forth in Section 4 (6) of PD 1445 and intensify 
controls placed.  

 
Food and Non-food items (FNI) 
 
163. Disbursements amounting to ₱32.511 million were made contrary to pertinent 
provisions of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012, DSWD MC 04 series of 
2020, and DSWD Administrative Order No. 03 series of 2015, on the distribution of 
FNI by FOs 3 and 11 to LGUs affected by COVID-19, casting doubt on the regularity 
of transactions 
 
164. Food and Non-Food Items, under Item 5 of the DSWD-DOLE-DDTI-DA-DOF-
DBM Joint Memorandum Circular (JMC) No. 1, series of 2020, is defined as “Food and 
essential personal hygiene and family items regularly provided by the DSWD during 
disaster operations; however, taking into consideration the declaration of the Enhanced 
Community Quarantine to lessen exposure to other individuals, DSWD shall provide food 
packs during the quarantine period as an augmentation to the LGUs, as agreed by the 
members of the Inter-Agency Task Force Technical Working Group (IATF-TWG) on social 
amelioration.” 
 
165. Revised Documentary Requirements for Common Government Transactions (COA 
Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012), states the general requirements for all types of 
disbursement, to wit: 



125 
 

a. Certificate of Availability of Funds issued by the Chief Accountant 
b. Existence of lawful and sufficient allotment duly obligated as certified by 

authorized officials 
c. Legality of transaction and conformity with laws, rules or regulations 
d. Approval of expenditure by Head of Office or his authorized 

representative 
e. Sufficient and relevant documents to establish validity of claim 

 
166. Moreover, under DSWD AO No. 03 series of 2015: DSWD Disaster Response 
Operations Guidelines, Section III, Part III on Specific Actions per Response level specifies 
that DSWD shall: 
 

“Food and Non-Food Items (FNI) Distribution 
   xxx 

5. Ensure that proper documents are provided to the escorts for 
the documentation of delivery and acknowledging receipt; 
6. Submit the accomplished documents upon completion of the 
delivery to the distribution hub for proper reporting and 
monitoring purposes.” 

 
167. Lastly, DSWD MC 04 series of 2020, Section IX.A.2, paragraph 3, provides that 
“for all FNI distributed, accomplished Relief Distribution Sheet (RDS) shall be 
submitted to the City/Municipal government by the Barangay for onward submission to the 
DSWD Field Office concerned.” 
 
168. Review of the transactions showed the following lacking documents:

Disaster Response and Rehabilitation Section (DRSS) 
disclosed that the said provision in the MOA was not 
observed and they were not able to secure the list of 
affected individuals/families per Barangay for the 
distribution of FNIs. 
 
The DRSS Chief further explained that for the distribution of 
FNI, they only used the guidelines prescribed in the DSWD 
Operations for COVID-19 Response dated March 19, 2020 
provided by the Undersecretary of Disaster Response 
Management Group. The said guidelines only required an 
official request from the LGU and RDS as documentary 
requirements for the FNI augmentation.

 travel restrictions entering Davao;  
 errors/wrong RDS submitted; 
 non-availability of signatories; and  
 for transmittal by LGUs

170. COA Circular No. 2012-001 and DSWD MC 4 s. 2020 were issued as controlling 
regulations to streamline and harmonize the implementation of various social amelioration 
programs particularly on FNI, to mitigate the socio-economic impact of the COVID-19 
health crisis, thus, non-compliance thereof casts doubt as to the regularity of the transaction. 
 
171. We recommended and Management of FOs 3 and 11 agreed to: 
 

a. follow up the submission of the RDS from the concerned 
LGUs/offices/groups as proof of actual receipt of food and non-food items; 
and 

 
b. require the assigned personnel to diligently monitor, update and check 

compliance with the reportorial requirements and distribution scheme of 
the LGUs for the subsequent completion of FNI transactions. 

 
COVID-19 related Donations 
 
172. In FO-11, non-compliance with the reportorial requirements for donations in-
kind from local sources during the quarantine period; and in FO-2, undistributed 
donations in-kind totaling to 3,242 food packs and sanitation kits, and 21,360 
distributed foods and protective supplies were not supported with Issuance Form or 
Distribution List, contrary to COA Circular Nos. 2014-002 and 2020-009, thus, casting 
doubt on the reliability of and accountability for the aids and donations received, and 
delay in the submission of reports to the National Disaster Risk Response Management 
Center (NDRRMC). 



127 
 

 
173. COA Circular No. 2014-002 dated April 15, 2014 provides that the distribution shall 
be made immediately especially the perishable goods/items.  
 
174. Item V of the same Circular states that: 
 

“The Donee-Agency shall prepare monthly reports on the receipt and 
distribution/utilization/issuance of in-kind donations. Separate reports shall 
be prepared for relief goods and PPE based on the Registry of Donated 
Relief Goods for DRRM and Property Card, respectively. The reports shall 
be submitted to the OCD, copy furnished the COA Auditor, on or before 
the 10th day of the ensuing month until all donations are fully 
consumed/utilized.” 

 
175. COA Circular No. 2020-009 dated April 21, 2020 was issued to temporarily relax 
the application of certain provisions in COA Circular No. 2014-002 dated April 15, 2014 
and COA Memorandum No. 2014-009 dated August 28, 2014 in areas subject to quarantine 
during the period of the State of Calamity, in so far as receipt, recording, distribution, 
reporting and direct release of donations in-kind and relief goods to the beneficiaries are 
concerned without necessarily disregarding basic controls to ensure that the donations are 
properly accounted for and remains effective during the duration of the State of Calamity.  
 
176. The aforementioned guidelines, specifically state that: 

 
 For Donations in-kind from local and foreign sources: 
 

 The recording of donations in-kind before repacking and distribution is put on 
hold during the quarantine. The acknowledgement of the donations in-kind and 
accounting of distribituon and balances by the recipient agencies will suffice 
during this period. 

 
 The recipient agencies shall be required to submit a categorized Summary/List 

of Donations Received, Distributed and Balances (i.e. food, medical supplies, 
medicines, etc.) within ten working days after the end of the quarantine or if the 
quarantine exceeds three months, within ten working days after the end of each 
quarter and supported with: 

 
 Acknowledgement receipts of the donations in kind; 
 Proof of receipt by and distribution to the beneficiaries, not necessarily 

in the required form; and 
 Inventory of remaining undistributed items, if any. 

 
 The costing and recording of the donations will be done after the quarantine and 

only the remaining balances shall be costed and recorded in the books or 
registries. 

 
 In lieu of the monthly report, the concerned agencies shall submit a one-time 

report, separately for cash donations and in-kind donations, within ten working 
days after the end of the quarantine to the NDRRMC through OCD, copy 
furnished the respective COA Auditors, or if the quarantine exceeds three 
months, within ten working days after the end of each quarter. 



128 
 

 
177. FO-2 disclosed that the 3,242 items left undistributed were broken down into 1,558 
food packs and 1,684 hygiene kits for DSWD skeletal workforce, support staff, volunteers 
in repacking, staff in SAP validation and families affected by COVID-19 and Typhoon.  
 
178. In addition to this, 15,196 food and non-foods items distributed to the Regional 
Centers/Care Facilities Clients  as well as donations of protective supplies such as face 
masks and face shields to DSWD staff were without proof of distribution to the beneficiaries 
and/or employees who received the same. 
 
179. For FO-11, verification of the report submitted does not fully represent the total in-
kind donations received by the agency vis-à-vis the items distributed to the beneficiaries, 
i.e., alcohol, facemasks, gloves and PPEs. 
 
180. Enumerated below are some of the observations noted upon verification of the 
Summary/List of Donations and the supporting documents: 
 

 Some of the proof of receipt by and distribution to the beneficiaries does 
not indicate the item(s) received and the date of receipt; 

 
 Acknowledgment Receipt from Davao Light and Power Co. Inc. for 

COVID-19 Relief items contains rectifications on the quantity without 
corresponding signatures; 

 
 100 PPE Sets received from Davao Center for Health and Development 

as evidenced by RIS 20-06-2342 dated June 23, 2020 and received by 
DSWD on July 07, 2020, was not reflected in the Summary/List of 
Donations; and 

 
 DSWD FO-11 ICS No. 20-07-016 pertaining to Infrared Thermometer T-

168 (Donation) was transferred to UCT without cost allocation. 
 
181. In effect, the distribution and direct release of donations in-kind and relief goods to 
the intended beneficiaries could not be ensured and properly accounted for due to lack of 
documents to prove its distribution. In addition, non-compliance with the reports will 
consequently cause delay in compliance and control evaluation of the Auditor and in the 
submission of consolidated report being prepared by the Office of the Civil Defense (OCD). 
 
182. We recommended  and Management agreed that: 
 

a. FO-2 concerned personnel to: (i) immediately release the undistributed 
donations in-kind to vulnerable families affected by COVID-19 and 
typhoons, and not only to the staff of the field office; and (ii) submit Issuance 
Slip and Distribution List to support the issued/distributed donations in 
kind, in compliance with the rules and regulations on donations; and 

 
b. FO-11 concerned personnel to: (i) immediately submit the Summary/List of 

Donations Received, Distributed and Balances of all in-kind donations 
received to the NDRRMC, through the Office of Civil Defense, copy furnish

the Audit Team for the foregone two-quarter duration of the quarantine as 
prescribed in COA Circular No. 2020-009; (ii) comply with the required 
attachments with the Summary/List based on COA Circular No. 2020-009 
as specified above; and (iii) instruct the concerned personnel to be mindful 
of reportorial requirements with regard to donations of which they are 
accountable of. 

 
Emergency Subsidy Program-Social Amelioration Program (ESP-SAP) 
 
Lapses in the handling of SAP Funds  
 
183. Lapses in the handling of the SAP funds in FO-1 through: (a) prevalent transfer 
from one (1) Accountable Officer to another of the unexpended amount of 
₱14,107,500.00; and (b) over-the-counter withdrawals for the payment of additional 
SAP beneficiaries amounting to ₱57,315,500.00, is not in keeping with the DSWD 
Memorandum dated May 22, 2020 and COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 
1997. 
 
184. Section 123 of the Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 defines internal control as the 
plan of organization and all the coordinate methods and measures adopted within an 
organization or agency to safeguard its assets, check the accuracy and reliability of its 
accounting data, and encourage adherence to prescribed managerial policies. Section 124 
of the same PD also states that it shall be the direct responsibility of the agency head to 
install, implement, and monitor a sound system of internal control. 
 
185. Paragraph IV(3.5) of the Guidelines on the Refund of the Social Amelioration 
Program Subsidies from Local Government Units, Special Disbursing Officers, and Other 
DSWD Payment Partners issued by DSWD in its Memorandum dated May 22, 2020 
provides that if the SDOs cannot deliver the refund and collection of unutilized SAP Fund 
to the DSWD due to the quarantine declaration, the SDO may make an electronic transfer 
or deposit the refund to the respective LCCA of the FO and immediately email the scanned 
copy of the proof of deposit/electronic transfer to the official email accounts of the Regional 
Director and FO Cashier. 
 
186. We noted during the conduct of cash examination on the accountability of one (1) 
of the SDOs on October 14, 2020, the non-compliance by Management with the Paragraph 
IV (3.5) of the Guidelines on the Refund of the Social Amelioration Program Subsidies 
from Local Government Units, Special Disbursing Officers, and Other DSWD Payment 
Partners.  
 
187. The SDO of FO-1 showed refunds of cash advances that were not granted to the 
AO, who clarified that the refunds presented are for the cash advances of other AOs which 
was turned over to him for the reason that these unexpended amount of ₱14,107,500.00 
could not be returned to the FO due to the travel restrictions imposed. 
 



130 
 

188. Evidently, there was non-compliance, not only by the SDO who is being (cash) 
examined but also by those entrusted with funds by not directly refunding to the Cashier or 
depositing the drawn cash advances to the Local Currency Current Account (LCCA) of the 
FO. 
 
189. Further, analysis of FO-1 SAP account withdrawals and the Statement of Cash 
Advances Granted, Liquidated and Balances as of year-end disclosed that the SDOs were 
able to withdraw cash advances amounting to ₱57,315,500.00 thru over-the-counter 
withdrawals or the use of withdrawal slips, contrary to COA Circular No. 97-002 dated 
February 10, 1997, which strictly provides that cash should be handled under the general 
principles of the imprest system emphasizing that payments must be made by checks.  
 
190. We recommended that FO-1 Management: 
 

a. strictly require the SDOs to cease from transferring their funds to other 
SDOs to avoid loss or fraud of public funds through illegal/fraudulent use 
and /or to refund the unexpended amount to the Cashier; and 

 
b. strictly comply and stop over-the-counter withdrawals. All payments, 

except those that are allowed to be paid through petty cash, be made 
through checks. 

 

191. Management commented that the Social Welfare and Development (SWAD) Team 
Leaders of Ilocos Norte and Ilocos Sur resorted to handing over the unreleased SAP subsidy 
for those found to be ineligible beneficiaries to the OIC-Chief of Finance and Management 
Division who was then in Ilocos to deliver cash for another payout. 
 
192. Management further explained that the withdrawals were accompanied with 
approval/request of the Regional Director. 
 
Auditor’s Rejoinder 
 
193. We maintain our position that Management strictly adhere to the guidelines set forth 
under DSWD Memorandum dated May 22, 2020 prescribing the Guidelines on the Refund 
of the Social Amelioration Program Subsidies from Local Government Units, Special 
Disbursing Officers, and Other DSWD Payment Partners. The SDOs should directly 
turnover to the Cashier or deposit any refund on the account opened for SAP Refunds as a 
control measure to eliminate the risk of loss or fraud.  
 
194. While the over-the-counter withdrawals were approved by the Regional Director of 
DSWD FO-1, the process is still a departure from the Imprest System. The date of payment 
including the details of the distribution must be submitted to justify that there was urgency 
of needs that Management resorted to over-the-counter withdrawals. 
 
 



131 
 

Unutilized SAP Fund 
 
195. The eligibility of the targeted beneficiaries of the cash assistance under the SAP 
for FOs CAR, 2, 7, 8 and 11 were not sufficiently validated resulting in the unutilized 
SAP funds amounting to ₱780.712 million, thus, denying the unpaid 139,300 
beneficiaries who are qualified to avail of the program.  
 
196. DSWD Memorandun Circular No. 04, series of 2020 set the Special Guidelines on 
the Provision of Social Amelioration Measures by the DSWD to the most affected residents 
of the areas under community quarantine and continuation of the implementation of the 
Social Pension for Indigent Senior Citizens and the Supplementary Feeding Programs 
 
197. DSWD Memorandum Circular No. 09, series of 2020 set the Omnibus Guidelines 
in the Implementation of the Emergency Subsidy Program of the DSWD. 
 
198. DSWD Memorandum Circular No. 14, series of 2020 set the Special Guidelines in 
the Implementation of the Emergency Subsidy Program of the DSWD for the Additional 
Beneficiaries. 
 
199. DSWD Memorandum Circular No. 22, series of 2020 set the Special Guidelines on 
the Implementation of the Provisions of Republic Act No. 11494 or the “Bayanihan to 
Recover as One Act” concerning DSWD and the Continuing Implementation of Republic 
Act No. 11469. 
 
200. In DSWD Memorandum Circular No. 14, series of 2020, the waitlisted beneficiaries 
are the additional eligible beneficiaries who were not included and were not provided with 
Emergency Subsidy by the LGUs or any government agency for the first tranche. These 
beneficiaries also include those who availed of the appeal system under Item XII of MC 
NO. 09, series of 2020 and those included by the LGUs in the list of waitlisted or left-out 
in their locality and Pantawid members who were not earlier included. These beneficiaries 
shall be referred to as Certified list or Clean list who were validated to determine eligibility, 
eduplicated or crossmatched with all the available databases by the DSWD Information and 
Communications Technology Management Service (ICTMS) group of the CO and FOs to 
ensure no duplication as provided by MC No. 14 and MC No. 17, series of 2020. 
 
201. In DSWD Memorandum Circular No. 22, series of 2020, additional beneficiaries 
were granted Emergency Subsidy but shall include only those affected low income families 
in areas under granular lockdown and those who are qualified but were not granted subsidy 
under RA 11469. The payment under this MC was coursed through direct cash pay-out by 
the designated Special Disbursing Officers of the DSWD. 
 
202. However, FOs CAR, 2 ,7, 8 and 11 reported an unutilized amount totaling 
₱780,712,572.00 due to the inclusion of unqualified beneficiaries in the masterlist, and 
consequentially, depriving at least 139,300  families who are qualified for the program.

11 274,506,000.00 45,751 

TOTAL 780,712,572.00 139,300 

 
203. Given the scarcity of government resources for COVID-19 expenses, there is a dire 
need to properly evaluate targeted beneficiaries through proper coordination and 
monitoring, and proper and efficient validation that could maximize the number of qualified 
beneficiaries who could benefit from the SAP.  
 
204. We recommended that FOs CAR, 2, 7, 8 and 11 Management: 

 
a. conduct adequate evaluation and validation of the beneficiaries in close 

coordination with their respective LGUs; and  
 
b. provide additional list of qualified beneficiaries in case the masterlist 

submitted is found to contain ineligible beneficiaries, so as to maximize the 
utilization of the fund to achieve the program’s purpose. 

 
205. The DSWD FOs Management commented as follows: 
 

FO 2 There was unutilized amount because some of the listed 
beneficiaries were found to be ineligible or disqualified 
during the conduct of pay-out and validation. Initially, no 
assessment was conducted before the preparation of the 
payroll since they were prepared as soon as practicable to 
provide quick and immediate augmentation. 
   

FO 7 The amount returned by the LGUs amounting to 
₱173,870,460.00 represents the excess of funds versus the 
actual number of eligible beneficiaries after the conduct of 
the validation. 
 
Further, the amount transferred to LGUs was based on the 
regional allocation for DSWD FO-7 provided by the DSWD 
CO. 
 

FO 8 The reason for the big refunds was due to the bloated numbers 
of the classified poor families wherein the basis of the 
DSWD-CO was the classified lists report of the Philippine 
Statistics Authority (PSA) in 2015. According to the 
Regional Director, the list was after the Super Typhoon 
Yolanda and that the Eastern Visayas got one (1) of the 
biggest emergency fund response for COVID-19 pandemic.  



133 
 

Auditor’s Rejoinder 
 
206. The verification of some Reports of Disbursements (RODs) and Liquidation Reports 
submitted to COA by FO-7 Management showed that refunds of excess fund transfers were 
from individuals who earlier received the assistance and later have returned/refunded the 
same to the LGUs as evidenced by the list of names of said individuals. The list of names 
of individuals who returned/refunded the said assistance was attached to support the amount 
of the OR on refunds as part of the liquidation made. Thus, the Audit Team (AT) disagrees 
with Management’s comment that the returned/refunded amount of ₱173,870,460.00 
represents excess of funds versus the number of eligible beneficiaries after the conduct of 
the validation. Furthermore, the AT stands by its audit observation that the inadequate 
evaluation and validation of beneficiaries resulted in substantial amount of unutilized funds 
of ₱173,870,460.00 returned/refunded by paid beneficiaries found to be ineligible for the 
subsidy, contrary to the provisions of RA 11469, known as the “Bayanihan to Heal as One 
Act” and the guidelines set in  DSWD Memorandum Circular No. 09, Series of 2020, 
thereby depriving qualified or rightful beneficiaries from the benefit of the program. 
 
Unliquidated CA to SDOs – ₱848.243 million 
 
207. Cash Advances granted to SDOs from FOs CAR, 1, 2, 4A, 4B, 5, 9, 10 and 12 
for the implementation of ESP-SAP has an unliquidated balance amounting to 
₱848,242,787.85 despite the timeframe given to liquidate such cash advances as 
prescribed in DSWD Memorandum Circular No. 14,  series of 2020 and COA Circular 
97-002 dated February 10, 1997, thus, resulting in exposure of government funds to 
possible loss or misappropriation.  
 
208. Paragraph XI of DSWD Memorandum Circular No. 14 series of 2020, Workforce 
complement and Institutional Arrangements, provides that: 
 

DSWD Field Offices shall process the liquidation and refund, which shall be 
completed and submitted from the last day of the distribution of emergency subsidy. 

 
209. The rules and regulations on the grant, utilization and liquidation of cash advances 
are prescribed in COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 and states that: 

 
“A cash advance shall be reported on as soon as the purpose of which it was given 
has been served.” 

 
210. Unliquidated advances as of December 31, 2020, outstanding per FOs, showed that 
a total amount of ₱2.271 billion was granted for the distribution of Emergency Subsidy 
under the Social Amelioration Program. The details are presented in Table 17.

               * Note: Data as of September 30, 2020 

 
211. The existence of unliquidated cash advance shows non-compliance with the 
provisions of DSWD MC 14, series of 2020, which states that “DSWD Field Offices shall 
process the liquidation and refund, which shall be completed and submitted from the last 
day of the distribution of the emergency subsidy”. 
 

Table 18: Schedule days delayed 

DSWD Office Days of delay 

4A 4 to 103 days 

5 62 to 83 days 

9 63 to 143 days 

 
212. The deficiency casts doubt on the proper implementation of the program and 
exposes the funds to possible loss or misuse. The delay in the liquidation of funds due to 
the failure of Management to monitor and strictly comply with COA Circular No. 97-002 
and Section 89 of PD 1445 also prevented the timely audit of the transactions and immediate 
correction of deficiencies. 
 
213. We recommended that concerned FOs Management: 

 
a. assess the scheme adopted to expedite the distribution of the cash assistance 

to the affected individual and/or families brought about by the health crisis; 
and 

b. remind all concerned officers and employees strict compliance with Section 
89 of PD 1445 and COA Circular No. 97-002 on the granting, utilization, 
and liquidation of cash advances. 

 
214. The DSWD FOs Management commented as follows: 
 

FO 2 The implementation of Bayanihan 2 will be extended for the year 
2021, hence, the unliquidated cash will be used in its continuing 
implementation and all liquidation reports will be submitted to the 
Accounting Section as soon as supporting documents are 
completed.

FO 4B The SDOs are struggling in submitting the liquidation reports 
because the payment of SAP for Bayanihan 1 overlaps with the 
payment of SAP for Bayanihan 2. They also conducted 
simultaneous pay-outs to beneficiaries of different programs. 
They also mentioned that pay-out in Palawan was hampered by 
the election ban due to plebiscite in Palawan. 

 
FO 5 For most of the SDOs, there are additional cash advances granted 

to SDOs with existing CA for the implementation of SAP because 
of the need to immediately distribute the financial assistance to the 
program beneficiaries as well as difficulty of transmitting the 
liquidation documents to the Field Office. Most of the cash 
advance balances for SAP that appeared to be unliquidated were 
already paid out to the beneficiaries, however, the same were not 
yet booked as liquidated due to the late transmittal of the 
liquidation documents. Management promised that they will 
ensure that all cash advances granted for CY 2020 will be 
liquidated before the year ends.  

 
Unliquidated Fund Transfer to LGU – ₱4.363billion 

 
215. Due from LGUs account representing fund transfers of FOs NCR, 4A, 4B, 5, 6, 
and 8 to the LGUs for SAP has an unliquidated balance amounting to 
₱4,363,735,262.00 as of December 31, 2020, contrary to DSWD Memorandum 
Circular No. 04, s. of 2020, and COA Circular No. 94-013, thereby, preventing the 
timely audit of the transactions and immediate correction of deficiencies by 
Management.   

 
216. Memorandum Circular (MC) No. 04 s. of 2020 provides guidelines in the 
implementation of Emergency Subsidy Program (ESP) in the form of Assistance to 
Individuals in Crisis Situations (AICS), Food and Non-Food Items (FNI) and Livelihood 
Assistance Grants (LAG) to the families and individuals most affected during community 
quarantine. Section IX, provides among others, that payouts/distribution by LGUs must be 
completed within seven (7) days and ten (10) days for Geographically Isolated and 
Disadvantaged Areas (GIDAS) from the receipt of funds. It further provides that the LGU 
must ensure the submission of the Report of Checks (ROC) issued or Report of 
Disbursement duly certified by the LGU Accountant and approved by the Local Chief 
Executive (LCE), and copy of Official Receipt for any refund of unutilized balance to the 
DSWD within fifteen (15) working days from the completion of the distribution. 
 
217. Likewise, Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) executed between the DSWD and 
the LGUs include, among others, the following provisions:  

 
“6. Claim the check/s or validated List of Due and Demandable Accounts Payable 
- Advice to Debit Accounts (LDDAP-ADA) whichever is applicable, from the 
DSWD Field Office (FO) through the City/Municipal Treasurer or the authorized 



136 
 

representative of the LGU, and issue the corresponding Official receipt or 
Acknowledgement Receipts and copies of the bank accounts.  
 
7. Determine the most efficient arrangement with each beneficiary on how the 
assistance shall be delivered taking into consideration the strict home quarantine 
protocol, social distancing or the guidelines imposed by the Inter Agency Task 
Force on COVID-19, provided that the assistance is actually received by the 
beneficiaries;  
 
8. Ensure the delivery of assistance to the beneficiaries based on the payroll within 
seven (7) days from the receipt of the funds from the DSWD; provided that those at 
geographically isolated and disadvantaged areas (GIDA) shall complete delivery 
within ten (10) days;” 

 
218. Moreover, Section 4.6 of COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994 
provides that within ten (10) days after the end of each month/end of the agreed period for 
the Project, the IA shall submit the Report of Checks Issued (RCI) and the Report of 
Disbursement (RD) to report the utilization of the funds.  
 
219. Paragraph 4.9 further states that the IA shall return to the SA any unused balance 
upon completion of the project while Paragraph 5.4 provides that the SA shall require the 
IA to submit the reports and furnish the IA with a copy of the journal entry voucher taking 
up the expenditures. 
 
220. FOs NCR, 4A, 4B, 5, 6, and 8 transferred funds to the LGUs in the total amount of 
₱38,964,908,200.00* for the SAP distribution to affected families/individuals in time of 
community quarantine. Review of liquidation reports showed that ₱4,363,735,262.00 were 
still unliquidated as of December 31, 2020, and there were delays in the LGUs’ submission 
of Liquidation Reports which ranged from three (3) days to 246 days. Details are presented 
in Table 19.

221. For FO 4B, the amount of ₱456,056,257.00 still remain outstanding as of December 
31, 2020. Verification disclosed that as of December 31, 2020, ₱263,989,200.00 was not  
liquidated despite the period agreed upon in the MOA between the DSWD FO-4B - 



137 
 

MIMAROPA provinces, and ₱120,580,057.00 was confirmed by the LGUs as fully 
liquidated or have discrepancies in their records based on the confirmation letters sent on 
September 2020. 
 
222. Processing of financial transaction and operations of the agency without sufficient 
and relevant documents and/or non-submission of liquidation reports will affect the validity 
and propriety of transactions.  
 
223. Likewise, the non-liquidations of the fund transferred to the LGUs which was 
mainly due to lack of monitoring on the compliance of the terms and conditions stated in 
the MOA possibly defeated the purpose of the fund for which it was intended and also 
deprived the beneficiaries of the benefits they could have gained from financial assistance. 
 
224. We recommended and Management agreed that concerned FOs enjoin: 

 
a. The LGUs to fast-track the distribution of cash assistance to the waitlisted 

beneficiaries of SAP; and  
 
b. The concerned FOs’ Accountants to require the LGUs of the immediate 

submission of liquidation reports as provided in DSWD Memorandum 
Circular No. 14, series of 2020 and to coordinate with the LGU with 
unliquidated amount to expedite the immediate submission of the 
Liquidation Reports on SAP as required under DSWD MC No. 04, s. of 
2020 and COA Circular No. 94-013. 

 
Delays in the Distribution of the subsidies from 1 to 60 days  
 
225. Delays in the distribution of subsidies in FOs 3, 11 and 12 ranging from 1 day 
to 60 days, contrary to DSWD MC 09, s. 2020, thus, defeated the purpose of the 
ESP/SAP which is to immediately meet the needs of the people during the 
implementation of the Enhanced Community Quarantine. 
 
226. Section 4.C of Republic Act No. 11469, also known as “Bayanihan to Heal as One 
Act” states: 
 

“Provide an emergency subsidy to around eighteen (18) million low 
income households: Provided, That the subsidy shall amount to a minimum 
of Five thousand pesos (₱5,000.00) to a maximum of Eight thousand pesos 
(₱8,000.00) a month for two (2) months; Provided, further, That the 
subsidy shall be computed based on the prevailing regional minimum wage 
rates: Provided,  finally, That the subsidy received from the current 
conditional cash transfer program and rice subsidy shall be taken into 
consideration in the computation of the emergency subsidy as provided for 
in this Act; xxx.”   

 



138 
 

227. Joint Memorandum Circular (JMC) No. 1 series of 2020 provides the guidelines to 
effectively streamline and harmonize the various social amelioration programs of the 
DSWD, DOLE, DTI, DA, DOF, DBM, and DILG. 
 
228. Thereafter, DSWD issued Memorandum Circular No. 09, series of 2020 which 
provides for the omnibus guidelines in the implementation of the emergency subsidy 
program of DSWD. The main objective is to provide a comprehensive guidance on the 
implementation of AICS and LAG as interventions to aid in the provision of basic 
necessities, amelioration and recovery of the target beneficiaries who are deemed to suffer 
the greatest impact of the implementation of the community quarantine.  Item B., VII of the 
aforementioned MC dictates the transfer of funds, payout of ESP, validation by the DSWD 
and reporting. 
 
229. To facilitate the quick delivery of the urgently needed assistance to the most affected 
families of the areas under community quarantine, the DSWD FOs shall facilitate the 
transfer of funds to the LGUs within twenty-four (24) hours from receipt of the LGUs’ 
signed MOA and budget proposal. Upon receipt of the funds, the LGU must conduct the 
distribution of the ESP within five (5) calendar days, and within seven (7) calendar days, 
for families in geographically isolated and disadvantaged areas (GIDA). For purposes of 
these guidelines, “calendar days” shall include weekends. 
 
230. Results of audit revealed that the distribution of the emergency subsidies in 117 
Municipalities/Cities of Region 3 were delayed from 1 day to 31 days, in FO-11, the auditors 
observed that 30 LGUs incurred delays from 1 day to 60 days, while all the Barangays under 
the 50 Municipalities in Region 12 were delayed from 5 days to 27 days.  
 
231. DSWD MC 09, s. 2020 is very clear that upon receipt of the funds, the LGU must 
conduct distribution of the ESP within five (5) calendar days, and within seven (7) calendar 
days for families in geographically isolated and disadvantaged areas (GIDA). For purposes 
of these guidelines, “calendar days” shall include weekends. The same Circular also 
provided that the DSWD shall assist the LGUs to ensure the timely provision of this 
subsidies.  
 
232. These delays defeated the purpose and emergency in nature of the ESP/SAP, thus, 
do not support the government’s efforts to immediately provide interventions to aid target 
beneficiaries who are deemed to suffer the greatest impact of the implementation of the 
community quarantine. 
 
233. We recommended and FOs 3, 11 and 12 Management agreed to:  

 
a. enhance the monitoring system of all program/projects to be implemented 

to ensure that delay in implementation would be avoided;  
 
b. update existing database to facilitate efficient identification, validation and 

verification processes needed for financial aid programs; and

c. submit justification/reports on the delays in the distribution of the 
subsidies to the municipalities. 
 

Delayed submission of Liquidation Report (LRs) and supporting documents 
  
234. Delayed submission of LRs and supporting documents in FOs NCR, 3, 8, 11 
and 12 ranging from 2 days up to 211 days were incurred, contrary to Item 14, Section 
I(A) of the MOA of the DSWD and LGU and Item E, Section VIII of the DSWD 
Memorandum Circular No. 09 series of 2020, which affected the timely validation of 
supporting documents.  
 
235. Item E, Section VIII of the DSWD Memorandum Circular No. 09 series of 2020 
provides that “The LGU must ensure the submission of the following liquidation and 
financial reporting documents to the DSWD within fifteen (15) days from the completion of 
the distribution.” 
 
236. Moreover, Item 14, Section I(A) of the Memorandum of Agreement entered into by 
and between the FO-NCR and LGUs of National Capital Region last April 2020 states that 
“the LGU should liquidate the funds within the period of fifteen (15) working days from the 
date of actual distribution and submit the report with the following documents: 
 

14.1  Report of Checks (ROC) issued or Report of Disbursements (ROD) duly 
certified by the LGU accountant and approved by the LCE; and  

14.2   Copy of Official Receipt for any refund of unutilized balance.”  
 
237. Validation of DSWD FOs records disclosed that the submitted liquidation reports 
by the LGUs incurred a delay ranging from 2 days to 211 days as presented in Table 20.  
 

               Table 20: Schedule of Delayed Submission 
FOs No. Days Delayed 

NCR 208 to 211 days 

3 2 to 87 days 

8 196 to 204 days 

11 at least 21 days 

12 10 to 28 days 

 
238. It is worthy to note that the timely re-duplication process of the DSWD that will be 
used as basis for the distribution of the 2nd Tranche of the SAP depends on the timely 
submission of the LGUs. The cause of the delayed submission is still for further validation 
of the COA FOs. 
 
239. Moreover, for FO-11, per inquiry with the Accountant, delays and unliquidated fund 
transfers were discussed during Management Committee meetings and was addressed by 
means of assigning an accounting staff in monitoring and issuing demand/follow-up letters 
to the responsible LGUs. Corroboration with the documents submitted disclosed that 



140 
 

demand letters were indeed issued during the months of May and June 2020 and 
subsequently during the months of September and November.  
 
240. However, with the aforementioned observations, it could be deduced that the 
assigned personnel was not cautious in carrying out his/her duty and the Management was 
not diligent in observing the terms and conditions of the MOA and is defiant to its own 
Memorandum Circular No. 09 series of 2020.  
 
241. We recommended and Management agreed that FOs NCR, 3, 8, 11 and 12 
Regional Directors enjoin their respective Regional Accountants to:  
 

a. coordinate with the LGU Accountants and require them to submit 
immediately the liquidation reports and the complete supporting 
documents; and 

 
b. remind the LGU Accountants on the provisions of DSWD Memorandum 

Circular No. 09 series of 2020 and the MOA, relative to the implementation 
and liquidation of the fund transfers, for their strict compliance. 
 

Deficiencies observed from the data uploaded in the database/payroll 
 
242. Various lapses were found in the encoding of the data of the beneficiaries in the 
Social Amelioration Card Encoding Application (SACUP) such as: (1) FOs 3 and 4A 
incurred a variance of 27,071 from actual beneficiaries serves vis-à-vis beneficiaries 
generated in the SACUP; (2) failure to detect the age qualification of the beneficiaries; 
(3) presence of duplicated entries; and (4) incomplete details of the Valid Identification 
Card, thus, casting doubts on the completeness and reliability of the database against 
actual paid beneficiaries. 
  
243. MC Circular 09 s. 2020 provides that the DSWD shall monitor and facilitate 
submission and consolidation of the report such as the registry of beneficiaries and data on 
the number of beneficiaries served or unserved. 
 
244. The DSWD-ICTMS generated data of beneficiaries thru the use of Social 
Amelioration Card Encoding Application (SACUP). It is a web-based information system 
used to upload the information provided in the Social Amelioration Card of qualified 
emergency subsidy beneficiaries.  
 
245. Audit disclosed, particularly in FO-3, that the data in the Social Amelioration Card 
of 26,234 of beneficiaries in various provinces in Region 3 were not encoded in the SACUP. 
 
246. Further, the Audit Team could not ascertain if the data of beneficiaries encoded in 
the SACUP are the actual paid beneficiaries of the LGUs due to non-submission of the 
documents as required under MC 09 s. 2020. 
 
247. Management explained that the LGUs were pressed for time for the uploading of 
data in SACUP despite the extension provided by the DSWD and DILG. Moreover, the 



141 
 

LGU’s explained that they experienced problem with internet connection, accessibility of 
the SACUP, inadequate number of equipment and manpower.  
 
248. Section VII.A.1 of MC No. 09 s. 2020 provides, “For all beneficiaries a valid ID is 
required upon verification of the validation team, and upon claiming the ESP. The 
beneficiaries may be required to submit a certificate from the barangay that they are in 
need assistance from the government due to the COVID-19 outbreak, in lieu of any of the 
certification specified in the following enumeration. Depending on the kind of beneficiary, 
the following are the specific requirements: 

 
Beneficiary/ies Specific Documentary Requirements 

Homeless 
Families and 
other 
Vulnerable 
Groups 

As applicable: 
 
Certification from the Barangay they are located certifying that they are 
homeless families or belonging to other vulnerable groups, or from the 
CSWDO/MSWDO/PSWDO where they are located 

Indigent 
Indigenous 
Peoples 

Certification from the NCIP or the tribal chieftain/council of elders that 
the beneficiaries are Indigenous Peoples (IPs) and are on subsistence 
economy 

Informal 
Workers 

As applicable: 
Driver’s License 
Tricycle Operators and Driver’s Association (TODA) ID or 
Certificate of membership from the Organization/Association; or 
Certificate of Public Convenience (CPC); or  
Certification from the Barangay/Municipality for TODA only. 
Employment ID; or 
Kasambahay ID; or 
Certificate of Employment/Separation from Suspension of Work from 
the employer; 
Proof of business; 
Any other proof showing employment/occupation/enterprise 

Farmers and 
Fisherfolks 

ID or Certification issued by the DA-RABAS and BFAR, as the case 
may be. 

 
249. The details of the Valid Identification are necessary in filling up the Social 
Amelioration Card. The said SAC Forms should have been endorsed to the DSWD FO 
(Section VIII B.4.b of MC No. 9 s. 2020) and validated within 15 days from receipt of 
documents and determine the following: (a) eligibility of the beneficiaries; and (b) 
duplication in the benefits granted (Section VIII B.6 of MC No. 9 s. 2020)  
 
250. With regard to this, FO-3 has the following findings in the Social Amelioration Card 
Encoding Application: (a) The 38,649 beneficiaries omitted to upload the details of the 
Valid Identification Card, and (b) The SAC Encoding Application failed to detect the 1,741 
applicants as to age qualification. FO-11 also has 734 beneficiaries listed with ages ranging 
from 5-17 years old; 100-120 years old and without value. 
 
251. In relation to DSWD MC No. 09 s. 2020, FO 3 and FO 11 had also observed 11,532 
and 2,002 duplicate entries respectively (e.g., entries are either of the same name, same 
birthdate, etc.) of recipients in the registry of beneficiaries/payroll were uploaded thru the 
Social Amelioration Card Encoding Application. 



142 
 

 
252. The other duplicate entries with the same name could not be validated due to lack 
of details on the data uploaded in Social Amelioration Card Encoding Application, non-
submission of Social Amelioration Card of the LGUs to DSWD and lack of listings of the 
paid beneficiaries that should have been submitted supporting the Report of Disbursement 
in the LGU’s liquidation report.  
 
253. Management explained, particularly the head of the ICT, that it is only the system 
that can invalidate the entries with the same household ID number. Hence, should the 
beneficiary have the same data but with different household ID number, the system will 
accept the encoded data. 
 
254. Furthermore, FOs 3 and 4A had validated the actual number of beneficiaries vis-à-
vis SACUP database and resulted in a difference as shown in the table below. 
 

Table 21. Actual Number of Beneficiaries Served vs. Actual Beneficiaries Encoded

TOTAL 1,763,126  1,741,554  21,572  

 
255. The foregoing observations casted doubt on the degree of prudence, due diligence 
and propriety of measures in validating the accuracy of the data in the registry in relation to 
screening, qualifying the eligibility of the beneficiaries and monitoring the submission of 
the encoded Social Amelioration Card of LGUs. Likewise, the accuracy and completeness 
of the registry of beneficiaries maintained by FOs 3 and 4 could not be ascertained. 
 
256. We recommended and Management of FOs 3 and 4  agreed to: 

 
a. submit justification/explanation on the difference noted from actual 

number of beneficiaries served vis-à-vis SACUP database; 
 
b. conduct review and investigation on the (i) occurrence of duplicate entries; 

(ii) questionable information as to birthdates of applicants on the registry 
of beneficiaries; and (iii) non-uploading of proper identification 
card/certificate or uploading of appropriate card/certificate in the Social 
Amelioration Card Encoding Application; 

 
c. improve the monitoring mechanisms on the residual activities of the ESP 

including the maintenance of accurate database and evidence supporting 
the reports for auditing purposes; 

 
d. consider the creation and dissemination of the best practices record in 

different regions which may become relevant in the succeeding similar 



143 
 

programs, and henceforth, strengthen the controls on the (i) screening and 
selection of beneficiaries; and (ii) review thereof such that every 
beneficiary should possess all the qualifications evidenced by proper and 
complete documentation following the criteria set by the governing 
memoranda; and 

 
e. impose appropriate legal sanctions, if warranted against the processors or 

beneficiaries found to have employed fraudulent act that benefit from the 
program. 

 
257. Social Amelioration Program from CO and FO-6 representing the 1st and/or 
2nd tranche were paid to identified beneficiaries who were considered not eligible, 
pursuant to the DA-DBM-CSC-DILG Joint Memorandum Circular (JMC) No. 2 
series of 2020 and DSWD Memorandum Circular No. 09, Series of 2020 resulting in 
payment to unqualified beneficiaries based on the Audit Team’s sample size 
amounting ₱3.587 million. 
 
258. Section 5 of the DSWD Memorandum Circular No. 09 Omnibus Guidelines in the 
implementation of the Emergency Subsidy Program (ESP) of the Department of Social 
Welfare and Development provides that the ESP shall be provided through various national 
and local government social amelioration programs to around 18 million families qualified 
as “low-income” that are most affected by the virtual economic standstill and most 
vulnerable to the economic slowdown resulting from the COVID-19 crisis and are now 
unable to earn for their daily sustenance under the stay-at-home or community quarantine 
conditions.  
 
259. The provisions relevant to the payment of SAP are as follows: 
 

 Item V.A of the Joint Memorandum Circular No. 2 series of 2020, Joint 
Implementing Guidelines for the Implementation of the Social Amelioration 
Program for the Second (2nd) tranche sets the Limitations on the Provision of 
Emergency Subsidy which states “Consistent with R.A. No. 11469, the DSWD 
shall cater to low-income families, with no income or savings to draw from and 
shall include families who are working in the informal economies or those 
whose family member/s belong to the vulnerable groups, as elucidated in the 
various Memorandum Circular of the DSWD, specifically Memorandum 
Circular Nos. 09 and 14, series of 2020. Provided that the qualification shall 
be per family and not per individual. 

 
 The DSWD-SAP shall be given per family in a house or residence, within the 

locality where they are residing at the time of the implementation of the 
program.” (Underscoring ours)   

 
260. Item IV.E of DSWD Memorandum Circular (MC) No. 09 defines family as a social 
unit generally composed of a father, mother, and/or children, including all individuals who 
live under the authority of another, and includes the domestic workers of the family; 



144 
 

Provided, that a solo parent who has custody of his/her children is considered as family. For 
the purpose of implementation of the Social Amelioration Program, the terms “household” 
referred to in R.A. 11469 shall be defined as family. 
 
261. Further, Item IV-H of the said Circular states that, the Social Amelioration Card 
(SAC) is a barcoded form with series numbers, distributed at the Barangay Level that 
captures the family profile which will be the mechanism to monitor the provision of the 
social amelioration programs of the government and the DSWD. In addition, Section VI-B 
sets those who are excluded to receive the ESP.  
 

a. Elected and Appointed government official/s (i.e., permanent, contractual, 
casual, co-terminous) or personnel contracted (under Memorandum of 
Agreement; Cost of Service, Job Order and other similar arrangement/s) in 
any National Government Agency (NGA), Government-Owned and 
Controlled Corporation, Local Government Unit and GOCCs with original 
Charter; 

 
b. Employees in the private sector, or those in the informal economy, including 

those who are employees of GOCCs without original charters, regardless of 
the existence of employee-employer relationship, and regardless of the fact 
that they are receiving salary or wage; 

 
c. Retired individuals who are receiving pension; and 
 
d. Families with independent financial capacity consistent with the intent of RA 

11469 to provide ESP only to low income families.  
 
262. Furthermore, Section VIII of the JMC No. 2 states “in observance of the limitations 
explained in item IV (C) of this Circular, any person or family who knowingly or 
unknowingly, or is found upon deduplication, to have received emergency subsidy from 
multiple sources (agencies), shall be required to refund to DSWD the excess subsidy he/she 
or the family is not entitled to receive. 
 
263. Moreover, Item VIII-B thereof states: 
 

B.5 – Within fifteen (15) days from the completion of the distribution of the ESP, 
the LGU shall submit to the DSWD FOs the encoded SAC Forms in 
accordance with the DSWD-prescribed matrix. After the initial payout and 
for every payout thereafter, the SAC shall be updated by the LGU staff to 
reflect the assistance received by the beneficiaries under any government 
agency’s social amelioration programs. 

 
B.6 – The DSWD shall conduct validation within fifteen (15) days from receipt of 

documents enumerated in the preceding paragraphs.  The DSWD shall 
determine the following: (a) eligibility of the beneficiaries; and (b) 
duplication in the benefits granted. 



145 
 

264. JMC No. 2, Item 7 also provides that the DILG, thru the LGU, shall provide 
assistance to the partner agencies and actively participate in terms of the following, among 
others: 
 

a. Provide the DSWD with the list of beneficiaries; 
 
b. Assist the beneficiaries in Relief Agad registration; 
 
c. Assist the DSWD, through the LSWDO or any other personnel that may be 

assigned by the LCE, in the distribution of the Emergency Subsidy; 
 
d. Identify and prepare the venue where the payout will be conducted taking into 

consideration the minimum health standards set by the IATF and if needed, 
provide the necessary shuttle services, assistance and logistical support to the 
DSWD and the beneficiaries especially those belonging to the vulnerable 
sector. 

 
e. Post in all LGU official website, social media accounts, and at conspicuous 

places the list of beneficiaries who already received the emergency subsidy; 
and  

 
f. Perform other functions or activities consistent with the provisions of the JMC 

No.  
 
265. To establish the reliability of records, documents and database submitted by 
Management as well as the completeness and existence of beneficiaries, we have conducted 
a validation of SAP beneficiaries on a sampling basis through interview with beneficiaries, 
analysis and matching with existing records/database and payroll files, and verification of 
encoded SAC forms. The beneficiaries were selected in the SAP database, payroll and 
liquidation report randomly.  
 
266. Due to the foregoing, the CO and FO-6 paid 251 and 118 unqualified beneficiaries 
amounting to ₱2,513,000.00 and ₱1,074,000.00, respectively. Details are as follows:

267. We noted the unqualified beneficiaries as follows: 
 

a. Beneficiaries without household member/s; 
 
b. Two paid beneficiaries claimed the same individual as their household 

members in the SAC form; 
 
c. Both husbands and wives claimed ESP either in the same barangay or in 

another barangay;  
 
d. The same individual was listed in two separate households either as 

household head or household member; and 
 
e. Families with members working in the government, working in private 

entities, receiving pensions from SSS and Solo living (no members of the 
family) which were considered as ineligible/unqualified beneficiaries in 
accordance with the above mentioned JMC, yet still granted with SAP. 

 
268. While we acknowledged that the selection process rests with the LGUs and we 
commend Management in its effort to enhance the selection process and deduplication 
procedures to prevent the same from happening, addressing the current situation and 
strengthening the selection process is an utmost importance to prevent payment to ineligible 
beneficiaries. 
 
269. We recommended and Management agreed to direct the concerned DSWD 
officers to: 
 

a. investigate/evaluate the list of beneficiaries and their qualification for the 
Social Amelioration Program; 

 
b. initiate refund from the identified unqualified beneficiaries;  

 
c. assign/hire additional personnel to conduct the validation of beneficiaries 

in cases where there will be additional benefits to be granted; and  
 
d. adopt measures to strengthen the selection process of beneficiaries in 

accordance with existing laws/rules and regulations.  



147 
 

 
270. CO Management comments with corresponding Auditor’s Rejoinder as follows: 
 

Management Comment Auditor’s Rejoinder 
The selection and assessment of eligibility of 
beneficiaries rests with the Local Government Unit. 
 
As clearly pointed out by the DSWD and 
acknowledged by the Audit Team, the selection and 
assessment of beneficiaries were solely done by the 
LGUs. This is true as the majority of the 
beneficiaries paid in the second tranche by the 
DSWD were first tranche beneficiaries who were 
listed, found qualified, and paid with their [first 
tranche] SAP subsidy by the LGUs. The additional 
or waitlisted beneficiaries were similarly identified 
and certified as to their eligibility by the LGUs. 
 
Unless the beneficiaries were subject to complaints 
that were brought to the knowledge of the DSWD, 
through its nationwide AOC, the regularity in the 
performance of duty by the LGU officials who 
identified, listed, and certified that these 
beneficiaries are qualified and should be the ones to 
receive the SAP subsidy on the guidelines cascaded 
by the DSWD to them. 

a. We acknowledge that the responsibility for 
the selection of SAP beneficiaries rests with 
the LGUs; however, we would like to 
emphasize that one of the responsibilities of 
the DSWD is to evaluate whether the 
distribution of the SAP meets the program’s 
target and objective based on Joint 
Memorandum Circular No. 2. 
 
b. We appreciate the commitment of the 
DSWD to investigate/assess the observations 
noted, however, limiting this to only the list 
identified by the Audit Team may result in the 
non-identification on the scale/extent of the 
inclusion of those not qualified to receive the 
SAP and remove those who are truly eligible 
for the program. 

 
 

Solo Living Individuals 

The Incomplete SAC App does not mean automatic 
ineligibility of beneficiaries as other beneficiary 
information could have been missed out in the 
encoding. This may be the case for the solo living 
individuals, as there have been reports that only the 
sets of information of the family heads were encoded 
in some occasions. The best reference is still the 
SAC form distributed per family in each household 
by the LGUs, actually filled out by the beneficiary 
and signed by the Punong Barangay. 

There may also be a possibility that the persons 
interviewed who claimed to be living alone have 
dependents elsewhere in the Philippines, hence, 
identified and assessed by the LGUs as eligible. But 
again, this may be verified by the FOs as they 
actually validated the beneficiaries on the list 
endorsed by the LGU. 

 

Management presumed that the Audit Team 
based its observation by relying solely in the 
SAP App. However, we would like to 
emphasize that the observation was based on 
the actual validation conducted in the Regions 
by assessing the SAC forms and interviewing 
identified beneficiaries on a sampling basis. It 
may be the responsibility of the LGUs in 
assessing the qualification of beneficiaries, 
however, it is still worthy to revalidate the 
beneficiaries identified, to be able to provide 
SAP to those who really are qualified. 



148 
 

Receipt of pension 

Another concern was the receipt of pension by 
individuals, which was the reason why in 
Memorandum Circular No. 14 series of 2020, the 
exclusion pertaining to families with pensioners has 
been elucidated to refer to families whose members 
are receiving pension above the prescribed 
maximum regional emergency subsidy. 

As can be gleaned from the afore-cited provision, the 
receipt of pension will only disqualify families if the 
amount thereof is more than the prescribed 
maximum regional emergency subsidy or the SAP 
subsidy identified per region. This is in 
consideration of the fact that most of the 
beneficiaries validated are receiving meager pension 
amount, as low as P500 which is not enough to 
sustain their own and their family’s needs, and only 
a few have exceeded the prescribed SAP subsidy, 
hence, are still qualified,  based on the guidelines. 

 

 

While we acknowledged the provision of 
M.C. 14, that those identified beneficiaries 
who are receiving pension below the 
maximum regional emergency subsidy can be 
qualified, we still recommend to the 
Management to assess whether the identified 
beneficiaries who are receiving pension meet 
the criteria as set forth in the MC. 

Beneficiaries with family members who are working 
in the government 

Not all workers in the government are disqualified. 
Clearly, those engaged by the government and are 
only receiving those not covered by the Salary 
Standardization Law and persons who are 
voluntarily serving the government may still qualify 
as long as they are assessed as belonging to “low 
income families” and are not 4Ps beneficiaries or not 
otherwise falling under other disqualifications under 
the DSWD Guidelines. The key is the assessment by 
the LGUs of the eligibility of beneficiaries they 
identified, listed and certified as eligible. 

 

 

 

The Audit Team acknowledges the reason of 
Management in this regard. However, not all 
of those identified beneficiaries where 
receiving low income, some of which are with 
Plantilla Position having permanent position 
in the Government. Thus, it is still necessary 
to validate the qualification of the 
beneficiaries if they are really qualified to 
receive the assistance.   

Beneficiaries who are employed during ECQ 
 
Under MC No. 09, series of 2020, the target 
beneficiaries shall be families with low-income, 
those who have no income, low income, or no 
savings to draw from, including those who are not 
currently recipients of the current 4Ps, and working 
in the informal economy. 

 
 
It is correct that the MC mentioned the 
qualifications of the beneficiaries that they 
should have low income during the ECQ and 
we acknowledge the comment of 
Management for humanitarian reason that 
they were selected by the LGUs, however, we 
would like to stand with our recommendation 



149 
 

While it may appear on record that some SAP 
beneficiaries validated by the Audit Team were 
receiving income during the quarantine, it must be 
noted that the inclusion of the beneficiaries may 
have been anchored on the qualification that they 
either have “low income” or “no savings to draw 
from” upon assessment. 

Verily, each family has different composition and 
different circumstances that may not be reflected in 
paper, thus, the assessment of the LGU plays a 
primordial importance in determining the eligibility 
of the families provided with SAP. 

During the assessment of the LGU it may have been 
appreciated that these beneficiaries, despite being 
able to earn income during the community 
quarantine, such was not enough to sustain the daily 
needs or sustenance of their families; hence, they 
were not able to save any income. This fact can also 
be supported by the fact that some employers 
adopted different schemes to balance on how they 
can keep their business stay afloat and to provide for 
their employees, such as adopting different work 
schemes, e.g. lesser pay relative to “no-work, no-
pay” principle, and many others beyond the control 
of the DSWD, but may have been appreciated by the 
LGU for humanitarian reasons. 

The DSWD is indeed doing enhancements in the 
selection process of beneficiaries particularly in 
identifying the remaining qualified beneficiaries of 
the emergency subsidy under RA 11494, or the 
Bayanihan to Recover as One Act” side by side with 
the guidelines of the DSWD. 

The DSWD strongly maintains its integrity to 
uphold public trust by being fully accountable with 
the public funds allotted for SAP.  

that it should still be assessed and the 
qualifications be checked for the assurance 
that those who are given, are truly worthy to 
be given assistance.  

We would like to commend Management in 
its commitment to enhance its control and 
maintains its integrity to uphold public trust 
and its commitment to look into the 
observations of the Audit Team.   

 
Overpayment of SAP benefits 

 
271. The SAP from CO and FOs 1, 2, 3, 4A, 5, 6, 7 and 13 granted to identified 
beneficiaries for the 1st and/or 2nd tranche also received other Emergency Assistance 
from government agencies other than DSWD in excess of the threshold set in Joint 
Memorandum Circular (JMC) No. 2 series of 2020 and DSWD Memorandum 
Circulars No. 9, 10 and 14 s. of 2020. Consequently, the deduplication procedures set 



150 
 

by the Management is not sufficient to detect duplication resulting in excessive 
payments based on the Audit Team’s sampling of at least ₱112,900,645.00. 
 
272. Item III (6) of DSWD Memorandum Circular No. 05, series of 2020, as amended by  
DSWD Memorandum Circular No. 10, series of 2020, or the Supplemental Guidelines to 
Memorandum Circular No. 04, series of 2020 in the Provisions of Social Amelioration 
Measures by DSWD states that: 
 

“The 4Ps households, especially those with cash cards, shall therefore receive 
the emergency suvsidy in full amount as top-up to their cash grants and rice 
subsidies. As such, other forms of assistance under MC No. 04, seires of 2020, 
are deemed to have been provided already in principle and 4Ps households will 
no longer be eligible to other social amelioration measures covered by the said 
MC.” 

 
273. Section 5 of the DSWD Memorandum Circular No. 09 re:  Omnibus Guidelines in 
the Implementation of the Emergency Subsidy Program (ESP) of the Department of Social 
Welfare and Development provides that the ESP shall be provided through various national 
and local government social amelioration programs to around 18 million families qualified 
as “low-income” that are most affected by the virtual economic standstill and most 
vulnerable to the economic slowdown resulting from the COVID-19 crisis and are now 
unable to earn for their daily sustenance under the stay-at-home or community quarantine 
conditions.  
 
274. Item IV.C.1 of the Joint Memorandum Circular No. 2 Series of 2020, Joint 
Implementing Guidelines for the Implementation of the Social Amelioration Program for 
the Second (2nd) tranche sets the Limitations on the Provision of Emergency Subsidy which 
states that “A family cannot receive a total amount more than the regional maximum 
emergency subsidy in a month, and cannot exceed the total amount for two (2) months. Any 
amount received by an individual member of the family shall be included in the computation 
of the total amount”.   
 
275. Furthermore, Section VIII of the JMC No. 2 Section VIII states “In observance of 
the limitations explained in item IV (C) of this Circular, any person or family who knowingly 
or unknowingly, or is found upon deduplication, to have received emergency subsidy from 
multiple sources (agencies), shall be required to refund to DSWD the excess subsidy he/she 
or the family is not entitled to receive.” 
 
276. In addition, DSWD Memorandum Circular (MC) No. 14, 17 and 18 prescribe the 
deduplication procedures to avoid provision of excess SAP to the identified beneficiaries of 
the Social Amelioration Program. 
 
277. The deduplication process in MC No 14 states that the DSWD FOs shall entail cross-
matching of the list with the available databases of DSWD and list/s shared by other 
government agencies implementing the SAP to determine if there were duplicates in the 
subsidies provided or beneficiaries that received the same. However, it was amended in MC 
No18 Item III, with the following procedures to be followed: 



151 
 

 
“A. Preliminaries. 
 

The Information Communication and Technology Management Unit 
(ICTMU) shall: 

  
1. Cleanse the regional data inconsistencies, i.e. invalid birthdays 

(formatting, future date, etc). elected minors as head of the families. 
 

1.1. Rectification of records with inconsistencies 
 

Records that were found with inconsistencies shall be rectified by 
the FO in coordination with the concerned LGU. The FO and/or 
the LGU shall refer to the filled-out social amelioration card 
(SAC) of the beneficiaries to ensure that correct records are 
properly encoded in the system.  

 
2. Merge all latest available regional database to the consolidated 

databases from the central office.  
 

3. Optimize the databases by creating indexes.  
 

B. Deduplication Proper.  
 

The Levels 2 and 3 deduplication process, as defined in DSWD MCs 14 and 
17-2020, shall be entirely decentralized at the FO for all lists of beneficiaries 
except for those covered by Item B.2 hereof where the Central Office shall 
conduct the deduplication process.” 
 

278. To establish the reliability of records, documents and database submitted by 
Management, as well as the completeness and existence of beneficiaries, validation of SAP 
payments to recipients revealed that despite the deduplication procedures set by 
Management as internal control, there were still SAP beneficiaries that were paid 
Emergency Assistance from various government agencies in excess of the threshold set by 
the JMC. Consequently, there is an excessive payment of a total ₱112,900,645.00 to 20,196 
beneficiaries, as shown in Table 23.

280. It is worthy to acknowledge the intention of Management to establish the 
deduplication procedure as part of their internal control to avoid the excessive provision of 
emergency assistance to conform with the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act, the JMCs and 
DSWD MCs. However, the identified excessive emergency assistance given to the 
identified SAP beneficiaries which were uncovered during the validation and cross-
referencing confirms loopholes and internal control gaps whether in the prescribed policies 
and procedures or in the implementation thereof. 
 
281. It is also worthy to note that the DSWD has very limited time and manpower to 
implement the program and at the same time, the unpreparedness of the nation for such 
pandemic also contributed to the identified observation. 
 
282. We recommended and Management agreed to direct the CO and FOs’ 
concerned officers to: 
 

a. conduct a strict and thorough deduplication procedure to establish the 
magnitude of the excess received by the SAP beneficiaries;  

 
b. create a team who will validate, investigate and resolve the data issues; 
 
c. demand the refund of the excess Emergency Assistance given to SAP 

beneficiaries that were also recipients from other government agencies, in 
conformity with Joint Memorandum Circular No. 2 series of 2020; 

 
d. submit a status report regularly for monitoring purposes; and  
 
e. disseminate information/policy campaign to all 4Ps beneficiaries and 

discourage/strictly prohibit any duplicity in all claims. 
 
283. The DSWD FOs Management commented as follows: 
 

FO Management Comment Auditor's Rejoinder 
1 Management admitted that the terms on the refund 

was not incorporated in the MOA and that there 
was a need to reconcile and verify records before 
the Accounting Section could prepare the adjusting 
entry to take up the unrecorded receivables. They 
also agreed to tediously coordinate with the LGUs 
for the submission of amended Liquidation Report 
as recommended 

While Management sent 
acknowledgement letters to the LGUs’ 
justifications on the post-validation 
report, it must be emphasized that it is 
different from acceptance in justifying 
the results of the validation. The 
Management must amend the MOA or 
secure additional MOA specifying the 
proper procedure for refunds/ 
justifications. 

2 The duplication was caused by the immediate 
preparation of the payrolls for non-cash card 
beneficiaries based solely on the list given by the 

  



154 
 

Municipalities. However, during the DSWD 
validation and pay-out, it was noted that some 
beneficiaries were not entitled, while those 
beneficiaries initially listed under one household 
are actually residing in separate households, thus, 
they were still allowed to claim because they were 
qualified under the set criteria. Some beneficiaries 
who were paid twice already returned the excess 
amount. 

 
Issues with the DSWD SAP Database 
 
284. The SAP Payroll Nos. GXI.01.0.200729.064 and GXI.01.0.200817.201 of the 
DSWD CO could not be established reliably due to the non-inclusion of 77 recipients 
in the SAP database, thus, affecting the reliability of the SAP database and validity of 
the payment thereof.  
 
285. Simply put, the Cashier overlooked the monitoring of the refund collections where 
said task was solely relied to her staff. Nonetheless, the cashier admitted that she was 
uncertain as to the specific procedures in dealing with these refunds, except that an advisory 
was given to hold the refund collections until the opening of the bank account where the 
same shall be deposited, as stated in the following provisions of the specific guidelines of 
the above-mentioned DSWD memorandum. 
 
286. Section 5 of the DSWD Memorandum Circular No. 09, series of 2020 otherwise 
known as Omnibus Guidelines in the implementation of the Emergency Subsidy Program 
(ESP) of the Department of Social Welfare and Development provides that the ESP shall 
be provided through various national and local government social amelioration programs to 
around 18 million families qualified as “low-income” that are most affected by the virtual 
economic standstill and most vulnerable to the economic slowdown resulting from the 
COVID-19 crisis and are now unable to earn for their daily sustenance under the stay-at-
home or community quarantine conditions.  
 
287. Likewise, paragraph 2, Section III of the DSWD MC No 2020-018 states that no 
payout shall be allowed unless the complete validation process that consists of eligibility 
and duplication checks performed by the LGU/Concerned Agencies and the DSWD, 
respectively is observed.  
 
288. Initial validation was conducted by the Audit Team of the payroll to the SAP 
database to establish the reliability and validity of the transferred fund to the Financial 
Service Providers (FSPs). Among the payrolls that had been validated on a sampling basis 
are Payroll Nos. GXI.01.0.200729.064 and GXI.01.0.200817.201 transferred to 
GXCHANGE Inc. for the beneficiaries of SAP in Caloocan, Makati and Pateros.  
 
289. Verification and reconciliation showed that there are 77 recipients in the payroll that 
were not included in the SAP database, thus, affecting the reliability of SAP database and 
validity of the payment thereof.  



155 
 

 
290. The MC of the Department clearly states that the no pay-out shall be allowed unless 
complete validation process is conducted. It is uncertain if there are validation or 
deduplication conducted by the DSWD before funds were transferred to FSPs, if there are 
missing beneficiaries in the database that the audit team noted.  
 
291. We recommended and Management agreed to require the ICTMS Director to 
submit: 
 

a. justification on why there were SAP recipients not included in the SAP 
Database which formed part of the payroll that were transferred to 
the FSPs; and 

 
b. the updated and complete SAP database, if any, which includes all 

SAP recipients in the payroll forwarded to each FSP to prevent the 
suspension and/or disallowance in audit of unsupported 
Disbursements. 
 

Unpaid SAP Beneficiaries tagged in the database as paid 
 
292. Poor implementation on the supplemental guideline of the MOA between the 
DSWD and the FSPs resulted in 135 identified SAP beneficiaries who have not 
received the benefits totaling ₱920,000.00 that was tagged as “PAID” in the database, 
thus, casting doubt on the validity of payments made by the FSPs.  
 
293. In the signed MOA between DSWD and FSPs stated in “Section III. Obligation of 
the parties are as follows: 

 
A. DSWD shall: 

X X X 
 

12.   Communicate to the beneficiaries the following: 
12.1.     That they will be receiving subsidies 
12.2.    That they will be charged a MINIMAL cash out fee upon cash 

out of the subsidies received through the FSPs; and 
12.3.    That they may call the DSWD-SAP Agency Operations Center 

for queries on the 2nd tranche disbursement; and 
13.    Issue to FSPs a Certification of Donation (BIR Form No. 2322) 

within seven (7) working days upon receipt of certified list of 
beneficiaries refunded and proof of payment for deductions made by 
the FSPs- partner outlets as cash-out fee  

…. X X X 
 

C. FSPs shall: 
X X X 

 



156 
 

  5.    Open a restricted transaction account for each assigned beneficiary 
(e.g. e-money account, basic deposit account) upon receipt of the 
certified list of beneficiaries from DSWD, as per item III, A(2); 

 
6.   Credit the emergency subsidy into the account of the beneficiary once 

the program funds have been received from LBP, but, in no case, 
shall be later then twenty-four (24) hours from receipt of the funds; 
 
X X X 
 

11.    Ensure the assigned beneficiaries are adequately and timely informed 
of the following: 
11.1  Creation of the beneficiary’s restricted transaction account 

and regularization process in accordance to appropriate 
KYC process of the FSPs; 

11.2   The nearest payout centers; 
 11.3   The FSP’s customer care hotline for payout concerns; 
 11.4   Cash out fees (if applicable);  

 
 X X X 

16.    Report to DSWD cases of unutilized subsidies after three (3) months 
from crediting to individual restricted transaction account; 

17.   Return to DSWD or LBP, as applicable, any unutilized funds based 
on DSWD’s instructions; 

18.    Submit to DSWD the detailed and certified liquidation documents 
such as the list of beneficiaries with successful and unsuccessful 
credits; and return uncredited program funds within seven (7) 
working days from receipt of program fund, duly signed by the duly 
authorized signatories, otherwise the FSP shall be liable and 
accountable to the DSWD;  X X X  

 
294. Furthermore, Section III. C. Items 5, 6, 16, 17 and 18 were highlighted in the 
Supplemental Guidelines to the Memorandum of Agreement between and among the DSWD, 
the LBP and FSPs. The aforementioned guidelines aim to resolve the difficulties, challenges 
and timelines encountered by DSWD and the FSPs such as: 

 
a. Enumeration of the data quality issues or other causes of unsuccessful 

transaction that may lead to the return or refund of pre-funded allotment 
by the FSPs, and the corresponding action required;  

 
b. Toll on the running of the seven (7) working day liquidation period subject 

to the immediate sending of notice by the FSP of its finding(s) on the 
uploaded payroll file of any cause as stated in the preceding paragraph; 
and 

 



157 
 

c. Refund process and documentary components for undisbursed or 
unutilized SAP funds pursuant to Item III(C)(17) of the MOA. 

 
295. Review of one of the processes of crediting the beneficiary revealed that the creation 
of restricted transaction account shall be made within 24 hours from the receipt of the 
payroll file for beneficiaries without data quality issues. Crediting of the emergency subsidy 
shall be within 24 hours from receipt of fund or creation of restricted transaction account, 
whichever comes later. However, there may be instances that either DSWD or the FSPs 
may encounter data quality issues discovered prior to the creation of the restricted 
transaction account as enumerated below, that will lengthen the processing period from the 
least one (1) working day, to at most seven (7) working days. 
 
296. Simple Data Quality/Operational issues – issues or conditions that may be 
resolved or can still be repaired or controlled by the DSWD CO or FOs, such as: 
 

a. Inter-changed data vis-à-vis payroll file columns (e.g. mislabeled columns 
like First names under Middle name column and other cases); 

b. Invalid mobile number format (e.g. +639 or missing first digit “0”; 
c. Field office postponement request based on the limitations posed by 

quarantine measures; 
d. LGU postponement request based on the limitations posed by quarantine 

measures; 
e. Incorrect beneficiary reference number (BRN) issued to the beneficiary; 
f. Beneficiary accidentally deleted the text message from the FSP; 
g. Beneficiary did not receive any text message despite correct mobile 

number provided based on the payroll; 
h. Confirmation not received by the beneficiaries to ascertain that transaction 

was successful; and 
i. Beneficiary/ies failed to register immediately upon receipt of the message 

from the FSP due to limited time for the registration process (48 hrs. only) 
  

297. The supplemental guidelines defines Complex Data Quality/Operational Issues 
as conditions deemed impossible to rectify or repair at the level of DSWD, or issues beyond 
its control and shall include those considered as permanently without resolution. Examples 
of these are: 
 

a. Data provided by the LGU was not reliable resulting to additional 
validation on the part of FSPs and adding additional rounds of file hand-
offs (e.g. Names with unnecessary special characters, names spelled 
backwards, or misspelled names); 

b. Incomplete or Invalid Birth Date; 
c. Invalid (less or more than 11 digits, non-existent, or inactive) or No mobile 

number; 
d. Two beneficiaries with the same mobile number; 
e. Duplicate names but with different mobile number; and 



158 
 

f. Incomplete payroll file information (e.g. no birthdate, no middle name, no 
mobile number, etc.) 

 
298. It is worth mentioning and we acknowledge Management’s commitment to establish 
control procedures that are very remarkable and very promising especially in the immediate 
assistance towards those in dire need and less privileged. The timelines are incredibly 
instant considering the fact that the country is experiencing a pandemic and there may be 
different difficulties that can be encountered in executing such process.  
 
299. The procedures and responsibilities are well-defined for each party. It is very 
commendable that the management, along with the FSPs had to put their best efforts and 
even risk their lives just to deliver the assistance to our fellow countrymen. 
 
300. However, loopholes and internal control gaps, whether in the prescribed policies and 
procedures or implementation thereof, were confirmed thru our validation of SAP 
beneficiaries and cross-referencing with the database. It has come across thru our interviews 
and phone calls that there were 135 SAP beneficiaries declaring that they have not yet 
received the 2nd tranche totaling to ₱920,00.00 but the database says otherwise. 
 
301. Furthermore, verification with the recipients who did not receive such tranche 
showed that there were 35 beneficiaries who had changed their cellphone numbers while 
there were 100 beneficiaries claimed that they have the same cellphone numbers or a total 
of 135 beneficiaries on various locations, equivalent to two (2) percent of the total sample 
size of 6,761.  
 
302. Considering the fact that these beneficiaries believed that they were not paid, but in 
reality they were paid as shown in the database, casted doubt on the validity of payments 
made. The procedures mentioned in the MOA for crediting a beneficiary was precisely 
clear, however, it seems that the procedure mentioned in the supplemental guidelines has 
been neglected that resulted in the observation noted. The Management along with the FSPs 
had not completely verified the details of beneficiary before crediting the same. Both parties 
(DSWD and FSPs) were not able to perform their obligations, as itemized in Section III of 
the MOA and explicitly reiterated in the observation issued to verify and communicate to 
beneficiaries their entitlement.  
 
303. Had it been at the onset of the program that a proper communication and monitoring 
were established by management with FSPs, LGUs, DSWD FOs and beneficiaries in the: 
(i) roles and responsibilities of everyone; (ii) selection process of a valid beneficiary and 
(iii) the gathering of required information/data for crediting a beneficiary, there would be 
ease in the program’s processes. Lesser difficulties would be encountered. Timelines would 
be complied and immediate response to the beneficiaries of the program would be fulfilled. 
 
304. Due to the limitations imposed on our audit, we can only rely on samples; however, 
it is worth mentioning that the two (2) percent, if taken as a whole in the implementation of 
the Social Amelioration Program can have a huge impact on the validity of payments made 
to various identified recipients.  



159 
 

 
305. We recommended that Management direct the concerned CO and FOs’ officers 
to: 
 

a. provide justification, details and supporting documents to corroborate and 
clear the observation on beneficiaries’ declaration that they are unpaid but 
per database they are paid; and 

 
b. conduct a strict and thorough review of documents/records/ 

representations uploaded in the SAP database, if accurate and in 
accordance with existing guidelines to prevent the observations noted, 
from happening in the future. 

 
306. Management commented as follows: 

 
CO Management commented as follows: 

 
a. Recommendation for Item a: FMS to check validate information 

with actual liquidation if the FSPs have actually indicated in their 
liquidation that said beneficiaries have been actually paid. 

 
b. The 35 beneficiaries who changed their mobile numbers definitely 

should not be paid as this should not pass the KYC process which 
requires a complete match with the mobile numbers.  

 
c. The 100 beneficiaries who have the same numbers, will have to 

check if they have attempted to claim/cash out their subsidies. 
 
d. There will also be a need to check if the subsidies for the said 

beneficiaries who have not claimed were refunded by the FSPs. 
 
 
 

 Auditor’s rejoinder: 
 
 The Audit Team selected samples from the paid beneficiaries 

database submitted to our office.  
 

 As acknowledged by Management, the 35 beneficiaries should not 
be paid as the Management commented, however, validation 
disclose that it appears in the database that they are paid which puts 
in question were and to whom it was paid for.  

 
 As per interview with the beneficiaries, they are not aware that they 

are already paid and there were no notifications sent to them for 
claiming.  



160 
 

 
 We agree with the Management comment that it should be checked 

if it is refunded by the FSPs, if not, the Management should demand 
refund of all unclaimed subsidies. 

 
Lapses in the validation of the beneficiaries 
 
307. Incomplete validation of the encoded Social Amelioration Card (SAC) of the 
Emergency Subsidy Program (ESP) beneficiaries by DSWD that resulted in the 
following observations: (1) Ineligible Beneficiaries, (2) Duplicate/Same Beneficiaries, 
(3) Beneficiaries employed/with monthly income, and (4) Beneficiaries paid despite 
defective and inadequate supporting documents, contrary to the provisions of DSWD 
Memorandum Circular No. 2020-09 and Article VII of DSWD Memorandum Circular 
No. 04, series of 2020. Furthermore, failure to post the complete list of SAP 
beneficiaries paid through Financial Service Provider (FSP) and SDO payout on the 
Agency’s live monitoring and DSWD official website raise the possibility of double 
payment of the ESP to same beneficiaries. 
 
308. Item IV-E of the DSWD Memorandum Circular No. 09, Series of 2020 dated April 
9, 2020 states that “Family” shall refer to a social unit generally composed of a father, 
mother, and/or children, including all individuals who live under the authority of another, 
and includes the domestic workers of the family; Provided, that a solo parent who has 
custody of his/her children is considered as family. For the purpose of these guidelines and 
only for the implementation of the Social Amelioration Program, the terms “household” 
referred to in Republic Act (RA) No. 11469 shall be defined as “family.” 
 
309. Item IV-H of the said Circular defines the Social Amelioration Card (SAC) as a 
barcoded form with series numbers, distributed at the Barangay Level that captures the 
family profile which will be the mechanism to monitor the provision of the social 
amelioration programs of the government and the DSWD. 
 
310. Moreover, Item VI-A of the same Circular provides the target beneficiaries of the 
ESP. As emphasized in RA No. 11469, it shall be given to low-income families, assessed 
to be most affected by the imposition of the community quarantine, given their existing life 
situations or circumstances.  
 
311. On the other hand, Item VI-B of the same Circular states the exclusion from 
receiving the ESP of families having any of its member/s as:  
 

a.  Elected and Appointed government official/s (i.e. permanent, contractual, 
casual, coterminous) or personnel contracted (under Memorandum of 
Agreement; Cost of Service, Job Order and other similar arrangement/s) in 
any National Government Agency (NGA), Government-Owned and 
Controlled Corporation, Local Government Unit and GOCCs with original 
charter;  

 



161 
 

b.   Employees in the private sector, or those in the informal economy, including 
those who are employees of GOCCs without original charters, regardless of 
the existence of employee-employer relationship, and regardless of the fact 
that they are receiving salary or wage;  

  
c.   Retired individuals who are receiving pension; and   
  
d.   Families with independent financial capacity consistent with the intent of RA 

No. 11469 to provide ESP only to low income families. 
 
312. Further, Item VIII-B of the same Circular on the Transfer of Funds, Payout of ESP, 
Validation by the DSWD and Reporting states:  
  

“B.5 – Within fifteen (15) days from the completion of the distribution of the ESP, 
the LGU shall submit to the DSWD FOs the encoded SAC Forms in accordance 
with the DSWD-prescribed matrix.  
  
After the initial payout and for every payout thereafter, the SAC shall be updated 
by the LGU staff to reflect the assistance received by the beneficiaries under any 
government agency’s social amelioration programs 
 
B.6 – The DSWD shall conduct validation within fifteen (15) days from receipt of 
documents enumerated in the preceding paragraphs. The DSWD shall determine 
the following: (a) eligibility of the beneficiaries; and (b) duplication in the 
benefits granted.” 

 
313. A review of the Social Amelioration Card (SAC) forms of FOs 4A, 5 and 6 revealed 
that there were ineligible beneficiaries due to: a) without household members listed in the 
SAC - this may mean that they are individuals living alone and not considered as a “family”; 
b) a government worker; c) not from a low income family, etc., contrary to the definition of 
DSWD MC No. 09, Series of 2020, summarized in Table 25.

314. Moreover, 306 beneficiaries from FO 4A’s Rizal and Cavite disclosed that they are 
employees in the private/public sector and/or living with members of the family with 
monthly income but was paid ₱1,989,000.00, contrary to Item VI-B of DSWD MC No. 09, 
Series of 2020.

315. Lastly there were beneficiaries paid in FOs 4A and 5 despite defective and 
inadequacy of supporting documents, summarized in Table 26.

8 unspecified 55,186,450.00 

  TOTAL        56,695,750.00  

 
316. It also worthy to note that in the audit of cash advances granted to the SDO in FO 9, 
₱24,570,000.00 were refunded and undisbursed in the payroll prepared due to the presence 
of duplicated names of the beneficiaries, beneficiaries who were already paid, and 
beneficiaries that could no longer be found. 
 
317. There were already efforts made to address the issues noted, however, still not 
completed and need further action from the Management. 
 
318. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Regional Directors 
to: 

 
a. assign personnel who will conduct the validation of SAC Forms. Such 

personnel will establish and ensure that all the listed beneficiaries are 
qualified and that there are no duplications in the benefits granted. Then 
submit the result thereof to the Audit Team; 

 
b. require the accountable officers and/or paymasters to strictly assess the 

completeness of the supporting documents before payment; 
 
c. cause the submission of lacking documents to determine the validity and 

propriety of the subject payment;  
 

d. require all the beneficiaries that have been excessively paid to refund the 
amount of the benefit received;  

 
e. adopt a monitoring system to ensure that the list of all paid SAP 

beneficiaries are properly encoded, uploaded and posted in the DSWD 
Master list; and 

 
f. create a team that will validate, investigate and resolve the data with 

anomalies and communicate the result to the Operation Center, copy 
furnish the respective ICTMS.  

 



163 
 

Non-grant of authority/access to database 
 
319. Failure of Management to: (a) provide access to the database hindered the early 
communication of audit results to Management in relation to COA Circular No. 2020-
010 dated December 2, 2020; and (b) issue supplemental MOA caused confusion to 
LGUs and omission of action as required in the MOA. 
 
320. COA Resolution No. 2020-034 dated December 2, 2020 pertains to the authority of 
COA Auditors to access Information and Communication Systems, Electronic Data 
Messages and Source Documents of the Audited Entities relevant to the conduct of audit. 
 
321. Hence, COA Circular No. 2020-010 dated December 2, 2020 was issued as 
implementing guidelines of the above cited COA Resolution. Section 4.0 of COA Circular 
No. 2020-010 specifically provides that: 
 

4.1 COA auditors shall transmit a written request to the audited entities for 
a read/view, extract, and print access rights to the information and 
communications systems, electronic data messages and source 
documents with adherence to the general data privacy principles of 
transparency, legitimate purpose and proportionality. The request shall 
state the purpose and the specific data which are necessary to be 
accessed to meet its audit objectives. 

 
4.2 Within five (5) working days after the receipt of the request, the audited 

entities shall provide COA auditors a unique user account to establish 
accountability in accessing information and communications systems 
and electronic data. The audited entity may also share the electronic data 
electronically or provide the same through back up files created in the 
entity’s environment and shared on a removable media with COA 
Auditors. The user account profile should have a read, view, print, and/or 
download capability. 

 
322. The COA Audit Teams (ATs) requested the SAP database of FOs NCR and 8; 
however, both the FOs’ management failed to grant the request. FO NCR’s head of the 
ICTMS reasoned out that they have an on-going deduplication process with the LGUs. 
 
323. Moreover, for FO-8, Management denied such access stating that it is the DSWD 
CO that controls and manages the SACUP, and thus, the Regional Director cannot provide 
the AT with access. Stated in their reply as well is the use of the FO 8 of the electronic 
Social Amelioration Cards System (ESAC) as database for the recipients of the SAP and 
that release of any information therein is covered under DSWD Memorandum Circular No. 
08, series of 2020 or the “Simplified Data Sharing Guidelines on the Provision of DSWD 
Programs and Services during a National State of Emergency.” 
 
324. The non-compliance of the officials and/or employees to provide the SAP database 
with the COA Auditors shall be dealt with appropriate administrative sanctions pursuant to 



164 
 

Section 5.0 of the above COA Circular which provides that “Failure or negligence of the 
officials or employees of audited agencies to discharge their duties and responsibilities 
provided herein shall be a basis for appropriate administrative sanctions.”  
 
325. It is worthy to note that the audit will adhere to the general data privacy principles 
of transparency, legitimate purpose and proportionality with the requested data/information. 
 
326. The DSWD FO-NCR and FO-8 failed to provide access in the SAP database and/or 
share the electronic data with the audit team which is not in keeping with COA Circular No. 
2020-010 dated December 2, 2020, thus, precluded the prompt audit of the transactions and 
depriving the early correction of errors/deficiencies and the opportunity of a timely 
reporting of audit results to Management. 
 
327. We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Regional Director to 
instruct the SAP Focal Person and Head of the ICTMS to immediately provide the 
Audit Teams access to the SAP database or provide a copy of the back-up files for 
audit purposes. 

 
 
 

Other Compliance Audit Issues 
 
Gender and Development (GAD) 
 
328. Non-preparation of the CY 2020 GAD Plan and Budget and Accomplishment 
Report precludes the assessment of the Audit Team (AT) whether the DSWD programs 
and activities are responsive of gender issues and the determination of how the agency 
policies, programs, projects and procedures address gender concerns, contrary to 
Section 31 of the General Provision of the GAA for CY 2020 and COA Circular No. 
2014-001. 
 
329. Section 31 of the General Provisions of the GAA for FY 2020 provides that “All 
agencies of the government shall formulate a Gender and Development (GAD) Plan 
designed to address gender issues within their concerned sectors or mandate and implement 
applicable provisions under R.A. 9710 or the Magna Carta of Women, Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the Beijing Platform for Action, 
the Philippine Plan for Gender-Responsive Development (1995-2025), and the Philippine 
Development Plan (2017-2022).  
 
330.  The GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of the agencies, which 
shall be at least five percent (5%) of their budgets. For this purpose, activities currently 
being undertaken by agencies which shall relate to GAD or those that contribute to poverty 
alleviation, economic empowerment especially of marginalized women, protection, 
promotion and fulfillment of women’s human rights, and practice of gender-responsive 
governance are considered sufficient compliance with said requirement.  Utilization of the 



165 
 

GAD budget shall be evaluated based on the GAD performance indicators identified by said 
agencies.” 
 
331. COA Circular No. 2014-001 dated March 18, 2014 provides that the audited agency 
shall submit a copy of the Annual GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) to the COA Audit Team 
assigned to the agency within five working days from the receipt of the approved plan from 
the Philippine Commission on Women (PCW) or their mother or central offices, as the case 
may be. Likewise, a copy of the corresponding Accomplishment Report shall be furnished 
the said Audit Team within five (5) working days from the end of January of the preceding 
year. 
 
332. On January 8, 2021, the AT, in its letter, requested Management for the submission 
of the Approved GPB as well as Accomplishment Reports for the agency’s Gender and 
Development Program in order for us to evaluate the extent of compliance of the agency to 
pertinent rules and regulations concerning GAD-related concerns. As of this report, 
Management still failed to submit the GPB and Annual Gender and Development 
Accomplishment Report for CY 2020. 
 
333. Interview with the GAD Focal Person revealed that they have failed to prepare the 
GPB and the Annual Accomplishment Report. It is worthy to note that the current Focal 
Person only assumed his position last March 2020 which was after the deadline on the 
submission of the GPB to the PCW.  Furthermore, we were informed that it is his first time 
to handle the preparation and consolidation of GPB and Accomplishment Report, although 
admittedly, he already attended training on the preparation of the report, but he still lacks 
the experience to prepare the CY 2020 GPB and accomplishment report and this is an 
additional workload to him.  In addition, the former GAD Focal Person failed to turn over 
the previous GPB, as reference, that contributed to the non-submission of the required 
reports.   
 
334. The non-submission of the GPB and accomplishment report cast doubt on the 
compliance of Management in the implementation of GAD in accordance with Section 31 
of the General Provisions of the GAA for FY 2020. 
 
335. We recommended and Management  agreed to direct the concerned officials to: 

 
b. ensure that proper turn-over of reports be done, so as not to hamper the 

submission of the reports; and  
 
c. strictly comply with existing laws and regulations on the preparation of 

GPB and GAD Accomplishment Report and submission thereof to the PCW 
and COA Audit Team.   

 
Senior Citizen and Person with Disability (SCPD)  
 
336. The DSWD had substantially complied with Section 32 of the General 
Provisions of RA 11465, otherwise known as the GAA of FY 2020, in implementing 



166 
 

programs/projects for senior citizens and persons with disability (PWDs) with the total 
expenditure through the Social Pension Program and activities relating to the elderly 
and differently-abled persons, except for the deficiency noted in paragraph 26.  
 
Payments to Contractual and Job Orders 
 
337. The DSWD hired a total of 10,408 workers under MOA/Job Oder basis, 
representing an additional 71.13 percent workforce to the regular plantilla employees 
of the DSWD. 
 
338. In the implementation of its programs, the DSWD needed to augment its plantilla 
positions to cope with the exigencies of the Agency. MOA/JO personnel were composed of 
Drivers, Social Workers and other administrative aides. Presented below is the data of 
MOA/Job Orders hired for CY 2020.

Compliance with Other Mandatory Accounts 
 
339. In CY 2020, the DSWD, as a whole, complied with the withholding and 
remittance of mandatory deductions, pursuant to the regulations issued by the BIR, 
GSIS, PHIC, and HDMF.  The CO and FOs had faithfully deducted from the salaries 
of its personnel the required taxes, premiums and loan installments, and remitted the 
same as well as the government share within the prescribed period to the concerned 
institutions or agencies.

in personal capacity of the concerned personnel who was remiss in his/her assigned

to GSIS account, as follows: 

 
Table 30. Summary of Unremitted/Delayed Remittance Premium Contributions

CO         424,132.81  The CO complied with R.A. No. 8291, or the Government Service Insurance 
System Act of 1997 on the mandatory deduction of GSIS contributions, 
however, it failed to remit in full the monthly contributions to GSIS resulting 
to an unremitted balance of ₱424,132.81. 

2           15,413.97  Issued AOM re: unremitted balance of ₱15,413.97 included amount 
withheld from various month of 2020 mostly due to salary differential. 

5         263,576.10  The balance of Due to GSIS account as of December 31, 2020 amounting 
to ₱263,576.10 was unreliable due to erroneous accounting entries 
resulting to over or under remittance of contributions to GSIS from prior 
years and long outstanding unreconciled balances. 

9   163,680.77  The negative balance of Due to GSIS amounting to ₱502,186.32 renders 
the reliability, accuracy and propriety of the account doubtful which also 
includes unremitted amount of ₱163,680.77 contrary to RA No. 8291. 

13 1,877,076.81  Unremitted beginning balance of P308,078.54. In compliance to Bayanihan 
to Heal As One Act, the Agency refunded GSIS loan payment totaling to 
₱6,550,304.23. Also, during the year there were adjustments made which 
resulted to a net adjustment amounted to ₱1,734,696.09, thus, the 
unremitted balance as of December 31, 2020 is ₱1,877,076.81

NCR Subsidiary ledgers of Due to GSIS account were not maintained contrary to the suggested sorting 

of GAM Volume III, thereby finding difficulty in determining the nature of the account. The CY 2020 

DVs revealed that salary deductions for remittance to GSIS were lumped to its GL account contrary 

to GAM Volume III, resulting to difficulty in determining the nature of the unremitted amount as at 

year-end.  

 



169 
 

FO Deficiencies Noted 

More so, classifying and recording of deductions subject for remittance to GSIS to sub-accounts 
was not practiced since computation and online remittance is made by the HR Unit. 

 
343. Although no penalty was imposed on the delayed/non- remittances, the foregoing 
lapses are not in conformity with Section 14 of RA 8291. It could also affect the employees’ 
future claims and benefits from that government agency and incurring penalties and 
surcharges is always possible. 
 
344. We recommended and Management agreed to require the concerned 
Accountants of:  

 
a. the CO, FOs CAR, 2, 3, and 5 to ensure remittance of all premiums and 

loans, including the government shares within the prescribed period; and 
 
b. the NCR to maintain SLs for Due to GSIS account to facilitate account 

verification.  
 
Due to Pag-IBIG 
 
345. The Pag-IBIG premium contributions of employees withheld by the following 
DSWD offices were not remitted:

Enforcement of Settlement of Accounts 
 
347. In the audit of various transactions, we noted the non-compliance with laws, rules 
and regulations which resulted in total audit suspensions of ₱9,395.148 million, 
disallowances of ₱934.217 million, and charges of ₱8.173 million or a total of ₱10,337.539
