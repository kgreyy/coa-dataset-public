OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

A. Financial Audit 
 

Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, Special Account balance not confirmed by BTr 

 

1. The absence of regular and periodic monitoring and reconciliation with BTr 
of the agency’s Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, Special Account of 

₱766,912,239.65, coupled with BTr’s lack of confirmatory reply, casted doubt 

on the completeness and accuracy of the recorded transactions; hence, could 

not be relied upon. 

 

As described in the Revised Chart of Accounts (RCA) (Updated 2019), 

Volume III of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), the Cash-

Treasury/Agency Deposit, Special Account is debited in the agency books to 

recognize the amount of collections remitted to the BTr under the Special 

Account in the General Fund (SAGF), and credited to recognize receipt of Notice 

of Cash Allocation (NCA) and upon closing of the SAGF. In the BTr books, the 

account is credited for remittance made by NGAs for SAGF and debited for 

replenishments of agencies’ negotiated checks charged to respective MDS- 

Special account. As such, the agency’s records for said account should always 

reconcile with that of the BTr. 

 

As at December 31, 2020, the agency’s Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, 

Special Account had a balance of ₱766,912,239.65, consisting of the following: 

 

Particulars Amount (₱) 
Unreleased NCA  

National Endowment Fund for Culture and the Arts (NEFCA) shares from the travel 

tax collections of Tourism Infrastructure and Enterprise Zone Authority (TIEZA)

Total   766,912,239.65

On February 16, 2021, the Audit Team sent a confirmation letter to the 

BTr on the balance of the account as at December 31, 2020. However, the BTr 

informed the Audit Team that it only maintains remittances; hence, it cannot yet 

confirm the balance.  Further, BTr is still in the process of reconciling the Special 

and Trust Accounts of various NGAs; hence, it requested all NGAs, including the 

NCCA, to submit the Statement of Account (SOA) together with the List of 

Remittances and Utilization Report for the year 2020 and prior years. 

 

This has been a recommendation contained in CYs 2019 and 2018 Annual 

Audit Reports (AARs), where the Audit Team recommended that NCCA submit 

the documents required by BTr in order to facilitate the reconciliation process.  

Thus, the Accounting and Budget Divisions were able to prepare and submit to 

BTr the required documents for the years 2015 to 2019. 

 

Verification of the account’s recorded transactions showed no deficiency, 

however, the BTr did not confirm the balance; hence, it could not be validated 

whether all transactions from the BTr were captured in the NCCA books and 

accurately recorded. 

 

On October 25, 2020, NCCA sent a letter to BTr reiterating its request for 

reconciliation of records, however, no reconciliation has been done yet, allegedly 

due to BTr having problems with its system. 

 

The absence/lack of regular and periodic monitoring and reconciliation of 

the Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, Special Account balance casted doubt on the 

completeness and accuracy of the said account as of report date; hence, could not 

be relied upon. 

 

We reiterated our recommendation and Management agreed to 

require the Chief Accountant to coordinate with the BTr for the expedition 

of the reconciliation of the Cash- Treasury/Agency, Special Account to 

establish its correct balance. 

 

Management commented, during the exit conference, that the Office of the 

Chief Accountant of NEFCA is continuously preparing the required documents 

for years 2014 and prior, and they will coordinate with BTr for the reconciliation. 

 

 

Erroneous measurement of funds held in trust by BTr in both books of NCCA and 

BTr 

 

2. Funds held in trust by the BTr are recorded in NCCA books of accounts at 
fair market value (FMV) of ₱1,969,663,013.08 instead of at amortized cost 

of ₱1,883,456,125.56, thereby overstating its receivable Due from NGAs 

(BTr) and erroneously recognizing a gain Unrealized Gain (Loss) both 



41 

by ₱86,206,887.52, in non-conformity with Sections 7 and 8, Chapter 7, 

Volume I of the GAM. 

 

Chapter 7, Volume I of the GAM provides principles for presenting 

financial instruments as liabilities or assets, and for recognizing and measuring 

financial assets and financial liabilities.  Section 2(c) defines financial instruments 

as any contract that gives rise to both a financial asset of one entity and a financial 

liability or equity instrument of another entity. 

 

Section 8 provides for the measurement of financial assets, to wit: 

 

After initial recognition, an entity shall measure financial 

assets, including derivatives that are assets, at their fair values, 

without any deduction for transaction costs it may incur on sale 

or other disposal, except for: 

 

a. Loans and receivables and Held-to-maturity investments, 
which shall be measured at amortized cost using the 

effective interest method; and x x x (underscoring supplied) 

 

While Section 7 defines Held-to-maturity (HTM) investments as non-

derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity 

that an entity has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity, whereas 

Available-for-sale (AFS) financial assets are those non-derivative financial assets 

that are designated as available for sale or are not classified as loans and 

receivables, held-to-maturity investments or financial assets at fair value through 

surplus or deficit. (underscoring supplied) 

 

Pursuant to NCCA Board Resolution 2016-337, the Board of 

Commissioners authorized the transfer of the NEFCA (Seed Capital and Interest) 

to the BTr, in compliance with EO No. 338 issued on May 17, 1996, directing the 

transfer of cash balances to the National Treasury. 

 

On March 22, 2016, NCCA entered into an agreement with the BTr 

wherein the latter was granted the authority to act as Fund Manager and manage 

the NEFCA funds pursuant to EO No. 55 series of 2011.   

 

 On March 27, 2017, a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) was executed 

between NCCA and BTr wherein a “NCCA Special Fund” was established.  As 

contained in the MOA, the fund shall be under the management of BTr-Asset 

Management Service (AMS). It is also stated in the MOA that NCCA shall issue 

investment parameters and disbursement schedule to the BTr on the Special Fund.  

On the other hand, the BTr shall manage the Special Fund with the objective of 

maximizing returns and minimizing risks and shall apply prudence and due 

professional care in all investment activities. 



42 

 As at December 31, 2020, the balance of account Due from NGS (BTr) 

amounted to ₱2,891,653,336.17, with details as follows: 

 

Particulars Amount (₱)

Total 2,891,653,336.17 
  *National Endowment for Culture and the Arts (R.A. No. 10066) 

 

 Verification disclosed that the Cash Retained in BTr totaling 

₱921,990.323.09 consisted of interest earned and matured investments that were 

measured at cost, while the Investments in Treasury Bills and Bonds totaling 

₱1,969,663,013.08 were measured at their fair market values. Said amounts were 

based on the BTr’s Statement of Account as of December 31, 2020. 

 

 Based on the above, the BTr classified the Investment as AFS instead as 

HTM. However, inquiry revealed that it was the intention of NCCA to recognize 

its investments as HTM. Also, NCCA, in its letter dated June 28, 2017, submitted 

its Investment Distribution that was approved by the Board of Commissioners 

under BR No. 2016-410 dated December 24, 2016, which shall serve how the 

funds will be invested in various government instrumentalities. 

 

 Review and analysis of the Investment Distribution submitted to BTr-

AMS disclosed that NCCA provided the maturity dates for the marketable 

securities investment, and the expected income that shall be derived, therefore, 

there was no intention to gain income through selling the securities invested. 

 

 A “zoom meeting” with representatives from BTr, officials of NCCA and 

the Audit Team was conducted to further clarify and confirm the correct 

classification of the special fund.  It was gathered from BTr that all investments 

are treated/recorded in their books as Investment AFS to ensure flexibility in case 

of withdrawal of the fund.  It was pointed out that what was previously agreed 

upon is that the investment shall be classified as Investments HTM, however, BTr 

still reported the investments in the SOA at FMV instead of at amortized cost. 



43 

 Since the investments were classified as AFS instead as HTM, the account 

Due from NGAs (BTr), as at December 31, 2020, was overstated by 

₱86,206,887.52, computed as follows: 

 

Type of Investment Amortized Cost 

 (HTM) 

FMV 

 (AFS) 

Difference 

(₱) 

Investment in Treasury 

Bills 

594,281,228.47 598,243,691.61 3,962,463.14 

Investment in Treasury 

Bonds- NEFCA 

789,174,897.09 816,765,554.79 27,590,657.70 

Investment in Treasury 

Bonds- NECA 

500,000,000.00 554,653,766.68 54,653,766.68 

Total 1,883,456,125.56 1,969,663,013.08 86,206,887.52 

  

 Further, considering that the investments of NCCA were measured at 

FMV, the agency erroneously recognized cumulative unrealized gain of 

₱86,206,887.52; thus, overstating the account Unrealized Gain (Loss). Classifying 

investments as AFS will generate unrealized gain or loss reflecting the changes in 

the FMV, unlike under HTM. 

 

 It is of note that no investment certificates/portfolios were provided by 

BTr to support the SOA being forwarded to the NCCA.  Provided in the MOA is 

for BTr to provide the NCCA with a monthly report of portfolio investment 10 

business days after end of each reference month.  

 

  We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a. issue a memorandum to BTr instructing the latter to revise the financial 
qualification of NCCA’s investments from AFS to HTM; 

 

b. instruct the Chief Accountant to prepare the necessary adjusting 
journal entries to correct the account balances, and record future 

investments initially at cost and subsequently at amortized cost, 

pursuant to Sections 7 and 8, Chapter 7, Volume I of the GAM; and 
 

c. direct the Chief Accountant to request from BTr copies of the 
investment certificates/portfolios to support the monthly SOA. 

 

Management, through the Office of the Chief Accountant of NEFCA, 

informed the Audit Team during the exit conference that the proposed issuance of 

memorandum shall be prepared by the Office of the Chairman.

Unreliable Receivables 

 

3. Unliquidated fund transfers to various government agencies totaling 
₱12,929,702.42 that has been (a) dormant for more than ten years, and (b) 

negative balances of ₱16,136,532.49 formed part of the Receivables with a 

balance of ₱3,300,201,622.05 as at December 21, 2020, rendering the account 

unreliable.  Moreover, the (c) variance of ₱33,767,609.04 between the 

accounting records and confirmation replies aggravated the account’s 

unreliability, in addition to the (d) delayed submission to the Office of the 

Auditor of contracts/MOAs covering the fund transfers during the year, 

precluding their timely review and evaluation.

COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016 defines Dormant 

Receivable Accounts as accounts which balances remained inactive or non-

moving in the books of accounts for 10 years or more and where 

settlement/collectability could no longer be ascertained. 

 

Section 8 of the same Circular provides for the procedures to request for 

the write-off of dormant accounts, which must be filed by the head of the 

government entity to the COA Audit Team Leader and/or Supervising Auditor.  



46 

Verification disclosed that the latest demand letters were sent by the 

Accounting Division in November 2019 to two implementing agencies, however, 

no replies were received. During the year, there were no more subsequent action 

to demand settlement of the unliquidated fund transfers by the Accounting 

Division due to the COVID-19 crisis, where operational capacity in the Agency 

was limited.  

 

The failure to compel the implementing agencies (IAs) to liquidate the 

funds they received after completion of the project precluded the Audit Team in 

evaluating the fund utilization, as well as verifying the status of the project 

implementation. 

 

It is also noted that if no further action is to be taken by the Management 

to compel implementing agencies to liquidate the fund transfers, there is a great 

possibility that the next 1.65 percent or equivalent to ₱54,317,258.64 

(₱67,246,961.06 - ₱12,929,702.42) will also become dormant, as seen in the 

Table. 

   

Section 8 of the COA Circular No. 2016-005 provides for the procedures 

to request for the write-off of dormant accounts, which must be filed by the head 

of the government entity to the COA Audit Team Leader and/or Supervising 

Auditor.  

 

 

b) Existence of negative balances 
 

Verification further revealed negative balances totaling ₱16,136,532.49, 

and a “For Reconciliation” status amounting to ₱149,225.95, as follows: 

  

Account Number of IAs Amount (₱) 

Negative/Abnormal Balance     

Due from NGAs 9  1,202,285.06 

Due from LGUs 10      288,498.22

Other Receivables 4 376.24 

Total   16,136,532.49 

For Reconciliation items  149,225.95 

 

Interview with the Chief Accountant of NEFCA and his staff disclosed 

that the incurrence of the negative balances was due to erroneous double 

recording of liquidations. 

 

Based on the analysis of the accounts provided by the Audit Team to the 

Chief Accountant, the accounting personnel will prepare the adjusting journal 

entry to correct the balances of the affected accounts. 



47 

c) Discrepancy of ₱33,767,609.04 between the accounting records and 
confirmation replies  

 

To determine the existence and accuracy of the account, confirmation 

letters were sent out to selected IAs.  Out of the 116 confirmation letters sent, 28 

replied. 

 

The results of confirmation is summarized below:

On the other hand, the Audit Team was unable to send confirmation to 139 

IAs due to the absence of records and documents and/or no available 

addresses/location on file. 

 

Inquiry from the Chief Accountant revealed that one of the reasons for the 

discrepancies might be due to the delayed recording of IAs’ liquidation in the 

books of NCCA since these are still to be scrutinized. 

  

The fairness of the presentation of the receivables account in the financial 

statements is affected by the noted deficiencies. 

 

d) Delayed submission of Contracts/Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) 
 

Review of records showed that 14 copies of contracts/MOAs executed 

during the year amounting to ₱15,925,000.00 were not submitted to the Auditor 

within the reglementary period, with delays ranging from two to 111 days, as

The delayed submission of contracts/MOAs, contrary to COA Circular 

No. 2009-001 precluded the Audit Team the timely review and evaluation of the 

terms embodied in the contract. Likewise, the convey of the results of audit to 

management are consequently delayed. 

 

COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009 states that: 

 

Within five (5) working days from the execution of a contract 

by the government or any of its subdivisions, agencies or 

instrumentalities, including government-owned and controlled 

corporations and their subsidiaries, a copy of said contract and 

each of all the documents forming part thereof by reference or 

incorporation shall be furnished to the Auditor of the agency 

concerned. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Chief 

Accountant to: 

 

a. send follow-up demand letters to concerned IAs and NGOs/POs with 
unliquidated fund transfers; 

 

b. exhaust all the possible measures to enforce the settlement of the 
outstanding accounts; 

 

c. if all measures are futile, request authority from the Commission on 
Audit to write-off dormant unliquidated fund transfers in strict 

compliance with the provisions of COA Circular No. 2016-005; 

 

d. conduct an in-depth analysis on the negative and the “For 
Reconciliation” amounts, and effect the necessary adjusting entries in 

the books of accounts; 

 

e. collaborate closely with the concerned IAs to resolve the discrepancy 
between their records and NCCA records, and adjust the affected 

accounts accordingly; and 

 

f. ensure the submission of contracts/agreement and similar document to 
the Auditor within the reglementary period to enable a timely review 

and evaluation. 

 

During the exit conference, Management informed the Audit Team that all 

subsequent contracts/MOAs entered into will be centralized through the 

Accreditation and Grants Processing Section (AGPS) for proper monitoring to 

avoid delays in providing copies thereof to the Office of the Auditor within the 

reglementary period.

Cash Advances (CAs) not liquidated within the prescribed period 

 

4. Various deficiencies, contrary to the provisions of COA Circular No. 97-002, 
were committed, such as (a) non-liquidation of CAs at the end of the year 

and the grant of additional CAs to Special Disbursing Officers (SDOs) with 

still unliquidated CAs, resulting in its accumulation to ₱1,639,929.21 at year-

end; (b) delay in the liquidation of CAs from 20 to 325 days; and (c) delay of 

refund of unutilized CAs aggregating ₱326,728.17; thus, making the CA 

susceptible to loss or misuse or theft, and the possibility of misplaced or lost 

supporting documents due to prolonged settlement. Moreover, (d) the 

expenses and assets for CY 2020 were understated and overstated by 

undetermined amount due to the non-submission of liquidation documents 

by the end of the year, affecting the fair presentation of the financial 

statements; and (e) the non-renewal/insufficiency of Fidelity Bond of SDOs. 

which deprives the agency of indemnification in case of loss of funds. 

 

The account Advances to SDOs is used to recognize the amount granted to 

agency’s accountable officers and employees for special purpose/time-bound 

undertakings to be liquidated within a specified period. 

 

COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 provides the following 

pertinent rules on cash advances: 

 

Section 4.1.2 No additional cash advances shall be allowed to 

any official or employee unless the previous cash advance 

given to him is first settled or a proper accounting thereof is 

made. 

 

Section 5.7 when a cash advance is no longer needed or has not 

been used for a period of two (2) months, it must be returned to 

or refunded immediately to the collecting officer. 

 

Section 5.8 All CAs shall be fully liquidated at the end of each 

year. Except for petty cash fund, the Accountable Officer shall 

refund any unexpected balance to the Cashier/Collecting 

Officer who will issue the necessary Official receipt. 

 

 

a) non-liquidation at the end of the year; Grant of additional CAs to SDOs with 
unliquidated CAs 

 

As at December 31, 2020, the unliquidated CAs that were granted to 

various SDOs out of the General Fund (GF) and NEFCA had accumulated to

₱394,152.50 and ₱1,245,776.71, respectively, or a total of ₱1,639,929.21, with

As seen from the preceding Table, various SDOs were continuously 

granted additional CAs despite non-liquidation of their previous CAs, contrary to 

Section 4.1.2 of COA Circular No. 97-002. Considering that said CAs were 

granted with specific purpose and were time-bound, the SDOs are obligated to 

submit liquidation documents as soon as the purpose of their CAs have been 

served (Section 4.1.3 of COA Circular 97-001). 

 

Moreover, to inculcate AOs of their responsibility, the Civil Service 

Commission (CSC) issued CSC Memorandum Circular (MC) No. 23 s.2019 on 

the revised guidelines on the settlement of cash advances and the penalty to be 

imposed for failure to liquidate within the prescribed period. Section 5.4 thereof 

states: 

An Accountable Officer shall be held liable for Gross Neglect 

of Duty and impose the penalty of dismissal from the service 

for the first offence in any of the following instances, to wit: 

 

a. the Accountable Officer who, after formal demand by the 
State Auditor or Audit Team Leader, fails to make any 

liquidation, whether partial or full, of the cash advances 

within the prescribed period stated in the formal demand 

letter. xxx

b) delay in the liquidation of CAs from 20 to 325 days;

c) delay of refund of unutilized CAs 
 

It was also verified from the accounting records that refund of excess CAs 

aggregating ₱326,728.17 was delayed; hence, the government was unable to 

utilized it for other purpose. The details are shown below:

Total       326,728.17 

 

It can be gleaned from the Tables above that there was no strict 

monitoring on the liquidation of cash advances. 

 

The longer the SDOs are unable to settle/liquidate their advances, the 

more the cash in their possession is at risk of loss or misuse or theft, and the 

possibility of misplaced or lost supporting documents. 

 

Moreover, inquiry revealed that there were instances that disbursement of 

cash advance was done by other than the SDO, exposing the fund to risk of 

possible loss, and contrary to the provisions of COA Circular 97-002, to wit: 

 

Section 4.1.6 Transfer of cash advance from one Accountable 

Officer (AO) to another shall not be allowed 
 

 

d) expenses and assets for CY 2020 was understated and overstated by 
undetermined amount 

 

Further review of the CAs showed that based on the purpose and date 

indicated in the CAs, the following activities have already been completed as of 

CY 2020, however, due to the non-submission of liquidation documents as at the 

end of the year, expenditures were not recorded, thereby, resulting in the 



56 

understatement of expenses and overstatement of the corresponding advances by 

undetermined amount.

The above conditions also reflect laxity in the monitoring and enforcement 

of regulations on the grant, utilization and liquidation of CAs.  Delays in the 

submission of liquidation reports signify poor internal control system where an 

adequate one could prevent possible loss and/or misappropriation.  

 

  

e) Non-renewal and insufficient Fidelity Bond 
 

Items No. 4.1 and 4.8 of BTr Circular No. 02-2009 dated August 6, 2009 

provides that: 

 

4.1 Every officer, agent, and employee of the Government of 

the Philippines whose duties require the possession, custody or 

control of local government funds and properties shall be 

properly bonded. 

 

4.8 x x x Fidelity Fund shall be available for the purpose of 

replacing defalcation, shortages, unrelieved losses in the 

accounts of bonded public officers, for the payment of fees and 

costs incident to civil proceedings brought against them to 

recover sums paid on their account from said Fund. 

 

Verification of Fidelity Bonds revealed instances where the Bond is 

insufficient to cover the cash accountability of an SDO, as shown below.

The grant of CA to unbonded AOs and/or beyond their maximum cash 

accountability would deprive the agency of indemnification in case of loss or 

misuse of funds. It also violates Section 101(2) of PD No. 1445 which states that 

every accountable officer shall be properly bonded in accordance with law. 

 

It is noted that during the 1st quarter of CY 2021, a total of ₱866,730.12 

out of the ₱1,639,929.21 was liquidated by the SDOs. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a. instruct the SDOs to liquidate their CAs within the prescribed period 
and at the end of the year to ensure proper recording of all expenses in 

the year they are incurred; 

 

b. direct the Accountant and all concerned officials to strictly enforce the 
provisions of COA Circular No. 97-002 and the PD No. 1445 pertaining 

to the grant, utilization and liquidation of cash advances; and 

 

c. direct all accountable officers to strictly comply with the provisions of 
BTr Circular No. 02-2009 on the Fidelity Bond. 

 

 

Erroneous recording of advanced payment of rental  

 

5. Advance payment for the rental of exhibition space of Philippine Pavilion in 
Venice, Italy amounting to ₱10,528,843.70 was erroneously recorded as 

expense under Subsidies-Others account instead of Prepaid Rent, as 

prescribed in the Revised Chart of Accounts (RCA) (Updated 2019), Volume 

III of the GAM, resulting in the overstatement of expenses and 

understatement of prepayments by the same amount. 

 

Audit of the expense account Subsidies-Others showed that it included 

rental expense amounting to ₱10,528,843.70, which pertained to the exhibition 

space rental of Philippine Pavilion in Venice, Italy. 



59 

 The RCA (Updated 2019), Volume III of the GAM describes the account 

Prepaid Rent as used to recognize the amount advanced/deposited for lease/rentals 

of property, plant and equipment used in government operations. While the 

account Subsidies-Others is described as used to recognize the financial assistance 

given to individuals and institutions other than government agencies or 

NGOs/POs for government programs/projects/activities.  

  

On February 3, 2020, the NCCA issued LBP Check no. 2379637 in the 

amount ₱10,528,843.70 to LBP-Intramuros Branch for the account of La 

Fondazione La Biennale Di Venezia (La Biennale) for the rental payment of the 

exhibition space of the Philippine Pavilion inside the Artiglierie of the Arsenale in 

Venice, Italy. 

 

The rented space was in connection with the Philippine participation at the 

17th Venice Architecture Biennale 2020, which shall be held in May 23-

November 29, 2020 with preview on May 21-22, 2020. 

 

However, due to the global pandemic, the exhibit was moved to August 

29-November 29, 2020. On June 1, 2020, the La Biennale announced that the 17th 

Venice Architecture Biennale 2020 Exhibition has again been rescheduled to May 

22, 2021-November 21, 2021. 

 

Further, the head of the NCCA-Philippine Arts of Venice Biennale 

(PAVB) confirmed that since the event was indeed postponed, the amount paid in 

February 3, 2020 for the rent of the exhibition space shall be applied in CY 2021. 

 

 Examination of accounting records, however, disclosed that the said 

advance payment for the rental of exhibition space, under JEV No. 03-2020-02-

0091 on February 3, 2020, was taken up in the books as an outright expense under 

Subsidies-Others account instead of Prepaid Rent account, in non-conformance 

with the RCA (Updated 2019). 

 

The noted deficiency resulted in the overstatement of Subsidies-Others 

account by ₱10,528,843.70 and the understatement of the accounts Prepaid Rent 

by the same amount, thereby affecting the fair presentation of the financial 

statements. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Chief 

Accountant to draw the necessary Journal Entry Voucher (JEV) to correct 

the erroneous entry.

B. Compliance Audit 
 

Non- inclusion of the required TOR in the MOAs and failure to require a 20 percent 

equity 

 

6. The non-compliance with the conditions cited under Section 4.5.3 of COA 
Circular No. 2007-001 - on the incorporation of necessary Terms of 

Reference (TORs) in the MOA and Section 4.5.4 - on the requirement for 

NGOs/POs to sustain equity equivalent to 20 percent of total project cost, 

manifested an inadequacy on the part of NCCA to properly administer the 

funds intended to assist NGOs/POs and to monitor the projects’ 

implementation, which eventually could lead to loss of government funds.  

Likewise, the perfection of a MOA during or after a project implementation 

may likely result in the inclusion, as part of project cost, of expenditures and 

activities, which are not covered by the contract. 
 

NCCA was created, among other functions, to formulate policies for the 

development of culture and arts; implement these policies in coordination with 

affiliated cultural agencies; coordinate the implementation of programs of these 

affiliated agencies; and administer the NEFCA through giving grants for the 

development, protection, preservation and dissemination of Philippine culture and 

the arts. 

 

Through the NEFCA, the NCCA provides assistance to Civil Society 

Organizations (CSOs), People’s Organizations (POs), Indigenous People 

Organizations (IPOs), Individuals, Local Government Units (LGUs), Government 

Agencies (Gas), State Universities/ Colleges and Public Schools through its 

NCCA Grants Program, and Institutional Programs such as Outreach Program, 

Resource Persons and Experts Bureau Program, and the Technical Assistance 

Program. 

 

Section 4.5.3 of COA Circular No. 2007-001 – The Revised Guidelines in 

the Granting, Utilization, Accounting and Auditing of the Funds released to 

NGOs/POs - states that the government organization shall award the project to the 

NGO/PO, and the project shall be covered by a MOA which shall embody TORs 

such as: 

  

x x x 

f. In case of construction projects like school buildings, 
housing, and other similar structures, and acquisition of 

assets like vehicles and equipment, a stipulation of ownership 

or turnover of ownership of the infrastructure or fixed asset. 

In the procurement of any type of asset out of the 

government funds, the NGO/PO shall conduct simple 



61 

bidding or canvass to ensure the best terms and quality of 

purchase; 

g. In case the asset shall be owned by a specified beneficiary, 
a stipulation that a Deed of Donation shall be executed by 

the GO therefor; 

x x x 

 

k. In case of the dissolution of a recipient NGO/PO, voluntary 

of involuntary, the lien of the granting GO on its assets, in 

accordance with existing laws, to the extent of the 

unexpended or unutilized potion of the fund; 

l.    Maintenance by the NGO/PO of a separate savings account 

for each fund received from the GO; 

x x x 

 

Section 4.5.4 requires the NGO/PO to have an equity equivalent to 20 

percent of the total project cost, which may be in the form of labor, land for the 

project site, facilities, equipment and the like, to be used in the project. 

 

The terms provided in the MOA bind the parties to a common purpose; 

hence, it is imperative for NCCA and the various NGOs/POs to integrate all the 

essential TORs in the MOA. 

 

 For CY 2019, NCCA appropriated a total of ₱61,450,000.00 for projects 

with amounts of ₱10M and above, chargeable to NEFCA, as financial assistance 

to grantee NGOs/POs as approved by the Board of Commissioners. The 

₱61,450,000.00 was appropriated for the following projects:

Competitive grant is an open call for those qualified as prescribed by the 

NCCA. The grants are in accordance with the defined priority of NCCA and of 

the different national committees of the Commission, while Institutional programs 

are the programs and activities implemented by the NCCA or by the affiliated 



62 

cultural and government agencies outside the competitive grants in order to 

address concerns that cannot be possible covered by grants. This includes those 

with directives or presidential proclamations, laws and resolutions. 

 

 Review of the MOAs entered into by and between the NCCA and the 

abovementioned NGOs/POs during CY 2019 revealed that some of the required 

TORs were not stipulated therein; hence, did not conform with Section 4.5.3 of 

the COA Circular, showing an inadequacy on the part of NCCA to properly 

administer the funds intended to assist NGOs/POs and to monitor the projects’ 

implementation. Below is the summary of the terms of references not embodied in 

the MOAs:

PETA Not complied Not complied Not complied Not complied 

TPLI Not complied Not complied Not complied Not complied

 In addition, one of the requisites for NGOs/POs’ entitlement of 

government funds is their financial reports, which must show a stable financial 

condition, and that the funds provided by the agency shall not be the NGOs/POs’ 

sole source of funds. 

 

 However, verification of the MOAs and the supporting financial reports 

revealed a low percentage of equity/counterpart by the NGOs/POs in the 

implementation of projects or none at all, contradicting the mandatory 

requirement prescribed by the Circular, to wit:

10,175,334.84   

  

 The total required equity for the five projects should be ₱12,290,000.00, 

however, the NGOs/POs counterpart amounted to only ₱2,114,665.16. It showed 

that NCCA failed to require the equity equivalent to 20 percent of the total project 



63 

cost before the granting or release of funds/financial assistance, which eventually 

could lead to loss of government funds. 

 

 It is likewise noteworthy to mention that in the respective MOAs, the 

durations and dates of project implementation were earlier than the dates when the 

MOAs were actually notarized and signed by the parties; hence, expenditures and 

activities before the perfection of the contract are likely to be included as part of 

the project cost, which would be highly irregular. 

  

 We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a. advise the Accreditation and Grants Processing Section to strictly 
comply with the provisions of Sections 4.5.3 and 4.5.4 of COA Circular 

No. 2007-001; and 

b. advise the MANCOM to ensure that the project duration and 
implementation embodied in the MOA are dated after the contracts are 

perfected. 
 

 Management acknowledged the recommendation on the strict adherence to 

the provisions of Section 4.5.3 on the inclusion of all the necessary terms of 

reference in the MOA entered into by and between NCCA and NGOs/POs. 

 

 They informed that on October 22, 2019, the Chief Accountant issued 

Memorandum MM-NEFCA-2019-10-002 addressed to the head of Accreditation 

and Grants Processing Section requesting the latter to consider in the preparation 

of MOAs for Competitive Grants and Institution projects, particularly those 

entered unto with substantial amount, all the necessary terms of reference 

enumerated in the abovementioned section of COA Circular No. 2007-001. 

 

 They further asserted that since the required 20 percent equity was not 

complied as provided under Section 4.5.4, the Chief Accountant recommended 

that for the meantime, they will take over and oversee the implementation of the 

project and carry out activities as required in the project proposal, which includes 

directly paying its suppliers/ creditors. 

 

 Moreover, the MANCOM agreed that only the date of implementation 

will be reflected in the MOA and no projects will be implemented/to be 

commenced without the complete execution of a notarized MOA. 

 

 During the exit conference, they informed the Audit Team that they will 

discuss with the proponents on how to impute the required equity in order to 

properly present it in the Fund Utilization Reports (FURs). Likewise, they will 

advise the concerned NGOs/POs to return the MOAs as soon as signed to avoid 

conflict with the date of implementation of the project. A workshop shall also be 

conducted to correct the audit deficiencies noted. 



64 

Inadequate monitoring resulted in double payment of the cash assistance 

 

7. CAs for the payment of cash assistance to individuals under the “Arts 
Program for Cultural Workers and Artists under the State of Calamity” in 

the total amount of ₱49,548,752.74 were (a) granted to 16 designated SDOs 

but disbursed by six personnel who were under Contract of Service (COS). 

Likewise, cash assistance was (b) paid to 67 beneficiaries who already either 

received the same benefit from another government agency or from the 

NCCA. 
 

During the year, upon the direction of the NCCA Board of 

Commissioners, each Sub-Commissions/National Committees issued its 

respective undated guidelines that would govern the assistance program for 

cultural workers and artists under the state of calamity. 

 

Under the said guidelines, the mode of disbursement in implementing said 

program is thru cash advance. 

 

For CY 2020, the cash assistance and administrative expenses amounting 

to ₱48,312,025.79 and ₱1,236,726.95, respectively, were paid to 10,284 

beneficiaries, broken down as follows (See Annex C for details):

Verification, however, of the grant of the cash assistance disclosed 

deficiencies, as discussed below: 

 

 

a) Transfer of accountability from one accountable officer to a COS personnel  
 

Section 4.1.6 of COA Circular No. 97-002 provides that the transfer of CA 

from one Accountable Officer (AO) to another shall not be allowed, while Section 

4.1.4 provides that only permanently appointed officials shall be designated as 

disbursing officers. 

 

Under the NCCA’s “Guidelines on the NCCA Assistance Program for 

Cultural Workers and Artists under the State of Calamity”, it provides that 

NCCA’s Finance Units (NEFCA/GAA, Budget, and Cashier) shall facilitate the 

disbursement of the financial assistance, which may be sent to the beneficiaries by 

any of the available means such as bank deposit, GCash, or through remittance 

centers (Palawan Express, MLhuillier, Cebuana Lhuiller, etc.). 

 

On April 24, 2020, the NCCA issued Office No. OO-OED-2020-004-058

Also, on May 14 and June 25, 2020, the NCCA issued an authority to 

Accountant III to transact with the three branches of Palawan remittance services, 

namely: Del Pan, Tondo Branch, Moriones, Tondo Branch, and Intramuros, 

Manila Branch. 

 

Verification of the DVs and its corresponding liquidation reports disclosed 

that the 13 designated SDOs transferred their accountability to 6 COS personnel. 

 

The transfer of accountability itself was contrary to Section 4.1.6 and 

transfer to a COS personnel was contrary to Section 4.1.4 of COA Circular No. 

97-002. Such actions exposed the government to non-indemnification in case of 

loss, misuse or theft of the fund. 

 

b) Payment of cash assistance to 50 beneficiaries who already received 
assistance from another government agency 

 

On April 27, 2020, a Memorandum from the Office of the Executive 

Secretary of the Philippines authorized NCCA to give a one-time grant of 

financial assistance in the amount of P5,000.00 to each qualified beneficiary 

under the Program for Cultural Workers and Artists under the State of Calamity 

in light of the Covid-19 Outbreak in the Country. 

 

In addition, Item No. 2 of the said Memorandum requires that the NCCA 

shall coordinate with the Department of Labor and Employment, and other 

relevant government agencies in the determination of the final list of qualified 

beneficiaries to prevent duplication in the grant of assistance from the existing 

Social Amelioration Programs per Joint Memorandum Circular No. 01, series of 

2020. (emphasis ours) 

 

Confirmation with the Film Development Council of the Philippines 

(FDCP) disclosed that a one-time financial assistance of ₱5,000.00 under the 

Disaster/Emergency Assistance and Relief (DEAR) Program was granted to 

various movie workers and artists. From its website, it was noted that cash 

assistance in the total amount of ₱250,000.00 was granted to 50 beneficiaries who 

were also NCCA’s beneficiaries, to wit:

c) Double payment of the cash assistance to NCCA’s beneficiaries 
 

We likewise noted that there was double payment of the cash incentives to 

17 NCCA qualified beneficiaries, as shown below:

Beneficiaries

(SCA)/ Subcommission on

Arts (SCCTA) 

2 6,000.00 

TUPAD 3 35,000.00 

Total 17 160,000.00 

 

Interview with the Chief Accountant revealed that to avoid double 

payments, the submitted names went through the Management Information 

System Section (MIS) to ensure that these beneficiaries are not covered in any 

assistance given by other government agencies. 

 

However, it is apparent that the MIS failed, which resulted in double 

payment of cash assistance totaling ₱160,000.00. 

 

d) Incomplete supporting documents 
 

Section 4(6) of the PD No. 1445 requires that claims against government 

funds shall be supported with complete documentation. 

 

Verification of the submitted documents pertaining to the payment of cash 

assistance revealed that under the respective guidelines of each Sub-

Commissions/National Committee revealed that the liquidation of the CAs is to 

be supported with the duly signed “Declaration as non-recipient of other COVID-

19-related cash assistance programs of the government”. 



68 

Likewise, the following supporting documents, which are required in 

order to avail the cash assistance, shall be attached: 

 

1) Application form duly signed by the grantee; 
2) Duly signed “Declaration as non-recipient of other COVID-19-

related cash assistance programs of the government”; 

3) Any proof or other document showing that: 
a. artists and cultural workers are not under an employer-

employee relationship; 

b. artists and cultural workers are without regular income or 
are working freelance; and 

c. their source of income is gone due to COVID-19 crisis 
during ECQ; and 

4) Acknowledgment of cash assistance received. 
 

Review of the liquidation reports (LRs) disclosed that all payments for 

cash assistance totaling ₱48,312,025.79 lacked the required supporting document, 

which indicated lapses on the part of the Chief Accountant in verifying the 

completeness of the supporting documents before recording in the books; thus, 

casts doubt on the validity and propriety of the disbursement. 

 

Furthermore, the Audit Team observed that 36 LRs and/or Report of Cash 

Disbursements (RCDisb) were not duly signed by the designated SDO and/or 

Head of Accounting Division to ascertain the correctness and completeness of the 

supporting documents. Moreover, the RCDisb used was not in accordance with 

Appendix 41, Volume II of the GAM where the forms and instructions are 

prescribed. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed: 

 

a. to instruct the Chief Accountant to only allow permanently appointed 
officials who are bonded to handle disbursements of funds; 

 

b. to instruct the Chief Accountant to demand from SDOs the complete 
and proper documents to support the claims/liquidation before 

recording in the books; 

 

c. to discontinue the practice of transfer of accountability, in strict 
compliance with COA Circular 97-002; and 

 

d. to instruct the Administrative Division to send demand letters to the 
concerned individuals for the refund of the cash assistance given to 

them. 

 



69 

The Management instructed the Committee Heads to conduct a 

verification with the DSWD, DOLE, FDCP, and other government agencies; and 

ask refund from concerned grantees if found they have been paid twice.

Implementation of Gender and Development (GAD) Plans and Budget  

 

11. Only three out of nine Programs, Activities and Projects (PAPs) were 
implemented during the year due to the COVID-19 pandemic; thus, limiting 

the benefits that the public and the intended users/beneficiaries derived 

therefrom.  

 

Section 31 of the General Provisions (GP) of RA No. 11465 or the 

General Appropriations Act (GAA) for FY 2020, requires that: 

 
All agencies of the government shall formulate a GAD Plan  

designed  to  address  gender  issues  within their concerned  

sectors  or  mandate  and  implement applicable provisions 

under R.A. 9170 or the Magna Carta of Women, Convention 

on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against 

Women, the Beijing Platform  for  Action,  the  Millennium  

Development Goals  (2000-2015),  the Philippine Plan for 



73 

Gender- Responsive Development, (1995-2025), and the 

Philippine Development Plan. The GAD plan shall be 

integrated in the regular activities of the agencies, which shall 

be at least five percent (5%) of their   respective   budgets.   

For   this   purpose.   xxx activities that contribute to poverty 

alleviation, economic empowerment xxx are considered 

sufficient compliance with said requirement.  Utilization of 

the GAD budget shall be evaluated based on the GAD 

performance indicators identified by the said agency. 

 

PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01 prescribed the guidelines 

and procedures for the formulation, development, submission, implementation, 

monitoring and evaluation including accounting of results of agency annual GPB 

and GAD accomplishment reports (AR).   

 

Paragraph 2.3 thereof requires that “x x x GAD Planning shall be 

integrated in the regular activities of the agencies, the cost of implementation of 

which shall be at least five (5%) of their total budgets xxx. 

 

Section 1.5 of the PCW Memorandum Circular 2016-05 dated 30 

September 2016 states that “Aside from implementing direct GAD PAPs to 

address organization- or client-focused gender issues or GAD mandates, agencies 

may attribute a portion or the whole budget/expenditure of the agency’s major 

program/s or project/s to the GAD budget/expenditure using the Harmonized 

Gender and Development Guidelines (HGDG) tool. Major programs/projects 

subjected to the HGDG test shall be reflected under the GPB/GAD AR section on 

"ATTRIBUTED PROGRAM”. 

 

Further, Section 6.4 of the Joint Circular provides the guidelines in 

utilizing the attribution of major programs of an agency to the GAD program and 

the corresponding computation on the percentage of the budget for the ‘attributed 

programs’ which might be attributed to the GAD Budget and the GAD 

Accomplishment Report, depending on its HGDG scores. 

 

For FY 2020, the agency had allocated the amount of ₱36,650,000.00 for 

the implementation of nine GAD programs/activities; however, only the amount 

of ₱249,417.00 or .68 percent was utilized due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 

related GAD accomplishment report showed that only three out of the nine 

programmed activities were undertaken during the year, as shown in the Schedule 

of Accomplished PAPs on the next page:

Based on the preceding Table, the low percentage of accomplishment on 

the implementation of the proposed PAPs indicated that Management was unable 

to address the gender issues included in the FY 2020 GPB, thereby, limiting the 

benefits that the intended beneficiaries derived from GAD PAPs such as poverty 

alleviation, economic empowerment of women, protection and promotion of 

women’s human rights and resolution of other gender issues. 

 
It was informed that the non-implementation of all the PAPs was due to 

the COVID-19 pandemic. 

 

Further, the Audit Team noted that the agency’s 2020 GAD Plan and 

Budget was not approved and endorsed by the PCW contrary to the above-cited 

provision of PCW-NEDA-DBM JC No. 2012. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a. formulate effective monitoring system/process to ensure 
implementation of all identified PAPs so that the intended beneficiaries 

shall enjoy benefits derived therefrom; and 

 

b. strengthen coordination with PCW for the approval of its GAD’s Plan. 
 

 

Programs and Projects related to Senior Citizens and Persons with Disability 

 

12. The NCCA was not able to formulate any plans and programs/projects for Senior 
Citizens and PWDs in conformity with Section 32 of the GP of RA No. 11465 or 

the GAA for FY 2020 due to Covid-19 pandemic. 

 

 

 

 

 



75 

Disaster Risk Reduction and Management and Climate Change Adaption and 

Mitigation 

 

13. In compliance with Section 36 of the GP of the GAA of FY 2020 and in response 
to the Covid-19 pandemic, the NCCA during the year, conducted a nationwide 

“Rapid Assessment on the Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic to the Culture Sector" 

(July to September) thru the conduct of the following research methodologies: 

 

1) Conduct of FGDs; 
 

2) Online Survey for private and government institutions; individual 
practitioners; culture and arts practitioners and non-practitioners; and 

 

3) Key Informants Interview. 
 

The said study was presented during the regional consultations and 

planning workshop for the 4-island clusters (NCR-November 27-28; Visayas- 

December 2-3; Luzon- December 10-11; and Mindanao- December 14-15). 

 

 

Compliance with Tax Laws  

 

14. Total taxes withheld from the salaries of employees and purchases of goods and 
services from January to December 2020 amounted to ₱18,976,810.26. The 

amount of ₱14,684,422.03 was remitted to BIR during the year and a total of 

₱4,292,388.23 was remitted in January 2021 including the taxes withheld for the 

month of ₱79,793.23. 

 

 

General Insurance of Government Properties (RA No. 656) 

 

15. NCCA insured all its properties with the General Insurance Fund (GIF) of the 
Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) as required under COA Circular 

No. 92-390 dated November 17, 1992. In CY 2020, NCCA paid insurance 

premium of ₱3,108,365.13, consisting of prepaid insurance of ₱1,200,110.54 and 

insurance expense of ₱1,908,860.84. The difference of ₱606.25 is subject to 

reconciliation. 

 

 

Compliance with PagIBIG Premium Deduction (RA No. 9679) 
 

16. NCCA complied with the requirement to withhold and remit amounts due to Pag-
IBIG on or before the 10th day of the succeeding month. For CY 2020, the agency 

remitted to Pag-IBIG a total of ₱1,185,593.27.

The decrease in fund utilization rate was attributed to Management’s 

failure to implement the 12 projects/activities planned in CY 2020 due to the 

COVID-19 pandemic of which coordination with the concerned implementing 

agencies and/or LGUs was limited. 

 

 

b) NEFCA-Approved Projects

The low utilization of NEFCA Project Fund was attributed to 

Management’s non and/or partial implementation of the 123 programs and 

projects totaling ₱124,606,372.27 due to COVID-19 Pandemic which suspended 

the local and international travels, closure of cultural institutions and restrictions 

in movement and the conduct of various face to face social gatherings. Also, the 

68 cancelled projects on Competitive Grants totaling ₱16,034,740.00, of which 23 

or ₱5,840,840.00 were re-designed/reprogrammed to new projects. Likewise, the
