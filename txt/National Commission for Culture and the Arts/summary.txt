EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 

A. Introduction 
 

In 1987, then President Corazon C. Aquino penned Executive Order (EO) No. 

118 creating the Presidential Commission on Culture and Arts. Five years later, in 

1992, this presidential directive was enacted into law– Republic Act (RA) No. 7356, 

creating the National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA).  The NCCA is 

the overall policy making body, coordinating, and grants-giving agency for the 

preservation, development and promotion of Philippine arts and culture; an executing 

agency for the policies it formulates; and task to administering the National 

Endowment Fund for Culture and the Arts (NEFCA) — fund exclusively for the 

implementation of culture and arts programs and projects. 

The government’s support for cultural development is particularly highlighted 

by the passage of RA No. 7356 that created the NCCA. The coordination among the 

cultural agencies was strengthened by the virtue of EO No. 80, which placed the 

Cultural Center of the Philippines, the National Historical Commission of the 

Philippines, the National Museum, the National Library of the Philippines and the 

National Archives of the Philippines under the NCCA umbrella. Further, through RA 

No. 9155, administratively included was the Commission on the Filipino Language.  

The NCCA was created to serve as the presidential inter-agency commission to 

coordinate cultural policies and programs. 

The NCCA operates through a 15-member Board of Commissioners headed 

by a Chairman who is elected from among its members. The Chairman, Arsenio J. 

Lizaso, is assisted by an Executive Director who handles the daily operations of the 

agency. As of December 31, 2020, NCCA had a total manpower of 218 consisting of 

32 permanent, 16 contractual, eight casual, 46 contract of service, nine job order and 

107 project-hired personnel.

D. Scope of Audit 
 

The audit covered the accounts and operations of the NCCA for CY 2020. The 

audit was conducted to: a) ascertain the level of assurance that may be placed on the 

Management’s assertion on the financial statements; b) determine the propriety of 

transactions as well as extent of compliance on the applicable laws, rules and 

regulations; c) recommend agency’s improvement opportunities; and d) determine 

the extent of implementation of prior year’s audit recommendations. Moreover, the 

audit was conducted in accordance with International Standards of Supreme Audit 

Institutions (ISSAIs). 

 

E. Independent Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements 
 

The auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of the presentation of 

the Financial Statements (FSs) of NCCA as at December 31, 2020 due to the 

observations: 

 

1. Funds held in trust by the BTr are recorded in NCCA books of accounts at fair 
market value (FMV) of ₱1,969,663,013.08 instead of at amortized cost 

of ₱1,883,456,125.56, thereby overstating its receivable Due from NGAs (BTr) 

and erroneously recognizing a gain Unrealized Gain (Loss) both 



iv 
 

by ₱86,206,887.52, in non-conformity with Sections 7 and 8, Chapter 7, Volume 

I of the GAM. (Paragraph No. 2) 

 

2. Abnormal/negative balances of Inter-Agency Receivables amounting to 
₱16,136,156.25. (Paragraph No. 3) 

 

3. Advance payment for the rental of exhibition space of Philippine Pavilion in 
Venice, Italy amounting to ₱10,528,843.70 was erroneously recorded as expense 

under Subsidies-Others account instead of Prepaid Rent, as prescribed in the 

Revised Chart of Accounts (RCA) (Updated 2019), Volume III of the GAM, 

resulting in the overstatement of expenses and understatement of prepayments by 

the same amount. (Paragraph No. 5) 

 

 

F. Significant Observations and Recommendations 
 

The following are the other significant audit observations and corresponding 

recommendations, which were discussed with Management officials concerned 

during the exit conference on April 22, 2021, the details of which are further 

discussed in Part II of this report. Management views and comments were 

incorporated in the report, where appropriate. 

 

1. The absence of regular and periodic monitoring and reconciliation with BTr of 
the agency’s Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, Special Account of 

₱766,912,239.65, coupled with BTr’s lack of confirmatory reply, casted doubt on 

the completeness and accuracy of the recorded transactions; hence, could not be 

relied upon. 

 

We reiterated our recommendation and Management agreed to require the Chief 

Accountant to coordinate with the BTr for the expedition of the reconciliation of 

the Cash- Treasury/Agency, Special Account to establish its correct balance. 

 

2. Unliquidated fund transfers to various government agencies totaling 
₱12,929,702.42 that has been (a) dormant for more than ten years, and (b) 

negative balances of ₱16,136,532.49 formed part of the Receivables with a 

balance of ₱3,300,201,622.05 as at December 21, 2020, rendering the account 

unreliable.  Moreover, the (c) variance of ₱33,767,609.04 between the accounting 

records and confirmation replies aggravated the account’s unreliability, in 

addition to the (d) delayed submission to the Office of the Auditor of 

contracts/MOAs covering the fund transfers during the year, precluding their 

timely review and evaluation. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Chief Accountant to: 

 

a) send follow-up demand letters to concerned IAs and NGOs/POs with 
unliquidated fund transfers; 



v 
 

 

b) exhaust all the possible measures to enforce the settlement of the 
outstanding accounts; 

 

c) if all measures are futile, request authority from the Commission on Audit to 
write-off dormant unliquidated fund transfers in strict compliance with the 

provisions of COA Circular No. 2016-005; 

 

d) conduct an in-depth analysis on the negative and the “For Reconciliation” 
amounts, and effect the necessary adjusting entries in the books of accounts; 

 

e) collaborate closely with the concerned IAs to resolve the discrepancy 
between their records and NCCA records, and adjust the affected accounts 
accordingly; and 

 

f) ensure the submission of contracts/agreement and similar document to the 
Auditor within the reglementary period to enable a timely review and 

evaluation. 

 

3. Various deficiencies, contrary to the provisions of COA Circular No. 97-002, 
were committed, such as (a) non-liquidation of CAs at the end of the year and the 

grant of additional CAs to Special Disbursing Officers (SDOs) with still 

unliquidated CAs, resulting in its accumulation to ₱1,639,929.21 at year-end; (b) 

delay in the liquidation of CAs from 20 to 325 days; and (c) delay of refund of 

unutilized CAs aggregating ₱326,728.17; thus, making the CA susceptible to loss 

or misuse or theft, and the possibility of misplaced or lost supporting documents 

due to prolonged settlement. Moreover, (d) the expenses and assets for CY 2020 

were understated and overstated by undetermined amount due to the non-

submission of liquidation documents by the end of the year, affecting the fair 

presentation of the financial statements; and (e) the non-renewal/insufficiency of 

Fidelity Bond of SDOs. which deprives the agency of indemnification in case of 

loss of funds. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a. instruct the SDOs to liquidate their CAs within the prescribed period, and at 
year-end to ensure proper recording of all expenses when they are incurred; 

 

b. direct the Accountant and all concerned officials to strictly enforce the 
provisions of COA Circular No. 97-002 and the PD No. 1445 pertaining to 

the grant, utilization and liquidation of cash advances; and 

 

c. direct all accountable officers to strictly comply with the provisions of BTr 
Circular No. 02-2009 on the Fidelity Bond. 

 

4. The non-compliance with the conditions cited under Section 4.5.3 of COA 
Circular No. 2007-001 - on the incorporation of necessary Terms of Reference 



vi 
 

(TORs) in the MOA and Section 4.5.4 - on the requirement for NGOs/POs to 

sustain equity equivalent to 20 percent of total project cost, manifested an 

inadequacy on the part of NCCA to properly administer the funds intended to 

assist NGOs/POs and to monitor the projects’ implementation, which eventually 

could lead to loss of government funds.  Likewise, the perfection of a MOA 

during or after a project implementation may likely result in the inclusion, as part 

of project cost, of expenditures and activities, which are not covered by the 

contract. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a. advise the Accreditation and Grants Processing Section to strictly comply 
with Sections 4.5.3 and 4.5.4 of COA Circular No. 2007-001; and 

 

b. advise the MANCOM to ensure that project duration and implementation 
embodied in the MOA are dated after the contracts are perfected. 

 

5. CAs for the payment of cash assistance to individuals under the “Arts Program 
for Cultural Workers and Artists under the State of Calamity” in the total amount 

of ₱49,548,752.74 were (a) granted to 16 designated SDOs but disbursed by six 

personnel who were under Contract of Service (COS). Likewise, cash assistance 

was (b) paid to 67 beneficiaries who already either received the same benefit 

from another government agency or from the NCCA. 

 

We recommended that Management instruct: 

 

a.  the Chief Accountant to apply the corresponding fidelity bond to all 
accountable officers and stop the practice of transferring funds from one 

accountable officer to another. 

 

b.  the Administrative Division to send demand letters to the concerned 
individuals for the refund of the cash assistance given to them. 

 

c.  the Chief Accountant to provide complete and proper documents to support 
the claims/liquidation before recording in the books. 

 

G. Status of Audit Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges 
 

The Statement of Audit Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges (SASDC) as 

of December 31, 2020, showed a balance of ₱45,000.00. This amount pertained to 

prior year’s balance which were settled on January 27, 2021 and February 02, 2021, 

amounting to ₱25,000.00 and ₱20,000.00, respectively.
