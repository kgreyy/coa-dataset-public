A)	Introduction



Republic Act (R.A.) No. 8406 entitled “An Act Reorganizing and Strenghtening the Public Attorney’s Office (PAO)” established the PAO as an independent and autonomous Office attached to the Department of Justice (DOJ) only for the purpose of policy and program coordination.  The law expanded the mandate of PAO to include providing free legal services and assistance to indigent clients, other qualified persons, and in the exigency of the service, when called upon by proper government authorities, to render such service to other persons, subject to existing laws, rules and regulations, in all criminal, civil, labor, administrative and other quasi-judicial cases.



	PAO is headed by Chief Public Attorney, Persida V. Rueda-Acosta.  She is assisted by two Deputy Chief Public Attorneys (DCPAs):  Atty. Silvestre A. Mosing,  for Visayas and Mindanao and Atty. Anna Lisa Soriano  for Luzon, who both act on administrative, financial, planning and management functions.



PAO Central Office (CO) is located at the DOJ Agencies Building, NIA Road, corner East Avenue, Diliman, Quezon City. The 345 regional and district/sub-district offices are strategically located nationwide to effectively respond to indigent clients from 17 regions, 81 provinces, 146 cities, 1,488 municipalities and 42,046 barangays, all of which are in dire need of legal assistance.  The number of existing offices and assigned 2,287 lawyers in each region is shown below:

D)	Independent Auditor’s Report



The Auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the financial statements (FS) as at December 31, 2020 due to accounting errors and omissions which represents 1.64 percent of the Expenditures as shown in the Matrix of Analysis on the Effects of Misstatements on the FS (Annex A). 







E)	Summary of Audit Observations and Recommendation



1)	The accuracy of the Cash in Bank – Local Currency Current Account, Regular Account with a zero balance as at December 31, 2020 could not be determined due to: a) non-submission of Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS); and b) non-maintenance of subsidiary ledgers (SLs) as required under Section 122 of PD 1445 and Sections 3 and 5, Chapter 21 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) Vol. 1. (Observation No. 1)



We recommended and Management agreed to: a) immediately prepare and submit the BRS for payroll account to the Office of Auditor and henceforth, observe the prescribed period of  submission of the monthly BRS pursuant to Sections 122 of PD 1445 and Sections 3 and 5, Chapter 21 of GAM Vol. 1 to avoid sanctions stated in Section 122.2 of PD 1445; and b) maintain SL for the cash in bank –payroll account to ensure proper monitoring and submit to COA together with other monthly reports, if required.



2)	Liquidation of Advances to Officers and Employees account totaling ₱53,936,047.94 was erroneously recorded in the books which resulted in the overstatements of Basic Salary – Civilian and understatements of various affected accounts contrary to Section 7, Chapter 19 of the GAM Volume I. (Observation No. 2)



We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief Accountant to adjust the erroneous recording in the books of accounts to reflect the actual disbursements in the Financial Statements.



3)	The reliability, accuracy and existence of Inventory Held for Consumption account balance totaling ₱30,001,871.25 as at December 31, 2020 cannot be ascertained due to: a) unreconciled balances of Inventory accounts among the general ledger, subsidiary ledger and the Report on the Physical Count of Inventory (RPCI);                b) misclassification of some inventory items totaling ₱107,615.33 which resulted in either overstatement or understatement of the affected accounts contrary to the GAM Volume III; and c) recognition of inventories in the books despite non-delivery of the same as of December 31, 2020 contrary to Section 88 (1) of PD No. 1445. Moreover, Purchase Orders (POs) were not properly accomplished contrary to the instructions in Appendix 61 of the GAM Vol. II. (Observation No. 3)



We recommended that Management: a) require the Chief Accountant to see to it that inventory balances in the financial statements, GL and SL are tallied at any given time through conduct of regular reconciliation;  b) require the Accounting and Supply Section to collaborate an effective system by which records are reconciled regularly and results of the physical count are promptly tallied with balances recorded in the books of accounts; c) require the Chief Accountant to correct the misclassification of inventories to its proper accounts, to arrive at an accurate balance; d) submit complete supporting documents on the adjustments made and refrain from adjusting the books without valid documents to support the transaction;  e) stop the practice of recording in the books of accounts inventories which are not yet received or actually delivered; and f) strictly comply with the procedures in accomplishing Purchase Orders and ensure to attach to the DV original copy of PO signed by supplier and dated to prove that the supplier conforms and acknowledges his obligation to deliver the items/goods procured.



4)	The accuracy of PPE accounts with an aggregate balance of ₱414,742,877.31 as at December 31, 2020 cannot be relied upon due to: a) inclusion of undelivered Information Communication Technology Equipment (ICTE) totaling ₱10,727,280.40; and  b) non-recording of donated PPE in the books of accounts, contrary to Section 12, Chapter 10 of the GAM Volume I. Moreover, procurement of PPEs totaling ₱2,731,593.34 was not supported with documentary requirements prescribed in Item II, Annex H of 2016 Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA No. 9184 and COA Circular 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012; thus, validity and propriety of purchases made could not be ascertained. (Observation No. 4)



We recommended that Management: a) stop the practice of recording in the books of accounts inventories/goods which was not received/actually delivered; b) secure a deed of donation and other related documents from donor LGUs of PPEs for recording purposes. If found that the PPEs are not intended to be donated to PAO by the LGUs, exclude in the RPCPPE the subject PPEs; and c) submit the required documents to the Office of the Auditor for evaluation and assessment as to compliance with documentary requirements.



5)	Grant and liquidation of cash advances amounting to ₱23,915,673.16 and ₱1,402,263.31, respectively, were inadequately supported with documents contrary to Section 4.6 of PD 1445 and COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012. (Observation No. 5)



We recommended that Management require the Accountable Officers to submit immediately the required documents in accordance with Section 4.6 of P.D. 1445 and COA Circular No. 2012-001.



6)	Wages of Contract of Service (COS) personnel were processed and paid in advance even without the necessary Daily Time Record (DTR) evidencing actual services rendered in violation of Section 88 of PD No. 1445. Likewise, 10 percent tax was withheld from the wages of the COS workers whose annual gross receipt was ₱250,000.00 and below contrary to Revenue Memorandum Circular (RMC) No. 51-2018. (Observation No. 6)



We recommended that Management: a) stop the practice of paying in advance the wages of COS personnel whose services are not yet rendered and strictly adhere to the rules and regulations set forth in Section 88 of PD 1445; and b) direct the Administrative Service Office to strictly comply with taxation requirements prescribed by the BIR and to keep abreast with the new rules and regulations on the collection, withholding and remittance of tax for purposes of equity.



7)	Delayed/non-submission of 84 Contracts and 77 Purchase Orders (POs) to the Office of the Auditor ranging from one to 454 days was contrary to Sections 3.1.1 and 3.2.1 of COA Circular 2009-001, Sections 7.2.1 (a) and 100 of COA Circular 2009-006, thus, causing delay in the review and evaluation of documents. Further, deficiencies noted, if any, may not be communicated and corrected on time. Moreover, 11 POs were not properly accomplished as to the date of suppliers’ receipt/conforme and mode of procurement contrary to Appendix 61 of the GAM Volume II. (Observation No. 7)



We recommended that Management: a) submit Contracts and POs including its supporting documents to the Office of the Auditor within five days from execution of a contract pursuant to Sections 3.1.1 and 3.2.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-001. Moreover, submit immediately the six POs and 50 contracts that have yet to be submitted, for review and evaluation; and b) instruct the Supply Officer to strictly comply with the provisions of GAM Vol. II by properly accomplishing the POs indicating therein the mode of procurement and date of signing the conforme portion by the  suppliers/dealers.
