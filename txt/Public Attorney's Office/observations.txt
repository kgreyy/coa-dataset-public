PART II - OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS





FINANCIAL AUDIT



Cash in Bank – Local Currency, Current Account, Regular Account



1)	The accuracy of the Cash in Bank – Local Currency Current Account, Regular Account with a zero balance as at December 31, 2020 could not be determined due to: a) non-submission of Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS); and b) non-maintenance of subsidiary ledgers (SLs) as required under Section 122 of PD 1445 and Sections 3 and 5, Chapter 21 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) Vol. 1.



	1)	Section 122 of PD 1445 provides that: Whenever deemed necessary in the exigencies of the service, the Commission may under regulations issued by it require the agency heads, chief accountants, x x x x and other responsible officials of the various agencies to submit trial balances, physical inventory reports, current plantilla of personnel, and such other reports as may be necessary for the exercise of its functions.



	2)	(2) Failure   on   the   part   of   the   officials   concerned   to   submit   the   documents   and   reports   mentioned herein shall automatically cause the suspension of payment of their salaries until they shall have complied with the requirements of the Commission.



	3)	Section 3, Chapter 21 of the GAM Vol. 1, states that: The Bank Reconciliation Statement shall be prepared in order to: (a) check correctness of both the bank’s and agency’s/entity’s records; (b) serve as a deterrent to fraud, and; (c) enable the agency/entity or bank to take up charges or credits recognized by the bank or agency/entity but not yet known to the agency/entity or bank. This shall be used in the reconciliation of bank and treasury accounts maintained with Government Servicing Bank.



	4)	Section 5 of the same manual states that:  The Chief Accountant/Designated Staff shall within ten days from receipt of the monthly Bank Statement, together with the paid checks, original copies of Debit Memoranda (DM)/Credit Memoranda (CM) from the government servicing bank, reconcile the bank statement with the general ledger and prepare the bank reconciliation statement in four copies.



	5)	Further, Appendix 6 of GAM Vol. II provides that subsidiary ledger (SL) shows the detail for each control account in the general ledger which is maintained per account and fund cluster by the Accounting Division/Unit.



	6)	The agency maintains Current Account No. 1872-1005-78 with the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) for the PAO Payroll Account.  Bank confirmation revealed that the account has a remaining balance of ₱83,158,832.72 as of December 31, 2020. 



	7)	Based on our records, we noted that the agency did not submit bank reconciliation statement for more than three years now which is required under Section 5, Chapter 21 of the GAM for NGAs Vol. 1.



	8)	Furthermore, inquiry with Management disclosed that the Accounting Division did not maintain subsidiary ledger of the account which contains the details of transactions to support the general ledger control account needed in the reconciliation of account as required in Appendix 6 of GAM Vol. II. The non-submission of BRS and non-maintenance of SL casted doubt on the accuracy of the amount reported in the financial statements.



	9)	We recommended and Management agreed to: 



a)	immediately prepare and submit the BRS for payroll account to the Office of Auditor and henceforth, observe the prescribed period of submission of the monthly BRS pursuant to Sections 122 of PD 1445 and Sections 3 and 5, Chapter 21 of GAM Vol. 1 to avoid sanctions stated in Section 122.2 of PD 1445; and 



b)	maintain SL for the cash in bank –payroll account to ensure proper monitoring and submit to COA together with other monthly reports, if required.





Advances to Officers and Employees 



2)	Liquidation of Advances to Officers and Employees account totaling ₱53,936,047.94 was erroneously recorded in the books which resulted in the overstatements of Basic Salary – Civilian and understatements of various affected accounts contrary to Section 7, Chapter 19 of the GAM Volume I.



1)	

	1)	Advances to Officers and Employees consist of cash advances granted to regular Disbursing Officer to handle Personnel Services (PS) and Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE) of PAO CO and Special Disbursing Officer (SDO) to handle approved payrolls and vouchers for Personnel Services of the Cash Section, PAO CO. 



	2)	As at December 31, 2020, the agency granted total cash advances of ₱68,725,543.67 to Disbursing Officer and Special Disbursing Officer, details as follows:

	3)	Section 7 Chapter 19 of the GAM for NGAs Volume I, states that: financial statements shall present fairly the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions x x x.



	4)	Verification of liquidation vouchers disclosed various erroneous recording in the books of accounts which resulted in the overstatement of Basic Salary – Civilian account and understatement of various affected accounts such as Inquest Allowance-Civilian, Traveling Expenses-Local, Other Supplies and Materials Expenses, OMOE-Sheriff's Fee among others totaling ₱53,936,047.94. 



	5)	We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief Accountant to adjust the erroneous recording in the books of accounts to reflect the actual disbursements in the Financial Statements.



	6)	Management commented that reclassification noted in the AOM was already adjusted thru Journal Entry Voucher (JEV) No. 21-01-0001-5 dated January 2021.









Auditor’s Rejoinder:



	7)	While Management prepared the reclassification of accounts thru JEV No. 21-01-001-5 dated January 2021, however, the financial statements for CY 2020 were not adjusted to reflect the adjustment made. 





3)	The reliability, accuracy and existence of Inventory Held for Consumption account balance totaling ₱30,001,871.25 as at December 31, 2020 cannot be ascertained due to: a) unreconciled balances of Inventory accounts among the general ledger, subsidiary ledger and the Report on the Physical Count of Inventory (RPCI); b) misclassification of some inventory items totaling ₱107,615.33 which resulted in either overstatement or understatement of the affected accounts contrary to the GAM Volume III; and c) recognition of inventories in the books despite non-delivery of the same as of December 31, 2020 contrary to Section 88 (1) of PD No. 1445. Moreover, Purchase Orders (POs) were not properly accomplished contrary to the instructions in Appendix 61 of the GAM Vol. II. 



2)	

	1)	Accounting records as at December 31, 2020 showed the following Inventory Held for Consumption account balance as follows:



Inventory Account

Ending balance

Office Supplies Inventory

₱ 21,423,917.74

Other Supplies and Materials Inventory

8,577,953.51

Total

₱ 30,001,871.25



	2)	Audit disclosed that the account could not be ascertained due to the following:



a)	Unreconciled balances among the GL, SL and the RPCI Inventory accounts 



	3)	As at year end, the Inventory account per general ledger does not reconcile with subsidiary ledger and RCPI balances. Details are as follows:

Office Supplies Inventory

₱ 21,423,917.74

N/A

3,547,589.00 

Total

₱ 30,037,071.25 



₱ 6,617,491.34



	4)	The SL contains details to support a GL control account, but the Accounting Division failed to conduct regular reconciliation of GL and SL records of Office Supplies Inventory which resulted in a total variance of ₱18,510,019.27.



	5)	Further, we noted that in the submitted financial statements, the ending balance of Other Supplies and Materials Inventory amounted to ₱8,577,953.51 which does not reconcile with the amount per GL of ₱8,613,153.51, resulting in a variance of ₱35,200.00. 



	6)	Moreover, while the Supply Section has conducted physical count of inventories totaling ₱6,617,491.34 at year-end, the result of such count did not reconcile with the recorded balance per books resulting in a variance of ₱23,384,379.91.



	7)	In order to establish correct balances of Inventory accounts, it is important that regular reconciliation is made. The failure of the Accounting Division and Supply Section to reconcile their records resulted in a discrepancy of ₱23,384,379.91 which tend to either overstate or understate reported balance of Inventory account by the same amount.



	8)	We recommended that Management:



a)	require the Chief Accountant to see to it that inventory balances in the financial statements, GL and SL are tallied at any given time through conduct of regular reconciliation; and



b)	require the Accounting and Supply Section to collaborate an effective system by which records are reconciled regularly and results of the physical count are promptly tallied with balances recorded in the books of accounts.



	9)	Management commented that the balance of Inventory account reflected in the 2020 financial statements, which was submitted to the COA Main Office on February 11, 2021 corresponds to the correct amount in the GL of ₱8,577,953.51. The Accounting Division and Supply Section personnel are currently in the process of reconciling the GL, SL, and RCPI; afterwards, necessary adjustment to the inventory account will be made/effected immediately.



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



	10)	The noted variance of ₱35,200.00 on Other Supplies and Materials Inventory balance per financial statements and GL was based on submitted GL received by the Audit Team through email dated February 26, 2021. Revised GL was submitted on March 11, 2021 after AOM was issued to Management on March 5, 2021 with the amount corresponding to ₱8,577,953.51. We will take note and closely monitor the action taken by Management on the reconciliation made between recorded amounts in the books and report of inventory. 



b)	Misclassification of some inventory items totaling ₱107,615.33 resulted in either overstatement or understatement of affected accounts



	11)	Volume III of said Manual provides the definition of the following Inventory accounts:



Inventory Held for Consumption –



Office Supplies Inventory – this account is used to recognize the cost or value of purchased/acquired office supplies such as bond papers, inks, and small tangible items like staple wire removers, punchers, staplers and other similar items for government operations. 



Other Supplies and Materials Inventory - this account is used to recognize the cost of purchased/acquired supplies and materials not falling under any of the specific inventory accounts held for consumption.



	12)	Analysis of accounting records revealed errors in the classification of some inventory items into its proper accounts, details as follows:

₱ 107,615.33 

 

 



	13)	In addition, it was also noted that adjustments were made in the books without proper documents to support the same. These adjusting entries decreased the inventory account by ₱2,798,975.75 and increased the expense account in the books with no basis to prove that the adjustment is needed to reflect the correct balance of the account. As a result, the account balance is doubtful. Details are as follows:

Other Supplies and Materials Inventory

Office Supplies Expense



₱2,157,588.46  

Other Supplies and Materials Expense



641,387.29

	14)	We recommended that Management require the Chief Accountant to:



a)	correct the misclassification of inventories to its proper accounts, to arrive at an accurate balance; and



b)	submit complete supporting documents on the adjustments made and refrain from adjusting the books without valid documents to support the transaction.



	15)	Management commented that the inventory items amounting to ₱107,615.33 will be reclassified to the proper accounts as suggested by the Auditors.



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



	16)	We maintain our recommendation that Management submit documents to support the adjustments made on reclassification of accounts. 



c)	Recognition of inventories for which actual delivery have not yet been made



	17)	Section 15, Seq. No. 7 of the GAM Vol. 1 states that: Based on Copy 3 of the IAR and photocopy of PO and DR, prepares JEV to recognize the receipt of inventory items in the books of account (GL).



	18)	The DVs and supporting documents revealed that inventories were recorded in the books as evidenced by the attached Advice to Debit Account (ADA) and MDS checks prepared and charged to appropriations and allotments of CY 2020; thus, obligations were incurred in December 2020 for various POs not yet delivered.

	19)	Gleaned from the table above, checks and ADA have already been prepared for goods purchased but actual delivery has not yet been made as of December 31, 2020. Inquiry revealed that the said checks were not released to suppliers until deliveries are made. However, these checks were recorded in the books and we noted that the submitted DVs lack supporting documents such as Delivery Receipts and Inspection and Acceptance Reports to substantiate recording in the books.



	20)	Notably, the dates of checks were very close to year end and items/goods purchased for inventory were office supplies, which the office could no longer utilize for the remaining period of CY 2020. More so, the supposedly office supplies were not yet delivered.



	21)	Also, it caused the recording in the books of accounts of the agency in December 2020, by debiting inventory and crediting Cash-Modified Disbursement System (MDS), Regular resulting in the overstatement and understatement of various accounts, summarized as follows:



Account Name 

Overstatement 

Understatement

Office Supplies Inventory

18,043,250.00

₱  18,188,188.33



	22)	We recommended that Management stop the practice of recording in the books of accounts inventories which are not yet received or actually delivered.



	23)	Management commented that is not giving or granting advance payments for goods and services that are not yet delivered and/or rendered except for the Procurement Services (PS), which require advance payments. Checks were dated December 2020, but those were not yet released and actually paid until the deliveries of the supplies were received. The actual possession of the checks was with the PAO Cashier and actual payments were made only this year after receipt of actual deliveries. No advance payments were actually given to your mentioned suppliers.





Auditor’s Rejoinder:



	24)	We maintain our position that Management should stop the practice of preparing checks and recognizing goods purchased not yet delivered. The same observation was also noted in FY 2019 AAR which the agency still practices.



Non-compliance with Appendix 61 of the GAM, Volume II in the preparation of PO



	25)	Appendix 61, B.17 of the GAM, Volume II provides that: Conforme – signature over printed name of supplier or his/her representative signifying his/her approval to the term set by the agency/entity and the date of signing.”



	26)	Scrutiny of Disbursement Vouchers disclosed that the attached original Purchase Orders were not signed and dated in the conforme portion of the PO while some photocopy of POs have signatures and dates contrary to the instructions in Appendix 61 of the GAM; thus, casting doubt on the validity of contract entered into by both parties. 



	27)	We recommended that Management strictly comply with the procedures in accomplishing Purchase Orders and ensure to attach to the DV original copy of PO signed by supplier and dated to prove that the supplier conforms and acknowledges his obligation to deliver the items/goods procured.



	28)	Management commented that no deficiency was noted by Auditors when POs were submitted five days from issuance thereof. Thus, they would like to take the exception to the inclusion that the examined POs cast doubt on the validity of contracts entered into by both parties. The fact that the goods covered by the subject POs were delivered goes to show that suppliers agreed to the terms and conditions specified in the respective POs. Thus, the purpose for the “conforme” had been accomplished. 



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



	29)	The Auditors are not precluded from evaluating documents submitted as contract review based on submitted contract/POs/COs, but the same may be done when the transaction was already consummated. 



	30)	Moreover, the delivery of goods is not the determining factor on whether or not the suppliers agreed to the terms and conditions specified in the POs. Due to the absence of the suppliers’ signature and date in the conforme portion of the PO, there was no basis to enforce the terms in the contract particularly in case of default which may deprive the government to collect liquidated damages equivalent to (1/10) of one percent for every day of delay in the delivery of procured items. Thus, we stand with the recommendation.

4)	The accuracy of PPE accounts with an aggregate balance of ₱414,742,877.31 as at December 31, 2020 cannot be relied upon due to: a) inclusion of undelivered Information Communication Technology Equipment (ICTE) totaling ₱10,727,280.40; and b) non-recording of donated PPE in the books of accounts, contrary to Section 12, Chapter 10 of the GAM Volume I. Moreover, procurement of PPEs totaling ₱2,731,593.34 was not supported with documentary requirements prescribed in Item II, Annex H of 2016 Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA No. 9184 and COA Circular 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012; thus, validity and propriety of purchases made could not be ascertained.



3)	

	1)	Accounting records as at December 31, 2020 showed that the PPE accounts have an aggregate balance of ₱414,742,877.31 consisting of the following:

	2)	Audit disclosed that the account could not be ascertained due to the following:



a)	Inclusion of undelivered ICTE totaling ₱10,727,280.40 



	3)	Section 58 of PD No. 1445 provides that: Audit of assets. The examination and audit of assets shall be performed with a view to ascertaining their existence, ownership, valuation and encumbrances as well as the propriety of items composing the respective asset accounts, determining their agreement with records, proving the accuracy of such records; xxx.



	4)	Section 8.a, Chapter 10 of the GAM, Volume I, states that: x PPE acquired through cash purchase shall initially be recognized at cost which includes cash paid plus all costs incurred in bringing the asset to the location necessary for its intended use such as delivery, installation costs, etc. These are recognized in the books of accounts as PPE after inspection and acceptance of delivery. x x 



	5)	We noted that checks have already been prepared for goods purchased but actual delivery has not yet been made as of December 31, 2020. Inquiry revealed that the said checks were not released to suppliers until deliveries are made. However, these checks were recorded in the books and we noted that the submitted DVs lack supporting documents such as Delivery Receipts and Inspection and Acceptance Reports to substantiate recording in the books.

	6)	This practice of preparing checks in advance was a clear indication of circumventing the lapsing of NCAs. Also, it caused the recording in the books of accounts of the agency in December 2020, by debiting ICT Equipment and crediting Cash-MDS, Regular and Due from National Government Agencies – PS-DBM, resulting in the overstatement and understatement of various accounts.



	7)	We recommended that Management stop the practice of recording in the books of accounts inventories/goods which was not received/actually delivered.



	8)	Management commented that is not giving or granting advance payments for goods and services that are not yet delivered and/or rendered except for the Procurement Services (PS), which require advance payments. Due to Covid-19 pandemic and taking consideration the General Community Quarantine (GCQ) status in the NCR up to this time, deliveries of ICTE being purchased are relatively challenging. Nonetheless, they will adhere accordingly.



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



	9)	We maintain our position that Management should stop the practice of preparing checks and recognizing goods purchased not yet delivered. The same observation was also noted in FY 2019 AAR which the agency still practices.





b)	Non-recording of donation from various Local Government Units (LGUs) of undetermined amount



	10)	Section 12, Chapter 10 of the GAM Volume I states that the cost of PPE acquired through donations without condition shall be taken up at its fair value (FV) at the date it is acquired. 



	11)	Scrutiny of RPCPPE disclosed existence of various donations such as Computers, Laptop, Bookshelf, air conditioner and copier machine that are not recorded in the books of accounts. Details of which are shown below:

	12)	The Supply Officer informed the Audit Team that the abovementioned PPEs were donated by various LGUs and no deed of donation between the PAO and LGUs were executed. Thus, resulted in the understatement of PPE accounts by undetermined amount. The responsibility rests with the agency to secure copy of deed of donation and record the same in the books of accounts.



	13)	We recommended that Management secure a deed of donation and other related documents from donor LGUs of PPEs for recording purposes. If found that the PPEs are not intended to be donated to PAO by the LGUs, exclude in the RPCPPE the subject PPEs.



	14)	Management commented that the properties were given to different PAO district offices by their counterpart LGUs and other organizations. However, they are not certain of the intention of LGUs and other organizations on whether they parted ownership of the said properties as their non-execution of the deed of donation is a clear manifestation that these entities would want to retain ownership over the said properties. Inasmuch as PAO is not certain on the intention of LGUs and other organizations on whether they wanted to part ownership over the properties, they regret that recording thereof cannot be undertaken for lack of documents to support the recording.



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



	15)	We maintain our position that donated properties should be recorded in the books of accounts supported with deed of donations from the donor. Inclusion of the subject PPE in the RPCPPE is indicative of claim of ownership following Appendix 73 of the GAM Vol. II which states that: The RPCPPE is the form used to report on the physical count of PPE by type x x x x which are owned by the agency. x x x x.



c)	Lacking documentary requirements totaling ₱2,731,593.34



	16)	Section 4(6) of PD 1445 provides that claims against government funds shall be supported with complete documentation.



	17)	The DVs showed that various purchased PPE valued at ₱2,731,593.34 were not supported with complete documentations as required in Item II, Annex H of RA 9184, COA Circular 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 and 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009; thus, the validity and propriety of expenses incurred could not be ascertained, details as follows:

•	Original Purchase Request duly approved.

•	Approval of the HOPE or his duly authorized representative on the use of alternative methods of procurement, as recommended by the BAC.

Wages of Contract of Service workers



6)	Wages of Contract of Service (COS) personnel were processed and paid in advance even without the necessary Daily Time Record (DTR) evidencing actual services rendered in violation of Section 88 of PD No. 1445. Likewise, 10 percent tax was withheld from the wages of the COS workers whose annual gross receipt was ₱250,000.00 and below contrary to Revenue Memorandum Circular (RMC) No. 51-2018.



6)	

	1)	During CY 2020, the agency employed 61 COS personnel. Review of the contracts and paid payrolls disclosed the following deficiencies:



a)	Payment of wages for services not yet rendered



	2)	Section 88 of PD No. 1445 states that:  Prohibition against advance payment on government contracts. Except with the prior approval of the President (Prime Minister) the government shall not be obliged to make an advance payment for services not yet rendered or for supplies and materials not yet delivered under any contract therefor. x x x x. (emphasis ours)



	3)	Disbursement vouchers covering the period from January 1 to December 31, 2020 revealed that the agency paid in advance the wages of COS personnel for services not yet rendered as evidenced by the cut-off date of the Daily Time Record attached which ranges from two to 17 days before the end of the pay period.

	4)	Inquiry revealed that it had been the practice of the agency to pay in advance the wages of the COS and explained that any absences incurred by the personnel for a particular pay period will be deducted from the wages for the next month. The Payroll Section commented that they refer to the DTR of previous pay period and attach it to the payroll as the basis for computation of current pay. Granting that previous DTRs were attached to show deductions were made in case of absences, the same was not supported by any law, policies, rules and regulations. This practice posed risk and may result to overpayment of wages should personnel fail to render service the next pay period considering that COS personnel are on a “no work, no pay” basis. 



	5)	Advance payment of wages to personnel whose services were not yet rendered was a clear violation of Section 88 of PD 1445.



	6)	We recommended and Management agreed to stop the practice of paying in advance the wages of COS personnel whose services are not yet rendered and strictly adhere to the rules and regulations set forth in Section 88 of PD 1445.



b)	Withholding of 10 percent tax from wages of COS personnel



	7)	Revenue Memorandum Circular (RMC) No. 51-2018 amending Revenue Memorandum Circular No.  69-2017 provides registration and compliance requirements applicable to Professionals and Other Supplier of Services Hired under a COS or JO deriving gross receipts of ₱250,000.00 and below in any 12-month period from a lone payor and with no other source of income. The memorandum circular provides the following:



Registration Requirements 



1)	Registration with the Bureau using BIR Form No.  1901 for Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) issuance with taxpayer type of ‘Professional’ or ‘Professional –In General’ with the following documentary requirements: 

a. Copy of service contract showing the amount of income payment; 

b. Any identification issued by an authorized government body (e.g. Birth Certificate, passport, driver’s license, Community Tax Certificate, etc.) that shows the name, address and birthdate of the applicant; and 



The Registration Officer shall add the words “-Job Order” in the business name field, e.g. “Juan Dela Cruz –Job Order”.



2)	Payment of Annual Registration Fee ;



3)	Tax Type: Income Tax; Percentage Tax; Registration Fee ;



4)	Exemption from the issuance of Certificate of Registration ;



Bookkeeping and Invoicing Requirements



5)	Exemption from compliance with the issuance of registered receipts/invoices;

6)	Exemption from the requirement of maintenance of Books of Accounts; 



Tax Compliance Requirements



7)	Filing of Annual Income Tax Return (BIR Form No. 1701);



8)	Exemption from filing of Quarterly Income Tax Return (BIR Form No. 1701Q);



9)	Not subject to creditable withholding tax rates; and



10)	Filing and payment of Percentage Tax using Quarterly Percentage Tax Return (BIR Form No. 2551Q): 



a)	If opted to avail of the Graduated Income Tax Rates under Section 24(A)(2)(a) of the Tax Code, as amended – Subject to withholding of three percent percentage tax under Section 5.116(A)(1) of Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 2-98, as amended;



b)	Exempted from filing and payment of percentage tax and/or withholding of percentage tax if qualified and opted to avail of the eight percent income tax rate and submits an Income Payee’s Sworn Declaration of his/her gross receipts/sales (Annex “A1”) to the lone income payor/withholding agent, together with a copy of duly received BIR Form No.  1901 or copy of BIR Form No. 0605 -Annual Registration Fee payment, in lieu of the COR (not required to attach COR).



Availment of the Eight Percent Income Tax Rate Option



Professionals and Other Supplier of Services hired under a COS or JO deriving gross receipts of P250,000 and below in any 12-month period from lone payor and with no other source of income, shall signify the intention to elect the eight percent income tax rate in filing of BIR Form No. 1905 (Application for Registration Information Update) or filing of 1st Quarterly Percentage Tax Return.



	8)	The disbursement vouchers of paid payrolls of COS personnel revealed that Management withheld 10 percent tax from the wages of COS personnel.  According to Management, they were not able to submit Income Payee’s Sworn Declaration within the deadline set; thus, the automatic withholding of 10 percent tax. The Income Payee’s Sworn Declaration provides the COS personnel the opportunity to choose between the three-percentage tax rate or eight percent income tax rate which is lower than the 10 percent tax rate withheld by PAO from the wages of COS personnel. 



	9)	The submitted contracts clearly showed that the wages of COS personnel were subjected to the withholding of 10 percent tax due to inclusion of the provision in the contract which prevented the personnel from choosing among the options as available to COS personnel as specifically provided in the Revenue Memorandum Circular. In part, the contract was disadvantageous to COS personnel.



	10)	Lapses on the part of the PAO Administrative Service Office to give the COS personnel the opportunity to choose the option offered under the BIR regulation caused the COS personnel to pay more than what was due them. On the other hand, due to the lack of information on the part of the COS personnel to comply with the required registration, they were made liable for payment of 10 percent tax rate or subjected to withholding percentage tax in a rate of 10 percent. Based on the foregoing, the tax rate withheld by the agency is not in accordance with the provisions of the BIR regulation. 



	11)	We recommended that Management direct the Administrative Service Office to strictly comply with taxation requirements prescribed by the BIR and to keep abreast with the new rules and regulations on the collection, withholding and remittance of tax for purposes of equity



	12)	Management commented that regarding the tax being deducted from the COS monthly compensation, they already instructed the COS to comply with the registration and requirements as mandated by BIR RMC No. 51-2018 and they are still in the process of registration this year CY 2021.





Delayed submission of contracts and Purchase Orders



7)	Delayed/non-submission of 84 Contracts and 77 Purchase Orders (POs) to the Office of the Auditor ranging from one to 454 days was contrary to Sections 3.1.1 and 3.2.1 of COA Circular 2009-001, Sections 7.2.1 (a) and 100 of COA Circular 2009-006, thus, causing delay in the review and evaluation of documents. Further, deficiencies noted, if any, may not be communicated and corrected on time. Moreover, 11 POs were not properly accomplished as to the date of suppliers’ receipt/conforme and mode of procurement contrary to Appendix 61 of the GAM Volume II.



a)	Delayed/non submission of Contracts and Purchase Orders (POs)



7)	

	1)	Section 3.1.1 of COA Circular 2009-001 states that: Within five (5) working days from the execution of a contract by the government or any of its subdivisions, agencies or instrumentalities, including government-owned and controlled corporations and their subsidiaries, a copy of said contract and each of all the documents forming part thereof by reference or incorporation shall be furnished to the Auditor of the agency concerned. x x x x.



	2)	Section 3.2.1 of COA Circular 2009-001 states that:  A copy of any purchase order irrespective of amount, and each and every supporting document, shall, within five (5) working days from issuance thereof, be submitted to the Auditor concerned.



	3)	Our records showed that 34 Contracts and 71 POs entered into by the agency were submitted to the Office of the Auditor beyond the prescribed period or delay ranging from one to 454 days.

	4)	Gleaned from the table above, out of the 161 contracts/POs, 50 pertains to COS personnel and six POs that were not yet submitted to the Office of the Auditor. The 50 contracts of COS personnel were identified based on the paid payrolls charged to General Services for CY 2020. A letter request dated February 1, 2021 was sent to Management for its submission, however, only 12 were submitted, leaving 50 unsubmitted to date.



	5)	The delayed/non-submission of Contracts and POs within the prescribed period precluded the auditor from evaluating the compliance of the Agency with the requirements of applicable laws, rules and regulations; completeness of documentary requirements; and for the purpose of determining that contracts entered into by Management are not disadvantageous to the government. Further, deficiencies noted, if any, will not be communicated immediately to the Management for appropriate action. 



	6)	We recommended that Management submit Contracts and POs including its supporting documents to the Office of the Auditor within five days from execution of a contract pursuant to Sections 3.1.1 and 3.2.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-001. Moreover, submit immediately the six POs and 50 contracts that have yet to be submitted, for review and evaluation.



	7)	Management commented that the unintentional delay in the submission of copies of the contracts and POs were attributed to the difficulties brought about by the COVID 19 pandemic and the implementation of alternative work arrangement (AWA) in 2020 of PAO personnel. It was a period of adjustment to the new normal resulting in unintentional lapses.









Auditor’s Rejoinder:



	8)	We did not include in the count of delay the time when ECQ and MECQ were declared. Thus, we maintain our position that Management incurred delay in the submission of POs and contracts. Nevertheless, we will monitor implementation of actions taken by Management.



b)	Purchase Orders were not properly accomplished



	9)	Out of the submitted 77 POs amounting to ₱1,161,782.89, 11 were not properly accomplished where necessary information such as mode of procurement i.e public bidding, etc. and date of signing the conforme portion by suppliers/contractors were not properly filled out as required under Items 5 and 17 of Appendix 61 GAM Volume II. As such, mode of procurement resorted to by Management was not validated in the early stage of procurement while the basis in the computation of liquidated damages equivalent to 1/10 of one percent for every day of delay in delivery of procured items could not be determined. 



	10)	We recommended that Management instruct the Supply Officer to strictly comply with the provisions of GAM Vol. II by properly accomplishing the POs indicating therein the mode of procurement and date of signing the conforme portion by the suppliers/dealers. 



	11)	Management commented that it was never intentional and could be due to oversight and inadvertence. 





Other Significant Findings



8)	Non-compliance by Regional PAO offices to various laws, rules and regulations:



a)	annual physical count of PPE was not conducted in Regions II, IVB and VI contrary to Section 38, Chapter 10 of the GAM Volume I; thus, affecting the reliability of consolidated balances of the PPE accounts;



b)	various financial reports were not submitted to the Regional Audit Teams in Regions I, IVB and IX contrary to the provision of Section 4(6), 100 and 74 of PD No. 1445, Section 7.2.1(a) of COA Circular 2009-006 dated January 15, 2009, Sections 7, Chapter 21 of the GAM Vol. 1, thereby precluded the auditor from timely audit of transactions;



c)	unserviceable properties totaling to ₱1,540,451.71 were not yet disposed in Region IVA contrary to Section 79 of PD 1445; thus, exposing the properties to further deterioration which may result to loss of additional potential income; and

d)	components of the computer set were not indicated in the RPCPPE of Region IX contrary to Section 111 (1) of PD No. 1445, thereby exposing the Agency’s properties to risks of loss or risks of not being located or accounted for.

Recommendation

Region VI

No physical count of PPE was conducted



Physical inventory taking being an indispensable procedure for checking the integrity of property custodianship has not been regularly undertaken. The conduct of physical inventory and reconciliation procedures are important internal accounting controls over PPE in order to establish check and balance between custodial and accounting functions. The absence of these procedures may pose risks that the agency may not be able to know the actual existence and condition of its properties and that the balance of PPE accounts may not be fairly presented in the financial statements of the agency as of a given period.

Section 38, Chapter 10 of the GAM Volume I, provides that, the entity shall have a periodic physical count of PPE, which shall be done annually and presented on the RPCPPE (Appendix 71) as at December 31 of each year.  This shall be submitted to the Auditor concerned not later than January 31 of the following year.  Equipment found at station and losses discovered during the physical count shall be reported to the AD/Unit for proper accounting/ recording.



We recommended that Management:



a)	adhere to the provisions of the GAM in the conduct of periodic physical count of PPE;



b)	create an Inventory Committee to conduct physical inventory of all its properties; and



c)	immediately submit the RPCPPE to the Auditor as required under the GAM.

Region IVB



Region IX

Some financial reports were not submitted to the Regional Auditors



Region I

The Cash Disbursement Record (CDR), Liquidation Report (LR), DV and supporting documents for the Month of December 2020 were not submitted to the Office of the Auditor for post-audit which prevented evaluation of validity of claims against government funds for the said period. 



Region IVB

Payment for operating expenses of Provincial District Offices (PDOs) totaling ₱128,181.62 was not supported with complete documents due to the failure of PAO Disbursing Officers to submit the original DVs and supporting documents to the RO; thus casting doubt on the validity and propriety of the claim.  



Region IX

The Agency was not able to submit BRS for the months of July 1-31, 2017, and September 1, 2017 to December 31, 2020, totaling 41 monthly BRS. 

Section 4(6) of PD No. 1445 states that, Claims   against   government   funds   shall be supported with complete documentation.



Section 100 of PD 1445 states that, Disbursing Officers in any government agency shall render monthly reports of their transactions pursuant to regulations of the Commission to be submitted not later than the fifth day of the ensuing month to the auditor concerned who shall conduct the necessary examination and audit within thirty days from receipt thereof.



Sections 7, Chapter 21 of the GAM Vol. 1, provides the, “Reporting. The Chief Accountant shall submit the BRS within twenty days after receipt of the monthly BS to the following:

Original – COA Auditor (with all the supporting documents and JEVs)

  x x x x” 



We recommended that Management:



a)	instruct the personnel concerned to submit financial reports and its supporting documents to the Office of the Auditor within the prescribed period for timely audit and recording in the centralized accounting of PAO-Central Office; and



b)	immediately prepare and submit all BRS that are not yet submitted to the Office of the Auditor.



Region IVA

One hundred twenty nine (129) unserviceable properties amounting to ₱1,540,451.71 are not yet disposed in accordance with Section 79 of PD 1445; thus exposing the properties to further deterioration. 



Verification of the submitted Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) disclosed that 129  properties amounting to P1,540,451.71 were marked as either “unserviceable, bogged down or destroyed” for disposal, but not yet disposed as of December 31, 2020. Further, review of the submitted report revealed that complete details, such as, unit cost and quantity of various items were not properly

filled out in the IIRUP.



Section 79 of P. D. 1445 provides that, When government property has become unserviceable for any cause or is no longer needed, it shall, upon application of the officer accountable therefore, be inspected by the head of the agency or his duly authorized representative xxx and if found to be valueless or unserviceable, it may be destroyed. If found valuable, it may be sold at public auction to the highest bidder under supervision of the proper committee on award or similar body xxx. In the event that public auction fails, the property may be sold at a private sale at such prices as maybe fixed by the same committee or body concerned xxx.”



We recommended that the Regional Public Attorney require the Supply/ Property Custodian of PAO RIVA to:



a)	create a Regional Inventory and Inspection and Disposal Committee to conduct inspection and appraisal of all unserviceable properties and request authority from PAO CO for its disposal either through sale, if found valuable, but if not, through condemnation/destruction or transfer without cost to other government entities, duly witnessed by a representative from the Office of the Auditor; and



b)	properly accomplish the required  information in the IIRUP to be supported with documents prescribed in the “Manual on the Disposal of Government Property”, pursuant to DBM NBC No. 425 dated January 28, 1992.

Region IX

Each computer set is usually composed of a Central Processing Unit, monitor, keyboard, mouse and/or Uninterruptible Power Supply. However, during the physical count of PPE last January 14, 2021, we noted that the RPCPPE does not specify each component of the computer set. Instead, each computer set is reported as one item. This manner of reporting does not present the details / description, property number, condition and whereabouts of each component of the computer.



According to Agency personnel, they have been accustomed to submit RPCPPEs prepared in such manner to PAO CO.

However, as a result thereof, it is difficult to account for or identify the location of each part of the computer set, which may expose the same to risks of loss or risks of not being located or accounted for during physical count. Moreover, it is also difficult to report the condition of each item since this is assessed on a per item basis.



Section 111(1) of PD 1445 provides that, “Keeping of accounts. 1. The accounts of an agency shall be kept in such detail as is necessary to meet the needs of the agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or control agencies of the government. x x x x”



We recommended that Management specify the details of properties or components of the computer set in the RPCPPE such as serial numbers, property numbers, whereabouts and condition to determine its existence and status,
