PART II - OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

 

FINANCIAL AUDIT 

 

Accounting Errors, Omissions, and Misstatements 

 

1. The consolidated financial statements (FSs) of the Commission on Higher 
Education (CHED) for Calendar Year (CY) 2020 are materially misstated by 

₱17,509,164,902.33 on account of errors, omissions and improper accounting 

treatment of transactions that are considered as departures from the 

International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) and the Government 

Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), hence 

affecting the fair presentation of its consolidated financial position as at 

December 31, 2020, and its consolidated financial performance and cash flows 

for the year then ended. 

 

1.1 Section 7, Chapter 19 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, states that: 

 

“The FSs shall present fairly the financial position, financial 

performance and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation 

requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, 

other events and conditions in accordance with the definitions and 

recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses 

set out in Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standards 

(PPSAS).1The application of PPSASs, with additional disclosures 

when necessary, is presumed to result in financial statements that 

achieve a fair presentation.” 

 

1.2 Section 111 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 provides that the accounts 

of the agency shall be kept in such detail as necessary to meet the needs of the 

agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish the information needed by 

the fiscal or control agencies of the government. 

 

1.3 The responsibility for the fair presentation and reliability of the FSs rests with 

the management of the reporting entity, particularly the head of 

finance/accounting office and the head of entity or his authorized 

representative. 

 

 
1Renamed to International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) with corresponding Philippine Application 

Guidance, pursuant to COA Resolution  No. 2020-001 dated January 9, 2020  

 



62 

 

1.4 A misstatement in the FS occurs when the accounting standards as set forth in 

the IPSAS and the GAM for NGAs have not been properly applied. Errors, on 

the other hand, include the effects of mathematical mistakes, mistakes in 

applying accounting policies, oversights or misinterpretations of facts, and 

fraud. The FSs do not comply with IPSASs if they contain either material 

errors, or immaterial errors made intentionally to achieve a particular 

presentation of an entity’s Statement of Financial Position, Statement of 

Financial Performance, or Statement of Cash Flows. 

 

1.5 Also, among the basic government accounting and budget reporting principles 

as provided in Section 6, Chapter 2 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, is that 

each entity shall recognize and present its financial transactions and operations 

conformably to the Revised Chart of Accounts (RCA) prescribed by COA.  

 

1.6 One of the objectives of the RCA is to provide uniform accounts for national 

government accounting and budget systems to facilitate the preparation of 

harmonized and comparable financial and budgetary accountability reports. 

 

1.7 Section 6.K, Chapter 19 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I provides that the 

information in FSs is comparable when users are able to identify similarities 

and differences between that information and information in other reports. 

Comparability applies to the comparison of FSs of the same entity over periods 

of time. 

 

1.8 The results of audit on CHED’s consolidated FSs for CY 2020 disclosed 

uncorrected misstatements in the total amount of ₱17,509,164,902.33 on 

account of errors, omissions and improper accounting treatment of transactions 

which are considered as departures from the IPSAS and GAM for NGAs.

1.10 The Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, Special Account is debited to recognize 
the amount of collections remitted to the BTr under the Special Account in the 

General Fund (SAGF) and adjustments for lapsed Notice of Cash Allocation 

(NCA). This account is credited to recognize receipt of NCA and upon closing 

of the SAGF. In the BTr books, this account is credited for remittance made 

by NGAs for SAGF. This account is debited for replenishments of agencies’ 

negotiated checks charged to MDS-Special Account. 

 

1.11 The Higher Education Development Fund (HEDF) was created pursuant to 
Republic Act (RA) No. 7722, also known as the Higher Education Act of 1994. 



64 

 

The HEDF was established exclusively for the strengthening of higher 

education in the entire country. 

 

1.12 The manners of contribution to the Fund as provided under Section 10 of RA 
No. 7722 are as follows: 

 

a. the amount of Five hundred million pesos (₱500,000,000) as seed capital; 
b. the amount of Fifty million pesos (₱50,000,000) for the initial operation of 

the Commission; 

c. the equivalent of forty percent (40%) annual share on the total gross 
collections of the travel tax; 

d. the equivalent of thirty percent (30%) share of the collections from the 
Professional Registration Fee; and 

e. the equivalent of one percent (1%) of the gross sales of the lotto operation 
of the PCSO. 

 

1.13 Moreover, an additional contribution to the HEDF is to be made by the Bases 
Conversion and Development Authority (BCDA) pursuant to RA No. 7917 

entitled, “An Act Amending Section 8 of RA No. 7227, otherwise known as the 

Bases Conversion and Development Act of 1992, Providing for the 

Distribution of Proceeds from the Sale of Portions of Metro Manila Military 

Camps, and for Other Purposes.” The relevant provision in RA No. 7917 is 

quoted below: 

 
“(7) One percent (1%) – As contribution for the Higher Education 

Development Fund under Section 10 of RA No. 7722, otherwise known as 

the Higher Education Act of 1994, the amount of Five hundred million 

pesos (₱500,000,000) or so much thereof, and the balance to finance 

students’ scholarship, faculty development, and the improvement of 

physical plants of colleges and universities under the CHED.” 

 

1.14 The HEDF Seed Capital with a year-end balance of ₱254,128,857.33 was 
placed in an Investment Management Agreement account with the DBP. The 

same is also recorded in the books of CHED as Other Investments. 

 

1.15 On the other hand, the annual share of CHED on the collections of travel tax 
by the Tourism Infrastructure and Enterprise Zone Authority (TIEZA), 

professional registration fees by the Professional Regulation Commission 

(PRC), lotto operations of the PCSO, and proceeds from the sale of Metro 

Manila Military Camps by BCDA are being remitted directly by the said 

agencies to the BTr. These remittances accrue to the account of CHED and are 

recognized in the books of BTr as Cash- Treasury/Agency Deposit, Special 

Account - CHED. 

 

1.16 Meanwhile, the Special Provisions on CHED under the General 
Appropriations Act (GAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 and prior years require 

that the annual release of cash allocations out of the said collections shall be 



65 

 

covered by a Special Allotment Release Order (SARO) issued by the 

Department of Budget and Management (DBM). 

 

1.17 Based on Annex J of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, the pro-forma journal 
entries to account the subject remittances in the books of both CHED-HEDFS 

and BTr are as follows:

1.18 However, verification by the Audit Team disclosed that the remittances by 
TIEZA, PRC, PCSO and BCDA to the BTr are only subject to monitoring and 

validation by HEDF Staff (HEDFS) but not recorded in the books of accounts. 

What is being recorded is only the receipt of NCA from the DBM, but the 

balance of accumulated remittances to the BTr was treated as off the books. 

This practice, however, is contrary to Section 7, Chapter 19 of the GAM for 



66 

 

NGAs, Volume I considering that the effects of the subject transactions are not 

fully recorded/accounted in the books and therefore not reflected in the FSs. 

 

1.19 Based on the Summary of Contributions supported with Certifications from 
the BTr submitted by the HEDFS to the Audit Team, a total of 

₱32,734,606,134.70 was directly remitted by PCSO, PRC, TIEZA, and BCDA 

to BTr from CYs 1995 to 2020. Out of this amount, ₱20,761,235,063.00 was 

released to CHED covered by SAROs and NCAs, thereby leaving a balance of 

₱11,973,371,071.70 as of December 31, 2020. Details are shown below:

Remittances from CYs 1995 to 2020: 

PCSO 3,979,663,295.83 

PRC 486,681,283.07  

TIEZA 28,055,983,562.76  

BCDA 212,277,993.04  

Total 32,734,606,134.70 

Less: Released to CHED covered by SAROs  20,761,235,063.00 

Balance, as of December 31, 2020 11,973,371,071.70 

 
1.20 Since the CHED failed to record the remittances of collections to the BTr, the 

year-end balance of Cash – Treasury/Agency Deposit, Special Account as well 
as Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit), Share from Earnings of Government- 
Owned or Controlled Corporations and Share from PAGCOR/PCSO accounts 
are therefore understated by ₱11,973,371,071.70, ₱11,707,746,341.60, 
₱216,777,450.00 and ₱48,847,280.10, respectively. 

 
1.21 We recommended that the Management require the Chief Accountant of 

HEDFS to recognize in the books of accounts the share of CHED on the 
collections of TIEZA, PRC, PCSO and BCDA by debiting Cash – 

Treasury/Agency Deposit, Special Account and crediting Accumulated 

Surplus/(Deficit), Share from Earnings of Government-Owned or 
Controlled Corporations and Share from PAGCOR/PCSO accounts.  

 
1.22 In a letter dated April 7, 2021, the HEDFS commented that they will record 

the collections/remittances of TIEZA, PRC, PCSO and BCDA under the 
account Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, Special Account. 

 
a.2. Erroneous recording of deposits with DBP of ₱1,184,637,031.34 

 
1.23 In line with the implementation of Student Loan Program for Tertiary 

Education-Short Term Basis (SLPTESTB), an agreement was made between 
CHED and DBP on July 30, 2008 designating the latter as the depository bank 
and will be responsible for the delivery of DBP’s quality service in any of its 
branches nationwide. The funds shall be maintained in interest-earning Special 
Savings Deposit (SSD) account and shall be used to pay the intended 



67 

 

beneficiaries as the need arises in accordance with authorization letters to be 
provided by CHED. 

 

1.24 An agreement was entered between the Unified Financial Assistance System 
for Tertiary Education (UniFAST) Board and DBP on April 17, 2019 for the 
latter to provide timely and automated disbursement requirements related to 
the UNIFAST’s various scholarship programs, grants, financial assistance, 
student loan programs, particularly the SLPTESTB. Under the agreement, 
CHED will deposit with DBP the funds which shall be maintained in an 
interest-earning SSD account based on the prevailing rates or depending on the 
applicable program requirement. 

 
1.25 Verification disclosed that the funds deposited at DBP with a year-end balance 

of ₱1,184,637,031.34 were erroneously recorded in the books as Due from 
Government-Owned or Controlled Corporations (GOCCs) instead of Cash in 
Bank-LCCA. The funds deposited with DBP cannot be considered as a regular 
fund transfer that should be recorded under the Due from GOCCs account 
since DBP is not an implementing agency but acts only as a depository bank 
for CHED. The relationship between CHED and DBP is not that between of a 
source and implementing agencies, respectively, but as depositor and 
depository bank. In fact, these funds deposited at DBP are maintained in an 
interest-earning SSD account under the name of CHED and are supported by 
bank statements; hence, the deposits should be recorded as Cash in Bank-
LCCA instead of Due from GOCCs. 

 
1.26 We recommended that the Management require the Chief Accountant of 

Administrative and Financial Management Service (AFMS) to reclassify 

the account with DBP from Due from GOCCs account to Cash in Bank-
LCCA. 

 
1.27 In a letter dated April 7, 2021, the AFMS commented that Journal Entry 

Voucher (JEV) No. 2021-03-00785 dated March 31, 2021 was prepared to 
reclassify the accounts with DBP from Due from GOCCs account to Cash in 
Bank-LCCA. 

 

a.3. Net unrecorded interest income of ₱22,463.07 
 

1.28 The balance of Cash in Bank-LCCA is understated by a net amount of 
₱22,463.07 due to unrecorded interest income of ₱105,310.54 in CYs 2018 to 
2020 and unrecorded remittance to BTr of interest income in the amount of 
₱82,847.47 in CYs 2016 and 2017. 
 

1.29 According to the HEDFS, they have already requested DBP to remit the 
interests earned to the BTr from CYs 2018 to 2019.  

 

1.30 We recommended that the Management require the Chief Accountant of 
HEDFS to prepare adjusting journal entry/ies to account the interest 
income and the unrecorded remittance/s.

b.1. Unrecorded liquidations of ₱2,267,527,564.87 
 

1.32 Section 63, Chapter 6 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I provides the following 
accounting policies for the transfer of funds: 

 

a. A Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) shall be entered into by the Source 
Agency (SA) and the Implementing Agency (IA) for the undertaking by the 

latter of the project of the former. The MOA shall provide for the 

requirements for project implementation and reporting.  

 

b. A separate subsidiary record for each account shall be maintained by the IA 
whether or not a separate bank account is opened.  

 

c. Within 10 days after the end of each month/end of the agreed period for the 
Project, the IA shall submit the Report of Checks Issued (RCI) and the 

Report of Cash Disbursements to report the utilization of the funds. Only 

actual project expenses shall be reported. The reports shall be approved by 

the Head of the IA. 

 

d. The IA shall return to the SA any unused balance upon completion of the 
project, if stipulated in the MOA. 

 

1.33 In line with the implementation of Tertiary Education Subsidy (TES) and 
Enhanced Student Grants in Aid Program for Poverty Alleviation (ESGP-PA) 

as components of the Universal Access to Quality Tertiary Education 

(UAQTE) Program, the CHED transfers funds to State Universities and 

Colleges (SUCs) and CHED-recognized Local State Universities (LUCs). The 

fund transfers are recorded under Due from NGAs account and subject to 

liquidation by SUCs and LUCs. 



70 

 

1.34 Verification by the Audit Team revealed that the AFMS had already received 
from the UniFAST the Liquidation Reports (LRs) submitted by SUCs and 

LUCs pertaining to the utilization of the TES and ESGP-PA for Academic 

Year (AY) 2018-2019 aggregating ₱2,423,666,483.25. Based on records, 

some of the LRs were already submitted to AFMS as early as August 2019. 

However, only ₱156,138,918.38 or 6.44% was recorded as of December 31, 

2020, leaving an unrecorded total liquidation of ₱2,267,527,564.87, as shown 

below:

Total 2,423,666,483.25 156,138,918.38 2,267,527,564.87 

 

1.35 It is emphasized that the LRs submitted by SUCs/LUCs were already pre-
audited by the UniFAST prior to submission to AFMS. However, said LRs 

still undergo a second round of checking by the AFMS as stated in the TES 

Guidelines and tripartite MOA with CHED, UniFAST and the concerned 

SUC/LUC. Since both the UniFAST and AFMS check the same LRs, this 

resulted in extended/longer turnaround time on the recording of the 

liquidations, hence the huge amount of unrecorded liquidations at year-end. 

Moreover, the recording of liquidations for TES and ESGP-PA could have 

been done by the UniFAST alone, but since it has no Accountant in its Finance 

Unit, the recording is still lodged with the AFMS.   

 

1.36 In view of the foregoing, the Due from NGAs and the Accumulated 
Surplus/(Deficit) accounts are both overstated by ₱2,267,527,564.87. 

 
1.37 We recommended that the Management require the: 
 

a. Chief Accountant of AFMS to fast-track the recording of the received 
LRs from UniFAST aggregating to ₱2,267,527,564.87; and  

 
b. UniFAST Secretariat to bolster the capacity of its Finance Unit by 

hiring an Accountant who will process the Disbursement Vouchers 

(DVs). 
 

b.2. Unrecorded deliveries from DBM-PS - ₱46,938,617.76 
 

1.38 Section 21 of the General Provisions of the FY 2020 GAA requires all agencies 
of the government to purchase from the DBM-PS all common-use supplies as 

mandated under Letter of Instructions No. 755 dated October 18, 1978, 

Executive Order No. 359, s. 1989, Administrative Order No. 17, s. 2011, and 

such other guidelines issued thereon.  



71 

 

1.39 In conformity with the said regulations, the CHED transfers funds in advance 
to the DBM-PS for its office supplies and equipment requirements based on 

the approved Agency Procurement Request (APR). Upon receipt of the check 

payment and APR, the DBM-PS then delivers the procured items oftentimes 

on staggered basis depending on the availability of the stocks on hand. These 

advances are recorded in the books of CHED as debit to Due from NGAs 

account. 

 

1.40 Verification by the Audit Team disclosed that deliveries in prior years and 
current year amounting to ₱33,976,834.94 and ₱12,961,782.82, respectively, 

or a total of ₱46,938,617.76 remain unrecorded in the books. The deliveries 

pertain to Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Equipment, 

Software Licenses, Technical and Scientific Equipment, Office Equipment, 

Motor Vehicles, Common Supplies and Semi-Expendable items that were 

already delivered, distributed and duly accepted by the end-users. However, 

these items were not yet recorded in the books because the copies of Delivery 

Receipts (DRs), Inspection and Acceptance Reports (IARs), and Property 

Acknowledgement Receipts (PARs) were not yet forwarded by the Property 

Office to the AFMS. Interview with the Property Officer revealed that they are 

already in process of collating all the said documents for its immediate 

submission to the AFMS for their recording.   
 

1.41 We recommended that the Management require the Chief Accountant of 
AFMS to: 

 

a. coordinate with the Property Officer for the submission of documents 
pertaining to the various deliveries by DBM-PS that were not yet 
recognized in the books; and 

 

b. prepare adjusting journal entries to record the delivered supplies and 
equipment in order to reflect the correct balance of Due from NGAs 

account and other affected account/s. 
 

1.42 The AFMS commented that there is an ongoing coordination with the Property 
Division and adjusting entries will be done upon submission of DRs by the 

latter. 
 

b.3. Unrecorded Service Charge/Administrative Cost on procurements from DBM-
PS - ₱817,086.40 

 

1.43 Audit disclosed that the 4% Service Charge/Administrative Cost amounting to 
₱817,086.40 charged by DBM-PS to CHED-CO on the procurement of 14 

Generator Sets were not recorded/capitalized in the books, hence overstated 

the Due from NGAs account while understated the Other Machinery and 

Equipment account by the same amount. 

 



72 

 

1.44 The HEDFS commented that they did not receive the original copies of DR 
Nos. M18-005298 and M18-005298, which included the 4% administrative 

cost charged by DBM-PS since the Generator Sets were directly delivered to 

the CHEDROs. Rather, only a copy of the individual DR coming from the 

supplier (which bears no amount) and Purchase Order were received by them.  
 

1.45 We recommended that the Management require the Chief Accountant of 
HEDFS to prepare adjusting journal entry/ies to recognize the 4% 

administrative cost, or equivalent to ₱817,086.40, charged by DBM-PS for 

the delivered Generator Sets to CHED. 

 

1.46 In its reply dated April 7, 2021, the HEDFS commented that JEV shall be 
prepared to recognize the amount of ₱817,086.40 as administrative cost for the 

delivery of Generator Sets to CHED-CO and CHEDROs.  

 

b.4. Erroneous recording of deposits at DBM-PS - ₱1,000,000.00 
 

1.47 The Government Fares Agreement (GFA) is an initiative of the DBM and the 
PhilGEPS that will ensure fast, efficient, flexible and savings in time, energy 

and money in processing the air transportation needs of the government 

officers for their official trips. 

 

1.48 Based on Article 3.2 of the MOA dated September 6, 2017 between CHED 
and DBM-PS, the former shall deposit to the latter the amount of 

₱2,000,000.00 as advance payment, which shall also be considered as a source 

of fund for the procurement. 

 

1.49 On August 11, 2017, Check No. 1352905 amounting to ₱1,000,000.00 has 
been deposited by the CHED-CO to the DBM-PS, short by ₱1,000,000.00 

based on the agreed amount of ₱2,000,000.00. The transfer was supported by 

APR No. G2017-07-001 and Obligation Request Status 2017-08-02306 dated 

July 24, 2017 and August 3, 2017, respectively. 

 

1.50 In the books of CHED-CO, the amount of ₱1,000,000.00 was erroneously 
recorded as Guaranty Deposits instead of Due from NGAs account; while in 

the books of DBM-PS, the amount of ₱1,000,000.00 was properly recorded 

under Due to NGAs account since it considers the deposit as an advance 

payment and works as funds held in trust or a “debit line.” The Due to NGAs 

account in the books of DBM-PS is the reciprocal account of Due from NGAs 

in the books of CHED.  
 

1.51 We recommended that the Management require Chief Accountant of 
AFMS to prepare adjusting journal entry/ies in order to reflect the correct 

balance of Due from NGAs account and other affected account/s. 

 

 



73 

 

b.5. Unrecorded return of savings from completed projects - ₱450,759,611.64 
 

1.52 Based on the MOA dated November 27, 2015, the CHED-CO engaged the 
services of PITC for the procurement of equipment requirements of the 

Philippine-California Advanced Research Institutes (PCARI) Project. 

Confirmation with PITC disclosed a discrepancy of ₱629,426,870.05, shown 

as follows: 

 

Particulars 
CHED-CO PITC Difference 

(In Php) 

Beginning balance, 01/01/2020 757,908,474.35 708,880,285.10 49,028,189.25 
Add: Interest Earned -    36,213.38 (36,213.38) 
Total 757,908,474.35 708,916,498.48 48,991,975.87 
Less: Deliveries  - 124,849,038.10 (124,849,038.10) 
         Return of savings 

from completed projects   

- 454,996,955.01 (454,996,955.01) 

Interest earned from 

previous year 

- 588,901.07 (588,901.07) 

Ending Balance, 12/31/2020 757,908,474.35 128,481,604.30 629,426,870.05 

 

1.53 Huge portion of the discrepancy pertains to return of savings from completed 
projects of ₱454,996,955.01 recorded in the PITC but not in CHED. 

Examination of the collections by CHED-CO disclosed a check collection of 

₱2,907,343.37 from PITC per DBP Check No. 59062686 dated September 15, 

2020 with Official Receipt (OR) No. 878992 and ₱1,330,000.00 per DBP 

Check No. 59062697 dated December 28, 2020 with OR No. 8799076 dated 

January 6, 2021. These collections represent two of the four checks issued by 

PITC in CY 2020 for the return of savings from various CHED completed 

projects. On the other hand, the remaining two checks totaling 

₱450,759,611.64 were remitted directly by the PITC to BTr, as shown below: 

 
Check BTr OR 

No. Date No. Date Amount (In Php) 

59062688 9/30/2020 7061443 10/1/2020 450,598,335.24 
59062698 12/28/2020 7061732 12/29/2020 161,276.40 

Total 450,759,611.64 

 

1.54 Considering that the amount of ₱450,759,611.64 was already returned by 
PITC, the Due from of GOCCs account is therefore overstated by the same 

amount. 

 

1.55 We recommended that the Management require the Chief Accountant of 
AFMS to: 

 

a. follow-up from PITC the checks and ORs issued by BTr for the return 
of savings from completed projects, Project Completion Reports 

(PCRs), LRs, and proof that the interest earned were remitted/ 



74 

 

reverted directly to BTr, in order to record and account accordingly 

the movements in the funds transferred to them; and 

 

b. prepare adjusting entries to record the amounts directly remitted by 
PITC to the BTr. 

 

1.56 In a letter dated April 21, 2018, AFMS commented that a letter request to PITC 

to provide CHED with the supporting documents has been sent. Likewise, 

adjusting entries will be made to record interest income earned, deliveries 

already made, return of funds and other accounting errors identified as soon as 

the supporting documents are secured from PITC.  

 

b.6. Unrecorded deliveries from PITC - ₱175,466,128.42 

 

1.57 Audit disclosed that deliveries from PITC totaling ₱175,466,128.42 were not 

yet recognized in the books of CHED due to the non-submission of PCRs by 

the former. The PCRs serve as LR/document and support the entry in recording 

deliveries. The PITC forwards the PCR to CHED upon the completion of the 

projects and payment to its suppliers. Nevertheless, since deliveries were 

already made, the Due from GOCCs account and the Accumulated 

Surplus/(Deficit) accounts are therefore overstated by ₱175,466,128.42. 

 

1.58 We recommended that the Management: 
 

a. prepare the adjusting journal entries to record deliveries already 

made by PITC; and 
  

b. assign a Person-in-Charge who will regularly reconcile the records 

with the PITC and monitor the deliveries made by comparing the same 

against the corresponding funds transferred. 

 

1.59 In its letter reply dated April 28, 2021, the AFMS commented adjusting entries 

will be made to record the deliveries already made as soon as supporting 

documents are secured from PITC. Moreover, there is already an ongoing 

hiring of Contract of Service personnel who will specifically handle 

reconciliation tasks including the PITC account.  

 

b.7. Unrecorded liquidations from CHEDROs - ₱3,256,883.57 

 

1.60 The CHED-CO transfers funds to various CHEDROs for the implementation 

of its various programs such as student’s scholarships/study grants, travel and 

allowances of the regional staff as well as payment for utilities like water and 

electricity. These fund transfers are recorded in the books as debit to Due from 

ROs account. 
 



75 

 

1.61 The balance of Due from ROs account pertaining to CHEDROs I and VII 
amounting to ₱454,500.00 and ₱2,802,383.57, respectively, or a total of 

₱3,256,883.57, remained unliquidated in the books of accounts of CHED-CO 

although the LRs were already forwarded to the latter. Since these balances 

were already liquidated by the concerned CHEDROs, the Due from ROs and 

Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) accounts are therefore overstated by 

₱3,256,883.57. 
 

1.62 We recommended that the Management require the Chief Accountant of 
AFMS to verify the LRs submitted by CHEDROs I and VII and prepare 

the corresponding journal entries to record their liquidations. 

 

1.63 The Management, in its reply dated March 25, 2021, commented that 
verification will be made as soon as they receive the LRs from CHEDROs I 

and VII. 

 

b.8. Unrecorded/Erroneous recording of disallowances in CHEDRO VIII-
₱150,607.57 

 

1.64 The pertinent provisions of the 2009 Rules and Regulations on Settlement of 
Accounts (RRSA) prescribed under COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated 

September 15, 2019 are as follows: 

 

• The Notice of Finality of Decision (NFD) shall be issued by the authorized 
COA official to the agency head to notify that a decision has become final 

and executory, there being no appeal or motion for reconsideration filed 

within the reglementary period. 

 

• The Chief Accountant shall, on the basis of the NFD, record in the books 
of accounts the disallowance and/or charge as a receivable. 

 

• The COA Order of Execution (COE) shall be issued to enforce the 
settlement of an audit disallowance/charge, whenever the persons liable 

therefor refuse or fail to settle them after the decision has become final and 

executory. 

 

1.65 Also, Section 46, Chapter 6 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I provides that: 
 

“Disallowances shall be taken up in the books of accounts only 

when they become final and executory.  The accountant shall 

prepare the JEV to take up the Receivable – Disallowances/Charges 

and credit the appropriate account for the current year or 

Accumulated Surplus (Deficit) account if pertaining to expense of 

previous years.” 

 



76 

 

1.66 In CHEDRO VIII, audit disallowances with issued NFD amounting to 
₱53,275.00 were not yet taken up as Receivables-Disallowances/Charges. 

 

1.67 Likewise, transactions amounting to ₱97,334.57 which were disallowed in 
audit and issued with NFD were recorded under Due from Officers and 

Employees account instead of Receivables-Disallowances/Charges account. 
 

1.68 In view of the foregoing, the non-recording of audit disallowances as well as 
the erroneous recording of disallowances with finality of decision resulted in 

understatement of Receivables–Disallowances/Charges and Accumulated 

Surplus/(Deficit) accounts by ₱150,609.57 and ₱53,275.00, respectively, as 

well as overstatement by ₱97,334.57 of Due from Officers and Employees 

account. 
 

1.69 We recommended that the Management require the Accountant of 
CHEDRO VIII to: 

 

a. record the disallowance as debit to Receivables–Disallowances/ 
Charges account when they became final and executory pursuant to 

Section 22.6 of COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009; 

and 
 

b. make the appropriate adjusting entry in the books to reclassify to 
Receivables–Disallowances/Charges account the amount of 

disallowance previously issued with NFDs and recorded as Due from 

Officers and Employees. 

 

1.70 Management commented that the Accountant will immediately abide by the 
recommendation. In fact, some adjusting entries have already been recorded.  

 

b.9. Non-recognition of Interest Receivable earned on the SNPLP Repayments-
₱1,129,650.05 

 

1.71 The SNPLP is an educational program of the government designed to promote 
access to educational opportunities in the tertiary level to poor but deserving 

students through financial assistance in the form of educational loan. This 

special fund is used to finance loans to cover matriculation and other school 

fees and expenses for books, subsistence and board and lodging, among others. 

 

1.72 Analysis of the CHEDRO I FSs, Report of Collections and Deposits and 
Schedule of SNPLP Repayments revealed that the accrued 6% interests on 

overdue account balances of the grantees amounting to ₱1,129,650.05 were 

not recognized by the Accountant, thus the Interest Receivable and Accrued 

Interest Income accounts were not set up in the books which affects the fair 

presentation thereof in the Agency’s FSs. 
 



77 

 

1.73 We recommended that the Management require the Accountant in 

CHEDRO I to set up Interest Receivable account totaling ₱1,129,650.05 

to reflect the accrual of 6% interest per annum on the unpaid balance of 

each borrower. 

 

1.74 Management commented that to ensure that the interest receivable to be 

recognized in the books is the correct amount, they committed to monitor the 

updating of the ledgers so that applicable adjusting entries will be recognized 

in the books for the fair presentation of FSs. Also, for FY 2020, interest income 

amounting to ₱217,097.25 from the collections from SNPLP grantees with 

completed payments was recognized in the books of accounts.

c) Misstatements in Inventories Account - ₱3,261,801.14

c.1. Unrecorded inventory issuances and transfers - ₱4,617,951.14 

 

1.76 Section 10, Chapter 8 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I provides that tangible 

items below the capitalization threshold of ₱15,000.00 shall be accounted as 

semi-expendable property. Moreover, Section 10 (b) thereof provides that 



78 

 

these tangible items shall be recognized as expenses upon issuance to the end-

user. 

 

1.77 For the year ended, issuances of accountable forms and semi-expendable 

properties to end-users in CHEDROs VI and VIII totaling ₱4,617,951.14 

remained unrecorded in the books. Details are shown below:

Amount 
(In Php) 

VI Certification, Authentication and Verification (CAV) Forms 
which have been non-moving in the books since CY 2019 
despite the fact that issuance of CAV Forms is one of the 
regular functions of the agency. The non-recording of already 
issued accountable forms is attributable to the failure of the 
Property and Supply Section to regularly submit to the 
Accounting Section the monthly Report of Supplies and 
Materials Issued (RSMI) for issued CAV Forms as well as the 
absence of periodic reconciliation of Accounting and Property 
records. 

1,050,000.00 

VIII Audit inquiry conducted on January 26, 2021 to designated 
Property Officer disclosed that all semi-expendables 
purchased were immediately issued to intended users 
evidenced by the issuance of Inventory Custodian Slips 
(ICSs). However, the Property Officer did not prepare and 
submit the RSMI to the Accountant, which is the basis of the 
latter in recording the inventory issuances, thus overstating the 
balance of semi-expendable property accounts while 
understating the corresponding expense account by 
₱3,567,951.14 as of December 31, 2020. 

3,567,951.14 

Total 4,617,951.14 

 

1.78 We recommended that the Management of CHEDROs VI and VIII: 
 

a. require the designated Supply/Property Officer to prepare the RSMI 
and promptly submit to the Accountant as basis in recording of 

inventory issuances; 
 

b. require the Accountant to prepare the necessary adjusting entries to 
recognize as expense the inventories already issued based on the RSMI 

submitted by the designated Supply/Property Officer; and 

 

c. direct the Accountant and the designated Supply/Property Officer to 
conduct periodic reconciliation of records to establish the correct 

balance of Inventory accounts at any given time. 

 

 

 

 



79 

 

1.79 Management gave the following comments: 
 

CHEDRO Comments 

VI The Management assures that all recommendations therein shall be strictly 
implemented. Further, appropriate corrective measures shall be undertaken 

immediately relative to the noted deficiencies in compliance with GAM for 

NGAs. 

VIII The designated Supply Officer is presently updating the records. In fact, a 
Job Order employee was assigned to assist her in the preparation of the 

required report for submission to the Accountant and COA. As agreed upon, 

the designated Supply Officer will submit the same on or before July 30, 

2021. 

 

c.2. Erroneous recording of purchased inventories - ₱1,356,150.00 
 

1.80 Audit disclosed that various purchases of inventories and semi-expendable 
properties in CHEDRO IV-A totaling ₱1,356,150.00 were recorded as debit to 

Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) account instead of the appropriate 

asset/inventories account. These transactions were obligated in CY 2019 and 

paid in CY 2020. Also, these were delivered in CY 2020 except for executive 

chairs totaling ₱107,000.00 which was delivered in 2019.The failure of the 

CHEDRO IV-A to recognize the appropriate asset/inventories accounts 

understated the following accounts: 

 

Accounts Understated Amount (In Php) 

Semi-Expendable ICT Equipment  808,300.00 

Semi-Expendable Office Equipment 14,500.00 

Semi-Expendable Furniture and Fixtures 107,000.00 

Office Supplies Inventory and Accountable Forms 6,350.00 

Plates and Stickers Inventory 420,000.00 

Total 1,356,150.00 

 
1.81 We recommended that Management direct the Accountant of CHEDRO 

IV-A to prepare adjusting entries to recognize the purchase of semi-
expendable items and inventory in the books of account. 

 

1.82 Management commented that it will instruct the Accountant to prepare 
necessary adjusting entries to properly account for inventory and to always 
revisit the GAM for NGAs, to be guided accordingly in recognizing and 
recording all the transactions of the Agency.

d.1. Unrecorded receipt of Generator Set transferred by HEDFS – ₱1,517,446.17 
 

1.84 Records show that in October 2018, one Generator Set amounting to 
₱1,517,446.17 was transferred from Fund 151 (HEDFS) to Fund 101. The 

AFMS failed to record the receipt of said transfer, however, this was already 

dropped in Fund 151 through JEV-2018-10-004808; hence, understating the 

Other Machinery and Equipment account by the same amount. 

 

1.85 We recommended that the Management require the Chief Accountant of 
AFMS to record the cost of one Generator Set, including the freight and 

service cost charged by DBM-PS, transferred by HEDFS. 

 

d.2. Unrecorded PPE items but included in the physical count – ₱3,726,377.78 
 

1.86 In CHED-CO, PPE items totaling ₱3,726,377.78 were not recorded in the 
books although included in the physical count, as follows:

Total 3,726,377.78 

 

1.87 We recommended that the Management: 
 

a. require the Property Officer to submit to the Accounting Division all 
the documents in support of the physically counted PPEs but not yet 

recorded in the books; and 
 

b. require the Chief Accountant of AFMS to immediately record the 
deliveries upon submission by the Property Officer of the DRs, IAR 

and other supporting documents. 

 

d.3. Unrecorded PPEs located in Private HEIs (PHEIs) – ₱2,789,674.46 
 

1.88 Article II of the MOA on Discovery-Applied Research and Extension for 
Trans/Inter-disciplinary Opportunities (DARE-TO) and Philippine Higher 

Education Research Network (PHERNet) states that: 

 

“In the event that the grant/project shall include provision for 

equipment and facilities, the CHED reserves the right of ownership 



82 

 

over the purchased equipment and facilities covered by the 

grant/project until full liquidation by the Lead HEI is completed. The 

Lead HEI shall ensure proper labeling and inventory of the 

equipment and facilities. Transfer of ownership of the said equipment 

and facilities in favor of the Lead HEI shall ensue upon issuance of 

Invoice Receipt of property by the CHED, or completion of any other 

required accounting and audit procedure for this purpose.” 

 

1.89 Review of liquidations of three PHEIs disclosed inclusion of purchases of 
equipment totaling ₱2,789,674.46. These PPE items were recorded by CHED 

under Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) account instead of recognizing the same 

as PPE. Details are as follows:

1.90 The recording of purchases of equipment under Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) 
account would not only understate the corresponding PPE account, but also 

render it difficult to monitor the PPEs which ownership could be transferred 

to the implementing HEIs after full liquidation of the fund transfer. 

 

1.91 We recommended that the Management require the Chief Accountant of 
HEDFS to reclassify the cost of PPE purchased by the three HEIs from 

Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) account to the appropriate PPE account. 



83 

 

1.92 In a letter dated June 16, 2021, HEDFS commented that it has informed the 

Officer-in-Charge in the implementation of the DARE-TO project to elevate 

this concern to the Commission en Banc (CEB) for decision, either to donate 

the PPE to HEIs or retain the ownership of these equipment to CHED. 

 
d.4. Non-derecognition of unserviceable, lost and damaged assets – ₱11,093,906.95 

 

1.93 Section 41, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs provides the following 
accounting policies on loss of property: 

 

“a. When a loss of government funds or property occurs while they 

are in transit or the loss is caused by fire, theft, or other casualty or 

force majeure, the officer accountable therefore or having custody 

thereof shall immediately notify the Commission or the auditor 

concerned and, within thirty days or such longer period as the 

Commission or auditor may in the particular case allow, shall 

present his applicable for relief, with the available supporting 

evidence. Whenever warranted by the evidence, credit for the loss 

shall be allowed. An officer who fails to comply with this requirement 

shall not be relieved of liability or allowed credit for any loss in the 

settlement of his accounts. 

 

b. Lost property and the related accumulated depreciation and 

impairment loss shall be derecognized in the books upon receipt of 

the Report of Lost, Stolen, Damaged, Destroyed Property (RLSDDP) 

supported by a Notice of Loss prepared and submitted by the 

Accountable Officer. The loss shall be charged to account “Loss of 

Assets” at an amount equal to its carrying amount.” 

 

1.94 On May 7, 2014, a fire occurred in CHED-CO Server Room, which damaged 
all the properties stored therein. Audit revealed that of the burned PPE and 

semi-expendable items of ₱12,131,266.95, various PPE with an aggregate 

acquisition cost of ₱11,093,906.95 and its related accumulated depreciation 

were still not dropped/derecognized from the HEDFS record.  

 

1.95 The said recording of loss could not be made by the HEDFS since to date, the 
Accountable Officer (AO) has not yet submitted the RLSDDP together with 

the Notice of Loss. 

 

1.96 We recommended that the Management require the Chief Accountant of 
HEDFS to: 

 

a. set up receivable from the AOs to record their accountabilities over 
the lost properties; and 

 



84 

 

b. derecognize the cost and accumulated depreciation of assets lost 
through fire upon receipt of RLSDDP from the AO. 

 

1.97 In a letter dated June 16, 2021, HEDF commented that it has already 
coordinated with the AO to submit the required documents such as Report of 

Lost, Stolen, Damaged, Destroyed Property (RLSDPP) and Notice of Loss as 

basis to drop the PPE in the books of accounts and clear her accountabilities. 
 

d.5. Non-derecognition of PPE items already transferred to CHEDROs/SUCs/HEIs 
– ₱38,328,772.12 

 

1.98 Audit revealed that PPE items totaling ₱38,328,772.12 were still recorded in 
the books of HEDFS although these were already transferred/donated to 

CHEDROs/SUCs/HEIs, as shown below: 

 
PPE items already transferred but not yet derecognized 

Account Cost (In Php) 

Motor Vehicles 6,090,875.22 

Office Equipment 516,795.34  

ICT Equipment 23,075,264.96  

Furniture and Fixtures 213,314.00  

Other PPEs 381,699.10 

Various PPE accounts 8,050,823.50  

Total 38,328,772.12 

 

1.99 The amount of ₱8,050,823.50 pertains to transferred equipment to Laguna 
State Polytechnic University (LSPU) based on Property Transfer Report (PTR) 

No. 2019-02-001 dated February 7, 2019. 

 

1.100 We recommended that the Management require the Chief Accountant of 
HEDFS to drop from the books the cost of motor vehicles and various 

equipment that were already transferred/donated to CHEDROs/SUCs/ 

HEIs. 

 

1.101 In a letter dated June 16, 2021, HEDF commented that the IT Equipment 
already transferred to LSPU amounting to ₱6,697,286.29 was dropped in the 

HEDF books of accounts per JEV No. 2021-04-000868 dated April 30, 2021. 

 
d.6.  Non-capitalization of Freight Charges and Service Cost charged by DBM-PS – 

₱1,017,000.00 
 

1.102 Section 5, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I provides that: 
 

“Sec. 5. Measurement at Recognition. PPE that qualifies for 
recognition as an asset shall be measured at cost. However, where 
the PPE is acquired through a non-exchange transaction, its cost 



85 

 

shall be measured at its fair value as at the date of acquisition. The 
cost of an item of PPE comprises: (Pars. 30 and 31, PPSAS 217)  

 

a. Purchase price, including import duties and non-refundable 
purchase taxes, after deducting trade discounts and rebates;  

 

b. Any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the 
location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating 
in the manner intended by management. 
Examples of directly attributable costs are:  

 

1. Costs of employee benefits arising directly from the 
construction or acquisition of the item of PPE;  

 

This shall be limited to salaries and benefits of employees 
directly involved in the project delivery (example: project 
management or construction)  

2. Costs of site preparation;  
 

3. Initial delivery and handling costs;  
 

4. Installation and assembly costs;  
 

5. Costs of testing whether the asset is functioning properly, 
after deducting the net proceeds from selling any items 
produced while bringing the asset to that location and 
condition (such as samples produced when testing 
equipment); and  

 

6. Professional fees.” 
 

1.103 Audit revealed that Freight Charges amounting to ₱1,017,000.00 was recorded 
by HEDFS under Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) account instead of 

capitalizing the same as part of the total cost of 14 Generator Sets purchased 

from DBM-PS, hence understating the Other Machinery and Equipment 

account by the same amount. 

 

1.104 It should also be noted that these 14 Generator Sets were already transferred 
to the 13 CHEDROs and Fund 101 of CHED-CO. These items were already 

dropped from the HEDFS record, however, since the freight charges by              

DBM-PS were not capitalized, the individual cost recorded in the books of the 

13 CHEDROs is short by the same amount.   

 

1.105 We recommended that the Management require the Chief Accountant of 
HEDFS to notify the Accountants of CHED-CO/CHEDROs to capitalize 

the freight charges and service cost charged by DBM-PS on the purchase 

of Generator Sets. 

 
2 Ibid 



86 

 

1.106 In a letter dated June 16, 2021, the HEDFS commented that a JEV Nos. 2021-
04-000836 dated April 30, 2021 were prepared to capitalize the freight charges 

charged by DBM-PS on the purchase of Generator sets that were delivered to 

CHEDROs/CHED-CO.  
 

d.7. Unserviceable properties not yet derecognized – ₱2,321,959.43 
 

1.107 Section 40, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs provides the following policies 
on unserviceable and fully depreciated PPE: 
 

“c. A PPE is said to be unserviceable if it is no longer capable of 
providing the entity with future economic benefits or service 
potential. 

 

d.  All unserviceable property shall be reported in the Inventory 
and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP). PPE 
reported in the IIRUP shall be dropped from the books by 
debiting Impairment Loss-Property, Plant and Equipment (cost 
of the PPE less Accumulated Depreciation).” 

 

1.108 In CHEDROs CAR and VII, assets which were already evaluated by the 
Management as unserviceable or beyond economic repair remained in the 

books and not disposed of due to non-preparation of the IIRUP. Details are 

shown below: 
 

Unserviceable PPEs 

CHEDRO Specific PPE Account Cost (In Php) 

CAR ICT Equipment 353,070.00

VII Office, ICT Equipment, Communications Equipment, 
Motor Vehicles and Furniture and Fixtures 

1,864,772.43 

Total 2,321,959.43 

 
1.109 We recommended that the Management: 

 

a. require the Property/Supply Officers in CHEDROs CAR and VII to 
report in the IIRUP the unserviceable assets and thereafter submit the 
same to the Accounting Office; and 
 

b. require the Accountants to prepare the corresponding journal entry 
to derecognize the unserviceable assets from the books of accounts 
upon submission of the IIRUP by the Property/Supply Officer.  

 

1.110 Management commented that: 

 

CHEDRO Comments 

CAR Management agreed to comply with the audit recommendations. 



87 

 

CHEDRO Comments 

VII Management commented that they already created a Disposal Committee to 

undertake the disposal of the unserviceable properties to be listed in the 

IIRUP. 

 

d.8. Erroneous Journal entries – ₱440,491.00 

 

1.111 Erroneous recording and classification of purchased PPE items in CHEDROs 
II and VIII resulted in net understatement of ₱440,491.00 in PPE accounts, as 

shown below:

1.112 We recommended that the Management direct the Accountants of 
CHEDROs II and VIII to make the necessary adjusting entries to correct 

the erroneous journal entries made. 

 

1.113 The Management commented, thus: 
 

CHEDRO Comments 

II The Accountant having gone through the report/findings acknowledged the 
errors made and will immediately reclassify the affected PPE accounts. For 

the properties that were not deducted depreciation expenses, management will 

reflect/deduct such depreciation expenses as recommended. 

VIII The Accountant will abide by the audit recommendations. 

 

d.9. Non-provision of Depreciation – ₱104,766.58 
 

1.114 Section 27, Chapter 10, Volume 1 of GAM provides that: 
 

“PPE gradually loses its ability to provide service over the course of 

time. Because of this, its cost needs to be distributed on a systematic 

basis over its useful life. The allocated cost is referred to as 

depreciation. The depreciation charge for each period shall be 



88 

 

recognized as expense unless it is included in the carrying amount of 

another asset.” 

 

1.115 Paragraph 71 of IPSAS 17 further provides that: 
 

“Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use, i.e., 

when it is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable 

of operating in the manner intended by management.” 

 

1.116 Based on the analysis and re-computation performed by the Audit Team of 
CHEDRO VIII, the amount of depreciation recognized in the books is 

understated by ₱104,766.58, which consequently overstated the carrying 

amount of the affected PPE accounts by the same amount. The breakdown is 

shown below:  

 

Under-provision of Depreciation  

Specific PPE Account Depreciation (In Php) 

Communications Equipment 80,331.58 

Motor Vehicles 24,435.00 

Total 104,766.58 

 

1.117 We recommended that the Management require the Accountant of 
CHEDRO VIII to compute the correct amount of depreciation and make 

the necessary adjustments in the books. Henceforth, depreciation for all 

depreciable assets must be provided to ensure fair presentation of the 

related PPE accounts in the FSs. 

 

1.118 Management commented that the Accountant will abide by the 
recommendations of the Audit Team.

e.1. Non-accrual of Tuition Fees for reimbursement to SUCs/LUCs – ₱284,899,503.50 
 

1.120 Section 2.a, Chapter 2, Volume I of GAM for NGAs defines Accrual basis as 
a basis of accounting under which transactions and other events are recognized 

when they occur (and not only when cash or its equivalent is received or paid). 

Therefore, the transactions and events are recognized in the accounting records 

and recognized in the financial statements of the periods to which they relate. 

 

1.121 All students availing themselves of the Free Higher Education (FHE) Program 
shall be entitled to free tuition and miscellaneous, other school fees, and 

similar or related fees. Under the Billing System, the SUCs/LUCs submit FHE 

Billings to CHED which shall then be the basis of the latter in reimbursing the 

cost of tuition and other fees. 

 

1.122 In CHED-CO, the AFMS did not accrue at year-end the tuition fees 
payable/reimbursable to 21 SUCs/LUCs for the 1st Semester of AY 2020-2021 

in total amount of ₱284,899,503.50. The CHED should have recognized at 

year-end the amount of tuition fees payable to SUCs/LUCs since the 1st 

Semester has been completed and there is already a present obligation on the 

part of CHED to pay/reimburse/settle the claims. Therefore, the failure to 

accrue understated the balances of Due to NGAs and related expense accounts 

as of year-end by a total amount of ₱284,899,503.50, broken down as follows: 
 

SUC/LUC Amount (In Php) 

1. Pangasinan State University 17,296,465.00 

2. University of Eastern Pangasinan 1,681,500.00 

3. Cagayan State University 78,383,790.00

20. Compostela Valley State College 48,427,300.00 

21. University of Southeastern Philippines 300.00 

Total 284,899,503.50 
 

1.123 We recommended that the Management require the Chief Accountant of 
AFMS to adhere to Accrual basis of accounting by recognizing as payable 

the amount of tuitions fees for reimbursement to SUCs/LUCs as of year-
end.  

 
1.124 In its reply dated April 28, 2021, the AFMS commented that the 

recommendation is still for compliance.   
 

e.2. Unrecorded cancellation of stale checks as of year-end – ₱32,490.00 
 

1.125 Section 44, Chapter 6 of the GAM for NGAs states that a stale, voided or 
spoiled check shall be marked cancelled on its face and reported as follows: 

 

“a. Voided, spoiled or unclaimed stale checks with the Cashier shall 
be reported as cancelled in the List of Unreleased Checks that will 
be attached to the RCI. 

 

b. New checks may be issued for the replacement of stale/spoiled 
checks in the hands of the payees or holders in due course, upon 
submission of the stale/spoiled checks to the Accounting 
Division/Unit. A certified copy of the previously paid DVs shall be 
attached to the request for replacement. A JEV shall be prepared to 
take up the cancellation. The replacement check shall be reported in 
the RCI.” 
 

1.126 In CHED-CO, stale MDS checks totaling ₱32,490.00 remained uncancelled as 
of year-end, hence understating the balance of Accounts Payable by the same 
amount. 



91 

 

1.127 We recommended that the Management require the Chief Accountant of 
HEDFS to prepare adjusting entry/ies to record the cancellation of stale 

MDS checks. 

 
1.128 In a letter dated April 7, 2021, the HEDFS informed the Audit Team that JEV 

No. 2021-02-000375 dated February 26, 2021 was prepared and approved to 
set-up Accounts Payable of stale MDS checks issued in prior year. 

 
e.3. Various errors in recording – ₱40,753,085.00 

 
1.129 In CHED-CO, the Audit Team noted the erroneous journal entry made by 

AFMS on the cancellation of MDS Check No. 1474115 dated March 19, 2020 
amounting to ₱33,853,085.00 pertaining to payment for TES for summer 2nd 
Tranche of 1st Semester of AY 2018-2019 under UAQTE, which was taken up 
per JEV No. 2020-03-003260. The erroneous journal entry resulted in the 
overstatement of Accounts Payable by ₱33,853,085.00 and understatement of 
Subsidy from National Government account by the same amount. 
 

1.130 While in CHEDRO VIII, Due to Central Office balance totaling 
₱26,480,000.00 as of December 31, 2020 is overstated by ₱6,900,000.00 due 
to erroneous journal entry in recording various transactions, thereby affecting 
the fair presentation of the related accounts in the FSs. 
 

1.131 We recommended that the Management instruct the Accountant of 
AFMS to prepare adjusting entry/ies to correct the errors noted in order 

to reflect the accurate balances of the accounts affected in the financial 
statements. 

 
1.132 In a letter dated April 21, 2021, the HEDFS commented that the erroneous 

journal entry on the cancellation of MDS check was adjusted per JEV No. 
2021-03-000791 dated March 31, 2021. 

 

 

EXPENSES ACCOUNT 

 

f) Misstatements in Expenses account-₱1,118,849,577.87 
 

1.133 Chapter3 of GAM for NGAs, Volume III, provides the description of the 
following accounts:    

 

• Due from National Government Agencies (NGAs) - This account is used 
to recognize advances for purchase of goods/services as authorized by law, 
fund transfers to the NGAs for implementation of projects and other 
receivables from NGAs. Credit this account upon receipt of 
goods/services, and liquidation of fund transfers/receivables. 
 

• Due from Non-Government Organizations/ People's Organizations 
(NGOs/POs) - This account is used to recognize amount of advances 



92 

 

granted to NGOs/POs for implementation of specific projects.  Credit this 
account for liquidation of advances. 

 

• Scholarship Grants/Expenses - This account is used to recognize the costs 
of scholarships granted by the government to individuals in the pursuit of 
further learning, study or research. This account shall be closed to the 
Revenue and Expense Summary account. 

 

1.134 As of December 31, 2020, the Scholarship Grants/Expenses account in 
CHEDRO VI has a balance of ₱1,204,115,382.87, summarized as follows: 

 

Mode of Distribution Amount (In Php) 

Direct to Scholars   100,505,805.00 
Thru SUCs/LUCs   287,303,000.00  
Thru PHEIs   816,306,577.87 
Total 1,204,115,382.87 

 

1.135 The scholarship grants were either released directly to qualified students using 
Landbank Cards, or thru the HEIs which were responsible in releasing the 

grants to the students thru a Payroll.   

 

1.136 It was observed, however, that all releases for scholarships, whether paid 
directly to the students or thru the participating HEIs, were all recorded 

outright as Scholarship Grants/Expenses. 

 

1.137 It was clearly provided that the releases to the participating HEIs were subject 
to liquidation, thus a Receivable account should have been debited upon the 

release of the grants to the HEIs and the Scholarship Grants/Expenses only 

recorded after submission of liquidation documents. 

 

1.138 Out of the ₱1,204,115,382.87 recorded Scholarship Grants/Expenses, only 
₱100,505,805.00 should have been recorded as direct expense. The 

₱287,303,000.00 and ₱816,306,577.87 or a total of ₱1,103,609,577.87 should 

have been debited to Due from NGAs and Due from NGOs/POs, respectively, 

to establish the receivables from HEIs. 

 

1.139 Similarly, review of DVs pertaining to the payment of Bayanihan 2 for Higher 
Education Tulong Program (B2HELP) grants to various HEIs as at December 

31, 2020 in CHEDRO XI disclosed that the assistance amounting to 

₱15,240,000.00 were not properly recorded. CHED Memorandum Order 

(CMO) No. 10, s. 2020 requires the submission of LRs to CHEDROs within 

15 working days upon receipt of payment and shall submit hard copies within 

30 working days upon receipt of payment. The payments were directly charged 

to Scholarship/Grants Expenses account instead of recognizing it to the 

appropriate Receivable accounts despite the requirement on submission of 

LRs. 

 



93 

 

1.140 Inquiry disclosed that it has been the Agency’s practice of directly recognizing 
grants under the Scholarship/Grants Expenses account despite the 

requirements of liquidating the grants by qualified students/HEIs. 

 

1.141 Recognizing the grants under the B2HELP as direct expense may preclude 
further validation and monitoring. The Agency might have no more 

reason/basis to monitor the utilization of the fund at the HEIs end as there are 

no recorded receivables. In order to effectively monitor the submission of LRs 

from the HEIs, the disbursements should have been recognized as Receivables 

under the following accounts: for SUCs and LUCs – Due from NGAs account 

and for PHEIs – Due from NGO/POs account. 

 

1.142 The foregoing error resulted in the overstatement of the Scholarship 
Expense/Grants Expenses account by ₱15,240,000.00 with corresponding 

understatement of the Due from National Government Agencies and the Due 

from NGO/POs accounts by ₱2,919,338.04 and ₱12,320,661.96, respectively. 

 

1.143 We recommended that the Management require the Accountants in 
CHEDROs VI and XI to: 

 

a. prepare JEVs to reclassify and recognize as Receivables those grants 
that require liquidation using the accounts Due from NGAs for 

SUCs/LUCs and Due from NGO/POs for PHEIs; and 
 

b. monitor and review the recording of transactions based on the existing 
guidelines to ensure that correct journal entries and appropriate 

accounts are used. 

 

1.144 The Management commented that: 
 

CHEDRO Comments 

VI The Management shall take necessary measures to correct the errors in 

recording relative to the accuracy and existence of ₱1,204,115,382.87 recorded 
Scholarship Grants/Expenses, hence the recommendations therein as specified 

shall be strictly complied with. 
 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

The Audit Team shall validate compliance with the recommendations. 

XI The Accountant already reclassified the B2HELP scholarship grant as of 
February 2021. Furthermore, the Accountant submitted a copy of the required 

JEV to the Office of the Auditor on March 4, 2021. 

 
There shall only be one preparer of DVs from the requesting units to ensure 

the accuracy of entries. Moreover, the Accountant was directed to observe due 
diligence in reviewing all DVs prior to approval for payment and strictly 

comply with the audit recommendations.

Other Accounting and Property Controls Deficiencies 
 

2. Various accounting deficiencies were noted affecting the reliability of  CHED’s 
Cash, Receivables, Inventories and PPE accounts, such as: a) delayed/non-
submission of Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS); b) delay in deposit of 

collections and keeping of related records; c) inadequate monitoring and 
incorrect valuation of receivables; d) non-adherence to Perpetual Inventory 

System whereby purchases totaling ₱5,690,179.43 were directly charged to 

Expenses account; e) absence of or incomplete physical count of inventories/PPE 
and non-submission of Inventory Report; f) misclassification of accounts;                         

g) discrepancy of ₱1,781,606,036.01 between the balance of Receivables account 

per books and per confirmation in CHED-CO and CHEDROs NCR and IV-B; 
h) unreconciled variance of ₱789,970,703.63 between the balance of PPE 

accounts per accounting records and physical count in CHED-CO and 

CHEDROs V, VI, VIII, X and XIII; and i) deficient  inventory and property 
management control systems. 

 

2.1 Section 6, Chapter 19 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I enumerates the 
qualitative characteristics of financial reporting. Among which, are reliability, 

faithful representation and completeness, defined as follows: 

 

“Reliability – reliable information is free from material error and 

bias, and can be depended on by the users to represent faithfully that 

which it purports to represent or could reasonably be expected to 

represent.” 

 

“Faithful representation – information to represent faithfully 

transactions and other events, it should be presented in accordance 

with the substance of the transactions and other events, and not 

merely their legal form.” 
 

“Completeness – the information in FSs should be complete within 

the bounds of materiality and cost.” 

 

2.2 Section 111, Chapter 2 of PD No. 1445 provides the following: 
 

“(1) The accounts of an agency shall be kept in such detail as is 

necessary to meet the needs of the agency and at the same time be 

adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or control 

agencies of the government. 
 

(2) The highest standards of honesty, objectivity and consistency 

shall be observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against 

inaccurate or misleading information.” 

 

 

 



95 

 

a) Delayed/Non-submission of BRS 
 

2.3 Section 3, Chapter 21 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I provides that the BRS 
shall be prepared in order to:  

 

a. check correctness of both the bank’s and agency’s/entity’s records,  
b. serve as a deterrent to fraud, and  
c. enable the agency/entity or bank to take up charges or credits recognized 

by the bank or agency/entity but not yet known to the agency/entity or 

bank.  
 

2.4 Also, Section 5, Chapter 21 of the same Manual states that “the Chief 
Accountant/Designated Staff shall within 10 days from receipt of the monthly 

Bank Statement (BS) together with the paid checks, original copies of Debit 

Memoranda (DM)/Credit Memoranda (CM) from the Government Servicing 

Bank, reconcile the BS with the General Ledger and prepare the BRS in four 

copies.” 

 

2.5 Section 7 thereof states that “the Chief Accountant shall submit the BRS 
together with all the supporting documents and JEVs, within 20 days after 

receipt of the monthly BS to COA Auditor.” 

 

2.6 The balances of Cash accounts of CHED could not be ascertained or of 
doubtful reliability in view of the delayed or non-submission of BRS by 

CHED-CO and CHEDROs III, V, and VIII, as follows: 
 

Office/ 

CHEDRO 
Observation 

CO Despite the previous year audit recommendations, delayed or non-submission 

of BRSs was consistently observed by the Audit Team, which consequently 

delayed the verification thereof and the correction of errors, if any, hence 

casting doubt on the reliability of the year-end balance of Cash accounts. 

III Records show that the last submitted BRSs for its six bank accounts were for 

the month of July 2020.The late submission of BRS is a perennial audit finding 

on the Agency. Despite issuance of a number of Audit Observation 

Memoranda, the reports remained not updated. For this reason, the accuracy 

and validity of the balances of the Cash-MDS, Regular and Cash in Bank-

LCCA could not be ascertained. 

V CHEDRO V was only able to submit the BRS for its two MDS Accounts 

(MDS 2013-9020-71 and MDS 2013-9021-28) covering the period January 

2019 to June 2020, while no monthly BRS was submitted for MDS Account 

2013-9042-11 and LCCA Account 0132-0186-18 from January to December 

of CYs 2019 and 2020.  

VIII The Accounting Unit did not regularly prepare and submit the BRS together 

with supporting documents to validate the accuracy of the year-end balance of 

its Cash accounts.  The omission in proving through duly prepared and audited 

BRS including the undertaking of adjustments in case of any existing error, 

affected the reliability and accuracy of the Agency’s Cash in Bank-LCCA 

year-end balance of ₱3,296,465.89 



96 

 

2.7 The delayed/non-submission of BRS on the bank accounts maintained by the 
concerned CHED Offices precluded the Audit Teams from immediately 

verifying the correctness of the reported cash in bank balances as of a particular 

period. 

 

2.8 We recommended that the Management require the Accountants in 
CHED-CO, and CHEDROs III, V, and VIII to: 

 

a. make representation with the banks to timely furnish the Agency with 
the monthly Bank Statement; and 

 

b. prepare and submit monthly BRS in accordance with the timeline 
provided in GAM for NGAs, Volume I to facilitate the review and 

preparation of necessary adjustments thereof. 

 

2.9 The Management commented thus: 
 

Office/ 

CHEDRO 
Comments 

CO In a letter dated April 7, 2021, the HEDFS commented that they will require 

the Land bank of the Philippines (LBP) and DBP to timely furnish the HEDFS 

the monthly bank statements to ensure the submission of monthly BRS to 

COA within the set timeline prescribed under the GAM. 
 

AFMS commented that BRS for all accounts were submitted as of April 28, 

2021. 
III The Accountant mentioned that they will request monthly snapshots from 

LBP to facilitate fast preparation of BRS. He and the Cashier even informed 

the Manager of their depository bank that the eMDS has no facility in viewing 

checks issued. The issue will be raised with LBP’s Central Office. 

V The complete set of BRS for the MDS Account Nos. 2013-9020-71 and 2013-

9021-28 has already been forwarded to the Audit Team as of February 28, 

2021. On the other hand, LBP MDS Account No. 2013-9042-11 is a Special 

MDS sub-account previously maintained specifically for the payment of 

Retirement Gratuity and Terminal Leave (RG/TL) Benefits of CHEDRO 

employees. The said account has already been closed pursuant to Section 2.2 

of DBM Circular Letter No. 2018-4 dated January 24, 2018, hence BRS was 

no longer being prepared. Further, the delayed preparation and submission of 

the BRS for LCCA Account No. 0132-0186-18 is partly due to the delay on 

the part of the LBP in providing the copy of the Bank Statement to the Agency. 

Nevertheless, Management, particularly the Accounting Unit, acknowledged 

its failure to comply with aforementioned policies of the GAM and hereafter 

avoid the same circumstances. 

VIII The Accountant will cause the regular reconciliation. In fact, the Accountant 

and the Cashier have already made representation to the bank for the timely 

release of Bank Statements. 

 
 

 



97 

 

b) Delay on deposit of collections and keeping of related records 
 

2.10 Section 39(a), Chapter 5 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I provides that “at 
the close of the business day, the Collecting Officers shall prepare the Report 

of Collections and Deposits (RCD) for submission to Accounting Office/Unit.”  

Item D of the Instruction on the use of the RCD further states: 
 

“Collections should be deposited intact daily. The balance of 

collections not deposited during the day due to cut-off should be 

deposited on the first banking hour of the next working day.” 

 

2.11 Appendix 34 of the GAM, Volume II provides that:  
 

“The CkADADRec shall be maintained by each 

Disbursing/Accountable Officer, by fund cluster, to record/monitor 

all checks drawn (MDS or Commercial) and ADAs issued by him/her 

during the day. Whether released or unreleased, checks/ADAs shall 

be recorded immediately and the NCA/Bank balance shall be 

extracted.” 
 

2.12 Based on audit, the following are the deficiencies noted in the records of 
CHEDROs CAR and IV-A: 

 

CHEDRO Deficiency 

CAR Deposits of collections amounting to ₱42,062.16 were delayed by 87 to 140 
days. According to the AO, the checks were in the name of CHED-CAR, 

however, the BTr would not accept the remittance unless the checks were 

issued in the name of the BTr. To remedy the situation, the Cash Clerk 

deposited the collections in the bank account of the Trust Fund and drew 

another check in the name of the BTr for remittance. 

 

On the other hand, the balance per CkADADRec of ₱9,351,595.60 is doubtful 

in view of the failure of the AO to account for several reconciling items per 

Bank Statement. Effective Cash management requires adherence to the 

monitoring system that is contained in the CkADADRec. All columns must 

be filled-up properly, and the bank balance must be accurate at all times. 

IV-A Collections not deposited on the next banking day amounting from ₱7,500.00 
to ₱682,955.60, the number of days delay in making the deposits ranges from 

one to 47 days. 
 

According to the Regional Cashier, the undeposited collections for a long 

period of time was due to the unavailability of means of transportation brought 

about by the pandemic, however, the safekeeping of the collections inside a 

cabinet and not in a safety vault posed risk in safeguarding the assets of the 

Agency. 

 

 



98 

 

2.13 We recommended that the Management: 
 

a. require the concerned AO in CHEDRO CAR to: 
 

• immediately draw checks in the name of the BTr for the amount of 
collections deposited in the Trust Fund, and remit the same to the 

BTr;   
 

• require the concerned AO to reconcile regularly the CkADADRec 
of all funds with the respective Bank Statements;  

 

CHEDRO IV-A 
 

b. instruct the Chief Administrative Officer to request budget for the 
requisition of safety vault and include it in the Annual Procurement 

Plan (APP); and  
 

c. advise the Cashier to ensure that all undeposited collections are safely 
kept in a safety vault. 

 

2.14 The Management of CHEDROs CAR and IV-A agreed to comply with the 
audit recommendations. 

 

c) Inadequate monitoring and incorrect valuation of receivables 
 

2.15 In the course of audit, the Audit Teams observed the following deficiencies or 
other practices affecting the reliability of the Receivable accounts, to wit: 

 

Summary of Other Deficiencies in Receivable Accounts  

CHEDRO Audit Observation 
Amount  
(In Php) 

NCR Existence of negative balance totaling ₱869,200.00 in the 
General Ledger (GL) balance of Due from NGOs/POs due to 

erroneous recording of transactions which remained 

unadjusted as of December 31, 2020, hence rendering the 

balance of the said account unreliable. 

(869,200.00) 

I Loans Receivable account was not presented at net realizable 
value due to non-provision for the Allowance of Impairment 

Loss due to lack of a clear policy in the computation of the 

said Allowance for Impairment Loss, which does not 

conform with Section 10, Chapter 7, of the GAM for NGAs 

and Chapter 3, Annex A of COA Circular No. 2020-01 dated 

January 08, 2020. 

40,257,977.08 

IV-A The accuracy and validity of the balance of Loans 
Receivable account amounting to ₱15,259,287.40 per latest 

submitted Trial Balance (TB) as of May 31, 2020 (Fund 101) 

could not be established due to the absence of Subsidiary 

Ledgers (SLs)/schedules, contrary to Section 114 of PD                

No. 1445. 

15,259,287.40 



99 

 

Summary of Other Deficiencies in Receivable Accounts  

CHEDRO Audit Observation 
Amount  
(In Php) 

The same audit observation and corresponding audit 

recommendation has been reported in the CY 2018 

Management Letter, therefore, the age of the account 

balances amounting to ₱15,523,275.00 did not reflect the 

exact age of the receivables. Moreover, the audit 

recommendation to this audit observation remained 

unimplemented to date. Likewise, the possibility of 

collection of the said receivables remained remote due to 

absence of detailed information. 
 
In addition, there was still no updated GL and TB submitted 

to the Audit Team for the months of June to November 2020, 

thus preventing the Audit Team of the timely review and 

evaluation of the reports. 
VI The composition of Receivables aggregating 

₱433,066,551.91 cannot be ascertained due to the absence of 

SLs or supporting schedules, contrary to Appendix 6 of the 

GAM for NGAs, Volume II, and Section 12, Chapter 2, 

Volume I of the same Manual, thus casting doubt on the 

validity and existence of the Receivable accounts as 

presented in the FSs. 

 
Without any information as to the source of the transaction 

or data available to determine the composition of the 

account, the validity of the account balance cannot be 

determined. 
 
Moreover, Due from NGAs and Due from NGOs/POs 

liquidations were not recorded despite the submission of LRs 

by the HEIs, thus the accounts remained 

outstanding/unliquidated in the books of the Agency. 

433,066,551.91 

VII The Accountant failed to prepare and maintain the SLs per 
student-borrower to support the Loans Receivable-Others 

balance of the SNPLP of ₱13,410,044.80 as of December 31, 

2020, contrary to Section 111 of PD No. 1445, thus rendering 

the existence and accuracy of the balances unreliable. 
 
According to the Accountant, she did not prepare the SLs 

since no schedules were turned over to her by the previous 

Accountant when she assumed office in year 2018. Some of 

the documents have to be located, to support the outstanding 

balances since the amounts recorded by the Scholarship Unit 

(SU) do not match with the books. The total amount reported 

by the SU is bigger than the total per Accounting records. 

However, the SU amount has no distinction as to how much 

belongs to HEDF and to the Regular Fund. This also added 

to the difficulty of the Accountant to properly establish the 

13,410,044.80 



100 

 

Summary of Other Deficiencies in Receivable Accounts  

CHEDRO Audit Observation 
Amount  
(In Php) 

balances in the books. Thus, the collections or the credit 

entries of the Loans Receivable-Others account were 

deducted solely from the Regular Fund. 
VIII The SNPLP loans granted to student-borrowers and HEIs 

recorded under Loans Receivable account in the total amount 

of ₱38,805,694.97 as of December 31, 2020 disclosed no 

records/documents pertaining to the actual date of grant, 

particulars, reference documents, address of the grantee and 

name of school and course of the grantee for unpaid loans of 

555 borrowers and seven HEIs totaling ₱19,543,509.20. It 

was presumed as aged 10 years over considering that the data 

were turned over by the previous Accountant in October of 

2011. 

19,543,509.20 

Discrepancy of ₱3,165,054.00 between the total amount of 

SAFE Loan per records in the Student Financial Assistance 

Program (StuFAPs) Unit vis-à-vis that of the Accounting 

Unit. The said difference pertains to the refund of ₱5,584.00 

per OR#1438508 of Northwest Samar State University but 

not recorded in the books and funds released to eight HEIs 

of ₱3,159,470.00 that were not reflected in the StuFAP Unit 

monitoring report. However, the supporting DVs and JEVs 

of said fund transfers could not be retrieved and located due 

to Typhoon Yolanda, thus precluded the validation by the 

Audit Team of the occurrence of the transaction. 

3,165,054.00 

XIII Existence of negative balances of ₱573,000.00 under Due 
from NGOs/POs account. 

573,000.00 

Unreconciled SL balance in the total amount of 

₱1,627,790.79 under Other Receivables account due to 

absence of available and traceable records. 

1,627,790.79 
 

 
Review of the SLs showed an outstanding receivable balance 

of ₱1,520,000.00 for two PHEIs which already closed their 

business and one HEI who is no longer accredited with the 

CHED. 

1,520,000.00 

Dates of grant were not indicated in the SLs of Loans 

Receivable account, thus aging of receivables could not be 

done. 

11,940,137.95 

 
2.16 We recommended that the Management require the Accountants or 

person-in-charge to: 
 

CHEDRO NCR 
 

a. perform account analysis to determine the nature of and substantiate 
the negative balances in Due from NGAs account; 

 

b. prepare necessary adjusting entries to correct the balances of the 
affected accounts; 



101 

 

CHEDRO I 
 

c. to cause the adoption of a clear policy on the computation of Allowance 
for Impairment Loss by requiring the SNPLP Coordinator to conduct 

assessment of the status of all student-borrowers and determine the 

collectability of those delinquent accounts at the end of each reporting 

period as provided under Section 10, Chapter 7 of the GAM for NGAs, 

Volume I; 
 

d. recognize Allowance for Impairment Loss account on the total 
outstanding loans receivable at year-end pursuant to Chapter 3, 

Annex A of COA Circular No. 2020-01 dated January 08, 2020 in 

order to present the Loans Receivable account at its net realizable 

value, thus fairly present the balances of the accounts in the FSs; 
 

CHEDROs IV-A and VI 
 

e. exert extra efforts to retrieve old records to establish the details of the 
reported receivable accounts and to prepare the SLs and detailed 

schedule of each receivable account; 
 

CHEDRO IV-A 
 

f. update the GL of Loans Receivable account and submit the same to 
the Audit Team;  

 

g. submit to the Audit Team the TB for the period June to November 
2020; 

 

CHEDRO VI 
 

h. prepare adjusting entries to record the liquidations based on the 
already submitted LRs by the HEIs; 

 

CHEDRO VII 
 

i. analyze the outstanding balances and coordinate with the SU to 
determine the data of each student-borrower like the date and amount 

granted, repayments, interest paid and interest accrued. Thereafter, 

prepare SL for each student-borrower; 
 

CHEDRO VIII 
 

j. maintain an updated SNPLP Masterlist/Database and reconcile 
records with the Accounting Unit and establish the details of the 

reported Loans Receivable vis-à-vis the student status to effect 

adjustments for any deficiency and enforce repayment scheme in 

accordance with the SNPLP contract; 

 



102 

 

CHEDRO XIII 
 

k. evaluate the composition of the unreconciled and negative balances in 
coordination with the program’s focal person who has the custody of 

pertinent files; and 
 

l. resend/send Demand Letters to closed institutions or non-CHED-
accredited institution and exhaust other means to increase the 

possibility of collecting the receivable account as one of the 

requirements in the request for write-off. 

 

2.17 The Management commented as follows: 
 

CHEDRO Comments 

I The recognition of Allowance for Impairment Loss is dependent on the result 

of the cleansing of Loans Receivable account. Therefore, the Management 

mandated the Accountant and the personnel in-charge of SNPLP to strictly 

coordinate with each other to hasten the cleansing of Loans Receivable which 

will be the basis in the recognition of appropriate interest receivable and 

allowance for impairment. 

 

As of date, 809 out of the 1,180 ledgers or 68.56% of the student loan grantees 

were already properly accounted and demand letters were already sent for the 

same.  

IV-A The Management will consider the recommendations of the Audit Team in 

order to improve compliance. The Management will instruct the Accounting 

Unit to exert extra efforts in retrieving old records of SAFE and SNPLP in order 

to facilitate reconciliation, thus provision of detailed schedule can be made and 

demand letters will be sent. The Accounting Unit has prepared already the TBs 

and will be provided to the Audit Team. 

VI The Management shall strictly implement all recommendations therein for the 

improvement of the system in the Finance Office and provided the following 

clarifications/comments: 

 

a. Loans Receivables of ₱48,682,350.00 pertains to the SNPLP Program which 
was implemented in CY 2012. 

b. Receivables from NGO for the TES in 2019 amounting to ₱286,752,000.00 
were liquidated by the HEIs concerned, however, the amounts pertaining 

thereto was inadvertently not reflected by the former Accountant. 

Nonetheless, necessary corrective action on the matter shall be taken. 

c. SLs shall be maintained from now on. 
d. Advances for Operating Expenses represent the fund transfer from HEDF 

amounting to ₱305,000.00, which was for the activity endorsed by CHED 

Internal Affairs Staff (IAS) to be conducted at Guimaras State College on 

March 12-13, 2020. However due to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) 

pandemic, it was cancelled, hence the check issued to the school was returned 

and subsequently became stale. The adjusting entry for the unutilized fund 

shall be recorded by the Accountant. 



103 

 

CHEDRO Comments 

VIII Management will abide by the recommendations of COA. As agreed, the 

concerned personnel of CHED will update its SNPLP Masterlist/Database and 

intensify its efforts to enforce payment. 

 

Management commented and as agreed, Accounting and StuFAP Units will 

reconcile their records ASAP. 

 

d) Non-adherence to Perpetual Inventory System 
 

2.18 Section 9, Chapter 8 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I provides that supplies 
and materials purchased for inventory purposes shall be recorded using the 

Perpetual Inventory System, as quoted below: 

 

“Perpetual Inventory Method.  Supplies and materials purchased 

for inventory purpose shall be recorded using the perpetual inventory 

system, resulting in a more accurate inventory records and a running 

total for the cost of goods sold in each period.  The system requires 

accounting records to show the amount of inventory on hand at all 

times through the maintenance of the SLC (Appendix 57) by the 

Accounting Division/Unit and Stock Card (SC) (Appendix 58) by the 

Supply and/or Property Division/Unit for each item in stock. Regular 

purchases shall be coursed through the inventory account and issues 

thereof shall be recorded as they take place except for supplies and 

materials purchased out of PCF for immediate use or on emergency 

cases which shall be charged directly to the appropriate expense 

accounts.” 

 

2.19 The Perpetual Inventory System requires that regular purchases shall be 
coursed through the inventory account and issuances thereof shall be recorded 

as they take place, except for supplies and materials purchased out of Petty 

Cash Fund for immediate use or on emergency cases which shall be charged 

directly to the appropriate expense accounts. Inventories are recognized as 

expense only when they are sold, exchanged, or distributed. 

 

2.20 Audit disclosed that purchases of supplies and materials in CHED-CO and 
CHEDROs CAR, VI and XI totaling ₱5,690,179.43 were directly charged to 

Expenses account, instead of initially recording it under the appropriate 

Inventories account prior to its distribution/issuance. Details are as follows:

2,097,769.63 

XI Review of the GL as at November 30, 2020 disclosed that 

regular purchases of office supplies and other supplies and 

materials directly charged to various Expense accounts 

instead of the appropriate Inventories account. 

535,982.58 

Total 5,690,179.43 

 

2.21 The practice of outright recording of the purchased inventories and semi-
expendable properties to various Expenses accounts was not in accordance 

with the Perpetual Inventory System required under the GAM for NGAs 

hence, casting doubt on the accuracy of the Inventories and the related 

Expenses accounts. 

 

2.22 We recommended that the Management require the Accountants of 
CHED-CO and CHEDROs CAR, VI and XI to: 

 

a. stop the practice of directly recording the purchases of inventories and 
semi-expendable items to Expenses account, instead, record all 

purchases and receipt of supplies and semi-expendable items through 

the appropriate Inventories account in accordance with the Perpetual 

Inventory System; and 

 

b. prepare adjusting journal entries, if warranted, to reflect the accurate 
balances of the affected accounts. 

 

2.23 Management commented the following: 
 

Office/ 

CHEDROs 
Comments 

CO In its letter-response dated March 26, 2021, the AFMS commented, thus: 

 

a. Purchases of inventories and semi-expendable items were directly 
recorded to Expenses account when the Inventory Custodian Slips are 
included in the supporting documents. Nevertheless, they shall comply 
with the recommendation. 

 
b. Inventory of supplies and appropriate adjusting entries shall be done to 

reflect accurate balances of accounts. 

CAR Management agreed to comply with the audit recommendations. 



105 

 

Office/ 

CHEDROs

VI The Management assures that all recommendations therein shall be strictly

XI In a letter dated February 10, 2021, the Management informed the Audit 
Team that they have already complied with the recommendations and per 
issued Office Memorandum No. 26 s.2021 dated February 9, 2021, the 
Regional Director has directed the personnel responsible to ensure 
compliance with the aforementioned recommendations. 

 

Moreover, at the present, the Office observes the Perpetual Inventory 
Method in recording supplies to ensure that purchases are reflected through 
the inventory account/s and RSMI. A copy of Office Memorandum was 
furnished to the Office of the Auditor on February 11, 2021. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

The Audit Team shall validate Management’s compliance with the 
recommendations. 

 

e) Absence of or incomplete physical count of inventories/PPE and non-
submission/incomplete submission of inventory report 

 

2.24 Section 13, Chapter 8 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I states that physical 
count/inventory, which is required semi-annually, is an indispensable 

procedure for checking the integrity of property custodianship. 

 

2.25 Section 17, Chapter 8 of the same Manual prescribes that the Report on the 
Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) shall be used to report the physical count 

of supplies by type of inventory as at a given date. It shows the balance of 

inventory items per card and per count and shortage/overage, if any. These 

include the semi-expendable property wherein the issue is covered by ICS. 

 

2.26 Audit revealed that the Inventory account balances of CHEDROs CAR, IV-B, 
VI, VIII, and XIII as of December 31, 2020 were unreliable due to the absence 

of or incomplete physical count of inventories and non-submission/incomplete 

submission of the RPCI, details are as follows:

physical count of inventories and submit the RPCI to facilitate the 

reconciliation of Inventory account balances pursuant to Chapter 8 of 

GAM for NGAs, Volume I.

VI The Management assures that all recommendations therein shall be strictly 

implemented. Further, appropriate corrective measures shall be undertaken 

immediately relative to the noted deficiencies in compliance with GAM for 

NGAs. 

VIII The Management already instructed the designated Supply Officer to 

conduct physical count of inventories. However, due to lack of personnel, 

the inventory count is still ongoing. The designated Supply Officer assured 

Management and COA that she will submit the RPCI and the required 

maintenance records on or before July 30, 2021. 

XIII The designated Supply Officer was directed to conduct an inventory but due 

to physical arrangement/retrofitting that was made in CY 2020 as part of 

measure against COVID-19, the actual conduct of physical count was 

delayed and the reporting will be delayed also.

V Management agreed to comply with the audit recommendation. The

merely overlooked the improper recording of the said fund transfers to SUCs

they have already complied with the recommendation and the Accountant 

has already reclassified the transactions to their appropriate accounts as at

In its letter dated April 7, 2021, HEDFS commented that: 
 
a. CHEDRO VIII recognized the unliquidated fund 

transfers from HEDF amounting to ₱3,980,788.34. 
They have already closed their Trust Account and 
remitted the balance to the BTr. However, they could 
no longer provide the documents that will be the basis 
for the HEDF to effect the liquidation in the books of 
accounts because their records were destroyed when 
the province was hit by Typhoon Yolanda. 
 

b. The Management already coordinated with the 
CHEDRO VIII Chief Administrative Officer and 
Accountant, they were informed on the audit findings 
requiring the latter to setup the Due to CO account to 
recognize the transfer of funds which remain 
outstanding in the HEDF books of accounts totaling 
₱3,980,788.34. 

Furthermore, in the 
case of documents 
lost during typhoon 
Yolanda, the 
HEDFS should 
require CHEDRO 
VIII to submit a 
request for relief 
from 
accountability. 

IV-B The Management commented that they are continuously 
reminding the HEIs to submit LRs on the funds 
transferred through demand letters and constant verbal 
reminders. The funds transferred for SAFE Loan shall 
remain in the books as receivable for it is treated as 
revolving funds of the HEIs. The rest of the receivables 
cannot be enforced for immediate liquidation due to the 
COVID-19 pandemic.

of reconciliation will remain weak, which may result in bigger variances in the 

ensuing financial periods. 

 

2.37 We recommended that the Management require the Inventory Team of 
concerned CHED Offices to: 

 

a. conduct complete physical count of all the PPEs, prepare the RPCPPE 
and submit the same to the Audit Team in consonance with Section 38, 

Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I; and 

 

b. comply with the guidelines and procedures prescribed in COA 
Circular No. 2020-006 for the one-time cleansing of PPE account 

balances in order to come up with reliable PPE balances that are 

verifiable as to existence, condition and accountability. 

 

2.38 Management’s Comments: 
 

Office/ 
CHEDRO 

Comments 

CO In a letter dated June 16, 2021, the HEDFS commented that the PPE reports 
were already submitted to the Accounting Unit as basis for recording of 

adjusting entries in the HEDF books of accounts. 

V The Agency acknowledges the recurring failure to conduct a complete physical 
count of all its PPEs. However, the same is expected to be realized in CY 2021. 

VI The Management shall properly observe and implement rules and procedures 
set forth by COA Circular No. 2020-006 concerning the conduct of Annual 

Physical Report Inventory and the preparation of RPCPPE. The Office is now 

embarking on electronic inventory system to fast-track the report. The 

recommendations relative thereto shall be fully complied with. 

VIII Management already instructed the Designated Supply Officer to conduct an 
inventory of PPEs. However, due to lack of personnel, the inventory-taking is 

still ongoing. The Designated Supply Officer assured the Management and 



116 

 

Office/ 
CHEDRO 

Comments 

COA that she will submit the RPCPPE and the required maintenance records 

on or before July 30, 2021. 

X The Property Officer and the Accountant are still in the process of reconciling 
their records. The Management will submit the said report upon their 

completion thereof. 

 

Further, during the Exit Conference the Accountant asked for more time to 

reconcile the booked PPEs, which is more than the amounts recorded by the 

Property Officer. They also explained that they are undermanned, and that one 

employee has multiple activities to undertake. Hence, the Property Officer is 

designated to handle the PPEs aside from her functions as EPS II. 

XIII The designated Supply Officer was directed to conduct an inventory but due to 
physical arrangement/retrofitting that was made in CY 2020 as part of measure 

against COVID-19, the actual conduct of physical count was delayed and the 

reporting will be delayed also.

2.39 The following deficiencies or other practices were also observed that affect the 
reliability of Inventories account, to wit:

Office/ 
CHEDRO 

Audit Observation 

CO Non-maintenance of the required Supplies Ledger Cards (SLCs) by the 
Accounting Office caused by the outright recording to expenses of purchased 

inventories and semi-expendable items. 
CAR Non-maintenance of SLCs resulted in unreliable balance of the Other Supplies 

and Materials Inventory account. 
The actual usage of government supplies could not be monitored in view of 

the absence of RIS duly signed by the end-user, as well as the SLC and SCs.  
Audit disclosed noted deficiencies in IAR wherein the procured items were 

accepted by the Head of the Units that requested for the procurement and not 

by the Supply Officer. This practice also weakened control over the issuance 

of supplies and was contrary to Item D on the instructions on the use of the 

IAR (Appendix 62 of the GAM). 
VI The reliability of the reported balance of Inventories account could not be 

ascertained due to the failure of the Accounting Section to maintain SLCs to 

record all receipts and issuances and absence of periodic reconciliation of 

Accounting and Property records. 
VIII SCs maintained by the Supply Officer were not updated and unreconciled with 

the SLCs of the Accountant. 
No RSMIs were prepared for semi-expendable properties based on issued 

ICSs in CY 2020. 
XI Because of the direct release of supplies to the end-users, the utilization of 

those inventoriable items was no longer reflected, for proper monitoring, in 

the RSMI. 

 



117 

 

2.40 We recommended that the Management require the: 
 

a. concerned Property/Supply Officers to: 
 

• prepare and maintain an updated SC for each item in stock; 
 

• prepare and regularly submit RSMI to the Accounting Office 
supported with duly signed RIS by the end-users for proper 

recording in the books; 
 

• receive/accept the office supplies deliveries by signing on the 
acceptance portion of the IAR; 

 

b. require the Accountant to maintain SLCs for each type of supplies to 
record all receipts and issuances; and 

 

c. Accountant and the Property/Supply Officer to conduct periodic 
reconciliation of their records.

Acknowledgment Receipt (PAR) (i.e., PAR were neither 

signed/acknowledged as received by the recipients or end-users nor signed 

as issued by the Property Custodian) for properties costing ₱4,054,983.01, 

contrary to Section 21, Chapter 10 of GAM for NGAs. 

XII Submitted RPCPPE as of December 31, 2020 revealed that semi-expendable 

properties were included in RPCPPE and disclosed several items that do not 

have unit value. 

 

2.43 We recommended that Management require the: 
 

a. Chief Accountant of CHED-CO to prepare the necessary adjusting 
entries to break down the recorded lump-sum recording of 

equipment; 

 

b. Property Officer in CHEDRO IV-B to; 
 

• use the prescribed form of RPCPPE, adopt the property 
identification system for PPE, and tag all PPE items counted with 

the new property stickers to conform to Appendix 73 of GAM for 

NGAs and COA Circular No. 2020-006;  

 

• to ensure that the PARs for PPE items are properly issued and 
acknowledged by recipients/end-users to establish their 

accountabilities over the said properties; 

 

c. Property Officer and Accountant of CHEDRO XII to: 
 

• demand a written justification/explanation from the Property/ 
Supply Officer regarding the incompleteness as to details of the 

submitted RPCPPE and thereafter prepare and submit a complete 

and consolidated RPCPPE; and  

 

• reclassify items erroneously classified as PPE into semi-expendable 
property in accordance with the guidelines. 

 

2.44 The Management of CHEDRO XII commented that the problems with the 
management of the PPE were caused by frequent changing of the Property 

Custodians without proper turnover of the records. Management committed 

that they will implement the Audit Team’s recommendations.

COMPLIANCE AUDIT 

 

Budget Utilization 

 

3. Out of the total allotments of ₱72,826,735,006.35 received by CHED, only 
₱59,965,315,678.33 or 82.34% was obligated during the year caused by low 

utilization rates, ranging from 4.02% to 88.14%, in five of its programs/projects, 

namely: a) the UAQTE, b) provision of scholarship to faculty HEIs and 

administrators, c) provision of assistance to HEls for K to 12 Transition Programs, 

d) Philippine California Advanced Research Institutes (PCARI) Project and e) 

implementation of the Information System Strategic Plan (ISSP), thereby 

affecting the timely and efficient implementation thereof. 

 

Moreover, out of the ₱1,676,115,042.30 total allotment received by CHEDRO 

NCR in Fiscal Year (FY) 2020, ₱1,667,237,813.29 or 99.47% was obligated during 

the year while only ₱716,720,445.80 or 42.76% was disbursed, of which 91% of 

the total disbursements pertains to Continuing Appropriations from FY 2019, 

thus indicating low fund utilization rate caused by its lack of absorptive capacity. 

It was also observed in CHEDRO X that Sub-Allotment Release Orders (Sub-

AROs) totaling ₱1,711,462,035.00 were improperly recognized and presented 

during the year, and out of total amount, ₱86,101,320.00 pertains to scholarship 

benefits of students for AY 2019-2020 which were belatedly released, contrary to 

the requirements provided under Section 6 (c) and (d), Chapter 2 of the GAM for 

NGAs, Volume I. 

 

3.1 The CHED had total appropriations of ₱85,790,033,003.35 for CY 2020, 
consisting of authorized appropriations of ₱47,906,948,000.00 under the 

General Appropriations Act (GAA) for FY 2020, and ₱37,883,085,003.35 as 

continuing appropriations from FY 2019. Out of its total appropriations, 

₱16,077,631,000.00 was earmarked for the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act and 

additional ₱3,300,000,000.00 was appropriated from the Bayanihan to 

Recover as One Act, resulting in adjusted appropriations of 

₱73,015,735,006.35. Details are as shown below:

3.5.2 Inquiry with the Management disclosed that the unobligated amount 
from current year appropriations was intended for payment of benefits 

to the new grantees of the TES and TDP and as well as for the unpaid 

FHE billings. The processing of the benefits for the new grantees will 

be carried-out in FY 2021, chargeable against the continuing FY 2020 

unutilized funds.  

 

3.5.3 Moreover, the unobligated MOOE allotment for the Continuing 
Appropriations was earmarked for continuing grantees who were 

delisted and on appeal. However, due to the delay in submission of 

documents, the FY 2019 budget was reverted to the BTr. Also, the 

DBM released SARO No. BMB-20-0017451 dated October 19, 2020 

for Capital Outlay amounting to ₱3,000,000.00 and was received by 

CHED in November 2020, of which ₱606,451.04 was obligated. The 

unobligated amount of ₱2,393,548.96 intended for the procurement of 

furniture and fixtures and some other items did not push through due 

to lack of time for bidding process until December 31, 2020.

3.5.8 Inquiry with the Management disclosed that the low utilization rate was 

brought about by the following:  
 

• The difficulty in getting technical reviewers and/or experts in the 
disciplines concerned especially during the Enhanced Community 
Quarantine (ECQ). Several experts who previously served as 
technical reviewers declined the request for review due to various 
personal and professional reasons, thus resulting in another round 



125 

 

of selection and invitation of designated CHED technical 
reviewers. Once technical reviewers are on board, the technical 
review process involves several rounds of revisions and iterations 
that usually take around six to 10 months. As due diligence, this 
tedious technical review process is imperative because of the large 
amount of public funds involved in the projects;  

 

• The CHED added a new requirement for project approval with the 
objective of involving more SUCs in the PCARI project – for 
proponents to get the official commitment of three SUCs to 
participate as collaborators per project. While issued in 2019, this 
requirement entailed major revision of the proposals that stretched 
throughout 2020 specifically because of the Philippine 
government’s COVID-19 Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) 
restrictions imposed for academic institutions (i.e., Lockdowns); 

 

• Obtaining clearance from the Department of Science and 
Technology (DOST) councils for R&D proposals submitted for 
CHED funding to ensure that proposals are aligned with the 
National R&D priorities and to avoid duplication of proposals and 
double funding. DOST clearance usually takes around three or 
more months. However, in 2020, DOST clearance took four to 
eight months; 

 

• The CHED decided on the reorganization of the PCARI Project 
Management and Coordination Office (PMCO), which entailed a 
change in the procedures that intensified the review process; 

 

• Seven positions for technical staff were vacant since March 2019, 
thus resulting in work overload of the remaining staff who assumed 
duties and responsibilities on top of their respective Terms of 
Reference. Out of all tasks assumed by the remaining staff, the most 
important and time-consuming was the tracking and monitoring of 
several rounds of project technical and financial reviews including 
compliance of the project proponents to the comments of reviewers 
from field experts, the DOST, and the PCARI Program Advisory 
Group; 

 

• COVID-19 restrictions specifically on laboratory or field work 
forced most of the ongoing PCARI projects to halt or delay their 
implementation throughout 2020, which in turn resulted in a low 
number of applications received for lateral scholarships and zero 
applications for new PCARI scholarships; and 

 

• Due to restrictions on foreign/local travel and face-to-face 
meetings, major planned activities for 2020 were rescheduled, such 
as the PCARI R&D Conference which was supposed to highlight 
the contributions of the funded projects in advancing research and 



126 

 

innovation in the country, and High-Level Meetings to University 
of California which was intended for the Commission’s high-level 
officials to visit the facilities and/or laboratories set up by the 
Principal Investigators of PCARI Projects in University of 
California and strengthen goodwill with UC System, among others. 

 
3.5.9 Moreover, the reports submitted by the PCARI-PMCO showed that as 

of December 31, 2020, out of the 44 PCARI Research and 
Development Projects implemented from CYs 2013 to 2020, 26 have 
been concluded per project duration, while 14 are ongoing and four are 
for implementation. 

 
3.5.10 Among the problems encountered by the HEIs in the implementation 

of projects, which resulted in delays and extensions of completion are: 
delay in the procurement of equipment by the DBM-PS and PITC; 
lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which restricted project 
implementation activities; and delay in the release of yearly budget, 
which resulted in delay of accomplishment of the project’s timeline. 

 
Implementation of the ISSP 
 
3.5.11 In CY 2020, out of the ₱94,809,055.06 allotments received for this 

program, only ₱3,813,403.26 or 4.02% was obligated.

Total 94,809,055.06 3,813,403.26 90,995,651.80 4.02 

 

3.5.12 The reasons for the low utilization, based on inquiry with the 
Management, are as follows:  

 

• Most of the activities involved under the ISSP were scheduled from 
May to December 2020. This period was covered with community 
quarantine where delay in the project implementation was present 
and that the administrative routing of documents was still on 
transition from manual transaction to the new normal. Thus, it 
hindered the unit from implementing the project activities. 

 

• The preparation of market surveys, which is a requirement prior to 
posting or bidding of goods and service, heavily depends on the 
price quotations submission of the service providers and vendors. 
The Office of Planning, Research and Knowledge Management 
(OPRKM) as the end-user has no control on the submission waiting 
time to complete the market surveys given that the service 



127 

 

providers and vendors are aware of the government procurement 
policy to get the lowest possible price. It usually takes a lot of time 
convincing them to submit their quotations for the market survey. 

 

• There was an activity that was awarded but put on hold due to 
unresolved issues on project extension and need to wait for the 
advice of Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB). Other 
activities which are no longer technically feasible were either 
deferred or were declared a failure of bidding. 

 

• The procurement of ICT equipment was also affected and not 
feasible to implement due to the pandemic. Thus, the procurement 
of hardware and software, cloud computing services and ICT office 
supplies for CHED ICT upgrades did not materialize.  

 

• For the catch-up plan for the FY 2020 Budget, the System 
Integration Unit will strategize and realign activities to address 
immediate action concerning pandemic related activities subject to 
CEB approval. 

 

3.6 The low utilization rates of the allotted budget for the year prevented the timely 
and efficient implementation of the major programs of the CHED. 

 

3.7 We recommended that the Management come up with a strategy or catch-
up action plan to immediately address the gaps/setbacks encountered in 

the implementation of programs and projects to ensure their efficient and 

timely implementation as well as the maximum utilization of funds 

received. 

 

3.8 Management commented that the low utilization in the following programs are 
due to the following: 
 

Fund Reason 

Provision of assistance to HEls for K to 12 Transition Programs 

Continuing 

Appropriations 

Research Grants 

Out of the 19 research proposals approved by the CEB in 2019, only 14 

projects were obligated because two projects are from HEIs with 

unliquidated balance, one project requested for withdrawal due to the 

COVID-19 pandemic, and two projects were not able to submit the MOA 

before the closing of accounting books. 

 

Innovation Grants 

In 2020, the Commission assigned the OPRKM to handle the 2020 Call 

for project proposals to utilize the 2019 Continuing funds allocated for 

Institutional Development and Innovation Grants (IDIG). From the 65 

applications received, thirty-two (32) new project proposals have passed 

the vetting criteria and have been approved by the Commission.

Appropriations 

Research Grants 
Out of the 24 proposals approved by the CEB, only 19 have been 

obligated. The unobligated balance pertains to three projects which have 
not yet provided the copies of the MOA and two projects from HEIs with 

unliquidated funds. 
 

Innovation Grants 

The Commission released a call for proposals for the IDIG last October 
2020. The Office of Institutional Quality Assurance and Governance 

received 38 proposals. However, only 25 were considered to be evaluated 
by the Technical Experts. The team conducted the Vetting of Proposals 

last March 2021 and is currently reviewing the revisions in the submitted 

proposals.

On the side of the team's guiding policies, the new policy for capacity-

building programs for higher education was finalized and released in the 

last quarter of 2020 through CMO No. 14, s. 2020 or the “Guidelines for 
International Continuing Professional Education as an additional 

component of CMO No. 25, s. 2016”. In this regard, new projects under 
this grant have only started in 2020, thus said projects were already 

charged under 2020 GAA funds instead of 2019 GAA Continuing funds. 
For Transnational Education programs, the main cause of underutilization 

was the time needed by partner HEIs to submit the liquidation report on 
other CHED grants and sign official documents (i.e. MOA).

• Development of new initiatives and finalization of its guidelines for 
the new calls. The new guidelines seek to address key system 

inefficiencies encountered in the previous runs of the project and to 

adapt to the new normal. 
 

• The non-submission of billings/Statements of Account (SOAs) from 
Delivering Higher Education Institutions (DHEIs). Despite numerous 

follow-ups and DHEI visits, there are some pending billings/SOAs to 
be received by the Commission. Compliance is affected by localized 

lockdowns and community quarantine issues because many of the 
HEIs have adopted purely online systems for enrollment, and have 

strictly Work-From-Home (WFH) work arrangements. However, the 
team is continuously coordinating with the DHEIs to seek compliance. 

The CHEDROs have been mobilized for the same. 
 

International Continuing Professional Education 

Due to the pandemic, the partners were required to revise their submitted 
Work and Financial Plan (WFP) provided that some on-site and face-to-

face activities have shifted to the online platform. With this, the project 
cost, the implementation calendar, and some of the objectives have been 

revised.

3.10 As can be seen in the table above, the CHEDRO NCR has obligated a total of 
₱606,839,299.32 or 98.82% of its received allotment for the current year 

totaling ₱614,088,048.80, however, only ₱61,013,272.50 or 9.94% was 

disbursed during the year. Likewise, in its continuing allotment, the CHEDRO 

NCR has obligated a total of ₱1,060,398,513.97 or 99.85% while only 

₱655,707,173.30 or 61.74% was disbursed. In total, the CHEDRO NCR has 

obligated ₱1,667,237,813.29 or 99.47% of the total allotment for CY 2020 and 

disbursed only ₱716,720,445.80 or 42.76%, of which 91% of the total 

disbursements were from the Continuing Appropriations of FY 2019. 

 

3.11 The low fund utilization rate for the allotted budget for the year is attributed to 
the lack of absorptive capacity and limited manpower of the CHEDRO NCR, 

thus affecting the timeliness and efficiency of the program implementation and 

also resulted in reversion of unexpended allotments. 

 

3.12 We recommended the Management to: 
 

a. make a representation to the CHED-CO and DBM regarding 
increasing of manpower complement; 

 

b. address the gaps/setbacks encountered in the program 
implementation to ensure efficient and optimum utilization of 

available resources; and 
 



130 

 

c. prepare a more realistic budget taking into account the projects that 
can be reasonably executed in a given year in order to trim down 

under spending and avoid possible reversion of unexpended 

allotments. 
 

Late release in December 2020 of Sub-ARO for AY 2019-2020 scholarship benefits 
and the inconsistent Recognition and Presentation thereof  

 

3.13 Section 6, Chapter 2 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I provides for the basic 
government accounting and budget reporting principles, thus: 

 

“Each entity shall recognize and present its financial transactions 
and operations conformably to the following: 
 
c. budget basis for presentation of budget information in the 

financial statements (FSs) in accordance with PPSAS 24; 
 
f. financial statements based on accounting and budgetary 

records.” 
 

3.14 Moreover, Section 34 thereof on the use of appropriated funds states that all 
moneys for functions, activities, projects and programs shall be available 
solely for the specific purposes for which these are appropriated. 

 
3.15 Post-audit of the Budget and Financial Accountability Reports (BFARs), 

Current and Continuing Appropriations of CHEDRO X as of September 30, 
2020 showed that the Object Class of the SAAODB by Object of Expenditures 
(FAR No. 1-A, Continuing Appropriations) is inconsistent with the Object 
Class of the Sub-ARO received by the Agency, with the following details: 

 

Report Object Class Amount (In Php) 

FAR No. 1-A Donation 1,710,732,600.00 

Sub-ARO Scholarship Expense 1,711,462,035.00 

Trial Balance Scholarship Expense 97,577,575.00 

 

3.16 It was also discovered that most of the Sub-Allotments in FY 2020 were 
funded from the FY 2019 GAA classified as Continuing Appropriations. The 

Sub-AROs summarized in the table below revealed that those were released in 

the last two weeks of December 2020, the last release of which amounting to 

₱84,535,920.00 was on December 29, 2020. Thus, subject allotments will 

lapse on December 31, 2020 and can no longer be utilized in FY 2021.

3.17 We recommended that the Management: 
 

CHEDRO X 
 

a. facilitate the immediate release of scholarship benefits to the 
concerned students who are dependent thereon,  in order not to 

further prejudice their schooling; 
 

b. recognize the Object Class in the SAAODB by Object of 
Expenditures in conformity to the Object Class of the received Sub-

ARO;  
 

c. submit for audit a report to the Audit Team on the status of fund 
utilization of the Sub-AROs funded from the FY 2019 GAA 

(Continuing Appropriations) totaling ₱86,101,320.00 that were 

belatedly released by CHED-CO to CHEDRO X; and 
 

CHED-CO 
 

d. ensure the timely release to the CHEDROs of Sub-AROs for 
scholarship Programs to respond accordingly with the educational 

needs of the concerned students.  
 

3.18 In their letter dated February 16, 2021, Management replied that: 
 

a. Per BFARs submission to DBM and CHED-CO, the object class used for 
any scholarship disbursement was classified as “Donation”. It shall 

officially write a letter of request to CHED Budget Office – AFMS to 

change the object class from “Donation” to “Scholarship Expenses”. 

Moreover, it shall abide by the reply from CHED Budget Office – AFMS. 

 
b. In response to the sub-Allotment received in FY 2020 that were funded 

from the FY 2019 GAA classified as Continuing Appropriations that were 



132 

 

released during the last two weeks of December 2020, there were no Notice 
of Transfer Allocation (NTA) received by the Office among those said 
Sub-Allotments until the year-end. Thus, the said Sub-Allotments were 
obligated and recognized as Accounts Payable as of December 31, 2020 
and furthermore shall be requested from DBM Region-X for NCAs in the 
next following year for the utilization of funds. 

 

 

Implementation of projects funded out of Bayanihan Funds 

 

4. Out of the total allotments of ₱3,300,000,000.00 received by CHED from the 
Bayanihan to Recover as One Act, only ₱1,339,986,619.42 or 40.61% was 

obligated during the year. Moreover, out of total funds of ₱71,375,000.00 for the 

implementation of Bayanihan 2 for Higher Education Tulong Program 

(B2HELP) in CHEDROs NCR and I, ₱26,273,722.31 was not utilized at year-end, 

hence deprived some qualified grantees of their financial benefits which could 

have contributed for their educational needs. Deficiencies in the implementation 

of the said program in CHEDRO XI were also observed, such as: a) absence of 

proof of enrollment and some students were not actually enrolled in the 1st 

semester of AY 2020-2021; b) incomplete supporting document on payments to 

HEIs amounting to ₱5,245,462.41; and c) double payment to beneficiaries in the 

total amount of ₱225,821.00. 

 

4.1 President Rodrigo Roa Duterte has signed RA No. 11469 on March 24, 2020, 
otherwise known as “Bayanihan to Heal as One Act,” declaring a state of 

national emergency arising from the COVID-19 situation and to implement 

temporary measures to respond to the crisis brought about by the pandemic. 
 

4.2 The President then signed RA No. 11494, otherwise known as “Bayanihan to 
Recover as One Act,” on September 11, 2020 to implement interventions and 

mechanisms that could accelerate the recovery and bolster the resiliency of the 

Philippine economy. Section 10 of the same RA, authorized the appropriation 

of the following: 

 

a. ₱3,000,000,000.00 to assist SUCs in the development of smart campuses 
through investments in ICT infrastructure, acquisition of learning 

management systems and other appropriate equipment to fully implement 

flexible learning modalities; and 

 

b. ₱600,000,000.00 for subsidies and allowances to qualified students of 
public and private elementary, secondary, and tertiary education 

institutions. 

 

4.3 Out of the ₱600,000,000.00 appropriation for subsidies and allowances, only 
₱300,000,000.00 is applicable to CHED, resulting to total allotment received 

of ₱3,300,000,000.00, of which only ₱1,339,986,619.42 or 40.61% was 



133 

 

obligated in CY 2020, leaving an unobligated allotment of ₱1,960,013,380.58,

4.4 The obligated amount of ₱1,040,000,000.00 under provision of financial and 

material assistance to SUCs in the development of smart campuses through 
investments in ICT infrastructure, acquisition of Learning Management 
System and appropriate equipment pertains to the procurement of 20,000 units 
of mid-range laptops for SUCs/LUCs in line with the implementation of 
flexible learning modalities pursuant to Section 10 of RA No. 11494. The fund 
transfer was made to DBM-PS thru Check Number 1485418 dated December 
28, 2020 in the amount of ₱1 Billion. The amount of ₱40,000,000.00, which 
remained undisbursed as of year-end although already obligated, is earmarked 
for the 4% service cost being charged by DBM-PS.  
 

4.5 Inquiry with the Management revealed that the low utilization rate was due to 
the following: 

 

• There was a need to craft new guidelines for the release of the grant under 
the guidance of the Advisory Group. The final set of guidelines was 
released as CMO No. 9, s. 2020. 

 

• Considering the technical nature of the grant, there was a need for a 
technical review by experts in the field. The team needed to secure the 



134 

 

services of experts to review highly technical proposals. The review 
process took some time as this involves iterations of comments from 
experts and revisions by proponent SUCs. 

 

• Typhoons Rolly and Ulysses also moved the timetable by almost a week 
given suspension of work both by CHED and the proponent SUCs. 

 

• Our technical experts many of whom are also professors had commitments 
both professional and personal in December as the month is the end of the 
semester and as Christmas holidays were fast approaching. The same was 
also the case among our proponents in state colleges and universities. 

 

• The project given was undertaken in CY 2020 without additional staff 
complement. It utilized existing staff which was further hampered by the 
challenges brought about by the pandemic. 

 
4.6 The low utilization rates of the allotted budget for the year prevented the timely 

and efficient implementation of the major programs of the CHED. 
 

4.7 We recommended that the Management come up with a strategy or catch-
up action plan to immediately address the gaps/setbacks encountered in 
the implementation of programs and projects to ensure their efficient and 

timely implementation as well as the maximum utilization of funds 
received. 

 
Bayanihan 2 for Higher Education Tulong Program or B2HELP 

 
4.8 Pursuant to Section 4(n) of RA No. 11494 and by virtue of the CEB Resolution 

Nos. 772-2020 dated October 27, 2020 and 812-2020 dated November 10, 
2020, the CHED had issued CMO No. 10 s. 2020 on November 18, 2020 as 
implementing guidelines for the intervention of providing subsidy and 
allowance to qualified students in private and public HEIs and referred to as 
the Bayanihan 2 for Higher Education Tulong Program or B2HELP. 

 

4.9 Section III of the said CMO stipulates the objectives of the said financial 
subsidy, to wit: 

 

“The objective of the B2HELP is to provide a one-time fixed grant of 

five thousand pesos (₱5,000) to qualified students ‘whose families 

are now facing difficulties about work stoppage and closure of 

establishments due to the community quarantine’ (Sec.4 (n), RA 

11494). 

 

It shall prioritize qualified students in PHEIs to help them defray 

some of their outstanding balances which they incurred in Academic 

Year (AY) 2019-2020 or AY 2020-2021. Qualified students in public 

HEIs (SUCs) and Local Universities and Colleges (LUCs)) can use 



135 

 

the subsidy/allowance to cover some of their flexible learning 

expenses such as connectivity expenses.” 

 
4.10 The B2HELP’s timelines as stated in Section VI of CMO No. 10 s. 2020 set, 

among others, the calendar of activities by CHEDROs and participating HEIs, 
as follows:

4.11 In the course of audit, the Audit Team observed the following: 
 

a) Unutilized B2HELP funds in CHEDROs NCR and I - ₱26,273,722.31 
 

Out of the ₱71,375,000.00 B2HELP funds received by CHEDROs NCR and 

I, the amount of ₱26,273,722.31 remained unutilized as of December 31, 2020, 

broken down as follows: 

 

CHEDRO 
Allocation Received Amount Utilized Unutilized 

(In Php) 

NCR 57,780,000.00 33,685,714.08 24,094,285.92

Total 71,375,000.00 45,101,277.69 26,273,722.31 

 

4.12 On December 17, 2020, a total of ₱57,780,000.00 was credited to the MDS-
Fund 101 account of the CHEDRO NCR transferred by the CHED-CO thru 

NTA for the payment of one-time financial benefit under the B2HELP for AY 

2020-2021. Out of this amount, a total of ₱33,685,714.08 was disbursed as of 

December 31, 2020. 



136 

 

4.13 The Accountant of CHEDRO NCR has processed DVs and drawn checks 
totaling ₱33,685,714.08 for the payment of the 1st batch of B2HELP grants to 

41 Private Partner Institutions with 6,827 qualified student-grantees. Most of 

the checks drawn were claimed by the Private Partner Institutions during the 

1st quarter of CY 2021. 

 

4.14 It was noted that only 58.30% of the B2HELP funds was utilized by the 
CHEDRO NCR as of December 31, 2020 and the remaining cash allocation 

amounting to ₱24,094,285.92, although obligated at year-end, already lapsed 

and automatically  reverted to the BTr. 

 

4.15 Despite the urgency to release the fund, the CHEDRO NCR was not able to 
comply with the completion of the utilization of B2HELP funds by December 

19, 2020, as required under the CMO No. 10 s. 2020, due to the failure of some 

participating HEIs to submit complete and appropriate application documents 

within the timeline or schedule set per CMO which caused delay in the 

evaluation and selection of Partner Institution and verification of its qualified 

recommended student grantees by the StuFAPs Unit, as well as the 

disbursement/payment by the Accounting Unit. 

 

4.16 According to the StuFAPs Unit of CHEDRO NCR, application documents by 
Participating HEIs were submitted within the 2nd week of December 2020, 

however, some of the documents have deficiencies. Consequently, the 

participating HEIs were advised to send the revised documents but the same 

were submitted beyond the timeline or schedule based on CMO. Nevertheless, 

the StuFAPs Unit continued to accept the revised documents in order to fully 

utilize the budget and more qualified students may benefit from the grant. In 

fact, the remaining unutilized B2HELP funds in CY 2020 totaling 

₱24,094,285.92 were already obligated and for release in the 1st quarter of CY 

2021 to 45 Private Partner Institutions with 4,856 qualified students.  

 

4.17 Moreover, 28 Private Partner Institutions who received the B2HELP grant did 
not comply with the submission of soft and hard copies of LRs with complete 

supporting documents within the timeline set per CMO of 15 and 30 working 

days upon receipt of grant and incurred delays ranging from one to 41 days. 

 

4.18 Among the liquidation documents required under Section V (D) of the CMO, 
to be provided by the Private Partner Institutions are the original copy of 

Official Receipt (OR) of grant released by the CHEDRO NCR and a certified 

true copy of the OR issued to the grantee showing the amount of grant that was 

deducted from the outstanding tuition and miscellaneous balance of the 

grantee.  

 

4.19 The main reason for the non-compliance of the Private Partner Institutions with 
the submission of the liquidation documents was that they could not provide a 

certified true copy of the OR issued to the grantee. Technically, they could not 



137 

 

issue an OR because no cash was given to the students. Meanwhile, the 

StuFAPs Unit devised a SOA template showing the outstanding tuition and 

miscellaneous balance of each student and the amount of B2HELP grant 

deducted as alternative document, a copy to be distributed to the Private 

Partner Institutions for compliance. Further, as of March 15, 2021, demand 

letters were already sent to 15 Private Partner Institutions. 

 

4.20 On the other hand, CHEDRO I received NTA No. 20-12-871 amounting to 
₱13,595,000.00 with a total regional slot allocation of 2,719 grantees under the 

Bayanihan 2 Act. 

 

4.21 Per Monitoring Report of the Accounting Unit as of December 19, 2020, 
CHEDRO I had not maximized the utilization of funds for the implementation 

of the educational assistance program. Only 83.97% or ₱11,415,563.61 out of 

₱13,595,000.00 fund allocation was disbursed to grantees and an aggregate 

amount of ₱2,179,436.39 or 16.03% was not utilized. 

 

4.22 Further, out of the total regional slots of 2,719 grantees, only 2,370 were 
granted educational assistance resulting in unfilled slots for 349 grantees, 

which should have been opened to Public HEIs’ grantees. Had this been done, 

CHEDRO I could have fully utilized the total regional slots allocated and 

maximized the fund transferred in order to realize the objectives of the 

B2HELP Program. 

 

4.23 Based on the gathered data, the 2,370 grantees were all students from PHEIs 
by which each Private Institution shall be limited to a maximum number of 30 

grantees during the initial selection. If there are more than 30 recommended 

qualified grantees, the CHEDRO shall select the first 30 names from the HEI 

list. The remaining recommended grantees can be considered in the next round 

of selection until CHEDRO I had filled its regional slot allocation. 

 

4.24 Section IV of CMO No. 10 s. 2020 provides that for the B2HELP, qualified 
students in PHEIs shall be prioritized. Qualified students in public HEIs shall 

be considered only when there is still remaining unutilized fund. 

 

4.25 The Audit Team also noted that out of the ₱11,415,563.61 utilized fund, only 
₱9,181,877.00 was actually transferred to the Partner HEIs through Auto Debit 

Account (ADA) and the amount of ₱2,233,686.61 disbursed through checks 

remained unclaimed by the Partner HEIs up to this date.  

 

4.26 Moreover, in terms of the LRs of the Partner HEIs, there were no LRs 
submitted yet to the Office of the Auditor for post-audit and evaluation because 

the implementation of the program is still ongoing.  

 

4.27 The B2HELP Coordinator informed the Audit Team that the NTA was 
received by CHEDRO I on December 18, 2020 and had disbursed the fund 



138 

 

immediately to the Partner PHEIs. It was noted that the validity of the 

appropriations under RA No. 11494 is only up to December 19, 2020. They 

added that they had followed the CMO No. 10, s. 2020 in prioritizing the 

PHEIs recommended grantees. Despite the CHEDRO’s efforts to inform the 

Private Partner HEIs, there is still 349 slots unfilled due to the following: out 

of the total 80 PHEIs in Region I, only 60 HEIs had submitted their 

recommended grantees, 10 HEIs had waived their slots, seven HEIs had not 

submitted their recommended grantees and three HEIs had no enrollment for 

the Academic Year.  As much as they want to open the remaining slots to 

Public Partner HEIs, the validity of the appropriations had already lapsed. 

Nonetheless, the CHEDRO had requested from CHED-CO for the extension 

in the processing of financial assistance but it was not granted because it will 

be beyond the prescribed validity of the said appropriation. However, it is good 

to note that the validity/availability of the appropriations under the Bayanihan 

2 was extended until June 30, 2021 through the enactment of RA No. 11519 

dated December 29, 2020 and the DBM has yet to issue the Implementing 

Rules and Regulations pursuant to Section 6 of the said new law. 

 

4.28 Had the fund amounting to ₱13,595,000.00 been transferred at an earlier date 
in order for CHEDRO I to release the subsidy prior to the opening of AY 2020-

2021 or within a reasonable period after school opening but in no case later 

than September 2020, in compliance with Section 4(n) of RA 11494, the 

remaining slots could have been redistributed to qualified students in the 

Public HEIs. 

 

4.29 Considering that the financial assistance was not fully utilized in this time of 
pandemic, this had deprived some qualified grantees of their financial benefits 

which could have contributed to their educational needs and ensured the 

sustainability of the Scholarship Programs to meet the objectives of providing 

financial assistance to the beneficiaries to enable them to complete their 

college studies/degrees. 

 

b) Ineffective implementation of the B2HELP in CHEDRO XI 
 

4.30 Section IV (A). Coverage of the guidelines or CMO No. 10 s. 2020 provides 
the qualification requirements of grantees: 

 

“1. For grantee studying in Private HEI 
 

a. Must be a Filipino citizen; 

b. Must be enrolled in a CHED-recognized Bachelor's degree 

program this First Semester, AY 2020-2021; 

c. Must have an outstanding tuition and miscellaneous fees 

balance incurred during AY 2019-2020 or AY 2020-2021; 

and 



139 

 

d. Must be a 3rd year or 4thyear, or graduating student this First 

Semester AY 2020-2021. 

 

2.  For grantee studying in Public HEI 

 

a. Must be a Filipino citizen; 

b. Must be enrolled in a CHED recognized Bachelor’s degree 

program (with Permit, Recognition, or COPC) this First 

Semester, AY 2020-2021; and 

c. Must be a 3rd year, 4th year, or graduating student this First 

Semester, AY 2020-2021.” (emphasis supplied) 

 

4.31 Section V (A). on the Implementation and Application Procedures stipulates 
that: 

 

“1. To expedite or fast track the disbursement of the B2HELP fund, 

HEIs shall file applications on behalf of the recommended 

qualified grantees. 

 

2. The Office of the CHED Chairperson issues a memorandum 

calling for HEls to file online applications for the B2HELP to 

concerned CHEDRO. 

 

3. The HEI submits scanned copy (or PDF file) of the following 

application documents duly signed by concerned HEI Officials 

through the preferred online modality of the CHEDRO (e.g.,  email, 

virtual portal, etc.) 

  

a. Notarized Application Letter with undertaking  
b. HEI List of Recommended B2HELP Grantees 
c. HEI Selection and Ranking Process in Identifying the 

Recommended Grantees 

 

4. The HEI must submit both the scanned copy/PDF file and Excel 

file of the HEI List of Recommended B2HELP Grantees 

 

5. In identifying the recommended grantees, the HEl must 

ensure that the qualifications provided in Section IV are complied 

with.” (emphasis supplied) 

 

4.32 The fundamental principle governing financial transactions and operations of 
any government agency is set under Section 4.6 of PD No. 1445, which states 

that “Claims against government funds shall be supported with complete 

documentation”. 

 



140 

 

4.33 Verification of the DVs already submitted as at December 31, 2020 pertaining 
to the payments made to HEIs under B2HELP disclosed the following 

deficiencies: 

 

b.1. No proof of being enrolled and some students were not actually enrolled 
in the 1st semester of AY 2020-2021 

 
4.33.1 A total of 183 college grantees, who were on their 4th year level 

during AY 2019-2020, were given a B2HELP grant amounting to 

₱883,305.31 for their 2nd Semester AY 2019-2020 outstanding 

tuition and miscellaneous fees balances. No documents were attached 

to the payments to prove that these students were still enrolled in the 

1st semester of AY 2020-2021 as required in the guidelines. Those 

grantees may have graduated from college by the end of                               

AY 2019-2020, hence no longer qualified for the grant.   

 

4.33.2 The Davao Oriental State College of Science and Technology 
(DOSCT) of Mati City has already communicated with CHEDRO XI 

that some of its grantees did graduate in the 2nd Semester of                               

AY 2019-2020 and has promised to submit a list of qualified 

replacements. 

 

4.33.3 Moreover, five students of Tecarro College Foundation were paid 
with the financial grant of ₱25,000.00 although the semester applied 

for was for the 2nd Semester of AY 2020-2021, which was not 

included in the coverage of CMO No. 10 s. 2020. 

 

b.2. Incomplete Supporting Documents – ₱5,245,462.41 
 

4.33.4 HEIs Application Letters were not attached to the DVs for payments 
to 19 HEIs with 1,092 grantees amounting to ₱5,245,462.41. Only 

the Requests for Payment (RFPs) prepared by the Scholarship Unit 

of CHEDRO XI were attached to the DVs. 

 

b.3. Double payment of ₱225,821.00 
 

4.33.5 The names of 47 grantees were included twice in the application 
letters submitted by HEIs as well as the RFPs prepared by the 

Scholarship Unit, thus a total amount of ₱225,821.00 were granted 

twice to the same recipients.  It should be noted that per CMO 10, s. 

2020, only a one-time fixed grant of ₱5,000.00 will be granted to 

qualified students. 

 

4.33.6 Verification with the Scholarship Unit on why the above conditions 
existed disclosed that prior to the release of the guidelines, which is 

the CMO No. 10, s. 2020, various online meetings were conducted 



141 

 

by the CHED-CO, together with CHEDROs and HEIs, to discuss 

about the financial assistance to be granted to college students with 

outstanding balances in HEIs. With the instructions given during the 

said meetings, some of the HEIs already prepared and submitted to 

CHEDRO XI the application letters without exact information on the 

requirements for students to qualify in receiving the grant. 

 

4.33.7 The noted deficiency on the grantees not anymore enrolled in the 1st 
Semester of AY 2020-2021 has already been communicated to the 

CHED-CO and as per instruction, the beneficiaries can be replaced 

with those with outstanding balances who are still currently enrolled 

for the 1st semester of AY 2020-2021. Inquiry disclosed that the 

unused funds in the hands of the HEIs need not be reverted back to 

the CO based on Item V (F) of CMO 10, s. 2020, which provides that 

CHEDROs may redistribute unused slots when applicable.   

 

4.33.8 Furthermore, as per instruction from the CHED-CO, to expedite the 
disbursement of the B2HELP fund, HEIs can file applications on 

behalf of the recommended qualified grantees and that they shall also 

certify that the grantees as per submitted application letters are still 

enrolled for the 1st semester of AY 2020-2021. Thus, the application 

letters submitted by the schools were the only basis for the 

disbursements made by CHEDRO XI, which was contrary to Items 

V (A)(3) and V (B)(1) of CMO 10, s. 2020. 

 

4.33.9 The Scholarship Unit can only verify further on the qualifications of 
the grantees once the liquidation documents are submitted by the 

HEIs, as these were not required prior to the release of the grants. 

 

4.33.10 According to some personnel involved in the processing of 
payments, the DVs with no attached application letters from the HEIs 

were just overlooked. Applications sent via e-mail were not printed.  

Some of the lacking application letters are yet to be submitted and 

the double payments were unnoticed upon processing and shall be 

reviewed further. 

 

4.33.11 Since the Audit Team noted that the application letters of the HEIs 
should be notarized, all the information provided in and attached to 

the application letters should be true and correct. Providing false or 

inaccurate information may be a ground for the imposition of 

sanctions as provided in the CMO, which states that “Partner 

institutions found to violate any provision in the CMO shall, after 

compliance with due process, be required to return the full amount 

given to them. Provided, that sanction/s imposed against the HEIs 

for violation/s committed under the CMO shall be without prejudice 

to the interest of the concerned students.” 



142 

 

4.33.12 The noted deficiencies constitute irregular transactions. The grant of 
assistance to unqualified students deprived other qualified students 

who were not considered due to limited slot allocation.   

 

4.33.13 In view of the foregoing conditions, DVs not compliant with the 
guidelines and those with lacking documentary support shall be 

suspended in audit. 
 

4.34 We recommended that the Management require the Regional Director of: 
 

CHEDRO NCR : 
 

a. instruct the StuFAPS Unit to: 
 

• expedite the evaluation and selection of the Partner Institutions as 
well as the verification of the qualified B2HELP student-grantees 

for the immediate release of B2HELP funds; 
 

• strictly observe the timeline for completion of B2HELP 
implementation process as provided in the CMO; 

 

• ensure that the student-grantees awarded are qualified and legible 
students to receive the B2HELP grant; 

 

• require submission of complete liquidation documents from the 
Private Partner Institution who have already received B2HELP 

grant by sending demand letters; 
 

b. coordinate with CHED-CO for the timely release/downloading of 
funds and then instruct the Accounting Unit to expedite the release of 

B2HELP Funds to the remaining 45 Private Partner Institutions; and 
 

c. impose sanctions to Private Partner Institution who will violate any 
provision in the CMO, provided that the sanction/s shall be without 

prejudice to the interest of the concerned students. 
 

CHEDRO I  
 

d. ensure the proper and efficient implementation of CMO No. 10, s. 2020 
and pro-actively coordinate with CHED-CO to warrant the timely and 

prompt release of B2HELP funds to the CHEDRO I in accordance 

with Section 4(n) of RA No. 11494; 
 

CHEDRO XI 
 

e. direct the Scholarship Unit to review paid assistance to students, thru 
the various HEIs, and coordinate with the HEIs to address the noted 

deficiencies on the irregular payments; 



143 

 

f. inform the HEIs of the double payments made and the corresponding 
solution on how to resolve the overpayment; 
 

g. submit to the Auditor proofs of action by both the Management and 
the HEIs in recovering the double payment; 
 

h. direct the Head of the Scholarship Unit to ensure adherence to the 
guidelines on scholarship grants or financial assistance and to always 

secure written instructions as basis for the processing of payment for 

grants/ financial assistance; and 
 

i. direct the Accountant to strictly adhere to Section 4.6. of PD No. 1445 
on processing of claims against government funds, otherwise, she shall 

also be held liable for all the disbursements that she certified but 

lacked supporting documents. 
 

4.35 The Management commented, thus: 
 

CHEDRO Comments 

NCR a. Evaluation and selection have been conducted,   however,  CHEDRO NCR 
is waiting for the release of funds from DBM.   

 

b. It should be noted that the time allotted to implement the program was very 
limited.   

 

c. Student-grantees were validated with the list of TES grantees, ongoing 
StuFAPs grantees and the enrollment list of CHEDRO NCR to ensure that 
awarded grantees are qualified. 

 

d. Demand letters were already sent to HEIs who have not submitted their LRs. 
Final demand letter will be issued to those who will still not comply and 
sanctions will be implemented. 

 

e. The funds for the 45 HEIs will be released as soon as the funds will be 
available. 

 
Auditor’s Rejoinder: 
The Audit Team shall validate compliance with the recommendations. 

I The B2HELP Unit and the Management took note of the recommendations as 

indicated in the AOM and adopted the following courses of actions: 
 

a. Requested to the CHED-CO for the extension of the processing of the 
payment of the financial assistance but was not granted due to the validity 

of appropriations for B2HELP under RA No. 11494 or the Bayanihan 2 Act 

has lapsed on December 19, 2020. In effect, CHEDRO I requested for the 

issuance of negative Sub-ARO for the reversion of unutilized funds dated 

December 29, 2020 so that the said fund could still be used to accommodate 

other students who are in need by other CHEDROs and were consequently 

approved by CHED-CO on January 05, 2021. 
 



144 

 

CHEDRO Comments 

b. B2HELP Coordinator reminded the remaining 23 PHEIs who have not 
claimed their checks and as of the reporting period, only four are still to be 

claimed. Further, CHEDRO I sent fax messages to all participating HEIs 

regarding their submission of scanned copies of LRs within 15 working days 

after receipt of the grant. 
 

c. Provisions of CMO No. 10 s. 2020 and Section 4(n) of RA No. 11494, 
otherwise known as the “Bayanihan to Recover as One Act,” will be strictly 

implemented by the Management to ensure the efficient and prompt payment 

of financial assistance to the qualified grantees under the B2HELP. 
 

d. The said Office, in coordination with Central Office, will pro-actively 
manage the monitoring and reporting activity. Moreover, appropriate actions 

will be promptly taken by the Management, which were deemed necessary. 
 

e. Accordingly, CHEDRO I had exerted its best effort to maximize the 
utilization of the down-loaded fund for this purpose despite circumstances 

beyond its control. 

XI Ineffective implementation of the B2HELP 
 

During the exit conference, the Management assured the Audit Team that there 

were no irregularities in the payments made for the B2HELP but only 

deficiencies with regard to compliance on the technicalities of the issued CMO. 

The oversights were primarily due to time constraints as they were only given 

seven days at the most to fill in the grantees and expedite the implementation 

of the program in December 2020. Management ensured compliance with the 

recommendations and will submit complete supporting documents. 
 

The following efforts were made by Management: An automated system to 

arrest double payment and duplicate names, and a more efficient validation 

system of submitted grantees/scholars against the HEIs' Enrollment List and 

Promotional Report, effective January 2021. As such, various virtual 

orientations were conducted to Registrars of HEIs in the Region. Issuance of 

RM No. 003 s. 2021 which sets forth the deadline for Submission of EL/PR to 

the Online Portal on March 15, 2021. Specifically, the Scholarship Unit sent 

out a letter dated February 24, 2021 to Tecarro College requesting for 

verification of five (5) BS Midwifery Students that are recently deemed to be 

not qualified for the grant. While, for DOSCST, the Office approved on 

February 24, 2021 its request for approval to identify qualified beneficiaries. 

Likewise, all DVs with lacking HEI applications documents were updated with 

complete required attachments. 
 

Currently, the Office already has its way or system of detecting overpayments. 

As a matter of fact, one of the SUCs has been notified and returned the 

identified overpayment. Copies of the Management's letters to the HEIs with 

inadvertent double payments are available for review to prove compliance with 

the recommendations. 
 

The Management directed both the Scholarship Coordinator and the 

Accountant to submit a written explanation/justification on why no disciplinary 



145 

 

CHEDRO Comments 

measure shall be meted against them for inefficiency in the performance of 

official duties and strict compliance with the guidelines of the scholarship grant 

or financial assistance programs are demanded through issuance of an Office 

Memorandum order. Moreover, copies of DVs with appropriate and required 

supporting documents were presented to the Audit Team. 

 

 

Audit of Utilization of COVID-19 Funds funded from HEDF 

 

Unreleased funds to Implementing SUCs for COVID-19 Response 

 

5. Funds totaling ₱20,266,619.39 intended for the implementation of nine approved 
CEB proposals for COVID-19 projects of five SUCs/HEIs under the Research 

and Development and Extension (RDE) Grants-in-Aid funded out of the HEDF 

were not released due to the inadequate monitoring, and non-enforcement of the 

liquidation of previous fund transfers, thereby defeating the objectives/purpose 

of the said projects to supplement, expand, improve and intensify existing 

COVID-19 responses.  

 

5.1 President Rodrigo Roa Duterte, through Proclamation No. 922 dated March 8, 
2020, declared the Philippines under the State of Public Health Emergency 

upon confirmation of local transmission of COVID-19 in the Philippines.  

Section 2 of Proclamation No. 922 states that: 
 

“All government agencies and Local Government Units (LGUs) are 

hereby enjoined to render full assistance and cooperation and 

mobilize the necessary resources to undertake critical, urgent, and 

appropriate response and measure in a timely manner to curtail and 

eliminate the COVID-19 threat.” 
 

5.2 CMO No. 1 s. 2020 dated April 2, 2020 prescribes the guidelines for the grant 
of assistance to SUCs to combat COVID-19. The SUCs are authorized by 

laws/charters to conduct research and extension services, including projects 

that will improve and intensify the government’s existing COVID-19 

responses. CHED undertakes its efforts to mobilize HEIs to assist in the 

production and distribution of items (such as disinfectants, alcohol face 

shields, etc.) for use by frontline service providers. 

 

5.3 The CHED issues guidelines in response to the national emergency by 
allocating/utilizing its funds towards mitigating the social, economic, and 

financial impact of COVID-19 on Filipinos. Under the same memorandum, 

the grant is open to SUCs to conduct extension and public service programs to 

combat COVID-19.  

 

5.4 The grant shall be charged against the HEDF under the Research and 
Scholarship Program under the supervision of the OPRKM.  The fund will be 



146 

 

deposited with any authorized government depository bank of the SUC nearest 

the program site. 

 

5.5 Moreover, SUCs are authorized by laws/charters to conduct research and 
extension services, including projects that will improve and intensify the 

government’s existing COVID-19 responses. In the report of the President to 

the Congress on March 30, 2020, the President had identified efforts 

undertaken by CHED such as mobilizing HEIs to assist in the production and 

distribution of items (such as disinfectants, alcohol, face shields, etc.) for use 

by frontline service providers. 

 

5.6 Item 1, Section V of the same CMO provides that “Each extension project 
shall be given funding based on the institutional grantee’s capacity to utilize 

within the grant period in accordance with government procurement, 

accounting, and auditing rules and regulations…” 

 

5.7 On the other hand, COA Circular No. 2016-002 dated December 19, 2016 
prescribes the revised guidelines and documentary requirements for Fund 

Transfers. As contained therein, the revised supporting document shall be a  

Certification by the Accountant that funds previously transferred to the IA has 

been liquidated and accounted for in the books and the  post-audit of 

transactions is not a prerequisite to the succeeding release of funds. 

 

5.8 For CY 2020, the budgeted amount for the implementation of COVID-19 
projects in SUCs/HEIs sourced from the RDE Grants-in-Aid under the HEDF 

amounted to  ₱93,969,916.87 and the status thereof  is  summarized below:

Total approved but not paid proposals 40,867,124.04  

 
5.13 As can be gleaned from the above table and based on the result of the interview 

with the OPRKM-RMD by the Audit Team, one of the main reasons why there 
were undisbursed CEB approved project proposals is the conservative 
approach of the CHED in the strict implementation of the COA regulations on 
Fund Transfer, particularly Item 3.1.1 of COA Circular No. 2012-001, as 
amended by COA Circular No. 2016-002, which discouraged them to pay the 
nine CEB approved proposals of five SUCs in the amount of ₱20,266,619.39 
due to existing unliquidated fund transfers. 



154 

 

5.14 Also, other factors that contributed to the undisbursed CEB approved project 
proposals are the pending submission of some requirements to the OPRKM 
like the revised MOA/proposals, revised CEB resolution, and pending 
compliance with the SRPs of Face Mask provided in pertinent DOH 
Memoranda. 

 
5.15 However, had  the OPRKM-RMD and HEDFS strictly monitored the 

liquidation of previous fund transfers to these five SUCs with nine approved 
proposals, the objectives of RA No. 11469, namely: to protect and support our 
health workers and front liners; provide supplies and equipment necessary for 
detecting the disease and caring to those infected; ensure that the community 
quarantines are effectively implemented; deliver essential necessities such as 
food and medicines to the most vulnerable; and mobilize all state assets to 
sustain the operation of the government, would have been maximized during 
this pandemic. 

 
5.16 We recommended that Management: 

 

a. send demand letters to defaulting recipients and, henceforth, strictly 
enforce the provisions of the aforementioned COA Circulars and the 

MOAs, particularly those pertaining to the submission of Fund 

Utilization Report (FUR), and in case of non-compliance, impose 

appropriate sanctions for their continued disregard of the rules and 

regulations on the timely settlement and/or liquidation of transferred 

fund; 
 

b. regularly monitor the utilization and liquidation of fund transfers and 
compliance by the concerned SUCs/NGAs with the reporting 

requirements to avoid delay in the granting of additional/new fund 

transfer; 
 

c. review and determine the current status of the project proposals and 
immediately process the request for extension from CHED, if 

warranted; and  
 

d. immediately update the Audit Team of the activities and submit the 
required documents upon availability. 

 

5.17 In a letter dated January 29, 2021, the OPRKM offered the following 
comments/explanations: 

 
a. OPRKM-RMD will continue to intensify its monitoring of projects. In 

2020, the RMD was able to conduct online, via Zoom/Google Meet, and 
document monitoring activities with 25 HEIs funded with research and 
extension projects in various stages of implementation.  Furthermore, 
RMD will also closely coordinate with other offices as some of the projects 
funded by HEDF that were already overdue are not under the management 
of OPRKM. 



155 

 

b. The pandemic affected the capacity of the RMD to undertake close 
monitoring since OPRKM had three positive cases in the past six months.  
Notwithstanding these limitations, RMD have been closely working with 
the SUCs to encourage and guide them to liquidate their reports by sending 
out communication letters and emails reminding them of their pending 
unliquidated accounts encouraging them to comply and settle said accounts 
and to submit their deliverables; 

 
c. OPRKM-RMD emphasized that while there had been delays in the release 

of funds, the need for the projects is still present considering that the state 
of public health emergency has been extended until September 2021 by 
virtue of Proclamation No. 1021, s. 2020. It was foreseen by the 
Commission when it provided for automatic extensions if the community 
quarantines are also extended. Further, even with the deployment of 
vaccines, these protective supplies are still needed as long as herd 
immunity is not yet attained, as explained by an expert from the Vaccine 
Education Center in Philadelphia. 

 
d. Additionally, to cope with the issues identified, the OPRKM-RMD will 

continue to monitor ongoing projects together with HEDFS and require 
submission of terminal reports. It will update the Audit Team of the 
activities and will submit the required documents upon availability. It will 
also continue to send demand letters to HEIs with unliquidated fund 
transfers and conduct a webinar to orient them on the funding structure of 
CHED.  For SUCs with pending submission of project deliverables, the 
OPRKM-RMD will continue to seek guidance and assistance from the 
Chairman and Commissioners of CHED, who serve as Chairs of the SUC 
governing boards, in following-up the submission of deliverables. 

 

 

Deficiencies in the implementation of five COVID-19 projects 
 

6. Deficiencies in the implementation of five COVID-19 projects totaling 
₱5,531,656.13 were noted such as low and/or non-production and distribution of 

goods/items to frontliners/beneficiaries and fewer jobs generated than the 

expected output/deliverables as committed in the approved working 

plans/project proposals, contrary to the provisions of MOA entered into with 

CHED, thus the objectives of the projects were not fully achieved. Moreover, 

Terminal Reports (TRs) submitted by SUCs were supported with incomplete 

documentation, which caused delays in the processing and recording of 

liquidation, thereof. 
 

6.1 Chairman J. Prospero E. De Vera III had issued Memorandum dated April 2, 
2020, inviting the Presidents and Officers-in-Charge of the SUCs to submit 

project proposals for the grant of assistance to SUCs to combat COVID-19 in 

support to the initiative of the government in providing the needs of the citizens 



156 

 

and health workers during the State of Public Health Emergency or State of 

Calamity. 

 

6.2 Proposed projects must be completed within two to three months from the date 
of release of the grant and should fall under any or a combination of the 

following categories: 

 

• Manufacturing of products listed in Annex B of GPPB Resolution                      
No. 3-2020 dated 9 March 2020, except for drugs/medicines, as evidenced 

by the involvement of licensed chemists, pharmacists, and/or 

microbiologist in the team; 

• Preparation of food for consumption of DOH, AFP, PNP frontliners and 
stranded students including marginalized communities only during the 

period of community quarantine; 

• Deployment of volunteers to assist healthcare frontliners in contact tracing, 
databasing, and other similar services; and 

• Other urgently needed equipment, expertise and capability to be 
determined by the Commission and/or the Inter-agency Task Force for the 

Management of Emerging Infectious Disease and/or the Chief 

Implementer Against COVID-19. 

 

6.3 CMO No. 1 s. 2020 dated April 2, 2020 was later issued to provide guidelines 
for the grant of assistance to SUCs to combat COVID-19. Project proposals 

submitted by the SUCs were subjected to a review process by the panel 

designated by the Commission which includes the director-in-charge of the 

office, director of HEDFS and a technical expert. After deliberation, the agreed 

revisions were reflected in writing and constituted as an amendment of the 

proposal. Approved proposals were endorsed to the OPRKM who prepares the 

MOA, ORS and DV for the signature of the authorized signatories. The total 

value of the project was then released in full to the SUCs within three working 

days after the Chairman’s approval for payment. The grant is for a period of 

two to three months from the release of funds and is automatically extended 

should the community quarantine is extended by government beyond the three-

month period. Provided, that grantees shall have 60 days from the end of the 

grant period to liquidate and submit terminal reports. 

 

6.4 Based on the MOA executed by CHED and various SUCs, CHED, through its 
HEDF, shall provide funding assistance to the SUCs for the implementation of 

the approved extension programs/project to be released in full in accordance 

with the approved LIB, Work Plan (WP) and Terms of Reference (TOR). 

Likewise, the recipient SUCs shall properly utilize the funds provided by 

CHED and see to it that these are used for the purposes for which the same are 

intended, in accordance with the approved WP and TOR, and subject to the 

usual accounting and auditing rules and regulations. 

 



157 

 

6.5 Monitoring and evaluation of the extension projects, as well as the compliance 
with the project deliverables and timelines, are done by the CHED OPRKM 

wherein grantees are required to send thru email, regular weekly updates to the 

Commission or as requested by the Commission, comprising the following: 

 

a) Properly captioned SUC personnel/volunteers in action, e.g., conducting 
the project or delivering assistance to communities; 

 

b) No. of units of goods provided and/or services rendered to beneficiaries as 
of reporting date together with a description of these goods and/or services; 

 

c) List of recipient/s who received the goods and/or service rendered (i.e., 
LGU); and 

 

d) Challenges encountered in the field, if any, including recommended 
solutions. 

 

6.6 Review of the TRs submitted by the SUCs revealed the following:  
 

a. Five COVID-19 projects were reported to have low or non-production and 
distribution of items/goods to frontliners/beneficiaries and another project 

was reported to have generated fewer jobs than the expected output as 

committed in the project proposal/working plan approved by the CEB as

b. As presented in the table above, targeted production of 28,000 bottles of 
alcohol was not reached by SLSU having produced 27,176 bottles only 

with a shortage of 824 bottles. Based on the TR submitted, alcohol is a new 

product being manufactured by them, hence minimal variations were 

encountered during the manufacturing process due to its volatile 

characteristics and spillage occurred during bottling activity. 

 

On the other hand, NEUST was not able to achieve their target to generate 

100 jobs with only 59 actual jobs generated, leaving a difference of 41 jobs, 

hence the primary objective of the said SUC to create more jobs amid 

pandemic was not fully achieved. 

 

c. Additionally, PSAU distributed only 15 kgs. of assorted vegetables seeds, 
which was way lower than the target of 200-300 kgs. of seeds. 

 

d. Meanwhile, IFSU reported lower production and distribution of carrot 
juice and lemon jam with a difference of 3,551 and 1,022 bottles, 

respectively. Also, the production of 4,881 bottles of lemon marmalade 

and 54,000 pcs. of Moringa pandesal did not materialize. Among the 

challenges encountered, as mentioned in the TR submitted by IFSU, are 



159 

 

slow procurement process and postponement of production and 

distribution of pandesal due to lockdown declared by the Municipality of 

Lagawe because of the increasing number of COVID-19 positive cases. 

 

e. Had the SUCs exerted extra efforts to achieve their target deliverables or 
expected outputs, more frontline service providers will benefit from the 

projects. 

 

f. Further, TRs submitted by the SUCs with completed projects were not 
supported with complete documentation. Lacking documents per SUC are

The submission of TRs with incomplete documentation by the SUCs-

grantees caused delay in the processing and recording of liquidation. 

 

6.7 We recommended that the Management: 
 

a. require justification/explanation from SUCs with accomplishments 
lower than the expected output per approved working plan/project 

proposals;  

 

b. instruct CHED-OPRKM to: 
 

• conduct thorough review of TRs submitted by SUCs, further 
evaluate its actual accomplishments and analyze differences from 

the expected outputs, determine corresponding costs of the 

differences and require possible refunds (if any); and 

 

• follow up and require SUCs to expedite the submission of lacking 
documents to facilitate the immediate processing and recording of 

liquidation. 



161 

 

6.8 In a letter dated February 5, 2021, the OPRKM offered the following 
comments: 

 

a. For the five COVID-19 projects reported to have low or non-production 
and distribution of items/goods to frontliners/beneficiaries and another 

project reported to have generated fewer jobs than the expected output as 

committed in the project proposal/working plan approved by the CEB, the 

following justifications from the SUCs were noted: 
 

• SLSU – The SLSU explained that the difference in the number of 
bottles produced can be traced to the percentage yield of alcohol.  

Based on the matrix submitted by SLSU duly signed by its President, 

they explained that losses were due to spillage, leakage due to defective 

bottles as well as evaporation during production.  A meeting will be set 

by the OPRKM with the technical expert and project team to discuss 

the justification of SUC. 
 

• PSAU – The PSAU inadvertently excluded in the submitted TR the 
distribution of 752 kg. of mungbean seeds produced/harvested at the 

PSAU production which is 452 kg. above the 200 to 300 kg. target of 

the Project Team that were also included in the 1,530 food packs 

distributed to the identified beneficiaries. OPRKM likewise requested 

the PSAU Project Team to submit soonest the revised TR to include 

the mungbean distributed by the Project Team. 
 

• IFSU – The IFSU clarified that by volume, they exceeded their 
committed deliverable (total deliverables of IFSU are 4,818,000 

milliliters of carrot juice, and the produced carrot juice is 5,502,350 

milliliters) because they were able to produce 15,721 bottles of carrot 

juice with 350 ml as against the target mentioned in their proposal of 

19,272 (250 ml) bottles. The Project Team further explained that they 

were not able to purchase 250 ml bottles since these were not readily 

available in their area, thus they had to use 350 ml bottles instead. 
 

As for the lemon marmalade, although it was mentioned in the proposal 

as part of the deliverables, the Project Team was not able to include 

sufficient provision for the production of both lemon marmalade and 

jam in their LIB. Apart from the deliverables, the IFSU Project Team 

was also able to train and hire five women to work for the production 

of carrot juice and lemon jam. 
 

For the IFSU project titles: PandeSALAMAT ng IFSU, several emails/ 

communications were sent by OPRKM reminding the Project Team to 

submit the project deliverables including the TR, LRs as well as other 

pertinent documents to be submitted. 

 



162 

 

• NEUST - They mentioned that they were able to tap 59 sewers in the 
area because some of the sewers that were supposed to be included in 

the project were residents of areas with high cases of COVID-19 

infection, with quarantine restrictions being imposed by the LGUs, the 

Project Team had to concentrate on areas that were considered safe to 

navigate for the delivery of raw materials, monitoring for quality 

control and retrieval of finished products. Despite the challenges 

encountered by the Project Team, they were able to produce a total of 

100,916 facemasks, 916 pcs. higher than the targeted 100,000 pieces, 

and 1,100 gowns. 
 

b. As for the measure undertaken to address the issue on lacking documents 
submitted, the following have been implemented by the OPRKM-RMD: 

 

• Conduct regular monitoring and evaluation activities with technical 
experts and HEDF representative to reiterate and remind the HEIs of 

their responsibilities to submit. 

• Send out demand letters/emails to the HEIs with pending project 
deliverables. 

• RMD personnel and project technical staff have been assigned to 
closely monitor the SUCs with pending deliverables, emails, SMS and 

even phone calls have been made to remind them of their submissions. 

• For SUCs with pending submission of research and extension project 
deliverables, the OPRKM-RMD may seek guidance and assistance 

from the Chairman and Commissioners of the SUC governing boards 

in following up the submission of deliverables. 

 

 

Non-submission by the grantees of the regular weekly updates/reports of the Projects  

 

7. The inability of CHED to strictly monitor the implementation of the projects as 
well as the compliance with the project deliverables and timelines of recipient 

SUCS of COVID-19 funds, resulted in the non-submission of weekly updates of 

the projects by the grantees as required in the MOA and resulted also in delays 

or even non-submission of TRs and LRs which prevented the CHED from the 

immediate assessment of the output achieved for each approved proposal. 

 

7.1 Section VI of CMO No. 1, s. 2020 provides the Monitoring and Evaluation of 
the extension projects for COVID-19 responses such as: 

 

a) In order to keep track of the implementation of the project as well as the 
compliance with the project deliverables and timelines, grantees shall send 

regular weekly updates to the Commission or as requested by the 

Commission, comprising of the following:  

 

• Properly captioned pictures of SUC personnel/volunteers in action, 
e.g., conducting the project or delivering assistance to communities; 



163 

 

• No of units of goods provided and/or services rendered to beneficiaries 
as of reporting date together with a description of these goods and/or 

services; 

• List of recipient/s who received the goods and/or services rendered 
(i.e., LGU); and 

• Challenges encountered in the field, if any, including the recommended 
solutions. 

 

These shall be sent to research@ched.gov.ph cc: 

executivedirector@ched.gov.ph and chairperson@ched.gov.ph 

 

b) The OPRKM shall consolidate the reports for the information of the 
Commission en banc and the Management Committee.  

 

7.2 Furthermore, the MOA also provides that the Second Party shall: a) submit 
regular weekly updates/report to the First Party to include properly 

documented reports with complete attachments; b) submit 

accomplishment/TR to the First Party within 60 days after the completion of 

the program; and  c) submit a LR to the First Party, certified correct by the 

Accountant and approved by the head of the institution within 60 days after 

the completion of the program. 

 

7.3 Twelve proposals of 10 SUCs were documented to have reached the proposed 
approved project duration and some SUCs even exceeded their projected 

timeline, while only two proposals of two SUCs were considered delayed in 

the projected time duration, details are as follows:

7.4 It should be noted that it is the standard operating procedure of the Commission 
to issue an approved CEB Resolution to officially authorize the request for 

extension of the proposals of the SUCs beyond their proposed duration. 

 

7.5 Compliance with the Monitoring and Evaluation of the extension projects of 
the SUCs by the CHED-OPRKM as per verification made by the Audit Team 

with the OPRKM-RMD revealed that the proponent uses a Progress Tracking 

Tool.  This tool was submitted by the proponent to the OPRKM-RMD via e-

mail (in the form of either Google sheet/Excel file/pdf file), to update the status 



165 

 

of the project deliverables and timeline. The said tool contains the (a) Project 

Summary, (b) Physical Accomplishment, (c) Financial Status and 

Implementation. Also, aside from the Progress Tracking Tool, it was noted that 

some SUCs also submit a progress report/narrative report which provides the 

properly captioned pictures of SUC personnel/volunteers in action. However, 

it was observed that the submission of these mentioned reports was not made 

on a regular weekly basis to the OPRKM-RMD, thus there were no 

consolidated reports for the information of the CEB and the Management 

Committee which defeated the objective of overseeing the status of the project 

implementation. 

 

7.6 In the interview conducted with the OPRKM-RMD, it was mentioned that the 
commencement of the submission of these monitoring reports was not 

explicitly specified in the CMO guidelines, and was interpreted by them that 

this should be done by the proponent only when they are ready for the 

distribution of the products (latter part/end stage) because it will caption the 

pictures, person responsible and actions and accomplishments. 

 

7.7 Likewise, OPRKM also added that the generation of the said documentation is 
another work in itself that was not anticipated because the proponent needs a 

salaried dedicated person to produce the properly documented weekly 

accomplishment reports with attachments.  Thus, given the urgent need to 

deliver the goods to the frontliners and the communities, the proponent 

prioritized the actual work since the SUCs would have to account for the result 

in their submitted TRs. 

 

7.8 The OIC-Division Chief of OPRKM-RMD forwarded the received TRs and 
LRs for the extension proposals for COVID-19 grants to the Audit Team on 

January 18 and 19, 2021, which also contains the Notice to Proceed (NTP) to 

SUC. 

 

7.9 An NTP is issued by the Executive Director of the CHED to formally inform 
the SUC of the official commencement of the approved proposals of the SUCs 

as supported by the MOA and a CEB resolution.   Moreover, in compliance 

with the CMO No. 1 guidelines and MOA, TRs and LRs are submitted by the 

SUCs to the CHED after sixty days from the end of the grant period. Analysis 

of the submitted NTPs, TRs and LRs shows the following observations:

7.10 Based on the data from the table above, out of the fourteen approved proposals 
of ten SUCs, one NTP was not yet presented to the Audit Team, while three 

NTPs were not signed/acknowledged by the SUC President and/or not dated, 

contrary to the instruction provided in the said document to indicate the date 

of receipt and acceptance therein, which further prevented the proper 

determination of the counting of the delay (if there is any) of the 

commencement of the proposal by the Audit Team. 

 

7.11 Moreover, although the URS completed their project proposal of production 
of washable face mask to frontliners within one month duration (instead of two 

months based on the proposal), it can be noted that they have a considerable 

delay in the commencement of their activity which was only done on 

November 25, 2020, or a delay of 42 days (from October 14 to November 25), 

which should have started on October 1 or seven days thereafter following the 

receipt of the notice from the Commission, thereby, defeating the main 

objective of urgent responding to COVID-19. 

 

7.12 Likewise, eight out of the 14 TRs submitted to CHED is considered delayed 
in the timeline of submission which ranges from 40 up to 85 number of days’ 

delay.   Further, the non-submission of the six LRs and delayed submission of 



168 

 

two LRs which ranges from 59 to 65 days is considered not in compliance with 

the provided guidelines and signed MOA between the two parties which 

prevented the immediate assessment of the output achieved for each proposal 

and the timely liquidation of the same. 

 

7.13 Lastly, based on the Status of COVID-19 Projects received from the OPRKM, 
three SUCs were claimed to have been completed, but have not yet submitted 

their TRs and LRs to OPRKM-RMD. Details are as follows:

With approved request for

31, 2020. OPRKM-RMD 

received a report on 

January 14, 2020. 

Proponent justifying the 

delay and non-completion 

of project deliverables. 

 

7.14 As can be gleaned from the above-noted observations, had the OPRKM-RMD 
strictly monitored and required the submission of the regular weekly updates, 

TRs and LRs from the SUCs to keep track of the implementation of the 

projects, the SUCs would have fully complied with the submission of these 

mentioned reports within the specified period and assessment of the objectives 

and purpose of providing immediate response of the government against the 

COVID-19 virus could have been addressed. 

 

7.15 We recommended that the Management: 
 

a. require the SUCs to submit to the OPRKM-RMD Office the regular 
weekly updates/reports with complete attachments as mentioned in 

the CMO guidelines and MOA and for the OPRKM-RMD to strictly 

monitor the submission and compliance of the said reports within the 

timelines; 
 

b. monitor and review the submission of the TRs of the project proposals 
from the SUCs and secure justification/s for cause of delays, if any; 

and 



169 

 

c. immediately update the Audit Team of the activities and submit the 
TRs and LRs upon availability. 

 

7.16 In a letter dated February 5, 2021, the OPRKM offered the following 
comments/explanations: 

 

a. IFSU explained that the delays were attributable to the problems in the 
delivery of the requested materials and supplies for the project, papers 

submitted in the procurement office were not processed immediately, the 

team had a limited schedule of travel for follow-ups and deliveries due to 

community quarantine measures. On the other hand, the BASC requested 

for an extension and was discussed during the CEB meeting on December 

29, 2020, and the corresponding signed CEB Resolution has been 

requested by OPRKM on January 6, 2021. 

 

b. The justification offered by the SUCs on the delayed submission of TR and 
LRs are as follows:  

 

• Delays in the processing of the attachments/documents to the report 
due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic; 

• The imposition of the ECQ in Catarman, Northern Samar from October 
15 to November 30, 2020, skeletal workforce arrangement in the 

University due to ECQ as well as several employees of the University 

tested positive for SARS-COV 2; and 

• The requested materials and supplies for the project were delivered 
late, the papers submitted in the procurement office were not processed 

immediately, and the team had a limited schedule of travel for follow-

ups and deliveries due to community quarantine measures. 

 

Moreover, the OPRKM emphasized that given the provisions of the MOA 

under Section XI and the extension of community quarantine all over the 

country, the automatic extension clause could be availed of, subject to 

confirmation should there be expenses that will be incurred during the 

period; 

 

c. OPRKM sent out email communications to three SUCs (i.e., IFSU, SLSU, 
and ZCSPC) with completed projects and have reminded them of the 

submission of their deliverables. The SLSU has submitted a copy of both 

liquidation and terminal reports, while follow-up emails were sent by the 

OPRKM to the remaining two SUCs; and 

 

d. OPRKM committed to strictly abide by the audit recommendations to 
further improve the project management.

Audit on the implementation of Priority Programs of CHED 

 

Lapses in the implementation of TES Program 

 

8. Deficiencies were noted in the implementation of the TES Program such as: a) 
delay in the release of financial benefits to student-grantees totaling 

₱2,081,165,400.00 in CHEDROs I and XIII; b) inclusion of eight TES grantees 

with grants totaling ₱198,000.00 who are not in the master list extracted from the 

TES Management Portal of the Private Education Assistance Committee (PEAC) 

in CHEDRO X; c) payment to 39 ineligible student grantees totaling 

₱2,340,000.00 in CHEDRO I; d) double scholarship grants to 76 students in the 

first semester of AY 2019-2020 in CHEDRO III; e) unliquidated/delayed 

liquidation of fund transfers totaling ₱3,819,897,154.17 in CHED-CO and 

CHEDROs NCR and I; f) significant amount of refunds from SUCs totaling 

₱202,038,053.95 in CHED-CO primarily due to unutilized/excess TES and 

administrative cost, as well as refunds on account of duplicate entries in the name 

of beneficiaries; g) lapses in  monitoring the submission of LRs  by PHEIs in 

CHEDRO NCR; h) incomplete and inappropriate documents supporting TES 

liquidation totaling ₱124,341,600.00 in CHEDRO NCR, which are not in 

consonance with the provisions of RA No. 10931, CHED UniFAST Board 

Memorandum TES-07-2018, dated November 12, 2018, Section 5.1 of UniFAST 

Memorandum Circular (MC) No. 2019-001 s. 2019, Section 4(6) of PD No. 1445, 

casting doubts on the regularity, reliability and accuracy of the amounts 

transferred to SUCs, CHED-recognized LUCs and PHEIs. 

 

8.1 RA No. 10931, known as the Universal Access to Quality Tertiary Education 
Act, declared that quality education is an inalienable right of all Filipinos and 
it is the policy of the State to protect and promote the rights of all students to 
quality education at all levels. It provides free tuition and other school fees in 
SUCs, LUCs and State-run Technical Vocational Institutions (TVIs), 
establishes the TES and Student Loan Program (SLP), strengthens the 
UniFAST for Tertiary Education and appropriates funds therefor. 
 

8.2 Section 7 of RA No. 10931 provides that: 
 

“To support the cost of tertiary education or any part or portion 

thereof, a TES is hereby established for all Filipino students who 

shall enroll in undergraduate-post-secondary programs of SUCs, 

LUCs, PHEIs and all TVIs. The TES shall be administered by the 

UniFAST Board and the amount necessary to fund the TES shall be 

included in the budget of CHED and TESDA: Provided, that 

prioritization shall be given to students in the following order: (a) 

students who are part of households included in the Listahanan 2.0, 

ranked according to the estimated per capita household income; and 

(b) students not part of the Listahanan 2.0, ranked according to 

estimate per capita household income based on submitted 

documentation of proof of income to be determined by the UniFAST 



171 

 

Board: Provided, further, that such prioritization shall not apply to 

Filipino students in cities and municipalities with no existing SUC 

and LUC campus.” 
 

8.3 UniFAST MC No. 2018-0004 dated October 15, 2018 or the Guidelines on the 
Implementation of the TES for Filipino Students provides, among others, the 

following: 
 

a. Section 6.3 (c) requires students not included in the master list to submit to 
the UniFAST Secretariat through the CHEDROs the following 

documentary requirements: 1) completed application form; 2) photograph 

of the applicant; and 3) documents of proof of income, which include any 

of the following: i) Income Tax Return, if applicable; ii) Bureau of Internal 

Revenue Form 2316, if applicable; and iii) Barangay Certificate of 

Indigency, if applicable, provided that it is also certified by the Municipal 

Social Welfare Development. 
 

b. Section 10.1 states that an amount equivalent to not more than three percent 
of the TES and the student loan allocation provided under the Act may be 

used as administrative cost by the UniFAST. 
 

c. Section 10.2 states that the UniFAST Board shall determine the amount of 
administrative costs to be transferred to SUCs, CHED-recognized LUCs 

and PHEIs with TES beneficiaries and TESDA. 
 

d. Section 11.2.A(2) provides that if a student is enrolled in a SUC or LUC 
listed in the Registry, the full-year grant for TES-2 shall be equivalent to 

₱40,000.00 for the academic year. The TES-2 pertains to allowance for 

books, supplies, transportation, and miscellaneous personal expenses, 

including a reasonable allowance for the documented rental or purchase of 

personal computer or laptop and other education-related expenses as well 

as allowance for room and board costs incurred by the student. 
 

8.4 Section 5.1 of UniFAST MC No. 2019-001 s. 2019 states that the TES student-
grantee shall be entitled to a maximum of ₱60,000.00 as grant per academic 

year or ₱30,000.00 as grant per semester. The maximum payment to the HEI 

of ₱60,000.00 per academic year is set regardless of the actual amount of 

tuition and other school fees charged by the institution. The grant is intended 

to cover academic and extra-curricular expenses, including tuition, 

miscellaneous and other school fees, purchase of textbooks, board and lodging, 

transportation, clothing, admission/entrance fees, health and other valid related 

education expenses and support services to complete the student-grantee’s 

degree program. The breakdown is as follows: 
 

Particulars Unit Cost  Total Cost/Year

Total ₱60,000.00 

 
8.5 Paragraph 8.0 of the same MC provides the guidelines on the liquidation of 

transferred funds for proper reporting on the release of TES to student-
grantees, the pertinent portions of which are quoted below: 
 

1. The private HEI shall submit to the CHEDRO the FUR (in two 
copies, original copy to CHEDRO and duplicate copy to 
UniFAST Secretariat) duly certified by the private HEI's 
Accountant and/or Vice President for Finance, approved by the 
private HEI’s President and duly verified by the private HEI's 
External Auditor, with the following documents enclosed: Xxx 

 

2. The FUR should be issued by the private HEI within 30 days 
upon receipt of fund transfer on TES. 

 

3. Unused funds due to dropping of TES student-grantee(s) prior 
to the release of TES student-grantee's share should be returned 
to CHED-AFMS through the CHEDRO. It shall be the 
responsibility of the private HEI to inform the CHEDRO of the 
status of students, i.e., did not enroll for the semester, dropped 
out in the middle of the semester, dropped from the rolls, subject 
to maximum residency rule, or with administrative or 
disciplinary sanction which shall affect the disbursement of the 
TES to the student-grantee. 

 
8.6 Further, a TES grantee will be paid through the PHEIs based on the validated 

and certified List of TES grantees issued by the CHEDROs duly prepared by 
the designated UniFAST Regional Coordinators after a thorough verification 
and validation of required documents. Also, the CHED-AFMS will release the 
funds through the CHEDROs for the TES qualified student-grantees enrolled 
in PHEIs. 

 
8.7 Section 4(6) of PD No. 1445 states that claims against government funds shall 

be supported with complete documentation. 
 

8.8 COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012 defines “irregular” 
expenditure as an expenditure incurred without adhering to established rules, 
regulations, procedural guidelines, policies, principles or practices that have 



173 

 

gained recognition in laws. Irregular expenditures are incurred if funds are 
disbursed without conforming to prescribed usages and rules of discipline. 
There is no observance of an established pattern, course, mode of action, 
behavior, or conduct in the incurrence of an irregular expenditure. A 
transaction conducted in a manner that deviates or departs from, or which does 
not comply with standards set is deemed irregular. A transaction which fails to 
follow or violates appropriate rules of procedure is, likewise, irregular.    

 
8.9 Review of the implementation of the TES Program by SUCs, CHED-

recognized LUCs and PHEIs disclosed deficiencies as discussed in the 
succeeding paragraphs. 

 

a. Delayed release of financial benefits totaling ₱2,081,165,400.00 
 

8.10 Audit revealed that the release of the financial benefits in CHEDROs I and 
XIII amounting to ₱1,216,974,900.00 and ₱864,190,500.00, respectively, or a 

total of ₱2,081,165,400.00 was delayed, thus depriving the student-grantees 

the timely use thereof.  

 

8.11 In CHEDRO I, the number of days delay is shown as follows: 
 

Academic Year Academic Term

2020-2021 First semester No Funds transferred yet to 

CHEDRO I 

150 days 

Total  1,216,974,900.00  

 

8.12 Inquiry made with some of the student-grantees revealed that they received 
their TES benefits at the end of the respective semesters or even at the end of 
the academic school year. 
 

8.13 Due to the delay in the release of the funds, some of the students obtained loans 
to pay for their miscellaneous and other school fees. Other students applied the 
benefits received to the remaining balance of their tuition fees of the previous 
semester. It was also learned that some student-grantees failed to enroll due to 
financial problems while some had dropped or transferred to other schools. 

 
8.14 Further, the Sub-ARO for the TES benefits for AY 2020-2021 was received 

on December 11, 2020 but the NTA was not yet received by CHEDRO I at 
year-end and the Masterlist of Grantees was not yet approved by the Region I 



174 

 

UniFAST due to ongoing validation of the documentary requirements 
submitted by the school considering that the academic year is about to end. 
 

8.15 In the case of CHEDRO XIII, verification of records disclosed that there were 
TES benefits for AY 2018-2019 aggregating ₱7,045,200.00, which were 
belatedly released in March 2020 to the student-grantees through the PHEIs, 
as presented below: 

 

Particulars No. of Grantees Amount Date Released 

Student with Disability  4  123,600.00  March 2020

2nd Semester, AY 2018-2019 105 3,244,500.00  

Total 228 7,045,200.00    

 

8.16 Moreover, it was noted that for AY 2019-2020, TES benefits with a total 
amount of ₱857,145,300.00 were released to different PHEIs starting May 
2020 to December 2020, as summarized below:

Total 14,592 13,129 24 857,145,300.00  

 

8.17 The above table shows that TES benefits for the 1st Semester covering August 
to December 2019 were released to the PHEIs starting May 2020, which was 

five months after the semester ended. Likewise, the release for the 2nd semester 

covering January to May 2020 started in the month of September 2020, which 

was four months after the semester ended. 

 

8.18 Inquiry with one of the UniFAST Regional Coordinators revealed that the TES 
benefits were released by batch and according to the prioritization set by the 

UniFAST Board. The last batch of TES benefits for AY 2018-2019 was 

released late in March 2020 as the release of the first batch of TES benefits 

was also delayed. Moreover, for AY 2019-2020, additional billing procedures 

were implemented in coordination with PEAC, a duly authorized entity under 

the law to jointly implement the TES with UniFAST in all PHEIs. TES billings 

by the PHEIs were meticulously checked and verified by the PEAC. Billings 

with deficiencies and lacking documents were returned to PHEIs and would 

not be approved unless all requirements were submitted. These factors 

contributed to the delay of the implementation and release of TES Benefits for 

AY 2019-2020.   



175 

 

8.19 The program’s objective is to support the cost of tertiary education to students 
who are academically able yet economically disadvantaged, thus delayed 
release of TES benefits deprived the student-grantees of the timely benefits of 
the program. 

 
8.20 We recommended that the Management:  

 

CHEDRO I 
 

a. pro-actively coordinate with CHED-CO to expedite the transfer of 
funds to CHEDRO I to facilitate the immediate release of the financial 

benefits to PHEIs that should coincide with the start of each semester 

of every academic year; and 
 

b. require UniFAST to track the submission of validated and certified list 

of qualified TES grantees to CHEDRO I as their basis for payment of 

benefits to avoid delay in the release of funds to PHEIs;  
 

CHEDRO XIII 
 

c. require the UniFAST Regional Coordinators to coordinate with the 
UniFAST Secretariat and other concerned Offices for the timely 

release of TES benefits funds; and  

 

d. continuously initiate appropriate measures and strategies to ensure 
efficient release of subsidy to the student-grantees through the PHEIs.  

 

8.21 The Management commented that the initial implementation of RA No. 10931 
in AY 2018-2019 was highly centralized such that submission of required 

documents from applicants, evaluation of the same and final list of grantees 

per HEI come from the CO. This is a limitation of CHEDRO I because they 

await for the downloading of the funds to pay the grantees in the master list 

which is their final output after the evaluation process. It could be gleaned in 

the Disbursement Tracker prepared from the time the funds were received from 

Central Office to the date of transfer to PHEIs.  

 

b. Grants totaling ₱198,000.00 to eight TES grantees who are not in the master list 
 

8.22 Section 5.3 of MC No. 2018-0004 dated October 15, 2018 states that:  
 

“A. UNIFAST shall generate the official master list of eligible TES 

beneficiaries. The generation of said list shall be centralized and 

administered solely by the UniFAST. This list shall henceforth be 

referred to as the ‘master list’. 
 

B. UniFAST shall generate the master list following the guidelines 

on student prioritization stated in Section 4 of the Act and Section 5.1 

in these guidelines.”  



176 

 

8.23 Further, Section 5.4 of the MC provides for the allocation of TES, thus: 
 

“A. The TES shall be allocated directly to the student, subject to the 
prioritization indicated in section 5.1 of these guidelines; provided 
that, the assessment and awarding of benefits and the disbursements 
of benefits shall be subject to Sections 6.4 and 6.5, respectively, of 
these guidelines. 
 

 B. The TES shall be first allocated to those in the master list; 
 

Provided that, the UniFAST Board shall create a mechanism for the 
initial allocation of funds between students enrolling in higher 
education programs and TVET programs;  
 

(2) Provided further that, for students enrolling in higher education 
programs, the UniFAST Board shall create a mechanism for the 
initial allocation of funds between students enrolling in HEIs with 
Academic Year beginning during in the 2nd quarter of the Calendar 
Year and those enrolling in HEIs with Academic Year beginning in 
the 3rd quarter of the Calendar Year. 
 

C.   If there are remaining TES funds after allocating for those in the 
master list, these funds shall be made available to qualified students 
through open applications for the remaining slots, subject to 
operational procedures in Section 6.3 of these guidelines and the 
UniFAST Board approval.” 

 

8.24 Post-audit of payments of financial benefits under the TES in CHEDRO X 
revealed eight student-grantees with grant totaling ₱198,000.00 are not listed 

in the master list extracted from the TES Management System Portal of the 

PEAC, contrary to Sections 5.3 and 5.4 of CHED MC No. 2018-0004. 
 

8.25 We recommended that the Management: 
 

a. prioritize the allocation of TES slots to those listed in the master list of 
eligible student-beneficiaries; 
 

b. properly attach the master list of TES grantees extracted from the 
TES Management System Portal of the PEAC as supporting document 
to the DV upon payment; and 
 

c. strictly adhere to the pertinent guidelines under CHED MC No. 2018-
0004 for the allocation of TES. 

 

8.26 In their letter dated February 4, 2021, the Management commented that the 
names of those who were allegedly not included in the attached master list 

extracted from the TES Management System Portal of the PEAC are eligible 

TES grantees. Their names are among the 41,442 verified and validated TES 

grantees in AY 2019-2020 in Region X. 



177 

 

8.27 The Management explained further during the Exit Conference that they have 
no hold in the grantees of TES. It is the UniFAST that selects, validates, and 

verifies the eligible students and only the list will be sent to the regional office. 

They said that the list is protected and only one person from the HEI can access 

the master list. The Audit Team suggested rechecking the correctness of the 

attached master list of TES grantees to the DVs before submission to COA. 

 

c. Payment to 39 ineligible student-grantees-₱2,340,000.00  
 

8.28 As a matter of policy, the TES intends to promote social justice and 
advancement of nation-building recognizing the inalienable right of all 

Filipinos to quality education and thus protects and promotes the right of all 

Filipino students to accessible quality education. In cases where cities and 

municipalities have no existing SUCs or CHED-recognized LUCs, student-

grantees are eligible for the financial benefits, provided that students are able 

to show proof of residency that they are residing in the city and municipality 

where the said private HEI is located. 

 

8.29 The Audit Team in CHEDRO I observed that there were 39 grantees who did 
not meet the requirements set forth under the Implementing Rules and 

Regulations (IRR) of RA No. 10931 and the Memorandum from the Office of 

the Executive Director No. TES-07-2018 dated November 12, 2018 but were 

given assistance under TES with total amount of ₱2,340,000.00.  

 

8.30 The paid TES grantees were categorized under the priority order of PHEIs with 
no SUCs or LUCs. However, proof of residency in their respective 

Identification Data (IDs) showed that they are not residents of the cities and 

municipalities with no existing SUCs or CHED-recognized LUCs. There were 

discrepancies noted between the submitted Certificate of Residency issued by 

various Barangay Captains and the address indicated in their IDs. 

 

8.31 Upon inquiry on the process of validation and verification of TES applicants 
conducted, CHEDRO I only verified the completeness and correctness of the 

documentary requirements submitted by the Participating HEIs. They relied 

on the submitted Certificate of Residency issued by various Barangay Captains 

and no further validation was conducted to confirm the authenticity of such 

documents. 

 

8.32 Moreover, the Audit Team also noted that “Residency” was not properly 
defined in the IRR of RA No. 10931 nor in any issued CHED Memorandum. 

 

8.33 We recommended to the Management to require the recipient HEIs to 
return the fund transfers which were granted to ineligible beneficiaries. 

 

8.34 The Management commented that the 39 grantees are apparently eligible 
because their temporary residences are where their school is located. Further,

their school also meets the qualification as Private HEI with No SUCs or LUCs 

(PNSL). The operational definition of residency was not very specific in the 

UniFAST IRR. With COA's observation, CHEDRO I had requested the 

CHED-CO for clarification on the definition of residency as used therein. To 

date, the Agency is still waiting for their response. Appropriate action on 

alleged payment to ineligible grantees will be done by the Agency upon receipt 

of CHED-CO's clarificatory statements in this regard. 

 

d. Double scholarship grants to 76 students in the first semester of AY 2019-2020 
 

8.35 CMO No. 29, s. 2009 provides that StuFAPs include Scholarship, Grant-in-
Aid and Student Loan Programs administered by CHED.  

 

8.36 The CSPs are intended for entering freshman students who are eligible for 
college whose General Weighted Average (GWA) is at least 90% or its 

equivalent, who must enroll in recognized priority programs in PHEIs or 

SUCs/LUCs with Certificate of Program Compliance (COPC). The availment 

of the type of scholarships is determined through ranking system and 

availability of slots. 

 

8.37 Moreover, Paragraph 2.6, Section 2, Article II of CMO No. 08 Series of 2019 
provides that “the financial assistance under CSPs is merit-based which can 

be availed by the students depending on the type of scholarship awarded, xxx. 

The financial assistance under the CSPs shall be harmonized with the 

monetary benefits under the UniFAST-TES, as well as with the free tuition and 

other school fees privilege provided in RA No. 10931 and its IRRs, xxx.” 

 

8.38 Lastly, Paragraph 2.7, Section 2, Article II of CMO No. 08 Series of 2019 
states that:  

 

"For purposes of this CMO, CHED hereby adopts a policy of non-
duplication of financial benefits under the CSPs. Thus, students 
enrolled in SUCs who are existing beneficiaries of CHED Expanded 
Student Grants-in-Aid Program for Poverty Alleviation are (ESG-
PPA) enjoying the free Tuition and Other School Fees(TOSF) 
privilege under RA 10931 and receiving yearly stipend under the 
TES, students enrolled in PHEIs in cities and municipalities with no 
existing SUCs/LUCs but receiving both tuition and stipend 
allowance, students considered as poor based on the National 
Household Targeting System or the Listahanan 2.0 who are either 
enrolled in PHEIs or SUCs/LUCs and receiving tuition the stipend 
benefits or recipients of free TOSF privilege with stipend 
respectively, students who are poor but not part of the Listahanan 
2.0 ranked according to estimated per capita household income 
based on submitted documentation of proof of income enrolled in 
PHEIs or SUCs/LUCs and also receiving tuition and stipend benefits 



179 

 

or recipients of free TOSF privilege with stipend, are no longer 
qualified under the CSPs.” 

 

8.39 Audit of payment of scholarship grants for TES and StuFAPs in CHEDRO III 
covering the first semester of AY 2019-2020 showed that 76 students received 

financial benefits both under two scholarship programs, as summarized below: 
 

Program 

No. of Students Who 

Received Double Grants 

Amount of Grant 

per Student 
Total Grants 

(In Php) 

TES Program – PNSL 7 30,000.00 210,000.00 

Half PESFA Program 7,500.00 52,500.00 

TES Program – PNSL 69 30,000.00 2,070,000.00 

CHED - TDP 7,500.00 517,500.00 

Total 76  2,850,000.00 

 

8.40 Verification with the personnel concerned of CHEDRO III revealed that the 
UniFAST Unit and the StuFAPs Unit each maintain separate databases and /or 

systems. Further inquiry showed that the existing database systems of the 

scholarship units on the processing of claims do not include a tool for cross 

matching or validation. Also, the database systems are not unified, rather, they 

are considered an individual database application. Since the database systems 

are not centralized, the processing of applications was done per program.  The 

absence of a verification tool to check either through the system or manually 

resulted in payment of more than one scholarship grant to student applicants. 

Apparently, the Accounting Unit, due to many DVs being processed, was also 

remiss in checking and monitoring the various claims that resulted in payment 

of double scholarship grants to students.  

 

8.41 While it acknowledges the fact that the scholarship guidelines on UniFAST is 
different from the StuFAP guidelines, it is to be highlighted, however, that 

both Units are under one CHEDRO with the same mandate, that is to make 

education accessible to all and to establish and maintain a system of 

scholarship which shall be available to deserving students in both public and 

private schools, especially to the underprivileged.  

 

8.42 The Audit Team also noticed that a huge number of accomplished application 
forms are being received by the CHEDRO III during scholarship application 

period. This means that many students want to have access to the scholarship 

program offered by the government. However, due to the absence of a reliable 

system of control or a centralized dependable database system that could detect 

duplicate names, the opportunity to avail of scholarship allotment for other 

deserving students becomes limited because some students were recipients of 

two scholarship benefits. 

 

8.43 In view of the foregoing and with the above number of double payments noted, 
it just clearly showed that the CHEDRO III failed to install adequate control 



180 

 

measures over the processing and payment of scholarship benefits. This failure 

resulted not only in the double payment of scholarship benefits of some 

students but also the missed opportunity of other equally deserving students to 

avail of government-funded scholarship programs.  
 

8.44 We recommended that the Management implement the following: 
 

a. strengthen and enhance the agency’s existing system on processing of 
scholarship claims so that adequate control measures are embedded 
in the system to detect and prevent deficiencies or errors such as 

double payment of scholarship grants; 
 

b. if possible, initiate appropriate action to make a centralized database 
system for all scholarship programs so that all applications are 

properly verified and correctly validated before payments; and 
 

c. require the immediate refund of overpayments for double/multiple/ 
excess payments made to students concerned.  

 
8.45 The Management of CHEDRO III commented that: 

 

a. The Office immediately instituted or commit to do the following: 
 

• additional control measures to detect double payments such as 
conducting manual cross-validation using both databases and creating 
inventory of unclaimed checks. 

 

• tapped the assistance of partner HEIs in ensuring one scholarship 
program awarded to their students. 

 

• create a centralized database system for all its scholarship and grants-
in-aid programs to ensure proper verification before payment. The 
strengthening of the ICT facilities which includes development of 
system, is included as one of the programs of Central Luzon Higher 
Education Action Plan. Initial steps have been undertaken to this effect. 
CHEDRO III will also purchase desktop units for storage allocated to 
the centralized database. 

 

b. As of September 30, 2020, refunds made by HEIs totaled ₱7,423,500.00 
(including double scholarships detected by CHEDRO III). 

 

c. In addition, the OIC-Director mentioned during the Exit Conference about 
engaging the services of an IT Consultant that will help design a system 
for the Agency to easily detect grantees with double scholarships as well 
as double payments. 

 

d. At present, CHEDRO III is cross-validating the UniFAST masterlist 
against the StuFAPs database and vice-versa to avoid incurring double 
payments. As an additional control measure, the Accounting keeps a 



181 

 

record, in Excel format, of all grantees paid already, and inventory of 
claims for payment.  

 

e. Additional courses of action: 
 

• Develop and maintain centralized, reliable, strong and integrated 
database; 

 

• While waiting for the integrated database, use Structured Query 
Language (SQL) of the MS Excel. The system will store and maintain 
a single file of all the grantees of CSP, TDP, TES and TDP-TES 
Programs; 

 

• Benchmark with other CHEDROs on the use of database system that 
detects duplication of payments; 

 

• Seek assistance from HEIs in screening applicants. 
 

f. The Management assured the Audit Team on their commitment to improve 
the Agency’s system in processing claims for scholarship to prevent future 
incurrence of double scholarship. 

 
8.46 Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

As of December 31, 2020, all double scholarships identified in this audit 
observation were fully settled. 

 
e. Unliquidated/Delayed liquidation of fund transfers totaling ₱3,819,897,154.17 

 

8.47 Audit disclosed that CHED-CO and CHEDROs NCR and I transferred funds 
to various SUCs/CHED-recognized LUCs/PHEIs for the implementation of 
TES totaling ₱8,200,292,400.00, but only ₱4,380,395,245.83 were liquidated 
as of December 31, 2020, leaving an unliquidated balance of 
₱3,819,897,154.17, as shown below:

8.48 Details are discussed as follows: 
 

Office/ 

CHEDRO 
Deficiencies 

CO Based on the report provided by the UniFAST, out of ₱6,489,350,200.00 
transferred to SUCs and CHED-recognized LUCs for AY 2018-2019, 
₱3,693,445,345.83 or 56.92% thereof has LRs submitted by the SUCs/LUCs 
to UniFAST, while the balance of ₱2,795,904,854.17 or 43.08% of the total 
fund transfer was not yet liquidated as of date. Out of ₱3,693,445,345.83 
liquidations, only ₱2,423,666,483.25 passed the initial pre-audit of UniFAST 
and forwarded to CHED-AFMS as early as August 2019. Meanwhile, the 
liquidations in the total amount of ₱1,269,778,862.58 still undergo further 
checking/and or assessment by the UniFAST due to either incomplete 
submission of supporting documents from SUCs/LUCs or reconsideration of 
disallowed amount from the assessed liquidation. 
 
Meanwhile, the status of submission of the LRs for the fund transfer for AY 
2019-2020 revealed that out of 212 SUCs/LUCs, only 27 or 12.74% submitted 
their LRs to UniFAST. However, the liquidation amount could not be 
ascertained yet since these are still subject to pre-audit by the UniFAST. 
 
As discussed in the previous year audit, the TES implementing guidelines 
(MC No. 2018-0001 dated March 26, 2018) for AY 2018-2019 did not include 
a penalty clause in case of failure to liquidate the transferred funds within the 
prescribed period, hence the laxity on the part of the SUCs/LUCs to liquidate 
the funds. 
 
Despite UniFAST’s diligent effort to follow up the immediate submission of 
the LRs from the SUCs/LUCs (thru e-mail), the SUCs/LUCs still failed to 
comply with the liquidation requirements. 

NCR Based on the status report submitted, only the total amount of 
₱307,393,100.00 is with JEVs and was recorded as liquidated by the 
Accountant, leaving a huge unliquidated TES fund transfers totaling 
₱186,574,200.00. Among the unrecorded fund transfers are from 45 PHEIs 
with submitted FURs but with deficient supporting documents attached that 
are awaiting for resubmission totaling ₱181,599,300.00 and from 11 PHEIs 
with no or partially submitted FURs totaling ₱4,974,900.00, in violation of 
the provisions of the MOA and UniFAST MC No. 2019-01 dated March 5, 
2019. 
 
The LRs of PHEIs with deficient supporting documents, which are waiting 
for resubmission, could not be forwarded by CHED UniFAST Regional 
Coordinator to the Accounting Unit, hence evaluation of the said LRs and 
their recording could not be made by the Accountant.  
 
The CHEDRO NCR and the UniFAST Regional Coordinators had failed to 
strictly enforce the deadline for submission of LRs and to include sanction in 
the guidelines and in the MOA in case of late or non-submission of the LRs, 
to avoid or lessen the huge amount of unliquidated TES fund transfers. 

I A total of 173 HEIs have not yet submitted their FURs as of December 31, 

2020, which is not in conformity with the guidelines requiring submission of 

FURs within 30 days upon receipt of fund transfer. 



183 

 

8.49 We recommended that the Management: 
 

a. demand immediate submission of LRs from SUCs/LUCs/PHEIs 
supported with the required documents to ensure propriety of 

disbursements; 
 

b. revisit MC No. 2018-0001 dated March 26, 2018 to include a penalty 
clause in case of non-compliance by SUCs/LUCs/PHEIs with the 

liquidation requirements; and 
 

c. strengthen the monitoring mechanism by the Regional Coordinators 
of TES fund transfers to enable the PHEIs to immediately address the 

issues causing the delay in the submission of LRs to CHEDRO I. 
 

8.50 Management commented, thus: 
 

CHEDRO Comments 

NCR HEIs with overdue liquidations were being sent demand letters reprimanding 
them to adhere to the stipulated deadline. 
 

The existing guidelines of UniFAST do not have sanctions, hence the 

Regional Coordinators can neither implement nor impose sanctions to non-

compliant HEIs. The matter, however, will be raised to the UNIFAST 

Governing Board for perusal and policy inclusion. 

I There were HEIs which already submitted their LRs and the same are for 
submission to the Audit Team. Total amount liquidated are as follows:   
 

First Semester (14 HEIs) ₱25,370,200.00                                                       
Second Semester (15 HEIs 29,911,200.00 

Total ₱55,281,400.00 

  
HEIs which also submitted their LRs and under review by the said Office are 
as follows:    
 

First Semester (24 HEIs): ₱234,228,000.00                                                 
Second Semester (21 HEIs) 160,591,600.00 

Total ₱394,819,600.00 

 
The CHEDRO I has sent follow-up letters to HEIs on January 26, 2021, 
requesting them to submit already their LRs and refund all undisbursed 
amounts. 

 

f. Significant amount of refunds from SUCs totaling ₱202,038,053.95 

 

8.51 Based on records, the Audit Team in CHED-CO observed that there are 
significant refunds made by 20 SUCs in the total amount of ₱202,038,053.95. 

The refunds were primarily due to unutilized/excess TES and administrative 

cost, as well as refunds on account of duplicate entries in the name of 

beneficiaries. On the other hand, considering that the beneficiaries were 



184 

 

already identified and included in the Masterlist of TES Beneficiaries under 

Listahanan 2.0 prior to the transfer of funds to SUCs, the huge amount of 

refunds indicates that some students were not able to avail of the TES Program. 

On the other hand, the duplicate entries in the Masterlist of Listahanan 2.0, 

which was the basis of the amount to be transferred to a SUC/LUC, denotes 

double funding of grants and administrative costs, hence, resulting in excessive 

amount of fund transfers to SUCs/LUCs. Details are shown below:

8.52 We recommended that the Management require the UniFAST Secretariat 
to provide justification/reason on why there is a huge amount of refunds 

made by the SUCs. 
 

g. Lapses in monitoring submission of LRs by PHEIs 
 

8.53 The Audit Team of CHEDRO NCR noted some lapses of the UniFAST 
Regional Coordinator  in monitoring the liquidation of PHEIs such as:                           

a) failure to monitor and record the receiving date of the submitted LRs; and 

b) failure to prepare a transmittal letter or use a logbook to record the name of 

the person who received and the date when the LRs was forwarded to the 



185 

 

Accounting Unit for evaluation and recording, which made it difficult to 

determine the timeliness of its submission, who among the responsible parties 

that causes the delay/s in the liquidation process and to identify who will be 

accountable and responsible  over the documents. 

 

8.54 According to the UniFAST Regional Coordinators, they have sent follow-up 
letters through the PHEIs’ emails and the CHEDRO NCR had issued 

Memorandum No. 22 s. 2019 dated June 19, 2019, requiring the immediate 

submission of LRs on June 30, 2019. They also conducted series of orientation 

to clarify with the PHEIs the required and appropriate documents which should 

be attached in the LRs. They also admitted the lapses noted by the Audit Team 

and committed to continually improve their monitoring process. 

 

8.55 We recommended that the Management instruct the UniFAST Regional 
Coordinator to: 

 

a. prepare the checklist of the documents received from the PHEIs and 
prepare a transmittal letter upon transmitting these documents to the 

Accounting Unit or to other offices; and 
 

b. monitor the date of submission of LRs by the PHEIs and require them 
to strictly observe deadlines/timelines as provided in the guidelines. 

 

8.56 Management commented that forwarding of documents is now properly 
tendered with transmittal letters. 

 

h. Incomplete and inappropriate documents supporting TES liquidation totaling 
₱124,341,600.00 

 

8.57 Post-audit of the LRs and their attached supporting documents submitted by 
the PHEIs to liquidate TES grants totaling ₱124,341,600.00, which was 

recorded by the Accounting Unit and forwarded to the Audit Team of the 

CHEDRO NCR revealed that there were noted deficiencies, and lacking 

documents in the liquidation of TES 1 and 2 as well as the utilization of 3% 

administrative support costs (ASCs). Details are summarized as follows: 
 

a. Some of the FURs attached to LRs: 
            - were not properly signed by the authorized signatories; 

- had no attached copies of school IDs, Certificate of Registrations 

(CORs), Certificate of Indigency/Barangay Clearance, and notarized 

TES Sharing Agreement; 

b. No attached proof/payroll that shows refund of excess TES1 to students;   
c. Some of the attached copies of school IDs did not contain specimen 

signature that causes difficulty in verifying/validating signatures of the 

students in the payroll; 

d. Some of the signatures in school IDs and TES Sharing Agreement did not 
match with the signatures of the students in the payroll;  



186 

 

e. Some of the LRs had no attached RCI to support administrative costs; 
f. Some of the attached RCIs lacks supporting ORs; 
g. Some of the PHEIs charged expenses/purchases to ASC which were not 

among the allowable expenses per Section 4 of UniFAST MC No. 2019-

001 s 2019; and 

h. Some of the ORs attached to support the liquidation of administrative costs 
were incomplete, photocopy only and with deficiencies. 

 

8.58 The above noted deficiencies and lacking documents were contrary to Section 
4(6) of PD No. 1445 and UniFAST MC No. 2019-001 s. 2019, casting doubt 

on the validity and accuracy of the TES granted as well as the proper utilization 

of the government funds. 

 

8.59 Likewise, prompt recording of liquidation and submission of TES LRs to the 
Audit Team were not observed by the Accountant, contrary to Paragraphs 6.05 

of COA Circular No. 95-006 dated May 18, 1995, thus precluded the Audit 

Team the immediate conduct of post-audit.  

 

8.60 The Accountant explained that he had difficulty in evaluating the completeness 
and validity of the documents attached in the LRs since the PHEIs are not 

familiar with the documents used in liquidating government funds. He also 

reasoned out that the guidelines issued did not specify the required documents 

needed to liquidate the 3% ASC. 

 

8.61 We recommended that the Management: 
 

a. instruct the UniFAST Coordinator to: 
 

• strictly enforce compliance by the PHEIs regarding submission of 
the documentary requirements and ensure complete 

documentation in accordance with PD No. 1445 and UniFAST MC 

No. 2019-001 s. 2019; 
 

• inform/orient the PHEIs of the allowed documentary requirements 
to support utilization of the 3% ASCs; 

 

b. revisit the MC No. 2019-001 s. 2019 and formulate appropriate 
internal control measures in the disbursements of 3% ASC; and 

 

c. instruct the Accountant to promptly record the liquidation of the 
PHEIs and submit the LRs to the Office of the Auditor within 10 days 

from the date of receipt of LRs as required under Paragraphs 6.05 of 

COA Circular No. 95-006 dated May 18, 1995. 

 

 

 

 



187 

 

8.62 The Management of CHEDRO NCR commented the following: 
 

a. A close monitoring of HEIs compliance is being done. However, TES 
grantees with lacking documents were indeterminate, hence the request for 

the Audit Team to furnish a breakdown of those. 
 

b. Series of orientation on how to substantiate the use of ASC were being 
conducted in 2019 before the disbursement of funds.  The Office will be 

holding another one once the guidelines relative to COA Circular No. 

2012-001 have been ironed out. In the interim, HEIs are directed to furnish 

the original copies of Receipts/Invoices pertaining to ASC. 
 

c. Documents received were initially checked upon submission from HEIs. 
 

d. The Management also seek for clarificatory guidelines from COA with 
regard to the utilization of ASC anent to COA Circular No. 2012-001 and 

let it take effect prospectively since TES Grants were disbursed in 2019.  

Requiring other supporting documents aside from the ASC related receipts 

and invoices will be cumbersome for the HEIs to produce additional 

documents given that the two-year time had passed. This will only cause 

the delay of their LRs and to the disadvantage of the students. 
 

e. Ten days is too short a time to assiduously review supporting documents 
dealing with thousands of grantees, given the lack of manpower to attend 

to such voluminous charge. Hence, it is requested that the Office is given 

a more attainable time frame in the recording and forwarding of LRs. 

 

 

Drawbacks in the implementation of CHED Scholarship Programs  

 

9. The implementation of CHED StuFAPs and the TDP in CHEDROs encountered 
some drawbacks, as follows: a) non-compliance with the application, selection 

criteria and ranking procedures as basis in the awarding of Notice of Award 

(NOA) to student-applicants in CHEDRO II, while some students in CHEDRO 

X were paid scholarship benefits with lower academic units enrolled and/or with 

lower grades than the prescribed requirements; b) payment of financial benefits 

amounting to ₱1,668,000.00 of CHEDRO X were not supported with Billing 

Statements by the HEIs for the second semester of the AY; and c) double 

payments of financial benefits to 16 student-scholars  and seven HEIs on 

CHEDROs IV-B, VIII and XI, contrary to CHED-DBM Joint Memorandum 

Circular (JMC) No. 04, Series of 2019 and CMO No. 10, s. 2019,  thus depriving 

the qualified and deserving student-scholars/grantees of the financial assistance 

they need to pursue their education. 

 

9.1 The CHED was mandated under RA No. 7722 to provide financial assistance 
through scholarships to qualified and deserving students. Among the 

scholarship programs offered by the CHED were the CSPs and CHED-TDP. 



188 

 

9.2 Audit of the implementation of StuFAPs disclosed deficiencies which affect 
the efficient implementation of the program, the details of which are discussed 

at length in the succeeding paragraphs. 

 
a. Non-compliance with the scholarship guidelines 

 

9.3 CMO No. 10, s. of 2019, amending Section 6 of CMO No. 8, provides that a 
qualified student may be awarded Full Scholarship or Partial Scholarship 

under the Private Education Student Financial Assistance (PESFA). The CSPs 

are intended for entering freshman students who are eligible for college whose 

GWA is at least 85% or its equivalent, provided that qualified students must 

enroll in recognized priority programs in PHEIs or SUCs or accredited LUCs.    
 

9.4 Section 7 of CHED-DBM JMC No. 04 s. 2019 dated September 13, 2019 states 
that: 
 

• Student-applicant submits the accomplished CHED-TDP Application 
Form directly to the concerned CHEDRO where they graduated in high 
school, together with the required documents, in accordance with the mode 
prescribed by the CHEDRO concerned based on the prescribed timelines 
in Section 14.1 (Sec. 7.1.1);  

 

• CHEDRO evaluates the documents, prepares ranklist of qualified 
applicants and masterlist of grantees (Sec. 7.1.2); 

 

• CHEDRO sends the individual Notice of Award (NOA) to the applicant or 
notifies the list of awardees through the HEIs (Sec.7.1.3); and 

 

• Applicant accepts the NOA (Sec. 7.1.4) 
 

9.5 Section 8 thereof enumerates the obligations to be complied with by the 
grantees, among others: 

 
8.3 Maintain a General Weighted Average (GWA) of at least a 

passing grade regardless of the status of grades per subject. 

 
8.4 Carry a regular load per term, as determined and approved by 

the HEIs.  

 
9.6 The deviations from the implementing guidelines of Scholarship Programs and 

the TDP were noted in CHEDROs II and X, as follows: 
 

CHEDRO Audit Observations 

II Only the CHED Masterlist of TDP Grantees and Masterlist from the Offices 
of the Congressional Districts for AY 2019-2020 were submitted to the Audit 

Team by StuFAPs Division and no CHED-TDP Ranklist was furnished. 

Interview conducted with the CHED-TDP Program Coordinator revealed that 



189 

 

CHEDRO Audit Observations 

a ranklist is prepared for walk-in applicants only and no ranklist is prepared 

for the applicants/recommendees of the different Offices of Congressional 

Districts.   
 

Comparison of the two Masterlists submitted disclosed that the students 

identified in the Masterlist from the Offices of the Congressional Districts 

were the same grantees which are identified in the CHED Masterlist of TDP 

Grantees that have subsequently been issued with NOA. Apparently, the 

CHEDRO no longer ranks the applicants of the different Offices of 

Congressional Districts as required under Section 7 of JMC No. 04 s. 2019, 

but rather issue the NOAs based only on the list prepared by the Congressional 

Districts instead of the Ranklist of student-grantees that should have been 

prepared by CHED.  
 

It was further explained by the CHED-TDP Coordinator that it has been the 

practice of the Offices of the Congressional Districts to send a list of their 

recommendees and for the CHEDRO to issue NOA to the recommendees 

based on the list without undergoing the required criteria and ranking 

procedures, as long as the number of recommended students do not exceed the 

allotted slots for their respective districts. Based on CHED records, only the 

minimum requirements stipulated in the guidelines under CHED-DBM JMC 

No. 04, s. 2019 were being complied and submitted such as High School 

Report Card, Certified True Copy of grades, ALS Accreditation and 

Equivalency Certificate and PEPT Certificate to support the academic 

requirements as well as the latest Income Tax Return, Certificate of Tax 

Exemption, and copy of contract or proof of income to support the income 

requirements.   
 

Because of this practice, it is evident that the Offices of the Congressional 

Districts, in effect, have the full discretion in the selection and determination 

of the grantees, thus depriving other aspiring applicants such as walk-in 

students or those applying thru online mode, especially those who are 

underprivileged but deserving applicants the equal opportunity to be selected 

and benefited with the program. 
X Scholarship benefits under PESFA totaling ₱87,000.00 were paid to:  

 

• five student-scholars having low grade in the 1st semester of AY 2019-2020 
- ₱60,000.00. 

• one student-scholar with GWA lower than 85% - ₱15,000.00. 

• one student-scholar that exceed the normal years in College for a particular 
academic course, contrary to the provisions of CHED CMO. No. 10, s. 

2019 - ₱12,000.00. 

 
Moreover, payments of financial benefits of ₱157,500.00 to 25 scholars/ 

student-grantees under CHED-TDP lacked the required units enrolled, and 

₱24,000.00 to one student with no grade during the 1st semester of AY 2019-

2020, or a total of ₱181,500.00 inconsistent with CHED-DBM JMC No. 04 s. 

of 2019. 



190 

 

CHEDRO Audit Observations 

Furthermore, billing statements attached to 29 DVs with a total amount of 

₱1,668,000.00 were for the 1st semester of the school year only but paid in full 

for the whole AY which includes the 2nd semester. 

 

9.7 We recommended that the Management: 
 

CHEDRO II  

 

a. undergo strict ranking and selection criteria procedure on the 
recommendees of the Offices of the Congressional Districts pursuant 

to the provisions of JMC No. 04, s. 2019 to ensure that the students 

really deserved and qualified as grantees of the CHED-TDP; 

 

b. conduct information dissemination of the program so that all 
interested students can apply and also to consider/include those walk-

in applicants or those applying thru online mode especially those who 

are underprivileged and deserving students to be ranked and 

evaluated to ensure fairness and equal opportunity to all;  

 

CHEDRO X 

 

c. stop giving financial benefits to the students with lacking enrolled 
academic units; 

 

d. submit a list of HEIs with corresponding regular load per term and 
the list of HEIs with corresponding GWA of students to qualify for 

TDP or other scholarship programs of CHED, as a reference in audit; 

 

e. require the HEIs to: i) submit tertiary grading scale, copy furnished 
the Audit Team; ii) add “remarks column” in the certified list of 

scholars whether or not a student is graduating to justify lower units 

enrolled and require a Certification from HEIs for graduating 

students; iii) attach complete Billing Statements for the semester(s) 

payments were made/intended for; and 
 

f. strictly observe the guidelines set in the utilization of TDP and PESFA 
under JMC No. 04 s. of 2019 and CMO Nos. 8 and 10, s. of 2019, 

respectively. 

 

9.8 Management commented that:

conducts a vetting on the application to ensure the 

minimum requirements and criteria are complied with 

by the student-applicants. 
 
The Audit Team was further informed that the 

Management conducts an annual extensive Career 

Development Program for High School Grade 12 

students throughout the region in partnership with 

DepEd Region 2. This includes orientation program on 

the different CHED StuFAPs through radio programs, 

distribution of leaflets and application forms (through 

DepEd Division Offices), and posting of 

announcement on Facebook and other social media 

platforms.

X Processed and paid the school equivalent to one AY 

upon submission of the billing for the 1st semester of 

the said AY per Section 7.2 (Transfer the equivalent 

funds to the qualified student or identified HEI where 

the beneficiaries are enrolled for one AY or on an 

annual basis) of CMO No. 44, S. 2016: Amending the 

Pertinent Provisions of Section 7. Mode of Payment in 

CMO No. 13 and 16 s. 2014, the “Revised Guidelines 

for the Implementation of StuFAPs Effective AY 

2014-2015,” and Section B.2 of the MOA between 

CHEDRO X and the school. However, the school shall 

submit LRs to show that the student is enrolled during 

the second semester and received the financial 

assistance for the AY. 

 
The student beneficiaries were paid, even if their 

general GWA and enrolled units is below the required 

GWA and units, provided that their letter-request for 

consideration is approved by the Director IV. The 

Office will follow the COA recommendation and will 

conduct a virtual meeting with the schools’ StuFAPs 

coordinators on the 1st quarter of 2021 to present and 

discuss the COA findings and recommendations. 

 
Management agreed during the Exit Conference to 

submit second semester billing statements from HEIs 

considering the delayed submission of vouchers, they 

have ample time to attach the billing statements to the 

DVs. Hence, they committed to submit the second 

semester billing statements from HEIs. 

The Audit Team 

likewise requested that 

HEIs should provide 

the percentage 

equivalent to their 

grading system which 

should be attached to 

their billing statement 

submitted to CHED. 

We also requested that 

the Management 

should furnish the 

COA Office a copy of 

the updated guidelines 

of the CSP. The 

Management further 

agreed to the 

recommendation that 

HEIs need to add a 

“remarks column” in 

the certified list of 

scholars specifying 

what year level they 

belong. 



192 

 

b. Incurrence of double payments to student-grantees - ₱2,008,500.00   

 

9.9 Based on Sections 123 and 124 of PD No. 1445, it shall be the direct 
responsibility of the agency head to install, implement, and monitor a sound 

system of internal control to check the accuracy and reliability of its 

accounting data, and encourage adherence to prescribed managerial policies. 
 

9.10 Disbursements for financial benefits of scholars/grantees in CHEDROs IV-B, 
VIII and XI disclosed excessive payments to students-beneficiaries totaling 

₱2,008,500.00 due to double payment or availment of more than one 

scholarship grant. Details are as follows:

TDP 6 HEIs 1,831,500.00 
Total 2,008,500.00 

 

9.11 The double payment could have been prevented had the controls been 
established and strictly observed by the Agency personnel. Effective internal 

control mechanisms should be strictly implemented to ensure that no double 

payments to same students/HEIs will take place. Moreover, the double 

payments made, if not settled and recovered, is disadvantageous to the 

government. As such, the related DVs on double claims shall be suspended in 

audit and personnel involved shall be responsible in its settlement.  

 

9.12 We recommended that the Management: 
 

a. revisit/review the existing profiles of grantees to check any double or 
multiple awarding of scholarships and terminate other grants 

inconsistent with the guidelines; 

 

b. design internal control procedures and mechanism in the processing 
of StuFAPs claims to prevent incurrence of double payment of bills 

from HEIs/students; 

 

c. require the maintenance of subsidiary ledgers not only in the 
Accounting Office but also in the Scholarship Unit for reconciliation 

purposes; 

 



193 

 

d. inform the HEIs of the double payments made and the corresponding 
solution on how to resolve the overpayment; and 

 

e. cause the immediate refund of excessive/double payments to scholars 
and terminate duplicate scholarship grants availed. 

 

9.13 Management commented, thus: 
 

CHEDRO Comments 

VIII StuFAP Unit is currently updating its database to avoid double or multiple 

payment/award. 

XI The Management had created an Accounting Core Team led by the Office of 

the Chief Administrative Officer to establish strong internal controls to the 

procedures consistent with general accounting procedures and maintenance of 

the Regional Book of Accounts. Likewise, the Management issued an Office 

Memorandum ordering all employees concerned, reminding them of their 

adherence to the standard disbursement procedures as required by law. 
 

An automated system to arrest double payment and duplicate names, and a 

more efficient validation system of submitted grantees/scholars against the 

Enrollment List and Promotional Report (EL/PR), was implemented effective 

January 2021. As such, various virtual orientations were conducted for the  

Registrars of HEIs in the Region on the issuance of RM No. 003 s. 2021 which 

sets forth the deadline for submission of EL/PR to the Online Portal on March 

30, 2021. 

 

Sent stern warnings to identified HEIs with inadvertent overpayments per 

communications released on March 5, 2021. The same letter required them to 

return or refund the amounts two days upon receipt of the letter. 
 

Currently, the Office already has its way or system of detecting overpayments. 

As a matter of fact, one of the SUCs has been notified and returned the 

identified overpayment. Copies of the Management's letters to the HEIs with 

inadvertent double payments are available for review to prove compliance 

with the recommendations. 

 

The Management directed both the Scholarship Coordinator and the 

Accountant to submit a written explanation/justification on why no 

disciplinary measure shall be meted against them for inefficiency in the 

performance of official duties and strict compliance with the guidelines of the 

scholarship grant or financial assistance programs are demanded through 

issuance of an Office Memorandum order. Moreover, copies of DVs with 

appropriate and required supporting documents were presented to the Audit 

Team. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

The Audit Team shall validate compliance with the recommendations. 



194 

 

Lapses in the implementation of CHED Loan Programs 
 

10. The weak loan monitoring and collection/repayment mechanism  on the 
implementation of the Study Now, Pay Later Plan (SNPLP) and HEI-Based Loan 

Programs resulted in: a) low collection rate of only 0.85% or ₱444,336.07 out of 

the total amount due and demandable SNPLP Loans of ₱52,541,000.84 in 

CHEDROs VII and VIII; b) low turnover of repayments on HEI-Based Loan 

Programs ranging from 9% to 26% in 78 participating HEIs in CHEDRO V; and 

c) non-submission of the required semestral reports and utilization reports for the 

transferred funds of ₱80,631,967.56 to 64 participating HEIs for the SAFE Loan 

Program in CHEDROs V and VIII, contrary to CMO No. 25, s. of 2008.  

 

Moreover, the Student Loan Program for Tertiary Education – Short-term Basis 

(SLPTE-ST), one of the component programs under UAQTE, with a budget 

allocation of ₱1,000,000,000.00 encountered an implementation setback in view of 

the deficiency in the MOA with the DBP wherein it covers only the disbursement 

of funds to student-beneficiaries but has no provision on loan repayment facilities 

and mechanism as required  in UniFAST Memorandum Circular No. 2018-003, 

hence no beneficiaries were able to avail of the loan program, and as a 

consequence, the fund remained unutilized since its inception in CY 2018. 

 

10.1 Sections 1 and 2, Article XIV of the Philippine Constitution mandates the State 
to protect and promote the right of all citizens to quality education at all levels 

and take appropriate steps to make such education accessible to all and to 

establish and maintain a system of scholarship grants, student loan program, 

subsidies and other incentives which shall be available to deserving student in 

both public and private schools, specifically to the underprivileged. 

 

10.2 In keeping with the said mandates, the CHED implements programs to provide 
educational assistance to financially disadvantaged students and student loan 

programs, among which are the SNPLP and Institution-Based Loan Programs. 

The deficiencies observed in the monitoring of these programs are discussed 

thoroughly in the succeeding paragraphs. 

 

a. Low collection rate on SNPLP Loans 
 

10.3 Section 10 of RA No. 8545 dated February 24, 1998, on Education Loan Fund-
SNPLP, provides that: a) the Students’ Loan Fund shall be used to finance 

educational loans to cover matriculation and other school fees and educational 

expenses for book subsistence, and board and lodging; b) amounts covering 

payments for tuition and other school fees shall be paid directly to the school 

concerned; and c) any loan granted under this section shall be paid by the 

student-debtor after he has finished the course or profession for which the 

proceeds of the loan was expended, but only after a period of two years from 

the time he has acquired an employment: Provided, however, That interest at 

the rate of not more than six percent per annum shall accrue on the balance 

thereof. 



195 

 

10.4 One of the specific functions of the CHEDROs, which is primarily 
administered by the Scholarship Unit (SU), is to implement and monitor 

scholarship, study grants and StuFAPs programs and other relevant student 

auxiliary services. It is the responsibility of the SU to monitor the repayment 

of graduates who were recipients of SNPLP. The Accounting Unit, on the other 

hand, is responsible for maintaining basic accounting records and books of 

accounts. 

 

10.5 Audit of SNPLP loans receivable in two CHEDROs disclosed low collection 
of only ₱444,336.07 or 0.85% of the due and demandable balance of Loans 

Receivable amounting to ₱52,541,000.84, as shown below:

SNPLP from the SU is for the 

month of February 2020. Per 

inquiry with the staff from the 

SU, demand letters were 

released for Batch 2001-2008 

and Batch 2010-2012 during CY 

2020. However, only few 

responded to the letters and paid 

their outstanding balances. 
VIII 39,109,943.54 304,248.57 0.78% The very low collection rate was 

due to non-enforcement of some 

loan provisions and 

responsibilities by CHEDRO 

and the HEIs, such as: a) not 

indicating the necessary 

information about the student 

borrowers and their co-

borrowers, thus making it 

difficult to trace their 

whereabouts as some have 

already changed status/address; 

and b) did not establish an 

effective monitoring system and 

did not coordinate, on a regular 

basis, with the HEIs or schools 

where the student-borrowers 

availed of the loans, thus it was 

difficult to determine the status 

of graduation and employment 

of students. 

Total 52,541,000.84 444,336.07 0.85%  

 



196 

 

10.6 We recommended that the Management: 
 

a. intensify the collection of due and demandable loans by coordinating 
with appropriate government agencies such as the Social Security 

System, Government Service Insurance System, Bureau of Internal 

Revenue and National Bureau of Investigation, to request assistance 

in obtaining information on the whereabouts of the student-borrowers 

and their guarantors for the sending of demand letters and written 

follow-ups to them; 
 

b. require the designated focal person to prepare and submit for audit a 
monitoring report on loans receivable pertaining to SNPLP; and 

 

c. if all the demand letters and written follow-ups/tracers proved to be 
futile, resort to filing of appropriate charges against the defaulting 

borrowers. 
 

10.7 Management of CHEDRO VIII commented that it will exert exhaustive effort 
in the collection of these receivables. 

 
b. Low Turnover of Repayments on HEI-Based Loan Programs  

 

10.8 The CHED, in its desire to help deserving but financially disadvantaged 
students, had appropriated and transferred funds to duly accredited Center of 
Excellence HEIs as loan funds. These funds, which will be treated as revolving 
funds, shall be loaned out to qualified students. 
 

10.9 To ensure that the programs are properly administered and implemented, 
CHEDROs are required to conduct regular monitoring and evaluation of its 
effectiveness. Assessment and evaluation of the performance of participating 
HEIs are also required to be undertaken to ensure the attainment of the goals 
to provide quality, relevant, responsive and accessible education for the youth.  
 

10.10 Analysis of the latest submitted status report on the implementation of HEI-
Based Loan Programs of 78 participating HEIs in CHEDRO V with entrusted 
funds of ₱91,584,483.36 and total repayments of ₱15,414,420.07 revealed low 
turnover of repayments ranging from 9% to 26% on Student Loan Fund for 
Region V (SLF-RV), Student Loan Program for Centers of Excellence (SLP-
COE), President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo Higher Education Loan Program 
(PGMA-HELP), Student Assistance Fund for Education for a Strong Republic

10.11 Since it has been about 12 to 20 years of implementation of the subject loan 
programs, and considering that the repayment terms of the same were not 

effectively monitored and imposed by 78 participating HEIs, these HEIs were 

likewise unable to expand the number of program beneficiaries, to the 

disadvantage of the financially deprived students. 

 

10.12 In addition, with the enactment of RA No. 10931 or the Universal Access to 
Quality Tertiary Education Act of 2017, which likewise includes a provision 

on Student Loan Program for Tertiary Education, maintaining the HEI-based 

loans programs as discussed above only replicates the student loan programs 

under RA No. 10931. 

 

10.13 We recommended that the Management: 
 

a. carefully assess and evaluate the performance of the participating 
HEIs to determine the extent of their compliance with the MOA and 

pertinent CHED guidelines; and 
 

b. require all non-compliant HEIs to refund the unutilized balance of 
revolving funds entrusted to them for possible re-appropriation to 

UniFAST programs pursuant to RA No. 10931. 

 

c. Non-compliance with the reporting requirements of HEI-Based Loan Programs 
 

10.14 CMO No. 25 s. 2008 provides the guidelines for the SAFE Loan which shall 
cater to financially needy students who are in their 3rd, 4th, 5th or graduating 

year of study. Qualified loan grantees can borrow as much as ₱8,000.00, 

depending on individual circumstances and requirements, payable within two 

to five years after graduation. It provides, among others, that CHED shall 

perform the following: 

 

1. Monitor, assess and evaluate the performance of the participating HEIs in 
accordance with the set criteria; and 

 

2. Maintain an active file of the documents submitted by the participating HEIs 
for ease and monitoring purposes.  



198 

 

10.15 Documents to be submitted to the CHEDRO by the participating HEIs per item 
B under the Administration of SAFE Loan as provided in CMO No. 25 are as 

follows: 
 

- List of grantees per semester; and 
- Status of SAFE Loan Program Implementation per Semester 

 

10.16 Review of the submitted report on the implementation of Institution-Based 
Loan Programs revealed 64 HEIs with total loan funds of ₱80,631,967.56 did 

not submit the required semestral reports which resulted in the non-

monitoring/evaluation of the SAFE Loan Program in CHEDROs V and VIII, 

as follows: 
 

CHEDRO Deficiencies 
Amount 
(In Php) 

V Out of 87 participating HEIs, 53 HEIs, or 61% with total 
loan funds of ₱40,741,215.06 were unable to submit their 

respective status reports covering CY 2019. Likewise, out 

of 53 non-compliant HEIs, 46 HEIs or 87% thereof were 

still granted with additional funds intended for TES, CSPs, 

and other CHED programs in CYs 2019 to 2020 despite 

non-submission of updated status reports on student loan 

funds earlier received. 

40,741,215.06 

VIII Based on available records, 11 HEIs with transferred funds 
of ₱39,890,752.50, treated as revolving fund and is subject 

to monitoring and evaluation per provisions of CMO No. 

25 failed to comply with the submission of status of fund 

utilization on a semestral basis. The last monitoring of 

utilization of funds transferred was in CY 2018. 

 
No other monitoring records for CYs 2019 and 2020, thus 

the proper implementation and effectiveness of the program 

could not be determined. 

39,890,752.50 

Total 80,631,967.56 
 

10.17 We recommended that Management: 
 

a. require the participating HEIs to submit an updated status report of 
loan program implementation and ensure that additional funds are 

granted to HEIs only upon their submission of such updated status 

report and unexpended balance, if any, is refunded to CHED, in case 

the granting of loans to student-borrowers has been discontinued; and 
 

b. prepare an updated monitoring report and active file of the submitted 
documents by the HEIs for ease of reference and monitoring.

CHEDRO Comments 

V An updated Status Report of the Fund Utilization by the concerned HEIs on 
the HEI-Based Loan Programs shall be forwarded to the Audit Team. 

Moreover, the non-submission of the LRs by the concerned HEIs was 

primarily due to the fact that the student-grantees were not physically present, 

hence they could not readily affix their signatures on the payroll template 

which was one of the attachments as proof of liquidation. Nevertheless, the 

“No Liquidation, No Release” policy shall be strictly observed and no 

additional releases for AY 2021-2022 shall be effected, unless the fund 

transfer for the previous academic years have been liquidated. 
VIII The StuFAP Unit will exert extra effort to enforce the submission of the 

required documents. 

 

d. Setback in the implementation of Student Loan Program under UAQTE 
 

10.19 Section 8 of RA No. 10931 or Universal Access to Quality Tertiary Education 
Act established the SLP to support further the cost of tertiary education or any 

part or portion thereof. Specifically, the SLP is to be availed by all Filipino 

students who shall enroll in SUCs, LUCs, PHEIs and Technical-Vocational 

Education and Training (TVET) program in all Technical Vocational 

Institutions (TVIs) registered under the Technical Education and Skills 

Development Authority (TESDA). The Program shall be administered by the 

UniFAST Board and the amount necessary to fund the program shall be 

included in the budgets of the CHED and the TESDA. 

 

10.20 Section 31, Rule V of the IRR of RA No. 10931 provides that: 
 

“The UniFAST Board shall administer/implement the SLP through partner 

banks and similar entities/institutions. The UniFAST Board shall develop 

the criteria, procedures, and determine institutions among the HEIs, TVIs, 

and banks as partners in implementing the SLP.” 

 

10.21 On October 15, 2018, the UniFAST issued MC No. 2018-0003 to provide 
guidelines on the implementation for SLPTE-ST. The relevant provisions of 

the said MC are quoted as follows: 
 

“RULE 1 GENERAL PROVISIONS

2.20 FUND MANAGEMENT ARRANGEMENT 
 

The UniFAST Board, after due diligence as to the absorptive capacity and 

existing information and communication technology (ICT) system in place, 

enter into a MOA with a Government Financial Institution (GFI), 

determined by the Board to have the full potential, resources and track 

record to undertake such a program. The GFI will be tasked with and made 

fully responsible and accountable for the proper and efficient management 

of the managing the funds to be transferred by the CHED specifically in the 

following areas: 

 

1) Transfer of loanable funds to SLPTE-ST student beneficiaries and/or 
SUC/CHED-recognized LUC/private HEI/state-run TVI/private TVI 

with approved loan availment application 

 

2) Received repayments made by SLPTE-ST student beneficiaries or 
identified guarantors of the SLPTE-ST student beneficiaries 

 

3) Suggest investment options while the funds, whether in full or part 
thereof, are not yet released for student loan purposes including 

accumulated repayments prior to the end of the semester and 

 

4) Monitoring of student loans on a per institutional basis (the 
SUC/CHED-recognized LUC/private HEI/state-run TVI where the 

SLPTE-ST student beneficiaries are enrolled at the time of loan 

availment). Reports on Fund Management and Account Movements 

will be provided to the UniFAST Board through the UniFAST 

Secretariat on a monthly basis.” 

 

10.22 Additionally, Section 2 of Department Circular No. 01-2017 dated May 11, 
2017, amending Section 5.3 of Department Circular No. 01-2015 dated June 

1, 2015, issued by the Department of Finance states that: 

 
“5.3.2 All interest income earned by deposits of NGAs/GOCCs shall be 

remitted quarterly to the National Treasury, unless expressly 



201 

 

provided by law that interest earnings of the account shall accrue to 

the fund for which the account was opened or maintained.” 

10.23 In CY 2018, a total of ₱1,000,000,000.00 was allocated for the implementation 
of the SLP. However, the amount was not obligated and disbursed in the same 

year because the MOA with DBP was not yet executed in that year, thus the 

unobligated allotment was carried forward as continuing appropriation in CY 

2019. 

 

10.24 The MOA between the UniFAST and DBP was finally signed on April 17, 
2019. By virtue of the MOA, the DBP will allow UniFAST to avail its Cash 

Management Solution services and all its related modules/functions, subject to 

DBP’s guidelines and policies, for more efficient implementation of the 

Agency’s disbursement requirements. The payment scheme shall be known as 

the Direct Remittance Servicing System, whereby the privileges due to student 

beneficiaries shall be credited to their respective individual Savings Deposits 

Accounts with DBP. 

 

10.25 Under the agreement, CHED will deposit with DBP the fund/s for 
disbursement which shall be maintained in an interest-earning Special Savings 

Deposit, based on the prevailing rates or depending on the applicable program 

requirement.  

 

10.26 Also, Section C.2 of the MOA disclosed that the following are the 
responsibilities of the DBP, quoted as follows: 

 

“2. The DBP shall: 

 

a. Act as UNIFAST partner in the disbursement of financial 
assistance grant in accordance with the agreed rules and 

regulations of the UNIFAST and the attached Implementing 

Guidelines (Annex A); 

 

b. Attend and participate in the training on this financial assistance 
programs to be conducted by the UNIFAST; 

c. Allow UNIFAST student beneficiaries to open the SBSAs with 
DBP Branches with no maintaining balance pursuant to the 

Implementing Guidelines (Annex A) and upon presentation of the 

following: 

 

(a) One (1) Valid Identification Document (ID) 
(b) Two (2) recent 1X1 ID pictures 
(c) Notarized Waiver of Rights 
(d) Other documents as may be required under DBP’s 

guidelines 

 

d. Inform the student beneficiaries upon opening their accounts that 
they are required to update their bank records every two (2) years 

from date of opening. 

 



202 

 

e. Allow UNIFAST to avail of the DBP Cash Management Solution 
(Electronic Banking) (e-Banking) services and all its related 

modules/functions subject to DBP’s guidelines and policies for 

more efficient implementation of the Agency’s disbursement 

requirements. 

 

f. Conduct periodic monitoring of the enhancement program 
activities as the case may be.” 

 

10.27 On September 30, 2019, the CHED transferred the amount of 
₱1,000,000,000.00 to DBP for the implementation of the SLP for AY 2018-

2019 which was taken from the continuing appropriations of CY 2019. 

Subsequently, this was deposited in Savings Account No. 00-5-13397-435-9 

maintained in DBP for the said purpose. 

 

10.28 Verification of the Bank Statements for this account submitted to the Audit 
Team revealed that there were no transactions to this account, except those 

credits for interest earnings with a total amount of ₱1,013,745.94; henceforth 

the balance of ₱1,001,013,745.94 as of December 31, 2020. Apparently, no 

student-beneficiaries were able to avail of the loan program since the fund 

remained unutilized as of December 31, 2020. 

 

10.29 Perusal of the MOA disclosed that the responsibility of the DBP is limited only 
to the opening of accounts for the student-beneficiaries, disbursement of loans 

to them, and periodic monitoring activities. However, there were no provisions 

in the MOA that the DBP will be in-charge of collecting the repayments from 

student-beneficiaries. Accordingly, the absence of this provision in the MOA 

became the setback in the implementation of the SLPTE-ST. This also 

contravenes Section 2.2, Rule II of MC No. 2018-0003 requiring that the MOA 

shall include a provision that the GFI will be responsible for the collection of 

repayments from student-beneficiaries. 

 

10.30 The case was also confirmed based on inquiry with the UniFAST. According 
to them, they have received about 1,000 applications for the SLPTE-ST, but 

they were not able to start the program because the MOA with DBP covers 

only the implementation of the disbursement requirements of UniFAST but 

has no provision on how to go about the collection of repayments from the 

SLPTE-ST student-beneficiaries. Currently, they are communicating with 

DBP to discuss alternative courses of action to address the issue. 

 

10.31 On the other hand, with regard to interest earned of ₱1,013,745.94, RA No. 
10931 and its IRRs do not specify that interests earned on the fund shall be 

retained; hence, the provisions of DOF Department Circular No. 01-2017 

applies and the interest should be remitted to the National Treasury. The 

remittance of the amount to the BTr could be a source of fiscal space to 

accommodate the country’s various medical and social needs as a result of the 

ongoing pandemic. 



203 

 

10.32 We recommended that the Management: 
 

a. revisit the MOA with DBP and make the necessary revisions therein 
to include a provision on loan repayment facilities and mechanism in 

order to address the setback in the implementation of the SLPTE-ST 

and henceforth, enable the students to avail the benefits of the 

program; and 
 

b. remit to the National Treasury the interest earnings in compliance 
with DOF Department Circular No. 01-2017, to help augment the 

government’s COVID-19 response and disaster relief efforts. 

 

 

Setbacks in the implementation of K to 12 Transition Program 

 

11. The objectives of the K to 12 Transition Program were not fully achieved due to: 
a) violations noted in the terms and conditions on the scholars’ eligibility and 

continuance of their scholarship privileges as prescribed under CMO No. 03 s. 

2016, as amended by CMO No. 36s. 2016, CMO No. 3, s. 2017, and CMO No. 04, 

s. 2017, thus only 27 have completed their doctoral/masteral course and only 47 

are on active status out of the 143 scholars in CHEDRO NCR as of December 31, 

2020; b) failure of CHEDRO VIII to utilize the fund received from CHED-CO for 

the implementation of the program in CYs 2018, 2019 and 2020 totaling 

₱30,089,570.67; and c) no refund received from the withdrawn/terminated 

scholars with total financial benefits received of ₱721,0000.00 and ₱1,090,000.00 

in CHEDROs NCR and VIII, respectively. 

 

11.1 The Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (RA No. 10533), an Act 
Enhancing the Philippine Basic Education System by Strengthening its 

Curriculum and Increasing the Number of Years for Basic Education, has a 

great impact on tertiary education because it will reduce enrollments in HEIs 

for five years from 2016 to 2021, thus affecting the status of teaching and non-

teaching personnel.  There is also a need to revise the General Education 

curriculum and policies, standards and guidelines of college programs due to 

the movement of courses to Senior High School. 

 

11.2 To prepare for the impact to the higher education sector of the transition to the 
full-scale implementation of the K to 12 Enhanced Basic Education Program, 

the CHED is offering scholarships to faculty and staff of HEIs to earn graduate 

degrees during that transition period. The guidelines of which were provided 

under CMO No. 03, s. 2016, as amended by CMO No. 36, s. 2016, and further 

amended by CMO No. 4, s. 2017.  

 
11.3 Article VI of CMO No. 04 s. 2017 states, among others, the following:  

 

• Scholars officially enrolled and with executed scholarship contracts and 
have complied with all necessary documentary requirements shall be 



204 

 

entitled to receive financial benefits and privileges as herein stipulated. The 

Commission shall endeavor to create mechanisms for timely disbursal of 

allowances.  
 

• Each scholar will be required to make the periodic submissions to the 
Commission for the duration of the scholarship. The Commission may 

require that these requirements be submitted through an online portal, or 

through other mechanisms as required by the Commission depending on the 

nature of requirement.  
 

• For cases of deferment, the scholar must submit a formal request to the 
Commission prior to the enrolment period of the prospected DHEI for the 

term approved by the Commission xxx. The Commission shall review the 

scholar’s request for deferment and provide feedback within fifteen (15) 

working days from receipt of the request.  
 

11.4 Article VI of CMO No. 03, s. 2016 provides the following instances wherein 
the scholarship can be terminated, to wit: 

 

• The grantee fails to meet the academic standards set by the DHEI. 

• The grantee resigns or transfers from his/her Sending HEI (SHEI) to 
another HEI without prior approval from the SHEI and the Commission  

• Other justifiable grounds which prove the inability of the grantee to 
complete his/her degree.  

 

11.5 Article V of CMO No. 04, s. 2017, on the Privileges and Incentives, states that 
scholars approved for Full Scholarships shall receive a scholarship package 

consisting of: Tuition and other fees, Living Allowance, Book Allowance, 

Transportation Allowance, Thesis/Dissertation Allowance and Group 

Insurance. Annex D, Appendix 6 of the said CMO lists down the scholarship 

privileges as shown in the table below. Thesis/Dissertation grantees, on the 

other hand, shall be entitled to the Thesis/Dissertation Allowance, Living 

Allowance, Transportation Allowance, and Group Insurance.

11.6 In addition, Section G of Article VI Terms and Conditions - Payment of 
Obligations of CMO No. 3 s. 2016 enumerates the following: 

 

a. All financial support extended to the scholar shall be repaid to the 
Commission in case he/she is unable to finish his/her degree and/or render 

the required years of service to the SHEI, except when the program is 

terminated due to lack of funds or due to death of the scholar. 
 

b. When a scholar fails to fulfill his/her service obligation, either due to 
unauthorized transfer to another school/institution or resignation from 

his/her SHEI, he/she is required to pay back to the concerned institution/s 

all the privileges enjoyed and the monetary value of the service obligation 

based on the salary equivalent at the time of transfer or resignation. 
 

c. The collection/deduction of a scholar’s payment obligation shall be the 
responsibility of the SHEI and the Commission.  The terms for the payment 

of obligation shall be evaluated and decided upon by the Commission. 
 

11.7 Review of the implementation of the K to 12 Transition Program disclosed the 
following deficiencies: 

 

CHEDRO Deficiencies 

NCR In the full implementation of the K to 12 Transition Program, CHEDRO NCR 
had a total of 143 approved scholars for graduate studies, 49 of which were 
taking up masteral and 94 for doctorate.  Total disbursements for the 
allowances of scholars as of December 31, 2020 amounted to ₱8,072,333.31. 
 
The status of the scholars of the program for the year ended December 31, 
2020, as submitted by the Project Technical Staff II of the K to 12 Unit of 
CHEDRO NCR to the Audit Team, are shown in the table below:

The five-year period, called the transition period, started in CY 2017 and is 
about to end in CY 2021. Verification of the Program as of year-end revealed 
the following: 

 

a. 24 scholars or 16.78% were terminated from the start due to various 
violations of CMO terms and conditions and did not push through their 
studies, hence they were not paid of their benefits. 



206 

 

CHEDRO Deficiencies 

b. seven scholars had withdrawn from the program due to inability to comply 
with the requirements, two grantees had submitted letter of withdrawal, 
three made verbal intent to withdraw, and two was confirmed by the SHEI 
to had resigned from the institution. 

 

c. four scholars who are on hold status were issued Notice to Explain due to 
overload and awaiting for school confirmation on the teaching load, one 
had submitted letter of intent to transfer to other SHEI, three are awaiting 
school confirmation on the renewal of teaching status and others are being 
monitored by K to 12 Unit. On the other hand, the two scholars who made 
misrepresentation were recommended by the Director of CHEDRO NCR 
to CHED Central Office for termination.  

 

d. 28 inactive scholars were those who had deficiencies and had not 
updated/submitted the requirements. 

 

There were five scholars who had withdrawn from the program and received 
total benefits of ₱721,000.00, thus were obliged to refund. Upon verification 
made on the status of the refund, the Officer-in-Charge of the K to 12 Unit 
commented that demand letters were already sent to the concerned scholars 
and reply on intent to refund was received from one scholar while others had 
reported physically to CHEDRO NCR and verbally made an intent to refund.  

 
Based on the foregoing, the objectives of the K to 12 Transition Program were 
not fully achieved due to the violations noted in the terms and conditions on 
the scholars’ eligibility as specified in various CMOs that resulted in the 
discontinuance of their scholarship privileges.  

VIII The total fund transfers received from the CHED-CO from the start of the 
implementation of the K to 12 Transition Program in CY 2017 up to December 
31, 2020 amounted to ₱141,884,058.20, of which ₱111,794,487.53 was 
disbursed, leaving an unutilized balance of ₱30,089,570.67 or 21.21%, as 
shown below:

CHEDRO Deficiencies 

Out of the 215 approved scholars for graduate studies as of AY 2020-2021, 

143 are active, 29 have already completed their studies, one scholar has been 

terminated, and 42 have withdrawn from the scholarship program. 
 

During the comparative review of the K to 12 scholarship grant records 

maintained by the Program Coordinator with that of the Accounting Unit, we 

noted a discrepancy of ₱14,000.00 as of December 31, 2020: 
 

Accounting Records ₱102,557,000.00 

Scholarship Unit Records  102,543,000.00 

Variance 14,000.00 

 

In addition, out of 42 scholars that have withdrawn from the Scholarship 

Program, three have received financial benefits with a total amount of 

₱980,000.00, while the remaining 39 have not received any financial benefit. 

Furthermore, one scholar was able to receive ₱110,000.00 of financial benefits 

before his termination from the scholarship program.   
 

Due to the disclosed deficiencies, despite the receipt of allocated funds, the 

Agency could not be concluded as having able to achieve full efficient and 

effective implementation of the objectives of the program since 21.21% of 

funds were unutilized. Moreover, the financial benefit received by terminated 

K to 12 grantee exposed the government funds to wastage, thus will be 

subjected to disallowance during post-audit. 
 

11.8 We recommended that the Management: 
 

a. strictly comply with the terms and conditions of CMOs that govern 
the implementation of the K to 12 Transition Program; 
 

b. provide additional/corrective measures to ensure the efficiency and 
effectiveness of the program;  
 

c. perform account analysis to identify the cause of the variance of 
₱14,000.00 and come up with an accurate and reliable K to 12 

disbursements; and 
 

d. enforce the refund of the financial benefits granted to scholars who 
had withdrawn from the Program as well as the financial benefit 

received by the terminated scholar. 
 

11.9 Management commented, thus: 
 

CHEDRO Comments 

NCR The K to 12 NCR Unit has sent out demand letters for refund and followed 
up repayments of withdrawn scholars.  Letters were sent to SHEI and scholars 

for they are jointly liable per contract. 
 

The Unit has drafted and finalized a letter to CHED-CO recommending the 

termination of grantees who did not pursue the grant. 



208 

 

CHEDRO Comments 

Individual checking of status whether inactive, on hold, withdrawn, etc. shall 

be checked thru a letter to be sent thru e-mail to see their compliance with the 

policies of CHED and to fast-track decisions of cases of on-hold grantees who 

were forwarded to the Central Office for final decision so that proper action 

can already be done by the Office. 
 

Considering that the program will end already this year and with the inception 

of a new K to 12 Transition Program called SIKAP grant, please be assured 

that this Office shall clear these issues and concerns of the K to 12 Transition 

Scholarships for Graduate Studies-Local Program. 
 

It is also worth mentioning that due to the pandemic, many grantees were not 

able to finish their requirements on time hence the undue delay.  We have sent 

call-up letters and will send their reply to CHED-CO for final decision. 
 

Moreover, the seeming failure of the Program in the CHEDRO NCR which 

was caused by the non-compliance of the grantees with the policies as 

embodied in the grant is not within the control of the Office as the grantees 

were selected by the CHED-CO. 
 

Auditors' Rejoinder:  
 

The Audit Team shall validate compliance with the recommendations. 
VIII Management commented that the audit recommendations were duly noted. 

The K-12 PMU will demand refund of the financial benefits, if possible. 

 

 

Idle/Unutilized/Unaccounted Funds 

 

12. The HEDF Seed Capital with an accumulated balance of ₱254,128,857.33 and 
other funds held in trust by CHED in the amount of ₱133,819,011.92, or a total 

of ₱387,947,869.25, remained idle/unutilized/unaccounted for at least seven to 15 

years as of December 31, 2020. Although these funds are invested at/managed by 

known government and private financial institutions and earn 

interest/investment income, the non-utilization thereof still defeated the primary 

purpose for which these funds were established. As a result, the benefits that 

could be derived from the use of these funds did not redound to its intended 

beneficiaries.  

 

12.1 The CHED-CO maintains various special and trust funds with accumulated 
year-end balance of ₱387,947,869.25, details of which are shown below:

12.2 Based on the verification made by the Audit Team, and as discussed in details 
in the succeeding paragraphs, the said funds remained 

idle/unutilized/unaccounted as at audit date, hence the benefits that could be 

derived from the use of these funds did not redound to its intended 

beneficiaries. 

 

a. Idle/Unutilized HEDF Seed Capital 
 

12.3 The HEDF was created pursuant to RA No. 7722, also known as the “Higher 
Education Act of 1994.” The HEDF was established exclusively for the 

strengthening of higher education in the entire country. 

 

12.4 The manner of contribution to the Fund as provided under Section 10 of RA 
No. 7722 are as follows: 

 

1. the amount of Five hundred million pesos (₱500,000,000) as seed capital; 
2. the amount of Fifty million pesos (₱50,000,000) for the initial operation 

of the Commission; 

3. the equivalent of forty percent (40%) annual share on the total gross 
collections of the travel tax; 

4. the equivalent of thirty percent (30%) share of the collections from the 
Professional Registration Fee; and 

5. the equivalent of one percent (1%) of the gross sales of the lotto operation 
of the PCSO. 

 

12.5 Also, as stipulated in Section 11, the Fund shall be administered by CHED. 
For sound and judicious management of the Fund, the Commission shall 

appoint a reputable government financial institution as portfolio manager of 

the Fund, subject to the following conditions: 
 

a. No part of the seed capital of the Fund, including earnings thereof, shall 
be used to underwrite overhead expenses for administration;  

 

b. Unless otherwise stipulated by the private donor, only earnings of private 
contributions shall be used for administrative expenses; 

 

c. The Commission shall appoint and organize a separate staff, independent 
administratively and budgetarily separate from the Commission 

Secretariat; and 
 

d. The Fund shall be utilized equitably according to regions and programs. 



210 

 

12.6 In November 2007, CMO No. 57 was issued to promulgate guidelines on the 
administration of and awards from the HEDF. Section 3 thereof specifically 

identifies the priority programs to be financed by the fund, quoted as follows: 

 
3.  Uses of HEDF

12.7 In 1997, an Investment Management Agreement (IMA) was executed between 
the CHED, as the Principal, and the DBP, as Investment Manager. 

 

12.8 At year-end, records show that HEDF Seed Capital had a balance of 
₱254,128,857.33 recorded under Other Investments account. However, the 

Audit Team observed that the HEDF Seed Capital remained unutilized since 

CY 2005, or for at least 15 years as of December 31, 2020, contrary to both 



211 

 

RA No. 7722 and CMO No. 57 stating that it shall be utilized exclusively for 

the strengthening of higher education in the entire country.  

 

12.9 Based on account analysis by the Audit Team, the movements in the Fund 
pertain only to the investment income earned which accumulated to 

₱123,315,330.66 as of December 31, 2020 (with the exception in one instance 

in CY 2008 wherein Management Fees from DBP were deducted from the 

Fund). Details are shown below:

2019 5,972,352.33 - 250,460,722.77

*Includes adjustment for unrecorded transactions on DBP IMA in the amount of ₱56,631,764.69  

 

12.10 As can be gleaned from the table above, the Fund has been idle/unutilized for 
at least 15 years, thus the purpose of funding priority programs/projects that 

strengthen the quality of higher education in the country was not fully attained, 

depriving its intended beneficiaries.  
 

12.11 Additionally, the necessity of maintaining the Fund has now become 
questionable. Although the Fund yields interest income, earning interest was 

not the primordial consideration of maintaining the same and it defeats the 

Fund’s objective set under RA No. 7722. For the past years, there are no work 

and financial plans showing how this Fund shall be utilized.  

 

12.12 Another reason why this Seed Capital remains unutilized is due to availability 
of enough funds coming from percentage share of CHED on the collections of 

travel tax, professional regulation fees, and lotto operations. These shares are 

being remitted directly by other NGAs to the BTr for the account of CHED, 

and a certain portion of which is released to the CHED annually upon 

submission of special budget request. These percentage shares were deemed 



212 

 

sufficient to cover the funding requirements for the priority programs/projects 

that will improve the quality of higher education. In fact, based on its FSs and 

budget accountability reports from CYs to 2018 to 2019, the HEDF has huge 

unobligated allotments and reversion of funds to the BTr, as shown below: 

 

Year 
Unobligated Allotments3 Reverted to BTr4 

(In Php) 

2018 65,393,079.17 404,221,465.46 

2019 71,030,473.74 26,418,667.65 

 

12.13 Considering the foregoing, the Seed Capital merely becomes a stand-by fund 
available for future use. Nonetheless, although the Fund is considered as seed 

capital, there is nothing in RA No. 7722 that warrants same to be held in 

perpetuity while earning interest through investment portfolios. Moreover, 

CHED is continuously assuming the risk of possible loss for the investment as 

the IMA does not guarantee a yield, return or income and not covered by the 

Philippine Deposit Insurance Commission, which losses, if any, shall be to the 

account of CHED. 

 

b. Idle/Unutilized SNPLP Funds 
 

12.14 The SNPLP is a loan program available to incoming college students, or to 
those who have already earned units in any curriculum year, to cover their 

tuition and miscellaneous fees in CHED-identified public or private HEIs.  

 

12.15 As at audit date, the SNPLP Funds has a balance of ₱51,154,782.82, broken 
down as follows: 

 

Trustee/Bank Balance (In Php) 

LBP  9,748,146.65  
Philippine National Bank (PNB)  11,305,605.22  
Government Service Insurance System (GSIS)  13,993,000.00  
DBP  16,108,030.95  

Total 51,154,782.82 

 

12.16 Similar to HEDF, the SNPLP Funds remained unutilized since CY 2005, or at 
least 15 years as of December 31, 2020; hence its purpose of providing loans 

to deserving students was not fully attained. Except for the fund managed by 

the DBP, which earns interest income annually, the SNPLP Funds held in trust 

at LBP, PNB, and GSIS remained stagnant for at least 15 years. Furthermore, 

there are also no supporting documents or financial reports submitted by LBP, 

PNB, and GSIS pertaining to the SNPLP Funds held by them, hence casting 

doubt as to the existence and accuracy of the recorded amount for these funds.

4 Taken from Statement of Cash Flows for CYs 2018 and 2019 



213 

 

It is also noteworthy to mention that the PNB is no longer an authorized 

government depository or servicing bank. 

 

c. Unused ELGF 
 

12.17 The ELGF in the total amount of ₱44,047,418.98 pertains to the contributions 
from the following financial institutions, namely: PNB, LBP and DBP. The 

ELGF, which is being managed by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, serves as 

guarantee for the unpaid loans of defaulting student borrowers. However, the 

ELGF remained unused since CY 2005 or at least 15 years as of December 31, 

2020. Records show that the movements in the fund pertains only to 

investment income earned and losses incurred, as shown below: 

 

Year

2005  - -  31,973,581.27  

2007         447,291.85  -  32,420,873.12 

2010      2,871,978.69  -  35,292,851.81 

2011      3,453,293.34  -  38,746,145.15 

2014           34,513.12  -  38,780,658.27 

2015         534,484.12  -  39,315,142.39 

2016         534,102.16  -  39,849,244.55

Total 12,108,214.23 34,376.52  44,047,418.98 

 

d. Idle/Unutilized SMLF 
 

12.18 The SMLF was created pursuant to Philippines-Australia AGRITECH Project 
and the MOA dated February 1, 2001 between the CHED, the then Department 

of Education, Culture and Sports-Educational Development Projects 

Implementing Task Force (DECS-EDPITAF), and the Australian Agency for 

International Development (AusAID). 

 

12.19 Section 2 of CMO No. 08 s. 2002 provides the purpose of SMLF, quoted as 
follows: 

 

“The primary purpose of SMLF is to provide to students enrolled in 

Diploma on Agricultural Technology (DAT)/Bachelor of 

Agricultural Technology (BAT) to gain access to loan to enable them 

to finance and implement their microprojects which are required in 

their curriculum. The long-term objective is to develop the students 

into bankable agri-entrepreneurs.” 

 

12.20 Records show that the balance of SMLF at LBP amounted to ₱35,110,294.65. 
However, verification by the Audit Team disclosed that the amount remained 



214 

 

unutilized since CY 2014, or for seven years as of December 31, 2020, and the 

movements in the account pertain only to investment income earned. 
 

e. Idle/Unutilized Teijin Scholarship Trust Fund 
 

12.21 The Teijin Scholarship Trust Fund was created pursuant to the MOA entered 
between Teijin Limited of Japan and the then State Scholarship Council of the 

Philippines.  

 

12.22 Item 2 of the MOA states the manner of grant and the purpose of the Fund, 
quoted as follows: 

 
“THE TEIJIN LIMITED 

 
1. Xxx 
2. Shall donate to the Philippine Government to be deposited in an 

authorized bank in the Philippines the amount of Y15 million 
(Japanese yen) to constitute the TEIJIN SCHOLARSHIP TRUST 
FUND which shall be open to all Filipino students only both in the 
graduate and undergraduate levels in the fields of Chemistry, 
Mechanical Engineering, Industrial Engineering, Chemical 
Engineering and Textile Chemistry.”(Underscoring supplied) 

 

12.23 Based on records, the Fund balance of ₱579,219.79 remained non-moving 
from CY 2017 up to December 31, 2020. 

 

12.24 On May 11, 2017, Dr. Patricia B. Licuanan, the former Chairperson of CHED, 
wrote a letter to the Ambassador of Japan informing the latter of the said Fund 

and the intention to return the same for reason that the interest earnings on the 

seed money is no longer enough to support a prospective beneficiary under the 

program. 

 

12.25 Notwithstanding therefrom, the Audit Team would like to emphasize that the 
fund was already donated to the Philippine Government as stipulated in Item 

2 of MOA, thus the Management may opt to revert the same to the General 

Fund. 

 

f. Unaccounted/Unsubstantiated Investments 
 

12.26 The nature of investments tagged as “reconciling items” amounting to 
₱2,927,295.68 could not be identified as they are just forwarded balances from 

prior years and there are no available records/documents to support same, 

hence casting doubt as to the existence of these investments. 

 

12.27 In view of the foregoing, this is to reiterate that for funds considered as 
dormant and/or unnecessary, Executive Order (EO) No. 431 dated May 30, 

2005 orders the reversion of the same to the general fund. It also mandated the 

Permanent Committee, created pursuant to Section 45, Chapter 5, Book VI of 



215 

 

the Administrative Code of 1987, composed of the Secretary of the 

Department of Finance as Chairman, Secretary of DBM and the Chairman of 

the Commission of Audit as members, to examine, look into and evaluate all 

existing cash deposits of whatever nature, whether foreign or local currency, 

maintained outside of the BTr with authorized government depository banks 

and other institutions by departments, bureaus and all other agencies of 

National Government. 

 

12.28 The transfer of these funds to the National Treasury, if warranted, would 
augment depleting funds of the National Government, lessen dependence to 

borrowings from multilateral financial institutions, and greatly ease current 

fiscal pressures brought by COVID-19 pandemic. 

 

12.29 We recommended that the Management: 
 

a. formulate plans and programs to maximize the utilization of the 
HEDF Seed Capital as well as the other funds maintained by CHED 

in accordance with the purpose for which they were established; 

otherwise, revert the funds to the General Fund, if warranted, to 

augment depleting funds of the National Government and greatly ease 

current fiscal pressures brought by the COVID-19 pandemic;  

 

b. submit documents, such as Trust Agreements and financial reports, 
pertaining to SNPLP Funds managed by LBP, GSIS, and PNB to 

validate the existence and accuracy of recorded amounts of these 

investments; and 

 

c. conduct thorough investigation to identify the nature of unaccounted 
investments amounting to ₱2,927,295.68 and, thereafter, consider 

whether a request for write-off is necessary. 

 

12.30 In a letter dated March 3, 2021, the HEDFS commented that they will elevate 
the concern on the utilization of HEDF Seed Capital to the Commission en 

Banc for their decision and will inform the Audit Team of the outcome. 

 
12.31 In a letter-reply dated March 8, 2021, the AFMS commented, thus: 

 

a. Follow-up letters will be sent on or before March 15, 2021 to LBP, GSIS 
and PNB. 

 

b. Out of the five (5) GFIs: LBP, DBP, PNB, SSS and GSIS, it was only SSS 
that has no balance concerning SNPLP trust accounts. They will write SSS 
to verify the balance of ₱2,482,295.68 on or before March 15, 2021. 

 

c. Concerning the reconciling item of ₱445,000.00, they shall conduct a 
thorough investigation to identify the nature and consider a request for 
write-off. 



216 

 

Unliquidated and Unexpended balances of Disbursement Acceleration Program (DAP) 

Funds  

 

13. Out of the ₱3,920,392,806.12 DAP funds transferred by CHED to 120 SUCs in 
CY 2012 for the implementation of different projects, the amount of 

₱607,593,966.97 or 15.50% thereof remained unliquidated as of December 31, 

2020, with bulk of the balance pertaining to the University of the Philippines 

System (UPS) and Mindanao State University (MSU), accounting for 76% and 

22%, respectively. Also, only ₱5,596,647.95 or less than 1% was liquidated in CY 

2020 out of the ₱613,190,614.92 balance in CY 2019, attributable to failure on the 

part of concerned SUCs to comply with the provisions of the MOA, specifically 

on the submission of LRs, as well as non-imposition of sanctions by CHED to the 

former. 

 

13.1 The DAP was a stimulus program under the Aquino Administration intended 
to ramp up public spending and to push economic growth by investing on high-

impact budgetary programs and projects to be funded from the savings 

generated during the year as well as from unprogrammed funds. 
 

13.2 However, the Supreme Court (SC) declared some acts and practices under the 
DAP as unconstitutional and the use of the unprogrammed funds void. The 

dispositive portion of the SC Decision is quoted as follows: 
 

“WHEREFORE, the Court PARTIALLY GRANTS the petitions for 

certiorari and prohibition; and DECLARES the following acts and 

practices under the Disbursement Acceleration Program, National 

Budget Circular No. 541 and related executive 

issuances UNCONSTITUTIONAL for being in violation of Section 

25(5), Article VI of the 1987 Constitution and the doctrine of 

separation of powers, namely:  
 

(a) The withdrawal of unobligated allotments from the implementing 

agencies, and the declaration of the withdrawn unobligated 

allotments and unreleased appropriations as savings prior to the end 

of the fiscal year and without complying with the statutory definition 

of savings contained in the General Appropriations Acts;  
 

(b) The cross-border transfers of the savings of the Executive to 

augment the appropriations of other offices outside the Executive; 

and 
 

(c) The funding of projects, activities and programs that were not 

covered by any appropriation in the General Appropriations Act. The 

Court further DECLARES VOID the use of unprogrammed funds 

despite the absence of a certification by the National Treasurer that 

the revenue collections exceeded the revenue targets for non-



217 

 

compliance with the conditions provided in the relevant General 

Appropriations Acts. 
 

SO ORDERED.” 

 

13.3 However, recognizing that the physical undoing of results would result in most 
undesirable wastefulness, the SC Decision ruled that the Doctrine of Operative 

Fact was applicable in this case, stating that: 
 

“The doctrine of operative fact recognizes the existence of the law or 

executive act prior to the determination of its unconstitutionality as 

an operative fact that produced consequences that cannot always be 

erased, ignored or disregarded. In short, it nullifies the void law or 

executive act but sustains its effects. It provides an exception to the 

general rule that a void or unconstitutional law produces no 

effect. But its use must be subjected to great scrutiny and 

circumspection, and it cannot be invoked to validate an 

unconstitutional law or executive act, but is resorted to only as a 

matter of equity and fair play. It applies only to cases where 

extraordinary circumstances exist, and only when the extraordinary 

circumstances have met the stringent conditions that will permit its 

application. 
 

We find the doctrine of operative fact applicable to the adoption and 

implementation of the DAP. Its application to the DAP proceeds from 

equity and fair play. The consequences resulting from the DAP and 

its related issuances could not be ignored or could no longer be 

undone.” 

 

13.4 In 2011, the CHED received DAP funds from three government agencies, 
namely: the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH), Department 

of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) and the Philippine Institute for 

Development Studies (PIDS), in the total amount of ₱4,063,399,850.00, 

broken down as follows: 

 

Agency Purpose 
Amount 

(In Php) 

DPWH Infrastructure and Facilities Upgrade 3,059,400,000.00 

DSWD Grants-in-Aid Program 500,000,000.00 

PIDS Research Development and Extension 503,999,850.00 

Total 4,063,399,850.00 

 

13.5 Out of ₱4,063,399,850.00 DAP funds received by CHED, a total of 
₱3,920,392,806.12 was transferred in CY 2012 to 120 SUCs for the 

implementation of different projects. However, records show that the amount 

of ₱607,593,966.97 or 15.50% of the total amount transferred remained 



218 

 

unliquidated as of December 31, 2020. Details of which are presented as

Total 613,190,614.92 5,596,647.95 607,593,966.97 100% 

 

13.6 As can be observed in the preceding table, huge portion of the total 
unliquidated balance of ₱607,593,966.97 pertains to the UPS and MSU, 

accounting for 76% and 22%, respectively. Also, only ₱5,596,647.95 or less 

than 1% was liquidated in CY 2020 out of the ₱613,190,614.92 balance in CY 

2019.  

 

13.7 The Audit Team would like to emphasize that there were already audit 
recommendations in the previous years for CHED to demand immediate 

liquidation from recipient SUCs; however, the following SUCs still failed to 

liquidate: UPS, Abra State Institute of Science and Technology, Benguet State 

University, Mountain Province State Polytechnic College, Adiong Memorial 

Polytechnic State College, and MSU. Since these funds were transferred to 

SUCs way back in CY 2012, the amount of ₱607,593,966.97 remained 

unliquidated for at least eight years as of audit date.  

 

13.8 The very low liquidation rate is primarily attributable to the failure of the SUCs 
to comply with the provisions of the MOA on the submission of LRs as well 

as non-imposition of sanctions by CHED to concerned SUCs. Section I.1.2.2.6 

of the MOA between CHED and UPS, as represented by Patricia B. Licuanan, 



219 

 

former Chairperson of CHED, and Alfredo E. Pascual, former President of UP, 

provides that: 
 

“I.ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE PARTIES 
 

1. The FIRST PARTY shall: 
 

Xxx 
 

2. The SECOND PARTY shall: 
 

Xxx 
 
2.6 Submit a liquidation report to the FIRST PARTY, certified 

correct by the Accountant and approved by the head of the 
institution within sixty (60) days after the completion of the 
project.” 

 

13.9 This is to reiterate that the SUC, as the implementing agency, has the 
responsibility to ensure that all transferred funds have been liquidated in 

keeping with the provisions of Section 63, Chapter 6 of the GAM for NGAs, 

Volume I. The following are the pertinent accounting policies for transfer of 

funds: 
 

• Depending on the MOA, the fund transfers may be treated as: a) If the 

MOA provides a condition that the fund shall be spent as specified and any 

excess shall be returned to the SA, the IA shall recognize the receipt of the 

fund as asset at its fair value with a corresponding liability, while the SA 

shall recognize a receivable corresponding to the fund transfer; or b) If the 

MOA provides stipulations or no condition, the IA shall recognize the 

receipt of the fund as asset at its fair value with a corresponding revenue, 

while the SA shall recognize an expense corresponding to the fund transfer. 
 

• A separate subsidiary record for each account shall be maintained by the 
IA whether or not a separate bank account is opened.  
 

• Within ten (10) days after the end of each month/end of the agreed period 
for the Project, the IA shall submit the RCI and the Report of Cash 

Disbursements (RCDisb) to report the utilization of the funds. Only actual 

project expenses shall be reported. The reports shall be approved by the 

Head of the IA. 
 

• The IA shall return to the SA any unused balance upon completion of the 
project, if stipulated in the MOA. 
 

13.10 Moreover, based on verification by the Audit Team on the Audit Reports of 
UPS and MSU, the balance of ₱607,593,966.97 is comprised of disbursements 

due for liquidation by SUCs as well as unexpended balances of funds. 



220 

 

13.11 In the case of UPS, the amount of ₱417,195,913.485 was already disbursed out 

of the total amount received by UPS Administration (UPSA) from CHED for 

the following projects: 

 

Project 
Amount Disbursed  

(In Php) 

UP Quezon Hall Rehabilitation Project Phase I 34,515,423.67 

Structural Assessment of Quezon Hall 871,000.00 

UP Faculty and Staff Housing  192,635,427.31 

e-UP Component 4: Infrastructure Development 189,174,062.50 

Total 417,195,913.48 

 

13.12 In addition to the disbursed funds of ₱417,195,913.48, there is also an 

unexpended balance of ₱14,319,510.196 in UPSA. Also, seven UP Constituent 

Units have also returned to UPSA their unexpended DAP funds totaling 

₱18,049,133.44,7 details of which are shown below: 

 

Constituent Unit 
Amount Returned to UPSA  

(In Php) 

UP Diliman 3,761,877.75 

UP Los Baños 538,962.30 

UP Manila  8,828,212.85 

UP Mindanao 2,357,478.57 

UP Open University 160,681.40 

UP Visayas 35,085.17 

UP Baguio 2,366,835.40 

Total 18,049,133.44 

 

13.13 Hence, the total unexpended balance as of audit report date amounted to 

₱32,368,823.63. 
 

13.14 However, during the Entrance Conference held on November 12, 2019, the 

CHED Management commented that UPS invoked its fiscal autonomy under 

the UP Charter and RA No. 9500, thus, it will not return any unutilized fund. 
 

13.15 The Audit Team believes that while it may be true that the UP Charter 

explicitly bestowed upon the Board of Regents of UP the “fiscal autonomy,” 

their powers and duties, however, are not without limitation.

13.16 Furthermore, Section I.1.2.2.7 of the MOA between CHED and UP, provides 
that: 

 

“I. ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE PARTIES 
 

1. The FIRST PARTY shall: 
 

Xxx 
 

2. The SECOND PARTY shall: 
 

Xxx 
 

2.7 Return to the CHED any/all unused balances of the project 
fund, including any/all income/interest earned/generated 
from the same, upon pre-termination or completion of the 
project within forty-five (45) but not more than sixty (60) 
calendar days, pursuant to Executive Order No. 
338;”(Underscoring supplied) 
 

13.17 Hence, the UPS is still required to conform to the pertinent budgeting, 
accounting and auditing rules and regulations, and cannot invoke its “fiscal 

autonomy” and retain the unexpended balances of DAP Funds.  
 

13.18 With regard to MSU, there were already payments to various infrastructure 
projects funded by DAP. Although the exact total amount could not be 

determined, the Audit Team observed that the amount of ₱61,249,846.32, 

representing payments to various infrastructure projects funded by DAP, were 

suspended in audit due to lack of complete documentation. 
 

13.19 Since the unutilized DAP funds are required to be remitted to the BTr pursuant 
to the SC Decision promulgated on July 1, 2014, which was modified on 

February 3, 2015, the CHED-CO should compel the six SUCs to immediately 

submit the required LRs and/or return any unexpended funds. Failure by the 

SUCs to immediately settle the amounts transferred has equally delayed the 

liquidation by the CHED-CO of DAP funds it received from the DPWH, 

DSWD and PIDS. 
 

13.20 We recommended that the Management: 
 

a. demand immediate liquidation from the six SUCs and impose 
appropriate sanctions in case of non-compliance thereof; and 

 

b. inquire with UPS the status of funds totaling ₱32,368,823.63 and 
require them to remit the same to the BTr or return to CHED after 

conducting a thorough validation and reconciliation of accounts. 

 

13.21 In its letter dated March 26, 2021, the AFMS commented that follow-up letters 
were sent to the six HEIs and the UPS will be required to return the 
unexpended balance of ₱32,368,823.63.  



222 

 

Disbursements not supported with adequate documentations 

 

14. Disbursements totaling ₱750,369,731.14 were of doubtful validity and propriety 
since these were paid despite the inadequate supporting documents, contrary to 

existing rules and regulations. 

 

14.1 Section4, Items 6 and 7 of PD No. 1445 states that:  
 

(6) Claims against government funds shall be supported with 

complete documentation. 
 

(7) All laws and regulations applicable to financial transactions 

shall be faithfully adhered to. 

 

14.2 Section 9, Chapter 6 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I states that the documentary 
requirements for common government transactions depending on the nature of 

expenses to be paid by checks are prescribed in COA Circular No. 2012-001 

dated June 14, 2012, as amended by COA Circular No. 2013-001 dated 

January 10, 2013. 

 

14.3 Various payments made by CHED-CO and eight CHEDROs either lacked 
complete supporting documents or some deficiencies were noted on the 

attached documents, as follows:

payroll duly acknowledged/signed by the recipients, 

contrary to existing rules and regulations, thus casting 

doubt on the validity and propriety of the transactions.

2,338,500.00 

VIII Payment for Representation and Transportation 

Allowance (RATA) lacks any supporting documents as 

proofs of the validity or authority of the claimant to receive 

the allowance.

X Payments of salaries to the two (2) Security Guards from 

AJG Security Agency in the amount of ₱466,000.00 for 

CY 2019 and for the months of January and February 2020 

were paid without the following necessary supporting 

documents for the claims: Daily Time Records (DTRs) or 

any similar proof of attendance/service, Certificate of 

Acceptance, Accomplishment Reports and proof of 

remittance to concerned government agency and/or 

GOCCs (BIR, SSS, Pag-IBIG). 

466,000.00 

Payment of salaries and wages to twenty-four (24) Job

due to deficiencies noted on the documents supporting the 

payments and the absence of some supporting documents. 

689,875,200.00 

Payments of fuel, oil and lubricant expenses were not 

supported with driver’s trip tickets. Moreover, Monthly 

Reports of Official Travel and Monthly Reports of Fuel 

Consumption were also not submitted, hence the 

regularity and reasonableness of fuel, oil and lubricants 

consumed could not be ascertained. 

31,704.88 

Total 750,369,731.14 

 

14.4 We recommended that the Management: 
 

a. require the Accountants in concerned CHEDROs to cause the 
immediate submission of the required supporting documents for the 

said disbursements to avoid suspension in audit; and  
 

b. strictly adhere to the existing rules and regulations prescribing the 
documentary requirements in disbursement of government funds. 

 

14.5 The Management comments and the corresponding Auditor’s rejoinder are as 
follows:

commented that they will require the project 

implementers to prepare/submit DV in the processing of 

claims for payment of Honorarium that are directly paid 

to payees. 
 

AFMS commented that letters will be sent to the PHEIs 

requiring submission of ORs on the transferred funds. 

 

CAR Management agreed to comply with the audit 

recommendation. 

 

II Management has taken note of the Audit Team’s 

recommendations and is now consolidating the 

documents submitted by the 36 B2HELP participating 

HEIs. A report on the status of submission of B2HELP 

documents was also submitted to the Audit Team. 

Management also informed the Audit Team that a Virtual 

Meeting for all HEIs, B2HELP and StuFAPs 

Coordinators shall be conducted on March 26, 2021 to 

discuss various concerns including the submission of 

liquidations both for TDP and B2HELP.

Auditor’s 

Rejoinder 

IV-A Management will instruct the Accountant to submit to the 

Audit Team the supporting documents.  

 

V In its reply, Management stated that the latest CMO 

issued which governs the policies and guidelines in the 

implementation of CHED scholarship program is CMO 

No. 8, s. 2019. Section 14.2.2 of the said CMO states, 

among others, that one of the documentary requirements 

for the Payment Through HEIs is a billing statement 

using the prescribed template signed by the Chief 

Accountant and President/School Head, supported by the 

Registrar’s Certificate, which specifically indicates the 

number of units enrolled, GWA, program, curriculum, 

and semester or term. 
 

It may be mentioned that in order to facilitate/simplify the 

processing of scholarship claims, the billing statement 

used in the processing of scholarship claims include not 

only the signature of the  Accountant and the 

President/School Head, but more so the Scholarship 

Coordinator and the Registrar, wherein they certify as to 

the correctness of the information contained therein, such 

as the baccalaureate program,  curriculum year, GWA, 

number of units enrolled and the amount of actual tuition 

and other school fees. Therefore, the Registrar’s 

Certification is embodied in the billing statement itself. 
 

The concerned HEIs shall then submit LR for the said 

funds, together with a copy of the Certificate of 

Enrolment and Certification of Grades of the identified 

student-grantees. 

The transactions 

with inadequate 

documentations 

mentioned in the 

audit observation 

were all recorded 

under Scholarship 

Grants/Expense, 

wherein the 

payments made 

and recorded 

under the said 

account are not 

subject to 

liquidation. 

 

VIII Already submitted the required supporting documents to 

COA, likewise, will support subsequent disbursements 

for payment of representation and transportation 

allowance. 

 

Also, the BAC will adhere to the recommendations of 

COA pertaining to procurements with incomplete 

documentations.  

 

X The Management has already verbally communicated the 

matter to the concerned Security Agency, but 

unfortunately, they can no longer provide for the DTRs 

for January 2019 to May 2020, since no records thereof 

were kept by the Security Agency, as these pertain to 

prior transactions. However, they committed to submit 

the monthly DTRs for the succeeding months starting 

June 2020 together with the proof of remittance to 

concerned government agency and/or GOCCs (BIR, SSS, 

Pag-IBIG). This Office has also verbally informed the 

two security guards to start submitting accomplishment

reports covering the succeeding months starting June 

2020. 
 

A request was made to submit starting June 2020 the 

Statement of Account (SOA), together with the following 

documentary requirements: 1) DTRs; 2) Certificate of 

Acceptance; 3) Accomplishment Reports; and 4) Proof of 

remittance to concerned government agency and/or 

GOCCs (BIR, SSS, Pag-IBIG), which will be attached to 

the DVs on the payment for security services. 

As to the non-attachment of supporting documents, the 

Management requested for consideration since 

documents were already attached to the DVs. They also 

agreed and promised to attach pertinent documents in the 

report of attendance aside from the documents attached 

in the DVs.  
 

Nevertheless, this Office will abide by the 

recommendations of the Audit Team. Henceforth, in 

subsequent transactions involving this matter, the 

original copies of the boarding pass and e-tickets will 

now be included as supporting documents for the said 

payment of plane tickets and the photocopies thereof, 

instead of the original, will be attached to the individual 

employee’s claim for reimbursement or liquidation of 

travel expenses. 

 

XI On Deficiencies on the DVs of scholarship grants 
 

• compliance with the recommendations and that they 
will rectify the noted deficiencies on the DVs of 

scholarship grants and provide the required supporting 

documents and justification as soon as possible. 
 

• the DVs and their respective supporting documents are 
available for review as indicated. The Scholarship 

Unit also prepared the Registry of DVs with 

deficiencies and corresponding courses of 

action/status. The copies of lacking documents and/or 

correction to the previously submitted documents 

were submitted to the Office of the Auditor on March 

6, 2021. 
 

• Management will issue an Office Memorandum 
ordering both the Regional Scholarship Coordinator 

and Accountant requiring them to submit a written 

explanation/justification on why no disciplinary 

measure shall be meted against them for inefficiency 

in the performance of official duties. Consequently, 

they have already submitted their written justifications

shall validate 

compliance with 

the 

recommendations.

and assured the Management and Auditor that the 

same inconsistencies will not occur in the future. 

 

On Lacking supporting documents on fuel, oil and 

lubricant expenses 
 

• Strict compliance beginning January 2021.  Culling of 
trip tickets and preparation of Monthly Report on Fuel 

Consumption for CY 2020 is already ongoing to be 

finalized the soonest possible time for submission to 

the Auditor’s Office. Also, the Management directed 

the designated driver to strictly comply on the use of 

serially numbered driver's trip ticket and properly 

accomplish the same prior to submission to the 

Accountant. The Office is practicing the use of serially 

numbered driver’s trip ticket effective January 2021. 

 

On Deficiencies in the preparation of DVs 
 

• to rectify the deficiencies, the Accountants were 
directed and sternly warned to observe due diligence 

in reviewing all DVs prior to approval for payment 

through issuance of Office Memorandum Order. 

 

 

Deficiencies in Cash Management 

 

15. Undue utilization of checks in CHEDRO III resulted in numerous cancelled 
checks totaling 588 pieces or 2.51% of the total checks prepared from January 

2020 to October 2020 as well as non-submission of cancelled checks to the Audit 

Team. On the other hand, lapses in the management of Petty Cash Fund (PCF) 

were noted in CHEDRO X wherein the payments for regular expenses were made 

thru Petty Cash and liquidation was not made within 20 days after the end of the 

year. 
 

15.1 Section 2 of PD No. 1445 states that it is the declared policy of the State that 
all resources of the government shall be managed, expended or utilized in 

accordance with law and regulations, and safeguard against loss or wastage 

through illegal or improper disposition, with a view to ensuring efficiency, 

economy and effectiveness in the operations of government. The responsibility 

to take care that such policy is faithfully adhered to rests directly with the chief 

or head of the government agency concerned. 

 

15.2 Section 4.8 of PD No. 1445 provides that generally accepted principles and 
practices of accounting as well as of sound management and fiscal 

administration shall be observed, provided that they do not contravene existing 

laws and regulations. 



228 

 

15.3 Section 1.2.2 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 provides the documentary 
requirements for the liquidation of cash advances for the replenishment of 

Petty Cash Fund. 

 

15.4 Likewise, Section 4.3 of the Revised Cash Examination Manual states that, 
thus: 

 

“4.3.1 The cash advance shall be sufficient for the recurring 

expenses of the agency for one month.  The AO may request 

replenishment of the cash advance when the disbursements reach at 

least 75%, or as the need requires, by submitting a replenishment 

voucher with all supporting documents duly summarized in a report 

of disbursements. 

 

4.3.2 The cash advance shall not be used for payment of regular 

expenses, such as rentals, subscriptions, light and water and the 

like.” 

 

15.5 Section 5.1.2 of COA Circular No. 97-002 provides that the AO shall liquidate 
his cash advance for Petty Operating Expenses and Field Operating Expenses 

within 20 days after the end of the year; subject to replenishment as frequently 

as necessary during the year. 
 

15.6 In CHEDRO III, the Audit Team observed that there is an undue utilization of 
checks for scholarship claims and other disbursements, which resulted in 

numerous cancelled checks totaling 588 pieces or 2.51 percent of the total 

checks prepared from January 2020 to October 2020. 

 

15.7 Further scrutiny revealed that the cancellations of 277 checks were made after 
identifying that the payees named therein were claimants of two scholarship 

programs. The cross checking or identification of students who are grantees of 

two scholarship programs came after the issuance of AOM Nos. 2020-003 and 

2020-004 dated August 11, 2020 and September 2,2020, respectively, on 

double scholarships. 

 

15.8 Moreover, it was also noted that the cancelled checks for the months of March 
to October 2020 were not submitted to the Audit Team.  
 

15.9 On the other hand, the replenishments of PCF in CHEDRO X amounting to 
₱73,184.18 for the period December 2019 to May 2020 were made mostly on 

reimbursable basis which include regular expenditures, online purchases and 

Petty Cash Vouchers (PCVs) that were not properly accomplished and lacked 

some supporting documents. The Audit Team also observed that: a) it took two 

to three months to replenish the Petty Cash Fund, b) replenishment reached up 

to 89% disbursements; c) PCVs were drawn only once for payments having 

different dates and d) non-liquidation within 20 days after the end of the year. 

 



229 

 

15.10 We recommended that the Management: 
 

a. Instruct the Regional Director of CHEDRO III to: 
 

• require the personnel-in-charge to be diligent and to proof-read 
the information before printing the checks;   

 

• direct the Head of the Cashier Unit to strictly monitor the process 
of preparation of checks to avoid or reduce the cancellation of 

numerous checks; and 
 

• instruct the Cashier to submit all cancelled checks to the Audit 
Team for review, verification and custodianship.  

 

b. Instruct the Regional Director of CHEDRO X to: 
 

• stop the practice of paying regular expenses thru Petty Cash as well 
as purchasing items online; 

 

• properly accomplish the PCVs; 
 

• replenish the PCF when disbursements reached 75% of the total 
cash advance; and 

 

• liquidate petty cash fund disbursements within 20 days after the 
end of the year and submit other supporting documents for the 

liquidation of cash advance for PCF as required under Section 

1.2.2 of COA Circular No. 2012-001. 

 

15.11 The Management commented, thus: 
 

CHEDRO Comments 

III In its letter dated January 6, 2021, the Management commented that: 
 

• The OIC-Director has called the attention of the Cashier, Accountant and 
the heads of the different units that process financial claims. 
 

• The UniFAST Board assured the Commission that effective AY 2020-2021, 
the portal will include the names of the TDP grantees for easy validation. 

 

• The Cashier added that with the cross validation being implemented by the 
CHEDRO, the cancellation of checks could be minimized. 

X There are some PCVs which contain more than one OR since the requestor 
has requested an amount, which was used to purchase various items specified 
in the particulars portion of the PCV.  In this instance, PCV is only drawn 
once with the total amount granted and the date granted reflected in the PCV.  
However, there are times when purchasing various items cannot be done in 
one day, therefore, some ORs have different dates.   
 



230 

 

CHEDRO Comments 

PCF was not liquidated within 20 days after the end of the year since it is 
stated in Section 35 (b), Chapter 6 of the GAM that the unused balance of the 
PCF shall not be closed/refunded at the end of the year.  The fund shall be 
closed only upon termination, separation, retirement or dismissal of the PCF 
Custodian, who, in turn, shall refund any balance to close his/her cash 
accountability. 
 

Replenishment of Petty Cash was not done on a monthly basis since 
disbursement thru PCV varies every month and the PCF is still sufficient to 
be used in the following month.  It is also stated in Section 35, Chapter 6 of 
GAM-Cash Advance for Petty Operating Expenses – The PCF shall be 
replenished as soon as disbursements reached at least 75% or as needed. 
 

Credit line for postage and courier has already been established with OCS 
(Republic Courier).  However, in the exigency of the content of the 
communication wherein the response must be transmitted on the shortest 
possible time, courier services of LBC were availed.  Services of the 
Philippine Postal Corporation and OCS were also availed for communication, 
which does not require immediate response and is paid separately thru the DV.   
 

Holiday lights were purchased online since the price is cheaper compared to 
other suppliers, however, the online seller did not provide official receipt but 
the waybill was attached to the PCV as supporting document where the total 
paid amount was reflected.  Rest assured that future online purchases shall 
have the necessary documents. 

 

This Office acknowledges the recommendations stated in the said rules and 
regulations relative to the disbursement, replenishment and liquidation of the 
Petty Cash.    

 

 

Past Due and Dormant Receivable accounts 
 

16. Out of the total receivables of ₱46,213,442,007.20 as of year-end, the amount of 
₱17,259,984,260.18 or 37.35% thereof are past due accounts, of which 

₱294,273,401.69 or 1.70%are already dormant for 10 to 25 years, with a huge 

portion of ₱115,380,322.25 referring to fund transfers to PHEIs/NGOs/POs. The 

accumulation of these huge amounts of past due and dormant receivables is 

attributable to non-compliance of the recipient HEIs/NGOs/POs on the 

submission of LRs as well as non-imposition of appropriate sanctions by CHED 

to the former. 
 

16.1 Section 63, Chapter 6 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I provides the following 
accounting policies for the transfer of funds: 

 

“a. A MOA shall be entered into by the SA and the IA for the 

undertaking by the latter of the project of the former. The MOA shall 

provide for the requirements for project implementation and 

reporting. 



231 

 

b. A separate subsidiary record for each account shall be maintained 

by the IA whether or not a separate bank account is opened. 
 

c. Within 10 days after the end of each month/end of the agreed 

period for the Project, the IA shall submit the RCI and the Report of 

Cash Disbursements to report the utilization of the funds. Only actual 

project expenses shall be reported. The reports shall be approved by 

the Head of the IA. 
 

d. The IA shall return to the SA any unused balance upon completion 

of the project, if stipulated in the MOA.” 
 
16.2 COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016 prescribes the 

guidelines and procedures on the proper disposition/closure of dormant funds 
and/or accounts of NGAs, which remained non-moving for more than ten 
years.  

 

16.3 Section 5.4 thereof defines dormant receivable accounts as those which 
balances remained inactive or non-moving in the books of accounts for 10 
years or more and where settlement/collectability could no longer be 
ascertained. The head of the government agency shall request for authority to 
write-off dormant receivable accounts, unliquidated cash advances and fund 
transfers to the COA Audit Team Leader and/or Supervising Auditor. The 
request shall be supported by documents as enumerated in Section 8.3 of the 
Circular. 
 

16.4 The Circular also prescribes the guidelines and procedures in reconciling and 
cleaning the books of accounts of NGAs, LGUs, and GOCCs of dormant 
receivable accounts, unliquidated cash advances, and fund transfers for fair 
presentation of accounts in FSs. Specifically, Item 7.0 of the same Circular 
requires the Accountant to adhere to the following guidelines: 

 

a. Conduct regular and periodic verification, analysis, and validation of the 
existence of the receivables, unliquidated cash advances, and fund 
transfers, and determine the concerned debtors, AOs  (Regular and Special 
Disbursing Officers, Collecting Officers, Cashiers) and the source and 
implementing government entities concerned. 

 

b. Reconcile the unliquidated fund transfers between the source and 
implementing government entities, prepare the adjusting entries for the 
reconciling items noted, and require liquidation of the balances.

a.1 Unliquidated fund transfers to TESDA 

 

16.7.1 Significant portion of the past due receivables in CHED-CO pertains 
to the unliquidated fund transfer to TESDA in the amount of 
₱6,900,000,000.00. 
 

16.7.2 On March 26, 2018, a MOA was entered into by CHED and TESDA 
in line with the implementation of the free TVET program in state-run 
Technical Vocational Institutions (TVIs) as a component of UAQTE. 
Paragraph C of the MOA provides that: 

 

“CHED hereby commits to transfer to TESDA the amount 
of Six Billion Nine Hundred Million Pesos 
(₱6,900,000,000.00) for the above-cited purpose, the 
release of which shall be made in two tranches, subject to 
liquidation before subsequent release, as follows: 
 
1. First tranche (on or before April 15, 2018) – One 

Billion Four Hundred Million Pesos 
(₱1,400,000,000.00) 

 
2. Second tranche (on or before June 15, 2018) – Five 

Billion Five Hundred Million Pesos 
(₱5,500,000,000.00)” 

 



234 

 

16.7.3 The relevant roles and responsibilities of CHED and TESDA as 
stipulated in the MOA are as follows: 

 

CHED: 
 

1. Shall conduct meetings, field visits and monitoring activities on 
the implementation of the Free TVET program in state-run TVIs. 

 

TESDA: 
 

1. Shall be fully responsible for the accounting and disbursement of 
the transferred funds in accordance with existing COA and other 

government regulations.  In addition, shall submit verified LRs as 

prescribed by COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 

1994. 
 

2. Shall make available the records and related documents and data 
to CHED for inspection and monitoring. 

 

3. Shall submit to CHED a monthly Fund Utilization Report of the 
release of the funds. 

 

4. Shall submit to CHED a quarterly partial liquidation report duly 
verified and certified correct by the TESDA Chief Accountant and 

approved by the Agency Head, with copies of the paid DVs in 

connection with the implementation of the Project. 
 

16.7.4 Also, Items 6, 9, 10 and 11, Article XI of TESDA Circular 60-2018 
dated September 7, 2018 provides that: 

 

“XI.  Administrative and Financial Requirements 

 

Xxx 

 

6. The TESDA RO shall submit to the Central Office a copy of 
the consolidated monthly fund utilization report of the 

released funds every fifth (5
th
) day of the following month. 

TESDA Central Office shall submit to CHED-UniFAST the 

agency consolidated report every seventh (7
th
) day of the 

following month; 

 

Xxx 

 

9. The TESDA Central Office shall submit to CHED-UniFAST a 
quarterly partial liquidation report, duly verified and certified 

by the TESDA Chief Accountant and approved by the Agency 

Head, with photocopies of paid DVs; 

 

10. TESDA Central Office shall submit to CHED-UniFAST a 
final consolidated Liquidation Report within (30) days, upon 



235 

 

completion of the project and in accordance with COA 

Circular No. 94-013 dated December 1994. The Liquidation 

Report shall be approved by the Head of Agency. In addition, 

the Chief Accountant shall issue a Certification that funds 

previously transferred to TESDA have been liquidated and 

accounted for in books as approved for in COA Circular No. 

2016-002 dated May 31, 2016; and 

 

11. TESDA Central Office shall return to CHED-UniFAST any 
unused balance of the funds transferred or proof of remittance 

to Bureau of Treasury (BTr) upon completion of the project.” 
 

16.7.5 Records show that the first tranche in the amount of 
₱1,400,000,000.00 was released to TESDA on May 21, 2018 through 
Check No. 1353292 dated March 28, 2018. However, the second 
tranche in the amount of ₱5,500,000,000.00 was not released on its 
scheduled date of on or before June 15, 2018 since the first tranche 
was yet to be liquidated at that time. 

 
16.7.6 Accordingly, the CHED and TESDA amended the MOA on 

September 3, 2018. The modifications are quoted as follows: 
 

“NOW THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the foregoing 
and their mutual covenants hereinafter set forth, the Parties 
agreed to modifications as follows: 

 
1. CHED shall release to TESDA the Second Tranche in the 

amount of Five Billion Five Hundred Million Pesos 
(₱5,500,000,000.00) without the need for prior liquidation of 
the First Tranche. 

 
2. Instead, TESDA commits to fully liquidate to CHED the First 

Tranche on or before the end of December 2018, without need 
for demand from CHED. Whereas, the Second Tranche shall 
be fully liquidated one (1) month after the completion of the 
Project. All liquidation reports to be submitted are in 
accordance with government accounting and auditing rules 
and regulations. 

 
3. All other provisions, terms and conditions contained under 

the MOA previously executed by the Parties last 28 March 
2018 shall remain to be valid and binding between the 
Parties.” 

 
16.7.7 The amended MOA provides that the scheduled release by CHED of 

the second tranche is already due on June 15, 2018 but the same cannot 
be effected for the reason that the first tranche cannot be fully 
liquidated at that time since the delivery of the procured training tool 
kits has not yet been completed and to do would require a longer 
period of documentation. It also stipulated that the timely release of 



236 

 

the second tranche to TESDA is extremely significant in order to meet 
the demand of the TVET scholars in time for the opening of classes 
nationwide in July 2018 and payment of 50% mobilization fund, and 
that any delay in the release of such funds could defeat the purpose of 
RA No. 10931. 
 

16.7.8 However, despite the amendment of the MOA, the Audit Team 
observed that the entire ₱6,900,000,000.00 remained unliquidated and 
is already past due in the books of CHED as of December 31, 2020.  

 
16.7.9 The status of the fund transfer of ₱6,900,000,000.00 based on 

Paragraph 9, Part II – Observations and Recommendations of the 
Consolidated Annual Audit Report for CY 2019 on TESDA, are as 
follows:

16.7.10 As can be gleaned above, the total amount of ₱2,844,700,026.20 
representing 41% of the total fund transfer from CHED was already 

downloaded to the TESDA ROs, while the ₱1,153,629,104.55 

representing 17% of the fund was transferred to PITC for the 

procurement of toolkits. On the other hand, the amount of 

₱1,474,274,219.40 or 21% was directly remitted to the BTr, per 

advice of the DBM, in coordination with the DOF for the 

implementation of Social Amelioration Program to address the effects 

of the COVID-19 pandemic, pursuant to Section 4 (y) of RA No. 

11469; thus leaving an unutilized fund of ₱1,427,396,649.85, which 

remained at TESDA’s Trust Fund Account. 

 

16.7.11 Considering the foregoing, the CHED-UniFAST should demand 
liquidation from TESDA by requiring the latter the immediate 

submission of the consolidated monthly FURs, Project Completion 

Reports from PITC, as well as the proof of remittance to the BTr, in 

compliance with the MOA and Items 6, 9, 10 and 11 of Article XI of 

TESDA Circular No. 60-2018. 

 

16.7.12 The CHED-UniFAST asserted that the TESDA has already presented 
their FURs on the ₱6.9 billion fund transfer in one of their board 

meetings. However, no FUR was submitted to the CHED-UniFAST 

and CHED-AFMS to date.  Likewise, validation by the Audit Team 



237 

 

revealed that the non-liquidation of the fund transfer is attributable to 

lax monitoring activities on the implementation of the Free TVET 

program in state-run TVIs as well as leniency on part of CHED-

UniFAST and the CHED-AFMS in enforcing the liquidation of funds. 
 

a.2 No deliveries on procured items in the current year for the PCARI Project 
 

16.7.13 The balance of Due from NGAs account in CHED-CO includes also 
the outstanding balance of ₱120,696,376.26 at the DBM-PS for the 

procurement of various equipment for the use in the PCARI Project. 

 

16.7.14 The PCARI Project is a new approach to enhance the skills and 
expertise of faculty and staff of Philippine universities and colleges, 

through scholarships, training and research partnerships with top-

notch research universities in California, USA, in the priority areas of 

information infrastructure development, and health innovation and 

translational medicine. 

 

16.7.15 In implementing the Project, the CHED transfers funds to DBM-PS 
for the procurement of laboratory equipment, information and 

technology equipment, and furniture. Out of the total advances made 

in CYs 2013 and 2019 totaling ₱503,062,642.88, total deliveries 

amounted to ₱382,366,266.62, thus leaving an outstanding balance at 

DBM-PS of ₱120,696,376.26 as of December 31, 2020. The summary 

of fund transfers and deliveries made as of year-end is shown below:

16.7.16 As can be observed in the above table, no deliveries were made by 
DBM-PS in CY 2020, hence affecting the efficient implementation 

and timely completion of the PCARI Project as well as bloating the 

balance of Due from NGAs account at year-end. 



238 

 

16.7.17 We recommended that the Management demand from DBM-PS 
the immediate delivery of undelivered items which are necessary 

in the implementation of the PCARI Project. 

 

a.3 Dormant balances in Due from NGAs 
 

16.7.18 Out of the total past due receivables of ₱14,810,492,240.90, 
₱64,059,973.87 thereof pertains to dormant accounts with age ranging 

from 10 to 25 years, as shown below:

Total  64,059,973.87 

 

16.7.19 These dormant receivables pertain to student scholarship grants, 
allowances, finance loan program, special study grants programs, 

faculty development program, computerization program and 

unidentified 2006 Subsidiary Ledger forwarded balances granted to 

SUCs/LUCs and NGAs. 
 

16.8 We recommended that the Management require the Accountants/Person-
in-Charge to: 

 

CHED-CO and CHEDROs II, IV-B, and VIII 
 

a. send demand letters to defaulting recipient NGAs requiring the 
immediate submission of LRs for the settlement of all unliquidated 

fund transfers, in particular those that are long overdue, and in case 

of non-compliance impose appropriate sanctions for their continued 

disregard of the rules and regulations on the timely settlement of 

transferred funds; 
 

b. after exhausting all means to demand settlement, request for authority 
to write-off the dormant account balances from COA following the 

guidelines prescribed under COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated 

December 19, 2016 in order to clear the books of long outstanding 

inactive balances and present a more reliable FSs; 

 

UniFAST Secretariat 
 

c. demand immediate liquidation of fund transfer to TESDA by 
requiring the latter to submit the LRs in compliance with the MOA to 

avoid suspension in audit; 
 



239 

 

d. require TESDA to submit a copy of report on the status of funds 
transferred to PITC in the amount of ₱1,153,629,104.55 as well as the 

Official Receipts or any proof of remittance to the BTr for the amount 

of ₱1,474,274,219.40; 
 

CHEDRO II 
 

e. conduct regular and periodic verification, analysis and validation of 
the existence of the fund transfers and determine the concerned 

implementing agencies pursuant to COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated 

December 19, 2016 and strictly comply with the  submission of FURs 

and LRs for fund transfers of the CHED CSP, CHED-TDP and CHED 

TES scholarship programs pursuant to the provisions of CMO No. 08, 

Series of 2019, CHED-DBM JMCs No. 04, Series of 2019, No. 02, 

Series of 2020 and No. 04, Series of 2020; and 
 

CHEDRO XIII 
 

f. direct the Chief Administrative Officer to:(i) strengthen the 
supervision of the Accounting Section to increase the manpower 

complement to ensure timely recording of transactions; and (ii) 

initiate a mechanism to facilitate a speedy liquidation of scholarship 

grants through regular and proactive coordination with the different 

SUCs. 

 
16.9 The Management commented, thus: 

 

CHEDRO Comments 

II Demand letters have been consistently sent to the implementing agencies. 

The SUCS and PHEIs. To ensure that the communications will reach the 

recipient schools, the demand letters were sent thru email and courier as 

requested by the Audit Team. Management has likewise conducted Zoom 

meetings attended by the scholarship coordinators, Accountants, Registrars 

and Presidents/Heads of Schools specifically for this purpose. Management 

incessantly reminded the implementing schools of the submission of their 

LRs during the monthly zoom meetings of the Director with Presidents and 

Heads of Schools and meetings of the Scholarship Unit with Coordinators. 
 

On the part of the schools, Management informed that these have responded 

to the appeals of CHEDRO II as shown in the LRs submitted to the Auditor’s 

Office but that due to protocols, some schools have difficulty in convening 

their students to receive their financial benefits resulting in delay of the 

submission of the LRs. 

 

Management is now requiring all student grantees to open ATM accounts 

(Cash Cards) thru LBP where their financial benefits/stipends will be directly 

deposited to their accounts, and that recently the LBP in partnership with 

CHED and UniFAST have also launched the master prepaid card for Tertiary 



240 

 

CHEDRO Comments 

Education Program with the same purpose. With this mode of payment, fund 

transfers to school will be eliminated or stopped. 
 

Management commented that the reports on liquidation of funds transferred 

to implementing agencies were prepared and updated by the Accountant 

every quarter as required.   
 

As to compliance to different CHED Memoranda and COA Circular on the 

submission of utilization and LRs, the Management acknowledged that 

CHEDRO II has released funds to school with unliquidated fund transfers to 

avoid reversion of the funds to the BTr. Also, it took into consideration the 

educational needs of the students since they too were affected by the 

pandemic.   
 

Management agreed to comply with the Audit Team’s recommendations and 

commented that it intends to fully implement the use of Cash Cards and 

master cards as a mode of payment to avoid fund transfers to schools. 
 

Management has extended its gratitude for the recommendation and has 

informed the Audit Team that the Accountant will immediately work out for 

the possible write-off of dormant account which remained unliquidated for 

more than ten years in accordance with COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated 

December 19, 2016. 
 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

The Audit Team affirms its recommendation of the submission of LRs, 

otherwise, a Notice of Suspension will be issued because the yearly 

unliquidated balances are of very significant amounts especially those of the 

most recent years. The write-off of the dormant accounts will still depend on 

the evaluation done by the Accountant and the compliance with the 

documentary requirements as provided in COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated 

December 19, 2016 on the write-off of dormant accounts. 

III During the conduct of exit conference, the OIC acknowledged the fact that 

CHEDRO III will have a hard time in resolving the issue on the past due 

accounts because these involves receivables aged from two years to 23 years. 

Nevertheless, the same will be elevated to CHED Central Office for some 

consultations on how to treat these past due accounts 

IV-B The Management will put an extra effort to gather documents to support the 

write-off and will constantly enforce on HEIs the refund/liquidation of their 

account balances. 

VI The amount of ₱82,028,000.00 Due from NGAs, was for the SAFE and 

Study Now Pay Later Loan Program (SNPLP). For FYs 2010 and 2013, 

respectively, demand letters were sent to the HEI’s recipients of SAFE Loans 

and grantees of SNPLP. There were already SNPL grantees who have settled 

their loans, however, the SAFE Loan HEI recipients have not yet submitted 

their liquidations, hence follow-up demand letters were sent to them for strict 

compliance. 

VIII Management commented that recommendations are duly noted. Demand 

letters will be sent to the HEIs. 



241 

 

CHEDRO Comments 

VIII Management will exert extra effort to send demand letters to SUCs 
concerned and closely monitor the utilization of fund transfers. As agreed, 

the Audit Team will also coordinate with the COA of these SUCs  thru 

sending of confirmation letters.

16.11 The fund transfer to DAP on August 30, 2006 for the financial benefits of 
grantees for AY 2006-2007 under the Priority Development Assistance Fund 
(PDAF) of Congressman Eufroncio Codilla Sr., 4th District of Leyte, 
amounting to ₱120,000.00 remained inactive or non-moving in the books of 
accounts for more than 10 years as at December 31, 2020. According to the 
Chief Accountant of AFMS, they have already issued a demand letter to the 
DAP in the previous year, but they did not receive any reply. 
 

16.12 For PITC, out of the funds transferred from CYs 2015 to 2017 totaling 
₱1,019,697,800.49, only ₱261,789,326.14 or 25.67% was delivered, leaving a 
balance of ₱757,908,474.35. 

 
16.13 Likewise, PFC has not submitted LR on the transferred funds of 

₱10,000,000.00 on July 19, 2006 for the procurement of initial seeds/planting 
materials and management fee of PFC for the project JATROPHA. The Chief 
Accountant of HEDFS informed the Audit Team that they sought the help of 
the Resident Auditor of PFC pertaining to the liquidation of said fund transfer. 
The latter informed CHED that the said program has been audited, which 



242 

 

resulted in audit suspension of ₱9,624,946.54, audit disallowance of 
₱243,283.85 and Credit Notice (CN) of ₱132,664.58. The CN was recorded 
per JEV No. 2019-06-001733 to reduce the balance of PFC to ₱9,867,335.42. 
In a letter dated November 7, 2019 addressed to the Supervising Auditor of 
PFC, the HEDFS has already requested for a copy of the action taken by the 
Management of the PFC or a copy of settlement/final decision on the amount 
disallowed and suspended in order for them to determine the next steps to settle 
the matter. However, they have not yet received a response to their request. 

 
16.14 The continued existence of these long outstanding and non-moving receivables 

in the books of accounts of CHED casts doubt on the reliability of the Due 
from GOCCs account. 

 
16.15 We reiterated our prior year’s recommendations that Management direct 

the Chief Accountants of AFMS and HEDFS to: 
 

a. impose appropriate sanctions against the DAP and PFC for failure to 
settle its past due unliquidated fund transfers despite the demand 

letters sent; and 
 

b. after exhausting all means to demand settlement from the debtor, 
request authority to write-off the dormant account balances from 

COA following the guidelines prescribed under COA Circular                     

No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016 in order to clear the books of 

long outstanding inactive balances.

₱45,549,056.08, the amount of ₱22,553,955.38 or 49.52% thereof was already

16.18 These dormant receivables pertain to student scholarship grants, financial 
assistance and regional staffs travel expenses and allowances during 

workshop/orientation. 
 

16.19 Although these dormant receivables are recorded in the books of accounts of 
CHED-CO, the Management is still responsible in enforcing submission of 

LRs from concerned CHEDROs, otherwise, request for authority to write-off 

these dormant accounts is in order to present a more reliable FSs. 
 

16.20 We recommended that the Management require the Chief Accountants of 
AFMS and HEDFS to: 

 

a. send demand letters to defaulting recipients requiring the immediate 
settlement of all unliquidated fund transfers in particular those that 

are long overdue and in case of non-compliance, impose appropriate 

sanctions for their continued disregard of the rules and regulations 

on the timely settlement of transferred funds; and 
 

b. after exhausting all means to demand settlement, request authority to 
write-off the dormant account balances from the COA following the 

guidelines prescribed under COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated 

December 19, 2016 in order to clear the books of long outstanding 

inactive balances and present a more reliable FSs. 

 

16.21 In a letter dated March 25, 2021, the AFMS commented that demand letters 
were sent to concerned CHEDROs and to comply with the recommendation to 

request authority to write-off the dormant account balances from the COA after 

exhausting all means to demand settlement. 

 

16.22 In a letter dated April 7, 2021, the HEDFS commented, thus: 
 

a. They will forward the documents submitted by CHEDRO VIII on their 
request for relief from accountabilities for government properties and 

liquidation documents that were lost due to the super typhoon Yolanda; 

and  



244 

 

b. The recommendation is well taken to request the write-off of dormant 
accounts from COA following the prescribed guidelines. 

 

d) Due from NGOs/POs 
 

16.23 Section 5.4 of COA Circular No. 2007-001 dated October 25, 2007 provides 
that within 60 days after the completion of the project, the NGO/PO shall 

submit the FUR certified by the Accountant and approved by its 

President/Chairman to the Government Organization (GO), together with the 

inspection report and certificate of project completion rendered/issued by the 

GO authorized representative, list of beneficiaries with their 

acceptance/acknowledgment of the project/funds/goods/services rendered. 

The validity of these documents shall be verified by the internal auditor or 

equivalent official of the GO and shall be the basis of the GO in recording the 

fund utilization in its books of accounts. These documents shall support the 

liquidation of funds granted to the NGO/PO. 

 

16.24 Section 11.1 D.3 of CMO No. 13, s. 2014 requires the participating PHEIs to 
submit to CHEDRO LRs on the disbursement of funds for payment of financial 

benefits of scholars/grantees/borrowers. 

 

16.25 The CHED transfers funds to various PHEIs/NGOs/POs for the 
implementation of the former’s various programs such as student’s 

scholarships/study grants, faculty development, research and development, 

center of excellence/development on priority disciplines, legal education 

system and accreditation of course programs.   

 

16.26 The balance of the Due from NGOs/POs account as of December 31, 2020 
amounted to ₱16,238,663,703.75. Of this amount, ₱1,527,541,595.07 or 

9.41% are already past due accounts in CHED-CO and CHEDROs NCR, II,

the part of CHED to enforce liquidations from PHEIs/NGOs/POs as well as 

the failure of PHEIs to comply with the provisions of the MOA, specifically 

on the submission of LRs to settle their outstanding fund transfers. Henceforth, 

in order to cleanse the books of accounts, the Management could resort to 

writing-off of dormant receivable accounts and unliquidated fund transfers in 

accordance with the guidelines and procedures under COA Circular

16.29 The continued existence of significant amount of long outstanding fund 
transfers and dormant receivables rendered the balance of Due from 

NGOs/POs account unreliable. 
 

16.30 We reiterated the following recommendations to the Management: 
 

a. send demand letters to defaulting HEIs/NGOs requiring the 
immediate settlement of all unliquidated fund transfers, in particular 

those that are long overdue, and in case of non-compliance, impose 

appropriate sanctions for their continued disregard of the rules and 

regulations on the timely settlement of transferred funds; and 

 

b. after exhausting all means to demand settlement, request for 
authority to write-off the dormant account balances from the COA 

following the guidelines prescribed under COA Circular                                

No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016 in order to clear the books of 

long outstanding inactive balances and present a more reliable FSs. 

 
16.31 Management commented, thus: 

 

Office/ 

CHEDRO 
Comments 

CO They have sent 93 demand letters to PHEIs with long overdue accounts, and 
will be assigning an accounting staff to specifically handle the dormant 

receivables account. 

II Management relayed its appreciation of the recommendation and informed 
the Audit Team that the Accountant will immediately work out for the 

possible write-off of dormant accounts which remained unliquidated for 

more than ten years in accordance with COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated 

December 19, 2016. 

III During the exit conference, the OIC acknowledged the fact that CHEDRO 
III will have a hard time in resolving the issue on the past due accounts 

because these involve receivables aged from 2 years to 23 years. 

Nevertheless, the same will be elevated to CHED-CO for some consultations 

on how to treat these past due accounts. 

IV-B The Management commented that they are continuously reminding the HEIs 
to submit LR on the funds transferred through demand letters and constant 

verbal reminders.   The funds transferred for SAFE Loan shall remain in the 

books as receivable for it is treated as revolving funds of the HEIs.  The rest 

of the receivables cannot be enforced for immediate liquidation due to the 

COVID-19 pandemic 

VIII Recommendations are duly noted. Demand letters will be sent to the HEIs.

CHEDRO I will continue to follow-up the LRs of PCCAST and NCST. 
However, if after exhausting all means and no appropriate action can be

a. send demand letters to defaulting HEIs/NGOs and employees 
requiring the immediate settlement of all unliquidated fund transfers, 

in particular those that are long overdue, and in case of non-

compliance, impose appropriate sanctions for their continued 

disregard of the rules and regulations on the timely settlement of 

transferred funds; and 
 

b. after exhausting all means to demand settlement, request for authority 
to write-off the dormant account balances from the COA following the 

guidelines prescribed under COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated 

December 19, 2016 in order to clear the books of long outstanding 

inactive balances and present a more reliable FSs. 
 

16.40 Management commented, thus: 
 

CHEDRO Comments 

III During the exit conference, the OIC acknowledged the fact that CHEDRO III 
will have a hard time in resolving the issue on the past due accounts because 

these involve receivables aged from 2 years to 23 years. Nevertheless, the same 

will be elevated to CHED-CO for some consultations on how to treat these 

past due accounts

CHEDRO Comments 

IV-B The Agency is trying to produce the supporting documents needed for the 
write-off of receivables for loans granted to student-borrower under SNLP, 

however, the Agency is unable to do so due to inadequate information on the 

said grant. 

 

The Management will put extra effort to gather documents to support the write-

off and will constantly enforce to HEIs the refund/liquidation of their account 

balances. 

VIII Management will abide by the recommendations of COA. As agreed, the 
concerned personnel of CHED will update the SNPLP Masterlist/Database and 

intensify efforts to enforce payment. 

 

Other compliance issues relative to the monitoring of receivables 

 

16.41 In the course of audit, the Audit Teams observed the following deficiencies or 
other practices that affect the reliability of the Receivable accounts, to wit: 

 

Summary of Other Compliance issues in Receivable Accounts (In Php)

NCR Due from NGOs/POs - Additional TES Funds for AYs 
2018-2019 and 2019-2020 totaling ₱375,393,260.00 were

to ₱175,933,429.50. 

375,393,260.00 

II Due from NGOs/POs - Twenty-eight private HEIs were

despite absence of liquidation from the previous year’s 

outstanding balance. 

4,398,900.00 

Due from NGAs - Likewise, 16 subsidiary ledgers of 16 

different schools showed that no liquidation was made for 

the prior years unliquidated balance yet new fund transfers 

or grants for educational financial assistance were made 

amounting to ₱6,053,500.00. 

6,053,500.00 



252 

 

16.42 We recommended that the Management require the Accountants or 
person-in-charge to: 

 

CHEDROs NCR, II and XIII 
 

a. intensify effort on the monitoring and enforcement of liquidations of 
unliquidated fund transfers by PHEIs on account of TES funds, 

and/or impose appropriate sanctions, in order to prevent the 

accumulation of unliquidated fund transfers; 
 

CHEDROs II 
 

b. require the immediate submission of liquidation reports of fund 

transfers by the concerned public and private HEIs covering the 

period CY 2008 to CY 2019 in the amount of ₱43,671,062.50 and 

₱55,259,142.48, respectively, otherwise, notice of suspension will be 

issued; 
 

c. require the Accountant to conduct  regular and periodic verification, 

analysis and validation of the existence  of the fund transfers and 

determine the concerned implementing agencies pursuant to COA 

Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016  and strictly comply 

with the  submission of utilization and liquidation reports for fund 

transfers of the CHED CSP, CHED-TDP, CHED-TDP Ongoing and 

CHED TES scholarship programs pursuant to the provisions of CMO 

No. 08, s. 2019, CHED-DBM JMCs No. 04, s. 2019, No. 02, s. 2020 and 

No. 04, s. 2020; 
 

CHEDRO XIII 
 

d. strengthen the supervision of the Accounting Section to increase the 
manpower complement to ensure timely recording of transactions; 

and 
 

e. initiate a mechanism to facilitate a speedy liquidation of scholarship 
grants through regular and proactive coordination with the different 

SUCs. 
 

16.43 Management of CHEDRO II commented that demand letters have been 
consistently sent to the implementing agencies, the SUCS and PHEIs.  To 

ensure that the communications will reach the recipient schools, the demand 

letters were sent thru email and courier as requested by the Audit Team. 

Management has likewise conducted zoom meetings attended by the 

scholarship coordinators, Accountants, Registrars and Presidents/Heads of 

Schools specifically for this purpose. Management incessantly reminded the 

implementing schools of the submission of their liquidation reports during the 



253 

 

monthly zoom meetings of the Director with Presidents and Heads of Schools 

and meetings of the Scholarship Unit with Coordinators. 

 

On the part of the schools, management informed that these have responded to 

the appeals of CHEDRO II as shown in the LRs submitted to the Auditor’s 

Office but that due to protocols, some schools have difficulty in convening their 

students to receive their financial benefits resulting to the delay of the 

submission of the liquidation reports. 
 

Management added that it is now requiring all student grantees to open ATM 

Accounts (Cash Cards) thru LBP where their financial benefits/stipends will be 

directly deposited to their accounts, and that recently the LBP in partnership 

with CHED and UniFAST have also launched the master prepaid card for 

Tertiary Education Program with the same purpose.  With this mode of 

payment, fund transfers to school will be eliminated or stopped. 
 

Management commented that the reports on liquidation of fund transferred to 

implementing agencies were prepared and updated by the Accountant every 

quarter as required.   
 

As to compliance to different CHED Memoranda and COA Circular on the 

submission of utilization and LRs, the management acknowledged that 

CHEDRO II has released funds to school with unliquidated fund transfers to 

avoid reversion of the funds to the BTr. Also, it took into consideration the 

educational needs of the students, since they too were affected with the 

pandemic.   
 

Management agreed to comply with the Audit Team’s recommendations and 

commented that it intends to fully implement the use of Cash Cards and master 

cards as a mode of payment to avoid fund transfers to schools. 
 

 

Unliquidated Cash Advances 

 

17. Cash Advances of some employees in CHEDRO IV-B and X amounting to 
₱351,183.68, which includes ₱16,070.68 granted to officer/employees who are no 

longer connected with CHEDRO IV-B, remained unliquidated as of December 

31, 2020, contrary to Sections 4.1 and 5.8 of COA Circular No. 97-002.   

 

17.1 Section 4.1 of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 requires that 
a cash advance shall be reported on as soon as the purpose for which it was 

given has been served.  

 

17.2 Likewise, Section 5.8 of the said Circular requires that cash advances shall be 
fully liquidated at the end of each year.

purposes as of December 31, 2020 that remained unliquidated 

despite s. follow-ups and issuance of demand letters for the 

immediate liquidation of cash advances particularly at year-end 

in previous years.  
 

Inquiry with the Accounting Section revealed that the non-

liquidation of some of the cash advances was due to the lack of 

documentary requirements and that regular follow-ups for 

liquidation were made to the concerned AOs but to no avail. Most 

of the subject unliquidated cash advances were drawn in CY 

2018. 

315,353.00 

Total 351,183.68 

 

17.5 The failure to liquidate cash advances immediately after completion of the 
purpose for which these were granted is contrary to Sections 4.1 and 5.8 of COA 

Circular No. 97-002, thus exposing the funds to possible loss and/or misuse and 

prevented the timely accounting and recording of the related expenses for which 

these advances were granted. 

 

17.6 We recommended that the Management demand the immediate 
liquidation and/or refund of the outstanding cash advances pursuant to 

COA Circular No. 97-002 to avoid its accumulation and determine the 

propriety of disbursements.  

 

17.7 Management commented, thus: 
 

CHEDRO Comments 

IV-B Out of ₱35,830.68 unliquidated balance as of December 31, 2020, ₱11,200.00 
were liquidated in January 2021. The remaining balance were made by 

accountable personnel who were no longer connected to the Agency and on 

which the location cannot be traced. 



255 

 

CHEDRO Comments 

Demand letters were continuously sent to the remaining concerned AOs.  The 

Agency no longer grant additional cash advance to those with unliquidated 

balances.  Strict monitoring for timely liquidation of cash advances is also 

observed. 

X In their letter reply dated February 16, 2021, Management commented that it 
has already informed all the concerned employees who are still connected with 

their office to settle their unliquidated cash advances. It also communicated 
with the personnel with unsettled cash advances who is no longer connected 

with CHEDRO X, through a letter dated December 10, 2020.  
 

Once the refund and the lacking pertinent documents relative to the liquidation 
are submitted these will then be submit to the Audit Team. 
 

It commits to ensure compliance with all audit observations and 

recommendations.

CHEDROs I and IV-A, ₱2,207,135.34 or 4.84% thereof were already outstanding 

for over two to 12 years, but not yet reverted to Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit), 

contrary to Executive Order (EO) No. 87 dated August 13, 2019. 

 

18.1 EO No. 87 dated August 13, 2019 directs that all Accounts Payable which 
remain outstanding for two years or more in the books of National Government 

Agencies be reverted to the Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) of the General Fund, 

or the Cumulative Result of Operations of the National Government. Section 1 

of the EO provides that: 
 

“Reversion of Documented Accounts Payable. All documented 
accounts payable for fiscal year 2016 and years prior thereto shall be 
reverted to the Accumulated Surplus or Deficit of the General Fund, or 
the Cumulative Result of Operations of National Government. 
Henceforth, all documented accounts payable which remain 
outstanding for at least two years, for which no actual administrative 
or judicial claim has been filed, shall be subject to automatic 
reversion.” 

 

18.2 Additionally, COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 1, s. 2021 dated March 8, 2021 
prescribes the guidelines and procedures relative to the reversion of accounts 

payable, pursuant to E.O. No. 87 dated August 13, 2019 and the guidelines 

required in the release of funds for legitimate obligations that may arise after 

the reversion of accounts payable. Item 4.1 of this circular state that: 
 

“In line with Section 1 of EO No. 87, NGAs/GOCCs shall revert all 
A/Ps for FY 2017 and prior years thereto to the Accumulated 
Surplus/(Deficit) on or before the end of 2021.”

documents within the timelines set to ensure the timely review thereof and 

enforce the sanction provided under Section 122 of PD No. 1445, if 

necessary, to compel the concerned officials and employees to act 

immediately on the above observations.

to the increase in the volume of transactions 

particularly for the implementation of the TES 

program. Moreover, the implementation of the ECQ 

from March to May 2020 due to the Coronavirus 

Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has greatly 

affected the regular operations of the Agency, 

particularly in terms of travel and physically reporting 

to the office during the said months, which somehow 

resulted to the build-up of unprepared reports and 

schedules. The Agency, particularly the Accounting 

Unit, hopes to do better this year.    

 

VI The Management shall address the gaps by working 
expeditiously in the preparation and submission of 

complete and accurate FSs and likewise, the Statement 

of Comparison of Budget and Actual Amount for CY 

2020. 

 
The Management assures its steadfast commitment to 

efficiency, transparency and accountability in all 

financial operations while consistently implementing 

measures for improvement of the system in the Finance 

Unit. 

 

The Management has taken cognizance and appropriate 

action on the lacking DVs for FYs 2018, 2019 and 2020 

transactions. 

 
Relative thereto, the Cashier and the Accounting Office 

are now working closely and exerting all-out effort to 

segregate and submit the voluminous DVs for the 

Scholarship and TES transactions. There was job re-

assignment in the Cashier’s Office with the exit of the 

designated Cashier and the assumption of the new 

designated Cashier. Further, two Accountants in the 

Accounting Unit have transferred to other agencies one 

after the other in 2019, hence the unexpected transition 

caused the delay in the submission of the DVs. 
 
The Management assured full compliance with the 

audit recommendations. 

 

VII During the exit conference, the Accountant said that the 
reason why she was not able to submit the reports to the 

Office of the Auditor on/before the deadline is due to 

Management 

already submitted 

its FSs for the

CHEDRO Comments 
Auditor’s 

Rejoinder 

the failure of the AOs to submit their respective reports 

on time to the Accounting Office. 
 
For the submission of the FSs and TBs of the Trust 

Fund, the Management requested for an extension of 

the deadline of the submission since they still have to 

reconcile these accounts. Part of their action is to 

request from the LBP, copies of their prior years’ Bank 

Statements to facilitate reconciliation of these 

accounts. 
 
The concerned personnel were already directed to 

expedite the filing of the DVs and their supporting 

documents for the immediate submission to our office. 

Regular and HEDF 

in soft and hard 

copies on February 

26, 2021 and               

March 4, 2021, 

respectively. As 

for the Trust Fund, 

we are yet to 

receive the reports. 

VIII The recommendations were duly noted by 
Management. As agreed, beginning this FY 2021, the 

BAC will strictly implement the COA Circular 

mentioned and the Accountant will be required for the 

immediate submission of the documents enumerated, 

likewise, complete submission of accounts within the 

prescribed period.  

 

X The deadlines may not be strictly met because of 
circumstances beyond their control, such as but not 

limited to: (1) lack of manpower complements as 

evidenced by the Region’s Organizational Structure; 

(2) limited funds which hinders the Office from hiring 

additional personnel to share in the workload; (3) 

availability of the Bank Statements, on which the 

reports should primarily be based, depends on the 

Landbank alone; and (4) the processing and recording 

of accounting transactions/reports are manually 

prepared. 

 

XII Management committed that they will exhaust all their 
efforts to submit the DVs and other required documents 

to the Audit Team. The delay was due to other required 

reports that the Agency also has to submit to other 

government agencies and due to the travel restrictions 

caused by the pandemic. However, Management 

committed that they will improve their workflow and 

exhaust all their efforts so that they could submit the 

COA-required reports in a timely manner. 

 

XIII The Management assured their best effort to fast track 
the submission and also offered to provide the 

Auditor’s Office a staff under Cost of Service to ensure 

that all submitted vouchers will be received on time.

Compliance with Property Insurance Law 

 

21. Of the ₱992,358,702.41 total cost of property and equipment in CHED-CO and 
CHEDROs NCR, IV-A and VIII, only ₱275,111,277.65 or 27.72% was insured 

with the General Insurance Fund (GIF) of the Government Service Insurance 

System (GSIS), leaving uninsured properties of ₱717,247,424.76, contrary to RA 

No. 656 as amended by PD No. 245 dated July 13, 1973, thus exposing these 

properties to risk of not being indemnified for any damage or loss due to  any 

fortuitous events such as fire, earthquake, typhoon and/or flood. Moreover, the 

payment for the insurance premium in CHED-CO was not supported with 

Property Inventory Form (PIF), which serves as a basis for the GSIS in the 

assessment of general insurance coverage over all insurable assets, properties and 

interests of the government, contrary to Administrative Order No. 33 dated 

August 25, 1987 and COA Circular No.  2018-002 dated May 31, 2018. 

 

21.1 RA No. 656 or the Property Insurance Law, as amended by PD No. 245 dated 
July 13, 1973, requires all government agencies to have their insurable 

properties, assets, and interests insured with the GIF administered by the GSIS 

to ensure compensation of the equivalent value thereof in case of loss thru fire, 

theft or any unforeseen events. 

 

21.2 To strictly enforce RA No. 656, former President Cory C. Aquino issued 
Administrative Order No. 33 dated August 25, 1987 requiring government 

agencies to submit an updated inventory of properties of their respective offices 

to the GSIS and to secure from the GIF an insurance covering all its properties. 

 

21.3 Also, COA Circular No. 2018-002 dated May 31, 2018 provides the guidelines 
prescribing the submission by Agency officials of the PIF as basis for the 

assessment of general insurance coverage over all insurable assets, properties 

and interests of the government with the GIF of the GSIS. Section 5 thereof 

contains the specific guidelines to be observed by the head of government 

agencies and the concerned officials under his/her supervision. 

 

21.4 Audit disclosed that out of PPE balance of ₱992,358,702.41 in CHED-CO and 
CHEDROs NCR, IV-A and VIII as of year-end, only ₱275,111,277.65 or 

27.72% was insured with the GIF of the GSIS, broken down as follows:

267 

 

21.5 As presented in the table, property and equipment of CHED-CO and CHEDROs 
NCR and IV-A were inadequately insured with the GIF of the GSIS, while 

properties of the CHEDRO VIII were not insured at all, thus exposing these 

properties to risk of not being indemnified in case of damage or loss due to any 

fortuitous events such as fire, earthquake, typhoon and/or flood. 

 

21.6 Further, reasons for not securing property insurance are noted below: 
 

Office/ 

CHEDRO 
Reasons 

CO Per inquiry with the Management, they only submitted to GSIS a summary of 

items/property insured, which lists down the account balances of each PPE 

category to be insured as of December 31, 2018 which became the basis of the 

insured amount. Moreover, the purchases/additions  to the PPE accounts for 

2019 were not considered for the application of the property insurance because 

the insurance premium was paid in January 2020 and the books of accounts as 

of December 31, 2019 was not yet complete at that time. Also, the Technical 

and Scientific Equipment which pertains to machineries and equipment under 

the PCARI Project were not included in the insured assets because according 

to them the insurance premium for these equipment was not included in the 

budget of the CHED-CO. 

NCR Absence of the RPCPPE for CY 2020, as well as the unreconciled records of 

the Accountant and the Property Officer render difficulty in establishing the 

correct balances and determining the premiums for the insurance of the said 

PPE accounts. 

IV-A Has no budget allotted for insurance premiums, except for the motor vehicles.  

VIII Interview made with the Regional Accountant disclosed that the budget for 

insurance of the abovementioned properties has been included in the budget 

proposal for CY 2020 appropriations as part of Tier 2, but the whole tier was 

disapproved. The said budget for insurance could not be included in Tier 1 of 

the budget proposal because of the high-cost requirement of said insurance 

which could affect other essential items in the budget.  

 
21.7 Moreover, verification of the payment for the insurance premium of the CHED-

CO revealed that this was not supported with PIF as required in COA Circular 
No. 2018-002, thus the specific/particular insurable assets covered by the 
insurance policy could not be identified separately from those property and 
equipment not covered by the policy. 

 
21.8 We recommended that Management:  

 

a. ensure that all insurable assets are fully protected against risk of non-
indemnification in case of loss by securing sufficient yearly budget for 
their insurance premiums; 

 

b. revisit Administrative Order No. 33 and COA Circular No. 2018-002 
for guidance in the preparation of PIF; 

 



268 

 

c. prepare and submit to the GSIS, within the prescribed timeline, the PIF 
to ensure that all insurable assets and properties are adequately 

insured with the GIF; and  
 

d. reconcile regularly the book balances of the PPE accounts against the 
actual physical count to ensure that only existing assets are insured. 

 
21.9 Management commented as follows: 

 
Office/ 

CHEDRO 
Comments 

CO a. The uninsured items were equipment purchased under the PCARI Project 
and were delivered to different project sites. They shall inquire from DBM 
if they can charge the insurance costs for these equipment while awaiting 
transfer of property through donation. 

 

b. They shall prepare the PIF to determine the appropriate insurance for 2021 
and request reassessment from GSIS and make additional premium 
payment. 

 

c. They will comply with the recommendation to prepare and submit to GSIS, 
within the prescribed timeline, the PIF to ensure that all insurable assets and 
properties of CHED-CO are adequately insured with the GIF. 

 

d. They will comply with the recommendation to reconcile regularly the book 
balances of the PPE accounts against the actual physical count to ensure that 
only existing assets are insured. 

NCR The Property and Supply Officer had already submitted the Agency’s Property 

Insurance Application Form to GSIS last February 23, 2021 and is currently 

waiting for their approved payment settlement. For FY 2021, the amount of 

₱150,000.00 was already integrated in CHEDRO NCR’s budget. 

IV-B The Management commented that they will adhere to the recommendation and 

will coordinate with the GSIS to comply with the guidelines provided in COA 

Circular No. 2018-002. 

VIII CHEDRO VIII had requested a budget for insurance, however, since Inventory 

is a requirement, CHEDRO VIII will endeavor to insure the same ASAP. 

 

Gender and Development (GAD)  
 
22. TheCHED CO and  seven CHEDROs had complied with the requirements and 

provisions for the implementation of GAD programs and activities while  in  

seven  CHEDROs, audit disclosed deficiencies such as:(a) non-integration of at 

least five percent (5%) of Agency’s budget to regular activities addressing gender 

issues; (b) failure to submit GAD Plan and Accomplishment Report (AR); and 

(c) utilization of the GAD budget was not maximized contrary to the provisions 

of RA No. 11465, Joint Circular No. 2012-01 of the Philippine Commission on 

Women (PCW), National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA), and 

DBM and COA Circular No. 2014-001, thus gender issues were not properly 

addressed and the validity and accuracy of the amount utilized for GAD 

programs and activities cannot be ascertained. 



269 

 

22.1 Below are among the pertinent provisions governing the implementation of the 
GAD of agencies: 
 

a. Section 31 of the General Provisions of the 2020 GAA provides that“xxx, 
the GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of the agencies 
which shall be at least five percent of their budgets. x xx” 

 

b. Section 4 (i) of RA No. 9710, also known as the Magna Carta of Women, 
defines Gender Mainstreaming as the strategy for making women’s as well 
as men’s concerns and experiences an integral dimension of the design, 
implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of policies and programs in all 
political, economic, and societal spheres so that women and men benefit 
equally and inequality is not perpetuated. It is the process of assessing the 
implications for women and men of any planned action, including 
legislation, policies, or programs in all areas and at all levels; 

 

c. Section 3.4 of the PCW-NEDA-DBM JC No. 2012-01 provides that 
“Mainstreaming gender perspectives in agency Programs, Activities and 
Projects (PAPs) to attain the desired outcome for GAD shall be a priority 
in GAD planning and budgeting. xxx. To aid gender mainstreaming, 
agencies shall perform gender analysis using tools such as Harmonized 
Gender and Development Guidelines (HGDG), to ensure that the different 
concerns of women and men are addressed equally and equitably in their 
PAPs”;  

 

d. Section 6.1 of the same JC also states that “At least five percent (5%) of 
the total agency budget appropriations authorized under the annual GAA 
shall correspond to activities supporting GAD plans and programs. The 
GAD budget shall be drawn from the agency’s MOOE, capital outlay, and 
personal services (PS). It is understood that the GAD budget does not 
constitute an additional budget over an agency’s total budget 
appropriations.”; 

 
e. Section 6.4 thereof provides that if an agency intends to attribute a portion 

or the whole budget of major programs during the GAD planning and 
budgeting phase, it may subject the program to gender analysis using the 
HGDG tool; and 

 

f. Item V of COA Circular No. 2014-001 dated March 18, 2014 states that 
“the audited agency shall submit a copy of the Annual GAD Plan and 
Budget (GPB) to the COA Audit Team assigned to the agency within five 
(5) working days from the receipt of the approved plan from the PCW or 
their mother or central offices, as the case maybe. Likewise, a copy of the 
corresponding Accomplishment Report shall be furnished the said Audit 
Team within five (5) working days from the end of January of the preceding 
year.” 

 



270 

 

22.2 Review of GAD reports disclosed that the CHED-CO and eight CHEDROs had 
complied with the abovementioned provisions in the implementation of GAD 
and utilized at least five percent (5%) of their CY 2020 appropriations, as shown 
below:

major accomplishments are evaluation of Curricula and 
evaluation and monitoring of Program Compliance towards 
achieving a gender-responsive curriculum, programs and 
activities of the HEIs in the region.   

2,113,298.34 

VII The Management was able to formulate plans and provide 
GAD programs and projects for CY 2020 in accordance with 
Section 31 of the General Provisions of the GAA for FY 2020.

Amount 
(In Php) 

NCR Out of the nine  GAD client-focused activities reflected in the 
Consolidated Annual GPB, which are supposed to be 
implemented by the CHEDROs, only three activities were 
included in the submitted GPB of the CHEDRO NCR. Also, 
one organization-focused activity, which was included in the 
CHEDRO NCR’s GPB, was not implemented. 

 

However, on the Utilization of GAD Funds report submitted by 
the Budget Officer, indicated therein is a total disbursements of 
₱236,250.00 which was not listed in the GPB. 

437,250.00 

II Utilization of the GAD budget was not maximized as the 
implementation of COVID-19 protocols has limited the conduct 
of intended GPB activities because these activities are face-to-
face in nature.  As a consequence, no expenses were also 
incurred for travel, per diem, hotel accommodation and food, 
thus limiting the utilization of the GAD budget even more.   

533,632.17 

IV-B Non-integration of at least five percent (5%) of the Agency’s 
budget to regular activities addressing gender issues and failure 
to administer Harmonized Gender and Development Guidelines 
(HGDG) in the preparation of GAD AR. 

98,066.76 

V No GAD Plan and GAD AR were submitted by CHEDRO V to 
the Audit Team for CY 2020. 

- 

VIII No copy was furnished to the Audit Team of the endorsed GAD 
Plans and Programs to the concerned agencies from PCW.  
Also, no GAD AR was submitted for validation. 

-

allocation, contrary to Section 31 of the FY 2020 GAA 
affecting the full integration of the necessary programs and 
projects designed to address the GAD’s issues and concerns and 
provisions of applicable laws. 

536,794.04 

Total 1,605,742.97 
 

22.4 We recommended that the Management: 
 

CHEDRO NCR 
 

a. direct the GAD Focal Person to use the consolidated annual GPB 
endorsed by the PCW as basis in the preparation of the CHEDRO 
NCR’s GPB in accordance with PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular                     
No. 2012-01;  

 

b. exert extra effort in accomplishing all GAD planned activities to fully 
address and achieve gender issues and GAD objectives of the 
Commission;  

 

c. refrain from incurring expenses that were not included in the GPB; 



272 

 

CHEDROs I, III

22.5 Management commented, thus: 
 

CHEDRO Comments 

IV-B The Management commented that the activities for CY 2020 were limited due 
to COVID-19, which limits the Agency’s activities and one of these is the 
GAD programs and activities. 

VI The delay in submission of the GAD Accomplishment Report was caused by 
the death of the personnel in-charge thereof in January of this year.  The 
Management committed to submit the required GAD reports on time. 

VIII Management commented that the GAD Focal Person already submitted the 
required documents. 
 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 
The GAD Focal Person submitted the GAD Accomplishment Report on 
February 22, 2021, which is two weeks late from the date of deadline.   Still 
we emphasize for compliance of the mandated submission of the GAD Plan 
and Budget and the corresponding accomplishment report.

Senior Citizens and Differently-Abled Persons 
 

23. The CHED-CO and six CHEDROs had implemented programs and activities 
related to senior citizens and Persons with Disabilities (PWDs) in accordance 

with Section 32 of the General Provisions of RA No. 11465 or the 2020 GAA. 

However, CHEDROs X, XI and XII failed to implement the program while seven 

CHEDROs have no reports on the implementation of programs and projects 

related to senior citizens and PWDs, thus depriving them of the benefits they are 

entitled to.  

 

23.1 Section 32 of the General Provisions of GAA FY 2020 provides that “all 
agencies of the government shall formulate plans, programs and projects 

intended to address the concerns of senior citizens and persons with disability, 

insofar as it relates to their mandated functions, and integrate the same in their 

regular activities. Moreover, all government infrastructures and facilities shall 

provide architectural or structural features, designs or facilities that will 

reasonably enhance the mobility, safety and welfare of person with disability 

pursuant to Batas Pambansa Bldg. 344 and R.A  No. 7277, as amended.” 

 

23.2 The granting of privileges and incentives to PWDs is aimed to enhance their 
health, physical fitness, economic and social well-being and their integration 

into mainstream society. 

 

23.3 The CHED-CO and six CHEDROs had accomplished and continue to maintain 
programs and activities related to senior citizens and PWDs, as follows: 

 

Office/ 

CHEDRO 
Accomplishments 

CO Implemented and integrated in its regular activities the various programs and 
activities for senior citizens and differently-abled persons, in compliance 

with Section 32 of the General Provisions of RA No. 11465 or the GAA for 

FY 2020.  
I Conducted various skills and livelihood training programs and activities 

intended for the senior citizen and PWDs as per submitted accomplishment 

reports with a total amount of ₱8,555,738.28. 
II Accomplished all its targets for differently-abled persons thru quarterly and 

year-round implementation of activities concerning PWDs.   
III Substantially conducted projects formulated to address the needs of senior 

citizens and PWDs. 
V Continued its implementation of existing programs and provision of physical 

facilities to address the concerns of senior citizens and PWDs. 
VII Formulated plans, programs, activities and projects that would enhance the 

mobility, safety and welfare of the senior citizens and PWDs, in accordance 

to Section 32 of the General Provisions of RA No. 11465.  
XIII Provided assistance, incentives, scholarships and grants to 43 differently-

abled grantees. Also, technical assistance was provided to 265 senior citizens 

including four citizens who facilitated their school credentials to avail of 

graduate studies program. 



274 

 

23.4 However, CHEDROs X and XII were not able to conduct activities/seminars 

related to the welfare of senior citizens and PWDs due to the COVID-19 

pandemic,   restrictions for senior citizens and also to give due consideration to 

PWDs. Despite non-implementation of new activities and programs for senior 

citizens and PWDs in CHEDRO XI, the Management was able to maintain its 

facilities such as ramps, wheelchair and priority lane  in compliance with 

Section 32 of the General Provisions of GAA FY 2020. In addition, CHEDROs 

NCR, CAR, IV-A, IV-B, VI, VIII and IX have no reports on the implementation 

of programs and projects related to senior citizens and PWDs. 
 

23.5 We recommended that the Management integrate in their regular 

activities, plans, programs and projects, the welfare of the senior citizens 

and PWDs and continuously adhere to Section 32 of the Provisions of the 

GAA for FY 2020 to address their concerns for the ensuing years. 

 

 

Compliance with Mandatory Deductions for Taxes, GSIS, Pag-IBIG and PhilHeallth 

 

24. The CHED-CO and CHEDROs substantially complied with the proper 
deductions and remittances to the BIR in accordance with Executive Order                 

No. 651; the requirements of RA No. 8291 on the Proper Deductions and 

Remittances of GSIS Premiums; of RA No. 9679, An Act Further Strengthening 

the Home Development Mutual Fund (HDMF) and for other Purposes; and with 

RA No. 7875, an Act Instituting a National Health Insurance Program for all 

Filipinos on withholding and remittance of PhilHealth Contributions. 

Nonetheless, in CHEDRO X, taxes were not withheld on payment of water 

expenses amounting to ₱22,068.84 while the amount of withheld taxes on 

payment of electricity expenses were deficient by ₱3,323.20 contrary to RA No. 

1051. 

 

a. Compliance with Tax Laws 
 

24.1 EO No. 651 dated February 16, 1981 requires every government office or 
agency to show full and faithful compliance with tax laws and regulations and 

serve as a model to the paying public. Such directive was reiterated under 

Revenue Regulations (RR) No.1-87 dated April 2, 1987 and Revenue 

Memorandum No. 8-2003 dated April 1, 2003. 

 

24.2 Section 1 of RA 1051 provides that: 
 

“All bureaus, offices, agencies and instrumentalities of the 

government, including government owned or controlled corporations, 

provinces, cities and municipalities, shall, before making any money 

payment to private individuals, corporations, partnerships and/or 

associations, deduct and withhold any and all taxes the amount of 

which can be fixed, determined, computed or ascertained, due from 



275 

 

such individuals, corporations, partnerships and/or associations on 

account of said money payment: Provided, however, That, the 

deductions and withholdings referred to herein shall not be required in 

case previous payments of the aforesaid tax liability or liabilities had 

already been made by the corresponding payee.” 
 

24.3 In CY 2020, the CHED-CO and CHEDROs withheld from compensation and 
supplier/contractors a total amount of ₱60,084,984.03 and remitted the amount 

of ₱58,369,174.19, leaving an unremitted balance of ₱1,715,809.84, as shown 

below:

24.4 The unremitted taxes of the concerned CHEDROs were remitted within the first 
quarter of the following year. 
 

24.5 However, in CHEDRO X, post-audit of DVs on the payment of water expenses 
amounting to ₱22,068.84 for the period January 1 to July 31, 2020 revealed 

non-withholding of taxes before payment to the Cagayan de Oro Water District 

(COWD). Also, payment of electricity expenses for the period December 30, 

2019 to October 03, 2020 revealed understatement of withholding tax 

amounting to ₱3,323.20 due to inaccurate computation of taxes. 

 

24.6 We recommended the Management to strictly require the Accountant of 
CHEDRO X to withhold taxes before making any money payment to 

payees such as private individuals, corporations, partnerships and/or 

associations to comply with the prescribed laws and guidelines provided 

under RA No. 1051. 



276 

 

24.7 In their letter dated October 7, 2020, it was informed that the reason why the 
Management failed to withhold the said taxes was because of the advice by the 

former COA Auditor in 2015 not to withhold taxes on our payments for water 

expenses to COWD. Accordingly, there was an issue on the amount or rate of 

taxes applicable to COWD. Hence, no taxes were withheld during that time. 

Nevertheless, this Office will abide by the recommendations. Henceforth, in 

subsequent transactions involving this matter, we will withhold taxes in the 

applicable rates before making any payment to COWD. 

 

b. Compliance with RA No. 8291 on Proper Deductions and Remittances of GSIS 
Premiums 

 

24.8 Section 6 (b) of RA No. 8291 of the GSIS Act of 1997 provides that “Each 
employer shall remit directly to the GSIS the employees’ and employers’ 

contributions within the first ten (10) days of the calendar month following the 

month to which the contributions apply. The remittance by the employer of the 

contributions to the GSIS shall take priority over and above the payment of any 

and all obligations, except salaries and wages of its employees.” 

 

24.9 In compliance with Section 6(b) of RA No. 8291, the CHED-CO and 
CHEDROs remitted in CY 2020 a total of ₱51,071,955.14 from the total 

withheld premiums and loan amortizations of ₱51,234,078.51, leaving an 

ending balance of ₱162,123.37, as shown below:

c. Compliance with RA No. 9679, An Act Further Strengthening the Home 
Development Mutual Fund (HDMF), and for other Purposes 

 

24.10 RA No. 9679 provides that: 
 

“Section 23 – Remittance of Contributions – (a) It shall be the duty of 

every employer, private or public, to set aside and remit the 

contributions required under this Act in accordance with a mechanism 

determined by the Board of Trustees. 

 

(b) Every employer required to set aside and remit such contributions 

as prescribed under this Act shall be liable for their payment, and 

nonpayment shall further subject the employer to penalty of three 

percent per month of the amounts payable from the date the 

contributions fall due until paid.”
