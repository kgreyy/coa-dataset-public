EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

 
A. Introduction 

 

The Commission on Higher Education (CHED) was created on May 18, 1994 

through the passage of Republic Act (RA) No. 7722, the Higher Education Act of 1994. 

The establishment of the Commission was part of the broad agenda of reforms outlined by 

the Congressional Commission on Education in 1992, wherein the management of the 

country’s education sector is confined to three governing bodies with its own area of focus: 

1) CHED for tertiary and graduate education; 2) the Department of Education (DepEd) for 

basic education; and 3) the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority 

(TESDA) for technical-vocational and middle-level education. 

 

The CHED is attached to the Office of the President for administrative purposes. It 

covers both public and private higher educational institutions as well as their degree- 

granting programs in all post-secondary educational institutions. Pursuant to RA                    

No. 7722, it is mandated to undertake the following tasks: 1) promote quality education; 

2) broaden access to higher education; 3) protect academic freedom for continuing 

intellectual growth; and 4) ensure advancement of learning and research.  

 

It is headed by Chairman J. Prospero E. De Vera III and assisted by four 

Commissioners, namely: Lilian A. De las Llagas, Perfecto A. Alibin, Ronald L. Adamat 

and Aldrin A. Darilag. They generally act as collegial body in formulating plans, policies 

and strategies relating to higher education and in deciding important matters and problems 

regarding the operation of the CHED. It has an Executive Office, which oversees the over-

all implementation of policies, programs, projects and operations of the various offices 

including its 16 regional field offices. 

 

As of December 31, 2020, the CHED has the following personnel complement:

Compliance Audit 

 

2. Out of the total allotments of ₱72,826,735,006.35 received by CHED, only 
₱59,965,315,678.33 or 82.34% was obligated during the year caused by low 

utilization rates, ranging from 4.02% to 88.14%, in five of its programs/projects, 

namely: a) the Universal Access to Quality Tertiary Education (UAQTE),                          

b) provision of scholarship to faculty HEIs and administrators, c) provision of 

assistance to HEls for K to 12 Transition Programs, d) Philippine California 

Advanced Research Institutes (PCARI) Project, and e) implementation of the 

Information System Strategic Plan (ISSP), thereby affecting the timely and efficient 

implementation thereof. 

 

Moreover, out of the ₱1,676,115,042.30 allotments received by CHEDRO NCR in 

FY 2020, ₱1,667,237,813.29 or 99.47% was obligated during the year while only 

₱716,720,445.80 or 42.76% was disbursed, of which 91% of the total disbursements 

pertains to Continuing Appropriations from FY 2019, thus indicating low fund 

utilization rate caused by its lack of absorptive capacity. It was also observed in 

CHEDRO X that Sub-Allotment Release Orders (Sub-AROs) totaling 

₱1,711,462,035.00 were improperly recognized and presented during the year, and 

out of total amount, ₱86,101,320.00 pertains to scholarship benefits of students for 

AY 2019-2020 which were belatedly released, contrary to the requirements provided 

under Section 6 (c) and (d), Chapter 2 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I. (Observation 

No. 3) 

 

We recommended that the Management: 

 

a. come up with a strategy or catch-up action plan to immediately address the 
gaps/setbacks encountered in the implementation of programs and projects 

to ensure their efficient and timely implementation as well as the maximum 

utilization of funds received; 

 

b. make a representation to the CHED-CO and DBM regarding increasing of 
manpower complement; 

 

c. address the gaps/setbacks encountered in the program implementation to 
ensure efficient and optimum utilization of available resources;  

 

d. prepare a more realistic budget taking into account the projects that can be 
reasonably executed in a given year in order to trim down underspending 

and avoid possible reversion of unexpended allotments; 

 

e. facilitate the immediate release of scholarship benefits to the concerned 
students who are dependent thereon, in order not to further prejudice their 

schooling; 

 



xi 

 

f. recognize the Object Class in the Statement of Appropriations, Allotments, 
Obligations, Disbursements and Balances (SAAODB) by Object of 

Expenditures in conformity to the Object Class of the received Sub-ARO; 

 

g. submit for audit a report to the Audit Team on the status of fund utilization 
of the Sub-AROs funded from the FY 2019 GAA (Continuing 

Appropriations) totaling ₱86,101,320.00 that were belatedly released by 

CHED-CO to CHEDRO X; and 

 

h. ensure the timely release to the CHEDROs of Sub-AROs for scholarship 
Programs to respond accordingly with the educational needs of the 

concerned students.  

 

3. Out of the total allotments of ₱3,300,000,000.00 received by CHED from the 
Bayanihan to Recover as One Act, only ₱1,339,986,619.42 or 40.61% was obligated 

during the year. Moreover, out of total funds of ₱71,375,000.00 for the 

implementation of Bayanihan 2 for Higher Education Tulong Program (B2HELP) in 

CHEDROs NCR and I, ₱26,273,722.31 was not utilized at year-end, hence deprived 

some qualified grantees of their financial benefits which could have contributed for 

their educational needs. Deficiencies in the implementation of the said program in 

CHEDRO XI were also observed, such as: a) absence of proof of enrollment and 

some students were not actually enrolled in the 1st semester of  AY 2020-2021; b) 

incomplete supporting document on payments to HEIs amounting to ₱5,245,462.41; 

and c) double payment to beneficiaries in the total amount of ₱225,821.00. 

(Observation No. 4) 

 

We recommended that the Management: 
 

a. come up with a strategy or catch-up action plan to immediately address the 
gaps/setbacks encountered in the implementation of programs and projects 

to ensure their efficient and timely implementation as well as the maximum 

utilization of funds received; 
 

b. require the Regional Director of CHEDRO NCR to instruct the Student 
Financial Assistance Programs (StuFAPs) Unit to: 

 

• expedite the evaluation and selection of the Partner Institutions as well 
as the verification of the qualified B2HELP student-grantees for the 

immediate release of B2HELP funds; 

 

• strictly observe the timeline for completion of B2HELP implementation 
process as provided in the CMO; 

 

• ensure that the student-grantees awarded are qualified and legible 
students to receive the B2HELP grant; 

 



xii 

 

• require submission of complete liquidation documents from the Private 
Partner Institution who have already received B2HELP grant by sending 

demand letters; 

 

c. require the Regional Director of CHEDRO NCR to coordinate with CHED-
CO for the timely release/downloading of funds and then instruct the 

Accounting Unit to expedite the release of B2HELP Funds to the remaining 

45 Private Partner Institutions;  

 

d. require the Regional Director of CHEDRO NCR to impose sanctions to 
Private Partner Institution who will violate any provision in the CMO, 

provided that the sanction/s shall be without prejudice to the interest of the 

concerned students; 

 

e. require the Regional Director in CHEDRO I to ensure the proper and 
efficient implementation of CMO No. 10, s. 2020 and pro-actively coordinate 

with CHED-CO to warrant the timely and prompt release of B2HELP funds 

to the respective CHED ROs in accordance with Section 4(n) of RA No.  

11494; 
 

f. require the Regional Director in CHEDRO XI to direct the Scholarship Unit 
to review paid assistance to students, thru the various HEIs, and coordinate 

with the HEIs to address the noted deficiencies on the irregular payments; 

 

g. inform the HEIs of the double payments made and the corresponding 
solution on how to resolve the overpayment; 

 

h. submit to the Auditor proofs of action by both the Management and the HEIs 
in recovering the double payment; 

 

i. direct the Head of the Scholarship Unit to ensure adherence to the guidelines 
on scholarship grants or financial assistance and to always secure written 

instructions as basis for the processing of payment for grants/ financial 

assistance; and 

 

j. direct the Accountant to strictly adhere to Section 4.6 of PD No. 1445 on 
processing of claims against government funds, otherwise, she shall also be 

held liable for all the disbursements that she certified but lacked supporting 

documents. 

 

4. Funds totaling ₱20,266,619.39 intended for the implementation of nine approved 

Commission En Banc (CEB) proposals for COVID-19 projects of five SUCs/HEIs 

under the Research and Development and Extension Grants-in-Aid funded out of the 

HEDF were not released due to the inadequate monitoring, and non-enforcement of 

the liquidation of previous fund transfers, thereby defeating the objectives/purpose of 

the said projects to supplement, expand, improve and intensify existing COVID-19 

responses. (Observation No. 5) 



xiii 

 

We recommended that the Management: 
 

a. send demand letters to defaulting recipients and, henceforth, strictly enforce 

the provisions of the aforementioned COA Circulars and the Memorandum 

of Agreement (MOA), particularly those pertaining to the submission of 

Fund Utilization Report (FUR), and in case of non-compliance, impose 

appropriate sanctions for their continued disregard of the rules and 

regulations on the timely settlement and/or liquidation of transferred fund; 
 

b. regularly monitor the utilization and liquidation of fund transfers and 

compliance by the concerned SUCs/NGAs with the reporting requirements 

to avoid delay in the granting of additional/new fund transfer; 
 

c. review and determine the current status of the project proposals and 

immediately process the request for extension from CHED, if warranted; 

and  
 

d. immediately update the Audit Team of the activities and submit the required 

documents upon availability. 

 

5. Deficiencies in the implementation of five COVID-19 projects totaling 

₱5,531,656.13 were noted such as low and/or non-production and distribution of 

goods/items to frontliners/beneficiaries and fewer jobs generated than the expected 

output/deliverables as committed in the approved working plans/project proposals, 

contrary to the provisions of MOA entered into with CHED, thus the objectives of 

the projects were not fully achieved. Moreover, Terminal Reports (TRs) submitted 

by SUCs were supported with incomplete documentation, which caused delays in the 

processing and recording of liquidation, thereof. (Observation No. 6) 

 

We recommended that the Management: 
 

a. require justification/explanation from other SUCs with accomplishments 

lower than the expected output per approved working plan/project 

proposals;  
 

b. instruct CHED-Office of Planning, Research, Knowledge and Management 
(OPRKM) to: 

 

• conduct thorough review of TRs submitted by SUCs, further evaluate its 
actual accomplishments and analyze differences from the expected 

outputs, determine corresponding costs of the differences and require 

possible refunds (if any); and 
 

• follow up and require SUCs to expedite the submission of lacking 
documents to facilitate the immediate processing and recording of 

liquidation. 

 



xiv 

 

6. The inability of CHED to strictly monitor the implementation of the projects as well 
as the compliance with the project deliverables and timelines of recipient SUCS of 

COVID-19 funds, resulted in the non-submission of weekly updates of the projects 

by the grantees as required in the MOA and resulted also in delays or even non-

submission of TRs and LRs which prevented the CHED from the immediate 

assessment of the output achieved for each approved proposal. (Observation No. 7) 

 

We recommended that the Management: 

 

a. require the SUCs to submit to the OPRKM-RMD Office the regular weekly 
updates/reports with complete attachments as mentioned in the CMO 

guidelines and MOA and for the OPRKM-RMD to strictly monitor the 

submission and compliance of the said reports within the timelines; 

 

b. monitor and review the submission of the TRs of the project proposals from 
the SUCs and secure justification/s for cause of delays, if any; and 

 

c. immediately update the Audit Team of the activities and submit the TRs and 
LRs upon availability. 

 

7. Deficiencies were noted in the implementation of the Tertiary Education Subsidy 
(TES) Program such as: a) delay in the release of financial benefits to student-

grantees totaling ₱2,081,165,400.00 in CHEDROs I and XIII; b) inclusion of eight 

TES grantees with grants totaling ₱198,000.00 who are not in the master list extracted 

from the TES Management Portal of the Private Education Assistance Committee 

(PEAC) in CHEDRO X; c) payment to 39 ineligible student grantees totaling 

₱2,340,000.00 in CHEDRO I; d) double scholarship grants to 76 students in the first 

semester of Academic Year (AY) 2019-2020 in CHEDRO III; e) unliquidated/ 

delayed liquidation of fund transfers totaling ₱3,819,897,154.17 in CHED-CO and 

CHEDROs NCR and I; f) significant amount of refunds from SUCs totaling 

₱202,038,053.95 in CHED-CO primarily due to unutilized/excess TES and 

administrative cost, as well as refunds on account of duplicate entries in the name of 

beneficiaries; g) lapses in  monitoring the submission of LRs by PHEIs in CHEDRO 

NCR; h) incomplete and inappropriate documents supporting TES liquidation 

totaling ₱124,341,600.00 in CHEDRO NCR, which are not in consonance with the 

provisions of RA No. 10931, CHED UniFAST Board Memorandum TES-07-2018, 

dated November 12, 2018, Section 5.1 of UniFAST Memorandum Circular (MC) No. 

2019-001 s. 2019, Section 4(6) of PD No. 1445, casting doubts on the regularity, 

reliability and accuracy of the amounts transferred to SUCs, CHED-recognized LUCs 

and private HEIs. (Observation No. 8) 

 

We recommended that the Management:  

 

a. pro-actively coordinate with CHED-CO to expedite the transfer of funds to 
CHEDRO I to facilitate the immediate release of the financial benefits to 

private HEIs that should coincide with the start of each semester of every 



xv 

 

academic year;  

 

b. require the UniFAST to track the submission of validated and certified list 
of qualified TES grantees to CHEDRO I as their basis for payment of 

benefits to avoid delay in the release of funds to private HEIs;  

 

c. require the UniFAST Regional Coordinators to coordinate with the 
UniFAST Secretariat and other concerned Offices for the timely release of 

TES benefits funds;  

 

d. continuously initiate appropriate measures and strategies to ensure efficient 
release of subsidy to the student-grantees through the private HEIs; 

 

e. prioritize the allocation of TES slots to those listed in the master list of 
eligible student-beneficiaries; 

 

f. properly attach the master list of TES grantees extracted from the TES 
Management System Portal of the PEAC as supporting document to the 

disbursement voucher upon payment;  

 

g. strictly adhere to the pertinent guidelines under CHED MC No. 2018-0004 
for the allocation of TES; 

 

h. require the recipient HEIs to return the fund transfers which were granted 
to ineligible beneficiaries; 

 

i. strengthen and enhance the agency’s existing system on processing of 
scholarship claims so that adequate control measures are embedded in the 

system to detect and prevent deficiencies or errors such as double payment 

of scholarship grants; 

 

j. if possible, initiate appropriate action to make a centralized database system 
for all scholarship programs so that all applications are properly verified 

and correctly validated before payments;  

 

k. require the immediate refund of overpayments for double/multiple/excess 
payments made to students concerned; 

 

l. demand immediate submission of LRs from SUCs/LUCs/private HEIs 
supported with the required documents to ensure propriety of 

disbursements; 

 

m. revisit MC No. 2018-0001 dated March 26, 2018 to include a penalty clause 
in case of non-compliance by SUCs/LUCs/private HEIs with the liquidation 

requirements;  

 



xvi 

 

n. strengthen the monitoring mechanism by the Regional Coordinators of TES 
fund transfers to enable the private HEIs to immediately address the issues 

causing the delay in the submission of LRs to CHEDRO I; 

 

o. require the UniFAST Secretariat to provide justification/reason on why 
there are huge amount of refunds made by the SUCs; 

 

p. instruct the UniFAST Regional Coordinators to prepare checklist of the 
documents received from the private HEIs and prepare transmittal letter 

upon transmitting these documents to the Accounting Unit or to other 

offices; 

 

q. instruct the UniFAST Regional Coordinators to monitor the date of 
submission of LRs by the private HEIs and require them to strictly observe 

deadlines/timelines as provided in the guidelines. 

 

r. instruct the UniFAST Coordinators to: 
 

• strictly enforce compliance by the private HEIs regarding submission of 
the documentary requirements and ensure complete documentation in 

accordance with PD No. 1445 and UniFAST MC No. 2019-001 s. 2019; 

 

• inform/orient the Private HEIs of the allowed documentary 
requirements to support utilization of the 3% Administrative Support 

Cost; 

 

s. revisit the MC No. 2019-001 s. 2019 and formulate appropriate internal 
control measures in the disbursements of 3% Administrative Support Cost; 

and 

 

t. instruct the Accountant to promptly record the liquidation of the Private 
HEIs and submit the LRs to the Office of the Auditor within 10 days from 

the date of receipt of LRs as required under Paragraphs 6.05 of COA 

Circular No. 95-006 dated May 18, 1995. 

 

8. The implementation of CHED StuFAPs and the Tulong Dunong Program (TDP) in 

CHEDROs encountered some drawbacks, as follows: a) non-compliance with the 

application, selection criteria and ranking procedures as basis in the awarding of 

Notice of Award (NOA) to student-applicants in CHEDRO II, while some students 

in CHEDRO X were paid scholarship benefits with lower academic units enrolled 

and/or with lower grades than the prescribed requirements; b) payment of financial 

benefits amounting to ₱1,668,000.00 not supported with Billing Statements by the 

HEIs for the second semester of the AY; and c) double payments of financial benefits 

to 16 student-scholars and seven HEIs, contrary to CHED-DBM Joint Memorandum 

Circular (JMC) No. 04, s. 2019 and CHED Memorandum Order (CMO) No. 10, s. 



xvii 

 

2019, thus depriving the qualified and deserving student-scholars/grantees of the 

financial assistance they need to pursue their education. (Observation No. 9) 

 

We recommended that the Management: 

 

a. undergo strict ranking and selection criteria procedure on the 

recommendees of the Offices of Congressional Districts pursuant to the 

provisions of JMC No. 04, s. 2019 to ensure that the students really deserved 

and qualified as grantees of the CHED-TDP;  

  

b. conduct information dissemination of the program so that all interested 

students can apply and also to consider/include those walk-in applicants or 

those applying thru online mode especially those who are underprivileged 

and deserving students to be ranked and evaluated to ensure fairness and 

equal opportunity to all;  

 

c. stop giving financial benefits to the students with lacking enrolled academic 

units; 

 

d. submit a list of HEIs with corresponding regular load per term and the list 

of HEIs with corresponding GWA of students to qualify for TDP or other 

scholarship programs of CHED, as a reference in audit; 

 

e. require the HEIs to: i) submit tertiary grading scale, copy furnished the 

Audit Team; ii) add “remarks column” in the certified list of scholars 

whether or not a student is graduating to justify lower units enrolled and 

require a Certification from HEIs for graduating students; iii) attach 

complete Billing Statements for the semester(s) payments were 

made/intended for;  

 

f. strictly observe the guidelines set in the utilization of TDP and Private 

Education Student Financial Assistance (PESFA) under JMC No. 04 s. of 

2019 and CMO Nos. 8 and 10, s. f 2019, respectively; 

 

g. revisit/review the existing profiles of grantees to check any double or 

multiple awarding of scholarships and terminate other grants inconsistent 

with the guidelines; 

 

h. design internal control procedures and mechanism in the processing of 

StuFAPs claims to prevent incurrence of double payment of bills from 

HEIs/students; 

 

i. require the maintenance of subsidiary ledgers not only in the Accounting 

Office but also in the Scholarship Unit for reconciliation purposes; 

 



xviii 

 

j. inform the HEIs of the double payments made and the corresponding 

solution on how to resolve the overpayment; and 

 

k. cause the immediate refund of excessive/double payments to scholars and 

terminate duplicate scholarship grants availed. 

 

9. The weak loan monitoring and collection/repayment mechanism on the 

implementation of the Study Now, Pay Later Plan (SNPLP) and HEI-Based Loan 

Programs resulted in: a) low collection rate of only 0.85% or ₱444,336.07 out of the 

total amount due and demandable SNPLP Loans of ₱52,541,000.84 in CHEDROs VII 

and VIII; b) low turnover of repayments on HEI-Based Loan Programs ranging from 

9% to 26% in 78 participating HEIs in CHEDRO V; and c) non-submission of the 

required semestral reports and utilization reports for the transferred funds of 

₱80,631,967.56 to 64 participating HEIs for the SAFE Loan Program in CHEDROs V 

and VIII, contrary to CMO No. 25, s. 2008.  
 

Moreover, the Student Loan Program for Tertiary Education – Short-term Basis 

(SLPTE-ST), one of the component programs under UAQTE, with a budget allocation 

of ₱1,000,000,000.00 encountered an implementation setback in view of the deficiency 

in the MOA with the DBP wherein it covers only the disbursement of funds to student-

beneficiaries but has no provision on loan repayment facilities and mechanism as 

required  in UniFAST Memorandum Circular No. 2018-003, hence no beneficiaries 

were able to avail of the loan program, and as a consequence, the fund remained 

unutilized since its inception in CY 2018. (Observation No. 10) 

 

We recommended that the Management: 
 

a. intensify the collection of due and demandable loans by coordinating with 

appropriate government agencies such as the Social Security System, 

Government Service Insurance System, Bureau of Internal Revenue and 

National Bureau of Investigation, to request assistance in obtaining 

information on the whereabouts of the student-borrowers and their 

guarantors for the sending of demand letters and written follow-ups to them; 
 

b. require the designated focal person to prepare and submit for audit a 

monitoring report on loans receivable pertaining to SNPLP;  
 

c. if all the demand letters and written follow-ups/tracers proved to be futile, 

resort to filing of appropriate charges against the defaulting borrowers; 
 

d. carefully assess and evaluate the performance of the participating HEIs to 

determine the extent of their compliance with the MOA and pertinent CHED 

guidelines;  

 



xix 

 

e. require all non-compliant HEIs to refund the unutilized balance of revolving 

funds entrusted to them for possible re-appropriation to UniFAST programs 

pursuant to RA No. 10931; 
 

f. require the participating HEIs to submit an updated status report of loan 

program implementation and ensure that additional funds are granted to 

HEIs only upon their submission of such updated status report and 

unexpended balance, if any, is refunded to CHED, in case the granting of 

loans to student-borrowers has been discontinued; 
 

g. prepare an updated monitoring report and active file of the submitted 

documents by the HEIs for ease of reference and monitoring;  
 

h. revisit the MOA with DBP and make the necessary revisions therein to 

include a provision on loan repayment facilities and mechanism in order to 

address the setback in the implementation of the SLPTE-ST; henceforth, 

enable the students to avail the benefits of the program; and 
 

i. remit to the National Treasury the interest earnings in compliance with DOF 

Department Circular (DO) No. 01-2017, to help augment the government’s 

COVID-19 response and disaster relief efforts. 

 

10. The objectives of the K to 12 Transition Program were not fully achieved due to:                  

a) violations noted in the terms and conditions on the scholars’ eligibility and 

continuance of their scholarship privileges as prescribed under CMO No. 03 s. 2016, 

as amended by CMO No. 36s. 2016, CMO No. 3, s. 2017, and CMO No. 04, s. 2017, 

thus only 27 have completed their doctoral/masteral course and only 47 are on active 

status out of the 143 scholars in CHEDRO NCR as of December 31, 2020; b) failure 

of CHEDRO VIII to utilize the fund received from CHED-CO for the implementation 

of the program in CYs 2018, 2019 and 2020 totaling ₱30,089,570.67; and c) no refund 

received from the withdrawn/terminated scholars with total financial benefits received 

of ₱721,0000.00 and ₱1,090,000.00 in CHEDROs NCR and VIII, respectively. 

(Observation No. 11) 

 

We recommended that the Management: 
 

a. strictly comply with the terms and conditions of CMOs that govern the 

implementation of the K to 12 Transition Program; 
 

b. provide additional/corrective measures to ensure the efficiency and 

effectiveness of the program;  
 

c. perform account analysis to identify the cause of the variance of ₱14,000.00 

and come up with an accurate and reliable K to 12 disbursements; and  

 



xx 

 

d. enforce the refund of the financial benefits granted to scholars who had 

withdrawn from the Program as well as the financial benefit received by the 

terminated scholar. 

 

11. The HEDF Seed Capital with an accumulated balance of ₱254,128,857.33 and other 

funds held in trust by CHED in the amount of ₱133,819,011.92, or a total of 

₱387,947,869.25, remained idle/unutilized/unaccounted for at least seven to 15 years 

as of December 31, 2020. Although these funds are invested at/managed by known 

government and private financial institutions and earn interest/investment income, 

the non-utilization thereof still defeated the primary purpose for which these funds 

were established. As a result, the benefits that could be derived from the use of these 

funds did not redound to its intended beneficiaries. (Observation No. 12) 

 

We recommended that the Management: 

 

a. formulate plans and programs to maximize the utilization of the HEDF Seed 

Capital as well as the other funds maintained by CHED in accordance with 

the purpose for which they were established; otherwise, revert the funds to 

the General Fund, if warranted, to augment depleting funds of the National 

Government and greatly ease current fiscal pressures brought by the 

COVID-19 pandemic;  

 

b. submit documents, such as Trust Agreements and financial reports, 

pertaining to SNPLP Funds managed by LBP, GSIS, and PNB to validate 

the existence and accuracy of recorded amounts of these investments; and 

 

c. conduct thorough investigation to identify the nature of unaccounted 

investments amounting to ₱2,927,295.68 and, thereafter, consider whether a 

request for write-off is necessary. 

 

12. Out of the ₱3,920,392,806.12 DAP funds transferred by CHED to 120 SUCs in CY 

2012 for the implementation of different projects, the amount of ₱607,593,966.97 or 

15.50% thereof remained unliquidated as of December 31, 2020, with bulk of the 

balance pertaining to the University of the Philippines System (UPS) and Mindanao 

State University (MSU), accounting for 76% and 22%, respectively. Also, only 

₱5,596,647.95 or less than 1% was liquidated in CY 2020 out of the ₱613,190,614.92 

balance in CY 2019, attributable to failure on the part of concerned SUCs to comply 

with the provisions of the MOA, specifically on the submission of LRs, as well as 

non-imposition of sanctions by CHED to the former. (Observation No. 13) 

 

We recommended that the Management: 

  

a. demand immediate liquidation from the six SUCs and impose appropriate 

sanctions in case of non-compliance thereof; and 

 



xxi 

 

b. inquire with UPS the status of funds totaling ₱32,368,823.63 and require 

them to remit the same to the BTr or return to CHED after conducting a 

thorough validation and reconciliation of accounts. 

 

13. Out of the total receivables of ₱46,213,442,007.20 as of year-end, the amount of 

₱17,259,984,260.18 or 37.35% thereof are past due accounts, of which 

₱294,273,401.69 or 1.70% are already dormant for 10 to 25 years, with a huge portion 

of ₱115,380,322.25 referring to fund transfers to private HEIs/NGOs/POs. The 

accumulation of these huge amounts of past due and dormant receivables is 

attributable to non-compliance of the recipient HEIs/NGOs/POs on the submission 

of LRs as well as non-imposition of sanctions by CHED to the former. (Observation 

No. 16) 

 

We recommended that the Management: 
 

a. demand from DBM-PS the immediate delivery of undelivered items which 

are necessary in the implementation of the PCARI Project; 
 

b. send demand letters to defaulting recipients requiring the immediate 

submission of LRs for the settlement of all unliquidated fund transfers, in 

particular those that are long overdue, and in case of non-compliance impose 

appropriate sanctions for their continued disregard of the rules and 

regulations on the timely settlement of transferred funds;  
 

c. after exhausting all means to demand settlement, request for authority to 

write-off the dormant account balances from COA following the guidelines 

prescribed under COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016 in 

order to clear the books of long outstanding inactive balances and present a 

more reliable FSs; 
 

d. demand immediate liquidation of fund transfer to TESDA by requiring the 

latter to submit the LRs in compliance with the MOA to avoid suspension in 

audit;  
 

e. require TESDA to submit a copy of report on the status of funds transferred 

to PITC in the amount of ₱1,153,629,104.55 as well as the ORs or any proof 

of remittance to the BTr for the amount of ₱1,474,274,219.40; 
 

f. conduct regular and periodic verification, analysis and validation of the 

existence of the fund transfers and determine the concerned implementing 

agencies pursuant to COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016 

and strictly comply with the  submission of Fund Utilization Reports and 

LRs for fund transfers of the CHED CSP, CHED-TDP and CHED TES 

scholarship programs pursuant to the provisions of CHED Memorandum 

Order (CMO) No. 08, s. 2019, CHED-DBM Joint Memorandum Circulars 

(JMCs) No. 04, s. 2019, No. 02, s. 2020 and No. 04, s. 2020;  



xxii 

 

g. direct the Chief Administrative Officer to: (i) strengthen the supervision of 

the Accounting Section to increase the manpower complement to ensure 

timely recording of transactions; and (ii) initiate a mechanism to facilitate a 

speedy liquidation of scholarship grants through regular and proactive 

coordination with the different SUCs; 
 

h. direct the Chief Accountants of AFMS and HEDFS to impose appropriate 

sanctions against the Development Academy of the Philippines (DAP) and 

Philippine Forest Corporation (PFC) for failure to settle its past due 

unliquidated fund transfers despite the demand letters sent;  
 

i. review and analyze the propriety of the Receivable accounts and establish 

the validity of claims; and 
 

j. exert utmost efforts to collect the receivables. 

 

The foregoing audit observations and recommendations were communicated 

through Audit Observation Memoranda (AOMs) and included in the respective 

Management Letters of CHED-CO and CHEDROs, and discussed during the Virtual Exit 

Conference on May 28, 2021 with concerned CHED officials and employees. Their 

comments were incorporated in the Report, where appropriate. 

 

 

G. Status of Settlement of Suspensions and Disallowances 
 

Audit suspensions and disallowances amounting to ₱269,948,816.48 and 

₱32,343,343.09 respectively, or a total of ₱302,292,159.57 remained unsettled as of 

December 31, 2020. The details are shown in Part II of this report. 

 

 

H. Status of Implementation of Prior Years’ Audit Recommendations 

 
Out of the 353 prior years’ audit recommendations, 158 were fully implemented 

and 195 were not implemented, as shown below: 

 

Status of Implementation 
Number of 

Recommendations
