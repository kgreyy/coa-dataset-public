financial statements; (b) recommend Agency’s improvement opportunities; and (c)

E. Independent Auditor’s Report  
 

A qualified opinion was rendered on the financial statements of the JJWC as at 

December 31, 2020 for the misstatements of the total Assets, Liabilities and Net 

Assets/Equity by P28.919 million, P1.282 million and P27.779 million, respectively, which 

represents 35.74 percent, 11.94 percent and 39.59 percent of its total Assets, Liabilities and 

Net Assets/Equity, respectively. 

 

F. Summary of Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations  
 

Among the audit observations and corresponding recommendations discussed in 

Part II of this report, the significant observations are summarized as follows:   

 

1. Delayed preparation and submission of the Bank Reconciliation Statements ranging 56 
to 391 days precluded in the timely verification and review of the correctness of both 

the bank and book records, which is not in conformity with Chapter 21 of the GAM for 

NGAs, Volume I.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to:  

 

a. prepare BRSs for the agency’s bank accounts and submit the same to COA 
for further verification; and   
 

b. henceforth, follow the procedures of bank reconciliation and ensure timely 
submission of BRSs after receipt of the monthly bank statement, pursuant 

to Section 7, Chapter 21 of the GAM, Volume I, for early detection and 

correction of errors and deficiencies, to ensure correct balances of the Cash 

in bank accounts. 

 

2. The accuracy and reliability of Due from NGAs account are doubtful due to the non-
conduct of regular reconciliation and monitoring of the account, and delayed 

liquidation of fund transfers to DSWD-RJJWC Field Offices and IAs, contrary to COA 

Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to 

coordinate with the Accountants of the above-mentioned RJJWCs/IA’s on the 

submission of the liquidation documents as provided in COA Circular No. 94-013 

and record immediately the expenses incurred upon receipt thereof. 
 

3. Delayed completion of the construction/improvement of the two (2) Bahay Pag-Asa 
(BPA) projects by the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) resulted in 

the non-attainment of the project objectives and depriving the intended beneficiaries of 

the expected benefits. 

 

 

 

 



 v 

We recommended that Management require the NCMIMD to:  

 

a. make representations with the DPWH-Bureau of Construction to fast-track 
the implementation of the infrastructure projects and to submit the 

liquidation reports for recording in the books of accounts; and 

 

b. strengthen their coordination with the DPWH - Bureau of Construction for 
the completion of the remaining two (2) BPA projects to ensure that project 

objectives are accomplished within the specific project timeline so that the 

facilities can be utilized by children with CICL and enjoy the benefits that 

can be derived therefrom. 

 

G. Status of Settlement of Audit Suspensions, Disallowances, and Charges 
 

There were no unsettled balance of audit suspensions, disallowance and charges as 

of December 31, 2020 as reflected in the Statement of Audit Suspensions, Disallowances 

and Charges (SASDC). 

 

H. Implementation of Prior Year’s Audit Recommendations 
 

Of the 24 prior years’ audit recommendations, 21 were implemented, with six (6) 

reiterations, and three (3) were not implemented. The details are presented in Part III of 

this Report. 

 

We enjoin Management to ensure full implementation of all audit 

recommendations to improve the financial and operational efficiency of the Agency.
