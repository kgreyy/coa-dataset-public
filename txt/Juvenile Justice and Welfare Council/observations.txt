PART II – OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

 

Financial Audit 

 

Unreliable balances, completeness and existence of Assets, Liabilities and Equity 

accounts 

 

1. Various accounts of the Juvenile Justice and Welfare Council (JJWC) under 
the Assets, Liabilities and Equity (including Income and Expense) category were 

misstated by P28,918,545.21, P1,281,829.65 and P27,779,150.58 which represent 35.74 

percent, 11.94 percent and 39.59 percent of its total Assets, Liabilities and Equity, 

respectively.  The misstatement had significant impact on the balances of the affected 

accounts; thus, the accuracy of the balances, completeness and existence of the said 

accounts could not be relied upon.  
 

2. Paragraph 27 of International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) 1 and 
Section 15 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume I, provides that the 

financial statements shall present fairly the financial position, financial performance, and 

cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects 

of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with the definitions and 

recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in IPSAS. The 

application of IPSAS, with additional disclosures when necessary, is presented to result in 

financial statements that achieve a fair presentation. 

 

3. Moreover, Sections 111 and 112 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 requires 
agencies to keep the accounts in such detail as necessary to meet the needs of the agency 

and at the same time be adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or control 

agencies of the government; and that the highest standard of honesty, objectivity and 

consistency shall be observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate 

and misleading information. Each government agency shall record its financial transactions 

and operations conformably with IPSAS and in accordance with pertinent laws and 

regulations. 

 

4. Volume III of the GAM for National Government Agencies (NGAs) provides the 
Revised Chart of Accounts (RCA) in recording transactions.   

 

5. Verification of the Journal Entry Vouchers (JEVs), Disbursement Vouchers (DVs), 
liquidation reports, and property records disclosed accounting errors/omissions; thereby, 

affecting the accuracy and reliability of the account balances as shown in Table 1:

a. Unrecorded transactions 
 

a.1 Unrecorded reconciling items/transactions – P216,737.78 
 

6. Variance totaling P216,737.78 between the book and bank balances of Cash in 
Bank accounts resulted from the non-recording of book reconciling items and the 

delayed preparation of bank reconciliation statements (BRSs), contrary to Chapter 

21 of the GAM, Volume I, thus, affecting the reliability of the Cash-in-Bank (CIB) 

accounts as at year-end.  

 

7. Pertinent provisions of Chapter 21 of the GAM, Volume I provide, among others, 
the following:  

 

“Sec. 3. Objectives. The Bank Reconciliation Statement (BRS) shall be 

prepared in order to:  

a. check correctness of both the bank’s and agency’s/entity’s records,  

b. serve as a deterrent to fraud, and 

c. enable the agency/entity or bank to take up charges or credits 

recognized by the bank or agency/entity but not yet known to 

the agency/entity or bank.  

 

This shall be used in the reconciliation of bank and treasury accounts 

maintained with Government Servicing Bank (GSB).  

 

Sec. 6. Recognition of Adjustments. The Chief Accountant/Designated 

Staff shall prepare a JEV to recognize all reconciling items that require 

adjustment and correction in the books of accounts.” 

 

8. As at December 31, 2020, the JJWC maintained four (4) bank accounts for the 
operations of the agency, consisting of two (2) for Modified Disbursement Scheme (MDS) 

accounts and one (1) each for the current and savings accounts. However, comparison 

between the book balances and the balances per confirmation with the Land Bank of the 

Philippines (LBP) - Quezon City Hall Branch, showed a total variance of P216,737.78, the 

details of which are shown in Table 2:

Total    P 216,737.78  

 

9. We further observed that Cash-Modified Disbursement System (CIB-MDS), 
Regular account had a balance of P123,607.29, which should have been zero as at year-



40 
 

end, thus, not in accordance with Sections 2.1 and 2.3 of DBM Circular Letter No. 2019-3 

dated January 4, 2019, which states that: 

 

2.1 All NCA releases for Regular MDS Sub-Accounts, to be credited for any month, 

whether part of the comprehensive releases or constituting additional NCA 

releases, shall continue to be valid until the last working day of the 3rd month 

of the quarter covered. 

 

2.3 It is understood that all NCA balances of regular MDS Sub-Accounts at the end 

of each quarter are considered lapsed after the last working hour of said 

quarter. 

 

10. The delayed submission of BRSs caused difficulty in ascertaining the reliability of 
the year-end balances of the Cash-MDS Regular, Local Currency-Current Account 

(LCCA) and Local Currency-Savings Account (LCSA) accounts, which resulted in the non-

recording of the reconciling items/transactions totaling P216,737.78. 

 

11. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to:  
 

a. analyze, verify and conduct monthly reconciliation of the Cash in Bank 
accounts to determine the variance of P216,737.78 and to ensure 

correctness of the reported Cash in Bank and other affected account 

balances as at year-end;  
 

b. record immediately the book reconciling items to ensure the correct 
balances of the affected financial statement (FS) accounts, and provide the 

Audit Team with the pertinent JEVs for further verification. 
 

12. Management commented that the Accountant committed to undertake the 
following: (a) analyze, verify and conduct monthly reconciliation of the Cash in Bank 

accounts starting April 5, 2021, until the committed deadline of submission on April 15, 

2021; and (b) prepare a request letter to the LBP for the Bank Statements and/or snapshots 

of Cash in Bank - LCSA and of all JJWC accounts every 5th day of the following month in 

order to meet the deadline of submission. A request letter has already been prepared 

covering the months of January to December 2020, and January to February 2021.  

 

13. Management also commented that the Accounting Unit committed to record 
immediately the verified reconciling items, and JEV Nos. 2021-01-000073 and 2021-01-

000077, both dated January 4, 2021, were drawn as partial adjustments and copies thereof 

were provided to the Audit Team. 

 

a.2 Unrecorded liquidation reports - P26,922,543.29 

 

14. The accuracy and reliability of Due from NGAs account is doubtful due to the 
non-adjustment of incorrect entries of fund transfers and the non-recording of 

liquidation reports of the Department of Social Welfare and Development - Regional 



41 
 

Juvenile Justice and Welfare Committee (DSWD-RJJWC) Field Offices and 

Implementing Agencies (IAs) resulting in the overstatement of Due from NGAs and 

Accumulated Surplus/Deficit by P26,922,543.29. 

 

15. COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994 sets forth the rules and 
regulations in the grant, utilization and liquidation of funds transferred to implementing 

agencies, to ensure that the transfer is properly taken up in the books of the Source Agency 

(SA) and Implementing Agency (IA) and used only for the intended purpose, and that 

proper accounting and reporting are made on the utilization of the funds. 

 

16. Paragraph 4.6 of said Circular provides that within ten (10) days after the end of 
each month/end of the agreed period for the Project, the IA shall submit the Report of 

Checks Issued (RCI) and the Report of Disbursement (RD) to report the utilization of the 

funds.  Paragraph 4.9 further states that the IA shall return to the SA any unused balance 

upon completion of the project while Paragraph 5.4 provides that the SA shall require the 

IA to submit the reports and furnish the IA with a copy of the journal entry voucher taking 

up the expenditures. 

      

17. As at December 31, 2020, the Due from NGAs account has a reported balance of 
P60,227,949.17. Confirmation requests were sent to 17 DSWD-RJJWC field offices, the 

Procurement Service of the Department of Budget and Management (PS-DBM), and the 

Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH), out of which nine (9) responded, 

showing a discrepancy of P26,922,543.29, thereby affecting the accuracy and reliability of 

the account. Details are as follows:

18. Inquiry with the Accountant confirmed that the DPWH has already submitted 
Liquidation Reports (LRs) but these have not yet been recorded due to error encountered 

in the recording of transactions in the eNGAs. For RJJWCs, the LRs are for review and 

verification of the incurred transactions. 

 

19. Moreover, we also observed the incorrect recording of fund transfers and LRs of 
the following RJJWCs resulting in negative balances, thus, affecting the accuracy and 

reliability of the account: 

  

a. FO-VII - Fund transferred in CY 2018 under JEV No. 2018-03-000300 
amounting to P2,000,000.00 was incorrectly recorded to FO-VIII, thereby, 

resulting in a recurring negative balance on the part of FO-VII and a huge 

balance for FO-VIII; and 

 

b. FO-BARMM - LRs for CY 2017 Fund transferred under JEV No. 2018-03-
000427 in the amount of P2,613,800.00 were erroneously recorded to FO-

CARAGA, resulting in under/(over) liquidation of the same amount on the part 

of the former and the latter. 

 

20. The noted discrepancy of P26,922,543.29 was due to the non-conduct of regular 
monitoring and reconciliation of the account with the PS-DBM, DPWH and RJJWCs that 

resulted in the overstatement of Due from NGAs and Accumulated Surplus/Deficit, both by 

P26,922,543.29. 

 

21. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to: 
 

a. analyze, verify and conduct regular monitoring and reconciliation of the 
Due from NGAs account to determine the variance of P26,922,543.29 and 

to ensure correctness of the reported account balance as at year-end;  
 

b. coordinate with the Accountants of the RJJWCs/IAs on the submission of 
the liquidation documents as provided in COA Circular No. 94-013 and 

record immediately the expenses incurred upon receipt thereof; 
 



43 
 

c. prepare adjusting/correcting JEV for the erroneous recording of funds 
transferred and corresponding liquidation reports/expenses incurred 

involving FOs VII, VIII, BARMM and CARAGA; and 

 

d. determine the variance noted under the PS-DBM in order to utilize unused 
advances for the procurement of office supplies in subsequent years. 

 

22. Management commented that the Accountant committed to undertake the 
following:  

 

a. analyze, verify and conduct reconciliation of the Due from NGAs account and 
prepare necessary adjustments to ensure that the reported account balance is 

correct and valid, and submit Journal Entry Vouchers to COA on or before June 

30, 2021;  

 

b. coordinate with RJJWCs/IAs on the submission of the liquidation documents 
through monthly monitoring of RJJWCs’ submitted liquidation reports, and for 

DPWH through the coordination with the National Coordination, Monitoring 

and Information Management (NCMIM) Division;  

 

c. prepare adjusting/correcting JEV for fund transferred and liquidation of some 
RJJWCs, and submit JEVs to COA on or before June 30, 2021, as the 

Accounting Unit will prioritize the preparation and submission of JEVs for 

January to March 2021 and the preparation and submission of JEVs for 

advance payments for the General Fare Agreement (GFA) to PS-DBM and for 

accounts payable to undelivered goods.; and  

 

d. determine the variance noted for the PS-DBM through analysis of the account 
within this second quarter of CY 2021 and ensure that unused advances for the 

procurement of office supplies is utilized in subsequent years through 

coordination with the General Services of Finance and Administrative 

Division. 

 

a.3 Unrecorded ICT Equipment - P338,352.00 

 

23. The accuracy and reliability of some PPE accounts could not be ascertained 
due to unrecorded Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Equipment 

totaling P338,352.00, contrary to Section 20, Chapter 10 of the GAM, Volume I. 

 

24. Section 20, Chapter 10 of the GAM, Volume I provides that, “Deliveries of PPE 
shall be recorded immediately in the Property Card (Appendix 69) maintained by the 

Supply and/or Property Division/Unit on the basis of the IAR and other supporting 

documents. The IAR and other supporting documents shall be forwarded to the Accounting 

Division/Unit for the recording of deliveries in the books of accounts through JEV and in 

the Property, Plant and Equipment Ledger Card (PPELC) (Appendix 70). Based on the 

IAR and other supporting documents, the Supply and/or Property Division/Unit shall 



44 
 

prepare the DV and submit to the Accounting Division/Unit for the processing of payment 

(Refer to Chapter 6-Disbursements).” 

 

25. Analysis of the ICT Equipment account as at December 31, 2020 showed that two 
(2) deliveries of purchased notebook computers were not recorded, due to voluminous 

works, in the book of accounts as shown in Table 4 below:

26. The unrecorded seven (7) notebook computers resulted in the inaccuracy of the 
balances of the affected ICT Equipment account as reported in the Financial Statements. 

 

27. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accounting Unit to 
prepare the Journal Entry Vouchers to record the seven (7) notebook computers to 

ensure the correct balances of the affected accounts. 

 

28. The Accountant prepared JEV Nos. 2021-01-000009 and 2021-01-000071, dated 
January 4, 2021, to record the seven (7) notebook computers.  

 

b. Erroneous recording/classification of transactions  
 

b.1 Erroneous classification of Furniture and Fixtures, and Leased Assets 

Improvements accounts -  P221,700.00 
 

29. The accuracy and reliability of some PPE accounts could not be ascertained 
due to erroneous classification of the Furniture and Fixtures and Leased Assets 

Improvement  accounts by the Accounting Unit totaling P221,700.00, contrary to 

Section 10, Chapter 8 and Sections 3, 4 and 20, Chapter 10 of the GAM, Volume I. 

 

30. Section 10, Chapter 8 of the GAM, Volume I provides that “Tangible items below 
the capitalization threshold of P15,000 shall be accounted as semi-expendable property.” 

 



45 
 

31. Section 3, Chapter 10 of the GAM, Volume I, provides the criteria for recognition 
of the PPE, which states that the cost of an item of PPE shall be recognized as assets if, and 

only if: 

 

a. it is probable that the future economic benefits or service potential associated 
with the item will flow to the entity; 

b. the cost or fair value of the item can be measured reliably; 
c. beneficial ownership and control clearly rest with the government; 
d. the asset is used to achieve government objectives; and 
e. it meets the capitalization threshold of P15,000.00. 
 

32. Further, Section 4 of the same Chapter provides the application of the capitalization 
threshold of P15,000.00. It states that “The capitalization threshold of P15,000.00 

represents the minimum cost of an individual asset recognized as a PPE on the Statement 

of Financial Position. 

 

a. Xxx 
b. This threshold shall be applied on an individual asset or per item basis. Each 

item within the bulk acquisition with aggregate or total value of PPE, such as 

library books, computer peripherals and small items of equipment, will need to 

meet the capitalization threshold to be recognized as PPE.” 

 

33. Review of the PPE accounts as at December 31, 2020 showed that balances 
between the Accounting Unit and the Property and Supply Unit are reconciled, except for 

the following accounts:

33. The amounts reflected in the Accounting records were the running balances in the 

General Ledger (GL) of the PPE accounts, while the property cards were the same with 

the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE).  

 

34.  The tempered glass main entrance door, amounting to P49,300.00, was installed on 

May 8, 2019, in the rented Maginhawa Office and was recorded as Repairs and 

Maintenance-Leased Assets Improvements account by the Accounting Unit, while in the 

Property and Supply Unit (PSU),  it was included in the Other Structures account instead 

of Leased Assets Improvements, Building account. This observation is part of our 

previously issued Audit Observation Memorandum (AOM) No. 2020-005 (2019), whereby 

the account classification noted therein was not adjusted during the year. 

 

34. For CY 2020, the PSU reclassified the PPE from Other Structures to Leased Assets 
Improvements to correct the classification of the PPE. However, for the Accounting Unit, 

the reclassification of the PPE was not done due to the occurrence of an error in the 

eNGAS. The error was communicated to the eNGAS committee through the E-ticketing 

system. Instructions were given to solve the error but still it was not resolved yet. The last 

action taken was to attach the database; however, after attaching the database, no feedback 

was received. 

 

35. Furthermore, the 50 pieces Customized Partition Screen with individual costing of 
P5,437.60 did not meet the capitalization threshold of P15,000.00, but was included in the 

Furniture and Fixtures account because it was taken up as a single unit by the Accountant 

instead of the Semi-expendable-Furniture and Fixtures and Books account. 

 

36. The inability of the Accounting Unit and the PSU to reconcile the differences 
between their respective records in the amount of P221,700.00 affected the accuracy of the 

account balances of the subject PPE accounts. 

 

37. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accounting Unit to: 
 

a. review and reconcile the PPE accounts, if these are recorded/classified in 
accordance with the GAM, Volume I; and

b. make the necessary adjustments on the accounts affected. 
 

38.  The Accountant has carefully reviewed the PPE transactions in the books of 
accounts in eNGAS, and made the necessary adjustments to reflect the correct balances of 

the affected PPE accounts as per JEV Nos. 2021-01-000069 and 2021-01-000070, both 

dated January 4, 2021.  Further, the Accountant committed to comply with the guidelines 

on the proper recognition/classification of PPE accounts as per the GAM. 

 

 b.2 Erroneous recording and recognition of Accounts Payables - P1,191,829.65 

 

39. The accuracy of the reported balance of Accounts Payables of P5,579,617.75 as 
at year-end is doubtful due to: (a) erroneous recording on the utilization of advance 

travel fare to PS-DBM; (b) recognition of payables for undelivered goods; (c) non-

reversion of unsupported and past due payables; and (d) existence of negative 

balances amounting to P872,260.14, P265,564.00, P125,199.15, P71,193.64, that 

resulted in the overstatement of Accounts Payable, Due from NGAs, Other MOOE 

accounts by P1,191,829.65, P872,260.14, P265,564.00, and the understatement of the 

Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) account by P54,005.51, respectively. 

 

40. Executive Order (EO) 109 dated June 10, 1999, as implemented by COA-DBM 
Joint Circular No. 99-06 dated November 13, 1999, which requires that all documented 

Accounts Payables (APs) which remained outstanding for more than two (2) years shall be 

reverted to the Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit), except on-going capital outlays projects. 

Likewise, all undocumented APs, regardless of the year they were incurred, shall 

immediately be reverted to Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit). 

 

41. Section 2, Chapter 6 of the GAM, Volume I states that:  “Accounts Payable refers 
to valid and legal obligations of NGAs/OUs, for which goods/services/projects have been 

delivered/rendered/completed and accepted, regardless of the year when these obligations 

were incurred.” 

 

42. As at December 31, 2020, the reported balance of the Accounts Payable account 
was P5,579,617.75. Review of the account showed that the Agency set up Accounts 

Payable for the advance payment of undelivered goods and the replenishment of funds for 

the general fare agreement (GFA) with the PS-DBM totaling P1,137,824.14, the details of 

which are shown in Table 6 below:

43. With regard to payment to PS-DBM, it is the practice of government agencies to 
pay in advance the goods and services offered by the agency by debiting Due from NGAs 

– PS-DBM and crediting the said account upon delivery of the goods or services. However, 

further review showed that the Accountant had inadvertently drawn JEV No. 2020-12-

001257 dated December 31, 2020, to set up payables for various expenses amounting to 

P5,588,549.46, and which included therein the PS-DBM transactions amounting to 

P1,137,824.14. The entries made were a debit to Traveling Expenses - Local and Other 

MOOE accounts and a credit to Accounts Payable account. 

  

44. We also observed that unsupported payables which have been outstanding in the 
books for more than one (1) year and without actual claims totaling P125,199.15 were not 

reverted to the Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) as at year-end. Further analysis of the 

account and review of the Schedule of Accounts Payable revealed that there are also 

negative balances totaling P71,193.64, thus, affecting the reliability of the account. This 

also resulted in an overstatement of the Accounts Payable account and an understatement 

of Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) account by a net effect of P54,005.51, contrary to the 

above-mentioned accounting rules and regulations. 

 

45. The erroneous set-up of accounts payable for travel expenses charged to the 
advance payment for the GFA to PS-DBM, recognition of payable for undelivered goods, 

non-reversion of unsupported and past due payables, and the existence of negative balances 

resulted in the overstatement of Accounts Payable, Due from NGAs, and Other MOOE 

accounts by P1,191,829.65, P872,260.14, P265,564.00, respectively, and the 

understatement of Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) account by P54,005.51. 

 

46. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to:  
 

a. prepare JEV to correct the erroneous recording of travel expenses 
charged to advance payments for the GFA to PS-DBM, and the 

recognition of accounts payable for undelivered goods; 

 

b. determine the legality and validity of recorded obligations to warrant 
payment thereof, and make necessary adjustments/reversion for those 

long outstanding accounts without existing valid claims to reflect the 

correct balance of the affected accounts; and 
 

c. analyze index payment of suppliers/payees with negative balances and 
prepare the necessary adjustments, if warranted.  

 

47. Management commented that the Accountant committed to undertake the 
following:  

 

a. prepare JEV to correct the erroneous travel expenses charged to advance 
payments for the GFA to PS-DBM as well as recognition of accounts payable 

for undelivered goods and submit the JEV on or before April 30, 2021;  

 



49 
 

b. review the legality and validity of recorded obligations as at December 31, 
2020, make the necessary adjustments, and submit the JEVs on or before April 

30, 2021; and  

 

c. analyze the index of payment of supplier and/or payees, prepare necessary 
adjustments and submit JEVs on or before April 30, 2021.  

 

48. Further, the Accountant committed to ensure that similar errors in accounting 
entries will be avoided and will regularly review the balances of the Accounts Payable 

account to ensure that only valid and legal claims are recorded and immediately prepare 

adjusting entries, if needed.  

 

49. In summary, the total misstatements amounting to P28,918,445.21, P1,281,829.65 
and P27,779,150.58 represent 35.74 percent, 11.94 percent and 39.59 percent of the 

agency’s total Assets, Liabilities and Net Assets/Equity, respectively. Due to the significant 

impact of these misstatements on the financial statements, we rendered a Qualified 

Opinion on the financial statements of the JJWC as at year-end.  

 

Compliance Audit 

 

Delayed preparation and submission of BRSs 

 

50. Delayed preparation and submission of the Bank Reconciliation Statements 
ranging from 56 to 391 days precluded the timely verification and review of the 

correctness of both the bank and book records, which is not in conformity with 

Chapter 21 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I.   

 

51. Pertinent provisions in Chapter 21 of the GAM, Volume I provide, among others, 
the following:  

 

“Sec. 3. Objectives. The Bank Reconciliation Statement (BRS) shall be 

prepared in order to:  

a. check correctness of both the bank’s and agency’s/entity’s records,  

b. serve as a deterrent to fraud, and 

c. enable the agency/entity or bank to take up charges or credits 

recognized by the bank or agency/entity but not yet known to 

the agency/entity or bank.  

 

This shall be used in the reconciliation of bank and treasury accounts 

maintained with Government Servicing Bank (GSB).  

 

Sec. 4. Method of Bank Reconciliation. The monthly BRS shall be prepared 

by the Chief Accountant/designated staff for each of the bank accounts 

maintained by the agency/entity using the Adjusted Balance Method. Under 

this method, the book balance and the bank balance are brought to an 



50 
 

adjusted cash balance that must appear on the Statement of Financial 

Position.  

 

Sec. 5. Preparation of the Bank Reconciliation Statement. The Chief 

Accountant/Designated Staff shall within ten days from receipt of the 

monthly Bank Statement (BS) together with the paid checks, original copies 

of Debit Memoranda (DM)/Credit Memoranda (CM) from the GSB, 

reconcile the BS with the GL and prepare the BRS in four copies.  

 

Sec. 7. Reporting. The Chief Accountant shall submit the BRS within twenty 

days after receipt of the monthly BS to the following:  

 

Original – COA Auditor (with all the supporting documents and 

JEVs)  

Copy 2 – Head of Agency/Entity  

Copy 3 – Accounting Division/Unit file  

Copy 4 – Bank, if necessary” 

 

52. Section 122 of PD 1445 further provides that, “Submission of reports. Whenever 
deemed necessary in the exigencies of the service, the Commission may under regulations 

issued by it require the agency heads, chief accountants, budget officers, cashiers, 

disbursing officers, administrative or personnel officers, and other responsible officials of 

the various agencies to submit trial balances, physical inventory reports, current plantilla 

of personnel, and such other reports as may be necessary for the exercise of its functions” 

 

53. The Audit Team finds difficulty in reconciling the Cash in Bank accounts due to 
the delayed submission of the BRSs. The submitted BRSs of the agency’s bank accounts 

from January to December 2020, were delayed by 56 to 391 days, which are beyond the 

prescribed period required for their submission. Details are presented in Table 7 below:

54. We were informed that the staff in charge of the preparation of the BRS transferred 
to another government agency, thus, causing more delays in the submission of the BRSs. 

Management, however, explained that a new staff was hired lately to work on the BRSs. 

 

55. Reconciliation of accounts is an important tool to check the accuracy of the 
balances of the cash accounts appearing in the general ledgers. This will enable 

Management to pinpoint errors and promptly make corrections and/or adjustments when 

needed. 

 

56. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to:  
 

a. prepare BRSs for the agency’s bank accounts and submit the same to COA 
for further verification; and 

 

b. henceforth, follow the procedures of bank reconciliation and ensure timely 
submission of BRSs after receipt of the monthly bank statement, pursuant 

to Section 7, Chapter 21 of the GAM, Volume I, for early detection and 

correction of errors and deficiencies, to ensure correct balances of the 

Cash in bank accounts. 

 

57.        Management commented that the Accountant already prepared a request letter 
to LBP for the Bank Statements and/or snapshots of Cash in Bank - LCSA and of all JJWC 

accounts for the months of January 2020 to February 2021 and committed to prepare the 

same request letter every 5th day of the following month in order to meet the deadline of 

submission.   

 

Delayed liquidation of Fund Transfers 

 

58. The accuracy and reliability of Due from NGAs account are doubtful due to 
the non-conduct of regular reconciliation and monitoring of the account, and delayed 



52 
 

liquidation of fund transfers to DSWD-RJJWC Field Offices and IAs, contrary to 

COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994. 

 

59. Paragraph 4.6 of said Circular provides that within ten (10) days after the end of 
each month/end of the agreed period for the Project, the IA shall submit the Report of 

Checks Issued (RCI) and the Report of Disbursement (RD) to report the utilization of the 

funds.  Paragraph 4.9 thereof further states that the IA shall return to the SA any unused 

balance upon completion of the project, while Paragraph 5.4 provides that the SA shall 

require the IA to submit the reports and furnish the IA with a copy of the journal entry 

voucher taking up the expenditures. 

 

60. Analysis of the account Due from NGAs revealed that out of the P20,185,047.73 
prior years’ balance, only P16,872,312.64 was liquidated during the year, P115,311.05 was 

refunded to JJWC, and P1,526,674.62 was deposited directly to the National Treasury for 

a total of P18,514,298.31, leaving a balance of P1,670,749.42.   However, for the current 

year’s funds transfer totaling P17,881,794.00, no liquidation was made. Details are shown 

in Table 8 below:

*Incorrect recording of Fund Transfers and Liquidation Reports as discussed in Paragraph 19, Page 42 of 
this Report   
  

61. The delayed liquidation of fund transfers as at year-end resulted in the 
overstatement of Due from NGAs and affected Expenses accounts. 



53 
 

62. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to 
coordinate with the Accountants of the above-mentioned RJJWCs/IA’s on the submission 

of the liquidation documents as provided in COA Circular No. 94-013 and record 

immediately the expenses incurred upon receipt thereof. 

 

63. Management commented that the Accountant committed to coordinate with 
RJJWCs/IA’s on the submission of the liquidation documents through monthly monitoring 

of RJJWCs submitted liquidation reports and for DPWH, through coordination with the 

National Coordination, Monitoring and Information Management (NCMIM) Division. 

 

Delayed completion of the construction/improvement of two BPA Projects 

 

64. Delayed completion of the construction/improvement of the two (2) Bahay 
Pag-Asa (BPA) projects by the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) 

resulted in the non-attainment of the project objectives and depriving the intended 

beneficiaries of the expected benefits. 

 

65. Bahay Pag-Asa (BPA) is a 24-hour child-caring institution established, funded and 
managed by one (1) local government unit and two (2) DSWD licensed and/or accredited 

non-government institutions, providing short-term residential care for children in conflict 

of law (CICL) who are above 15 years old but below 18 years old, awaiting court 

disposition of their cases or transfer to other agencies or jurisdiction. It is a facility that also 

provides intensive intervention to CICL who have committed serious offense or have 

committed offense again for the second time or oftener but are exempt from criminal 

liability, as they are 15 years old and below. 

 

66. Section 63 of RA 9344, as amended under Section 13 of RA 10630 provides for the 
appropriation of P400 million for the construction of BPA rehabilitation centers in 

provinces or cities with a high incidence of CICL to be determined and identified by the 

DSWD and the JJWC on a priority basis, and shall be coursed through the DPWH for its 

proper implementation.  

 

67. Item B, No. 6 of the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between JJWC and 
DPWH states that Implementing Agencies (IAs) shall submit liquidation reports in 

accordance with the documentary requirements under 3.1.3 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 

dated June 14, 2012, as amended by COA Circular No. 2016-002 dated May 31, 2016, 

within 30 days after completion of the projects and activities under the Work and Financial 

Plan (WFP) or before the closing of the books of accounts at the end of the Fiscal Year, 

whichever comes first. 

 

68. In CYs 2016 and 2017, JJWC transferred to the DPWH the total amount of P40.05 
million, of which P1.50 million was for administrative costs and P38.55 million for the 

construction of eight (8) BPAs. The actual construction/improvement of the projects 

commenced at different periods from 2017 to 2019.  

 



54 
 

69. The National Coordination, Monitoring and Information Management Division 
(NCMIMD) is the division of the JJWC tasked to coordinate on the implementation of the 

juvenile intervention programs and activities.  Based on the Report of Publicized 

Government Project/Programs/Activities (GPPAs) and the Status Report of 

Implementation of BPA Projects as of December 31, 2020, as submitted by the NCMIMD, 

the BPA Projects in Cebu Province and Cagayan de Oro were not yet completed, thus, the 

objectives and expected benefits therefrom were not realized within the target period.

70. We were informed by the NCMIMD that the delay in the construction of the BPA 
Projects was due to the delayed signing of the MOA with the LGUs and the problem with 

the contractors, thus, the construction commenced only in 2017 and some started in 2018 

and 2019. 

 

71. Continuous coordination with the concerned LGUs and DPWH-District 
Engineering Offices (DPWH-DEOs) is being performed by the NCIMIMD to facilitate the 

immediate completion of the project and for the submission of the liquidation reports, but 

these have been their usual problem with DPWH.  

 

72. We recommended that Management require the NCMIMD to:  
 

a. make representations with the DPWH-Bureau of Construction to fast-
track the implementation of the infrastructure projects and to submit the 

liquidation reports for recording in the books of accounts; and 



55 
 

b. strengthen their coordination with the DPWH - Bureau of Construction 
for the completion of the remaining two (2) BPA projects to ensure that 

project objectives are accomplished within the specific project timeline so 

that the facilities can be utilized by children with CICL and enjoy the 

benefits that can be derived therefrom. 

 

73. Management commented that they have been making representations and 
coordination with the Bureau of Construction. However, it is the DPWH-DEOs that 

implemented the projects and as such, the Bureau’s response to the Management’s concern 

on delayed implementation has always been limited to written request for DEOs to fast 

track the project. Nonetheless, the JJWC committed to continue pursuing an even 

strengthened coordination not only with the Bureau but also with the DEOs. They will do 

it by conducting monthly follow-up meetings and letter requests. 

 

Other Compliance Issues 

 

Gender and Development (GAD) 

 

74. Non-submission of the CY 2020 GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) to the Philippine 
Commission on Women (PCW) resulted in the failure to secure PCW-endorsed CY 

2020 GPB, contrary to Section 31 of the General Appropriations Act for FY 2020 and 

the PCW-National Economic Development Authority-Department of Budget and 

Management (PCW-NEDA-DBM) Joint Circular No. 2012-001. 

  

75. Section 31 of Republic Act (RA) No. 11465, known as the General Appropriations 
Act for FY 2020, states that: 

 

Section 31. Programs and Projects Related to Gender and Development. 

All agencies of the government shall formulate a Gender and Development 

(GAD) Plan designed to address gender issues within their concerned 

sectors or mandate and implement the applicable provisions under R.A. No. 

9710 or the Magna Carta for Women, Convention on the Elimination of All 

Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the Beijing Platform for Action, 

the Philippine Plan for Gender-Responsive Development (1995-2025), and 

the Philippine Development Plan (2017-2022). 

 

The GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of the agencies, 

which shall be at least five percent (5%) of their budgets. Utilization of the 

GAD budget shall be evaluated based on the GAD performance indicators 

identified by said agencies. 

 

76. Further, pertinent provisions of the PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-
001 provide the following procedures to be undertaken, to wit: 

 

1. Section 6.1. “At least five percent (5%) of the total agency budget 
appropriations authorized under the annual GAA shall correspond to activities 



56 
 

supporting GAD plans and programs. The GAD budget shall be drawn from the 

agency’s Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE), Capital Outlay (CO), 

and Personal Services (PS). It is understood that the GAD budget does not constitute 

an additional budget over an agency’s total budget appropriations. 

 

2. Section 8.2. “The GAD Focal Point System (GFPS) of the agency shall 
review all submitted GPBs and as needed, provide comments or recommendations for 

revision. xxx…. The GFPS shall then submit the final GPBs and the corresponding 

GAD ARs to PCW for review and endorsement to DBM.” 

 

3. Section 8.5. “PCW shall acknowledge in writing receipt of the GPBs within 
two (2) working days. xxx… Upon receipt and acceptance of the revised GPBs, PCW 

shall endorse all revised GPBs and return these to the different line departments or 

central agencies for their submission to DBM.” 

 

4. Section 10.1. “Attached agencies, bureaus, regional offices, constituent 
units and all others concerned shall submit their GAD ARs to their central offices. The 

agency GFPS shall prepare the annual GAD AR based on the PCW-endorsed GPB or 

the GPB adjusted to the approved GAA following the form prescribed in Annex B. 

Activities completed until the end of the year may be included in the final GAD AR of 

agency submitted to PCW in January. 

 

5. Annex B. “…xxx Column 9: Actual Cost or Expenditure – This column 
shows the actual cost or expenditure in implementing the identified GAD activities of 

the previous GPB. To avoid double counting and attribution, the agency shall provide 

a breakdown of the expenditure if necessary.” 

 

77. Records showed that the JJWC failed to submit the GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) 
for CY 2020 resulting in its non-evaluation by the PCW and its non-endorsement to the 

Department of Budget and Management (DBM). 

 

78. The Budget Unit informed the Audit Team that on October 23, 2020, the GFPS was 
reconstituted and a new Focal Person was designated. The previous Focal Person, who 

attended the GAD Secretariat meeting with PCW and knew about the things discussed in 

the meeting already resigned in 2020 due to health reasons but failed to inform the other 

members of the GAD Focal Point System (GFPS) that the GPB for CY 2020 was not 

submitted.  The new Focal Person was advised by the PCW to just submit the GAD 

Accomplishment Report (AR), since it is too late to submit the GPB.  

   

79. The lack of review of the GPB by the PCW raised the issue on whether the priority 
gender issues identified by the JJWC through its programs and activities in the agency’s 

GAD Accomplishment Report were in accordance with the criteria and accordingly linked 

with the budget of the agency.  

 

80. We recommended and Management agreed to require the GAD Focal Point 
System to ensure submission of the GPB to the PCW for review and monitor the 



57 
 

return, either for revision/modification or as approved by the PCW for endorsement 

to the DBM. 

 

81. Management commented that the JJWC submitted its GPB for CY 2021 to the PCW 
on December 18, 2020, and the GPB was still under PCW review as of 31 March 2021.  

 

Non-utilization of at least five percent (5%) of the annual budget 

 

82. Non-utilization of at least five percent (5%) of the annual budget of the JJWC 
as reported in the GAD Accomplishment Report (AR) resulting in the failure to 

maximize the GAD allocated budget to be more responsive in addressing gender 

issues that was likewise provided in Section 31 of the GAA. 

 

83. For CY 2020, the JJWC has a total appropriation of P101,698,000 and it is required 
to allocate five percent (5%) of the annual budget equivalent to P5,084,900.  Review of the 

GAD AR for CY 2020 which was submitted to PCW on March 12, 2021, as prescribed 

under PCW Memorandum Circular No. 2020-01 showed that only P4,464,820.24 or 4.39 

percent of its CY 2020 total appropriation was utilized, which is not in accordance with 

Section 31 of the GAA. 

 

84. The non-utilization of at least five percent (5%) of the JJWC annual budget 
deprived the agency from activities that will address gender issues. 

 

85. We recommended and Management agreed to require the GAD Focal Point 
System to utilize at least five percent (5%) of its total budget for GAD plans and   

programs. 

 

86. Management commented that as per submitted JJWC-GPB to PCW, budget 
allocated for GAD plans and programs which include client-focused, organization-focused 

and attributed programs amounted to P9,128,041.32 or 7.29% of the total budget/GAA of 

JJWC for 2021 amounting to P125,272,000.00. Further, Management committed the 

monitoring of the implementation of the GAD activities and the compliance with the PCW 

guidelines to ensure gender mainstreaming in the agency. 

 

Senior Citizens (SCs) and Persons with Disabilities (PWDs) 

 

Senior Citizens and Differently-Abled Persons Program 

 

87.  Section 32 of the General Provisions of the General Appropriations Act (GAA) of 
FY 2020 requires that all agencies of the government shall formulate plans, programs and 

projects intended to address the concerns of senior citizens and persons with disability, 

insofar as it relates to their mandated functions, and integrate the same in their regular 

activities. 

 

88.     Moreover, all government infrastructures and facilities shall provide 
architectural features, designs or facilities that will reasonably enhance the mobility, safety 



58 
 

and welfare of persons with disability, pursuant to Batas Pambansa Blg. 34 and RA 7277, 

as amended. 

 

89. The JJWC, in harmony with Section 32 of the General Provisions of the GAA of 
FY 2020, Batas Pambansa Blg. 34 and RA 7277, as amended, complies with the 

regulations in the form of partnership with the National Council on Disability Affairs 

(NCDA). The agency conducted a Webinar on “Disability Inclusion in the Juvenile Justice 

and Welfare System: Strengthening Capacity in Handling Cases of Children with Disability 

in Conflict with the Law.” Participants include duty-bearers handling CICL with 

disabilities, parents of children with disabilities, youth/adult PWDs and Bahay Pag-asa 

clients. 

 

85.    The agency admitted that no other activities aside from the said Webinar were 

undertaken due to the pandemic. There were also a series of consultation meetings and 

coordination with the National Council on Disability Affairs (NCDA) to strengthen their 

partnership and to come up with projects that would help the persons with disability amidst 

the pandemic. 

 

90.  Likewise, the Agency’s rented building structure and facilities are also designed to 
enhance the mobility, safety and welfare of senior citizens and persons with disability. 

Ramps, parking space for PWDs and an elevator are provided. 

 

Compliance with Other Mandatory Accounts 

 

91. For CY 2020, the Agency has faithfully deducted from the salaries of its personnel 
the required taxes, premiums and loan installments, and remitted the same as well as the 

government share therefor within the prescribed period to the concerned institutions or 

agencies, except for the collected/withheld taxes, as summarized in Table 10.

Pag-IBIG contributions and loans collected/withheld amounted to 
P1,516,306.10, including the beginning balance of P4,464.17 with a 
corresponding remittance of P1,380,080.73 within the prescribed 
period and refunds of P130,450.08Z leaving a balance of P5,775.29.  

 

92. Verification of the Schedule of the Due to BIR account showed that in January 
2020, there was an over-remittance of taxes withheld for December 2019 totaling 

P30,775.55.   Likewise, there were no tax remittances made for the period February to 

December 2020, contrary to BIR Revenue Regulation No. 2-98 dated April 17, 1998 as 

amended by BIR Revenue Regulation No. 6-2001 dated July 31, 2001. 

 

93. The Accounting Unit informed us that they already remitted the withholding taxes 
collected in CY 2020 and committed to reconcile and update their records this CY 2021.  

 

94. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to:  
 

a. review and reconcile their records for Due to BIR, GSIS and Pag-IBIG 
accounts and make necessary adjustments based on the results of review;  

 

b. remit immediately the unremitted balances of  CY 2020 taxes and 
premiums, if there is any; and 

 

c. henceforth, strictly comply with the rules and regulations of the BIR, GSIS 
and Pag-IBIG to ensure full benefits of JJWC employees and to protect 

the interest of GSIS Social Insurance Fund, BIR and Pag-IBIG.   
 

95. Management commented that the Accountant committed to reconcile their records 
for Due to BIR account and make adjusting entries, if necessary, and submit JEVs to COA 

on or before June 30, 2021. According to them, as per record for the year 2019-2020, 

there are no unremitted taxes and/or delayed remittance of taxes as this will incur penalty 

from the BIR; hence, the Due to BIR account should have zero balance. The outstanding 

balance in the Due to BIR account maybe due to errors in the preparation of the journal 

entries. The Accountant has been compliant with the Executive Order, BIR Revenue 

Regulations, and other Circulars related to remittance of taxes. Moreover, to ensure 

correctness of the reported balance, the Accountant committed to do the regular monthly 

reconciliation and analysis of the Due to BIR account. 

 

96.  With regard to GSIS, Management informed us that the Accounting Unit, in 
coordination with the Personnel Unit, committed to conduct reconciliation and review of 

the propriety of Due to GSIS account, make adjusting entries, if necessary, and submit 

JEVs to COA on or before June 30, 2021.  They also informed us that as per records for 

the years 2019-2020, there was no unremitted contributions, as all Disbursement 

Vouchers for payment to GSIS from the Personnel Unit were already processed by the 



60 
 

Accounting Unit, hence, the reconciliation to be done will verify if there were errors in 

the preparation of journal entries or unremitted contributions. In case of unremitted 

contributions, the Personnel Unit committed to prepare immediately the Disbursement 

Vouchers and other supporting documents for payment to GSIS. 

 

97.  The Accounting and Personnel Units have been compliant with the mandated 
period on the remittance of monthly premium contributions and other amounts due to 

GSIS. To ensure the correctness of the reported balance of Due to GSIS account, the 

Accounting Unit committed to conduct a regular monthly analysis for preparation of 

adjustments, if necessary and provide the Personnel Unit with the account balance for 

further verification, which may need the preparation of documents for payment to GSIS. 

 

Hiring and Payment of Contractual/Contract of Service Workers 

 

98. In CY 2020, the Agency hired 30 contractual or Contract of Service (COS) workers 

representing an equivalent of 45 percent of the 67 regular plantilla employees to provide 

administrative assistance. The payments for said Contract of Service workers were 

charged against the MOOE and UNICEF funds amounting to P7,367,160.00 and 

P599,310.00, respectively.
