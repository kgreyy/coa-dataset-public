OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS





Financial and Compliance



Doubtful accuracy of the PPE account balance due to unreconciled discrepancies totaling P57,014,072.07 and non-submission of RPCPPE by Alangalang, Tolosa and Villaba Campuses 



1)			The accuracy, reliability and existence of the Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) account of the Visayas State University (VSU) reported at P1,031,371,103.73 as of December 31, 2020 are doubtful due to: (a) the unreconciled discrepancies in the balances (1) between the CY 2020 Schedule of PPEs and the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) of the Main Campus, amounting to P46,598,848.84; and (2) between the Schedule of PPEs of the Main Campus and the Trial Balance/Subsidiary Ledger (SL) of External Campuses, totaling P10,415,223.23; and (b) the non-submission of the RPCPPE by the Alangalang, Tolosa and Villaba Campuses of VSU, thus affecting the fair presentation of the account in the financial statements.



	1)		The pertinent provisions of the Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 are as follows:



Section 77. Invoice and receipt upon transfer of funds or property. When government funds or property are transferred from one accountable officer to another, or from an outgoing officer to his successor, it shall be done upon properly itemized invoice and receipt which shall invariably support the clearance to be issued to the relieved or out-going officer, subject to regulations of the Commission.



Section 78. Disposition of funds or property held by deceased, incapacitated, absconding, or superseded accountable officer.



1)	When an officer accountable for government funds or property absconds with them, dies, or becomes incapacitated in the performance of his duties, the proper agency head shall designate a custodian to take charge of the funds or property until a successor shall have been appointed and qualified.  The agency head may appoint a committee to count the cash and take an inventory of the property for which the officer was accountable and to determine the responsibility for any shortage therein.  One copy of the inventory and of the report of the Committee duly certified shall be filed with the Commission but the findings of the committee shall not be conclusive until approved by the Commission or its duly authorized representative.

	2.	The highest standard of honesty, objectivity and consistency shall be observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate or misleading information.



	2)		Paragraph 29 (b) of the Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standards (PPSAS) No. I states:

X x x



Sec. 38. Physical Count of PPE.  The entity shall have a periodic physical count of PPE, which shall be done annually and presented on the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) (Appendix 71) as at December 31 of each year.   This shall be submitted to the Auditor concerned not later than January 31 of the following year. Equipment found at station and losses discovered during the physical count shall be reported to the Accounting Division/Unit for proper accounting/recording.



	4)		The total book value of the PPE items of VSU as of December 31, 2020 is P1,031,371,103.73, detailed as follows:

	5)	Audit of the PPE account disclosed the following deficiencies:



a)	Unreconciled discrepancy in balances between the following records:



1)	The schedule of PPEs and the RPCPPE of the Main Campus amounting to P46,598,848.84



	6)	Interview with the Accounting personnel revealed that the Main Campus does not maintain separate SL for each type of asset to support the general ledger (GL) balance of the PPE account.  Rather, schedules are prepared for each type of asset, and a comparison between these schedules and their CY 2020 RPCPPE disclosed a discrepancy of P46,598,848.84 as presented below:

	7)	Verification of these balances disclosed that the Property Office erroneously recorded the land improvements amounting to P16,001,330.95 as Land Improvements, Aquaculture Structures Account instead of Other Land Improvements Account (10602990).



	8)	According to the personnel assigned at the Property Office, they submitted a list of items for adjustment which has already been submitted to the Accounting Office, but this is still for verification.



	9)	The rules under property management require that after the physical inventory-taking, the Inventory Committee reconciles the results of their count with the property and the accounting records.  All noted discrepancies between the inventories per books and the physical count must be investigated and reconciled immediately.  Where necessary, a written explanation is required from the accountable person(s) concerned.



	10)	Review of the RPCPPE also disclosed that some equipment are recorded in the names of employees who are no longer connected with VSU.  Validation of the names in the RPCPPE and the Summary of Property Acknowledgement Receipt (PAR) prepared by the Property Office revealed that equipment amounting to P4,713,779.06 are still recorded under the name of the employees who have already left VSU as shown below:

	11)	The table above shows that P4,278,451.06 worth of equipment owned by VSU are still in the name of the Board Secretary who has separated from the service in October 2019.



	12)	The Property Office then informed the Audit Team that the inventory of the properties of employees who have already been separated from the service is still on going.



	13)	This observation illustrates breakdown in controls over property management and that government properties are adequately safeguarded and properly accounted for is not ensured.



2)	The schedule of PPEs of the Main Campus and the Trial Balance/SL of External Campuses amounting to P10,415,223.23



	14)	Comparative analysis of the reported balances between the records of the Main Campus and the External Campuses revealed a variance amounting to P10,415,223.23, as shown below:

	15)	During the audit, it was noted that for some items in the schedules prepared by the Main Campus, only the amount of the total balance for the external campuses was provided with no itemized breakdown indicated for each external campus.



b)	non-submission by the VSU Alangalang, Tolosa and Villaba Campuses of the RPCPPE 



	16)	Records show that the Alangalang, Tolosa and Villaba Campuses did not submit the year-end RPCPPE so the Audit Team has found it difficult to check on the integrity of property custodianship and to validate the accuracy of the book balance.



	17)	In view of these deficiencies, the balances of the PPE account are of doubtful accuracy, reliability and existence, thus affecting its fair presentation in the financial statements.



	18)	We recommended that the President:



a)	require the Accountant and the Property Officer of the Main Campus to reconcile their records to correct the noted deficiency of P46,598,848.84;



b)	require the Accountants of the Main Campus and the External Campuses to reconcile their records and identify causes of the noted discrepancy of P10,415,223.23 and to make the necessary adjustments to come up with accurate account balances;



c)	direct the Property Officer of the Main Campus to facilitate the transfer of properties that are still under the names of employees who have already separated from service in order to establish accountability and custodianship;



d)	direct the Inventory Committee of the Alangalang, Tolosa and Villaba Campuses to prepare and submit the required annual RPCPPE within the reglementary period pursuant to Section 38, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume 1.



	19)	The Head of Supply and Property Management Office (SPMO), in her written reply, explained that the assigned personnel admitted to have erroneously recorded the land improvements amounting to P16,001,330.95 as Land Improvements, Aquaculture Structures instead of Other Land Improvements Account.  To correct the error, the Property Office modified the RPCPPE by transferring the entry from Land Improvements, Aquaculture Structures to Other Land Improvements.



	20)	The Head of the SPMO informed that they had already conducted the physical count/inventory prioritizing those who have retired/resigned from service that are not cleared yet of their VSU property accountabilities. 



	21)	The Accountant of Main Campus informed that some PPE’s remain unrecorded since they need to verify the data given by Property Office before taking up the adjustments.  Likewise, some disposed PPEs were not also recorded in the books due to lack/absence of supporting documents.  



	22)	She informed that they will record reclassification of accounts in the amount of P6,290,444.32 in May 2021 Trial Balance. Also, the quarterly reconciliation of accounts by Accounting and Property Offices have already started in the last quarter of CY 2020. 



	23)	On the discrepancy between the Schedule of PPE’s of Main Campus and Trial Balance/ Subsidiary Ledger of External Campuses, she explained that last 2019 a regular reconciliation of Main and External Campuses was made, however, due to the duration and the number of accounts to review, it was not completed. The Bookkeeper/Accountant of External Campuses was not able to report to the Main Campus for the year 2020 for reconciliation purposes due to COVID 19 pandemic.



	24)	The Accountant commits that they will give their best to finish the reconciliation on or before December 31, 2021.



	25)	The Accountant of Isabel Campus explained that the reconciliation of PPE accounts have started before the time of the pandemic and the best efforts were exerted in reconciling each account of PPE of all fund clusters.  On the reported variances between the Schedule of PPEs of the Main Campus and Trial Balance, she believes that it can be answered best by the VSU Main Accounting Office since Isabel Campus doesn’t have the exact amount of discrepancy per Component College however, once the variances are verified, adjusting entries will be made to prevent the same observation next audit period.



	26)	The Accountant and Supply Officer of Tolosa Campus in their written reply stated that they will do their best to comply with the recommendations. Extra attention will be given to the records of the Property, Plant and Equipment  to address the discrepancies so that tracing can be done and the necessary entries be made to reconcile the records once the pertinent documents are collected for basis of the entries.



	27)	On the non-submission of the RPCPPE, they explained that the Supply and Property Management Office who prepares and maintains the RPCPPE is also tasked to facilitate the procurement activities of the Tolosa Campus. They also added that one of the factors that have contributed to the delay was the lack of manpower. Accordingly, a draft of the RPCPPE have been prepared subject for review before submission.





	Cash in Bank – Local Currency account of doubtful accuracy, reliability and existence due to unreconciled discrepancies totaling P91,366,171.69



2)	The accuracy, reliability and existence of the year-end balances of Cash in Bank – Local Currency, Current Account of P699,763,842.29, and the Cash in Bank – Local Currency, Savings Account of P1,384,510.29 were doubtful due to: (a) the unrecorded reconciling items totaling P60,972,024.53; (b) the unreconciled discrepancies between the records of the Main Campus and of the External Campuses amounting to P29,894,064.53; and (c) the failure of the Tolosa Campus to revert unreleased commercial checks as of yearend totaling P500,082.63, all contrary to the pertinent provisions of the GAM for NGAs, Volume 1, thus affecting their fair presentation in the financial statements.

a)	Unrecorded reconciling items totaling P60,972,024.53



	4)	Verification of the Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS) disclosed various reconciling items totaling P60,972,024.53 that have remained unadjusted/unrecorded in the books, thus understating the Cash in Bank-Local Currency, Current Account, as shown below:

	5)	The Accountant of the Main Campus explained that the discrepancies were due to the absence of copies of debit/credit memos and other supporting documents, which should have been obtained from the bank.  The lack of these documents has hindered the Accountant from recording these reconciling items.



	6)	The substantial amount of unrecorded credit memos for online deposits, and unrecorded deposits for walk-in clients was not immediately identified and recorded in the books due to several problems: the difficulty in determining the nature of the transaction and in retrieving the related source documents to support the transactions; and the unknown identity of the depositor/payor.  Unless corrective viable measures are undertaken to recognize in the books the reported reconciling items, the Cash in Bank– Local Currency, Current Account balance will remain misstated and therefore will not be fairly presented in the financial statements.



b)	Unreconciled discrepancies between the records of the Main Campus and of the External Campuses by P29,894,064.53



	7)	Comparison of the balances between the Main Campus and those of the External Campuses revealed an unreconciled discrepancy of P29,894,064.53 as of December 31, 2020, as shown in Table 7.

	8)	During the audit, it was noted that the Main Campus still maintains the Philippine Postal Savings Bank (PPSB) Local Currency, Savings Account balances of the Tolosa Campus amounting to P1,384,510.29 although the bank account was already closed last October 2019 per BOR Resolution No. 87, s. 2019, dated July 12, 2019.  This error overstates the Cash in Bank-Local Currency, Savings Account.



	9)	Further, except for LBP Account No. 00182-1203-24 for FC 05 IGF, the Accountant of Tolosa Campus failed to submit the SLs for other bank accounts, hence, the Audit Team was not able to validate the correctness of their balances.  Likewise, the bank reconciliation statements for LBP Account No. 0182-1114-06 for FC 07-SBO have not been submitted yet as of this writing.



c)	Failure of the Tolosa Campus to revert unreleased commercial checks as of year end totaling P500,082.63



	10)	The CY 2020 unreleased commercial checks of the Tolosa Campus totaling P500,082.63 were not reverted back to the Cash in Bank- Local Currency, Current Account, in view of the non-submission by the Disbursing Officer of the required List/Schedule of Unreleased Commercial Checks to the Accounting Office, contrary to the above-cited Section 56, Chapter 19 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I.  The breakdown is presented in Table 8.

	11)	Unless and until the reconciling items are adjusted and recorded, and the discrepancies investigated, and the necessary corrections/adjustments made, the balance of the Cash in Bank-Local Currency accounts cannot be fairly presented in the financial statements.



	12)	These observations were embodied in the previous years’ Annual Audit Reports and are hereby reiterated since Management failed to implement the audit recommendations.



	13)	We recommended that the President require the Accountant from the different campuses concerned to:



a)	look into the details and source documents of the reported reconciling items which resulted in the net understatement of P60,972,024.53 for proper recording in the books.  If documentary evidence to establish the authenticity of these transactions cannot be obtained, the same should be reverted to the National Treasury;



b)	examine the causes of the unreconciled discrepancies in the balances of the records between the Main Campus and the External Campuses amounting to P29,894,064.53, and effect the necessary adjusting entries to reflect the accurate balances for their fair presentation in the financial statements

	

	14)	We further recommended that the President require the Accountant of the Tolosa Campus to:

	

a)		prepare and update the SL of each bank account on a monthly basis to readily facilitate the preparation of the monthly BRS;

	

b)		prepare and submit to the Audit Team the BRS of LBP Account  No. 0182-1114-06 for FC 07 SBO; and

	

	

c)		draw a Journal Entry Voucher (JEV) for the:



1)	restoration of the cash equivalent of the unreleased checks as of year end per list from the Disbursing Officer with the appropriate liability/payable account; and



2)	reversion, at the start of the ensuing year, of the previous entry made to recognize the availability of the checks for release.



	15)		The Main Accountant commented that some reconciling items were recorded in the books totaling P3,097,568.26 from January to March 2021. The non-recording of some reconciling items was due to lack of documentary evidence. She further commented that they always requested copies of debit/credit memos from the bank memos but to no avail.

	

	16)		Moreover, she stated that for the CY 2019, regular reconciliation of Main and External Campuses were made however due to the pandemic in CY 2020 bookkeepers/accountants of External Campuses were not able to report to the Main Campus for reconciliation purposes hence not all Cash in Bank accounts were reconciled.  As of May 2021, only FC 01- RAF remained unreconciled with External Campuses except for Tolosa Campus accounts.



	17)		Alangalang Campus commented that their records show that their Cash in Bank (LCCA) accounts for Regular Fund is reconciled with LBP as evident with their BRS as of Dec. 31, 2020, otherwise, their adjusted book balance will not reconcile with that of the bank balance if the discrepancy is on their end.



	18)		Tolosa Campus Accountant commented that the net amount of P4,565.18 representing the interest income and tax withheld by the bankwas unrecorded due to unavailability of the documents. 



	19)		For the unreconciled discrepancies between the records of Main and Tolosa Campuses, they will first reconcile their own records within their campus and then refer to the records of the Main Campus for reconciliation upon the availability of data.



	20)		She also commented that the BRS for SBO will be submitted immediately after it is updated up to the latest bank statement.  The non-submission was due to inadvertence since there have been no transactions under the said fund.



	21)		For the non-reversion of unreleased checks as of year end, she commented that the disbursing offer has submitted to her the list of the unreleased check.  It was only due to inadvertence that the reversion was not made.  Further, she was not informed at that time that cash accounts were to be reverted for unreleased checks as of year end, however she assured the Audit Team that they will do whatever is necessary and feasible to comply with all other recommendations.



	22)		As a rejoinder to the comment of Alangalang Campus, the audit finding was about the unreconciled balance between the Main Campus and of the Alangalang Campus for Regular Fund and not of unreconciled balances between the BRS and book balance of the Alangalang Campus.  It should be noted that the balances reflected in the financial statements are based on the records maintained by the Main Campus and if the records of Main Campus are not reconciled with of the External Campuses, the accuracy of the account balances in the FS would be doubtful.





Due to NGAs account balance not fairly presented due to existence of unexpended and negative balances, unsupported non-moving accounts and unreconciled discrepancy totaling P39,222,630.49



3)	The reliability of the Due to National Government Agencies (NGAs) year-end balance reported at P170,005,623.67 was doubtful due to the following deficiencies: (a) the existence of the unexpended balances for projects and of the abnormal/negative balances aggregating P23,912,247.07 and P271,515.78, respectively; (b) the unsupported non-moving Administrative Cost/Research and Extension (RandE) accounts totaling P4,966,373.32; and (c) the discrepancy in balances between the SL of the Main Campus and of the External Campuses amounting to P10,072,494.32, contrary to COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 and Section 111 of PD No. 1445, thereby affecting the fair presentation of the account in the financial statements and depriving the government of additional resources for its priority programs, projects and activities.

	

	1)	Section 111 of PD No. 1445 provides:



Section 111. Keeping of accounts.



1. The accounts of an agency shall be kept in such detail as is necessary to meet the needs of the agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or control agencies of the government.



2. The highest standard of honesty, objectivity and consistency shall be observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate or misleading information.

	9)	In most of these projects enumerated in the table above, progress financial reports, except the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA), were submitted.  The absence of the MOA precluded the Audit Team to evaluate some projects whether they were already completed, still ongoing or not implemented.



	10)	This audit observation is a reiteration of the previous year’s audit observation however, no specific comment was received by the Audit Team to address the unutilized funds.

	

	11)	The Accounting Office may be incharge of recording and preparing the liquidation reports, but it is the responsibility of the Project Leader of each specific program/project to monitor the progress thereof and to submit to the Accounting Office accomplishment reports at any stage of the project, so that the latter can prepare the corresponding liquidation and/or terminal reports.



	12)	Likewise, review of the SLs also disclosed the presence of abnormal/negative balances in the Due to NGAs account for projects totaling P271,515.78, detailed as follows:

	13)	The occurrence of these negative balances is abnormal as these accounts are liability accounts and should normally report positive balances in the ledgers.  The Accounting Office is responsible to verify all entries it records in the books, and any negative balances should immediately be investigated so that proper adjustments can be effected to ensure the accurate presentation of financial data.



b)	Undocumented and dormant Administrative Costs/R&Eaccounts totaling P4,966,373.32



	14)	According to the University Accountant, they had difficulty in tracing and reconciling the details of the items enumerated in Table 12 below because these balances have been in existence and unutilized for several years now.  These government funds being idle is inconsistent with the government’s thrust of maximizing the use of scarce resources, and the provisions of COA Circular No. 2015-001 dated January 29, 2015 on the reversion to the General Fund of all dormant cash, unauthorized accounts, and unnecessary special and trust funds.  These undocumented and dormant balances which are recorded in the books are summarized below:

	15)	Inasmuch as the Accounting Office can no longer trace the pertinent supporting documents to substantiate these dormant funds totaling P4,966,373.32, the full amount should then be returned to the Source Agency or reverted to the National Treasury, to enable the government to use these funds for other priority programs, projects and activities.



c)	Discrepancies noted in balances between the subsidiary records maintained by the Main Campus and the External campuses amounting to P10,072,494.32

 

	16)	During the year, the Audit Team compared the balances maintained by the Main Campus and those by the External Campuses.  FC 07-IATF showed an unreconciled discrepancy of P10,072,494.32, as shown in Table 13.

	17)	Under the fund, the VSU Tolosa Campus reported a substantial P9,861,726.32 difference between their records and those in the Main Campus while the Villaba Campus reported a discrepancy of P210,768.00.  Tolosa Campus failed to provide the SLs of the Due to NGAs account as of December 31, 2020 necessary for the reconciliation of the balances.  The lack of turnover of these documents from the previous personnel in charge has made it difficult for the new accountant to determine the accurate balances of the Due to NGAs account.



	18)	In view of these observations/deficiencies, the reported balance of the Due to NGAs account as of December 31, 2020 cannot be relied upon, thereby affecting the fair presentation of these accounts in the financial statements.



	19)	We recommended that the President: 



a)	Direct the Project Leaders to:



1)	provide the Audit Team with copies of the MOA of those projects under their supervision; 



2)	coordinate regularly with the Accounting Office for the timely preparation of semi-annual liquidation reports and terminal reports of their respective projects; and



3)	undertake the review and reconciliation with the Accounting Office regarding the status of implementation of their projects to determine whether these are included in the list of the projects with idle/unexpended balances, and to request the Accounting Office to process the return of their unexpended balances to the SA.









b)	Direct the Accountant to:



1)	require the Project Leaders to submit to their office notarized copies of the MOA of the projects as part of the liquidation documents;



2)	require the Project Leader assigned to projects with idle/unexpended balances to submit periodic reports to facilitate the assessment whether unexpended and unutilized funds  need to be returned to the Source Agency or be reverted to the General Fund;



3)	review accounting records to determine the causes of the negative balances totaling P271,515.78, and to prepare the necessary reconciling items for adjustments in the books in order to arrive at accurate balances;



4)	exert efforts at locating the supporting documents to substantiate and reconcile dormant amounts totaling P4,966,373.32 to determine the necessity of its existence; otherwise, revert the amount to the National Treasury; and



5)	examine the causes of the unreconciled discrepancies in the balances between the Main Campus and the External Campuses amounting to P10,072,494.32 and effect the necessary adjusting entries to reflect the accurate balances for fair presentation in the financial statements.



	20)	The Main Campus Accountant in her written reply commented that based on their review, some idle/unexpected balances were refunded to Source Agencies by January to April 2021 totaling P5,566,412.48, likewise, the negative balance in the amount of P271,515.78 was already adjusted in the books by January 2021.



	21)	She also commented that in CY 2019, regular reconciliation of Main and External Campuses was made.  In fact, only Tolosa and Villaba Campuses accounts remained unreconciled as at year-end.  With regard to Villaba Campus accounts in the amount of P210,768.00, an adjustment will be made in May 2021 Trial Balance based on the document submitted by the Villaba Campus bookkeeper.



	22)	Tolosa Campus Accountant stated in her written reply that one of the factors that caused difficulty in determining the accurate balances of the accounts is the lack of proper turn-over of documents.



	23)	The Trial Balances and GLs for Special Trust Fund, IGP, SO and General Fund have been updated from July 2019 up to the end of December 2020.  However, there were noticeable inaccuracies in the balances mostly for the General Fund where there are transactions affecting the Due to NGAs account.  Formal request for turn-over of the documents was already done.  However, these were not yet fully acted on.



	24)	Moreover, she commented that they will do whatever is necessary and feasible to update and reconcile the records to arrive to the accurate balance and comply with the recommendations





Inaccurate and unreliable Accounts Receivable balance due to unreconciled discrepancies totaling P13,036,088.00; unrecorded billings of school fees and collections totaling P24,490,618.00 and P8,155,070.85, respectively; and non-maintenance of separate bank account and SL



4)	The accuracy and reliability of the reported year-end Accounts Receivable account balance of P122,346,163.97 are doubtful due to: (a) unreconciled discrepancies between the billing to, and the settlement by, CHED-Unified Financial Assistance System for Tertiary Education Act (UniFAST) Tuition and Other School Fees (TOSF), totaling P13,036,088.00; (b) unrecorded TOSF billings/assessments, amounting to P21,089,814.00; and collections, amounting to P8,155,070.85, at the Tolosa Campus; c) unrecorded receivables of the VSU Laboratory High School (VLHS) and Senior High School (SHS) amounting to P1,379,512.00 and P2,021,292.00, respectively; d) non-maintenance of a separate bank account and Subsidiary Ledger (SL) for CHED-UniFAST account management, all contrary to Section 111 of PD No. 1445; pertinent provisions of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I; COA Circular Letter No. 2004-002; and the related MOA, thus affecting the fair presentation of the accounts in the financial statements.

	8)	Audit of the account disclosed the following deficiencies:



a)	Unreconciled discrepancies between the billing to, and the settlement by, CHED-Unified Financial Assistance System for Tertiary Education Act (UniFAST) Tuition and Other School Fees (TOSF), totaling P13,036,088.00



	9)	Republic Act (RA) No. 10931, also known as the “Universal Access to Quality Tertiary Education Act of 2017,” aims at promoting universal access to quality tertiary education by providing free tuition and other school fees in State Universities and Colleges, Local Universities and Colleges, and State-Run Technical-Vocational Institutions, establishing the Tertiary Education Subsidy and Student Loan Program, and strengthening the Unified Student Financial Assistance System for Tertiary Education.



	10)	In relation to this, RA No. 10687, also known as the Unified Student Financial Assistance for Tertiary Education Act (UniFAST), was signed into law on October 15, 2015 to implement, reconcile, improve, strengthen, expand, and put under one body all government-funded modalities of Student Financial Assistance Programs (StuFAPs) for tertiary education and special purpose education assistance in both public and private institutions.  The UniFAST law and its Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) aims to make the implementation of StuFAPs in the tertiary level more effective, efficient, and politically-neutral or free of political labelling.  UniFAST issued Memorandum Circular No. 2018-002 providing the guidelines on Free Higher Education (FHE) in Philippine SUCs and CHED-Recognized LUCs for the method of disbursements, namely: a) fund transfers with the initial 50 percent fund transfer based on the computed budget ceiling (subject to liquidation), and the introduction of the b) billing statement wherein the tuition and other school fees of actual qualified students in SUCs/CHED-Recognized LUCs will be billed to CHED-UniFAST for settlement.  Under the program, VSU adopted the second option.



	11)	Audit of the receivable account revealed an unsettled balances of the tuition fees and other school fees (TOSF) for Academic Year (AY) 2018-2019 up to AY 2019-2020.  The unsettled balance of P13,036,088.00 is itemized as follows:

	12)	Interview with the UniFAST focal person revealed that VSU provided to CHED-UniFAST the requested Certification on TOSF approved by the Board of Regents in compliance with the latter’s letter dated July 17, 2019 for it to check the completeness and accuracy of the former’s billing statements for 1st and 2nd Semesters, AY 2018-2019.  After a thorough review, the CHED-UniFAST informed VSU that the amount in the billing statements exceeded the certified amount of TOSF.  As evidenced by the tabulation above, inconsistencies were still noted in the next semesters of AY 2019-2020, thus causing the accumulation of the claims disallowed by CHED of P13,036,088.00.



	13)	These discrepancies have raised doubt as to the efficiency of the billing procedures, and the assessment of the student’s TOSF.  Had there been proper coordination between the billing unit and assessment unit, errors could have been avoided.



b)	Unrecorded TOSF billings/assessments, amounting to P21,089,814.00; and collections, amounting to P8,155,070.85, at the Tolosa Campus



	14)	Verification of the account also disclosed that the TOSF billings/assessments for 2nd Sem., AY 2019-2020 and 1st Sem., AY 2020-2021 of the Tolosa Campus totaling P21,089,814.00 were not recorded in the books, and subsequent collections amounting to P8,155,070.85 were not likewise recorded as at year end, as presented below:

	15)	Upon interview, the Accountant of the Tolosa Campus reasoned out that there were no supporting documents forwarded to her with regard to the foregoing transactions, and that she was not informed of the same.  This omission understates the above accounts.



c)	Unrecorded receivables of the VSU Laboratory High School (VLHS) and Senior High School (SHS) amounting to P1,379,512.00 and P2,021,292.00, respectively



	16)	During the audit, it was also noted that for AY 2020-2021 assessments totaling P1,379,512.00 have remained unrecorded in the books at year end; however, collections totaling P276,478.00 were credited to the Accounts Receivable.  The details are as follows:

	18)	In accordance with the MOA, the VSU-SHS sent to the Department of Education (DepEd) the related billing statement dated December 11, 2020 amounting to P2,021,292.00, which however remained unrecorded in the books as of year end, as shown below:

	19)	Upon interview, the Bookkeeper of the VSU Main Campus explained that the assessment/billing statement was not forwarded to the accounting office for recording.



d)	Non-maintenance of a separate bank account and an SL for CHED-UniFAST account management



	20)	The MOA entered into by VSU with CHED and UniFAST on June 13, 2018 requires VSU to maintain a separate bank account for the proper account management of the FHE, Tertiary Education Subsidy and Student Loan Program.  However, to this date, no separate bank account is maintained for this purpose.



	21)	Likewise, the examination of the accounting records showed that the receivables from CHED are recorded in one and the same SL with other students not covered under the FHE program, thereby rendering it difficult for the Audit Team to ascertain the balances of those students under the FHE program.



	22)	As the Audit Team emphasizes, the GAM for NGAs, Volume II, requires the maintenance of a separate SL for a more efficient monitoring of accounts.



	23)	With these deficiencies, the reported year-end balances of the Accounts Receivable and other affected accounts are of doubtful accuracy and reliability, thus affecting their fair presentation in the financial statements.



	24)	We recommended that the President require the Accountants of the Main and External Campuses to:



a)	review and trace the cause of the total discrepancy of P13,036,088.00 between the TOSF billed to, and settled by, CHED so that correcting entries can be made for reconciling items in order to arrive at an accurate accounts receivable balance.



b)	review thoroughly the billing statements prepared by the UniFAST Focal Person with reference to the BOR approved Certification of TOSF before forwarding the same to CHED-UniFAST for settlement to avoid the incurrence of deficiencies and inconsistencies in the future.



c)	maintain a separate bank account and a separate SL for proper account management of the FHE, TES and SLP as required in the MOA dated June 13, 2018, and the GAM for NGAs, Volume II, so as to readily provide periodic balances and to efficiently monitor the accounts.



	25)	We also recommended that the President require the Accountant of the Tolosa Campus to:



a)	prepare the correcting entries for the noted deficiencies to be presented as follows:

a)	unrecorded billings/ assessment sent to CHED of P21,089,814.00

b)	submit the corresponding JEV/s to the Main Campus for proper recording in the books and to record revenues during the period when they are realized under the accrual basis of accounting pursuant to Section 2 (a), Chapter 2 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I.



	26)	Finally, we recommended that the President instruct the VLHS and SHS Billing/Assessment in charge:



a)	to submit the billing/assessment statements of VLHS and SHS amounting to P1,379,512.00 and P2,021,292.00, respectively, to the Accounting Office for proper recording in the books of accounts; and henceforth, submit the same regularly and on time for the subsequent academic years to ensure accuracy of reported financial data in accordance with COA Circular Letter No. 2004-002 and Section 2 (a), Chapter 2 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I.



	27)	The Main Campus commented that the recommendations will be taken and correcting entries will be made in May 2021.  The Accountant reasoned that the unrecorded receivable of SHS in the amount of P2,021,292.00 was recorded per JEV # 05-2021-03-0058 dated March 2021.  She further stated that the VLHS did not submit the assessment to the Accounting Office as of this writing for recording purposes of the receivable and that once they receive the assessment it will be recorded immediately.



	28)	The Head of VLHS and SHS reasoned that ever since the VSUIHS did not submit a list/summary of assessment statements every school year to the Cashier Office and were not asked to do so.  And based on the given recommendation, VSU will adapt a new scheme regarding the assessment statement of students’ fees.  Also, they will submit billing and assessment statements every AY to the Accounting Office for the proper recording in the books of accounts.  She assured that the office will submit the same documents regularly and on time for subsequent AYs to ensure accuracy of reported financial data following COA Circular Letter No. 004-002 and Section 2(a), Chapter 2 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I.



	29)	The Accountant of Isabel Campus commented that the unsettled balance of the tuition fees and other school fees for AY 2017-2018 up to 2019-2020 in Isabel Campus is P1,314,321.  As per recommendation, they are now maintaining a separate SL for the receivable accounts under the FHE Program.  However, as to the maintenance of a separate bank account for the CHED-UniFAST and the correcting entries of unsettled balance, they will abide with the directives of the Main Campus.



	30)	The Accountant of Tolosa Campus assured the Audit Team that they will do their best to comply with the recommendation.  She will coordinate with the TES Focal Person in the Main Campus to reconcile with the noted discrepancies and to coordinate with the in-charge of the billings for a thorough review by the Accounting Office of the billings before submission for settlement.  They further promised to maintain a separate SL for the Free Higher Education, TES and SLP.  She submitted correcting entries to record the unrecorded billings and collections of the TOSF.



	31)	The Accountant of Alangalang Campus commented that the settlement of the receivables from CHED is under the directives of the Main Campus, thus the Focal Person of Main Campus has the knowledge and better position to answer the same.





	Unreliability of Accounts Payable balance due to unrecorded payables, P3,271,977.57; misclassified accounts, P915,875.03



5)	The reliability of the year end balances of Accounts Payable and Due to Officers and Employees accounts amounting to P20,239,759.82 and P27,554,012.33, respectively, is doubtful due to: (a) the existence of unrecorded payables for services rendered and goods delivered totaling P3,271,977.57; and (b) misclassification of accounts amounting to P915,875.03, contrary to pertinent provisions of COA and DBM Joint Circular No. 2013-1 dated March 15, 2013, DBM Circular No. 2013-16 dated December 23, 2013 and the GAM for NGAs, Volumes I and II, thus affecting the fair presentation of the accounts in the financial statements.



	1)	Section 111 of  PD No. 1445 states that:



Section 111. Keeping of accounts.



1. The accounts of an agency shall be kept in such detail as is necessary to meet the needs of the agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or control agencies of the government.



2. The highest standard of honesty, objectivity and consistency shall be observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate or misleading information.

	8)	Audit disclosed that there were good and services which have been delivered rendered, and accepted by the various external campuses totaling P3,271,977.57 which remained unrecorded as of the year end (see Annex B).  Of the total, P1,222,306.58 should have been recorded under the Accounts Payable account, and P2,049,670.99 should have been recognized as payables under the Due to Officers and Employees account, summarized below:

	9)	The above transactions included the receipt of goods delivered in CY 2020 as evidenced by the signed Inspection and Acceptance Reports (IAR).  During the interview, the Accountants admitted that these goods were delivered to their respective campuses during the audit period.  The payables to various employees and officers’ account were also for services rendered in CY 2020.  The Accountants explained that the payables were not recorded due to inadvertence likewise, the supporting documents were still with the Main Campus where procurement activities for the external campuses are undertaken.



	10)	The Audit Team would like to reiterate that for goods and services which have been delivered and accepted, the accrual basis of accounting shall be used, and the same be recorded as Accounts Payable.



b)		Misclassification of accounts totaling P915,875.03



	11)	Examination of the schedule of the Due to Officers and Employees account showed the inclusion of payables of the VSU Main Campus that should not have been recorded under the account described as follows:

	12)	The employees’ PHIC and HDMF premium payments should have been classified under their respective inter-agency accounts, while payables for the payment of meals should have been recorded as Accounts Payable.



	13)	To reiterate, the Due to Officers and Employees account is used only to recognize the incurrence of liabilities that accrue to officers and employees for salaries, benefits and other emoluments including authorized expenses advanced by the officers and employees.



	14)	In view of these deficiencies, the validity and propriety of the reported year end balance of the Accounts Payable account cannot be relied upon, thereby affecting the fair presentation of the financial statements.



	15)	We recommended that the President require the Accountant to:



a)	record as payables those obligations which are already due and demandable as incurred with complete documentary requirements;



b)	prepare the necessary adjusting entries to correct the errors noted in the accounts, and to submit the pertinent JEV to the Audit Team for validation.



	16)	The Main Campus commented that the noted misclassification of accounts amounting to P915,873.03 was recorded per JEV No. 01-2021-03-114 dated March 2021. 



	17)	For Alangalang Campus, the Accountant submitted a list of Accounts Payable identified in AOM No. 2020-001 and the date it was paid. She also attached the JEV in recording the outstanding Accounts Payable at the time of the issuance of AOM.



	18)	For Isabel Campus, the management commented that the receipt of goods delivered and the services rendered in CY 2020 amounting to P505,412 and P775,026.16, respectively were not recorded as payables as of December 31, 2020 because of the lacking documentary requirements that should be attached to the claims.  Recommendations of this observation are well taken to ensure proper recording of obligations in the next transactions.



	19)	The Accountant of Tolosa Campus submitted a list of justification for the unrecorded payables stating that documents were not yet forwarded to the Accounting Office or inadvertently recorded as current year expense.  She further assured that monitoring of obligation will be made in order to properly record the payables within the required reporting periods.



	20)	As a rejoinder to the Isabel and Tolosa Campus Accountants comments, we emphasize herein that the cited reason of non-submission of lacking documentary requirements does not dispense with it the responsibility of the Accountant on the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria.  The accountant must take initiative and exert utmost effort to require the submission of the lacking documents especially that most of these are just in the custody of the Main Campus.  We further require the Accountant of Tolosa Campus to prepare the necessary JEV on the CY 2020 payables that were inadvertently recorded as current year expense and submit the same to the Audit Team for verification.





	Doubtful reliability of Computer Software balance due to misclassified accounts, P13,362,945.50; and non-maintenance of SL



6)	The reliability of the reported year-end balance of the Computer Software account amounting to P18,138,930.17 is doubtful due to: a) the erroneous classification of the development cost of VSU’s internal project amounting to P13,362,945.50; b) the erroneous recording of adjustments of P196,612.00; and c) the non-maintenance of SL, all contrary to the pertinent provisions of GAM for NGAs, Volumes I and III, thereby affecting the fair presentation of the accounts in the financial statements.

1)	An intangible asset arising from development (or from the development phase of an internal project) shall be recognized if, and only if, an entity can demonstrate all of the following:



		i)	The technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale;



		ii)	Its intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it; 



		iii)	Its ability to use or sell the intangible asset; 



		iv)	How the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits or service potential. Among other things, the entity can demonstrate the existence of a market for the output of the intangible asset or the intangible asset itself or, if it is to be used internally, the usefulness of the intangible asset; 



		v)	The availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible asset; and



		vi)	Its ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development. (Par. 55, PPSAS 31) 



X x x



1)	The cost of an internally generated intangible asset is the sum of expenditure incurred from the date when the intangible asset first meets the recognition criteria. Reinstatement of expenditure previously recognized as an expense is prohibited. 



	2)	COA Circular No 2020-001 dated January 8, 2020, which prescribes Volume III (Updated 2019) of the Revised Chart of Accounts of the GAM for NGAs,  defines the following accounts:



Account Title 		Development in Progress-Computer Software 

Account Number	10898020

This includes trademarks, marketing rights, franchises, licenses, electronic copies (CD/DVD) of published materials, and the like. This account is credited for sale, transfers, obsolescence, termination and/or revocation of rights and benefits, and/or adjustments.



	3)	The development of the Human Resource Management Information System (HRMIS), as provided to the Audit Team by the VSU Programmer, is envisioned to support improved and harmonized management of human resources.  The system also aims to eliminate redundant data entry, manual calculations and paper forms as well as provide a web-based online environment for employees, administrators and human resource personnel.



	4)	The General Appropriation Acts (GAAs) for the Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 and FY 2020 provide for the Intangible Asset Outlay for VSU amounting to P13,350,000.00 and P3,820,000.00, respectively.

	7)	A further verification of these charges disclosed the following observations:



a)	Erroneous classification of the account to recognize the development cost of VSU’s internal project amounting to P13,362,945.50.



	8)	As described in the Revised Chart of Accounts, all charges in the development phase of the internal generation of intangible asset should be recorded as Development in Progress-Computer Software, instead of Computer Software. 



	9)	The Development in Progress-Computer Software is used to recognize all costs incurred during the development phase, and is credited to Computer Software once the programs are available for use in the government operation.



	10)	To summarize, the charges to the  Computer Software account (Table 23) amounting to P13,362,945.50 under FC 01-RAF should have been recorded as Development in Progress-Computer Software.



b)	Erroneous recording of adjustments totaling P196,612.00



	11)	Audit of the account disclosed that in CY 2018, computer software was purchased totaling P595,488.00, which included the payment of license fees for Windows Applications amounting to P196,612.00.  This transaction was erroneously recorded to Intangible Asset account.  These expenses should have been recorded under Other Intangible Asset as described in the GAM for NGAs, Volume III.









c)	Non-maintenance of SL



	12)	During the audit, it was also noted that no SLs were maintained for each of the fund clusters that would have provided details of the account.  This has caused the Audit Team difficulty in validating the accuracy of the reported year-end balance.



	13)	In view of these deficiencies, the reported year-end balance of Computer Software is of doubtful accuracy and reliability, thus affecting the fair presentation of the accounts in the financial statements.



	14)	We recommended that the President require the Accountant of Main Campus to:



1)	reclassify the recorded development costs of P13,362,945.50 to the Development in Progress-Computer Software account and the payment of license fees amounting to  P196,612.00 to Other Intangible Asset account in compliance with the GAM for NGAs, Volume III;



2)	submit the pertinent JEVs for the above adjustments to the Audit Team for validation and;



3)	maintain SL and the necessary supporting schedules to provide details of the account balances to enable the easy verification of their accuracy.



	15)	The Accountant commented that the reclassification of accounts totaling P13,362,945.50 was recorded per JEV Nos. 01-2021 04-183 and 2021-05-260 GJ#27 dated April 2021 and May 31, 2021, respectively.  The payments of license fees in the amount of P196,612.00 will be reclassified.  A Subsidiary ledger will be maintained for the year 2021.





	Unreconciled reciprocal accounts, Due from Other Funds and Due to Other Funds balances of P148,666.94 and P971,441.13, respectively



7)	The reported year-end balances of the reciprocal accounts, Due from Other Funds and Due to Other Funds amounting to P148,666.94 and P971,441.13, respectively, have remained unreconciled, contrary to Section 112 of PD No. 1445 and COA Circular No. 2020-001 dated January 08, 2020 prescribing the updated Revised Chart of Accounts of the GAM for NGAs, Volume III, thus affecting the accuracy and fair presentation of the accounts in the financial statements.

	

	

	

	

	1)	Section 112 of PD No. 1445 states that:



SECTION 112. Recording of financial transaction. Each government agency shall record its financial transactions and operations conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and in accordance with pertinent laws and regulations.



	2)	Chapter 19, Section 7 of the GAM for NGAS, Volume 1 provides among others:



Section 7.  Fair Presentation and Compliance with PPSAS. Financial statements shall present fairly the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of the entity.  Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses set out in PPSAS.  The application of PPSASs, with additional disclosures when necessary, is presumed to result in financial statements that achieve a fair presentation. (Par. 27, PPSAS 1). 



	3)	Furthermore, COA Circular No. 2020-001 dated January 08, 2020 prescribing Volume III- RCA (Updated 2019) of the GAM for NGAs defines the following:

	

Account Title 		Due from Other Funds

Account Number	10304050

Normal Balance	Credit

Description	This account is credited to recognize the receipt of funds not covered by allotment from an Operating Unit by the Central/Regional Offices/Bureaus or another Operating Unit of the same agency for the implementation of specific program or project subject to liquidation and other intra-agency transactions.  This account is debited for liquidation of funds received, settlement of liabilities, and/or adjustments.

		

	4)	Reciprocal accounts are maintained to monitor the recording of inter and intra fund transactions for convenience in setting up and offsetting internal transactions.  As such, these accounts should always have equal balances. 

	

	5)	VSU maintains four funds namely: the Regular Agency Fund (RAF), the Internally Generated Fund (IGF), the Business Related Fund (BRF) and the Inter-Agency Trust Fund (IATF).

	

	6)	Review of the financial statements and the schedules of the intra-agency accounts, the Due from Other Funds and Due to Other Funds showed unreconciled balances with a total variance of P822,774.19, as summarized hereunder:

	8)	Audit disclosed that in the above intra fund transactions, the accounting entry with a debit to one account had no counterpart credit to another account and vice versa.  For example under item (d) of the table above, the IGP school share of P516,574.63 under the FC 06-BRF is due for transfer to FC 05-IGF, hence a payable was established in the FC 06-BRF books but no corresponding receivable was created in the FC 05-IGF books.  This practice effectively does not balance the reciprocal accounts, so that one is overstated while another is understated.

	

	9)	As noted in item (c) of the same table above, the Due to Other Funds account under FC 05-IGF amounting to P22,713.14 of the Villaba Campus represents the remaining balance of the fund transfer received from the Main Campus amounting to P142,250.00 in CY 2019 for the implementation of the project.  The entries involved to record the fund transfer from the Main Campus to the Villaba Campus are as follows:

	10)	The Audit Team noted that the Main Campus erroneously debited the Other Supplies Expense account although no actual expense was incurred at the time of transfer.  On the other hand, the Villaba Campus also erroneously credited the account Due to Other Funds upon receipt of the fund transfer.



	11)	Under the GAM Volume III, the Due from Other Funds and Due to Other Funds accounts are used to recognize transfers to and from other funds of the agency while the Due from Operating/Field Units and Due to Operating Units are used to recognize fund transfers to an Operating/Field Unit from another Operating/Field Unit of the same agency for the implementation of specific program or project subject to liquidation and other intra-agency transactions.

	

	12)	The External Campuses do not maintain a complete set of books for their monthly financial reports including trial balances are submitted to the Main Campus for consolidation.  These campuses also do maintain individual accounting records, so that the correct entries to recognize the transfers would have been to debit the Due from Operating/Field Units account at the Main Campus for P142,250.00, and to credit the Due to Operating Units account at the Villaba Campus for the same amount.

	

	13)	Likewise under item (b) and (c) of Table 25 above, it was noted that the Due from Other Funds and Due to Other Funds under FC 05-IGF of the Main Campus reflected the same balances of P12,566.60.  The related accounting entries for these transactions are as follows:

	14)	In this particular case, the Due from Other Funds should have been credited to close the receivable account upon receipt of the fund transfer from the 07-IATF or Trust Fund, and not the Due to Other Funds.  This error has caused both accounts to remain unreconciled and outstanding as at year end.



	15)	An effective internal control involves the presence of appraisal or review of the transactions to ensure adherence to prescribed policies and procedures.  The recording of transactions should then be subject to review and cross-checking so that errors are immediately corrected as soon as these are discovered. 

	

	16)	The existence of these variances only shows that transactions are not properly reviewed and reconciled.  As such, the misstatements affect the fair presentation of the accounts in the financial statements.

	

	17)	We recommended that the President should require the Accountants to:

	

			a)		exert utmost effort to reconcile the reciprocal accounts of Due from Other Funds and Due to Other Funds by tracing the discrepancies and effecting immediate adjustments in the books.  Thereafter, the Accountants should closely monitor the recording of all transactions and effect the periodic reconciliation of the accounts to ensure the accuracy of the account balances in the financial statements; and



			b)		use the Due from Operating/Field Units and Due to Operating Units in recording intra-agency transactions between campuses in their respective accounting records.



	18)	The Accountant of Main Campus commented that adjustments were effected for the error in the fund transfers of P12,566.60 per JEV No. 05-2021-03-0065a under FC 05-IGF and P900.00 per JEV No. 05-2021-03-005 under FC 06-BRF and erroneous entry for cash refund of P500.00 per JEV No. 01-2021-03-116 under RAF, all dated March 2021.  In addition, adjustments will be made for other discrepancies noted and the related JEVs and supporting documents will be submitted on or before April 30, 2021.



	19)	The Accountant of Tolosa Campus informed the nature of the entries to Due from Other Funds of P135,200.00 and Due to Other Funds Accounts of P800.00.  Also, she mentioned that they will use the Due from Operating/field Units and Due to Operating Units in their transactions, monitor the recording of all financial transactions and likewise, work on the necessary correcting entries to reconcile the accounts.



	20)	While, the Accountant of Isabel Campus submitted JEV No. 2021-04-054 dated April 31, 2021 for the adjustments made in the reclassification of accounts of P800.00 to correct the erroneous entry to the Due to Other Funds.



	21)	The Accountant of Villaba Campus commented that proper adjustment will be made for the erroneous entry to Due to Other Funds instead of Due to Operating Units.



	22)	The Accountant of Alangalang Campus submitted JEVs for setting up of Due from Other Funds and for the fund transfer to the respective bank account where the expense was erroneously charged.



	23)	As a rejoinder to the comment of Tolosa Campus, we would like to reiterate the need to reconcile its reciprocal accounts to ensure the correctness of the reported financial data.  Further, the Due from Other Funds and Due to Other Funds accounts are to be used in recording of intra-agency transactions within the campus.  However, for those transactions between campuses, Due from Operating/Field Units and Due to Operating Units shall be used.





	Cash Advances not promptly liquidated and adequately monitored - P1,013,160.73



8)	Cash advances totaling P1,013,160.73 have remained unliquidated as of December 31, 2020, contrary to Section 89 of PD No. 1445 and COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997, thereby exposing cash to possible risks of misapplication or misappropriation.  Likewise, an unreconciled difference in balances of the Advances to Special Disbursing Officer (SDO) and the Advances for Operating Expenses totaling P639,406.49 was noted between the GL and the SL of the Main and the Tolosa Campuses, respectively, contrary to Sections 89 and 111 of PD No. 1445, thus affecting the fair presentation of the accounts in the financial statements. 



	1)	Sections 89 and 111 of PD No. 1445 provide:



Section 89. Limitations on cash advance.  No cash advance shall be given unless for a legally authorized specific purpose.  A cash advance shall be reported on and liquidated as soon as the purpose for which it was given has been served.

	8)	Further, advances for operating expenses shall be granted to accountable officers for payment of operating expenses of operating/field units not maintaining a complete set of books of accounts as in the case of the Cebu and Manila field offices.  Thus, all campuses should not be granted cash advances of the same nature.  Although External Campuses do not maintain a complete set of books as their monthly financial reports are submitted to the Main Campus for consolidation, they do, however, have individual accounting records and a disbursement system.



	9)	A discrepancy in balances of the Advances to SDO and Advances for Operating Expenses accounts totaling P639,406.49 was noted between the GL and the SL of the Main Campus and of the Tolosa Campus, as shown in Table 30.

	10)	The above noted discrepancy in balances of the Advances for Special Disbursing Officer and Advances for Operating Expenses has affected the fair presentation of these accounts in the financial statements.



	11)	We recommended that the President require:



a)	all officers and employees concerned to liquidate immediately their outstanding cash advances; and henceforth, to strictly adhere to the pertinent provisions on the granting, utilization and liquidation of cash advances in compliance with COA Circular No. 97-002;



b)	the Accountants concerned to:



1)	closely monitor the liquidation of outstanding cash advances to avoid the accumulation of unliquidated balances as of year-end and;



2)	send demand letters to Accountable Officers with outstanding cash advances to facilitate liquidation in order to avoid misapplication of funds.



3)	reconcile their individual records in order to detect valid reconciling items so that necessary adjusting entries can be effected promptly and thereafter, conduct a periodic reconciliation with VSU Main Campus to come up with an accurate and reliable balances of the affected accounts.



	12)	The Accountant of Main Campus stated that the Accounting Office monitored closely the liquidation of cash advances and already sent demand letters.  Likewise, she added that the Accountable Officer of the Main Campus with outstanding cash advance for operating expenses amounting to P100,000.00 was already liquidated as per Liquidation Report with total amount spent of P20,087.81 and Official Receipts Nos. 0599362 dated April 30, 2021 and 0599552 dated May 5, 2021 amounting P50,000.00 and P29,912.19, respectively.



	13)	The Accountant of Tolosa Campus stated in her written reply that they will do their best to comply with the recommendations. Ledgers per employee will be updated to closely monitor the liquidation of outstanding cash advances. Demand letters will also be sent to those with outstanding cash advances. She also explained that the limited availability of records hampers the reconciliation of the discrepancies however, she commits that they will give their best to accomplish the task and will prepare the necessary correcting/adjusting entries for those liquidations that were unrecorded once the documents have been collected.



	14)	As a rejoinder, the Accountant of Main Campus should prepare and submit to Audit Team a copy of the pertinent JEV for validation.

It was noted that there were various cash advances for the purchase of office supplies and construction materials for the printing and making of drop boxes of instructional modules, supplies for repairs and maintenance of motor vehicles and planting materials.  All these cash advances do not fall under any of the instances allowed for the grant of cash advances enumerated under the COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997.



	8)	It has been the practice of the Main Campus to grant cash advances for the purchase of vehicle spare parts, materials and engine machining/calibration services.



	9)	The personnel concerned from the External Campuses justified their practice by saying that the requested items listed in their respective Project Procurement Management Plan (PPMP) were submitted to the Main Campus for procurement through competitive bidding or thru other alternative methods of procurement, but they needed the COVID-19 supplies to provide them with a safer working environment.  The procurement of instructional materials and modular drop boxes were urgently needed for the opening of classes for the 1st semester of SY-2020-2021 scheduled on August 24, 2020 which is why these cash advances were resorted to in the procurement of these items.



	10)	The procurement of supplies through cash advances is not a mode of procurement provided for in the above-mentioned circulars.  Moreover, the nature of expenses are not among the purposes enumerated in COA Circular 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 for which payments may be made in the form of cash through cash advance, to wit:



1.   	Salaries and Wages; 

2.   	Commutable allowances;

3.   	Honoraria and other similar payments to officials and employees

4. 	Petty operating expenses consisting of small payments for maintenance and operating expenses which cannot be paid conveniently by check or are required to be paid immediately; 

5.  	Current operating expenditures of the agency field office or of the activity of the agency undertaken in the field when it is impractical to pay the same by check;

6. 	Travel expenditures, including transportation fare, travel allowance, hotel room/lodging expenses and other expenses incurred by officials and employees in connection with official travel.



	11)	Furthermore, audit of the liquidation reports for these cash advance revealed the following:



a)	pre-repair and post inspection reports were not attached to the liquidation report for the cash advance relative to the purchase of supplies for the repairs and maintenance of motor vehicles amounting to P50,000.00 under Check No. 85645 dated February 3, 2020;



b)	the purchase of diesel totaling P8,387.20 was charged against the cash advance amounting to P60,000.00 taken out for the purchase of planting materials under Check No. 458693 dated March 19, 2020, as detailed below:

	12)	As provided in COA Circular No. 97-002, any cash advance shall be used solely for the specific legal purpose for which it was granted.



	13)	The practice of taking out cash advances for the purchase of supplies and materials could have been avoided had there been: (a) a more stringent controls over procurement procedures, taking into consideration the timing of the actual procurement activity, and the emergency sought to be addressed, (b) coordination between the End-User and the BAC on the items that are immediately needed and if the BAC has been able to immediately come up with alternatives in order to procure the items needed in order to address the necessity.



	14)	We recommended that President require the:



a)	BAC to stop the practice of taking out cash advances for the procurement of goods and materials, and instead, follow the procurement methods provided under GPPB Resolution No. 03-2020 dated March 9, 2020,  GPPB Circular No. 04-2016 dated 20 December 2016, and the COA and GPPB Joint Memorandum Circular No. 1 dated March 26, 2020, and henceforth follow the guidelines enumerated under the GPPB Circular No. 01-2020 dated April 6, 2020, so that government resources are utilized efficiently and safeguarded against misappropriation.



b)	BAC to plan all procurement activities for any given period in accordance with the schedules provided under RA No. 9184;



c)	Accountable Officers to use their cash advances solely for the specific legal purpose for which they were granted in accordance with COA Circular No. 97-002; and



d)	Accountants to review the completeness of all supporting documents submitted to liquidate their cash advances.



	15)	In their written reply, the management of Villaba Campus stated that the purchased construction materials for the making of drop boxes for instructional modules submitted by students was already liquidated per GJ No. 2020-08-056 dated August 31, 2020, hence the management made a clear statement that Villaba Campus do not have any obligation for compliance.



	16)	In his written reply, the BAC Chairman explained that VSU has about 20 old model vehicles distributed among different offices and departments, which the Preventive Maintenance Schedule had already expired.  Since it could not be predicted exactly which spare parts have to be changed or replaced in specific periods, the mechanic has to order the parts that needs replacement at the time of vehicle inspection.  This unpredictability would result in unplanned purchases and may be considered emergency procurement.  In most cases, only one or two pieces of the part is in the inventory of local stores, noting that the parts is a spare for an old or a phase out model, thus the mechanic has to purchase the parts after canvassing so as to avoid the interruption of a function or an activity.



	17)	The BAC Chairman stated that they have been following the procurement procedure prescribed in the RIRR of RA 9184.  Nevertheless, the reason for the End-user is the unpredictability of the need for procurement of spare parts and the need for vehicle re-conditioning and servicing.  He further explained that the BAC again has to re-iterate the information that all End-users must abide with the prescribed procedures.



	18)	In his written reply, the BAC Chairman stated that the Accountable Officer (AO) manages the IGP project and thus needs ready cash on hand so as to pay for needed services or purchase goods.  There was no purchase of planting materials but rather as payment for the transplanting and also there was a need for transport from one site to another.



	19)	Accordingly, it was noted that the purchase of diesel was resorted because at one point, the VSU fuel station had no available diesel and the AO was forced to look for fuel outside of VSU.  The BAC Chairman explained that the purchase of diesel was not part of the items listed submitted to justify the request of cash bond thus, the End-User should be re-oriented regarding the use of cash advances.



	20)	The Accountant of Alangalang Campus in her written reply stated that cash advance was resorted because the supplies and materials needed were considered unforeseen due to the pandemic.  She also explained that if they have submitted and waited for the BAC to act on their request which should have been the case, it will take so much time following the timetable of bidding and such delays would cause a tremendous effect on the output of the college since the requested supplies and materials were for module preparation and medical supplies for sanitary and prevention measures against Covid19.



	21)	The Accountant of Isabel Campus explained in her written reply that they resorted to cash advance for the purchase of various hygiene supplies and thermo scanner for the faculty, staff and students in the prevention of the COVID19 due to the affected mobility particularly for the mode of transportation.  She added that it was a challenge for Isabel Campus to expedite acquisition since the procurement activities are centralized in the Main Campus.  Accordingly, the purchase of supplies through cash advance only happened once and they assured that the audit recommendations are well taken.  She also mentioned that the issue of expediting procurement activities will be solved with the creation of a separate BAC and Technical Working Group (TWG) members in the component campuses.



	22)	As a rejoinder to the comment of Villaba Campus, the audit issue is not about having unliquidated cash advance as of year-end, but on the purchase of supplies through cash advance contrary to the RIRR of RA 9184 which clearly provides that procurement should be through Public Bidding or Alternative Modes of Procurement, as the case may be.  Hence, we advise the management of Villaba Campus to understand fully the audit observations discussed so that corrective measures or improvements be instituted on its current procurement practices.





	Inconsistencies in the implementation of ExMDPS for Accounts Payable



10)	Inconsistencies in the implementation of the Expanded Modified Direct Payment Scheme (ExMDPS) for Accounts Payable in settling obligations have caused the payment of P730,737,136.53 or 95.65% of the VSU’s obligations to be made in checks, contrary to DBM Circular Letter No. 2013-16 dated December 23, 2013, and DBM Circular Letter No. 2018-14 dated December 28, 2018, thus defeating the DBM Circular Letters’ objective to have a more efficient payment system.



	1)	Pertinent provisions of the DBM Circular Letter 2013-16 dated December 23, 2013, provide:



1)	Background

	2)	DBM Circular Letter No. 2018-14 [Updated Guidelines in the Implementation of the Modified Direct Scheme (MDPS) Due Creditors/Payees of All National Government Agencies (NGAS)] dated December 28, 2018 provides:



3.0 GENERAL GUIDELINES 



3.1 NGAs shall use the existing LLDAP-ADA and SLIIE to settle all A/Ps to creditors/payees including utility companies and social insurance corporations except GSIS (until such time that GSIS is equipped to accept direct payment scheme). 



The implementation of the MDPS shall strictly be followed for transactions entered into by NGAs. Payment of A/Ps due creditors/payees through the LDDAP- ADA shall be free of transaction cost, provided said creditors/payees maintain Current/Savings Account (CA/SA) with any branch of the same MDS-GSB of the NGA. 



3.2 The NGAs shall require its creditors/payees without CA/SA accounts with the agency's MDS-GSB to issue a remitter's instruction to the agency GSB as sender of the fund.  The GSBs shall follow BSP Circular 980 series of 2017 on the National Retail Payment System (NRPS) framework which specified that transaction cost/s shall be paid by the sender. 



The suppliers/creditors as remitter shall shoulder the cost of transferring payment from the NGAs GSB to other GSB (Land Bank of the Philippines to Development Bank of the Philippines) and NGA's GSB to other non GSBs (LBP to BDO, etc.).  The GSBs shall use InstaPay Electronic Fund Transfer Service of BSP for transactions P50,000 and below. 



3.3 NGAs shall submit duly signed LDDAP-ADA and the covering SLIIE (equivalent ACIC) to the MDS-GSBs.  The MDS-GSBs shall not process LDDAP-ADA without the covering SLIIE consistent with the provisions of BTr Letter Circular No 3-2018. 



3.4	Creditors/suppliers who cannot be conveniently nor practicably be paid using the ADA as determined by the Agency Head, may continue to be paid through issuance of MDS checks or cash.  These accounts include: 



3.4.1 Small value creditors/payees with claims during the year costing P10,000 and below, e.g., government scholars, recipients of DOLE's Special Program for the Employment of Students (SPES) 



3.4.2 Creditor/payee of the agency with non-regular transaction or one time transaction during the year, e.g., Right-of-Way claimants, relocation expenses for informal settlers and others



3.4.3 Companies which are not authorized, per their internal policy, to open current accounts in addition to their existing accounts. 



X x x



3.8	Consistent with accounting and auditing rules and regulations, the NGAs are reminded to require their creditors to issue Official Receipts (ORs) or Sales Invoice as evidence of receipt of payment through LLDAP-ADA and SLIIE or MDS check.  However, in instances where supply of goods are ON CREDIT and the required Sales Invoice are issued upon delivery of goods, supplemental/secondary receipts such as Acknowledgement Receipt or Collection Receipt are issued upon collection of account following Revenue Regulations No. 18-2012.



X x x



3.8.3	Non-issuance of OR or Sales Invoice by the contractor/supplier shall be reported to the BIR as violation of regulations



	3)	Verification of the Report of Checks and LDDAP-ADA issued during the year showed total disbursements under MDS Account amounting to P764,005,486.74. Of this total, P730,737,136.53 or 95.65% were paid thru checks and only P33,268,350.21 or 4.35% were paid thru LDDAP-ADA, as summarized in the table below:

	4)	As can be gleaned from the table above, VSU failed to consistently implement the ExMDPS for the bulk of its obligations in compliance with the aforementioned circulars.  It was noted that there were payments made to various creditors for five times or more in a total amount of P680,511,484.58 which could have been  conveniently paid thru LDDAP-ADA but VSU chose to pay these obligations by checks.  The creditors for these transactions included the VSU employees for payment of their salaries and wages, honoraria, External Campuses for fund transfers of monthly operational requirements, VSU Cooperatives, other NGAs, government corporations, utilities company and suppliers/other payees, itemized as follows:

	5)	The DBM Circular Letter No. 2018-14 clearly provides that creditors and suppliers may continue to be paid through the issuance of MDS checks or cash if it involves non-regular transactions, or one-time transactions during the year.



	6)	Furthermore, the VSU Cashier still issues checks to the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) for the salaries and wages of the regular employees when actually, the amount could be automatically debited from the MDS account of VSU based on the Advice to Debit Account (ADA) with the supporting payroll register bearing the individual LBP account number of the employee.



	7)	As a result, the objective of transparency, accountability and efficiency in the payment system by reducing substantially the due and demandable Accounts Payable and minimizing the volume of outstanding checks were not attained.



	8)	Inquiry with the University Cashier revealed that VSU actually applied the LDDAP-ADA scheme, however, there were uncontrolled circumstances wherein payment thru checks were more convenient.  The instance included cases wherein VSU is not able to meet the bank’s servicing requirement of three days cut off in the submission of LDDAP-ADA before the end of the quarter, to avoid the reversion of cash to the treasury account, they opted to issue checks for payment of payables.  Likewise, some creditors/payees do not have an existing LBP account, thus are paid thru checks.









	9)	We recommended that President require the Cashier to:



a)	adopt strictly the ExMDPS for the payment of all Accounts Payable due to all its creditors and to refrain from using checks for disbursement for a more efficient and economical payment system; and



b)	advice all creditors/payees to open a current or savings account (CA/SA) with any branch of their authorized Modified Disbursement System, Government Servicing Banks (MDS-GSB).



	10)	The Main Campus Cashier commented that they were able to make arrangement with LBP that they will just put one payee’s name (with et al.) in the LDDAP report with attachments of the list of payees and corresponding account number.  Such arrangement allows them to pay their salaries, wages and other benefits to their employees using LDDAP-ADA system.  They are also currently working out the VSU’s enrollment in the LBP weAccess system so that they can transact electronic payments to various service providers and government agencies like Philhealth, Pag-ibig and BOT.



	11)	With regards to their Leyeco payments and external campuses fund transfers, the Main Campus Cashier stated that they started to include it in their LDDAP-ADA last April 16, 2021.



	12)	She also stated that they have already coordinated with the Procurement Office to advise their suppliers and other payees to open a current or savings account with any branch of LBP.  They were also able to coordinate with service providers like Leyeco and have already agreed that their payments will be made thru LDDAP-ADA.



	13)	Further, she commented that the recommendation is well taken, and they will do their best to minimize further issuance of MDS checks and they are glad to impose improvements and innovations in connection to the recommendations starting April 15, 2021.



	

	Transaction documents totaling P280,916,905.83 remained unsubmitted 



11)	Disbursement vouchers, payrolls and their supporting documents for CY 2020 transactions totalling P280,916,905.83 have remained unsubmitted as of April 6, 2021 incurring delays ranging from 86 to 420 days, contrary to Sections 100 and 107 of PD No. 1445; and COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009, thus precluding the Audit Team from conducting a prompt audit of the accounts and financial transactions for an early detection and correction of errors/deficiencies and for a timely reporting of audit results to the management.



	1)	Section 7.2 of COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009 provides:

Disbursing officers in any government agency shall render monthly reports of their transactions pursuant to regulations of the Commission to be submitted not later than the fifth day of the ensuing month to the auditor concerned who shall conduct the necessary examination and audit within thirty days from receipt thereof.



Section 107. Time and mode of rendering account.  In the absence of specific provision of law, all accountable officers shall render their accounts, submit their vouchers, and make deposits of money collected or held by them at such times and in such manner as shall be prescribed in the regulations of the Commission.



	3)	Pertinent provisions of COA Circular No. 95-006 dated May 18, 1995, states:

6.03	Accountable officers shall submit the records receipts, disbursements, expenditures, operations, and all other transactions, together with the supporting documents, to the Chief Accountants in the manner and within the time frame prescribed in existing rules and regulations. 



6.04 Disbursing officers in particular shall faithfully comply with Section 100 of Presidential Decree No. 1445 which require them to render monthly reports of their transactions pursuant to existing auditing regulations not later than the fifth day of the ensuing month to the auditor concerned. 



6.05 The official involved in the daily recording of transactions in the books of accounts shall turn over the receipts and the disbursement records with all paid vouchers and documents evidencing the transaction to the Auditor within ten (10) days from date of receipt of said documents.



7.0 FAILURE TO SUBMIT REPORTS

D. 1445).



	4)	Verification of the submission of transaction documents covering the period January to December 31, 2020 disclosed that 2,290 disbursement vouchers, payrolls and their supporting documents with an aggregate amount of P280,916,905.83 remained unsubmitted to COA as of April 6, 2021.  The number of days delayed have ranged from 86 to 420 days already, as summarized below:

	6)	The preceding tables clearly indicate the incurrence of delay in the submission of the required DVs and their supporting documents.  Specific details of these transaction documents are shown in Annexes C to F.



	7)	On the other hand,  the Audit Team would like to acknowledge the efforts of the Alangalang Campus on the complete submission of their disbursement vouchers, payrolls, and their supporting documents for CY 2020.  This is an indication that the submission of complete transaction documents is possible and can be complied with.



	8)	The delay in the submission of these transactions documents has prevented the Audit Team from conducting a timely post-audit, thus management assertions for occurrence, accuracy, validity and completeness of the transactions could not be promptly established.  At the same time, errors and deficiencies could not be immediately detected, communicated and corrected, thereby, defeating the purpose of providing timely and significant financial data to its users.



	9)	We recommended that the President require the Accountants, the Cashiers and the Disbursing Officers concerned to:



a)	submit immediately the lacking DVs together with their supporting documents totaling P280,916,905.83,  and henceforth enjoin the concerned personnel to consistently observe the submission of accounts and financial reports within the reglementary period pursuant to COA Circular No. 2009-006, Sections 100 and 107 of PD 1445 and pertinent provisions of COA Circular No. 95-006; and



b)	investigate the cause for the delays in the preparation and submission of the said reports, and immediately take the necessary action to address the recurring problem in order to stop the incurrence of the same and likewise, to facilitate timely audit of the transactions.



	10)	The Cashier of Main Campus stated in her written reply that after evaluation on the reasons for the delay of submission of vouchers and supporting documents, they realized that most of these reasons were connected to pandemic.  In order to facilitate fast payments to their payees and suppliers, they tend to deposit their payments to their bank accounts instead of traveling or paying them personally, thus, it takes some times before they can receive the ORs from them.  Moreover, they will exert more efforts to follow up suppliers and payees for the issuance of ORs to further facilitate immediate submission of these vouchers in consonance to these recommendations.



	11)	On the other hand, Main Campus Accountant commented that the lacking disbursement vouchers and payrolls were already submitted to the Audit Team as per transmittal with various dates.  She further commented that the submission of the said reports by the Accounting Office to the Audit Team was dependent as to when the Cash Office can submit the same to Accounting Office.



	12)	For Tolosa Campus, they committed to develop a more efficient system in their filing of the supporting documents to ensure compliance to the provisions of PD No. 1445 and COA Circular 2009-06 on the submission of disbursement vouchers for the succeeding reporting periods.





	Reasonableness and appropriateness of food procured cannot not be ascertained 



12)	The reasonableness and appropriateness of expenditures for food procured during trainings, meetings and other events totaling P7,361,312.75 could not be ascertained due to incomplete supporting documents, and to various other deficiencies noted in audit, contrary to Section 4 of PD No. 1445, COA Circular 2012-003 and RIRR of RA No. 9184.



	1)	Section 4 of PD No. 1445 provides:



Section 4. Fundamental principles. Financial transactions and operations of any government agency shall be governed by the fundamental principles set forth hereunder, to wit: 



1)	No money shall be paid out of any public treasury or depository except in pursuance of an appropriation law or other specific statutory authority. 



2)	Government funds or property shall be spent or used solely for public purposes. 



3)	Trust funds shall be available and may be spent only for the specific purpose for which the trust was created or the funds received. 



X x x



1)	Claims against government funds shall be supported with complete documentation.

	2)	Items 3.0 and 4.0 of COA Circular 2012-003 (Updated Guidelines for the Prevention and Disallowance of Irregular, Unnecessary, Excessive, Extravagant and Unconscionable Expenditures) dated October 29, 2012 defines the following terms:



3.0 “IRREGULAR” EXPENDITURES



3.1 Definition



The term “irregular expenditure” signifies an expenditure incurred without adhering to established rules, regulations, procedural guidelines, policies, principles or practices that have gained recognition in laws.  Irregular expenditures are incurred if funds are disbursed without conforming with prescribed usages and rules of discipline.  There is no observance of an established pattern, course, mode of action, behavior, or conduct in the incurrence of an irregular expenditure.  A transaction conducted in a manner that deviates or departs from, or which does not comply with standards set is deemed irregular.  A transaction which fails to follow or violates appropriate rules of procedures is, likewise, irregular.



X x x



4.0 “UNNECESSARY” EXPENDITURES



4.1 Definition



The term pertains to expenditures which could not pass the test of prudence or the diligence of a good father of a family, thereby denoting non-responsiveness to the exigencies of the service.  Unnecessary expenditures are those not supportive of the implementation of the objectives and mission of the agency relative to the nature of its operation.  This would also include incurrence of expenditure not dictated by the demands of good government, and those the utility of which cannot be ascertained at a specific time.  An expenditure that is not essential or that which can be dispensed with without loss or damage to property is considered unnecessary.  The mission and thrusts of the agency incurring the expenditures must be considered in determining whether or not an expenditure is necessary.



	3)	Moreover, Section 10, Rule IV of the RIRR of RA 9184 states that:



Section 10. Competitive Bidding



All procurement shall be done through competitive bidding, except as provided in Rule XVI of this IRR.



	4)	Verification of the submitted transaction documents from January to November 2020 of the Main Campus revealed payments for meals and snacks totaling P7,361,312.75, summarized in the following activities:

	5)	Review of the DVs pertinent to the above transactions revealed the following:

	

a)		Meals and snacks served during the conduct of APB Meetings, NAPB Meetings, University ADCO meetings and other regular meetings are deemed unnecessary expenditures as provided under Item 4.0 of COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012.

	

	6)	Meals and snacks during the conduct of regular meetings can be dispensed with as these meetings and activities are regular functions and responsibilities of these officials and employees.  Moreover, these are deemed unnecessary on the ground that the agenda of the meetings does not entail urgency in nature which could be dispensed with without loss or damage to government properties.

	

	7)	In CY 2020, several issuances from the Civil Service, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Inter-agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases practically prevented gatherings and meetings both in school and in the workplace in an effort to arrest the spread of the COVID-19.

	

b)		The activity/training designs, targeted list of participants, notices of meetings and agenda, minutes of meetings and other significant supporting documents to justify the procurement of meals and snacks were not attached.

	

	8)	Of the total P7,361,312.75 expenses for meals and snacks during the year, only the expenditure for P211,955.00 was duly supported with the requisite program of activity, and requests for budget.  Likewise, only those activities relating to procurement of P241,790.00 had notices of meeting.  The other gatherings amounting to P6,907,567.75 did not have any supporting documents to justify the expenditure for meals and snacks making it difficult for the Audit Team to assess the necessity, propriety and, reasonableness of the expenditures.

	

c)		Payment for meals and snacks totaling P586,868.00 had no description as to what kind of activity was undertaken, and the absence of any other supporting documents making it difficult for the Audit Team to ascertain whether the expenses were for official purposes or not.

	

	9)	Various claims for meals and snacks had no activity title, and only a list of those persons who were served with meals and snacks was provided although these documents had no corresponding signatures of the attendees.

	

d)		Quantities of food ordered/served were in excess of the number of participants based on the attached Attendance Sheets.  Further, some activities for events having more than one day duration had only one attendance sheet attached to cover the whole duration of the activity.



e)		It was noted that even when events started at 8:00 am and ended at 5:00 pm, breakfast and dinner were still served.



f)		Meals and snacks for two events were paid twice to the VSU Pavilion, totaling P62,450.00, as shown below:

	11)	Review of the transaction documents showed that the above events had the same activity title, date and attendance sheet but different types of meals.  Likewise, the attendance sheets attached to the vouchers were only photocopies, thus the Audit Team could not properly identify to which event the documents referred to.



i)		Procurement for meals and snacks did not go through public bidding or any of the alternative modes of procurement contrary to the guidelines set forth in RA. 9184 and its RIRR, as evidenced by the absence of the following relevant documents:

	

--		Purchase Request

--		Request for Quotations

--		Abstract of quotations

--		Purchase Orders

--		Inspection and Acceptance Report

--		Other relevant documentary requirements



	12)	All of the above meals and snacks were procured in VSU Pavilion, and a certification was attached to the DVs justifying the need for the emergency and negotiated purchase of food catering services.  The certification also stated that VSU Pavilion does not require an advance payment, and accepts reservations regardless of the number of persons.  Furthermore, the attached certification also asserted that the availment of food catering service through VSU Pavilion was one way of patronizing the Income Generating Project (IGP) of the school, and in return was beneficial/advantageous to VSU as a whole.



	13)	While procuring through VSU Pavilion is one way of patronizing the IGP of VSU, the Audit Team noted that the procurement procedures and other internal control procedures over expenditures were circumvented and disregarded as well as the reservation of foods was made regardless of the absence of documents certifying that it is for official purpose, and if there was a fund appropriated for that event.  All these did not enable the proper evaluation of the procurement, and the non-adherence to the prescribed modes of procurement defeats the very purpose of the rules and regulations provided in RA 9184 by providing equal opportunities to all qualified and competent suppliers available in the locality.



	14)	It is important to install appropriate measures over the use of government funds to avoid the incurrence of unnecessary expenditures that prove disadvantageous to the government, thus:



--		Attendance in all meetings and conferences should include only official participants who have been properly identified in an official memorandum.

--		Face to face meetings with VSU officials and employees if conducted half-day, should dispense with snacks only.

--		Concerned officials should use their Representation Allowance in ordinary meetings or entertaining visitors because these were expenses incidental to and in connection with the actual performance of their respective functions.



	15)	Had the above cost-saving measures been considered, a substantial amount in government resources could have been saved, and used to finance priority projects of VSU.

	

	16)	We recommended that the President require all department heads concerned to:



a)	submit the lacking documents such as but not limited to the minutes of meeting or agenda during the specified dates and justification or explanation on the necessity of procuring such meals;



b)	require officials with Representation Allowances to provide meals and snacks during meetings and activities that are incidental to and in connection with the actual performance of their functions;



c)	strictly observe prudence on the use of government funds for meals by ensuring that these are utilized only for expenses that are regular and necessary;



d)	process the return of P62,450.00 double payment to their respective fund clusters;



e)	strictly observe the proper procedures and appropriate modes of procurement in the purchase of meals as prescribed in RA No. 9184 and its RIRR; and



f)	ensure that meals and snacks for special occasions, conferences and committee meetings are duly supported with memoranda/official invitations stating the agenda of the meeting, activity/training design, guest lists, copy of program, original signed attendance sheet, minutes, and a certification duly signed by the Accountant that funds have been appropriated for the purpose.



	17)	The Director of Finance in her written reply commented that the Accounting Office already coordinated with the different offices for the submission of lacking documents. Annex A was attached to their written reply for the lacking supporting documents and justifications.



	18)	Moreover, the Director of Finance also commented that for Regular Fund in CY 2020, VSU has an approved budget under Training and Food Expenses for Faculty and Staff Development to answer for needs for various university events. She further commented that VSU only utilized 27% of the amount since it is considered as prudence spending. In the case of the Internally Generated Income, VSU also utilized 9% for training and 51% for food expenses. They further believe that VSU needs to consider the different activities across its major programs and the expenses related to food are within its appropriations. She also commented that VSU followed the existing accounting rules and regulations.



	19)	With regard to the noted double payments, she stated that disbursement vouchers for the return of payments are already in process.



	20)	In the case of the procurement procedure, they have coordinated with their BAC on the proper mode of procurement. She commented that they are in a dilemma since their IGP is not PhilGEPS and BIR registered for it is only an IGP of VSU. The desire to help their Guesthouse/Pavilion is also given priority especially that their income is affected.



	21)	Likewise, the Office of the President issued Memorandum Circular No. 54 containing the guidelines/procedures in requesting for food/snacks. 



	22)	As a rejoinder, had VSU followed the existing accounting rules and regulations, an AOM would not have been issued if they do so. The audit observations were more of incompleteness of supporting documents, the attachment of incorrect attendance sheets and noted erasures of dates which misleads the readers, as well as the absence of procurements for meals and snacks, all contrary to the provisions of PD No. 1445 and RA No. 9184.



	23)	Also, the submitted Annex A with supporting documents pertains only to noted deficiencies mentioned in Tables 50 and 51 above. While, the required activity/training designs, targeted list of participants, notices of meetings and agenda, minutes of meetings and other significant supporting documents to justify the procurement of meals and snacks amounting to P6,907,567.75 as discussed in the above finding remained unsubmitted as of this writing. 





	Validity and accuracy of Rice Production Project Reports could not be ascertained



13)	The validity and accuracy of the Sales, Collection and Remittances of various Rice Production Projects could not be ascertained because of the absence of a sound internal control system over the implementation of these projects, contrary to the pertinent provisions of PD No. 1445 thereby exposing government funds and property to the possible risks of loss and misuse.



	1)	Pertinent provisions of PD No. 1445 provide:



Section 2. Declaration of Policy.  It is the declared policy of the State that all resources of the government shall be managed, expended or utilized in accordance with law and regulations, and safeguarded against loss or wastage through illegal or improper disposition, with a view to ensuring efficiency, economy and effectiveness in the operations of government.  The responsibility to take care that such policy is faithfully adhered to rests directly with the chief or head of the government agency concerned



Section 102. Primary and secondary responsibility.  



1.	The head of any agency of the government is immediately and primarily responsible for all government funds and property pertaining to his agency.



2.	Persons entrusted with the possession or custody of the funds or property under the agency head shall be immediately responsible to him, without prejudice to the liability of either party to the government.



Section 69. Deposit of moneys in the treasury. 



1. Public officers authorized to receive and collect moneys arising from taxes, revenues, or receipts of any kind shall remit or deposit intact the full amounts so received and collected by them to the treasury of the agency concerned and credited to the particular accounts to which the said moneys belong.  The amount of the collections ultimately payable to other agencies of the government shall thereafter be remitted to the respective treasuries of these agencies, under regulations which the Commission and the Department (Ministry) of Finance shall prescribe. 



 X x x.



4. The respective treasuries of these agencies shall in turn deposit with the proper government depository the full amount of the collections not later than the following banking day.



	2)	Section 6 of Chapter 19 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, provides:



Sec. 6. Qualitative Characteristics of Financial Reporting.  An entity shall present information including accounting policies in a manner that meets the following qualitative characteristics enumerated in PPSAS 1:



X x x



e.	Reliability – reliable information is free from material error and bias, and can be depended on by users to represent faithfully that which it purports to represent or could reasonably be expected to represent.



f.	Faithful representation – information to represent faithfully transactions and other events, it should be presented in accordance with the substance of the transactions and other events, and not merely their legal form.



	3)	VSU commits to produce highly competent, quality and world-class manpower in science and technology, especially for agriculture, environmental management and industry who are proficient in communication skills, critical thinking and analytical abilities.  Thus, one of the objectives of VSU is to strive for excellence in agriculture education for regional and rural development.



	4)	VSU has five Rice Production Projects which reported the following sales for the year, as follows:

Table 45. Summary of observations noted on Rice Production Projects

Project Title

Audit Observations

DASS Rice and Other Food Products

1)	Collections from various rice and food products were not remitted to the Collecting Officer (CO) daily and intact with a time lag of one to 46 days contrary to Section 69 of PD No. 1445, thus exposing government funds and property to loss and misuse (see Annex G); 



2)	Fifty-two Order of Payments (OP), evidencing sale of products were not dated, thus it cannot be ascertained if these collections were deposited daily and intact to the Cashier (see Annex H); and



3)	Six OPs do not carry the signature of the buyer/receiver of goods in the “Received above goods/services” portion, hence it cannot be determined if the goods were indeed received in the same quantity and quality as reported (see Annex I).

Rice Field Project (VSUIHS)

1)	The reported sales of harvested palay could not be relied upon due to the absence of a valid supporting document representing sales thereof. 



The same reports were only supported with a photocopy of a list claimed to be written by a laborer in charge, tallying the number of sacks produced and the total amount which could not be validated due to the absence of specific details: the names of who prepared the report and whether the report was reviewed and approved by a supervisor who reviewed the report.  The reports were not in the proper format and written only in scrap paper.



2)	The harvested palay was sold to one specific buyer without considering other interested buyers thereby violating the Philippine Competition Act, which aims to enhance economic efficiency and promote free and fair competition in trade, industry and all commercial economic activities.



During interview, the Project Manager stated that the harvests were sold to one single buyer only, and it has already been their practice for many years.



It is emphasized that the harvested palay is part of the basic goods which can be processed/consumed by the general market, and should not be offered to an exclusive/ specified market.  This practice deprives other interested buyers of the opportunity to purchase government product and unduly stifles competition, lessens, manipulates or constricts the discipline of free markets.



3)	Collections from sales were not directly remitted to the Cashier for the issuance of Official Receipts but were used to defray expenses necessary in the production of the palay, such as labor wages and fertilizers.  The practice is highly irregular as procurement does not go through the usual disbursement procedures of government funds.  Only the remaining amount thereof was remitted to the Cashier.



There were no inspections conducted by the Inventory Committee as to the amount of palay harvested, sold and disposed.  It should be noted that the harvested products are government property and must be safeguarded accordingly.



Rice Seednet 





1)	Collections from the sales were not remitted to the Collecting Officer daily and intact, contrary to Section 69 of PD No. 1445. 



In an interview, the Project Manager explained that another person was delegated to receive collections, and to record in the logbook as proof of sale for the period from July to December 2020.  Eventually, when the total is of a significant amount, an OP is prepared and the collection is remitted to the Cashier.



2)	Ninety-two OPs, do not carry the signature of the buyer/receiver of goods in the “Received above goods/services” portion, hence it cannot be determined if the goods were indeed received in the same quantity and quality as reported (see Annex J); 



Patag Rice Production 

1)	The reported sales of harvested Palay could not be relied upon due to the absence of valid supporting documents representing sales thereof. 



The same reports were only supported with a photocopy of a list claimed to be written by a laborer in charge, tallying the number of sacks produced and the total amount which could not be validated due to the absence of specific details: the names of who prepared the report and whether the report was reviewed and approved by a supervisor who reviewed the report.  The reports were not in the proper format and written only in scrap paper.



2)	The OP was not attached to the Project Report.  Only the official receipts issued by the cashier were submitted, thus validation of the correctness of the reported sales could not be undertaken.



3)	There was no Monthly Report of Inventory submitted which could have supplied the data on the production, sales and disposal of the items.  Such data is necessary in validating and recomputing reported monthly sales.



Pangasugan-Marcos Rice Project

1)	The Summary of Sales, Collection and Remittances reports could not be relied upon due to the absence of any supporting document representing sales/disposal thereof.



2)	There was no Monthly Report of Inventory submitted which could have supplied the data on the production, sales and disposal of the items.  Such data is necessary in validating and recomputing reported monthly sales.





	6)	These reports were verified and found correct by the Internal Audit Office even with the apparent defects on the face of the reports and attachments.



	7)	All of the above deficiencies only give credence to the fact that basic internal control measures were not in place in the implementation of the rice production projects of VSU, thereby exposing government funds and property to the possible risks of loss and misuse.



	8)	We recommended that the President require the:



a)	Project Manager concerned to:



1)	remit all their collections to the Cashier’s Office daily and intact pursuant to Section 69 of PD No. 1445;



2)	prepare and accomplish correctly the OP with all the necessary data such as the actual date when the sale was made, and require the buyer to acknowledge the receipt of the product.



3)	request the Inventory Committee to conduct an inspection of every harvest to ascertain the existence and accuracy of actual production, and to validate all reports submitted by the Project Manager.



b)	Head of the Internal Audit Office to assess the existing internal control on the operations of the various IGF and BRF projects of VSU, particularly on the rice production projects and to recommend corrective measures so that government funds and resources are safeguarded against wastage, and misappropriation.



	9)	The Vice President for Planning, Resource Generation and Auxiliary Services accepted the audit recommendations and identified courses of actions to improve the monitoring and reporting of income from independent projects including the formulation of policies by the VSU Board of Management to streamline all projects whether classified as an IGP or as an STF.



	10)	The Project Managers promised to implement the recommendations on the observations noted.  The Manager of DASS Rice and Other Food Products Project reasoned that the delay in the remittance of collection was due to the leave of absence from December 14, 2019 to January 30, 2021 of the Farm In-charge and the one taking charge was not aware as to the policies/guidelines about remittance that he turned over the collections upon return of the Farm In-charge who immediately remitted to the cashier.  



	11)	Another contributing factor was the pre-occupation of the farm in-charge in the farm activities that he failed to remit said collection and waited until another collection was made thinking also that remittance every Monday or Friday especially during the COVID lock down was acceptable.



	12)	For Rice Seednet, the Project Manager commented that he designated a sales collection in-charge in the department to institute check and balance of the sales, to deal with the customers since the project manager has other functions (instruction, research, extension production) and for “delecadeza” on the part of the project manager.  However, he did not instruct the sales collection in-charge to report the sales the sales daily if there are any and remit immediately to the University Cashier.  The Project Manager assured that on the succeeding transactions, the sales will be remitted daily and will adhere to Sec. 29 of PD No. 1445.



	13)	For Patag Rice Production, it was explained that issuance of OP was not practiced during the previous management.  Nevertheless, the Project Manager is very much willing to issue an OP on the succeeding transactions.



	14)	The Principal of VSUIHS commented that the rice field is used in the laboratory field in Agriculture subjects for practical and experiential learning process in rice production.  The Farm Manager, Treasurer and Farmworker who are new in their respective functions adopted the old/usual practice of previous administration in the operation where certain amount of collection is retained as cash on hand to defray expenses necessary in the production of the palay such as seeds, labor wages and fertilizers while the remaining collections are then remitted to the Cashier for the issuance of official receipts.



	15)	Further, it was informed that financial report is prepared by the Treasurer regularly for clear updates but is submitted only to the Manager as VSUIHS was not asked/required to do so.  The Principal of VSUIHS however promised to follow the audit recommendations and to conduct appropriate actions for a valid and accurate Rice Production Report on sales, collections and remittances. 



	16)	We would like to emphasize that delegation of obligations should not be at the disposal of the Project Manager alone, but must be approved by the Head of Agency. Also, ignorance of the personnel on the basic safeguarding measures of the government funds is not a legitimate excuse. We would like to remind the management that persons entrusted with the possession or custody of the funds or property under the agency head shall be immediately responsible to him without prejudice to the liability of either party to the government.





	Limited functions of the OHIA

	

14)	The limited functions performed by the Office of the Head of Internal Audit (OHIA), which is an integral part of VSU, are not in accordance with the duties and responsibilities of the Office as prescribed under RA No. 3456, Administrative Order (AO) No. 278, and the revised Philippine Government Internal Audit Manual (PGIAM), thereby hindering an efficient and effective fiscal administration and not helping VSU in the performance of its affairs and functions.

	

	1)	Sections 2 and 3 of RA No. 3456 known as the Internal Auditing Act of 1962 dated June 16, 1962 has been amended by RA No. 4177 provides:

	

Sec. 2. There shall be created, organized and operated in all branches, subdivisions and instrumentalities of the government, including government-owned and/or controlled corporations to be known as agency for purposes of this Act, internal audit services which shall assist management to achieve an efficient and effective fiscal administration and performance of agency affairs and functions. (emphasis supplied)

Sec. 3. The Internal Audit Service shall be under the direct administrative supervision and control of the heads and/or assistant heads of the agency.  It shall be organized as an independent staff unit and shall correspondingly perform staff functions. It shall be responsible for instituting and conducting a program of internal audit for the agency.  The chief of the Internal Audit Service shall have the rank and salary equivalent to the third ranking official of the agency.  He shall report directly to the head or assistant head of the agency.

	2)	AO No. 278 dated April 28, 1992 provides:

	

	1.1 The Internal Audit Service (IAS) shall be an integral part of the office/organization and shall assist the institution management in the effective discharge of its responsibilities insofar as the same would not encroach on or be adversarial with those of the auditors of the Commission on Audit. X x x. The internal audit activities shall include the following: (emphasis supplied)

	

	1.1.1	Ascertaining the reliability and integrity of financial and operational information and the means used to identify, measure, classify and report such information;

	

	1.1.2	Ascertaining the extent of compliance and reviewing the systems established to ensure compliance with government policies, plans and procedures, laws and regulations which have impact on operations;

	

	1.1.3	Ascertaining the extent to which the assets and other resources of the institutions are accounted for and safeguarded from losses of all kinds;

	

	1.1.4	Reviewing and evaluating the soundness, adequacy and application of accounting, financial and other operating controls and promoting the most effective control at reasonable cost;

	

	1.1.5	Reviewing operations or programs to ascertain whether or not results are consistent with established objectives and goals and whether or not such programs are being carried out as planned;

	

	1.1.6	Evaluating the quality of performance of groups/individuals in carrying out their assigned responsibilities; and

	

	1.1.7	Recommending corrective actions on operational deficiencies observed.

	

	2.0	In addition to its above duties, the IAS may be called upon to perform special assignments by the Head of the Agency. However, it shall not be responsible for or required to participate in procedures which are essentially a part of regular operating activities or in operations which are the primary responsibility of another unit in the organization.  The IAS shall be detached from all functions of routine operating character, such as the following: (emphasis supplied)

	

	2.1 	Pre-audit of vouchers and counter-signature of checks;

	

	2.2 	Inspection of deliveries, although the internal auditor may, as part of his examination, observe inspection;

	

	2.3 	Preparation of treasury and bank reconciliation statements;

	

	2.4 	Development and installation of systems and procedures; however, in exceptional cases, the internal auditor may assist by way of giving suggestions;

	

	2.5	Taking physical inventories; however, the internal auditor may review the plans in advance and observe and test-check the accuracy of counting, costing and summarizing;

	

	2.6 	Maintaining property records; and

	

	2.7 	All other activities related to operations.



	3)	VSU maintains four external campuses which include: Alangalang, Isabel, Tolosa and Villaba, having a centralized fiscal operations and administration with four types of fund clusters namely: 01-Regular Agency Fund (RAF), 05-Income Generating Fund (IGF), 06-Business Related Fund (BRF) and 07-Inter-Agency Trust Fund (IATF).



	4)	Presently, the organizational structure and/set-up of VSU reveals that it has an Office of the Head for Internal Audit (OHIA) under the Office of the University President.



	5)	Interview with the Head of the OHIA and the evaluation of VSU’s implementation of internal audit services revealed the following:



a)	The VSU’s OHIA performs routine functions limited only to:



--	Post-audit of the FC 05-IATF and FC 06-BRF projects

--	Sending of confirmation letters to various debtors of FC 05-IATF and FC 06-BRF projects

--	Preparing official letters to concerned VSU officials for the excess phone subsidy



b)	Lack of Manpower Complement – there exists an inadequate number of staff properly equipped with an internal audit background, training and competencies.  The VSU OHIA is composed only of three personnel, including the Head and two staff members: one regular and one job order employee.



	6)	During the interview, the Director of OHIA also mentioned that the Department of Budget and Management (DBM)’s list of internal audit functions is very broad.  In this matter, the Audit Team would like to invite the Head of OHIA to take note of the following provisions of the Philippine Government Internal Audit Manual (PGIAM):



3. 	Scope of Internal Audit



3.1 Scope



Internal audit is an integral part of the internal control system of public service organizations. The scope of internal audit is broad and involves all matters relating to operations and management control.



Among others, internal audit encompasses the appraisal of the adequacy of internal controls, the conduct of management audit and the evaluation of the results of operations, focusing on the effectiveness of controls of operating systems and support services units/systems. (emphasis supplied)



3.2 Functions of IAS/IAU



Pursuant to the Administrative Code of 1987, and as reiterated in the NGICS, the functions of the IAS/IAU are as follows: 



a.	Advise the DS/HoA or in the case of GOCCs/GFIs, the Governing Body through the Audit Committee, on all matters relating to management control and operations audits;



b.	Conduct management and operations audits of Department/ Agency/GOCC/GFI functions, programs, projects, activities with outputs, and determine the degree of compliance with their mandate, policies, government regulations, established objectives, systems and procedures/processes and contractual obligations;



c.	Review and appraise systems and procedures, organizational structures, asset management practices, financial and management records, reports and performance standards of the department proper, bureaus and regional offices;



d.	Analyze and evaluate management deficiencies and assist top management by recommending realistic courses of action; and



e)	Perform such other related duties and responsibilities as may be assigned or delegated by the Secretary or the Governing Board or as may be required by law.

	

	7)	While the PGIAM enumerates the functions of the OHIA to include all matters relating to operations and management control, the actual functions performed by the OHIA of VSU is only confined partly to the financial audit of FC 05-BRF and FC 06-IGF projects.  This is not in consonance with the Office’s mandate of assisting management in achieving an efficient and effective fiscal administration and performance of agency affairs and functions.  Likewise, post-audit of the above projects disclosed deficiencies in the operations and management of the FC 05-BRF and FC 06-IGF projects, which were thoroughly discussed in separate audit observations.

	

	8)	The role of the Internal Auditor is not about fault-finding, neither is it investigative nor punitive.  As a component of the performance management framework of VSU, the OHIA should have assessed the levels of performance against agreed measures, targets and objectives, and reported on this assessment.  The internal audit function is separate from, but complementary to, the day-to-day monitoring of internal controls and the conduct of continual management improvement, which are within the responsibility of operating units.

	

	9)	Moreover, the PGIAM tasks the Commission on Audit with evaluating the adequacy of the OHIA as part of the Internal Control System (ICS), which in the course of evaluating the ICS, COA may request for the following reports: 

	

i)		Internal Audit Memorandum;

ii)		Baseline Assessment of the Internal Control System;

iii)		Assessment of Control Significance and Materiality and Control Risk;

iv)		Assessment of Internal Audit Risk;

v)		Annual Internal Audit Plan;

vi)		Internal Audit Report;

vii)		Internal Audit Follow-up Report; and 

viii)		Performance Monitoring Evaluation Report



	10)	Upon inquiring with the Head of OHIA if the above enumerated reports were prepared, she mentioned that only the Annual Internal Audit Plan was prepared.  A copy of the said report was requested but to no avail.



	11)	It is worthy to mention that VSU, despite reporting notable accomplishments, still had deficiencies noted during the audit.  These deficiencies or breakdowns in internal control could have been minimized had the OHIA conducted a periodic evaluation on the adequacy of the existing ICS of VSU and suggested corrective measures.



	12)	While it is the direct responsibility of the agency head to install, implement and monitor a sound system of internal control, the OHIA assists him by conducting a separate evaluation of the ICS to determine if controls are well designed and properly implemented.



	13)	Considering the bulk of transactions and the increasing number of government programs/projects/activities to be implemented every year, VSU needs all the assistance it can get in the achievement of efficient and effective fiscal management and performance of its affairs, operations and functions.



	14)	We recommended that President:



a)	define and discuss the functions and responsibilities of the OHIA to conform with the provisions of RA No. 4177 dated March 26, 1965, the AO No. 278 s. 1992, and the revised PGIAM so that the discharge of the Office’s duties of overseeing the adequacy of internal control processes, conducting internal management audit and evaluating of the results of operations of the operating systems and support units can be efficiently implemented;



b)	provide OHIA with an adequate number of staff properly equipped with an internal audit background, training and competencies.



	15)	The VSU President in his written reply stated that the provisions for the functions and responsibilities of OHIA under RA No. 4177 dated March 26, 1965, AO No. 278 s. 1992, and the revised PGAIM were already discussed with the Head of OHIA.  Also, the Head of OHIA was reminded of the BOR approved functions of 2019 Organizational Structures, which was based on DBM and CSC Executive Committee on the Rationalization Program, Resolution No. 1 Series of 2006, adopted in May 12, 2006.  In line with this, Memorandum No. 422 from the Office of the President was released.



	16)	Moreover, the VSU President also commented that they will request with the DBM for additional two positions, as requested by the Head of OHIA.





	GPB and GAD AR not submitted to COA Audit Team for validation



15)	The Gender and Development (GAD) Accomplishment Report (AR) for CY 2020 was not submitted to the COA Audit Team for validation, contrary to COA Circular No. 2014-001 dated March 18, 2014 and the Philippine Commission on Women (PCW) Memorandum Circular (MC) No. 2021-01 dated January 20, 2021.



	1)	Item V of COA Circular No. 2014-001 (Revised Guidelines in the audit of GAD Funds and Activities in government agencies) dated March 18, 2014 provides:



	V.  RESPONSIBILITY OF THE AUDITED AGENCY

	

The Audited agency shall submit a copy of the Annual GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) to the COA Audit Team assigned to the agency within five (5) working days from the receipt of the approved plan from the PCW or their mother or central offices as the case may be.  Likewise, a copy of the corresponding Accomplishment Report shall be furnished the said Audit Team within five (5) working days from the end of January of the preceding year.(Emphasis supplied)

	

	2)	PCW MC No. 2021-01 dated January 20, 2021 states:

	

1)		All line departments, constitutional bodies, judicial and legislative bodies, attached agencies/bureaus, other executive offices (OEOs) and government-owned and/or controlled corporations (GOCCs) shall submit their FY 2020 GAD Accomplishment Reports (ARs) to PCW through the PCW Gender Mainstreaming Monitoring System (GMMS) on or before the following date:

	

	26 February 2021

	Deadline of state universities and colleges (SUCs) for the encoding and submission of FY 2020 GAD AR through the GMMS, for review of Commission on Higher Education (CHED) regional offices

	

	3)	Verification of the GAD programs disclosed that the management failed to submit the required GAD AR for CY 2020 as well its supporting documents.



	4)	The GAD Focal Person submitted via email a soft copy of the report to the Audit Team but this was not signed by the preparer and the approving officer, thus the veracity and reliability of its contents could not be ascertained.



	5)	The absence of the printed and signed GAD AR has resulted in the difficulty in monitoring the utilization of GAD funds in the University, as well as assessing whether GAD activities were aligned and contributed to the full attainment of the programs, activities, and projects identified in the GPB.



	6)	This is a reiteration of previous year’s audit. 



	7)	We recommended that the President require the GAD Focal Person to immediately submit the approved and signed GAD Accomplishment Reports with the supporting documents to the Audit Team for verification.  Henceforth, submit a copy of the report within five working days from the end of January of the preceding year, pursuant to COA Circular No. 2014-001.



	8)	In the reply submitted by the GAD Focal Person, it was pointed that the requirement of COA that VSU submit a copy of the GAD AR within five working days from the end of January of the preceding year, pursuant to COA Circular No. 2014-001 is unrealistic because uploading of the GAD AR in the GMMS can only be done when it is opened for submission usually towards the end of January of the following year.  Moreover, transactions involving the GPB and GAD AR are only official when done through the GMMS and they can only submit a printed, signed copy of the GAD AR when it is returned in final form in the GMMS. Notwithstanding, she submitted a printed and signed copy of the 2020 GAD AR but not in its final form since it is still under review.  The VSU GAD Resource Center (GRC) also commits to prepare and submit to COA VSU Team an annual GAD AR that may or may not be uploaded to the GMMS and as such may not be generated from the GMMS and therefore unofficial, although signed by the concerned officials, within five working days from the end of January.



	9)	The Audit Team take note of the comment of the GAD Focal person of the Management.  However, COA Circular No. 2014-001 clearly provides that a copy of the corresponding Accomplishment Report shall be furnished the said Audit Team within five working days from the end of January of the preceding year. Thus, the Management is required to submit the AR notwithstanding its status in the GMMS. This is also to aid the Audit Team to conduct a timely review.
