EXECUTIVE SUMMARY





A)	Introduction



Visayas State University (VSU) was established on June 2, 1924 as the Baybay Agricultural School through a Provincial Board Resolution.  In 1934, it was renamed Baybay Agricultural High School and was later converted into the Baybay National Agricultural School (BNAS) with the approval of Commonwealth Act No. 313 in 1938.  BNAS was converted into the Visayas Agricultural College by virtue of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 2831 dated June 19, 1960.



The institution attained rapid growth and development following its conversion into Visayas State College of Agriculture (ViSCA) on May 24, 1974 through P.D. No. 470 and amended by P.D. No. 700 on May 12, 1975.  In 1999, four institutions of higher education in the Province of Leyte were integrated into the College to create a five-campus ViSCA system.



ViSCA became Leyte State University (LSU) through RA No. 9158 issued on August 11, 2001.  The enactment of R.A. No. 9437 dated April 27, 2007 converted the then LSU into Visayas State University (VSU).  The Main Campus is located in Barangay Pangasugan, Baybay City, while the external campuses are located in Isabel, Villaba, Tolosa and Alang-Alang, Leyte.  Other two field offices are in Cebu and Manila.



The audit covered the review of accounts and operations of VSU for CY 2020.  The audit was conducted to: a) ascertain the propriety of transactions as well as the extent of compliance on the applicable laws, rules and regulations; b) ascertain the level of assurance that may be placed on the management’s assertions on the financial statements; and                    c) determine the extent of implementation of prior years’ audit recommendations.

D)	Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations



	The following are the significant audit observations and recommendations which are discussed in detail in Part II of this Report:



1)		Cash advances totaling P1,013,160.73 have remained unliquidated as of December 31, 2020, contrary to Section 89 of PD No. 1445 and COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997, thereby exposing cash to possible risks of misapplication or misappropriation.  Likewise, an unreconciled difference in balances of the Advances to Special Disbursing Officer (SDO) and the Advances for Operating Expenses totaling P639,406.49 was noted between the GL and the SL of the Main and the Tolosa Campuses, respectively, contrary to Sections 89 and 111 of PD No. 1445, thus affecting the fair presentation of the accounts in the financial statements.

	

	We recommended that the President require:



a)	All officers and employees concerned to liquidate immediately their outstanding cash advances; and henceforth, to strictly adhere to the pertinent provisions on the granting, utilization and liquidation of cash advances in compliance with COA Circular No. 97-002;



b)	The Accountants concerned to:



1)	closely monitor the liquidation of outstanding cash advances to avoid the accumulation of unliquidated balances as of year- end and;



2)	send demand letters to Accountable Officers with outstanding cash advances to facilitate liquidation in order to avoid misapplication of funds.



3)	reconcile their individual records in order to detect valid reconciling items so that necessary adjusting entries can be effected promptly and thereafter, conduct a periodic reconciliation with VSU Main Campus to come up with an accurate and reliable balances of the affected accounts.

	

2)		The procurement of supplies & materials to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 and for other purposes totaling P360,219.00  was  made through cash advances, contrary to Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB) Resolution No. 03-2020 dated March 9, 2020, GPPB Circular 04-2016 dated 20 December 2016, and the COA and GPPB Joint Memorandum Circular No. 1 dated March 26, 2020.



	We recommended that President require the:

d)	Accountants to review the completeness of all supporting documents submitted to liquidate their cash advances;



	

3)		Inconsistencies in the implementation of the Expanded Modified Direct Payment Scheme (ExMDPS) for Accounts Payable in settling obligations has caused the payment of ₱730,737,136.53 or 95.65% of the VSU’s obligations to be paid in checks, contrary to DBM Circular Letter Nos. 2013-16 dated December 23, 2013, and DBM Circular Letter No. 2018-14 dated December 28, 2018, thus defeating the DBM Circular Letters’ objective to have a more efficient payment system.

	

	We recommended that President require the Cashier to:



a)	adopt strictly the ExMDPS for the payment of all Accounts Payable due to all its creditors and refrain from using checks for disbursement for a more efficient and economical payment system; and



b)	advice all creditors/payees to open a current or savings account with any branch of their authorized Modified Disbursement System, Government Servicing Banks (MDS-GSB) .



4)		Disbursement vouchers, payrolls and their supporting documents for transactions totalling P280,916,905.83 have remained unsubmitted as of April 6, 2021 incurring delays ranging from 86 to 420 days, contrary to Sections 100 and 107 of PD No. 1445, and COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009, thus precluding the Audit Team from conducting prompt audit of the accounts and financial transactions for the earlier detection and correction of errors/deficiencies and for a timely reporting of audit results to the management.

	

	We recommended that the President require the Accountant, the Cashiers and the Disbursing Officers concerned to:

 

a)	submit immediately the lacking DVs together with their supporting documents totaling P280,916,905.83, and henceforth enjoin the concerned personnel to consistently observe the submission of accounts and financial reports within the reglementary period pursuant to COA Circular No. 2009-006, Sections 100 and 107 of PD 1445 and pertinent provisions of COA Circular No. 95-006; and

5)		The reasonableness and appropriateness of expenditures for food procured during trainings, meetings and other events totaling P7,361,312.75 could not  be ascertained due to incomplete supporting documents, and to various other deficiencies noted in audit, contrary to Section 4 of PD No. 1445, COA Circular 2012-003 and RIRR of RA No. 9184.

	

	We recommended that the President require all department heads concerned to:

6)		The validity and accuracy of the Sales, Collection and Remittances of various Rice Production Projects could not be ascertained because of the absence of a sound internal control system over the implementation of these projects, contrary to the pertinent provisions of PD No. 1445 thereby exposing government funds and property to the possible risks of loss and misuse.

	

We recommended that the President require the:



a)	Project Manager concerned to:



1)	remit all their collections to the Cashier’s Office daily and intact pursuant to Section 69 of PD No. 1445;



2)	prepare and accomplish correctly the OP with all the necessary data such as the actual date when the sale was made, and require the buyer to acknowledge the receipt of the product.
