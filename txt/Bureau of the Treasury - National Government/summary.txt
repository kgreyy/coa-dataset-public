EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

 

A. Introduction 
 

The Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) is mandated under various laws and issuances to 

carry out, among others, two main programs, namely:  management of the cash 

resources of the National Government (NG); and, control and servicing of its public 

debt, both foreign and domestic.   

  

The BTr is headed by the Treasurer of the Philippines (TOP), Ms. Rosalia V. De Leon, 

assisted by three Deputy Treasurers of the Philippines (DTOP) namely: 

 

Atty. Gisela F. Lood  Planning and Policy Sub-sector under 

which are the Administrative, Legal and  

Management Information Services  

 

Ms. Sharon P. Almanza Operations Sub-sector which manages 

the Asset Management Services (AMS) 

and Auxiliary Sub-sector which 

encompasses Research and Accounting 

Services  

 

Atty. Erwin Sta. Ana Operations Sub-sector for Liability 

Management Services (LMS) and 

Regional Offices 

 

 

The services involved in the NG operations are the LMS, AMS and Accounting Service 

(AS) and each service composed of six divisions headed by Division Chiefs.  The LMS 

undertakes the fund-raising activities to finance central government operations; 

engages market participants in discussions/consultations on the government’s issuance 

programs, capital market reforms/initiatives and resolution of industry issues affecting 

the fixed-income market and recommends appropriate debt management strategies, 

policies, plans and programs to effectively manage the risk exposures of NG. Further, 

the AMS ensures the availability of funds to finance NG budgetary requirements; 

maximizes the earnings of NG’s funds through timely and effective investment of idle 

cash balances in high yielding deposits; administers and manages effectively the special 

purpose funds and implements the policy of zero cash balance in the Treasury Vault by 

depositing all collections during the day to the Authorized Government Depository 

Banks/s.  On the other hand, the AS directs and supervises the accounting for all 

receipts and disbursements of the NG which include national collections and budgetary 

expenditures, foreign and domestic obligations, including backpay and emergency 

guerilla currency notes.

The NG’s total income in CY 2020 increased by 19 per cent from last year’s income. 

On the other hand, total expenses increased by P572.042 billion or 15 per cent. 

However, the increase in expenses was more significant than the increase in income in 

terms of amount. Thus, this year’s Net Loss of P3.981 trillion is higher by 15 per cent 

compared to last year’s Net Loss of P3.460 trillion.  

 

As at December 31, 2020, total NG liabilities amounted to P10.067 trillion which 

includes P6.932 trillion or 68.86 per cent in domestic debts and P3.135 trillion or 31.14 

per cent in foreign obligations.    

 

Contingent debt of the NG, composed mainly of guarantees issued by the NG as at 

December 31, 2020, amounted to P454.102 billion of which 44 per cent came from 

foreign obligations of P199.816 billion. The foreign obligations for CY 2020 increased 

by 18.20 per cent or P482.650 billion as compared to the balance reported in CY 2019 

as restated.

management’s assertion on the financial statements (FSs); (b) determine the propriety 

of transactions, as well as the extent of the agency’s compliance with laws, rules, and 

regulations; (c) recommend agency improvement opportunities; and, (d) determine

F. Summary of Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations 
 

Among the audit observations and corresponding recommendations discussed in Part 

II of this report, the significant observations are summarized as follows: 

 

1. Various accounting errors in the keeping of the accounts had resulted in the 
misstatements in some assets, liabilities and equity accounts. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the concerned 

personnel of the National Cash Accounting Division (NCAD)/National 

Government Debt Accounting Division (NGDAD)/Miscellaneous Accounts 

Accounting Division (MAAD)/Bank Reconciliation and Analysis Division 

(BRAD) to analyze the related transactions and prepare the necessary 

adjusting journal entries to correct the aforementioned errors; and 

henceforth, observe the proper/correct recognition of accounts and 

transactions in accordance with the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) 

for National Government Agencies (NGAs) and other applicable rules and 

regulations. 

 

2. Unverified remittances of the idle/unutilized funds by the NGAs from CYs 2014 
and 2019 of P15.117 billion and P15.111 billion, respectively, were at risk of 

unauthorized use and had not provided funds for the NG’s operations, if unremitted 

to the BTr. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed  to require the Chief, NCAD to; 

(a) exercise its functions and responsibilities in the monitoring of remittances 

of idle/unutilized cash balances of all NGAs, such as through direct 

coordination with the heads of agencies on the appropriate actions for the 

idle/unremitted funds; (b) make use of the yearly Annual Audit Reports on the 

NGAs to serve as bases in the monitoring of the idle/unutilized funds  for 

remittance to the BTr; (c) coordinate with the NGAs with reported 

idle/unutilized funds to facilitate immediate remittance of such funds to the 

BTr; and (d) coordinate regularly with the BTr-Regional Offices 

(ROs)/Provincial Offices (POs), pending the implementation of the National 

Government Collection and Disbursement System, for the submission of 

reports on idle/unutilized fund remittances of the NGAs for  monitoring of 

fund balances. 

 

3. Discrepancies in Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, Special Account and Cash-
Treasury/Agency Deposit, Trust of P28.305 billion and P4.301 billion, respectively, 

between the BTr-NG books and NGAs’ confirmed balances, and unconfirmed 

balances of P125.079 billion and P18.297 billion for Special Fund in the General 

Fund (SAGF) and Trust Receipts (TRs), respectively, precluded the determination 

of the existence and accuracy of the account balances. 



v 

 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief, BRAD, in 

coordination with the Chief, NCAD to: (a) determine the cause/s of 

discrepancies between the BTr-NG books and NGAs’ records and ensure the 

proper recognition of the collections received and releases made; and  

(b) adjust immediately all identified reconciling items to come up with the 

correct balances of the affected accounts. 

 

We also recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief, BRAD 

to: (a) confirm with concerned NGAs the SAGFs and TRs with zero balances 

as confirmed by the Auditors, and close the accounts accordingly; and  

(b) continue the reconciliation of SAGFs and TRs with the NGAs to facilitate 

adjustments of the accounts affected. 

 

4. Absence of documents supporting the existence of inactive/dormant receivables of 
P185.949 million precluded the determination of the existence and accuracy of the 

balance of Other Receivables. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Chief, BRAD to: 

(a) prepare the request for the write-off of inactive/dormant accounts of 

P10.390 million in accordance with the guidelines set forth in COA Circular 

2016-005; (b) continue to fast track the verification of the dormant/inactive 

accounts for proper closure of the non-existing accounts, if any; and  

(c)  monitor regularly the status of other receivable accounts, in particular, 

those with pending appeals, to respond immediately and properly to the results 

of the appeals. 

 

We also recommended and Management agreed to require the Director, LS 

to: (a) communicate with the Office of the Solicitor General to update the 

status of the pending cases with the appropriate courts; and (b) provide 

updates on the status of the receivables with pending cases to the Chief, BRAD 

for proper documentation and disposition. 

 

5. Non-provision of allowance for impairment of receivable accounts and investments 
in Government-Owned or Controlled Corporations (GOCCs) did not reflect the true 

carrying value of the NG receivables in the Statement of Financial Position.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to ensure that the Directors/ 

Chiefs, Asset Management Service, Legal Service, NGDAD, and MAAD:  

(a) assess the provision of allowance for impairment on outstanding 

receivables of NG financial assets and make an annual assessment of the 

impairment thereafter; and (b) require the concerned Chiefs of Accounting 

Divisions to make the appropriate entries in the books for the allowance for 

impairment based on the assessment made.

views and comments were incorporated in the report, where appropriate. 

 

G. Statement of Audit Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges
