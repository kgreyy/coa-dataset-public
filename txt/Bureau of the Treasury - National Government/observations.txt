OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

 

Financial Audit 

 

Accounting errors and omissions 

 

1. Various accounting errors and omissions in the keeping of the accounts had 
resulted in the misstatements in some assets, liabilities and equity accounts. 

 

The International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSASs) 1 provides 

that financial statements (FSs) shall present fairly the financial position, financial 

performance, and cash flows of an entity.  Fair presentation requires the faithful 

presentation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance 

with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and 

expenses set out in the IPSASs.  The application of IPSASs, with additional disclosure, 

when necessary, is presume to result in FSs that achieve a fair presentation. 

 

Section 111 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 requires the agency, among 

others, to keep its accounts in such detail as necessary to meet the needs of the agency 

and to observe the highest standards of honesty, objectivity, and consistency in the 

keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate or misleading information. 

 

Analysis of the accounts and the related Journal Entry Vouchers (JEVs) and 

supporting documents revealed accounting errors arising from erroneous recognition 

and measurement of transactions affecting various accounts, as shown in Table 1.

On Time Deposit-Local Currency and Investment in Time Deposits-Local Currency 

 

a. Erroneous recognition of time deposits in local currency - P15 billion 
 

Under the old Revised Chart of Accounts (RCA), authorized placements of cash 

in local currency with Authorized Government Depository Banks (AGDBs), 

regardless of the placement duration, are recognized under the Cash in Bank-Local 

Currency, Time Deposit. However, under the new RCA, placements with the AGDBs 

for a period not exceeding 90 days shall be recognized under Time Deposits-Local 

Currency while placements for 91 days or more shall be recognized under Investments 

in Time Deposits-Local Currency. 

 

A Matrix of Deficiencies and Errors was issued last February 1, 2021, to remind 

the Accounting Service (AS) of the adoption of the new RCA. In compliance, the 

NCAD prepared JEV No. 01-2020-12-15223 dated December 31, 2020, recognizing 

the conversion of the Cash in Bank-Local Currency, Time Deposit to Investments in 

Time Deposits-Local Currency. However, it was noted that all the time deposit 

balances, regardless of their duration, were reclassified under Investment in Time 

Deposits-Local Currency and none under the Time Deposits-Local Currency.  

 

Moreover, review of the placements in time deposits in local currency as at 

December 31, 2020 disclosed that all time deposits have placement periods of more 

than 91 days except the time deposit under Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) 

placement number DP-2012-00019445 of P15 billion for only 31 days.  

 

The time deposit of P15 billion was recognized under Investment in Time 

Deposits-Local Currency instead of under the Time Deposits-Local Currency   

resulting in the overstatement and understatement of the accounts, respectively, by 

P15 billion. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief, NCAD to 

validate the placement period of the time deposits with the deal tickets issued by 

AGDBs before recognizing the same in the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr)-NG 

books to facilitate proper recognition of transactions. 
 

The NCAD already recognized the adjusting entry for the reclassification of 

time deposits of P15 billion under JEV No. 01-2021-03-02628 dated March 31, 2021 

to correct the balances of the affected accounts. 

 

On Bond Sinking Fund 
 

a. Erroneous computation of interests on investments in T-Bills acquired in CY 2019 
and sold/redeemed in CY 2020; and acquired and sold in CY 2020 

 

a.1 Erroneous computation of interests on investments in T-Bills acquired in CY 
2019 and sold/redeemed in CY 2020 - P23.755 million 



78 
 

As at December 31, 2019, accrued interest on investments in T-Bills, with a 

total face amount of P38.307 billion, totaled P1.373 billion. However, examination of 

the documents revealed that the accrued interest was computed using the 360-day year 

method instead of the 365-day year method such that accrued interest would have been 

recognized at P1.396 billion, or a difference of P22.694 million. 
 

Examination of the JEVs for CY 2020 showed that out of the investments 

outstanding as at December 31, 2020, P34.593 billion were held and redeemed at 

maturity, while P3.714 billion were sold before maturity. The investments that were 

redeemed at maturity included accrued interest in CY 2019 of only P1.287 billion 

which was recognized in CY 2019, instead of P1.309 billion had it been computed 

correctly, or a difference of P21.375 million. In CY 2020, the difference of P21.375 

million was recognized in the books under Interest Income instead of Accumulated 

Surplus/(Deficit)  resulting in the overstatement of Interest Income by P21.375 million. 

 

For the investments of P3.714 billion that were sold before maturity, 

comparison of accrued interest as at December 31, 2019 and interest income 

recognized at the date of sale is presented in the following table: 

 
          Table 2: Accrued interest and interest income for investments sold before maturity 

Particulars Per Accounting Per Audit Difference 

Accrued interest as at December 31, 

2019 

P  85,643,653.85 P86,961,944.63 (P1,318,290.78) 

Interest income until date of sale 14,822,376.91 12,442,554.52 2,379,822.39 

Total P100,466,030.76 P99,404,499.16 P 1,061,531.60 

 

Based on the preceding table, the interest income recognized at the date of sale 

of investments was higher by P2.380 million due to the erroneous computation of the 

interest income, thus overstating Interest Income by the same amount. Further, loss on 

such sales of investments amounted to P92.085 million. Per record, total interest 

throughout the life of the investments before the sale was P100.466 million, which 

was P1.062 million more had the computation of accrued interest in CY 2019 been 

based on the 365-day year method. Considering that interests on investments form part 

of the carrying amount of the investment which is compared to the sales proceeds in 

order to determine the gain or loss on sale of investments, higher interest results in 

lower gain on sale or higher loss on sale, as the case may be. Therefore, the 

abovementioned overstatement in Interest Income resulted in the overstatement of 

Loss on Sale of Investment by P1.062 million. 

 

Overall, the erroneous computation of interest on investments in T-Bills 

acquired in CY 2019 resulted in the overstatement of Interest Income and Loss on Sale 

of Investments presented in the Statement of Financial Performance (SFPer) for the 

year ended December 31, 2020 by P23.755 million and P1.062 million, respectively; 

and understatement of Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) presented in the Statement of 

Financial Position (SFPos) as at December 31, 2020 by P1.062 million. 

 



79 
 

a.2 Erroneous computation of interests on investments in T-Bills acquired and sold 
in CY 2020 - P6.462 million 

 

T-Bills acquired in CY 2020 with a total face amount of P11.532 billion were 

sold in the same year prior to maturity.  The total interest income and gain on such 

sale amounted to P80.992 million and P86.429 million, presented as follows: 
 

Selling Price of the Investments  P11,406,643,897.09 

Carrying Value of the Investments:   

Purchase Price P11,239,222,880.93  

Interest Income 80,992,287.41 11,320,215,168.34 

Gain on Sale of Investments  P       86,428,728.75 

 

Audit of the JEVs pertaining to the above sale disclosed 13 deal tickets where 

interest income were computed using the 360-day year method, instead of the 365-day 

year method to come up with the carrying value of the investments of P11.320 billion. 

Interest income on the said deal tickets amounted to P31.970 million using the 360-

day year method and P38.432 million using the 365-day year method, or a difference 

of P6.462 million. Having used the 360-day year method in the computation of 

interests further resulted in the decrease in the carrying value of investments sold by 

P6.462 million, thereby resulting to the recognition of higher gains on sales of 

investments.  

 

Consequently, Interest Income and Gain on Sale of Investments were 

understated and overstated, respectively, by P6.462 million. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief, MAAD 

to compute interest on investments in T-Bills using the 365-day year method to 

ensure accuracy of the balance of all affected accounts upon accrual, redemption 

or sale of such investments. 

 

b. Erroneous computation of accrued interests on investments in Treasury Bonds (T-
Bonds) and ROP Dollar Bonds classified as available-for-sale  

 

b.1 Erroneous computation of accrued interests from investments in T-Bonds 
classified as AFS - P3.922 million 

 

Examination of the documents supporting the recognition of accrued interest on 

investments in T-Bonds as at December 31, 2020 disclosed differences in coupon rates 

and last interest payment dates. The coupon rate indicated in the fixed income deal 

ticket for FXTN 03-25 was 2.3750 per cent. However, the accrued interest was 

computed using 3.6250 per cent. Hence, the recognition of the interest, net of tax, of 

P54.257 million instead of P35.547 million or an overstatement by P18.709 million. 

Further, the last interest payment date for RTB 05-13 was November 12, 2020, so that 

there are still 49 days to consider for the accrual of interest. Nonetheless, the last 

interest payment date indicated in the computation was December 12, 2020 or 19 days 

up to reporting date. As a result, interest, net of tax, was recognized at only P9.365 

million instead of P24.153 million, or an understatement by P14.788 million. 



80 
 

As a result of the above errors, accrued interest recognized in the books as at 

December 31, 2020 was higher by P3.922 million compared to the Audit Team’s 

recomputation, as shown in the following table: 

 
Table 3. Computation of Overstatement 

Particulars Per Accounting Per Audit Variance 

Gross Interest P 7,630,999,019.45 P 7,626,096,927.77 P 4,902,091.68 

Withholding Tax 1,526,199,803.89 1,525,219,385.55 980,418.34 

Interest Net of Tax P 6,104,799,215.56 P 6,100,877,542.22 P 3,921,673.34 

 

Consequently, Interests Receivable and Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) 

presented in the SFPos as at December 31, 2020 were overstated by P3.922 million. 

Furthermore, the Interest Income and Taxes, Duties, and Licenses presented in the 

SFPer for the year ended December 31, 2020 are overstated by P4.902 million and 

P0.980 million, respectively. 

 

b.2 Erroneous computation of accrued interests from investments in ROP Dollar 
Bond classified as AFS - P87.808 million 

 

Accrued interest on investments in the ROP dollar bond classified as AFS 

amounted to P250.536 million. However, based on our recomputation, accrued 

interest on the same investments as at December 31, 2020 totaled P338.344 million, 

or a difference of P87.808 million.  

 

Analysis of the accrual of interest showed two errors in the computation of 

accrued interest resulting to the said difference. First, interest on some investments 

were accrued from the investment date up to the reporting date only, thus excluding 

the days from last payment date up to the investment date. Thus, after computing the 

accrued interest from investment date to reporting date of P250.536 million, the SL 

balance before accrual of P76.156 million was deducted and the difference of 

P174.380 million was the amount recognized as accrued interest. 

 

Second, there were noted differences in the coupon rate and the last payment 

dates which served as the starting date in computing the accrued interest. Based on the 

fixed income deal ticket, the coupon rates for ROP 30 and 31 are 9.5 per cent and 

7.750 per cent, respectively, but the rate used in computing the accrued interest was 

2.457 percent for both securities. Further, the last interest payment dates for ROP 30, 

31 and 37 were August 2, 2020, July 14, 2020 and July 3, 2020, respectively, but based 

on the computation, accrual of interest started on September 18, 2020, July 11, 2020 

and September 11, 2020, respectively. Combining the effects of the two errors resulted 

to accrued interest of P250.536 million, instead of P338.344 million.  

 

As a result, Interests Receivable and Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) presented 

in the SFPos as at December 31, 2020, and Interest Income presented in the SFPer for 

the year ended December 31, 2020 are understated by P87.808 million. 

 



81 
 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief, MAAD 

to use the prescribed coupon rates and applicable starting dates in the accrual of 

interest on investments in ROP Dollar Bond. 

 

On Bonds Payable-Domestic 

 

a. Erroneous computation of accrued interests on outstanding reissued T-Bonds - 
P1.048 billion 

 

As at December 31, 2020, total accrued interest on outstanding T-Bonds was 

reported at P66.968 billion, of which P2.207 billion pertains to reissued T-Bonds. 
Examination of documents supporting the computation of accrued interest for reissued 

T-Bonds disclosed that various outstanding reissued T-Bonds were reissued beyond 

the last coupon payment dates. However, the accrued interest was calculated from the 

last payment date instead of the reissue date to the reporting date.  

 

Recomputation of accrued interest from the reissue date up to the reporting date 

showed a total of P1.159 billion, which is lesser by P1.048 billion compared to the 

recognized accrued interest on reissued T-Bonds. Consequently, Interest Expenses and 

Interest Payable are overstated by P1.048 billion. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief, NGDAD 

to consider the date of reissuance of T-Bonds to reporting date in the accrual of 

interest on re-issued T-Bonds at year-end.  

 

On Interest Income on NG Deposits  

 

a. Double recognition of interest receivables - P903.155 million 
 

The Treasury Single Account (TSA) maintained with the BSP caters to all NG 

collections such as General Fund (GF), Special Accounts, Bond Sinking Fund (BSF), 

Security Stabilization Fund (SSF), Special Guarantee Fund (SGF) and managed funds 

or escrow funds under Due to NGAs, Due to GOCCs and Other Payables. The interests 

on the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas-Treasurer of the Philippines-Treasury Single 

Account (BSP-TOP-TSA) and other accounts with the BSP are computed quarterly.  

The NCAD initially records interests in lump-sum amount. Then, the MAAD, which 

handles the transactions pertaining to the BSF, SSF, equities and subsidies to GOCCs, 

escrow accounts and managed funds, reclassifies the shares of the escrow funds in the 

interest to the respective Due to NGAs, Due to GOCCs and Other Payables accounts. 

 

In previous years, the NCAD and MAAD recognized the interest income as 

received and its effects on the related accounts at the transaction date. However, in 

CY 2019, the Audit Team recommended that Management need to recognize the 

transactions in accordance with the accrual method of accounting by setting-up 

interest receivable and recognizing the effects in the corresponding accounts.  

 



82 
 

Verification of Management’s action on the Audit Team’s recommendation 

revealed that both the NCAD and MAAD set up interest receivable of P753.121 

million for interest earned in the BSP-TOP-TSA account for the 3rd quarter of CY 

2020. However, only the NCAD should set up interest receivable and interest income 

while the MAAD should distribute and reclassify the interest income to the 

corresponding accounts. Thus, the double recognition of interest receivable resulted 

in the overstatement of Interests Receivable and Interest Income on NG Deposits-BSP 

by P753.121 million in the 3rd quarter, CY 2020.  The observation was communicated 

to the NCAD and MAAD, thus, the NCAD made the necessary adjustments to correct 

the balances of the affected accounts under various JEVs drawn in October 2020. 

 

To avoid the repetition of the double recognition of the interest earned in the 

BSP-TOP-TSA account, in December 2020, the NCAD was reminded to coordinate 

with the MAAD after recognizing the interest receivable and interest income for the 

4th quarter of CY 2020.  However, both the NCAD and MAAD set up interest 

receivable anew.  The NCAD recognized the lump-sum amount of the interest earned 

by setting up the 4th quarter interest for CY 2020 of P903.155 million under Interests 

Receivable and Interest Income on NG Deposits. On the other hand, the MAAD 

debited Interests Receivable and credited the specific accounts affected instead of 

deducting the same from the Interest Income on NG Deposits previously recognized 

by the NCAD.  

 

The NCAD adjusted the transactions to reflect the correct balances in various 

JEVs in January 2021. However, the double recognition of the interest receivable 

resulted in the overstatement of the Interests Receivable and Interest Income on NG 

Deposits by P903.155 million at year-end.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief, NCAD to 

regularly advise the MAAD of the recognition of the interest earned on the BSP-

TOP-TSA for distribution and reclassification to their corresponding accounts.  

 

We also recommended and Management agreed to direct the Chief, 

MAAD upon advice of the NCAD to reclassify the interest income to their 

corresponding accounts after thorough analysis to ensure proper recognition of 

transactions in the BTr-NG books. 
 

As recommended, the NCAD and MAAD implemented the recommendations 

and properly recognized the interest for the 1st quarter of CY 2021 in the BTr-NG 

books. 

 

On Negative SL Balances 

 

a. Existence of negative SL balances under various accounts - P395.370 million  
 

Examination of the schedules of SL balances for all accounts revealed 10 

negative SL balances for six accounts totaling P395.370 million.  



83 
 

Per bank confirmation, the negative SL balances of Cash in Bank-Local 

Currency, Savings Account-Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) and Cash in Bank-

Local Currency, Savings Account-Philippine National Bank (PNB) of P1.635 million 

and P13.279 million, respectively, were already closed. However, according to the 

BRAD, the negative book balances could not be reconciled and closed due to the lack 

of supporting documents.  

 

 According to the NCAD personnel concerned with the negative SL balances 

under the Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, Special Account and Cash-

Treasury/Agency Deposit, Trust, since the creation of the system for the monitoring 

of the NG disbursements is still on-going, the classification of the negotiated checks 

is done manually based on the Unified Accounts Code Structure (UACS) code 

provided in the report submitted by the LBP. Also, the NCAD disclosed that some 

Special Accounts in the General Fund (SAGFs) which various agencies maintain, are 

separately recognized by agency in the BTr-NG books despite having only one UACS 

funding source code.  

 

For the Wildlife Management Fund which is maintained by the Department of 

Environment and Natural Resources (DENR)-Office of the Secretary (OSEC) and 

DENR-Palawan Council for Sustainable Development (PCSD), the NCAD incorrectly 

recognized all the negotiated Modified Disbursement System (MDS) checks to the 

PCSD resulting in the negative SL balance of Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, Special 

Account-Palawan Council for Sustainable Development of P51.414 million. 

 

On the other hand, the negotiated MDS checks for the Rice Competitiveness 

Enhancement Fund (RCEF) were recognized erroneously by the NCAD under the four 

corresponding SLs of Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, Special Account, namely, 

Philippine Rice Research Institute-RCEF, Philippine Center for Post-Harvest 
Development and Mechanization–RCEF, Department of Agriculture (DA)-OSEC and 

Technical Education and Skills Development Authority-RCEF. Thus, the negative 

balance of Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, Special Account-DA-OSEC-RCEF of 

P29.217 million.  

 

For the negative SL balances of the Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, Trust of 

P15.528 million, the NCAD informed that in CY 2019, the SL balances for the OSEC 

and Regional Offices (ROs) of the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR), 

Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) and Department of Education 

(DepEd) were consolidated  with the  DAR-OSEC, DPWH-OSEC and DepEd-OSEC  

based on the CY 2018 Audited Annual Financial Report of those agencies, showing 
that all funds of the ROs are maintained in the OSEC. However, in CY 2020, the 

NCAD erroneously recognized the negotiated MDS checks for trust funds (TF) under 

the SLs Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, Trust-DAR-Region III and Cash-

Treasury/Agency Deposit, Trust-DPWH-Cebu 4th District Engineering Office instead 

of Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, Trust-DAR-OSEC and Cash -Treasury/Agency 

Deposit, Trust-DPWH-OSEC, respectively. 

 



84 
 

The erroneous classification and recognition of the MDS negotiated checks 

resulted in the understatement of the balance of one SL and overstatement of the 

corresponding SLs of the Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, Special Account and Cash-

Treasury/Agency Deposit, Trust. However, there is no effect on the overall balances 

of the Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, Special Account and Cash-Treasury/Agency 

Deposit, Trust. 

 

Further, the SLs of Due from National Government Agencies-Presidential Anti-

Smuggling Group (PASG) and Due from National Government Agencies–Philippine 

Merchant Marine Academy (PMMA) had a total negative SL balance of P162.031 

million. In spite of the transition from the BTr-NG books from the Manual for National 

Government Accounting System (MNGAS) to Electronic National Government 

Accounting System (eNGAS), the MAAD still derecognized the SL balances in CY 

2015 despite the non-establishment of the ending balances as at December 31, 2014 

as the beginning balances of the said SLs on January 1, 2015. 

 

Moreover, the negative SL balance of Due to GOCCs-Philippine Coconut 

Authority (PCA) of P122.266 million was due to the late reclassification of the 

remittances of collections of PCA from Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, Regular to 

Due to GOCCs.  The NCAD initially credits to the Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, 

Regular the remittances of collection of the PCA then upon request from the PCA, the 

MAAD reclassifies the remittances to Due to GOCCs.  

 

At year-end, the available balance of the Due to GOCCs-PCA was only 

P349.581 million, which composed of the beginning balance, and reclassified 

remittances of collections for January to June CY 2020 and adjustment of prior year 

collections of P132.479 million and P217.102 million, respectively.   However, as of 

December 31, 2020, Due to GOCCs-PCA was debited for a total of P471.847 million, 

representing the transfer of remittance from the BSP-TOP-TSA account to the PCA 

bank account, although the balance of Due to GOCCs-PCA was only P349.581 million 

due to the non-reclassification of undetermined remittances from July to December 

2020.  Thus, the negative balance of Due to GOCCs-PCA of P122.266 million at year-

end.  

 

Other than the negative SL balances under Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, 

Special Account and Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, Trust, the negative SL balances 

under Cash in Bank-Local Currency, Savings Account, Due from National 

Government Agencies and Due to GOCCs have understated their respective accounts 

by twice the amount of the negative SL balances or by P29.828 million, P324.062 

million and P244.532 million, respectively.   

 

Aside from the understatement of Due to GOCCs by P244.532 million due to 

the negative balances  and since  the balance of Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, 

Regular was closed to the Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) at year-end, the 

corresponding balances of Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, Regular and the 

Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) were both overstated by P122.266 million.  



85 
 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chiefs, NCAD, 

MAAD and BRAD to improve the analysis and review of transactions and 

retrieval of supporting documents before recognition to correctly identify the 

nature of the transactions and ensure correctness of recognition. 

 

The NCAD and MAAD already recognized the adjusting entries for the 

negative SL balances under the Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, Special Account of 

P29.217 million and Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, Trust of P15.528 million under 

JEV Nos. 01-2021-05-03950 and 01-2021-05-03997 dated May 14 and 17, 2021, 

respectively. 

 

On Foreign Exchange Risk Cover Claims/Fees 

 

a. Recognition of FXRCCs for CY 2019 under Loss on Guaranty in CY 2020 and non-
recognition of FXRCCs for CY 2020 

 

a.1 Recognition of FXRCCs for CY 2019 under Loss on Guaranty in CY 2020 - 
P385.433 million 

 

Analysis of Loss on Guaranty for CY 2020 disclosed several payments to 

GOCCs during the year pertaining to FXRCCs for CY 2019 totaling P385.433 million. 

Out of the said payments, billings for P377.586 million were received by the BTr in 

CY 2019, and the billings for P7.847 million on the first week of CY 2020, but before 

the NG books for CY 2019 were closed.  

 

Despite having received the billings from the GOCCs before the closing of the 

books for CY 2019, the said FXRCCs were not recognized as expenses in the same 

year, which is a clear departure from the accrual basis of accounting which requires 

that transactions or events shall be recognized in the year to which they relate. Instead 

of recognizing the CY 2019 FXRCCs received in CY 2020 under Accumulated 

Surplus/(Deficit), the same were recognized under Loss on Guaranty on their 

respective payment dates in CY 2020. 

 

As a result, Loss on Guaranty presented in the SFPer for the year ended 

December 31, 2020 was overstated by P385.433 million. 

 

a.2 Non-recognition of FXRCCs for CY 2020 - P383.756 million 
 

Eight FXRCC billings from the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) 

and LBP totaling P383.756 million for various loans in CY 2020 were still unpaid as 

at December 31, 2020. The said billings were not recognized in the books as at 

December 31, 2020 and unpaid CY 2020 FXRCCs were not accrued by debiting Loss 

on Guaranty and crediting Due to GOCCs. 

As a result of the non-recognition of the unpaid CY 2020 FXRCC billings, Loss 

on Guaranty and Due to GOCCs were understated and Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) 

was overstated by P383.756 million. 



86 
 

 

Overall, the recognition of CY 2019 FXRCCs of P385.433 million in CY 2020 

and the non-recognition of CY 2020 FXRCCs totaling P383.756 million resulted in 

the net overstatement of Loss on Guaranty presented in the SFPer for the year ended 

December 31, 2020 by P1.678 million. Further, Due to GOCCs and Accumulated 

Surplus/(Deficit) presented in the SFPer as at December 31, 2020 were understated 

and overstated, respectively, by P383.756 million. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief, NGDAD 

to observe the accrual of all unpaid FXRCC billings as at year-end to ensure the 

correctness of the balance of affected accounts. 

 

b. Recognition of FXRCFs for CY 2019 under Other Business Income in CY 2020 and 
non-recognition of FXRCFs in CY 2020  

 

b.1 Recognition of FXRCFs for CY 2019 under Other Business Income in CY 2020 
- P247.317 million 

 

Analysis of Other Business Income-FXRCF for CY 2020 disclosed collections 

which pertain to CY 2019 FXRCFs totaling P247.317 million, as indicated in the 

amortization period for which such FXRCFs were paid by the GOCCs.  Although the 

FXRCFs pertain to CY 2019, the same were recognized under Other Business Income 

instead of under Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit). As a result, Other Business Income is 

overstated by P247.317 million. 

 

b.2 Non-recognition of FXRCFs for CY 2020 - P200.473 million 
 

Cut-off procedures undertaken for Other Business Income-FXRCFs showed 

that a total of P200.473 million FXRCF collections pertaining to CY 2020 loan 

amortizations were recognized in CY 2021. 
 

Review further showed that the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between 

the ROP and GOCCs on the related guaranteed loans to the FXRC collections, except 

for LBP’s We Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KFW) Loan No. 7744861, contain 

common provisions manifesting the ROP and GOCCs’ intention to have the FXRCF 

payment dates coincide with the guaranteed loan amortization dates. Therefore, the 

FXRCFs were supposed to have been remitted to the BTr on or before December 31, 

2020.  The MOA for the KFW Loan No. 7744861 provides that the corresponding 

FXRCF must be paid ten banking days after the amortization date, thus falling on 

January 15, 2021 for the above amortization. If the LBP and DBP’s loan repayments 

to the KFW were made on the first working day of CY 2021, considering that the 30th 

and 31st of December 2020 were non-working days, the corresponding FXRCFs must 

have also been remitted to the BTr on the same day. However, the FXRCFs were 

remitted by the GOCCs from January 8-15, 2021 and were recognized by the MAAD 

on the same dates.  Since the FXRCFs had not been remitted based on the MOAs, the 

MAAD did not have the earliest opportunity to recognize the same in CY 2020 by 



87 
 

debiting Due from Government-Owned or Controlled Corporations and crediting 

Other Income.  

 

As a result of the unrecognized FXRCFs for CY 2020, Due from Government-

Owned or Controlled Corporations, Other Business Income and Accumulated 

Surplus/(Deficit) are understated by P200.473 million. 

 

Overall, the recognition of the FXRCFs for CY 2019 of P247.317 million in 

CY 2020 and the unrecognized FXRCFs for CY 2020 of P200.473 million resulted in 

the net overstatement of Other Business Income presented in the SFPer for the year 

ended December 31, 2020 by P46.844 million, and the understatement of Due from 

Government-Owned or Controlled Corporations and Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) 

presented in the SFPer as at December 31, 2020 by P200.473 million. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief, MAAD 

to bill the GOCCs and require timely payments of FXRCFs. 

 

c. Erroneous computation of FXRCFs  - P221.478 million 
 

Audit disclosed that the FXRCFs for five guaranteed loans remitted to the BTr 

were computed using rates that are different from those provided in their respective 

MOA. Actual FXRCF payments of the GOCCs  totaled P217.298 million, however, 

recomputation of the said FXRCFs using the rates indicated in their respective MOA 

showed total FXRCFs of P438.776 million, or a difference of P221.478 million. 

 

As a result, Due from Government-Owned or Controlled Corporations and 

Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) presented in the SFPos as at December 31, 2020, and 

Other Business Income presented in the SFPer for the year ended December 31, 2020 

are understated by P221.478 million. 

 

We recommended that Management require the Chief, MAAD to review 

the computations supporting GFIs’ FXRCF payments in CY 2020 and bill the 

GOCCs  for any shortfall in the payments of FCRCFs and thereafter. 

 

On Prepaid Insurance 

 

a. Erroneous recognition and computation of the CAT Bonds insurance premium - 
P305.783 million 

 

The World Bank- International Bank for Reconstruction and Development 

(IBRD) issued two tranches of Catastrophe-linked Bonds (CAT Bonds) that provide 

the Philippines with insurance coverage of a maximum of US$75 million for 

earthquakes and US$150 million for tropical cyclones from November 24, 2019 to 

December 2, 2022. The BTr on behalf of the Philippines will pay a total CAT Bonds 

insurance premium of US$38.436 million for three tranches within the three year-

period of the insurance as presented in Table 4. 



88 
 

         Table 4. Premiums and Terms 

Premiums Amount  Period Covered 

1st Premium $  12,885,833.33 November 24, 2019 to December 2, 2020 

2nd Premium 12,775,000.00 December 3, 2020 to December 2, 2021 

3rd Premium 12,775,000.00 December 3, 2021 to December 2, 2022 

Total $  38,435,833.33  

 

Analysis of the SL for the Prepaid Insurance disclosed that on November 11, 

2019, the MAAD recognized the insurance premium in the BTr-NG books for the 

BTr’s payment of the 1st tranche of the CAT Bonds insurance premium of P1.385 

billion for the period November 24, 2019 to December 2, 2020 to the Word Bank-

International Bank for Reconstruction and Development on November 5, 2019.  On 

December 27, 2019, the MAAD recognized insurance expenses for the period 

November to December 2019, totaling P142.347 million. The remaining balance of 

the prepaid insurance of P1.243 billion was fully amortized and recognized as expired 

portion on November 24, 2020. 
 

According to the MAAD, the 1st tranche payment made on November 5, 2019 

has a term of one year from November 24, 2019 to November 24, 2020. Thus, the 1st 

CAT Bonds insurance premium of P1.385 billion was fully amortized on November 

24, 2020. 

 

On the other hand, inquiry with Capital Market Strategy and Planning Division 

(CMSPD), in-charge with the CAT Bonds insurance together with the Debt Strategy 

and Planning Division (DSPD), revealed that the payment of CAT Bonds insurance 

premium of P1.385 billion on November 5, 2019, covered the 1st tranche, portion of 

the 2nd tranche of CAT Bonds insurance premium and expenses associated with the 

implementation of the insurance.   

 

     In addition, the CMSPD said that the 2nd tranche payment of P32.155 million 

made to the World Bank-IBRD on September 1, 2020, is for the remaining balance of 

the 2nd CAT Bonds insurance premium and partial payment of the 3rd insurance 

premium.  

 

Based on the verifications with the CMSPD, the full amortization of the 1st 

tranche premium of P1.385 billion on November 24, 2020 was erroneous, since the 

premium covering November 25 to December 2, 2020 has not yet expired.  Moreover, 

as of November 24, 2020, the 2nd tranche payment of the CAT Bonds insurance 

premium  on September 1, 2020 of P32.155 million was not yet recognized in the BTr-

NG books.  

 

The observations were communicated to the MAAD. Thus, on December 29, 

2020, the MAAD recognized in the BTr-NG books the CAT Bonds insurance 

premium for the 2nd tranche payment of P32.155 million and the corresponding 

expired portion of P2.501 million from December 3, 2020, the start date of the 2nd 

CAT Bonds insurance premium, up to December 31, 2020. On December 31, 2020, 



89 
 

an adjusting entry was made to correct the recognition of the expired portion of the 1st 

tranche payment of insurance premium  for CY 2019 and CY 2020 of P96.181 million 

and P780.986 million, respectively. The recognitions and adjustments of prepayments 

and expenses were summarized as follows:

Review of the adjustment made by the MAAD revealed that the amortizations 

for P1.385 billion were again incorrectly computed. In the adjustment, the P1.385 

billion was amortized based on the 3-year term of the CAT Bonds insurance and not 

on the period covered provided in Table 4.  The details of the erroneous adjustments 

are presented in Table 6.

In addition,  the MAAD did not consider the following: (a) part of the P1.385 

billion were outright expenses which should be fully recognized in CY 2019; 

(b)amortization of the partial payment of the 2nd premium was from December 3, 2020 

to December 2, 2021; and (c) the P1.385 billion did not cover the three-year insurance 

premium. 

 

On the other hand, the MAAD, in computing the expired portion of P2.501 

million for the 2nd tranche payment of P32.155 million, treated the whole amount as 

payment for the 2nd CAT Bonds insurance premium with a one year coverage period 

instead of the payment for the balance of the 2nd tranche insurance premium and partial 

payment of the 3rd tranche insurance premium.  However, the expired portion of the 

2nd tranche covered only the period December 3, 2020 to December 31, 2020 at P2.352 

million. 

 

The  breakdown of the 1st and 2nd payments totaling P1.385 billion and P32.155 

million, respectively, based on the Receipt received from World Bank is presented in

As can be gleaned in Table 8, the  insurance expenses to be recognized in CY 

2019 should be the outright expense of P109.025 million and the expired portion of 

P65.656 million for November 24, 2019 to December 31, 2019, of the 1st insurance 

premium, or for a total of P174.681 million.  For CY 2020, the insurance expenses 

that should have been recognized totaled P641.436 million for the remaining portion 

of the 1st insurance premium January 1 to December 2, 2020 and the expired portion 

for December 3-31, 2020 for the 2nd insurance premium of P590.908 million and 

P50.528 million, respectively. 

 

The erroneous computation and recognition of the amortization of the CAT 

Bonds insurance premium in CYs 2019 and 2020 resulted in the overstatement of 

Prepaid Insurance in CYs 2019 and 2020 by P128.514 million and P177.269 million, 

respectively, or a total P305.783 million, and the understatement of Insurance 

Expenses and overstatement of Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) in CYs 2019 and 2020 

both by P128.514 million and  P177.269 million, respectively. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to ensure that  the Chief, 

MAAD (a) secure the copy of the Country Engagement Letter and other 

supporting documents on the CAT Bonds insurance from the CMSPD for proper 

computation and recognition of the payment and expired portions of the 

insurance premium in the BTr-NG books; and (b)  observe due care  in 

computation  of the amortization of the insurance premium to ensure that 

expenses are completely and accurately recognized in the BTr-NG books and 

within the applicable reporting period. 

  

The MAAD already coordinated with the CMSPD and as a result, the CMSPD 

provided the additional documents for the payment terms of the CAT Bonds insurance. 

Also, the erroneous computation and recognition of the CAT Bonds insurance 

premium of P305.783 million for CY 2019 and 2020 was already adjusted by the 

MAAD under JEV No. 01-2021-04-03287 dated April 26, 2021.

On Other Investments 

 

a. Erroneous measurement of investments in T-Bonds received as dividends at initial 
recognition 

 

Review of the general ledger (GL) of Other Investments showed that the BTr 

received dividends from various GOCCs in the form of T-Bonds. For CY 2020, T-

Bonds received had a total face amount of P9.197 billion with an aggregate settlement 

amount of P9.355 billion, derived as follows: 

 
Face Amount P9,196,687,987.32 

Net Premium/(Discount)       75,347,679.92 

Bond Price 9,272,035,667.24 

Accrued Interest 103,148,826.48 

Tax on Accrual    (20,629,765.31) 

Settlement Amount P9,354,554,728.41 

 

T-Bonds received shall be measured initially at fair value as represented by the 

face amount of the T-Bonds less net discount or net premium, as the case may be. Any 

accrued interest on the T-Bonds does not form part of the fair value of the T-Bond but 

shall be recognized separately under the appropriate account. However, investments 

in T-Bonds recognized by the MAAD under Other Investments was the whole 

settlement amount of P9.355 billion. Therefore, the accrued interest on T-Bonds, net 

of tax of P82.519 million was also recognized under Other Investments instead of 

Interest Receivable, resulting in the overstatement of Other Investments and the 

understatement of Interests Receivable at initial recognition by P82.519 million. 

 

All the T-Bonds were already sold or redeemed as at December 31, 2020. 

Therefore, the said accounting error at initial recognition had no effect on the balances 

of Other Investments and Interests Receivable at year-end. However, there were 

several errors in various accounts in the course of recognizing subsequent transactions 

relative to the subject investments in T-Bonds as follows: 

 

a.1 Erroneous inclusion of accrued interests of P82.519 million in the value of 
investments in T-Bonds  at initial recognition 

 

Of the total investments of P9.197 billion, T-Bonds with an aggregate face 

amount of P5.984 billion were sold, and the remaining P3.213 billion were redeemed.  

 

The T-Bonds of P5.984 billion sold had a total book value of P6.110 billion at 

the date of sale but were sold at an aggregate price of P6.094 billion. Gain of P4.678 

million and loss of P20.555 million were recognized under Gain on Sale of 

Investments and Loss on Sale of Investments, respectively, as a result of the sale, or a 

net loss of P15.877 million. Recomputation of the gain and loss on sale of investments 

using the proper measurement of investments at initial recognition showed that all the 

above sales of investments resulted in an aggregate gain of P58.476 million, thereby 

warranting the credit of Gain on Sale of Investments by the same amount. 



93 
 

Consequently, Gain on Sale of Investments was understated by P53.799 million, and 

Loss on Sale of Investments was overstated by P20.555 million or a net understatement 

of Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) by P74.353 million. This difference is merely due to 

the erroneous recognition of T-Bonds sold at P6.110 billion at initial recognition, 

instead of P6.035 billion. 

 

On the other hand, T-Bonds with a total face amount of P3.213 billion were 

held and redeemed at maturity. The T-Bonds were acquired at a total price of P3.237 

billion or a premium of P23.962 million. However, due to the erroneous measurement 

of such investments at initial recognition, the T-Bonds were recognized at P3.245 

billion, or a premium of P32.128 million. As observed, the measurements of premiums 

at the time of the receipt of investments as dividends and at the time of redemption 

had a difference of P8.166 million. The premiums were closed to Other Losses upon 

redemption of the investment. Therefore, Other Losses recognized on the redemption 

of T-Bonds were overstated by P8.166 million. 

 

In summary, the overstatement in Other Investments at initial recognition of 

P82.519 million resulted in the overstatement of Other Losses and Loss on Sale of 

Investments by P8.166 million and P20.555 million, respectively, and the 

understatement of Gain on Sale of Investments by P53.799 million. 

 

a.2 Under-recognition of accrued interests on investments in T-Bonds of P82.519 
million at initial recognition 

 

The accrued interest of P103.149 million on T-Bonds of P9.197 billion were 

recognized at initial recognition as part of the investments resulting in the non-

recognition of accrued interest under Interests Receivable. As such, all interests 

received totaling P250.269 million and their corresponding withholding taxes of 

P50.054 million subsequent to the date of acquisition of the T-Bonds were credited 

fully to Interest Income and debited to Taxes, Duties and Licenses, respectively.  

 

However, since portions of the interests received were accrued at the time of 

the acquisition of T-Bonds, such portions shall not be recorded as income but as 

reduction under Interests Receivable.  Had the measurement of T-Bonds at initial 

recognition been properly made, Interest Income must have been credited only by 

P147.120 million and Taxes, Duties and Licenses by P29.424 million, or a net interest 

of P117.696 million. As a consequence, Interest Income and Taxes, Duties and 

Licenses were overstated by P103.149 million and P20.630 million, or a net interest 

of P82.519 million which represents the accrued interest at acquisition date which 

were not recognized under Interests Receivable. 

 

Overall, the erroneous measurement of T-Bonds with a face amount of P9.197 

billion at initial recognition resulted in the overstatement of Other Losses, Loss on 

Sale of Investments, Gain on Sale of Investments, Interest Income, and Taxes, Duties 

and Licenses by P8.166 million, P20.555 million, P53.799 million, P103.149 million, 

and P20.630 million, respectively. 



94 
 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief, MAAD 

to observe proper measurement of investments in T-Bonds at initial recognition 

to ensure the proper recognition of investments and their related accounts in the 

books. 

 

b. Erroneous computation of accrued interests on investments in T-Bonds from the 
NEFCA upon accrual 

 

To establish the mechanisms for the management of the NCCA Special Fund 

called the NEFCA, an agreement was entered into by and between the BTr and the 

NCCA on March 27, 2017. Section 4.2 of the said agreement provides that the BTr 

shall, among others, manage the NEFCA consistent with the investment parameters 

issued by the NCCA and applicable legal requirements, with the objective of 

maximizing returns and minimizing risks. Further, the BTr shall also provide the 

NCCA with a monthly report of portfolio investment 10 business days after the end of 

each reference month. 

 

The NEFCA and any income accruing thereto are recognized under Due to 

NGAs in the NG books, and Due from National Government Agencies in the NCCA 

books. The investments therefrom do not appear in the NCCA books, but are 

recognized under Other Investments in the NG books. All income and expenses related 

to the fund are recognized in the NCCA’s SFPer, but as addition or reduction to Due 

to NGAs, as the case may be, in the NG books. 

 

The income and expenses and the corresponding receivables recognized by the 

NCCA in its books depend solely on the periodic reports rendered by the BTr. 

Therefore, the accuracy of the said reports is essential to the fairness of the 

presentation of NCCA’s FSs. However, review of the NG’s records showed the 

erroneous computations of accrued interests on investments in T-Bonds.  

 

Accrued interests on investments in T-Bonds from the NEFCA as at December 

31, 2020 totaled P6.394 million with corresponding withholding tax of P1.279 million, 

or a net interest of P5.116 million. Analysis of the accrual of interests on investment 

in T-Bond with ISIN PIID0524C129 with face amount of P500 million disclosed that 

the interest rate of 4.250 per cent instead of 6.250 per cent was used. As such, the 

computed gross interest, withholding tax and net interest on the said T-Bond were 

P1.649 million, P329,861.11, and P1.319 million, respectively. Recomputation of the 

accrued interest using the correct interest rate of 6.250 per cent showed that the gross 

interests, withholding tax and net interest should be P1.122 million, P224,305.56, and 

P0.897 million, respectively, thus, the difference of P0.528 million in the gross 

interest, P105,555.56 on the withholding tax, and P422,222.22 on the net interest. As 

a result, Interests Receivable and Due to NGAs are understated by P422,222.22. 

 

In addition, since the NCCA solely depends on the periodic reports on the 

accrued interests on investments rendered by the BTr, the abovementioned errors in 



95 
 

the computation of accrued interests also affected the correctness of the income and 

expenses recognized by the NCCA in its books.  

 

 We recommended that Management require the Chief, MAAD to: (a) ensure 

that proper accrual of interest on investments in T-Bonds and T-Bills is observed to 

ensure the proper recognition of accrued interest and the related accounts in the 

books of the NG and NCCA; and (b) update the report on accrued interest for CY 

2020 and furnish the NCCA as the basis of their adjustments.  

 

On Investment in Stocks 
 

a. Erroneous translation of capital contributions and exclusion of CY 2019 capital 
contribution to IDA - US$1.690 million 

 

Prior to the year-end translation of capital contributions, an adjustment was 

made by the MAAD on November 3, 2020 to correct the CY 2020 beginning balance 

of Investments in Stocks-IDA of US$25.310 million or P1.286 billion. Based on the 

Philippines’ Status of Subscription and Votes as at December 31, 2018 as submitted 

by the IDA, the beginning balance of  the NG’s capital contributions consists of  

payments of subscriptions in US Dollar of US$24.434 million and in Philippine Peso 

of P45.969 million,  or a US Dollar Value of US$25.310 million.  However, the 

MAAD made the translation of the subscriptions based on its USD Dollar Value 

instead of translating only the US Dollar of US$24.434 million and adding the 

subscriptions of P45.969 million to arrive at a translated amount of P1.287 billion.   

With a translated beginning balance of P1.286 billion per books against the supposed 

translated beginning balance of P1.287 billion, the balance per books was lesser by 

P1.487 million. 

 

 Further, review of the SL for Investments in Stocks-IDA for CY 2019 disclosed 

that a payment was made on January 15, 2019 in the amount of US$1.690 million or 

P88.213 million, representing the second installment of the 18th IDA Replenishment. 
As at December 31, 2019, the contribution had a translated value of P85.855 million. 

Although the second installment was paid in CY 2019, the same was inadvertently 

excluded from the CY 2020 beginning balance. Therefore, the CY 2020 beginning 

balance was further understated by P85.855 million. Overall, the CY 2020 translated 

beginning balance of the capital contribution to IDA was understated by P87.342 

million, thereby understating Investments in Stocks and Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) 

by P87.342 million. 

 

As at December 31, 2020, the NG’s total capital contribution to the IDA is 

composed of US$27.804 million and P45.969 million, or a total translated value of 

P1.381 billion. However, due to the erroneous translation of capital contributions and 

the exclusion of the CY 2019 capital contribution of US$1.690 million in the CY 2020 

beginning balance, loss on foreign exchange recognized as a result of the translation 

as at December 31, 2020 amounted only to P74.572 million, instead of P76.837 

million per recomputation, or a difference of P2.265 million. 



96 
 

Overall, the erroneous recognition of the translation of the beginning balance 

of the capital contribution in CY 2020 and the exclusion of the CY 2019 capital 

contribution to IDA resulted in the understatement of Investments in Stocks and 

Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) presented in the SFPos as at December 31, 2020 by 

P85.077 million, and Loss on Foreign Exchange (FOREX) presented in SFPer for the 

year ended December 31, 2020 by P2.265 million. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief, MAAD 

to ensure that capital contributions paid to the IDA in Philippine Peso is 

recognized based on the actual payment in Philippine Peso, indicated in the 

Philippines’ Status of Subscription and Votes from the IDA to ensure the 

accuracy of the balances of the contributions. 

 

b. Erroneous revaluation of the capital quota subscriptions in the IMF - P20 million 
 

In CY 2020, there were two Maintenance of Value (MOV) computations and 

revaluations recorded in the books: on April 30, 2020 which is the end of the IMF’s 

fiscal year; and on December 31, 2020 for the year-end revaluation. The ROP’s 

outstanding capital quota subscription to the IMF amounted to SDR2.043 billion, with 

a revalued amount as at April 30, 2020 and December 31, 2020 of P142.579 billion 

and P141.305 billion, respectively, based on the BSP’s revaluation analysis, or a 

foreign exchange (FOREX) loss of P1.274 billion between April 30, 2020 and 

December 31, 2020. However, documents supporting the revaluation of the capital 

quota subscription as at December 31, 2020 showed that the revalued amount as at 

April 30, 2020 was inadvertently taken at P142.559 billion, or short by P20 million. 

Therefore, the FOREX loss was computed at P1.254 billion only. From the computed 

FOREX loss, the revaluation loss from the Local Currency Holding was deducted to 

arrive at the FOREX gain or loss to be recognized, as shown in Table 9.

Based on the foregoing table, the FOREX loss that should be debited to Loss 

on Foreign Exchange (FOREX) and credited to Investments in Stocks was P1.417 

billion. However, as a result of the erroneous use of the revalued balance of the quota 

subscriptions as at April 30, 2020, only P1.397 billion was recognized at year-end 

instead of P1.417 billion. 

 

Consequently, Investments in Stocks and the Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) in 

the SFPos as at December 31, 2020 were overstated by P20 million; and Loss on 



97 
 

Foreign Exchange (FOREX) in SFPer for the period ended December 31, 2020 was 

understated by P20 million. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require Chief, MAAD to 

ensure that capital quota subscriptions to the IMF are correctly translated at 

year-end. 

 

On Deferred Discount on Treasury Bills and Bonds 

 

a. Erroneous amortization of discount on outstanding T-Bills - P37.091 million 
 

Out of the total unamortized discounts on outstanding T-Bills as at December 

31, 2020 of P7.302 billion, P731.346 million pertains to T-Bills issued particularly for 

the Central Bank-Board of Liquidators (CB-BOL) and P6.570 billion for the regular 

T-Bill issuances. Recomputation of amortization of discounts disclosed that 

unamortized discounts for regular T-Bill issuances amounted to P6.607 billion or a 

difference of P37.091 million. The said difference is attributable to the number of days 

used by the NGDAD in amortizing discount, which significantly differs from the 

actual number of days that had elapsed from the date of issue up to December 31, 

2020. The days used by the NGDAD to amortize the discounts for the three T-Bills 

with different ISINs differ from the actual number of days by 31 days. Hence the 

unamortized discount of P336.900 million, which is P37.091 million lesser than the 

unamortized discount of P373.991 million using the actual number of days.  

 

As a consequence, Deferred Discount on Treasury Bills and Bonds and 

Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) presented in the SFPos as at December 31, 2020 were 

understated by P37.091 million, and Interest Expenses presented in the SFPer for the 

year ended December 31, 2020 was overstated by the same amount. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief, NGDAD 

to ensure that the amortization of discount on T-Bills issued and outstanding is 

based on the number days from issue date to reporting date. 

  

On Budgetary Support to GOCCs 
 

a. Erroneous recognition of returned fund from FY 2019 discontinued unobligated 
allotment - P5.831 million 

 

In FY 2019 GAA, the total appropriation of the National Dairy Authority 

(NDA) was P299.569 million and the same was fully released and disbursed to the 

NDA by the MAAD in CY 2019. 

 

For FY 2020, the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) issued 

negative Special Allotment Release Orders (SAROs) to various GOCCs for the 

discontinuance of their appropriated programs, projects, or activities. One of the 



98 
 

negative SAROs released was SARO number BMB-C-20-0012323 dated June 24, 

2020 amounting to P5.831 million. 

 

The SARO issued was for the NDA under its FY 2019 Continuing 

Appropriations in response to the NDA’s letter dated April 29, 2020, addressed to the 

DBM Secretary, informing the latter that the said GOCC has remaining unobligated 

allotment of P5.831 million in FY 2019, and the same was offered for discontinuance. 

On December 22, 2020, the NDA remitted the funds equivalent to the discontinued 

unobligated allotment of P5.831 million to the BTr.  The receipt of the remittance by 

BTr CO was recognized by the MAAD in the Regular Agency (RA) books with a debit 

to Subsidy from National Government and a credit to Budgetary Support to 

Government-Owned or Controlled Corporations for P5.831 million instead of a debit 

and credit to Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) for the same amount. 

 

Due to the erroneous recognition of the remittance of the funds equivalent to 

the discontinued unobligated allotment, Subsidy from National Government and 

Budgetary Support to Government Owned or Controlled Corporations were both 

understated by P5.831 million. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief, MAAD 

to ensure that transactions are analyzed carefully and recognized correctly in the 

books. 

 

The erroneous recognition of the remittance of the fund of P5.831 million was 

already adjusted by the MAAD under JEV No. 01-2021-05-077 dated May 4, 2021. 

 

 

Accounting deficiencies 

 

2. The completeness, accuracy, and existence of several assets and liabilities could 
not be readily ascertained due to variances between books and related records, 

non-compliance with accounting standards and other relevant issuances, and 

dormancy of some accounts, among others. 

 

The deficiencies, including the affected accounts are discussed and

On Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, Special Account and Cash-Treasury/Agency 

Deposit, Trust 
 

a. Discrepancies on Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, Special Account and Cash-
Treasury/Agency Deposit, Trust of P28.305 billion and P4.301 billion, respectively 

 

The NG collections remitted to the BTr are classified under various funds, 

namely, the GF, SAGF and Trust Receipt (TR) and recognized by the NCAD under 

the Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, Regular, Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, Special 

Account, and Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, Trust, respectively. 

 

The Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, Regular, Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, 

Special Account and Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, Trust have reciprocal accounts 

with the NGAs but with a debit balance.  Remittances to the BTr by the NGAs of 

deposits of collections of fees, charges and other income, income authorized to be set 

aside in a special account and trusts receipts are recognized in the NGAs’ books with 

a debit to the said accounts while receipts of the said remittances are recognized in the 

BTr-NG books with a corresponding credit to the same accounts. 
 

To ascertain the reliability of the balances of the Cash-Treasury/Agency 

Deposit, Special Account and Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, Trust, confirmation 

letters were sent to 170 selected NGAs.  
 

As of April 29, 2021, only 69 out of 170 or 40.59 per cent of the NGAs had 

responded to the request for confirmation. Comparison of the BTr-NG book balances 

with the NGAs’ confirmed balances showed a discrepancy for the Cash-

Treasury/Agency Deposit, Special Account and Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, Trust 

of P28.305 billion and P4.301 billion, respectively, or a total of P32.606 billion. 
 

The net difference of P32.606 billion consists of the following:

Aside from the difference of P32.606 billion, the remaining balances of 

P125.079 billion and P18.297 billion for Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, Special 

Account and Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, Trust, respectively, were not confirmed 

by 101 of 170 NGAs or 59.41 per cent. 

  

The discrepancies between the BTr books and NGAs’ confirmed balances were 

due to the (a) late reclassification of the remittances of collections of the NGAs by the 

NCAD; (b) non-/late recognition of disbursements made by the NGAs and (c) non-

/late submission of the Statement of Account (SOA) and Utilization Report by the 

NGAs to the BTr. 

  

 To facilitate reconciliation of the Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, Special 

Account and Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, Trust in the BTr-NG books and with 

those of the NGAs, on January 14, 2020, the BTr issued an advisory to all NGAs 

requiring the submission of the SOA for the SAGFs and TRs to the NCAD. The BRAD 

informed that aside from the Advisory, letters to the NGAs, requesting the submission 

of SOA and Utilization Report, are being continuously sent by the BRAD. However, 

despite the efforts of the BTr, the discrepancies between the NGAs and BTr-NG books 

continue to exist.  

 

With the unreconciled discrepancies in the Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, 

Special Account and Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, Trust of P28.305 billion and 

P4.301 billion, respectively, between the NGAs and BTr-NG book balances and the 

unconfirmed balances of the Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, Special Account and 

Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, Trust of P125.079 billion and P18.297 billion, 

respectively, the existence and accuracy of the account balances were not determined. 

  

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief, BRAD, 

in coordination with the Chief, NCAD to: (a) determine the cause/s of 

discrepancies between the BTr-NG books and NGAs’absence records and ensure 

the proper recognition of the recognition of the collections received and releases 

made; and (b) adjust immediately all identified reconciling items to come up with 

the correct balances of the affected accounts.  

 

We also recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief, 

BRAD to: (a) confirm with concerned NGAs the SAGFs and TRs with zero 



102 
 

balances as confirmed by the Auditors, and close the accounts accordingly; and 

(b) continue the reconciliation of SAGFs and TRs with the NGAs to facilitate 

adjustments of the accounts affected. 

 

On Prepaid Insurance  

 

b. Late recognition of the 2nd payment of CAT Bonds insurance premium - P32.155 
million  

 

Analysis of Prepaid Insurance disclosed that the 2nd tranche payment for the 

CAT Bonds insurance premium of P32.155 million was made on August 28, 2020, 

and received by the World Bank-IBRD on September 1, 2020 but only recognized by 

the MAAD in the BTr-NG books on December 29, 2020.  

 

In the agreement for the CAT Bonds insurance, the BTr should make full 

payment of the 2nd insurance premium on August 31, 2020. The payments for the 1st, 

2nd and 3rd tranches were due on November 22, 2019, August 31, 2020 and August 31, 
2021, respectively. 

 

      Since the budget for the payment of the insurance premium was released to 

the BTr-Proper and not to the BTr-NG, the Bureau Accounting Division (BAD) made 

the payment to the World Bank- IBRD on August 28, 2020, and recognized such 

payment in the BTr-Proper books on the same date. Subsequently, also on the same 

date, the BAD had drawn a JEV to transfer the recognition of the payment of the 

insurance premium to the BTr-NG books, as it is an NG transaction. However, the 

MAAD made no corresponding entry in the BTr-NG books to recognize the said 

payment of the insurance premium.   

 

The concerned MAAD personnel explained that the CMSPD/DSPD and BAD 

did not inform the MAAD of the 2nd tranche insurance premium payment. The said 

personnel came to know of the payment four months after the actual date of 

transaction. The CMSPD and BAD admitted its failure to immediately notify the 

MAAD about the payment.  

 

The late recognition of the 2nd tranche payment of CAT Bonds insurance 

premium in the BTr-NG books understated the Prepaid Insurance and Subsidy from 

Other Funds at a given date. 

    

We recommended and Management agreed to require the MAAD to: (a)  

to keep track of the insurance premium payment due dates and verify with the 

CMSP/DSPD and BAD for the payment details of the insurance premium to 

facilitate timely and proper recognition of the related transactions in the BTr-

NG books.  

 

We also recommended and Management agreed to require the 

CMSPD/DSPD to immediately advise/inform the MAAD whenever payment for 

insurance premium is made to facilitate immediate coordination by the MAAD 



103 
 

with the BAD for the recognition of the insurance premium payment in the BTr- 

NG books. 

 

On Other Receivables 

 

c. Discrepancies and unreconciled balances of receivables from the National Registry 
of Scripless Securities (NRoSS) subscription fees 

 

The Payments Division and Scripless Securities Registration Division (SSRD), 

both under the Liability Management Service (LMS), are assigned to bill and 

communicate the monthly NRoSS subscription fees to the participants who are either 

paying through checks to the Cash Custodial Division (CCD) or are registered in the 

auto-charge facility in the regular demand deposit accounts (RDDA) of the 

participants, respectively. On the other hand, the NGDAD is in-charge of the 

monitoring and recognition of payments and receivables of NRoSS subscription fees 

in the BTr-NG books.  

 

Inquiry with the Payments Division disclosed that hard copies of the billing 

statements are sent to the participants. However, due to the pandemic, the Payments 

Division sends the billing statements and payment instructions through email and 

contacts the participants through phone calls. Further, the sending of billing 

statements, payment instructions and even follow-ups for the payment of monthly 

subscription fees have been challenging since some of the participants’ contact details 

are incomplete or not updated. 

 

Review of the submitted Payments Division NRoSS Fee Payment via Check 

and NGDAD’s RoSS-Other Receivables as at December 31, 2020 revealed a 

discrepancy of P62,000.00.  The Payments Division NRoSS Fee Payment via Check 

included only receivables from CY 2018 to 2020, while the NGDAD’s RoSS-Other 

Receivables covered CY 2013 to 2020. The Payments Division claimed that it is 

tedious to download and manually select all the participants with outstanding 

receivables in the Oracle system. Although the Payments Division NRoSS Fee 

Payment via Check covered only CYs 2018 to 2020, its reported total outstanding 

receivables were more than the NGDAD’s record by P62,000.00. Further, balances of 

the outstanding receivables for each period are also unreconciled.  

 

Moreover, both the total amount of receivables from the NRoSS subscription 

fees reflected in the Payments Division NRoSS Fee Payment via Check and 

NGDAD’s RoSS-Other Receivables do not tally with the balance of the Other 

Receivables-RoSS Fees of P3.224 million as at December 31, 2020 resulting in a 

difference of P117,000.00 and P179,000.00, respectively. 

 

In the NGDAD’s reply to the inquiry on the unreconciled balances with the 

Payments Division report and the balance of Other Receivables-RoSS Fees, it claimed 

that there were already settled receivables per NGDAD report after initial validation 

but which were still outstanding in the Payment Division report. The NGDAD’s report 



104 
 

is for updating and subject to further reconciliation with the Payments Division report 

and BTr-NG’s book balance. Also, the NGDAD committed to make the necessary 

adjustments to reflect the correct balances. 

 

On the other hand, there were receivables for undetermined periods totaling 

P53,000.00 included in the discrepancies  between the Payments Division and 

NGDAD’s reports which pertain to the differences between the amounts due for the 

period covered by the subscription fees against the total receivables per participant as 

reflected in the NGDAD’s RoSS-Other Receivables. The discrepancies noted were 

communicated to the NGDAD to which it responded that these discrepancies in the 

period covered are still subject to validation.  

 

Thus, the accuracy of the balance of Other Receivables-RoSS Fees was not 

ascertained due to the discrepancies and unreconciled balances between the NGDAD 

and Payments Division reports and the Other Receivables-RoSS Fees recognized in 

the BTr-NG books.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief, Payments 

Division to: (a) regularly update and monitor the participants’ list and directory 

for efficient billing and collection of the monthly NRoSS subscription fees; and 

(b) download all the outstanding receivables prior to CY 2018, if any, from the 

Oracle system to facilitate monitoring and collection of the unpaid monthly 

NRoSS subscription fees.  

 

We also recommended and Management agreed to require the NGDAD to: 

(a) reconcile with the Payments Division their report on the outstanding 

receivables from the NRoSS subscription fees to ensure complete monitoring and 

recognition of receivables; and (b) recognize the difference in subscription fees 

in the BTr-NG books after reconciliation with the Payments Division to ensure 

complete and accurate recognition of Other Receivables-RoSS Fees. 

 

d. Absence of documents supporting the existence of inactive/dormant receivables - 
P185.949 million  

 

As at December 31, 2020, Other Receivables has a balance of P5.347 billion.  

Review of the AARs on the BTr-NG for CYs 2002 to 2019 revealed that the  of the 

said balance, P185.949 million has been inactive/dormant for 16-25 years, as shown 

in Table 12.

The observation on inactive/dormant accounts of P185.949 million was 

included in the CY 2016 CAAR. In the same year, the Audit Team required the Legal 

Service (LS) and the BTr, to obtain the results of the pending cases from the Office of 

the Solicitor General. However, no update had been received from the LS. 

 

On the other hand, the BRAD, in-charge in verifying the inactive/dormant 

balances under Other Receivables informed that the status of the inactive/dormant 

accounts could not be determined/updated due to the unavailability of documents. 

Also, the NCAD, previously in-charge with the dormant accounts, disclosed that the  

letter requests for write-off of dormant receivables totaling P10.390 million had been 

made on February 21, 1992, September 24, 1996, and October 16, 1998. However, the 

NCAD could not provide the Audit Team with the copy and status of the said requests. 

 

After several follow-ups and reminders by the Audit Team since CY 2016, the 

NCAD had made no progress in recovering the documents to support the adjustment 

or the closure and write-off of the dormant receivables.  Thus, the existence and 

accuracy of the balance of Other Receivables of P185.949 million was not established. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Chief, BRAD 

to: (a) prepare the request for the write-off of inactive/dormant accounts of 

P10.390 million in accordance with the guidelines set forth in COA Circular 

2016-005; (b) continue to fast track the verification of the dormant/inactive 

accounts for proper closure of the non-existing accounts, if any; and (c)  monitor 

regularly the status of other receivable accounts, in particular, those with 

pending appeals, to respond immediately and properly to the results of the 

appeals. 

 

We also recommended and Management agreed to require the Director, 

LS to: (a) communicate with the Office of the Solicitor General to update the 

status of the pending cases with the appropriate courts; and (b) provide updates 

on the status of the receivables with pending cases to the Chief, BRAD for proper 

documentation and disposition. 

 

The BRAD sent a letter dated April 20, 2021 to the LS, requesting for an update 

on the status of receivables with pending cases.

On Cash-Collecting Officers 

 

e. Erroneous recognition of collections and deposits under Cash-Collecting Officers 
- P170.555 million 

 

Matching the collections in the Report of Collections and Deposits (RCD) for 

the Miscellaneous Fund (MF) and those recognized under Cash-Collecting Officers in 

the BTr-NG books showed that a collection of P60.775 million, representing 

withdrawal from the present balance of the 5 per cent contingent fund from recovered 

deposits from Presidential Commission on Good Governance, was recognized under 

JEV No. 01-2020-01-04941 with a debit to Cash in Bank-Foreign Currency, Savings 

Account and a credit to Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, Special Account. The entry 

made did not show separately the collection and deposit made using the Cash-

Collecting Officers. Nonetheless, the collection was adjusted by the MAAD under 

JEV No. 01-2020-11-13704 dated November 27, 2020. 

 

Further, the guaranteed energy delivery fees of P151.659 million and P18.896 

million directly deposited by the Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management 

Corporation to the account of the TOP-TSA were recognized by the NGDAD under 

JEV Nos. 01-2020-06-09305 and 01-2020-06-09470, respectively, with a debit and a 

credit to the Cash-Collecting Officers as if these were collected, deposited, and 

transacted through the Collecting Officer (CO).  

 

Although the entries made have no effect on the balance of Cash-Collecting 

Officers, it overstated the total debits and credits of the account at year-end by 

P170.555 million. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chiefs, MAAD 

and NGDAD to ensure that collections received are recognized under the 

appropriate accounts. 

 

f. Late recognition of collections from 14-160 days from the date of collection - 
P12.658 million 

 

The CO receives collections for the NG transactions and submits the supporting 

documents to the AS for the recognition of the collections in the books. Under the AS, 

there are different Accounting Divisions assigned for the various accounts and 

transactions of the NG, namely, the NCAD, MAAD, BRAD and NGDAD. 

 

Examination of the Cash Receipts Record (CRR), RCD and JEVs revealed that 

the collections from various agencies were recognized by the concerned Accounting 

Divisions within 14-160 days from the date of the collection. 

 

According to the concerned NGDAD personnel, the collection of  P69,617.98 

from the NIA for guaranteed water delivery fee on March 6, 2020 was overlooked, 

thus, was only recognized on June 30, 2020, or 116 days after the date of remittance, 



107 
 

as the collection was identified in the RCD as guarantee fee.The MAAD, however, 

did not recognize the collection as guarantee fee. 

 

For various collections of escheated balances of P3.548 million in February, 

2020 that were only recognized on May 22, 2020, the BRAD claimed that the preparer 

of the JEV already created/encoded the said collections in the eNGAS on February 24 

and 26, 2020. However, these were not immediately approved since the approver 

prioritized the January 2020 transactions, which are due for posting in the NGAS. 

Moreover, on March 12, 2020, the enhanced community quarantine was declared, and 

throughout that quarantine period, the BRAD has no remote access to the NGAS. The 

preparer only reported to work on May 22, 2020, and only then was she informed that 

the JEVs created on February 24 and 26, 2020 were not yet approved. Thus, the same 

was not included in the February 2020 transactions posted in the NGAS. The preparer 

of the JEV edited the date of the JEVs from February 24 and 26, 2020 to May 22, 

2020. Thus, it was the date the transactions were recognized in the BTr-NG books 

which resulted to delays from 91-98 days in the recognition from the date of 

remittance.  Further, the BRAD informed that the other escheated collections on 

August 24, 2020 and September 14, 2020 of P515,461.59 and P82,317.24, 

respectively, were only recognized in the books on November 27, 2020 since the 

assigned personnel also overlooked the collections which resulted to  delays from 95 

and 74 days in the recognition  of the collections 

 

On the other hand, the NCAD explained that the 14 days delay in recognition 

of audit fees from the National Power Corporation of P8.436 million was due to the 

skeletal work arrangement and limited work schedule.  Further, the collection of 

service fees of P6,736.66 from the Rajah Soliman Science and Technology High 

School was recognized 160 days late due to the unexpected 14-day home quarantine 

as advised by the BTr Management and later on overlooked by the assigned personnel.  

 

With the delayed recognition and approval of transactions totaling P12.658 

million, the balances of the Cash-Collecting Officers and other related accounts did 

not reflect the actual balances on the dates of receipt and deposit of collections 

resulting in the understatement of the affected accounts on a given date. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief, AS, to 

ensure that the concerned Accounting Division Heads: (a) recognize collections 

at the transaction date to reflect the correct balances of the affected accounts; 

and (b)  approve immediately upon review all the transactions created/encoded 

in the NGAS to ensure complete posting and recognition of transactions in the 

NG books. 

 

 

 

 

 

 



108 
 

On Loans Receivables-Government-Owned or Controlled Corporations 

 

g. Unrecognized and unreconciled loans relent to the NIA and MWSS 
 

g.1 Unrecognized relent loan to the NIA 

 

An SLA executed between the ROP and the NIA on August 8, 1986 for the 

relending of a portion of the loan proceeds not exceeding US$4.9 million in equal 

proportions: US$2.450 million from ADB 780-PHI; and US$2.450 million from ADB 

779-PHI in favor of the NIA. The SLAs for ADB 780-PHI and ADB 779-PHI provide 

that the relent loans are payable by the NIA to the ROP until May 15, 2006 and May 

15, 2026, respectively. 

 

Based on the amortization schedule attached in the SLA, the remaining unpaid 

portion of the relent loan for ADB 779-PHI as at December 31, 2020 amounts to 

US$539,000. However, the BTr-NG books shows no record of the disbursement from 

loan ADB 779-PHI to the NIA. General ledgers for CYs 2019 and 2020 of Loans 

Receivables-Government-Owned or Controlled Corporations and Due from 

Government-Owned or Controlled Corporations also show no transaction related to 

the subject loan. 

 

Based on the NIA’s audited FS for CY 2018 from the COA Website, out of the 

reported balance of P6.360 billion of its Loans Payable-Domestic and Advances 

Payable to NGAs as of December 31, 2018, P2.829 billion and P156.480 million were 

recognized for ADB and Special Project Implementation Assistance Loan, 

respectively. Corresponding disclosure in the Notes to FS provides that the NIA 

liabilities reported in the mentioned account represented BTr payments to lending 

banks in its favor. Notices of BTr payments were forwarded periodically to the NIA, 

which then served as the basis of the latter in recording BTr advances in its books. 

Nonetheless, the above NIA liabilities were dropped from its books in CY 2019 after 

having confirmed with the BTr that the accounts were already settled or no longer 

existing.   The NGDAD has no record of the relent loan to NIA and NG advances on 

its repayments.  

 

With the existence of the SLA previously executed between the ROP and NIA, 

absent any evidence of its revocation, and NIA’s previous record on BTr advances, 

the completeness and accuracy of the balances of Due from  Government-Owned or 
Controlled Corporations and Loans Receivables-Government-Owned or Controlled 

Corporations presented in the SFPos as at December 31, 2020 were not ascertained. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief, NGDAD 

to: (a) review all documents related to the SLA for the relending of ADB loans 

779-PHI and 780-PHI and reconcile with the NIA’s records; and (b) make the 

necessary adjustments in the books, as warranted. 

 

 



109 
 

g.2  Unreconciled loan relent to MWSS 

 

As at December 31, 2020, the balance of Loans Receivables-Government-

Owned or Controlled Corporations includes ADB No. 779-PHI of US$6.519 million 

or P313.054 million relent to the MWSS. However, in the course of the audit, several 

differences were noted among the various possible sources of information regarding 

the balance of the relent loan, as follows: 

 The amortization schedule accompanying the MWSS’ repayments showed that the 
semi-annual principal repayment on the loan is US$131,659.00, and the remaining 

unpaid portion of the loan as at December 31, 2020, payable until May 15, 2022, 

had a total of US$394,977.00 or P18.967 million, which is lesser by US$6.124 

million or P294.087 million compared to the balance per books. 

 

 Based on the amortization schedule annexed as Schedule 4 to the SLA, the semi-
annual repayments on the loan is US$63,700 while the unpaid portion of the loan 

as at December 31, 2020 had a total of US$0.701 million or P33.648 million, 

payable until May 15, 2025. Comparison of the said balance with the balance per 

books showed a difference of US$5.818 million or P279.406 million.  

 

 In response to our letter dated January 21, 2021, the MWSS informed that the ADB 
Loan No. 779-PHI had a balance in its books of US$2.672 million or P128.316 

million as at December 31, 2020, which clearly shows a difference of US$3.847 

million or P184.738 million with the BTr-NG books. 

 

The amount of the relent loan recognized under Loans Receivables- 
Government-Owned or Controlled Corporations was based on the SLA, however, 

repayments recognized were based on actual payments by the MWSS following an 

amortization schedule different from that attached to the SLA. 

 

Due to the differences in the balances noted among the various sources of 

information as to the balance of the ADB Loan No. 779-PHI, the accuracy of the 

balances of Loans Receivables-Government-Owned or Controlled Corporations, Due 

from Government-Owned or Controlled Corporations, and Accumulated 

Surplus/(Deficit) presented in the SFPos as at December 31, 2020, and Interest Income 

in the SFPer for the year ended December 31, 2020 was not ascertained.  

  

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief, Debt 

Monitoring and Analysis Division (DMAD) to: (a) determine the applicable 

amortization schedule on the relent loan and its correct balance as at December 

31, 2020; and (b) bill the MWSS for the shortfall in repayments as at December 

31, 2020, if any, and thereafter using the appropriate amortization schedule. 

 

We also recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief, 

NGDAD to: (a) facilitate the reconciliation with the MWSS of the balance of the 

relent loan to determine the correct balances of Loans Receivable-GOCCs and Due 

from Government-Owned or Controlled Corporations; and (b) make the necessary 



110 
 

adjusting entries to correct the balances of Loans Receivable- Government-Owned 

or Controlled Corporations, Due from Government-Owned or Controlled 

Corporations, and Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit), if warranted. 

 

h. Undetermined fees for ADB Loan No. 1746-PHI relent to the MWSS  
 

As at December 31, 2020, MWSS’ outstanding availments on ADB Loan No. 

1746-PHI totaled US$1.876 million. The imposition of one per cent guarantee fee 

based on the Department of Finance (DOF) Order No. 35-89 and MC No. 1-91 was 

adopted in the SLA, notwithstanding the fact that the ADB Loan No. 1746-PHI was 

not a guaranteed loan but a relent loan. However, examination of the GLs for the 

existing NG receivables from the MWSS for CY 2020 and prior years showed that no 

guarantee fee for ADB Loan No. 1746-PHI was billed the MWSS and recognized in 

the NG books. Based on the anniversary dates of the availments in the amortization 

schedule for the said relent loan, the guarantee fee that should be billed the MWSS for 

CY 2020 totaled US$18,758.32 or P0.920 million, converted at the exchange rates at 

the availment’s anniversary dates. According to the Chief, NGDAD, guarantee fee was 

not billed since the loan is relent, thus, is not subject to guarantee fee. The intention of 

the signatories of the SLA might be for imposition of fees or charges other than 

guarantee fees, which must be clarified by the LS to the DOF-Corporate Affairs Group 

(CAG) and MWSS to establish the validity of the provision. Absent any factor that 

vitiates the consent of the signatories of the said SLA, the provision shall continue to 

be in force between the parties, despite having been expressly referred to as guarantee 

fees. 

 

With the provision for the guarantee fee in the SLA of the relent loan,  the 

completeness and accuracy of the balance of Due from Government-Owned or 

Controlled Corporations and Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) presented in the SFPos as 

at December 31, 2020 and Other Service Income in the SFPer for the year ended 

December 31, 2020  was not established.  

 

We recommended that Management require the Director, LS to coordinate 

with the DOF-CAG and MWSS as to the real intention on the provision on the 

imposition of guarantee fee on the ADB Loan No. 1746. 

 

We also recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief, 

NGDAD to determine the amount of the guarantee fee or service due from the 

MWSS for ADB Loan No. 1746 for CY 2020 and prior years, and bill the GOCCs 

accordingly and make necessary entries in the books, as warranted. 

 

On Due to NGAs 

 

i. Non-payment of monthly NRoSS subscription fees  

The NRoSS, the consolidation of the Automated Debt Auction Processing 

System (ADAPS) and RoSS, is the system used by the Fund Management Division 



111 
 

(FMD) for the placement of investment in T-Bills and T-Bonds. Every month there is 

a corresponding subscription fee paid by the BTr for the use of the NRoSS. 

 

Review of the Due to NGAs-NCCA (Escrow) revealed that there is non-payment 

of monthly subscription fee of P1,000.00 by the NCCA for the use of the NRoSS 

starting November 2018. Analysis of the transactions prior to November 2018 

disclosed that the MAAD deducted the RoSS subscription fee from the escrow fund 

of the NCCA by debiting the Due to NGAs-NCCA (Escrow) and crediting the Cash in 

Bank-Local Currency, BSP-TOP (NCCA).  The amount taken from the Cash in Bank-

Local Currency, BSP-TOP (NCCA) was credited to the Other Service Income-RoSS 

Fee in-lump sum together with the other RoSS fee payments from other subscribers. 

 

Inquiry with the MAAD revealed that upon introduction of the NRoSS in 

November 2018, the billing for the monthly subscription fee of the NCCA of 

P1,000.00 was stopped. It was affirmed by the FMD that the monthly subscription fee 

of P5,000.00 for the placement of investment of the BSF in the NRoSS is the same 

access used in investing the NCCA escrow funds. However, the monthly subscription 

fee was only shouldered by the BTr. 

 

Although the subscription fee is a direct expense necessary to invest the escrow 

fund, and both the BTr and NCCA benefited from the subscription, the NCCA was 

not billed the monthly NRoSS subscription fee of P1,000.00. Thus, the balance of 

NCCA’s BTr-managed funds NG’s under Due to NGAs-NCCA (Escrow) was not 

decreased by the amount of the NRoSS subscription fees from November 2018 to 

December 31, 2020. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief, FMD to: 

(a) determine outstanding NRoSS subscription fees and bill the NCCA for the 

same; and (b) deduct from the interest earned on BTr-managed escrow funds the 

monthly NRoSS subscription fee. 

 

On Allowance for Impairment Loss 
 

Analysis of NG receivables and investments disclosed the following deficiencies: 

 

j. Non-provision of allowance for impairment on receivable accounts 

Receivables in the SFPos as at December 31, 2020 amounted to P623.892 

billion. Analysis of the receivable accounts of the NG showed the following 

information that may warrant the provision of allowances for their impairment: 

 

 Notes Receivable with a balance of P137.013 billion represents NG’s receivable 
from the CB-BOL by virtue of the Promissory Note 002-97 issued by the latter on 

July 28, 1997 in favor of the NG. The last entry for this account was on September 

12, 2012 which was only a reversal of a transaction that transpired in CY 1992. 

Currently, the CB-BOL is already dissolved and liquidation of its assets and 

liabilities is ongoing.  



112 
 

 Out of the reported balance of P45.646 billion for Loans Receivable-Government 
Owned or Controlled Corporations, four loan accounts with a total equivalent 

amount of P756.153 million have been dormant from 5 to 15 years. The dormant 

loans include, among others, IBRD loan 18210-PH of the National Housing 

Authority (NHA) and Brady Bonds of the Philippine National Construction 

Corporation (PNCC) with balances as at December 31, 2020 of P192.929 million 

and P480.210 million, respectively. With regard to the IBRD loan 18210-PH, 

NHA informed, through its confirmation reply dated February 23, 2021, that its 

record showed a balance of P95.278 million for the same loan as at December 31, 

2020, or a difference of P97.651 million. For the Brady Bonds, the PNCC’s 

confirmation reply dated October 29, 2020 stated that its record shows no balance, 

contrary to BTr’s record of US$10 million receivable. 

 

 Based on the BTr-NG’s Notes to FSs, Due from National Government Agencies 
included receivables from various NGAs totaling P113.719 million which 

remained dormant for more than 20 years, hence, to be requested for write-off.  

 

 Out of P520.171 billion balance of Due from Government-Owned or Controlled 
Corporations as at December 31, 2020, P11.075 billion is dormant based on the 

disclosure in the Notes to FS. Further, P274.229 billion or 52.72 per cent of the 

balance of the said account represents NG’s receivable from the CB-BOL which 

is considered impaired due to the CB-BOL’s ongoing liquidation. Also, guarantee 

fee receivables and advances on the liabilities of GOCCs that are either non-

operational or inactive, defunct, or under ongoing liquidation remain recognized 

under Due from Government-Owned or Controlled Corporations. 

 

 Due from Local Government Units of P93,371.68 has been outstanding and non-
moving for more than five years. Per inquiry with the concerned MAAD 

personnel, the balance was initially established in 1993, and documents to support 

the claim are no longer available. 

 

 Interests Receivable includes interest from CB-BOL, North Luzon Railway 
Corporation, National Steel Corporation, Partido Development Administration, 

and Technology Resource Center for P3.706 billion. These GOCCs are either 

abolished or under liquidation. Based on BTr’s records, the subject receivables 

have not been moving for years. 

 

 Under Other Receivables are SL Codes 0000 and 0013 amounting to P185.949 
million and P5.086 billion, respectively, which have been dormant for over 20 

years and 10 years, respectively. 

 

Despite the above conditions of the receivables, Management did not conduct 

an assessment to establish the allowance for impairment of the receivables in the NG 

books. As a result, the SFPos is not reflective of the true carrying value of the NG 

receivables. 

 



113 
 

k. Non-provision of allowance for impairment on investments in GOCCs 
 

As at December 31, 2020, Investment in Government Owned or Controlled 

Corporations has a balance of P264.841 billion. Audit of the account disclosed that 

several GOCCs, where the NG has existing investments with an aggregate amount of 

P6.027 billion, have been either abolished/defunct, dissolved, repealed, reorganized, 

or under abolition, as supported by various legislations. Notwithstanding the said 

condition of the concerned GOCCs, the SFPos as at December 31, 2020 showed that 

no allowance was provided for the impairment of the investments in the GOCCs. 

Consequently, the SFPos as at December 31, 2020 is not reflective of the true carrying 

value of the Investments in GOCCs. 

 

While the competence and the prerogative to assess the impairment of financial 

assets rest with the Management, all the circumstances discussed above, to some 

extent, indicate that impairment of the existing financial assets of the NG indeed 

exists.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to ensure that the 

Directors/Chiefs, Asset Management Service (AMS), LS, NGDAD, and MAAD: 

(a) assess the provision of allowance for impairment on outstanding receivables 

of NG financial assets and make an annual assessment of the impairment 

thereafter; and (b) require the concerned Chiefs of Accounting Divisions to make 

the appropriate entries in the books for the allowance for impairment based on 

the assessment made. 

 

 

Compliance Audit 

 

Non-monitoring of the replacement of dishonored checks 

 

3. Non-monitoring of the replacement of dishonored checks upon issuance of the 
NDC of P14,286.42 lengthens the period within which funds are made available to 

the NG. 

 

The CO issues a Notice of Dishonored Checks (NDC) and cancels the 

corresponding OR when AGDBs dishonor checks collected from the payor. The CO 

furnishes the concerned accounting division with the NDC for the setting up of 

receivable for the dishonored payment under the Other Receivables-Dishonored 

Check. With this account, the Accounting Divisions can control and monitor all 

outstanding receivables from dishonored checks and serve as a reminder to follow-up 

with the concerned agencies for the immediate replacement of the dishonored checks.  

 

Review of the SL of Other Receivables-Dishonored Checks revealed that there 

were dishonored checks in CYs 2019 and 2020 totaling P14,286.42 that are still 

unpaid. Inquiry with the CCD under the AMS revealed that after the issuance of the 



114 
 

NDC, no regular monitoring and follow-up is made with the concerned agencies for 

the replacement of the dishonored checks.  

 

Nevertheless, for Inter-Country Adoption Board (ICAB), the CO disclosed that 

it was difficult to monitor the replacement of dishonored checks and payments since 

the agency remits several payments of the same amount monthly. Also, the noted 

dishonored payment was already coordinated and verified with the ICAB through 

phone calls. ICAB explained that verifying the replacement will be challenging since 

ICAB has already transferred to their new office location but assures the CO that 

efforts will be made to provide the necessary information.   

 

For the dishonored payment from Manila Science High School, CO explained 

that instead of replacing the check, the agency remitted the service fee through an 

auto-debit arrangement (ADA) on February 15, 2021.  

 

On the other hand, inquiry with the Accounting Divisions also revealed that 

upon recognition of Other Receivables-Dishonored Checks, no regular monitoring is 

made for the outstanding receivables not yet replaced for payment. 

 

The absence of regular monitoring of the replacement of dishonored checks 

after the issuance of the NDC and of the SL of Other Receivables-Dishonored Checks 

can discharge the payor from the responsibility to remit collections or would lengthen 

the period within which funds are made available to the NG.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Officer-in-

Charge (OIC), AMS to ensure that the CO: (a) follow-up and verify with the 

ICAB the issuance of a replacement check or cash payment for the dishonored 

check; and (b) monitor the prompt replacement of dishonored checks by the 

concerned agencies to ensure that payment is made within five banking days 

upon receipt of NDC by the payor. 

 

We also recommended and Management agreed to require the Director, 

AS to ensure that the concerned Accounting Divisions monitor receivables from 

the dishonored checks to facilitate immediate payment of dishonored checks. 

 

 

 Official Receipts (ORs) for specific fund used for other funds 

 

4. The ORs for different funds of P11.244 million issued for collections of other funds 
precluded the monitoring of accountabilities for each particular fund 

 

Collections by the CO are classified under various funds, namely, the GF, TF 

and MF. Transactions of the GF and TF are recognized in the BTr-RA books while 

the collections for the MF are recognized in the BTr-NG books. MF pertains to various 

NG collections recognized under the Cash-Collecting Officers account.  

 



115 
 

The CO assigns different series of ORs to the designated funds. Each series is 

then labeled with the name of the fund assigned for proper referencing and to avoid 

mishaps of issuing ORs from a different fund. However, examination of the RCD and 

supporting documents revealed that the CO incurred four interchanging issuance of 

ORs totaling P11.244 million for MF instead of GF under her custody despite labeling 

each ORs. 

 

The issuances of ORs for a particular fund for collections of other funds 

precluded the monitoring of accountabilities for each particular fund. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the OIC Chief, CCD 

to instruct the CO of the observance of utmost care in the handling and proper 

issuance of ORs to facilitate monitoring of accountabilities for each fund. 

 

 

Unpaid NRoSS monthly subscription fees 

 

5. Uncollected receivables from NRoSS subscription fees of P3.224 million did not 
make funds available for the payment of maintenance fees at the earliest and most 

reasonable period. 

 

The Memorandum dated August 20, 2018, by the BTr to all NRoSS direct 

participants and BTr sponsored institutional accounts requires that all participants of 

the NRoSS should pay the RoSS subscription fees on the first working day of the 

month, through auto-charge settlement in the RDDA or through check payment in the 

CCD of the BTr, effective August 28, 2018. Further, the same Memorandum provides 

that the BTr reserves the right to charge such other fees and expenses incurred for or 

on account of a Registry Account holder or fees for delayed payment or non-

compliance of the Rules of the Registry and other related agreements. 

 

The NRoSS monthly subscription fees are intended to cover at least the service 

provider’s maintenance fee of US$110,110.71 per year. Also, other fees include the 

access and usage of the various functionalities of the NRoSS, payment of printed 

report generation, and acquisition of e-token.  

 

Prior to the launch and use of the NRoSS System, RoSS participants pay a 

monthly subscription fee to maintain their account with the RoSS to be remitted on 

the 1st day of the succeeding month. The said practice resulted in the setting-up of 

receivables.  

 

Review of the aging of receivables and NGDAD’s RoSS-Other Receivables as 

at December 31, 2020 disclosed that the unpaid RoSS subscription fees from CYs 

2013 to 2020 totaled P3.045 million. Also, the balance of the Other Receivable- RoSS 

Fees as at December 31, 2020 is P3.224 million resulted to a difference of P179,000.00 

against the NGDAD’s RoSS-Other Receivables.  

 



116 
 

When the BTr transitioned to the NRoSS system, the payment schedule was 

modified from the 1st day of the succeeding month to the 1st working day of the month. 

The Payments Division, in-charge of the billing and collection of monthly subscription 

fees, bills the participants every 1st working day of the month while the NGDAD 

recognizes receivables at the end of each quarter for the remaining outstanding NRoSS 

subscription fees.  

 

Meanwhile, the Payments Division informed that there was verbal instruction 

not to collect the outstanding receivables from the RoSS fees prior to CY 2018. Also, 

the PD did not charge a corresponding penalty for the delayed payment of monthly 

subscription fees.  

 

With the length of time it took the participants to remit the payments for the 

monthly subscription fees, the non-collection of outstanding receivables from the 

RoSS fees prior to CY 2018 and the non-charging of penalty, funds were not made 

available for the payment of maintenance fees to the service provider of the NRoSS at 

the earliest and most reasonable period, among others.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief, Payments 

Division to: (a) charge penalty on the delayed remittances of monthly NRoSS 

subscription fees to make the same available for the payment of the NRoSS 

maintenance fees; (b) inform the NRoSS participants of the change of due date 

for the payment of NRoSS monthly subscription fees  to the 1st working day of 

each month to ensure timely remittance of payments; and (c) bill and require the 

participants to settle all outstanding receivables from the NRoSS subscription 

fees. 

 

We also recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Chief, 

NGDAD to regularly monitor the receivables from the NRoSS subscription fees 

and coordinate the same with the Payments Division to ensure immediate 

remittance of monthly subscription fees. 

 

 

Non-remittance of NCCA escrow funds to the BSP-TOP-TSA account  

 

6. Non-compliance with the letter instructions of the NCCA on the remittance of the 
NEFCA funds and interest earned thereon and of the National Endowment for 

NECA funds from CYs 2016-2020 to the BSP-TOP-TSA account did not earn 

additional interest of 3.45 per cent reducing the interest income of the funds. 

 

In letters dated March 10, 28, and May 2, 2016, the NCCA requested  the BTr 

to place the NEFCA funds of P1.748 billion, P80.882 million and P10.242 million, 

respectively, or a total of P1.839 billion, deposited to the LBP-BTr-NCCA Trust 

Account to the BSP-TOP-TSA account. 

 



117 
 

Also, in a letter dated August 10, 2017, for the investment of the NECA Seed 

Capital of P300.000 million on the T-Bonds, the NCCA explicitly proposed to the BTr 

the investment of the interest earned from the NECA Seed Capital in the TSA or T-

Bills to ensure the availability of the funds when the need arises. 

 

To comply with the NCCA’s letters, the Receipts Investment and Disbursement 

Division (RIDD) prepared the Fund Transfer Slips to transfer the NEFCA and NECA 

funds from the LBP-BTr-NCCA Trust Account to the BSP-TOP-TSA account and 

forwarded the Slips to the Fund Transfer Division (FTD). Based on the Fund Transfer 

Slips, the FTD prepared the Fund Transfer Letter of Authority and submitted it to the 

LBP. 

 

 Review of the transactions recognized in the LBP-BTr-NCCA Trust Account 

revealed that the NECA Seed Capital of P300.000 million was deposited by the NCCA 

to the LBP-BTr-NCCA Trust Account on August 3, 2017, and the BTr transferred the 

fund to the BSP-TOP TSA on August 8, 2017.  

 

For NEFCA funds, the P80.882 million and P10.242 million deposited with the 

LBP-BTr-NCCA Trust Account on March 28, 2016 and May 2, 2016, respectively, 

were all transferred to the BSP-TOP-TSA the following day. However, of the deposit 

of P1,748 billion on March 10, 2016, there was  an unremitted balance of P10,520.79 

that was not transferred to the BSP-TOP-TSA on March 11, 2016. 

 

On the other hand, aside from the P10,520.79 unremitted balance of NEFCA 

funds from CY 2016, balances of the NECA Seed Capital in CY 2017, and additional 

NEFCA funds from CYs 2018 to 2020 earned a total interest of P39,017.41, net of 

tax, while deposited to the LBP-BTr-NCCA Trust Account. Thus, the balance of the 

account of P49,538.20 as at December 31, 2020. 

 

Interview with the FMD disclosed that the interest rates from CYs 2016 to 2020 

are variable. However, as of December 31, 2020, the current interest rates of the LBP 

and BSP-TSA are 0.05 per cent and 3.5 per cent, respectively. Further, it was disclosed 

that the LBP-BTr-NCCA-Trust Account requires a minimum maintaining balance of 

P30,000.00 in compliance with the government passbook account.  Thus, the balance 

of P19,538.20, which is the difference of the balance of LBP-BTr-NCCA Trust 

Account and the required minimum maintaining balance of P30,000.00, which was 

not transferred to the BSP-TOP-TSA did not earn an additional interest of 3.45 per 

cent reducing the interest income of the fund.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Chief, RIDD to: 

(a) transfer the P19,538.20 from the LBP-BTr-NCCA Trust Account to the BSP-

TOP-TSA in compliance with NCCA’s letters to maximize the interest earned of 

the fund; and (b) monitor regularly the balance of the LBP-BTr-NCCA Trust 

Account and transfer any amount in excess of the required minimum balance to 

the BSP-TOP-TSA account to earn more interest and to manage the NEFCA and 

NECA escrow funds effectively. 



118 
 

The RIDD already transferred the amount of P19,538.20 to the BSP-TOP-TSA 

on April 15, 2021. 

 

 

Non-compliance in the required submission of supporting documents for the NG share in 

the PAGCOR’s income  

 

7. Non-submission of the necessary supporting documents by the PAGCOR did not 
enable the BTr to determine the completeness and correctness of the remitted 50 

per cent NG share from PAGCOR’s income. 

 

From CYs 2017 to 2020, the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation 

(PAGCOR) only submitted to the BTr the Transmittal Letter and the PAGCOR’s 

Statement of Franchise Tax, Government Share and Philippine Sports Commission 

Share, based on the income from gaming operations. The Statement does not, 

however, provide the details necessary to determine the correctness of the remittance 

of the NG’s share from PAGCOR’s income. Further, no other document was 

submitted by the PAGCOR, especially for those months with prior year’s adjustments 

as mentioned in the Transmittal Letter.  

 

Moreover, upon inquiry on PAGCOR’s submission of yearly audited FSs, the 

MAAD disclosed that the PAGCOR has not been submitting its audited FSs.  

 

The non-submission of the necessary documents, including the copy of the 

audited FSs as required in the DOF Department Circular No. 2-98, did not enable the 

BTr to ascertain the completeness and correctness of the 50 per cent NG share in the 

PAGCOR’s income remitted to the BTr.   

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the PAGCOR, 

through the MAAD, to submit the necessary supporting documents and the year-

end audited FSs to facilitate the determination of the completeness and 

correctness of the remitted 50 per cent NG share in PAGCOR’s income and the 

adjustments made on the amount paid at year-end.  

 

The MAAD already sent a letter dated May 21, 2021 to the PAGCOR, 

requesting the PAGCOR for the submission of the necessary supporting documents 

and the year-end audited FSs to facilitate the review of the remitted 50 per cent NG 

share in the PAGCOR’s income. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



119 
 

Non-compliance in the required remittance date of NG shares in the PAGCOR’s income 

 

8. Delayed remittances of the 50 per cent NG Share in the PAGCOR’s income to the 
BTr did not make available funds to finance the intended NG projects. 

 

Review of the JEVs related to the entries made under Share from 

PAGCOR/PCSO from CYs 2017 to 2020 revealed that the PAGCOR incurred 7-13 

days delays after the 10th day of the succeeding month for the remittance of the 

monthly 50 per cent NG Share in the PAGCOR’s income to the BTr.  

  

Under the DOF Department Circular No. 2-98, there was no provision for 

penalty in case of delays in the remittance of the monthly 50 per cent  NG share by 

the PAGCOR. However, as provided in Sec. 12 of PD 1869, the remittance of the 

monthly 50 per cent NG share from PAGCOR’s income is intended for various 

infrastructure and socio-economic projects within the Metropolitan area and 

throughout the Philippines.   Thus, the delays in the remittances of the monthly 50 per 

cent NG share did not make such funds readily available to the NG to finance the 

intended projects. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief, MAAD 

to coordinate with the PAGCOR to require the timely remittance of the 50 per 

cent NG share every 10th day of the succeeding month to make funds available to 

finance the intended projects. 

 

The MAAD already sent letter dated May 21, 2021 to the PAGCOR, requesting 

the strict compliance on the remittance of the 50 per cent NG share in the PAGCOR’s 

income every 10th day of the succeeding month. 

 

 

Non-compliance with the Facility Agency Agreement dated November 11, 2020 between 

the BTr and LBP 

 

9. Advance payment of agency fee to LBP as facility agent on the issuance of the 2nd 
tranche of the Peso-Denominated Premyo Bonds (Premyo Bonds 2) resulted in the 

unwarranted release of the agency fee and recognition of Bond Issue Cost-

Domestic of P0.750 million. 

 

On December 16, 2020, the BTr issued the Premyo Bonds 2 with ISIN 

PPBD0121L027 at a face amount of P6.561 million. One of the features of the Premyo 

Bonds 2 is the entitlement of every investor to an Electronic Rewards Number which 

serves as a raffle entry for every P500.00 worth of investment, thus, giving investors 

the chance to win any of the main cash rewards, additional rewards and special cash 

rewards as applicable. In this connection, a Facility Agency Agreement was entered 

into by and between the BTr and LBP on November 11, 2020, to define, among others, 

the LBP’s scope of services as facility agent. 

 



120 
 

Under Section 2.02 (c) of the Agreement, the BTr, in return for the services 

rendered by the LBP as facility agent, shall pay the LBP the following fees: 
 

 

 

Acceptance and 

Opening Fee 
Twenty-five thousand pesos only (P25,000.00) 

Agency Fee Flat fee of one million pesos (P1,000,000.00) per annum to be collected 
quarterly 

Out-of-pocket 

Expenses 
Five hundred thousand pesos (P500,000.00) per annum for the expenses 

involving the management and other compliance activities. Any excess 

thereof shall be returned to the BTr at the end of the engagement. In case the 

said amount is insufficient, the BTr shall replenish the OPEs within three  

banking days from receipt of notice of such insufficiency. 
 

On December 15, 2020, the LBP sent a billing statement to the BTr in relation 

to the Agreement in the amount of P1.525 million, broken down as follows: P25,000 

for acceptance and opening fee; P1 million for agency fee; and P0.500 million for 

OPEs. In response to such billing statement, the BTr issued a memo dated December 

28, 2020 authorizing the BSP to credit the LBP’s demand deposit account for the 

settlement of the billed amount. The payment was recognized under Bond Issue Cost-

Domestic.  

 

It is worth emphasizing that the Agreement expressly provides that the agency 

fee of P1 million is payable quarterly, hence, the NG’s quarterly disbursement for 

agency fee of P250,000. This is in consonance with the LBP’s quarterly duty to 

facilitate the raffle of the cash rewards. However, contrarily, the LBP’s billing 

statement in December 2020, which was settled by the BTr in the same month, 

includes the total agency fee for the entire year. Non-compliance with the Agreement 

resulted in the recognition of  the agency fee of P1 million under Bond Issue Cost-

Domestic  instead of  only P250,000, hence, the difference of P0.750 million. 

 

Demanding for the outright payment of the agency fee instead of on a quarterly 

basis is an express departure from the Agreement, which must have been objected to 

by the BTr. However, the BTr settled the amount in accordance with the billing 

statement, thus resulting in the non-compliance with the Agreement and Section 88 of 

the PD No. 1445 and the unwarranted release of the agency fee and recognition of 

Bond Issue Cost-Domestic of P0.750 million.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief, Securities 

Origination Division to review and strictly implement the terms of all future 

contracts and agreements with regard to the issuance of T-Bonds.

Other Issues 

 

Non-availability of MOAs BTr and NGAs for escrow funds 

 

10. Non-availability of the MOA between the BTr and NGAs for the escrow funds 
precluded the determination of the nature and purpose of the escrow funds as well 

as the compliance with the obligations agreed upon. 

  

Funds transferred by the NGAs for management by the BTr are covered by 

MOAs.  These funds recognized under Due to NGAs are deposited in the BSP-TOP-

TSA, for peso account, and DBP and/or United Coconut Planters Bank, for dollar 

account. The FMD either invested some funds in the time deposits or GS like T-Bills 

and T-Bonds, which in return earned interest for the benefit of the NGAs concerned.  

Out of the 7 MOAs with the NGAs, only the MOA for the NEFCA was provided to 

the Audit Team.  

 

According to the FMD, it was only created in CY 2014, and copies of the MOAs 

for escrow funds prior to their creation are not available. It was also informed that the 

RIDD previously managed the escrow funds. The RIDD explained that due to the 

transfer of BTr to its current office in CY 2013, the copies of the MOA for the 

remaining six escrow funds could not be found. Further, the RIDD requested the 

concerned NGAs for the copies of the MOA, however, the NGAs’ copy could not also 

be found. 

 

Due to the non-submission of the MOAs between the BTr and the NGAs 

concerned, the nature and purpose of the escrow funds as well as the compliance with 

the obligations agreed upon between the BTr and NGAs was not determined. 

  

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief, FMD to 

compile and safekeep copies of the MOA with NGAs of managed funds as 

reference/guide in ensuring the compliance by the BTr and NGAs with their 

obligations as stated in the MOA.  

 

 

Unverified NGAs remittances of the idle/unutilized funds 

 

11. Unverified remittances of the idle/unutilized funds by the NGAs from CYs 2014 
and 2019 of P15.117 billion and P15.111 billion, respectively, were at risk of 

unauthorized use and had not provided funds for the NG’s operations, if 

unremitted to the BTr. 

 

In CY 2015, 91 NGAs were identified to have idle and/or unutilized cash in 

bank balances aggregating to P18.503 billion in CY 2014 and which were 

recommended by the respective Auditors for remittance to the BTr,. These cash 

balances partake the nature of (a) unremitted income from regular operations; (b) bank 

interest income; (c) performance/bidders bond; (d) dormant accounts, (e) cash from 



122 
 

unauthorized deposit accounts; (f) unutilized project funds/terminated balance of the 

project funds; (g) deposits from Letters of Credit; (h) unutilized Notice of Cash 

Allocations (NCAs); (i) unused Priority Development Assistance Fund/Disbursement 

Acceleration Program (PDAF/DAP) balances; and (j) other trust funds and donations.  

 

Also, the Audit Team recommended to the BTr the monitoring of the 

remittances of the idle/unutilized funds totaling P18.503 billion. The NCAD verified 

a total remittance of P2.867 billion out of the P18.503 billion idle/unutilized funds 

shown in the NGAs Outstanding Cash for Remittance Report, based on the submitted 

report from the ROs/POs, leaving the remaining P15.636 billion for further 

verification. 

 

For the remaining P15.636 billion, the NCAD explained that the tracing and 

monitoring of the remittances of the idle/unutilized cash balances of NGAs are 

challenging due to the lack of information or details on the funds remitted to the BTr. 

Also, some are remitted through the BTr-CO or together with other National 

Collecting Officer (NCO) collections through the BTr Regular Clearing Accounts.    

 

On February 1, 2021, confirmation letters were sent to the 91 NGAs to confirm 

the remittance of the idle/unutilized funds totaling P18.503 billion. As of April 30, 

2021, 19 out of 91 or 20.88 per cent of the NGAs responded to the confirmation letter.  

Based on the confirmations received, P2.304 billion were remitted to the BTr; P19.751 

million utilized by the NGAs; P9.775 million returned to the sourced agencies; 

P60.000 million pending review/evaluation and approval of the PC for the utilization 

of the NGA; and P800,000.00 transferred to the LGU of Basey, Western Samar on 

June 8, 2015, per signed MOA between Mindanao Development Authority and the 

LGU of Basey Western Samar.   

 

Comparison between the verified remittances by the NCAD against the 

confirmed remittances of idle/unutilized funds by the NGAs disclosed that out of the 

P2.867 billion verified remittances by the NCAD, only the P1.874 billion was included 

in the confirmed NGAs’ remittances. Thus, the remaining balance of P15.117 billion 

is still for further verification and monitoring. 

 

From the CY 2019 AARs of the 304 NGAs, 82 NGAs with idle/unutilized funds 

totaling P15.506 billion were identified. The Auditors of these NGAs recommended 

the remittance of the same to the National Treasury. The nature of these cash balances 

are, among others: (a) unremitted collections from regular operations, (b) sale from 

bidding documents, (c) performance bond, (d) guaranty/security deposits and warranty 

retention, (e) interest income on bank deposits, (f) dormant/inactive accounts, (g) 

unauthorized bank accounts, (h) unutilized/unexpended balance on completed 

projects, (i) liquidated damages, and (j) donations and/or grants from local/foreign 

sources. 

 

Based on the NCAD’s summary of collections, a total of P395.731 million of 

the P15.506 billion idle/unutilized funds had been remitted by the NGAs to the BTr 



123 
 

for CY 2020. However, these remittances were only through the BTr-CO since the 

NCAD has not yet coordinated with the BTr- ROs/POs for the report of idle/unutilized 

funds remitted for CY 2020. Thus, the remaining P15.111 billion is still for 

verification. 

  

The NCAD also informed that the remittances of idle/unutilized funds will be 

captured in the National Government Collection and Disbursement System (NGCDS). 

However, the NGCDS is not yet operational. While waiting for the NGCDS, the BTr- 

ROs/Provincial Offices are still using the National Collection System Report. The 

collections are manually encoded and classified based on the supporting documents 

gathered from the AGDBs, which usually take time, thus, resulting in unverified and 

unclassified remittances. 

 

The idle/unutilized funds of NGAs from CYs 2014 and 2019 of P15.117 billion 

and P15.111 billion, respectively, when not yet remitted to the BTr, are at risk of 

unauthorized use  and  had not provided the BTr with funds for the NG’s operations, 

if unremitted to the NG. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed  to require the Chief, NCAD 

to; (a) exercise its functions and responsibilities on the monitoring of remittances 

of idle/unutilized cash balances of all NGAs, such as through direct coordination 

with the heads of agencies on the appropriate actions for the idle/unremitted 

funds; (b) make use of the yearly AARs on the NGAs to serve as bases in the 

monitoring of the idle/unutilized funds  for remittance to the BTr; (c) coordinate 

with the NGAs with reported idle/unutilized funds to facilitate immediate 

remittance of such funds to the BTr; and (d) coordinate regularly with the BTr-

ROs/POs, pending the implementation of the NGCDS, for the submission of 

reports on idle/unutilized fund remittances of the NGAs for  monitoring of fund 

balances. 

 

 

COVID-19 Funds 

 

COVID-19 Fund Remittances 

 

The RA No. 11469 also known as the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act dated March 

23, 2020 declared the existence of a National Emergency Arising from the Coronavirus 

Disease 2019 (COVID-19) situation which authorized the President of the Philippines to 

adopt temporary emergency measures to respond to crisis brought by the COVID-19 

pandemic. 

 

Section 4(y) of RA No. 11469 authorized the President to allocate cash, funds, 

investments, including unutilized or unreleased subsidies and transfers, held by any 

government owned or controlled corporations or any national government agency in order 

to address the COVID-19 emergency. 

 



124 
 

In response to the RA No. 11469, the DOF and DBM issued Joint Circular No. 1 

dated March 30, 2020 for the guidelines and procedures in the collection and utilization of 

the pooled resources to fund social amelioration measures. 

 

In compliance with the DBM and DOF Joint Circular No. 1, the DOF issued 

Memorandum dated March 30, 2020 instructing the BTr to transfer cash balances in the 

bank accounts of the identified departments, agencies, bureaus, institutions and other 

offices of the NG maintained outside of the TSA Account in order that these may be used 

to fund programs and policies to address the COVID-19 emergency. 

 

As a result, as at December 31, 2020, the BTr was able to sweep from the bank 

accounts of the concerned NGAs a total of P45.623 billion. However, upon request of the 

NGAs, the BTr returned P8.747 billion for those with existing obligations.  

 

In the BTr-NG books, the bank balances which had been transferred to TOP bank 

accounts were recognized initially under Due to NGAs. However, when the NGAs, through 

a letter, informed the BTr that the bank balances transferred to the TOP bank accounts are 

to form part of the General Fund to fund the COVID-19 pandemic, the NCAD reclassified 

the funds under Assistance from Other National Government Agencies. As at December 

31, 2020, the balances of Due to NGAs and Assistance from Other National Government 

Agencies were P21.324 billion and P15.552 billion, respectively.  

 

COVID-19 Funds Releases 

 

In response to the RA No. 11469, the DBM issued the guidelines on the release and 

utilization of the Bayanihan Grant to Cities and Municipalities (BGCM) and Bayanihan 

Grant to Provinces (BGP) under the Local Budget Circular (LBC) Nos. 125 and 126, 

respectively. Also, the DBM provided the corresponding SARO and Advice of Notice of 

Cash Allocation Issued (ANCAI) to the BTr for the said grants. 

 

On April 15,17 and 20, 2020, or two to five days upon receipt of the SAROs and 

ANCAIs, for the BGCM and BGP of P30.824 billion and P6.197 billion, respectively, the 

MAAD released all funds in accordance with the allocation provided in the LBC Nos. 125 

and 126 to the BTr-ROs with jurisdiction over the LGUs concerned.  

 

Further, the DBM issued various SAROs and ANCAIs for the Local Government 

Support Fund-COVID-19 Financial Assistance to the LGUs as indicated in the RA No. 

11494, also known as the Bayanihan to Recover as One Act. As at December 31, 2020, the 

total SAROs issued from October to December 2020 was P1.240 billion but the 

corresponding ANCAIs only totaled P1.229 billion. Consequently, the MAAD only 

released P1.229 billion to the BTr-ROs for transfer to the LGUs concerned, while the 

remaining P11 million was not covered by an ANCAI.   In January 2021, the DBM issued 

another ANCAI for P11 million, for which funds were immediately released by the MAAD 

to the concerned LGUs.  

 



125 
 

On the other hand, the DBM issued another SARO of P51 billion for the Small 

Business Wage Subsidy (SBWS) Program intended to provide a wage subsidy to 

complement the social amelioration programs under Bayanihan to Heal as One Act and to 

support the formal sector employers and their employees. Upon receipt of the SARO and 

ANCAI from the DBM, the MAAD released the SBWS funds in two tranches, P25.5 billion 

each, to the Social Security System on April 27 and May 12, 2020, to comply with the 

SBWS Program Task Force Resolution No. 1, that the 1st and 2nd tranches shall be paid out 

until May 31, 2020 and June 15, 2020, respectively. 

 

However, from June to December 2020, the employers returned a total of P5.362 

billion out of P51 billion to the BTr to comply with the following guidelines on the return 

of the amount received under the SBWS Program outlined in the SBWS Task Force 

Resolution No. 2:  

 

 Employers who (i) failed to maintain the employment status of all employee 
beneficiaries before the ECQ and other forms thereof and throughout the SBWS or (ii) 

made misrepresentation in their application the fact of payment of wages or other 

material facts relevant to the eligibility of their employees; and  

 Employees who resigned during the period of ECQ and other forms thereof imposed in 
Luzon and other parts of the country. 

 

Lastly, for the Covid-19 Assistance to Restart Enterprises Program under Pondo sa 

Pagbabago at Pag-Asenso Program, the DBM issued ANCAI for P500 million from the 

P1.5 billion SARO released to the Small Business Corporation (SBC).  On June 9, 2020, 

the MAAD released the P500 million to the SBC. The release was sourced from the Regular 

Agency Fund, Budgetary Support to Government Owned or Controlled Corporations, RA 

No. 11465 (the General Appropriations Act for the Fiscal Year 2020).
