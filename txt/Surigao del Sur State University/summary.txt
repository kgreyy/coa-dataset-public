C.	Audit Opinion



8)	The Auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 in view of the following:



i)	The accuracy and validity of year-end balance of Cash in Bank – Local Currency, Current Account of ₱511,538,271.75 cannot be relied upon due to (a) existence of dormant accounts and abnormal credit balance amounting to ₱1,072,095.86 and ₱613,520.46, respectively; (b) reconciling items reported as additions and deductions totaling ₱10,966,088.70 and ₱7,237,077.90, respectively, remained unadjusted at year-end; (c) stale checks totaling ₱748,676.18 remained unadjusted in the books of accounts; and (d) non-preparation of bank reconciliation statements;



ii)	The existence of Due from NGAs amounting to ₱438,232.64 is doubtful as the amount remained non-moving for over 12 years in the University’s books, and neither was there any disclosure of facts and/or details in the Notes to Financial Statements pertaining thereto nor any evidence ascertaining the efforts of the Accounting Unit to verify, analyze and validate the existence of this receivable account;



iii)	Procurement of various books for Cantilan, Lianga and Tagbina Campus libraries with unit cost below the capitalization threshold of ₱15,000.00 was erroneously recorded as Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) under the account of “Books” with cost totaling ₱5,658,814.34 while semi-expandable properties of Tandag City Main Campuses which were already issued to end-users were still carried under PPE account with cost totaling ₱1,942,444.25, overstating the affected PPE accounts and understating the affected semi-expendable expenses account;



iv)	Unreconciled difference of ₱426,713,175.87 between the reported balances of various Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) accounts in the books of accounts of the SDSSU Tandag Main, Lianga, Cagwait, San Miguel and Cantilan Campuses and the Report of Physical Count of PPE;



v)	Prior year’s expenses aggregating ₱1,660,267.22 of Tagbina Campus were erroneously recorded as current year expenses, thus resulted in the overstatement of the affected expenses accounts and understatement of the surplus for the current period; and



vi)	Non-issuance of official receipts for collections received from enrolment fees of students by the Cash Clerk resulted in the accumulation of unreceipted, undeposited and unrecorded collections totaling ₱110,800.00, thus, understated the Cash-Collecting Officer and School Fees accounts.



9)		For the foregoing observations which caused the issuance of a qualified opinion, we recommended that Management: 

	

i)	Direct the Accountant to strengthen the effectiveness of the Accounting’s internal control system by installing verification procedures in every transaction to avoid errors. Review, analyze and investigate the causes of the noted discrepancies and effect the necessary adjustments to establish correct and reliable balance of Cash in Bank – LCCA;



Instruct the Accountant to conduct thorough review and exert extra effort to determine the details of the dormant accounts and abnormal balance to facilitate corrections/adjustments of the same. Ensure that prior to closure of a dormant bank account, reconciliation is made between book and bank balances in accordance with Section 58 and 74 of PD 1445;



Follow-up in writing to the depository bank their request for the details of the debit and credit memoranda transactions for the preparation of journal entry voucher and to effect the necessary adjustments in the books of accounts. Ensure that all reconciling items are thoroughly reviewed and adjusted immediately to present an accurate and reliable cash balances in the financial statements; 



Instruct the concerned Accountants and Bookkeepers to make the necessary adjustments to take up the stale checks and all other reconciling items affecting the cash balance per books and consequently record them in the General Journal; and





Require the Accountant and Bookkeepers of concerned Campuses to submit immediately the overdue Bank Reconciliation Statements pursuant to Chapter 21 of GAM Volume I to prove the correctness of the CIB-LCCA balance reported in the financial statements.



ii)	Direct the Accountant to review, analyze and validate the existence of the dormant Due from NGAs account. If after thorough analysis and verification, and considering that all efforts/remedies to enforce collection had already been exhausted yet still failed, and/or the necessary pertinent documents could no longer be located in spite of exhausting all reasonable efforts to do so, a request for a write-off to the COA of the subject accounts may be made.



iii)	Direct the Accountant and concerned Bookkeepers to draw the necessary adjusting Journal Entry Voucher (JEV) to reclassify the books and other semi-expendable items erroneously recorded under PPE account as Inventory and recognized the same as expense upon issuance to end-users based on the Report of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI) and Requisition and Issue Slip (RIS). And thereafter to observe the ₱15,000.00 capitalization threshold when classifying/recording a tangible item as PPE;



iv)	Require the Property Unit to use the Revised Chart of Accounts for the PPE account titles and thereafter both the Accounting and Property units to conduct reconciliation of their records relative to the affected PPE account balances and submit to the Office of the Auditor a report reconciling the discrepancies indicated above, including the itemization of all the PPE items and indicating the reason/s of the discrepancies noted therein;



v)	Direct the Bookkeeper to stop the practice of charging prior year’s expenses to current year’s accounts and immediately adopt accrual basis of accounting by recognizing and recording effects of transactions and other events in the periods to which they relate; and



vi)	Immediately issue official receipts for the ₱110,800.00 collections received through Palawan Express, deposit promptly to the authorized government depository bank and submit the Report of Collections and Deposits to the Accounting Unit for the proper recording of the same.



	D.	Summary of Significant Observations and Recommendations

	

10)		The other significant observations and recommendation for CY 2020 are as follows: 

	

i)	Due to lack of adequate planning, airline tickets were purchased on or before the actual date of travels of the University’s officials and employees of which airfares were more expensive than those purchased days or weeks before the activity, thus, resulted in inefficient and uneconomic usage of government funds. Moreover, purchase of the same from a travel agency was priced higher by ₱1,229.40 to ₱8,833.44 or an average of 36.53 percent compared when purchasing directly from airline companies, thus not advantageous to the government.



We recommended that Management:



Direct the personnel in-charged to develop or strengthen measures over the planning and budgeting so that airline tickets are acquired days or weeks before the actual activity to obtain the most advantageous price for the government and minimize travel cost; 



Provide complete information in the Travel Orders such as date and control number and any other relevant information; and



Consider purchasing airfares for official travels directly from the airline companies instead of engaging the services of travel agencies to save on travel cost and generate savings for the government.



ii)	Purchase of various supplies and materials amounting to ₱192,979.25 of Bislig Campus were taken up in the books of accounts as outright expense instead of recording the same under Inventory account contrary to Section 7 and 13, Chapter 8 of GAM Volume I. Moreover, supplies ledger cards and stock cards to monitor and account the receipts and issuances of inventories were not maintained by the Accounting and Supply Units, respectively, thus impeded the reconciliation and verification of records.



We recommended that Management:



a)	Accountant



Record in the appropriate inventory account all purchases of supplies and materials upon acceptance of the delivered items, except purchased out of the petty cash fund, in accordance with the perpetual inventory system of accounting;

Maintain the appropriate Supplies Ledger Card (SLC) for each item of stock/inventory based on the copy of purchase order, inspection and acceptance report and delivery receipt;



Credit the inventory account only upon receipt of the Report of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI) and Requisition and Issue Slip (RIS) from the Supply Unit; and



Reconcile supplies ledger cards with the stock cards and report of physical count on inventories of the Supply Unit.











b)	Supply Officer



Maintain the appropriate Stock Cards (SC) for each item of stock/inventory and regularly prepare the RSMI based on the approved RIS and submit to the Accounting Unit for the proper recording in the books of accounts; and



Effect regular reconciliation of the balances of SC with the SLC of the Accounting Unit.



iii)	Inadequate internal control over the receipt of collections of school fees paid through Bayad Center Pera Padala resulted in unmonitored and uncontrolled receipts of funds totaling ₱110,800.00. Likewise, completeness and propriety of the amount cannot be established due to absence of check and balance contrary to Section 123 of PD No. 1445 and Chapter 3 of the National Guidelines on Internal Control Systems.



We recommended that Management:



Create a committee which will be tasked to ensure the all remittances sent thru Bayad Center for the year 2020 have been accounted for and furnish COA copy of the result of confirmation/verification;



Ensure that a written authority will be issued for the assignment of the Cash Clerk to specifically define the terms of the particular transactions which could be acted upon by a delegatee, the limitations in the authority, and the particular purposes for which said authority may be used; and



Install adequate control measures on the online enrolment system to ensure that receipts from whatever payment platform employed will be adequately secured and safeguarded against loss/misuse.



iv)	The adequacy and effectiveness of the internal controls over disbursements were deemed insufficient as expenses incurred for the University’s COVID mitigation initiatives totaling ₱264,012.50 were not supported with complete documentation, contrary to Sections 4(6) and 124 of P.D. No. 1445 and COA Circular No. 2012-001, thus validity and propriety of the disbursements could not be ascertained. 



We recommended that Management:



Advise the concerned Project Coordinators to improve the existing guidelines on the selection process of program recipients so as to preclude suspicion of favoritism, bias and irregularities in the process; 



Instruct the Accountant of the Main Campus and Bookkeeper of Cantialn Campus to process only claims with complete supporting documents to establish the validity of transaction; 



Likewise, submit the following documents to enable the audit team to make a decision in audit:



a)	The name of 11 approved adopted barangays as well as the complete list of the intended beneficiaries;

b)	Distribution sheets of the 650 food packs with complete information of the recipient’s nature of work, address, contact number, signature;

c)	Attendance sheets with complete information; and

d)	Certificate from the Barangay Captain to attest that the identified beneficiaries were bonafide underemployed/ unemployed and displaced marginal workers in the area.



v)	Accuracy and propriety in the recording of transactions of Tagbina and Bislig Campus totaling ₱25,200,760.80 cannot be ascertained due to absence of journal entry vouchers attached to each disbursement voucher, contrary to Section 111 of PD No. 1445, thus impeded the Audit Team from determining the propriety of the recorded transactions and affected the reliability of the financial statements.



We recommended that Management require the Bookkeepers of Tagbina and Bislig Campuses to prepare a Journal Entry Voucher for each transaction as basis of recording in the General Journal, Cash Receipt Journal, Cash Disbursement Journal and Check Disbursement Journal. All disbursement vouchers together with its supporting documents should be accompanied with an approved Journal Entry Voucher which shall be the key document of the Bookkeeper in recording, classifying and summarizing transactions in the books of accounts.



vi)	The University did not fully implement the Modified Direct Payment Scheme (MDPS) for payment of accounts payable due to creditors/payees totaling ₱167,313,374.71 contrary to DBM Circular No. 2013-16 and 2018-14, thus defeated the purpose of MDPS in promoting a more efficient payment system.



We recommended that Management require the Cashier to limit the issuance of MDS checks to the barest minimum and to fully implement the use of Modified Direct Payment Scheme (MDPS) in paying obligations due to creditors/payees.



vii)	Checks and ADA Disbursement Records (CkADADRec), Cash Disbursement Record (CDRec), Report of Cash Disbursements (RCDisb) and Report of Accountability for Accountable Forms (RAAF) were not prepared and maintained by the Cashier of Tagbina Campus from CY 2016 to CY 2020 contrary to the provisions of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) and the Revised Cash Examination Manual, thus, causing difficulty in determining the cash accountabilities at any given time.





We recommended that Management require the Cashier to prepare and maintain the Checks and ADA Disbursement Records (CkADADRec), Cash Disbursement Record (CDRec), Report of Cash Disbursements (RCDisb) and Report of Accountability for Accountable Forms (RAAF) for CY 2016 to CY 2020 in prescribed format pursuant to the provisions of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) and the Revised Cash Examination Manual.



viii)		The monthly trial balance, quarterly financial statements as well as the monthly bank reconciliation statements of the University were not submitted to the Office of the Auditor in a timely manner as required under Section 122 of P.D. 1445, Section 60, Chapter 19 and Section 7, Chapter 21 of the GAM, Volume I, precluding the timely conduct of audit on the said accounts and errors, if any, could not be detected and corrected immediately.

	

	We recommended that Management:

	

Require the Accountant to strictly comply with Section 122 of PD No. 1445, Section 60, Chapter 19 and Section 7, Chapter 21 of the GAM, Volume I, in the submission of the financial reports to the Commission to facilitate the timely audit of the account balance.



Coordinate with the University’s Landbank depository branch and comply with the required enrollment forms and other documentary requirements for the enrollment in LANDBANK weAccess facility.

	

ix)	Disbursement vouchers (DVs) and duplicate copy of official receipts (ORs) together with its supporting documents were not submitted to the Office of the Auditor within the prescribed period as required contrary to Section 7 of COA Circular No. 94-001, and Section 7.2.1(a), Chapter I of the 2009 RRSA, casting doubts on the validity and propriety of the transactions and precluding the Audit Team from the timely audit and review of the transactions and communication of audit results.



We recommended that Management:



Direct the Cashier to submit within five days after the end of each month the DVs together with its supporting documents, to the Accountant. Accordingly, the Accountant shall immediately record the submitted reports and documents in the books of accounts and submit the same to the Auditor within the first 10 days of the ensuing month; and 



Submit immediately all DVs and ORs for the covering period together with its supporting documents for the conduct of auditorial review.
