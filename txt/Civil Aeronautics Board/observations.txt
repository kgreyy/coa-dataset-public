A. FINANCIAL AUDIT  
 

There were no material misstatements in the financial statements of the CAB. 
Accounting errors and improper accounting treatment of transactions that are 
considered departure from the IPSASs totaling to P16,919,206.44 as summarized in 
Annex A were adjusted in the CAB’s books of accounts as of year-end.  
 

 
Accounting deficiencies and controls in various PPE Accounts 
 

Accounting deficiencies and controls in various Property, Plant and Equipment 
(PPE) accounts due to the failure of the concerned agency officials to implement the 
controls required under existing issuances to facilitate the reconciliation and 
validation of said accounts were noted. 

 
1. The accuracy and reliability of the reported year-end balances of various Plant, 

Property and Equipment (PPE) accounts aggregating to P41,118,598.96 could 
not be fully ascertained in view of the lack of regular/periodic reconciliation of 
records of the Accounting Section and the Property Section which resulted in 
unreconciled difference of P5,989,799.84 between the General Ledger balances 
and the  Report on the Physical Count  of PPE (RCPPE).  

 
1.1 Section 42, Chapter 10 of the Government Accounting Manual for National 

Government Agencies (GAM for NGAs), Volume 1 provides in part that the Chief 
Accountant shall maintain PPE Ledger Card (PPELC) for each category of PPE. The 
PPELC shall be kept to record promptly the acquisition, description, custody, 
estimated life, depreciation, impairment, issue/transfer/disposal, repair history and 
other information about the property. For check and balance, the Property Section 
shall likewise maintain Property Card (PC) for PPE in their custody account for the 
receipt and disposition of the same. The balance per PC shall be reconciled with 
PPELC maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit. They shall also be reconciled 
with other property record. 
 

1.2 Verification and analysis of the General Ledger balances of various PPE accounts 
and the RPCPPE submitted by the Property Section disclosed the following year-end 
balances with a net unreconciled difference of P5,989,799.84:

1.3 Our interview of concerned CAB personnel revealed that the primary reason/cause 

of the unreconciled difference was the lack of regular/periodic reconciliation of 
records between the Accounting and Property Sections. It was observed that the 
PPELCs maintained by the Accounting Section which served as the subsidiary 
ledgers of PPE accounts did not reconcile with the amount per type of PPE as 
reflected in the RPCPPE while the PCs which were used as basis in the conduct of 
Physical Count were not updated by the Property Section.  
 

1.4 Further review of the automated copies of the PPELC, we noted that it bears lump 
sum amount with notation: “Temporary subsidiary to balance with FS” and “To be 
reconciled”.  There were also discrepancies in recording and classification of the 
accounts such as the window blinds costing P182,000.00 were classified as Semi-
expendable Inventory by the Accounting Section but the Property Section recorded 
them as Furniture and Fixtures. Samples of noted discrepancies are shown in Table 
No. 2:

1.5 The Accountant commented that they are having difficulty to harmonize the PPE 

items in their e-NGAS subsidiary ledger with that of the RPCPPE due to the 
frequency in the change of Property Number assigned to each PPE item and lack of 
manpower in the Accounting Section to conduct the same. He further commented 
that some discrepancies can no longer be traced and corrected due to lack of 
accounting records maintained by the former Accountant, particularly the PPE 
acquired prior to CY 2018 represented by the lump sum amount in the PPELC. 
  

1.6 It bears to emphasize that the issue on the unreconciled difference between the 
Accounting and Property records was already raised in prior years’ audit, but no steps 
were yet taken to address aforesaid lapses in accounting controls which rendered the 
year-end balances of various PPE accounts doubtful.  

 
1.7 It is also worthy to mention that COA Circular No. 2020-006 dated January 31, 2020 

prescribes the guidelines and procedures in the conduct of physical count of PPE, 
recognition of PPE items found at the station, and disposition of non-existing/missing 
PPE items, for the one-time cleansing of PPE account balances of government 
agencies to establish PPE balances that are verifiable as to existence, condition and 
accountability. 

 
1.8 This is to address the existence of enormous amounts of discrepancies in the PPE 

account balance of government agencies which has become a perennial issue and 
caused the non-establishment of the accuracy of PPE balances presented in the 
financial statements.  

 
1.9 We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accounting and 

Property Sections to: 
 

a) Comply with the guidelines and procedures prescribed under COA 
Circular No. 2020-006 for the one-time clearing of PPE account balances to 
establish the accuracy of the PPE balances in the financial statements of the 
CAB; and  

 
b) Henceforth, after the one-time clearing, strictly follow the proper 

accounting and reporting procedures for all acquisition, receipt, issue, 
transfer and disposal of PPEs and the conduct of regular/periodic 
reconciliation of the accounting and property records pursuant to Chapter 
10 of GAM for NGAs and other relevant laws, rules and regulations.

B. COMPLIANCE AUDIT 
 

Utilization of Budget/Allotments and Cash Allocations 
 
2. Of the CAB’s total allotments received amounting to P134,991,009.00 in CY 

2020, P134,100,897.00 or 99.34 percent thereof was obligated, leaving an 
unobligated balance of P890,112.00 as at year end. Disbursement rate based on 
obligations was at 96.17 percent or amounted to P128,958,427.57. Moreover, 
CAB utilized P126,872,714.80 or 99.93 percent of the total NCAs received of 
P126,959,801.00 with only P87,086.20 reverted to the unappropriated Surplus 
of the General Fund pursuant to DBM Circular Letter No. 2019-3 dated 
January 4, 2019. 

 
i. Utilization of Budget/Allotments 

 
2.1 Section 70 of the General Provisions of RA No. 11465 or the General Appropriations 

Act (GAA) for FY 2020 states that, “As a general rule, departments, bureaus and 
offices of the National Government, including Constitutional Offices enjoying fiscal 
autonomy and SUCs shall spend what is programmed in their respective 
appropriations in this Act.” 
 

2.2 Related thereto, Section 3.4 of the National Budget Circular (NBC) No. 578 dated 
January 6, 2020 provides that, “With the adoption of the Cash Budgeting System 
(CBS) and consistent with Section 60, GPs of the FY 2020 GAA, all appropriations 
authorized under the FY 2020 GAA, including budgetary support to GOCCs and 
SAGF, shall be available for release and disbursement for the purpose specified, and 
under the same General Special Provisions of said GAA applicable thereto until 
December 31, 2020.” 
  

2.3 Further, Section 1 of the RA No. 11464 states that Section 65 of the FY 2019 GAA 
or RA No. 11260 is hereby amended as follows: Availability of Appropriations – All 
appropriations authorized in this Act shall be available for release and obligation for 
the purpose specified, and under the same special provisions applicable thereto, until 
December 31, 2020. 

 
2.4 Review of the CAB’s  4th Quarter Financial Accountability Report (FAR) No. 1 

showed that out of the total appropriations of P154,991,009,00, the amount of   
P134,991,009.00 was received  as allotments wherein P134,100,897.00 was obligated 
and P890,112.00 remained unobligated as of year-end. Details are summarized in 
Table No. 3:

2.5 Shown differently, the pie chart below viewed the graphical representation of the 

CAB’s utilization of its allotments and disbursements based on obligations incurred 
in CY 2020. 

 

 
2.6 It can be gleaned from Table No. 3 that the total allotments received for the current 

year of P132,694,009.00 is lesser by P20,000,000.00 when compared with the 
approved appropriations of P152,694,009.00. The difference accounts for the 
unreleased funds which were used to fund operations and response measures related 
to the COVID-19 emergency situation pursuant to NBC No. 580 dated April 22, 
2020.

2.7 Meanwhile, our inquiry with Management disclosed that the unobligated allotments 
of P890,112.00 as of December 31, 2020 is largely attributed to savings in various 
MOOE items such as unpursued travel and advertising transactions  due to the present 
pandemic situation.  Moreover, the full settlement of the power consumption during 
the construction of the building currently occupied by CAB located in a lot owned by 
MIAA also resulted in the drop of utility charges during the year. 
 

2.8 The unobligated allotments under RA No. 11465 were extended for use in CY 2021 
pursuant to Paragraph 3.6.2 of the NBC No. 583 dated January 4, 2021 consistent 
with RA No. 11520. 
 

2.9 Despite a high overall obligation rate of 99.34 percent and disbursement rate of 96.17 
percent, the CAB however did not fully attain the agency’s programs and targets for 
CY 2020. Review of the agency’s Physical Accomplishment Report as of December 
31, 2020 vis a vis Targets presents variances, as shown in Table No. 4:

2.10 Management commented that due to the closure of international as well as local 

borders caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the targeted increase in seat capacity 
and increase in number of operated routes of Carriers suffered an unprecedented 



40 
 

decrease or setback. Routes were suspended or terminated. In addition, the agency 
neither received new request nor confirmation of prior request for Air Agreement. 

 
ii. Utilization of NCAs 

 
2.11 Item No. 1 of DBM Circular Letter No. 2019-3 dated January 4, 2019 states that 

“To ensure the timely implementation of programs and projects, disbursement 
authorization documents are issued to make cash available within the scheduled 
program/activity/project implementation period as reflected in the corresponding 
DBM-evaluated Monthly Disbursement Programs (MDPs) submitted by 
agencies.” 

 
2.12 Moreover, Item Nos. 2.1, 2.2.3 and 2.3 of DBM Circular Letter No. 2019-3 provide 

the following policies and procedures to be observed beginning the first quarter of 
CY 2019, as follows: 

 
“2.1 All NCA releases for Regular MDS Sub-Accounts, to be credited for 
any month, whether part of the comprehensive releases or constituting 
additional NCA releases, shall continue to be valid until the last working 
day of the 3rd month of the quarter covered. xxx 
 
2.2.3 The MDS-GSB shall automatically credit any unutilized NCA 
corresponding to the book balance at the end of the month, to the 
immediately succeeding month within the same quarter. 
 
2.3 It is understood that all NCA balances of regular MDS-Accounts at 
the end of each quarter are considered lapsed after the last working hour 
of said quarter.” 

 
2.13 Review of the NCAs received by CAB during CY 2020 disclosed that of the total 

cash allocations received of P126,959,801.00, the amount of P126,872,714.80 or 
99.93 percent thereof was utilized leaving a balance of P87,086.20 which was 
automatically reverted to the unappropriated Surplus of the General Fund.  
Breakdown is shown in Table No. 5:

2.14 It can be noted in Table No. 5 that the CAB satisfactorily utilized its NCAs at 99.93 
percent for CY 2020. 
 

2.15 Management commented that part of their strategy to attain their target is the 
utilization of information technology to bolster the issuance of permits through 
electronic filing of applications, online submission of reportorial requirements of 
stakeholders, and improvement of existing IT infrastructures. Further, they are 
continuously streamlining their current systems and procedures to improve the 
service delivery and accountability. 
 

2.16 Management also pointed out that there are still circumstances beyond their control 
particularly the rising cases of COVID-19 that further restricts comfortable air travel. 
This also negatively affected the confidence of the riding public to travel by air 
impacting the financial capacity of airlines and the market they cater, hence, limiting 
the interest of airlines to increase and expand their operations to other routes. These 
uncontrollable factors negatively affected their targets in CY 2020. Further, they 
granted the request of some airlines to convert passenger operations into cargo flights 
to transport medical supplies. 
 

2.17 Nevertheless, Management avowed that efforts will be intensified to achieve their 
programs and targets. 

 

2.18 We commended Management for the satisfactory utilization of its allotments 
and NCAs for FY 2020. Moving forward, we recommended and Management 
agreed to consider other approaches, ways and strategies to ensure the optimum 
utilization of the CAB’s allotments and NCAs thru adequate planning and 
monitoring of the Agency’s programs and projects and the timely execution of 
all planned activities despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. 

 
 
Unauthorized grant of medical allowance 
 

3. The grant of Medical Allowance to CAB Officers and Employees for CY 2020 
amounting P2,407,500.00 has no legal basis, thus, considered unauthorized and 
irregular under Section 3.1  of COA Circular No. 2012-003  dated October 29, 
2012. 

 

3.1 Section 3.1 of COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012 provides that 
“The term irregular expenditure signifies expenditure incurred without adhering to 
established rules, regulations, procedural guidelines, policies, principles or 
practices that have gained recognition in laws. Irregular expenditures are incurred 
if funds are disbursed without conforming with prescribed usages and rules of 
discipline.  There is no observance of an established pattern, course, and mode of 
action, behavior, or conduct in the incurrence of an irregular expenditure. A 
transaction conducted in a manner that deviates or departs from, or which does not 

https://lia.coa.gov.ph/documents/16603?search_param=medical+allowance#sdfootnote23sym


42 
 

comply with standards set is deemed irregular. A transaction which fails to follow or 
violates appropriate rules of procedure is, likewise, irregular.” 
 

3.2 Section 6 of RA No. 11466 or the Salary Standardization Law (SSL) of 2019 provides 
that the Total Compensation Framework established under Item (4) of Joint 
Resolution No. 4, series of 2009, consisting of the following components, shall 
continue to be adopted: (a) Basic Salaries including Step Increments; (b) Standard 
Allowances and Benefits; (c) Specific-Purpose Allowances and Benefits; and (d) 
Incentive. 

 
3.3 Items 4 (f), (g), (h) of the Senate and House of Representatives Joint Resolution       

No. 4 dated June 17, 2009 enumerates the standard bonuses, allowances, benefits, 
and incentives given to all employees across agencies at prescribed rates, guidelines, 
rules and regulations. 

 

3.4 Our audit of the disbursement vouchers (DVs) together with the supporting 
documents disclosed that during CY 2020, the CAB paid Medical Allowance to its 
permanent, casual employees and Job Order personnel totaling P2,407,500.00 with 
details shown in Table No. 6.

employees for P10,000.00 
each 

Total 2,407,500.00  
 

3.5 Query from Management and verification of documents revealed that the basis in the 
grant of Medical Allowance was the Collective Negotiation Agreement (CNA) 
between the CAB and the Civil Aeronautics Board Employees Association (CABEA) 
which states that “management shall continue to provide the CAB employees free 
annual medical and dental assistance that will be subject to availability of funds in 
absence of any legal impediment”.   
 

3.6 The payment of Medical Allowance is irregular as there is no law authorizing its grant 
unless Management secures authority from the Congress as the same was not among 
those allowances allowed under Section 6 of RA No. 11466 and the Total 
Compensation Framework embodied in the Senate and House of Representatives 
Joint Resolution No. 4, s.2019.  
 



43 
 

3.7 Management commented that there is nothing irregular in the grant of medical 
allowance to CAB employees.  They adhered to established rules and is well within 
the bounds of law, referring to the provisions of the Civil Service Commission (CSC) 
Memorandum Circular 10, s.2020, as amended, authorizing government agencies to 
provide financial assistance during the COVID-19 pandemic. They further claimed 
that under Section 4(F) on Support Mechanisms, other monetary and forms of 
incentives may be allowed by the Office of the President or other authorized agencies 
or upon the approval of the heads of agencies, subject to accounting and auditing 
rules and regulations.    
 

3.8 Management averred that same provision was reiterated as part of the Support 
Mechanisms under the amendatory CSC issuance - Memorandum Circular No. 18, 
s.2020. Allegedly, the two CSC Memorandum Circulars were issued to bolster the 
government’s aim to equip its employees the capability to contend, cope and to an 
extent manage the impact of the pandemic.  

 
3.9 Management contended that the SSL framed in 2019 is the law providing the general 

structure and schedule of regular compensation of all government employees during 
ordinary times. The same could not have contemplated extraordinary circumstances 
such as the one facing our plight at the moment. These difficult times have prompted 
adaptive responses to the pandemic to fend the impact and effects without sacrificing 
excellence and mitigating health and safety risk.  

 
3.10 Management found bases on the amended Inter-Agency Task Force on the 

Management of Emerging and Infectious Diseases (IATF) Omnibus Guidelines on 
the Implementation of the Community Quarantine in the Philippines;  RA No. 11494, 
also known as the “Bayanihan to Recover as One Act” or “Bayanihan 2”, wherein 
the CSC urged government agencies to revisit and apply civil service policies that 
support the response and recovery measures to State of Public Health mandated by 
the said law; and the umbrella proclamation on the Declaration of the Emergency in 
the Philippines, Proclamation 922, to capacitate government agencies and LGUs to 
immediately act to prevent loss of life, utilize appropriate resources to implement 
urgent and critical measures to contain or prevent the spread of COVID-19, mitigate 
its effects and impact to the community, and prevent serious disruption of the 
functioning of the government and the community. Prior to this, there was the DOH-
CSC-DOLE Joint Memorandum Circular No. 1, s. 2020, that required all government 
agencies to develop and implement an Occupational Safety and Health program to 
protect government employees from the dangers of injury, sickness, or death in the 
workplace, which includes the grant of medical assistance and other benefits for 
employees. 
 

3.11 Management commented further that considering the hardships endured and the 
strain on the finances of their employees caused by the pandemic, the urgency and 
need for the medical allowance be treated as a compelling and justifiable measure. 
They find the CSC Memorandum as sufficient basis for the grant of the medical 



44 
 

allowance though it is clearly not covered by the total compensation framework 
because of its nature, extent and intent. 

 
3.12 The Audit Team maintains its position that the grant of medical allowance totaling to 

P2,407,500.00 or P25,000 to each CAB officer and employee was not within the 
purview of RA No. 11466 or the SSL of 2019 specifically Section 6 on 
Compensation, which reiterated that the Total Compensation Framework under Item 
(4) of the House of Representatives and Senate of the Philippines Joint Resolution 
No. 4, series of 2009 shall continue to be adopted. Any payment of benefits beyond 
the scope of RA No. 11466 should be with the prior approval of the President. Absent 
such approval, the payment of the medical allowance to CAB officers and personnel 
is therefore unauthorized and irregular under Section 3.1  of COA Circular No. 2012-
003 dated October 29, 2012. 

 

3.13 Section 4(F) on Support Mechanisms under CSC Memorandum Circular 10, s.2020 
is not absolute and must be exercised in harmony with other laws. 
 

3.14  We recommended for all CAB Officials and personnel to refund the amount 
paid for Medical Allowance and stop the grant thereof.  

 
 
Lapses in internal control procedures in collections 
 

4. Lapses in internal control procedures in collections of revenues were noted such 
as incomplete information, notations and devoid of signatures of the assessing 
officer in the Assessment Forms and Orders of Payment that support the Official 
Receipts, thus, impacted the propriety and correctness of the amount of 
revenues collected.  
 

4.1 Section 123 of Presidential Decree (PD) 1445 dated June 11, 1978 states that it is the 
direct responsibility of the agency head to install, implement, and monitor a sound 
system of internal control. 

 

4.2 Internal control is defined as the plan of organization and all the coordinate methods 
and measures adopted within an organization or agency to safeguard its assets, check 
the accuracy and reliability of its accounting data, and encourage adherence to 
prescribed managerial policies. 

 

4.3 Section 68(1) of PD 1445 states that “No payment of any nature shall be received by 
a collecting officer without immediately issuing an official receipt in 
acknowledgement thereof. The receipt may be in the form of postage, internal revenue 
or documentary stamps and the like, officially numbered receipts, subject to proper 
custody, accountability, and audit.” 

 

4.4 Revenue collections in CAB include fees for original application, renewal or 
extension of permit for the conduct of air commerce, surcharges and penalties. The 

https://lia.coa.gov.ph/documents/16603?search_param=medical+allowance#sdfootnote23sym


45 
 

collection process starts with the submission of application forms and required 
documents for authentication and assessment of fees. The Assessment Form (AF) 
contains the name of the stakeholder, nature of fees and charges, and the amount that 
is based on the CAB’s Schedule of Fees and Charges which should be properly filled 
out and reviewed by two finance analysts. The finance analysts shall notate their full 
name and signature as assessor and reviewer for accountability. The properly filled 
out and signed AF is the basis in the preparation of an Order of Payment (OP) by the 
Financial and Management Division. 
 

4.5 The OP shows the nature of collection and the total amount of fees or charges. The 
AF and OP is submitted to the Cashier as the bases of the amount to be collected from 
the applicant.  

 
4.6 In our review of the collection process of CAB, we noted the following deficiencies 

in the processing of the AF for assessment of application fees and such other gaps in 
the controls for the conduct of air commerce and cash collections: 
 

Table No. 7:  Gaps in Revenue Collections 
Deficiencies/Gaps Noted Prescribed Controls 

Assessment Forms (AF)  
a. In several instances, the name and 

signature of the assessing officer are not 
indicated. 

CAB Memorandum dated March 9, 2020 
directing all financial analysts and non-
plantilla officers to meticulously and 
conscientiously supply correct and complete 
data required in the assessment form. 
 

b There is no proof of review and evaluation 
by an authorized analyst. 

Collections 
d. There were 10 Official Receipts (ORs) 

that were not supported with duly 
accomplished AFs. In one instance, the 
amount collected differed by P50.00 from 
the amount deposited. 

The AF and OP are submitted to the Cashier as 
the bases of amount to be collected from the 
applicant and thereafter, stamped as paid and 
an OR is issued once the fees or charges are 
collected. 

e Acknowledgment Receipt was issued in 
lieu of an OR for the cash bond posted by 
a supplier. The collection was likewise 
not recorded in the books of the Agency 
and not deposited to the account of the 
Bureau of the Treasury. 

Section 68(1) of PD No. 1445 requires the 
immediate issuance of an OR in 
acknowledgment of payment of any nature. 
 

f Two Disbursing Officers were 
performing disbursing and collecting 
functions. 

Sound Internal Control Procedures prescribe 
the non-overlapping of collection and 
disbursement duties. 

 

4.7 The cases in point are suggestive of lapses in the collection of revenues and non-
compliance with bonding policies which could result in loss of government resources 
in case of shortage, theft or malversation of public funds and non-indemnity thereof. 
 

4.8 It is worth mentioning that in prior year’s audit, the issues on the improper 
accomplishment of AFs for assessment of application for the conduct of air 



46 
 

commerce were already brought to the attention of the management. In response 
thereto, the Management issued CAB Memorandum dated March 9, 2020 directing 
all financial analysts and non-plantilla officers to meticulously and conscientiously 
supply correct and complete data required in the Assessment Form like their full 
name and signature. 

 

4.9 As of audit date, similar observation remains despite the issuance of the 
memorandum instituting more stringent controls. The undue disregard of the 
memorandum’s directive to all financial analysts and non-plantilla officers to 
meticulously and conscientiously supply correct and complete data required in the 
assessment form like their full name and signatures exposes the agency to the risk of 
incorrect and unauthorized assessment. 

 

4.10 Management commented that the deficiencies noted in the AFs and OPs were due to 
the voluminous transactions. Notwithstanding, the FMD will ensure that effective 
internal controls are properly observed with preferential attention in reconciling the 
actual collections vis-a-vis the issued official receipts after each business day.  

 

4.11 We recommended and Management agreed to ensure that:  
 

a) All collections are supported with properly accomplished and duly signed  
AFs and OPs; and all concerned comply strictly with CAB Memorandum 
dated March 9, 2020 directing all financial analysts and non-plantilla 
officers to meticulously and conscientiously supply the correct and complete 
data required in the assessment forms; and 

 

b) Collections should be collected by a duly designated collecting officer or 
cashier and, issued with ORs in acknowledgement. 

 
 
Unimplemented prior years’ audit recommendation on flying pay 
 
5. The CAB was not able to implement the prior years’ audit recommendations on 

the observations noted on flying pay, as follows: a) non-withholding of income 
tax on payments of flying pay; and b) disbursement on payment of flying pay 
without an approved appropriation. 
 

5.1 Our monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of prior years’ audit 
recommendations disclosed that the CAB was unable to implement the two 
recommendations relative to the audit observations on flying pay with details shown 
in Table No. 8.

Non-withholding of income tax 
amounting to P2,322,055.21, on 
payments of flying pay to CAB 
officials and employees in violation of 
Revenue Regulation (RR) No. 11-2018 
dated January 31, 2018 and Revenue 
Memorandum Order (RMO) No. 23-
2014 dated June 20, 2014.  

Management to require all the officials 
and employees to pay the withholding 
tax which were not deducted from their 
flying pays received for the period 
January 1 to October 31, 2019. 
 

AAR CY 
2018 Obs. 

No. 5 

Disbursement for the payment of flying 
pay amounting to P8,377,615.00 were 
made without an approved 
appropriation contrary to Section 29, 
Article VI of the Philippine 
Constitution and Section 72(b) (ii) of 
the General Provisions of RA No. 
10964 or the FY 2018 GAA which 
requires that modifications from one 
allotment class to another should be 
approved by the Department of Budget 
and Management (DBM). 

Management to request for the approval 
of additional fund modification from 
the DBM to cover the full amount 
already paid to its officials and 
employees to avoid incurring 
unauthorized amount of disbursement. 

 

a) Non-withholding of income tax amounting to P2,322,055.21 on payments of flying 
pay to CAB officials and employees in CY 2019 
 

5.2 In CY 2019, the flying pay of 73 CAB officers and employees amounting to 
P9,328,436.00 were not subjected to income tax in violation of Revenue Regulation 
No. 11-2018 dated January 31, 2018 and Revenue Memorandum Order No. 23-2014 
dated June 20, 2014, which requires the withholding of taxes from compensation and   
mandates government agencies as withholding agents. This deprived the government 
of additional income in the amount of P2,322,055.21 excluding 25 percent surcharge, 
12 percent interest per annum, and compromise penalty. 
 

5.3 Our verification of the financial records of CAB revealed that while taxes on 
payments of the Flying Pays were already withheld in CY 2020, as of December 31, 
2020, Management has not yet initiated the deduction of CY 2019 unpaid income 
taxes from the officials’ and employees’ salaries or from their Flying Pays thus, 
continuously depriving the government of revenue from taxes necessary in the 
implementation of its priority programs and projects. 

 
5.4 Management expressed its intention to settle the said tax liability, however, the 

improbability and difficulty of deducting it from the compensation of employees at 
present would be too burdensome and callous given the financial difficulties brought 
by the pandemic. Hence, they commented that unpaid taxes in flying pay will be 
settled once DBM releases the remaining budget for flying pay incurred for the rest 
of CY 2020.  



48 
 

b) Flying Pay disbursed without an approved appropriation in CY 2018 
 

5.5 Article VI, Section 29 of the 1987 Philippine Constitution prescribes that no money 
shall be paid by the Treasury except in pursuance of an approved appropriation made 
by law. Further, Section 72 (b) (ii) of the General Provisions of RA No. 10964 or the 
FY 2018 GAA requires that modifications from one allotment class to another should 
be approved by the DBM. 
 

5.6 In CY 2018, the CAB disbursed a total of P9,909,615.00 for the payment of Flying 
Pay to its officials and employees. In the FY 2018 GAA, the CAB has an approved 
appropriation for Flying Pay in the amount of P1,532,000.00 only, therefore, the 
amount of P8,377,615.00 was disbursed without an approved appropriation, in 
violation of the above-stated regulations. 
 

5.7 Since October 10, 2018, the CAB has not obtained the approval of modification from 
the DBM. However, Management made written representation and persistently 
requested from the DBM authority to use the current year’s excess allotments for 
flying pay to fund the CY 2018 disbursements. 
 

5.8 We reiterated our prior years’ recommendations for Management to: 
 

a) Deduct from the salaries of officials and employees their tax liabilities in 
relation to their flying pays for the period January 1 to October 31, 2019 
and immediately remit the same to the Bureau of Internal Revenue to avoid 
incurrence of higher surcharges, penalties and interests; and 

 

b) Make representation with the DBM regarding the request for fund 
modification or ratification on the flying pay already paid to its officials and 
employees to avoid disallowance due to unauthorized payments of flying 
pay. 

 
5.9 Management commented that on April 13, 2021, it sent a follow-up letter to DBM 

requesting for the release of the remaining allotment of their flying pay in CY 2019 
and the request for fund modification from MOOE to PS for CY 2018. 

 

 
Delayed submission of financial and budgetary documents and purchase orders (POs) 

 

6. Delays ranging from 16 to 267 days were noted in the submission of financial 
statements, budgetary and financial accountability reports, POs, other related 
reports/records and supporting documents to the Audit Team, which prevented 
the timely conduct of audit and review of financial accounts and transactions. 
 
 



49 
 

a) Non-submission of financial and budgetary reports and documents within the 
prescribed timeline 

6.1 Section 122 of PD No. 1445 states that, “Whenever deemed necessary in the 
exigencies of the service, the Commission may under regulations issued by it require 
the agency heads, chief accountants, budget officers, cashiers, disbursing officers, 
administrative or personnel officers and other responsible officials of the various 
agencies to submit trial balances, physical inventory reports, current plantilla of 
personnel, and such other reports as may be necessary for the exercise of its 
functions. Failure on the part of the officials concerned to submit the documents and 
reports mentioned herein shall automatically cause the suspension of payment of 
their salaries until they shall have complied with the requirements of the 
Commission.” 
 

6.2 Further, Section 7.1 of the 2009 Rules and Regulations on the Settlement of Accounts 
provides the Responsibility of the Agency Head which reads in part, “The head of 
the agency, who is primarily responsible for all government funds and property 
pertaining to his agency, shall ensure that the required financial and other reports 
and statements are submitted by the concerned agency officials in such form and 
within the period prescribed by the Commission.” 

 

6.3 COA promulgated the GAM for NGAs which, among others, requires the submission 
of documents and financial reports to COA within a prescribed timeline to enable the 
timely conduct of post audit of transactions and periodic/ annual evaluation on the 
assertions relating to transactions and account balances reflected in the books. 

 
6.4 Verification of records on the CAB’s submission of financial and budgetary reports 

and related records and documents to the Audit Team disclosed delays ranging from 
16 to 267 days or more than eight months, as presented below.

6.6 Verification disclosed that during CY 2020, CAB Management was also unable to 
submit POs and their supporting documents within the five days reglementary period 
reckoned from the date of the execution of the contract, as shown in Table No. 10.

6.7 The delayed submission of the aforementioned reports, POs and their supporting 
documents affected the timely review of the financial transactions and assessment of 
the Budget and Cash Utilization of the CAB.  
 

6.8 Management commented that delays noted were due to lack of personnel complement 
and the pandemic situation which led to imposition of skeleton workforce.  
 

6.9 We recommended and Management agreed to comply with the prescribed 
period of submission of financial, budgetary reports and POs together with 
complete and relevant supporting documents for the timely review and 
evaluation thereof by the Audit Team. 
 

 
Non-compliance with RA No. 9184 and its Implementing Rules and Regulation 
 
7. The CAB was not fully compliant with RA No. 9184 and its Revised 

Implementing Rules and Regulations (RIRR) in its implementation of the 
procurement process as shown in the deficiencies noted in the review of 
contracts and purchase orders.  

 

7.1 RA No. 9184 otherwise known as the Government Procurement Reform Act and its 
RIRR was enacted to ensure that all procurement of the National Government, its 
departments, bureaus, offices and agencies shall be governed by the principles of 



52 
 

transparency in the procurement process and implementation, employs 
competitiveness, streamlined, and follows a simple and modern-technology 
adaptable procurement process that will uniformly apply to all government 
procurement. Moreover, the Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB) issued 
Manual of Procedures for different modes of procurement to provide detailed 
guidelines to government agencies in the conduct of procurement activities.  
 

7.2 Table No. 11 shows the deficiencies/lapses observed in the review of awarded 
procurement contracts and purchase orders.

 Rate of performance 
security in the form of

upon demand reflected 
in the Notice of Award 
is five percent instead of 
30 percent. 
 

 Performance security in

7.3 Non-compliance with pertinent provisions of RA No. 9184 had defeated the purpose 
of the law on transparency, competitiveness and accountability and may place the 
agency and its officers to possible risk of protest/complaint or charges that may be 
filed by the losing bidders. 
 

7.4 The Management commented that they conducted due diligence in checking whether 
the bidders are included in the GPPB list of blacklisted contactors/suppliers and found 
that the bidders are not included in the list, thus, deemed to have the legal capacity as 
required. Henceforth, the Post Qualification report shall indicate in particular the 
conduct of the specific conducted and the documents examined.  

 

7.5 On the correctness of performance security bond, Management commented that the 
error was inadvertent. The table provided in the Notice of Award was for Bid 
Security. Thus, the bidder posted performance security in the form of Surety Bond 
corresponding to five percent of the contract price as indicated in the Notice of 
Award. They notified the bidder of the error and to rectify, the bidder changed the 
form of the performance security from a Surety Bond into a cash bond amounting 
P90,000.00, which is the equivalent of five percent of the contact price.

7.6 Furthermore, Management explained that they inadvertently failed to attach the 
PhilGEPs Registration/Certificate, Income/Business Tax Return, Omnibus Sworn 
Statement of the suppliers and the BAC Resolution recommending award of the POs. 
Management submitted the aforementioned lacking documents on February 22, 2021. 

 
7.7 We recommended and Management agreed to strictly observe pertinent 

provisions of the RIRR of RA No. 9184 and properly and comprehensively 
document every step of the procurement process.  

 

Compliance with Other Rules and Regulations 
 
8. In monitoring the CAB’s compliance with laws, rules and regulations, the Audit 

Team noted the following:  
 

Laws, Rules and Regulations  Audit Observations and Recommendations 
Gender and Development (GAD) 

Section 32 of the General Provisions of the GAA FY 
2020, provides: “All agencies of the government shall 
formulate a GAD Plan designed to address gender 
issues within their concerned sectors or mandate and 
implement applicable provisions under RA No. 9710 
or the Magna Carta of Women, Convention on the 
Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against 
Women, the Beijing Platform for Action, the 
Philippine Plan for Gender-Responsive Development 
(1995-2025), and the Philippine Development Plan 
(2017-2022).” 
 

 
PCW Memorandum Circular No. 2020-03 requires 
that all national government agencies and 
instrumentalities are enjoined to review and revise, as 
necessary, their FY 2020 GAD Plan and Budget 
(GPB) to implement measures to address gender 
issues and concerns arising from the unequal status of 
their women and men stakeholders due to the COVID-
19 situation. Such measures should be in line with 
their respective agency mandates, Republic Act No. 
9710 or the Magna Carta of Women and the 
Bayanihan to Heal As One Act. Xxx. 
 

The FY 2020 GAD Plans and Budget was not 
revised pursuant to the Philippine Commission 
on Women (PCW) Memorandum Circular No. 
2020-003 thus, the CAB was not able to consider 
implementing measures to address gender 
issues and concerns arising from the unequal 
status of their women and men stakeholders due 
to the COVID-19 situation.  Moreover, the CAB 
implemented only one of the eight activities in 
its GAD Plan, thereby resulting in the non-
utilization of the allocated amount of 
P67,995,140.00 or 48.18 percent of its CY 2020 
budget of P141,123,000.00.  
 
The PCW issued Memorandum Circular No.   
2020-03 dated April 27, 2020 which provided 
guidance on the revision and/or implementation of 
the FY 2020 GPB to implement the GAD program, 
projects and activities that address gender issues 
and concerns related to the COVID-19 situation. 
 
Our review and verification of  the GAD Plan, 
Budget and Accomplishment reports disclosed that 
CAB did not revise its FY 2020 GPB pursuant to 
PCW Memorandum Circular No. 2020-03 thus, 
failed  to implement measures to address gender 
issues and concerns arising from the unequal status 
of their women and men stakeholders due to the 
COVID-19 situation. 
 
Further in our review, it was noted that CAB had 
allocated P67,995,140.00 or 48.18% of the 
agency’s total budget of P141,123,000 for eight 
GAD programs/projects for CY 2020. Of the eight 



55 
 

Laws, Rules and Regulations  Audit Observations and Recommendations 
GAD activities, only one was implemented at no 
cost. 
 
Management explained that the outbreak of 
COVID-19 pandemic resulted in limited 
workforce and ultimately reduced the 
opportunities of the CAB GFPS-TWG to conduct 
brainstorming on the implementation of programs 
especially on mainstreaming wherein HGDG and 
gender analyses were needed.  
 

Management also asserted that GAD projects and 
programs prior to the COVID-19 outbreak were 
not prioritized because the Agency refocused on 
emergency support and measures on how to 
mitigate the effects of the pandemic. Further, 
Management also said that they intended to re-
establish the CAB Gender Development Plan with 
revisions and adjustments to address the present 
challenges of COVID-19 pandemic. 
 
The Audit Team is cognizant of the challenges 
posed by the COVID 19 pandemic. Nonetheless, it 
pointed out that the implementation of the GAD 
activities is a function mandated by law which 
should be carried out with utmost significance just 
like other mandated functions of the agency. 

 
The Audit Team also noted in the review of 
Management’s implementation of prior year’s 
audit recommendations that the CAB has not yet 
established a GAD sex-disaggregated data (SDD) 
system as required under PCW Memorandum 
Circular No. 2014-05 and has not applied the 
Harmonized Gender and Development Guidelines 
(HGDG) in the attribution of its main activities 
which is the Passenger Rights Action Desk.  
 
Management commented that GAD plans and 
projects were not prioritized due to the effects of 
the pandemic. Budget was refocused on 
emergency support and measures. Adding to it was 
the limited workforce. 
 
Management further commented that the SDD was 
not yet fully established but they will enhance their 
capability building, including their stakeholders. 
Data from stakeholders will be collected to address 
gender issues and formulate policies concerning 
COVID-19. They will train technical personnel to 
develop and maintain a SDD system. 
 
We recommended and Management agreed to 
comply with the PCW guidelines in 



56 
 

Laws, Rules and Regulations  Audit Observations and Recommendations 
implementing measures to address gender 
issues and concerns arising from the unequal 
status of women and men stakeholders specially 
in this time of  pandemic situation; and 

  
We also reiterated our previous year’s 
recommendation for Management to establish a 
GAD sex-disaggregated data system as required 
under PCW Memorandum Circular No. 2014-
05 and to attribute the expenditure of major 
agency program/project applying   the HGDG. 
 

Compliance with RA No. 11465 or the GAA for FY 2020-Programs and Projects Related to Senior (SC) 

Citizens and Persons with Disability (PWD) 
Section 32 of the General Provisions of GAA for FY 
2020 requires all agencies of the government to 
formulate plans, programs and projects intended to 
address the concerns of SCs and PWDs, insofar as it 
relates to their mandated functions, and integrate the 
same in their regular activities, and directs that 
government infrastructure and facilities provides 
architectural or structural features, designs or facilities 
that will reasonably enhance the mobility, safety and 
welfare of persons with disability pursuant to BP Blg. 
344 and RA No. 7277, as amended. 
 

Of the seven programs/activities/projects 
formulated by the CAB to address the concerns 
of SCs and PWDs, only one activity was 
implemented due to the health risks posed by 
the COVID-19 pandemic in the country, hence, 
the agency was not fully compliant with Section 
32 of the General Provisions of the GAA for FY 
2020. 
 
Per Department of Transportation (DOTr) Special 
Order No. 2015-460 dated October 28, 2015, CAB 
was designated as one of the members of the 
Department’s task force on accessibility with 
function to prepare plans, programs and funding 
requirements for the implementation of B.P. 344 
and R.A. 7277 in the transportation sector. 
 
The CAB allotted P660,000.00 or 0.47 percent of 
the agency’s total budget of P141,123,000.00 for 
seven major SC and PWD related target activities. 
Out of the seven programs and activities, only one 
was implemented at no cost. 
 
Management explained that the implementation of 
programs and activities to address the concerns of 
senior citizens and persons with disability have 
been postponed and suspended due to health risks 
of COVID 19 and restrictions on airports during 
the pandemic.  
 
It is worthy to mention that in the CY 2019 audit 
of the CAB, the following were noted: 
 
(a) unmeasurable performance indicators and 

targets for SC and PWD programs, projects 
and activities; and  

(b) non-coordination with airport authorities, 
(Luzon International Premiere Airport 
Development Corporation and Civil Aviation 
Authority of the Philippines) for the 



57 
 

Laws, Rules and Regulations  Audit Observations and Recommendations 
implementation of the planned program and 
activities. 

 
Validation of the Agency’s implementation of 
prior year’s audit recommendation showed that 
performance indicators and targets are still not 
quantifiable and coordination with airport 
authorities for the planned projects and activities 
were not accomplished. Management explained 
that it is due to the challenges of the current 
COVID-19 pandemic that the CAB focal persons 
on SC and PWD were unable to do the necessary 
coordination with concerned airport authorities. 
 
The Management commented that the CAB-Task 
Force on Accessibility planned to revise its 
projects and programs and resort to virtual 
seminars due to the effect of pandemic but was not 
realized because actual and on-site presentation is 
necessary for the workshop and audit. 
Nevertheless, the Management commented that 
they will endeavor to achieve the 
recommendations. 
 
We recommended and Management agreed to 
consider other approaches and strategies to  
implement programs and activities that are 
responsive to the needs of SCs and PWDs  amid  
the COVID-19 pandemic situation in the 
country. 
 
We also reiterated our previous year’s 
recommendations for Management to: 

 
a) Incorporate performance indicators and 

targets which are quantifiable, specific and 
measurable in the plan of programs and 
activities for SCs and PWDs; and 
 

b) Coordinate with airport authorities to get 
their full cooperation and participation 
towards full implementation of its planned 
activities. 

 
Compliance with RA No. 8291 or the GSIS Act of 1997 and its IRR 
Section 6 states that the employer shall report to the 
GSIS the names of all its employees, their 
corresponding employment status, positions, salaries 
and such other pertinent information, including 
subsequent changes therein, if any, as may be required 
by the GSIS; the employer shall deduct each month 
from the monthly salary or compensation of each 
employee the contribution payable by him in 

Management had substantially complied with 
the schedule on the remittance of premiums and 
loan repayments from salaries of its of 
employees prescribed under Section 6 and 14, 
Rule III of the Implementing Rules of RA No. 
8291, the GSIS Act of 1997 except for the two 
days delayed remittance of amount withheld in 
December 2020.   
 



58 
 

Laws, Rules and Regulations  Audit Observations and Recommendations 
accordance with the schedule prescribed in the rules 
and regulations implementing this Act. 
 
Section 14.2 states that the government agency shall 
also deduct from the fixed monthly compensation of 
the employee the loan amortizations (consolidated 
loans, policy loan, emergency loan, housing loan, and 
other loans), premium payments (optional, pre-need 
and other non-life insurance) and other amounts due 
the GSIS. 
 
Further, section 14.3 states that the said amounts shall 
be remitted to the GSIS within the first ten (10) days 
of the calendar month following the month when the 
deductions were effected, accompanied by supporting 
lists in the form prescribed by the GSIS. 

Verification showed that during CY 2020, 
Management was able to remit to GSIS the 
premiums and loan repayments within the first ten 
days of the calendar month following the month in 
which the contributions apply except for the 
months of April and May when the country was 
placed under an Enhanced Community Quarantine 
(ECQ). 
 
It was also noted that the December 2020 withheld 
contribution was remitted on January 12, 2021 or 
two days delayed from the prescribed period thus, 
incurring penalty. 
 
In addition, verification of the remitted amount of 
P368,659.44 on January 12, 2021 pertaining to the 
amount withheld in December 2020 and 
unremitted collections in prior period was still 
deficient by P61,610.27 to cover the reported 
balance at year end of  P430,269.71.  This is due to 
the absence of a monitoring control mechanism to 
check the propriety or accuracy of the amount 
withheld and remitted. 
 
The Management commented that control is in 
place such as maintenance of manual accounting 
system to serve as counter checking. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon completion 
of FMD’s complement, they will prioritize 
reinstituting the review and approval procedure in 
the preparation and posting of journal entries to 
avoid accounting errors and develop the 
monitoring control mechanism to check the 
propriety or accuracy of the amount withheld and 
remitted. 
 
Furthermore, the delay was due to limited 
workforce as a result of Community Quarantines 
imposed by the government to curb the pandemic.  
 
The Management also commented that P60,304.79 
of the 2019 and prior years’ balances remain 
outstanding as of December 31, 2020. 
Nevertheless, they are in the process of evaluating 
whether there are unrecorded liabilities prior to 
2020.  
 
We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 
a) Institute a control mechanism to mitigate 

incurrence of delay of remittance of 
contributions deducted from the salaries 
and wages of CAB officers and employees; 
and 



59 
 

Laws, Rules and Regulations  Audit Observations and Recommendations 
b) Remit to the GSIS the CY 2020 and prior 

year unremitted contributions and loan 
repayments and henceforth, comply 
strictly with the prescribed timelines by 
the collecting agency. 

 
Compliance with RA No. 10963 or The Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion (TRAIN Act) and 

its Implementing Rules and Regulations 
Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 11-2018 dated January 
31, 2018 constituted all employers of 
government/private offices as withholding agents for 
purposes of the creditable tax required to be withheld 
on income payments from compensation, contractors, 
suppliers of goods and other services. As withholding 
agents, they are primarily liable for the payment of the 
taxes to the National Treasury thru the Bureau of 
Internal Revenue (BIR). 

 
Section 4-114-2 of RR No. 13-2018 dated March 15, 
2018 provides that the Government or any of its 
political subdivisions, instrumentalities or agencies, 
including government-owned-or-controlled 
corporations (GOCCs) shall, before making payment 
on account of each purchase of goods and services 
which are subject to the value-added tax imposed in 
Sections 106 and 108 of this Code (NIRC as amended 
by Train Law), deduct and withhold a final value-
added tax at the rate of five percent (5%) of the gross 
payment thereof. 
 
RR No. 1-2013 dated January 23, 2013 provides that 
the filing of returns and payment of taxes shall be 
made thru the electronic filing and payment system 
(eFPS) on or before the 10th day following the month 
in which withholding was made, except for quarterly 
report, which shall be filed on or before the end of the 
month following the close of every taxable quarter as 
provided under BIR Tax Advisory dated April 25, 
2018. 
 

CAB Management had substantially complied 
with the withholding and remittance of taxes 
during CY 2020 except for the non-
implementation of prior year audit 
recommendation on the withholding/remittance 
of taxes for Flying Pay for the period January 
to October 2019 as discussed in paragraph 5.2 
to 5.4 of this report. 
 
During CY 2020, the CAB withheld the amount of 
P7,116,112.27 from the salaries of employees and 
payment to suppliers, in addition to prior year  
unremitted  balance of P791,703.37, and remitted 
the amount of P7,268,631.79 thereby, leaving an 
unremitted amount of P639,183.85 which was 
remitted on January 7, 2021.  

Compliance with RA No. 10606 amending Act No. 7875, otherwise known as the National Health 

Insurance Act of 1995 

Section 18, Rule III of the Implementing Rules of RA 
No. 10606 requires that the member’s monthly 
contribution shall be deducted and withheld 
automatically by the employer from the former’s 
salary, wage or earnings. The premium contributed 
shall be divided equally between the employer and the 
employed. The employer’s counterpart shall not, in 
any manner be charged to the employee. The monthly

amount of P885,159.83 was remitted inclusive of 
the P11,985.54 which pertains to CY 2019 
unremitted contributions. Thus, the balance of the 
account as at year end was P160,424.50 
comprising of unremitted contributions in CY 
2020 and prior years amounting to P148,778.43 
and P11,646.07, respectively. 
 
Further audit of the account and examination of 
Check No. 90663316 dated October 14, 2020 
revealed that the Statement of Premium 
Contribution No. SPA100021841946 applicable 
for the month of May was paid on June 25, 2020 or 
10 days delayed from the prescribed period. 
Management commented that the delay was due to 
limited workforce as a result of the Community 
Quarantines imposed by the government to curb 
the pandemic. Still, they fully commit to submit to 
the recommendation to comply strictly with the 
payment schedule. 
 
We recommended and Management agreed to 
strictly comply with the payment schedule 
provided under Philhealth Circular No. 0001 
dated January 9, 2014 to avoid incurrence of 
unnecessary interests or surcharges. Moreover, 
we reiterated the recommendation to remit the 
unremitted prior years’ outstanding balance. 
 

Compliance with RA No. 7742 amending PD No. 1752, otherwise known as the Home Development 

Mutual Fund Law of 1980 
Section 5, Rule VI of the Implementing Rules of RA 
No. 7742, amending PD No. 1752 or the HDMF Law 
of 1980 requires all employers to remit to the Fund 
their contributions as well as the contributions of their 
covered employees including those employees who, in 
proper instances, voluntarily join the Fund within 15 
days from the date the contributions were collected 
unless another period is previously agreed upon 
between the employer and the Fund. 
 
Refusal or failure to collect and remit the required 
contribution or the correct amount due shall subject 
the employer to penalty of three (3%) percent per 
month of the amounts payable computed from the date 
the contributions fall due and until the same is paid in 
addition to the penalty imposed under Section 1 of 
Rule XIII. 
 
 

The year-end balance of the Due to Pag-IBIG 
account in the amount of P8,376.87 as of 
December 31, 2020 was not remitted within the 
prescribed period. 
 

1. Audit disclosed that during the year, the 
Accountant withheld P1,877,953.26 from the 
salaries of its officers and employees for their 
personal shares of Pag-IBIG contributions. Of this 
amount, P1,869,576.39 was remitted, thereby 
leaving an unremitted balance of P8,376.87 as at 
year-end. 

2.  
3. Further audit also disclosed that the audited 

balance totaling P8,376.87 as of December 31, 
2020 remained unremitted as of January 31, 2021 
which is not in keeping with the due date of 10th to 
14th day of the month following the period covered 
as prescribed by item 4, paragraph E of the HDMF 
Circular No. 275 dated January 22, 2010.

Laws, Rules and Regulations  Audit Observations and Recommendations 
5. Query from the Chief Accountant and 

Administrative Officer disclosed that delays were 
committed due to lack of personnel to prepare and 
review payrolls, as well as the recording of 
transactions in the general ledger. 
 
Moreover, Accountant commented that the 
P8,376.87 pertains to prior year’s outstanding 
balances which remains unremitted due to the  on-
going evaluation of  prior year’s transaction.  

6.  
We recommended and Management agreed to 
provide additional manpower in the Accounting 
Section to assist in the processing of payrolls 
and to ensure timely remittance of Pag-IBIG 
contributions of employees. Moreover, we 
reiterate the recommendation to remit prior 
years’ outstanding balance. 
 

Compliance with RA No. 656 otherwise known as the Property Insurance Law 
RA No. 656 otherwise known as the “Property 
Insurance Law”, as amended, established the Property 
Insurance Fund and requires every government, 
except municipal government below first class to 
insure its properties with the Fund against any 
insurable risk.   
 
Executive Order (EO) No. 33 was issued directing all 
heads of government agencies and their subsidiaries to 
secure from the General Insurance Fund directly, all 
insurances or bonds covering properties, contracts, 
rights of action and other insurable risks and all those 
in which they have an insurable interest only. 
 
COA Circular No. 2018-002 dated May 31, 2018 
requires all heads of government agencies to direct the 
pertinent official under his/her supervision to submit 
the consolidated PIF to the Supervising Auditor/Audit 
Team Leader and the GIF, GSIS, not later than April 
30 of each year. 

Other Properties totaling P33,908,538.34 were 
not adequately insured with the GSIS General 
Insurance Fund (GIF), thus, the agency may not 
be indemnified in case of loss due to fortuitous 
events.  Moreover, Management failed to 
submit to the Audit Team the Property 
Inventory Form (PIF) showing the list of all 
insurable properties of the Agency in violation 
of Section 5.1.e of COA Circular No. 2018-002. 
 
All motor vehicles were adequately covered 
against all risk or subjected to a comprehensive 
insurance policy. Nonetheless, other insurable 
properties amounting to P33,908,538.34 were only 
protected against damage or loss from Fire and 
Lightning but without insurance coverage against 
flood, full earthquake, typhoon, riot, strike, 
malicious damage and extended coverage against 
other risks hence, inadequately insured.  
 
It is worthy to emphasize that the absence of an 
adequate property insurance coverage poses risk to 
the government of non-indemnity in case of 
damage to said properties.    
 
Verification also disclosed that Management did 
not furnish the Audit Team with the PIF for CY 
2020 in violation of COA Circular No. 2018-002 
dated May 31, 2018, thus, precluded the validation 
of the correctness of the insured properties. 
 
 
 
 



62 
 

Laws, Rules and Regulations  Audit Observations and Recommendations 
We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 
a) Ensure that all properties of CAB are 

adequately insured against all risks 
including allied perils; and  

 
b) Require the Property/Supply Section to 

regularly submit the PIF to the Office of the 
Auditor not later than April 30 of each 
year.
