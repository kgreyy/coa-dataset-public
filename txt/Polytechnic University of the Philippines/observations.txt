PART II – OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

 

FINANCIAL AUDIT 

 

Uncorrected Misstatements in the Financial Statements (FSs) 

 

1. Cash and Cash Equivalents account balance as of December 31, 2020 is 
misstated in the amount of ₱3,935,623.22 resulting from errors and  omissions, 

thus the accuracy, occurrence, cut-off, and existence of the said account and 

other affected accounts could not be relied upon. 

 

1.1. Section 27 of IPSAS 1 states that “the Financial Statements shall present 
fairly the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of an 

entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of 

transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with the definitions 

and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out 

in IPSAS.” 

 

1.2. Section 6, Chapter 21 of the Government Accounting Manual for National 
Government Agencies (GAM for NGAs), Volume I states that: 

 

Recognition of Adjustments.  The Chief Accountant/Designated 

Staff shall prepare a Journal Entry Voucher (JEV) to recognize all 

reconciling items that require adjustment and correction in the 

books of accounts. 
 

1.3. Analysis of the PUP‘s CY 2020 FSs, disclosed misstatement of 
₱3,935,623.22 in Cash and Cash Equivalents account balance, particularly 

the Cash in Bank - Local Currency, Current Account (CIB-LCCA) as of 

December 31, 2020 resulting from errors and omissions, thus the accuracy, 

occurrence, cut-off, and existence of the said account could not be relied 

upon, as shown below:

1.4. The concept of materiality is applied in evaluating the effect of identified 
misstatement or omission in the FSs.  The total misstatements affecting 

Cash and Cash Equivalent account which were not adjusted in the books of 

PUP during the audit period amounted to ₱3,935,623.22; thus a qualified 

opinion was rendered on the fairness of the presentation of the FSs for CY 

2020.  

 

1.5. The Cash and Cash Equivalents of the University amounting to

a. Unrecorded book reconciling items in two Payroll , Revolving and Regular Trust 
Funds 

 

1.8. The book reconciling items such as unrecorded deposits, credit memos, and 
book errors which are already identified in the BRS in the net amount of 

₱385,583.64 were not recorded as of December 31, 2020.  The recognition of 

adjustments upon preparation of monthly BRS was not effected on a timely 

manner, contrary to Section 6, Chapter 21 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, 

thereby, adversely affecting the fair presentation of CIB-LCCA.  The details 

are shown in the following table:

1.9. Further, credit memos and unrecorded deposits aggregating ₱10,297,817.13 
were not receipted by the Fund Management Office (FMO).  The Audit Team 



65 

 

has always noted errors on the validated amounts of Advice to Debit Account 

(ADAs) and their ending balances as reported in the monthly Reports of Cash 

Disbursements and submitted to the Office of the Auditor by the same office.  

These errors resulted in various credit memos which remain unadjusted in the 

books of accounts particularly in the Payroll Scholarship Fund. 

 

1.10. Moreover, debit memos totalling ₱10,099,118.58, mostly in payroll accounts, 
could not be validated without the corresponding ADAs, thus remain 

unrecorded in the books of accounts.  Other debit memos are online payment 

transactions to government corporations such as GSIS, PhilHealth and Pag-

IBIG but without Reports of Cash Disbursements, and/or unsubmitted to the 

Audit Team. 

 

1.11. Books errors of ₱3,674,366.01 remain unadjusted despite the cause of 
correction having already determined.  Prior periods‘ unreconciled amount of 

₱3,861,251.10 was due to accumulation of book reconciling items brought 

about by the non-preparation of BRSs from previous years beginning CY 

2012.   

 

1.12. In effect, the unrecorded book reconciling items amounting to ₱385,583.64 
understated the CIB-LCCA and Accumulated Surplus/ (Deficit) accounts. 

 

b. Unreconciled difference between book and bank balances in STF 
 

1.13. In the STF or Fund 164, comparison of balances per book amounting to 
₱1,413,811,109.04, and the confirmed bank balance amounting to 

₱1,417,841,749.16, revealed an unreconciled amount of ₱4,030,640.12.  The 

latest BRS submitted by the Accounting Office is as of November 30, 2020, 

while reconciliation between the book and bank balances was not yet done for 

the December 31, 2020 balances. 

 

c. Closed accounts of Jimmy Go Scholarship Fund 
 

1.14. On November 26, 2020, a JEV No. 2020-184-11-0113 was drawn with 
description of ―to reverse original entry of cash account of Jimmy Go in 

relation to AAR 2018 page 53.‖  Except for the subsidiary ledger (SL), no 

other supporting documents were attached to justify the adjustment such as 

request for write-off balances, bank reconciliations, bank statements or other 

accounting records prescribed by COA Circular No. 2015-001 dated January 

29, 2015. 

 

1.15. On March 4, 2021, the Audit Team sent a confirmation letter inquiry with the 
BDO Unibank, Inc. Timog – South Triangle Branch (formerly: Real Bank – 

Timog Branch).  On March 8, 2021, the bank replied that the accounts under 

Jimmy Go Scholarship were already closed. 

  



66 

 

1.16. However, without the necessary procedures that should have been undertaken 
by the University, and the necessary documentation thereof as prescribed by 

the said COA Circular, the closed account of Jimmy Go Scholarship cannot be 

adjusted. 

 

1.17. The Management provided an adjusting entry to reverse the JEV made on 
November 26, 2020 per JEV No. 2020-184-12-0411 dated December 31, 

2020. 

 

1.18. We recommended that the Management through: 
 

I. Accounting Office: 
 

a. prepare adjusting entries for unrecorded deposits, credit memos, 
debit memos, and book errors amounting to ₱194,831.60, 

₱10,102,985.53, ₱10,099,118.58 and ₱3,674,366.01, respectively, 

recognize immediately all reconciling items that require 

adjustments and correcting entries in the books upon 

preparation of monthly BRS to avoid the accumulation of 

unrecorded reconciling items, pursuant to Section 6, Chapter 21 

of the GAM for NGAs, Volume 1;  

 

b. review the validity of debit memos in two payroll accounts, 
check their corresponding ADAs, and adjust accordingly; 

 

c. analyze the unaccounted prior years’ book reconciling items of 
₱3,861,251.10, and accordingly prepare the necessary adjusting 

entry; and 

 

d. for the unreconciled difference amounting to ₱4,030,640.12 in 
Fund 164 (STF), prepare BRSs as of December 31, 2020 and 

take up in the books the reconciling items that require 

adjustments. 

 

II. Fund Management Office: 
 

e. prepare Official Receipts (ORs) for the deposits made in all CIB-
LCCA accounts as basis of recording of the Accounting Office; 

 

f. ensure the correctness of monthly Reports of Cash 
Disbursements in Payroll Scholarship Fund to avoid any 

unrecorded credit memos; 

 

g. prepare monthly Reports of Cash Disbursements for online 
payment transactions made in CIB-LCCA accounts, and submit 



67 

 

the reports to the Office of COA Auditor, copy furnished the 

Accounting Office; and 

 

h. Undertake the necessary procedures and prepare the necessary 
documentations prescribed by COA Circular No. 2015-001 dated 

January 29, 2015, related to the closed accounts of Jimmy Go 

Scholarship Fund. 

 

 

OTHER ACCOUNTING DEFICIENCIES 

 

Dormant and closed cash account 

 

2. The dormant cash account under the Jimmy Go Scholarship Fund maintained 
by the University and deposited in a non-authorized government depository 

bank amounting to ₱480,600.54 was not reverted to the General Fund due to 

non-adherence to procedures prescribed under COA Circular No. 2015-001 

dated January 29, 2015. 

 

2.1. COA Circular No. 2015-001 dated January 29, 2015 prescribing the 
guidelines and procedures in the Reversion to the General Fund of Dormant 

Cash, Unauthorized Accounts, Unnecessary Special and Trust Funds and 

Related Accounts in conformity with Permanent Committee Joint Circular 

No. 4-2012, dated September 11, 2012, implementing Executive Order No. 

431, dated May 30, 2015. 

 

2.2. In October 2000, A Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) was entered by and 
between Congressman Feliciano Belmonte, Jr. and the Polytechnic 

University of the Philippines.  The former offered to provide a Fund with an 

initial capital of ₱500,000.00 to extend financial assistance to deserving and 

qualified students of the latter in the form of scholarship, said fund to be 

named as the Jimmy Go Scholarship Fund, after the late Newspaper 

Publisher and Journalist. 

 

2.3. The Jimmy Go Scholarship Fund was deposited in the Real Bank, a non-
Authorized Government Depository Bank.  The recorded cash balance 

amounting to ₱480,600.54 has been dormant for more than 10 years.  Since 

then, it has become a perennial audit findings included in the Annual Audit 

Reports beginning Calendar Year (CY) 2008 and thereafter. 

 

2.4. On June 5, 2018, the Fund Management Office submitted to the Audit Team 
the documents pertaining thereto such as passbooks, unused checks, and 

Report of Checks Issued (RCI) pursuant to the audit recommendation of the 

former Audit Team. However, the concerned office did not undertake the 

necessary procedures enumerated in the COA Circular No. 2015-001 dated 

January 29, 2015, as follows:

69 

 

2.5. Nevertheless, based on the initial evaluation of submitted documents, the 
following observations were found: 

 

a. The Jimmy Go Scholarship Fund was composed of four accounts with  
the Real Bank, one was already closed while one was dormant.  Only

was not recorded at the amount of ₱16,757.26.  On May 12, 2008, the 

balance under the Savings Account No. 124-20-000004-3 was closed 

and transferred to the other savings account under the same account

2.6. Moreover, the Audit Team had been persistently sending bank 
confirmations to Real Bank for CYs 2015 - 2020 but replies were either 

―moved out‖ or no return mail at all.  It was learned that the Real Bank was 

acquired by the BDO in 2014; hence, the unconfirmed bank accounts.  The 

news article pertaining thereto can be retrieved from 

https://www.bdo.com.ph/news-and-articles/bdo-acquire-banking-business-

real-bank, which states that: 

 

BDO Unibank, Inc. (BDO) has entered into an agreement with The 

Real Bank (A Thrift Bank), Inc. (―Real Bank‖) for the acquisition 

by BDO of all its recorded assets and assumption of all recorded 

liabilities. Real Bank has a deposit base of ₱7.2Billion and 24 

branches operating in Metro Manila and Luzon (underlined 

scoring)‖

2.7. Regardless of BDO‘s acquisition of Real Bank, the latter‘s deposits 
liabilities for its depositors were assumed by the former.  Thus, the accounts 

of the University maintained in the Real Bank were assumed by the BDO.  

In the location where the Real Bank was previously situated, a BDO Branch 

can be seen in existence.  Provided below is the captured photograph of the 

former Real Bank Timog Branch (now a BDO Timog – South Triangle 

Branch).  In an interview of BDO bank officer, it was confirmed that the 

said BDO Branch was previously the Real Bank Branch. 

 

Figure 1: BDO Timog – South Triangle Branch 

(formerly: Real Bank Timog Branch) 

 
 

2.8. On March 4, 2021, the Audit Team sent a confirmation letter inquiry with 
the BDO Unibank, Inc. Timog – South Triangle Branch (formerly: Real 

Bank – Timog Branch).  On March 8, 2021, the bank replied that the 

accounts under Jimmy Go Scholarship were already closed. 

 

2.9. However, the Audit Team cannot perform further evaluation and auditorial 
review of Jimmy Go Scholarship Fund.  The initial evaluation was 

insufficient to substantiate the existence of Jimmy Go Scholarship Fund 

without the procedures undertaken by the University as enumerated in the 

COA Circular No. 2015-001 dated January 29, 2015.  For the same reason, 

the said dormant account amounting to ₱480,600.54 cannot be reverted to 

the General Fund. 

 

2.10. We recommended and the Management, through the Fund 
Management Office, agreed to undertake necessary procedures 

indicated in Section 3.2 of COA Circular No. 2015-001 dated January 

29, 2015, and submit the result thereof to the Audit Team for 

verification and evaluation.

Accounting deficiencies in Accounts Receivable account 

 

3. The balance of the Accounts Receivable account as of December 31, 2020 with 
net realizable value of ₱5,955,681.55 is unreliable due to the: a) undetermined 

exclusion of balances amounting ₱53,254.84 in CY 2020 Aging Report;  

b) unverified differences in the CY 2020 and 2019 balances amounting to 

₱599,654.19 due to unavailability of the SL; and c) Accounts Receivable 

amounting to ₱15,882,905.52 representing unpaid balances of PUP 

concessionaires remained unsettled/uncollected for more than three years 

which deprived the PUP of the benefits and revenue that should have been 

derived and utilized in their operations.  

 

3.1. Chapter 3, of the GAM for NGAs, Volume III defines the Accounts 
Receivable as follows: 

 

Accounts Receivable-This account is used to recognize the amount 

due from customers arising from regular trade and business 

transactions. Credit this account upon collection of receivables, 

transfers or write-off. 

 

3.2. Section 10, Chapter 10, of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I on the Impairment 
of Financial Assets, specifically provides that:  

 

An entity shall assess at the end of each reporting period whether 

there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or group of 

financial assets is impaired.  If any such evidence exists, the entity 

shall measure the amount of loss as the difference between the 

carrying amount of the asset and the present value of estimated 

future cash flows discounted at the financial asset‘s original 

effective interest rate.  The carrying amount of the asset shall be 

reduced either directly or through use of an allowance account.  

The amount of the loss shall be recognized in surplus or deficit.   

 

In case of Accounts Receivable, the Allowance for Impairment 

shall be provided in an amount based on collectability of 

receivable balances and evaluation of such factors as aging of 

accounts, collection experiences of the agency, expected loss 

experiences and identified doubtful accounts 

 

3.3. As of December 31, 2020, the Accounts Receivable account, composed of 
collectibles for the payment of space rental/lease, electricity, and water from 

concessionaires and for tuition fees and other school fees from students, was 

reported to have a net realizable value of ₱5,955,681.55, broken down on 

the next page.

3.5. Review of aging of accounts receivable revealed that balances aggregating 
₱667,948.52 which are previously reported in CY 2019, were excluded in 

the CY 2020 aging report, due to full payment of concessionaires and/or 

valid adjustments while ₱53,254.84 cannot be determined due to absence of 

Subsidiary Ledgers, as detailed below:

3.7. Furthermore, out of 96 active and operating concessionaires at the start of 
CY 2020, only 40 concessionaires‘ contracts were submitted and validated.  

Later on, majority of the concessionaires were forced to stop their 

operations and close their businesses in the first quarter of year 2020 due to 

the Pandemic.  The balances of the closed concessionaires should have been 

settled, however, the situation made it more difficult to collect because they 

were no longer occupying the space in the University.  According to the 

Resource Generation Office, Demand Letters were already sent to these 

former concessionaires requiring them to settle their outstanding balances.  

Nonetheless, the Accounting Office even exhausted the warranty deposits of 

the concessionaires; however, there are still balances which remained 

unpaid. 

 

3.8. We recommended that Management through the: 
 

I. Accounting Office 
 

a. submit to the Audit Team the SL for each concessionaire listed 
in paragraph 3.6; and 

 

b. determine the cause of the exclusions of five concessionaires in 
the 2020 CY Aging Report. 

  



75 

 

II. Resource Generation Office 
 

c. identify the status of all the concessionaires with unpaid balances 
and provide the Audit Team with a Status List of 

Concessionaires;  

 

d. provide to the Audit Team a copy of the contracts for other 
concessionaires which are not yet submitted; and 

 

e. exert all efforts to collect overdue accounts receivable, and 
withhold warranty deposits before issuing clearances to 

concessionaires whose contracts have already lapsed. 

 

 

Accounting deficiencies in Advances to Special Disbursing Officer account 

 

4. Non-observance of the existing rules and regulations, and lapses in the 
monitoring on the grant, utilization, and liquidation of Advances to Special 

Disbursing Officer (SDO) account balance of ₱3,960,872.80 as of December 31, 

2020, resulted in: a) discrepancy of ₱185.84 between the General Ledger (GL) 

and the Subsidiary Ledger (SL) balances; b) several liquidation entries in the 

SL amounting to ₱56,889.69 without corresponding cash advances recorded 

therein; c) cash advances granted in CYs 2018 to 2020 amounting to 

₱3,810,882.18 remain unliquidated as of December 31, 2020; and d) additional 

cash advances were granted to two accountable officers (AOs) despite previous 

CA’s unliquidated balances; contrary to the pertinent provisions of 

Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445, and COA Circular No. 97-002 dated 

February 10, 1997. 

 

4.1. Section 4 of the PD No. 1445, otherwise known as the Government 
Auditing Code of the Philippines, prescribes the fundamental principles that 

shall govern the financial transactions and operations of any government 

agency, to wit: 

 

xxx 

 

6. Claims against government funds shall be supported with 

complete documentation.  

 

4.2. Section 89 of P.D. No. 1445 states the rule regarding the limitations on cash 
advance, to wit: 

 

Section 89. Limitations on cash advance. No cash advance shall 

be given unless for a legally authorized specific purpose. A cash 

advance shall be reported on and liquidated as soon as the purpose 

for which it was given has been served. No additional cash 



76 

 

advance shall be allowed to any official or employee unless the 

previous cash advance given to him is first settled or a proper 

accounting thereof is made. 

 

4.3. Further, COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 prescribes the 
rules and regulations on the granting, utilization and liquidation of cash 

advances. Section 4 of the same states the general guidelines on the grant 

and utilization of cash advances, to wit: 

 

4.1 General Guidelines 

 

xxx 

 

4.1.2 No additional cash advances shall be allowed to any official 

or employee unless the previous cash advance given to him is first 

settled or a proper accounting thereof is made.  

 

4.1.3 A cash advance shall be reported on as soon as the purpose 

for which it was given has been served.  

 

xxx 

 

4.4. Further, Section 5 of COA Circular No. 97-002 states the following with 
regard to liquidation of cash advances, to wit: 

 

xxx 

 

5.7 When a cash advance is no longer needed or has not been used 

for a period of two (2) months, it must be returned to or refunded 

immediately to the collecting officer.  

 

5.8 All cash advances shall be fully liquidated at the end of each 

year. Except for petty cash fund, the AO shall refund any 

unexpended balance to the Cashier/Collecting Officer who will 

issue the necessary OR.  

 

5.9 At the start of an ensuing year, a new cash advance may be 

granted, provided that a list of expenses against the previous cash 

advance is submitted. However, when no liquidation of the 

previous cash advance is received on or before January 20, the 

Accountant shall cause the withholding of the AO's salary.

amount of ₱56,889.69 do not have any corresponding cash advances 

recorded in the SL of each of the AO, which cast doubt on the reliability of 

the Advances SDO Account. Details are as follows:

4.10. Furthermore, Analysis of the Schedule of Cash Advances as of December 
31, 2020 revealed that the Accounting Department does not conform to the 

rule that “No additional cash advances shall be allowed to any official or 

employee unless the previous cash advance given to him is first settled or a 

proper accounting thereof is made.” Two personnel, one has two 

outstanding cash advances while the other has three outstanding cash 



80 

 

advances, were granted subsequent cash advances even when the previous 

cash advance given remain unsettled.  Details are as follows:

Total 1,568,000.00 

 

4.11. We recommended that Management, through the Accounting Office: 
 

a. explain the said discrepancy between the GL and SL balance of the 
Advances to SDO account; 

 

b. submit justification on the posted liquidations unrelated to the Cash 
Advances granted to the AOs, and adjust the SLs, as warranted; 

 

c. issue demand letters to the AOs to liquidate their outstanding cash 
advances, otherwise, withhold their salaries in accordance with 

Sections 37 and 122 of P.D. No. 1445 and Section 5.9 of COA 

Circular No. 97-002; and 

 

d. henceforth, strictly follow the general guidelines on the grant, 
utilization and liquidation of cash advances under Section 89 of PD 

No. 1445 and COA Circular No. 97-002. 

 

 

Doubtful valuation and accuracy of the Land account 

 

5. The valuation and accuracy of the Land account costing ₱9,837,770.65 as of 
December 31, 2020 are unreliable due to: a) unrecorded two parcels of land in 

Mulanay Branch acquired through purchase; b) nine parcels of land of eight 

Branches/Campuses acquired through donations not measured at fair value 

determined through appraisal as prescribed under Section 6.2.12 of COA 

Circular No. 2020-006 dated January 31, 2020; and c) undocumented transfer 

of assets from San Juan Campus; thereby, affecting the fair presentation of the 

Land account in the Financial Statements. 

 

5.1. Section 7, Chapter 19, of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I states that the 
―Financial statements shall present fairly the financial position, financial 

performance and cash flows of an entity.  Fair presentation requires the 

faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and 



81 

 

conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for 

assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses set out in IPSAS.  The application of 

IPSASs, with additional disclosures when necessary, is presumed to result in 

financial statements that achieve a fair presentation (Par. 27, IPSAS 1).” 

 

5.2. Pertinent sections of Chapter 10 of the same manual states the following: 
 

a) Section 3. The cost of an item of PPE shall be recognized as assets if, 
and only if: 

 

a. it is probable that the future economic benefits or service potential 
associated with the item will flow to the entity; 

b. the cost or fair value of the item can be measured reliably; 
c. beneficial ownership and control clearly rest with the government; 
d. the asset is used to achieve government objectives; and  
e. it meets the capitalization threshold of ₱15,000. 

 

b) Section 8. PPE acquired through purchase are charged against 
appropriations/ allotments or special budget for capital outlay.  PPE can 

be purchased on cash basis, on account, on installment basis, with 

promotional items, and at a lump sum price. 

 

c) Section 11. PPE acquired through a non-exchange transaction, such as 
donation, presidential proclamation, taxes, transfers and grants, its cost 

shall be measured at its fair value as at the date of acquisition.  However, 

this does not constitute revaluation.  If the fair value cannot be 

determined, the asset shall be recorded at a nominal value (the value that 

is stated on currency or face value).  

 

d) Section 12. Cost of PPE acquired through donation without condition 
shall be taken up at its fair value at the date it is acquired.  All expenses 

incurred in connection with the donated asset, such as delivery and 

installation costs, shall be included in the amount recognized as asset.  

The fair value of the PPE shall be recognized as ―Income from Grants 

and Donations in Kind.‖ 

 
5.3. As of December 31, 2020, the Land account of the University is valued at 

total amount of ₱9,837,770.65 which represents the costs of parcels of land 

in 11 PUP Branches which are funded by the General Appropriations Act 

(GAA), as follows:

5.4. Audit of the Land account for CY 2020 disclosed the following deficiencies: 
 

a. Unrecorded two parcels of land in Mulanay Branch acquired through purchase 
 

5.5. The total cost of the land as disclosed above only consists of five parcels of 
land of ₱9,651,312.64 pertaining only to M.H. Del Pilar and Lepanto 

Campuses of Main Branch, Lopez and Unisan Branches in Quezon, and 

Ragay Branch in Camarines Sur, and an unaccounted beginning balance of 

₱186,458.01. 

 

5.6. Out of the 14 parcels of land, no amount was recorded for the nine

5.7. In Mulanay Branch, two parcels of land were purchased,  hence the 
purchase costs stated in the Deed of Sale should be recorded pursuant to 

Section 8, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAS, Volume I. 

 

b. Nine parcels of land of eight Branches/Campuses acquired through donations 
were not measured at fair value determined through appraisal 

 

5.8. The remaining parcels of land acquired through donations should be 
measured at fair value as at the date of acquisition pursuant to Sections 11 

and 12, Chapter 10, of the same Manual.  However, due to passage of time, 

the fair value of said land could not be determined reliably as of the date of 

acquisition.  Nonetheless, Section 6.2.12 of COA Circular No. 2020-006 

dated January 31, 2020 provides the procedures for the valuation of those 



84 

 

parcels of land and the fair value should be determined through appraisal.  

The procedures are as follows: 

 

In case no such information could be found in both Accounting and 

Property records such as for PPE items found at station, the unit 

cost/value shall be established, as follows: 

 

a. Cost/value may be assigned by the Inventory Committee based 
on the market/fair value of the item. The cost/value of a similar 

item in the RPCPPE may also be used by the Inventory 

Committee. 

 

The market/fair value is the estimated amount for which an 

asset could be exchanged on the date of valuation, between 

knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm's length transaction; 

and 

 

b. If there are items for which market/fair value could not be 
easily determined by the Inventory Committee, their fair value 

shall be determined by appraisal. (Underscoring supplied) 

 

An appraisal of the value of an asset is normally undertaken by 

a member of the valuation profession who holds a recognized 

and relevant professional qualification. For many assets, the fair 

value will be readily ascertainable by reference to quoted prices 

in an active and liquid market. For example, current market 

prices can be obtained for land, non-specialized buildings, 

motor vehicles, and many types of plant and equipment.  

(Underscoring supplied) 

 

5.9. On May 17, 2019, a contract was entered into between the PUP and Valdez 
Surveying and Realty Services for the land survey of various campuses 

Phase I (Mabini, NDC, Mulanay, Quezon, and Lopez, Quezon).  The 

appraisal was already completed and fully paid on March 2, 2020 as 

reported in the Quarterly Report on Government Projects, Programs and 

Activities as of March 31, 2020.  However, the appraisal report of the latter 

was not submitted to the Audit Team.  Thus, the Audit Team could not 

determine the appraised amount of those parcels of land of  aforementioned 

branches. 

 

c. Undocumented transfer of assets of San Juan Campus to PUP 
 

5.10. On the other hand, the 12 LGU-funded Campuses are being operated by 
virtue of MOA between the PUP and the LGU-counterparts.  Insofar as the 

assets of LGU-funded Campuses are concerned, the ownership remains with 

the LGU counterparts.  Clearly, the recognition criteria for the PUP to 



85 

 

capitalize all assets of LGU-funded Campuses, as stated in Section 3, 

Chapter 10 of the of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, were not met, thus the 

cost of such lands are excluded from the total cost of the recorded Land. 

Details are as follows:

5.11. However, the San Juan Campus was converted into a Branch of the 
University.  In fact, the GAA for Fiscal Year 2020 provides a budget for its 

operational requirements amounting to ₱5,000,000.00.  However, the 

transfer of the assets from the LGU of San Juan to the PUP has not been 

agreed by the two parties, and no documents pertaining thereto has been 

submitted to the Audit Team. 

 

5.12. We recommended that Management through: 
 

I. Committee on Land Title: 
 

a. complete the appraisal of remaining land in Quezon City, Taguig 
City, Maragondon, Cavite, Sto. Tomas, Batangas, Bansud, 

Oriental Mindoro and Mariveles, Bataan Branches; 

 

II. Accounting Office: 
 

b. maintain PPELC as prescribed by the Manual, account for the 
beginning balance of Land account amounting to ₱186,458.01, 

reconcile with the records of the Property and Supply 

Management Office (PSMO) and if proven to be non-



86 

 

existing/missing PPEs without available record of accountability, 

request from COA for authority to derecognize non-existing 

PPEs, in accordance with COA Circular No. 2020-006 dated 

January 31, 2020; and 
 

III. Property and Supplies Management Office: 
 

c. make representation with the LGU of San Juan for the transfer 
of assets and submit documents such as MOA, Deed of Donation 

or other relevant accounting records to the Audit Team. 

 

Unreconciled balance between book and lapsing schedule of PPE accounts 

 

6. The accuracy, reliability and existence of the Property, Plant and Equipment 
(PPE) reported at carrying amount ₱1,296,096,065.25 as of December 31, 2020 

are doubtful due to unreconciled balance between book and lapsing schedule 

of ₱841,270,709.82 due to exclusion of fully depreciated assets in the lapsing 

schedule of PPE; thereby affecting the fair presentation of PPE accounts in the 

Financial Statements contrary to Section 7, Chapter 19 of the GAM for NGAs, 

Volume 1.  

 

6.1. The PUP‘s PPE accounts had a total carrying value of ₱1,296,096,065.25 as 
of December 31, 2020 presented as follows:

6.2. Verification, validation and review of the above PPE categories disclosed 
lapses and deficiencies which were already noted in the previous years‘ 

audit reports, thus the same observations are reiterated and discussed in 

detail in the succeeding paragraphs. 

 

6.3. The Manual specifically requires the Accounting Office to maintain PPELC 
for all PPE categories.  However, the Accounting Office did not maintain 

the appropriate accounting records for the entire PPE items valued at 

₱2,415,963,128.86.  As an alternative, however, the Accounting Office 

maintains a Lapsing Schedule of PPE which contains specific accounting 

data regarding the PUP‘s depreciable assets. Included in the schedule are the 

original purchase cost, date and description of each asset, additions to the 

assets, accumulated depreciation, depreciation expense and estimated 

salvage value. 

 

6.4. Comparison between the costs recorded in the books and the lapsing 
schedule as of December 31, 2020 revealed a substantial discrepancy 

amounting to ₱841,420,293.82 due to exclusion of fully depreciated assets 

in the Lapsing Schedule of PPE, as summarized per fund cluster hereunder:

6.5. In view of the foregoing, the recurring unreconciled balances between the 
book and its accompanying accounting records, which as at yearend 

amounted to ₱841,420,293.82, materially affected the accuracy, reliability 

and existence of 64.92 percent of the carrying amount of PPE totaling 

₱1,296,096,065.25. 

 

6.6. We recommended that Management through the Accounting Office: 
 

a. submit to the Audit Team a List of all fully depreciated assets which 
were excluded in the lapsing schedule of PPE; and 

 

b. identify the remaining unreconciled balances of PPE accounts in the 
books; and submit proof of compliance therewith to the Audit 

Team. 

 

 

Completed infrastructure projects still in the Construction in Progress account and non-

accrual of unbilled but completed infrastructure projects 

  

7. The accuracy of the Construction in Progress (CIP) account with reported 
balance of ₱66,481,509.40 as of December 31, 2020 was doubtful due to non-

reclassification of completed projects costing ₱31,676,275.40 from the CIP to 

School Buildings account and non-accrual of unbilled but completed 

infrastructure projects estimated at ₱60,680,138.54, thus, affecting the fair 

presentation of respective accounts in the FS, contrary to the provisions of 

GAM for NGAs. 

 

7.1. Section 8 (g), Chapter 10 GAM for NGAs, Volume I provides that during 
the construction period, all expenses incurred in relation to the construction 

of the PPE shall be taken up in the books as Construction in Progress (CIP) 

with the appropriate asset classification. As soon as the construction is 

completed, the ―Construction in Progress‖ account shall be reclassified to 

the proper asset account. Likewise, all expenses such as interests, license 

fees, etc., during the construction period shall be capitalized. 

 

7.2. The Construction in Progress (CIP) account represents various Infrastructure 
Projects of the University funded by the General Appropriations Act (GAA) 

under Fund 101 and Specialt Trust Fund (STF) under Fund 164.  The 

beginning balance of the CIP account amounted to ₱202,450,458.09.  

During the year, the CIP account was increased by ₱75,931,021.63, and 

adjustments of ₱5,662,796.05.  As at December 31, 2020, the reported

7.4. Non-reclassification of completed projects costing ₱31,676,275.40 from the 
CIP to School Buildings resulted in non-allocation of cost over its useful life 

and understatement of depreciation. 

 

7.5. Although completed in 2019, three infrastructure projects were still subject 
for final billings by the contractors, hence the amount reflected in the books 

of account did not represent the total amount incurred for the constructed 

assets.  The total project costs provided by the Physical Planning and 

Development Office (PPDO) for these three infrastructure projects disclosed 

an amount of ₱92,356,413.94 while the recorded amount in the books of 

accounts amounted to ₱31,676,275.40, thus resulting in non-accrual of 

unbilled infrastructure projects estimated at ₱60,680,138.54, as shown in the

7.6. Due to non-accrual of unbilled infrastructure projects, the accuracy of the 
Construction in Progress account with reported balance of ₱66,481,509.40 

as of December 31, 2020 was doubtful. 

 

7.7. We recommended that Management provide administrative policies 
and measures for all infrastructures projects compliant with the 

pertinent rules and regulations under the GAM for NGAs and direct 

the concerned offices to implement the same. 

 

7.8. We also recommended and the Project Planning and Development 
Office agreed to coordinate with the contractors for the final billings of 

three completed infrastructure projects. 

 

 

Deficient Property Accounting System and inadequate PPE accounting and property 

records 

 

8. The annual physical inventory of PUP’s properties had not been effectively 
carried out by the Inventory Committee due to the absence of approved 

Physical Inventory Plan, and inappropriate accounting forms, valuation and 

reporting procedures inconsistent with the sound internal control principles of 

Property Accounting System as stated in the GAM for NGAs, Volume I and 

COA Circular No. 2020-006 dated January 31, 2020, thereby failing to 



92 

 

substantiate the existence of the reported balances of the PPE accounts with a 

reliable and complete Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and 

Equipment (RPCPPE). 

 

8.1. Section 43, Chapter 10 of the of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I provides for 
the Property Accounting System which consists of the following procedures:  

 

a. Recording of Receipt, Inspection and Acceptance of PPE   
b. Recording of Requisition and Issue of PPE   
c. Construction of PPE by administration 
d. Construction of PPE by contract 

 

8.2. The same provision provides that the physical count/inventory, which is 
required annually, is an indispensable procedure for checking the integrity 

of property custodianship. 

 

8.3. In relation to this, COA Circular No. 2020-006 dated January 31, 2020 
prescribes Guidelines and Procedures in the Conduct of Physical Count of 

Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE), Recognition of PPE Items Found at 

Station, and Disposition for Non-existing/Missing PPE Items, for the One-

Time Cleansing of PPE Account Balances of Government Agencies. 

 

8.4. Likewise, the Manual prescribes the following Accounting and Property 
Records to be maintained by the Accounting Office and Property Office 

specifically for PPE, as follows: 

 

a) Property Card (PC) (Appendix 70) – this card shall be used by the 
Supply and/or Property Division/Unit to record the description, 

acquisition, transfer, disposal, and other information about the PPE. 

It shall be kept for each class of PPE; 

 

b) Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment 
(RPCPPE) (Appendix 73) to be used to report the physical count 

and condition of PPE by type as at a given date, including those 

which are unrecorded and those which could not be accounted for.  

It shows the balance of PPE per property cards and per count and 

the shortage/overage, if any.  It shall be rendered by the Inventory 

Committee, on its yearly physical count of properties owned by the 

entity; 

 

c) Property, Plant and Equipment Ledger Card (PPELC) (Appendix 
71) – this card shall be used for each class of PPE to record the 

acquisition, description, custody, estimated life, depreciation, 

impairment, disposal, transfer/adjustment, repair history and other 

information about the property. It shall be kept and maintained by 

the Accounting Office/Unit. 



93 

 

 

8.5. Evaluation of the compliance of the PUP with the aforementioned 
provisions pertaining to the Property Accounting System disclosed several 

lapses and deficiencies discussed in the succeeding paragraphs. 

 

8.6. The inventory taking was carried out by the Inventory Committee which is 
composed of various representatives from the Property and Supplies 

Management Office (PSMO), Accounting Office and Internal Audit Office. 

 

8.7. Review of the process, and the reports submitted revealed that the 
Committee did not have an approved Physical Inventory Plan (PIP) which 

includes, among others the following: 

 

 specific assignments/duties of the Committee members,  

 the cut-off date 

 schedule specifying the dates and locations of the inventory taking 
activities from start up to the targeted completion of the physical 

inventory 

 flowcharts containing from planning, execution of actual physical count, 
and reporting thereof, as shown below: 

 

Table 28: Process Flow Chart of Inventory-taking 

INPUT PROCESS OUTPUT 

  

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

8.8. As a result, several lapses and weaknesses in the valuation and reporting of 
physical inventory-taking were noted, which are  inconsistent with Section 

38, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I and COA Circular No. 

2020-006 dated January 31, 2020, as summarized below: 

 

a. The RPCPPE was incomplete and covered only Machinery and 
Equipment, excluding other PPE items such as Buildings and Other 

Structures, Land and Other Land Improvements, Furniture, Fixtures and 

Books, Transportation Equipment and Other PPEs including Intangible 

Assets; 

 

b. All PPE items were not presented in a per PPE category or classification 
as provided in the Revised Chart of Accounts;

c. The column provided for the Quantity per Property Card and Unit Value 
not filled-out; shortage/overage, if any, could not be determined; 

 

d. The whereabouts of the some properties, as well as their actual condition 
were not disclosed in the ―Remarks‖ column, thus  lost, stolen, damaged 

or destroyed properties, if any, could not be ascertained;  

 

e. There was no grand summary submitted for all the inventory sheets 
which were prepared; and 

 

f. The Property Number and Property Stickers were not in accordance with 
the standard property numbering system and format prescribed by the 

same COA circular. 

 

8.9. Aside from Property Accounting System, another essential element of 
internal control over PPE is the adequate PPE accounting and property 

records, which is the most important control.  When an agency has more 

than one item of PPE, it is a must to keep a record of the details of each 

asset owned by the agency.  PPE accounting records enable proper control 

over such assets through the use of control accounts/SL technique and 

accurate accounting for PPE. 

 

8.10. In handling and recording the government properties, the GAM for NGAs 
specifically requires the preparation and maintenance of reports by the 

Property and Supply Management Office (PSMO) and Accounting Office.  

As discussed in detail in Section 42, Chapter 10 of the Manual, the 

following are the responsibilities of each office, alongside with overlapping 

responsibility as to the reconciliation of both records: 
 

Table 29: Responsibilities of Property Office and Accounting Office 

Responsibility of 

Accounting Office 
Overlapping Responsibility 

Responsibility of Property and 

Supply Management Office 

Maintenance of PPELC 

 shall maintain the 
PPELC for each 

category of PPE. 

Reconciliation of both records 

 For check and balance, the 
balance per PC shall be 

reconciled with PPELC 

maintained by the Accounting 

Division/Unit.  

 They shall also be reconciled 
with other property records 

like PAR. 

Maintenance of PC 

 shall maintain PC for PPE in 
their custody to account for 

the receipt and disposition of 

the same. 

 

8.11. It was observed, however, that the PCs maintained by the PSMO were not 
the prescribed PPE accounting records and covered only the Machinery and 

Equipment account.  Also, no PCs were kept and maintained for other PPE 

accounts such as Buildings and Other Structures, Land and Other Land 

Improvements, Furniture, Fixtures and Books, Transportation Equipment 



95 

 

and Other PPEs accounts because no property numbers were assigned to 

those aforementioned PPE accounts.  In lieu of the PCs for other PPE items, 

the PSMO provided the Audit Team with an inventory listing of the 

Buildings and Other Structures and Transportation Equipment (vehicle).  

However, maintenance of updated and prescribed PCs per PPE category is 

still required. 

 

8.12. Moreover, the Accounting Office did not maintain the required PPELC.  As 
an alternative, the Accounting Office maintains Lapsing Schedule of PPE 

which contains pertinent accounting data regarding the PPE items. However, 

several information required by the GAM for NGAs, Volume I for a PPELC 

were not contained in the said Lapsing Schedule, such as information on the 

Issuance/ Transfer and Adjustments and the adjusted cost, among others. 

 

8.13. Thus, the reconciliation between two PPE accounting records could not be 
done due to the absence of PCs by the PSMO and PPELCs by the 

Accounting Office.  The concerned offices should start with the 

maintenance of the required PCs and PPELCs in order to arrive at a 

reconciled property records with that of the accounting records.  All 

accounting records pertaining to PPE accounts are necessary if the 

University would request for ―Authority to Derecognize Non-existing PPEs‖ 

to COA.  

 

8.14. In view of the foregoing, it must be emphasized that the compliance with the 
Property Accounting System is imperative for the accuracy of the financial 

information provided by these records and reconciliation thereof is vital to 

the fair presentation of the PPE items in the Financial Statements.  

 

8.15. We recommended that Management through: 
 

I. Property and Supplies Management Office: 
 

a. use and maintain the Property Card for all PPE properties 
including the intangible assets and CIP as prescribed by the 

Manual and provide an explanation for non-maintenance 

thereof, within a reasonable period of two months from receipt 

hereof;  

 

b. adopt the Property Number System and prepare Property 
Stickers using the format prescribed by the COA Circular No. 

2020-006 dated January 31, 2020 within a reasonable period of 

two months from receipt hereof;  

 

  



96 

 

II. Accounting Office: 
 

c. use the financial data in the Lapsing Schedule of PPE to prepare 
and maintain the PPELC prescribed under the manual and 

provide an explanation for non-maintenance thereof within a 

reasonable period of two months from receipt hereof; 

 

d. prepare, together with the PSMO and the Inventory Committee,  
a reconciliation of inventory count per RPCPPE with property 

and accounting records and if proven that some PPE items are 

non-existing/missing PPEs without available record of 

accountability, follow the procedures, to derecognize non-

existing PPEs as provided in Item 7.0 of COA Circular No. 2020-

006 dated January 31, 2020; 

 

III. Inventory Committee: 
 

e. submit an approved Property Inventory Plan covering the entire 
process of inventory-taking from planning, execution of actual 

physical count, and reporting thereof, specific 

assignments/duties of the Committee members, the cut-off date, 

schedule specifying the dates and locations of the inventory 

taking activities from start up to the targeted completion of the 

physical inventory and submit proof of compliance therewith to 

the Audit Team within a reasonable period of two months from 

receipt hereof; and 

 

f. accomplish properly the RPCPPE taking into consideration the 
lapses and deficiencies noted, provide all the required 

information therein in order to come up with an accurate 

reporting, submit the same to the Audit Team  within a 

reasonable period of two months from receipt hereof, pursuant 

to the provisions of Section 122, PD 1445 to preclude the 

imposable sanctions thereon, i.e., the outright withholding of 

salaries of the concerned officials and employees. 

 

 

Non-disclosure/incomplete financial information regarding Intangible Assets  

 

9. The reliability, accuracy and propriety of Intangible Assets as of December 31, 
2020 amounting to ₱1,221,741.05 were doubtful due to: a) non-disclosure of 

accounting policies, description and financial information required by the 

International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) 31 on “Intangible 

Assets”; and b) incomplete financial information for recognition criteria of 

existing and proposed Information Systems; thereby affecting the fair 



97 

 

presentation of Intangible Assets in the FSs for CY 2020 contrary to the 

provisions stated in the GAM for NGAs, Volume I. 

 

9.1. The GAM for NGAs, Volume I provides the following provisions for 
faithful representation of transactions, events and conditions and accounting 

recognition, measurement, and disclosures for Intangible Assets: 

 

 Section 4, Chapter 12. Recognition of Intangible Asset. An intangible 
asset shall be recognized if, and only if: 

 

a. It is probable that the expected future economic benefits or service 
potential that are attributable to the asset will flow to the entity; and 

 

b. The cost or fair value of the asset can be measured reliably. (Par. 28, 
IPSAS 31) 

 

 Section 9(b), Chapter 12. The depreciable amount of an intangible asset 
with a finite useful life shall be allocated on a systematic basis over its 

useful life. As a guideline, the finite useful life of intangible assets shall 

be 2 to 10 years. Amortization shall begin when the asset is available for 

use, i.e., when it is in the location and condition necessary for it to be 

capable of operating in the manner intended by management. 

Amortization shall cease at the earlier of the date that the asset is 

classified as held for sale (or included in a disposal group that is 

classified as held for sale). (Par. 96, IPSAS 31) 

 

9.2.The Intangible Assets of the University are composed of Computer Software and 

Development in Progress – Computer Software costing ₱2,619,996.00.  Additions 

during the year amounted to ₱500,000.00 and ₱325,096.00 for Computer 

Software and Development in Progress – Computer Software, respectively.  As of 

December 31, 2020, the carrying amount was reported at ₱1,221,741.05.  The

9.5. As per Section 3, Chapter 12 of the GAM for NGAs, the above Information 
Systems were qualified as an Intangible Assets as they possess the elements 

of identifiability, control over a resource and existence of future economic 

benefits or service potential.  However, although qualified as intangible 

assets, they must meet the recognition criteria stated in Section 4, Chapter 

12 of the same Manual.  The compliance of the aforesaid information 

systems with the recognition criteria cannot be reasonably determined due to 

incomplete financial information, such as mode of acquisition, cost/ fair 

market value, year available for use or started to use, useful life, 

status/condition, among others. 

 

9.6. The same is true for 11 proposed Information Systems of the University

COMPLIANCE AUDIT 

 

Unutilized funds for Anti-COVID 19 Spread Program 

 

10. The COVID-19 Response Funds through Higher Education Development Fund 
(HEDF) of CHED granted to the PUP as Anti-COVID 19 Spread Program 

(ACSP): Production of 70 percent Ethyl Alcohol Solution with Virgin Coconut 

Oil (VCO) amounting to ₱4,945,844.00 remained unutilized as the Program 

has not yet started due to delayed procurement of supplies, materials and 

equipment. 

 

10.1. President Rodrigo Duterte, through Proclamation No. 922 dated March 8, 
2020, declared the Philippines under the State of Public Health Emergency 

upon confirmation of local transmission of Corona Virus Disease (Covid-

19) in the Philippines.  Section 2 of Proclamation No. 922 states that:  

 

All government agencies and LGUs are hereby enjoined to render 

full assistance and cooperation and mobilize the necessary 

resources to undertake critical, urgent, and appropriate response 

and measure in a timely manner to curtail and eliminate the Covid-

19 threat. 

 

10.2. As cited in the CHED Memorandum Order No. 1 s. 2020 dated April 2, 
2020 and under the Memorandum from the Executive Secretary dated 

March 28, 2020, the whole of government must work together towards the 

following objectives: protect and support our health workers and front 

liners; provide the supplies and equipment necessary for detecting the 

disease and caring to those infected; ensure that community quarantines are 

effectively implemented; deliver essential necessities such as food and 

medicine to the most vulnerable; x x x, and, mobilize all state assets to 

sustain the operation of the government. Section B (4) of the said 

Memorandum allows the Department of Budget and Management (DBM), 

to allocate cash, funds, investments, including utilized or unreleased 

subsidies and transfers, held by national government agency in order to 

address the COVID-19 emergency, as declared in Section 3 of Republic Act 

(RA) No. 11469, otherwise known as the ―Bayanihan to Heal as One Act.‖ 

 

10.3. Moreover, State Universities and Colleges (SUCs) are authorized by-
laws/charters to conduct research and extension services, including projects 

that will improve and intensify the government‘s existing COVID-19 

responses. In the report of the President to the Congress on March 30, 2020, 

the President had identified efforts undertaken by CHED such as mobilizing 

HEIs to assist in the production and distribution of items (such as 

disinfectants, alcohol, face shields, etc.) for use by frontline service 

providers. 

  



104 

 

10.4. The aforementioned CHED Memorandum Order prescribes the guidelines 
for the grant of assistance to SUCs to Combat COVID-19, in response to the 

national emergency by allocating/utilizing its funds towards mitigating the 

social, economic, and financial impact of COVID-19 on Filipinos. To be 

eligible for the grant, SUCs must possess, among others, the expertise and 

capability in manufacturing of products listed in Annex B of GPPB 

Resolution No. 3-2020 dated March 9, 2020, which included alcohol and 

sanitizers, except for drugs/medicines as evidenced by the involvement of 

licensed chemists, pharmacists, and/or microbiologists in the team. 

 

10.5. The PUP is one of the SUCs that received a grant from the CHED to 
conduct extension and public service programs to combat COVID-19. 

 

10.6. As such, an undated MOA was executed between the CHED and PUP, and, 
as agreed therein, the former will render additional financial support to the 

latter in order to upgrade their institutional capability and sustain the 

production of much needed goods and/or delivery of important services. 

 

10.7. The MOA states that the CHED through its HEDF shall provide the amount 
of ₱4,946,844.64 for the implementation of the extension program/project 

titled, Anti COVID-19 Spread Program (ACSP): Production of 70% Ethyl 

Alcohol Solution with Virgin Coconut Oil (VCO), to be released in full in 

accordance with the approved Line Item Budget (LIB), Work Plan (WP) and 

Terms of Reference (TOR) contained in Annex A - Project Proposal.  The 

full amount was transferred to PUP‘s LBP Account on August 28, 2020 and 

receipted on September 8, 2020 per Official Receipt (OR) No. 0419211.   

 

10.8. Salient provisions of the MOA are summarized in the table below with 
corresponding degree of compliance therewith and audit observations and/or

    The FIRST PARTY may, based on evidence of 

failure of the SECOND PARTY to comply with the 

terms of the grant agreement, or in the event the 

SECOND PARTY incurs unreasonable delay, 

inaction, or break of obligation under the

enter into new contracts. The SECOND PARTY 

shall also reduce the amount of other outstanding 

commitments insofar as possible. 

 

10.9. Based on our evaluation on the extent of compliance with the 
abovementioned provisions, the Audit Team found out that the PUP was in 

compliance with Sections 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.10 and 2.13 of Article I.  However, 

the PUP did not comply with Section 2.5 of the same Article because the 

Project Team did not submit weekly updates on a regular basis and the 

Audit Team was only furnished with a copy of the progress update 

presented to the CHED on December 3, 2020 via Zoom. 

 

10.10. However, the remaining Sections of Article I (e. g. 2.1, 2.6, 2.7, 2.8, 2.9, 
2.10, 2.11 and 2.12), Articles III and V cannot be fully ascertained, 

determined and validated because the implementation of the project has not 

yet started or is delayed as it is still in the procurement stage of materials, 

supplies and equipment needed in the PUP‘s Anti-COVID 19 Spread 

Program, as discussed in succeeding paragraphs. 

 

10.11. As allowed under the GPPB Resolution No. 3-2020 dated 9 March 2020 and 
Section 53.2 of the 2016 Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations of 

(IRR) of Republic Act (RA) No. 9184, the PUP resorted to Negotiated 

Procurement (Emergency Cases) modality with technically, legally and 

financially capable suppliers.   

 

10.12. In determination of technical, legal and financial specifications of suppliers, 
the Procurement Management Office (PMO) used the market surveys and/or 

market scanning or scoping of capable suppliers conducted by the Program 

Team except for the supplier of alcohol.  Prior to the grant of assistance for 

the Anti-COVID-19 Spread Program, the PUP had already produced local 

alcohol for PUP community and stakeholders, which was externally funded 

by another benefactor.  The same supplier will be contracted for this 

program. 

 

10.13. Embodied in the GPP resolution are the following provisions for the 
procurement procedures accompanied by degree of compliance therewith 

and audit findings and/or observations:

10.14. Based on the validation of the Audit Team, the PUP observed the above 
provisions, thus the preliminary activities for the procurement of supplies 

and materials and equipment of the PUP is in compliance with the GPPB 

Resolution No. 3-2020 dated March 9, 2020. 

  



111 

 

10.15. Despite its compliance therewith, the PUP is still in the process of 
requesting price quotation from prospective suppliers as shown in the table 

below.  In fact, the prices of all items had already been quoted except for the 

main raw material, which is Ethyl alcohol.  However, none of these items 

had been awarded and purchased as of January 15, 2021.  The Procurement 

Management Office, as the concerned unit for the procurement of these 

items, explained that the suppliers were not responsive upon request of 

items being quoted which caused the delay. The status of procurement of the 

materials is as follows:

10.16. On the other hand, the third-party analysis of the 70% Ethyl Alcohol 
Solution with VCO for the ―Antimicrobial Activity, Specific Gravity, pH, 



112 

 

Turbidity Test‖ and ―Ethanol Determination (% alcohol content) Test‖ will 

be conducted by the Industrial Technology Department Institute (ITDI) and 

Department of Science and Technology (DOST) – CALABARZON at 

quoted price of ₱157,200.00 and ₱240,000.00, respectively.  The Notices of 

Award (NOAs) and MOA were already submitted for signature of the ITDI 

and DOST – CALABARZON.  However, the third-party analysis will only 

be conducted once the production of Ethyl Alcohol with VCO has been 

completed. 

 

10.17. Inasmuch as there is a delayed procurement of materials, supplies and 
equipment, the production of Ethyl Alcohol with VCO cannot be started by 

the Program Team.  As a result, the project remains unimplemented and its 

funds remain unutilized.  Also, the extent of compliance with the Articles I – 

Logical Log Frame and III - Proposed Budget of the MOA cannot be fully 

ascertained, validated and determined by the Audit Team, as shown on the 

table below:

10.19. But the Article V of the CHED Memorandum states that ―The grant is for a 
period of 2 to 3 months from the release of funds and is automatically 

extended should the community quarantine is extended by government 

beyond the three-month period.  Provided that grantees shall have sixty 



114 

 

days from the end of the grant period to liquidate and submit terminal 

reports.” 

 

10.20. Accordingly, the implementation of the project should have been completed 
on December 4, 2020.  But, the grant was not liquidated within three months 

from receipt of funds and from August 28, 2020 to January 15, 2021, the 

program incurred already significant delays of 165 calendar days. Thus, the 

PUP did not comply with said provision of CHED Memorandum and the set 

schedule indicated in the Article II of the Annex A – Project Proposal of 

MOA. 

 

10.21. However, the PUP has already requested, upon concurrence of the BOR, for 
an extension of the project implementation for six months from December 

15, 2020 to June 14, 2021 in a letter dated January 7, 2021, subject to 

approval of CHED. 

 

10.22. As a conclusion, the extent of compliance with the pertinent provisions on 
the utilization of funds provided by the CHED to the PUP cannot be fully 

ascertained, validated and determined because the program has not yet 

started due to delayed procurement of materials, supplies and equipment, as 

summarized below:

115 

 

10.23. We recommended that the: 
 

I. Procurement Management Office: 
 

a. Expedite the procurement process of the needed materials, 
supplies and equipment in order to finish the project on 

extended time; 

 

II. Program Team: 
 

b. Submit to the CHED the Weekly Reports, copy furnished the 
Audit Team; 

 

c. Follow up the request for extension of the program that was 
submitted to CHED for approval, and submit a copy of the 

approved request to the Audit Team; and 

 

d. Update the Audit Team of the subsequent activities, and submit 
pertinent documents relating to the implementation of the 

project. 

 

10.24. The Management affirms its commitment to expedite the procurement of the 
needed materials, supplies and equipment relative to the MOA between the 

CHED and PUP for the implementation of Anti-COVID Special Program: 

Production of 70% Ethyl Alcohol Solution with Virgin Coconut Oil with 

faithful observance of the provisions of RA No. 9184 and its IRR. 

 

10.25. Moreover, the following actions were taken by the Project Team: 
 

1) Submitted the progress tracking tool last December 3, 2020, January 14 
and 15, 2021 to CHED; weekly status reports were submitted to CHED 

last January 14 and 25, 2021; 

 

2) The request for extension was followed-up to CHED and Ms. Thea 
Ingalla, the coordinator for COVID-19 response from CHED said that 

the request is still pending for approval of the board; and  

 

3) At present, the materials needed to procure 70% ethyl alcohol solution 
are still in procurement process and the team will update the COA 

Office for its subsequent activities once the production started.

Implementation of the Free Higher Education 

 

11. Deficient compliance with the IRR of Republic Act No. 10931 or the Universal 
Access to Quality Tertiary Act of 2017 and CHED Memorandum Circular No. 

2018-002, dated August 8, 2018 on the Free Higher Education benefits were 

noted such as: a) delayed recording of transactions; b) delayed billing to 

CHED of the Tuition and Other School Fees ranging from 112 to 252 days;  

c) non-formulation of the mechanics of the Opt-Out Mechanism and Student 

Voluntary Contribution Mechanism; d) non-submission of soft copy files of the 

billings in USB flash drive; e) non maintenance of separate bank account;  

f) incomplete information on the billing statement as required under the 

Consolidated Billing Details Form 2 and other necessary data for  easy 

monitoring of the students who are eligible as beneficiary; j) non-submission to 

the UniFAST Governing Board of annual report and other reportorial 

requirements on the date/s set by Congress. 

 

11.1. Republic Act (R.A.) 10931, or the ―Universal Access to Quality Tertiary 
Education Act of 2017‖ also known as the Free Higher Education (HE) Act, 

has been enacted to [promote] universal access to quality tertiary education 

by providing free tuition and other school fees in State Universities and 

College (SUC)s, Local Universities and Colleges (LUC), and State-Run 

Technical-Vocational Institutions (TVI), [while] establishing the Tertiary 

Education Subsidy (TES) and Student Loan Program (SLP), strengthening 

the Unified Student Financial Assistance System for Tertiary Education 

(UniFAST). 

 

11.2. The IRR of R.A. No. 10931 enforces the intentions of the Act to promote 
social justice, and the advancement of nation building recognizes the 

inalienable right of all Filipinos to quality education and, thus protects and 

promotes the right of all Filipino students to accessible quality education.  

The IRR recognizes the complementary roles of public and private Higher 

Education Institutions (HEIs) and Technical-Vocational Institutions in the 

tertiary education system, and the invaluable contribution of private tertiary 

institutions to the education system. 

 

11.3. Section 8 of the said IRR provides for the Opt-Out Mechanism where all 
SUCs and LUCs shall create a mechanism to enable students with financial 

capacity to pay for their education and voluntarily opt out of the subsidy for 

tuition and other school fees. xxx Students who choose to voluntarily opt out 

of the provision shall sign and submit a waiver to the SUC or LUC where 

they are enrolling in. The SUC or LUC shall develop a pro-forma waiver, 

which shall be notarized by the institution, and which has the following 

information: (a) a statement certifying that the student is cognizant of the 

Act and all his/her benefits and responsibilities under the Act, providing the 

reason for opting out of the provision and certifying that the student made 

the choice voluntarily and not under duress; (b) the academic period 



117 

 

(semester/term and academic year) in which the student opted out; (c) 

signature of the student, and if the student is a minor, the signature of his/her 

legal guardian or parent; and (d) certification/acceptance by the registrar 

and/or the guidance counselor. Students who successfully opt-out of the free 

higher education provision during a semester / term shall be exempt from 

the civic obligation during the same semester / term. 

 

11.4. Likewise, Section 9 of the same IRR provides that all SUCs and LUCs shall 
create a mechanism to enable students with the financial capacity to pay for 

their education to voluntarily contribute a particular financial amount to the 

SUC or LUC while availing themselves of the free higher education 

provision. xxx Students who choose to pay a voluntary contribution shall 

sign and submit a Voluntary Contribution Form to the SUC or LUC in 

which they are enrolling. The SUC or LUC shall develop a pro-forma 

contribution form, which shall be notarized by the institution, and which has 

the following information: (a) a statement certifying that the student is 

cognizant of the Act and all his/her benefits and responsibilities under the 

Act and that the student made the choice voluntarily and not under duress; 

(b) the amount of the financial contribution; (c) the academic period 

(semester/term and academic year) in which the student made the voluntary 

contribution; (d) signature of the student, and if the student is a minor, the 

signature of his/her legal guardian or parent; and (e) certification/acceptance 

by the registrar and/or the guidance counselor. 

 

11.5. Relatively, UniFAST issued CHED Memorandum Circular No. 2018-002 
dealing on the Guidelines on Free HE in SUCs and CHED-Recognized 

LUCs. Under Section 1.2 of Rule III of the same guidelines cited two 

options available to SUCs and CHED-recognized LUCs for the method of 

disbursements, namely:  

 

a. Fund transfer with the initial 50% fund transfer will be based on the 
computed budget ceiling which will be recommended by the CHED-

UniFAST for SUCs and CHED recognized LUCs; and 

 

b. Billing system wherein the tuition and other school fees of actual 
qualified enrolled students in SUCs/CHED recognized LUCs will be 

billed to CHED-UniFAST for settlement. Due diligence procedures will 

be executed to ensure that the consolidated Free Higher Education 

statement, consolidated billing details and certification from SUCs and 

CHED recognized LUCs‘ Registrars will tie up with the PDF copies of 

the Certificates of Registration (CORs) for each semester in academic 

year. 

 

  



118 

 

11.6. Accordingly, the PUP opted to bill the CHED. Thus, PUP is required to 
submit the following documents in printed-out copies as mentioned in 

Section 2.2.2 of Rule III of the Circular mentioned above, as follows: 

 

a. Consolidated Free HE Form 1; 
b. Consolidated Free HE Form 2; 
c. College/ University Registrar‘s Certification (with official dry seal) 

stating the number of officially enrolled students and the number of 

students who qualified to the Free HE and certifying the correctness and 

completeness of the details; and 

d. Master List of Applicants duly certified by the SUC/ CHED-recognized 
LUC Admission Officer as a validation documents to support the 

Consolidated Free HE Billing Details Part II – Segment B on Admission 

Fees and Entrance Fees. 

 

11.7. Correspondingly, electronic copies of the following should be submitted to 
the designated e-mail address of UniFAST Secretariat, and it was noted to 

ensure that the e-copies of the following files, SUCs and CHED-recognized 

LUCs are requested to send these files in a USB flash drive together with 

the  hard-copy, as follows: 

 

a. The Free HE Consolidated Statement (Form 1); 
b. MS excel file of the Consolidated Free HE Form 2 – Free HE Details; 
c. Pdf copy of Certificates of Registration (with subjects taken and 

breakdown of fees) of all students listed in the Free HE Details and as 

certified by College/ University Registrar; 

d. Pdf of Pre-Number Application Forms (with 1x1 Identification photo 
and Admission Exam result indicated therein) as a validation documents 

to support the Consolidated Free HE Billing Details Part II – Segment B 

on Admission Fees and Entrance Fees; 

e. MS Excel file of all data elements contained in the CORs 
xxx 

 

11.8. As part of the Program support mechanism, Section 1.3 of Rule IV of the 
same MC requires SUCs to: 

 

c. maintain a separate bank account for proper account management of the 
Free Higher Education; and 

xxx 

e. submit an annual report and other reportorial requirements on the date/s 
set by Congress regarding the implementation of Free Higher Education 

to the UniFAST Governing Board on or before a specific date set by the 

UniFAST Governing Board. 

 

  



119 

 

11.9. Moreover, Section 111 (1) of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 states that 
the accounts of an agency shall be kept in such detail as is necessary to meet 

the needs of the agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish the 

information needed by fiscal or control agencies of the government.  

 

11.10. Likewise, Section 112 of PD No. 1445 provides that each government 
agency shall record its financial transactions and operations conformably 

with generally accepted accounting principles and in accordance with 

pertinent laws and regulations. 

 

11.11. Section 6, Chapter 2 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I provides in part that 
each entity shall recognize and present its financial transactions and 

operations conformably to the accrual basis of accounting in accordance 

with the IPSAS. 

 

11.12. As provided under GAM for NGAs, Volume III, Due from National 
Government Agencies account (Debit) - is used to recognize advances for 

purchase of goods/services as authorized by law, fund transfers to the NGAs 

for implementation of projects and other receivables from NGAs. Credit this 

account upon receipt of goods/services, and liquidation of fund 

transfers/receivables. 

 

11.13. As of December 31, 2020, the Due from NGAs included a balance for the 
billings to Commission on Higher Education (CHED) amounting to 

₱27,431,576.80. In SY 2019-2020, the total number of students who 

enrolled and availed the Free HE in the PUP, are as follows:

Summer SY 2019-2020 9,804 9,393 

 

11.14. Analysis of the transactions pertaining to the FHE revealed timing 
differences in the occurrence and the recording of the same in the books. 

Comparison between bank deposit and OR date revealed delays ranging 

from 9-257 days. Despite the follow ups made by the Management, the 

source agency did not inform that the payments had been deposited already 

on the account. As a result, preparation of the OR for the payment was 

delayed from deposit date and recognition of income and adjustment of Due 

from NGAs - CHED was also delayed. Details are shown on the next page.

11.15. Moreover, submissions of the printed-out billing copies were delayed 
ranging from 112 to 252 days reckoned from the deadline set forth in the 

IRR, which implied that the University was deprived of the timely 

enjoyment of the income from tuition and other school fees. Details are as 

follows:

*Extended for one (1) week intended for the one-week adjustment period. 

 

11.16. Further, granting that the Free HE Act has a purpose of providing free 
tuition and other school fees to students, the said Act also provided for the 

Opt Out Mechanism and Student Voluntary Contribution Mechanism where 

the student, even qualified for the said Act, may voluntarily choose not to 

avail of the said benefit as discussed in Sections 8 and 9 of the IRR of RA 

No. 10931. For the student to avail such option, the Management should 

formulate the mechanics, inform the students at earliest possible time, and 

let them sign a waiver as constructed by the Management. 

 

11.17. Upon inquiry with the Management, they were able to make initial actions 
regarding the formulation of such mechanism; however, none has been 

finalized, contrary to Section 8 and 9 of the IRR of RA No. 10931. 

Nonetheless, they still informed the students about the options, however, no 

student availed the same.

11.18. As mentioned above, the PUP opted to bill the CHED for the Free HE, 
therefore, the PUP is subject to the billing system procedures as provided to 

the CHED Memorandum Circular No. 2018-002. All procedures and 

requirements were complied with, except the noted deficiencies, as follows:

the Management 

and no set dates 

were provided by 

the UniFAST

as well. 

No annual report 

and other reportorial 

requirements were 

submitted. 

 

11.19. Lastly, the reports submitted do not contain the required information as to 
StuFAP availments of the students-beneficiaries as per instruction in the 

Consolidated Free HE Form 2, as well as the given example under Section 

11(b) of Rule II of the IRR of the RA No. 1093, which may facilitate the 

validation and monitoring of the eligibility of the student as beneficiary of 

the said Act, such as: 

 

a. Type of StuFAP availed apart from Free Tuition Fee (if any) - indicate 
all government-funded StuFAPs availed by the student for the term, 

separated by comma if the student availed more than one government-

funded StuFAP; 

 

b. Amount of StuFAP Availment - indicate the total cumulative annual 
benefit amount from all StuFAPs availed by the student for the term; and 

 

c. Number of semesters left in the Free HE benefits. 
 

11.20. We recommended that Management: 
 

a. ensure submission of printed-out billings within five (5) days after 
the last day of registration as required under Section 2.2.2 of Rule 

III of the CHED Memorandum Circular; 

 

b. formulate opt-out and student voluntary contribution mechanisms, 
together with the necessary forms to be signed and notarized upon 

availment, for the students who are capacitated to pay and for those 

who voluntarily avail such mechanism; 

 

c. submit soft copy of the files of the billings in USB flash drive 
together with the printed-out copies in accordance with Section 2.2.2 

of Rule III of the CHED Memorandum Circular, copy furnished the 

Audit Team;  



124 

 

d. maintain a separate bank account for proper account management 
of the fund for Free Higher Education as per Section 1.3(c3) of Rule 

IV of the CHED Memorandum Circular;  

 

e. provide information on the students such as: (a) Type of StuFAP 
availed apart from Free Tuition Fee (if any); (b) Amount of StuFAP 

Availment; and (c) Number of semesters left in the Free HE 

benefits, for proper monitoring of the remaining available semester 

of a student-beneficiary; and 

 

f. submit an annual report and other reportorial requirements on the 
date/s set by Congress regarding the implementation of Free Higher 

Education to the UniFAST Governing Board, and submit proof of 

receipt to the Audit Team. 

 

11.21. The Management submitted billings for the 1
st
 semester SY 2020-2021 to 

CHED within 3-8 days after all data have been received. To note, data was 

received on October 14, 2020 and the billing was submitted on October 16, 

2020. The OPT-OUT waiver from was formulated last May 23, 2018. 

Moreover, the Management submits softcopies of files in USB/ flash drive 

for the AY 2017-2018 billing, however PUP submitted the softcopy of files 

via email with link to Google Drive for the succeeding billings. The 

Management believes that opening and maintaining a separate account for 

the Free Higher Education is impractical because the payment from CHED- 

UniFAST is directly deposited to STF (Fund 164).  

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

11.22. Adjustments made were verified, but the Management shall ensure to record 
billings once supporting documents were already complete. The submitted 

Opt-Out Waiver Form was validated, however, the Management shall also 

prepare waiver forms for student voluntary contribution mechanism.  

 

11.23. As regards the submission of the softcopy files, Management is encouraged 
to Secure acknowledgment from the CHED that the submission of the 

google drive links suffice the requirement under the CHED Memorandum 

Circular.  

 

11.24. Opening of the separate account for the deposits from the CHED exclusively 
for the Free Tuition Fee and other Miscellaneous Fee will make the 

monitoring of the said account more convenient. Payments can be easily 

seen on the monthly Bank Reconciliation Statement even if the CHED fails 

to notify. Thus, opening of separate account is still recommended.  

 

  



125 

 

11.25. Make a proper communication with the CHED-UniFAST regarding the 
recognized bottlenecks, in order for them to make proper response/ action. 

Moreover, once the data were already reconciled and corrected, provide us 

information as indicated in the recommendation. According to the 

Memorandum, it is the SUCs/ LUCs which will submit the reportorial 

documents to the Congress, however, if there is an internal arrangement that 

it is the CHED who will consolidate and submit report, provide us a copy of 

the said arrangement, otherwise, provide us a receipt copy of the said report 

by the CHED. 

 

 

Implementation of the Tertiary Education Subsidy 

 

12. Lapses in the implementation of the Tertiary Education Subsidy (TES), 
contrary to the provisions of the RA No. 10931, and its IRR, and the MOA 

between CHED, UniFAST Board, and PUP, affected the immediate 

educational needs of the beneficiaries due to: a) late receipt, recording and 

reporting of the fund transfers from CHED for Academic Year (AY) 2019-

2020 subsidy totaling ₱55,372,800.00 resulting in delayed releases/distribution 

thereof to the approved student-beneficiaries, including the corresponding 

administrative costs, of which a total of ₱28,757,600.00 was released only in 

2021; b) delayed receipt of the corresponding administrative costs; c) variance 

of one to 59 in the number of approved beneficiaries in the respective PUP 

campus/branch per Listahan 2.0 as compared with the Payroll Registry 

causing the excessive fund transfers by CHED, which are still unreverted by 

PUP amounting to ₱3,831,600.00; d) errors in the courses or programs 

enrolled by the students as reflected in the Masterlist; and e) lack of specific 

rules on the liquidation of the releases of the TES. 

 

12.1. Pursuant to Section 7 of RA No. 10931, the TES has been established for 
Filipino Students who shall enroll in undergraduate–post-secondary 

programs of SUCs, CHED-Recognized LUCs, private HEIs and all 

Technical Vocational Institutions (TVIs), to support the cost of tertiary 

education or any portion thereof. 

 

12.2. Section 23 of the IRR of RA No. 10931 provides for the benefits that may 
be availed of under the TES, to wit: 

 

a) Tuition and other school fees in private HEIs, and in private or LGU-
operated TVIs, which shall be equivalent to the tuition and other school 

fees of the nearest SUC or State-run TVI in their respective area; 

 

b) Allowance for books, supplies, transportation, and miscellaneous 
personal expenses, including reasonable allowance for the documented 

rental or purchase of personal computer or laptop; and other education-

expenses;  



126 

 

c) Allowance for room and board costs incurred by the student; 
 

d) For a student with disability, allowance for expenses related to the 
student‘s disability, including special services, personal assistance, 

transportation, equipment, and supplies that are reasonably incurred; and 

 

e) For a student in a program requiring professional license or certification, 
the one-tome cost of obtaining the first professional credentials or 

qualifications, which may include the following application fees: 

notarial fees, review classes fees, insurance premium fees, and 

documentation fees. 

 

12.3. Section 24 of the IRR states that the amount of subsidy shall be based on the 
guidelines set forth by the UniFAST Board and on the annual budgetary 

appropriation for the purpose. Among the general rules enumerated therein 

provides that the students enrolled in SUCs and LUCs under programs 

offered of the HEIs, are entitled for TES for education-related expenses as 

defined in (b) to (c) above; and TES for expenses defined in (d) and (e) 

above, if necessary. 

 

12.4. Further, all TES beneficiaries enrolled in SUCs, LUCs and private HEIs, 
shall be entitled to a full academic-year grant amount for students enrolled 

in programs offered therein, subject to yearly renewal based on their 

continued studies. 

 

12.5. A Tripartite MOA dated June 13, 2018, between the Commission on Higher 
Education, UniFAST Governing Board and the PUP has been entered into to 

effectively implement the Free Higher Education (FHE), TES and Student 

Loan Program (SLP) to its intended student beneficiaries. 

 

12.6. In Item 1.4(d) of the said MOA, the PUP undertakes, among others, to 
diligently implement and comply with the IRR of RA 10931 and the specific 

provisions of Rules II and III of these guidelines on FHE; the specific 

provision of Section 6.5 of the guidelines on TES and the specific provisions 

of Rules II and III of the guidelines on the SLP. Specifically, the following 

procedures will have to be undertaken: 

 

(d1) Issue an OR for every amount received from CHED in relation to the 

implementation of RA 1093, specifically on FHE, TES and SLP; 

 

(d2) Deposit the amount received in relation to FHE, TES and SLP to the 

authorized depository bank; 

 

(d3) Maintain a separate bank account for proper account management for 

the FHE, TES and SLP; 

  



127 

 

(d4) To utilize the funds subject to usual accounting rules and regulations 

and/or the pertinent provisions of RA No. 8292; with respect to 

mobilization funds that will be transferred, will be subject to 

submission of liquidation reports (LRs) duly signed by authorized 

signatories within the prescribed period; 

 

(d5) Be accountable to the funds received from CHED pursuant to the 

agreement; 

 

(d6) Revert back to CHED excess fund transfer (if applicable); 

 

(d7) Comply with the provisions of COA Circular No. 94-013 as may be 

warranted by the situation. 

 

12.7. For the implementation of the TES Program for AY 2019-2020, CHED 
released to PUP a total amount of ₱55,372,800.00 corresponding to the 

stipends/ subsidies of the approved student beneficiaries and administrative 

costs, in the amounts of ₱53,760,000.00, and ₱1,612,800.00, respectively.  

 

12.8. As culled from the SLs submitted by the Accounting Office, the PUP has 
received a total amount of ₱26,615,200.00 intended for a total of 1,292 

student-beneficiaries from among the PUP Branches and Campuses for the 

First Semester of Academic Year 2019-2020. Details are as follows:

12.9. Inferring from the table above, transfers made by CHED of the funds 
representing the subsidy of the student-beneficiaries are not promptly 

receipted and recorded in the books of accounts. The stipends as well as the 

corresponding administrative costs were intended to benefit the students 

beginning June 2019. This was confirmed in an interview with the 

Scholarships and Financial Assistance Services (SFAS), the Focal Persons 

administering the TES in PUP, who averred that they were not immediately 



128 

 

informed when the fund was credited to PUP Landbank Account, despite 

regular follow-up to the CHED NCR UniFAST Coordinator. 

 

12.10. Also, subsidy and administrative costs totaling ₱28,757,600.00 intended for 
the TES Beneficiaries, TES-ESGPPA Beneficiaries for First Semester, and 

TES Beneficiaries for Second Semester of AY2019-2020 are just credited in 

2021, considering that it is already the Second Semester of the succeeding 

academic year. The SFAS has received constant follow-ups from other 

branches and campuses, parents, and student-beneficiaries themselves on the 

status of their subsidies. Details are as follows:

12.11. According to the Chief, Student Services Section, the distribution of the 
subsidy is still in-progress, and committed that pertinent reports shall be 

submitted once the Cashier‘s Office completed the distribution of the 

stipends. They are also waiting for the students‘ confirmation of the account 

numbers to be used in the crediting thereof.  

 

12.12. The delayed distribution of the stipends, and the corresponding 
administrative costs, defeats the timely realization of the objectives of the 

program, which is intended to support the cost of tertiary education or any 

portion of thereof, of students enrolled in the university. The student-

beneficiaries stated that they have resorted to borrowing temporarily 

interest-bearing loans from individuals to defray their urgent school-related 

expenses, which they promised to pay once the stipend is released to them. 



129 

 

Also, one has intended to buy a laptop to be used for the online classes, but 

was not able to do so since the stipends have not yet been released. Some 

resorted to apply for part-time work in order to support their educational 

expenses. 

 

12.13. Further, the amount advanced by the CHED intended for 1,292 student-
beneficiaries was more than the number of approved grantees per Listahan 

2.0 which only included a total 1,276 student-beneficiaries, both continuing 

and new, or a difference of 16 student beneficiaries. Moreover, of the 1,276 

student-beneficiaries in the Listahan 2.0 for both continuing and new 

approved grantees, only 1,106 were paid, while the remaining 170 were 

either unpaid; or although included in the list, registered an invalid or closed 

bank account; or according to the SFAS, were included in the Registry 

pertaining to other campuses; some have already graduated; and status of 

others cannot be determined. Details are as follows:

12.15. Further, verification of the releases made by the PUP to the intended 
student-beneficiaries revealed that a total of ₱3,831,600.00 remained in the 

books of account of the PUP despite the apparent excess in the amount 

transferred by the CHED less the amount intended for the students who have 

reported invalid or closed accounts, contrary to the provisions of the MOA

12.16. Moreover, the Courses of the students as indicated in the Masterlist are not 
their real courses since the program registry in the TES Portal is not yet 

updated and does not reflect the list of actual courses or programs offered by 

the University. This is despite the request of the PUP for updating, complete 

with supporting documents. According to the SFAS, they are merely 

instructed to input in the TES Portal the nearest related program to the 

courses enrolled by the students. A case in point is one student actually 

enrolled in BS Accountancy but the course reflected in the portal is the 

Bachelor of Banking and Finance, the nearest course included in the Portal. 

  



132 

 

12.17. It must be noted that the implementing guidelines of the TES, as well as the 
MOA, provide for the requirement of the liquidation of the fund transfers, 

but did not provide for the liquidation documents to be submitted and the 

period of liquidation by the recipient SUCs and CHED-recognized LUCs, 

together with a penalty clause in case of failure to liquidate the transferred 

funds within the prescribed period. The Management merely submits 

Payroll Registry and the List of Recipients as attachment to the LDDAP-

ADA which is not sufficient to support the liquidation of the fund transfers. 

 

12.18. We recommended that Management: 
 

a. constantly request from and coordinate with the Focal Person of 
CHED-UniFAST for the timely release of the fund transfers, and 

eventually distribute to the intended recipients within the semester 

of the grant, to maximize the utility and benefits of the stipend; 

 

b. make formal representation with CHED-UniFAST for the updating 
of the Masterlist of the campuses, courses enrolled, among others, 

consistent with the general provisions of the MOA that the parties 

mutually agree to perform and abide thereby; 

 

c. timely submit the LRs for the fund releases for stipends and 
administrative cost credited in CY 2021 intended for the TES for 

AY 2019-2020; 

 

d. revert the excess of the fund transfers to CHED after determining 
the status of the students which remained unpaid; and 

 

e. request for clarification with the CHED on the liquidation 
requirements for the stipends paid to the students, as well as for the 

administrative costs, and require from the student-beneficiaries and 

concerned offices, the needed supporting documents. 

 

Management Comments: 

 

12.19. The Scholarship and Financial Assistance Services is regularly monitoring 
the fund transfer through email sent to CHED UniFAST Coordinator for 

NCR and to afmcash@ched.gov.ph to inquire on the status of fund release 

and to three groups in Messenger. This is aside from the text messages and 

calls between the PUP Focal Person and the UniFAST Coordinator. 

 

12.20. Messenger groups for follow-up of TES Implementation and Funding: 
1) UniFAST GC: Public HEIs 
2) PUP queries 
3) PUP TDP TES ONGOING 2019-2020 

  

mailto:afmcash@ched.gov.ph


133 

 

12.21. Despite the follow-up, there is still delay in the release of fund and the 
notice on the availability of fund. The Academic Year 2019-2020 had ended 

when the fund has been released. However, there is a new program 

implemented by UniFAST wherein grantees will be enrolled to a new 

LandBank TES Card where fund will be directly credited from UniFAST to 

the grantee‘s account. 

 

12.22. Problems regarding the Masterlist, courses enrolled, and updating of 
program registry in the TES portal were communicated to CHED UniFAST 

through email. 

 

12.23. On June 4, 2020, the SFAS communicated various concerns on the 
Masterlist provided and concerns were summarized as follows: 

 

1) There are students who are in the partial list of approved grantees, but 
are not included in the official list sent by CHED UniFAST. 

2) There are students who are in the list of approved grantees, but are not 
included in the official list sent by CHED UniFAST. 

3) There are grantees in the official list who are not students of PUP. 
4) The official list of grantees is listed according to branch/campus. 

However, upon checking, there are students in the list for the main 

campus who are students of other branch and campus. 

5) Despite the submission of Status Report, there are still students who 
were already graduates and some were not enrolled, but still they 

appeared in the official list sent by CHED UniFAST. 

 

12.24. The Program Registry in the TES Portal is not updated despite the request of 
PUP dated August 1, 2019. The request for the updating of the Registry was 

sent thru email with supporting documents for the approval of each program 

offered by PUP. This resulted to adjusting the program of the applicants to 

the nearest related program in the TES Portal. At present, SFAS is preparing 

another request to update the Program Registry in TES Portal in preparation 

for the application of students for SY 2021-2022. Letters had been sent to 

PUP Vice President for Branches and Satellite Campuses to coordinate with 

Scholarship Coordinators and to check the programs that are not listed in 

their portal. Complete list of academic programs of PUP branches and 

campuses was also provided by the Quality Assurance Center which will be 

submitted to CHED UniFAST. 

 

12.25. The announcement for the submission of LR was properly coordinated with 
the PUP branches and campuses. However, there are grantees with closed 

accounts resulting to the delay of liquidation because they still need to open 

a new LandBank ATM account where funds will be credited. 

  



134 

 

12.26. The PUP Main was provided with copy of LR of branches and campuses 
with funds completely released to scholars. PUP Main Campus received on 

March 10, 2021 the notice that the check for TDP was ready for claiming. 

 

12.27. As soon as all funds have been released to TES grantees of PUP branches 
and campuses in NCR, the SFAS and Student Services Section – 

Accounting Department will prepare the liquidation of funds. 

 

12.28. As per Joint Memorandum Circular No. 4, series of 2020 on the Enhanced 
Guideline on the Tertiary Education Subsidy Program, section XVI. 

Liquidation of Funds Transferred to SUCs and CHED Recognized LUCs; 3) 

Any unused fund should be returned to CHED ROs together with the 

liquidation report. 

 

12.29. When all funds had been transferred to students‘ Landbank Account, the 
SFAS and Student Accounting will prepare the liquidation and submit the 

same to CHEDRO with the excess fund transfers. 

 

12.30. As per CHED requirement sent through email by CHED Regional Office 4 
for PUP branches and campuses in Region 4, which have full fund release to 

grantees, the liquidation requirements are: 

a. Payroll from Accounting (Use Blue Ink for Signature) 
b. Photocopy of Student Grantees‘ School ID with three specimen 

signatures (only school ID is allowed, and no other IDs. 

 

12.31. The SFAS is consolidating the copy of LR sent by branches and campuses 
in Region 4. The SFAS Chief will personally inquire about the liquidations 

by the different TES Programs. Upon receipt of the template for the letter of 

undertaking from University Legal Counsel Office, the SFAS will provide 

the copy to TES grantees to fill-out and require them to submit the necessary 

requirements for the liquidation of the fund.  

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

12.32. The actions cited by the Management with regard to the monitoring of the 
fund transfers have been well taken in the preparation of the AOM. 

Nonetheless, constant coordination is highly recommended in order to 

facilitate monitoring of the funds, and timely distribution among intended 

recipients. Moreover, Management shall consider opening of a specific bank 

account for transactions pertaining to the TES to aid the tracking of releases 

to PUP. Management through written representations or meetings for that 

matter shall request the CHED-UniFAST to update the Masterlist and/or 

Registry to show the correct information regarding the TES beneficiaries. 

  



135 

 

12.33. Also, as regards the submission of the LRs, Management shall disseminate 
the requirements to all PUP Branches, and enjoin all concerned to submit 

the documents required, together with the LRs. 

 

12.34. As to the other recommendations, compliance with thereto shall be 
evaluated once the pertinent documents and LRs have been submitted to the 

Audit Team. 

 

 

Utilization of Special Trust Fund (STF) 

 

13. Allocation, utilization and disbursements of Special Trust Fund (STF) totaling 
₱1,024,963,807.49 were not in accordance with CHED Memorandum Order 

(CMO) No. 20, series of 2011, and Section 4 (d) of RA No. 8292, due to: a) non-

compliance with the prescribed percentage rate of allocation and the limitation 

on adjustment/modification of the specific budget allocation; b) below 40 

percent utilization of funds for Instruction, Research Services, Extension 

Services, Administrative Services and Production; and c) unallocated actual 

collections and minimal utilization of Fiduciary Funds; thereby adversely 

affecting the effective and efficient delivery of programs, projects and activities 

consistent with the trifocal functions of the PUP, and the accumulation of 

unutilized cash balances maintained in the authorized government depository 

banks (AGDBs). 

 

13.1. Section 4 (d) of RA No. 8292 or the Higher Education Modernization Act of 
1997 provides in part that any income generated by the university or college 

from tuition fees and other charges, as well as from the operation of 

auxiliary services and land grants, shall be retained by the university or 

college, and may be disbursed by the Board of Regents/Trustees (BOR/T) 

for instruction, research, extension, or other programs/projects of the 

university or college: Provided, that all fiduciary fees shall be disbursed for 

the specific purposes for which they are collected.  

 

13.2. The same Section also states that if, for reason of control, the university or 
college, shall not be able to pursue any project for which the funds have 

been appropriated and allocated under its approved program of 

expenditures, the Board of Regents/Trustees (BOR/T) may authorize the use 

of said funds for any reasonable purpose which in its discretion, may be 

necessary and urgent for the attainment of the objectives and goals of the 

universities or college. 

 

13.3. CHED Memorandum Order (CMO) No. 20, Series of 2011 has been issued 
to establish and institutionalize uniform fiscal policies that will serve as 

guidelines in the use and disposition of all internally generated funds 

accruing to the State University/College (SUC), as well as to integrate a 

system of accountability for all fund administrators. It defines STF as 



136 

 

referring to the income of the SUC arising from collection of tuition fees, 

miscellaneous fees, service and other income, which is broken down into: 

 

a) Tuition fees for the use by the SUC in carrying out its trifocal function: 
instruction, research and extension, and production, as well as defray its 

administrative costs (general administrative support); 

b) Fiduciary Fund; 
c) Revenues collected by self-liquidating units; 
d) Revenues generated by IGUs; 
e) Regular Trust Fund without separate depository account (NSTP, ROTC, 

NEDA, DOST Funding, or other NGA Funding for the implementation 

of projects through the State College). 

 

13.4. Likewise, it provides for specific budget allocations for various functions 
that may be made by each responsible fund administrator after deduction of 

the SUC-wide common fund establishment of benchmark data to the 

different thrust, program or activity of the agency on Instruction, Research 

Services, Extension Services, Administrative Services, Production and 

Mandatory Reserves. 

 

13.5. Section 24 thereof states that the budget authorized by the BOR shall be 
implemented within the CY for which it was formulated. The inclusive 

collection period and the Quarter for which the collection will be used shall 

be clearly and specifically stated. The BOR regularly meets only once every 

quarter, and is allowed to conduct special meetings whenever necessary. 

Therefore, a reasonable scheme must be resorted to in order to abide by 

COA Circular No. 2000-002 dated April 4, 2000, which requires board 

approval for the use of income, while aligning the financial operations and 

transactions with the financial cycle which abides by a January to December 

or the CY period. 

 

13.6. Consistent with Section 4(d) of RA No. 8292, the PUP maintains the STF or 
Fund 164 with the LBP, G. Araneta Branch, and Scholarship Fund under 

DBP, Buendia Ave., Pasay Branch, to which collections of income are being 

deposited.  Details are as follows:

13.7. On December 4, 2019, the BOR approved the PUP‘s Program of Receipts 
and Expenditures (PRE) for CY 2020 amounting to ₱725,268,024.00 for 

Personnel Services (PS), Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses 

(MOOE), Capital Outlays (CO), Fiduciary fees, extension and research 

programs, which are based on the Projected Income for CY 2019 as 

determined by the Accounting Department amounting to ₱694,505,024.00 

plus the carried over balance from CY 2019 amounting to ₱30,763,000.00. 

This has been revised to conform with the total actual income collections for 

CY 2020 amounting to ₱1,024,963,807.49.00, approved by the BOR on 

January 25, 2021. 

 

13.8. An evaluation of the submitted approved PRE and the corresponding 
utilization reports disclosed the following deficiencies: 

 

a. Non-compliance with the prescribed percentage rates of allocation and the 
limitation on adjustment/modification of the specific budget allocation. 

 

13.9. Article III of the CMO No. 20, particularly Sections 6 to 17 thereof, 
provides for the specific budget allocations, after deduction of the SUC-

wide Common Fund, and the corresponding limitations on the adjustment or 

modification of percentage allocation on the thrusts, programs, and activities 

of the University, as summarized in the succeeding table:

recurring observation, but is not yet fully addressed by the PUP. A

13.11. It can be inferred from the foregoing table that for CY 2020, the PUP has 
allocated only 71.53 percent of the total Tuition, Miscellaneous and Other 

Fees, after deduction of the SUC-wide Common Fund, pursuant to Article 

III of the CMO No. 20, equivalent to ₱590,656,740.00, for its thrusts, 

programs, and activities. Likewise, it may be noted that the following 

deviations were committed in the allocation of the STF Budget for CY 

2020: 

 

a. Faculty and Staff Development, and Facilities Development under 
Instruction were prioritized for CY 2020, as evidenced by their 

allocations being more than the required allocation under CMO No. 20, 

by 11.67 percent and 16.04 percent respectively. These in effect, 

affected the allocations for Curriculum Development and Student 

Development which were short by 10.87 percent and 8.97 percent, 

respectively, compared to the required allocation of 12.50 percent, 

contrary to Section 7 of the said CMO which prescribes that the 

adjustment resulting in the reduction in the allocation of one or more 

component shall not fall below 7.5 percent in order not to unduly curtail 

the developmental goals and regular operations therein. 

 

b. The PUP has allocated 3.09 percent or ₱25,495,000.00 out of the total 
amount of ₱825,791,591.67 for Research Services which is the second 

major function of the SUC, which is 6.91 percent below the fixed rate of 

10 percent as required under the CMO No. 20. This is contrary to 

Section 9 of the same CMO which prescribes that said fixed rate shall 

not be modified or reduced in order to ensure the accomplishment of 



142 

 

research activities or undertaking that is geared towards producing 

research outputs that are expected to be beneficial for the development 

of the community or locality where the SUC is located. 

 

c. Extension Services, being the third major function of the SUC, shall be 
allocated with 10 percent of the budget, which shall be intended for the 

dissemination of the research output for the use of the community or 

locality in which the SUC is located. This requirement under the CMO 

No. 20, notwithstanding, the PUP allocated only 1.09 percent or 

₱8,971,000.00, which is 8.91 percent below the fixed 10 percent rate 

prescribed under Sections 10 and 11 thereof, thus, affecting the effective 

delivery of programs involving technology transfer of research outputs 

to the community or locality in which the SUC is located. 

 

d. The same is true for Administrative Services, which the CMO No. 20 
likewise requires that the budget allocation shall be fixed at 10 percent. 

Modification resulting in reduction of the percentage shall not be 

allowed as per Section 15 thereof. However, the PUP has allocated 8.58 

percent, short by 1.42 percent. 

 

e. Allocations for Production and Mandatory Reserve which allocations are 
pegged at 10 percent each, permit modification subject to a written 

justification and/or approval of the governing board. PUP only allocated 

0.90 percent for Mandatory Reserve, while none was allocated for 

Production. However, no written justification and/or approval by the 

Board of Regents were submitted to support the modification. These 

affected the effective delivery of programs involving investment outlay, 

as well as the contingency fund intended to meet any unexpected event 

which may adversely affect the institution and its operations.  

 

b. Low Utilization Rate of the STF for CY 2020 
 

13.12. The STF Program of Receipts and Expenditures and the corresponding 
Utilization Report for CY 2020, exhibited the following:

GRAND TOTAL 1,024,963,807.49  (129,905,516.72) 895,058,290.77  209,956,969.36 685,101,321.41 23.46 

 

13.13. The foregoing table shows that the approved PRE totaling 
₱1,024,963,807.49 was adjusted to ₱895,058,290.77. Of the total adjusted 

amount, only ₱209,956,969.36 was utilized, posting an over-all utilization 

rate of 23.46 percent, leaving a total amount of ₱685,101,321.41 unutilized. 

This implies that programs, project and activities intended for CY 2020 

were not implemented, contrary to Section 24 of the CMO No. 20 which 

states in part: 

 

Implementation of the Budget. Budget authorized by the BOR/T 

shall be implemented within the Calendar Year for which it was 

formulated. The inclusive collection period and the Quarter for 

which the collection will be used shall be clearly and specifically 

stated.  

 

13.14. Moreover, as disclosed in the table above, the budget allocations for each 
thrust/program/activity of the PUP were utilized below 40 percent, except 

for the Mandatory Reserve where utilization exceeded the amount budgeted. 

Underutilization may be justified by the fact that the country has been 

placed in succeeding lockdowns in CY 2020, however, the PUP was not 

prevented to request for realignment of funds to meet pressing needs of the 

stakeholders of the University, and revise plans in order to maximize the 

utilization of the amount budgeted. Moreover, no BOR approval was 

submitted to the Audit Team to justify such over-spending in the Mandatory 

Reserves intended to meet contingencies. This could have been prevented 

should the Management allocated more for Mandatory Reserve as discussed 

in the previous paragraphs. 

 

13.15. Moreover, analysis of the PRE revealed that a total of ₱19,536,000.00 of the 
total budget allocation for Facilities Development represents allocation for 

GSIS Condotel amortizations with zero utilization due to the Notice of 

Suspension issued in CY 2015 which prompted the PUP to suspend 

subsequent payments to the GSIS. Provisions for the construction and 

improvement of school and office buildings and facilities in various 

campuses, as well as for procurement of Office Equipment and Other PPEs 

were included, however, only ₱40,290,779.21 out of the total budget of 

₱235,676,329.00 or 17.10 percent was utilized, thus the programmed 



144 

 

projects for improvement of the physical facilities of University campuses 

that would contribute to the delivery of effective curricular and extra-

curricular services to the general student population, as well as the objective 

of each program were not fully attained.  

 

c. Unallocated actual collections and minimal utilization of Fiduciary Funds  
 

13.16. Fees assessed and collected from students intended for specific purpose such 
as cultural fees, medical/dental fees, sports development fees, laboratory 

fees, library fees, guidance fees, and IT fees accrue to the Fiduciary Fees. As 

defined in the CMO, this fund shall be used solely for the purpose for which 

it was authorized to be collected. The listing of what is classified as 

Fiduciary Fund, as well as the College, Office, or Unit accountable for its 

utilization shall be stated in the Report of Collections which is submitted to 

the BOR for approval. 

 

13.17. For CY 2020, actual collections of Fiduciary Fees totaled ₱75,925,165.05 as 
reported in the Report of Income prepared by the Accounting Office for the 

CY ended December 31, 2020. Details are as follows: 

 

Table 52: Collections of Fiduciary Fees CY 2020

Information Technology Development Fee 2,269,221.50  

Guidance Fee 9,265,800.78  

Total 75,925,165.05  

 

13.18. However, the PRE submitted by the Budget Office, and approved by the 
BOR contained a total amount of ₱178,825,500.00 for the Fiduciary Fees, 

which only contained ₱35,438,000.00 pertaining to the abovementioned 

items, while including budget allocation for NSTP Activity, Student 

Seminars and Student Field Trips for ₱22,440,000.00, ₱29,500,000.00, and 

₱91,447,500.00, respectively. Having been assessed and collected from the 

students, these fiduciary fees should have been allocated and disbursed in 

the current year for their intended purpose, consistent with Section 4 (d) of 

RA No. 8292. 

 

13.19. Out of the approved adjusted budget for Fiduciary Fund of 
₱181,154,500.00, only ₱4,455,732.12 or 2.46 percent was utilized, thus 

leaving a balance of ₱176,698,767.88, equivalent to 97.54 percent unutilized 



145 

 

amount. Details from the reports generated by the Budget Office are as

13.20. The unutilized balance ₱176,698,767.88 or 97.54 percent implied that the 
Management did not ensure effective delivery of services to its students 

from collected fiduciary fees, hence   resulting in huge amounts maintained 

in the AGDB by the PUP due to the accumulation of unutilized balances. 

This was likewise contrary to Section 24, of CMO. 20, series of 2011 which 

states that the budget authorized by the BOR shall be implemented within 

the CY for which it was formulated. 

 

13.21. We recommended that Management: 
 

a. comply with the required percentage of allocation and/or limitations 
on adjustment or modification prescribed under CMO No. 20, series 

of 2011 in the succeeding Academic Years (AY), and submit 

appropriate justifications and/or Board Resolutions on the 

deviations in allotment on specific thrust, programs/activities of the 

PUP; 

 

b. make a representation with the CHED on the proposed modification 
of the said CMO pursuant to Section 35 thereof, and furnish the 

Office of the Auditor with a copy thereof; 

 

c. observe set timelines in the implementation and completion of 
plans/programs and activities to ensure effective delivery of services 

and to address the needs of the students and other stakeholders, 

pursuant to Section 24 of the CMO or request for realignment of the 

budget, as appropriate;  



146 

 

d. maximize the utilization of the STF and Fiduciary Fund, as 
budgeted,  to ensure accomplishment of the PUP’s trifocal functions 

of instruction, research and extension services, production and 

administrative services, as well as the intended purposes for which 

the fiduciary fees are collected; and 

 

e. submit justification on the non-allocation of actual collections of 
fiduciary fees, and consider assessing possible reductions on 

fiduciary fees, where appropriate. 

 

Management Comments: 

 

13.22. PUP submits for approval of the Board, the Program of Receipts and 
Expenditures (PRE) which includes all the proposed expenditures for the 

Year. The Board approved it during the First quarter BOR meeting. For 

2020, the University allotted the largest portion to Instruction (Faculty and 

Staff Development) to pay the honoraria for teaching overload of full-time 

faculty members and wages for the part-timers as the budget from the 

General Fund amounting to ₱74,300,000.00 is deficient.  

 

13.23. Moreover, per the General Appropriations Act (GAA) for FY 2020, the 
University was only provided with two (2) capital projects, a ₱60M project 

for the Repair, rehabilitation of Hasmin Hostel Building, M.H. Del Pilar 

Campus, and a ₱20M Congressional Initiative (CI) under the For Later 

Release (FLR), for the construction/ repair/rehabilitation of Multi-Purpose 

Sports Facility,  hence the PUP made provision for priority infra projects in 

the FY 2020 STF Program of Receipts and Expenditures (PRE).  

 

13.24. However, these two GAA projects were discontinued in FY 2020 to comply 
with the provisions of NBC No. 580, otherwise known as Adoption of 

Economy Measures in the Government due to the Emergency Health 

Situation. 

 

13.25. Moreover, PUP already made representation to CHED and included the 
proposed amendment of CMO No. 20, Series of 2011 or the Policies and 

Guidelines for the Use of Income, Special Trust Fund and Programs of 

Receipts and Expenditures of the SUCs  in the proposed revised IRR of RA 

No. 8292, particularly Section 18 (D) of the IRR.  

 

13.26. PUP stressed that the strict imposition of percentage allocation creates a 
burden on the part of the University because it is not always aligned with the 

needs and priorities of the institution, not to mention that the perceived 

failure to comply with this breakdown has become a recurring observation 

of the Commission on Audit. The CMO provides that the specific 

percentage allocation for each program may be modified based on the 

expenditure trends of the previous year, the Management find it more 



147 

 

efficient if the PUP governing board will be given the authority to allocate 

funds based on the annual requirements and priorities of the university.  

 

13.27. This proposal does not deviate from Section 18 (D) of the IRR which states 
that, ―If, for reasons beyond its control, the university or college shall not be 

able to pursue any project for which funds have been appropriated and 

allocated under its approved program of expenditures, its GB may authorize 

the use of said funds for any reasonable purpose which, in its discretion, 

may be necessary and urgent for the attainment of the objectives and goals 

of the university or college.” 

 

13.28. The FY 2020 STF PRE is a budget program which fully considered the 
programs, activities and projects for the year, unfortunately, due to 

uncontrollable circumstances such the challenges brought about by the 

COVID19 Pandemic resulted in delays in the procurement process and low 

budget utilization of the allotted budget for research, extension, training/ 

staff development of some sectors, etc. The balances were re-programmed 

for utilization in 2021 and were duly approved by the BOR per Board 

Referendum No. 58, series of 2021.  

 

13.29. Moreover, the BOR-Approved FY 2020 STF was prepared based on 
estimates and the excess income over the estimates forms part of the 

Unprogrammed Income for Fiscal Year 2020 and is carried over to FY 2021 

as adjustments to the 2021 Fiduciary Fund.  

 

13.30. The implementation and completion of various plans/programs and 
activities were hindered by various difficulties and concerns, to wit: 

 

a. Medical Services Department – Non-utilization of ₱2,837,549.98 was 
caused by the limitations brought by the COVID-19 Pandemic. Only the 

postpaid plan for two units assigned at the Medical Clinic, for 

emergency use and some medicines were received in 2020 because of 

the COVID-19 Pandemic. Due to urgent reasons and pursuant to 

―Bayanihan to Heal as One Act‖, COVID-19 related equipment, 

medicines, and supplies were prioritized. Further, by reason of the 

immediate suspension of face-to-face classes, there was a decrease in the 

demand and consumption of medicine, and the MSD opted to taper its 

requests in the number of medicines, considering their expiration dates. 

 

b. Ninoy Aquino Library and Learning Resource Center – Non-utilization 
of the Library Fiduciary Fund amounting to ₱4,727,000.00 was due to 

the disruptions brought about by the COVID-19 Pandemic. The library 

solicits most of its books to be acquired for a specific fiscal year from 

the stakeholders, particularly from the faculty members, colleges, 

departments, campuses, and branches. The Library did not receive any 

request for titles of books to be purchased, as faculty members conduct 



148 

 

their classes on-line where physical books are not required. Further, lack 

of requests for purchase was probably brought by a sudden drop of the 

number of physical library users. 

 

c. National Service Training Program Office (NSTPO) – The NSTPO 
failed to implement projects during the time of the Pandemic as there 

was no face-to-face classes conducted. NSTP activities for students like 

DRR trainings, outreach and immersion activities, ROTC development 

programs, CWTS development programs and other relevant activities 

were restricted by the COVID-19 Pandemic from utilizing their budget. 

 

d. Office of Counseling and Psychological Services (OCPS) – Due to the 
COVID-19 Pandemic, the Office failed to implement certain 

projects/programs/activities, while some of the trainings/seminars did 

not push through. 

 

e. Office of the Vice President for Research, Extension and Development 
(OVPRED) – On the budget allocation for research program, intended 

research programs during the Fiscal Year 2020 were not implemented 

due to COVID-19 situation. The fund allocation for the Thesis and 

Dissertation Grants, Publication Incentive, and Citation Incentive were 

not fully utilized due to limited submission of requests from the faculty 

members/researchers. The granting of Paper Presentation Financial 

Assistance was suspended by virtue of Memorandum Order No. 16, 

series of 2020, or the Revised Implementing Guidelines on 

International/National Paper Presentations in compliance with the 

COVID-19 CHED Advisory. Subscription to Citation Index with 

allotted budget of ₱3,610,000.00 was not fully realized in FY 2020. 

Moreover, the implementation of extension programs, projects and 

activities of the University was immensely affected by the pandemic as 

quarantine and travel restrictions were placed. Considerable number of 

approved job-related and highly specialized trainings/seminars/fora to be 

attended by faculty members and administrative employees were not 

pursued due to IATF prohibitions. Faculty members and employees 

attended webinars and online trainings/seminars which were offered for 

free due to the pandemic, thus a fraction of allotted budget was not 

utilized. 

 

f. Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs and Services (OVPSAS) – 
The amount intended for student seminars and student field trips have 

been unused since the activities with which the said funding shall be 

used have been temporarily banned by the IATF since the onset of the 

pandemic. Virtual seminars and trainings participated by students were 

mostly free of charge. Due to the implementation of the ECQ, only 

₱690,399.25 was utilized for Student Wages that covered January until 

March 15, 2020. Funding of Award, Rewards and Prizes was 



149 

 

underutilized as the amount intended for the awarding outstanding 

licensure performance and contests outside the University were not 

given as these activities were cancelled or postponed due to the 

pandemic. Funds pertaining to Student Development were not fully 

utilized, as the conduct of activities was limited and done through 

webinars only. The printing of the Student Handbook was not done in 

2020, instead, its softcopy was posted in the University website for easy 

access of the students and other stakeholders, as on-line and 

correspondence mode of learning was implemented. Only ₱88,501.30 

was utilized for ―Rent‖ by reason of quarantine and travel restrictions 

implemented by the IATF. Thus, the University decided to conduct 

online graduation. Also, the procurement process of the Student 

Insurance was suspended due to the implementation of the ECQ. 

 

g. Physical Planning and Development Office (PPDO) – The project of the 
repair/rehabilitation of Electrical Service Entrance for P.E. Building, 

Security Office, Visitor‘s Lounge and UP Gym was submitted to the 

Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) on December 3, 2020. The project 

entitled Conversion of West Wing Storage Room to Comfort Rooms 

(Male and Female) from 2
nd

 to 6
th

 floor and Repair of Ground Floor 

Comfort Rooms was submitted to BAC on February 2, 2021. The project 

Construction of Ground Entrance Canopy and Public Assistance and 

Complaint Desk was submitted to BAC on January 22, 2021. The 

project Repair/Rehabilitation of South Wing Building (Roofing, Steel 

Fire Exit, Waterproofing, Painting and Upgrading of Elevator) was 

submitted to the BAC on March 10, 2021. The project 

Repair/Rehabilitation of Main Water Supply Lines at A. Mabini 

Campus, Sta. Mesa, Manila (Phase I) was submitted to BAC on March 

11, 2021, due to the updating of bid documents. For the project entitled 

Repair/Rehabilitation of Hasmin Hostel, the Office is currently 

preparing the detail cost estimate and other bidding documents. For the 

project Repair/Rehabilitation of the Electrical System – East Wing, 

Main Building, the Office is presently in discussion with the Facilities 

and Management Office (FaMO) for the scope of works. For the project 

Repair/Rehabilitation of NALLRC Building (Roofing, Steel Fire Exit, 

Waterproofing, Painting and Upgrading of Elevator), the Office is 

presently preparing the detail cost estimate and other bidding 

documents. The projects of the Office were substantially halted due to 

the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, where the IATF imposed strict 

quarantine rules and travel restrictions. 

 

h. Quality Assurance Center (QAC) – Unutilized budget for CY 2020 
amounted to ₱12,232,477.00. With the unexpected turn of events as a 

result of the COVID-19 pandemic, almost all Quality Assurance 

Activities were either cancelled or postponed. It was only on August 

2020 when the Accrediting Agency of Chartered Colleges and 



150 

 

Universities of the Philippines (AACCUP), Inc. decided to push through 

with the accreditation visits using the online platform. A total of 18 

programs out of the proposed 33 programs based on the 2020 budget 

were accommodated and visited by the AACCUP between October to 

December 2020. With the shift to online accreditation system, the 

budget for accommodation, food, and other related expenses for physical 

visits were not utilized. The following applications were 

postponed/cancelled: 1) Certificate of Program Compliance (COPC); 2) 

Institutional Accreditation; 3) Institutional Sustainability Assessment; 4) 

Center for Development and Center for Excellence; 5) Asia Pacific 

Accreditation and Certification Commission for Diploma Courses in the 

Institute of Technology; and 6) Accreditation Board for Engineering 

Technology. 

 

i. Sports Development Program Office (SDPO) – Unutilized budget for 
CY 2020 totaled ₱12,755,500 due to the cancellation and stoppage of all 

sporting activities/events throughout the country brought by the outbreak 

of the COVID-19. The Office opted to realign the said fiduciary fund to 

a more useful project which would benefit the University to provide and 

improve existing sports facilities.  

 

j. University Center for Culture and the Arts (UCCA) – Posted unutilized 
Cultural Fiduciary Fund for CY 2020 amounting to ₱714,000.00, which 

was intended for the expenses to be incurred in the conduct of Annual 

Cultural Festival, both in the regional and national levels, but were not 

materialized because of the pandemic. 

 

13.31. On the observation of over-spending in the Mandatory Reserve, please note 
that the FY 2020 Mandatory Reserve was un-utilized. The utilization that is 

being referred to in the AOM is the utilization for Terminal Leave Benefits. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

13.32. It is acknowledged that the PRE submitted by the Management was 
approved by the Board. However, it specified in the CHED CMO, 

specifically on the provisions on the limitations on the adjustment or 

modification that the budget allocations are mandatory, subject only to 

modifications as allowed therein. Nonetheless, it is encouraged that the 

Management, together with other SUCS, shall push through in submitting 

proposals for modification of the decade-old CHED Memorandum, to make 

it at par with the needs of each institution. 

 

13.33. The Office has received the position paper of the PUP on the proposed 
amendments/ modifications of the CMO. It is requested that the 

Management submit updates on the progress of the proposal. 

 



151 

 

13.34. It is also acknowledged that the implementation of the programs, projects 
and activities, and the eventual utilization of the STF Budget were hindered 

by the COVID 19 Pandemic, which is beyond the control of the 

Management. However, as stated in the AOM, Management could have 

requested for realignment of funds to meet pressing needs of the 

stakeholders of the University, and revise plans in order to maximize the 

utilization of the amount budgeted. 

 

13.35. As provided in the Utilization Report submitted by the Budget Office, the 
utilization for Mandatory Reserves was more than the amount budgeted as 

reflected in the AOM. It is recommended that Management submit the 

revised Utilization Report, if any, or document showing that the amount 

reported as the utilized Mandatory Reserve was for Terminal Leave 

Benefits. 

 

 

Internal Audit Office Structure 

 

14. The Internal Audit Office of the PUP did not comply with the pertinent 
provisions of Administrative Order (AO) No. 278, s. 1992, AO No. 70, s. 2003, 

the Revised Philippine Government Internal Audit Manual (PGIAM), and 

related issuances adopting the Internal Auditing Standards for the Philippine 

Public Sector (IASPPS) and Internal Control Standards for the Philippine 

Public Sector (ICSPPS) issued for all government agencies, due to:  

a) performance of functions beyond the IAO’s supposed duties and 

responsibilities; b) lack of manpower; and c) the designated head of the IAO 

not directly reporting to the Governing Board (GB) or Audit Committee 

(AuditCom), thereby affecting the effective discharge of its mandated 

functions. 

 

14.1. The creation of Internal Audit Service (IAS) was initially mandated through 
the promulgation of Republic Act (RA) No. 3456 or the Internal Auditing 

Act of 1962, and later amended by RA No. 4177. Section 2 of RA No. 4177 

provides that IAS shall be created, organized and operated in all branches, 

subdivisions and instrumentalities of the government, including 

government-owned and/or controlled corporations which shall assist 

management to achieve an efficient and effective fiscal administration and 

performance of agency affairs and functions. 

 

14.2. Sections 1 of Administrative Order (AO) No. 278, s.1992 and AO No. 70, s. 
2003, dated April 28, 1992 and April 14, 2003, respectively, require all 

heads of Government-Owned and/or -Controlled Corporations (GOCCs), 

including Government Financial Institutions (GFIs), SUCs and Local 

Government Units (LGUs), to organize an IAS in their respective offices. 

 



152 

 

14.3. Relative thereto, the DBM issued Circular Letter No. 2011-5 dated May 19, 
2011 directing heads of departments/agencies including GOCCs and GFIs to 

strengthen their Internal Control Systems (ICS). It promulgated the PGIAM 

as a way of strengthening the ICS which aims to assist government agencies 

and other instrumentalities in establishing and developing internal audit to 

promote effective, efficient, ethical and economical operations in 

government.  Based on the guidelines, the IAS/IAUs, which still performs 

non-internal audit functions and uses tools and techniques inconsistent with 

the PGIAM, are directed to immediately cease from performing non-IA 

related functions and using other tools and techniques. To effect major 

changes as response to the clarifications/issues concerning PGIAM, DBM 

issued Circular Letter No. 2020-8 dated May 26, 2020 regarding Revised 

PGIAM.  

 

14.4. Paragraph 5.7 of Chapter 1 of the Revised PGIAM states that: 
 

The IAS/IAU is not responsible for or required to participate in 

activities which are essentially part of the regular operating 

functions or the primary responsibility of another unit in the 

organization. These include management and process 

improvements of operating and support services systems, such as 

quality management, HRM, and financial management, which are 

the responsibilities of the operating and support services units 

concerned.   

 

The following examples of activities are considered as non-internal 

audit functions that should not be undertaken by the IAS/IAU:  

 

a. Conduct of internal quality audit as part of the ongoing 
implementation of the QMS;   

b. Participation in procurement procedures, including 
membership in the Bids and Awards Committee, its secretariat 

or technical working group;  

c. Preparation or review of draft policies, guidelines, standards or 
operating procedures of other offices;  

d. Review and certification of financial reports before approval 
by the agency head;  

e. Pre-audit of vouchers and counter-signature of checks;  
f. Inspection of deliveries, although the internal auditor may, as 

part of his examination, observe inspection;  

g. Preparation of treasury and bank reconciliation statements;  
h. Development and installation of systems and procedures, 

except in exceptional cases wherein the internal auditor may 

assist by way of giving suggestions;  

i. Conduct of physical inventories; and 
j. Maintenance of property records. 

  



153 

 

14.5. Moreover, paragraph 2(d), Chapter 3 of Revised PGIAM, states that ―for 
State Universities and Colleges (SUCs), the IAU shall report to the 

Governing Board (GB), which may also opt to organize an Audit Committee 

(AuditCom) from among its members to which the IAU shall report 

directly.‖ 

 

14.6. Further, Paragraph 5, Chapter 3, Organizing the Internal Audit of Revised 
PGIAM, prescribes that to be able to provide the services expected of the 

IAS/IAU, it is important that it has: 

 

a) An appropriate organizational structure;   
b) Access to sufficient human resources with the necessary skills and 

experience; and 

c) An adequate budget.   
 

14.7. It is likewise important that the IAS/IAU is well positioned within the 
organization. For SUCs, its IAU, the level of which shall depend on its 

levelling per DBM-Commission on Higher Education (CHED) Joint 

Circular (JC) No. 1, s. 2016, shall report to the AuditCom of the GB of the 

SUC, as shown below: 

 
Figure 2. Reporting Structure of IAU per DBM-CHED JC No. 1, s. 2016 

 

 

14.8. Pursuant to the Administrative Code of 1987, as amended, and as adopted 
by DBM CL No. 2008-5, s. 2008179, the IAS shall, “conduct management 

and operations performance audit of Department activities and units and 

determine the degree of compliance with established objectives, policies, 

methods and procedures, government regulations, and contractual 

obligations of the Department.” 

 

14.9. While it is the direct responsibility of the agency head to install, implement 
and monitor a sound system of internal control as stated in Section 124 of 

PD No. 1445, the IAS assists the agency head by conducting a separate 

evaluation of the ICS to determine if controls are well designed and properly 

implemented.  This function of the IAS is separate or distinct from the 



154 

 

function of the operating units and support units and their equivalent in 

GOCCs/GFIS, which monitor and institute continual improvement of 

internal control to support achievement of performance targets and 

organizational objectives.   

 

14.10. The Internal Audit Office (IAO) of the PUP was established under the 
Office of the President, upon the reinstatement of Dr. Nemesio E. Prudente 

as President in 1986 after the People Power Revolution in accordance with 

RA No. 3456, and as amended by RA No. 4177.  In the meantime, the IAO 

provided the history of their office as the PUP‘s Order for establishment 

cannot be found. 

 

14.11. Evaluation of the work/status of PUP IAO revealed the following: 
 

A. Performance of non-internal audit related functions  
 

14.12. Upon inquiry, the Audit Team found out that the IAO performs functions, 
such as but not limited to: inspection of emergency purchases, assist in the 

preparation of financial reports of University Canteen, inspection of 

liquidation/ reimbursement report on cash advances which falls under non-

internal audit related functions which are beyond their duties and 

responsibilities as provided in the Revised PGIAM.  Since the functions of 

the IAO are separate from those of the other operating units of the 

University, it should not be required to participate in the regular operating 

activities already performed by a particular unit. The pre-audit of financial 

transactions is an essential and primary responsibility lodged with the 

Accounting Office during the withdrawal of pre-audit by the Commission 

on Audit per COA Circular No. 2011-002 dated July 22, 2011. 

 

14.13. Relatively, PUP informed the Audit Team that a PUP Order from the Office 
of the President is in the process of finalization where inspection of 

documents by the IAO will take place after the checking and recording in 

the Accounting Department.  

 

B. Lack of manpower and Qualification of the employees 
 

14.14. Out of 14 plantilla positions in the IAO, as provided by the Human 
Resource Management Department (HRMD), seven (7) are vacant.  The 

seven (7) filled up positions are composed of five (5) designated employees, 

one (1) permanent and one (1) casual. It can be gleaned from current 

staffing of the IAO that it lacks manpower, considering the fact that the 

functions of the IAO are broad as these encompass all matters relating to 

operations and management control. As required under revised PGIAM, the 

IAO must have access to sufficient human resources with the necessary 

skills and experiences. Moreover, the Office must be manned by adequate 



155 

 

number of staff equipped with internal audit background, experience and 

competencies to handle the demands and complexity of the workload. 

 

C. Organization Structure of IAO not compliant with the revised PGIAM 
 

14.15. Based on the current organizational structure of IAO, the head of IAO is 
directly reporting to the Executive Vice President, thus not compliant with 

the organization structure as per revised PGIAM, where the IAU shall report 

to the GB, which may also opt to organize an AuditCom from among its 

members, to which the IAU shall report directly. 

 

14.16. Moreover, the current organizational structure of IAO, is composed of three 
(3) units such as Inspection Management Unit, Operations Management 

Unit/ Branches and Campuses Unit and Financial Management Unit, thus, 

not pursuant to the Administrative Code of 1987, as amended, and as 

adopted by DBM CL No. 2008-5, s. 2008, where the IAS shall “conduct 

management and operations performance audit of Department activities and 

units and determine the degree of compliance with established objectives, 

policies, methods and procedures, government regulations, and contractual 

obligations of the Department.”  

 

14.17. It can be observed that IAS should have already been shaped by the above 
cited laws, rules, regulations, and standards which showed that the genuine 

intentions of these issuances are to deliver and promote quality public 

services in an efficient and effective manner. Moreover, a systematic and 

well-designed internal control system will be necessary for smooth-running 

and streamlined operations. To conclude, it is the direct responsibility of the 

Agency Head to install, implement and monitor a sound system of internal 

control as stated in Section 124 of PD No. 1445, and it is the IAS which will 

assist the Agency Had in conducting a separate evaluation of the ICS to 

determine if controls are well designed and properly implemented. 

 

14.18. We recommended that Management: 
 

a. refrain from doing non-internal functions which fall under the 
enumerated operational functions of the agency and appropriately 

align and define the functions and responsibilities of the IAO in 

conformity with AO No. 278, s. 2002, AO No. 70, s. 2003 IASPPS, 

ICSPPS, Revised PGIAM and pertinent rules and regulations; 

 

b. fill up the vacant positions and revisit the minimum qualifications as 
provided in the Annex B of Revised PGIAM and pertinent rules and 

regulations; and 

 

c. review the current IAO Organizational Structure to resolve the 
issue that it needs to be under the direct supervision of Governing 



156 

 

Board or Audit Committee, composing of management and 

operations audit department, in compliance with the Section 3 of RA 

No. 4177, Administrative Code of 1987 and Revised PGIAM. 

 

14.19. To address the deficiencies indicated in the issued Memorandum, the 
following are the plan of action that the management will implement: 

 

a. A Technical Working Committee (TWC) will be created to: 1) study 
which among the various non-internal audit functions and processes 

currently being executed by the IAO are to be transferred to other 

offices; and 2) review the current manpower compliment of IAO and 

provide guidelines on the qualifications of future IAO personnel based 

on Annex B of the revised PGIAM, and other pertinent rules and 

regulations (n.b. the removal of certain non-internal audit functions from 

IAO has started with the release of : EO No. 20, s.2021: Revised 

Guidelines on the Grant, Utilization and Liquidation of Cash Advances 

issued to and Reimbursement of Expenses made by AOs. 

 

b. The University Legal Counsel Office (ULCO) together with the Human 
Resource Management Department (HRDM) will review and study the 

recommendation of changing the reporting and organizational structure 

of IAO in compliance with Section 3 of RA No. 4177, Administrative 

Code of 1987 and revised PGIAM. 

 

The deliveries of both TWC and ULCO are expected to be realized 

within the year and will be properly coordinated to the Office of the 

Resident Auditor. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

14.20. The Progress and Execution Report regarding the mentioned plans shall be 
reviewed and validated once final outputs are submitted to the Audit Team. 

Moreover, it is requested that a copy of EO No. 20, s.2021: Revised 

Guidelines on the Grant, Utilization and Liquidation of Cash Advances 

issued to and Reimbursement of Expenses made by AOs be submitted to the 

Audit Team as basis for evaluation of compliance. 

 

 

Assessment of Internal Control System 

 

15. The PUP has installed adequate Internal Control System (ICS) for CY 2020, 
except for the following: a) non-provision of contingency and continuity plan; 

b) insufficient risk mitigation or controls, and risk communication and 

monitoring for the identified risks; c) incomplete proof  of proper 

implementation and monitoring; and d) unavailability of supporting 

documents to substantiate compliance with the Internal Control Component 



157 

 

(ICC), contrary to the ICSPPS under COA Resolution No. 2018-007 dated 

February 01, 2018 which resulted in ineffective, inefficient and recurring 

issues, risk or problems within the agency’s operations. 

 

15.1. The Commission on Audit (COA), the entity responsible for the 
promulgation and enforcement of general policies, rules and regulations on 

internal auditing, and in conformity with the aforesaid pertinent issuances, 

resolved to adopt the Philippine Internal Auditing and Philippine Internal 

Control Frameworks for Public Sector per COA Resolution No. 2016-016 

dated September 30, 2016 aimed to provide authoritative guidelines for the 

professional practice of internal auditing. Thereafter, COA Resolution No. 

2018-007 dated February 1, 2018 was issued for the adoption of the IASPPS 

and ICSPPS, providing the criteria for establishing, implementing, 

monitoring and evaluating internal control in government offices. 

 

15.2. As defined in the IASPPS and ICSPPS Manuals, the IAS shall provide an 
independent, objective assurance and advisory services designed to add 

value and improve the agency's operations and help the agency to 

accomplish its objectives by bringing a systematic, disciplined approach to 

evaluate and improve the effectiveness of governance, risk management and 

control processes. A good internal control on the operations, reporting and 

compliance areas of the agency's operations will safeguard its resources 

against loss, misuse, waste, abuse, mismanagement, errors, irregularities and 

fraud. 

 

15.3. Summary of the evaluation of the Agency‘s Level Control Checklist of the 
PUP for CY 2020 revealed the following: 

 

A. Control Environment 
 

15.4. The PUP has 2017 Revised University Code, an updated version of the 
original Code drafted in the 1970s containing the standard, policies, and 

processes that protect the welfare of all members of the PUP Community, 

which was uploaded in the PUP Website, and has developed a Quality 

Policy Statement (QPS) detailing the commitment of the PUP to provide 

inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning 

opportunities for human advancement and social transformation through re-

engineered polytechnic academic programs, which has been communicated 

to the entire PUP Community through Office Memorandum dated 

November 5, 2018. In CY 2020, the PUP updated its QPS and disseminated 

it through the Academic Council Meeting and Employees Dialogue dated 

April 15, 2020. Likewise, the Management consistently disseminates the 

importance of high ethics and controls through issued office memoranda and 

meetings; 

  



158 

 

15.5. The Management experimented on programs which may encourage and 
motivate the employees in performing their duties and responsibilities. They 

have properly designated the responsibilities of each department for the 

agency's operations as enumerated in the 2017 Revised University Code; 

 

15.6. No copy of contingency and continuity plans was provided, implying that 
there could be possible interruptions during employee turn-over, and lapses 

on the process of controls might be encountered; 

 

15.7. The Management uses different platforms including the PUP website, 
seminars, office memorandums, social network, etc. in order to inform all 

employees of its mission, goals, and objectives. To encourage every 

employee to strive better and do their jobs with quality, the PUP had 

established the policies on promotion such as: Promotion by Research, 

Promotion by Publication, Guidelines on Selection and Promotion, PASUC 

NBC461, CSC Memorandum on Recruitment for Faculty Positions.   

 

B. Risk Assessment 
 

15.8. In CY 2018, the Management had developed Risk Management Handbook, 
containing the Risk Identification, Risk Assessment, Risk Mitigation and 

Risk Communication & Monitoring, which was adopted up to this year. In 

the Risk Register for CY 2020, the Management was able to identify risk 

statements under operational, compliance, financial, strategic and 

reputational risk area, however, majority of the identified risk has no 

equivalent possible control and it lacks information about risk 

communication and monitoring. Thus, the objective of eliminating or 

mitigating possible risk which affects the agency‘s operation may not be 

successful and the process of identifying risk assessment might be useless, if 

corrective actions or controls were not properly implemented and 

monitored. 

 

C. Control Activities 
 

15.9. The Management has designed various in-house Information and 
Communication Technology (ICT) processes that ensure the quality, 

expedient and accurate information processing such as Student Information 

Systems and the Human Resource Information Systems. According to the 

Management, they will conduct a meeting with all the offices/ departments 

on the updating and finalizing of the process flows which will fit the need of 

each office. Notably, the PUP is ISO 9001:2005 certified implying that it 

has defined and followed a quality management system that is both 

appropriate and effective, and has identified areas for improvement and take 

action toward those improvements. However, as regards its implementation 
and proper monitoring, there were no proofs or supporting documentations 

submitted that adequately substantiate such claim.    

https://www.meadmetals.com/blog/metal-product-quality-is-our-1-priority


159 

 

D. Information and Communication 
 

15.10. Policies regarding information and communication were established by the 
agency which comprehensively covered the minimum requirements for 

agency level controls, as shown by the following: 

 

a. Creating a Financial Management Information; 
b. Issuing Memoranda regularly; 
c. Having Communication Tracking System; 
d. Procurement Module; 
e. Posting in PUP website; 
f. Posting in bulletin boards; and 
g. Email, chats, or messages 

 

E. Monitoring 
  

15.11. Management subjects itself to external evaluations, such as the one 
conducted by the Commission on Audit (COA) and International 

Organization for Standardization (ISO).  Further, the Management was kept 

informed and updated through periodic reports on the status of audit, and 

has reviewed resolutions through the Management Review and Management 

Committee meetings. Furthermore, the Management monitors performance 

of its employees through Office Performance Commitment Report (OPCR) 

and Individual Performance Commitment Report (IPCR) forms. However, 

with regard to the assessment of internal controls, the Internal Audit Office 

has not submitted any report as of date. 

 

15.12. Based on the Agency‘s Level Control Checklist for CY 2020, the 
Management provided sufficient information that substantiated 

Management‘s compliance with the given Internal Control Component 

under COA Resolution No. 2018-007 dated February 1, 2018, except on the 

following noted deficiencies:

Risk Assessment 

a. Management identifies the 
causes and sources of the risk 

(hazard in the context of 

physical harm), events, 

situations, or circumstances 

which can have a material 

impact upon objectives and 

the nature of that impact. 

Proof that Management 

identifies all risks that may occur 

(internal or external factors) at 

both the agency and activity 

levels in its risk registry 

following ISO 9001:2005 is 

hereby adopted. 

The Management was able to 

define risk, the risk areas, the 

PUP Risk Management 

Structure, the Risk Management 

Process and Sector Summary. 

However, the Management was 

not able to substantially 

elaborate the causes and sources 

of the said risk and their 

objective; thus, they may unable 

to properly allocate time or 

effort on where to give more 

focus.  

b. Management 
 identifies the likelihood 

of the risks happening and the 

impact or consequence when 

these happen. 

No supporting documents were 

submitted/ provided as proof of 

compliance with this Internal 

Control component. 

c. Management reviews the risk 
assessment and considers 

actions to mitigate the 

significant risks identified. 

d. Management
 considers the presence (or 

absence) and the 

effectiveness of any existing 

controls in determining the 

risk‘s consequences and 

probabilities. 

e. In establishing the 
external context, 

Management considers 

familiarization with the 

environment in which the 

agency and the system 

operates, including the 

following: 

 cultural, political, 
legal, regulatory, 

financial, economic, 

and competitive 

environment factors 

whether international, 

national, regional, or 

local;

 key drivers and trends 
having impact on the 

objectives of the 

agency; and 

 perceptions and values 
of external stakeholders. 

f. Internal audit service (or 
another group within the 

agency) performs periodic (at 

least annual) risk assessment. 

No SO was attached for the 

designation of the Risk 

Management Committee; 

however, it can be gleaned from 

the Notice of Meeting the 

existence of said committee as 

headed by Dir. Realin C. 

Aranza. Supporting documents 

for the performance of periodic 

risk assessment were not 

included on the supporting 

documents. 

g. Management performs 
periodic review to anticipate 

and identify routine events or 

activities that may affect the 

agency‘s ability to achieve its 

objectives and address them. 

Previously submitted evidence 

that Management adopts 

appropriate tools for the analysis 

and assessment of risks in its 

Risk Management Hand book is 

adopted. 

No supporting documents were 

submitted/ provided as proof of 

compliance with this Internal 

Control component. 

h. Management designs an 
overall risk response and 

specific actions for 

responding to fraud risks. 

Submitted Sectoral Risk 

monitoring and management 

report to prove that Management 

considers the potential risks 

related to fraud and corruption is 

adopted and made integral part 

hereof. 

No supporting documents were 

submitted/ provided as proof of 

compliance with this Internal 

Control component. 

i. Management includes fraud 
risk management programs as 

part of the agency‘s 

governance structure. 

j. Management assesses fraud 
risk exposure periodically to 

identify specific potential 

schemes and events that the 

agency needs to mitigate. 

k. Management establishes 
prevention mechanisms and 

techniques to avoid potential 

key fraud risk events and, 

where feasible, to mitigate 

possible impacts on the 

agency. 

l. Management establishes 
detection techniques to 

uncover fraud events when 

preventive measures fail or 

unmitigated risks are 

realized. 

m. Management establishes a 
reporting process to solicit 

input on potential fraud, and 



164

Validation 

a coordinated approach to 

investigation and corrective 

action should be used to help 

ensure potential fraud is 

addressed appropriately and 

timely. 

n. There are processes to ensure 
that Accounting Department 

is aware of significant 

transactions with related 

parties, so it can determine if 

such transactions are 

appropriately accounted for 

and disclosed. 

o. The Accounting Department 
has a process for identifying 

and addressing changes in 

PPSAS/PFRS, as well as for 

approving changes in 

accounting principles and 

policies.

PUP Management identifies, 

analyzes, and responds to 

significant changes that could 

impact the internal control 

system such as Sectoral Report 

on the Risks and Opportunities 

and Meeting Regarding ISO 

surveillance audit are adopted. 

No supporting documents were 

submitted/ provided as proof of 

compliance with this Internal 

Control component. 

p. Management reports to the 
head of agency or the 

governing body on changes 

that may have a significant 

effect on the agency. 

The Management was able to 

provide Sectoral Report on the 

Risks and Opportunities. 

However, in the report 

submitted, the Risk Assessment 

Handbook as a tool for 

identifying risk and necessary 

actions needed was not used; 

therefore, its purpose   was not 

properly served. 

q. There are processes to ensure 
that the Accounting 

Department is aware of 

changes in the operating 

environment, so it can review 

the changes and determine 

what, if any, effect the 

change may have on the 

agency‘s accounting 

practices. 

No supporting documents were 

submitted/ provided as proof of 

compliance with this Internal 

Control component.  

r. There are channels of 
communication between the

effect on the agency. 

Control Activities 

a. Management establishes 
policies and procedures to 

address risks and to achieve 

the agency‘s objectives. 

Proof that PUP is ISO 

9001:2005 certified as evidenced 

by the Registration Certificate 

issued by AJA is adopted. 

 

ISO 9001:2015 Certification 

issued by SOCOTEC 

Certification Philippines, Inc. 

issued on September 5, 2019 and 

valid until 15 December 2021. 

No supporting documents were 

submitted/ provided as proof of 

compliance with this Internal 

Control component. 

b. Management identifies all 
relevant objectives and 

associated risks for each 

significant activity, in 

conjunction with conducting 

the risk assessment and 

analysis function. 

c. Management identifies the 
actions and control activities 

needed to address the risks 

and directs their 

implementation. 

d. Management establishes 
control activities pertaining to 

top-level management 

review, human resources 

management, information 

systems management, 

physical asset management, 

and performance 

measurement. 

Submitted proof showing that 

the controls are in place 

following ISO 9001:2005 is 

adopted. 

No supporting documents were 

submitted/ provided as proof of 

compliance with this Internal 

Control component. 

e. Management establishes 
policies to ensure that duties 

are logically divided or 

segregated (whether 

manually or through 

appropriate set up of 

information technology [IT] 

applications) among different 

people to reduce the risk of 

fraud or inappropriate 

actions. 

Evidence of Controls such as in 

Local Off Campus Activities is 

adopted. 

The Management only provided 

controls for Local Off Campus 

Activities. Controls to other 

necessary matters cannot be 

ascertained. 

f. Management sets clear 
objectives in terms of budget 

and other financial and 

operating goals. These 

objectives are clearly written 

and communicated 

throughout the agency, and 

are actively monitored. 

Controls such as in Local Off 

Campus Activities are adopted. 

No supporting documents were 

submitted/ provided as proof of 

compliance with this Internal 

Control component. 

g. There is an appropriate 
segregation of       

incompatible activities (e.g., 

separation of accounting 

 



166 

 

Internal Control Component

Compliance 

Auditor’s Observation and 

Validation 

functions from access to 

assets; IT operation functions 

separate from systems and 

programming; and database 

administration function 

separate from applications 

and systems programming). 

h. Management designs its 
control activities at the 

agency level, transaction 

level, or both, depending on 

the level of precision needed 

to ensure achievement of 

objectives and address risks 

in the operations. 

 

i. Management designs a 
variety of transaction control 

activities for operational 

processes which include 

verifications, reconciliations, 

authorizations and approvals, 

physical control activities, 

and supervisory control 

activities. 

 

Information and Communication 

Monitoring Activities 

The agency establishes an internal 

audit service. 

Proof that assessment regularly 

conducted is adopted. 

 

Additional proof that the 

University conducts ongoing 

monitoring activities, separate 

evaluations, or a combination of 

both, in the conduct of 

assessment is the requirement to 

submit QAR to monitor 

compliance with the office 

targets/ commitments. 

The submitted file only provided 

for the guidelines in the 

participation in seminars, 

trainings, etc. With regard to the 

purpose of internal audit unit, no 

supporting documents were 

attached. Moreover, the scope of 

audit and plan of activities of the 

Internal Audit unit are not 

provided. Thus, purpose and 

implementation of the Internal 

Audit Unit cannot be 

determined.  

The Internal Audit function is 

independent (in terms of authority 

and reporting relationships) of the 

activities it audits. 

No supporting documents were 

submitted/ provided as proof of 

compliance with this Internal 

Control component. 

The Internal Audit Unit regularly 

assesses the effectiveness of the 

internal controls. 

The monitoring of internal control 

occurs in the course of the normal, 

recurring operations of the agency. 

The scope of activities of internal 

audit service is appropriate, given 

the nature, size, and structure of 

the agency. 



167 

 

Internal Control Component 
Management Proof of 

Compliance 

Auditor’s Observation and 

Validation 

The scope of planned activities of 

internal audit service is reviewed 

in advance by the head of agency 

or the governing body. 

The methodology used may 

include self-assessments using 

checklists, questionnaires, or other 

similar devices/tools. 

There has been a recent quality 

assurance review of the internal 

audit function by an external party 

such as, but not limited to, the 

Commission on Audit auditors. 

The external party conducting the 

assessment gains sufficient 

understanding of the agency‘s 

missions, goals, objectives, and its 

operations and activities. 

The external party gains an 

understanding of how the agency‘s 

internal control is supposed to 

work and how it actually works. 

The external party analyzes the 

results of the evaluation/ 

assessment against established 

criteria. 

All reported potential 

improprieties are reviewed, 

investigated, and resolved on a 

timely manner. 

Previously submitted that 

findings and recommendations 

of audits and other reviews are 

adequately and promptly 

resolved, example are policies 

addressing audit report are 

adopted and made integral part 

of our submission. 

The Management had attached 

sample documents of issues 

which are promptly addressed by 

the Management; however, it 

cannot be automatically 

concluded that all the issues in 

the University have taken action 

in a timely manner. 

 

Management is kept informed 

through periodic reports on the 

status of audit and reviews 

resolution so that it can ensure the 

quality and timeliness of individual 

resolution decisions. 

 

15.13. Based on the foregoing, the Management was able to develop and install 
systems, controls, plans, and handbooks for Internal Control System 

purposes, however, the Management did not  provide or submit documents 

which substantiate its compliance with a given Internal Control Component 

as detailed above, hence complete evaluation of the whole Internal Control 

System employed by the University cannot be done, which should be 

directed in the assessment of the achievement of its aim to deliver and 

promote quality public services in an efficient and effective manner as 

evident in the agency‘s smooth-running and streamlined operations. 

 

  



168 

 

15.14. We recommended that Management: 
 

a. regularly review and update, if necessary, its internal control system 
and the manual, for the agency’s goal in accordance with Internal 

Control Standards for the Philippine Public Sector; 

 

b. ensure proper installation, implementation and monitoring of a 
sound system of internal control through proper coordination 

between and among the concerned offices as stated in Section 124 of 

PD No. 1445; 

 

c. submit or provide supporting documents for each Internal Control 
Component which lacked proof of compliance with the ICSPPS and 

IASPPS to facilitate evaluation and to allow the Audit Team to 

recommend improvements. 

 

15.15. To address the deficiencies as observed by the Audit Team, the management 
presents the following action plans to be implemented: 

 

a. The Internal Audit Office (IAO) will create and propose a system to 
review and monitor the internal control system of the University in 

accordance with ICSPPS. 

 

b. IAO will perform a status quo review of the internal control system of 
the University within the year, through close coordination among 

various offices and units starting with high-risk offices, in order to 

ensure that proper internal controls have been and will be installed, 

implemented, and monitored. 

 

c. IAO, through coordination with either concerned Offices and Units, will 
submit or provide supporting documents for each Internal Control 

Component that lacked proof of compliance with the ICSPPS and the 

IASPPS to COA by August 31, 2021. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

15.16. The Progress and Execution Report regarding the mentioned plans shall be 
reviewed and validated once final outputs are submitted to the Audit Team. 

 

 

  



169 

 

Deficiencies in Payroll System 

 

16. Incompleteness of the minimum information requirements for the processing 
and releasing of the General Payrolls rendered difficult the identification of the 

AOs in the preparation and certification thereof, contrary to the pertinent 

provisions of Appendix 33 of the GGAM for NGAs Volume II, and Section 4 of 

Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445.  

 

16.1. Appendix 33 of GAM for NGAs Volume II defines payroll as a form used 
by an agency/entity to pay salaries, wages, PERA, and other monetary 

benefits to its officers/employees for a specific period of time or on a given 

date.  

 

16.2. The same provision provides for the minimum information requirements to 
be reflected in every payroll, as follows: 

 

1. For the period – period covered by the payroll 
2. Entity Name – name of the agency/entity 
3. Fund Cluster – the fund cluster name/code in accordance with UACS in 

which the obligation should be charged 

4. Payroll No. – payroll number assigned by the Accounting Division/Unit 
5. Sheet ____ of ____ Sheets – sheet number 
6. Serial No. – entry number in the payroll 
7. Name – complete name of the officers/employees covered by the payroll 
8. Position – position of officers/employees in the payroll  
9. Employee No. – employee number assigned by the agency/entity 

concerned 

10. Compensations – compensations being received by the employee such 
as Salaries and Wages-Regular, PERA, etc. Additional columns shall be 

provided by the agency/entity as necessary. 

11. Gross Amount Earned – total amount of salaries and other 
compensations earned for the period 

12. Deductions – amount of authorized deductions such as withholding tax, 
PhilHealth premium, GSIS contributions/loans, etc. from the employee‘s 

gross amount earned. Additional columns shall be provided by the 

agency/entity as necessary. 

13. Total Deductions – total amount of deductions 
14. Net Amount Due – gross amount earned less total deductions 
15. Signature of Recipient – signature of officer/employee, or his/her duly 

authorized representative receiving the net amount due 

16. Box A – certification by the authorized official that services was duly 
rendered as stated. 

17. Box B – certification of the Head of Accounting Division/Unit on the 
completeness and propriety of the supporting documents and the 

availability of cash, and the date the certification was signed 



170 

 

18. Box C – approval by the Head of the Agency or his/her Authorized 
Representative on the payment covered by the Payroll, and the date the 

certification was signed 

19. Box D – certification of the Authorized Official/Employee/Disbursing 
Officer that each employee whose name appears on the payroll has been 

paid the amount as indicated opposite his/her name, and the date the 

certification was signed 

20. Box E – the assigned ORS/BURS and JEV numbers and their respective 
dates 

 

16.3. Further, Paragraph 1 of Section 4 of PD No. 1445 provides that 
disbursement of disposition of government funds or property shall 

invariably bear the approval of the proper officials. 

 

16.4. In relation to this, relevant provisions of Section 16 of the 2009 COA Rules 
and Regulations on the Settlement of Accounts (RRSA), particularly on the 

determination of persons responsible/liable states that: 

 

16.1 The liability of public officers and other persons for audit 
disallowances/charges shall be determined on the basis of: 

a) the nature of the disallowance/charge;  
b) the duties and responsibilities or obligations of 

officers/employees concerned;  

c) the extent of their participation in the disallowed/charged 
transaction; and 

d) the amount of damage or loss to the government, thus:  
xxx 

 

16.5. Verification of the general payrolls submitted by the Management revealed 
non-compliance with the minimum information requirements prescribed 

under Appendix 33 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume II.  

 

16.6. Cases in point are the following reviewed payrolls which contain incomplete 
information such as fund cluster, payroll number, serial number, employee 

number, and information contained in Box A to Box E. Also, although the 

general payrolls contain names and signatures of the officials concerned in 

the preparation and approval of the payroll, the same do not contain the 

statements provided under Appendix 33 of the GAM for NGAS, Volume II 

such as the certification of the completeness of documents, availability of 

funds and approval of the release of payment.

16.7. Nonetheless, the responsibility and consequent accountability of the 
concerned personnel and officials can be traced from the payroll process 

being employed by the PUP. An interview with the personnel in-charge of 

the preparation of the payroll disclosed the following: 

 

Table 56: Review of the Payroll Process 

Office/ 

Department 
Process Responsibility 

Human Resource 

Management 

Department 

(HRMD) 

The preparation of payroll starts in the 

HRMD, where they prepare and collate 

documents that will support the claims 

for salaries and wages such as time 

cards and accomplishment reports from 

the head/ supervisors in an office. After 

completing the supporting documents, 

the HRMD indorses it to the 

Accounting Department. 

The HRMD is responsible 

for the certification of the 

services which have been 

duly served. 

Accounting 

Department 

(Payroll Section) 

After receiving the documents from the 

HRMD. The Payroll Section checks the 

completeness of the supporting 

documents. Once the documents have 

been checked, they manually update 

and encode necessary details on the 

Payroll System and generate the 

General Payroll (GP) report from it. 

Then forward the GP report to the 

Budget Office. 

The Payroll Section is 

responsible for checking of 

the completeness of 

supporting documents before 

preparation of the General 

Payroll Report. 

Budget Office Upon receiving the report, the Budget 

Office will let HRMD sign the report 

first, in order to certify correctness of 

the report, before they prepare the 

Obligation Request and Status/ Budget 

Utilization Request And Status (ORS/ 

BURS). Once the ORS/ BURS was 

prepared, they submit all documents to

(Head) 

Upon receiving of the said documents 

from the Budget Office, the Accounting 

Office will finalize the DV and prepare 

necessary JEV. The head of the 

Accounting Office will then sign the 

GP report for availability of the Funds 

and submit it to the Office of the Vice 

President for Finance. 

The Accounting Department 

is responsible for the 

certification of availability of 

the funds. 

Office of the Vice 

President for 

Finance 

The Vice President for Finance will 

then sign the GP report for approval 

and forward it to the Funds 

Management Office (FMO). 

The OVPF is responsible for 

the approval of the release of 

the payroll. 

Fund Management 

Office (FMO) 

The FMO has limited access to the 

Payroll System, in which they extract 

report with correct balances of salaries 

and wages due to the employee and 

officers, and they convert it into the 

format of LBP for crediting purposes, 

provided that it was supported by the 

LDDAP/ check signed by FMO and  

OVPF. 

The FMO is responsible for 

the release of the salaries and 

wages to each employee and 

officers. 

 

16.8. The failure of the PUP to include the information required under the GAM 
for NGAs in the general payrolls prepared and submitted, results in the 

difficulty and confusion in identifying the AOs in the preparation of the 

payroll, and in determining the persons liable in case the payroll transactions 

shall be in dispute, pursuant to the pertinent provisions in Section 16 of the 

2009 COA Rules and Regulations on the Settlement of Accounts.  

 

16.9. Since the PUP employs a Payroll System, all payrolls generated and 
submitted are deficient as to the minimum information requirements 

prescribed under Appendix 33 of the GAM for NGAs. 

 

16.10. We recommended that Management: 
 

a. submit a certification that the signatures contained in the submitted 
payrolls are equivalent to the required certifications and 



173 

 

authorization prescribed under Appendix 33 of the GAM for NGAs 

Volume II, to preclude issuance of Notice of Suspension or 

Disallowance; 

 

b. update the payroll system to conform with the minimum 
information requirements of the GAM; and 

 

c. henceforth, faithfully comply with the minimum requirements in the 
preparation and releasing of the general payroll. 

 

16.11. The Management commented that the they are complying the requirements 
for processing and releasing of payrolls, as follows: 

 

1) For the period – Already included in the payroll document (heading) 
2) Entity Name- Already included in the payroll document (heading) 
3) Fund Cluster- Already included in the DV by the accounting 

department upon receipt of ALOBS from Budget Office; 

4) Payroll No-Already included in the payroll document (upper right 
hand corner) as Filename. We can change that caption to Payroll 

number if need be; 

5) Sheet of Sheet – isn‘t this the page N of M? Found in the payroll doc 
bottom part; 

6) Serial No. – Need clarification as to what this field pertains to; 
7) Name – Already included in the payroll documents; 
8) Position – We have no data of actual positions of each and every 

employees; 

9) Employee No. – Currently PUP do not have the complete employee no 
data, hence we excluded it. Employee No. should be provided by 

HRMD; 

10) Compensation – Already included in the payroll documents; 
11) Gross Amount Earned – Already included in the payroll documents  
12) Deductions- Already included in the payroll documents 
13) Deductions – Already included in the Payroll Documents 
14) Net Amount Due – Already included in the payroll documents; 
15) Signature of Recipient – The payroll is automatically credited to 

employee‘s bank account number and they no longer to visit the 

cashier‘s office to sign the payroll doc that‘s why we remove that 

column; 

16) Box A – Found in the General Payroll and DV;  
17) Box B -   Found in the General Payroll and DV; 
18) Box C -   Found in the General Payroll and DV; 
19) Box D – Found in the Report of Advice to Debit Account 

Disbursement and ADA Salaries; and  

20) Box E – OBRS/BURS is found in the DV and the JEV is attached to 
General payroll. 

  



174 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

16.12. We reiterate that all of the requirements for the processing and releasing of 
the documents were found in order with the Appendix 33 of for NGAs, 

Volume II, except for the following: 

 

1. Fund Cluster –this must be included on the upper left of the payroll as 

provided in the Appendix 33 of GAM for NGAs, Volume II which 

indicates the fund cluster name/code in accordance with UACS in which 

the obligation should be charged. 

 

2. Serial No. – this pertains to the number of the employee included on the 

payroll; 

 

3. Employee Position and Employee No. – this data must be provided by 

the HRMD; and 

 

4. Boxes A to E – ensure completeness of minimum data required as 

provided under the Appendix 33 of GAM for NGAs, Volume II in order

Compliance with RA No. 9184 or The Government Procurement Act 

 

17. The four (4) executed contracts did not conform with the existing rules and 
regulations on the procurement process as required under COA Circular No. 

2009-001 and pertinent sections of the 2016 Revised IRR of Republic Act (RA) 

No. 9184.  

 

17.1. COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009 was issued to reiterate 
the submission of the documentary requirements such as government 

contracts, purchase orders and their supporting documents, to implement a 

systematic and effective review process with a view of generating timely 

and relevant audit results. 

 

17.2. Section 3.1.1 of the said Circular states that “Within five (5) working days 
from the execution of a contract by the government or any of its 

subdivisions, agencies or instrumentalities, including government-owned 

and controlled corporations and their subsidiaries, a copy of said contract 

and each of all the documents forming part thereof by reference or 

incorporation shall be furnished to the Auditor of the agency concerned.”  

 

17.3. For CY 2020, the following projects were identified for contract review:

17.4. Evaluation of the abovementioned contracts revealed that the agency did not 
submit them within the period prescribed under COA Circular No. 2009-

001, which precluded the Audit Team to conduct timely review and 

evaluation thereof. Details are as follows:

17.5. Moreover, the 2016 Revised IRR of RA No. 9184, otherwise known as the 
Government Procurement Reform Act, prescribes the necessary rules and 

regulations for the modernization, standardization, and regulation of the 

procurement activities of the Government of the Philippines. 

 

17.6. Section 7.3.2. of the RIRR provides that ―the end-user units of the procuring 
entity shall prepare their respective Project Procurement Management Plan 

(PPMP) for their different programs, activities, and projects (PAPs). The 

PPMP shall include: 

 

a) Information on whether PAPs will be contracted out, implemented by 
administration in accordance with the guidelines issued by the GPPB, or 

consigned; 

b) The type and objective of contract to be employed; 
c) The extent/size of the contract scopes/packages; 

  



177 

 

d) The procurement methods to be adopted, and indicating the procurement 
tasks are to be outsourced as provided in Section 53.6 of this IRR; 

e) The time schedule for each procurement activity and for the contract 
implementation; and 

f) The estimated budget for the general components of the contract.‖ 
  

17.7. However, per validation of the submitted documents, the information, as 
listed above, were not contained in the PPMPs attached with the submitted 

contracts. 

 

17.8. Further, Section 30, Rule IX – Bid Evaluation of the RIRR states the 
procedure in the preliminary examination of bids, to wit: 

 

30.1. The BAC shall open the first bid envelopes of prospective 

bidders in public to determine each bidder‘s compliance with the 

documents required to be submitted for eligibility and for the 

technical requirements, as prescribed in this IRR. For this purpose, 

the BAC shall check the submitted documents of each bidder 

against a checklist of required documents to ascertain if they are all 

present, using a nondiscretionary ―pass/fail‖ criterion, as stated in 

the Instructions to Bidders. If a bidder submits the required 

document, it shall be rated ―passed‖ for that particular requirement. 

In this regard, bids that fail to include any requirement or are 

incomplete or patently insufficient shall be considered as ―failed‖. 

Otherwise, the BAC shall rate the said first bid envelope as 

―passed‖. 

 

30.2. Immediately after determining compliance with the 

requirements in the first envelope, the BAC shall forthwith open 

the second bid envelope of each remaining eligible bidder whose 

first bid envelope was rated ―passed.‖ The second envelope of each 

complying bidder shall be opened within the same day, except as 

provided under Section 33 of this IRR. In case one or more of the 

requirements in the second envelope of a particular bid is missing, 

incomplete or patently insufficient, and/or if the submitted total bid 

price exceeds the ABC, the BAC shall rate the bid concerned as 

―failed‖. Only bids that are determined to contain all the bid 

requirements for Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations 43 

both components shall be rated ―passed‖ and shall immediately be 

considered for evaluation and comparison. 

 

17.9. However, per review of the contract and its attachments for Construction of 
Multi-Purpose Building and Sports Facility (Phase III), it appeared that the 

second ―envelope of the bidder RM Mangubat Construction was rated 

―FAILED‖ for not following the Detailed Unit Price Analysis as required 

under Section IX of the Bidding Documents.‖  



178 

 

17.10. The said action of the BAC did not conform to Section 30.1 of the RIRR 
wherein the BAC is directed to ―check the submitted documents of each 

bidder against a checklist of required documents to ascertain if they are all 

present, using a nondiscretionary “pass/fail” criterion‖ (emphasis 

supplied). This nonconformity militated against the regularity of the 

execution of the said contract. 

 

17.11. Section 34, Rule X – Post-Qualification, provides for the objective and 
process of post-qualification. Section 34.8 states the period within which the 

post-qualification process may be had, to wit: 

 

34.8. The post-qualification process shall be completed in not more 

than seven (7) calendar days from the determination of the Lowest 

Calculated Bid/Highest Rated Bid. In exceptional cases, the post-

qualification period may be extended by the Head of the Procuring 

Entity, but in no case shall the aggregate period exceed thirty (30) 

calendar days. 

 

17.12. Per verification of the documents submitted for the four (4) projects, the 
BAC took at least 38 to 69 CDs to finish the entire post-qualification 

process for each project. This resulted in a delay of at least 31 to 62 CDs in 

the procurement process of the infrastructure projects, as detailed hereunder:

17.13. In addition, Section 37.1.2 of the RIRR provides that the Head of the 
Procuring Entity (HOPE) shall approve or disapprove the recommendation 

of the Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) to award the contract to the 

bidder with the Lowest Calculated Responsive Bid (LCRB)/Highest Rated 



179 

 

Responsive Bid or the Single Calculated/rated Responsive Bid within a 

period of seven (7) calendar days from the date of receipt of the 

recommendation of the BAC. However, for infrastructure projects with 

ABC of ₱50,000,000.00and below, the HOPE shall approve or disapprove 

the said recommendation within four (4) calendar days. 

 

17.14. Per verification, the Board of Regents did not approve the recommendations 
of the BAC to award the contract to the bidder with the LCRB for each 

project within four (4) calendar days from the date of receipt of the 

recommendation of the BAC, with delays ranging from 11 to 38 days, as 

detailed in the following:

17.15. Furthermore, Section 37.2.1. of the RIRR states that the winning bidder 
shall post the required Performance Security and enter into contract with the 

Procuring Entity within ten (10) calendar days from receipt by the winning 

bidder of the Notice of Award (NOA). 

 

17.16. As per review of the four contracts, the PUP has not entered into these 
contracts within 10 calendar days from receipt by the winning bidder of the 

NOA in three instances. This resulted in a delay of 109 CDs in the 

procurement process of the three projects.  Please see below for reference.

17.17. Lastly, Section 37.4.1. of the RIRR provides that the Procuring Entity shall 
issue a Notice to proceed (NTP) with a copy of the approved contract to the 

successful bidder within three (3) calendar days from the date of approval of 

the contract by the appropriate government approving authority. However, 

for infrastructure projects with an ABC of ₱50,000,000.00 and below, the 

maximum period is two (2) calendar days. The contract effectivity date shall 

be provided in the NTP by the Procuring Entity, which date shall not be later 

than seven (7) calendar days from the issuance of the NTP. 

 

17.18. Per examination of the four contracts involved, the PUP did not submit a 
copy of the NTP with respect to the project Construction of Multi-Purpose 

Building and Sports Facility (Phase III), contrary to the Section 37.4.1 of the 

RIRR. 

 

17.19. We recommended that Management, through the BAC: 
 

a. Timely submit copies of the approved contract within five (5) 
working days from execution of the same to preclude the suspension 

of salary of the officials and employees concerned until they shall 

have complied therewith as provided in Section 122 of PD 1445; 

 

b. Ensure that the PPMPs include the information required under 
Section 7.3.2. of the RIRR; 

 

c. Check the submitted documents of each bidder against a checklist of 
required documents to ascertain if they are all present, using a 

nondiscretionary “pass/fail” criterion as stated under Section 30, 

Rule IX – Bid Evaluation of the RIRR; 

 

d. Complete its post-qualification process in not more than seven (7) 
calendar days from the determination of the Lowest Calculated 

Bid/Highest Rated Bid, as provided under Section 34, Rule X – Post-

Qualification of the RIRR; 

  



181 

 

e. Secure the approval of the Board of Regents within the period 
stipulated in Section 37.1.2. of the RIRR; 

 

f. Explain why the PUP did not enter into contract within ten (10) 
calendar days from receipt by the Global-V Builders Co. (winning 

bidder) of the NOA; and 

 

g. Submit the said copy of the NTP to the COA immediately. 
 

Management Comments: 

 

17.20. The University, through its personnel assigned at the BAC Secretariat 
Office, is doing its best to comply with the COA Circular No. 2009-001. In 

fact, based on our records, we complied with the Circular with respect to the 

project Construction of Multi-Purpose Building and Sports Facility in 

Mabini Campus (Phase III). The pertinent dates are as follows: 

 

 

Date of Contract November 27, 2020 

Date of Submission to COA December 7, 2020 

 

17.21. Section 7.3.2 of the 2016 Revised IRR of Republic Act No. 9184 provides: 
 

7.3.2. In the preparation of the indicative APP, the end-user or 

implementing units of the Procuring Entity shall formulate their 

respective Project Procurement Management Plans (PPMPs) for 

their different programs, activities, and projects (PAPs). The 

PPMP shall include: xxx (boldfacing supplied) 

 

17.22. The four (4) projects covered by the AOM No. 2021-017-164(19) are not 
part of the University‘s Indicative APP. They were not funded through the 

General Fund and hence were not submitted to the DBM when it issued the 

budget call for the period. For projects to be funded by the General 

Appropriations Act, we are requiring the end-users preparing the PPMPs for 

inclusion in the indicative APP to supply the required information. 

 

17.23. The Management respectfully submit that the applicable provision is Section 
30.2 and not 30.1 since the document in question, i.e., the Detailed Unit 

Price Analysis, is part of the Financial Component (second envelope). 

 

17.24. Nevertheless, we respectfully submit that the BAC decision declaring the 
bid of RM Mangubat Construction ―Failed‖ is in accord with Section 30.2 

which mandates the BAC to rate the bid ―failed‖ in case any of the 

requirements in the second envelope of a particular bid is missing, 

incomplete or patently insufficient. 

  



182 

 

17.25. In the case of RM Mangubat Construction, the DUPA it submitted was 
found to be ―patently insufficient‖ for not following the required format. 

The insufficiency of the document was apparent on the face of the document 

which led the BAC to rate the bid ―Failed.‖ 

 

17.26. The applicable provision reads: 
 

Section 34.8 The post-qualification process shall be completed in 

not more than twelve (12) calendar days from the determination of 

the Lowest Calculated Bid/Highest Rated Bid. In exceptional 

cases, the post-qualification period may be extended by the HoPE, 

but in no case shall the aggregate period exceed forty-five (45) 

calendar days for Goods and Infrastructure Projects, or thirty (30) 

calendar days in Consulting Services. 

 

In case of post-disqualification of the bidder with the lowest 

calculated bid/highest rated bid, the BAC shall be given the same 

fresh period to conduct the post qualification of the next lowest 

calculated bid/highest rated bid until a bidder is post qualified or 

failure of bidding is declared based on Section 35.1© of this IRR. 

 

17.27. The BAC is doing its best to comply with the period provided in Section 
34.8 even during this pandemic period that limits our mobility and reduces 

the availability of the resource persons necessary to verify, validate and 

ascertain all items under Section 34.3 of the revised IRR of RA No. 9184. 

 

17.28. Moreover, the Management will reiterate the matter to the attention of the 
Board of Regents through proper channels. 

 

17.29. The University has entered into contract with the winning bidder. The 
following are the relevant dates: 

 

Date of NOA November 16, 2020 

Date of Receipt of NOA November 18, 2020 

Contract Date  November 27, 2020 

Date of NTP December 1, 2020 

Date of receipt of NTP December 14, 2020 

 

17.30. This project was also included in the Quarterly Report we submitted to the 
COA (First Quarter 2021). Moreover, based on record, copy of the NTP was 

submitted on December 23, 2020.  

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

17.31. Indeed, the BAC has complied with the Circular with respect to the project 
"Construction of Multi-Purpose Building and Sports Facility in Mabini 



183 

 

Campus (Phase III)". However, it does not change the more relevant fact 

that BAC had incurred 55 to 57 days of delay with respect to three out of 

four projects that were subjected to contract review, hence our finding on 

non-compliance with COA Circular No. 2009-001. 
 

17.32. Under the Government Procurement Manual, PPMP, which is a component 
of the Project Management Plan, deals primarily with: a) planning for the 

procurement of project requirements; b) bidding or procurement strategy; c) 

source selection; d) delivery and payment schedules; e) contract 

administration; f) contract termination; and g) other major milestones; in an 

effort to obtain goods, infrastructure projects and consulting services from 

suppliers, contractors and consultants. 
 

17.33. The PPMP serves as a guide document in the procurement and contract 
implementation process, as well as a vital reference in procurement 

monitoring. Moreover, it serves as an important tool in resource and 

financial management, allowing the Procuring Entity the flexibility to 

optimize the utilization of scarce resources. Well-planned procurement will 

significantly minimize the practice of doing short-cuts to ensure that the 

Procuring Entity is able to purchase its requirements for the delivery of 

public services.  
 

17.34. With regard to the comment that only PPMPs included in the indicative APP 
should have the required information under Sec. 7.3.2, it is respectfully 

submitted that the PPMP is an important tool in resource and financial 

management, and as such, must be utilized by the Procuring Entity in any of 

its projects. 

 

17.35. We respectfully submit that the criterion used for the first envelope (as 
stated in Sec. 30.1.) as well as for the second envelope (as stated in Sec 

30.2.) are one and the same, the non-discretionary "pass/fail" criterion. The 

said sections may not be phrased the same but a careful perusal would result 

in an observation that, indeed, both sections, are essentially the same. 
 

17.36. Likewise, the insufficiency in question does not deal with form but with 
substance. Following said submission, we stand by our observation that it is 

an error to have found the submitted DUPA of RM Mangubat Construction 

"patently insufficient" for the simple reason that it did not follow the 

required format. Said action by the BAC prevented the submitted bid of RM 

Mangubat Construction from being evaluated and compared with the other 

bids. It is therefore requested that the BAC submit a copy of the DUPA in 

question for verification. 
 

17.37. Also, as averred by the Management, the applicable provision is the one 
cited by Management. However, it does not change the fact that the BAC 

has incurred delay in the conduct of its post-qualification process. Following 



184 

 

their submission, the BAC had incurred 26 days of delay for the first three 

(3) projects and 57 days of delay for the fourth project. 
 

17.38. The pandemic should not excuse the delay incurred for the first three (3) 
projects since its respective post-qualifications were done on the months of 

November and December 2019, which were before the pandemic hit the 

country. 

 

17.39. Lastly, the BAC shall submit justification as to why it incurred 109 days of 
delay with respect to each of the three (3) contracts (all with JGR Design 

and Construction). 

 

 

Compliance with Gender and Development  

 

18. Out of the 49 activities included in the GAD Plan and Budget of the PUP for 
CY 2020, 25 activities were significantly accomplished, which cost the PUP a 

total amount of ₱42,928,569.14 or 29.39 percent of the total GAD Budget of 

₱146,050,000.00. However, specific budget items where the GAD Budget was 

drawn, as well as the specific accounts affected by the GAD-related 

transactions were not identified, and post-activity or terminal reports, and 

Harmonized Gender and Development Guideline (HGDG) test results, as 

attachments to the GAD Accomplishment Report were not yet submitted, 

hence verification of the amounts utilized in respective GAD activities, and 

validation of actual accomplishments with targeted outputs cannot be 

completely done. 

 

18.1. Section 31 of the RA No. 11465, otherwise known as the General 
Appropriations Act for the Fiscal Year 2020 (GAA FY 2020), states in part, 

that the GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of the 

agencies, which shall be at least five percent (5%) of their budgets. For this 

purpose, activities currently being undertaken by agencies which relate to 

GAD of those that contribute to poverty alleviation, economic 

empowerment especially of marginalized women, protection, promotion, 

and fulfilment of women‘s rights, and practice of gender-responsive 

governance are considered sufficient compliance with said requirement. 

Utilization of GAD budget shall be evaluated based on the GAD 

performance indicators identified by said agencies. 

 

18.2. Item IV, paragraph A.1 of COA Circular No. 2014-001 specifies that at least 
five percent (5%) of the total budget appropriations required for Gender and 

Development under existing laws and regulations must be appropriated and 

properly utilized for the purpose.  

 

18.3. Moreover, the same COA Circular subjects for audit the specific budget 
items where GAD Budget is drawn such as maintenance and other operating 

expenses, capital outlay and personal services and verify whether they are in 



185 

 

accordance with the Joint Circular No. 2012-01 of the PCW, NEDA and the 

DBM, and other applicable guidelines issued by oversight agencies. 

 

18.4. Item 3.4 of the PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01 delineating 
the guidelines for the preparation of Annual GAD Plans and Budgets and 

Accomplishment Reports (AR) to Implement the Magna Carta of Women, 

provides that to aid gender mainstreaming, agencies shall perform gender 

analysis using existing tools, such as the HGDG, to ensure that the different 

concerns of women and men are addressed equally and equitably in their 

PAPS.  

 

18.5. Further, Item 10.2 thereof specifies that in case an agency attributes a 
portion or the whole of the budget of its major program to the GAD Budget, 

it shall subject the same to the HGDG test to determine the actual 

expenditures that may be attributed to GAD Budget. If required, the agency 

may present the HGDG test result to GAD funds audit to justify GAD 

budget expenses. The result of the HDGD test shall be submitted to PCW. 

 

18.6. Furthermore, Item 10.4 of the same Joint Circular provides that the GAD 
AR shall be accompanied by the following: (1) brief summary of the 

reported program or project; (2) copies of reported policy issuances; (3) 

results of HGDG tests, if any; and (4) actions taken by the agency on the 

COA Audit findings and recommendations, if any. 

 

18.7. For CY 2020, the PUP has incorporated in its GAD Plan and Budget an 
amount of ₱146,050,000.00, equivalent to 8.54 percent of the PUP‘s total 

appropriations for CY 2020 amounting to ₱1,710,631,000.00, which is 3.54 

percent more than the required five percent threshold. 

 

18.8. At the end of the year, PUP has reported in its GAD Accomplishment 
Report actual expenditure totaling ₱43,522,974.50 for the GAD-related 

activities accomplished in CY 2020 equivalent to 29.80 percent of the GAD 

budget for the year. The GAD activities undertaken by the PUP and the 

corresponding costs incurred for CY 2020 are listed in Annex C hereof. 

 

18.9. As indicated in the Accomplishment Report, of the 19 client-focused 
activities included in the GAD Plan and Budget, seven were fully 

implemented in CY 2020, which cost the PUP ₱4,583,778.72 or 3.14 

percent of the total GAD Budget. However, out of the 30 organization-

focused planned activities for CY 2020 with corresponding budget of 

₱67,000,000.00, only 18 activities were accomplished which cost the agency 

a total of ₱38,344,790.42, equivalent to 26.25 percent of the total GAD 

Budget. In summary, a total of ₱42,928,569.14 or 29.39 percent of the total 

GAD Budget, has been expended by the PUP relating to 25 accomplished 

activities for CY 2020. Details are shown on the next page.

TOTAL GAD BUDGET  146,050,000.00    

 

18.10. This indicated that the GAD gender issues identified in the GAD Plan and 
Budget as approved and endorsed by the PCW were not sufficiently 

addressed by the PUP, brought about by the limitations and challenges 

during the pandemic which hindered the PUP to accomplish a total of 11 

planned activities during the year, while partially accomplishing seven 

client-focused activities and six organization-focused activities. 

 

18.11. However, the costs incurred in relation to and/or attributed to GAD 
Activities as reported in the GAD Accomplishment Report of the PUP 

cannot be ascertained due to the absence of documents indicating the 

breakdown of expenses, as well as the accounts affected by the said 

transactions. Likewise, as in the past year, the budget items where the GAD 

Budget was drawn, such as MOOE, CO and PS were not specified in the 

report as prescribed in paragraph A.3 of the PCW-NEDA-DBM JC No. 

2012-01.  

 

18.12. Also, post-training or terminal reports, including documentations, and the 
result of the HGDG test in the attribution of expenses for the 

repair/rehabilitation of Hasmin Hostel Building – M. H. Del Pilar Campus, 

were not yet submitted to the Office of the Auditor to support the reported 

accomplishments, hence validation cannot be completely done. 

 

18.13. Absence of these information hinders the Audit Team to substantiate and 
validate the amounts utilized in the respective GAD activities, and compare 

actual accomplishments with the targeted outputs. 

 

18.14. We recommended that Management: 
 

a. submit supporting documents/breakdown of expenses incurred for 
GAD activities to substantiate/validate the amount utilized;  



187 

 

b. provide GAD budget in accordance with the requirement of the 
Joint Circular indicating the source of funds where the items 

included in the budget were drawn; and  

 

c. submit, as attachments to the Accomplishment Report, the Post-
terminal Reports, HGDG test results, Minutes of the Meetings and 

documentations of the seminars and trainings conducted to aid the 

Audit Team in validating accomplishments with targeted outputs. 

 

18.15. In compliance to the recommendation, the Institute for Gender and 
Development submitted the attached Annual GAD Breakdown of Expenses. 

 

18.16. As per recommendation, the following documents are submitted: 
 

• Post-Terminal reports 

• Minutes of the Meetings 

• Documentations of Seminars and Trainings conducted 

 

18.17. As to the HGDG test results, attached herewith is the Revised Annual 
Accomplishment Report incorporating the comment of the Philippine 

Commission on Women (PCW). Two of the projects included in the original 

Accomplishment Report that requires the submission of HGDG test results 

were taken out as per the recommendation of PCW. 

 

 

Compliance with Mandatory Contributions/Deductions 

 

19. The PUP’s compliance with the pertinent rules and regulations on the 
withholding of taxes and premiums due from the employees, as well as the 

government share, and remittances thereof to the Bureau of Internal Revenue 

(BIR), Government Service Insurance System (GSIS), Home Development 

Mutual Fund (Pag-IBIG) and Philippine Health Insurance Corporation 

(PhilHealth) Fund within the prescribed periods, for all funds, cannot be fully 

ascertained and validated due to non-submission of necessary information and 

absence of documents/details. 

 

19.1. The following are the relevant regulations pertaining to the remittances of 
taxes withheld on income payments, as well as employees‘ and employer‘s 

contributions and loan amortizations due to BIR, GSIS, Pag-IBIG and 

PhilHealth Fund: 

 

A. Revenue Memorandum Circular (RMC) No. 23-2012 – reiterates the 
responsibilities of the officials and employees of government offices for 

the withholding of the applicable taxes on certain income payments and 

in the imposition of penalties for its non-compliance. Item B, thereof 



188 

 

laid down the responsibilities of the government officials/ employees as 

withholding agents, thus: 

 

B. RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE GOVERNMENT 

OFFICIALS/ EMPLOYEES AS WITHHOLDING AGENTS 

 

The following are the duties and obligations of the government 

officials/ employees as withholding agents: 

 

xxx 

 

4.   To remit on time taxes withheld. The responsible officials 

and employees, as withholding agents, should see to it that 

taxes withheld are accordingly remitted on or before their 

due dates using the prescribed monthly/ quarterly 

withholding tax remittance returns, together with other 

attachments, where applicable.  

 

xxx 

 

B. RA No. 8291 or GSIS Act of 1997 provides: 
 

SECTION 6. Collection and Remittance of Contributions. — 

(a) The employer shall report to the GSIS the names of all its 

employees, their corresponding employment status, positions, 

salaries and such other pertinent information, including 

subsequent changes therein, if any, as may be required by the 

GSIS; the employer shall deduct each month from the monthly 

salary or compensation of each employee the contribution 

payable by him in accordance with the schedule prescribed in 

the rules and regulations implementing this Act. 

 

(b) Each employer shall remit directly to the GSIS the 

employees‘ and employers‘ contributions within the first ten 

(10) days of the calendar month following the month to which 

the contributions apply. The remittance by the employer of the 

contributions to the GSIS shall take priority over and above the 

payment of any and all obligations, except salaries and wages 

of its employees 

 

  



189 

 

C. RA No. 9679 or the Home Development Mutual Fund Law of 2009 
states that: 

 

Section 3. Rule VII - Remittance of Collections of Pag-IBIG 

premiums 

 

a. All employers shall remit to the Fund their contributions and 
the contributions of their covered employees as well as the 

latter‘s loan amortizations or payments to the Fund, as 

provided for under Section 2 of this Rule, when applicable, 

within fifteen (15) days from the date the same were collected 

unless another period is previously agreed upon between the 

employer and the Fund, or within such periods as the Fund 

may prescribe otherwise. The Fund may prescribe a different 

remittance schedule for Filipinos employed by foreign based 

employers depending on the nature of their contracts or 

manner of their deployment abroad. 

 

b. Every employer required to set aside and remit such 
contributions as prescribed under R.A. No. 9679 and these 

Rules shall be liable for their payment, and non-payment 

thereof shall further subject the employer to a penalty of three 

percent (3%) per month of the amounts payable from the date 

the contributions fall due until paid. Every employer who 

actually deducts from the salary of his employee the latter‘s 

loan amortization or payments to the Fund, as provided for 

under these Rules, shall be liable for their payment, and non-

payment thereof shall likewise further subject the employer to 

a penalty of three percent (3%) per month of the amounts 

payable from the date the loan amortizations or payments fall 

due until paid. 

 

D. The IRR of the National Health Insurance Act of 2013 (RA No. 7875 as 
amended by RA Nos. 9241 and 160606) prescribes that: 

 

SECTION 11. Remittance of Premium Contribution 

Remittance of contribution shall be mandatory for all 

members. It shall be made to PhilHealth offices or to any of 

the accredited collecting agents. Failure to timely remit the 

appropriate premium contribution shall be subject to interest 

and penalties as prescribed by the Corporation without 

prejudice to other applicable penalties herein provided.

19.2. For CY 2020, the summary of amounts withheld and remitted to the BIR, 
GSIS, PhilHealth, and Pag-IBIG per the reports submitted by the PUP, are 

as follows:

Due to Pag-IBIG* 730,718.96 886,436.75 672,699.34 944,456.37 

* Withheld and remitted balances for General Fund or Fund 101 were not included due to non-submission of reports. Only 

those under Revolving Fund (Fund 163), Special Trust Fund (Fund 164), and Regular Trust Fund (Fund 184) were included. 
** Withheld and remitted balances for Fund 101 and Fund 164 were not included due to non-submission of reports. Only those 

under Revolving Fund and Regular Trust Fund were included. 

 

19.3. Review of withholding and remittances of these mandatory deductions 
showed various deficiencies, as follows: 

 

A. Due to BIR - 
 

19.4. As disclosed in the CY 2020 Notes to Financial Statements, the Due to BIR 
account has a beginning and ending balances of ₱43,161,686.46 and 

₱60,488,792.40, respectively. Comparison of the ending balances between 

the submitted report as indicated in the table above and FS balances resulted 

in a difference of ₱17,580,894.00. However, collections and remittances 

during the year cannot be further verified due to incomplete information.   

 

B. Due to GSIS - 
 

19.5. The account had a beginning balance of ₱4,064,438.08 and an ending 
balance of ₱5,798,515.16 for CY 2020 as culled from the Notes to Financial 

Statements.  However, collections and remittances during the year cannot be 

further verified due to incomplete information.  Moreover, inquiry from the 

concerned department disclosed that the Management was able to submit the 

list of the employees and their current status to GSIS as reference for the 

withholding and remittances purposes; however documents to support these 

claims are not yet submitted.  

 

C. Due to Pag-IBIG - 
 

19.6. The beginning and ending balances of due to Pag-IBIG account based on the 
Notes to Financial Statements are ₱1,869,249.75 and ₱1,797,117.04, 

respectively. As compared with the ending balance per submitted report, 

there has been a discrepancy of ₱852,660.67 which cannot be fully verified 

due to unavailability of the complete details.  

  



191 

 

D. Due to PhilHealth - 
 

19.7. The beginning balance per books of CY 2020 of the due to PhilHealth 
account amounted to ₱1,038,626.91 and ₱1,324,823.05, respectively, 

resulting in a difference of ₱1,236,857.78 in the ending balance when 

compared with the submitted reports. However, the nature of these 

discrepancies cannot be verified due to unavailability of the pertinent 

information. 

 

19.8. We recommended that Management:  
 

a. submit pertinent reports to the Audit Team detailing the amounts 
withheld and remitted to respective government agencies in CY 

2020; 

 

b. remit in full the taxes withheld on income payments to BIR, as well 
as the employees’ and employer’s contributions and loan 

amortizations to GSIS, Pag-IBIG, and PhilHealth fund within the 

period prescribed in RMC No. 23-2012, RA No. 8291 or GSIS Act of 

1997, RA No. 9679 or HDMF Law of 2009 or IRR of the National 

Health Insurance Act of 2013 (Republic Act 7875 as amended by 

Republic Act 9241 and 10606); and 

 

c. review and analyze the discrepancies in the balances of the subject 
accounts and provide the Audit Team with a copy of reconciliation, 

in order to properly identify unremitted balances, make appropriate 

adjustments and refund or remittance, if warranted. 

 

 

Delays in Submission of Reports 

 

20. Submission of the required monthly and quarterly financial accounting 
reports including ORs, DVs, Payrolls and supporting documents incurred 

delays ranging from two to 271 days, thus hindered the review of accounts of 

PUP in terms of regularity, validity, completeness and accuracy, contrary to 

the provisions of COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2014-1 dated July 2, 2014, 

Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies 

(NGAs) and other related existing laws and COA rules and regulations.

20.2. Relatively, Anti-Red Tape Authority (ARTA) Memorandum Circular No. 
2020-06 series of 2020 dated August 27, 2020 was issued to provide 

guidelines on the process of transaction in the new normal. 

 

20.3. Section 2 thereof states that: 
 

All Government Agencies are required to set up an online 

processing system for accepting applications for permits, licenses, 

clearances, aligned with the directive to adopt electronic versions 

of licenses, clearance, permits, certifications or authorizations 

under Section 9(e) of RA 11032, with the same level of authority 

as that of the signed hard copy, and which may be printed by the 

applicants or requesting parties in the convenience of their offices. 

The use of such electronic versions is intended to eliminate red-

tape and provide uninterrupted delivery of government services. 

 

Government Agencies shall accept electronic copies of the 

documentary requirements, including photographs, in place of hard 

copies, unless a hard copy of the requirement is required by law. 

This shall likewise apply to intra-agency documentary 

requirements of offices within an agency. 

 

In the absence of a fully-functioning online portal for the 

processing of applications, Government Agencies shall accept 

applications via their official email or through a designated email 

address (preferably through the Gov Mail System for security and 

data sovereignty). This shall be supported with adequate online and 

onsite information campaigns. 

 

  



194 

 

20.4. Moreover, Section 6.1 of the same Memorandum Circular states that: 
 

All Government Agencies shall OBSERVE and COMPLY with 

the prescribed processing times provided under RA 11032. Any 

failure to deliver a government service, especially in the issuance 

of permits, licenses, certification and authorizations, within the 

prescribed processing times constitutes a violation of RA 11032. 

 

The Authority is mindful of the challenges that many Government 

Agencies are facing since many of them have adopted various 

work arrangements that reduced their available manpower such as 

a work from home arrangements, flexible working hours, or the 

adoption of a skeleton (skeletal) workforce. However, it must be 

emphasized that this shall not be an excuse for Government 

Agencies to forego of the prescribed processing times, which 

remains to be in effect.

20.6. The late or non-submission of financial reports affects the timely audit of 
the accounts, receipts, disbursements and prompt correction of noted 

deficiencies, if any. Likewise, incomplete submission of supporting 

documents for the payment of various transactions hinders the Audit Team 

in establishing the propriety, validity and legality of the claims paid that 

warrant the issuance of Notice of Suspension. 

 

20.7. Notably, delays on submission of documents abruptly increased for CY 
2020 due to the Pandemic. It is understandable that we are now facing ―new 

normal‖, however, as a government agency, PUP is still expected to perform 

its duties effectively and efficiently. It must be emphasized that in the 

response letter of COA to ARTA‘s consultation regarding said 

Memorandum dated December 11, 2020, the Commission confirmed usage 

of electronic signatures and digital signatures, and affirmed the use of 

electronic transactions in government as promotion for Electronic 

Commerce Act, including the acceptance of payments and issuance of 

receipts using electronic data messages and electronic documents. 

 

20.8. We recommended that Management: 
 

a. through the concerned officials, comply strictly with the 
requirements of pertinent COA rules and regulations on the 

timeline of submission of required reports, to reduce, if not, 

eliminate delay/non-submission of reports, otherwise, cause the 



200 

 

suspension of payment of salaries of concerned AOs/employees until 

they shall have complied with the requirements of the Commission 

in accordance with Section 122 of Presidential Decree No. 1445;  

 

b. secure e-access of the agency’s transactions or snapshots from the 
bank for each account to facilitate timely preparation of the BRSs; 

and ensure to indicate the date of receipt of the bank statements 

which will serve as a basis in determining the timeliness of 

submission of reports; and 

 

c. submit soft and/or hard copies of the reports to the Audit Team 
through email and/or in the Office of the Audit Team Leader, 

whichever is practical/convenient, on or before the deadline to 

eliminate delays on the submission of the reports.  

 

20.9. Management commented that the delays were due to COVID Pandemic and 
Community Quarantine protocols.  The Management tries its best to comply 

with submissions within the deadline. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

20.10. Monitoring of the subsequent submission reports of the Management 
revealed that the Management were able to submit the required documents/ 

reports for CY 2020, subject to the verification of the Audit Team.
