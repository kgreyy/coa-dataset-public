EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 

 

A. Introduction 
 

The Polytechnic University of the Philippines (PUP) was founded in October 

1904 and was originally known as Manila Business School (MBS) under the 

superintendence of C.A. O’Reilley.  In 1908, it was renamed as Philippine School of 

Commerce (PSC) and merged with the Philippine Normal School in 1933 to 1946.  By 

virtue of Republic Act (RA) No. 779 in 1952, the PSC was changed to Philippine College 

of Commerce (PCC).  Subsequently, with the passage of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 

1341 on April 1, 1978, the PCC was converted into a chartered state university, now 

known as the PUP.  

 

Governance of PUP is vested upon the Board of Regents, chaired by Hon. Ronald 

L. Adamat, Commissioner, Commission on Higher Education (CHED), together with  

10 other members, which exercises policy-making functions to carry out the mission and 

programs of the University in accordance with and by virtue of RA No. 8292, the Higher 

Education Modernization Act of 1997.

The PUP adopts the centralized accounting system wherein only one set of books 

for all its Campuses is kept and maintained by the Accounting Department in its Main 

Campus located at Sta. Mesa, Manila.  

 

The LGU-funded Campuses, except for its Campus in Alfonso, Cavite are being 

billed by the PUP-Accounting Department in Sta. Mesa for the salaries, allowances and 

other benefits of the assigned administrative and academic personnel.  The LGUs of the 

Campuses in Sta. Maria, Bulacan, Sta. Rosa and Calauan, Laguna are likewise billed for 

its Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE) as they are being shouldered in 

full by the LGU.  The MOOE of the rest of the Campuses are shared in part by PUP and 

the LGU, the latter directly paying the creditors for its share on the MOOE.  The funds 

released by LGUs to PUP are considered as inter-agency fund transfers.  On the other 

hand, the Personnel Services (PS) and MOOE for its Campus in Alfonso, Cavite are 

being charged against the revolving fund from the LGU that is being replenished 

annually.

The PUP has successfully implemented its programs, activities, and projects 

(PAPs) during the fiscal year 2020 despite the Pandemic condition in the country and 

limited financial resources.  The physical, financial and income performance targets set 

by the University during the period have been achieved with manageable deviations due 

to some uncontrollable factors. 

 

Under the Higher Education Program-Outcome Indicators, the percentage of 

first-time licensure takers during year under review was 63.27 percent or a total of 31 

first-time licensure takers out of 49 who took the licensure examinations.  This actual 

accomplishment was only represented by the two (2) licensure programs, Bachelor of 

Science (BS) in Architecture and BS in Mechanical Engineering, out of 18 regular 

licensure programs covered by the University due to postponement/suspension of 

scheduled licensure examinations to mitigate and control the spread of COVID-19 virus.  

Thus, the likelihood of falling within the predicted target for FY 2020 may not be strong 

due to small representation in the data set.  Nonetheless, the actual accomplishment rate 

of PUP under this indicator is 97.80% with a variance of only -1.42%.  On the other 

hand, under Outcome Indicator 2; Percentage of graduates (2 years prior) that are 

employed, PUP surpassed its target of 54% with an actual accomplishment of 88.55% or 

a total of 3,757 respondents registered as employed out of 4,243 graduates who actively 

participated in the Tracer Study conducted by the University.  The PUP’s 

accomplishment rate therefore during this period has reached as high as 163.98% due to 

active participation of graduates in the survey. 

 

On Output Indicators of Higher Education Program, the computation of actual 

accomplishment in Indicator 1: Percentage of undergraduate student population enrolled 

in CHED-identified and RDC-identified priority programs was based on the new CHED-

identified programs indicated in CMO No. 5, series of 2019 for Academic Year 2019-

2020 issued on August 16, 2019.  The non-achievement of target (79%) is completely 

uncontrollable because this was established, submitted, and published prior to the 

issuance of CMO No. 5, s. 2019. 

 

 On AACCUP program accreditation (Output Indicator 2), 100 percent or a 

total of 49 undergraduate programs in the main campus in Sta. Mesa, Manila were 

accredited.  Considering the total number of 152 accreditable undergraduate programs in 

all branches and campuses, 92 or 60.53 percent have earned AACCUP accreditation 

during the year.  This accomplishment is 38.23 percentage points higher than the physical 

target of 43.79 percent per approved 2020 National Expenditure Program (NEP). 

  



vi 

 

In the Advanced Education Program, the percentage of graduate school faculty 

engaged in research work has reached an overall accomplishment rate of 126.02 percent 

or 26 out of 80 total number of graduate school faculty.  During the same year under 

review, all graduate programs offered in the PUP Graduate School have earned 

accreditation requirement from the AACCUP. 

 

Under the Research Program, two (2) research outputs were utilized by the 

industry or other beneficiaries. PUP has completed a total of 119 research outputs during 

the year which is higher that its target of 115 per approved 2018 National Expenditure 

Program (NEP).  Likewise, of the 289 total research outputs produced by the University 

in the last three (3) years, 53 or 18.34 percent were published in CHED-recognized 

journals – higher than its target of 13.04 percent. This is due to the implementation of 

research publication incentive as approved by the University’s Board of Regents (BOR). 

 

In the Extension Program, the pandemic has affected many operations, 

specifically the community engagements which became a big challenge to the University. 

Extension activities were deferred due to the restrictions on mobility and health protocols 

imposed by the government to mitigate and control the spread of COVID-19 virus.  Thus, 

it is expected to experience a decline in the accomplishment of target under this indicator. 

 

PUP has maintained its rank as the leading University among the private and 

state-owned universities and colleges with graduates that are most preferred by more than 

500 leading companies and business organizations in the country based on the survey 

conducted by one of the most prestigious organizations, The Jobstreet.  

 

Likewise, PUP ranked 8th among the state universities and colleges, 16th among 

all universities in the Philippines in terms of academic web presence, based on the newest 

Webometrics Ranking of World Universities released in January 2021. 

 

Most importantly, PUP has successfully sustained its ISO-certification where the 

Management Systems of the University in both academic and administrative services 

consisting of 54 processes have been assessed during the 2nd surveillance audit 

conducted last December 2020 and registered no “Non-Conformities” (NCs) against the 

requirements of ISO 9001: 2015 standards by the SOCOTEC, Inc. (formerly AJA 

Registrars), a known QMS Accrediting Body.

D. Scope of Audit 
 

The audit covered the review of the accounts and operations of the PUP for the 

year ended December 31, 2020.  The audit was conducted to: (a) ascertain the level of 

assurance that may be placed on management’s assertions on the financial statements;  

(b) determine the propriety of transactions as well as the extent of compliance with 

applicable laws, rules and regulations; and (c) determine the extent of the implementation 

of prior years’ audit recommendations. 

 

E. Independent Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements 
 

The Auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the 

financial statements of the PUP for CY 2020 due to: 1) the unadjusted errors and 

omissions in the Cash and Cash Equivalents account amounting to ₱3,935,623.22;  

2) unreliable balance of the land account due to: a) unrecorded two parcels of land in 

Mulanay Branch acquired through purchase,; b)and nine parcels of land of eight 

Branches/Campuses acquired through donation not measured at fair value; and  

c) undocumented transfer of assets from San Juan Campus; and 3) doubtful balances of 

the Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) accounts due to: a) unreconciled balance 

between book and lapsing schedule of ₱841,270,709.82 due to exclusion of fully 



ix 

 

depreciated assets in the Lapsing Schedule of PPE; b) non-reclassification of completed 

projects costing ₱31,676,275.40 from the Construction in Progress account to School 

Buildings account and non-accrual of unbilled but completed infrastructure projects 

estimated at ₱60,680,138.54; and c) failure to substantiate the balances thereof with a 

reliable and complete Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment, as 

stated in the attached Independent Auditor’s Report and discussed in Part II of this 

Report. 

 

F. Summary of Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations 
 

The following are among the significant audit observations and recommendations, 

which are discussed in detail in Part II of the report: 

 

1. Cash and Cash Equivalents account balance as of December 31, 2020 is misstated in 
the amount of ₱3,935,623.22 resulting from errors and omissions, thus the accuracy, 

occurrence, cut-off, and existence of the said account and other affected accounts 

could not be relied upon. (Observation No. 1) 
 

We recommended that the Management through: 

 

I. Accounting Office: 
 

a. prepare adjusting entries for unrecorded deposits, credit memos, debit 
memos, and book errors amounting to ₱194,831.60, ₱10,102,985.53, 

₱10,099,118.58 and ₱3,674,366.01, respectively, recognize immediately 

all reconciling items that require adjustments and correcting entries in 

the books upon preparation of monthly Bank Reconciliation Statement 

(BRS) to avoid the accumulation of unrecorded reconciling items, 

pursuant to Section 6, Chapter 21 of the Government Accounting 

Manual for National Government Agencies (GAM for NGAs), Volume 

1;  

 

b. review the validity of debit memos in two payroll accounts, check their 
corresponding Advice to Debit Account (ADAs), and adjust 

accordingly; 

 

c. analyze the unaccounted prior years’ book reconciling items of 
₱3,861,251.10, and accordingly prepare the necessary adjusting entry; and 

 

d. for the unreconciled difference amounting to ₱4,030,640.12 in Fund 164 
(Special Trust Fund), prepare BRS as of December 31, 2020 and take 

up in the books the reconciling items that require adjustments. 

 

  



x 

 

II. Fund Management Office: 
 

e. prepare Official Receipts for the deposits made in all Cash in Bank – 
Local Currency, Current Account (CIB-LCCA) accounts as basis of 

recording of the Accounting Office; 

 

f. ensure the correctness of monthly Reports of Cash Disbursements in 
Payroll Scholarship Fund to avoid any unrecorded credit memos; 

 

g. prepare monthly Reports of Cash Disbursements for online payment 
transactions made in CIB-LCCA accounts, and submit the reports to 

the Office of COA Auditor, copy furnished the Accounting Office; and 

 

h. undertake the necessary procedures and prepare the necessary 
documentations prescribed by COA Circular No. 2015-001 dated 

January 29, 2015, related to the closed accounts of Jimmy Go 

Scholarship Fund. 

 

2. The balance of the Accounts Receivable account as of December 31, 2020 with net 
realizable value of ₱5,955,681.55 is unreliable due to the: a) undetermined exclusion 

of balances amounting ₱53,254.84 in CY 2020 Aging Report; b) unverified 

differences in the CY 2020 and 2019 balances amounting to ₱599,654.19 due to 

unavailability of the Subsidiary Ledger (SL); and c) Accounts Receivable amounting 

to ₱15,882,905.52 representing unpaid balances of PUP concessionaires remained 

unsettled/uncollected for more than three years which deprived the PUP of the 

benefits and revenue that should have been derived and utilized in their operations. 

(Observation No. 3) 

 

We recommended that Management through the: 

 

I. Accounting Office 
 

a. submit to the Audit Team the SL for each concessionaire listed in 
paragraph 3.6; and 

 

b. determine the cause of the exclusions of five concessionaires in the 2020 
CY Aging Report. 

 

II. Resource Generation Office 
 

c. identify the status of all the concessionaires with unpaid balances and 
provide the Audit Team with a Status List of Concessionaires;  

 

d. provide to the Audit Team a copy of the contracts for other 
concessionaires which are not yet submitted; and 

  



xi 

 

e. exert all efforts to collect overdue accounts receivable, and withhold 
warranty deposits before issuing clearances to concessionaires whose 

contracts have already lapsed. 

 

3. The valuation and accuracy of the Land account costing ₱9,837,770.65 as of 
December 31, 2020 are unreliable due to: a) unrecorded two parcels of land in 

Mulanay Branch acquired through purchase; b) nine parcels of land of eight 

Branches/Campuses acquired through donations not measured at fair value 

determined through appraisal as prescribed under Section 6.2.12 of COA Circular No. 

2020-006 dated January 31, 2020; and c) undocumented transfer of assets from San 

Juan Campus; thereby affecting the fair presentation of the Land account in the 

Financial Statements. (Observation No. 5) 

 

We recommended that Management through: 
 

I. Committee on Land Title: 
 

a. complete the appraisal of remaining land in Quezon City, Taguig City, 
Maragondon, Cavite, Sto. Tomas, Batangas, Bansud, Oriental Mindoro 

and Mariveles, Bataan Branches; 

 

II. Accounting Office: 
 

b. maintain Property, Plant and Equipment Ledger Card (PPELC) as 
prescribed by the Manual, account for the beginning balance of Land 

account amounting to ₱186,458.01, reconcile with the records of the 

Property and Supply Management Office (PSMO) and if proven to be 

non-existing/missing Property, Plant and Equipment (PPEs) without 

available record of accountability, request from COA for authority to 

derecognize non-existing PPEs, in accordance with COA Circular No. 

2020-006 dated January 31, 2020; and 
 

III. Property and Supplies Management Office: 
 

c. make representation with the LGU of San Juan for the transfer of assets 
and submit documents such as MOA, Deed of Donation or other relevant 

accounting records to the Audit Team. 

 

4. The accuracy, reliability and existence of the Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) 
reported at carrying amount ₱1,296,096,065.25 as of December 31, 2020 are doubtful 

due to unreconciled balance between book and lapsing schedule of ₱841,270,709.82 

due to exclusion of fully depreciated assets in the Lapsing Schedule of PPE; thereby 

affecting the fair presentation of PPE accounts in the Financial Statements contrary to 

Section 7, Chapter 19 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume 1. (Observation No. 6) 

 

  



xii 

 

We recommended that Management through the Accounting Office: 

 

a. submit to the Audit Team a List of all fully depreciated assets which were 
excluded in the Lapsing Schedule of PPE; and 

 

b. identify the remaining unreconciled balances of PPE accounts in the books; 
and submit proof of compliance therewith to the Audit Team. 

 

5. The accuracy of the Construction in Progress (CIP) account with reported balance of 
₱66,481,509.40 as of December 31, 2020 is doubtful due to non-reclassification of 

completed projects costing ₱31,676,275.40 from the CIP to School Buildings account 

and non-accrual of unbilled but completed infrastructure projects estimated at 

₱60,680,138.54, thus affecting the fair presentation of respective accounts in the FS 

contrary to the provisions of GAM for NGAs. (Observation No. 7) 

 

We recommended that Management provide administrative policies and 

measures for all infrastructures projects compliant with the pertinent rules and 

regulations under the GAM for NGAs and direct the concerned offices to 

implement the same. 

 

We also recommended and the Project Planning and Development Office agreed 

to coordinate with the contractors for the final billings of three completed 

infrastructure projects. 

 

6. The annual physical inventory of PUP’s properties had not been effectively carried 
out by the Inventory Committee due to the absence of approved Physical Inventory 

Plan, and inappropriate accounting forms, valuation and reporting procedures 

inconsistent with the sound internal control principles of Property Accounting System 

as stated in the GAM for NGAs, Volume I and COA Circular No. 2020-006 dated 

January 31, 2020, thereby failing to substantiate the existence of the reported balances 

of the PPE accounts with a reliable and complete Report on the Physical Count of 

Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE). (Observation No. 8) 

 

We recommended that Management through: 

 

I. Property and Supplies Management Office: 
 

a. use and maintain the Property Card for all PPE properties including the 
intangible assets and CIP as prescribed by the Manual and provide an 

explanation for non-maintenance thereof, within a reasonable period of 

two months from receipt hereof;  

 

b. adopt the Property Number System and prepare Property Stickers using 
the format prescribed by the COA Circular No. 2020-006 dated January 

31, 2020 within a reasonable period of two months from receipt hereof;  

  



xiii 

 

II. Accounting Office: 
 

c. use the financial data in the lapsing schedule of PPE to prepare and 
maintain the PPELC prescribed under the manual and provide an 

explanation for non-maintenance thereof within a reasonable period of 

two months from receipt hereof; 

 

d. prepare, together with the PSMO and the Inventory Committee, a 
reconciliation of inventory count per RPCPPE with property and 

accounting records and if proven that some PPE items are non-

existing/missing PPEs without available record of accountability, follow 

the procedures, to derecognize non-existing PPEs as provided in Item 7.0 

of COA Circular No. 2020-006 dated January 31, 2020; 

 

III. Inventory Committee: 
 

e. submit an approved Property Inventory Plan covering the entire process 
of inventory-taking from planning, execution of actual physical count, 

and reporting thereof, specific assignments/duties of the Committee 

members, the cut-off date, schedule specifying the dates and locations of 

the inventory taking activities from start up to the targeted completion of 

the physical inventory and submit proof of compliance therewith to the 

Audit Team within a reasonable period of two months from receipt 

hereof; and 

 

f. accomplish properly the RPCPPE taking into consideration the lapses 
and deficiencies noted, provide all the required information therein in 

order to come up with an accurate reporting, submit the same to the 

Audit Team  within a reasonable period of two months from receipt 

hereof, pursuant to the provisions of Section 122, PD No. 1445 to preclude 

the imposable sanctions thereon, i.e., the outright withholding of salaries 

of the concerned officials and employees. 

 

7. Deficient compliance with the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of 
Republic Act No. 10931 or the Universal Access to Quality Tertiary Act of 2017 and 

CHED Memorandum Circular No. 2018-002, dated August 8, 2018 on the Free 

Higher Education benefits were noted such as: a) delayed recording of transactions; 

b) delayed billing to CHED of the Tuition and Other School Fees ranging from 112 to 

252 days; c) non-formulation of the mechanics of the Opt-Out Mechanism and 

Student Voluntary Contribution Mechanism; d) non-submission of soft copy files of 

the billings in USB flash drive; e) non maintenance of separate bank account;  

f) incomplete information on the billing statement as required under the Consolidated 

Billing Details Form 2 and other necessary data for easy monitoring of the students 

who are eligible as beneficiary; j) non-submission to the UniFAST Governing Board 

of annual report and other reportorial requirements on the date/s set by Congress. 

(Observation No. 11) 



xiv 

 

We recommended that Management: 

 

a. ensure submission of printed-out billings within five (5) days after the last 
day of registration as required under Section 2.2.2 of Rule III of the CHED 

Memorandum Circular; 

 

b. formulate opt-out and student voluntary contribution mechanisms, together 
with the necessary forms to be signed and notarized upon availment, for the 

students who are capacitated to pay and for those who voluntarily avail such 

mechanism; 

 

c. submit soft copy of the files of the billings in USB flash drive together with 
the printed-out copies in accordance with Section 2.2.2 of Rule III of the 

CHED Memorandum Circular, copy furnished the Audit Team; 

 

d. maintain a separate bank account for proper account management of the 
fund for Free Higher Education as per Section 1.3(c3) of Rule IV of the 

CHED Memorandum Circular;  

 

e. provide information on the students such as: (a) Type of StuFAP availed 
apart from Free Tuition Fee (if any); (b) Amount of StuFAP Availment; and 

(c) Number of semesters left in the Free HE benefits, for proper monitoring 

of the remaining available semester of a student-beneficiary; and 

 

f. submit an annual report and other reportorial requirements on the date/s set 
by Congress regarding the implementation of Free Higher Education to the 

UniFAST Governing Board, and submit proof of receipt to the Audit Team. 

 

8. Lapses in the implementation of the Tertiary Education Subsidy (TES), contrary to 
the provisions of the RA No. 10931, and its IRR, and the MOA between CHED, 

UniFAST Board, and PUP, affected the immediate educational needs of the 

beneficiaries due to: a) late receipt, recording and reporting of the fund transfers from 

CHED for Academic Year (AY) 2019-2020 subsidy totalling ₱55,372,800.00 

resulting in delayed releases/distribution thereof to the approved student-

beneficiaries, including the corresponding administrative costs, of which a total of 

₱28,757,600.00 was released only in 2021; b) delayed receipt of the corresponding 

administrative costs; c) variance of one to 59 in the number of approved beneficiaries 

in the respective PUP campus/branch per Listahan 2.0 as compared with the Payroll 

Registry causing the excessive fund transfers by CHED, which are still unreverted by 

PUP amounting to ₱3,831,600.00; d) errors in the courses or programs enrolled by the 

students as reflected in the Masterlist; and e) lack of specific rules on the liquidation 

of the releases of the TES. (Observation No. 12) 

 

  



xv 

 

We recommended that Management: 

 

a. constantly request from and coordinate with the Focal Person of CHED-
UniFAST for the timely release of the fund transfers, and eventually 

distribute to the intended recipients within the semester of the grant, to 

maximize the utility and benefits of the stipend; 

 

b. make formal representation with CHED-UniFAST for the updating of the 
Masterlist of the campuses, courses enrolled, among others, consistent with 

the general provisions of the MOA that the parties mutually agree to 

perform and abide thereby; 

 

c. timely submit the Liquidation Reports (LRs) for the fund releases for 
stipends and administrative cost credited in CY 2021 intended for the TES 

for AY 2019-2020; 

 

d. revert the excess of the fund transfers to CHED after determining the status 
of the students which remained unpaid; and 

 

e. request for clarification with the CHED on the liquidation requirements for 
the stipends paid to the students, as well as for the administrative costs, and 

require from the student-beneficiaries and concerned offices, the needed 

supporting documents. 

 

9. Allocation, utilization and disbursements of Special Trust Fun (STF) totaling 
₱1,024,963,807.49 were not in accordance with CHED Memorandum Order (CMO) 

No. 20, series of 2011, and Section 4 (d) of RA No. 8292, due to: a) non-compliance 

with the prescribed percentage rate of allocation and the limitation on 

adjustment/modification of the specific budget allocation; b) below 40 percent 

utilization of funds for Instruction, Research Services, Extension Services, 

Administrative Services and Production; and c) unallocated actual collections and 

minimal utilization of Fiduciary Funds; thereby adversely affecting the effective and 

efficient delivery of programs, projects and activities consistent with the trifocal 

functions of the PUP, and the accumulation of unutilized cash balances maintained in 

the authorized government depository banks (AGDBs). (Observation No. 13) 

 

We recommended that Management: 

 

a. comply with the required percentage of allocation and/or limitations on 
adjustment or modification prescribed under CMO No. 20, series of 2011 in 

the succeeding Academic Years (AY), and submit appropriate justifications 

and/or Board Resolutions on the deviations in allotment on specific thrust, 

programs/activities of the PUP; 

  



xvi 

 

b. make a representation with the CHED on the proposed modification of the 
said CMO pursuant to Section 35 thereof, and furnish the Office of the 

Auditor with a copy thereof; 

 

c. observe set timelines in the implementation and completion of 
plans/programs and activities to ensure effective delivery of services and to 

address the needs of the students and other stakeholders, pursuant to Section 

24 of the CMO or request for realignment of the budget, as appropriate; 

 

d. maximize the utilization of the STF and Fiduciary Fund, as budgeted,  to 
ensure accomplishment of the PUP’s trifocal functions of instruction, 

research and extension services, production and administrative services, as 

well as the intended purposes for which the fiduciary fees are collected; and 

 

e. submit justification on the non-allocation of actual collections of fiduciary 
fees, and consider assessing possible reductions on fiduciary fees, where 

appropriate. 

 

The foregoing  audit observations and recommendations were communicated 

through Audit Observation Memoranda (AOMs) and discussed during the Exit 

Conference with concerned PUP officials and employees on May 18, 2021.  Their 

comments were incorporated in this Annual Audit Report (AAR), where appropriate.
