Dear Sir: 

 

 Pursuant to Section 2, Article IX-D of the Constitution of the Republic of the 

Philippines; Section 43 (2) of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445, otherwise known as the 

Government Auditing Code of the Philippines; and in line with this Commission’s 

continuing efforts to inform management on how fiscal responsibility has been discharged, 

we are pleased to transmit the report of our Auditor on the results of her audit on the 

accounts and operations of Eastern Samar State University (ESSU) for the year ended 

December 31,  2020. 

 

 The audit was conducted in accordance with the Philippine Public Sector Standards 

on Auditing to: (a) ascertain the level of assurance that may be placed on management’s 

assertions on the financial statements; (b) determine the propriety of transactions as well 

as the extent of compliance with applicable, laws, rules and regulations; and (c) determine 

the extent of the implementation of prior years’ audit recommendations. 

 

A qualified opinion was rendered on the fairness of presentation of the financial 

statement as of December 31, 2020 for the reasons stated in Part 1- Independent Auditor’s 

Report. 

 

In her report, the Auditor enumerated the following significant findings and 

observations, viz: 

 

1. The year-end balance of the Cash in Bank-Local Currency, Current Account 
of the ESSU Campuses totaling P141,374,445.42 is unreliable due to the 

variance between the balances in the bank confirmation results and the 

balances in the General Ledger (GL) totaling P45,841,164.62 caused by the 

following: i) unadjusted reconciling items in the bank totaling P157,042.78, 

and in the books amounting to P44,579,335.13, and ii) unreconciled balances 

in the books reflected in the Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS) 

amounting to P1,418,872.27, thus affecting the fair presentation of the 

financial statements. 

 



 

2. The Receivables-Disallowances/Charges account of Main and External 
Campuses totaling P4,212,955.79 is not reliable due to: (a) the errors in 

recording as credits to the account for refunds made by the persons liable for 

disallowances; (b) the non-recognition in the books as receivables of 

disallowances with Notices of Finality of Decision (NFDs); and (c) the failure of 

the Accountant to maintain Subsidiary Ledgers for each of the disallowances that 

have become final and executory, contrary to Section 111 of PD No. 1445, 

Sections 7.2.1(d) and 22.6 of COA Circular No. 2009-006, and pertinent 

provisions of the GAM for NGAs. 

 

3. The existence and accuracy of the Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) 
accounts valued at ₱1,003,795,272.02 as of December 31, 2020 could not be 

ascertained due to: (a) failure to conduct an inventory of PPE items totaling 

P359,482,287.99; (b) unreconciled discrepancy between the balances in the 

Statement of Financial Position (SFP) and the balances in the Report on the 

Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) totaling 

P4,603,277.11; (c) non-provision for depreciation of several PPE accounts 

aggregating P34,202,953.66; (d) unserviceable properties totaling P3,223,464.12 

are still recorded in the PPE account; (e) errors in the recording of semi-

expendable items totaling P639,005.85; and  the (f) absence of proof of 

ownership of the Land account valued at P5,503,985.50, thus affecting the fair 

presentation of the PPE accounts in the financial statements. 

 

4. The balances of the Construction in Progress - Buildings and Other Structures 
account reported at P72,256,877.17 is not reliable due to: (a) errors in recording 

transactions in the Construction in Progress-Buildings and Other Structures 

account totaling P2,248,676.71; (b) unrecorded costs of the five ongoing 

infrastructure projects; and (c) the non-reclassification of the three completed 

projects in CYs 2019 and 2020 to their appropriate PPE accounts, contrary to 

PD No. 1445 and the GAM for NGAs, Volumes I and III. 

 

5. The Accounts Payable account of the ESSU – Main and Maydolong 
Campuses totaling  P3,260,159.01 is not reliable due to: a)  the recording of  

payables totaling P2,140,706.41 which are not properly documented; b) 

the booking up of payables for undelivered procurements in CY 2020 totaling 

P45,050.00;  and c) the reporting of variances in the balances appearing in the 

Statement of Financial Position and the Financial Accountability Reports, 

contrary to Sections 111 and 119 of PD No. 1445 and pertinent provisions of 

the GAM for NGAs, Volumes I and III. 

 

6. Relevant information on the reported balances in the consolidated Statement

reported on the individual  SPF and Statement of Financial Performance of 



 

the Main and Maydolong Campuses, are not adequately disclosed in the Notes 

to Financial Statements in accordance with the GAM for NGAs. 

 

7. Cash advances granted to several accountable officers at ESSU totaling 
P1,579,350.92 remained unliquidated as of December 31, 2020 because of 

several deficiences noted relative to their granting, utilization and liquidation, 

contrary to the pertinent provisions of Chapter 6 of the GAM for NGAs, 

Volume I; and COA Circular No. 97-002. 

 

8. Accounts Payable, totaling P318,049.22 as of December 31, 2020, have

Joint Circular No. 99-6 dated November 13, 1999, and Executive Order (EO) 

No. 87 dated August 13, 2019, thus immobilizing funds that could have been 

useful for other operating needs of ESSU. 

 

9. Honoraria were paid to the Graduate School faculty for CY 2020 totaling

10. The Dean of the College of Engineering was allowed to receive Representation 
Allowance and Transportation Allowance (RATA) totaling P120,000.00,

thereby rendering the payments unauthorized and without legal basis. 

 

11. The grant of benefits under the Faculty and Staff Development Program (FSDP) 
of ESSU had several deficiencies, as follows: a) assistance totalling P54,025.12 

was granted despite the lapse of the grantees’ scholarship grant tenure; and

requirements, contrary to ESSU Board of Regents (BOR) Resolution No. 46, s. 

2008; Section IV of the FSDP Revised Rules and Regulations (RRR); and the 

pertinent provisions of PD No. 1445 and COA Circular No. 2012-003. 

 

12. The grant of compensation-related Magna Carta benefits to Public Health 
Workers of ESSU had several deficiencies, as follows: (a) hazard pay 

amounting to P8,013.25 granted to employees even while on a fifteen-day 

vacation leave; (b) overpayments totaling P19,543.74, and (c) payment of 

subsistence and laundry allowances amounting to P23,880.00 taken from the 

IGF, contrary to the pertinent provisions of the Department of Budget and 

Management (DBM) and Department of Health (DOH) Joint Circular (JC) 

No. 1, s. 2016, as well as the DBM-DOH JC No. 1, s. 2012; and of the 

Commission on Higher Education (CHED) Memorandum Order No. 03, s. 2001.

(100%) of the difference between the actual accommodation expenses and the 



 

accommodation component of the prescribed Daily Travel Expense rate, 

contrary to Section 5 of Executive Order (EO) No. 77, thus constituting an 

irregular expenditure as set forth in COA Circular No. 2012-003, dated 

October 29, 2012. 

 

14. Honoraria totaling P7,389,392.37 expended for teaching overload of the Main 
Campus’ Graduate School professors for CY 2020 could not be properly 

evaluated due to the management’s failure to support the disbursements with 

complete documentation, and to indicate in the payrolls the data needed to 

arrive at the Prime Hourly Teaching Rate (PHTR), contrary to Section 4(6) of 

PD No. 1445, Item 5.7.2 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 and pertinent 

provisions of Civil Service Commission Memorandum Circular (CSC MC) 

No. 10, s. 2020 dated May 7, 2020. 

 

15. ESSU paid the final claims of the contractors of four infrastructure projects

of RA No. 9184, otherwise known as the Government Procurement Reform 

Act; and COA Circular No. 2012-001 and related laws and regulations.

not bear the signatures of proper officials, and were not supported with 

complete documents, contrary to Section 4 of PD No. 1445 and the pertinent 

provisions of Chapter 2 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I. 

 

18. Expenses for fuel and lubricants of Main Campus’ motor vehicles totaling 
P2,033,138.61 could not effectively be evaluated because of the management’s 

failure to support the disbursements with complete documentation, contrary to 

Section 4(6) of PD No. 1445 and COA Circular No. 77-61. 

 

19. ESSU granted the release of retention money for expendable supplies despite 
the non-submission of proof that the same were fully consumed, contrary to 

the provisions of the 2016 RIRR of RA No. 9184. 

 

20. The Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) of Maydolong and Salcedo 
Campuses did not prepare the Procurement Monitoring Reports (PMRs) while 

the BACs of all other ESSU Campuses did not submit their PMRs to the 

Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB) as required under Section 12.2 of 

the 2016 RIRR of RA No. 9184, thus the benefits of procurement transparency, 



 

tracking of efficiency, monitoring and compliance with the procurement 

standards were not realized. 

 

21. Of the 27,774 student-recipients of the CHED Scholarship Programs of 
ESSU, only 13,941 or 50% are enrolled in the priority courses identified by 

the CHED for financial assistance in AY 2019-2020, contrary to the 

government’s convergent efforts in addressing the prevailing job-skill 

mismatch.  

 

22. The GAD Accomplishment Report of ESSU was not submitted to the Audit 
Team on time, nor was this properly accomplished, contrary to PCW-NEDA-

the Magna Carta of Women. 

 

The details of the foregoing and other findings and observations are discussed in

We request that the audit recommendations be immediately implemented and we

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

 

 

A. Introduction 
 

The Eastern Samar State University (ESSU) was founded on February 14, 1960 as 

the Eastern Samar National Regional Agricultural School – ESNRAS through Republic 

Act (RA) No. 2434.  The school was converted into the Eastern Samar Junior 

Agricultural College (ESJAC) in 1973 to meet the clamor for the offering of the 

collegiate courses. ESJAC promptly opened a program in Associate in Agriculture and 

later Bachelor of Science in Agriculture (BSA) when it became Eastern Samar College of 

Agriculture (ESCA) in 1978.  ESCA was converted into the Eastern Samar State College 

(ESSC) by virtue of Batas Pambansa (BP) No. 394 on May 18, 1993.  This conversion 

eventually paved the way to rapid expansion in program offerings with courses in teacher 

education, vocational post-secondary education, business and commerce, engineering and 

law. 

 

RA No. 8292, enacted on June 6, 1997 mandated the CHED Supervised Higher 

Education Institution of a province to be integrated in a State College or a University 

(SUC) System.  ESSC Guiuan (Formerly Felipe Abrigo National Memorial College of 

Arts and Trade), ESSC Salcedo (Formerly Southern Samar College of Agriculture, 

Science and Technology) and ESSC Can-avid (Formerly Can-avid National and 

Agriculture College) were integrated into the Eastern Samar State College in Borongan. 

 

On August 7, 2004, RA No. 9312 was signed into law by President Gloria 

Macapagal Arroyo, converting ESSC into a University called the Eastern Samar State 

University, which furthermore integrated the Maydolong National Agricultural School 

into the new University.  Congressman Marcelino C. Libanan introduced the conversion 

bill in 2003 during the 12th congress, and Senator Francis N. Pangilinan sponsored it in 

the Senate. 

 

The audit covered the review of accounts and operations of ESSU for Calendar 

Year (CY) 2020.  The audit was conducted to: a) verify the level of reliance that may be 

placed on management’s assertions on the financial statements; b)  determine the extent of 

compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations; c) recommend agency 

improvement opportunities; and d) determine the extent of implementation of prior year’s 

audit recommendations. 

 

 

B. Financial Highlights 
 

The ESSU’s total assets, liabilities, equity income, expenses, appropriation/ 

allotments and obligations for current and previous years are as follows: 

 

Accounts CY 2020 CY 2019

C. Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements 
 

 

The Auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the 

financial statements of ESSU for the CY 2020 due to the unreliability of the year-end 

balances of the following accounts: Cash in Bank-Local Currency, Current Account, 

Receivables-Disallowances/Charges, Property Plant and Equipment, Construction in 

Progress and Accounts Payable.   Also, the disclosure requirements in the Notes to 

Financial Statements under the Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standards were not 

fully observed for the reported balances in the consolidated Statement of Financial Position 

of Inventories, Property Plant and Equipment, Biological Assets, and Other Payables 

accounts, thus, the disclosures contained in the Notes to FSs do not adequately provide 

relevant information on the financial position and performance of ESSU as of yearend. 

 

 

D. Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations 
 

 The following are the significant audit observations and recommendations which 

are discussed in detail in Part II of this Report: 

 

1. Cash advances granted to several accountable officers at ESSU totaling 
P1,579,350.92 remained unliquidated as of December 31, 2020 because of 

several deficiences noted relative to their granting, utilization and liquidation, 

contrary to the pertinent provisions of Chapter 6 of the GAM For NGAs, 

Volume I; and COA Circular No. 97-002. 

 

We recommended that the President: 

 

a. instruct all accountable officers and employees concerned to liquidate 
immediately their outstanding cash advances in accordance with the 

pertinent provisions of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I and COA 

Circular No. 97-002, otherwise, withhold the payment of any money 

due them in accordance with Section 37 of PD No. 1445;  

 



iii 

b. instruct all accountants to properly account for the Advances 
accounts in accordance with the pertinent provisions of Section 6 of 

the GAM for NGAs, Volume I;  

 

c. instruct all accountable officers and employees to stop using cash 
advances granted in the current year to pay for the expenses incurred 

in prior years; and 

 

d. direct all officials and employees to strictly adhere with the laws, rules 
and regulations pertaining to the granting, utilization, and 

liquidation of all cash advances. 

 

2. Accounts Payable totaling P318,049.22 as of December 31, 2020 have 
remained long outstanding for more than two years, and were not reverted to 

the Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) or the Cumulative Results of Operations – 

Unappropriated (CROU), contrary to Section 98 of PD No. 1445, DBM-COA 

Joint Circular No. 99-6 dated November 13, 1999, and Executive Order No. 

87 dated August 13, 2019, thus immobilizing funds that could have been 

useful fot other operating needs of the University. 

 

We recommended that the President require the Accountants concerned 

to review the recorded claims in the Accounts Payable, and revert to the 

Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) account all claims which have remained 

outstanding for two years or more, and for which no valid claims have 

been filed. 

 

3. Honoraria were paid to the Graduate School faculty for CY 2020 totaling 
P6,510,794.29 despite ESSU incurring a deficit, resulting in the use of its 

Internally Generated Fund (IGF) to cover the deficiency. 

 

We recommended that the President direct the Dean of the Graduate 

School to: 

 

a. consider equally qualified faculty members with junior academic 
ranks to handle graduate courses,  and limit the number of units of 

loads assigned to senior faculty members to comply with the budget; 

and 

 

b. approximate/allocate the amount of honoraria that shall be paid to 
the Graduate School professors with the corresponding tuition and 

other fees that can be charged from, together with the budget 

allocation from the GAA. 

 

We also recommended that the President direct the: 

 



iv 

a. Budget Officers to properly charge the obligations for the honoraria 
of the Graduate School faculty to the funds to which they are directly 

attributable; and 

 

b. Accountants to ensure that funds are actually available to pay for the 
honoraria and other needs of the Graduate School before payments 

are processed, and eventually disbursed in compliance with the rules 

and regulations. 

 

4. The Dean of the College of Engineering was allowed to receive 
Representation Allowance and Transportation Allowance (RATA) totaling 

P120,000.00, contrary to Item 4.7 of National Budget Circular No. 404 dated 

May 29, 1989, thereby rendering the payments unauthorized and without 

legal basis. 

 

We recommended that the President direct the Accountants to:  

 

a. stop the practice of granting RATA to ESSU’s officials who do not 
qualify for the allowance in accordance with the provisions of Item 

4.7 of the National Budget Circular No. 404 dated May 29, 1989; and  

 

b. require the official concerned to refund the unauthorized amount 
received by her. 

 

5. The grant of benefits under the Faculty and Staff Development Program 
(FSDP) of ESSU had several deficiencies, as follows: a) assistance totalling 

P54,025.12 was granted despite the lapse of the grantees’ scholarship grant 

tenure; and b) payment of claims amounting to P60,248.06 with incomplete 

documentary requirements, contrary to ESSU Board of Regents (BOR) 

Resolution No. 46, s. 2008; Section IV of the FSDP Revised Rules and 

Regulations (RRR); and the pertinent provisions of PD No. 1445 and COA 

Circular No. 2012-003. 

 

We recommended that the President formally establish the FSDP 

Committee to ensure the proper implementation of the ESSU FSDP so 

that funds for the program are adequately safeguarded; 

 

We also recommended that the President direct the Accountants 

concerned to: 

 

a. ensure that payments of claims relative to the scholarship grant 
under the ESSU FSDP are in accordance with the BOR Resolution 

No. 46, s. 2008, FSDP RRR, and the pertinent provisions of PD No. 

1445;  

 



v 

b. properly charge expenses against the account to which they are 
directly related and authorized; and 

 

c. require the faculty members concerned to refund the unauthorized 
amount received by them. 

 

6. The grant of compensation-related Magna Carta benefits to Public Health 
Workers (PHWs) of ESSU had several deficiencies, as follows: a) hazard pay 

amounting to P8,013.25 granted to employees even while on a fifteen-day 

vacation leave; b) overpayments totaling P19,543.74, and c) payment of 

subsistence and laundry allowances amounting to P23,880.00 taken from the 

IGF, contrary to the pertinent provisions of the Department of Budget and 

Management (DBM) and Department of Health (DOH) Joint Circular (JC) 

No. 1, s. 2016, as well as the DBM-DOH JC No. 1, s. 2012; and of the 

Commission on Higher Education (CHED) Memorandum Order No. 03, s. 

2001. 

 

We recommended that the President direct the Accountants concerned 

to: 

 

a. require the employees concerned to refund the unauthorized amounts 
they received; 

 

b. strictly adhere to the pertinent provisions of the DBM-DOH Joint 
Circular No. 1, s. 2016; DBM-DOH Joint Circular No. 1, s. 2012; and 

Section 18 (d) of the CHED Memorandum Order No. 3, s. 2001, on 

the grant of compensation-related Magna Carta benefits to PHWs of 

ESSU; 

 

c. submit the DTRs to support the claims of hazard pay, subsistence and 
laundry allowances for December 2020 of Main Campus and the 

documentary requirements on the claim for hazard pay differential 

under a disbursement voucher with Check No. 0000110215 dated 

June 29, 2020 of Guiuan Campus; and 

 

d. correctly recognize Laundry Allowance account for expenses which 
directly relate thereto. 

 

7. Claims for travel expenses totaling P24,219.43 exceeded one hundred percent 
(100%) of the difference between the actual accommodation expenses and the 

accommodation component of the prescribed Daily Travel Expense rate, 

contrary to Section 5 of Executive Order (EO) No. 77, thus constituting an 

irregular expenditure as set forth in COA Circular No. 2012-003, dated 

October 29, 2012. 

 



vi 

We recommended that Management require the accountable officers 

concerned to refund the unauthorized amount received by them. 

Henceforth, claims for official travels should be paid in accordance with 

the prescribed rates prescribed in EO No. 77. 

 

8. Honoraria totaling P7,389,392.37 expended for teaching overload of the Main 
Campus’ Graduate School professors for CY 2020 could not be properly 

evaluated due to the management’s failure to support the disbursements with 

complete documentation, and to indicate in the payrolls the data needed to 

arrive at the Prime Hourly Teaching Rate (PHTR),  contrary to Section 4(6) 

of PD 1445, Item 5.7.2 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 and pertinent 

provisions of Civil Service Commission Memorandum Circular  (CSC MC) 

No. 10, s. 2020 dated May 7, 2020. 

 

We recommended that the University President direct the: 

 

a. Dean of the Graduate School and professors concerned to submit 
properly accomplished DTRs, and their accomplishment reports and 

work from home schedules, and other supporting documents as 

provided under pertinent rules and regulations to establish the 

propriety of their claims for honoraria;  

 

b. Accountant to ensure the complete documentation of money claims 
before they are processed for payment.  Thereafter, existing accounting 

and auditing rules and regulations on the submission of documentary 

requirements to support the claims for honoraria should be strictly 

adhered to; and 

 

c. Dean of the Graduate School to indicate in subsequent payrolls the 
vital data in order to derive a faculty member’s PHTR.  Moreover, 

provide the Audit Team with the revised payrolls for claims of the 

Graduate School professors’ honoraria for CY 2020 for review and 

evaluation.  

 

9. ESSU paid the final claims of the contractors of four infrastructure projects 
totaling P5,880,364.28 without requiring from these contractors the 

submission of As-Built Plans and warranty securities, contrary to the 

provisions of the 2016 Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (RIRR) 

of  RA 9184, otherwise known as the Government Procurement Reform Act, 

COA Circular No. 2012-001 and related laws and regulations. 

 

We recommended that the President direct the: 

 

a. Director of the Infrastructure Projects Development & Engineering 
Services to require the submission of the As-Built Plans and warranty 



vii 

securities of the four  infrastructure projects to the Audit Team for 

review; and  

 

b. OIC-Accountant to process only those claims of infrastructure 
projects with complete documentary requirements. 

 

10. Payments for the Representation Allowance and Transportation Allowance 
(RATA) totaling P2,671,000.00 were not supported with their complete 

documentary requirements, as prescribed in Item 5.2 of COA Circular 2012-

001 dated June 14, 2012. 

 

We recommended that the management strictly adhere to the pertinent 

provisions of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 and 

Section 4(6) of PD No. 1445 in the payment of RATA claims. 

 

11. Travel Expense Vouchers (TEVs) for CY 2020 totaling P2,467,005.69 did 
not bear the signatures of proper officials, and were not supported with 

complete documents, contrary to Sections 4(5) and 4(6) of PD No. 1445 and 

the pertinent provisions of Chapter 2 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I. 

 

We recommended that the President instruct the Accountants to: 

 

a. ensure the approval of proper officials and complete documentation 
of money claims before they are processed for payment.  Thereafter, 

compliance with the documentary requirements prescribed under 

existing accounting and auditing rules and regulations should be 

strictly adhered to;  

 

b. ensure that expenses charged against the Traveling Expense account 

should exclusively pertain to official travels of ESSU officials and 

employees; and 

 

c. properly charge expenses against the account to which they are 

directly related and authorized to. 

 

12. Expenses for fuel and lubricants of Main Campus’ motor vehicles totaling 
P2,033,138.61 could not effectively be evaluated because of management’s 

failure to support the disbursements with complete documentation, contrary 

to Section 4(6) of PD 1445 and COA Circular No. 77-61. 

 

We recommended that the Head of the Transportation and Motorpool 

Services require the drivers/agency personnel concerned to:   

 

a. properly accomplish the Driver’s Trip Tickets, indicating in detail all 
the required information therein; and 



viii 

 

b.  prepare and submit monthly the Report of Official Travels, and 
summarizing in chronological order the driver’s trips for the month 

based on their serial numbers, and properly accomplished Driver’s 

Trip Tickets, duly approved by Head of Transportation and 

Motorpool Services.  

 

We also recommended that the President require the assigned supply 

personnel to prepare and submit the following reports to support the 

consumption of gasoline/fuel and lubricants:  

 

a) Requisition and Issue Vouchers, 
b) Daily Gas Issued Record,  
c) Monthly Summary of Requisition and Issue Voucher, and 
d) Monthly Report of Fuel Consumption.  

 

13. ESSU granted the release of retention money for expendable supplies despite 
the non-submission of proof that the same were fully consumed, contrary to 

the provisions of the 2016 RIRR of RA 9184. 

 

We recommended that the President direct the OIC - University 

Accountant to: 

 

a. submit supporting documentary proof showing that the procured 
expendable supplies under the two above-mentioned contracts have 

been fully utilized and consumed; and 

 

b. refrain from releasing the retention money for the procurement of 
goods prior to the lapse of the warranty period in compliance with 

the 2016 RIRR of RA 9184, and to adequately protect the interest of 

the government. 

 

14. The Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) of Maydolong and Salcedo 
Campuses did not prepare the Procurement Monitoring Reports (PMRs) while 

the BACs of all other ESSU Campuses did not submit their PMRs to the 

Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB) as required under Section 

12.2 of the 2016 RIRR of RA No. 9184, thus the benefits of procurement 

transparency, tracking of efficiency, monitoring and compliance with the 

procurement standards were not attained. 

 

We recommended that the President and the Campus Administrators of 

all ESSU Campuses direct the members of the BAC to prepare and timely 

submit the PMRs of each campus to GPPB and publish the same in ESSU 

website as set forth in Section 12.2 of the 2016 RIRR of RA No. 9184 to 

ensure that all procurement activities are regularly monitored. 

 



ix 

15. Of the 27,774 student-recipients of the CHED Scholarship Programs (CSPs) 
of ESSU, only 13,941 or 50%  are enrolled in the priority courses identified 

by the CHED for financial assistance in AY 2019-2020, contrary to the 

government’s convergent efforts in addressing the prevailing job-skill 

mismatch.  

 

We recommended that the University President direct the Vice President 

for Academic Affairs in coordination with the College Deans and 

Campus Administrators to:  

 

a. conduct regular monitoring and assessment of the number of  
students enrolled for each program offered; and  

 

b. equitably assign the incoming freshmen students to priority courses 
as recommended by CHED to avoid overpopulation of enrollees in 

certain courses, and lesser enrollees in the priority courses. 

 

16. The GAD Accomplishment Report of ESSU was not submitted to the Audit 
Team on time, and which was not properly accomplished, contrary to PCW-

NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01, COA Circular No. 2014-001, and 

the IRR of RA No. 9710, otherwise known as the Magna Carta of Women. 

 

We recommended that the President require the GAD Focal Persons and 

other personnel concerned to: 

 

a. ensure that the GAD AR is submitted to the Audit Team within the 
prescribed period as required in item V of COA Circular No. 2014-

001; 

 

b. ensure that the GAD AR is prepared in accordance with Annex B of 
PCW-NEDA-DBM JC No. 2012-1; and 

 

c. develop and maintain GAD database with adequate and 
systematically gathered data to provide as input for gender-

responsive planning, programming and policy formulation. 

 

The above audit observations and recommendations were communicated to 

management through Audit Observation Memoranda and their comments were considered 

in the report, where appropriate.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT  

 

 

ANDRES C. PAGATPATAN, JR., Ph.D. 

President 

Eastern Samar State University 

Borongan City 

 

 

Qualified Opinion 

 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Eastern Samar 

State University (ESSU) which comprise the Statement of Financial Position as of 

December 31, 2020, and the Statements of Financial Performance, Statement of Changes 

in Net Assets/Equity, Statement of Cash Flows, Comparison of Budget and Actual 

Amounts for the year ended and Notes to Financial Statements, including a summary of 

significant accounting policies and other explanatory information. 

 

In our opinion, except for the effects of the matter described in the Bases for Qualified 

Opinion of our report, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material 

respects, the financial position of ESSU as of December 31, 2020, and its financial 

performance, its changes in net assets/equity, its cash flows, and its comparison of budget 

and actual amounts for the year then ended and notes to financial statements in accordance 

with the International Public Sector Accounting Standards. 

 

 

Bases for Qualified Opinion 

 

As discussed in Part II of this Report, the year-end balances of the following accounts are 

unreliable which affected the fair presentation of financial statements: a) Cash in Bank-

Local Currency, Current Account due to the variance between the balances in the bank 

confirmation results and the balances in the General Ledger totaling  P45,841,164.62;    b) 

Receivables-Disallowances/Charges account due to: i) errors in recording as credits to the 

account for refunds made by the persons liable for disallowances;  ii) the non-recognition 

in the books as receivables of disallowances with Notices of Finality of Decision; and iii) 

the failure of the Accountant to maintain Subsidiary Ledgers for each of the disallowances 



2 

that have become final and executory; c) Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) accounts due 

to: i) failure to conduct an inventory of PPE items totaling P359,482,287.99;  ii) 

unreconciled discrepancy between the balances in the Statement of Financial Position and 

the balances in the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment totaling 

P4,603,277.11;  iii)  non-provision for depreciation of several PPE accounts aggregating  

P34,202,953.66;  iv) unserviceable properties  totaling P3,223,464.12 are still recorded in 

the PPE account;  v) errors in the recording of semi-expendable items totaling P639,005.85; 

and vi) absence of proof of ownership of the Land account valued at P5,503,985.50; d) 

Construction in Progress-Buildings and Other Structures account due to: i) errors in 

recording transactions in the Construction in Progress-Buildings and Other Structures 

account totaling P2,248,676.71; ii) unrecorded costs of the five on-going infrastructure 

projects; and iii) the non-reclassification to their appropriate PPE accounts of the three 

completed projects in CYs 2019 and 2020;                    e) Accounts Payable  account of the 

ESSU – Main and Maydolong Campuses due to:            i)  the recording of  payables 

totaling P2,140,706.41 which are not properly documented; ii) the booking up of payables 

for undelivered procurements in CY 2020 totaling P45,050.00;  and iii) the reporting of 

variances in the balances appearing in the Statement of Financial Position and the Financial 

Accountability Reports. 

 

Moreover, the disclosure requirement in the Notes to Financial Statements  under the 

Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standards  were not fully observed for the reported 

balances in the consolidated Statement of Financial Position of Inventories,  PPE,  Other 

Payables and Biological Assets accounts amounting to P96,494,634.68; 

P1,003,795,272.02;  P5,022,663.21; and P1,595,460.00, respectively, and other various 

accounts reported on the individual Statement of Financial Position and Statement of 

Financial Performance of the Main and Maydolong Campuses, thus, information contained in 

the Notes to Financial Statements did not adequately provide relevant information on the 

financial position and performance of ESSU as of year end. 

 

 

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards of Supreme Audit 

Institutions (ISSAIs).  Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in 

the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of Financial Statements section of our report. 

We are independent of the agency in accordance with the ethical requirements that are 

relevant to our audit of the financial statements, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 

responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.  We believe that the audit evidence we 

have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our qualified opinion. 

 

 

Key Audit Matters 

 

Except for the matter described in the Basis for Qualified Opinion section, we have 

determined that there are no other audit matters to communicate in our report. 

 

 

 



3 

Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the 

Financial Statements 
 

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial 

statements in accordance with IPSASs and for such internal control as management 

determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial statements that are free 

from material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error. 

 

Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing ESSU’s financial reporting 

process. 

 

 

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of Financial Statements 

 

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements 

as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an 

auditor’s report that includes our opinion.  Reasonable assurance is a high level of 

assurance but it is not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISSAIs will 

always detect material misstatement when it exists.  Misstatements can arise from fraud or 

error and are considered material, if individually or aggregate, they could reasonably be 

expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial 

statements.

Qualified Opinion 

 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Eastern Samar 

State University (ESSU) which comprise the Statement of Financial Position as of 

December 31, 2020, and the Statements of Financial Performance, Statement of Changes 

in Net Assets/Equity, Statement of Cash Flows, Comparison of Budget and Actual 

Amounts for the year ended and Notes to Financial Statements, including a summary of 

significant accounting policies and other explanatory information. 

 

In our opinion, except for the effects of the matter described in the Bases for Qualified 

Opinion of our report, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material 

respects, the financial position of ESSU as of December 31, 2020, and its financial 

performance, its changes in net assets/equity, its cash flows, and its comparison of budget 

and actual amounts for the year then ended and notes to financial statements in accordance 

with the International Public Sector Accounting Standards. 

 

 

Bases for Qualified Opinion 

 

As discussed in Part II of this Report, the year-end balances of the following accounts are 

unreliable which affected the fair presentation of financial statements: a) Cash in Bank-

Local Currency, Current Account due to the variance between the balances in the bank 

confirmation results and the balances in the General Ledger totaling P45,841,164.62;         b) 

Receivables-Disallowances/Charges account due to: i) errors in recording as credits to the 

account for refunds made by the persons liable for disallowances;  ii) the non-recognition 

in the books as receivables of disallowances with Notices of Finality of Decision; and iii) 

the failure of the Accountant to maintain Subsidiary Ledgers for each of the disallowances 



2 

that have become final and executory; c) Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) accounts 

due to: i) failure to conduct an inventory of PPE items totaling P359,482,287.99;  ii) 

unreconciled discrepancy between the balances in the Statement of Financial Position and 

the balances in the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment totaling 

P4,603,277.11;  iii)  non-provision for depreciation of several PPE accounts aggregating  

P34,202,953.66;  iv) unserviceable properties  totaling P3,223,464.12 are still recorded in 

the PPE account;  v) errors in the recording of semi-expendable items totaling P639,005.85; 

and vi) absence of proof of ownership of the Land account valued at P5,503,985.50; d) 

Construction in Progress-Buildings and Other Structures account due to: i) errors in 

recording transactions in the Construction in Progress-Buildings and Other Structures 

account totaling P2,248,676.71; ii) unrecorded costs of the five on-going infrastructure 

projects; and iii) the non-reclassification to their appropriate PPE accounts of the three 

completed projects in CYs 2019 and 2020;                    e) Accounts Payable account of 

the ESSU – Main and Maydolong Campuses due to: i)  the recording of  payables 

totaling P2,140,706.41 which are not properly documented; ii) the booking up of payables 

for undelivered procurements in CY 2020 totaling P45,050.00;  and iii) the reporting of 

variances in the balances appearing in the Statement of Financial Position and the Financial 

Accountability Reports. 

 

Moreover, the disclosure requirement in the Notes to Financial Statements  under the 

Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standards  were not fully observed for the reported 

balances in the consolidated Statement of Financial Position of Inventories,  PPE,  Other 

Payables and Biological Assets accounts amounting to P96,494,634.68; 

P1,003,795,272.02;  P5,022,663.21; and P1,595,460.00, respectively, and other various 

accounts reported on the individual Statement of Financial Position and Statement of 

Financial Performance of the Main and Maydolong Campuses, thus, information contained in 

the Notes to Financial Statements did not adequately provide relevant information on the 

financial position and performance of ESSU as of year end. 

 

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards of Supreme Audit 

Institutions (ISSAIs).  Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in 

the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of Financial Statements section of our report.  

We are independent of the agency in accordance with the ethical requirements that are 

relevant to our audit of the financial statements, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 

responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.  We believe that the audit evidence we 

have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our qualified opinion. 

 

 

Key Audit Matters 

 

Except for the matter described in the Basis for Qualified Opinion section, we have 

determined that there are no other audit matters to communicate in our report. 

  



3 

Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the 

Financial Statements 
 

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial 

statements in accordance with IPSASs and for such internal control as management 

determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial statements that are free 

from material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error. 

 

Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing ESSU’s financial reporting 

process. 

 

 

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of Financial Statements 

 

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements 

as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue 

an auditor’s report that includes our opinion.  Reasonable assurance is a high level of 

assurance but it is not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISSAIs will 

always detect material misstatement when it exists.  Misstatements can arise from fraud or 

error and are considered material, if individually or aggregate, they could reasonably be 

expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial 

statements.

Notes to Financial Statements 

 

EASTERN SAMAR STATE UNIVERSITY 
Notes to Financial Statements 

For the year ended December 31, 2020 

 

 

 

1. General Information/Agency Profile 
 

The consolidated financial statements of Eastern Samar State University were 

authorized for issue on February 14, 2021 as shown in the Statement of 

Management Responsibility for Financial Statements signed by Andres C. 

Pagatpatan Jr., Ph. D., the President of the University. 

 

Eastern Samar State University is an Agency established on August 7, 2004 by 

virtue of R.A. No. 9312 converting Eastern Samar State College and integrating 

therewith the Maydolong National Agricultural School.  The University was 

originally founded as Eastern Samar National Regional Agricultural School 

(ESNRAS) on June 21, 1959 through R.A. 2434.  It offers secondary vocational 

agriculture.  In 1973 it became Eastern Samar Junior Agricultural College 

(ESJAC) when it offered Associate in Agriculture.  It then became a full-

pledged college when bachelor of Science in Agriculture with majors in animal 

science and crop science were offered.  This time it became known as Eastern 

Samar College of Agriculture (ESCA).  On May 18, 1983, ESCA became 

Eastern Samar State College (ESSC) through Batas Pambansa Blg. 394. 

 

In the year 2000, R.A. 8745 known as the Integration Law converted three 

CHED supervised institutions in the province namely Can-avid National 

Agricultural College (CNAC), Southern Samar College of Agriculture, Science 

and Technology (SSCAST), and Felipe Abrigo National Memorial College of 

Arts and Trades (FANMCAT) into Eastern Samar State College, thus the 

change to ESSC Can-avid, ESSC Salcedo and ESSC Guiuan, respectively.  The 

ESSC Borongan Campus together with the above converted CHED supervised 

institutions and the Maydolong National Agricultural School comprises the 

present Eastern Samar State University. 

 

The University has its four-fold function of Instruction, Research, Extension and 

Production Services.  Its mandate is to provide advanced education, higher 

technological, professional instruction and training in the fields of industry, 

computer and information technology, forestry, and environmental sciences, 

agriculture and veterinary medicine, fishery, medicine and related sciences, 

engineering, education, law, arts, and sciences, and other related fields of study.  

It shall also promote research and extension services, and provide progressive 

leadership in its areas of specialization.

3.4 Inventories 
 

Inventory is measured at cost upon initial recognition. To the extent that 

inventory was received through non-exchange transactions (for no cost or 

for a nominal cost), the cost of the inventory is its fair value at the date of 

acquisition. 

 

Inventories are recognized as an expense when deployed for utilization or 

consumption in the ordinary course of operations of the University. 

 

3.5 Property, Plant and Equipment 
 

Recognition 

 

An item is recognized as property, plant, and equipment (PPE) if it meets 

the characteristics and recognition criteria as a PPE. 

 

The characteristics of PPE are as follows: 

 

 tangible items; 
 

 are held for use in the production or supply of goods or services, or 
for administrative purposes; and 

 

 are expected to be used during more than one reporting period. 
 

An item of PPE is recognized as an asset if: 

 

 It is probable that future economic benefits or service potential 
associated with the item will flow to the entity; and 

 

 The cost or fair value of the item can be measured reliably and with 
an initial value of P15,000.00 or above it. 

 

Measurement at Recognition 

 

An item recognized as property, plant, and equipment is measured at cost. 

A PPE acquired through non-exchange transaction is measured at its fair 

value as at the date of acquisition. 

 

The cost of the PPE is the cash price equivalent or, for PPE acquired through 

non-exchange transaction, its cost is its fair value as at recognition date.  

 

Cost includes the following:

Notes to Financial Statements 

 

 Its purchase price, including import duties and non-refundable 
purchase taxes, after deducting trade discounts and rebates; 

 

 expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the 
items;  

 

Measurement After Recognition 

 

After recognition, all property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less 

accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.  

 

When significant parts of property, plant and equipment are required to be 

replaced at intervals, the University recognizes such parts as individual 

assets with specific useful lives and depreciates them accordingly.  

Likewise, when a major repair/replacement is done, its cost is recognized 

in the carrying amount of the plant and equipment as a replacement if the 

recognition criteria are satisfied.  

 

All other repair and maintenance costs are recognized as expense. 

 

Depreciation 

 

Initial Recognition of Depreciation 

 

Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use such as when it 

is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating 

in the manner intended by management. 

 

For simplicity and to avoid proportionate computation, the depreciation is 

for one month if the PPE is available for use on or before the 15th of the 

month.  However, if the PPE is available for use after the 15th of the month, 

depreciation is for the succeeding month. 

 

Depreciation Method 

 

The straight line method of depreciation is adopted unless another method 

is more appropriate for agency operation. 

 

Estimated Useful Life 

 

The University uses the Schedule on the Estimated Useful Life of PPE by 

classification prepared by COA.

Notes to Financial Statements 

 

The University uses a residual value equivalent to at least five percent (5%) 

of the cost of the PPE. 

 

Impairment  

 

An asset’s carrying amount is written down to its recoverable amount, or 

recoverable service amount, if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than 

its estimated recoverable service amount. 

 

Derecognition 

 

The University derecognizes items of property, plant and equipment and/or 

any significant part of an asset upon disposal or when no future economic 

benefits or service potential is expected from its continuing use.  Any gain 

or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference 

between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is 

included in the surplus or deficit when the asset is derecognized. 

 

Intangible assets acquired separately are initially recognized at cost.  

 

Internally Generated Intangible Assets 

 

Internally generated intangible assets, excluding capitalized development 

costs, are not capitalized and expenditure is reflected in surplus or deficit in 

the period in which the expenditure is incurred. 

 

Recognition of an Expense 

 

Expenditure on an intangible item were recognized as an expense when it 

is incurred unless it forms part of the cost of an intangible asset that meets 

the recognition criteria of an intangible asset. 

 

Subsequent Measurement 

 

The useful life of the intangible assets is assessed as either finite or 

indefinite. 

 

Intangible assets with a finite life is amortized over its useful life. 

 

The straight line method is adopted in the amortization of the expected 

pattern of consumption of the expected future economic benefits or service 

potential.

Notes to Financial Statements 

An intangible asset with indefinite useful lives is not to be amortized. 

 

Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life or an intangible asset not yet 

available for use were assessed for impairment whenever there is an 

indication that the asset may be impaired. 

 

The amortization period and the amortization method, for an intangible 

asset with a finite useful life, were reviewed at the end of each reporting 

period.  Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of 

consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset were 

considered to modify the amortization period or method, as appropriate, and 

were treated as changes in accounting estimates.  The amortization expense 

on an intangible asset with a finite life is recognized in surplus or deficit as 

the expense category that is consistent with the nature of the intangible 

asset. 

 

Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset were 

measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the 

carrying amount of the asset and were recognized in the surplus or deficit 

when the asset is derecognized. 

 

Research and development costs 

 

The University expenses research costs as incurred. Development costs on 

an individual project were recognized as intangible assets when the 

researcher can demonstrate: 

 

 The technical feasibility of completing the asset so that the asset will 
be available for use or sale 

 

 Its intention to complete and its ability to use or sell the asset 
 

 How the asset will generate future economic benefits or service 
potential 

 

 The availability of resources to complete the asset 
 

 The ability to measure reliably the expenditure during development 
 

Following initial recognition, intangible assets were carried at cost less any 

accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses. 

 

Amortization of the asset begins when development is complete and the 

asset is available for use.

It is amortized over the period of expected future benefit. 

 

3.6 Changes in accounting policies and estimates 
 

The University recognizes the effects of changes in accounting policy 

retrospectively.  The effects of changes in accounting policy were applied 

prospectively if retrospective application is impractical. 

 

The University recognizes the effects of changes in accounting estimates 

prospectively by including in surplus or deficit. 

 

The University correct material prior period errors retrospectively in the 

first set of financial statements authorized for issue after their discovery 

by: 

 

 Restating the comparative amounts for prior period(s) presented in 
which the error occurred; or 

 

 If the error occurred before the earliest prior period presented, 
restating the opening balances of assets, liabilities and net 

assets/equity for the earliest prior period presented. 

 

Fees and  fines  not related to taxes 

 

The University recognizes revenues from fees and fines, except those 

related to taxes, when earned and the asset recognition criteria were met.  

Deferred income is recognized instead of revenue if there is a related 

condition attached that would give rise to a liability to repay the amount.  

 

Other non-exchange revenues were recognized when it is probable that the 

future economic benefits or service potential associated with the asset will 

flow to the entity and the fair value of the asset can be measured reliably. 

 

Donations 

 

The University recognizes assets and revenue from donations when it is 

probable that the future economic benefits or service potential will flow to 

the entity and the fair value of the assets can be measured reliably. 

 

 

Goods in-kind were recognized as assets when the goods were received, or 

there is a binding arrangement to receive the goods.  If goods in-kind were 

received without conditions attached, revenue is recognized immediately.

PPSAS 23.95 

 

PPSAS 23.96

Notes to Financial Statements 

If conditions were attached, a liability is recognized, which is reduced and 

revenue recognized as the conditions were satisfied. 

 

On initial recognition, donations including goods in-kind were measured 

at their fair value as at the date of acquisition, which were ascertained by 

reference to an active market, or by appraisal.  An appraisal of the value 

of an asset is normally undertaken by members of the appraisal team of the 

university.  For many assets, the fair value were ascertained by reference 

to quoted prices in an active and liquid market. 

 

Transfers from other government entities 

 

Revenues from non-exchange transactions with other government entities 

and the related assets were measured at fair value and recognized on 

obtaining control of the asset (cash, goods, services and property) if the 

transfer is free from conditions and it is probable that the economic 

benefits or service potential related to the asset will flow to the University 

and can be measured reliably. 

 

3.7 Revenue from Exchange transactions 
 

Measurement of Revenue 

 

Revenue was measured at the fair value of the consideration received or 

receivable. 

 

Sale of Goods 

 

Revenue from the sale of goods is recognized when the significant risks 

and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer, usually on 

delivery of the goods and when the amount of revenue can be measured 

reliably and it is probable that the economic benefits or service potential 

associated with the transaction will flow to the University. 

 

Rental income 

 

Rental income arising from operating leases on properties is accounted for 

on a straight-line basis over the lease terms and included in revenue.

Notes to Financial Statements 

The annual budget is prepared on a cash basis and is published in the 

government website. 

 

A separate Statement of Comparison of Budget and Actual Amounts 

(SCBAA) was prepared since the budget and the financial statements were 

not prepared on comparable basis.  The SCBAA was presented showing the 

original and final budget and the actual amounts on comparable basis to the 

budget.  Explanatory comments are provided in the notes to the annual 

financial statements. 

 

The annual budget figures included in the financial statements were for the 

University system and therefore include the budget for its external 

campuses. The budgets for Special Trust Funds and Income Generating 

Projects were made and these budget figures were those approved by the 

governing body both at the beginning and during the year when collection 

exceeds the estimates first approved at the beginning of the year. 

 

 

4. Changes in Accounting Policies 
 

Eastern Samar State University adopted the following new accounting policies: 

 

4.1 Property, Plant and Equipment 
 

On January 2017, Eastern Samar State University adopted the PPSASs 

No. 17.  The new standard includes the requirement for recognition, 

measurement of Property, Plant and Equipment including its salvage value 

and is effective for adjustment of its existing recorded PPE.  This 

accounting change had significant impact on the University’s 

[consolidated] financial statements.

OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

 

 

Financial and Compliance  

 

Unreliable Cash in Bank-Local Currency, Current Account due to unreconciled difference 

between bank confirmation and GL balances, P45,841,164.63 

 

1. The year-end balance of the Cash in Bank-Local Currency, Current Account of 
the ESSU Campuses totaling P141,374,445.42 is unreliable due to the variance 

between the balances in the bank confirmation results and the balances in the 

General Ledger (GL) totaling P45,841,164.62 caused by the following: i) 

unadjusted reconciling items in the bank totaling P157,042.78, and in the books 

amounting to P44,579,335.13, and ii) unreconciled balances in the books 

reflected in the Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS) amounting to 

P1,418,872.27, thus affecting the fair presentation of the financial statements.

1.7 Verification of the records also revealed that the variance totaling P45,841,164.62 

was caused by the following deficiencies: (a) unrecorded reconciling items in the 

bank and book records amounting to P157,042.78 and P44,579,335.13, respectively; 

and (b) unreconciled balances in the books reflected in the BRS amounting to 

P1,418,872.27.  These reconciling items are shown in the table below:

1.8 The bank errors enumerated in items 1 and 2 above of Main Campus have already 
been formally communicated to the depository bank by ESSU, and the bank has yet 

to resolve these errors.  Likewise, the bank errors noted for Maydolong Campus were 

communicated to the bank, which has yet to act on the errors.  The bank error 

amounting to P1,800.00 of Guiuan Campus refers to an error in transposition of 

Check No. 0000029766 dated March 5, 2018 whereby the amount of P39,750.00 was 

recorded and debited by the bank as P37,950.00.  To this date, Guiuan Campus has 

yet to communicate this matter to the bank. 

 

1.9 The presence of the variance totaling P45,841,164.62 between the bank confirmation 
results and the GL at year end has affected the fair presentation of the Cash in Bank 

– Local Currency, Current Account in the financial statements of ESSU Campuses. 

 

1.10 We also noted during the audit that the Main Campus and the External Campuses did 
not regularly prepare or submit to the Audit Team their monthly BRS.  The number 

of days of delay incurred by ESSU in the submission of BRS ranged from one to 445 

days, as shown in Table 4 (see Annexes F1 to F5 for details).

1.11 An essential report required to be prepared on a monthly basis for the agency’s most 

valuable and vulnerable asset, the bank reconciliation aims to bring into agreement 

the cash balance per books and the cash balance per bank records.  It is through the 

BRS that the Accountant is able to compare the Cash in Bank book balance with the 

Bank Statements for possible errors and reconciling items, and to record these 

adjustments in either record where the discrepancies or reconciling items need to be 

taken up. 

 

1.12 For these reasons, the Audit Team wants to emphasize the importance of the timely 

preparation and submission of the BRS and their supporting documents in the 

immediate recognition and correction of possible errors either in the bank or in the 

book records of the Cash in Bank-Local Currency, Current Account.  The failure of 

the Accountants to submit the BRS on time has affected the timely evaluation by the 

Audit Team of the cash in bank accounts, and its communicating the results of 

verification to management. 

 

1.13 Audit during the year also disclosed the following: 

 

a. Main Campus did not maintain separate SLs for the two bank accounts 

maintained at the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP), namely: the Trust 

Receipt (TR) Funds and the CHED-HEDF under Fund Cluster 07 (TRs).  

Deposited in this TR account are funds from other Government/Non-government 

agencies transferred to ESSU for specific purposes.  The CHED-HEDF account 

is an educational assistance fund from the CHED, which should have been settled 

by now considering that ESSU has not availed of the fund since CY 2015. 

 

b. Main Campus did not maintain one GL for all bank accounts under Fund Cluster 

07 to summarize all these accounts maintained in different banks; 

 

c. Salcedo Campus maintains two GLs for bank accounts at DBP and Land Bank of 

the Philippines under Fund Cluster 01 (RAF) instead of preparing SLs for each 



44 

bank account and one GL for the account Cash in Bank-Local Currency, Current 

Account under FC 01. 

 

1.14 We recommended that the President require the respective Accountants of the 

campuses to: 

 

a. draw Journal Entry Vouchers (JEVs) to record the necessary adjustments 
in the books for valid reconciling items, and to conduct a thorough review of 

the other unreconciled items reflected in the BRSs and support the same with 

relevant documentary evidence; 

 

b. provide the bank with a copy of the BRS showing bank errors for 
adjustments pertaining to Maydolong and Guiuan Campus transactions, 

together with the formal request to correct the errors noted therein; 

 

c. submit BRS to the Audit Team on a regular basis pursuant to the pertinent 
provisions of PD No. 1445 and Section 7, Chapter 21 of the GAM for NGAs, 

Volume I; 

 

d. maintain a complete and properly accomplished SL for CHED-HEDF (Cash 
in Bank – Local Currency, Current Account) and Trust Receipt Funds of 

Main Campus, and for each bank account maintained at DBP and LBP 

under the Regular Agency Fund of Salcedo Campus; and 

 

e. prepare and maintain one GL for Cash in Bank – Local Currency, Current 
Account under Fund Cluster 07 (TR) in Main Campus and under Fund 

Cluster 01 (RAF) in Salcedo Campus recording all transactions for all bank 

accounts for easy control and monitoring. 

 

1.15 The following are the comments of the respective management of the campuses: 

 

a. Main Campus: The Officer-in-Charge (OIC)- Accountant’s response on the 
issued AOM are as follows: 

 

1. All the relevant documents will be gathered before making the necessary 
adjustments to record all valid reconciling items in the books. 

 

2. The officer in-charge will schedule a visit to ESSU’s depository bank to ask 
for an update on the agency’s request for the adjustment of errors noted in the 

BRS, and also to request for the timely issuance of bank statements to the 

agency.  Also, the delay in the issuance of the bank statement is one of the 

primary reasons for the late submission of report to the Audit Team.  Although 

bank statement for accounts maintained at DBP are usually forwarded to the 

OIC-Accountant’s registered email address, the corresponding passwords to 

open the account were not issued.  Hence, the agency will have to process 

another request to obtain a snapshot. 



45 

 

3. Subsidiary ledger for CHED HEDF account and for other funds from different 
Government/ Non-government are consistently updated and properly 

maintained by an assigned personnel from the Accounting Office. 

 

4. Files needed to reconcile the unaccounted balance in FC 06 and 07 are already 
inaccessible.  Also, the bank has already informed the OIC- Accountant that 

they can no longer issue copies of bank statement from prior years. 

 

5. Nevertheless, reconciliation of the discrepancy in the balance of the Cash in 
Bank- Local Currency, Current Account will be made. 

 

b. Maydolong Campus: Preparation and submission of JEVs will be made, while 
request for correction of bank errors is being finalized. 

 

c. Can-avid Campus: Monthly Reconciliation Statement for all funds will be 
submitted regularly. 

 

d. Salcedo Campus: A Journal Entry Voucher has already been prepared for stale 

checks under RAF and IGF amounting to P9,322.00 and P8,550.76, respectively 

on April 2021.  Whereas, the unreconciled balance amounting to P1.520,519.92 

has been unaccounted since year 2001.  With that, an adjusting entry cannot be 

drawn due to the absence of supporting documents. 

 

Moreover, regarding the preparation of Bank Reconciliation Statements, the 

campus was able to submit on time except for the months of March and April 

2020 since Eastern Samar was declared under ECQ.  

 

e. Guiuan Campus: Appropriate actions will be taken regarding the preparation 

and submission of BRS. 

 

1.16 As a rejoinder, the Audit Team emphasized the significance of the BRS as it serves 

as an effective method in establishing the accuracy of the Cash in Bank balances.  

More importantly, timely preparation of BRSs should be observed in order that errors 

are immediately detected and prompt adjustments in the books of accounts shall be 

made. 

 

Understated Receivable-Disallowance/Charges account due to various errors in recording, 

P3,333,357.70. 

 

2. The Receivables-Disallowances/Charges account of Main and External 
Campuses totaling P4,212,955.79 is not reliable due to: (a) the errors in 

recording as credits to the account for refunds made by the persons liable for 

disallowances; (b) the non-recognition in the books as receivables of 

disallowances with Notices of Finality of Decision (NFDs); and (c) the failure of 

the Accountant to maintain Subsidiary Ledgers for each of the disallowances 



46 

that have become final and executory, contrary to Section 111 of PD No. 1445,

provisions of the GAM for NGAs.

(2) The highest standards of honesty, objectivity and consistency shall 

be observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate

2.8 Review of the CY 2020 General Ledgers for the different ESSU Campuses disclosed 

that the Receivables-Disallowances/Charges account was credited for refunds made 

by the persons liable for their disallowances totaling P3,333,357.70 although there 

were no Notices of Settlement of Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges 

(NSSDCs) issued by the Audit Team to support these deductions from the account, 

thus understating the account balance by the same amount.

2.10 These errors effectively understate the account for Receivables - 

Disallowances/Charges as of December 31, 2020 by P3,333,357.70. 

 

2.11 Audit also revealed that disallowances totaling P2,455,903.83 which have reached 

finality as evidenced by the corresponding NFDs issued for the period CY 2019-

2020, were not recorded in the books and recognized as debits to Receivables - 

Disallowances/Charges, thus understating the account even further.

2.12 Furthermore, SLs were not maintained for each of the disallowances that have 

become final and executory as duly supported with NFDs issued by the Commission.  

These SLs were not maintained by Can-avid, Salcedo and Guiuan Campuses, thus, 

the accuracy of the reported balances could not be ascertained. 

 

2.13 We recommended that the President and the Campus Administrators of the 

various ESSU Campuses direct the respective Accountants to: 

 

a. prepare the adjusting journal entries to correct the erroneous recording of 
credits to the Receivables - Disallowances/Charges account; 

 

b. record credits and deductions to the Receivables – Disallowances/Charges 
account only when NSSDC is issued to support and acknowledge payments 

and settlements; 

 

c. furnish the Audit Team with a list of accountable officers who have settled 
their balances at the end of each month so that corresponding NSSDC can 

be prepared to acknowledge these settlements; 

 

d. record in the books as receivables the audit disallowances that have become 
final and executory as evidenced by duly issued NFDs; and 

 

e. maintain updated SLs and schedules for each of the disallowances that have 
become final and executory as evidenced by duly issued NFDs. 

 

2.14 The following are the comments of the respective management of the campuses: 

 

a. Main Campus: The bookkeeper already prepared an adjusting journal entry to 
correct the erroneous recording of credits to the Receivables – 

Disallowance/Charges account prior to the issuance of the NSSDC by COA.  The 



52 

adjustment is supported by JEV No. 01-21-02-008 dated February 28, 2021 

under the Internally Generated Fund (IGF).  The amount recorded in the JEV 

represents collection of receivables from disallowances from CY 2018 to 2020. 

 

The payment of disallowance made for Dr. Eva P. Palada as supported by NSSDC 

issued last March 19, 2021 is currently recorded in the Trust Liability account under 

IGF.  However, the corresponding Receivable – Disallowances/Charges account for 

the disallowance is recorded in the Regular Agency Fund (RAF).  Therefore, an 

adjustment to credit the said account will be made only upon the transfer of 

payment from IGF to RAF. 

 

The office already prepared Journal Entry Voucher No. 01-21-02-015 dated 

February 28, 2021 under RAF to record as receivables all disallowances that 

have become final and executory as evidenced by ND Nos. 2019-01-01 (2015), 

2019-02-01 (2015) and 2019-03-01 (2015) issued last February 24, 2021. 

 

b. Maydolong Campus: The management will direct the Accountant to maintain 
updated SLs for each disallowance and to make necessary adjustments to correct 

errors in recording. 

 

c. Can-avid Campus: Adjusting journal entry has already been prepared for the 
error made in the recognition/recording of the payments from the employees 

concerned for the disallowances. 

 

The NFD for the campus with an amount of P207,908.50 has already been 

recorded on December 31, 2020, however, it was inadvertently recorded in the 

IGF book of accounts instead of RAF.  To correct the same an adjusting entry 

was already prepared in February, 2021. 

 

As for the SLs for the Receivables – Disallowances/Charges account, these have 

already been submitted to the Audit Team. 

 

d. Salcedo Campus: The Accounting Office is already compliant with the 
recommendation stated in the AOM. 

 

e. Guiuan Campus: The management will direct the concerned personnel to 
comply with the recommendations.  As of date, the concerned personnel is 

preparing the necessary adjusting entries.  Copy of JEVs with supporting 

documents will be submitted.  Further, a subsidiary ledger and schedule for each 

disallowance will be maintained and submitted. 

 

2.15 As a rejoinder, the Audit Team will evaluate the documents submitted by the 

management in compliance with the Audit recommendations. 

 

 

Unreliable PPE account balance 



53 

 

3. The existence and accuracy of the Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) 
accounts valued at P1,003,795,272.02 as of December 31, 2020 could not be 

ascertained due to: (a) failure to conduct an inventory of PPE items totaling 

P359,482,287.99; (b) unreconciled discrepancy between the balances in the 

Statement of Financial Position (SFP) and the balances in the Report on the 

Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) totaling 

P4,603,277.11; (c) non-provision for depreciation of several PPE accounts 

aggregating P34,202,953.66; (d) unserviceable properties totaling P3,223,464.12 

are still recorded in the PPE account; (e) errors in the recording of semi-

expendable items totaling P639,005.85; and  the (f) absence of proof of 

ownership of the Land account valued at P5,503,985.50, thus affecting the fair 

presentation of the PPE accounts in the financial statements. 

 

3.1 Pertinent provisions of Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, are as follows: 

 

Chapter 10 

 

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT 

 

Sec. 3. Criteria for Recognition.  The cost of an item of PPE 

shall be recognized as assets if, and only if: 

 

a. it is probable that the future economic benefits or service 
potential associated with the item will flow to the entity; 

b. the cost or fair value of the item can be measured reliably; 
c. beneficial ownership and control clearly rest with the 

government; 

d. the asset is used to achieve government objectives; and 
e. it meets the capitalization threshold of P15,000. 

 

Under this recognition principle, an entity shall evaluate all its 

PPE costs at the time they are incurred.  These costs include initially 

to acquire or construct an item of PPE and costs incurred subsequently 

to add to, replace part of, or service the PPE. 

 

Sec. 4. Applying the Capitalization Threshold of P15,000.  

The capitalization threshold of P15,000 represents the minimum cost 

of an individual asset recognized as a PPE on the Statement of 

Financial Position.   

 

X x x. 

 

Sec. 27. Depreciation. PPE gradually loses its ability to 

provide service over the course of time.  Because of this, its cost needs 

to be distributed on a systematic basis over its useful life.  The 



54 

allocated cost is referred to as depreciation.  xxx.  The following are 

policies regarding depreciation of PPE: 

 

a. There are three factors an entity must consider in 
determining depreciation: 

 

1. Initial cost, 

2. Useful life, and 

3. Expected residual value at the end of its useful life. 

 

b. Except for land and not recognized heritage assets, all PPE 
shall be depreciated. 

 

c. Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use 
such as when it is in the location and condition necessary 

for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by 

management.  For simplicity and to avoid proportionate 

computation, depreciation shall be for one month if the PPE 

is available for use on or before the 15th of the month.  

However, if the PPE is available for use after the 15th of 

the month, depreciation shall be for the succeeding month. 

 

X x x 

 

Sec. 38. Physical Count of PPE. The entity shall have a 

periodic physical count of PPE, which shall be done annually and 

presented on the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and 

Equipment (RPCPPE) (Appendix 73) as at December 31 of each year.  

This shall be submitted to the Auditor concerned not later than January 

31 of the following year.  Equipment found at station and losses 

discovered during the physical count shall be reported to the 

Accounting Division/Unit for proper accounting/recording. 

 

X x x 

 

Sec. 40. Idle, Unserviceable and Fully Depreciated PPE. 

The following are the policies on idle, unserviceable and fully 

depreciated PPE:  

 

X x x 

 

d. All unserviceable property shall be reported in the 

Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable 

Property (IIRUP) (Appendix 74).  PPE reported in the 

IIRUP shall be dropped from the books by debiting 



55 

Impairment Loss-Property, Plant and Equipment (cost of 

the PPE less Accumulated Depreciation). 

 

Sec. 42. Accounting and Property Records to be 

maintained for PPE. The Chief Accountant shall maintain the 

PPELC for each category of PPE including work and other animals, 

livestock etc.  The PPELC shall be kept to record promptly the 

acquisition, description, custody, estimated useful life, depreciation, 

impairment loss, disposal and other information about the asset.  For 

check and balance, the Property and Supply Office/Unit shall likewise 

maintain PC for PPE in their custody to account for the receipt and 

disposition of the same.  The balance per PC shall be reconciled with 

PPELC maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit.  They shall also 

be reconciled with other property records like PAR. 

 

The following are the forms/reports necessary to account for 

PPE: 

 

X x x 

 

g. Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and 
Equipment (Appendix 73) – this form shall be used to report 

the physical count and condition of PPE by type as at a 

given date, including those which are unrecorded and those 

which could not be accounted for.  It shows the balance of 

PPE per property cards and per count and the 

shortage/overage, if any.  It shall be rendered by the 

Inventory Committee, on its yearly physical count of 

properties owned by the entity. 

 

3.2 Likewise, Section 79 of PD No. 1445 provides in part that: 

 

Section 79. Destruction or sale of unserviceable property. When 

government property has become unserviceable for any cause, or is no 

longer needed, it shall, upon application of the officer accountable 

therefor, be inspected by the head of the agency or his duly authorized 

representative in the presence of the auditor concerned and, if found 

to be valueless or unsalable, it may be destroyed in their presence.  If 

found to be valuable, it may be sold at public auction to the highest 

bidder under the supervision of the proper committee on award or 

similar body in the presence of the auditor concerned or other duly 

authorized representative of the Commission, x x x. 

 

3.3 Moreover, COA Circular No. 89-296 dated January 27, 1989 provides for the 

disposal procedures and reporting of disposable supplies or property.  Item VI(C) 

requires the agency head to file an application with the auditor concerned who shall 



56 

refer the same to the Technical Services Office which shall appraise the disposable 

equipment or property; conduct an inspection; and determine whether the subject 

property is deemed for disposal, among others.

3.7 The conduct of the annual physical inventory and the preparation of the inventory 

report are two essential procedures for checking the integrity of property 

custodianship, and for validating the accuracy of the book balances as well.  When 

the PPE balances in the physical inventory report and in the books are in agreement, 



58 

the users of the financial statements are assured that the PPE accounts are fairly 

presented. 

 

3.8 For these reasons, reconciliation of the accounting and property records should have 

to be undertaken on a regular basis; any discrepancies noted should be immediately 

addressed to arrive at correct and reliable reported balances. 

 

3.9 Likewise, the Audit Team was not invited to observe the physical counts carried out 

by the Main, Can-avid, and Guiuan Campuses ,which precluded the team from 

verifying the RPCPPEs submitted, contrary to Chapter 5 of the COA Training 

Handbook on Property and Supply Management System that: 

 

Witnessing the inventory-Taking 

 

The representative of the COA Auditor shall witness the physical 

inventory-taking conducted by the inventory committee xxx.  He 

should observe the actual process in order to assure himself of the 

fairness of the presentation of the financial statements. 

 

3.10 The observation and witnessing of inventory-taking are generally accepted auditing 

procedures, and enable the Audit Team to determine whether the proper procedures 

and recording were used in the count. 

 

b) Discrepancies between the balances in the Statement of Financial Position and in 
the RPCPPE totaling P4,603,277.11 

 

3.11 Evaluation of the RPCPPE submitted by the Supply Office as of December 31, 2020, 

and the related PPE account balances in the Statement of Financial Position showed 

discrepancies in amounts (total cost) per class of the recorded PPE totaling 

P4,603,277.11 in both Maydolong and Guiuan Campuses.  These variances are 

detailed in the table in Table 11:

3.12 In the table above, the Audit Team noted that Maydolong Campus reported the most 

substantial variance amounting to P4,575,077.11.  These totals have to be reconciled 

and corrected so that their recording in the financial statements is reliable. 

 

c) No provision of depreciation of several PPE accounts, P34,202,953.66 
 

3.13 Analysis of the GLs of the Guiuan and Maydolong Campuses also revealed that 

several PPE accounts amounting to P16,810,929.97 and P17,392,023.69 respectively, 

were not depreciated, thus misstating even further the PPE, Accumulated 

Depreciation and Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) accounts as at year end.  The list of 

the PPE items which were not depreciated is shown in the following table:

3.14 Further review of the depreciation schedules also disclosed several errors in 

calculating the depreciation expense of items, which deviated from the guidelines set 

out in the GAM for NGAs, Volume I.  These deviations and their effects in the 

financial statements are discussed in Table 13.

Exact dates (day, month and year) of 

acquisition are not indicated instead, only the 

year or month and year of acquisition are 

stated in the depreciation schedule and used 

in computing for the depreciation expense. 

Computation of depreciation expense during the 

year of acquisition is erroneous, as the exact date 

of acquisition is not considered (Sec. 27 (c), 

Chapter 10, GAM for NGAs Vol. I).  This 

understates the Depreciation Expense, 

Accumulated Depreciation and the 

Accumulated Surplus Accounts for the year. 

Guiuan 

Maydolong 

Several individual PPE items were excluded 

in the computation of the depreciation 

expense. 

The computation for the depreciation in bulk 

and omitting some items is erroneous, and only 

serves to understate the Depreciation Expense, 

Accumulated Depreciation and the 

Accumulated Surplus Accounts 
Main Depreciation expense is not computed per 

individual PPE item but on the PPE sub-

account totals. 

Maydolong No submission of Lapsing Schedule The reliability of the recorded depreciation 

expenses could not be ascertained due to the 

non-submission of the depreciation schedule 

thus precluding the Audit Team from verifying 

the recorded expense. 

 

3.15 The practice of not computing and providing for the depreciation, or the erroneous 

computation thereof, understates the expense and accumulated depreciation accounts, 

resulting in the incorrect valuation of PPE. 

 

d) Unserviceable properties totaling P3,223,464.12 of Guiuan Campus are still 
recorded in their books 

 

3.16 Audit also revealed that the Inventory and Inspection Reports of Unserviceable 

Property (IIRUP) of ESSU Campuses showed unserviceable properties valued at 

P4,337,519.12 ,which have remained undisposed as of the year end.  The summary 

is presented in Table 14 below. (See Annex H for details.).

3.17 Of these unserviceable properties, Main Campus has started the process of disposing 

of them through auction but this did not materialize due to lack of bidders.  The 

amount of P3,223,464.12 of Guiuan Campus remained in the PPE account while that 

of Maydolong Campus valued at P153,570.00 cannot be verified if they were 

derecognized in the PPE account because their IIRUP did not identify the fund 

clusters and property numbers, and the RPCPPE of the Campus has not yet been 

submitted. 

 

3.18 The value of the unserviceable properties which has remained in the PPE account of 

Guiuan Campus is misstated because this amount should have been dropped from the 

books in accordance with Section 40 of Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume 

I. 

 

3.19 Moreover, the inability of Management to facilitate the disposal of those 

unserviceable properties resulted in their accumulation to a significant number, 

thereby exposing them to further deterioration and decline in value especially those 

kept in the various areas of the premises which are exposed to the harsh elements of 

nature.  This has likewise deprived the University of the proceeds from the sale of 

these unserviceable items. 

  



62 

e) Error in the classification of tangible items totaling P639,005.85 
 

3.20 Audit also revealed that several semi-expendable items (with cost below P15,000.00 

per item) were recorded in the PPE accounts of Guiuan Campus.  These items totaling 

P639,005.89 are itemized in the table below, and the details are shown in Annex I.

3.21 The non-reclassification of these items to their appropriate semi-expendable 

accounts, and the non-recognition of the expense for their issuances have overstated 

the PPE accounts, and understated the expense accounts for the prior years.  These 

errors have understated the Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) account in the financial 

statements. 

 

f) Absence of proof of ownership of the Land account valued at P5,503,985.50 
 

3.22 Section 4 (8) of PD No. 1445 provides:

operations of any government agency shall be governed by the 

fundamental principles set forth hereunder, to wit:  

 

X x x

(8) Generally accepted principles and practices of accounting as well 

as of sound management and fiscal administration shall be observed, 

provided that they do not contravene existing laws and regulations. 

 

3.23 Along these lines, Article 1358, Chapter 3 of the Civil Code of the Philippines 

provides: 

 

Art. 1358. The following must appear in a public document:

 3.24 As of December 31, 2020, the Land account of the University reported a balance of 

P5,503,985.50 detailed as follows:

3.25 The absence of any deed or any instrument on paper conveying the use or ownership 

of land, or properties mentioned makes it difficult for ESSU to assert its right over 

the land to the exclusion of others in case its right is contested in court.  Considering 

that the parcels of land which the ESSU is in actual possession of remain untitled, it 

could be a subject of possible adverse claims by third parties that will be detrimental 

to the interest of the University, and that of the government. 

 

3.26 Moreover, since ESSU still does not hold titles to its properties, the amount of the 

Land account should have been dropped from the books, but the corresponding 

relevant disclosures must be provided in the Notes to Financial Statements so that the 

assets held by the University are adequately disclosed in the Notes. 

 

3.27 These audit observations are reiterations of the prior year’s audit observations since 

Management failed to implement the audit recommendations.  The amounts herein 

have been updated to include CY 2020 transactions. 

 

3.28 We recommended that the President require: 

 

a. the respective Inventory Committees from each of the campuses to 
undertake the mandatory annual physical count of the University’s assets 



64 

and develop adequate plans to carry out the same in an efficient and 

effective manner; 

 

b. the Supply Officers and Accountants to fast track the reconciliation of the 
balances of the inventory reports and books, and to make the necessary 

adjustments in both records to come up with correct and reconciled 

balances;  

 

c. the Accountants to compute for and provide depreciation on the assets of 
the University following the guideline provided under the GAM for NGAs, 

revise and update the depreciation schedules in conformity with the 

requirements of the GAM for NGAs Volume I, and adjust the 

understatement of Accumulated Depreciation in the previous years so that 

the PPE accounts are presented in their correct valuation; 

 

d. the respective Disposal Committees to immediately undertake the disposal 
of the unserviceable properties and equipment for all campuses in 

accordance with Section 79 of PD No. 1445, and item VI(C) of COA Circular 

No. 89-296.  Likewise, the Accountants and Supply Officers should make 

the necessary corrections and/or adjustments for the dropping off of these 

items in the books of accounts; 

 

e. the Supply Officer and Accountant of Guiuan Campus to determine the 
PPE items which do not meet the capitalization threshold of P15,000.00, and 

to prepare the necessary adjusting entries to reclassify those items to semi-

expendable inventories; 

 

f. the Accountants to fully disclose information in the Notes to Financial 
Statements regarding the ownership status of the properties of the 

University, together with the liens or encumbrances, if any; and 

 

g. the personnel concerned to exert extra efforts to obtain the Land titles and 
other documents evidencing ownership for ESSU Landholdings to have 

legal basis/title for the University for its continued use of the properties it 

presently occupies. 

 

3.29 The following are the comments of the respective management of the campuses: 
 

a. Main Campus: The campus was able to conduct a physical inventory of PPEs 
except for those that are categorized as Construction in Progress.  Moreover, the 

Accounting Office is already working on the re-computation of depreciation for 

all PPEs on a per item basis.  Necessary adjustments will be made to correct the 

recorded Accumulated Depreciation once reconciliation of the account is 

completed. 

 

As for the disposal of unserviceable properties, the Supply Officer already 

requested for a temporary warehouse where the said properties will be placed to 



65 

preserve it from further deterioration and decline in value until the next auction 

activity takes place. 

 

Lastly, the management has started working on the titling of the land holdings of 

the University.  At present, the management is in the process of securing 

documents such as certificate of land status, technical description and all other 

related documents from the concerned agencies. 

 

b. Maydolong Campus: Annual physical inventory count has already been started, 
whereas, reconciliations and adjustments of balances are being finalized.  As for 

the land titles, technical description and other supporting documents were 

requested from DENR. 

 

c. Can-avid Campus: The University had already made an application of Land 
Title, but unfortunately it was disapproved for it is a Timber Land.  With that, 

the management is planning to explore possible instrument like Tenurial 

Agreement between Salcedo Campus and DENR.  If there will be no changes in 

the status of Land Ownership, the Land Account will be dropped from the books 

before the end of this year. 

 

Meanwhile, according to the Supply Officer, physical count was not conducted 

since he is working with the BAC on the procurement documentation process. 

 

At present, the Supply Office is having an internal physical count with the 

Inventory and Disposal Committee and at the same time updating entries with 

complete date in the RPCPPE to come up with an accurate count before inviting 

some COA personnel to witness.  Target of completion of the inventory of PPE is 

on the second week of December 2021.  Adjustment on the computation of 

Depreciation Expenses will follow after the update on complete dates in the 

RPCPPE. 

 

d. Salcedo Campus: The University had already made an application of Land 
Title, but unfortunately it was disapproved for it is a Timber Land.  With that, 

the management is planning to explore possible instrument like Tenurial 

Agreement between Salcedo Campus and DENR.  If there will be no changes in 

the status of Land Ownership, the Land Account will be dropped from the books 

before the end of this year. 

 

Meanwhile, according to the Supply Officer, physical count was not conducted 

since he is working with the BAC on the procurement documentation process. 

 

At present, the Supply Office is having an internal physical count with the 

Inventory and Disposal Committee and at the same time updating entries with

on the second week of December 2021.  Adjustment on the computation of 



66 

Depreciation Expenses will follow after the update on complete dates in the 

RPCPPE. 

 

e. Guiuan Campus: The accountant and supply officer will submit adjustment 
reports on reclassifying items on RPCI and RPCPPE for reconciliation purposes.  

Complete details of each PPEs will be provided and guidelines under the GAM 

to properly compute the depreciation will be followed. 

 

Meanwhile, the agency will write another formal request to the DENR Central 

Office in lieu of land title. 

 

As of this writing, Guiuan Campus is in possession of; Deed of Sale, (RPT) 

Certificate of Ownership Tax Declaration, Survey Map & Technical Description, 

as proof of ownership. 

 

3.30 As a rejoinder, the Audit Team stressed the necessity of securing land titles, 

Proclamation Patents or Special Patents for Public Schools Sites in order to protect 

the interest of ESSU against any adverse claims of unscrupulous parties.  As of CY 

2020 no landholdings of ESSU are registered in its name. 

 

3.31 Moreover, the Audit Team urges Management to require the personnel concerned of 

the Accounting and the Supply Offices to prepare, maintain and reconcile appropriate 

reports.  Also, the conduct of inventory counts should be undertaken in accordance with 

pertinent rules and regulations.  Otherwise, the Audit Team maintains its position that 

the PPE account is unreliable. 

 

 

Net overstatement of Construction in Progress account balance, P4,051,675.97 

 

4. The balances of the Construction in Progress - Buildings and Other Structures 
account reported at P72,256,877.17 is not reliable due to: (a) errors in recording 

transactions in the Construction in Progress-Buildings and Other Structures 

account totaling P2,248,676.71; (b) unrecorded costs of the five ongoing 

infrastructure projects; and (c) the non-reclassification of the three completed 

projects in CYs 2019 and 2020 to their appropriate PPE accounts, contrary to 

PD No. 1445 and the GAM for NGAs, Volumes I and III. 

 

4.1 Sections 111 and 112 of PD No. 1445 state that: 

 

Section 111. Keeping of accounts. (1) The accounts of an agency 

shall be kept in such detail as is necessary to meet the needs of the 

agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish the information 

needed by fiscal or control agencies of the government. 

 



67 

(2) The highest standards of honesty, objectivity and consistency shall 

be observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate 

or misleading information. 

 

Section 112. Recording of financial transactions. Each government 

agency shall record its financial transactions and operations 

conformably with generally accepted accounting principles and in 

accordance with pertinent laws and regulations. 

 

4.2 Likewise, Section 15 of Chapter 2 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, provides that: 

 

Chapter 2 

 

GENERAL PROVISIONS, BASIC STANDARDS AND 

POLICIES 

 

Sec. 15. Fair Presentation.  The FSs shall present fairly the financial 

position, financial performance and cash flows of an entity.  Fair 

presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of 

transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with the 

definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and 

expenses set out in PPSAS.  The application of PPSAS, with 

appropriate disclosures, if necessary, would result in fair presentation 

of the FS. 

 

4.3 Finally, COA Circular No. 2020-01 dated January 8, 2020, which prescribes Volume 

III of the Revised Chart of Accounts (Updated 2019) for NGAs, defines the 

Construction in Progress - Buildings and Other Structures as follows:

Account Code 

Normal Balance 

Description 

Construction in Progress-Buildings and Other Structures 

10698030 

Debit  

This account is debited to recognize the accumulated cost or 

other appropriate value of buildings and other structures which 

are still in the process of construction or development.  This 

account is credited upon reclassification to the appropriate 

buildings and other structures account upon completion, and/or 

adjustments. 

 

4.4 Our review of the Statements of Financial Positions of ESSU Campuses show that 

the Construction in Progress-Buildings and Other Structures account has a balance of 

P72,256,877.17, as illustrated in the table below:

4.7 According to the OIC-University Accountant, the variances are attributed to the 

following: 

 

1. Item 1 is an error in recording as credit to the Construction in Progress account 
(instead of Miscellaneous Income account) the amount of liquidated damages 

imposed against the contractor for the delays incurred in completing the project; 

 

2. Items 2 to 5 are errors in recording as additions to Construction in Progress 
account, the remaining incomplete and unpaid portions of all ongoing contracts 

in CYs 2018 and 2019; and 

 

3. Item 6 pertains to a balance in the Construction in Progress account under FC 05 
(IGF) which is unaccounted for, and which the Accounting Office cannot 

reconcile due to the absence of supporting documents. 

 

b) Unrecorded costs of actual accomplishments totaling P664,615.07 of five 

ongoing infrastructure projects which understate the account 

 

4.8 Moreover, audit also revealed that the Accounting Office did not recognize the 

additional costs of the actual accomplishments as of the year end of the five ongoing 

infrastructure projects of ESSU, thus understating the Construction in Progress 

account by P664,615.07, as illustrated in Table 20.

c) Error in classifying three completed projects in CYs 2019 and 2020  

 

4.9 Finally, verification of the Report on Government Programs/Projects/Activities 

submitted at year end by ESSU disclosed that three infrastructure projects completed 

in CYs 2019 and 2020 were not reclassified to their proper PPE accounts, thus 

overstating the Construction in Progress account by P2,467,614.33 and understating 

the related PPE accounts by the same amount.  The details of these transactions are 

summarized in Table 21:

4.10 The existence of these errors in the Construction in Progress -Buildings and Other 

Structures account, and the improper classification of completed infrastructure 

projects have resulted in the overstatement of the Construction in Progress account 

and the understatement of the related PPE accounts, thus ultimately affecting the fair 

presentation of the related accounts in the financial statements. 

 

4.11 We recommended that the President direct the OIC-University Accountant to 

prepare and record the necessary adjusting entries to correct the balances of the 

Construction in Progress-Buildings and Other Structures, as well as the PPE 

accounts in order to fairly present these accounts in the financial statements.  

 

4.12 The following are the comments of the respective management of ESSU:   

 

The OIC- Accountant will gather all the relevant documents to support the adjustment 

for the errors and non-reclassifications noted in the AOM.  

 

With regard to the unrecorded costs of the five on-going infrastructure projects, the 

officer in-charge would like to comment that it was due to the non-issuance/ late 

submission of Monthly Physical Status of Government PPAs to the office.  Recording 

of certain amount at yearend without documentary basis will further make the CIP 

balance unreliable. 

 

Nevertheless, the OIC-Accountant commits to include all the necessary adjustments 

in the CY 2021 reports to reflect the correct balance of Construction in Progress-

Buildings and Other Structures.

Unreliable Accounts Payable account, P3,260,159.01 

 

5. The Accounts Payable account of the Main and Maydolong Campuses totaling 
P3,260,159.01 is not reliable due to: (a) the recording of payables totaling 

P2,140,706.41 which are not properly documented; (b) the booking up of 

payables for undelivered procurements in  CY 2020 totaling  P45,050.00;  and  

(c) the reporting of variances in the balances appearing in the Statement of 

Financial Position and in the Financial Accountability Reports (FARs), contrary 

to Sections 111 and 119 of PD No. 1445 and pertinent provisions of the GAM for 

NGAs, Volumes I and III. 

 

5.1 Pertinent provisions of PD No. 1445 state:

be observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate 

or misleading information. 

 

Section 119. Accounting for obligations and expenditures. All

expenses set out in PPSAS.  The application of PPSAS, with 

appropriate disclosures, if necessary, would result in fair presentation

obligations were incurred. 

 

5.3 COA Circular No. 2020-001 dated January 8, 2020, which prescribes the updated CY

5.5 Of the recorded payables, a total of P2,140,706.41 was not supported with complete 

documentation.  This has precluded the Audit Team from validating whether the 

transactions established bona fide obligations of ESSU, or whether these obligations 

have been properly authorized.  The transactions are itemized as follows:

5.7 Review of the financial statements and the Financial Accountability Reports (FARs) 

also revealed discrepancies in the reported figures of the due and demandable 

accounts payable, as follows:

5.8 The conflicting figures reported by management in its financial reports, and the 

considerable variances between the reported figures ranging from P8,282.22 to 

P299,221.82 bolstered the observation that the reported year-end balances of the 

Accounts Payable account may not be validly and properly recorded thus, affecting 

their fair presentation in the financial statements. 

 

5.9 We recommended that the President require the Accountants concerned to: 

 
a. submit the documents to support all records in the Accounts Payable 

account to prove that claims are correct, valid and properly authorized; 



75 

b. record as Accounts Payable only those obligations which are already due 
and demandable as evidenced by the actual receipt of goods; and 

c. prepare the necessary adjustments to reflect the correct balances of 
Accounts Payable in order to present fairly the financial positions of the 

Main and Maydolong Campuses. 

5.10 The following are the comments of the respective management of the campuses: 

 

a. Main Campus: The management have already submitted all documents to 
support the submitted Schedule of Accounts Payable in CY 2020 to the Audit 

Team, except for claims that have been cancelled recently. 

 

Under FC05, claims of both Ocean Breeze Diner and Pacifica Agrivet Supplies 

amounting to P13,300.00 and P10,750.00 respectively were cancelled in April 

2021.  Meanwhile, another claim from Ocean Breeze Diner in the amount of 

P38,700.00 was inadvertently included in the submitted Schedule of AP but was 

actually paid in December 2020 as evidenced by Check No. 73171411.   On 

the other hand, the office has not yet receive any request either from Pagapos 

Arts and Events or Procurement Services for the replacement of their staled 

checks. 

 

b. Maydolong Campus: The management will require the Accountant to observe 
proper, correct and accurate preparation of financial reports. 

 

5.11 As a rejoinder, the Audit Team stresses that only correct, valid and properly 

authorized claims should be recorded as Accounts Payable by to ensure accuracy and 

fair presentation of reported financial data of ESSU. 

 

 

Non-disclosure of relevant information in the Notes to Financial Statements 

 

6. Relevant information on the reported balances in the consolidated Statement of 
Financial Position (SFP) of Inventories, PPE, Other Payables and Biological 

Assets accounts amounting to P96,494,634.68; P1,003,795,272.02; P5,022,663.21; 

and P1,595,460.00, respectively, and of various accounts reported on the

6.4 Review of the consolidated and per campus Statements of Financial Position as of 

December 31, 2020 of ESSU, in comparison with the Notes to FS, revealed the 

following: 

 

a. The disclosures required for the Inventories, PPE and Other Payables accounts 
were not provided.  Likewise,  there were no disclosures at all on the reported 

financial statement balances of the Biological Assets account. 

 

The required disclosures for the Inventories account which were not presented in 

the Notes to Financial Statements include item d of Section 12, Chapter 8 of the 

GAM for NGAs, Volume I.  Likewise, items b and c of Section 48, Chapter 10 

of the same Manual were not provided for the PPE account; while the details of 

the Other Payables account were not indicated; instead, only the amount 

pertaining to Guiuan Campus was presented. 

 

b. On a per campus analysis, the required disclosures of the various accounts in the 
Statement of Financial Position and Statement of Financial Performance totaling 

P4,800,034.36 of the Main and Maydolong Campuses were not presented in their 

respective Notes to Financial Statements.  The details of these accounts are 

presented in Table 26.

6.5 The importance of the Notes to Financial Statements, which help provide additional 

information and clarify the items presented in the financial statements, cannot be 

overemphasized.  The non-disclosure of the relevant information of the Inventories, 

PPE, Other Payables and Biological Assets accounts in the Notes to Financial 

Statements has restricted the Audit Team from completely evaluating these accounts.  

Considering the substantial amounts reported, their adequate disclosure in the Notes 

could have considerably aided the users of the Financial Statements in understanding 

the repercussions of the changes of these accounts. 

 

6.6 We recommended that the President require the Accountants concerned to 

strictly comply with the pertinent provisions of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, 

regarding the disclosure of relevant information in the Notes to Financial 

Statements for all accounts in the financial statements so that these are fairly 

presented. 

 

6.7 The following are the comments of the respective management of the campuses: 

 

a. Main Campus: The following were noted during the reconciliation of the 
accounts mentioned in the AOM: 

 

1. Due to Other Funds under Internally Generated Fund (IGF) pertains to a refund 
of cash advance for honorarium for NSTP.  This amount must be deposited 

back to TRF account. 

 

2. Breeding Stocks account amounting to P330,000.00 pertains to an adjustment 
to set-up the inventory for the month, while the Livestock and Other 

Consumable Biological Assets account amounting to P417,600.00 and 

P10,800.00 respectively pertain to the recorded donated asset under the 

Business Related Fund (BRF).  On the other hand, the Due to Other Funds in 

the amount of P190.00 refers to a remittance of JO Personnel during the period. 

 

3. The Due to Other Funds with a total of P1,861,750.43 under Trust Receipt Fund 
(TRF) must be reconciled further in order to determine the 

composition/breakdown of the amount.  Reconciliation of this account will be 

made as soon as possible. 

 

Hereafter, disclosure of all relevant information in the Notes to FS for all 

accounts in the financial statements will be ensured. 

 

b. Maydolong Campus: Disclosure of relevant information in the Notes to FS for 
the mentioned accounts will be made. 

 

 

Unliquidated cash advances, P1,579,350.92 



81 

 

7. Cash advances granted to several accountable officers at ESSU totaling 
P1,579,350.92 remained unliquidated as of December 31, 2020 because of several 

deficiences noted relative to their granting, utilization and liquidation, contrary 

to the pertinent provisions of Chapter 6 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I; and 

COA Circular No. 97-002. 

 

7.1 Sections 15 and 30 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, state: 

 

Chapter 6 

 

DISBURSEMENTS 

 

Sec. 15. Cash Advance for Payroll. Advances for Payroll 

shall be granted to Regular Disbursing Officers for payment of 

salaries, wages, honoraria, allowances and other personnel benefits of 

officials and employees. Xxx.  Liquidation of the advances shall be 

made within five (5) days after the end of the pay period.  Any 

unclaimed salaries/allowances shall be refunded and issued official 

receipt to close the account. 

 

Sec. 30. Cash Advance for Specific Purpose/Time-Bound 

Undertaking. Cash advance for specific purpose/time-bound 

undertaking shall be granted only to duly authorized accountable 

officer/special disbursing officer.  It shall be accounted for in the 

books of accounts as “Advances to Special Disbursing Officer.”  It 

shall be liquidated by the accountable officer within a specified 

period.  Any unutilized cash advance shall be refunded and an OR 

shall be issued to acknowledge collection thereof. 

 

7.2 Also, Items 4 and 5 of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 provide: 

 

4. GRANTING AND UTILIZATION OF CASH ADVANCES 

 

X x x 

 

4.1.3 A cash advance shall be reported on as soon as the 

purpose for which it was given has been served. 

 

4.1.8 The Accountant shall obligate all cash advances 

granted. He shall see that cash advances for a 

particular year are not used to pay expenses of other 

years. 

 

5. LIQUIDATION OF CASH ADVANCES  

 



82 

5.1 The AO shall liquidate his cash advance as follows:  

 

5.1.1 Salaries, Wages, etc. - within five (5) days after each 

fifteen (15) day/end of the month pay period.  

 

5.1.3 Official Travel - within sixty (60) days after return to 

the Philippines in the case of foreign travel or within 

thirty (30) days after return to his permanent official 

station in the case of local travel, as provided for in 

EO 248 and COA Circular No. 96-004. 

 

Failure of the AO to liquidate his cash advance within the 

prescribed period shall constitute a valid cause for the

5.7 When a cash advance is no longer needed or has not been 

used for a period of two (2) months, it must be returned to or 

refunded immediately to the collecting officer. 

 

5.8 All cash advances shall be fully liquidated at the end of each 

year.  Except for petty cash fund, the AO shall refund any 

unexpended balance to the Cashier/Collecting Officer who 

will issue the necessary official receipt. 

 

5.9 At the start of an ensuing year, a new cash advance may be 

granted, provided that a list of expenses against the previous

7.14 Review of the accounting records of Can-avid Campus also disclosed that a cash 

advance for payroll granted in the current year for the purpose of paying the services 

rendered of NSTP instructors in CY 2019.  This expense was not recognized when it

occured in CY 2019.  Instead, it was recognized as expense in CY 2020, contrary to

To recognize the liquidation of the CA 

 

7.15 During the audit, it was also noted that several cash advances were not properly 

recorded under their proper Advances account.  For example, the Advances for 

Payroll account was debited for the advances for school fees/book allowance of the 

TES/Tulong Dunong grantees instead of recording the cash advances under the 

Advances to Special Disbursing Officer account.  Likewise, advances for official 

travels were debited to the Advances to Special Disbursing Officer account instead 

to the Advances to Officers and Employees account. 

 

7.16 These unsettled cash advances at year end and the frequent delay on the liquidation 

of the same do not only violate the provisions of laws, rules, and regulations but could 

also expose these funds to the risks of misappropriation or loss. 

 

7.17 Moreover, the errors in the recording of the Advances accounts and the non- 

recognition of expenses in the year to which they properly belong have affected the 

fair presentation of the affected accounts in the financial statements. 

 

7.18 We recommended that the President: 

 

a. instruct all accountable officers and employees concerned to liquidate 
immediately their outstanding cash advances in accordance with the 

pertinent provisions of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, and COA Circular 



90 

No. 97-002, otherwise, withhold the payment of any money due them in 

accordance with Section 37 of PD No. 1445; 

 

b. instruct all accountants to properly account for the Advances accounts in 
accordance with the pertinent provisions of Section 6 of the GAM for NGAs, 

Volume I; 

 

c. instruct all accountable officers and employees to stop using cash advances 
granted in the current year to pay for the expenses incurred in prior years; 

and 

 

d. direct all officials and employees to strictly adhere with the laws, rules and 
regulations pertaining to the granting, utilization, and liquidation of all cash 

advances. 

 

7.19 The following are the comments of the respective management of the campuses: 

 

a. Main Campus: As of date, only the P528,664.04 cash advance balance granted 
to Salcedo Campus for school fee allowance of Tulong Dunong Scholars remains 

unliquidated.  The Accountant of Salcedo Campus will be contacted to enforce 

payment of the remaining balance through a salary deduction scheme. 

 

The Internal Control Unit pledged to intensify the monitoring of advances to 

ensure that all cash advances are liquidated on time.  Henceforward, the 

management will strictly adhere with the laws, rules and regulations pertaining 

to the granting, utilization, and liquidation of all cash advances. 

 

b. Maydolong Campus: Management directed the accountable officers to comply 
with the proper granting and liquidation of cash advances per Chapter 6, Volume 

I of the GAM for NGAs, and COA Circular No. 97-002. 

 

c. Can-avid Campus: From now on, cash advances will be liquidated on time by 
consistently issuing demand letters and forced the payee or concerned employee 

to liquidate their cash advances on time. 

 

Cash advance in the current year that is intended for payment of claims of prior 

years will no longer be granted and the provisions stated in this AOM in the 

granting, utilization, and liquidation of all cash advances will be followed. 

 

d. Salcedo Campus: The unliquidated balance for Advances for Payroll amounting 

to P12,742.00 was already refunded and liquidated on January 2021.  While the 

P420,944.88 balance for Advances to Officers and Employees has been 

unaccounted since year 2003.  A request to write-off the amount has been 

submitted but still pending for approval for the lack of records and supporting 

documents.  As for the delayed liquidation of cash advances granted to the 



91 

Disbursing Officer, the Cashier assured to follow the grace period on settlement 

and liquidation of all her cash advances. 

 

7.20 As a rejoinder, the Audit Team emphasized that provisions of law, rules and 

regulations on the grant, utilization and liquidation of cash advances, including their 

liquidations by year end, shall be strictly enforced.  Management’s compliance with 

the audit recommendation will also be regularly monitored. 

 

 

Long outstanding Payables, P318,049.22 

 

8. Accounts Payable, totaling P318,049.22 as of December 31, 2020, have remained 
long outstanding for more than two years, and were not reverted to the 

Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) or the Cumulative Results of Operations – 

Unappropriated (CROU), contrary to Section 98 of PD No. 1445, DBM-COA 

Joint Circular No. 99-6 dated November 13, 1999, and Executive Order (EO) 

No. 87 dated August 13, 2019, thus immobilizing funds that could have been 

useful for other operating needs of ESSU. 

 

8.1 Section 98 of PD No. 1445 states:  

 

Section 98. Reversion of unliquidated balances of accounts 

payable. The Commission, upon notice to the head of agency 

concerned, may revert to the unappropriated surplus of the general 

fund of the national government, any unliquidated balance of accounts 

payable in the books of the national government, which has been 

outstanding for two years or more and against which no actual claim, 

administrative or judicial, has been filed or which is not covered by 

perfected contracts on record.  This section shall not apply to 

unliquidated balances of accounts payable in trust funds as long as the 

purposes for which the funds were created have not been 

accomplished. 

 

8.2 Section 3.1 of DBM-COA Joint Circular No. 99-6, dated November 13, 1999, which 

provides for the implementing guidelines of the reversion of certain accounts payable 

to the cumulative operations, now Accumulated Surplus/Deficit, of the national 

government, reads as follows: 

 

3.1 All documented A/Ps of all funds which have remained 

outstanding for two (2) years, shall be reverted to the Cumulative 

Results of Operations – Unappropriated (CROU), except for on-going 

capital outlays projects. 

 

8.3 Furthermore, the Office of the President issued EO No. 87 dated August 13, 2019 

reiterating the aforesaid regulation, and thus directed the reversion of all Accounts 



92 

Payable which have been outstanding for at least two years for which no actual 

administrative or judicial claims have been filed: 

 

Section 1. Reversion of Documented Accounts Payable. All 

documented accounts payable for fiscal year 2016 and years prior 

thereto shall be reverted to the Accumulated Surplus or Deficit of the 

General Fund, or the Cumulative Result of Operations of the National 

Government.  Henceforth, all documented accounts payable which 

remain outstanding for at least two years, for which no actual 

administrative or judicial claim has been filed, shall be subject to 

automatic reversion. 

 

Section 2. Treatment of Undocumented Accounts Payable.  All 

accounts payable which are undocumented or not covered by 

perfected contracts on record, regardless of the year in which they 

were incurred, shall automatically be reverted.  The recording of 

undocumented accounts payable in the books of accounts of agencies 

shall be strictly prohibited. 

 

8.4 The Audit Team’s verification of the Schedules of Accounts Payable (SAP) as of 

December 31, 2020 disclosed that Accounts Payable amounting P318,049.22 have 

remained outstanding for more than two years, thus unnecessarily immobilizing 

funds that could have been useful for the operating needs of ESSU: 

 
Table 37. Schedule of long outstanding Accounts Payable 

 

8.5 The long outstanding Accounts Payable consisted of a substantial amount of 

P300,426.00 claims without proper documentation, while the rest are unclaimed 

payables.  These claims therefore overstate the Accounts Payable. 

 

8.6 We recommended that the President require the Accountants concerned to 

review the recorded claims in the Accounts Payable, and revert to the 

Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) account all claims which have remained 

outstanding for two (2) years or more, and for which no valid claims have been 

filed.

a. Main Campus: Whereas, claims under FC07 pertains to honoraria and tax 
refund which remains unclaimed due to several reasons.  These amounts were 

previously lodged in the Trust Liability account but subsequently booked up in 

the AP account.  Settlement of these claims is expected during the current year. 

 

Also, the office would also like to note that claims with partial deliveries are 

already considered due and demandable payables thus, the reason why these 

claims were included in the submitted Schedule of Accounts Payable for CY 

2020.  Clarifications on the proper charging to Accounts Payable must be 

discussed to all concerned personnel. 

 

Nevertheless, management will strictly comply with the provisions stated in this 

AOM.  Furthermore, effect necessary adjustments will be immediately made for 

all the transactions mentioned above. 

 

b. Maydolong Campus: The claimants will be contacted to know whether they are 
still willing to claim their receivables and if not, it will be reverted to 

Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit).  Lastly, necessary adjustments will be made for 

claims which are outstanding for two years or more and revert it to Accumulated 

Surplus/ (Deficit). 

 

 

Internally Generated Fund used to pay Honoraria, P6,510,794.29 

 

9. Honoraria were paid to the Graduate School faculty for CY 2020 totaling 
P6,510,794.29 despite ESSU incurring a deficit, resulting in the use of its 

Internally Generated Fund (IGF) to cover the deficiency. 

 

9.1 Section 3 (t) of the CHED Memorandum Circular No. 20, s. 2011 defines the 

following terms in accordance with its operational meaning, thus: 

 

x x x 

 

t) Self-liquidating units - refers to a unit which offer auxiliary 

services, primarily to internal clients and, secondarily, to external 

clients of the SUC.  These are units operating by authority of the 

BOR/T.  These units are initially funded out of the Special Trust Fund 

(STF), however, they generate revenue to sustain their operations. 

Any subsidy extended to it must have the approval of the BOR/T.  xxx 

(example: in some SUCs without the Advanced Education budget 

from GAA, the Graduate School is a self-liquidating unit under the 

management of the SUC, but the income from tuition fees of 

undergraduate students are not used to provide for the needs of the 

graduate school, xxx.  Therefore, any deficiency in the collection of 

tuition fee is shouldered by the students as additional cost if the 



94 

enrollment falls below the minimum number of students per class; 

otherwise the subject offered is dissolved). 

 

9.2 The Advanced Education Program is one of the major programs of ESSU under the 

General Appropriations Act (GAA) FY 2020.  To attain the desired organizational 

outcomes of this program, ESSU offers various Master and Doctorate programs. 

 

9.3 Classes under these graduate programs are held during weekends, and are handled by 

qualified faculty members, as well as visiting lecturers.  Compensation is in the form 

of honoraria considering that the teaching loads are outside of the regular office 

hours, and the services rendered are in excess of the regular teaching loads. 

 

9.4 The operation of the Advanced Education Program in the Main Campus is funded by 

the Agency budget under the GAA, in addition to the income from the tuition and 

other school’s fees collected from the students.  All the other ESSU campuses that 

offer the Advanced Education Programs are self-liquidating units. 

 

9.5 For FY 2020, the allotted budget for personnel services of the Advanced Education 

Program was P1,309,200.00, authorized through FY 2020 GAA (RA No. 11465) and 

Advice for use of Personal Services Allotment No. 2020-06-0001; and 

P11,682,858.51 under the ESSU IGF, approved by the ESSU Board of Regents 

(BOR).  The details of the approved budget and disbursements for CY 2020 are 

summarized in Tables 38 and 39 below:

9.7 However, an analysis of the actual collections from the agency appropriations and 

school fees, and the actual expenditures for personnel services under the Advanced 

Education Program for the same year revealed a deficit of P6,510,794.29.  The 

summary of these comparisons is presented in Table 41 below and is discussed in 

detail in Annexes K-1 to K4:

9.8 As shown in the table above, the total honoraria paid to the Graduate School faculties 

totaled P14,094,239.79.  However, the total collections from income for CY 2020 

amounted to P7,583,445.50 only, so that the payment for the deficit totaling 

P6,510,794.29 was taken out of the IGF of ESSU.  This substantial deficit, likewise 

indicates that the income from tuition and other school fees of the Graduate School 

programs cannot cover the honoraria of University faculty, and pay for other 

necessary expenses for its operations.  As a solution, the deficiency of funding was 

charged against the income from the undergraduate programs. 

 

9.9 Audit also disclosed the following: 

 

1. Honoraria attributable to the charges from the prior years’ services of some 
faculty members in the Graduate School of Salcedo Campus were paid in the 



96 

current year, out of the CY 2020 income of the Graduate School Program, thus 

overstating the deficit even more; and 

 

2. The main factors which contributed to the huge amount of the honoraria paid to 
the Graduate School faculty are the selection of faculty members with higher or 

senior academic rank, and the number of units for teaching load assigned to them, 

considering that the honoraria granted to the faculty members are computed using 

the Prime Hourly Time Rate based on their basic salaries. 

 

9.10 All these deficiencies show a lack of internal control policies over the way 

government funds and resources are managed at the Graduate School Program of the 

University. 

 

9.11 We recommended that the President direct the Dean of the Graduate School to: 

 

a. consider equally qualified faculty members with junior academic ranks to 
handle graduate courses, and limit the number of units of loads assigned to 

senior faculty members to comply with the budget; and 

 

b. approximate/allocate the amount of honoraria that shall be paid to the 
Graduate School professors with the corresponding tuition and other fees 

that can be charged from, together with the budget allocation from the GAA. 

 

9.12 We also recommended that the President direct the: 

 

a. Budget Officers to properly charge the obligations for the honoraria of the 
Graduate School faculty to the funds to which they are directly attributable; 

and 

 

b. Accountants to ensure that funds are actually available to pay for the 
honoraria and other needs of the Graduate School before payments are 

processed, and eventually disbursed in compliance with the rules and 

regulations. 
 

9.13 The following are the comments of the respective management of the campuses: 

 

a. Main Campus:  
 

1. Payments of honoraria for CY 2020 were charged against the allotted GAA 
for Advanced Education Program and to the Internally Generated Fund 

approved by the ESSU BOR in addition to the actual collections made for the 

period.  

 

2. For current year transactions, both the Accountant and the Budget Officer 
commit to make sure to properly charge claims of honoraria and other needs 



97 

of Graduate Schools to the funds which they are directly attributable and to 

ensure that sufficient fund is available to pay the said claims. 

 

3. Hereafter, the management commits to exert effort to comply promptly with 
all the recommendations stipulated in the AOM. 

 

b. Salcedo Campus:  
 

1. The Graduate School of Salcedo Campus have a total of P425,987.23 total 
disbursement. This was not all charged to the Total Collection for CY 2020 

(P288,208.00).  This disbursement where charged from various collections 

under comprehensive exam fee, defense fee, petition fee, and collection from 

previous year.  

 

2. For CY2019-2020 we only used P38,686.71 to pay the honorarium covering 
2nd Sem. SY 2019-2020 and 1st Sem. 2020-2021.  The amount of 

P260,826.10 total disbursement to pay the honorarium from the previous 

school year was charged to previous collection and approved reprogrammed 

balance of graduate program from CY2019.  We also charged P20,149.72 

from the petition fee, and a total of P106,325.00 charged to Comprehensive 

Exam and Defense Fee. 

 

3. We have attached a summary of disbursement indicating where we have 
charged the various disbursement of the Graduate School of ESSU-Salcedo 

Campus. 

 

4. The remuneration of all the faculty handling subjects in the Graduate School 
of ESSU-Salcedo is fixed at a flat rate of Instructor 1.  Therefore, both senior 

and junior faculties earn the same rate for their remuneration.  Further, we see 

to it that we assign subjects to faculty based on their field of specialization 

and special training in their Doctorate or Master’s degree. We assign 

Doctorate degree holders to handle subject in the Ph.D.  Curricular Program.  

In the Masteral courses, we also assign faculty with Doctorate Degree to 

handle subjects therein. 

 

c. Guiuan Campus:  
 

The agency will assign qualified junior faculty to undertake subject loads. 

Should there be no option to assign the subject load, we will encourage the 

faculty to waive the honorarium thru petition classes. 

 

9.14 The Graduate Schools of the Main, Salcedo and Guiuan Campuses of ESSU are self-

liquidating units to the extent that the budget for Advanced Education, from the GAA 

cannot fully support their operations.  As such, it has to be stressed that only the 

income collected from school fees of the graduate programs should be utilized to 



98 

support their operations and no income from the undergraduate programs should fund 

the operations of the Graduate School. 

 

 

Unauthorized payment of Representation Allowance and Transportation Allowance, 

P120,000.00 

 

10. The Dean of the College of Engineering was allowed to receive Representation 
Allowance and Transportation Allowance (RATA) totaling P120,000.00, 

contrary to Item 4.7 of National Budget Circular No. 404 dated May 29, 1989, 

thereby rendering the payments unauthorized and without legal basis. 

 

10.1 Item 4 of the National Budget Circular No. 404 dated March 29, 1989, provides the 

following among others: 

 

4.0 GENERAL GUIDELINES 

 

The following personnel/officials of state universities and 

colleges are hereby entitled to receive the monthly commutable 

transportation and representation allowances equivalent to chiefs of 

divisions: 

 

X x x 

 

4.7 The designated Deans of the Graduate Program and the 

Highest Education Program could be equated to positions 

higher than chiefs of divisions.  Department Heads (also 

by designation and equivalent to chiefs of divisions) may 

be allowed provided a SUC has different 

departments/colleges, each one having at least four 

degree programs with each program differentiated from 

each other by 33% (the distinction of the programs to be 

certified to the DECS Bureau of Higher Education). 

(emphasis ours) 

 

10.2 The Enrolment Data for the 2nd Semester of Academic Year (AY) 2019-2020 and 1st 

Semester of AY 2020-2021 (see Annexes L & M), as certified correct by the Director 

of Admission, Records and Registration and recommended for approval by the Vice 

President for Academic Affairs, showed that the baccalaureate programs of the 

College of Engineering (COE) of Main Campus offered only three (3) curricular 

programs, namely:  Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering, Bachelor of Science 

in Computer Engineering and Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering in CY 

2020. 

 

10.3 However, audit of the CY 2020 transactions on RATA disclosed that the Dean of the 

College of Engineering of the Main Campus, who was ineligible to receive RATA 



99 

under Section 4.7 of National Budget Circular No. 404 was granted RATA for the 

period January to December 2020, totaling P120,000.00, as summarized in the 

following table:

TOTAL P120.000.00 

 

10.4 We recommended that the President direct the Accountants to: 

 

a. stop the practice of granting RATA to ESSU’s officials who do not qualify 
for the allowance in accordance with Section 4.7 of National Budget 

Circular No. 404 dated May 29, 1989; and  
 

b. require the official concerned to refund the unauthorized amount received 
by her. 

 

10.5 The management of Main Campus commented that: 

 

In respect to the issued AOM, the management has granted RATA to the Dean of 

College of Engineering on the basis that she was designated as Head of the Master in 

Engineering Major in Civil Engineering Program in addition to her original 

designation as Dean of the College of Engineering during Academic Year 2020.  The 

Master in Engineering Major in Civil Engineering Program is one of the programs 

under the Graduate Studies hence it is recognized distinctively from the three 

baccalaureate programs under the College of Engineering.  Copies of her 

memorandum will be submitted for the Audit Team’s review and verification. 

 

10.6 As a rejoinder, the contention of Management that the grant of RATA to the Dean of 

Engineering is proper, as she was also designated to head a Graduate School program 

- Master of Engineering, aside from being the Dean of three undergraduate programs 

under the College of Engineering, does not hold water considering that the operations 

of the Master of Engineering program is under the over-all control and supervision 



100 

of another College Dean, who is the Dean of the Graduate School.  It has to be 

stressed that the College of Engineering and the Master in Engineering, Major in 

Civil Engineering Program belong to different levels of education, that is, the Higher 

Education and the Graduate Course (NBC No. 404), respectively.  They are separate 

and distinct from each other, hence, should not be considered as one 

department/college, as far as the grant of RATA is concerned. 

 

Deficiencies in the implementation of Faculty and Staff Development Program 

 

11. The grant of benefits under the Faculty and Staff Development Program (FSDP) 
of ESSU had several deficiencies, as follows: a) assistance totalling P54,025.12 

was granted despite the lapse of the grantees’ scholarship grant tenure; and b) 

payment of claims amounting to P60,248.06 with incomplete documentary 

requirements, contrary to ESSU Board of Regents (BOR) Resolution No. 46, s. 

2008; Section IV of the FSDP Revised Rules and Regulations (RRR); and the 

pertinent provisions of PD No. 1445 and COA Circular No. 2012-003.

11.7 Review of the implementation of ESSU Faculty and Staff Development Program 

(ESSU FSDP) for CY 2020 showed that there were privileges under this program that 

were given to grantees whose scholarship grant tenure has lapsed, or has been 

extended beyond the authorized period, the details of which are presented in Tables

No. IV thereof that scholarship grant tenures under the program are without 

extension.  In fact, the contract signed by the grantee with ESSU specifies the period 

within which the scholar is to enjoy the scholarship. 

 

11.9 Audit also revealed the following:  

 

a. Claims for tuition fees under Plan C of the program amounting to P60,248.06 
were paid by ESSU despite the incomplete supporting documents submitted by 

the grantee contrary to the ESSU Faculty and Staff Development Contract for 

Plan C. Details are as follows:

7, 2020 under the Internally Generated Fund of Can-avid Campus. 

 



104 

c. The vital role of the FSDP Committee in overseeing the proper implementation 
of the program is emphasized in the FSDP RRR.  However, there was actually 

no formal FSDP Committee created for the purpose. 

 

11.10 We recommended that the President formally establish the FSDP Committee to 

ensure the proper implementation of ESSU Faculty and Staff Development 

Program (ESSU FSDP) so that funds for the program are adequately 

safeguarded; 

 

11.11 We also recommended that the President direct the Accountants concerned to: 

 

a. ensure that payments of claims relative to the scholarship grant under the 
ESSU FSDP are in accordance with the BOR Resolution No. 46, s. 2008, 

FSDP Revised Rules and Regulations, and the pertinent provisions of PD 

No. 1445; 

 

b. properly charge expenses against the account to which they are directly 
related and authorized; and 

 

c. require the faculty members concerned to refund the unauthorized amount 
received by them. 

 

11.12 The following are the comments of the respective management of the campuses: 

 

a. Main Campus: The attention of the employees concerned has been called upon 
receipt of the AOM but it was only last May 10 that Dr. Eva Balbada submitted 

necessary documents pertaining to the subject which includes the approved letter 

to the President requesting for an extension and a letter of explanation from her 

school stating the reason for extension of her oral defense to December 2020.  

Also, Ms. Evelyn A. Corado has submitted a letter stating the reasons for 

extension.  Lastly, the organization of the FSDP Committee is still in the pipeline 

as all designations and assignments are yet to be approved by the council. 

 

b. Maydolong Campus: Lacking documents have already been submitted. 
 

c. Can-avid Campus: The lacking registration form for the claimed 
reimbursement of school fees stated in the Audit Observation Memorandum will 

be submitted. 

 

From now on, complete documents will be required and attached for each claim 

of reimbursements under the scholarship program. 

 

The payment for the registration fee for a webinar amounting to P2,000.00 was 

accurately taken from the fund Training Expenses as evidenced by attached 

processed BUR slip and disbursement voucher.  However, it was only 



105 

inadvertently recorded as scholarship expense in the preparation of Check 

Disbursement Journal. 

 

With this, proper recording of every financial transactions and continuous 

adherence to the cited provisions and COA circular in this audit observation 

memorandum will be observed. 

 

11.13 As a rejoinder, the Audit Team maintains that the requests for extension of the 

scholarship grant tenure by the faculty members concerned, though approved by the 

ESSU President, is without authority given that the related provisions of the BOR 

Resolution No. 46, s. 2008, and the FSDP Revised Rules and Regulations clearly 

state that the tenure of the scholarship grants under the program is without extension. 

 

11.14 The Audit Team also stressed the need of establishing the FSDP Committee which 

will oversee the proper implementation of the scholarship program.  Once 

established, the committee should review and assess whether revising the RRR is 

necessary, particularly on the provision of “tenure of scholarship grant’.  Conditions 

and terms should be laid out on when an extension of tenure of the scholarship should 

be allowed to ensure that such is appropriate.  Lastly, submission of complete 

documents must be ensured prior to the processing of payments of FSDP-related 

claims. 

 

Irregular and overpayment of Magna Carta benefits for Public Health Workers 

 

12. The grant of compensation-related Magna Carta benefits to Public Health 
Workers of ESSU had several deficiencies, as follows: (a) hazard pay amounting 

to P8,013.25 granted to employees even while on a fifteen-day vacation leave; (b) 

overpayments totaling P19,543.74, and (c) payment of subsistence and laundry 

allowances amounting to P23,880.00 taken from the IGF, contrary to the 

pertinent provisions of the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) and 

Department of Health (DOH) Joint Circular (JC) No. 1, s. 2016, as well as the 

DBM-DOH JC No. 1, s. 2012; and of the Commission on Higher Education

12.3 Also, Section 18 of CHED Memorandum Order No. 03, series of 2001, the Revised

Provided, that all fiduciary fees shall be disbursed for the 

specific purposes for which they are collected. 

 

12.4 Moreover, the fundamental principles governing the financial transactions and 

operations of any government agency are as enunciated in Section 4 of PD No. 1445,

12.6 Audit of the above transactions revealed the following: 

 

a) Hazard Pay amounting to P8,013.25 was granted to a Public Health Worker 
(PHW) who was on an authorized fifteen-day Vacation Leave. 

 

12.7 A PHW at Guiuan Campus was allowed to claim hazard pay even while she was on 

an authorized vacation leave for fifteen days, and the summary of the transactions is 

as follows: 

 
Table 47. Hazard Pay granted to PHW on Vacation Leave 

 

 

 

 

 

b) Overpayments totaling P19,543.74 were noted for Hazard Pay, Subsistence 
Allowance and Laundry Allowance. 

 

12.8 Review of the transactions also showed that the payments made for hazard pay, 

subsistence and laundry allowances were not in accordance with the prescribed rate 

per day of actual service, which resulted in the overpayment of P19,543.74.  Tables 

48 to 51 illustrate the overpayments made to PHWs of ESSU.

12.14 The foregoing transactions are considered irregular use of government funds.  

 

12.15 Moreover, the following were also observed: 

 

a) Claims for hazard pay, subsistence and laundry allowances for December 2020 
in Main Campus have no attached DTRs as supporting documents.  Likewise, 

the disbursement voucher to support Check No. 0000110215 dated June 29, 2020 

of Guiuan Campus covering hazard pay differential due to step increment was 

not supported with documentary requirements, contrary to COA Circular No. 

2012-001 dated June 14, 2012; and 

 

b) In Guiuan Campus, the Subsistence Allowance account was recognized instead 
of the Laundry Allowance account. 

 

12.16 The payment of the claims, which were not adequately supported with documentary 

requirements emphasizes the breakdown in controls over disbursements, and 

indicates non-compliance with existing rules and regulations; while the erroneous 

recognition of account misstates the related accounts in the financial statements. 

 

12.17 We recommended that the President direct the Accountants concerned to: 

 

a. require the employees concerned to refund the unauthorized amounts they 
received; 

 

b. strictly adhere to the pertinent provisions of the DBM-DOH Joint Circular 
No. 1, s. 2016; DBM-DOH Joint Circular No. 1, s. 2012; and Section 18 (d) 



112 

of the CHED Memorandum Order No. 3, series of 2001, on the grant of 

compensation-related Magna Carta benefits to PHWs of ESSU; 

 

c. submit the DTRs to support the claims of hazard pay, subsistence and 
laundry allowances for December 2020 of Main Campus and the 

documentary requirements on the claim for hazard pay differential under 

a disbursement voucher with Check No. 0000110215 dated June 29, 2020 of 

Guiuan Campus; and 

 

d. correctly recognize Laundry Allowance account for expenses which directly 
relate thereto . 

 

12.18 The following are the comments of the respective management of the campuses: 

 

a. Main Campus: After verifying the management’s record on the computation of 
hazard pay, subsistence and laundry allowance, following data were determined: 

 

1. The computation for hazard pay for January 2020 was indeed erroneous.  The 
amount paid was not the hazard pay differential but was actually the basic pay 

differential. 

 

2. The additional P600.00 allowance released as subsistence allowance 
differential, in addition to the P900.00 regular rate, was based on a 30-calendar 

pay computation.  In total, each PHW is entitled to a P1,500.00 per month, or 

P50.00 per day 30 days.  However, provisions of the DBM and DOH Joint 

Circular No. 1, series of 2012 provided that the allowance shall be at P50.00 

for each day actual full-time service or P25.00 for each day of actual part-time 

service.  The computation is usually based on a twenty-two (22) working days 

excluding Saturdays and Sundays. 

 

3. The computation made for the Laundry Allowance was similar to that of 
subsistence allowance except that the amount allowed under the provisions is 

only P150.00 per month. 

 

In relation to the above-mentioned data, the management will require all 

concerned employees to refund the unauthorized amounts they received.  In 

addition, immediate submission of the lacking DTRs will be required to 

support the claims of hazard pay, subsistence and laundry allowance for 

December, 2020. 

 

Hereafter, computations and validity of claims as well as the completeness of 

the supporting documents will be checked before processing payment for the 

above-mentioned allowance. 

 

b. Can-avid Campus: The amount of P7,500.00 taken from the Internally 
Generated Fund was approved by the ESSU Board of Regents for use in payment 



113 

for the increase of Subsistence and Laundry Allowance that was not included in 

the allocated budget under Regular Agency Fund (GAA 2020) for the said 

allowance. 

 

Since, payment for the increase of the subsistence and laundry allowance taken 

from Internally Generated Fund violates certain provisions, the practice of 

paying the said allowance using the IGF will no longer be observed  

 

c. Salcedo Campus: Adjustment on the computation of laundry allowance will be 
made from January 2021 to present.  Any excess payment will be deducted this 

month of June 2021. 

 

However, with regard to the charges from IGF, subsistence and laundry 

allowance for the month of August and December 2020 were obligated by the 

Budget Officer under IGF since these were not included in the preparation of 

Cash Advance submitted to Main Campus, and also it was already the last month 

of 2020.  Instead of preparing additional Cash Advance, it was decided to charge 

the amount under IGF with the knowledge that there is an approved budget for 

subsidy and laundry allowance.  Moreover, the subsistence and laundry 

allowance were charged to IGF since the GAA subsidy is limited only to P900.00 

and P125.00 per month, respectively. 

 

d. Guiuan Campus: The agency will require the employee concerned to refund the 
unauthorized amount received.  The documentary attachments/ requirements will 

be thoroughly checked conforming to the provisions of the joint circular of 

DBM, DOH & CHED on the grant of compensation related to Magna Carta 

Benefits to PHWs of ESSU.  Further, the agency shall see it that Laundry and 

Subsistence Allowance be accounted separately. 

 

12.19 As a rejoinder, the Audit Team maintains that the management practice of charging 

the subsistence and laundry allowances against the IGF when the agency budget from 

the GAA is inadequate, is without legal basis and should be discontinued.  Likewise, 

require the personnel concerned to refund the unauthorized amounts they received.  

Finally, the management should ensure that the requirement for the Magna Carta 

benefits of PHWs of ESSU is provided for in the agency budget. 

 

 

Overpayment of Daily Travel Expense, P24,219.43 

 

13. Claims for travel expenses totaling P24,219.43 exceeded one hundred percent 
(100%) of the difference between the actual accommodation expenses and the 

accommodation component of the prescribed Daily Travel Expense rate, 

contrary to Section 5 of Executive Order (EO) No. 77, thus constituting an 

irregular expenditure as set forth in COA Circular No. 2012-003, dated October 

29, 2012.

13.1 Section 5 of EO No. 77 provides:

(excluding expenses for valets, room attendants, laundry, 

pressing, haircuts, and similar services furnished by hotels) in 

excess of the accommodation component of the DTE may be 

allowed, but in no case shall the difference exceed one 

hundred per cent (100%) of such component of the 

prescribed DTE rate, and only upon: 

 

(i) Submission of certification by the agency head or authorized 
representative as absolutely necessary in the performance of 

an assignment; and 

 

(ii) Presentation of bills and receipts.  A certification or affidavit 
of loss shall not be considered as appropriate replacement for 

lost bills and receipts. 

 

13.2 In addition, Paragraph 3.0, COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012, 

describes irregular expenditures as follows: 

 

3.0 “IRREGULAR” EXPENDITURES 

 

3.1 Definition 

 

The term “irregular expenditure” signifies an expenditure 

incurred without adhering to established rules, regulations, 

procedural guidelines, policies, principles or practices that have 

gained recognition in laws.  Irregular expenditures are incurred if 

funds are disbursed without conforming with prescribed usages 

and rules of discipline.  There is no observance of an established 

pattern, course, mode of action, behavior, or conduct in the 

incurrence of an irregular expenditure.  A transaction conducted 

in a manner that deviates or departs from, or which does not 

comply with standards set is deemed irregular.  A transaction 

which fails to follow or violates appropriate rules of procedure is, 

likewise, irregular. 

 

13.3 Audit of the travel claims of ESSU for CY 2020 disclosed reimbursements for Daily 

Travel Expenses (DTE) covering actual accommodation expenses (hotel/lodging and 

meals) amounting to P24,219.43, exceeding more than one hundred percent (100%) 

of such component of the prescribed DTE rate.  Details are shown in Table 53.

13.4 Inasmuch as the total amount of P24,219.43 claimed was over the allowable ceiling 

for the DTE, this constitutes an irregular transaction defined in Paragraph 3.0, COA 

Circular No. 2012-003, and as such, should be refunded. 

 

13.5 We recommended that Management require the accountable officers concerned 

to refund the unauthorized amount received by them.  Henceforth, claims for 

official travels should be paid in accordance with the rates prescribed in EO No. 

77. 

 

13.6 The management of Guiuan Campus commented that they will adhere to the 

provisions pertaining to claims for travel expenses such as the prescribed rates and 

required documentary attachments set forth in EO No. 77.

Lack of supporting documents and incomplete information in the payment of excess load 

honoraria, P7,389,392.37 

 

14. Honoraria totaling P7,389,392.37 expended for teaching overload of the Main 
Campus’ Graduate School professors for CY 2020 could not be properly 

evaluated due to the management’s failure to support the disbursements with 

complete documentation, and to indicate in the payrolls the data needed to 

arrive at the Prime Hourly Teaching Rate (PHTR), contrary to Section 4(6) of 

PD No. 1445, Item 5.7.2 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 and pertinent provisions 

of Civil Service Commission Memorandum Circular (CSC MC) No. 10, s. 2020 

dated May 7, 2020. 

 

14.1 Section 4 of PD No. 1445, provides:

14.4 Section 7.13.1.2 of the Position Classification and Compensation Scheme for Faculty 

Positions in State Universities and Colleges provides for honoraria for teaching 

overload as an additional compensation for faculty members in the graduate program 

who render services in excess of their regular teaching load.  It, moreover, provides 

that the honoraria shall be based on the Prime Hourly Teaching Rate (PHTR) which 

shall be computed as follows:

14.5 Audit of the CY 2020 transactions disclosed that the Main Campus allowed the 

payments of honoraria for teaching overloads of their Graduate School professors 

even if documentary requirements supporting the claims were incomplete.  The 

related disbursement vouchers were only supported with payrolls; approved Daily 

Time Records (DTRs); and certifications indicating that the faculty members 

attended their classes for the period indicated; and that all deliverables required from 

them were completely submitted, issued by the Program Heads and the Dean of the 

Graduate School.

14.7 Considering that the ESSU has implemented a blended learning system due to the 

declaration of the State of Public Health Emergency in relation to the COVID-19 

pandemic, the faculty members were not required to physically report to ESSU on a 

regular basis.  A Work-from-Home arrangement was adopted as classes and 

interactions with the students were conducted through online platforms.  However, 



121 

review of the DTRs accomplished by the faculty revealed regular entries of time of 

arrival and departure on scheduled classes of the faculty members, while no entries 

of “on Work from Home” were reflected on those dates which the faculty members 

were to be on a Work-from-Home arrangement.  It bears stressing that, as a rule, time 

entries reflected in the DTRs are records of the time of arrival and departure from the 

work station and that those dates when the professors were not required to physically 

report to ESSU “On Work-From Home” schedule, should have been reflected in the 

DTRs.  As such, the veracity of entries reflected in the approved DTRs is doubtful. 

 

14.8 Further, it was not clear who from among the Graduate School faculty members were 

required to physically report to ESSU, or to be on a Work-from-Home arrangement 

on a particular time or date since there were no internal rules and regulations 

submitted to the Audit Team governing the alternative work arrangements 

supposedly adopted and implemented by the University. 

 

14.9 Clearly, the absence of any of the required documents to support the claims for 

honoraria casts doubt on the propriety and validity of the payments made against 

government funds.  

 

14.10 On the other hand, review of the payrolls covering the same grant of honoraria to the 

faculty members of the Graduate School of the ESSU-Main Campus indicates that 

the PHTR used as basis in computing honoraria, cannot be ascertained due to lack of 

the essential data to compute for the PHTR, such as: (1) the Professors respective 

plantilla position, (2) annual basic salary and (3) highest educational attainment.  The 

following table summarizes the data provided in the payrolls submitted by the ESSU 

for the honoraria claims which the Audit Team has examined: 

 
Table 55.  Honorarium of Professors in the Graduate School

Rate per

No. of Hrs.

the Period

14.11 In examining the data provided in the sample payroll, there is no way can it be 

determined whether the PHTRs used in calculating the honoraria claims are correct.  

Thus, the essential data to compute for the PHTR should have been provided to arrive 

at the correct computation of the claims for honoraria. 

 

14.12 We recommended that the University President direct the: 

 

a. Dean of the Graduate School and professors concerned to submit properly 
accomplished DTRs, and their accomplishment reports and work from home 

schedules, and other supporting documents as provided under pertinent 

rules and regulations to establish the propriety of their claims for honoraria;  

 

b. Accountant to ensure the complete documentation of money claims before 
they are processed for payment.  Thereafter, existing accounting and 

auditing rules and regulations on the submission of documentary 



122 

requirements to support the claims for honoraria should be strictly adhered 

to; and 

 

c. Dean of the Graduate School to indicate in subsequent payrolls the vital data 
in order to derive a faculty member’s PHTR.  Moreover, provide the Audit 

Team with the revised payrolls for claims of the Graduate School professors’ 

honoraria for CY 2020 for review and evaluation.  

 

14.13 The following are the comments of the management of the Main Campus: 

 

The Management takes cognizance of the audit observation particularly on the 

needed documentary requirements, on the computation of the Prime Hourly Teaching 

Rate, and on the proper way of filling-up of DTRs and reflecting entries thereon, as 

well as the other recommendations pertaining to the claim of honoraria among 

graduate school faculty.  Moreover, the Management expressed their commitment to 

adhere with the recommendations of the Audit Team in keeping with the shared 

values of accountability and good governance. 

 

 

Payment of final claims for infrastructure projects with incomplete documentation 

 

15. ESSU paid the final claims of the contractors of four infrastructure projects 
totaling P5,880,364.28 without requiring from these contractors the submission 

of As-Built Plans and warranty securities, contrary to the provisions of the 2016 

Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (RIRR) of RA No. 9184, otherwise 

known as the Government Procurement Reform Act; and COA Circular No. 

2012-001 and related laws and regulations.

15.4 Post-audit of the transactions for CY 2020 revealed that ESSU paid the final billings 

of contractors of four infrastructure projects of the various ESSU Campuses without 

requiring them to submit As-Built Plans and warranty securities as required by law, 

and the details of these transactions are summarized in Table 56:

15.5 An as-built plan is a revised drawing created and submitted by a contractor after a 

construction project is finished.  They contain any changes made from the initial 

drawings during the construction process, and provide an exact rendering of the 

building and property as it appears upon completion.  It is these drawings that help 

technical personnel in the inspection and evaluation of the contract to determine 

whether the plans and specifications contained in the program of work agreed upon 

in contract was indeed implemented. 

 

15.6 The Manual of Procedures for the Procurement of Infrastructure Projects prepared by 

the GPPB requires the submission of warranty to ensure that the contractor will 

correct structural defects and failures.  The defects liability period, a one-year period 

after the completion of the project, is observed until final acceptance by the Procuring 

Entity.  During this period, the contractor shall post a warranty security in the form 

and amount prescribed in Section 62.2.3.3 of the 2016 RIRR of RA No. 9184.  In 

turn, the government will return to the contractor its Performance Security and issue 

the Certificate of Final Acceptance. 

 

15.7 For these reasons, the importance of requiring the submission of these documents is 

emphasized to support all final claims of contractors of the infrastructure projects 

undertaken by ESSU, thereby enabling the Audit Team to properly evaluate whether 

the existing rules and regulations on the payments of these transactions are adhered 

to, and ensuring that the interests of government are protected. 

 

15.8 We recommended that the President direct the: 

 

a. Director of the Infrastructure Projects Development and Engineering 
Services (IPDES) to require the submission of the As-Built Plans and 

warranty securities of the four (4) infrastructure projects to the Audit Team 

for review; and  

 

b. OIC-Accountant to process only those claims of infrastructure projects with 
complete documentary requirements. 



127 

 

15.9 The following are the comments of the respective management of Main Campus:  

 

The Head of IPDES Office respond on the observation regarding the submission of 

As-Built Plans: 

 

The guidelines and process of the submission of as-built plans were already 

incorporated in our revised proposed IPDES Office Operation Manual. 

 

On the case regarding the warranty securities for each project: 

 

1. Repair/ Rehabilitation of Multi-Purpose Building at ESSU Can-avid 
 

The contractor has not yet requested for final acceptance for the said project 

therefore, it is still covered by the performance bond.  Travel to Can-avid Campus 

was already scheduled to facilitate this. 

 

2. Completion of the Guest House at ESSU Maydolong & Construction of Graduate 
School Building Phase 2 

 

ESSU, through the IPDES Office is yet to issue a Certificate of Final Acceptance 

to RV Construction & Supply and Lobrinos Consolidated Construction 

(contractor) on June 15, 2021 and July 6, 2021 respectively.  That is a year after 

the completion of the said projects, provided that the contractor has made sure 

that Sec. 62.2.2 of the 2016 Revised IRR of RA 9184 was complied.  Therefore, 

the project is still covered by the Surety Bond which stands “within the period of 

up to final acceptance of the project”. 

 

3. Filling of ESSU Mini Park at the ESSU Main Campus 
 

The final acceptance of this project is still on October 10, 2021.  However, since 

the sole proprietor of DT Estaron Engineering passed away, based on the GPPB 

NPM No. 102-2015 concluding statement which states that “Hence, its obligation 

under the contract is necessarily extinguished”.  Therefore, the process involving 

the issuance of Certificate of Final Acceptance to contractor and Warranty Surety 

Bond from Contractor will not take place. 

 

Recommendations will be incorporated in the revised proposed IPDES Office 

Operation Manual based on the 2016 Revised IRR of RA No 9184. 

 

15.10 As a rejoinder, the Audit Team stressed that management should adhere strictly to 

the provisions of the 2016 RIRR of RA No. 9184 and that the submission of 

documentary requirements evidencing management’s compliance with the said 

recommendation is highly anticipated.

Payment of RATA with incomplete documentation, P2,671,000.00 

 

16. Payments for the Representation Allowance and Transportation Allowance

requirements, as prescribed in Item 5.2 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated

16.3 Finally, pertinent provisions of the ESSU BOR Resolution No. 44, s. 2011, adopting 

the Certificate of Service Rendered (CSR) for Teaching Personnel and Other 

Identified ESSU Officials, state the following: 

 

B. Coverage and Mechanics

16.6 The payments of the RATA claims with insufficient supporting documents indicate 

breakdown in controls over disbursements, and non-compliance with rules and 

regulations set forth not only by ESSU but by other government institutions as well. 

 

16.7 We recommended that the management strictly adhere to the pertinent 

provisions of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 and Section 4(6) 

of PD No. 1445 in the payment of RATA claims. 

 

16.8 The foregoing recommendations are without prejudice to the issuance of Notice of 

Suspension/Disallowance, if warranted. 



132 

 

16.9 The following are the comments of the respective management of the campuses: 

 

a. Main Campus: lacking DTR/CSR attachments for other RATA claims in CY 
2020 will be forwarded as soon as the copies of DTRs/CSRs from the HRMO 

are secured. 

 

Hereafter, evaluation will be made of the eligibility of the claimants to receive 

RATA as prescribed in Section 4.7 of National Budget Circular No. 404, COA 

Circular 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 and Section 4 of the Presidential Decree 

No. 1445. 

 

b. Maydolong Campus: Lacking attachments/documents for RATA claims were 
already submitted for compliance. 

 

c. Can-avid Campus: Daily Time Record was prepared and submitted by the 
payee however, it was only inadvertently not attached to the disbursement 

voucher prior to the submission of the paid voucher to COA.  With this, DTR 

for March, June, September, & November, 2020 as required in this AOM as 

attachment for the claims of RATA will be submitted. 

 
From now on, accurate and complete documents will be attached before 

processing the claims of RATA and continuous adherence to the cited provision 

of this memorandum will be observed. 

 

d. Salcedo Campus: Dr. Marina S. Apilado, the previous Campus Administrator, 
will submit the DTR and the certification as soon as she can. 

 

e. Guiuan Campus: The agency, along with other campuses has agreed to attach 
the CSR as documentary attachment to RATA Claims.  The agency will be more 

careful on filing vouchers to avoid omission of important documentary 

attachments. 

 

16.10 As a rejoinder, the Audit Team stressed that provisions of law, rules and regulations 

pertaining to claims for RATA should be strictly enforced.  Also, management’s 

compliance with the audit recommendations will be monitored regularly.

17.3 Item 1.2.4 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012, enumerates the 

following documentary requirements for claims of travel allowance/expense:

17.4 Finally, COA Circular No. 2020-01 dated January 8, 2020 prescribing Volume III of 

the Revised Chart of Accounts (Updated 2019) for NGAs defines the Traveling 

Expense account as follows: 

 



135 

Account Title 

Account Number 

Normal Balance 

Description 

Traveling Expenses – Local 

50201010 

Debit 

This account is debited to recognize the costs 

incurred in the movement/transport of 

government officers and employees within the 

country.  This includes amount paid/incurred for 

fare/transportation, travel per diems, and all 

other related expenses.  This account is credited, 

at year end, to close to the Revenue and Expense 

Summary account, and/or adjustments. 

 

17.5 Audit of the TEVs of Main and External Campuses of ESSU for CY 2020 showed 

that there are claims totaling P2,467,005.69 that did not bear the signatures of proper 

officials, and were not supported with complete documentation, but were actually 

paid by ESSU, in contravention of the above-quoted laws.  The details of these claims 

are presented in Annexes Q to U and summarized hereunder:

17.6 The payment of claims with insufficient supporting documents and without 

signatures of proper officials renders the transaction doubtful as to its validity, 

propriety and legality. 

 

17.7 Audit for the same period also disclosed the following: 

 

a. Individuals who were not employed with ESSU were allowed to submit claims 
for travel to official events, details of which are as follows:

17.8 The above charges should have been properly recorded in their correct classification 

as defined under the GAM for NGAs, Volume III, so that these accounts are fairly 

presented in the financial statements for the period. 

 

17.9 We recommended that the President instruct the Accountants to: 

 

a. ensure the approval of proper officials and complete documentation of money 
claims before they are processed for payment.  Thereafter, compliance with the 

documentary requirements prescribed under existing accounting and 

auditing rules and regulations should be strictly adhered to; 

 

b. ensure that expenses charged against the Traveling Expense account should 
exclusively pertain to official travels of ESSU officials and employees; and 

 

c. properly charge expenses against the account to which they are directly 
related and authorized to. 

 

17.10 The following are the comments of the respective management of the campuses: 



137 

 

a. Main Campus: The OIC-Accountant’s response on the issued AOM are as 
follows: 

 

1. Upon verification of the copy of DVs maintained by the Accounting Office, it 
was confirmed that it all bear the signature of both the Accountant and the 

President.  It might have been that the in-charge have unnoticeably attached 

and forwarded the duplicate unsigned copies to the Audit Team.  Anyhow, fully 

signed copies will be submitted to replace the previously submitted unsigned 

DVs. 

 

2. All the concerned employees will be required to submit their copies of Itinerary 
of Travel and Certificate of Travel Completed to the Accounting Office, and 

the same will be forwarded to the Audit Team the soonest possible time. 

 

3. Certificate of Appearance is not required when processing a cash advance for 
travel.  Rather, attachment of the original copy of the said document upon 

liquidation of cash advance is required. 

 

4. Individuals mentioned in the AOM were Supreme Students Government 
Officers of ESSU.  Expenses incurred for their travels in attending seminars 

and conferences are usually charged against their SSG-TSG fund maintained 

in the Internally Generated Fund.  It was just recently that the Accounting 

Office was informed that all their financial transactions must be processed and 

handled by their Adviser/s. 

 

b. Maydolong Campus: Some Lacking documents for TEV claims were already 
submitted for compliance. 

 

c. Can-avid Campus: The necessary documents required will be submitted.  
Henceforth, every claim for travelling allowance will be attached with accurate 

and complete documents which will validate and testify the legality of the claims. 

 

d. Salcedo Campus: The lacking supporting documents mentioned in the AOM 

were inadvertently attached to the file copy.  Whereas, some of the Certificate of 

Appearances were just photocopies since the original copies were submitted for 

the evaluation of their NBC 461.  The said documents were already submitted 

for compliance. 

 

e. Guiuan Campus: The agency will adhere to the provisions pertaining to claims 

for travel expenses such as the prescribed rates and required documentary 

attachments set forth in Executive Order No. 77. 

 

Further, adjustments on our journal entries will be made to properly charge those 

that are erroneously recorded to TEV account. 

 



138 

17.11 As a rejoinder, the Audit Team emphasized that provisions of law, rules and 

regulations pertaining to claims for travel expenses should be strictly enforced.  The 

management’s assured compliance with the audit recommendation will be regularly 

monitored. 

 

 

Payment of fuel and lubricants with incomplete documentation, P2,033,138.61 

 

18. Expenses for fuel and lubricants of Main Campus’ motor vehicles totaling 
P2,033,138.61 could not effectively be evaluated because of the management’s 

failure to support the disbursements with complete documentation, contrary to 

Section 4(6) of PD No. 1445 and COA Circular No. 77-61. 

 

18.1 Section 4 of PD No. 1445 provides: 

 

Section 4. Fundamental principles. Financial transactions and 

operations of any government agency shall be governed by the 

fundamental principles set forth hereunder, to wit: 

 

X x x 

 

(6) Claims against government funds shall be supported

18.2 Whereas, COA Circular No. 77-61 otherwise known as the Manual on Audit of Fuel 

Consumption of Government Motor Vehicles dated September 26, 1977 enumerates 

the specific rules and regulations regarding fuel consumption of government motor 

vehicles providing among others:

“For Official Use Only” and bear government plates only 

with the exception of security vehicles exempt from using 

government plates.

18.4 Review of the above disbursements and their supporting documents revealed the 

following: 

 

a. The attached Driver’s Trip Tickets were not properly accomplished to indicate: 
(1) the number of liters for gasoline issued/purchased; (2) the remaining balance 

of gasoline in the tank; (3) and the speedometer readings; 

 

b. The Driver’s Trip Tickets also did not contain information as to the Plate 
Number of the vehicle used and the trip tickets were not serially numbered; 

 

c. The Monthly Reports of Fuel Consumption of Motor Vehicles, Report of Official 
Travels, the Summary of Requisition and Issue Voucher, and such other related 

reports as required in COA Circular No. 77-61 were not submitted to the Auditor 

for verification. 

 

18.5 Again, it pays to emphasize the importance of these basic documents to support all 

purchases for fuel and lubricants to enable the Audit Team to properly evaluate the 

fuel consumed by ESSU’s motor vehicles, and to ascertain whether the trips were 

official and properly authorized. 

 

18.6 The above deficiencies relate to the internal control weaknesses over the consumption 

of fuel, which precluded the Audit Team from reviewing and verifying the 

reasonableness of the fuel consumption of Main Campus. 

 

18.7 We recommended that the Head of the Transportation and Motorpool Services 

require the drivers/agency personnel concerned to: 

 

a. properly accomplish the Driver’s Trip Tickets, indicating in detail all the 
required information therein; and 

 

b. prepare and submit monthly the Report of Official Travels, and 
summarizing in chronological order the driver’s trips for the month based 

on their serial numbers, and properly accomplished Driver’s Trip Tickets, 

duly approved by Head of Transportation and Motorpool Services. 

 

18.8 We also recommended that the President require the assigned supply personnel 

to prepare and submit the following reports to support the consumption of 

gasoline/fuel and lubricants:  

 



141 

a) Requisition and Issue Vouchers, 
b) Daily Gas Issued Record, 
c) Monthly Summary of Requisition and Issue Voucher, and 
d) Monthly Report of Fuel Consumption. 

 

18.9 The following are the comments of the respective management of Main Campus: 

 

In view of the recently issued AOM, the current Head of the Motorpool Services 

explained that he was not yet the officer in-charge when the transaction for the 

procurement of fuel, oil and lubricants transpired.  However, he implied his 

willingness to comply with requirements and recommendations set forth by the 

Audit Team.  On the other hand, the former head of Motorpool Services, notified 

the office that they only maintain a logbook to record all the official travels made by 

the drivers during the period. 

 

While below are the Supply Officer’s responses with respect to the recommendation 

on the preparation and submission of the necessary documents to support the 

consumption of gasoline/fuel and lubricants: 

 

a. The Supply and Property Management Office had been using the equivalent 
reports forms (devised by the top management for us to utilize) and submitted 

the same to the Internal Control Office. 

 

b. The Monthly Summary of Fuel Consumption Report for CY 2020 was already 
forwarded to the internal control office attached with necessary supporting 

documents such as trip tickets and monthly fuel billings.  

 

Nevertheless, the management will mandate all concerned officials to prepare and 

submit the required reports to the Audit Team on the prescribed schedule.  

 

18.10 As a rejoinder, the Audit Team stressed out that Driver’s Trip Tickets should be 

properly accomplished and monthly reports of Official Travels, Requisition and 

Issue Voucher and Fuel Consumption be submitted regularly to verify the 

reasonableness and economy of the fuel consumed.  Also, management’s compliance 

with the audit recommendations will be monitored regularly.

Release of retention money for expendable supplies without proof of full consumption 

 

19. ESSU granted the release of retention money for expendable supplies despite the 
non-submission of proof that the same were fully consumed, contrary to the 

provisions of the 2016 RIRR of RA No. 9184. 

 

19.1 Sections 5 (m) and 62.1 of the 2016 RIRR of RA No. 9184, otherwise known as the 

Government Procurement Reform Act, state that:  

 

Section 5. Definition of Terms 
 

For purposes of this IRR, the following terms or words and phrases 

shall mean or be understood as follows: 

 

X x x 

 

m) Expendable Supplies. Refer to articles which are normally 

consumed in use within one (1) year or converted in the process 

of manufacture or construction, or those having a life expectancy 

of more than one (1) year but which shall have decreased 

substantially in value after being put to use for only one (1) year 

(e.g., medicines, stationery, fuel, and spare parts). 

 

X x x 

 

Section 62. Warranty 

 

62.1. For the procurement of Goods, in order to assure that 

manufacturing defects shall be corrected by the supplier, a 

warranty security shall be required from the contract awardee 

for a minimum period of three (3) months, in the case of 

Expendable Supplies, or a minimum period of one (1) year, in 

the case of Non-expendable Supplies, after acceptance by the 

Procuring Entity of the delivered supplies. 

 

The obligation for the warranty shall be covered by either 

retention money in an amount equivalent to at least one 

percent (1%) but not to exceed five percent (5%) of every 

progress payment, or a special bank guarantee equivalent to at 

least one percent (1%) but not to exceed five percent (5%) of 

the total contract price.  The said amounts shall only be 

released after the lapse of the warranty period or, in the 

case of Expendable Supplies, after consumption thereof:  

Provided, however, That the supplies delivered are free from 

patent and latent defects and all the conditions imposed under 

the contract have been fully met. 



143 

19.2 In the procurement of goods, the retention money or special bank guarantee, serves 

as a guarantee that corrective actions will be performed by the supplier in cases where 

the delivered items have manufacturing defects.  As stated in the above-quoted IRR, 

release of the retention money shall be made only after the lapse of the warranty 

period or, in the case of expendable supplies, after consumption thereof, whichever 

comes later. 

 

19.3 Examination of the transactions for the procurement of goods disclosed that in CY 

2020, ESSU granted the payments on the release of retention money for procurements 

of expendable supplies without proof that the same were already consumed, the 

details of these transactions are shown in Table 67:

Totals P2,694,174.00   P26,941.74 

 

19.4 The premature release of the retention money deprives ESSU of readily available 

remedies in case there is non-compliance by the supplier with the terms and 

conditions stated in the contracts.  This situation is not favorable to the interests of 

the government. 

 

19.5 We recommended that the President direct the OIC-University Accountant to: 

 

a. submit supporting documentary proof showing that the procured 
expendable supplies under the two above-mentioned contracts have been 

fully utilized and consumed; and 

 

b. refrain from releasing the retention money for the procurement of goods 
prior to the lapse of the warranty period in compliance with the 2016 RIRR 

of RA No. 9184, and to adequately protect the interest of the government. 

 

19.6 The following are the comments of the respective management of Main Campus: 

 

The release of the retention money for the two transactions that transpired in 2020 

was based on the provision under Section 5 of the 2016 RIRR that payment can be 

released after the lapse of the warranty period of three (3) months.  The Accountant 

admittedly failed to observe the additional guidelines that warranty payments must 

be released after the lapse of the warranty period or after the consumption, whichever 

comes later.   



144 

 

Hereafter, the management will require the in-charge to strictly observe the 

guidelines in releasing retention money. 

 

 

Non-preparation/non-submission of Procurement Monitoring Reports 

 

20. The Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) of Maydolong and Salcedo Campuses 
did not prepare the Procurement Monitoring Reports (PMRs) while the BACs 

of all other ESSU Campuses did not submit their PMRs to the Government 

Procurement Policy Board (GPPB) as required under Section 12.2 of the 2016 

RIRR of RA No. 9184, thus the benefits of procurement transparency, tracking 

of efficiency, monitoring and compliance with the procurement standards were 

not attained. 

 

20.1 Section 12.2 of the 2016 RIRR of RA No. 9184 states: 

 

12.2. The BAC shall be responsible for ensuring that the Procuring 

Entity abides by the standards set forth by the Act and this IRR, 

and it shall prepare a Procurement Monitoring Report (PMR) 

in the form prescribed by the GPPB.  The PMR shall cover all 

procurement activities specified in the APP, whether ongoing 

and completed, from the holding of the pre-procurement 

conference to the issuance of notice of award and the approval 

of the contract, including the standard and actual time for each 

major procurement activity.  The PMR shall be approved and 

submitted by the HoPE to the GPPB in printed and electronic 

format within fourteen (14) calendar days after the end of each 

semester.  The PMR shall likewise be posted in accordance with 

E.O. 662, s. 2007, as amended. 

 

20.2 The Audit Team informed, through electronic mails, the BAC Secretariat of Main 

Campus and the Campus Administrators of the External Campuses, of its request for 

the submission of the Project Monitoring Reports (PMR) of the five campuses of 

ESSU.  To date, the Main, Can-avid and Guiuan Campuses were able to provide the 

requested documents; while Salcedo and Maydolong Campuses have yet to prepare 

and submit the said reports. 

 

20.3 Verification from GPPB and ESSU websites confirmed that no PMRs were posted 

from CYs 2009 to 2020 except for the 1st Semester of CY 2020 PMR of Main 

Campus, which could be accessed via its official website. 

 

20.4 The failure of responsible officers and/or personnel concerned to prepare, submit and 

publish the PMRs limited the intended users in verifying and independently 

evaluating whether ESSU is compliant with the provisions of RA No. 9184 and its 

2016 RIRR. 



145 

 

20.5 More so, the PMR could be utilized by ESSU to assess its progress in all procurement 

activities as well as the timely delivery of its programs, projects, and activities in 

carrying out its mandates.  Likewise, other information such as the usual point of 

delay, the performance of various suppliers or contractors, and pending or incomplete 

procurement activities could be easily determined, and such data can be used as a 

reference by ESSU in the formulation of strategies to address the problems 

encountered. 

 

20.6 We recommended that the President and the Campus Administrators of all 

ESSU Campuses direct the members of the Bids and Awards Committees to 

prepare and timely submit the PMRs of each campus to GPPB and publish the 

same in ESSU website as set forth in Section 12.2 of the 2016 RIRR of RA No. 

9184 to ensure that all procurement activities are regularly monitored. 

 

20.7 The following are the comments of the respective management of the campuses: 

 

a. Main Campus: With respect to the issued AOM, the BAC Secretariat 
commented that he regularly submits Performance Monitoring Report (PMR) to 

the Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB).  Meanwhile, the one who’s 

in-charge with the posting of PMRs to ESSU website, remarked that he will 

rectify the deficiencies by uploading the lacking PMRs on file, and that he will 

explicitly include a link for PMRs under Section V in the Transparency Seal part 

to make it as visible as possible to the public and to the auditing agencies. 

 

Henceforth, the management will implement strict compliance of the 

requirements set forth in Section 12.2 of the 2016 RIRR of RA No. 9184. 

 

b. Maydolong Campus: The management will direct the members of the BAC to 
prepare and timely submit the PMRs of each campus to the GPPB and publish 

the same in the ESSU website as set forth on Section 12.2 of the 2016 RIRR of 

RA No. 9184 to ensure that all procurement activities are regularly monitored. 

 

c. Can-avid Campus: Compliance of the recommendation as required by Section 
12.2 of the 2016 RIRR of RA No. 9184 will strictly be observed. 

 

d. Salcedo Campus: The BAC of Salcedo Campus presumed that submission of 
PMR is required only for infrastructure projects amounting to more than 

P600,000.00 being implemented by Main Campus.  From now on, PMR will be 

prepared for all procurements to comply with Section 12.2 of the 2016 RIRR of 

the RA No. 9184. 

 

e. Guiuan Campus: The Bids & Awards Committee of Guiuan Campus will 
continue to prepare PMRs and submit the same to Main Campus for 

consolidation and posting to the ESSU website/GPPB.

Only 50% of the 27,774 student-recipients of the CHED Scholarship Program enrolled in 

identified priority courses 

 

21. Of the 27,774 student-recipients of the CHED Scholarship Programs (CSP) of 
ESSU, only 13,941 or 50% are enrolled in the priority courses identified by the 

CHED for financial assistance in AY 2019-2020, contrary to the government’s 

convergent efforts in addressing the prevailing job-skill mismatch.  

 

21.1 RA No. 9312 dated August 7, 2004, which converted the Eastern Samar State College 

(SSC) into a State University to be known as the Eastern Samar State University 

(ESSU), identified under Section 2 its main objective of providing advanced 

education, higher technological, professional instruction and training in the fields of 

industry, computer and information technology, forestry, and environmental 

sciences, agriculture and veterinary medicine, fishery, medicine and related sciences, 

engineering, education, law, arts and sciences, and other related fields of study.  

Further, the University also aims promote research and extension services, and 

provide progressive leadership in its areas of specialization.  

 

21.2 Its mandate under Section 3, identified its curricular offerings as catering to 

undergraduate and graduate programs within the areas of specialization and 

according to its capabilities, as the ESSU Board of Regents may deem necessary to 

carry out its objectives, in order to meet the needs of the province and the region. 

 

21.3 CHED Memorandum Order (CMO) No. 5, series of 2019 dated August 16, 2019 

specifically identified the Priority Courses for CHED Scholarship Programs (CSPs) 

effective Academic Year 2019-2020.  The CMO states that the determination of the 

priority courses was a result of studies and deliberations conducted by multi-sectoral 

stakeholders in line with the National Development Plan on manpower demands 

based on the JobsFit 2022 Labor Market Information (LMI) Report of DOLE. 

 

21.4 The CMO also states that students who are enrolled in any of the priority courses 

listed in the CMO may avail of the benefits under the CSPs, depending on the type 

of scholarships they qualify, which shall be in the form of tuition and stipend. 

 

21.5 For Academic Year 2019-2020, the ESSU offered a total of 33 Bachelor degree 

programs, to wit:

21.6 The Audit Team then evaluated ESSU’s compliance with the abovementioned CMO 

that provides the list of priority courses to which the qualified beneficiaries of CSPs 

shall be directed to enroll. 

 

21.7 Evaluation revealed that of the total 27,774 enrollees who qualified for the 

scholarships under the CHED for the second semester of AY 2019-2020 and first 

semester of AY 2020-2021, only 50% or 13,941 students were enrolled in the priority 

courses identified under the various programs of Science, Technology, Engineering, 

Agri-Fisheries and Mathematics (STEAM) while 13% or 3,644 students were 

enrolled in other priority courses aligned with key growth areas as provided by the 

CHED.  The remaining 37% or 10,189 students, comprised of 6,553 student-

beneficiaries enrolled in courses under the field of Education, Accounting, 

Entrepreneurship, Social Work, Communication, and Fisheries (previously included 

in the priority courses under CMO No. 01 series of 2014 dated January 9, 2014 and 

its addendum), and 3,636 enrolled in courses, such as Business Administration, 

Nursing, Political Science, Midwifery, were not included in the list of priority courses 

identified by CHED. 

 

21.8 Therefore, out of the 33 programs offered by the University, only sixteen were 

aligned with the priority courses under the CSP for AY 2019-2020 prescribed under 

CMO No.5, series of 2019, identified as follows: 

 
Table 69. Schedule of Priority Courses under the CSP for AY 2019-2020 offered by ESSU in CY 2020

Bachelor of Science in Information Technology Bachelor of Technology 

Bachelor of Science in Environmental Science Bachelor of Science in Agribusiness 

Bachelor of Science in Agriculture Bachelor of Science in Tourism Management 

Bachelor in Agricultural Technology Bachelor of Science in Hospitality Management 

 

21.9 Moreover, review of the programs offered by the five campuses of ESSU disclosed 

that there is unequal distribution of the number of authorized priority courses offered 

across the ESSU system which in effect, have limited the number of students enrolled 

in priority courses in a particular campus, as illustrated in Table 70. 

 
Table 70.  Distribution of the Various Courses in the Campuses of ESSU 



148 

Course 

Classification 
Main Can-avid Maydolong Salcedo Guiuan 

Priority 11 4 2 7 5 

Other Priority 2 0 1 0 2 

Non-Priority 11 3 6 3 8 

Total 24 7 9 10 15 

 

21.10 The above table shows the disparity between the total number of priority courses 

offered in the Main campus and those of the courses offered in the external campuses.  

It would have been ideal if there was an equal distribution of the courses offered in 

the various campuses so that these are made available for qualified scholar-

beneficiaries under the CHED Scholarship Programs (CSPs) so that the widest 

number of client-students are benefited. 

 

21.11 We recommended that the University President direct the Vice President for 

Academic Affairs in coordination with the College Deans and Campus 

Administrators to: 

 

a. conduct regular monitoring and assessment of the number of students 
enrolled for each program offered; and  

 

b. equitably assign the incoming freshmen students to priority courses as 
recommended by CHED to avoid overpopulation of enrollees in certain 

courses, and lesser enrollees in the priority courses. 

 

21.12 The following are the comments of the management of ESSU: 

 

While the Management recognizes and even commends the laudable intent to 

encourage students to enroll in priority courses identified by CHED, the Management 

also ought to consider the following factors: 

 

1. Although the identification of the priority programs went through a series of 
studies particularly on the demand of the labor marker both domestic and 

overseas, students and their parents have preferences which affect the former’s 

decision in enrolling in courses other than those identified by CHED, taking for 

instance the BS Nursing program, which only lately became highly in demand 

due to glove shortage of health workers.  On the other side of the spectrum, only 

few students nowadays-despite massive information campaign-would pursue 

agricultural degree courses. 

 

2. Only relative few senior high school students would choose and qualify to purse 
STEM as their preparatory course for an engineering-related tertiary program.  

Although the ESSU offers a bridging program for non-STEM majors for them to 

be able to adapt to the rudiments of an engineering course, only a few student 

actually would pursue and if ever they will, survive the rigours attendant in an 

engineering course. 



149 

 

3. It is also the Management’s desire to come up with a flagship program for each 
campus so that ESSU could develop a niche or field of expertise where it would 

excel in terms of human and technical resource.  ESSU is also in the process of 

enriching and diversifying its course offering in each campus so that it will attain 

a Certificate of Program Compliance (COPC) preferable for each program in 

compliance with relevant CHED issuances. 

 

4. Nonetheless, the ESSU Management will abide and subscribe with the 
recommendation of the Audit Team by encouraging its incoming freshmen 

students to take up in any of the priority courses as identified by CHED 

particularly this AY 2021-2022.  In addition, ESSU also issued a memorandum 

to its Colleges Deans and Campus Administrators to conduct regular monitoring 

and assessment of the number of students enrolled for each programs and to 

moderate overpopulation of enrolees in non-priority courses. 

 

 

Delayed submission of GAD Accomplishment Report 

 

22. The GAD Accomplishment Report of ESSU was not submitted to the Audit 
Team on time, and which was not properly accomplished, contrary to PCW-

NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01, COA Circular No. 2014-001, and the 

IRR of RA No. 9710, otherwise known as the Magna Carta of Women. 

 

22.1 Item V of COA Circular No. 2014-001 dated March 18, 2014 provides that: 

 

V. RESPONSIBILITY OF THE AUDITED AGENCY 

 

The Audited agency shall submit a copy of the Annual GAD 

Plan and Budget (GPB) to the COA Audit Team assigned to 

the agency within five (5) working days from the receipt of the 

approved plan from the PCW or their mother or central offices, 

as the case maybe.  Likewise, a copy of the corresponding 

Accomplishment Report shall be furnished the said Audit 

Team within five (5) working days from the end of January of 

the preceding year. 

 

22.2 Also, the PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01 provides for the guidelines 

in the preparation of the GAD AR. 

 

22.3 Section 37, Rule VI of the IRR of RA No. 9710, otherwise known as the Magna Carta 

of Women of CY 2009, provides: 

 

SECTION 37. Gender Mainstreaming as a Strategy for 

Implementing the Magna Carta of Women – xxx. 

 



150 

D. GAD Database – All departments, including their attached 

agencies, offices, bureaus, SUCs, GOCCs, LGUs, and other 

government instrumentalities shall develop and maintain a GAD 

database containing GAD information to include gender statistics and 

age-and sex-disaggregated data that have been systematically 

produced/gathered, regularly updated to serve as inputs or bases for 

planning, programming, and policy formulation.  The National 

Statistical Coordination Board (NSCB), upon the recommendation of 

the Inter-Agency Committee on Gender Statistics (IACGS), shall 

issue statistical policies on the generation of data support on gender 

issues and improve the system of collection and dissemination of 

gender statistics at the national and local levels. 

 

22.4 Hereunder are the deficiencies noted in the audit of the GAD funds (see Annex V for 

the checklist of noted common audit observations on the audit of GAD funds): 

 

A. Late submission of the GAD Accomplishment Report to the Audit Team -  
 

22.5 The GAD AR was not submitted to the Audit Team within the prescribed period 

affecting therefore the timely audit of the allocation and utilization of the GAD fund.  

Details are as follows: 

 
Table 71. Deadline of Submission of GAD AR for CY 2020 to COA 

Particulars 

Deadline of 

Submission 

Date

No. Of Days 

Delayed 

2020 GAD AR 02/05/21 03/17/21 40 

 

B. GAD AR was not properly accomplished – 
 

22.6 During audit of the submitted reports it was also noted that: 

 

a. The Remarks (Column 10) of the GAD AR did not indicate comments on the 
deviations from the identified results, activities and targets; the reasons for the 

deviation; as well as the factors that could have either facilitated or hindered the 

implementation of the GAD Plan.  This despite the noted differences between 

the Total Agency Approved Budget (Column 8) and Actual Cost Expenditure 

(Column 9).  Without this information on the Variance/Remarks (Column 10), 

deviations, if any, cannot be identified and the linkage between the GAD budget 

to the actual cost of implementation of the GAD activities could not be properly 

evaluated; 

b. There are one client-focused activity and six organization-focused activities that 
were not undertaken in CY 2020 following the orders from the ESSU President 

(Memorandum No. 2020-OPRE-204) and the Office of the Provincial Governor 

(Executive Order No. BPE-03-012 Series of 2020) due to the threat of COVID-

19 pandemic (see Annex W for details). 

 



151 

C. Non-establishment of the GAD database - 
 

22.7 The GAD database which should have contained information on sex-disaggregated 

data that could serve as input for gender-responsive planning, programming and 

policy formulation is yet to be established.  As per their GAD Activity Work Plan for 

CY 2020, the time frame for the collection and generation of sex-disaggregated data 

was scheduled for March to December 2020 however, this has been postponed due 

to COVID-19 pandemic.  As of date, a proposal has already submitted for the 

collection of sex-disaggregated data together with the standards in collecting such 

data. 

 

22.8 We recommended that the President require the GAD Focal Persons and other 

personnel concerned to: 

 

a. ensure that the GAD AR is submitted to the Audit Team within the 
prescribed period as required in item V of COA Circular No. 2014-001; 

 

b. ensure that the GAD AR is prepared in accordance with Annex B of PCW-
NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-1; and 

 

c. develop and maintain GAD database with adequate and systematically 
gathered data to provide as input for gender-responsive planning, 

programming and policy formulation. 

 

22.9 The following are the comments of the respective management of the campuses: 

 

1. Main Campus: The GAD office does the tracking of the Accomplishment 
Report submitted to the Gender Mainstreaming and Monitoring System 

(GMMS), as of October 12, 2020 it is still subject for review by CHED RO8. 

For the next submission of GAD Accomplishment Report, a copy will be 

immediately furnished to the Audit Team. 

 

In the next submission of the Accomplishment Report, the GAD office will 

indicate the details in the “Remarks: column. 

 

There is an initial data available at the Planning Office particularly the 

Demographic Profile of students, faculty and employees of ESSU which include: 

Sex, Age, Vehicle, Proximate Distance to  the University, Physical Condition, 

Civil Status, Religious Affiliation, Organization and Graduates. 

 

On Student Information and Accounting System, there is an existing database 

which can be accessed through the Local Area Network. 

 

The GAD Office will work closely and coordinate with the Planning Office and 

IT Office respectively to develop and maintain the GAD Database. 

 



152 

2. Maydolong Campus: The management will require the GAD Focal Person to 
use the prescribed form and attach necessary documentary requirements. 

 

3. Can-avid Campus: Required reports were already submitted to Main Campus’ GAD 
Office. 

 

4. Salcedo Campus: Salcedo Campus’ GAD AR was submitted to Main Campus 
last January 8, 2021 and was stamped received by the said office on January 11, 

2021.  Notations from the GAD Focal person also highlighted prompt 

submission of the required AR. 

 

The details of the required reports were properly supplied including Column 10 

except for the issues concerning Gay uniforms and their restrooms which would 

require ESSU’s policies. 

 

GAD database proposal is currently on work-in-progress despite the 

postponement of activities during the past school year. 
 

5. Guiuan Campus: The agency will revise the plan and propose activities 
befitting the current trends while implementing COVID protocols and pursuant 

with the guidelines and provisions of RA No. 9710 and PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint 

Circular No. 2012-1.  Similarly, the agency will adopt modern technology on 

data gathering, such as social platforms, for GAD data base accuracy. 

 

To ensure the efficiency of the data base, the GAD office will appoint 

representative of each college to communicate effectively with the focal person 

of the campus.

1 The year-end balance of the account 

Cash in Bank-Local Currency, 

Current Account totaling 

P136,211,872.93 is unreliable due 

to the following deficiencies noted: 

a) variance between the balances in 

the bank confirmation results and the 

balances in the General Ledger (GL) 

totaling  P11,421,407.95 caused by 

the following: i) unadjusted valid 

reconciling items in the bank and 

the book records amounting to 

P708,585.12 and P3,226,931.34, 

respectively; ii) unreconciled 

balances in the books reflected in the 

Bank Reconciliation Statements 

(BRS) amounting to P1,418,872.27; 

and iii) an unidentified variance 

totaling P7,484,189.46; and b) non-

preparation of BRS by Guiuan 

Campus, thus affecting the fair 

presentation of the financial 

statements. 

 

We recommended that the President 

require the respective Accountants 

of the campuses to: 

 

a. draw a JEV to record the 
necessary adjustments in the 

books for valid reconciling items 

and to conduct a thorough review 

of the other reconciling items 

reflected in the BRSs and 

support the same with relevant 

documentary evidence;  

 

 

 

b. provide the bank with a copy of 
the BRS showing the bank errors 

for adjustment pertaining to 

Maydolong Campus

affecting the fair presentation of the

We recommend that the President 

require the respective Accountants 

of Main, Guiuan and Maydolong 

Campuses to: 

 

a. consistently apply the accrual 
method of accounting in 

recording assessed school fees 

by setting up Accounts

2. ESSU’s Accounts Receivable 

representing unpaid tuition fees and 

other school fees aggregating 

P34,675,766.04 as of December 31, 

2019 remained uncollected due to 

management’s failure to exert extra 

efforts to collect them, thus 

depriving ESSU of the funds which 

could have been used to support its 

programs and projects. 

 

We recommend that management 

should (1) exert extra efforts to 

collect the outstanding Accounts 

Receivables; (2) adopt collection 

scheme that would intensify the 

settlement of the outstanding ARs 

and direct the Accountant to strictly 

monitor the payment of the same;

8 The IGPs of Main and Maydolong 

Campuses include ventures that do 

not provide maximum hands-on 

experience to students, contrary to 

the twin-objectives prescribed in 

Chapter IV of the IGP Manual. 

 
We recommend that management 

revisit the current operations of these 

IGPs and ensure that the twin-

objectives for the establishment of  

IGPs set forth in  Chapter IV of the 

IGP  Manual are met. In addition, 

incomefrom projects which do not 

qualify as IGP should not be 

considered as income for IGP but for 

the campus, thus, should be 

reclassified to Other Business 

Income (40202990) under Internally 

Generated Funds (FC 5).

the profit sharing equivalent to 25% 

of the annual income earned from the 

operations of its Income Generating 

Projects (IGPs) remained in the 

books under Business Related Funds

Internally Generated Fund (FC 05), 

thus depriving ESSU of the much 

needed resources to finance its 

programs and projects. 

 

We recommend that the President 

require the Accountant to remit the 

25% school share of the prior years’ 

net income from IGP operations to 

Internally Generated Fund (FC 5) 

and henceforth, ensure that the 

school share is always appropriately 

allotted from its yearly net income.
