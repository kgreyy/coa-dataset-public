Dear Chairman Adamat and Atty. Albina:



We are pleased to transmit the Annual Audit Report on the audit of the University of Science and Technology of Southern Philippines – Cagayan de Oro Campus, Lapasan, Cagayan de Oro City, for Calendar Year 2020 in compliance with Section 2, Article IX-D of the Philippine Constitution and Section 43 of the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines (PD 1445).



The audit was conducted to: (a) ascertain the level of assurance that may be placed on management’s assertions on the financial statements; (b) determine the propriety of transactions as well as the extent of compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations; (c) recommend agency improvement opportunities; and (d) determine the extent of the implementation of prior year’s audit recommendations.



The attached report consists of Part I- Audited Financial Statements, Part II-Observations and Recommendations and Part III- Status of Implementation of Prior Year’s Audit Recommendations, and Part IV-Appendix.



We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions and we believed that it provided a reasonable basis for the audit results.  The auditor rendered a modified-qualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the financial statements due to the following:



----media/image7.png----1.	The accuracy, validity and reliability of the balances of Accounts Receivable and Due from National Government Agencies amounting to P186,764,997.59 and P260,177,851.33, respectively, could not be ascertained due to (a) recording of income from tuition fees under “Due from National Government Agencies” instead of “Accounts Receivable”, contrary to COA Circular Letter No. 2004-002 dated September 30, 2004; (b) absence of subsidiary ledger(s) and schedule of receivables, contrary to Sec. 12 and 15, Chapter 2, GAM Vol. I and Sec. 27, Chapter 7, GAM Vol. I, thereby affecting the fair presentation of those balances in the financial statements. 

The details of the above and other findings and recommendations are discussed in detail in Part II -Observations and Recommendations of the report.



We request that the recommended measures be implemented and we would appreciate being informed on the actions taken thereon by accomplishing the attached Agency Action Plan and Status of Implementation (AAPSI) form, to be submitted to the Audit Team within 60 days from receipt of this report, pursuant to Section 89 of RA 11465, the General Provisions of the General Appropriations Act FY 2020.

Finding No. 1



The accuracy, validity and reliability of the balances of Accounts Receivable and Due from National Government Agencies amounting to P186,764,997.59 and    P260,177,851.33, respectively, could not be ascertained due to (a) recording of income from tuition fees under “Due from National Government Agencies” instead of “Accounts Receivable”, contrary to COA Circular Letter No. 2004-002 dated September 30, 2004; (b) absence of subsidiary ledger(s) and schedule of receivables, contrary to Sec. 12 and 15, Chapter 2, GAM Vol. I and Sec. 27, Chapter 7, GAM Vol. I, thereby affecting the fair presentation of those balances in the financial statements.



We recommended that the Accounting Office:



a)	Expedite the posting of CHED payments to each student account in order to update the receivable balances;



b)	Review and update the individual student ledger balances prior to the UniFAST Act and send demand letters for collections;



c)	Conduct regular monitoring and analysis of receivable accounts.  For dormant receivables, submit request for write-off following the procedures in Sec. 8.0, COA Circular No. 2016- 005 dated Dec. 19, 2016;



d)	Retrieve all billing documents and details of payments from CHED and accordingly, update the receivable balances;

f)	Comply with the provisions of Sec. 12 and 15, Chapter 2, GAM Vol. I and Sec. 27, Chapter 7, GAM Vol. I.

















AAR 2020

Finding No. 2



Scholarship Funds amounting to                              P102,864,410.0 were unreliable due to inclusion of (a) CHED free tuition fee payments for 2nd Sem CY 2017-2018 amounting to       P69,035,104.13 which should have been recorded as income, contrary to COA Circular Letter No. 2004-002 dated September 30, 2004;           (b) receipt of funds for CHED ESGP-PA TES SY 2018-2019 amounting to           P9,558,154.00 which should have been recorded as “Due to NGAs” account, contrary to Chapter 3, GAM Vol. III; (c) transferred funds to USTP Claveria amounting to P576,000.00; (d) outstanding accounts for verification amounting to P16,596,281.22; contrary to Sec. 15, Chapter 2, GAM Volume I, thereby affecting the fair presentation thereof of the financial statements.







We recommended that management undertake the following measures:



1. Employ concerted efforts to retrieve the source documents for all outstanding accounts subject for verification of the following transactions, and accordingly, reconcile, update and correct the balances;



2. Prepare the necessary adjusting Journal Entry Vouchers (JEVs).  

















AAR 2020

Finding No. 3



Unutilized funds amounting to P15,961,293.28 released by CHED Central Office were not covered by a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) but were taken up in the books of accounts, contrary to Chapter 3, Government Accounting Manual (GAM) Vol. III and Sec. 15, Chapter 2, GAM Volume I, thereby resulting to overstatement of cash and trust liabilities balances and affecting the fair presentation thereof of the financial statements.



We recommended the management require the Accountant to return to CHED Central Office the transferred funds amounting to P 15,961,293.28 so that it can be used for other priority programs of the government, and prepare the adjusting entries accordingly.

















AAR 2020

Finding No. 4

The validity of the reported balance of Other Receivable account is doubtful due to                     (a) inclusion of inter-fund receivable of P3,141,396.04 without corresponding reciprocal account and (b) existence of dormant account of P342,807.02, contrary to Sec. 15, Chapter 2, Vol. 1 of Government Accounting Manual (GAM), COA Circular 16-005 and Vol. III of GAM, respectively; thereby, overstating/understating affected accounts, affecting the fair presentation of the financial statements.

We recommended the management to require the Accountant to:



a.	Scrutinize the transaction related to inter-fund receivable and if warranted, adjust the books of accounts to properly recognize inter-fund receivable as Due from Other Funds and record the corresponding reciprocal account for General and IEP funds; and



b.	Undertake the procedures provided for under COA Cir. 16-005 dated December 19, 2016 in writing-off the dormant account.

















AAR 2019

Finding No. 3



The balance of Construction in Progress account in the amount of                                     P79,017,906.69 has remained open for more than three (3) years and the related unfinished project has been unnecessarily idle, thus, exposing the property to natural elements that may cause deterioration and loss of value; depriving the intended beneficiaries of its immediate and maximum use, and denoting non-responsiveness to the exigencies of the service, contrary to item 4 of COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012.





We recommended that management initiate the immediate “Take-over of Contracts” in order to facilitate the completion of the project, as enunciated in paragraph 7, item IV, Annex “A” of GPPB Resolution 018-2004 dated December 22, 2004 on the Guidelines on the Termination of Contracts.



















AAR 2018

Finding No. 2



Absence of Property Identification and Coding, and Non-renewal of Property Acknowledge Receipts (PAR) for equipments amounting to      P528,400,271.18, contrary to paragraph V(2) of COA Circular No. 80-124 dated January 18, 1980 and Sec. 21, Chapter 10, Vol. I of Government Auditing Manual (GAM), thus, accountability and responsibility over the properties and equipment could not be clearly established.





We recommended that the Supply Officer undertake the following:



1)	Adopt a uniform property identification system for easy recognition of the equipments;



2)	Prepare and issue Property Acknowledgment Receipts (PAR) to the recipient of the equipments/ properties; 



3)	Strictly comply with the provisions of paragraph V(2) of COA Circular No. 80-124 dated January 18, 1980 and Sec. 21, Chapter 10, Vol. I of Government Auditing Manual (GAM).

















AAR 2013

Finding No. 1



The uncollected Accounts Receivables balance of P2.731 million representing 78.81% are long overdue accounts for over five years due to management’s inaccurate recording and the failure to provide an individual subsidiary ledger for each customer resulted to the accumulation of uncollected receivables aging over five years.  Moreover, the required allowance for doubtful accounts are not provided contrary to the provisions of Sec. 36 & 39 of NGAS Manual Vol 1 & 2.





Require the business managers’ in-charge to exert extra efforts to collect the long outstanding overdue accounts especially those from scholar benefactors’ account.

D. 	INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



The Auditor rendered a modified-qualified opinion on the fairness of the presentation of the financial statements of the University of Science and Technology of Southern Philippines-Cagayan de Oro Campus for calendar year ended December 31, 2020, in view of the effects of the exceptions observed in the course of the audit which are discussed in detail in Part II of this report, as follows:



1)	The accuracy, validity and reliability of the balances of Accounts Receivable and Due from National Government Agencies amounting to P186,764,997.59 and    P260,177,851.33, respectively, could not be ascertained due to (a) recording of income from tuition fees under “Due from National Government Agencies” instead of “Accounts Receivable”, contrary to COA Circular Letter No. 2004-002 dated September 30, 2004; (b) absence of subsidiary ledger(s) and schedule of receivables, contrary to Sec. 12 and 15, Chapter 2, GAM Vol. I and Sec. 27, Chapter 7, GAM Vol. I, thereby affecting the fair presentation of those balances in the financial statements.





E. 	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT AUDIT OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



In addition to the aforecited reasons for a qualified opinion, the following were noted:



1)	Scholarship Funds amounting to P102,864,410.00 were unreliable due to inclusion of (a) CHED free tuition fee payments for 2nd Sem CY 2017-2018 amounting to                              P69,035,104.13 which should have been recorded as income, contrary to COA Circular Letter No. 2004-002 dated September 30, 2004; (b) receipt of funds for CHED ESGP-PA TES SY 2018-2019 amounting to P9,558,154.00 which should have been recorded as “Due to NGAs” account, contrary to Chapter 3, GAM Vol. III; (c) transferred funds to USTP Claveria amounting to P576,000.00; (d) outstanding accounts for verification amounting to P16,596,281.22; contrary to Sec. 15, Chapter 2, GAM Volume I, thereby affecting the fair presentation thereof of the financial statements.



We recommended that management employ concerted efforts to retrieve the source documents for all outstanding accounts subject for verification of the following transactions, and accordingly, reconcile, update and correct the balances; and prepare the necessary adjusting Journal Entry Vouchers (JEVs).  



2)	Unutilized funds amounting to P15,961,293.28 released by CHED Central Office were not covered by a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) but were taken up in the books of accounts, contrary to Chapter 3, Government Accounting Manual (GAM) Vol. III and Sec. 15, Chapter 2, GAM Volume I, thereby resulting to overstatement of cash and trust liabilities balances and affecting the fair presentation thereof of the financial statements.



We recommended that management require the Accountant to return to CHED Central Office the transferred funds amounting to P15,961,293.28 so that it can be used for other priority programs of the government, and prepare the adjusting entries accordingly.

3)	The validity of the reported balance of Other Receivable account is doubtful due to                     (a) inclusion of inter-fund receivable of P3,141,396.04 without corresponding reciprocal account and (b) existence of dormant account of P342,807.02, contrary to Sec. 15, Chapter 2, Vol. 1 of Government Accounting Manual (GAM), COA Circular 16-005 and Vol. III of GAM, respectively; thereby, overstating/understating affected accounts, affecting the fair presentation of the financial statements.



We recommended that management require the Accountant to:



a.	Scrutinize the transaction related to inter-fund receivable and if warranted, adjust the books of accounts to properly recognize inter-fund receivable as Due from Other Funds and record the corresponding reciprocal account for General and IEP funds; and



b.	Undertake the procedures provided for under COA Cir. 16-005 dated December 19, 2016 on writing-off the dormant account.





F.   STATUS OF SETTLEMENT OF ACCOUNTS 



As of December 31, 2020, the Statement of Audit Suspensions Disallowances and Charges (SASDC) reflected total suspension of P6,808,376.72 and total disallowances of P187,710,911.45.

Modified-Qualified Opinion



We have audited the financial statements of USTsP-Cagayan de Oro Campus, Cagayan de Oro City which comprise the statement of financial position as at December 31, 2020, and the statement of financial performance, statement of changes in net assets/equity, statement of cash flows and statement of comparison of budget and actual amounts for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.



In our opinion, except for the effects of the matters described in the Basis of Modified-Qualified Opinion section of our report, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the University of Science and Technology of Southern Philippines-Cagayan de Oro Campus as at December 31, 2020, and its financial performance, its cash flows, and its comparison of budget and actual amounts for the year then ended in accordance with International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSASs).





Basis for Modified-Qualified Opinion



	As discussed in Part II of this report, the following is the significant deficiency:



The accuracy, validity and reliability of the balances of Accounts Receivable and Due from National Government Agencies amounting to P186,764,997.59 and    P260,177,851.33, respectively, could not be ascertained due to (a) recording of income from tuition fees under “Due from National Government Agencies” instead of “Accounts Receivable”, contrary to COA Circular Letter No. 2004-002 dated September 30, 2004; (b) absence of subsidiary ledger(s) and schedule of receivables, contrary to Sec. 12 and 15, Chapter 2, GAM Vol. I and Sec. 27, Chapter 7, GAM Vol. I, thereby affecting the fair presentation of those balances in the financial statements.



We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions.  Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report.  We are independent of the agency in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.  We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our qualified opinion.



Key Audit Matters



Except for the matter described in the Basis for Modified-Qualified Opinion section, we have determined that there are no other key audit matters to communicate in our report.



Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial Statements



Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with IPSASs, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.



Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the University’s financial reporting process.



Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements



Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion.  Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISSAIs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.  Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

CONSOLIDATED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

December 31, 2020





Note 1. General Information/Agency Profile





1.1 The University of Science and Technology of Southern Philippines (USTP) is a state 	university established on August 16, 2016 by virtue of Republic Act 10919 through the amalgamation of the Mindanao University of Science and Technology (MUST) in Cagayan de Oro City, Misamis Oriental and the Misamis Oriental State College of Agriculture and Technology (MOSCAT) in Claveria, Misamis Oriental. It is located in Northern Mindanao, the Gateway to Mindanao, which offers a strategic locational advantage for the institution to train and develop students from all the other regions of Mindanao.



Adhering to its general mandate to primarily provide advance education; higher technological, professional and advanced instruction; and advance research and extension work, required for global competitiveness, the University envisions to become a nationally-recognized S&T University providing the vital link between education and the economy. As the university fulfils this mandate, it moves from within its immediate context and towards its larger international environment, as the first and only national university of science and technology in the country. It will operate such that it will have seamless knowledge and collaboration with its stakeholders in the private and public sectors — the labor market, business and industry.



USTP’s mission is to bring the world of work (industry) into the actual higher education and training of students, offer entrepreneurs the opportunity to maximize their business potentials through a gamut of services from product conceptualization to commercialization, and contribute significantly to the National Development Goals of food security and energy sufficiency through technology solutions.



The University boasts of a 7.3-hectare Cagayan de Oro campus with state-of-the-art infrastructure and facilities geared towards providing quality education. The conducive and inspiring learning environment with its advanced laboratories and amenities complements its excellent academic instruction and boost students' learning experience. Its Claveria campus boasts of a 101.37-hectare rich agricultural land. USTP’s main campus will eventually be located at the institution’s 295.14-hectare property in Alubijid, Misamis Oriental.



It has maintained its Level IV Status as State University (Highest Distinction) as adjudged by the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) and the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) and continues to be one of the 19 leading state universities in the Philippines.

The University is recognized by the CHED as a Center of Excellence in Information Technology, the only institution in the entire Mindanao awarded with such recognition. It is also recognized as a Center of Development in Mathematics, a Center of Development in Electrical Engineering, and a Center of Development in Agriculture. Moreover, the Department of Energy duly accredited USTP Cagayan de Oro Campus as an Affiliated Renewable Energy Center (AREC).



USTP has a strong workforce and diversified faculty who graduated from leading universities in USA, Europe, Japan, Australia and Thailand, among others. Faculty members have been active in conducting research and innovations in different areas of expertise which provided biotech solutions not only to the Food Industry and Energy Sectors but also to government entities. Researchers are consistent recipients of awards in regional, national and international research and development symposia, research papers published in Thompson Institute for Scientific Information (ISI), journals, international and national refereed journals.



It has existing tie-ups with various industries and agencies particularly through its Food Innovation Center and an active laboratory facility for renewable energy research and development. Its collaborative strength is the expanding coverage of linkages which includes but not limited to the Mushroom Technology and Urban Renewal Planning for Natural Disaster Preventing Responding to Climate Change with Korea International Cooperation Agency(KOICA); Dairy Training Institute with the New Zealand Government; Food and Nutrition Research with Oklahoma State University; Conceiving - Designing - Implementing - Operating(CDIO) Initiative and Learning Express (LEX) Project with Singapore Polytechnic and Temasek Foundation; Professional Science Masters (PSM) courses with Rutgers University; Entrepreneurship with 	University of California –Berkeley thru the Philippine Development Foundation (PhilDev); the ICT HUB with DOST PCIEERD; Institute of Power Economics (IPSEc)with Association of Mindanao Rural Electric Cooperative, Inc. (AMRECO); Research Engagements with CHED, DOST, DOH, DTI, DENR &various agencies; Career Center with Florida State University and USAID-STRIDE; Affiliated Renewable Energy (AREC) with DOE; Food Innovation Center with DOST - DTI-FOPANORMIN; and Technology Solutions for Accelerated Business Processing (Building Permit Management System) for Cagayan de Oro City – with DOST.





	USTP’s Three-Phased Agenda



To effectively and efficiently carry out its mission, the implementation of Republic Act 10919 or the USTP Charter is executed in three phases: Phase 1 (2017-2020) Laying Down the Foundations of the University, Phase 2 (2021-2025) Strengthening the S & T Academe -Economy Ecology, and Phase 3 (2026-2030) Attaining International Recognition as an S & T University.

	

Phase 1 Agendum: Laying Down the Foundations

	

Phase 1, which begins in 2017, consists of harnessing available human and physical resources of the amalgamated SUCs, namely, the Mindanao University of Science and Technology and the Misamis Oriental State College of Agriculture and Technology, to build the foundations upon which the USTP will eventually flourish. Specifically, the academic framework and processes in instruction and research will be established with the active participation of the industries; the University’s faculty specializations and research will be re-examined and re-aligned to match the prospective needs of the university. At the same time, the University will capitalize and build on existing Centers of Excellence and Development as bases for building its niche in Philippine higher education. Research Centers will become the foci upon which research and extension activities shall be based. The Physical Development Plan of the Technoparks shall have been completed and potential private sector participation shall have been secured in this Phase.





Phase 2 Agendum: Strengthening the S&T Academe-Economy Ecology



Phase 2, which begins in 2021, sees the full infrastructure development of the Technoparks	and the strengthening of the academic systems and processes which strongly tie up industry engagements in the spectrum of curricular programs, offerings and research undertakings in the University. These are manifested not only in the manpower development aspect of the three-fold mandate of the University but as well as in the upscaling of the provisions of technology solutions and innovations to the industry partners; and positively influencing the local economy and the society in general.



	

Phase 3 Agendum: Attaining International Recognition as an S&T University





Phase 3, initiating in 2026, witnesses the University’s entry in the international higher education arena with internationally-benchmarked curricular offerings; producing locally-responsive yet internationally acknowledged research outputs as marks of good scholarship, and a seamless environment for a synergistic learning and business/industry interactions as a general framework of operations.

The Proposed Techno Park



The Technological Park and the University of Science and Technology of Southern Philippines Main Campus shall be strategically located in Alubijid, Misamis Oriental in a 300-hectareeducational reserve of the former Mindanao University of Science and Technology (MUST). It is close to the Laguindingan International Airport. This strategic positioning of the University and the Techno Park will stimulate the economy in this part of rural Philippines.



The Technological Park is, in one sense, an Industrial Business Hub of various industries concerned with: Food Security, Energy Sufficiency, Information and Communications, Health and Well-Being, Infrastructure and Transportation, and Technological Innovations. In another sense, it is a one-stop-shop for higher education and training in these crucial areas of national socio-economic development.



The Academe-Industry Technological Park is a practical learning environment for students to learn the ropes and intricacies of real time industrial processes. Since the backbone of industrialization is Science and Technology, the Techno Park is, therefore, a very practical means to develop the country’s pool of scientists and technologists.



The University will continue to transform in the coming years as it will rise and live up to its mandate to provide the best scientific and technological knowledge and skills in the country and all over the world.

PART II – AUDIT OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

	

AUDIT OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS





A. Financial and Compliance Audit





1. 	The accuracy, validity and reliability of the balances of Accounts Receivable and Due from National Government Agencies amounting to P186,764,997.59 and    P260,177,851.33, respectively, could not be ascertained due to (a) recording of income from tuition fees under “Due from National Government Agencies” instead of “Accounts Receivable”, contrary to COA Circular Letter No. 2004-002 dated September 30, 2004; (b) absence of subsidiary ledger(s) and schedule of receivables, contrary to Sec. 12 and 15, Chapter 2, GAM Vol. I and Sec. 27, Chapter 7, GAM Vol. I, thereby affecting the fair presentation of those balances in the financial statements. 



COA Circular Letter No. 2004-002 dated September 30, 2004 prescribes the accounting guidelines and procedures on the proper recording of income from tuition fees of State Universities and Colleges (SUCs).  Paragraph 2.0 enumerates the General Guidelines and procedures thereof, as follows:



“2.1 xxx.  Based on the final assessment of students upon enrollment, the Accounting Unit shall record the “Accounts Receivable” with the corresponding credit to income account “Tuition Fees”.



On the other hand, Sec. 12, Chapter 2, GAM Vol. I prescribes the books of accounts and registries of the National Government (NG) entities to consist of the following:



a)	Journals

xxx

b)	Ledgers

1. General Ledgers 

2. Subsidiary Ledgers 



c)	Registries

xxx



Further, Sec. 27, Chapter 7, GAM Vol. I prescribes the accounting forms and reports to be prepared and maintained by the National Government Agencies, which shall include, among others, the preparation of Schedule of Accounts Receivable.



The prescribed forms of the Subsidiary Ledger and Schedule of Accounts Receivable are herein attached, as presented in Appendix 6 and 55, GAM Vol. II, respectively.



Moreover, Section 15, Chapter 2 of GAM Vol. I provides:



	“The FSs shall present fairly the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in PPSAS. The application of PPSAS, with appropriate disclosures, if necessary, would result in fair presentation of the FS.”	



As of November 30, 2020, the account “Due from National Government Agencies” disclosed a balance of P 260,177,851.33.  Review of the general ledger submitted to our Office disclosed that this account was used to record the billings and collections of tuition fees from the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) since CY 2017 to date.  This runs contrary to the provisions set forth in COA Circular Letter No. 2004-002 dated September 30, 2004 wherein the Accounting Unit shall record the “Accounts Receivable” for income from tuition fees.  



On the other hand, the Subsidiary Ledgers (SLs) showing the transactions and payment history of each client or stakeholder (e.g. CHED, Students, etc.) for the “Accounts Receivable” account were not maintained.  The basic purpose of these SLs is to keep track of each client or stakeholder billings and payments.  However, the preparation of SLs, particularly the students, is onerous if done manually thru the MS Excel.  Thus, the students’ account balances were summarized by the Assessment Office and taken up by the Accounting Office as Accounts Receivable in their books.  No proper and regular monitoring of these accounts were conducted by both offices.  The constraint currently faced by the Assessment personnel is the prompt and fast posting of the details composing the CHED payments to each student account due to its numerous enrollees.  Unless these payments has been posted and the students’ ledger balances are updated, the accounts receivable balance will remain unadjusted.  



In the absence of the appropriate SLs, the schedule of receivable is also affected.  This schedule categorizes the receivables based on the length of time an invoice has been due, in order to determine which clients/ stakeholders to send collection to and who to target for follow up.  In our audit, we observed that the schedule of receivables for the “Accounts Receivable” did not include CHED in the listing.  A copy of the schedule is herein attached, marked Appendix A.    



Further, interview with the accounting staff disclosed that no schedule of receivable for the account “Due from National Government Agencies” was prepared since CY 2017.  The Accounting Unit is faced with the constraint of coping with the intricacies and voluminous transactions at hand since the University heavily relies on the use of MS Excel in the recording and reporting of its financial transactions.   



Based on the foregoing, the non-preparation of the schedules and subsidiary ledgers thereof has affected the accuracy, validity and reliability of the above receivable accounts, thereby, affecting the fair presentation of the financial statements.  



We recommended that management require the Accounting Office to:



a)	Expedite the posting of CHED payments to each student account inorder to update the receivable balances;



b)	Review and update the individual student ledger balances prior to the UniFAST Act and send demand letters for collections;



c)	Conduct regular monitoring and analysis of receivable accounts.  For dormant receivables, submit request for write-off following the procedures in Sec. 8.0, COA Circular No. 2016- 005 dated Dec. 19, 2016;



d)	Retrieve all billing documents and details of payments from CHED and accordingly, update the receivable balances;



e)	Prepare the necessary adjusting journal entry vouchers for the following:

e.1) Reclassification of accounts;

e.2) Correction of inadvertent errors or inaccurate computation; and



f)	Comply with the provisions of Sec. 12 and 15, Chapter 2, GAM Vol. I and Sec. 27, Chapter 7, GAM Vol. I.



Management Comment:



Per University manning and set-up, the responsibility of monitoring account balances has always been with the Assessment. They are tasked with gathering enrolment and assessment data and provide the Accounting Office with the figures. Both Offices, would then reconcile collections and balances periodically.



The management shall be taking the necessary steps to communicate with the assessment, expedite posting of CHED payments and update receivable balances as well as take action on the rest of the recommendations, while the Accounting Unit shall be acting upon recommendations e and f.



Moreover, the management has committed to automate its accounting system to further address this audit observation.



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



The audit team will monitor the compliance of the action/s taken by the management for CY 2021.



2)	Scholarship Funds amounting to P102,864,410.00 were unreliable due to inclusion of (a) CHED free tuition fee payments for 2nd Sem CY 2017-2018 amounting to       P 69,035,104.13 which should have been recorded as income, contrary to COA Circular Letter No. 2004-002 dated September 30, 2004;  (b) receipt of funds for CHED ESGP-PA TES SY 2018-2019 amounting to P 9,558,154.00 which should have been recorded as “Due to NGAs” account, contrary to Chapter 3, GAM Vol. III; (c) transferred funds to USTP Claveria amounting to P 576,000.00; (d) outstanding accounts for verification amounting to P 16,596,281.22; contrary to Sec. 15, Chapter 2, GAM Volume I, thereby affecting the fair presentation thereof of the financial statements. 



Sec. 2.1 of COA Circular Letter No. 2004-002 dated September 30, 2004 states that:



“2.1 xxx.  Based on the final assessment of students upon enrollment, the Accounting Unit shall record the “Accounts Receivable” with the corresponding credit to income account “Tuition Fees”.

Chapter 3, GAM Vol. III, provides the description of the Revised Chart of Accounts.  “School Fees” and “Due to NGAs” are defined as follows:



“School Fees – this account is used to recognize the fees imposed to students of state universities, colleges, and public schools.  It includes tuition, registration, athletic, cultural, diploma and graduation, transcript of records, library training, entrance examination fee, comprehensive examination fee and the like.   xxx”



“Due to NGAs – this account is used to recognize the receipt of funds for delivery of goods/services as authorized by law, fund transfers from NGAs, other than the BIR, for implementation of specific programs or projects and other interagency transactions.”



On the other hand, Sec. 15, Chapter 2, Volume I of Government Accounting Manual (GAM):



“Sec. 15. Fair Presentation. The FSs shall present fairly the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in PPSAS. The application of PPSAS, with appropriate disclosures, if necessary, would result in fair presentation of the FS.”



As of November 30, 2020, the University’s Trust Liabilities account balance under Fund 05 amounted to P 182,337,543.39.  Of this balance, it was determined from the Aging Schedule of Trust Liabilities that Scholarship Fund totaled P 102,864,410.01, and included the following transactions:



a. Receipt of 2nd Sem CY 2017-2018 free tuition fee payments from CHED amounting to            P 69,035,104.13.  Documents culled from the Accounting Office disclosed that these funds were transferred to the University in CY 2018 as shown by the summary schedule of paid tuition subsidy attached to the letter dated August 15, 2018 from the Director, UNIFAST, Quezon City.  The funds constitute free tuition fee payments, hence, should be recorded as income of the school.



b. Receipt of funds for CHED ESGP-PA TES SY 2018-2019 amounting to P 9,558,154.00.  The Tertiary Education Subsidy (TES) is covered by a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between the CHED, UNIFAST and USTP, the objective is to support the cost of tertiary education or any part or portion thereof to eligible students.  Records showed that the University requested for payment of ESGP-PA TES SY 2018-2019 amounting to P 9,558,154.00 as evidenced by their billing statement dated August 20, 2018 and funds were received on December 20, 2018 per O.R. No. 09646595.  These funds should have been appropriately recorded as “Due to NGAs”.   



c. Transferred funds to USTP Claveria amounting to P 576,000.00.  Interview with the Accountant of USTP-Claveria disclosed that these funds were received by the campus and issued with O.R. No. 2199968 dated October 26, 2018.  Hence, the amounts should not have formed part of the Scholarship Fund (under Trust Liabilities).



d. Outstanding accounts for verification amounting to P 16,596,281.22.  Records showed various accounts which remained subject for verification since CY 2016 to date, viz:

Interview with the Head of the Assessment Unit disclosed that for accounts subject “for verification” and “in care of” the satellite campuses, the retrieval of the Scholarship Refund Vouchers (SRV) / Financial Assistance Refund Vouchers (FARV) which contain the list of students found with refund, is arduous and time-consuming considering the elapsed time of more than a year.  Unless these SRVs/ FARVs are retrieved, the reporting of updated and correct balances is not feasible.    



Additionally, retrieval of documents to show the receipt of free tuition payment from CHED for summer, SY 2017-2018 for both USTP-CDO and Claveria campuses amounting to                       P8,295,851.11, and transferred funds from USTP-CDO to USTP-Claveria amounting to           P67,357.50 are still on-going.  Hence, these amounts are not reclassified to their appropriate accounts.   

Based on the foregoing, the use of improper accounts and the failure to report the updated and correct balances caused by non-retrieval of needful documents have affected the accuracy, validity and reliability of the Scholarship Fund balances under Trust Liabilities account and thereby affecting the fair presentation of the financial statements.	   



We recommended that management employ concerted efforts to retrieve the source documents for all outstanding accounts subject for verification of the following transactions, and accordingly, reconcile, update and correct the balances; and prepare the necessary adjusting Journal Entry Vouchers (JEVs).  



	Management Comment:

	

	The Accounting Unit did recognize a receivable from CHED for the tuition and other school fees of students with the understanding that the account Due from National Government Agencies is used to recognize the receivables from the government for the implementation of its programs, or in this instance, RA No. 10931 or An Act Promoting Universal Access to Quality Tertiary Education Providing for Free Tuition and Other School Fees in SUCs, in order to separate accounting for receivables from paying students as well as receivables which are not covered by the Act.

	

	Following the recommendations, the management shall be making the necessary adjustments beginning January 2021.

	

	Auditor’s Rejoinder:

	

	There is no provision mentioned in the RA No. 10931 for proper recording of free tuition and other school fees of students. Moreover, the audit team will monitor the compliance of the action/s taken by management for CY 2021.

	

3.	Unutilized funds amounting to P15,961,293.28 released by CHED Central Office were not covered by a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) but were taken up in the books of accounts, contrary to Chapter 3, Government Accounting Manual (GAM) Vol. III and Sec. 15, Chapter 2, GAM Volume I, thereby resulting to overstatement of cash and trust liabilities balances and affecting the fair presentation thereof of the financial statements. 



Chapter 3, GAM Vol. III, provides the description of the Revised Chart of Accounts.  Specifically, accounts “Cash in Bank-Local Currency, Current Account” and “Trust Liabilities” are defined as follows:



“Cash in Bank-Local Currency, Current Account – this account is used to recognize deposits with AGDBs of income received for which the agency has authority to use; trust receipts authorized under specific contracts and agreements; Revolving Fund under specific laws; and credit advices/ memos received from the AGDBs.  xxx”



“Trust Liabilities – this account is used to recognize the receipt of amount held in trust for specific purpose.  xxx”



On the other hand, Sec. 15, Chapter 2, Volume I of Government Accounting Manual (GAM):



“Sec. 15. Fair Presentation. The FSs shall present fairly the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in PPSAS. The application of PPSAS, with appropriate disclosures, if necessary, would result in fair presentation of the FS.”



Review of the agency’s trial balance for Fund 05 (Special Trust Fund) as of November 30, 2020 disclosed that out of the P 182,337,543.39 total trust liabilities, P 18,242,224.25 were untraced deposits aging 91-365 days of which P 15,961,293.28 were transferred funds from CHED Central Office not covered by a Memorandum of Agreement.  Records showed that these funds were transferred to the University’s Special Trust Fund (STF) DBP account on March 6, 2020.  Inorder to determine the specific purpose and other details of these inter-agency funds, the Accountant handling the STF transactions submitted her query to the CHED Central Office thru an electronic mail dated May 28, 2020.  Per information from the accountant, no response was received by the agency from CHED Central Office.



Pending the official response from CHED Central Office, the University recorded these transferred funds as trust liabilities, with subsidiary ledger of Untraced Deposits.  Considering that these funds were not covered by a MOA, the specific purpose(s) and objectives therefore are not defined.  Based on the description of accounts stated in Chapter 3 of GAM Volume III, this condition resulted to overstatement of cash and trust liabilities balances.

      

We recommended the management to require the Accountant to return to CHED Central Office the transferred funds amounting to P 15,961,293.28 so that it can be used for other priority programs of the government, and prepare the adjusting entries accordingly.



Management Comment:



The management have sent a letter addressed to the Administrative, Financial & Management Service (AFMS), CHED Central Office in Quezon City, in addition to the email that was sent in CY 2020 to inquire for the purpose of which a fund transfer in the amount of P15,961,293.28 was made. In case the fund transfer was erroneous, the management further requested for their bank details so a refund may be processed.



Moreover, the management received a letter-dated February 15, 2021 from the AFMS Officer-in-Charge that the said transfer pertains to settlement of tuition and other school fees for Summer of 2018-2019, with billing statement no. 10-USTP-2018-3-1 dated           July 15, 2019 amounting to P16,887,583.28 and exception report amounting to P925,980.00, under the Free Higher Education of the Universal Access to Quality Tertiary Education (UAQTE) funded by the Unified Student Financial Assistance for Tertiary Education (UniFAST). The net amount due was P15,961,603.28 with bank charges amounting to P310.00, thus, the bank transfer of P15,961,293.28.



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



The audit team will monitor the reclassification of these unutilized funds to their appropriate accounts.

4.	The validity of the reported balance of Other Receivable account is doubtful due to (a) inclusion of inter-fund receivable of P3,141,396.04 without corresponding reciprocal account and (b) existence of dormant account of P342,807.02, contrary to Sec. 15, Chapter 2, Vol. 1 of Government Accounting Manual (GAM), COA Circular 16-005 and Vol. III of GAM, respectively; thereby, overstating/understating affected accounts, affecting the fair presentation of the financial statements. 



Section 15, Chapter 2, Volume I of Government Accounting Manual (GAM):



“Sec. 15. Fair Presentation. The FSs shall present fairly the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in PPSAS. The application of PPSAS, with appropriate disclosures, if necessary, would result in fair presentation of the FS.”



COA Circular 16-005 dated December 19, 2016 provides for the Guidelines and Procedures on the write-off of dormant receivable accounts, unliquidated cash advances, and fund transfers of national government agencies, local government units and government-owned and controlled corporations.



Volume III of GAM defined the Advances to Officers and Employees, Other Receivables, Due to Other Funds and Due from Other Funds accounts.



Validation of the consolidated Other Receivable account balance as of December 31, 2020 revealed the inclusion of inter-fund receivable amount of P3,141,396.04 of Special Trust Fund (STF) which pertains to various taxes and general services for General and IEP funds  but was paid out from the former fund. Further, there was no reciprocal payable account recognized/recorded in the latter fund’s books for that amount.



Other Receivable balance also comprises of P342,807.02 dormant account remained outstanding for 19.9 years for which collection became impossible due to death of the debtor. The same amount was not requested yet with an authority to write-off to this Commission.



Absence of regular verification, analysis, reconciliation of its receivables by the Accounting Office caused the above deficiencies. 



Thereby, overstating/understating affected accounts, affecting the fair presentation of the financial statements.



We recommended the management to require the Accountant to:



a)	Scrutinize the transaction related to inter-fund receivable and if warranted, adjust the books of accounts to properly recognize inter-fund receivable as Due from Other Funds and record the corresponding reciprocal account for General and IEP funds; and



b)	Undertake the procedures provided for under COA Cir. 16-005 dated December 19, 2016 in writing-off the dormant account.



Management Comment:



Per JEV No. 13-12-1373 dated December, 2013, P2,657,840.29 was booked as receivables from the General Fund for transactions previously paid in Special Trust Fund. Upon collection however in January 2014, the amount was credited to Due to Other Funds instead of Due from Other Funds, hence, the balance was closed per GF books and remained outstanding per STF books. A few reclassifications have been implemented afterwards, following the Revised Chart of Accounts and adjustments had been made to the Due to Other Funds/Trust Liabilities Account which were closed to Accumulated Surplus/Deficit.



For the remaining P483,555.75 doubtful balance, the management requested for time extension as this may include amounts that accumulated over time.



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



As of December 31, 2020, the management has not yet submitted the following lacking documents for review and evaluation, viz:

1)	Journal Entry Vouchers (JEVs) to record the collections from the General Fund in January 2014 amounting to P2,657,840.29 following the set-up of receivables from MDS in the STF books per JEV 13-12-1373-S dated December 31, 2013;



2)	JEVs to record the closure of Due to Other Funds/Trust Liabilities Accounts in the STF books to the Accumulated Surplus/Deficit amounting to P2,657,840.29, as mentioned above;



3)	Details/breakdown/itemized list of expenses paid from Special Trust Fund amounting to P3,141,396.04 which were partially replenished from the General Fund

The management has not also apprised our Office on the status of the remaining P483,555.75 doubtful balance.

PART III – STATUS OF IMPLEMENTATION OF PRIOR YEARS’ AUDIT RECOMMENDATIONS

	

STATUS OF IMPLEMENTATION OF PRIOR YEARS’ AUDIT RECOMMENDATIONS 



As of December 31, 2020, of the twenty-five (25) audit recommendations from AARs for CY 2019, 2018 , 2017, 2015 and 2013, twenty (20) are fully implemented, four (4) are partially implemented and one (1) is not implemented, as follows:





Audit Observations

Recommendations

Status of Implementation

2019 AAR



The accuracy and reliability of Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) could not be established due to inclusion of semi-expendable items amounting to                         P 6,188,345.32 contrary to Sec. 4, Chapter 10, Volume I of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), thus, overstating the PPE accounts and its related Accumulated Depreciation and understating the Accumulated Surplus/ Deficit and the Inventory accounts.



We recommended that management direct the Supply Officer and Accountant to  reclassify all semi-expendable properties which were previously recognized as PPE and adjust all affected accounts to have a reliable balance and fair presentation of financial statements. 





FULLY IMPLEMENTED



Accounts Payable totaling P926,379.91 as of December 31, 2019, long outstanding for more than two years, was not reverted to Accumulated Surplus or Deficit, or the Cumulative Results of Operations – Unappropriated (CROU) contrary to DBM and COA Joint Circular No. 99-6 dated November 13, 1999 and Executive Order No. 87 dated August 13, 2019, immobilizing funds that could be useful to other needs of the Agency.



We recommended that the management shall enjoin the Accountant and the Budget Officer to review and analyze all accounts payables and comply with the procedural guidelines provided for by DBM and COA Joint Circular No. 99-6 dated November 13, 1999. Adjust the books of accounts for payables that warrant reversion. 





FULLY IMPLEMENTED



The balance of Construction in Progress account in the amount of                                           P79,017,906.69 has remained open for more than three (3) years and the related unfinished project has been unnecessarily idle, thus, exposing the property to natural elements that may cause deterioration and loss of value; depriving the intended beneficiaries of its immediate and maximum use, and denoting non-responsiveness to the exigencies of the service, contrary to item 4 of COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012.



We recommended that management initiate the immediate “Take-over of Contracts” in order to facilitate the completion of the project, as enunciated in paragraph 7, item IV, Annex “A” of GPPB Resolution 018-2004 dated December 22, 2004 on the Guidelines on the Termination of Contracts.





NOT IMPLEMENTED





In the Board of Regents’  (BOR) meeting held last March 9, 2020, the BOR Resolution No. 59, s. 2020 resolved the following:



1)	To authorize the University President and the Chancellor of USTP-CDO Campus to communicate with Engr. Lao (of Wing-an Construction) to see if he is still amenable to the original unsigned report of the Tripartite Committee on the 48% work accomplishment of the said project;



2)	 Should the parties reach to an agreement for settlement, and as part of the authority vested by this Resolution, the University President may take appropriate action such as proceeding with the payment of the agreed accomplishment rate and the bidding to complete the said project.



On the occasion of the September, 2020 Board Meeting and upon the recommendation of the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), the USTP governing Board resolved to settle the dispute not on the basis of the Tripartite Report but on the basis of a money claim or other actions that Wing-an Construction may choose to avail. 



With the failure to agree based on the signed Tripartite Report, Wing-an Construction filed a complaint before the Construction Industry Arbitration Commission (CIAC) claiming, among others payment for 60% accomplishment technically abandoning the 48% accomplishment he agreed when he signed the Tripartite Report.
