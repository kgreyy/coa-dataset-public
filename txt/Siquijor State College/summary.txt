EXECUTIVE SUMMARY



INTRODUCTION  



In 1920, the Negros Oriental Provincial High School established under its supervision a general high school in the Old Capitol Circle, North Poblacion, Larena, Siquijor.  Later in 1930, it became known as the Larena Sub-Provincial High School, and as the Larena National Vocational School in 1960.   In 1983, pursuant to Batas Pambansa Blg. 387 it was named as the Larena National Vocational College.  By virtue of the passage of House Bill No. 412 which was approved into law (Republic Act No. 7947) on March 3, 1995, Larena National Vocational College was converted into what is now known as Siquijor State College (SSC).

--	to provide effective vocational-technical education and training in industrial, agricultural, fishery, distributive education, and apprenticeship training, in cooperation with the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) of the Department of Labor and Employment, required for immediate entry into the occupations consistent with the manpower requirements of the region, and



--	to provide opportunities for higher education in the fields of technology, teacher education, physical and natural sciences, agriculture, fishery, forestry, nautical, and graduate studies for a progressive executive leadership training.



	The College is governed by a Board of Trustees.  Its administration is vested upon the President, who is appointed by the Board of Trustees.  For Calendar Year (CY) 2020, Dr. Maria Imogen T. Quilicot served as former President assisted by the Vice-Presidents for Administration and for Academic Affairs.

SCOPE OF AUDIT



Our audit covered the accounts of the Siquijor State College (SSC). The audit was conducted to:  (a) verify the level of assurance that may be placed on management’s assertion on the financial statements; (b) recommend agency improvement opportunities; and (c) determine the extent of implementation of prior years’ audit recommendations.



AUDITOR’S REPORT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



The Auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the financial statements of the Siquijor State College for the year ended December 31, 2020 due to the exceptions as stated in the Independent Auditor’s Report and discussed in Part II of this Annual Audit Report.



SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



The following are the significant observations and the corresponding recommendations which are discussed in detail in Part II of this Report:



	1)		The accuracy and existence of Inventory and Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) balances in the books amounting to ₱4,258,299.90 and ₱269,636,844.05, respectively remained unreliable because the Accounting and Supply Office inventory and property records were not reconciled with the results of the physical count contrary to Section 17, Chapter 8 and Section 42, Chapter 10 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies, Volume I.



		We recommended and Management, thru the OIC-College President, agreed to instruct the Inventory Committee to immediately complete the physical count of property and to hasten the preparation of the Report on the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) and the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) so that reconciliation of the same with the supply and property records can finally be made and any differences verified and adjusted accordingly.



1)	Payment of COVID-19 hazard pay to the SSC Officials/Employees and Job Order personnel in the total amount of ₱310,779.18 was not in accordance with Item 4.3 of DBM Budget Circular No. 2020-1 dated March 24, 2020, thus resulting to unauthorized disbursement of public funds.



		We recommended and Management, thru the OIC-College President, agreed to require the concerned personnel to refund the payment of COVID-19 Hazard Pay upon receipt of the Notice of Disallowance (ND) and to henceforth ensure that all disbursements of public funds are in accordance with written guidelines issued by proper authorities.

	





2)	The College did not set aside a portion of their CY 2020 regular appropriations for projects and activities designed for Disaster Risk Reduction and Management (DRRM) activities as required under Section 1, Rule 19 of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of Republic Act No. 10121 known as the “Philippine Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act of 2010”, Section 36 of FY 2020 General Appropriations Act (GAA) and Item III.c of COA Circular No. 2014-002 dated April 15, 2014, thus it was not financially prepared to respond to the needs of the COVID-19 pandemic.



		We recommended and Management, thru the OIC-College President, agreed to instruct the Budget Officer to henceforth comply with the provisions of R.A. 10121 and related guidelines regarding the formulation and implementation of plans, programs, projects and activities related to Disaster Risk Reduction Management and Climate Change so that appropriate funds can be utilized to better prepare for and lessen the impact of the on-going COVID-19 pandemic and other future disasters and calamities. 



1)	Expenses related to COVID-19 in the amount of ₱161,596.53 were charged against the Special Trust Fund (STF) contrary to Section 4(d) of Republic Act No. 8292 known as the “Higher Education Modernization Act of 1997”, Section 18(d) of CHED Memorandum Circular No. 3, series of 2001, the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) for R.A. No. 8292 and Article III of CHED Memorandum Order No. 20 series of 2011. 



	We recommended and Management, thru the OIC-College President, agreed to discontinue charging unrelated expenses to the Special Trust Fund and instead utilize it only in accordance with  Section 4(d) of Republic Act No. 8292 known as the “Higher Education Modernization Act of 1997”, Section 18(d) of CHED Memorandum Circular No. 3, series of 2001, the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) for R.A. No. 8292 and Article III of CHED Memorandum Order No. 20 series of 2011. 

	

1)	Monthly allowances paid to lawyers of the Office of the Solicitor General for legal services rendered to the College amounting to ₱120,000.00 covering the period June to November 2020 were not supported with proof of receipt and supporting documents to evidence that services had been rendered contrary to COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 and Section 5, Chapter 2 of the Government Accounting Manual for NGAs, Volume I, thus the validity of the disbursements cannot be established.



	We recommended and Management, thru the OIC-College President agreed to immediately request the OSG to issue proof of receipt to acknowledge the monthly payments deposited to their Land Bank account amounting to ₱120,000.00 from June to November 2020, including other subsequent payments made in the succeeding year 2021 and to also submit other documents evidencing the services rendered by the OSG to SSC in order to properly establish the validity of the disbursements made.
