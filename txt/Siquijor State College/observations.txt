PART II - AUDIT OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATION



A)	Financial and Compliance Audit



	1)		The accuracy and existence of Inventory and Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) balances in the books amounting to ₱4,258,299.90 and ₱269,636,844.05, respectively remained unreliable because the Accounting and Supply Office inventory and property records were not reconciled with the results of the physical count contrary to Section 17, Chapter 8 and Section 42, Chapter 10 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies, Volume I.

	

Section 17, Chapter 8 of the GAM for National Government Agencies, Volume I prescribes the records, forms and reports to be prepared and/or maintained for Inventories.  Among others, it requires the use of the Stock Card (SC) by the Property and/or Supply Division/Unit and the Supplies Ledger Card (SLC) by the Accounting Division/Unit to record all receipts and issues of supplies and the balance both in quantity and amount at any time.  The SC and SLC are presented in Appendix 58 and 57, respectively of the same Manual.



Instructions on the use of the SC state, among others that “the semestral physical inventory of supplies shall be reconciled with the SLCs and controlling accounts and Supply and/or Property records.  Any discrepancies shall be immediately verified and adjusted.”  Likewise, instructions on the use of the SLC also state, among others, that “the semestral physical inventory of supplies shall be reconciled with the SLCs and controlling accounts and Supply and/or Property records.  Any discrepancies shall be immediately verified and adjusted.”  The semestral physical inventory of supplies referred to shall be reported on the Report on the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) which shall also be reconciled with the SLCs and SCs maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit, and the Property and/or Supply Division/Unit, respectively, and any discrepancy shall be verified and/or adjusted accordingly.



In addition, Section 42, Chapter 10 of the GAM also prescribes the Accounting and Property records to be maintained for PPE.  Among others, it requires the Chief Accountant to maintain the Property, Plant and Equipment Ledger Card (PPELC) to record promptly the acquisition, description, custody, estimated useful life, depreciation, impairment loss, disposal and other information about the asset and for the Property and Supply Office/Unit to maintain the Property Card (PC) to account for the receipt and disposition of the same.  It also requires that the balance per PC shall be reconciled with the PPELC maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit.  The PC and PPELC are presented in Appendix 69 and 70, respectively of the same Manual.





Instructions on the use of the PC and the PPELC also state, among others, that “the report on the physical count of the PPE shall be reconciled with the PCs every year” and that “the PPELC shall be reconciled with the report on the physical count of the PPE, PC and the control accounts”, respectively.  Any discrepancies shall also be immediately verified and adjusted.  The report on the physical count of PPE shall be reported in the RPCPPE form.



For CY 2020, the Inventory Committee was able to conduct the physical count of supplies and property.  However, our verification showed that the physical count of supplies was completed in January 2021 but according to the College Accountant the Inventory Committee has not yet come up with their Report on the Physical Count of inventories.  She added that the physical count of property was not also completed because the Inventory Committee had difficulty in locating some prior years’ items in the list and that they were given by the Chief Administrative Officer until April 15, 2021 to complete the same and prepare their reports.  However, to date, the Inventory Committee was still unable to comply with that directive.



The College Accountant also informed that reports on the physical count of supplies and property have never been completed since she assumed in September 2015 and that sometime in CY 2018, although the Accounting and Supply offices tried to reconcile their records, variances were noted which could not be traced anymore.  After that there was no other further attempt made to reconcile the records between the two offices.



Our verification of the financial statements as of December 31, 2020 showed that total Inventories and PPE accounts amounted to ₱4,258,299.90 and ₱269,636,844.05, respectively as follows:

We are concerned that the accuracy of the foregoing balances of inventories and PPE presented in the financial statements as of December 31, 2020 which constitute 1% and 58%, respectively of the total assets amounting to ₱464,491,186.29 may be unreliable because these have not yet been reconciled with the supply/property records and even with the physical count.  Given the fact that for a considerable number of years, no reconciliation has been made, it could be that most of these recorded supplies and property may no longer be actually existing or have become obsolete and unserviceable. 





	We recommended and Management, thru the OIC-College President, agreed to instruct the Inventory Committee to immediately complete the physical count of property and to hasten the preparation of the Report on the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) and the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) so that reconciliation of the same with the supply and property records can finally be made and any differences verified and adjusted accordingly.













1)	Payment of COVID-19 hazard pay to the SSC Officials/Employees and Job Order personnel in the total amount of ₱310,779.18 was not in accordance with Item 4.3 of DBM Budget Circular No. 2020-1 dated March 24, 2020, thus resulting to unauthorized disbursement of public funds.



DBM Budget Circular No. 2020-1 dated March 24, 2020 which prescribes the guidelines on the grant of COVID-19 Hazard Pay authorizes heads of government agencies to grant COVID-19 Hazard Pay not exceeding ₱500/day per person, subject to certain guidelines and conditions. Among others, Item 4.3 of the of the said DBM Budget Circular provides that “The personnel/workers have been authorized to physically report for work at their respective offices or work stations on the prescribed official working hours by the head of agency/office during the period of implementation of Enhanced Community Quarantine measures in the area of such office of work station.”  (Emphasis ours)



At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Province of Siquijor, by virtue of Executive Order No. 017, series of 2020 issued by the Provincial Governor, was placed under General Community Quarantine starting March 24, 2020 at 9:00 PM until April 6, 2020 at 12 midnight.  



In our post-audit of  transactions for  COVID-19 related expenses, we noted that COVID-19  hazard pay for the period March 19 to 31, 2020 in the total amount of ₱310,779.18 (please see Annex A for details) was paid to 108 officials/employees and job order personnel.  However, since Siquijor Province was not implementing Enhanced Community Quarantine during this period, the grant of the COVID-19 Hazard Pay would not apply.



The Accountant informed us that somebody from the DBM office told them that they were entitled to the COVID-19 Hazard Pay regardless of the type of quarantine so long as it is under community quarantine.  However, the person who informed them about that later on apologized and said that based on their guidelines, only those under ECQ were entitled to the payment.  Unfortunately, the payment for hazard pay had already been released when the Accountant received the follow up information.



Considering that the entire Siquijor Province was placed only under General Community Quarantine from March 24 to April 6, 2020, the payment of COVID-19 Hazard Pay amounting to ₱310,779.18 covering the said period has no legal basis because only those placed under Enhanced Community Quarantine or ECQ are entitled thereto pursuant to the aforementioned DBM Budget Circular No. 2020-1 dated March 24, 2020. This resulted to unauthorized disbursement of public funds.



The OIC – College President acknowledged the erroneous transaction made and instructed the Accountant to henceforth strictly follow written guidelines issued by proper authorities.





	We recommended and Management, thru the OIC-College President, agreed to require the concerned personnel to refund the payment of COVID-19 Hazard Pay upon receipt of the Notice of Disallowance (ND) and to henceforth ensure that all disbursements of public funds are in accordance with written guidelines issued by proper authorities.

	



2)	The College did not set aside a portion of their CY 2020 regular appropriations for projects and activities designed for Disaster Risk Reduction and Management (DRRM) as required under Section 1, Rule 19 of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of Republic Act No. 10121 known as the “Philippine Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act of 2010”, Section 36 of FY 2020 General Appropriations Act (GAA) and Item III.c of COA Circular No. 2014-002 dated April 15, 2014, thus it was not financially prepared to respond to the needs of the COVID-19 pandemic.



Section 1, Rule 19 of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of RA 10121 provides that the  “NDRRMF is appropriated in the annual GAA which shall be used for disaster risk reduction or mitigation, prevention and preparedness activities such as, but not limited to training of personnel, procurement of equipment and capital expenditures.  It can also be utilized for relief, recovery, reconstruction and other work or services in connection with natural or human-induced calamities which may occur during the budget year or those that occurred in the past two (2) years from the budget year.”



COA Circular No. 2014-002 dated April 15, 2014 also provides the accounting and reporting guidelines on the Disaster Risk Reduction and Management (DRRM) Fund which includes the funds sourced from the agency regular budget for the DRRM program.  Item III.c thereof provides that “All departments, bureaus, offices and agencies of the government are hereby authorized to use a portion of their appropriations to implement projects designed to address DRRM activities in accordance with the guidelines to be issued by the NDRRMC in coordination with the Department of Budget and Management (DBM).”



Finally, Section 36 of the General Provisions of the General Appropriations Act of 2020 or R.A. No. 11465 echoes the foregoing provision stating that “All agencies of the government shall plan and implement programs and projects, taking into consideration measures for climate change adaptation and mitigation, and disaster risk reduction, based on climate and disaster risk assessments.  x x x.”



In our verification of the College’s annual budget for CY 2020, we found out that there was no provision made for disaster risk reduction management and climate change adaptation activities.  The Budget Officer informed us that there was no allocation provided for DRRM because plans were not formulated in CY 2020 due to the retirement of the person in-charge.   



R.A. 10121 or the “Philippine Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act of 2010” was enacted into law to demonstrate the importance given by the Government to mainstream Disaster Risk Reduction and Management (DRRM) in the development processes to better prepare for and lessen the impact of deadly and costly natural and man-made hazards/disasters with the goal of promoting sustainable socio-economic growth.



During the year, due to the COVID-19 pandemic which struck not just the country in particular but the whole world in general, Philippine President Rodrigo Roa Duterte issued the following:



1)	Proclamation No. 922 dated March 8, 2020 declaring a state of public health  emergency throughout the Philippines due to the outbreak of COVID-19 and the confirmation by the Secretary of Health of local transmission of the Corona Virus Disease in the Philippines;



2)	Proclamation No. 929 dated March 16, 2020 declaring a state of calamity throughout the Philippines due to COVID-19 for a period of six (6) months effective March 16, 2020; and



3)	Proclamation No. 1021 extending the period of the state of calamity throughout the Philippines due to COVID-19 for a period of one (1) year, effective 13 September 2020 to 12 September 2021, unless earlier lifted or extended as circumstances may warrant.



The foregoing declarations capacitated all government agencies and LGUs to immediately act to prevent the loss of life and utilize appropriate resources to implement urgent and critical measures to contain and/or prevent the spread of COVID-19, mitigate its effects and impacts to the community as well as prevent the serious disruption of basic government services.  The National Government as well as LGUs were given ample latitude to utilize appropriate funds, including the Quick Response Fund, in their disaster preparedness and response efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19 and continue providing basic services to the affected population.



However, because the College did not set aside a portion of its regular agency budget in CY 2020 for DRRM activities, its response to the effects of the pandemic were limited to only the purchase of basic disinfectants such as alcohol and bleach already included in their annual procurement plan amounting to ₱42,091.25 (see Annex B for details).  In fact, considering that the regular appropriations from the General Appropriations Act (GAA) were not significant and there was still a need to procure personal protective equipment (PPEs), thermal scanners and more disinfectants, a portion of the Special Trust Fund (STF) amounting to ₱161,596.53 (see Annex B for details) was utilized, which is the subject of another audit observation considering that the STF being a trust fund, was to be used only for the specific purpose for which fiduciary fees lodged therein were collected.

Therefore, had the College allocated a portion of their regular budget for DRRM programs and activities, it could have used appropriate funds for immediate response and critical measures to contain and prevent the spread of COVID-19 or any disaster for that matter, and mitigate its impact to the community.





	We recommended and Management, thru the OIC-College President, agreed to  instruct the Budget Officer to henceforth comply with the provisions of R.A. 10121 and related guidelines regarding the formulation and implementation of plans, programs, projects and activities related to Disaster Risk Reduction Management and Climate Change so that appropriate funds can be utilized to better prepare for and lessen the impact of the on-going COVID-19 pandemic and other future disasters and calamities. 





3)	Expenses related to COVID-19 in the amount of ₱161,596.53 were charged against the Special Trust Fund (STF) contrary to Section 4(d) of Republic Act No. 8292 known as the “Higher Education Modernization Act of 1997”, Section 18(d) of CHED Memorandum Circular No. 3, series of 2001, the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) for R.A. No. 8292 and Article III of CHED Memorandum Order No. 20 series of 2011. 



Section 4(d) of R.A. No. 8292 provides that:  “…any income generated by the university or college from tuition fees and other charges, as well from the operation of auxiliary services and land grants, shall be retained by the university or college, and may be disbursed by the Board of Regents/Trustees for instruction, research, extension, or other programs/projects of the university or college:  Provided, That all fiduciary fees shall be disbursed for the specific purposes for which they are collected.” (Emphasis ours)



The foregoing provision is also reiterated in Section 18(d) of CHED Memorandum Circular No. 3, series of 2001, the IRR for R.A. No. 8292. 



Moreover, Sections 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 and 16 of Article III of CHED Memorandum Order No. 20, series of 2011 provides the Specific Budgetary Allocation of the Special Trust Fund (STF), as follows:



1.  Faculty and Staff Development

	2.  Curriculum Development

	3.  Student Development

	4.  Facilities Development

	5.  Research Services

	6.  Extension Services

	7.  Production

	8.  Administrative Services

	9.  Reserve

Our audit of transactions for CY 2020 disclosed that expenses for COVID-19 in the total amount of ₱161,596.53 were charged against the Special Trust Fund, as follows:

Other Supplies and Materials Expenses:

₱112,143.90

3.  Thermal Scanners

11,000.00

Total

₱161,596.53



However, it is clear from the aforecited regulations that the STF can be disbursed only for specific programs/projects of the College and the expenses utilized for COVID-19 do not belong to any of these.



The College Accountant explained that the expenses for COVID-19 such as disinfectants were charged to the STF because these were already included in the Agency Procurement Plan (APP) to be used for their normal operations.   The PPEs and thermal scanners, on the other hand, were charged to the STF even though these were not part of the APP because these were necessary to effectively respond to the pandemic.



It bears stressing that the fiduciary fund should be disbursed only for the specific purpose for which it was collected and the STF is intended only for instruction, research, extension, or other program/projects of the College which are necessary for the attainment of the College’s goals and objectives to provide quality education.



The expenses for disinfectants and Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs) incurred by the College in response to the COVID-19 pandemic should have been charged to its regular agency budget or better still to the Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Fund (DRRMF) which the agency is allowed to provide as mandated in the General Appropriations Act in order for it to be properly prepared and appropriately respond to impending calamities.











	We recommended and Management, thru the OIC-College President, agreed to discontinue charging unrelated expenses to the Special Trust Fund and instead utilize it only in accordance with  Section 4(d) of Republic Act No. 8292 known as the “Higher Education Modernization Act of 1997”, Section 18(d) of CHED Memorandum Circular No. 3, series of 2001, the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) for R.A. No. 8292 and Article III of CHED Memorandum Order No. 20 series of 2011. 

	

	

1)	Monthly allowances paid to lawyers of the Office of the Solicitor General for legal services rendered to the College amounting to ₱120,000.00 covering the period June to November 2020 were not supported with proof of receipt and supporting documents to evidence that services had been rendered contrary to COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 and Section 5, Chapter 2 of the Government Accounting Manual for NGAs, Volume I, thus the validity of the disbursements cannot be established.



COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 enumerates the documentary requirements for common government transactions and the general requirements for all types of disbursements which includes, among others, that claims against government funds shall be supported with complete documentation and that there should be sufficient and relevant documents to establish validity of the claim.  The same requirements are reiterated in Section 5, Chapter 2 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for NGAs, Volume I.



In our post-audit of the College’s transactions for CY 2020, we noted that the Siquijor State College (SSC) entered into a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with the Office of the Solicitor General to engage the legal services of the OSG lawyers from June 2020 to May 2021 who shall be paid an allowance aggregating ₱20,000.00 per month, as follows:



Solicitor General

₱7,000.00

Assistant Solicitor General

6,500.00

Senior State Solicitor General

6,500.00

Total

₱20,000.00



The MOA provides that the OSG “shall provide legal services to the Siquijor State College and its officials including providing them with legal advice and representing them in litigations” and the SSC shall in accordance with law and throughout the period that the OSG services are rendered, “binds itself to give monthly allowances from its sundry operating and other expense funds” to the Solicitor General, Assistant Solicitor General and Senior State Solicitor, monthly allowance of ₱7,000.00, and ₱6,500.00 each, respectively.  According to the SSC Accountant, these rates were pre-determined solely by the OSG in crafting the MOA.



Results of audit showed that the monthly allowances of the OSG lawyers were charged to the appropriation for Professional Services in the MDS Fund, as follows:

Our examination of the six disbursement vouchers covering the payment of the monthly allowances for the OSG lawyers which were deposited to the OSG’s account in accordance with the MOA, showed the following deficiencies:



1)	No proofs of receipt were issued by the OSG to acknowledge the payments made by the SSC;



2)	There were no sufficient and relevant documents attached to the voucher to establish that services were rendered by the Solicitor General, Assistant Solicitor General and Senior State Solicitor for the month that they were paid allowances by the SSC contrary to COA Circular No. 2012-001 and Section 5, Chapter 2 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I; and



3)	The monthly allowances for the OSG were charged to the appropriation for Professional Services under Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses in the SSCs MDS Fund.   However, this is contrary to the MOA which provides that the monthly allowances shall come from the SSC sundry operating and other expense funds which refer to Other Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses.



The College Accountant explained that she was just instructed by the former College President to process the monthly allowances of the OSG lawyers.  When the former College President took a leave of absence until her retirement, the one who took over informed that she did not request any legal advice from the OSG nor asked them to represent the SSC in litigations.  She added that it was the former College President who asked legal representation from the OSG.  In view of this, considering that there is really no need for the services of the OSG at the moment, the College may want to reconsider renewing their MOA which expires in May 2021 to avoid the incurrence of unnecessary expenditures.  The SSC can just request the OSG’s assistance when the need arises.







Since the College Accountant recorded the OSGs monthly allowances as debits to the Legal Services account which is described in the revised chart of accounts to recognize costs incurred for authorized legal services rendered by private lawyers or lawyers from other agencies including special counsel allowances, then the necessary documentary requirements should have also been complied with.



In view of the absence of the proof of receipt from the OSG to acknowledge the payments made by the SSC as well as the lack of any documentary evidence on the services rendered by them to the College, the validity of the payments for the monthly allowances paid to the three OSG officials amounting to ₱120,000.00 cannot be established.





	We recommended and Management, thru the OIC-College President agreed to immediately request the OSG to issue proof of receipt to acknowledge the monthly payments deposited to their Land Bank account amounting to ₱120,000.00 from June to November 2020, including other subsequent payments made in the succeeding year 2021 and to also submit other documents evidencing the services rendered by the OSG to SSC in order to properly establish the validity of the disbursements made.

	



B)	Compliance with Tax Laws



The College complied with withholding tax laws and the amounts withheld were remitted promptly to the Bureau of Internal Revenue.  





C)	Gender and Development (GAD)



The GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) and GAD Accomplishment Reports (AR) for CY 2020 were returned by the Philippine Commission on Women (PCW) for revision in accordance with the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic non-compliance with some of their activities, respectively.





D)	Compliance with RA No. 8291

	

For the year 2020, Management has complied with GSIS, HDMF and PhilHealth rules and regulations pertaining to premium and loan payments withheld from employees.









E)	Status of Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges
