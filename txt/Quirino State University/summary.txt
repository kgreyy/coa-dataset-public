D)		Auditor’s Opinion on the Financial Statements

	

		We rendered a modified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the financial statements of Quirino State University for the year ended December 31, 2020 due to the following deficiencies noted which are discussed in detail in the Part II of this report: 



a)	Non-reconciliation of the cost balances of Property, Plant and Equipment with the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE), with a discrepancy amounting P363,061,502.14;

b)	Overstatement of Construction in Progress (CIP) by P263,572,197.59 due to Management’s non-reclassification of completed projects to the corresponding asset accounts, resulting in non-recognition of their corresponding previous and current year’s depreciation expenses;

c)	Non-provision of Depreciation Expenses on related depreciable assets, thereby, overstating the Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) account, with total cost of P117,522,907.27, and understating the expenses of the University; 

d)	Incorrect recognition of Accounts Payable and other related accounts for obligations amounting to P10,951,315.63 and P14,588,917.56 pertaining to undelivered goods/unfinished infrastructure projects and unsubstantiated with documentary evidences;

e)	Due to National Government Agencies (NGAs) account amounting to P3,661,216.25 cannot be ascertained and remained unliquidated because of non-preparation of Subsidiary Ledgers or other compensating organized records supporting thereof; and

f)	Non-submission of transaction vouchers amounting to P7,585,666.00 which precluded the Audit Team to validate their veracity and propriety.





E)			Summary of Significant Observations and Recommendations

	

1)	Lapses were committed by the Management in the procurement of seven (7) infrastructure projects through adjacent contracts amounting to P6,086,553.59 in violation of the provisions of Sections 53 and 54 of Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (RIRR) of Republic Act (RA) 9184, resulting to possible loss of P93,514.12 and putting the University in a disadvantageous position.



We recommended that Management instruct the:



a)	Engineers in-charge to prepare the programs of works in details, supported with Detailed Engineering, PERT/CPM and others, as reference for the Scope of Work to be negotiated and must be included as part of the contract of agreement;



b)	Budget Officer to realign the charging of movable furniture and fixtures and other equipment included on construction/improvement of buildings to their appropriate budget allocations;

c)	BAC or another authorized person to communicate to the contractor to adjust the prices of those items with higher unit prices than its original contract amounting to P93,514.12, otherwise, this will be disallowed in the audit;



d)	BAC, TWG and other concerned personnel to evaluate carefully the scope of work, unit prices, terms of references and other conditions of the contract before awarding them to the contractors and to adhere to the provisions of Section 53 of RA 9184 on Negotiated Procurement concerning adjacent or contiguous contracts;



e)	HOPE or other authorized people to carefully craft the Contract of Agreement, instead of Purchase Orders, to include among others, the Detailed Scope of Works, duration, specifications and other conditions necessary to procure certain projects; and



f)	Accounting Unit to properly pre-audit the payments of adjacent contracts to ensure that only those allowed according to the rules and regulations are paid.



2)	The Management of Maddela Campus authorized the purchase of various construction materials and office supplies amounting to P1,344,527.25 even if the Canvass/Request for Quotations (RFQs) were fabricated in favor of certain supplier/s, casting doubt on the integrity, regularity and legitimacy of the procurements made.



We recommended that Management of Maddela Campus:



a)	ensure that the procurement process is being adhered to pursuant to the provisions of RA 9184 and other applicable law, rules and regulations before any contract is awarded to the winning suppliers;



b)	require the Supply Officer to discontinue the practice of fabricating Canvass or Request for Quotations in favor of certain supplier/s.  Oblige him to canvass prices and/or request for quotations from at least three (3) suppliers of known qualifications, if needed, and always ensure the legitimacy and veracity of all canvass and RFQs;



c)	investigate the conspiracy between the Supply Officer and the suppliers in the falsification of canvasses and if warranted, to blacklist the same from the rosters of the University’s suppliers pursuant to rules and regulations, and;



d)	require the Supply Officer to submit justification/s why canvass of prices and/or request for quotations from at least three (3) suppliers of known qualifications were not made and why he should not be charged administratively pursuant to Revised Penal Code.



3)	Goods amounting to P1,127,651.00 were purchased from suppliers whose existence is doubtful due to the absence of legally, currently operating physical store, contrary to the provision of RA 9184.



We recommended that Management shall:



a)	deal only with suppliers or contractors with integrity and known to be legitimate and directly engaged in trading the products being procured;  



b)	validate the existence of roster of suppliers to ensure that the University is dealing with legitimate, genuine and technically capable suppliers or contractors, through verification of their submitted documents and existence of currently operating stores or are not fly by night dealers/suppliers;



c)	lastly, blacklist from the roster those suppliers who are found to be doubtful or of questionable existence and not patronizing their products.



4)	Overtime services were rendered on regular basis rather than on circumstances provided by the Civil Services Commission (CSC) and Department of Budget and Management (DBM) Joint Circular No. 02, s. 2015, resulting in the incurrence of unnecessary overtime pay of P88,310.57.



We recommended that:



a)	the University President must be more circumspect in authorizing the rendition of overtime services and ensure that an appropriate overtime work program is submitted for the approval of overtime services.  He must ascertain that rendition of overtime services shall be authorized only when extremely necessary and when the activities warrant the rendition thereof according to the Joint Circular above;



b)	the Accounting Unit and Cashier ensure that documentary requirements for the overtime pay must be proper and attached to the claims before processing and payment thereof.  Ensure that the accomplishment reports are quantified and support the duration of the overtime rendered;



c)	all concerned personnel to submit the proper overtime work program of the rendered overtime services, Accomplishment Report indicating the quantity of work accomplished per day or an hour and duly signed by their immediate supervisor, and other documents supporting their claims.  Otherwise, these will be disallowed in the audit;



d)	Management stop allowing the Cashier to act as collecting officer every Saturdays so as not to violate the segregation of duties and to ensure that rendition of overtime services are pursued with the most economical method in achieving the outputs or outcome expected; and

e)	Management must ensure that all Offices plan their work of activities to avoid the incurrence of overtime services for the performance of routine works and activities, and if circumstances warrant the rendition of overtime services, it must strictly adhere to the provisions of CSC-DBM Joint Circular No. 02, s. 2015 and the documentary requirements prescribed by COA Circular No. 2012-001.

This unsettled disallowance is reflected quarterly in the Report and Analysis of Disallowances and Charges.  This amount represents the deficiencies noted by the COA TAS RO2 in the construction of the College Administration Building.  However, the identified liable persons are no longer connected to the University and some are already deceased.
