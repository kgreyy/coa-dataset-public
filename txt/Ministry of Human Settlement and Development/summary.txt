The MHSD is a newly created agency under the Bangsamoro Autonomous in Muslim 

Mindanao (BARMM). With the approval of the Bangsamoro Transition Plan by the

ARMM have been merged with the Ministry. 

 

In March 2020, the Ministry received its first funding from the Ministry of Finance,

The said fund is part of the Bangsamoro Appropriation Act of 2020.

D. Scope of Audit 
 

The audit covered the financial transactions and operations of the MHSD for CY 2020. 

 

E. Auditor’s Report 
 

The Auditor rendered an unqualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the 

financial statements of MHSD as of December 31, 2020. 

 

F. Summary of Observations and Recommendations 
 

1. Replenishment of Petty Cash Fund (PCF) were not sufficiently supported with duly 
accomplished and approved Petty Cash Vouchers (PCVs), Report on Paid Petty Cash 

Vouchers (RPPCV), approved purchase request with certificate of Emergency 

Purchase if necessary, Inspection and Acceptance Report (IAR), Waste Materials 

Report (WMR), Approved Trip Tickets, among others, as required by regulation, thus 

the validity and authority for disbursements made out of the PCF for various expenses 

of the Ministry could not be fully ascertained. (Observation No. 1) 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the AFD to: (a) instruct the Petty 

Cash Custodian to submit the required supporting documents for payments made out 

of the PCF; and (b) henceforth, ensure that all disbursements made out of the PCF are 

supported with complete documentation. 

 



iv 

 

2. The balance of the Advances to Officers and Employees account amounting to 
₱502,920.00 as of December 31, 2020 remains unliquidated/unsettled due to 

unsubmitted liquidation documents. (Observation No. 2) 

 

We recommended that Management faithfully adhere to the rules and regulations on 

the grant, utilization and liquidation of cash advances, ensure proper monitoring 

pursuant to Section 89, PD 1445, and require all Accountable Officers (AOs) to 

settle/liquidate immediately their cash advances (CAs) within the prescribed period, 

once the purpose for said advances are already served, otherwise, send demand letters 

to liquidate the same and refund all remaining unutilized balances, or cause the 

withholding of salaries of personnel with outstanding accounts, if warranted; and 

refrain from granting new or additional advances to AOs with unliquidated CAs. 

 

3. Regular monitoring and analysis to establish completeness, existence, accuracy and 
correctness pursuant to COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016 in 

relation to Section 111 of PD 1445 of the Ministry’s Accounts Receivables account 

amounting to ₱38.4 million as at December 31, 2020 could not be undertaken, as no 

copies of the Subsidiary Ledger Cards (SLCs) of the individual clients of the Ministry’s 

housing project were furnished to COA. Moreover, the required disclosures in the 

Notes to Financial Statements under GAM Volume I were not sufficiently complied 

with. (Observation No. 3) 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require: (a) the AFD to submit a detailed 

list of all clients comprising the balance of the Accounts Receivables as at December 

31, 2020 and the individual SLCs from the Accounting; and (b) the Accounting to 

henceforth make the necessary disclosures in the Notes to Financial Statements in such 

detail as is necessary to meet the needs of the agency and at the same time be adequate 

to furnish the information needed by fiscal or control agencies of the government 

pursuant to Section 111 of PD 1445. 

 

4. The completeness, existence, accuracy and correctness of the balances of Inventory 
Held for Sale accounts of the Ministry totaling ₱40.01 million as of December 31, 2020 

could not be readily ascertained due to non-conduct of physical count and non-

submission of the Report of Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) for these assets as 

required by regulation. (Observation No. 4) 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Inventory Committee to 

henceforth regularly comply with the conduct of physical count and submission of the 

report. 

 

5. Stock Ledger Cards (SLCs) and Stock Cards (SCs) were not kept and maintained for 
supplies by the Accounting and Supply Unit, respectively. Moreover, the recording of 

the related supplies expense was not supported with the Report of Supplies and 

Materials Issued (RSMI) as required by GAM. (Observation No. 5) 

 

We recommended that Management require: (a) the Accounting Division/Unit to keep 

and maintain SLCs and the Property and/or Supply Division/Unit to keep and maintain 

SCs for each item in stock and to facilitate regular reconciliation of records; and (b) the 

Property and/or Supply Division/Unit to prepare and submit monthly RSMI to be used 



v 

 

by the Accounting Division/Unit as basis in preparing the Journal Entry Voucher (JEV) 

to record the supplies and materials issued. 

 

6. The accuracy and correctness of the balances amounting to ₱1.2 million of the Other 
Assets account of the Ministry as of December 31, 2020 could not be ascertained due 

to absence of details/list and subsidiary records supporting such balances, which is 

essential in view of the provisions of pertinent law. (Observation No. 6) 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accounting to keep and 

maintain details/list and subsidiary records of all accounts where necessary in 

compliance with the applicable law. 

 

7. Property Acknowledgment Receipts (PARs), Property Cards (PCs) and Property, Plant 
and Equipment Ledger Cards (PPELCs) were not kept and maintained on file for the 

Ministry’s Property, Plant and Equipment (PPEs) as required under the regulation, thus 

the reliability of the Property, Plant and Equipment accounts with carrying amount 

₱5.89 million as of December 31, 2020 could not be fully ascertained and the 

discrepancies between the records of the Accounting and that of the Property Unit could 

not be reconciled. (Observation No. 7) 

 

We recommended that Management require the Accounting Office/Unit to keep and 

maintain PPELCs and the Property and Supply Office/Unit to keep and maintain PARs 

and PCs for all items of Property, Plant and Equipment pursuant to Section 42, Chapter 

10 of the GAM Volume I and to aid in the regular reconciliation of Accounting and 

Property records. 

 

8. Properties of the Ministry were not labelled with Property Identification and Coding 
and PARs were not issued to officer or employee who receives and is in actual 

possession or physical control of the property. (Observation No. 8) 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the AFD to: (a) instruct the 

Property & Supply Officer to comply with Item V.2 of COA Circular No. 80-124 on 

Property Identification and Coding of all the Ministry’s fixed assets; and (b) instruct 

the Property & Supply Officer to issue PARs and renew the same every three (3) years 

or every time there is change in actual possession or physical control of the asset, to 

establish responsibility and accountability over the same. 

 

9. Depreciation Expense accounts for various items of PPEs were not recognized during 
the year, resulting in the misstatement of the Depreciation Expenses, Accumulated 

Depreciation, and the book value of the related assets. (Observation No. 9) 

 

We recommended that Management require: (a) the AFD to coordinate with previous 

accountable officers of the RHRDA or HLURB, where appropriate, to retrieve records 

necessary to establish the accuracy and correctness of the recorded assets; and (b) the 

Accounting Division/Unit consequently to recognize depreciation expense relative to 

these assets, where applicable. 

 

10. Copies of more or less 56 perfected contracts, purchase/work orders (PO/WO) and their 
supporting documents entered into by the Ministry with third parties totaling to more 



vi 

 

or less ₱27.5 million were not furnished to COA within five (5) working days as 

required by regulation; thus, deficiency, if any, was not timely identified, and results 

of verification were not promptly communicated to Management. (Observation No. 10) 

 

We recommended that Management require the Chief of the AFD to submit copies of 

all contracts/POs/WOs and its supporting documents to COA within the prescribed 

period, for timely review of the legal and auditorial aspects of said transactions. 

 

11. Repairs and maintenance transactions of the Ministry were paid despite deficiencies in 
the documents to support the necessity and propriety of the claims, contrary to the 

provisions of Section 9.1.3.4 of COA Circular No. 2012-001.  (Observation No. 11) 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to henceforth require the AFD to maintain 

an adequate and effective internal control that requires the submission of documentary 

requirements in conformity with laws, rules and regulations and a thorough review of 

all the supporting documents to establish the validity and propriety of the amount 

claimed.   

 

12. JEVs for cash receipts and/or non-cash transactions totaling ₱80.18 million for calendar 
year 2020, were not prepared and submitted to COA as required under the pertinent 

provisions of the GAM, resulting in the delay in audit of the agency’s transactions 

specifically pertaining to cash receipts and non-cash transactions such as year-end 

adjusting entries. (Observation No. 12) 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accounting to submit the 

JEVs together with all supporting documents pertaining to the cash receipts and non-

cash transactions amounting to ₱80.18 million and henceforth regularly prepare and 

submit all JEVs as basis for recording all transactions of the agency, whether cash 

receipts, cash disbursements or non-cash transactions. 

  

13. Report of Collections and Deposits (RCDs) together with supporting documents such 
as duplicate copies of official receipts and bank-validated deposit slips as well as 

Report of Accountability for Accountable Forms (RAAF) were not submitted by the 

concerned accountable officer of the agency for audit purposes in compliance with the 

provisions of law and COA regulations, thus, the completeness, existence, accuracy 

and correctness of the reported collections of the agency of ₱606,939.75 could not be 

fully ascertained. (Observation No. 13) 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the AFD to strictly ensure that 

concerned accountable officer in charge/designated as collecting officer regularly 

prepare and submit the required RCDs together with supporting documents such as 

duplicate copies of official receipts and validated deposit slips. 

 

14. Properties of the Ministry were exposed to risk of unnecessary losses in the event of 
damage to, or loss of, such assets and properties as the agency was not able to obtain 

adequate insurance coverage for the insurable assets and properties during the year 

pursuant to existing law and COA regulations. (Observation No. 14) 

 



vii 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the submission of an updated 

inventory of all insurable properties to the General Insurance Fund (GIF) using the 

form prescribed by the GSIS for determination and approval of appropriate insurance 

coverage; and obtain an adequate insurance coverage for the insurable assets and 

properties with the GIF in order to indemnify or compensate the Government from any 

damage to, or loss of, its properties due to fire, earthquake, storm, or other casualty. 

 

G. Status of Implementation of Prior Year’s Audit Recommendations 
 

The MHSD is a newly created agency of the BARMM, hence, there were no prior 

years’ audit recommendations.

Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements 

 

Unqualified Opinion 

We have audited the financial statements of the Ministry of Human Settlement and 

Development (MHSD), which comprise the statement of financial position as at 

December 31, 2020 and the statement of financial performance, statement of cash flows, 

statement of changes in net assets/equity, and statement of comparison of budget and 

actual amounts for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a 

summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information. 

In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material 

respects, the financial position of MHSD as at December 31, 2020, and its financial 

performance, statements of cash flows, statement of changes in net assets/equity, 

statement of comparison of budget and actual amounts for the year then ended, and notes 

to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies in 

accordance with Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standards (PPSASs). 

Basis for Opinion 

We conducted our audit in accordance with the International Standards of Supreme Audit 

Institutions (ISSAIs). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in 

the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our 

report. We are independent of the Ministry of Human Settlement and Development in 

accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial 

statements, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with 

these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and 

appropriate to provide a basis for our unqualified audit opinion. 

Responsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements 

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial 

statements in accordance with the PPSAS, and for such internal control as management

determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free 

from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements 

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements 

as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to 

issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level 

of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISSAIs 

will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from 

fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could 

reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of 

these financial statements. 

As part of an audit in accordance with ISSAIs, we exercise professional judgement and 

maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: 

1. Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, 
whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to 

those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a 

basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting 

from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve 

collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of 

internal control. 

2. Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design 
audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose 

of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the MHSD’s internal control.  

3. Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of 
accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management. 

4. Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements 
including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the 

underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

MINISTRY OF HUMAN SETTLEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT 

Notes to Financial Statements 

For the Year Ended December 31, 2020 
 

1. General Information/Agency Profile 
 

1.1. The financial statements of the MHSD were authorized for issue on February 
10, 2021 as shown in the Statement of Management Responsibility for 

Financial Statements signed by its Minister, Atty. Hamid Aminoddin D. Barra. 

1.2. The MHSD was created by virtue of Section 8 letter L of RA 11054 or the 
Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, 

which provides among others that the interim cabinet shall be composed of 

fifteen (15) Primary Ministries with sub offices which includes the Ministry of 

Human Settlements and Development. With the approval of the Bangsamoro 

Transition Plan by the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, the RHRDA and the 

HLURB have been merged with the Ministry. 

 

1.3. The Ministry shall act as the primary government entity responsible for the 
management of housing, human settlements, rural and urban development. It 

shall be the sole and main planning and policy making, regulatory, program 

consolidation, and performance monitoring entity of all housing, human 

settlement, rural and urban development concerns, primarily focusing on the 

access to and the affordability of basic human need. It shall develop and adopt 

a regional strategy to immediately address the provision of adequate, decent 

and affordable housing and basic services to the underprivileged and homeless 

citizens, former MILF combatants, family of martyrs, Internally Displaced 

Persons (IDPs), residents in the danger zones, informal settlers, and other 

needy sectors in the Bangsamoro urban/ rural and island communities and 

resettlement areas. 

1.4. The Ministry is managed by the Minister together with the Deputy Minister 
and Bangsamoro Director General appointed by the Interim Chief Minister. 

The organization set-up of the Ministry includes three divisions that carry out 

MHSD’s numerous functions, namely: Administrative and Finance Division 

(AFD); Housing and Human Settlement Division (HHSD); and Policy 

Development Coordination & Regulation Division (PDCRD). 

 

2. Statement of Compliance and Basis of Financial Statements Presentation 
 

2.1. The Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with and comply with the 
Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standards (PPSAS) issued by the 

Commission on Audit per COA Resolution No. 2014-003 dated January 24, 

2014. 

 

 



10 

 

2.2. The financial statements have been prepared on the basis of historical cost, 
unless stated otherwise. The Statement of Cash Flows is prepared using the 

direct method. 

 

3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
 

3.1. Basis of Accounting 
 

The financial statements are prepared on an accrual basis in accordance with 

the PPSAS. 

 

3.2. Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand or cash in bank.  For the 

purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of 

cash and short-term deposits. 

 

3.3. Inventories 
 

Inventory is measured at cost upon initial recognition. To the extent that 

inventory was received through non-exchange transactions (for no cost or for a 

nominal cost), the cost of the inventory is its fair value at the date of 

acquisition. 

 

Inventories are recognized as an expense when deployed for utilization or 

consumption in the ordinary course of operations of the agency. 

 

3.4. Property, Plant and Equipment  
 

Recognition 

 

An item is recognized as PPE if it meets the characteristics and recognition 

criteria as PPE. 

 

Measurement at Recognition 

 

An item recognized as PPE is measured at cost. 

 

A PPE acquired through non–exchange transactions is measured at its fair 

value at the date of acquisition. 

 

Measurement after Recognition 

 

After recognition, all PPE are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and 

impairment losses. 

 

 

 



11 

 

 

When significant parts of PPE are required to be replaced at intervals, the 

agency recognizes such parts as individual assets with specific useful lives and 

depreciates them accordingly. Likewise, when a major repair/replacement is 

done, its cost is recognized in the carrying amount of the PPE if the recognition 

criteria are satisfied. 

 

All other repairs and maintenance are recognized as expense. 

 

Depreciation  

 

Each part of an item of property, plant and equipment with a cost that is 

significant in relation to the total cost of the item is depreciated separately. 

 

The depreciation charge for each period is recognized as expense unless it is 

included in the cost of another asset. 

 

Initial Recognition of Depreciation  

 

Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use such as when it is in 

the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the 

manner intended by management. 

 

For simplicity or to avoid proportionate computation, the depreciation is for 

one month if the PPE is available for use on or before the 15th of the month. 

However, if the PPE is available for use after the 15th of the month, 

depreciation is for the succeeding month. 

 

Depreciation Method 

 

The straight line method of depreciation is adopted unless another method is 

more appropriate for the agency operation. 

 

Estimated useful life 

 

MHSD uses the schedule on the Estimated Useful Life of PPE by classification 

prepared by COA. 

 

The agency uses a residual value equivalent to at least five per cent of the cost 

of the PPE. 

 

Impairment 

 

An asset’s carrying amount is written down to its recoverable amount, or 

recoverable service amount, if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its 

estimated recoverable service amount 

 

 



12 

 

Derecognition 

 

MHSD derecognizes items of PPE and/or any significant part of an asset upon 

disposal or when no future economic benefits or service potential is expected 

from its accounting use. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset 

(calculated as the difference between disposal proceeds and the carrying 

amount of the asset) is included in the surplus or deficit when the asset is 

derecognized. 

3.5. Changes in accounting policies and estimate  
 

MHSD recognizes the effects of changes in accounting policy retrospectively. 

The effects of changes in accounting policy were applied prospectively if 

retrospective application is impractical. 

 

MHSD recognizes the effects of changes in accounting estimate prospectively 

by including in surplus or deficit. 

 

MHSD corrects material prior period errors retrospectively in the first set of 

financial statements authorized for issue after their discovery by: 

 

● Restating the comparative amounts for prior period(s) presented in 
which the error occurred; or 

 

● If the error occurred before the earliest prior period presented, 
restating the opening balances of assets, liabilities and net 

assets/equity for the earliest prior period presented. 

 

3.6. Budget information 
 

The annual budget is prepared on cash basis and is published in the 

government website. 

 

A separate Statement of Comparison of Budget and Actual Amounts (SCBAA) 

was prepared since the budget and the actual financial statements were 

prepared on comparable basis. The SCBAA was presented showing the 

original and final budget and actual amounts on comparable basis to the 

budget. 

 

4. Correction of Fundamental Errors 
 

Errors of prior years are corrected by using the Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) 

Account.  Errors affecting current year’s operations are charged to the current year’s 

account.

equipment, but does not expect a residual value of these assets, because these 

will be utilized for their entire economic lives and do not have a significant 

scrap value. During the current financial year, the Ministry reviewed the 

estimated useful lives and residual values of property, plant and equipment, 

where appropriate.  

 

Fully depreciated asset at an original cost of ₱78,000.00 is still in use while the

PART II - OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

 

FINANCIAL AUDIT 

Petty Cash disbursements with incomplete documentation 

 

1. Replenishment of PCF were not sufficiently supported with duly accomplished 
and approved PCVs, RPPCV, approved purchase request with certificate of 

Emergency Purchase, if necessary, IAR, WMR, Approved Trip Tickets, 

among others, as required by regulation, thus the validity and authority for 

disbursements made out of the PCF for various expenses of the Ministry could 

not be fully ascertained. 

1.1 Section 36(c), Chapter 6 of the GAM Volume I provide the following: 
 

Sec. 36. Documentary Requirements.  The documentary 

requirements for PCF as provided under COA Circular No. 2012-

001 dated June 14, 2012, amended by COA Circular No. 2013-

001 dated January 10, 2013, and under this Chapter, are as 

follows: 

 

a. x x x 
b. x x x 
c. Liquidation of PCF 

1. Report on Paid Petty Cash Vouchers (RPPCV) 
(Appendix 49); 

2. Approved purchase request with certificate of 
Emergency Purchase if necessary; 

3. Bill, receipts, sales invoices; 
4. Inspection and Acceptance Report (IAR) (Appendix 

62); 

5. Waste Materials Report (WMR) (Appendix 65) in case 
of replacement/repair; 

6. Approved Trip Ticket, for gasoline/fuel expenses; 
7. Canvass from at least three suppliers for purchases 

involving ₱1,000.00 and above, except for purchases 

made while on official travel; 

8. Summary/Abstract of Canvass; 
9. PCVs duly accomplished and signed; 
10. OR in case of refund; 
11. For reimbursement of toll receipts; and 

i. Toll Receipts 
ii. Trip Tickets 

12. Such other supporting document that may be required. 

  



22 

 

1.2 During the year, the Ministry has paid various expenses through PCF totaling 
₱85,813.90 as summarized below: 

 

Expenses Amount 

Fuel, Oil and Lubricants Expenses 22,384.00 

Other Maintenance and Operating Expenses 24,076.00 

Office Supplies Expenses 24,631.90 

Travelling Expenses 350.00 

Repairs and Maintenance - Motor Vehicle 11,167.00 

Telephone Expense - Mobile 3,000.00 

Postage and Courier Services Expenses 205.00 

Total ₱85,813.90 

1.3 Post audit of disbursement vouchers relative to the above expenses noted that 
the replenishments were not sufficiently supported with the required 

documents under Section 36(c), Chapter 6 of the GAM Volume I, thus, 

validity and authority for disbursements out of the fund for various expenses 

could not be fully determined, to wit: 

a. Payments for fuel, oil and lubricants expenses were not supported 
with approved trip tickets; 

b. Purchases involving ₱1,000.00 and above were not supported with 
canvass from at least (3) three suppliers and Summary/Abstract of 

Canvass; 

c. No WMR were attached to disbursements involving replacement or 
repairs; 

d. No IAR in all cases of purchases of supplies/replacements/repairs;  

e. No Approved purchase request with certificate of Emergency as 
justification were attached to purchases of flash drives; 

f. Telephone Expense-Mobile were paid without approval; and 

g. Duly accomplished and signed PCVs were not attached to three (3) 
of the nine (9) replenishments (Check Nos. 2589564, 2589621, and 

2589670).   

1.4 For the replenishment checks with PCVs, some portions of the PCVs were 
left unfilled up or unchecked and appropriate boxes were not duly 

accomplished and signed mostly by the payees. 

1.5 It was also observed that the Summary Reports prepared by the Petty Cash 
Custodian were not compliant with the format prescribed under RPPCV 

(Appendix 49). 

 



23 

 

1.6 We recommended and Management agreed to require the AFD to: 
 

a. instruct the Petty Cash Custodian to submit the required supporting 
documents for payments made out of the PCF; and 

 

b. henceforth, strictly ensure that all disbursements made out of the 
PCF are supported with complete documentation pursuant to 

pertinent regulation. 

 

Unliquidated Advances to Officers and Employees 

 

2. The balance of the Advances to Officers and Employees account amounting to 
₱502,920.00 as of December 31, 2020 remains unliquidated/unsettled due to 

unsubmitted liquidation documents contrary to Section 89 of P.D. 1445 or the 

State Audit Code of the Philippines. 

2.1 Section 89 of P.D. 1445 provides that: 

Section 89. Limitations on cash advance. No cash advance shall be given 

unless for a legally authorized specific purpose. A Cash advance shall be 

reported on and liquidated as soon as the purpose for which it was given has 

been served. No additional cash advance shall be allowed to any official or 

employee unless the previous cash advance given to him is first settled or a 

proper accounting thereof is made. 

2.2 The advances granted to former officers and employees of the HLURB, 
which is now under the MHSD, remain unliquidated/unsettled to date as 

liquidation documents relative to said advances were yet to be submitted by 

the former assigned staff to MHSD. 

2.3 We recommended that Management faithfully to the rules and 
regulations on the grant, utilization and liquidation of cash advances, 

ensure proper monitoring pursuant to Section 89, PD 1445, and require 

all AOs to settle/liquidate immediately their CAs within the prescribed 

period, once the purpose for said advances are already served, 

otherwise, send demand letters to liquidate the same and refund all 

remaining unutilized balances, or cause the withholding of salaries of 

personnel with outstanding accounts, if warranted; and refrain from 

granting new or additional advances to AOs with unliquidated CAs.   

2.4 Management commented that they plan to request for coordination meeting 
with the separated accountable officers of the HLURB, an agency of the now 

defunct ARMM which was absorbed by the Ministry, to settle this account. 

Management also agreed that the same account will be adjusted by the 

Accounting Section when the necessary documents will be presented for 

liquidation. 

 

 

 



24 

 

Details of Accounts Receivables not sufficiently disclosed 

 

3. Regular monitoring and analysis to establish completeness, existence, 
accuracy and correctness pursuant to COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated 

December 19, 2016 in relation to Section 111 of PD 1445 of the Ministry’s 

Accounts Receivables amounting to ₱38.4 million as at December 31, 2020 

could not be undertaken, as no copies of the SLCs of the individual clients of 

the Ministry’s housing project were furnished to COA. Moreover, the 

required disclosures in the Notes to Financial Statements under GAM Volume 

I were not sufficiently complied with. 

3.1 Section 111 of PD 1445 requires that: 

Keeping of accounts. 

a) The accounts of an agency shall be kept in such detail as is necessary 
to meet the needs of the agency and at the same time be adequate to 

furnish the information needed by fiscal or control agencies of the 

government. 

b) x x x 

3.2 Records showed that SLCs of all individual clients were not kept and 
maintained. Thus, regular monitoring and analysis by the agency pursuant to 

Section 6.1 of COA Circular No. 2016-005 in relation the above provision 

of PD 1445 to establish the completeness, existence, accuracy and 

correctness of the balance of the account could not be validated. 

3.3 Moreover, the required information/presentation in the Notes to Financial 
Statements under GAM Volume I relative to receivables were not 

sufficiently disclosed. In particular, the current and non-current portions of 

the collectibles were not presented and there was no ageing or analysis of the 

account made in the Notes. Further, no breakdown was made to indicate 

composition of the receivable as to Installment Receivables or Mortgage 

Receivables in view of the modes by which the agency allows clients to 

acquire/purchase the housing units. 

3.4 We recommended and Management agreed to require: 

a. the AFD to submit an individual SLCs from the Accounting; and 

b. the Accounting to henceforth make the necessary disclosures in the 
Notes to Financial Statements in such detail as is necessary to meet 

the needs of the agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish 

the information needed by fiscal or control agencies of the 

government. 

3.5 Review of the copies of SLs submitted by the Ministry however noted that 
important details such as particulars and reference for the transactions reflected 

in the same were not supplied. 

 



25 

 

 

No physical count for the Inventory Held for Sale account 

 

4. The completeness, existence, accuracy and correctness of the balances of 
Inventory Held for Sale accounts of the Ministry totaling ₱40.01 million as of 

December 31, 2020 could not be readily ascertained due to non-conduct of 

physical count and non-submission of the RPCI for these assets as required 

under Section 13, Chapter 8 of the GAM Volume I. 

4.1 Section 13, Chapter 8 of the GAM, Volume I state that: 

x x x Physical count/inventory, which is required semi-annually, is an 

indispensable procedure for checking the integrity of property 

custodianship. 

4.2 As of December 31, 2020, the Ministry reported a balance of the Inventory 
Held for Sale account of ₱40,012,799.15. This pertains to the completed 

housing units for sale under Phase III of the Ministry’s Housing Project. 

However, the correctness, existence, accuracy and correctness of the 

reported inventory accounts could not be readily verified as there was no 

conduct of actual physical count of the housing units with the presence of 

the audit team. Consequently, the non-conduct of the physical count of the 

inventory led to non-submission by Management of the required RPCI. 

4.3 Hence, this casts doubt as to the reliability of the reported balance of the 
Inventory Held for Sale account as of December 31, 2020. 

4.4 We recommended and Management agreed to require the Inventory 
Committee to henceforth regularly comply with the timely conduct of 

physical count and submission of the required report.   

Purchases of Office Supplies directly charged to expenses 

 

5. SLCs and SCs were not kept and maintained for supplies by the Accounting 
and Supply Unit, respectively. Moreover, the recording of the related supplies 

expense was not supported with the RSMI as required by Section 17(g), 

Chapter 8 of the GAM Volume I. 

5.1 Sections 9, Chapter 8 of the GAM Volume I provide the following relative 
to the proper accounting for supplies inventories: 

Sec. 9. Perpetual Inventory Method. Supplies and materials purchased for 

inventory purpose shall be recorded using the perpetual inventory system, 

resulting in a more accurate inventory records and a running total for the 

cost of goods sold in each period. The system requires accounting records 

to show the amount of inventory on hand at all times through the 

maintenance of the SLC (Appendix 57) by the Accounting Division/Unit 

and Stock Card (SC) (Appendix 58) by the Supply and/or Property 

Division/Unit for each item in stock. Regular purchases shall be coursed 

through the inventory account and issues thereof shall be recorded as they 



26 

 

take place except for supplies and materials purchased out of PCF for 

immediate use or on emergency cases which shall be charged directly to the 

appropriate expense accounts. (Emphasis supplied) 

5.2 The Accounting Division/Unit and the Property and/or Supply Division/Unit 
were unable to keep and maintain SLCs and SCs, respectively, thus 

prevented the reconciliation of records of the Accounting and Supply and the 

preparation of adjusting entries where appropriate. 

5.3 In addition, Section 17(g) of the same chapter of the GAM Volume I require 
the Property and/or Supply Custodian to prepare and submit the monthly 

RSMI (Appendix 64) to be used by the Accounting Division/Unit as basis in 

preparing the JEV to record the supplies and materials issued. However, it 

was noted in the disbursement vouchers that the accounting entry for the 

direct charging of purchases to expense were not supported with the RSMI 

corresponding to the cost of supplies and materials issued. 

5.4 We recommended that Management require: 
 

a. the Accounting Division/Unit to keep and maintain SLCs and the 
Property and/or Supply Division/Unit to keep and maintain SCs for 

each item in stock and to facilitate regular reconciliation of records; 

and 

 

b. the Property and/or Supply Division/Unit to prepare and submit 
monthly RSMI to be used by the Accounting Division/Unit as basis 

in preparing the JEV to record the supplies and materials issued. 

5.5 Management agreed to observe compliance with the above stated regulations 
for the succeeding years. 

 

Unreliable Other Assets accounts 
 

6. The accuracy and correctness of the balances amounting to ₱1.2 million of the 
Other Assets account of the Ministry as of December 31, 2020 could not be 

ascertained due to absence of details/list and subsidiary records supporting 

such balances, which is essential in view of the provisions of Section 114 in 

relation to Section 111 of the State Audit Code of the Philippines or P.D. 1445. 

6.1 Section 111 of P.D. 1445 provides that: 

(1) The accounts of an agency shall be kept in such detail as is necessary 
to meet the needs of the agency and at the same time be adequate to 

furnish the information needed by fiscal or control agencies of the 

government. 

(2) The highest standards of honesty, objectivity and consistency shall 
be observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against 

inaccuracies or misleading information. 



27 

 

6.2 This is further reinforced in Section 114 of the same decree which states that: 

(1) The government accounting system shall be on a double entry basis 
with a general ledger in which all financial transactions are recorded. 

(2) Subsidiary records shall be kept where necessary. (emphasis 
supplied) 

6.3 Verification noted that the accuracy and correctness of balances of the Other 
Assets accounts amounting to ₱1,248,333.00 could not be fully verified as 

there are no details/list and subsidiary records that could be readily provided 

by the Accounting pertaining to such accounts.  

6.4 Hence, the absence of subsidiary records which could aid in providing for 
details of the account affects the presentation and ultimately the reliability of 

the Financial Statements of the Ministry. 

6.5 We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accounting 
to keep and maintain details/list and subsidiary records of all accounts 

where necessary in compliance with the applicable law. 

Non-preparation and maintenance of PARs, PCs and PPELCs 

 

7. PARs, PCs and PPELCs were not kept and maintained on file for the 
Ministry’s Property, PPEs as required under the regulation, thus the 

reliability of the PPE accounts with carrying amount ₱5.89 million as of 

December 31, 2020 could not be fully ascertained and the discrepancies 

between the records of the Accounting and that of the Property Unit could not 

be reconciled. 

7.1 Sound internal control requires prompt and correct recording and reporting 
of transactions to ensure that financial information are reliable, accurate and 

reported within the given accounting period. Likewise, to strengthen internal 

control, the maintenance of SLs is a requirement to check the accuracy of 

the controlling asset account in the GL. 

7.2 Section 42, Chapter 10 of GAM Volume I provides for the Accounting and 
Property records to be maintained for PPE, to wit: 

The Chief Accountant shall maintain the PPELC for each category of PPE 

including work and other animals, livestock, etc. The PPELC shall be kept 

to record promptly the acquisition, description, custody, estimated useful 

life, depreciation, impairment loss, disposal and other information about the 

asset. For check and balance, the Property and Supply Office/Unit shall 

likewise maintain PC for PPE in their custody to account for the receipt and 

disposition of the same. The balance per PC shall be reconciled with PPELC 

maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit. They shall also be reconciled 

with other property records like PAR. x x x 



28 

 

7.3 During an actual physical count of the Ministry’s PPEs, it was noted that the 
properties were not supported with PARs, PCs and PPELCs which runs 

counter to the aforementioned provision of the GAM. As a result, 

discrepancies could not be reconciled between the Accounting records and 

the list submitted by the Property Unit.  

7.4 We were informed that the discrepancies were caused by the unsubmitted 
list of properties from the HLURB which were already recorded by the 

Accounting. However, this list is not yet submitted to the Office of the 

Auditor to date, thus, a full physical count of the property of the Ministry 

could not be undertaken. 

7.5 The absence of these required documents/records such as PARs, PCs, and 
PPELCs would prevent the ascertainment of proper accountability over the 

PPEs and may result in the difficulty in establishing the accuracy, and 

correctness of the recorded amounts in the Financial Statements in the 

absence of other corroborating documents. 

7.6 We recommended that Management require the Accounting Office/Unit 
to keep and maintain PPELCs and the Property and Supply Office/Unit 

to keep and maintain PARs and PCs for all items of the PPE to aid in 

the regular reconciliation of Accounting and Property records. 

7.7 Management agreed to implement the recommendation moving forward 
starting year 2021. 

Properties not labelled with Property Identification and Coding 

 

8. Properties of the Ministry were not labelled with Property Identification and 
Coding and PARs were not issued to officer or employee who receives and is 

in actual possession or physical control of the property as required under 

Items V.2-3 of COA Circular No. 80-124. 

8.1 Item V.2 of COA Circular No. 80-124 states that: 

Government property shall be properly labelled and identified by the 

Inventory Committee.  Inventory labels of special materials shall contain 

among others the individual property number to be provided by the 

corporation concerned.  These numbers shall be uniformly printed in India 

Ink, to achieve permanence and best results, and shall be posted on a 

prominent but secure portion of the property for easy identification. 

8.2 Item V.3 of the same Circular, on the other hand, provides that: 

An officer or employee who receives and is in actual possession or physical 

control of the property shall sign a Memorandum Receipts (Gen.  Form No. 

32) for such property and shall be accountable therefor.  Such Memorandum 

Receipts for property in the custody of an officer or employee shall be 

renewed every three years. 



29 

 

8.3 Physical verification of the properties owned by the Ministry noted that 
proper labelling of Property Identification and Coding were not made on the 

property for easy identification. Fittingly, the Commission issued COA 

Circular No. 2020-006 dated January 30, 2020 which requires that, 

5.6 Each government agency shall adopt a uniform property identification 

system for PPE wherein a unique Property Number shall be assigned for 

each PPE item, using the following numbering system: 

 

8.4 In addition, PARs were also not issued to officer or employee who receives 
and is in actual possession or physical control of the property. Hence, it poses 

a risk that responsibility and accountability over these assets could not be 

easily identified at the outset due to absence of the required PARs. 

8.5 We recommended and Management agreed to require the AFD to: 

a. instruct the Property & Supply Officer to comply with Item V.2 of 
COA Circular No. 80-124 on Property Identification and Coding of 

all the Ministry’s fixed assets; and  

b. instruct the Property & Supply Officer to issue PARs and renew 
the same every three (3) years or every time there is change in 

actual possession or physical control of the asset, to establish 

responsibility and accountability over the same. 

 

Misstatements in Depreciation Expense, Accum. Depreciation and Book Value of PPE  

 

9. Depreciation Expense accounts for various items of PPEs were not recognized 
during the year, resulting in the misstatement of the Depreciation Expenses, 

Accumulated Depreciation, and the book value of the related assets. 

9.1 Section 51, Chapter 19 of the GAM Volume I provides that: 
 

Sec. 51. Other adjustments.  The following adjustments shall also 

be made (if applicable) for fair presentation of the result of 

operation of the entity in the financial statements: 

 

a. Unused NCA (National) 
b. Petty Cash Fund 



30 

 

c. Unreleased Commercial Checks 
d. Allowance for/Accumulated Impairment Losses of asset 

accounts 

e. Write-down of inventories 
f. Correction/Reclassification entries 
g. Adjustment for reversal of Impairment Losses 
h. Depreciation Expense 
i. Exchange differences from foreign currency 
j. Other adjustments (emphasis supplied) 

9.2 During the year, the Ministry has recorded depreciation expenses for various 
items of PPEs totaling ₱428,314.51. However, additional depreciation with 

an estimated amount of ₱232,114.50 were not recognized as an adjustment 

at the end of the year for various assets costing more or less ₱4.8 million as 

summarized below, thus resulting in the understatement of the Depreciation 

Expenses and Accumulated Depreciation accounts and consequently, 

overstatement of the book value of the related assets: 

Items Cost 

Book Value 

As of Jan. 1, 

2020 

% of Book 

Value over 

Cost 

Office Equipment 951,900.57 146,994.87 15%

Motor Vehicle 3,504,818.43 1,957,835.04 56% 

Total ₱4,892,108.31 ₱2,189,643.87  

9.3 As may be gleaned from the 4th column of the preceding table, most of the 
assets with unrecognized Depreciation Expenses have not yet reached their 

agency-estimated salvage value of 5% as of January 1, 2020. 

9.4 Except for motor vehicle with an estimated useful life of 10 years, most of 
the other assets have estimated useful life of five (5) years and salvage value 

of 5% of the cost of asset. Assuming that the same estimated useful life of 5 

years and salvage value of 5% will be used, the depreciation expenses 

unrecognized during the year could have reached to an estimated amount of 

₱232,114.50. 

9.5 A reading of the accompanying Notes to Financial Statements would reveal 
that one of the reasons for not being able to provide for depreciation to the 

above assets were due to absence of detailed list of these assets or records 

such as PPELCs. We were also informed that most of these assets were 

brought forward from the previous ARMM offices whose functions were 

subsequently absorbed by the Ministry. 



31 

 

9.6 We recommended that Management require: 

a. the AFD to coordinate with previous accountable officers of the 
RHRDA or HLURB, where appropriate, to retrieve records 

necessary to establish the accuracy and correctness of the 

recorded assets; and 

b. the Accounting Division/Unit consequently to recognize 
depreciation expense relative to these assets, where applicable. 

9.7 Management commented that they will request for a coordination meeting 
with the separated officers of the pervious office to settle this account to 

establish the accuracy and correctness of the recorded assets. 

 

Non-submission of copies of POs/Contracts and supporting documents forming integral 

part of it within five (5) days after their perfection 

 

10. Copies of more or less 56 perfected contracts, POs/WOs and their supporting 
documents entered into by the Ministry with third parties totaling to more or 

less ₱27.5 million were not furnished to COA within five (5) working days as 

required by regulation; thus, deficiency, if any, was not timely identified, and 

results of verification were not promptly communicated to Management. 

10.1 COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009 requires the 
submission of a copy of government contracts, purchase orders and the like, 

entered into by any government agency, irrespective of the amount involved, 

to COA. 

10.2 Section 3.1.1 of said Circular states that: 

Within five (5) working days from the execution of a contract by the 

government or any of its subdivisions, agencies or instrumentalities, 

including government-owned and controlled corporations, and their 

subsidiaries, a copy of said contract and each of all documents forming part 

thereof by reference or incorporation shall be furnished to the Auditor of the 

agency. 

10.3 Likewise, Section 3.2.1 of said Circular provides the following: 

A copy of any purchase order irrespective of amount, and each and every 

supporting document, shall, within five (5) working days from issuance 

thereof, be submitted to the Auditor concerned. Within the same period, the 

Auditor shall review and point out to management defects and/or 

deficiencies, if any, in the same manner provided in the second and third 

sentences of items 3.1.4 hereof. 

10.4 Records showed that copies of contracts and purchase orders together with 
supporting documents for various transactions entered into between the 

Ministry and third parties were not submitted to COA for legal and auditorial 

review within the prescribed period under existing regulation. 



32 

 

10.5 It was observed that Management only submitted POs/Contracts as 
attachments to the Disbursement Vouchers (DVs) which the same were only 

forwarded several days after the end of the month to COA. However, no 

copies of such POs/Contracts and their supporting documents were furnished 

in advance within five (5) working days after the perfection of the 

contract/purchase orders pursuant to the above-mentioned COA Circular. 

10.6 Thus, the non-observance of the timely submission of the copies of purchase 
orders and contracts with supporting documents forming integral part thereof 

as prescribed under said COA Circular prevented the timely legal and 

auditorial review of purchase orders and contracts entered into by the 

Ministry with third parties during the year totaling to more or less ₱27.5 

million for various transactions as broken down below: 

Particulars Qty. Amount 

Purchase Orders (POs) 14 3,900,531.65 

Contracts 42 23,621,334.69 

Total 56 ₱27,521,866.34 

10.7 We recommended that Management require the Chief of the AFD to 
submit copies of all contracts/POs/WOs and its supporting documents 

to COA within the prescribed period, for timely review of the legal and 

auditorial aspects of said transactions. 

10.8 Management commented that for the succeeding years, the Chief of the AFD 
will ensure that copies of contracts/POs/WOs and other documents of the 

Ministry will be submitted to COA within five days from the perfection of 

said contracts/POs/WOs. 

Inadequate internal control in handling payments for repairs and maintenance 

 

11. Repairs and maintenance transactions of the Ministry were paid despite 
deficiencies in the documents to support the necessity and propriety of the 

claims, contrary to the provisions of Section 9.1.3.4 of COA Circular No. 2012-

001.  

11.1 Section 9.1.3.4 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 requires 
that: 

 

Addition Documentary Requirements 

 

▪ Additional documents under Annexes Q and R of COA 
Memorandum No. 2005-027 dated February 28, 2005 

required to be submitted to the Auditor’s Office within five 

days from the execution of the contract: 

o Copy of the pre-repair evaluation report and 
approved detailed plans by the agency showing in 

sufficient detail the scope of work/extent of repair 

to be done 



33 

 

o Copy of the latest service bulletin, in case of 
aircraft 

o Report of waste materials 
o Copy of document indicating the history of repair 

▪ Post-inspection reports 
▪ Warranty Certificate 
▪ Request for payment 
▪ Bill/invoices 
▪ Certificate of Acceptance 
▪ Pre-repair inspection reports 
▪ Such other document peculiar to the contract and/or to the 

mode of procurement and considered necessary in the 

auditorial review and in the technical evaluation thereof 

11.2 During the year, the Ministry has spent a total of ₱150,932.00 for repairs and 
maintenance of various assets as broken down below: 

Particulars Amount 

Repairs and Maintenance – Buildings and Other 

Structures 

73,871.00 

Repairs and Maintenance – Machinery and Equipment 17,000.00 

Repairs and Maintenance – Transportation Equipment 60,061.00 

Total ₱150,932.00 

11.3 Post audit of DVs disclosed that the necessity for and propriety of the above 
expenses could not be fully ascertained due to the incomplete supporting 

documents attached to the pertinent vouchers. Particularly, the following 

were lacking documents necessary pursuant to Section 9.1.3.4 of COA 

Circular No. 2012-001, namely: Pre-repair inspection reports, Certificate of 

Acceptance, Post-inspection reports, copy of document indicating history of 

repair and Report of Waste Materials.  

11.4 Hence, the payments for repairs and maintenance which were allowed even 
with incomplete documentations may be considered indicative of inadequate 

internal control system in handling repairs and maintenance. 

11.5 We recommended and Management agreed to henceforth require the 
AFD to maintain an adequate and effective internal control that 

requires the submission of documentary requirements in conformity 

with laws, rules and regulations and a thorough review of all the 

supporting documents to establish the validity and propriety of the 

amount claimed. 

 

Non-submission of JEVs for cash receipts and/or non-cash transactions 

 

12. JEVs for cash receipts and/or non-cash transactions totaling ₱80.18 million 
for calendar year 2020, were not prepared and submitted to COA as required 

under the pertinent provisions of GAM, resulting in the delay in audit of the 

agency’s transactions specifically pertaining to cash receipts and non-cash 

transactions such as year-end adjusting entries. 



34 

 

12.1 Item A, Appendix 36 of the GAM Volume III provides that, 

This form shall be used to record all transactions of the NGAs, whether cash 

receipts, cash disbursements or non-cash transactions. Accounting journal 

entries shall be reflected therein and it shall serve as the basis for recording 

in the books of accounts. 

12.2 Record shows that for the calendar year 2020, JEVs, for cash receipt and/or 
non-cash transactions such as year-end adjusting entries in particular, were 

inadvertently not prepared and submitted by the Accounting to COA. We 

were informed that the Accounting was not aware that those JEVs are 

supposed to be prepared and submitted similar to those JEVs pertaining to 

the disbursements. We were also informed that it has been the practice that 

accounting entries for cash receipts and non-cash transactions were directly 

posted to the General Ledger (GL) or to the personal working paper of the 

accountant without the necessary JEVs. 

12.3 A reading of the agency’s Financial Statements as of December 31, 2020 
would show that MHSD has a total of ₱79.34 million cash receipts and a 

total of ₱0.64 million non-cash transactions, as shown in the following:

12.4 However, the foregoing figures could not be ascertained as to completeness, 
existence, accuracy and correctness as the subject JEVs and supporting 

documents were not submitted to COA. 

12.5 The JEVs are important accounting document where all accounting entries 
shall be reflected and it also serves as the basis for recording in the books of 

accounts. The JEVs should also be prepared and submitted together with the 

supporting documents after recording in the journals for post audit. In 

addition, the JEVs should be prepared in two (2) copies – the original to be 

submitted to COA and the Copy 2 to be retained by the Accounting for file. 

12.6 We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accounting 
to submit the JEVs together with all supporting documents pertaining 

to the cash receipts and non-cash transactions amounting to ₱80.18 



35 

 

million and henceforth regularly prepare and submit all JEVs as basis 

for recording all transactions of the agency, whether cash receipts, cash 

disbursements or non-cash transactions. 

12.7 As of writing, the Ministry has already submitted the JEVs for the Notices 
of Fund Transfers. While JEVs for the remaining amount were submitted, 

they, however, do not have attachments or supporting documents. 

 

Unverified Collections and Deposits 

 

13. RCDs together with supporting documents such as duplicate copies of official 
receipts and bank-validated deposit slips as well as RAAF were not submitted 

by the concerned accountable officer of the agency for audit purposes in 

compliance with the provisions of law and COA regulations, thus, the 

completeness, existence, accuracy and correctness of the reported collections 

of the agency of ₱606,939.75 could not be fully ascertained. 

13.1 Section 39, Chapter 5 of GAM Volume I provides that, 
 

Sec. 39. Reporting of Collections and Deposits. Receipts and 

deposits shall be reported as follows: 

 

a. At the close of the business day, the Collecting Officers shall 
prepare the Report of Collections and Deposits (RCD) 

(Appendix 26) for submission to Accounting Office/Unit. The 

report lists all the ORs issued in numerical sequence 

including cancelled ones. 

b. The RCD shall be supported by documentary evidence such 
as duplicate copies of ORs and validated deposit slips. 

13.2 Likewise, Section 68(1) of PD 1445 provides that, 
 

Section 68. Issuance of official receipt. 

 

(1) No payment of any nature shall be received by a collecting 
officer without immediately issuing an official receipt in 

acknowledgement thereof. The receipt may be in the form of 

postage, internal revenue or documentary stamps and the 

like, official numbered receipts, subject to proper custody, 

accountability, and audit. (emphasis supplied) 

13.3 During the year, the agency has reported a total of ₱606,939.75 collections 
from actual revenue and other receipts in its Quarterly Report of Revenue 

and Other Receipts as of December 31, 2020 as broken down as follows: 

 

Sources of Revenue Amount 

Locational Clearance 88,195.83 

Development Permit 3,660.00 



36 

 

Sources of Revenue Amount 

Certificate of Registration/License to Sell 2,500.00 

Sale of Housing Units 512,583.92 

Total ₱606,939.75 

13.4 However, the completeness, existence, accuracy and correctness of the 
above reported collections and whether these were properly deposited could 

not be fully ascertained as the required RCDs together with the supporting 

documents such as duplicate copies of official receipts and validated deposit 

slips as basis for recording the same in the JEVs were not submitted to COA 

for audit purposes. 

13.5 Likewise, the RAAF (Appendix 67) relating to official receipts in custody of 
the concerned accountable officer were not regularly submitted on a monthly 

basis to COA. Hence, reconciliation between the accountability of the 

concerned accountable officer over official receipts and the records of the 

Accounting could not be properly undertaken. 

13.6 We recommended and Management agreed to require the AFD to 
strictly ensure that concerned accountable officer in charge/designated 

as collecting officer regularly prepare and submit the required RCDs 

together with supporting documents such as duplicate copies of official 

receipts and validated deposit slips. 

Compliance with Property Insurance Law 

 

14. Properties of the Ministry were exposed to risk of unnecessary losses in the 
event of damage to, or loss of, such assets and properties as the agency was not 

able to obtain adequate insurance coverage for the insurable assets and 

properties during the year pursuant to existing law and COA regulation. 

14.1 Section 5 of RA No. 656, as amended by PD 245 requires that: 

 

Section 5. Every government, except a municipal government below first 

class, is hereby required to insure its properties, with the Fund against any 

insurable risk herein provided and pay the premiums thereon, which, 

however, shall not exceed the premiums charged by private insurance 

companies: Provided, however, That the System reserves the right to 

disapprove the whole or a portion of the amount of insurance applied for: 

Provided, further, That such property or part thereof as may not be 

insurable or acceptable for insurance may be insured with any private 

insurance company. A municipal government below first class may upon 

application insure its properties in the Fund under such rules and 

regulations as the System may prescribe. 

14.2 In addition, Item 5.1.a-b of COA Circular No. 2018-002 dated May 31, 2018 
also provides that: 

 



37 

 

5.1 Heads of government agencies shall direct the pertinent 

officials under his/her supervision to: 

 

a. Secure directly from the GSIS GIF, all insurances or bonds 
covering properties, contracts, rights of action, and other 

insurable risks of their respective offices; 

b. Prepare the Property Inventory Form (PIF) listing of all the 
insurable properties and other assets, showing their latest 

appraised value/valuation, appraisal date, location, and other 

information (Annex A); 

c. x x x 

14.3 Inquiry with certain key employee of the Ministry noted that insurance 
coverage for insurable assets and properties of the agency were not obtained 

for the year 2020. This was further corroborated by absence of any 

disbursement vouchers made to pay for the insurance premiums during the 

year. Furthermore, updated inventory of all insurable assets and properties 

using the format prescribed in above stated COA Circular and/or the GSIS 

was also not prepared. 

14.4 We recommended and Management agreed to require the submission of 
an updated inventory of all insurable properties to the GIF using the 

form prescribed by the GSIS for determination and approval of 

appropriate insurance coverage; and obtain an adequate insurance 

coverage for the insurable assets and properties with the GIF in order 

to indemnify or compensate the Government from any damage to, or 

loss of, its properties due to fire, earthquake, storm, or other casualty.
