EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

 

A. Introduction 

 

 The National Maritime Polytechnic (NMP) is the only government maritime 

training and research center in the Philippines established on May 1, 1978 by virtue of 

Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1369. It became an attached agency to the Department of 

Labor and Employment (DOLE) in year 1987 with the signing of Executive Order (EO) 

No. 126. 

 

 The agency’s main office is situated at the NMP Training Complex, Cabalawan 

Tacloban City, while the Makati Office is located at the 2/F ECC Building, Sen. Gil Puyat 

Ave., Makati City. 

 

 The NMP’s mission is to develop and conduct maritime training, assessment and 

research to Filipino seafarers and the maritime allied workforce, which measure up to 

international standards and respond to the need of the maritime industry, delivered 

through modern technology and by competent personnel imbued with integrity and 

commitment.  

 

The audit covered the review of accounts and operations of the NMP for calendar 

year (CY) 2020.  The audit was conducted to: (a) ascertain the propriety of transactions 

as well as the extent of compliance on the applicable laws, rules and regulations; (b) 

ascertain the level of assurance that may be placed on the management’s assertions on 

the financial statements; and (c) determine the extent of implementation of prior years’ 

audit recommendations.

C. Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements 

 

The Auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the 

Financial Statements of NMP for CY 2020 due to exceptions, as stated in the Independent 

Auditor’s Report and discussed in detail in Part II of this Report, that the year-end 

balances of the Inventories and Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) were unreliable due 

to noted deficiencies/errors which affected the fair presentation of the financial 

statements.  

 

 

D. Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations 
 

 The following are the significant audit observations and recommendations which 

are discussed in detail in Part II of this Report: 

 

1. The existence and accuracy of the Inventory account balances reported at 
P3,819,752.16 as of December 31, 2020 is doubtful due to the following:  (a) 

discrepancy of P1,417,859.40 in balances between the Financial Statements and 

the Report on the Physical Count of Inventory (RPCI); and (b) difficulty in 

reconciliation/validation due to incorrect inventory Account title in the RPCI. 

 

We recommended that the Executive Director require: 

 

(a) the Accountant and the Supply Officer to reconcile their respective 
records to ascertain that all the inventories are duly accounted for; to 

make the necessary adjustments in both records to come up with 

correct account balances; and henceforth, to regularly conduct 

monthly or quarterly reconciliation of their records; 

 

(b) the OIC of NMP Makati Office to prepare RPCI, for consolidation 
with NMP Tacloban RPCI, with unit value of each inventory item to 

facilitate its reconciliation with the records of the Accountant and the 

Supply Officer; and 

 

(c) the Inventory Committee to completely fill out the RPCI and use the 
correct Inventory account title per GAM for NGAs, Volumes II and 

III, respectively. 

 

2. The existence and accuracy of the year-end balance of the Property, Plant and 
Equipment (PPE) account reported at P1,032,896,738.30 could not be ascertained 



 

iii 
 

due to: (a) non-inclusion of PPE accounts valued at P73,171,700.54 in the Report 

on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE); and (b) the 

existence of unreconciled PPE items in the books aggregating P14,078,923.53, 

thereby affecting the fair presentation of the financial statements. 

 

We recommended that the Executive Director require the: 

 

(a) Inventory Committee to regularly and completely conduct an 
inventory of all their assets, prepare the RPCPPE and submit to the 

Audit Team and the Accounting Section within the deadline set in the 

GAM for NGAs, Volume I; and 

 

(b) Accountant and the Head of Material Resource and Management 
Section (MRMS) to: 

 

1. retrieve any available data pertaining to the remaining 
unreconciled PPE items and make the necessary 

corrections/adjustments to reflect a more reliable PPE balance in 

the financial statements; and 

 

2. prepare PPELC and PC for each category of PPE found at station 
and accomplish/fill out the data required as prescribed in the 

pertinent provisions of the GAM for NGAs.  For PPEs that could 

not be located or accounted for, the Head of the MRMS shall 

prepare a report as to the circumstances surrounding the loss, and 

submit the same to the NMP Executive Director for appropriate 

action/disposition. 

 

3. Guaranty/Security Deposits Payable totaling P676,003.43, representing bid 
securities, retention money deducted from claims of the contractors, and 

performance securities, have remained outstanding in the books for over two 

years, contrary to Chapter 3 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume III, and pertinent 

provisions of the 2016 Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (RIRR) of 

Republic Act (RA) No. 9184, thereby casting doubt on the existence and validity 

of the recorded payable. 

 

We recommended that the Executive Director: 
 

a) require the officials concerned to: 
 

1. render an explanation/justification on why the retention money 
deducted from claims of contractors were not yet released despite 

the lapse of over two years; and 

 



 

iv 
 

2. either return or utilize the retention money that has remained 
outstanding for more than two years to cover uncorrected 

discovered defects of completed projects; 

 

b) instruct the Accountant, in coordination with the end users, to assess 
the validity of the claims and to release the bid/performance securities 

to the contractors concerned, in accordance with the pertinent 

provisions of the RIRR of RA No. 9184. 

 

4. Projects totaling P19,583,823.93 were procured during the year with noted 
deficiencies, contrary to pertinent provisions of RA No. 9184 and its RIRR, and 

COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009. 

 

We recommended that: 

 

1) the Executive Director require the BAC Chairperson and or the BAC 
Secretariat Head to submit a written explanation for the deviations in 

their procurement activities; and 

 

2) henceforth, the NMP strictly observe the procurement processes as 
required by RA No. 9184 and its RIRR in line with the government’s 

commitment to promote good governance and effort to adhere to the 

principles of transparency, accountability, equity, efficiency and 

economy in procurement. 

 

5. NMP paid a total of P15,056,400.00 in honoraria to 23 Guest Lecturers for the 
period from CYs 2018 to 2020, of which 21.97% or P3,308,400.00 was paid to 

one Guest Lecturer in one training course only (IMO MC 6.09), and whose 

average annual honorarium of P1.10 million exceeds the annual salary of the 

highest paid permanent training specialist of NMP of P1.02 million, casting doubt 

on the reasonableness of the selection process, and the equitable assignment of 

loads of the Guest Lecturers.  Likewise, the failure of the NMP to hire permanent 

employees as training staff for the conduct of PDC training courses resulted in 

higher maintenance expenses, for the honorarium, meals and snacks, as well as 

for transportation by these GLs, contrary to Section 2 of PD No. 1445 and related 

laws, regulations and standards. 

 

We recommended that the management of NMP:  

 

1) create an independent body to re-evaluate the propriety and 
reasonableness of hiring of Guest Lecturers and distribution of 

training loads in NMP Makati; 

 

2) formulate a clear-cut policy in hiring of Guest Lecturers, and equitable 
distribution of loads to provide equal opportunities to qualified 

personnel, and competent subject matter experts, including the 



 

v 
 

ranking of Guest Lecturers and determining the comparable regular 

positions, in accordance with NMP OED MC No. 044-2002; 

 

3) consider filling up vacant positions under MTAD, and undertake 
further study on the feasibility of creating additional plantilla positions 

for NMP’s training needs as against hiring Guest Lecturers; and 

 

4) comply with the submission of a Daily Time Record showing the actual 
hours rendered by the guest lecturers, and the actual program and 

schedule of the conduct of the seminars and courses for monitoring and 

post audit of the payment of services rendered. 

 

 

E. Compliance with Tax Laws 
 

Of the taxes withheld by the NMP from its employees’ compensation and 

percentage taxes and value-added taxes from various transactions totaling  P6,697,866.65 

for CY 2020, the amount of P6,534,492.68 was remitted to the Bureau of Internal 

Revenue, thereby leaving an unremitted balance of P1,120,528.36. The ending balance 

represents taxes withheld in December 2020 where the full amount was subsequently 

remitted on January 6, 2021 and January 19, 2021. The details are discussed in Part II of 

the Report.  

 

 

F. Compliance with GSIS Act of 1997 
 

NMP complied with the requirements on withholding and remittance of GSIS 

contributions and loan amortization for CY 2020 pursuant to RA No. 8291. During the 

year, a total of P5,859,426.64 was withheld and P5,816,158.97 was remitted on time.  As 

of December 31, 2020, the ending balance of the Due to GSIS account amounted to 

P50,446.51. The full amount was remitted on December 17, 2020.

 NMP complied with the requirements on withholding and remittance of HDMF 

contributions and loan amortization for CY 2020.  During the year, a total of P996,683.82 



 

vi 
 

was withheld from employees and was remitted on time. As of December 31, 2020, the

2. Statement of Compliance and Basis of Preparation of Financial 
Statements  
 

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 

and comply with the Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standards (PPSAS) 

issued by the Commission on Audit per COA Resolution No. 2014-003 dated 

January 24, 2014.

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of 

historical cost, unless stated otherwise.  The Statement of Cash Flows is 

prepared using the direct method.  

 

3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
 

3.1 Basis of accounting 
 

The consolidated financial statements are prepared on an accrual basis in 

accordance with the Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standards 

(PPSAS).  

 

 

 

 

PPSAS 1, 6 

 

  

3.2 Cash and cash equivalents 
 

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and cash in bank, deposits 

on call and highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three 

months or less, which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and 

are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value. For the purpose of the 

consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of 

cash and short-term deposits as defined above, net of outstanding bank 

overdrafts. 

 

 

 

PPSAS 2.8 

PPSAS 2.9 

PPSAS 2.56 

3.3 Inventories 
 

Inventory is measured at cost upon initial recognition. To the extent that 

inventory was received through non-exchange transactions (for no cost or for 

a nominal cost), the cost of the inventory is its fair value at the date of 

acquisition. 

 

Costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition 

are accounted for, as follows: 

 

 Raw materials: purchase cost using the weighted average cost method 
 

 Finished goods and work in progress: cost of direct materials and labor and 
a proportion of manufacturing overheads based on the normal operating 

capacity, but excluding borrowing costs 

 

After initial recognition, inventory is measured at the lower of cost and net 

realizable value. However, to the extent that a class of inventory is distributed 

or deployed at no charge or for a nominal charge, that class of inventory is 

measured at the lower of cost and current replacement cost. 

 

Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of 

operations, less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs 

necessary to make the sale, exchange, or distribution.

Inventories are recognized as an expense when deployed for utilization or 

consumption in the ordinary course of operations of the Agency. 

 

3.4 Property, Plant and Equipment 
 

Recognition 

 

An item is recognized as property, plant, and equipment (PPE) if it meets the 

characteristics and recognition criteria as a PPE. 

 

The characteristics of PPE are as follows: 

 

 tangible items; 
 

 are held for use in the production or supply of goods or services, for rental to 
others, or for administrative purposes; and 

 

 are expected to be used during more than one reporting period. 
 

An item of PPE is recognized as an asset if:   

 

 It is probable that future economic benefits or service potential associated 
with the item will flow to the entity; and 

 

 The cost or fair value of the item can be measured reliably. 
 

 

 

 

 

PPSAS 17.13 

 

 

PPSAS 17.14 

 

Measurement at Recognition 

 

An item recognized as property, plant, and equipment is measured at cost. 

 

A PPE acquired through non-exchange transaction is measured at its fair value 

as at the date of acquisition. 

 

The cost of the PPE is the cash price equivalent or, for PPE acquired through 

non-exchange transaction its cost is its fair value as at recognition date.  

 

Cost includes the following: 

 

 Its purchase price, including import duties and non-refundable purchase taxes, 
after deducting trade discounts and rebates; 

 

 expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items; and 
 

 Initial estimate of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and restoring 
the site on which it is located, the obligation for which an entity incurs either 

when the item is acquired, or as a consequence of having used the item during

a particular period for purposes other than to produce inventories during that 

period. 

        

Measurement After Recognition 

 

After recognition, all property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less 

accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.  

 

 

 

PPSAS 17.43 

PAG2 of 

PPSAS 17  

  

When significant parts of property, plant and equipment are required to be 

replaced at intervals, the [Name of the entity] recognizes such parts as 

individual assets with specific useful lives and depreciates them accordingly. 

Likewise, when a major repair/replacement is done, its cost is recognized in the 

carrying amount of the plant and equipment as a replacement if the recognition 

criteria are satisfied.  

 

All other repair and maintenance costs are recognized as expense in surplus or 

deficit as incurred.  

PPSAS 17.24 

PPSAS 17.25 

 

 

 

 

 

PPSAS 17.23 

  

Depreciation 

 

Each part of an item of property, plant, and equipment with a cost that is 

significant in relation to the total cost of the item is depreciated separately. 

 

The depreciation charge for each period is recognized as expense unless it is 

included in the cost of another asset. 

 

 

 

PPSAS 17.59 

 

 

PPSAS 17.64 

 

Initial Recognition of Depreciation 

 

Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use such as when it is in 

the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the 

manner intended by management.   

 

For simplicity and to avoid proportionate computation, the depreciation is for 

one month if the PPE is available for use on or before the 15th of the month.  

However, if the PPE is available for use after the 15th of the month, depreciation 

is for the succeeding month. 

 

 

 

PAG3 of 

PPSAS 17 

 

Depreciation Method 

 

The straight line method of depreciation is adopted.

3.6 Revenue from non-exchange transactions 
 

Recognition and Measurement of Assets from Non-Exchange 

Transactions 

 

An inflow of resources from a non-exchange transaction, other than 

services in-kind, that meets the definition of an asset were recognized as an 

asset if the following criteria were met: 

 

 

 

 

 

PPSAS 23.31 

 

 



 

18 
 

 

 It is probable that the future economic benefits or service potential 
associated with the asset will flow to the entity; and 

 

 The fair value of the asset can be measured reliably. 
 

An asset acquired through a non-exchange transaction is initially measured 

at its fair value as at the date of acquisition. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

PPSAS 23.42 

 

Recognition Revenue from Non-Exchange Transactions 

 

An inflow of resources from a non-exchange transaction recognized as an 

asset is recognized as revenue, except to the extent that a liability is also 

recognized in respect of the same inflow. 

 

 

PPSAS 23.44 

 

 

 

 

Measurement of Revenue from Non-Exchange Transactions 

 

Revenue from non-exchange transactions is measured at the amount of the 

increase in net assets recognized by the entity, unless a corresponding 

liability is recognized. 

 

 

 

PPSAS 

23.48-49 

Measurement of Liabilities on Initial Recognition from Non-Exchange 

Transactions 

 

The amount recognized as a liability in a non-exchange transaction is the 

best estimate of the amount required to settle the present obligation at the 

reporting date. 

 

 

 

 

PPSAS 23.57 

Taxes  

 

Taxes and the related fines and penalties were recognized when collected 

or when these were measurable and legally collectible. The related refunds, 

including those that were measurable and legally collectible, were deducted 

from the recognized tax revenue. 

 

 

 

PAG2 of 

PPSAS 23 

Fees and fines not related to taxes 

 

NMP recognizes revenues from fees and fines, except those related to taxes, 

when earned and the asset recognition criteria were met. Deferred income 

is recognized instead of revenue if there is a related condition attached that 

would give rise to a liability to repay the amount.  

 

Other non-exchange revenues were recognized when it is probable that the 

future economic benefits or service potential associated with the asset will 

flow to the entity and the fair value of the asset can be measured reliably. 

 

 

PPSAS 23.89 



 

19 
 

Gifts and Donations 

 

NMP recognizes assets and revenue from gifts and donations when it is 

probable that the future economic benefits or service potential will flow to 

the entity and the fair value of the assets can be measured reliably. 

 

Goods in-kind were recognized as assets when the goods were received, or 

there is a binding arrangement to receive the goods. If goods in-kind were 

received without conditions attached, revenue is recognized immediately. 

If conditions were attached, a liability is recognized, which is reduced and 

revenue recognized as the conditions were satisfied. 

 

On initial recognition, gifts and donations including goods in-kind were 

measured at their fair value as at the date of acquisition, which were 

ascertained by reference to an active market, or by appraisal. An appraisal 

of the value of an asset is normally undertaken by a member of the 

valuation profession who holds a recognized and relevant professional 

qualification. For many assets, the fair values were ascertained by 

reference to quoted prices in an active and liquid market.

PPSAS 23.96 

 

 

 

 

 

PPSAS 23.97 

Transfers 

 

NMP recognizes an asset in respect of transfers when the transferred 

resources meet the definition of an asset and satisfy the criteria for 

recognition as an asset, except those arising from services in-kind. 

 

 

 

PPSAS 23.96 

Services in-Kind 

 

Services in-kind were not recognized as asset and revenue considering the 

complexity of the determination of and recognition of asset and revenue 

and the eventual recognition of expenses. 

 

 

PPSAS 23.98 

PAG3 of 

PPSAS 23 

  

Transfers from other government entities 

 

Revenues from non-exchange transactions with other government entities 

and the related assets were measured at fair value and recognized on 

obtaining control of the asset (cash, goods, services and property) if the 

transfer is free from conditions and it is probable that the economic 

benefits or service potential related to the asset will flow to the Agency 

and can be measured reliably.

3.8 Employee benefits 
 

The employees of NMP are member of the Government Service Insurance 

System (GSIS), which provides life and retirement insurance coverage.  

 

NMP recognizes the undiscounted amount of short term employee benefits, 

like salaries, wages, bonuses, allowance, etc., as expense unless capitalized, 

and as a liability after deducting the amount paid. 

 

NMP recognizes expenses for accumulating compensated absences when 

these were paid (commuted or paid as terminal leave benefits). Unused 

entitlements that have accumulated at the reporting date were not 

recognized as expense. Non-accumulating compensated absences, like 

special leave privileges, were not recognized. 

 

 

3.9 Measurement uncertainty  
 

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with 

PPSAS, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that 

affect the reporting amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of 

contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of the consolidated financial 

statements and the reported amounts of the revenues and expenses during 

the period.  

 

Estimates were based on the best information available at the time of 

preparation of the consolidated financial statements and were reviewed 

annually to reflect new information as it becomes available. Measurement 

uncertainty exists in these consolidated financial statements. Actual results 

could differ from these estimates.

P3,819,752.16 as of December 31, 2020 is doubtful due to the following:  

(a)  discrepancy of P1,417,859.40 in balances between the Financial 

Statements and the Report on the Physical Count of Inventory (RPCI); and 

(b) difficulty in reconciliation/validation due to incorrect inventory Account 

title in the RPCI.

SECTION 111. Keeping of accounts. 
 

(1) The accounts of an agency shall be kept

(Data in column 3 were computed based on the quantity and the unit value of the inventory items in the consolidated 

RPCI submitted by NMP) 
 

The Audit Team observed that some inventory items in the RPCI were not 

provided with their unit values so that it could be surmised that part of the 

variances could be attributed to the deficiencies.  A further verification of the 

RPCI disclosed that those items which had no unit value were the inventories 



 

42 
 

from the NMP Makati Office, and this was confirmed by the Accountant when 

the Audit Team conducted an audit inquiry.  The balance of the inventories per 

RPCI totaling P3,654,630.48 would still increase when the unit price of those 

items found in stock are provided, thereby either increasing or decreasing the 

variance of P1,417,859.40. 

 

b) Semi-Expendable Items were generally used as an account title for Semi-
Expendable Machinery, Semi- Expendable Office Equipment, Semi-

Expendable Information and Communications Technology Equipment, Semi-

Expendable Disaster Response and Rescue Equipment, Semi-Expendable 

Other Machinery and Equipment and Semi-Expendable Furniture and 

Fixtures in the RPCI.  The use of these incorrect account titles has precluded 

the Audit Team from verifying and reconciling the balances in the RPCI vis-

à-vis the financial statements. 

 

1.6 The existence of variances in the balances between the accounting and supply 
records rendered the year-end Inventory account balances inaccurate, thereby 

affecting the fair presentation of the Financial Statements. 

 

1.7 We recommended that the Executive Director require: 
 

(a) the Accountant and the Supply Officer to reconcile their respective 
records to ascertain that all the inventories are duly accounted for; to 

make the necessary adjustments in both records to come up with 

correct account balances; and henceforth, to regularly conduct 

monthly or quarterly reconciliation of their records; 

 

(b) the OIC of the NMP Makati Office to prepare RPCI, for consolidation 
with NMP Tacloban RPCI, with unit value of each inventory item to 

facilitate its reconciliation with the records of the Accountant and the 

Supply Officer; and 

 

(c) the Inventory Committee to completely fill out the RPCI and use the 
correct Inventory account title per GAM for NGAs, Volumes II and 

III, respectively. 

 

1.8 In a written reply to the Audit Observation Memorandum (AOM), the Accountant 
commented that the discrepancy between the accounting records and the Material 

Resource Management Section (MRMS) record was due to the procurement of 

supplies and materials at NMP Makati wherein the Petty Cash Fund (PCF) was 

customarily used to procure the items.  At year end NMP Makati provides the 

inventories thereat to the NMP Tacloban for the inclusion in the NMPs RPCI.  

Items purchased through PCF were recorded outright at the accounting as expense 

thereby resulting in the discrepancy between the two records. Nevertheless, the 

officers concerned assured us that they will reconcile their respective records, and 

make necessary adjustments to come up with the correct account balances. 



 

43 
 

 

1.9 As regards the use of the account title Semi-Expendable Items, the Inventory 
Committee through the Material Resource Management Section (MRMS) 

commits to henceforth use the correct account title in the RPCI and completely 

fill out the form as prescribed in the GAM for NGAs Volume II. 

 

1.10 Under existing rules and regulations, using the PCF to procure supplies and 
materials, a regular expense in any government entity is among those transactions 

not allowed to be charged against the PCF.  The procurement of supplies and 

materials should always be made through public bidding as mandated in RA No. 

9184. 

 

Non-inclusion of PPE accounts in the RPCPPE, P73,171,700.54; unreconciled PPE 

items, P14,078,923.53 

 

2. The existence and accuracy of the year-end balance of the Property, Plant 
and Equipment (PPE) account reported at P1,032,896,738.30 could not be 

ascertained due to: (a) non-inclusion of PPE accounts valued at 

P73,171,700.54 in the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and 

Equipment (RPCPPE); and (b) the existence of unreconciled PPE items in 

the books aggregating P14,078,923.53, thereby affecting the fair presentation 

of the financial statements. 

 

2.1 Sections 111 and 122, PD No. 1445, provide: 
 

SECTION 111. Keeping of accounts. 
 

(1) The accounts of an agency shall be kept in such 

detail as is necessary to meet the needs of the 

agency and at the same time be adequate to 

furnish the information needed by fiscal or 

control agencies of the government. 

 

(2) The highest standards of honesty, objectivity 

and consistency shall be observed in the 

keeping of accounts to safeguard against 

inaccurate or misleading information. 

 

SECTION 122. Submission of Reports. - Whenever deemed 

necessary in the exigencies of the service, the Commission may 

under regulations issued by it require the agency heads, chief 

accountants, budget officers, cashiers, disbursing officers, 

administrative or personnel officers, and other responsible 

officials of the various agencies to submit trial balances, physical 

inventory reports, current plantilla of personnel, and such other 

reports as may be necessary for the exercise of its functions.

2.2 Likewise, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, pertinently provides: 
 

Sec. 38. Physical Count of PPE.  The entity shall have a 

periodic physical count of PPE, which shall be done annually and 

presented on the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant 

and Equipment (RPCPPE) (Appendix 73) as of December 31 of 

each year.  This shall be submitted to the Auditor concerned not 

later than January 31 of the following year.  Equipment found at 

station and losses discovered during the physical count shall be 

reported to the Accounting Division/Unit for proper 

accounting/recording. 

 

X x x 

 

Sec. 42. Accounting and Property Records to be 

maintained for PPE. The Chief Accountant shall maintain the 

PPELC for each category of PPE including work and other 

animals, livestock etc. The PPELC shall be kept to record 

promptly the acquisition, description, custody, estimated useful 

life, depreciation, impairment loss, disposal and other information 

about the asset. For check and balance, the Property and Supply 

Office/Unit shall likewise maintain PC for PPE in their custody to 

account for the receipt and disposition of the same. The balance 

per PC shall be reconciled with PPELC maintained by the 

Accounting Division/Unit. They shall also be reconciled with 

other property records like PAR. 
 

The following are the forms/reports necessary to account 

for PPE:

e. Property, Plant and Equipment Ledger Card 

(Appendix 70) – this card shall be used for each class 

of PPE to record the acquisition, description, custody, 

estimated life, depreciation, impairment, disposal, 

transfer/adjustment, repair history and other 

information about the property. It shall be kept and 

maintained by the Accounting Official/Unit.

as at a given date, including those which are 

unrecorded and those which could not be accounted 

for.  It shows the balance of PPE per property cards 

and per count and the shortage/overage, if any. It shall 

be rendered by the Inventory Committee, on its yearly 

physical count of properties owned by the entity. 

 

2.3 As of December 31, 2020, the total balance of the PPE in the financial statements 
amounted to P1,032,896,738.30, summarized as follows:

2.4 Audit of the accounts and verification of related records revealed the following 
deficiencies: 

 

a. Non-inclusion of PPE accounts in the RPCPPE valued at P73,171,700.54 

 

2.5 In CY 2020, NMP conducted a physical count of its properties as of December 
31, 2020 and submitted the required RPCPPE for several classes of PPE.  

However, the report did not include some PPE accounts totaling P73,171,700.54, 

the details of which are as follows:

2.6 According to the officer concerned, the lack of personnel and the heavy workload 
precluded them from submitting the inventory reports for the remaining PPE 

accounts.  

 

2.7 Moreover, the RPCPPE was submitted only to the Audit Team on March 1, 2021, 
contrary to Section 38 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I. 

 

b. Unreconciled PPE items amounting to P14,078,923.53 for two PPE categories 

 



 

46 
 

2.8 In CY 2019, there were unreconciled items that appeared in the subsidiary records 
totaling P37,412,804.13, and these were reported by the Audit Team.  Our 

verification of the subsidiary records for the PPE accounts reported in the 

financial statements as of year end showed a remaining unreconciled PPE items 

for the PPE category - Furniture and Fixtures and the Books aggregating 

P14,078,923.53, itemized as follows:

2.9 These unreconciled balances are labeled “For Reconciliation” in the Description 
column of the subsidiary record for each PPE account in the e-NGAS.  These 

balances could not be identified as to what specific PPE items they were 

composed of, and their accounts have remained dormant due to lack of documents 

on file pertaining to their receipt and disposition.  The details as to the type of 

article and other basic information are unknown since there were no Property 

Plant and Equipment Ledger Cards (PPELCs) or Property Cards (PCs) 

maintained for these assets. 

 

2.10 The Supply Officer and the Accountant have already identified and located 
several properties comprising these unreconciled PPE items, and the necessary 

corrections and adjustments have been made accordingly as evidenced by a 

commendable decrease of unreconciled PPE items from P37,412,804.13 in CY 

2019 to P14,078,923.53 in CY 2020.  However, the remaining unreconciled 

amount is still significant to affect the fair presentation of the recorded PPE 

accounts, Furniture and Fixtures and the Books, as of year end. 

 

2.11 Likewise, it is emphasized that the completeness of the RPCPPE should be made 
a priority because of the need to regularly and properly appraise the conditions of 

the properties; to account for any unrecorded items found on site; and to validate 

the existence of the reported PPE in the financial statements. 

 

2.12 We recommended that the Executive Director require the: 



 

47 
 

 

(a) Inventory Committee to regularly and completely conduct an 
inventory of all their assets, prepare the RPCPPE and submit to the 

Audit Team and the Accounting Section within the deadline set in the 

GAM for NGAs, Volume I; and 

 

(b) Accountant and the Head of Material Resource and Management 
Section (MRMS) to: 

 

1. retrieve any available data pertaining to the remaining 
unreconciled PPE items and make the necessary 

corrections/adjustments to reflect a more reliable PPE balance in 

the financial statements; and 

 

2. prepare PPELC and PC for each category of PPE found at station 
and accomplish/fill out the data required as prescribed in the 

pertinent provisions of the GAM for NGAs.  For PPEs that could 

not be located or accounted for, the Head of the MRMS shall 

prepare a report as to the circumstances surrounding the loss, and 

submit the same to the NMP Executive Director for appropriate 

action/disposition. 

 

2.13 In a written reply to the AOM, the Management, through its Property Officer and 
its duly constituted Inventory Committee, assured the Audit Team that they will 

regularly and completely conduct the inventory of all PPEs, prioritize the 

preparation and submission of complete RPCPPE to the Audit Team within the 

deadline set in the GAM for NGAs. 

 

2.14 As regards the unreconciled PPE items, the Accounting Unit and the Inventory 
Team are continuously working hand in hand to identify the subject PPE items 

by looking into available transaction records.  Efforts in search of these data were 

extensively undertaken since some of these items listed in the subsidiary records 

were purchased as early as year 1984, and their records could not be found 

anymore.  These unreconciled items include Furniture and Fixtures and Books, 

which were already fully depreciated, and were likely to have been destroyed 

during the onslaught of Typhoon Yolanda. 
 

2.15 Further, the officers concerned commented that they will look into COA Circular 
No. 2020-006 dated January 31, 2020 re: “Guidelines and Procedures in the 

Conduct of Physical Count of PPE, Recognition of PPE Items Found at Station, 

and Disposition for Non-existing/Missing PPE items, for the One-Time 

Cleansing of PPE Account Balances of Government Agencies,” as their guide in 

the proper disposition of their unreconciled PPE items.

Long outstanding Guaranty/Security Deposits Payable, P676,003.43 

 

3. Guaranty/Security Deposits Payable totaling P676,003.43, representing bid 
securities, retention money deducted from claims of the contractors, and 

performance securities, have remained outstanding in the books for over two 

years, contrary to Chapter 3 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume III, and 

pertinent provisions of the 2016 Revised Implementing Rules and 

Regulations (RIRR) of Republic Act (RA) No. 9184, thereby casting doubt 

on the existence and validity of the recorded payable. 

 

3.1 COA Circular No. 2020-01 dated January 8, 2020 prescribing Volume III-

c) Other terms of the contract. 
 

3.3 Likewise, Section 62.1 of the 2016 RIRR of RA No. 9184, as amended by 
Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB) Resolution No. 30-2017 dated 

May 30, 2017, provides: 

 

Section 62. Warranty 
 

62.1 For the procurement of Goods, in order to assure that 

manufacturing defects shall be corrected by the supplier, a 

warranty security shall be required from the contract 

awardee for a minimum period of three (3) months, in the 

case of Expendable Supplies, or a minimum period of one 

(1) year, in the case of Non-expendable Supplies, after 

acceptance by the Procuring Entity of the delivered 

supplies. 

 

The obligation for the warranty shall be covered by either 

retention money in an amount equivalent to at least one 

percent (1%) but not to exceed five percent (5%) of every 

progress payment, or a special bank guarantee equivalent 

to at least one percent (1%) but not to exceed five percent 

(5%) of the total contract price. The said amounts shall 

only be released after the lapse of the warranty period or, 

in the case of Expendable Supplies, after consumption

6.2. The total "retention money" shall be due for release 

upon final acceptance of the works. The contractor 

may, however, request the substitution of the 

retention money for each progress billing with 

irrevocable standby letters of credit of from a 

commercial bank, bank guarantees or surety bonds 

callable on demand, of amounts equivalent to the 

retention money substituted for and acceptable to 

Government, provided that the project is on 

schedule and is satisfactorily undertaken. 

Otherwise, the ten percent (10%) retention shall be 

made. Said irrevocable standby letters of credit, 

bank guarantees and/or surety bonds, to be posted 

in favor of the Government shall be valid for a 

duration to be determined by the concerned 

implementing office/agency or procuring entity 

and will answer for the purpose for which the ten 

percent (10%) retention is intended, i.e., to cover 

uncorrected discovered defects and third party 

liabilities.  

 

3.5 As of December 31, 2020, the Guaranty/Security Deposits Payable account 
showed a balance of P1,055,696.04 in the financial statements.  The balance is 

composed of retention money withheld from claims of various contractors in the 

procurement of goods and services, bid securities from bidders, and performance 

securities from the winning bidders. 

 

3.6 Verification of the schedule supporting the Guaranty/Security Deposits Payable 
account disclosed that payables for bid security, retention money and 

performance security totaling P676,003.43 have been outstanding for more than

GRAND TOTAL P676,003.43 

 

3.7 Of the grand total, bid securities amounting to P171,786.94 have been in the 
books for eight to ten years as of December 31, 2020.  These amounts have not 

yet been returned to the bidders.  Likewise, the retention monies totaling 

P421,791.49 have yet to be released to the contractors concerned after the lapse 

of the warranty period (for the procured goods and services) and final acceptance 

of the works (for the procured infrastructure projects).  Moreover, the 

performance securities amounting to P82,425.00 were unreleased 

notwithstanding the issuance of the Certificate of Final Acceptance and the 

absence of claims filed against the contractors. 

 

3.8 The related projects for these payables have already been reported as 100% 
complete, and their corresponding Certificates of Final Acceptance were already 

issued.  Usually, Guaranty Deposits Payables were immediately claimed by the 

contractors when the security deposits already served its purpose, but in this case 

they remained in the books for a long time even if they were already due for 

release. 

 



 

53 
 

3.9 We recommended that the Executive Director: 
 

a) require the officials concerned to: 
 

1. render an explanation/justification on why the retention money 
deducted from claims of contractors were not yet released despite 

the lapse of over two years; and 

 

2. either return or utilize the retention money that has remained 
outstanding for more than two years to cover uncorrected 

discovered defects of completed projects; 

 

b) instruct the Accountant, in coordination with the end users, to assess 
the validity of the claims and to release the bid/performance securities 

to the contractors concerned, in accordance with the pertinent 

provisions of the RIRR of RA No. 9184. 

 

3.10 In a written reply to the AOM, the Accountant commented that the subject 
payables were trust liabilities that should remain in the books until released.  

Forfeiture and derecognition thereof in the books would be improper because the 

bidder, contractor or supplier could request for its release any time.  She added 

that although these payables are already outstanding for more than two years, they 

will not be released without a letter request from the supplier, which is a required 

supporting document per COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 on the 

Revised Documentary Requirements for Common Government Transactions. 

 

3.11 The Accountant assured us that they will communicate with the suppliers 
concerned, and assess the validity of these recorded guaranty/security deposits 

payable.

g) No evidence that Performance Security was posted prior to the contract 
signing for the project Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for Basic 

Courses Unit Use, contrary to 39.1 of RA No. 9184 and its RIRR. 

 

4.9 Based on the deficiencies discussed, it showed that in some stages of the 
procurement activities, the NMP did not strictly adhere to the principles 

prescribed for government procurements as required under the RIRR of RA No. 

9184.  Timelines in every step in the procurement process were not fully 

observed, thereby transparency, public monitoring, efficiency and effectiveness 

of the procurement were not ascertained. 

 

4.10 We recommended that: 
 

3) the Executive Director require the BAC Chairperson and or the BAC 
Secretariat Head to submit a written explanation for the deviations in 

their procurement activities; and 

 

4) henceforth, the NMP strictly observe the procurement processes as 
required by RA No. 9184 and its RIRR in line with the government’s 

commitment to promote good governance and effort to adhere to the 

principles of transparency, accountability, equity, efficiency and 

economy in procurement. 

 

4.11 In a written reply, Management’s justifications relative to the above observations 
were as follows: 

 

a) The delay in the posting of the Notices to Proceed (NTP) and Approved 
Contracts in the PhilGEPS were due to the technical glitches in the PhilGEPS 

system during the period, unavailability of NTP and the difficulty by the 

bidder in securing notarized contract caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. 

 

b) Moreover, the BAC Secretariat justified that the advance copy of NOA and 
Contract Agreement were submitted to the Audit Team while other 

procurement documents with voluminous attachments were forwarded to the 



 

61 
 

Audit Team on a later date because the BAC Secretariat had first to collate all 

needed documents. 

 

c) The filling-out of the “Dates of Receipt” and “Dates of Approval” on the BAC 
Resolutions declaring LCRB and recommendation to the Head of the 

Procuring Entity (HoPE) the award of contract were inadvertently missed out 

although these resolutions were forwarded to the HoPE for approval and were 

signed within the prescribed period. 

 

d) Delay in the posting of NOA in the PhilGEPS were due to the following 
reasons: (1) implementation of work suspension from March 23, 2020 to 

April 30,2020; (2) pandemic related restrictions which affected the transport 

of the NOA from NMP to the winning bidder and back to NMP and; (3) 

technical glitches in the PhilGEPS system during this period. 

 

e) Likewise, the delay in the signing of the Contract Agreement was encountered 

due to the implementation of work suspension from March 23, 2020 to April 

30, 2020, and the pandemic-related restrictions which affected the transport 

of the document from NMP to the winning bidder and back to NMP. Also, 

due to the COVID-19 situation, the bidder found it  difficult in securing 

notarization of the contract. 

 

f) The filling-out of the Date of Contract for Personal Protective Equipment 
(PPE) project was inadvertently missed out. However, the Contract 

Agreement was forwarded by the BAC Secretariat to the Office of the 

Executive Director (OED) for signature on September 1, 2020. The signed 

contract was endorsed to the BAC Secretariat on September 2, 2020 and it 

was sent to the winning bidder on the same day for signature and notarization. 

It is also noteworthy that the date of the notarization as reflected in the 

contract was on September 7, 2020. The notarized contract was received by 

BAC on September 29, 2020. This observation is well taken and we will 

ensure that contracts should bear the date when it was executed. 

 

g) Further, in consideration of the limited access to financial institutions, 
regulatory and other offices, as well as implementation of government 

restrictions on transport and travel, the Government Procurement Policy 

Board (GPPB) issued Resolution No. 09-2020 dated May 7, 2020, allowing 

Procuring Entities (PEs) to accept alternate documentary requirements for 

procurement activities during a State of Calamity, or implementation of 

community quarantine or similar restrictions declared or being implemented 

either in the locality of the PE or of the Bidder, which includes among others 

the acceptance of Performance Securing Declaration in lieu of performance 

security to guarantee the winning bidder’s faithful performance of obligations 

under the contract. It can be recalled that President Rodrigo R. Duterte 

declared a State of Calamity throughout the Philippines on March 16, 2020 

for a period of six (6) months with the issuance of Presidential Proclamation 



 

62 
 

No. 929. It was further extended for a period of one (1) year effective 

September 13, 2020 to September 21, 2021 by virtue of Presidential 

Proclamation No. 1021. 

 

 

Average annual honorarium of one GL exceeds the annual salary of the highest paid 

permanent training specialist; failure to hire permanent training staff resulted in higher 

maintenance expenses for these GLs. 

 

5. NMP paid a total of P15,056,400.00 in honoraria to 23 Guest Lecturers for 
the period from CYs 2018 to 2020, of which 21.97% or P3,308,400.00 was 

paid to one Guest Lecturer in one training course only (IMO MC 6.09), and 

whose average annual honorarium of P1.10 million exceeds the annual salary 

of the highest paid permanent training specialist of NMP of P1.02 million, 

casting doubt on the reasonableness of the selection process, and  the 

equitable assignment of loads of the Guest Lecturers.  Likewise, the failure 

of the NMP to hire permanent employees as training staff for the conduct of 

PDC training courses resulted in higher maintenance expenses, for the 

honorarium, meals and snacks, as well as for transportation by these GLs, 

contrary to Section 2 of PD)No. 1445 and related laws, regulations and 

standards. 
 

5.1 Section 2 of PD No. 1445 provides: 
 

GENERAL PROVISIONS 

 

x x x 

 

Section 2. Declaration of Policy.  It is the declared policy of the 

State that all resources of the government shall be managed, 

expended or utilized in accordance with law and regulations, and 

safeguarded against loss or wastage through illegal or improper 

disposition, with a view to ensuring efficiency, economy and 

effectiveness in the operations of the government. The 

responsibility to take care that such policy is faithfully adhered to 

rests directly with the chief or head of the government agency 

concerned.  

 

5.2 Likewise, RA No. 6713 states that: 
 

Section 4. Norms of Conduct of Public Officials and Employees. 

- (A) Every public official and employee shall observe the 

following as standards of personal conduct in the discharge and 

execution of official duties: 

 



 

63 
 

(a) Commitment to public interest. – Public officials and 
employees shall always uphold the public interest over and 

above personal interest. All government resources and 

powers of their respective offices must be employed and 

used efficiently, effectively, honestly and economically, 

particularly to avoid wastage in public funds and revenues. 

 

(b) x x x 
 

(c) Justness and sincerity - Public officials and employees shall 
remain true to the people at all times. xxx.  They shall not 

dispose or extend undue favors on account of their office to 

their relatives whether by consanguinity or affinity except 

with respect to appointments of such relatives to positions 

considered strictly confidential or as members of their 

personal staff whose terms are coterminous with theirs. 

 

5.3 Also, NMP OED Memorandum Circular (MC) No.  044-2002 dated December 
27, 2002 sets the limit of the amount of honorarium that shall be paid to a Guest 

Lecturer, per category, which shall not exceed the monthly salary of a particular 

plantilla position of organic personnel of NMP. 

 

5.4 NMP is the only government maritime training and research center in the 
Philippines located in Tacloban City, and with an extension office in Makati City.  

One of NMP’s missions is to conduct training and assessment for Filipino 

seafarers.  It offers, among others, Specialized Courses, Basic Courses and 

Professional Development Courses (PDCs).  The PDCs, mostly handled by the 

Guest Lecturers, are the following:  

 

1. Assessment Examination and Certification of Seafarers (IMO MC 3.12) 
2. Training Course for Instructors (IMO MC 6.09) 
3. Training Course for Simulator Instructors and Assessor (IMO MC 6.10) 

 

5.5 The Makati Extension Office offers only the Training Courses for Instructors 
(IMO MC 6.09) and the Assessment Examination and Certification of Seafarers 

(IMO MC 3.12). 

 

5.6 NMP maintains a pool of Guest Lecturers for its PDC courses who can easily be 
tapped when services are needed.  As a matter of tradition, NMP usually includes 

the top three of each batch of graduates in the list of its Pool of Trainers.  

Likewise, there were other Guest Lecturers, teaching the Training Course for 

Instructors or IMO Model Course 6.09 in other accredited providers in Manila 

who were requesting to be invited as resource persons in NMP Makati. 

 

5.7 Audit during the three-year period from CY 2018 to CY 2020 revealed the 
following observations: 



 

64 
 

 

a. Excessive honorarium, and the doubtful reasonableness of the process of 

selection of Guest Lecturers and assignment of training loads. 
 

5.8 For the three-year period, the NMP paid a total of P15,056,400.00 in honoraria 
for the guest lecturers of NMP Tacloban and NMP Makati (see Annex A, A1, A2 

and A3 for details). 

 

5.9 To summarize, Table 12 below shows the top seven highest paid guest lecturers 
and assessors who were paid honoraria for the three-year period: 

 
Table 12: Top seven highest paid Guest Lecturers of PDC Courses for Years 2018-2020

Engr. Elmer G. Mendiola 451,200.00 624,000.00 0.00 1,075,200.00 
In CY 2020 Training at NMP Manila and Tacloban were suspended from March 15, 2020 to July 19, 2020 

 

5.10 It can be gleaned from Table 12 that there is a wide gap in the amount of 
honorarium each Guest Lecturer received with the same rate of P1,200.00/hour.  

Further, we observed that the highest paid Guest Lecturer lectures only in one 

course (IMO MC 6.09); while the second, lectures in three courses (IMO MC 

3.12; 6.09 and 6.10) and the third, lectures in two courses (IMO MC 6.09 and 

6.10).  The rest of the details and the percentage share of each of these Guest 

Lecturers to the total number of hours conducted in all PDC Courses see Annexes 

A, A1, A2 and A3. 

 

5.11 The above data implies that the top highest paid Guest Lecturer has been assigned 
the majority of the training loads for IMO MC 6.09, which has resulted in her 

being the highest paid.  Likewise, her average annual honorarium of P1.10 million 

exceeds the salary of the highest paid training specialist of NMP of P1.02 million, 

the latter being a regular/permanent position.  The former’s average annual 

honorarium could have even been higher had there been no suspension of 

courses/classes from March to July 2020 due to the pandemic.  Further, with the 

absence of information as to the equivalent position of this highest paid  Guest 

Lecturer to the plantilla training staff  position and the limit of honorarium to be 

given,  per NMP OED MC No. 044-2002, the salary of the highest paid training 

specialist of NMP was used in the comparison.  This may translate to a 

wider/higher gap on the excess payment paid to this Guest Lecturer. These 

conditions cast doubt on the reasonableness of the selection of Guest Lecturers, 

and the assignment of loads obviously favors the highest paid Guest Lecturer. 

 

 



 

65 
 

5.12 The staff requirements and qualifications as stated in the Course Framework for 
the PDC IMO Model Course 6.09, where the highest paid Guest Lecturer lectures 

as follows: 

 

1. Conducted by two experienced instructors with background 
knowledge of the shipping industry and some experience in 

maritime education and training; and  

2. Ideally, at least one member of staff should have undergone 
professional teaching training. 

 

5.13 Further evaluation revealed that the highest paid Guest Lecturer is qualified to 
teach the Course because prior to her stint at NMP, she had undergone various 

trainings on the field of insurance industry like fire insurance, motor insurance, 

marine insurance, among others.  Her professional experience included HR staff 

and trainer in a private insurance corporation.  She started teaching at NMP 

Makati Training School in February 2018 after she graduated in the IMO MC 

6.09 course, one of the requirements to be able to handle that particular PDC 

class, in December 2017. 

 

5.14 Table 12 and Annexes A, A1, A2 and A3 for the three-year period from CY 2018 
to CY 2020, however, show that the highest paid Guest Lecturer consistently held 

the most number of training hours rendered as guest lecturer in IMO MC 6.09, in 

particular.  As already mentioned, the total amount of honorarium she received 

surpassed the annual salary of the highest paid training officer of NMP (see 

Annex C) and the Middle Management/Division Heads (Annex B).  In fact, as far 

as her honorarium is concerned, the amount she received was only third to the 

annual salary rate of NMP’s top management, the Executive Director and the 

Deputy Executive Director. 

 

5.15 The Officer-in-Charge (OIC) at the Makati Extension Office is the mother of this 
guest lecturer, and it is the OIC at the NMP Makati who prepares the 

Training/Workload schedules for all the training courses offered thereat.  Thus, 

the OIC of NMP Makati has the final decision to determine who among the 

lecturers under the Pool of Trainers are available for a particular schedule.  Once 

the lecturer is identified, an invitation letter is prepared for the approval of the 

Executive Director.  However, in most cases, it is the OIC in Makati who signs 

the invitation letters for the Guest Lecturers.   

 

5.16 Thus, the prevailing mode of hiring of the services of the GLs at the NMP Makati 
appears to rest primarily with the Makati Office OIC, who appears to have 

extended unwarranted favor to the highest paid Guest Lecturer concerned, to the 

disadvantage or exclusion of other equally qualified and competent subject matter 

experts in the NMP.  This condition contradicts Section 4(c) of RA No. 6713, 

which prohibits public officers from extending undue favors on account of their 

office to their relatives, whether by consanguinity or affinity, except with respect 



 

66 
 

to appointments of such relatives to positions considered strictly confidential or 

as members of their personal staff whose terms are coterminous with theirs. 

 

5.17 As earlier stated, NMP OED MC Number 044-2002 dated December 27, 2002 
sets the limit of the amount of honorarium that shall be paid to a Guest Lecturer, 

per category, which shall not exceed the monthly salary of a particular plantilla 

position/s of organic training staff of NMP (see Annex C).  The said limit appears 

to have not been observed by NMP Makati.  Without this limit, the selection of 

Guest Lecturers and assignment of loads could be abused, as herein noted, to the 

exclusion of other equally competent subject matter experts.  This is a matter of 

concern as there might come a time when no one will apply anymore for 

permanent training staff positions in NMP or its training staff will all be regular 

guest lecturers/instructors. 

 

b. Failure to hire permanent training staff to augment current plantilla 

positions resulting in higher maintenance expense as compared to 

maintaining regular training staff 

 

5.18 Likewise, the audit disclosed that aside from receiving honoraria, the guest 
lecturers enjoy, among others, free meals and snacks, as well as, plane fare for 

those who are not from Tacloban City. 

 

5.19 Post audit of the other related expenses of the hired guest lecturers disclosed a 
yearly average of P524,160.86 in other expenses for the Guest Lecturers’ plane 

fares, and for meals and snacks, shown in the table below.

In CY 2020 Training at NMP Manila and Tacloban were suspended from March 15, 2020 to July 19, 2020 

 

5.20 Further, the verification of the Personal Services Itemization and Plantilla of 
Personnel (PSIPOP) of NMP for the fiscal years 2019 to 2020 disclosed that there 

were vacant positions under Maritime Training and Assessment Division 

(MTAD).  The Audit Team believes that filling up these vacant positions with 

qualified persons, as well as, making a request for additional plantilla positions 

to augment the current personnel complement for the training staff, will be more 

cost effective and beneficial to NMP.  This will also minimize the hiring of the 

services of Guest Lecturers, which appears to be costly as shown above.  NMP 

being the only government training institution for Filipino seafarers may have an 

edge when additional personnel for its training staff is secured from appropriate 

government agencies. 



 

67 
 

 

5.21 Due to the breakdown in controls, it was also observed that the payment of the 
honorarium for the guest lecturers lacked the basic documents required for the 

payment of services rendered to the government.  There were no time cards or 

similar documents attached to the claims, which records the actual time of arrival 

and end of training for the trainer’s assigned task for the day.  Likewise, the report 

of the flow of the actual conduct of the seminar/training was not submitted to 

support the disbursement vouchers.  Absence of these documents precluded the 

Audit Team from ascertaining the correctness of the amount of honorarium paid 

to these guest lecturers. 

 

5.22 We recommended that the management of NMP:  
 

5) create an independent body to re-evaluate the propriety and 
reasonableness of hiring of Guest Lecturers and distribution of 

training loads in NMP Makati; 

 

6) formulate a clear-cut policy in hiring of Guest Lecturers, and equitable 
distribution of loads to provide equal opportunities to qualified 

personnel, and competent subject matter experts, including the 

ranking of Guest Lecturers and determining the comparable regular 

positions, in accordance with NMP OED MC No. 044-2002; 

 

7) consider filling up vacant positions under MTAD, and undertake 
further study on the feasibility of creating additional plantilla positions 

for NMP’s training needs as against hiring Guest Lecturers; and 

 

8) comply with the submission of a Daily Time Record showing the actual 
hours rendered by the guest lecturers, and the actual program and 

schedule of the conduct of the seminars and courses for monitoring and 

post audit of the payment of services rendered. 

 

5.23 In a written six-page reply to the AOM, the management of NMP responded by 
showing  the following table which is the list of the pool of eight guest lecturers 

and one organic personnel for the PDCs in NMP Tacloban and NMP Makati:

5.24 In the letter-response, NMP further stated that they only invite guest lecturers 
based on their field of expertise and their availability as they also have other 

commitments in other companies they are connected with.  Likewise, NMP 

further commented that they had encountered many invitations to the GLs that 

were denied due to their previous commitments.  In relation to this and as shown 

in the table, the highest paid GL exclusively teaches at the NMP Makati Training 

Center. 

 

5.25 Likewise, NMP recounted other trainings attended by the highest paid GL, and 
her curriculum vitae, among others, which COA found it irrelevant to the audit 

issue because the Audit Team was not questioning the qualification of the GL. In 

the letter, there were some statements which we would like to comment on: 

 

i. that all invitation letters to the GLs were signed by the Executive Director. 
We noted during the audit that there were invitation letters attached to the 

DVs which were signed only by the OIC NMP Makati; 

 

ii. the day to day flow of the actual conduct of training which they attached as 
supporting documents to the DVs for the claims was the exact same 

schedule of activities attached to the invitation letters sent to the GLs.  This 

is unrealistic because the actual conduct of the trainings will have a few 

changes to its schedule;   

 

iii. the records of actual attendance for the GLs which they claim to be 
maintaining have yet to be submitted to the Audit Team as one of the 

supporting documents for all claims for the  honoraria;  and 

 

iv. only a limited number of Training Staff positions were approved (25 
positions) under the Rationalization Plan, and those positions were 

primarily allocated to Head MTAD, Deputy Division Head, the five 

Division Heads of MTAD, and the remaining positions, to those who 



 

69 
 

conduct the regular courses offered as mandated by MARINA.  The existing 

vacant position were already allocated to those who will handle the Standard 

of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping (STCW) mandatory courses, 

particularly where NMP is deficient.  

 

5.26 In the letter-response we noted how NMP failed to comment on its disregard of 
their very own NMP OED No. 044-2002 which sets the limit the amount of 

honorarium that shall be paid to GL, whereby the honoraria paid to the GL, should 

not exceed the monthly salary of a particular plantilla position/s of organic 

training staff of NMP. 

 

5.27 Nevertheless, the NMP management assured the Audit Team of its willingness to 
fully implement what had been recommended by COA and the following recently 

issued OEDs Memo and Special Orders will translate to improved training 

operations at NMP:  

 

1) OED MO No. 18.2021 dated March 5, 2021, which designates an organic 
training staff, and a training coordinator at the NMP Makati, whose function 

is to ensure an equitable load distribution among trainers.   

2) OED Special Order 034.2021 dated June 1, 2021, designating an organic 
training staff, as Assistant Head, PDC to primarily assist in the planning, 

supervision and implementation of the programs under PDC, both in-house 

and offsite; and 

 

3) OED Special Order No. 036.2021 dated July 1, 2021, defining the duties and 
responsibilities in the conduct of PDCs in order to effect the smooth 

implementation of said courses, whether in-house or offsite. 

 

 

Gender and Development (GAD) 

 

6. Audit of the GAD funds for the year revealed that the total GAD budget of 
P8,639,656.06 constitutes 6.64% of NMP’s CY 2020 appropriations of 

P107,483,760.00.  The CY 2020 GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) of NMP was 

already endorsed by the Philippine Commission on Women (PCW) as of July 21, 

2020.  The related GAD Accomplishment Report (AR) for the year was already 

reviewed by PCW as of May 24, 2021. 

 

The two focused activities indicated in the GPB are client-focused and 

organization-focused.  The organization-focused GAD activities amounting to 

P7,370,340.00 constituted 85% of the total budget of NMP for the GAD, while 

the remaining activities amounting to P1,269,316.06 or 15% were client-focused.  

In the GAD AR, NMP was able to utilize 86.45% of the approved GPB, 

summarized in the table below:

2.   The existence and accuracy 

of the year-end balance of PPE at 

gross cost of P1,011,849,781.38 

could not be ascertained due to: 

(a) non-inclusion of some PPE 

accounts valued at 

P73,133,011.42 in the Report on 

the Physical Count of Property, 

Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE); 

(b) discrepancy of 

P80,673,778.75 between the 

balance in the financial 

statements (FS) and the balance 

in the submitted RPCPPE; (c) 

unaccounted PPE items 

aggregating P37,412,804.13; and 

(d) misclassification of some 

properties totalling 

P26,699,361.74, thereby 

affecting the fair presentation of 

the financial statements. 

 

We recommended that the 

Executive Director require the: 

 

2) a) Inventory Committee to 
regularly conduct an 

inventory of all their assets, 

prepare the RPCPPE and 

submit to the Audit Team 

and the Accounting Section 

within the deadline set in the

Head of Material Resource 

and Management Section 

(MRMS) to: 

 

3) a) reconcile their 
respective       records to 

ascertain that all the PPE 

items are duly accounted 

for; to make the necessary 

adjustments in both 

records to come up with 

correct account balances;

Implemented – 

 

The adjusting entries for the 

identified/reconciled PPE 

items were duly supported 

with complete documents. 

 

12. The Property, Plant and 

Equipment (PPE) account 

balance of P780,609,102.79 as 

of year end is unreliable due to: 

a) absence of physical inventory 

reports to validate existence of 

assets contrary to Section 122 of 

PD No. 1445, Section 66 of the 

Manual on NGAS; and b) 

inclusion in the balance sheet of 

a big amount of lost and 

destroyed properties, contrary to 

Section 73 of PD No. 1445. 

 

28) We recommended that 
management should 

conduct physical count of 

properties and submit the 

report thereon in observance 

of Section 66 of the NGAS 

Manual and Section 122 (1) 

of PD No. 1445 and comply 

with Section 73 of PD No. 

1445 in order that relief 

from accountability for lost 

properties, properly 

supported with documents 

enumerated in COA 

Memorandum No. 1992-

751, may be granted by the 

Commission and credit from 

such loss may be effected in 

the books.

The Executive Director 

instructed the Inventory 

Committee to regularly 

conduct inventory of all 

PPE items of NMP 

Tacloban and Manila and 

prepare consolidated 

RPCPPE in accordance 

with the standards set 

forth in GAM for NGAs. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Implemented – 

 

The physical count of PPEs 

was duly conducted in CY 

2020, and the corresponding 

RPCPPE was already 

submitted. 

13. Reliability of the Property, 

Plant and Equipment (PPE) 

account balance of the agency 

aggregating P744,703,432.02 as 

of December 31, 2012 is 

doubtful due to: a) absence of 

subsidiary ledgers to support 

AAR 

CY 

2012 

The Supply Officer and 

the Accountant have 

already identified several 

properties comprising the 

unreconciled PPE items 

and the necessary 

adjustments were made.

various PPE amounting to 

P29,767,436.97 and other 

necessary records; b)   absence 

of physical inventory reports to 

validate existence of assets; c) 

dropping of unserviceable 

properties without actual 

disposal totaling P66,947.00 

instead of reclassifying to Other 

Assets account; d) non dropping 

from the books disposed 

unserviceable properties and 

expired anti-virus software 

worth P431,415.00; and e) 

erroneous classification of some 

properties amounting to 

P15,473,686.94. 

 

We recommended that 

management should: 

 

29) a. strictly require the 
Accountant and the Supply 

Officer to maintain 

subsidiary ledgers and 

Property Cards in adherence 

to pertinent provisions of 

NGAS Manual in order that 

reconciliation of both 

records can be made. 

 

There was a decrease of 

unreconciled PPE items 

from P37,412,804.13 in 

CY 2019 to 

P14,078,923.53 in CY 

2020. 

 

The reconciliation of the 

remaining unaccounted 

PPE items is still on-

going There is a difficulty 

in the reconciliation 

process due to absence of 

documents. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Not Implemented – 

 

As of December 31, 2020, 

the unreconciled PPE items 

in the books amounted to 

P14,078,923.53. This 

observation is reiterated in 

Part II of this Report. 

 

14. Due to laxity in following 

laws, rules, and regulations, a 

total of P937,500.00 were paid 

for the Equalization Grants of all 

NMP personnel without 

sufficient legal basis contrary to 

Section 4 of PD No. 1445 thus 

resulted in the doubtful validity 

of the claim, as well as the 

accuracy of the Cash National 

Treasury – MDS, and Other 

Personnel Benefits accounts. 

 

30) We recommended the 
management to submit 

immediately the legal basis 

and written justification as 

to why said transaction was 

processed and approved 

even if this was not 

supported with 

complete/necessary 

documents and legal basis.
