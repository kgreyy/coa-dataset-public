We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAIs) and we believed that it provided a reasonable basis for the audit results.

2)	Receivable Accounts totaling ₱15,361,477.40 are unreliable and doubtful due to a) unavailable supporting records/documents to explain their existence/establishment and b) provision of Impairment Loss - Accounts Receivables is without valid bases, contrary to Section 27 of the Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standards (PPSAS), Section 15, Chapter 2 and Section 9, Chapter 3 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs) and Sections 111 and 112 of Presidential  Decree (PD) 1445, thus, impairing the accuracy and correctness of the balances of Receivable Accounts and the corresponding revenue accounts in the Financial Statements as of November 30, 2020.

	

The above and other findings and recommendations which were discussed by the Audit Team with you and other officials in an exit conference on February 15, 2021 are discussed in detail on Part II of the report.



We request that the recommended measures be implemented and we would appreciate being informed on the actions taken thereon by accomplishing the attached Agency Action Plan and Status of Implementation (AAPSI) form, to be submitted to the Audit Team within 60 days from receipt of this report, pursuant to Section 89 of RA 11465, the General Provisions of General Appropriations Act for FY 2020.

MINDANAO STATE UNIVERSITY - NAAWAN

Naawan, Misamis Oriental



















For the Year Ended December 31, 2020













EXECUTIVE SUMMARY



A. INTRODUCTION



The Mindanao State University at Naawan was founded as a field laboratory of the MSU College of Fisheries under Dean Domiciano Kapili Villaluz in 1964. This field laboratory was intended to complement the MSU College of Fisheries program in freshwater aquaculture. Through the help of the municipal government, a 15-hectare mangrove area in Naawan, Misamis Oriental was acquired for training students in the design and construction of brackishwater ponds for culture of commercially important species of fish. 

		

	By 1981, the University was restructured pursuant to BOR Resolution No. 285, Series of 1981. In 1982, Naawan Fisheries High School was integrated with the Institute pursuant to BOR Resolution No. 174, Series of 1982. In 1988, MSU Naawan was formally organized as a distinct autonomous unit of the MSU System pursuant to Memorandum Order Nos. 3 and No. 45 and BOR Resolution No. 92, Series of 1988. Its vision is to be an internationally recognized dynamic institution providing relevant, excellent and quality education. Its mission is to holistically develop God-fearing manpower resources committed to the core values of integrity, industry, with respect to cultural diversity, and environmental sustainability for service excellence.



Under the new organizational structure, the Campus is headed by Chancellor Dr. Elnor C. Roa, supported by four (4) Vice Chancellors, six (6) Deans of Colleges and Schools, two (2) Directors, and four (4) Chiefs of Offices.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic that swept the world and put the country in lockdown beginning mid-March, some operations of the campus have been affected. There are research and extension fieldworks that have been halted and postponed. Despite this, MSU Naawan continued to strive to adjust to the new normal.  As of December 31, 2020, the Campus has total personnel of 347, as shown below:

A)			INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

		

	The auditor rendered a modified-qualified opinion on the fairness of the presentation of the financial statements for the year then ended, due to the following:



1)	Reported balances of Inventory Accounts totaling ₱11,299,739.16 as of November 30, 2020 are unreliable and inaccurate due to a) un-updated  stock cards maintained by the Property or Supply Division Unit, b) un-updated Supplies Ledger Cards maintained by the Accounting Division, and c) failure to conduct Physical Count of Inventories and non-preparation and non-submission of the Report thereof, contrary to Sections 9, 15 and 17 Chapter 8, of Government Accounting Manual (GAM)  Volume I and Instructions on Appendix 66 of GAM Volume II, thus, impairing the fairness of the presentation of the Financial Statements as of November 30,2020.



2)	Receivable Accounts totaling ₱15,361,477.40 are unreliable and doubtful due to a) unavailable supporting records/documents to explain their existence/establishment and b) provision of Impairment Loss - Accounts Receivables is without valid bases, contrary to Section 27 of the Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standards (PPSASs), Section 15, Chapter 2 and Section 9, Chapter 3 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs) and Sections 111 and 112 of Presidential  Decree (PD) 1445, thus, impairing the accuracy and correctness of the balances of Receivable Accounts and the corresponding revenue accounts in the Financial Statements as of November 30, 2020.





B)	 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



	In addition, the following is a summary of significant observations and recommendations which were discussed in Part II of the report and in an exit conference on February 15, 2021:



1)	Cash Advances totaling ₱5,252,583.55 remained unliquidated as of November 30, 2020 contrary to Section 89 of P.D. 1445, pertinent Sections of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 and Government Accounting Manual for National Government Agencies (GAM for NGAs) Volume I, thus, indicating weak internal control on the granting, utilization and liquidation of cash advances which may result to misuse and abuse of utilization of funds by officials and employees.



	We recommended to the management the following:

	

a)		Take appropriate action for the full settlement of the unliquidated cash advances totaling ₱5,252,583.55 as of November 30, 2020;

	

b)		Require the Acting Head/Accountant to issue demand letters for the immediate settlement/liquidation of outstanding cash advances, or resort to deducting the same from the claims of concerned officials and employees;

	

c)		Stop the granting of additional cash advances to employees with previous cash advances;

	

d)		Strengthen internal control in the granting, utilization and liquidation of cash advances by maintaining an individual ledger cards for cash advances to ensure that no additional cash advances shall be granted and liquidations thereof shall be made within the reglementary period; and

	

e)		Prepare and maintain the Cash Disbursements Record in accordance with the template and instructions provided in the GAM Volume II or as herein attached as Appendix A and A-1.	



2)	Cash Exam Observations on the Cash and account of Cashier:



A)	The Accountable Officer (AO) incurred cash shortage and overage with a net amount of ₱11,406.76 for the collections under Trust Fund, Business Related Fund and Special Trust Fund due to erroneous recording resulting to inaccurate balances per fund.



	We recommended that management require the Accountable Officer (AO) to record properly and correctly all the above-mentioned reconciling items in order to arrive at the correct balances in her Cash Receipts Records (CRRs); restitute immediately the amount of ₱10.00 shortage; and issue official receipt for the cash overage amounting to ₱0.25.



B)	Collections were not deposited intact daily or as soon as collections reached ₱10,000.00 in violation of Item 32, Chapter II of COA Memorandum No. 2013-004 or Revised Cash Examination Manual dated July 9, 2013.



	We recommended that management require the Accountable Officer to deposit the collections intact daily or as soon as it reaches ₱10,000.00 to the authorized government depository bank (AGDB) to protect the interest of the government.	

C)	Obsolete checks of various bank accounts were still in the possession of the Agency as of December 21, 2020 contrary to Section 99 of GAAM Volume I, resulting in the accumulation of useless/worthless accountable forms in the Monthly Report of Accountability.



	We recommended that management require the accountable officer to prepare an Inventory of Obsolete Checks and submit to COA for inspection and destruction as provided in Section 99 of the Government Accounting and Auditing Manual, Volume I as the basis for dropping the obsolete checks from the Monthly Report of Accountability for Accountable forms.



D)	Books of Accounts of the accountable officer and the accountant were not reconciled at least quarterly in violation of Item 6.3 of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997; thus, differences were not promptly adjusted.



	We recommended that management require the Accountable Officer and the Accountant to reconcile their records to correct/adjust the above discrepancies and to conduct regular reconciliation of their records as required under COA Circular No. 97-002 to arrive at correct balances.



E)	Unrecorded deposits/credit memos/interest income, checks issued/debit memos/tax remittances and other erroneous items were found in Check Disbursement Records (CkDR) due to non-reconciliation of accounts which resulted to unreliable balances contrary, to Section 111 and 112 of Presidential Decree No. 1445 and Government Accounting Manual (GAM).



	We recommended that management require the accountable officer to reconcile her records with the accountant to show and come up with reliable information on her CkDR. Moreover, she should carefully review the figures placed and computed in the CkDR to avoid erasures and errors. 



F)	Long outstanding reconciling items under the cash account per accounting books remained unrecorded and uncorrected, thus balances are not accurate.



	We recommended that management require the accountant to correct and record all reconciling items in order to disclose the correct balances in the CIB accounts.



3)	Stale checks totaling ₱42,564.95 were not cancelled/reverted to Cash in Bank Account after remaining outstanding for over six months from date of issue, thus understating the balance of the same and the corresponding payable account, contrary to Section 44, Chapter 6 of Government Accounting Manual Volume I.



We recommended that management require the accountant to cancel the stale checks and the corresponding amounts be reverted to their respective funds and adjusting entries be made to correct the account.



4)	Recording of some transactions in the different petty cash fund records were erroneously interchanged, thus, monitoring of balances are not accurate and replenishment is delayed in violation of Section 6, Chapter II of the Revised Cash Examination Manual and Section 37, GAM Vol. II.



We recommended that management require the PCFC to observe proper recording of the transactions in the petty cash fund records for proper monitor the accuracy of transaction and for proper reconciliation in the accounting records.



1)	Refund/return of unutilized amount relating to petty cash fund is delayed in violation of section 4.1.3, COA Circular no. 97-002. Moreover, petty cash fund custodian is not provided with a safe thus, funds are prone to theft and misappropriation.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT



DR. J. PROSPERO E. DE VERA III

Chairman of the Commission on Higher Education 

Chairperson of the Board of Regents - Mindanao State University System

Diliman, Quezon City



DR. ELNOR C. ROA

Chancellor

Mindanao State University- Naawan

Naawan, Misamis Oriental



Modified-Qualified Opinion



We have audited the accompanying financial statements of MSU-Naawan, Naawan, Misamis Oriental, which comprise the Statement of Financial Position as at December 31, 2020, and the Statement of Financial Performance, Statement of Cash Flows, Statement of Changes in Net Assets/Equity and   Statement of Comparison of Budget and Actual Amounts for the year then ended and Notes to Financial Statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.



In our opinion, except for the effects of the matters described in the Bases for Modified-Qualified Opinion section of our report, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material respect, the financial position of the MSU-Naawan as at December 31, 2020 and its financial performance, its cash flows and its comparison of budget and actual amounts for the year then ended in accordance with International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS). 



Bases for Modified-Qualified Opinion



As discussed in Part II of this report, the significant findings and recommendations are as follows:

	

1)	Reported balances of Inventory Accounts totaling ₱11,299,739.16 as of November 30, 2020 are unreliable and inaccurate due to a) un-updated  stock cards maintained by the Property or Supply Division Unit, b) un-updated Supplies Ledger Cards maintained by the Accounting Division, and c) failure to conduct Physical Count of Inventories and non-preparation and non-submission of the Report thereof, contrary to Sections 9,15 and 17 Chapter 8, of Government Accounting Manual (GAM)  Volume I and Instructions on Appendix 66 of GAM Volume II, thus, impairing the fairness of the presentation of the Financial Statements as of November 30,2020.









We recommended to management the following:



	a)	Maintain Supplies Ledger Card (SLC) for each kind of supplies and materials at the Accounting Division where to record every material received, issued and the balance both in quantity and amount at any time. Stock Card (SC) shall be used also to record every receipts and issues of supplies and the balance in quantity at any time at the Property and/or Supply Division for each item in stock. Thus, SLC and SC should be updated; and 



	b)	Conduct Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) semi-annually and Report thereon shall be prepared and submitted to our office and to other concerned divisions of the institute as required in the GAM Volume II.



2)	Receivable Accounts totaling ₱15,361,477.40 are unreliable and doubtful due to a) unavailable supporting records/documents to explain their existence/establishment and b) provision of Impairment Loss- Accounts Receivables is without valid bases, contrary to Section 27 of the Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standards (PPSASs), Section 15, Chapter 2 and Section 9, Chapter 3 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs) and Sections 111 and 112 of Presidential  Decree (PD) 1445, thus, impairing the accuracy and correctness of the balances of Receivable Accounts and the corresponding revenue accounts in the Financial Statements as of November 30, 2020.



We recommend to management the following courses of actions:



a)	Exert more efforts to retrieve the documents in support to the existence of the receivable accounts, otherwise, evaluate the dormant accounts and comply with all the conditions and requirements of COA Circular 2016 – 005 dated December 19, 2016 for the request for write-off;



b)	Regulate properly or set-up a policy as a remedy in the failure of the students to pay their tuition fees and other fees incurred by them; and 



c)	Properly evaluate the recognized Impairment Loss amounting to ₱1,622,482.74 in order to present fairly the Financial Statements of the agency, and the amount to be recognized shall be in accordance with Section 9, Chapter 3 of Government Accounting Manual (GAM) Volume I.



We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAIs). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the agency in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our modified-qualified opinion.



Key Audit Matters



Except for the matter described in the Bases for Modified-Qualified Opinion section, we have determined that there are no other key audit matters to communicate in our report.



Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial Statements



Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with IPSAS, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.



Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the University’s financial reporting process.



Auditor’s Responsibilities for Audit of the Financial Statements



Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high-level assurance, but is not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAIs) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

The consolidated financial statements of Mindanao State University at Naawan were authorized for issue on February 14, 2021 as shown in the Statement of Management Responsibility for Financial Statements signed by Dr. Elnor C. Roa, the Chancellor.



Mindanao State University at Naawan (MSUN) had its humble beginning as a field laboratory of MSU-Marawi-College of Fisheries under the deanship of Domiciano K. Villaluz. The College made so many breakthroughs on research and the MSU Administration in Marawi gave more support to MSU-Naawan then known as Marine Fisheries Research Laboratory (MFRL) of the College of Fisheries. On December 4, 1973, the MFRL was renamed to Institute of Fisheries and Research Development (IFRD). In 1988, MSUN became an autonomous unit of MSU System by virtue of an E.O. 45 signed by former President Corazon C. Aquino and later on by an action of the Board of Regents when it approved the MSU System Code of Governance per Resolution No. 92 series of 1988.



The vision of the Agency is to become the premier state institution in aquaculture, fisheries and marine sciences in Southern Philippines within the MSU System. Its missions are to undertake research and development activities on the marine and fisheries resources of Southern Philippines for their effective exploitation, development and conservation and to provide professional and technical training in the field of aquaculture, fisheries, marine sciences and allied disciplines to meet the needs and manpower requirements of the industry.



The Agency’s registered office is located in Pedro Pagalan Street, Poblacion, Naawan, Misamis Oriental.



2)	Statement of Compliance and Basis of Preparation of Financial Statements



The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with and comply with the Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standards (PPSAS) issued by the Commission on Audit per COA Resolution No. 2014-003 dated January 24, 2014.



The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of historical cost, unless stated otherwise. The Statement of Cash Flows is prepared using the direct method. 



3)	Summary of Significant Accounting Policies



	1)	Basis of accounting



The consolidated financial statements are prepared on an accrual basis in accordance with the Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standards (PPSAS).



	2)	Financial instruments



a)	Financial assets



Initial recognition and measurements



Financial assets within the scope of PPSAS 29-Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement are classified as financial assets at fair value through surplus or deficit, held-to-maturity investments, loans and receivables or available-for-sale financial assets, as appropriate. MSUN determines classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.



Purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation or convention in the marketplace (regular way trades) are recognized on the trade date, i.e., the date that MSUN commits to purchase or sell the asset.



MSUN’s financial assets included: cash and short-term deposits; trade and other receivables; loans and other receivables, quoted and unquoted financial instruments; and derivative financial instruments.



Subsequent measurement



The subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on their classification. 



Loans and receivables



Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method, less impairment. Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the effective interest rate. Losses arising from impairment are recognized in the surplus or deficit.



Derecognition



MSUN derecognizes a financial asset or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a MSUN of similar financial assets when:



--	The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired or is waived

--	MSUN has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party; and either: (a) MSUN has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset; or (b) MSUN has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.



Impairment of financial assets



MSUN assesses at each reporting date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is deemed to be impaired if, and only if, there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (an incurred “loss event”) and that loss event has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or the group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.



Evidence of impairment may include the following indicators:



--	The debtors or a group of debtors are experiencing significant financial difficulty

--	Default or delinquency in interest or principal payments

--	The probability that debtors will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganization

--	Observable data indicates a measurable decrease in estimated future cash flows (e.g., changes in arrears or economic conditions that correlate with defaults)



Financial assets carried at amortized cost



For financial assets carried at amortized cost, MSUN first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for financial assets that are individually significant, or collectively for financial assets that are not individually significant. If MSUN determines that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, whether significant or not, it includes the asset in a group of financial assets with similar credit risk characteristics and collectively assesses them for impairment. Assets that are individually assessed for impairment and for which an impairment loss is, or continues to be, recognized are not included in a collective assessment of impairment.



If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future expected credit losses what have not yet been incurred). The present value of the estimated future cash flows is discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate. If a loan has a variable interest rate, the discount rate for measuring any impairment loss is the current effective interest rate.



The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognized in surplus or deficit. Loans together with the associated allowance are written off when there is no realistic prospect of future recovery and all collateral has been realized or transferred to MSUN. If, in a subsequent year, the amount of the estimated impairment loss increases or decreases because of an event occurring after the impairment was recognized, the previously recognized impairment loss is increased or reduced by adjusting the allowance account. If a future write-off is later recovered, the recovery is credited to finance costs in surplus or deficit.



b)	Financial liabilities 



Initial recognition and measurement 



Financial liabilities within the scope of PPSAS 29 are classified as financial liabilities at fair value through surplus or deficit or loans and borrowings, as appropriate. The entity determines the classification of its financial liabilities at initial recognition.



All financial liabilities are recognized initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings, plus directly attributable transaction costs.



MSUN’s financial liabilities include trade and other payables.



Subsequent measurement



The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification.



Derecognition



A financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.



When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognized in surplus or deficit.







	3)	Cash and cash equivalents



Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and cash at bank, and deposits on call. For the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term deposits as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.



	4)	Inventories



Inventory is measured at cost upon initial recognition. To the extent that inventory was received through non-exchange transactions (for no cost or for a nominal cost), the cost of the inventory is its fair value at the date of acquisition.



Inventories are recognized as an expense when deployed for utilization or consumption in the ordinary course of operations of MSUN.



	5)	Property, Plant and Equipment



Recognition



An item is recognized as property, plant and equipment (PPE) if it meets the PPSAS 17.13 characteristics and recognition criteria s PPE.



The characteristics of PPE are as follows:



--	tangible items;

--	are held for use in the production or supply of goods or services, for rental to others, or for administrative purposes; and

--	are expected to be used during more than one reporting period.



An item of PPE is recognized as an asset if:



--	It is probable that future economic benefits or service potential associated with the item will flow to the entity; and

--	The cost or fair value of the item can be measured reliably.



Measurement at Recognition



An item recognized as property, plant, and equipment is measured at cost.



A PPE acquired through non-exchange transaction is measured at its fair value as at the date of acquisition.



The cost of the PPE is the cash price equivalent or, for PPE acquired through non-exchange transaction its cost is its fair value as at recognition date.



Cost includes the following:



--	Its purchase price, including import duties and non-refundable purchase taxes, after deducting trade discounts and rebates;

--	Expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items; and

--	Initial estimate of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site on which it is located, the obligation for which an entity incurs either when the item is acquired, or as a consequence of having used the item during a particular period for purposes other than to produce inventories during that period.



Measurement After Recognition



After recognition, all property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.



When significant parts of property, plant and equipment are required to be replaced at intervals, MSUN recognizes such parts as individual assets with specific useful lives and depreciates them accordingly. Likewise, when a major repair/replacement is done, its cost is recognized in the carrying amount of the plant and equipment as a replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied.



All other repair and maintenance costs are recognized as expense in surplus or deficit as incurred.



Depreciation



Each part of an item of property, plant, and equipment with a cost that is significant in relation to the total cost of the item is depreciated separately.



The depreciation charge for each period is recognized as expense unless it is included in the cost of another asset.



Initial Recognition of Depreciation



Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use such as when it is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.



For simplicity and to avoid proportionate computation, the depreciation is for one month if the PPE is available for use on or before the 15th of the month, depreciation is for the succeeding month.









Depreciation Method



The straight-line method of depreciation is adopted unless another method is more appropriate for agency operation.



Estimated Useful Life



MSUN uses the Schedule on the Estimated Useful Life of PPE by classification prepared by COA.



MSUS uses a residual value equivalent to at least five percent (5%) of the cost of the PPE.



Impairment



An asset’s carrying amount is written down to its recoverable amount, or recoverable service amount, if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable service amount.



Derecognition



MSUN derecognizes items of property, plant and equipment and/or any significant part of an asset upon disposal of when no future economic benefits or service potential is expected from its continuing use. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the surplus or deficit when the asset is derecognized.



	6)	Changes in accounting policies and estimates



The MSUN recognizes the effects of changes in accounting policy retrospectively. The effects of changes in accounting policy were applied prospectively if retrospective application is impractical.



MSUN recognizes the effects of changes in accounting estimates prospectively by including in surplus or deficit.



MSUN correct material prior period errors retrospectively in the first set of financial statements authorized for issue after their discovery by:



--	Restating the comparative amounts for prior period(s) presented in which the error occurred; or

--	If the error occurred before the earliest prior period presented, restating the opening balances of assets, liabilities and net assets/equity for the earliest prior period presented.



	7)	Revenue from non-exchange transactions



Recognition and Measurement of Assets from Non-Exchange Transactions



An inflow of resources from a non-exchange transaction, other than services in-kind, that meets the definition of an asset were recognized as an asset if the following criteria were met:



--	It is probable that the future economic benefits or service potential associated with the asset will flow to the entity; and

--	The fair value of the asset can be measured reliably.



An asset acquired through a non-exchange transaction is initially measured at its fair value as at the date of acquisition.



Recognition Revenue from Non-Exchange Transactions



An inflow of resources from a non-exchange transaction recognized as an asset is recognized as revenue, except to the extent that a liability is also recognized in respect of the same inflow.



As MSUN satisfies a present obligation recognized as a liability in respect of an inflow of resources from a non-exchange transaction recognized as an asset, it reduces the carrying amount of the liability recognized and recognizes an amount of revenue equal to that reduction.



		Measurement of Revenue from Non-Exchange Transactions



Revenue from non-exchange transactions is measured at the amount of the increase in net assets recognized by the entity, unless a corresponding liability is recognized.

		

Measurement of Liabilities on Initial Recognition from Non-Exchange Transactions



The amount recognized as a liability in a non-exchange transaction is the best estimate of the amount required to settle the present obligation at the reporting date.



Gifts and Donations



The MSUN recognizes assets and revenue from gifts and donations when it is probable that the future economic benefits or service potential will flow to the entity and fair value of the asset can be measured reliably.



Goods in-kind were recognized as assets when the goods were received, or there is a binding arrangement to receive the goods. If goods in-kind were received without conditions attached, revenue is recognized immediately. If conditions were attached, a liability is recognized, which is reduced and revenue recognized as the conditions were satisfied.

	

On initial recognition, gifts and donations including goods in-kind were measured at their fair value as at the date of acquisition, which were ascertained by reference to an active market, or by appraisal. An appraisal of the value of an asset is normally undertaken by a member of the valuation profession who holds a recognized and relevant professional qualification. For many assets, the fair value was ascertained by reference to quoted prices in an active and liquid market.



	8)	Revenue from Exchange transactions

Measurement of Revenue



Revenue was measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable.



Sale of Goods



Revenue from the sale of goods is recognized when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer, usually on delivery of the goods and when the amount of revenue can be measured reliably and it is probable that the economic benefits or service potential associated with the transaction will flow to MSUN.



Rental income



Rental income arising from operating leases on investment properties is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease terms and included in revenue.



	9)	Budget information



The annual budget is prepared on a cash basis and is published in the government website.



A Statement of Comparison of Budget and Actual Amounts (SCBAA) was prepared since the budget and the financial statements were not prepared on comparable basis. The SCBAA was presented showing the original and final budget and the actual amounts on comparable basis to the budget. Explanatory comments are provided in the notes to the annual financial statements.

PART II



AUDIT OBSERVATIONS



AND RECOMMENDATIONS

AUDIT OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS





A)	Financial and Compliance



1)	Management did not submit complete supporting documents for five (5) major projects with an aggregate cost of ₱52,328,808.04 in violation of COA Circular No. 2009-01 dated February 12, 2009 and COA Circular 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 thus, prevented the auditor to undertake auditorial and legal review necessary for generating timely and relevant audit results and cast doubts on the regularity of the payment of the transactions.



COA Circular No. 2009-01 dated February 12, 2009 prescribes the submission of copy of government contracts, purchase orders and their supporting documents to the Commission on Audit irrespective of amount.



Item 3.1.1 of the said circular requires that “Within five (5) working days from the execution of a contract by the government or any of its subdivisions, agencies or instrumentalities, including government-owned and controlled corporations and their subsidiaries, a copy of said contract and each of all the documents forming part thereof by reference or incorporation shall be furnished to the Auditor of the agency concerned.” 



COA Circular 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 prescribed the Revised Guidelines and Documentary Requirements for Common Government Transactions.



These laws provide the documentary and information requirements of perfected contracts to facilitate the submission, review and evaluation process.  The copies of documents required to be submitted shall include those enumerated in Item 3.1.2 and such other documents peculiar to the contract and/or to the mode of procurement and considered necessary in the auditorial, legal and technical review as well as in the inspection of projects.



As for the penalty, Item 4.1 provides that “Any unjustified failure of the officials and employees concerned to comply with the requirements herein imposed shall be subject to the administrative disciplinary action provided in (a) Section 127 of Presidential Decree No. 1445; (b) Section 55, Title I-B, Book V of the Revised Administrative Code of 1987; and (c) Section 11 of Republic Act No. 6713.”

	Details of the above data are attached herewith as Appendix A. It can be gleaned from the Appendix that payments were made to respective contractors but the required documents to support the payment transactions were not complete. These lacking documents were stated on the attached Appendix A.

	

	Furthermore, Summary of Variation Orders for the above three (3) project contracts is attached herewith as Appendix B which revealed that the Original Contract Costs were revised and increased as shown above. While for the project, TSAC Phase I, Variation Orders were made but the Original Contract Cost remained the same but the Original Program of Work was revised.  In addition, we noted per our post-audit of the pertinent disbursement vouchers that some of the documentary requirements for the Variation Orders were not submitted to our office for review/evaluation of the changes in the contract costs and program of wok to determine its reasonableness.

	

	With the foregoing observations, the Audit Team was not able to undertake auditorial and legal review of the contract in the evaluation of compliance with the requirements of applicable laws, rules and regulations, completeness of documentary requirements and this would also delay the communication to management of any information or deficiencies noted in the review.

	

	Further, this also cast doubts as to reasonableness of project costs and contract prices and the legality and propriety of the contracts and its pertinent bidding documents. 

	

	We recommended to management the following:



a)	Submit immediately the lacking supporting documents as stated in the attached Appendix A;



b)	Submit also the documentary requirements for the four (4) projects as stated in the Summary of Variations per attached Appendix B where changes in the initial contract project costs and scope of works were made; and



c)	Concerned personnel must adhere strictly to pertinent rules and regulations such as COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009, Item 9.2 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 and COA Memorandum No. 2005-027 dated Feb. 28, 2005.



Management Comment:



	The management commented during the exit conference that they are thankful for the observation since they became aware of it only from the time the audit memorandum was issued to them. They immediately asked their contractors for the “clearance from Provincial Treasurer”. They also included the said clearance as one of the supporting documents that should be submitted by the contractors in their billings. 



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



When it comes to Infrastructure projects, the agency must see to it that the documentary requirements are completely complied with by the contractors because it is very hard to go after them after payments were already made. It has to be noted that the agency personnel who signed the contracts and disbursement vouchers are jointly and solidarily liable just in case a disallowance is issued thereto.



Moreover, these contract documents will be submitted to our technical service office for technical review and inspection and reasonableness of variation order.



2)	Receivable Accounts totaling ₱15,361,477.40 are unreliable and doubtful due to a) unavailable  supporting records/documents to explain their existence/establishment and b)  provision of Impairment Loss-Accounts Receivables is without valid bases,   contrary  to Section 27 of the Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standards (PPSASs), Section 15, Chapter 2  and Section 9, Chapter 3  of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs) and Sections 111 and 112 of Presidential Decree (PD) 1445, thus, impairing the accuracy and correctness of the balances of Receivable Accounts and the corresponding revenue accounts  in the Financial Statements as of November 30, 2020.



Section 27 of the PPSAS 1 and Section 15, Chapter 2 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume 1 states that “The Financial Statements shall present fairly the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in PPSASs.”



Sec. 9, Chapter 3 of GAM Volume I provides Impairment Losses and Allowance for Impairment Losses. When an uncertainty arises about the collectability of an amount already included in revenue, the uncollectible amount, or the amount in respect of which recovery has ceased to be probable, is recognized as an expense (impairment losses), rather than as an adjustment of the amount of revenue originally recognized.



Entities shall evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable on an ongoing basis based on historical bad debts, customer/recipient credit-worthiness, current economic trends and changes in payment activity. An allowance is provided for known and estimated bad debts.



Further, Sections 111 and 112 of PD No.  1445 require agencies to keep the accounts in such detail as necessary to meet the needs of the agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or control agencies of the government; and that the highest standard of honesty, objectivity and consistency shall be observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate or misleading information. Each government agency shall record its financial transactions and operations conformably with PPSASs and in accordance with pertinent laws and regulations.

Our audit of Receivable Accounts as of November 30, 2020 showed a balance of ₱15,361,477.40, breakdown of which is shown below:

GRAND-TOTAL

₱15,361,477.40









From the above data, the net aggregate receivable account balance under Fund 05 is ₱14,606,342.65 where details of Accounts Receivable of ₱15,436,824.39 and Allowance for Impairment Loss amounting to ₱1,622,482.74 are attached herewith as Appendix C-1 and C-2. 



It can be gleaned from the Appendix C-1 that the incurrence of Accounts Receivable of ₱15,436,824.39 under fund 05 was mostly from non-payment of tuition fees of more than four thousand students in the SY 2013 to SY 2019.



Further, we found out that the Allowance for Impairment Loss of ₱1,622,482.74 were outstanding receivables with ages of over two (2) years based on Aging of Accounts Receivables duly prepared on December 31, 2017 by the Finance Personnel together with Journal Entry Voucher dated Dec. 29, 2017. However, this amount has not been changed until to date despite the fact that the outstanding receivables for over 2 years was ₱3,178,824.39 as reflected in the Schedule of Aging of Accounts Receivable as of Dec. 31, 2019.



Our verification for Fund 07 disclosed that these are not supported with documents. Interview with the Finance personnel disclosed that these were just carried forward from the previous years like the balance of ₱395,500.00 which has been reflected in the Financial Statements since CY 2010. However, they are trying their best to locate the supporting documents of these receivable accounts.



With the foregoing observations, the Receivable Accounts in the amount of ₱15,361,477.40 are doubtful and unreliable, thus, impairing the fair presentation of Financial Statements as of November 30, 2020.



We recommend to management the following courses of actions:



d)	Exert more efforts to retrieve the documents in support to the existence of the receivable accounts, otherwise, evaluate the dormant accounts and comply with all the conditions and requirements of COA Circular 2016 – 005 dated December 19, 2016 for the request for write-off;

e)	Regulate properly or set-up a policy as a remedy in the failure of the students to pay their tuition fees and other fees incurred by them; and 



f)	Properly evaluate the recognized Impairment Loss amounting to ₱1,622,482.74 in order to present fairly the Financial Statements of the agency, and the amount to be recognized shall be in accordance with Section 9, Chapter 3 of Government Accounting Manual (GAM) Volume I.



Management Comment:



	The management acknowledged the observations and recommendations during the exit conference. They committed to make a policy on recognizing impairment loss so that the accountant will be guided properly in recording such impairments. 

	

	Auditor’s Rejoinder:

	

	The management should exert their best efforts to collect the receivable accounts first before they request for write-off since it is one of the major criteria in evaluating the request.



3)		Reported balances of Inventory Accounts totaling ₱11,299,739.16 as of November 30, 2020 are unreliable and inaccurate due to a) un-updated stock cards maintained by the Property or Supply Division Unit, b) un-updated Supplies Ledger Cards maintained by the Accounting Division, and c) failure to conduct Physical Count of Inventories and non-preparation and non-submission of the Report thereof, contrary to Sections 9, 15 and 17 Chapter 8, of Government Accounting Manual (GAM) Volume I and Instructions on Appendix 66 of GAM Volume II, thus,  impairing the fairness of the presentation of the Financial Statements as of November 30, 2020.

	

	Sections 9, 15 and 17 Chapter 8, Volume I of GAM provides the following:

	

	Sec. 9. Perpetual Inventory Method. Supplies and materials purchased for inventory purpose shall be recorded using the perpetual inventory system, resulting in a more accurate inventory records and a running total for the cost of goods sold in each period. The system requires accounting records to show the amount of inventory on hand at all times through the maintenance of the SLC (Appendix 57) by the Accounting Division/Unit and Stock Card (SC) (Appendix 58) by the Supply and/or Property Division/Unit for each item in stock. Regular purchases shall be coursed through the inventory account and issues thereof shall be recorded as they take place except for supplies and materials purchased out of PCF for immediate use or on emergency cases which shall be charged directly to the appropriate expense accounts

	

	Sec. 15 of the same Chapter provides further “The Procedures in the Receipt, Inspection, Acceptance and Recording of Deliveries of Inventory Items.”

	

	Moreover, Sec. 17 provides the Records, Forms and Reports to be prepared and/or maintained. The following records, forms and reports are prescribed for use:

	

a)		Stock Card (SC) – shall be used to record all receipts and issues of supplies and the balance in quantity at any time. It shall be maintained by the Property and/or Supply Division/Unit for each item in stock. The IAR, RIS, PO and DR serve as the original sources of information for making entries on the card.

	

b)		Supplies Ledger Card (SLC) – shall be used to record materials received, issued and the balance both in quantity and amount at any time. It shall be maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit for each kind of supplies and materials. The IAR, RIS, RSMI, PO and DR serve as the original sources of information for making entries on the card.

	

c)		Requisition and Issue Slip (RIS) – shall be used by the end-user to request issue of supplies and materials that are carried on stock. It is also used by the Property and/or Supply Division/Unit to indicate availability or non-availability of items requisitioned and/or to record issues of item/s requisitioned.

	

d)		Purchase Request (PR) – shall be used by the end-user to request for the purchase of inventory or item/s not available on stock. It shall be the basis of preparing the PO.

	

e)		Purchase Order (PO) – shall be used by the Property and/or Supply Custodian to support the purchase of property, supplies and materials, etc. It shall be issued to the selected supplier indicating, among other information, the specifications, quantities, and agreed prices of property, supplies and materials to be purchased.

	

f)		Report of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI) – shall be prepared by the Property and/or Supply Custodian based on the RIS and shall be used by the Accounting Division/Unit as basis in preparing the JEV to record the supplies and materials issued.

	

g)		Waste Materials Report (WMR) – shall be used by the Property and/or Supply Custodian to report all waste materials such as destroyed spare parts and other materials considered scrap due to replacement.

	

h)		Report on the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) – shall be used to report the physical count of supplies by type of inventory as at a given date. It shows the balance of inventory items per card and per count and shortage/overage, if any. These include the semi-expendable property wherein the issue is covered by ICS. 

	

i)		Inspection and Acceptance Report (IAR) – shall be used for inspection and acceptance of purchased and delivered property, supplies and materials.

	

j)		Report of Accountability for Accountable Forms (RAAF) – shall be prepared by the Accountable Officer to report on the movement and status of accountable forms in his/her possession. The accountable forms include those with or without face value.

	

k)		Inventory Custodian Slip (ICS) – shall be prepared upon issue of semi expendable property covered by approved RIS.

	

	Report on the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) shall be prepared semi-annually by the Inventory Committee and by fund cluster.

GRAND-TOTAL

₱11,299,739.16 







	

	From the above data, Accountable Forms, Plates and Stickers Inventory in the amount of P40,400.00 and Other Supplies and Materials Inventory of ₱23,361.00 under Fund 01 have not moved since CY 2018 and CY 2017, respectively.

	

	Under Fund 05, Office Supplies Inventory of ₱921,780.79 and Agricultural and Marine Supplies Inventory of ₱1,751,120.20 neither increased nor decreased since CY 2019 and CY 2018, respectively. Further, Report on the Physical Count of Inventories has never been submitted to our office. 

	

	Moreover, we found out also that the last entry made in the Stock Cards at the Property and/or Supply Unit per our inspection was in CY 2017. The Supplies Ledger Cards at the Accounting Division were not also updated since the last entries made thereon were in CY 2018. 

	

	Therefore, with the foregoing observations, the Inventory Accounts in the amount of ₱11,299,739.16.40 is apparently incorrect and unreliable, thus, impairing the fair presentation of Financial Statements as of November 30, 2020.

	

	We recommended to management the following:

	

a)		Maintain and update Supplies Ledger Card (SLC) for each kind of supplies and materials at the Accounting Division where to record every material received, issued and the balance both in quantity and amount at any time. Stock Card (SC) shall be used also to record every receipts and issues of supplies and the balance in quantity at any time at the Property and/or Supply Division for each item in stock; and 

	

b)		Conduct Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) semi-annually and Report thereon shall be prepared and submitted to our office and to other concerned divisions of the institute as required in the GAM Volume II.

	

	

	

	Management Comment:

		

		The management acknowledged their lapses in maintaining an updated SLC and SC during the exit conference. The accountant and supply officer committed to maintain SLC and SC respectively. The chancellor also committed that the agency will make it a habit in complying to the recommendations and that she will also issue a memorandum creating an inventory committee. 

	

	Auditor’s Rejoinder:

	

	In response to the management’s commitment, the team commented to do their verification afterwards, otherwise, suspension or disallowance should be made in audit, or appropriate action should be undertaken by the audit team.

	

4)		Cash Advances totaling ₱5,252,583.55 remained unliquidated as of November 30, 2020 contrary to Section 89 of P.D. 1445, pertinent Sections of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 and Government Accounting Manual for National Government Agencies (GAM for NGAs) Volume I, thus, indicating weak internal control on the granting, utilization and liquidation of cash advances which may result to misuse and abuse of utilization of funds by officials and employees.

	

	COA Circular No 97-002 provides the following guidelines on the grant, utilization and liquidation of cash advances:

	

--		No additional cash advance shall be allowed to any official or employee unless the previous cash advance given to him is first settled or a proper accounting thereof is made.

--		A cash advance shall be reported on as soon as the purpose for which it was given has been served.

--		Petty operating expenses and field operating expenses advances must be liquidated within twenty (20) days after the end of each year; subject to replenishment as frequently as necessary during the year.

--		Official travel advances shall be liquidated within 60 days after return to the Philippines in case of foreign travel or within 30 days after return to his permanent official station in the case of local travel, as provided for in EO 248.

--		All cash advances shall be fully liquidated at the end of each year. Except for petty cash fund, the AO shall refund any unexpended balance to the Cashier/Collecting Officer who will issue official receipt.

		

	Because of the heavy responsibilities put upon accountable officers, the GAM has included in its content procedures, journal entries, financial templates and the corresponding instructions on how to fill in the templates with the needed data. 

	

	Section 14 to 19, Chapter 6 of GAM Volume I governs the granting and liquidation of cash advances which is granted to regular and special disbursing officers for personal services, petty expenses and MOOE for field operating requirements. The cash advances may be granted to the cashiers/disbursing officers/officials and employees to cover the following: salaries and wages, travels, special time-bound undertakings, and petty operating expenses and shall be reported on and liquidated as soon as the purpose for which it was given has been served. The cash advance shall be used solely for the specific purpose for which it was granted and under no circumstance shall it be used for encashment of checks or for liquidation of a previous cash advance.

	

	In our conduct of cash examination on the cash and account of Ms. Jalop, cashier, on October 28, 2020, we noted and observed the following deficiencies:

	

a)		Lack of diligent efforts to promptly liquidate cash advances

	

		Par. 5.1 of COA Circular No. 97-002, dated February 10, 1997 and Section 15 of GAM Volume I provides that:

	

	“Cash advances for salaries, wages, etc. shall be liquidated within five (5) days after each fifteen (15) day/end of the month pay period.”

	

	Review of the Cash Advance Account showed that an amount totaling ₱3,573,512.14 for payroll of Labor and Scholars, granted in various dates from October 2017 to October 2020 were not fully liquidated as of November 30, 2020 due to some lacking supporting documents for labor payrolls and lack of sufficient time to communicate with the scholars due to the lockdowns caused by the pandemic. 

	

	Presented below are the unliquidated cash advances given to the Cashier/Disbursing Officer at MSU-Naawan as of November 30, 2020 amounting to ₱3,573,512.14 for payment of labor, honoraria, prizes, student-allowances, student-labor, stipends, academic incentives and refunds to scholars:

	The Accountant explained that liquidation of some of these above cash advances are on process. However, during the conduct of cash examination on October 28, 2020, all the above transactions were already recorded as liquidated in the AO’s books.

	

b)	Granting additional cash advance despite the non-liquidation of previous cash advances granted



	Additional cash advances were given to designated Special Disbursing Officers (SDOs) and other officials of the institute even though their previous cash advances were not yet settled/liquidated and not properly accounted for. This practice is contrary to Section 89 of P.D. 1445, paragraph 4.1.2 of COA Circular No. 97-002, dated February 10, 1997, and Section 14 (c) of Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies, Volume I.

	The Accountant explained that some supporting documents for the liquidation of these cash advances were already submitted to their office but they are still on process and considered not fully liquidated due to some lacking supporting documents.



c)	The Cash Disbursements Records of the Cashier were not maintained in accordance with the prescribed template provided in the GAM Volume I.

	

		Section 17, Chapter 6 of GAM Volume I provides that the Disbursing Officer shall maintain the Cash Disbursements Record (CDRec) (Appendix D) to monitor the cash advances/payroll, current operating expenses, and special purpose/time-bound undertakings. This record shall be maintained by each Disbursing/Accountable Officer to monitor the cash advance balance. All transactions for the day shall be recorded immediately. It shall be maintained by fund cluster.

		

		Review of the records maintained by the AO showed that the prescribed template provided by GAM was not followed. Some grants of cash advances do not provide the ADA/Check/DV/Payroll/Reference No.; UACS Code, and brief description of the payment, thus, identification promptly of the transaction or item could not be done.

		

		It is worthy to mention that fiscal responsibility is shared by all those exercising authority over the financial affairs, transactions, and operations of the government agency. Nevertheless, the Agency Head has the principal responsibility to ensure the proper granting, utilization and liquidation of all cash advances in accordance with the rules and regulations

		

		With the foregoing observations as the present practice of the agency, these resulted to the following:

	

--		Accumulation of the unliquidated cash advances due to partial compliance with the liquidation guidelines;

--		Understatement and overstatement of expenses, net income and other accounts affected especially if the purpose of the cash advance has been served;

--		Additional grant of cash advances to employees with unliquidated cash advances may result to misuse of funds and abuse utilization of funds;

--		Possible losses of government funds due to uncertainty of collection of the unliquidated cash advances granted to employees/officials who were no longer part of the agency; and

--		Delay in the liquidation of Cash Advance may result to loss of supporting documents thereby prompting the Accountable Officers to refund the amount of cash advances granted to them, instead of liquidating them.

	

	We recommended to the management the following:

	

a)		Take appropriate action for the full settlement of the unliquidated cash advances totaling ₱5,252,583.55 as of November 30, 2020;

	

b)		Require the Acting Head/Accountant to issue demand letters for the immediate settlement/liquidation of outstanding cash advances, or resort to deducting the same from the claims of concerned officials and employees;

	

c)		Stop the granting of additional cash advances to employees with previous cash advances;

	

d)		Strengthen internal control in the granting, utilization and liquidation of cash advances by maintaining an individual ledger cards for cash advances to ensure that no additional cash advances shall be granted and liquidations thereof shall be made within the reglementary period; and

	

e)		Prepare and maintain the Cash Disbursements Record in accordance with the template and instructions provided in the GAM Volume II or as herein attached as Appendix D and D-1.	

	

	Management’s Comment:

	

		The management commented during exit conference that this is a lesson learned for the accountable officer that she would not only depend on her book in liquidating her cash advances. The chancellor further commented that “the book is not itself a liquidation requirement, it is not even part of supporting documents for liquidation of cash advances”.

		

		The accountant also commented that they have granted additional cash advances to a number of accountable officers even their previous cash advances have not yet been settled or liquidated because the purposes are different from previous ones and the funds were taken also from different projects.

			

	Auditor’s Rejoinder:

	

		As to the maintenance of Cash Disbursements Records, use computerization for an easier, reliable, and convenient way of recording and monitoring the grant and liquidation of cash advances. 

		

		Granting of additional cash advances to AO is allowed if different purposes. However, close monitoring thereof should be done and the unliquidated cash advances at the end of the year should be minimal. If possible, they should be fully liquidated.

	

5)		Cash Exam Observations on the Cash and account of Cashier:

	

	A)		The Accountable Officer (AO) incurred cash shortage and overage with a net amount of ₱11,406.76 for the collections under Trust Fund, Business Related Fund and Special Trust Fund due to erroneous recording, resulting to inaccurate balance per fund.

	Review of the Cash Receipts Records (CRRs), Official Receipts (ORs) and validated deposit slips from December 27, 2019 to October 28, 2020 revealed that the shortage under Fund 01-Trust Fund account was due to a collection in the amount of ₱12,500.00 under Fund 06-BRF but erroneously deposited to Fund 01-TF on March 2018,  and  a collection of ₱850.00 under Fund 01-TF whereby its corresponding official receipt (O.R.) was issued but erroneously recorded as deposit under Fund 05-STF on January 3, 2018. These observations were already cited in the previous cash examination reports but not yet corrected in the books of the cashier as of this writing.

	

	Meanwhile, the shortage under Fund 06-BRF resulted from (1) an overage during the 2016 cash examination thereby an official receipt (O.R.) was issued with  No. 9518015 dated November 17, 2020 in the amount of ₱400.00; (2) erroneous recording of the collection with O.R. No. 564995 dated 9/22/2017, the amount should have been ₱7,950.00 instead of ₱7,953.00 resulting to an overstatement of ₱3.00; (3) an error in deposit in the amount of ₱2,780.00, the amount should have been deposited into Fund 01-TF account but erroneously deposited to Fund 05-STF account; (4) an under-deposit of collections during November 9-12, 2017 in the amount of ₱10.00; and (5) an over deposit of collections on January 8, 2018 in the amount of ₱0.25.

	

	Lastly, the overage under Fund 05-STF was due to (1) an error in deposit in the amount of ₱2,780.00, it should have been deposited to  Fund 01-TF account but erroneously deposited to Fund-05-STF account; (2) a deposit dated August 27, 2019 with no corresponding collection or official receipt in the amount of ₱0.01which was deducted by the AO from her Cash Receipts Record (CRR); (3) an error in issuance of O.R. with a total amount of ₱150.00 which should have been under Fund 01-TF account; and (4)  the shortage from the 2015 cash examination in the amount of ₱0.02 which was paid and issued with O.R. No. 9514865 dated November 17, 2020.

	

	We recommended that management require the accountable officer (AO) to record properly and correctly all the above-mentioned reconciling items in order to arrive at the correct balances in her Cash Receipts Records (CRRs); restitute immediately the amount of ₱10.00 shortage; and issue official receipt for the cash overage amounting to ₱0.25.

	

	B)		Collections were not deposited intact daily or as soon as collections reached ₱10,000.00 in violation of Item 32, Chapter II of COA Memorandum No. 2013-004 or Revised Cash Examination Manual dated July 9, 2013.

	

	Item 32, Chapter II of COA Memorandum No. 2013-004 provides that:

	

	“All Collecting Officers (COs) shall deposit intact all their collections, as well as collections turned over to them by sub-collectors/tellers, with authorized government depository bank (AGDB) daily or not later the next banking day. Where collections are minimal and daily deposit thereof becomes costly and impractical, the COs shall deposit their collections at least once a week, or as soon as the collections reach ₱10,000.00. They shall record all deposits made in the CRR.”

	

	The Analyses of Collections and Deposits (Appendix E) shows that collections were not strictly deposited intact within the prescribed period. It showed that collections from a number of days were not deposited intact on its next banking day and the holding days thereof before its deposit reached five days.  This practice of not depositing the collections intact daily has resulted to an overage/shortage during the conduct of cash examination. This also caused to overlook errors in the recording of receipts and deposits in the CRR.

	

	We recommended that management require the Accountable Officer to deposit the collections intact daily or as soon as it reaches ₱10,000.00 to the authorized government depositary bank (AGDB) to protect the interest of the government.

	

	C)		Obsolete checks of various bank accounts were still in the possession of the Agency as of December 21, 2020 contrary to Section 99 of GAAM Volume I, resulting in the accumulation of useless/worthless accountable forms in the Monthly Report of Accountability.

	

Section 99 of the Government Accounting and Auditing Manual, Volume I, states that accountable officers shall submit to the COA Unit Auditor all obsolete, spoiled, and cancelled official receipts and other accountable forms for inspection and destruction. Under no circumstances shall accountable officers destroy on their own accountable forms of any description, then be relieved from responsibility.

	

Review of the monthly report of accountability of Ms. Marilou P. Jalop, the accountable officer, disclosed the following obsolete checks:

These checks cannot be used anymore for payment of government obligations because of the implementation of the new standard dorsal format for checks, thus, they are already of no use. Maintaining record and custody of these obsolete checks is an additional work to the accountable officer and they are still part of her accountability.



Until these checks be dropped from the accountability of the accountable officer, these will continue to be reported in the Monthly Report of Accountability submitted to COA.

	

We recommended that management require the accountable officer to prepare an Inventory of Obsolete Checks and submit to COA for inspection and destruction as provided in Section 99 of the Government Accounting and Auditing Manual, Volume I as the basis for dropping the obsolete checks from the Monthly Report of Accountability for Accountable forms.

	

	D)		Books of Accounts of the accountable officer and the accountant were not reconciled at least quarterly in violation of Item 6.3 of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997; thus, differences were not promptly adjusted.

	

	Item 6.3 of COA Circular No. 97-002 provides that:

	

	“xxx He shall foot and close the books at the end of each month. The accountable officer and the Accountant shall reconcile their books of accounts at least quarterly.”

	

	During the cash examination conducted last October 28, 2020, comparison of the General/Subsidiary Ledger of Cash in Bank and its corresponding Check Disbursement Record (CkDR) maintained by the accountant and the accountable officer, respectively, as of September 30, 2020 disclosed the following:

	We recommended that management require the Accountable Officer and the Accountant to reconcile their records to correct/adjust the above discrepancies and to conduct regular reconciliation of their records as required under COA Circular No. 97-002 to arrive at correct balances.

	

	E)		Unrecorded deposits/credit memos/interest income, checks issued/debit memos/tax remittances and other erroneous items were found in Check Disbursement Records (CkDR) due to non-reconciliation of accounts which resulted to unreliable balances contrary, to Section 111 and 112 of Presidential Decree No. 1445 and Government Accounting Manual (GAM).

	

	Section 111 of PD 1445 provides that in keeping of accounts:

	

1)		The accounts of an agency shall be kept in such detail as is necessary to meet the needs of the agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or control agencies of the government.

	

2)		The highest standards of honesty, objectivity and consistency shall be observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate or misleading information.

	

	Section 112 of PD 1445 further provides that each government agency shall record its financial transactions and operations conformably with generally accepted accounting principles and in accordance with pertinent laws and regulations.

	

	During our conduct of Cash Examination, we found out discrepancies between the balances per accountable officer’s records and that of the accountant’s records and Bank Statements. The following discrepancies were unrecorded deposits/credit memos/interest income and checks issued/ debit memos/tax remittances in the CkDR, to wit;

	We recommended that management require the Accountable Officer to reconcile her records with the Accountant to show and come up with reliable information on her CkDR. Moreover, she should carefully review the figures placed and computed in the CkDR to avoid erasures and errors. 

	

	F)		Unrecorded long outstanding reconciling items under the cash account per accounting books.

	

	Section 74 of P.D. No. 1445 provides that:

	

	“At the close of each month, depositories shall report to the agency head, in such form as he may direct, the condition of the agency account standing on their books. The head of the agency shall see to it that a reconciliation is made between the balance show in the reports and the balance found in the books of the agency.”

	

	Under the Government Accounting Manual, bookkeepers are required to immediately record all transactions for the day in the accounting records.

	

	Sound accounting policy dictates that the book and the bank records must be regularly reconciled to arrive at the correct and accurate balance at the end of the accounting period.

	

	Verification of the Accounting Records disclosed the following reconciling items:

	We recommended to the accountant to correct and record all reconciling items in order to disclose the correct balances in the CIB accounts.

	

	Management Comments:

	

	The management commented during the exit conference that most of the reconciling items were prior years as old as 2009. Presently with the new bookkeeper, they were able to find out and traced back a number of these items but there are still which they could not record or correct because of the inadequate supporting documents that need to be attached to the journal entry vouchers.

	

	Auditor’s Rejoinder:

	

	The team has already done the work and make a JEV based on the audit memorandum. The accountant and the accountable officer should reconcile their records. Evaluate bank accounts and close those accounts which are not anymore needed to lessen the bank reconciliation statements to be prepared.

	

6)		Stale checks totaling ₱42,564.95 were not cancelled/reverted to Cash in Bank Account after remaining outstanding for over six months from date of issue, thus understating the balance of the same and the corresponding payable account, contrary to Section 44, Chapter 6 of Government Accounting Manual Volume I.

	

	Section 44, Chapter 6 of Government Accounting Manual (GAM) Volume I provides that: 

	

	“Checks may be cancelled when they become stale, voided or spoiled. The depository bank considers a check stale, if it has been outstanding for over six months from date of issue or as prescribed.

		

		A stale, voided or spoiled check shall be marked cancelled on its face and reported as follows:

	

a)		Voided, spoiled or unclaimed stale checks with the Cashier shall be reported as cancelled in the List of Unreleased Checks that will be attached to the RCI.

b)		New checks may be issued for the replacement of stale/spoiled checks in the hands of the payees or holders in due course, upon submission of the stale/spoiled checks to the Accounting Division/Unit. A certified copy of the previously paid DVs shall be attached to the request for replacement. A JEV shall be prepared to take up the cancellation. The replacement check shall be reported in the RCI.”

	

		Review of the Bank Reconciliation Statements disclosed that as of October 28, 2020, five (5) checks with a total amount of ₱42,564.95 remained outstanding for over six months from date of issue, thus considered as stale checks pursuant to the aforementioned Section of the GAM. Since these stale checks are no longer negotiable, non-cancellation of the same understated the Cash in Bank account and the corresponding payable account(s).

7)		Cash Exam Observations on Cash and accounts of Petty Cash Fund Custodian



A)	Recording of some transactions in the different petty cash fund records were erroneously interchanged, thus, monitoring of balances are not accurate and replenishment is delayed in violation of Section 6, Chapter II of the Revised Cash Examination Manual and Section 37, GAM Vol. II.



	Section 6, Chapter II of the Revised Cash Examination Manual provides that the AO shall maintain his cashbook/CRR/CDR/CkDR and such other records or their equivalent as may be prescribed by the agency’s operating procedures, and reconcile with the accounting records at least quarterly, unless the agency requires a more frequent reconciliation.

	

	Section 37, Government Accounting Manual Vol. II states that each Petty Cash Fund Custodian shall maintain this Petty Cash Fund Record to record his/her cash advance, utilization and replenishment made and to monitor the PCF balance. All transactions for the day shall be recorded immediately.



We conducted cash examination of the petty cash fund of the accountable officer and records showed that various transactions were recorded in the incorrect PCFR such as the following:



i)	Additional Petty Cash Funds (PCF) for fuel, oil and lubricant expenses amounting to ₱40,000.00 and all fuel transactions from September 26, 2020 to October 30, 2020 were erroneously recorded in the PCFR - Other MOOE under fund 01 (see Appendix F - Analysis of Petty Cash Fund Transactions for fund 01 – Other MOOE); and



ii)	A number of transactions were incorrectly recorded in the wrong PCFR (e.g., Fund 01 transactions were recorded in the Fund 05 books and vice versa) (Appendix G - Analysis of Petty Cash Fund Transactions for fund 05 – Other MOOE).



	Further, fund 01 expense amounting to ₱1,500.00 (PR No. 906, purchase of 3 pc. Tarpaulin) was erroneously charged to fund 05 on August 30, 2019. The same amount was replenished under fund 01 per DV No. 19-12-3655 and ADA No. 20-01-010 dated January 17, 2020. In effect, the amount of PCF for Other MOOE (Fund 01) was overstated by ₱1,500.00 while understating the PCF for Other MOOE (Fund 05) by the same amount.

	

	We recommended the management to require the PCFC to observe proper recording of the transactions in the petty cash fund records for proper monitoring and accuracy of transaction and for proper reconciliation in the accounting records.

	

B)	Refund/return of unutilized amount is delayed in violation of section 4.1.3, COA Circular no. 97-002. Moreover, petty cash fund custodian is not provided with a safe thus, funds are prone to theft and misappropriation.



	Section 4.1.3 of COA Circular 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 provides that a cash advance shall be reported on as soon as the purpose for which it was given has been served.  

	

	Analysis of the account showed that the unutilized PCFs were returned/refunded to the PCF Custodian within a period of two (2) to fifty-two (52) days, as shown on the table below, which is not in accordance with the law.

	Interview with the PCFC showed that it has been a perennial problem because the payees were not returning the unutilized amount and the official receipts (ORs) immediately after the cash advance was served. In effect, the operations of the campus were hampered due to late replenishments and insufficient balance of the PCF.

	

	Further, it was also observed during the cash examination the PCF Custodian has no safe vault. The funds were just placed into three envelopes and put inside a drawer. This practice makes the funds prone to theft and misappropriations.



	We recommended that management issue a memorandum to all who uses the petty cash to immediately liquidate as soon as the purpose is served.  Moreover, provide the custodian with a safe for control and safety of the funds.



Management Comment:



The management acknowledged the recommendations and committed to strictly observe the rules and regulations on liquidating the petty cash fund.

Compliance with R.A. No. 656 or the Property Insurance Law

	

The management was compliant to Administrative Order No. 33 and COA Circular No. 92-390 to ensure that all insurable assets and properties are adequately covered/insured with the General Insurance Fund of the GSIS to properly protect the government properties in the event of serious loss such as fire, earthquake, typhoon and/or floor pursuant to the provisions of RA No. 656, the Property Insurance Law.



Senior Citizens and Differently-Abled Persons



MSU-Naawan failed to integrate in their regular activities at least one percent of their budget for plans/programs/projects that will address the concerns of senior citizens and differently-abled persons as required under Section 32 of the General Provisions of R.A. No. 11465 (GAA for CY 2020) which states that “all agencies of the government shall formulate plans, programs and projects intended to address the concerns of senior citizens and persons with disability, insofar as it relate to their mandated functions, and integrate the same in their regular activities.

STATUS OF IMPLEMENTATION OF PRIOR YEARS’ AUDIT RECOMMENDATIONS



























STATUS OF IMPLEMENTATION OF PRIOR YEARS’ AUDIT RECOMMENDATIONS



Out of 32 recommendations embodied in the prior years’ Annual Audit Report, 5 were fully implemented, 16 were partially implemented and 11 were not implemented. Details of which are shown below:



Ref.

Audit Observations

Recommendations

Status of Implementation

2019 AAR/

No. 1

Properties of the MSU- Naawan amounting to ₱58,675,867.67 were not insured with Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) contrary to Section 2 of RA 656 thus, in case of damage to or loss of, indemnification or compensation thereto is not warranted.

We recommended the management to insure with the GSIS the remaining properties amounting to ₱58,675,867.67 so that the government would be indemnified in case of damage or loss thereto.

Partially Implemented



With attached Insurance Application Letter addressed to GSIS dated February 17, 2020 for the MSUN properties amounting to ₱66,377,556.14.

2019 AAR/

No. 2

The reported balance of Petty Cash Fund (PCF) account aggregating to ₱120,000.00 is contrary to Sections 14 and 35, Chapter 6, Volume I of Government Accounting Manual (GAM), thus, resulted to a total excessive cash advances by an average amount of ₱42,639.85 per month and may be resulted also to misappropriation of funds due to delayed liquidation thereof.

We recommended the management to:



1.	Require the PCF Custodians to prepare estimates of petty expenses for one month to be approved by the head of agency (initial cash advance);

2.	Propose budget appropriation to DBM which is clear and very specific in using expenditure accounts. Other Maintenance and Operating Expense account should be used and recognized only if the expenditures do not fall under any several specific expense accounts provided in the Government Accounting Manual; and



3.	Actual expenditure should be charged against or taken from its respective authorized appropriation. In the event that a deficiency in an item of appropriation, modification of allotment should be done pursuant to Section 76 of 2019 General Appropriations Act (GAA) or National Budget Circular No. 577 dated May 2, 2019.
