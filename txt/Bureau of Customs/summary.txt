EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 

 

A. Introduction 
 

When the Ministry of Finance, now Department of Finance (DOF), was reorganized 

under Executive Order (EO) No. 127 dated  January 30, 1987, the Bureau of Customs 

(BOC), being one of the agencies under the DOF, also underwent reorganization.  EO 

No. 46, signed in  October 20, 2017, revived the Post Entry Audit Group in the BOC 

and renamed it as Post-Clearance Audit Group.  

 

The BOC is the second largest revenue collecting agency of the government after the 

Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) and is mandated with the tri-mission of revenue 

collection, trade facilitation, and trade border protection. Section 202 of the Customs 

Modernization and Tariff Act (CMTA) mandated the BOC to perform, among others, 

the followimg functions: 

 

1) Assess and collect lawful revenue; 
2) Simplify and harmonize procedures to facilitate movement of goods in 

international trade; 

3) Border control to prevent entry of smuggled goods; 
4) Prevent and suppress smuggling and other frauds; 
5) Facilitate and secure international trade and commerce through an 

informed compliance program; and 

6) Enforce this Act and all other laws, rules, and regulations related to 
customs administration. 

 

The BOC is headed by Customs Commissioner Reynaldo Leonardo B. Guerrero and 

assisted by six Deputy Commissioners and one Assistant Commissioner who 

supervise the groups as follows: Internal Administration, Assessment and Operations 

Coordinating, Revenue Collection Monitoring, Post-Clearance Audit, Intelligence, 

Enforcement, and Management Information System and Technology; and has 17 

Customs Collection Districts. As of  December 31, 2020, it has 6,285 authorized 

plantilla positions, of which a total of 3,395 was filled up, and 804 Contract of Service 

personnel.  

 

 

B. Financial Highlights 
 

The financial position, financial performance, and the sources and application of 

funds of the BOC for Calendar Year (CY) 2020, with comparative figures for CY

 The Statement of Appropriations, Allotments, Obligations, Disbursements, and 

Balances (SAAODB) as at December 31, 2020 is shown in Appendix A. 

 

 

C. Scope and Objectives of Audit 
 

The audit covered the financial audit of the accounts and operations  of the BOC for 

the year ended  December 31, 2020.  The audit was conducted to: (a) verify the level 

of assurance that maybe placed on Management’s assertions on the financial 

statements (FSs); (b) determine propriety of transactions, as well as the extent of 

compliance with pertinent laws, rules and regulations; (c) recommend agency’s 

improvement opportunities; and, (d) determine the extent of implementation of prior 

years’ audit recommendations.  

 

 

D. Audit Methodology 
 

We adopted a risk-based audit approach in the audit of the BOC’s FSs and in the 

review of compliance with laws, rules and regulations.  The Audit Team which 

carried out the audit, among others, (i) examined financial and accounting procedures 

adopted by the BOC and other relevant documentation; (ii) assessed internal controls 

regulating financial operations  and carried out compliance testing for determining 

the extent of control in operation; (iii) conducted substantive testing of a 

representative sample of selected transactions;  (iv) carried out review, on test check 

basis, of a number of contracts and transactions related to movements in balances of 

assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses; and (v) conducted interviews and held 



iii 

 

discussions with the concerned officials and staff  in the BOC- Central  and Regional 

Offices.  

 

The results of the audit were communicated to the Head of the Agency and the 

concerned officials through the issuance of Audit Observation Memoranda.   

  

 

E. Independent Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements 
 

The Auditor rendered an adverse opinion on the fairness of presentation of the BOC’s 

FSs as at December 31, 2020 in view of the unadjusted accounting errors and 

omissions amounting to P820.237 million, as well as unresolved accounting 

deficiencies, which had exceeded the materiality level of  P11.917 million  or  

6,782.91 per cent,  as discussed in  Part 1 - Independent Auditor’s Report and in  

detail in Part 2 – Observations and Recommendations  of this report. 

 

 

F. Summary of Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations  
 

Among the audit observations and corresponding recommendations discussed  in 

Part II of this report, the significant observations are summarized as follows: 

 

1. Unadjusted accounting errors amounting to P820.237 million, as well as 
unresolved accounting deficiencies which were not rectified by the Accounting 

Division had materially affected the fair presentation of the FSs for CY 2020.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accounting 

Division to effect the necessary adjustments on the errors, duly supported 

with appropriate documents, and correct the accounting deficiencies noted, 

in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Government Accounting 

Manual  for National Government Agencies. 

 

2. Unpaid duties and taxes amounting to P210.130 million arising from Post 
Modification of Single Administrative Document (PMS) for CYs 2018 to 2020, 

with computed legal interest and surcharges amounting to P63.544 million, 

remained uncollected as at December 31, 2020, depriving the government the 

much-needed funds to finance its programs and projects. 

 

We reiterated our prior years’ audit recommendations with modifications 

that Management to require the:   (a) District Collectors to ensure that 

dedicated personnel at the Port monitors all unpaid assessment/re-

assessments accounts to enable the Ports to collect all unpaid accounts;  (b)  

Liquidation and Billing Division (LBD) to designate personnel to issue 

demand letters for all entries with PMS for the collection of unpaid duties 

and taxes plus applicable interests and surcharges to the concerned 

importers;   (c) Management Information System and Technology Group to 



iv 

 

enhance the system to include a facility that would monitor the Import Entry 

Declaration status to ensure that all unpaid taxes and duties are captured by 

the Collection Districts; and,  (d)  Consider establishing a regulation on the 

collection of unpaid taxes by the Ports before release of succeeding 

importations. 

 

3. The increase in Internal Revenue Documentary Stamp (IRS) Tax was not 
immediately implemented pursuant to Sections 61 and 87 of Republic Act No. 

10963, otherwise known as the Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion 

(TRAIN) Law and Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 4-2018 which resulted in loss 

of revenue representing IRS estimated at P37.959 million 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to:  (a)  instruct the issuance of 

demand letters to concerned importers for the collection of deficient IRS 

taxes through the LBD and Collection Division,  based on the following:  (i)  

summarized list of importers with deficient IRS taxes on the  National 

Collecting Officers (NCOs) collections from the Reports of Collection and 

Deposit from January to November 2018;   (ii)  summarized list of importers 

with deficient IRS taxes for  Authorized Agent Banks (AAB) collections from 

consumption, warehousing export and transshipment entries based in E2M 

from January to November 2018; and,  (iii)  consolidated list of importers 

with deficient IRS taxes from the NCOs and AAB collections from January 

to November 2018;  (b)  require Ports not included in this observation to 

review their collections and accordingly demand payment for deficient IRS 

taxes from concerned importers;  (c)  henceforth, to immediately issue 

appropriate memorandum for guidance to concerned offices for the strict 

compliance with established regulations; and,  (d)  require concerned Port 

offices to submit to COA the documents/entries pertaining to transshipment 

and export to facilitate the review. 

 

4. Advances to Philippine International Trading Corporation (PITC) amounting 
P2.417 billion for the procurement of goods, services and infrastructure projects 

remained unliquidated for over 22 to 43 months, thus timely delivery of 

programmed projects/ activities and the purpose for engaging PITC services were 

not achieved. 

 

We reiterated our previous recommendation with modification that 

Management coordinate with PITC and submit the required Terms of 

Reference to facilitate the timely procurement of the Agency Procurement 

Requests for immediate delivery and completion of the outsourced projects 

as well as the liquidation of fund transfers. 

 

5. A total of 22,553 overstaying and abandoned containers/cargoes of various 
articles and 189 containers of perishable goods remained undisposed in various 

Ports for 2 months to 20 years as at December 31, 2020, as required under  Section 

1144 of the CMTA, BOC Unnumbered Memorandum dated August 13, 2004 and 



v 

 

Custom Memorandum Order (CMO) No. 10-2007, thus depriving the Bureau of 

additional income representing auction sales.  

 

We reiterated our recommendations with modifications and Management 

agreed to require the concerned Ports to:  (a)  conduct regular review of 

disposal proceedings and ensure that these are strictly followed and 

monitored to be able to meet defined timelines;  (b)  conduct immediate 

inspection of all overstaying containers to determine the existence, condition, 

and status of the goods inside these containers; and,  (c)  prioritize disposal 

of perishable goods to maximize revenue collection. 

 

6. Collections from cash bond for tentative release of shipment amounting to 
P274.569 million were not dispensed within the timeframe set forth under CMO 

No. 37-2001, thus depriving the importers for the immediate refund of their cash 

bond nor the government of needed revenue to fund its projects. Moreover, three 

cash bonds amounting to P1.745 million were refunded  without legal basis, thus 

propriety of the disbursement is doubtful. 

 

We reiterated our recommendations with modifications and  Management 

agreed to require  the Valuation Classification Review Committee to:  (a)  

expedite the review of all cases with tentative release in accordance with 

CMO No. 37-2001  dated December 7, 2001;  (b)  determine posted cash bond 

with cases which are already decided in favor of the government and with no 

appeal from the importer within the prescribed period and transfer the 

corresponding amount to the fund of the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr);  (c)  

prepare a monitoring schedule of cases filed as to their status and action 

taken for CYs 2005 to 2015 and implement the necessary actions based on 

the results of review;  (d)  conduct a regular review and monitoring of  the 

cash bonds and institute necessary actions for all delinquent consignee and 

thereafter remit to the BTr the amounts due to the government; and,  (e) 

submit documentation of the refunded cash bond totaling to P1.745 million 

to support validity of claim. 

 

7. The Bureau did not remit to the National Treasury trust receipts/collections of 
P1.044 billion and unexpended allocations amounting to P14.623 million as at 

December 31, 2020, thus depriving the government of the much-needed funds to 

finance government programs and projects. 

 

We reiterated our prior year recommendation that Management strictly 

adhere to the provisions of Sections 4, 7, and 10 of the General Provisions of 

the General Appropriations Act for FY 2020; EO No. 338, s. 1996; 

Permanent Committee Joint Circular No. 4-2012 dated September 11, 2012, 

implementing EO No. 431 dated May 30, 2005; and COA Circular No. 2015-

001 dated January 29, 2015, on the closure and/or remittance of all 

unnecessary special and trust funds maintained by the agencies of the 

National Government.  



vi 

 

 

8. Outstanding due and demandable bonds had accumulated to P7.189 million as at 
December 31, 2020 in view of the inability of the concerned importers to 

liquidate or cancel the  bonds and the BOC Ports to take necessary actions on 

these accounts, thus, depriving the government of additional revenue to finance 

government operations and projects. 

 

We reiterated our recommendations with modification and Management 

agreed to:  (a) facilitate the forfeiture of bonds of the Surety Companies and 

take necessary actions to collect the amounts corresponding to the duties and 

taxes guaranteed by the securities; and,  (b)  strictly follow the procedures in 

the forfeiture of bonds as provided in CMO No. 8-2007 dated April 10, 2007. 

 

The aforementioned observations and the corresponding recommendations were 

discussed with concerned BOC officials and personnel in an exit conference on May 

24, 2021. Management’s views and comments were incorporated in the report, where 

appropriate.
