OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

 

Financial Audit 

 

Accounting errors and deficiencies  

 

1. Unadjusted accounting errors amounting to P820.237 million, as well as 
unresolved accounting deficiencies had materially affected the fair presentation 

of the Financial Statements (FSs) for Calendar Year (CY) 2020  

 

A. Accounting Errors  
 

Section 15 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National 

Government Agencies (NGAs) requires the fair presentation of the financial position, 

financial performance and cash flows of an entity.  Fair presentation requires the 

faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in 

accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, 

and expenses set out in the accounting standards. 

 

Moreover, Section 111 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 requires the 

keeping of the accounts of the agency in such details as necessary to meet the needs of 

the agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish the information needed by the 

fiscal or control agencies of the government.  

 

 Audit of the agency’s financial transactions for CY 2020, however, disclosed 

accounting errors amounting to P820.237 million which were not adjusted/corrected 

by the Accounting Department, as shown in Table 1:

Section 6, Paragraph (e), Chapter 19, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs, on 

Qualitative Characteristics of Financial Reporting, requires an entity to present 

information including accounting policies in a manner that meets reliable information 

which is free from material error and bias, and can be depended on by users to represent 

faithfully that which it purports to represent or could reasonably be expected to 

represent. 
 

Audit of the accounts, likewise disclosed various accounting deficiencies that 

the Accounting Division had not rectified to establish the correct balances of the 

accounts, as enumerated in Table 2.

The uncorrected errors amounting to P820.237 million and the unresolved 

accounting deficiencies had materially affected the fair presentation of the FSs for CY 

2020. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accounting 

Division to effect the necessary adjustments on the errors, duly supported with 

appropriate documents, and correct the accounting deficiencies noted, in 

accordance with the relevant provisions of the GAM for NGAs. 

 

 

Compliance Audit 

 

Continued maintenance of unauthorized bank accounts 

 

2. The Bureau continued to maintain Cash in Bank-LCCA-Payroll Fund Account 
(LBP Current Account No. 0282-1050-63) and Cash in Bank-LCCA-PSF 

Yolanda Fund Account (LBP Current Account No. 0282-1051-87) with a balance 

of P24.814 million and P0.00 respectively, as at December 31, 2020, not in 

keeping with Section 10 of the GAA for FY 2020 (RA No. 11645), thus cash 



45 

 

remained idle in the bank depriving the government to maximize its use to 

finance other projects.  

 

Section 10 of the General Appropriations Act (GAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 

2020 (RA No. 11645) requires that departments, bureaus, offices and 

instrumentalities of the National Government (NG), including Constitutional Offices 

enjoying fiscal autonomy and State Universities and Colleges, to close and revert all 

balances of Special Accounts, Fiduciary or Trust Fund and Revolving Funds to the 

General Fund (GF) in any of the following instances: (i) when there is no legal basis 

for its creation;  (ii) when the terms have expired, or (iii) when they are no longer 

necessary for the attainment of the purposes for which said funds were established.   

 

The Cash in Bank-LCCA-Payroll Fund Account (LBP Current Account No. 

0282-1050-63) was opened on October 15, 2009 pursuant to BOC Customs 

Memorandum Order No. 36-2009 dated August 6, 2009 for the employees’ payroll 

through the Automated Teller Machine(ATM). The maintenance of the said bank 

account was allowed by the government until January 1, 2014 wherein Department 

of Budget and Management (DBM) mandated all NGAs to adopt the Expanded 

Modified Direct Payment Scheme (ExMDPs) for accounts payable due to the 

creditors/payees, thus the maintenance of the current account is no longer necessary 

considering that payments can already be made directly to the employees through 

their respective savings/ATM accounts.  

 

The BOC reverted the unutilized fund of P85 million on March 5, 2020 and 

the remaining balance of P24.814 million on January 5, 2021 in compliance with our 

recommendation. The account, however, was not yet closed in LBP South Harbor 

Branch as of December 31, 2020.  

 

On December 4, 2015, the Cash in Bank-LCCA-PSF Yolanda Fund Account 

(LBP Current Account No. 0282-1051-87) was opened to facilitate the receipt and 

distribution of the President’s Social Fund (PSF) financial assistance to 29 employees 

of the Port of Tacloban affected by Typhoon Yolanda. The said non-interest-bearing 

current account was used in CYs 2015 to 2019 until such time that fund was fully 

utilized.   

 

Both Cash in Bank accounts remained in the BOC’s books of accounts as at 

December 31, 2020 even if the purposes for which the funds were established were 

already consummated. As such, cash remained idle in the bank depriving the 

government to maximize its use to finance other projects.   

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief 

Accountant to close LBP Current Account Nos. 0282-1050-63 and 0282-1051-87 

in compliance with Section 10 of the GAA for FY 2020 (RA No. 11645).

Management Comments: 

 

The Cashier’s Office had already requested for the closing of the Yolanda 

Fund. The balance of the Payroll Fund amounting to P24.814 million was already 

remitted to the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) thru letter-request dated December 17, 

2020 which was validated by the LBP on January 5, 2021.  BOC, however, opted not 

to close the Payroll Fund account as per advice of the Branch Manager of LBP since 

all rejected payrolls debited from the MDS Account are credited to this pass thru 

account.  

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

We reiterate DBM Circular Letter No. 2013-16 dated December 23, 2013 

which prescribes the payment procedures through the ExMDPS of all NGAs for 

payroll transactions. Hence, we stand by our recommendation to close the account 

immediately. 

 

 

Unremitted Cash to the National Treasury 

 

3. The Bureau did not remit to the National Treasury trust receipts/collections of 
P1.044 billion and unexpended allocations amounting to P14.623 million as at 

December 31, 2020, thus depriving the government of the much-needed funds 

to finance government programs and projects. 

 

The following laws and regulations govern the disposition of collection and 

unnecessary special and trust funds maintained by the agencies of the NG: 

 

a) Section 4, GAA for FY 2020 (RA No. 11465), requiring the deposit of all 
fees, charges, assessment, and other receipts or revenues collected by 

agencies of the NG to the National Treasury as income of the GF pursuant 

to Section 44, Chapter 5, Book IV of Executive Order (EO) No. 292 s. 

1987 and Section 65 of PD No. 1445; 

 

Exceptions to the foregoing are receipts authorized by law to be recorded 

as Special Account in the GF, Trust Fund, or a fund other than the GF 

which shall be established in accordance with rules and regulations as may 

be issued by the Permanent Committee (PC) created under Section 45, 

Chapter 5, Book VI of EO No. 292; and other instances authorized by law;  

 

b) PC Joint Circular (JC) No. 4-2012 dated September 11, 2012, 
implementing EO No. 431 dated  May 30, 2005, which also directs the 

reversion of all dormant accounts and unnecessary special and trust funds 

to the GF; and 

  



47 

 

c) COA Circular No. 2015-001 dated January 29, 2015, prescribing the 
accounting guidelines and procedures on the reversion to the GF of said 

accounts and funds maintained by NGAs with depository banks. 

 

Review of the Cash in Bank-LCCA under Fund Cluster 07-Trust Fund 

disclosed the following fund collections and account balances as at December 31, 

2020:

Total  1,079,011,946.55 

  

Moreover, the balance of Advances for Operating Expenses (OPEX) 

amounting to P14.623 million representing unexpended fund transfers from prior 

years were also not remitted to the BTr. 

 

The funding requirements of BOC Ports were released in the form of 

advances for operating expenses to the Disbursing Officer and deposited to the LBP 

as the authorized government depository bank (AGDB). The allocated funds are used 

for the operations of the Ports for a particular year and any excess or unutilized fund 

at year-end is remitted to the BTr. 

 

Review of the Statement of Monthly Allocation and Utilization of Funds 

(SMAU) of Ports as at December 31, 2020, showed unexpended balances in the total 

amount of P14.623 million which were not remitted to the BTr as at December 31, 

2020.  The breakdown by Port is presented in Table 4.

In CY 2019, we recommended to the Bureau to deposit the amount of P1.651 

billion of the above trust receipts to the National Treasury. However only the amount 

of P306.637 million was deposited to the BTr under Trust Receipt. Management 

justified the maintenance of the remaining balances but this justification could not be 

given merit based on existing regulations, thus all idle/excess balance of the trust 

funds shown in Table 5 should be remitted to the National Treasury.

“The BOC MICP may legally continue to 

maintain the special trust accounts for trust

Tentative Release Fund in accordance with 

Section 2605 of the TCCP and RA 9135, 

respectively, subject to the oversight authority of 

the BTr on the bank accounts pursuant to EO No. 

55 (s. 2011) in relation to EO No. 449 (s. 1997) 

and EO No. 292 (s. 1987). Moreover, consistent 

with EO No. 338 (s. 1996) and the General 

Provisions of the GAA, all receipts remaining as 

well as any interest accruing to the special trust 

accounts after accomplishing the objectives and 

purposes for their constitution or the lapse of the 

fiscal year (December 31) as the case maybe, 

shall be remitted to the National Treasury.“

4. Cash Bond Fund P 437,786,628.22 Subsection h of Section 800 of the CMTA, to wit: 
 

“That the President may, upon the 

recommendation of the Secretary of Finance, 

suspend, disallow or completely withdraw, in 

whole or in part, any conditionally free 

importation under this section such as: 

 

Xxxx. 

 

(h) Personal and household effects and vehicles

Philippines, in quantities and of the kind 

necessary and suitable to the profession, rank or 

position of the person importing said items, for 

their own use and not for barter, sale or hire: 

Provided, That the Bureau may require either a 

written commitment or a security in an amount 

equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the 

ascertained duties, taxes and other charges 

thereon, upon the goods classified under this 

subsection; conditioned for the exportation 

thereof or payment of the corresponding duties, 

taxes and other charges within three (3) months 

after the expiration of their term or contract: 

Provided, however, That the Bureau may extend 

the time for exportation or payment of duties, 

taxes and other charges for a term not exceeding 

three (3) months from the expiration of the 

original period; (emphasis supplied)” 

5. Informer’s 
Reward 

14,110,492.11 Special Provisions for BOC in the GAA for FY 2020 

states that: 

 

“5. Informer's Reward. Twenty percent (20%) of 

the actual proceeds from the sale of smuggled 

and confiscated goods or collected penalties 

established by law may be given as informer's 

reward to persons instrumental in the actual 

collection of additional revenues in accordance 

with Section 1512 of R.A. No. 10863. 

 

Said amount, sourced from the proceeds of sale 

of smuggled and confiscated goods or collected 

penalties, shall be deposited with the National 

Treasury and recorded as trust receipts in 

accordance with E.O. No. 338, s. 1996.” 

Total P 1,043,994,107.02  



50 

 

The non- and/or delayed remittance to the National Treasury of the trust 

receipts, and unexpended Advances for Operating Expenses resulted in large cash 

deposited in the AGDB of the Bureau, the amounts of which could have been used 

for other priority projects of the government.  

 

It bears emphasizing that Sections 6 and 7 of the GAA for FY 2020 (RA No. 

11465) provide that disbursements or expenditures by agencies in violation of the 

said laws, rules and regulations shall be void and shall subject the erring officials and 

employees to disciplinary actions in accordance with Section 43, Chapter 5 and 

Section 80, Chapter 7, Book VI of EO No. 292 and to appropriate criminal action 

under existing penal laws. 

 

We reiterated our recommendation that Management strictly adhere to 

the provisions of Sections 4, 7, and 10 of the General Provisions of the GAA for 

FY 2020; EO No. 338, s. 1996; PC JC No. 4-2012 dated September 11, 2012, 

implementing EO No. 431 dated May 30, 2005; and COA Circular No. 2015-001 

dated January 29, 2015, on the closure and/or remittance of all unnecessary 

special and trust funds maintained by the agencies of the NG.  
 

 

Idle funds at the PS-DBM 

 

4. Fund transfers to PS-DBM totaling P59.036 million representing 
balances/savings from the procurement of non-common-used supplies remained 

idle for 2 to 6 years and were not returned/refunded by PS-DBM for eventual 

remittance to the BTr, thus depriving the government of the use of funds in the 

implementation of its projects/ programs. 

 

Section 53.5 of the Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of 

RA No. 9184 provides one of the cases wherein negotiated procurement may be 

resorted to i.e., “Agency-to-Agency” which is procurement through the Procurement 

Service – DBM (PS-DBM).   

 

Section 4.b of EO No. 359, s. of 1989, requires that government agencies shall 

remit in advance to the PS-DBM the funds needed for their requirements of supplies, 

materials, and equipment as reflected in the Work and Financial Plan. 

 

On the other hand, COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994 

provides the rules and regulations in the Grant, Utilization and Liquidation of Funds 

transferred to Implementing Agencies and requires, among others, the return to the 

Source Agency any unused balance of the funds transferred upon completion of the 

project. 

 

Pursuant to the cited provisions, BOC procured its supplies, materials and 

equipment through the PS-DBM with the preparation of an Agency Procurement 

Request (APR) together with an advance payment corresponding the amount of the 



51 

 

APR to fund the purchase. The advances made were recorded under Due from 

National Government Agencies-PS account and subject to liquidation by PS-DBM 

through delivery of goods stated in the APR.  

 

Review of the advances to PS-DBM disclosed that the accumulated 

unliquidated advances totaled P1.597 billion as at December 31, 2020. This amount 

represents APRs for the procurement of items presented in Table 6.

In CY 2020, the PS-DBM reverted a total P560.356 million to the BTr 

through cash sweep for the dormant savings/unutilized funds of various APRs of 

BOC for CYs 2013 to 2017 as support to the NG’s Bayanihan to Heal as One Act. 

We noted, however, that a total of P59.036 million representing the APRs shown in 

Table 7 were not among those reverted to the BTr. These are projects that remained 

unliquidated for 6 years or balances of APRs already delivered.

The inability of the PS-DBM to return the above-mentioned amounts or remit 

the same to the BTr is not in accordance to established rules and regulations and 

deprived the use of the needed funds for other government projects and programs 

given the limited resources available therefor.  

 

We recommended that Management require PS-DBM to refund/return 

the P59.036 million unused advances in compliance with Section 6.7 of COA 

Circular No. 94-013 and thereafter deposit the same to the BTr or remit the 

amounts directly to the BTr. 

 

Management Comments: 

 

Management has already prepared a letter-request dated May 17, 2021 to the 

PS-DBM for the reversion to the BTr of the unliquidated fund transfer amounting to 

P59.036 million. 

 

 

Unliquidated Fund Transfers/Undelivered Agency Procurement Requests (APRs) 

 

5. Advances to PITC amounting P2.417 billion for the procurement of goods, 
services and infrastructure projects remained unliquidated for over 22 to 43 

months, thus timely delivery of programmed projects/activities and the purpose 

for engaging PITC services were not achieved. 

 

Section 7.3.3 of the 2016 Revised IRR of RA No. 9184 allows agencies which 

may not have the proficiency or capability to undertake a particular procurement, as 



53 

 

determined by the head of the procuring entity concerned, to outsource the 

procurement task by, among others, requesting other government agencies to 

undertake such procurement in order to hasten project implementation, through the 

execution of a memorandum of agreement (MOA) containing specific arrangements, 

stipulations and covenants, in accordance with government budgeting, accounting, 

and auditing rules.  

 

Annex A of Article IV of the MOA between the BOC and the Philippine 

International Trading Corporation (PITC) requires the preparation of Terms of 

Reference (TOR) as one of the prerequisite requirements before the latter can proceed 

with the conduct of procurement procedures.  

 

The PITC, is a government corporation commissioned by the BOC to 

facilitate the procurement of goods, services, and infrastructure projects under MOA 

dated December 23, 2016 and December 28, 2017, in view of its inability to conduct 

biddings in the absence of a duly constituted BAC. 

 

Audit disclosed that the account Due from Government Owned or Controlled 

Corporations consists of fund transfers to the PITC for various outsourcing requests.  

As at December 31, 2020, the account has a balance of P2.363 billion.  Analysis of 

funds transferred to PITC revealed that only the amount of P235.521 million or 7.95 

per cent was liquidated representing projects completed, while the amount of 

P310.521 million or 10.48 per cent was remitted to the BTr for the unexpended 

balance or unutilized funds and savings from completed projects, leaving the balance 

of  P2.417 billion or 81.57 per cent   representing 43 uncompleted projects which are 

over 22 to 43 months unimplemented, as shown in Table 8.

Total 43 2,416,919,939.60  

 

The difference of P53.468 million between the total unliquidated as recorded 

in the books of P2.363 billion and the total actual unliquidated amount of P2.417 

billion was due to the initial recording by BOC of delivered but still unliquidated 

projects. 

 

Based on the report of PITC, the updated/revised TOR of 19 projects or 66 

per cent of  the unimplemented Projects were not yet provided by BOC, hence no 

action has been undertaken by PITC for the procurement of the projects, thus 

hampering and  delaying the implementation of the programmed projects.  

 

We reiterated our recommendation with modification that Management 

coordinate with PITC and submit the required TOR to facilitate the timely 

procurement of the APRs for immediate delivery and completion of the 

outsourced projects as well as the liquidation of fund transfers. 

 

 

Unpaid Post Modification Assessments of duties and taxes 

 

6. Unpaid duties and taxes amounting to P210.130 million arising from Post 
Modification of SAD (PMS) for CYs 2018 to 2020, with computed legal interest 

and surcharges amounting to P63.544 million, remained uncollected as at 

December 31, 2020, depriving the government the much-needed funds to 

finance its programs and projects. 

 

Customs Memorandum Order (CMO) No. 53-2010 dated December 8, 2010, 

enumerates the following provisions relating to PMS, among others: 

 

3.1.1  PMS is a process used when it is necessary to revise the 

data in the Single Administrative Document (SAD). For 

clarity, post modification of SAD includes the post 

assessment and post entry modification. Post assessment is 

the stage where the shipment is already assessed but not yet 

released from Customs. Post entry on the other hand is the 



55 

 

stage where the shipment has already been released from 

the Customs. 

 

3.1.3  Any additional duties and taxes calculated as a result of 

post assessment shall be settled in In-House Bank using the 

Cash Payment Module System in the E2M Customs System. 

 

4.1.6  If the PMS results to additional duties and taxes, the 

Importer/Customs Broker shall proceed to the In-House 

Bank to pay the additional amount indicated in the Order 

of Payment Form (OPF) prepared by the COO III and duly 

signed by the COO V of Section concerned. However, if the 

Importer/Customs Broker does not agree with the re-

assessment made, the Importer/Customs Broker may avail 

of tentative release. 

 

4.3.1  All unpaid post modified SAD/s shall be forwarded by the 

Section concerned to the Liquidation and Billing Division 

(LBD) for the preparation of demand letter for signature by 

the District Collector. 

 

4.3.2  The demand letter signed by the District Collector shall be 

forwarded to the Administrative Division, for mailing to the 

importer. 

 

Additionally, the CMTA provides the computation of interest ad surcharges 

of unpaid duties and taxes, to wit: 

 

Section 104. Unpaid duties, taxes and other charges, shall incur 

legal interest of twenty percent (20%) per annum 

computed from the date of final assessment under 

Section 429 of this Act, when payment becomes due 

and demandable. The legal interest shall likewise 

accrue on any fine or penalty imposed. 

 

Section 1425. For failure to pay the duties, taxes and other 

charges of an assessment within fifteen (15) days 

from the date of final assessment, a surcharge of ten 

per cent (10%) of the total assessed amount or 

balance thereon shall be added and collected, 

which surcharge shall be increased to twenty-five 

per cent (25%) if the delinquency lasts for more 

than one (1) year.” 

 



56 

 

We have reviewed the CYs 2018 to 2020 E2M database of post modified 

entries and found that the amount of P212.605 million remained uncollected as at 

December 31, 2020, as shown in Table 10. 

          

Table 10. Unpaid Duties and Taxes for CYs 2018-2020 

 

 

For CY 2020 unpaid duties and taxes, a confirmation was sent to the Ports for 

payments made by Importers per outstanding balance in the Management 

Information System and Technology Group (MISTG) data base as at December 31, 

2020.  Results of confirmation disclosed that as of March 31, 2021 a total of P2.474 

million was paid, thereby leaving an unpaid balance of P142.250 million. We 

calculated the corresponding interest and surcharges of the remaining balance 

including the CYs 2018 and 2019 unpaid accounts per Section 104 and 1425 of the 

CMTA, and the computation revealed that the total unpaid duties and taxes, interest 

and charges amounted to P273.674 million, as presented in Table 11.

Review of the compliance with CMO No. 53-2010 on the submission of 

unpaid post modified SADs and issuance of demand letters by the LBD to importers 

with unsettled accounts for the three major ports in NCR disclosed that demand letters 

to majority of their consignees with unpaid balances were sent. However, no follow 

through were made to ensure that importers are compelled to pay their unpaid 

balances before they are cleared on succeeding importations. 

 

The lack of a monitoring facility in the E2M system that would monitor the 

status of goods declaration had contributed to the non-payment of the PMS collectible 

and the additional interest and surcharge imposed to importers with unpaid balances. 

On the other hand, the absence of personnel in the Port operations to monitor unpaid 

assessments/re-assessments and at the LBD who should monitor the issuance of 

demand letters to importers after these are forwarded to them may further result in 

the accumulation of unpaid or uncollected revenues. 

 

These has been the Audit Team’s observation since CY 2018, but 

Management did not provide the Audit Team with existing compensating control that 

would address the collection of unpaid duties and taxes arising from PMS as at year-

end. 

 

We reiterated our recommendations with modifications that 

Management require the:  (a)  District Collectors to ensure that dedicated 

personnel at the Port monitors all unpaid assessment/re-assessments accounts to 

enable the Ports to collect all unpaid accounts;   (b)  LBD to designate personnel 

to issue demand letters for all entries with PMS for the collection of unpaid 

duties and taxes plus applicable interests and surcharges to the concerned 

importers;   (c)  MISTG to enhance the system to include a facility that would 

monitor the Import Entry Declaration (IED) status to ensure that all unpaid 

taxes and duties are captured by the Collection Districts; and (d)  Consider 

establishing a regulation on the collection of unpaid taxes by the Ports before 

release of succeeding importations. 

 

 

Uncollected Internal Revenue Documentary Stamp 

 

7. The increase in IRS Tax was not immediately implemented pursuant to Sections 
61 and 87 of RA No. 10963, otherwise known as the TRAIN Law and RR No. 4-

2018 which resulted in loss of revenue representing IRS estimated at P37.959 

million. 

 



58 

 

CMO Order No. 11-96 dated April 16, 1996 implemented Section 188 of the 

National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) of 1997 imposing that Documentary Stamp 

Tax, or Internal Revenue Documentary Stamp Tax (IRS) as referred to by BOC, 

levied on certificates or documents issued in the Bureau is at a fixed amount of 

P15.00. 

 

Section 61 of RA No. 10963 or the Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion 

(TRAIN) Law amended Section 188 of the NIRC of 1997, increasing the 

Documentary Stamp Tax rate from P15.00 to P30.00, to wit: 

 

Sec. 188. Stamp Tax on Certificates. - On each certificate of 

damage or otherwise, and on every other certificate or document 

issued by any customs officer, marine surveyor, or other person 

acting as such, and on each certificate issued by a notary public, 

and on each certificate of any description required by law or by 

rules or regulations of a public office, or which is issued for the 

purpose of giving information, or establishing proof of a fact, and 

not otherwise specified herein, there shall be collected a 

documentary stamp tax of Thirty pesos (₱30.00). 

 

Moreover, Section 87 of the TRAIN Law specifically states that the Act shall 

take effect on January 1, 2018, following its complete publication in Official Gazette 

or in at least one newspaper of general circulation. 

 

In connection thereto, the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) issued Revenue 

Regulation (RR) No. 4-2018 dated December 19, 2017, promulgating the provisions 

of Section 61, among others of the TRAIN Law, to implement the rate adjustment of 

Documentary Stamp Tax. 

 

The BOC, in compliance with the amendment of the above regulation, issued 

CMO No. 30-2019 dated June 19, 2019, for guidance in the implementation of the 

revisions specifically the increase rate of IRS.  

 

Review of the compliance of BOC with the TRAIN Law and RRs disclosed 

that the BOC Ports implemented the increased IRS rate only in November 2018 due 

to the delayed issuance of BOC Unnumbered Memorandum dated October 24, 2018 

directing all deputy commissioners, district collectors and all others concerned to 

implement the increased rate of IRS Tax under the TRAIN Law.  

 

The failure of the Ports to implement on time the increased rate of IRS 

resulted in loss of revenue, representing the difference of P15.00, for an estimated 

total of P37,959,409.50. The breakdown by Port are presented in Table 13.

The above estimated amounts are only for Ports with audit observations 

issued, thus amounts uncollected for other Ports cannot be determined. 

 

It was likewise noted that NCR entries for transshipment and export entries 

from January to November 2018 were not yet provided to the Audit Team, thus the 

total amount not collected for the said entries was not yet computed. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to:  (a)  instruct the issuance 

of demand letters to concerned importers for the collection of deficient IRS taxes 

through the LBD and Collection Division,  based on the following:  (i) 

summarized list of importers with deficient IRS taxes on the  National Collecting 

Officers (NCOs)’ collections from the Reports of Collection and Deposit from 

January to November 2018;   (ii)  summarized list of importers with deficient 

IRS taxes for  Authorized Agent Banks (AAB) collections from consumption, 

warehousing export and transshipment entries based in E2M from January to 

November 2018; and  (iii)  consolidated list of importers with deficient IRS taxes 

from the NCOs and AAB collections from January to November 2018;  (b)  

require Ports not included in this observation to review their collections and 

accordingly demand payment for deficient IRS taxes from concerned importers;  

(c)  henceforth, to immediately issue appropriate memorandum for guidance to 

concerned offices for the strict compliance with established regulations; and,   

(d)  require concerned Port offices to submit to COA the documents/entries 

pertaining to transshipment and export to facilitate the review. 

 

Management Comments: 

 

Management commented that the concerned Ports have already started the 

collection of the uncollected IRS and suggested that this be collected through the 

E2M in future importations of concerned importers to be coordinated by the Formal 

Entry Division (FED) and MISTG, which is more efficient. 

 

 

Overstaying Cargoes 

 

8. A total of 22,553 overstaying and abandoned containers/cargoes of various 
articles and 189 containers of perishable goods remained undisposed in various 

Ports for 2 months to 20 years as at December 31, 2020, not in accordance with  

the provisions of Section 1144 of the CMTA, BOC Unnumbered Memorandum 

dated August 13, 2004 and CMO No. 10-2007, thus depriving the Bureau of 

additional income representing auction sales.  



60 

 

The following sections of the CMTA provide the specific processes and 

timelines, among others, on the management and disposition of abandoned and 

perishable goods:  

 

a) Paragraph 3, Section 407, Chapter 1, Title IV on the Goods Declaration 
and Period of Filing; 

 

b) Section 1129 (b), Chapter 6, Title XI on Abandonment, which 
enumerates the kinds and effects of abandoned imported goods under 

various circumstances;  

 

c) Section 1130, Chapter 6, Title XI on the Treatment and Disposition of 
Abandoned Goods;  

 

d) Section 1144 on Disposition of Perishable Goods; and 
 

e) Section 1118 on Sale of Perishable Goods during Forfeiture Proceedings.  
 

Audit disclosed that despite the efforts of the BOC to dispose overstaying and 

abandoned containers in its premises, the cargoes listed in Table 14 had remained 

undisposed ranging from 2 months to 20 years as at December 31, 2020.

Management commented that the common reasons for failure to dispose the 

above overstaying cargoes are the following: 

 

a) Tedious process and procedures in the disposal proceedings for 
abandoned cargoes; 

 

b) Limited number of personnel in the Auction and Cargo Disposal Division 
(ACDD) to conduct inventory and appraisal of goods; and 

 

c) Limited examination area and number of personnel in the Law Division 
handling cases on the increasing number of overstayed containers, 

particularly on the seizure and abandonment of goods. 

 

It is worthy to mention that Management has significantly reduced the 

overstaying cargoes in CY 2020 in compliance with the Team’s audit 

recommendation. 

 

The inability of the Port to conduct the necessary disposal proceedings for 

overstaying containers in accordance with the CMTA due to the reasons enumerated 

above, resulted in the possible loss of government revenues representing proceeds 

from disposal or collection of assessed duties and taxes due from these cargoes. 

 

Considering the length of time that the above goods have stayed in the BOC’s 

yard, there is a risk and possibility of deterioration or spoilage and therefore unsafe 

for human consumption, and not feasible for auction, thus depriving the government 

of possible revenues. 

 

We reiterated our recommendations with modifications and 

Management agreed to require the concerned Ports to:  (a) conduct regular 

review of disposal proceedings and ensure that these are strictly followed and 

monitored to be able to meet defined timelines;  (b)  conduct immediate 

inspection of all overstaying containers to determine the existence, condition, 

and status of the goods inside these containers; and  (c)  prioritize disposal of 

perishable goods to maximize revenue collection.

Foregone Revenue 

 

9. Revenues amounting to P117.069 million were not realized due to non-
compliance with various CMTA Regulations, thus causing undue disadvantage 

to the government in terms of foregone revenues. 

 

Review of revenue transactions in CY 2020 disclosed that a total of P117.069 

million were not realized due to non-compliance by Ports with established rules in 

the CMTA and related issuances to implement the provisions for the transactions in 

Table  15.

Total P117,069,397.16  

 

The inability of Port Examiners to strictly adhere to rules and regulations to 

ensure correct assessment and payments of duties and taxes defeats the purpose for 

which these were established, thereby causing undue disadvantage to the Government 



63 

 

in terms of duties and taxes and other miscellaneous income which could have been 

generated. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to direct the concerned Ports 

and offices to strictly comply with the pertinent provisions of the CMTA and 

guidelines issued for its implementation, specifically on assessment of entries, 

and auction/disposal of goods forfeited or seized. 

 

 

Incomplete documentation of importations 

 

10. Importations of 246 regulated commodities costing P394.009 million were 
processed and released despite the lack of the import permits and other 

supporting documents required under Section 117 of the CMTA and other 

relevant laws, rules and regulations implementing the CMTA, thus defeating 

the purpose for which these rules and regulations were established.  

 

Section 117, Chapter 3, Title I of RA No. 10863 or the CMTA states that 

“Goods which are subject to regulation shall be imported or exported only after 

securing the necessary goods declaration or export declaration, clearances, licenses, 

and any other requirements, prior to importation or exportation. In case of 

importation, submission of requirements after arrival of the goods but prior to 

release from customs custody shall be allowed but only in cases provided for by 

governing laws or regulations.” 

 

In addition, Sections B.2, B6, and B8 of CMO 9-2015 dated April 10, 2015 

provides for the following: 

 

B.2 All Bureau of Customs assessment and operations staff 

processing consumption, warehousing, and transshipment entries 

containing any product in the Regulated Imports List, including those 

destined for PEZA zones and freeports, must verify whether the 

required import permits were issued and submitted to the Bureau of 

Customs, prior to their final assessment. In the case of 

transshipments, the permits must be obtained, and a copy provided 

to the Bureau of Customs, prior to transshipment from the port of 

discharge. 

 

B.6. Importers and brokers are strongly urged to acquire the 

necessary import permits for products in the Regulated Imports List 

prior to the scheduled arrival of their imports in the Philippines. 

Failure to present the necessary import permits within the time 

frames for filing of entry (30 days after date of last discharge of the 

last package) or claiming of importation (15 days after filing of 

entry) shall not be grounds for extension of the periods after which a 



64 

 

shipment shall be deemed abandoned, nor be accepted as a 

justification for lifting of abandonment. 

 

B.8. Non-compliance by any Customs official with any section of this 

CMO, except for Section B.3, will be an incidence of Simple Neglect 

of Duty as used in CMO 25-1010, Title IV, Section 2, and shall be 

punishable upon second offense by Dismissal. 

 

CMC No. 54-2014 dated April 11, 2014, duly provides the specific 

documents and additional documents to be submitted by the importer upon 

importation of regulated commodities under the jurisdiction of the Food and Drug 

Administration (FDA) such as the License to Operate (LTO) and the Certificate of 

Product Registration (CPR).  

 

Section II, Subsection 5 of Risk Management Office (RMO) No. 14-2014 

dated March 5, 2014 prescribes that an electronic Authority to Release Imported 

Goods (e- ATRIG) be issued on imported articles subject to excise taxes, to wit: 

 

5. The eATRIG shall be issued for all importations subject to excise 

tax, including the raw materials in the production thereof, as well as 

the machineries, equipment, apparatus or any mechanical 

contrivances especially used for its assembly/production; 

 

Review of the sample Goods Declarations submitted to two Ports revealed 

that importations of regulated commodities with total assessed and paid duties and 

taxes amounting to P394.009 million were processed by the ports despite the absence 

of the required permits, licenses and clearances as provided in the above provisions, 

as summarized in Table 16.

While the non-submission of the required documents for the 246 regulated 

importations by the importers has not significantly affected the Assessment of the 

Duties and Taxes, the processing and release by the Port Officials without the 

necessary documentation defeats the purpose for which the above regulations were 

established. 



65 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Ports to 

strictly enforce compliance with Section 117 of the CMTA and other relevant 

laws, rules and regulations to ensure that all required permits/ 

clearances/certifications and other necessary supporting documents are 

complete and submitted prior to assessment and release of the goods imported. 

 

 

Unreleased/not forfeited cash bonds 

 

11. Collections from cash bond for tentative release of shipment amounting to 
P274.570 million were not dispensed within the timeframe set forth under CMO 

No. 37-2001, thus depriving the importers for the immediate refund of their cash 

bond and the government of needed revenue to fund its projects. Moreover, 

three cash bonds amounting to P1.745 million were refunded without legal basis, 

thus propriety of the disbursement is doubtful.  

 

Section 425 of the CMTA provides for Tentative Assessment of Goods 

Subject to Dispute Settlement, as quoted below: 

 

Assessment shall be deemed tentative if the duties initially assessed 

are disputed by the importer. Xxx 

 

The District Collector may allow the release of the imported goods 

under tentative assessment upon the posting of sufficient security to 

cover the applicable duties and taxes equivalent to the amount that 

is disputed. 

 

Moreover, CMO No. 37-2001 provides, among others, that cases referred to 

the Valuation and Classification Review Committee (VCRC) shall entitle the 

importer to tentative release of the concerned shipment upon posting of sufficient 

guarantee in the form of cash, manager’s check, bank guaranty, or surety bond or 

other alternative form of guarantee allowed under the law and the regulations which 

shall suffice to secure recovery in the event of a customs decision adverse to the 

importer. If no tentative release is availed of, the Head, VCRC-Technical Supporting 

Team shall immediately calendar the case for VCRC deliberation. Cases referred to 

the VCRC shall be resolved within 20 working days from the date the same is 

calendared. The signed VCRC decision shall be the basis for implementation within 

the same day the signed decision is made.  

 

Records showed that collections from cash bonds for tentative release of 

shipment of the two Ports listed in Table 17 were not dispensed within the timeframe 

set in the regulation due to the absence of a monitoring schedule of cases referred to 

VCRC regarding their status.

MICP P185,635,139.90  371 cash bonds totaling P123,473,348.67 remained dormant

 P62,161,791.23 deposited to the BOC Trust Fund  and dormant

NAIA 88,934,802.75  11 cash bonds totaling to P3,708,318.07 already expired but 
not remitted to the GF  

 3 cash bonds amounting to P1,744,653.64 were refunded    
without legal basis  

Total P274,569,942.65  

 

The inability of the Port to act on the cases for resolution within the period 

prescribed under CMO No. 37-2001 deprived the importer from the immediate refund 

of their bonds nor the government to generate revenue therefrom, as the case maybe. 

Moreover, the refund of cash bonds amounting to P1.745 million without legal basis   

is not in accordance with Section 4 of PD No. 1445 which states that “Trust Funds 

shall be available and may be spent only for the specific purpose for which the trust 

was created or the funds received”.   
 

We reiterated our recommendations with modifications and  

Management agreed to require the VCRC to:  (a)  expedite the review of all cases 

with tentative release in accordance with CMO No. 37-2001  dated December 7, 

2001;    (b)  determine posted cash bond with cases which are already decided in 

favor of the government and with no appeal from the importer within the 

prescribed period and transfer the corresponding amount to the fund of the 

BTr;  (c)  prepare a monitoring schedule of cases filed as to their status and 

action taken for CYs 2005 to 2015 and implement the necessary actions based 

on the results of review;  (d)  conduct a regular review and monitoring of  the 

cash bonds and institute necessary actions for all delinquent consignee and 

thereafter remit to the BTr the amounts due to the government; and   (e)  submit 

documentation of the refunded cash bond totaling to P1.745 million to support 

validity of claim. 

 

 

Non-forfeiture of expired cash bonds 

 

12. Collections amounting to P53.370 million representing cash bond for items of 
goods/articles posted by travelers, tourist, foreign consultants and experts hired 

by and/or rendering service to the government, for the purpose of being 

exempted from payment of import duties upon compliance with the 

requirements provided under Sub-section (h), Section 800, Chapter 1, Title VIII 

of the CMTA, remained outstanding for one to more than 15 years as at 

December 31, 2020 due to inability to conduct forfeiture proceedings even after 

the lapse of the prescribed period set in the CMTA.  

 



67 

 

Sub-section (h), Section 800, Chapter 1 Title VIII of the CMTA on 

Conditionally Tax and/or Duty-Exempt Importation states that:   

 

“The following goods shall be exempt from the payment of import 

duties upon compliance with the formalities prescribed in the 

regulations which shall be promulgated by the Commissioner with 

the approval of the Secretary of Finance. 

  

Personal and household effects and vehicles belonging to foreign 

consultants and experts hired by, or rendering service to the 

government, and their staff or personnel and families accompanying 

them or arriving within a reasonable time before or after their arrival 

in the Philippines, in quantities and of the kind necessary and 

suitable to the profession, rank or position of the person importing 

said items, for their own use and not for barter, sale or hire: 

Provided, That the Bureau may require either a written commitment 

or a security in an amount equal to one hundred percent (100%) of 

the ascertained duties, taxes and other charges thereon, upon the 

goods classified under this subsection; conditioned for the 

exportation thereof or payment of the corresponding duties, taxes 

and other charges within three (3) months after the expiration of 

their term or contract: Provided, however, That the Bureau may 

extend the time for exportation or payment of duties, taxes and other 

charges for a term not exceeding three (3) months from the 

expiration of the original period;” (Emphasis supplied) 

 

Records showed that a total cash bond of P53.556 million were posted by 319 

individuals who were travelers, tourists, foreign consultants and experts hired by 

and/or rendering service to the government, purposely for the exemption from 

payment of duties on their imported goods/items upon compliance with the above 

provisions. 

 

As at December 31, 2020, collections amounting to P2.609 million were 

deposited to the BOC Trust Fund Account No. 1852-1000-75 maintained at the LBP, 

MICP Branch which covered cash bonds posted from CYs 2015 to 2020 while 

P50.947 million were remitted to the BTr under the Trust Account of the BOC which 

pertained to cash bonds collected from CYs 2005 to 2014. 

 

Further verification disclosed that of the total cash bonds of P53.556 million, 

the amount of P53.370 million or 99.65 per cent remained idle/dormant for a period 

ranging from one to more than 15 years wherein the probability or interest of the 

claimant to refund the same is remote. The details are shown in Table 18.

It is worthy to note that the Informal Entry Division issued a memorandum 

for the District Collector Office and the Law Division recommending the remittance 

of the expired cash bonds amounting to P1.103 million which covered the period 

from CYs 2013 to 2019, but no document was yet submitted to the Audit Team as 

evidence to this compliance. 

 

Considering the time that has elapsed within which the concerned importers 

to comply with the regulation for the release of the cash bond and it appearing that 

they are not interested or have condoned their claim, the cash bonds should be 

forfeited in favor of the government and remitted to the GF of the BTr unrestricted 

for use of the government for its projects.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to conduct forfeiture 

proceeding for the cash bond for failure to comply within the time prescribed 

pursuant to Section 800 of the CMTA and thereafter remit to the BTr the 

amount of cash bonds that had expired for 6 months and above.   

 

 

Importations released with insufficient security bond 

 

13. Ninety-nine entries with tentative assessment subject to dispute settlement were 
released at POM and Harbour Center, despite the absence of sufficient posted 

security in the amount of P225.731 million, contrary to the provisions of Section 

425 of the CMTA, thus the government’s interest was not secured and 



69 

 

protected, posing risk of non-recovery of duties and taxes due and possible loss 

of revenue to the disadvantage of the government. 

 

 Section 425 of the CMTA provides for the tentative assessment of goods 

subject to dispute settlement. It specified that the assessment shall be deemed 

tentative if the duties and taxes initially assessed are disputed by the importer. The 

assessment shall be completed upon final readjustment based on the tariff ruling in 

case of classification dispute, or the final resolution of the protest case involving 

valuation, rules of origin, and other customs issues. The District Collector may allow 

the release of the imported goods under tentative assessment upon the posting of 

sufficient security to cover the applicable duties and taxes equivalent to the amount 

that is disputed.  

 

 Various customs memoranda specified that a VCRC was established in 

every Port to handle cases on dispute settlement. Dispute settlement may arise from: 

 

 Tariff classification or issues that arise when the Customs Officer raise 
a question on the correctness of the declared tariff classification and 

reclassifies the goods, with which reclassification the importer or 

exporter does not agree; 

 Customs valuation or issues that arise when the Customs Officer 
challenges the customs value declared in the goods declaration and 

makes his own valuation findings, to which the importer does not agree; 

 Rules of origin or issues that arise when in case of imported goods, 
where the Bureau challenges the authenticity or veracity of the 

Certificate of Origin or the matter of whether the imported goods are 

originating or not from the alleged country of origin; 

 Other customs issues; and  

 Mixed issues of above.   
 

 CMO No. 37-2001 dated December 7, 2001 requires that cases referred to 

VCRC shall entitle the importer to the tentative release of the concerned shipment 

upon posting of sufficient guarantee to secure recovery in the event of a customs 

decision adverse to the importer. 

 

 Verification of 211 entries in CY 2020 involving iron and steel, motor 

vehicles and rice commodities showed that 99 had disputed amount of P231.918 

million as reported by the VCRC but were allowed to be released despite the absence 

of or insufficient posted security amounting to P225.731 million, as shown in Table 

19.

The objective of posting sufficient security for entries released under tentative 

assessment subject to dispute settlement is to ensure the payment of duties and taxes 

and other obligations to BOC in case of adverse decision on the importer. The posting 

of security protects and relieves the Bureau from risk of non-payment of duties and 

taxes specifically since the shipments were already released from customs custody. 

Absence of such means the government’s interest is not secured thus, poses risk of 

non-recovery of duties and taxes due and eventually, possible loss of revenue to the 

disadvantage of the government.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Ports to:  (a) 

strictly comply with the provisions of CMO No. 37-2001 dated December 7, 2001 

on the release of entries under tentative assessment subject to dispute settlement 

in the absence of sufficient posted security; and (b) require the importers of the 

99 entries to post the required security to cover the duties and taxes which is 

equivalent to the amount disputed and submit proof of compliance to the Audit 

Team. 

 

 

Uncollected outstanding due and demandable bonds  

 

14. Outstanding due and demandable bonds had accumulated to P7.189 billion as 
at December 31, 2020 in view of the inability of the concerned importers to 

liquidate or cancel the bonds and the BOC Ports to take necessary actions on 

these accounts, thus, depriving the government of additional revenue to finance 

government operations and projects. 

 

Surety Bond is a form of security/guaranty that ensures the satisfaction/ 

fulfillment of an obligation to the BOC. To guarantee the payment of duties and taxes 

and other obligations to the Bureau, the District Collector shall require the importer 

to post security under the following transactions:  

 

a) Release of Shipment under Provisional Declaration;  
b) Release of Goods subject to Dispute Settlement;  
c) Release of Shipment pending Laboratory Analysis;  
d) Express Consignment;  
e) Shipment under Warehousing Entries;  



71 

 

f) Transit of Goods to Free Zone Locators;  
g) Carrier's Security;  
h) Transit of Goods under Co-loading Act;  
i) Release of Goods pending Ascertainment of the Accuracy of the Declared 

Value;  

j) Release of Conditionally Tax and/or Duty-Free Importations; and  
k) Conditional Release of Shipments Arriving in Advance  

 

CMO No. 8-2007 dated April 10, 2007 prescribes the procedures to be 

undertaken in the forfeiture of bonds which states, among others, that upon failure to 

settle the bonded obligations, the Chief of the Bonds Division or its equivalent unit, 

thru the District Collector concerned, shall submit to the Commissioner of Customs 

(thru the Director of Legal Service) the list of principal and surety and bonding 

company with outstanding matured and expired bonds and recommend the immediate 

issuance of the order of forfeiture of the bonds.  

 

As at December 31, 2020, the Bureau had a consolidated balance of due and 

demandable bonds amounting to P7.189 billion, with the breakdown by Port 

presented in Table 20. 

 
Table 20. Outstanding Due and Demandable Bonds 

Port Amount  

POM  P 4,308,675,001.64

San Fernando 4,226,433.00 

Subic 48,168,436.98 

Total P7,188,783,600.66 

 

In CY 2019, we noted that outstanding due and demandable bonds amounted 

to P6.688 billion. It can be gleaned from the balances as at December 31, 2020, that 

the amount increased by P500.605 million or 7.48 per cent due to new security bonds 

provided.  The Bureau had also filed cases for the collection of the outstanding bonds 

amounting to P2.221 billion or 30.90 per cent pertaining to 21 surety companies while 

7 cases against the surety companies were already dismissed. The collectability of 

the surety bonds is not guaranteed since civil cases filed are still ongoing and 

dismissed, while others had prescribed due to late filing of actions in court. 

 

It was likewise noted that outstanding bonds of P2.665 billion had already 

expired and subject to renewal but Management has not issued collection and renewal 

letters to concerned surety companies to demand liquidation or cancellation of the 

bond as the case maybe. 

 



72 

 

The inability of the BOC to collect the amount of due and demandable bonds 

and institute necessary action caused undue disadvantage to the government in the 

form of additional revenues from importations. 

We reiterated our recommendations with modification and   

Management agreed to:  (a) facilitate the forfeiture of bonds of the Surety 

Companies and take necessary actions to collect the amounts corresponding to 

the duties and taxes guaranteed by the securities; and   (b) strictly follow the 

procedures in the forfeiture of bonds as provided in CMO No. 8-2007 dated 

April 10, 2007. 

 

 

Internal Control Deficiencies 

 

15. Supporting documents and reportorial requirements as attachment to the Gate 
Passes for the Disposal of Goods at POM, were not submitted on time, thus, risk 

controls necessary to ensure regularity of the condemnation process undertaken 

by the contractors were bypassed and not fully applied, which runs counter to   

pertinent provisions of CAO No. 03-2020 dated January 8, 2020. 

 

a) Gate Passes of goods for condemnation were not supported with required 
documentation such as: (i) inventory and examination report; and (ii) copy 

of Final Order of Forfeiture or Decree of Abandonment, before the release 

and actual conduct of condemnation. 

 

CAO No. 03-2020 dated  January 8, 2020 governs the Disposition of Seized, 

Abandoned and Forfeited Goods in Customs Custody and implements Sections 1118 

and 1139 to 1151 of Chapter 10, Title XI and other related provisions of RA No. 

10863, otherwise known as the CMTA, and RA No. 10845, otherwise known as the 

“Anti-Agricultural Smuggling Act of 2016”.  

 

Section 9 of the aforementioned CAO specifically deals with the procedures 

on the disposal of goods through Condemnation, including the required supporting 

documents and reportorial requirements to be attached and submitted before and after 

the conduct of the condemnation/destruction.   It provides that upon receipt of the 

notice of finality of Order of Forfeiture or Decree of Abandonment, a detailed 

condemnation plan shall be prepared by the ACDD or equivalent unit of the Port, for 

the destruction or condemnation of the goods identified for destruction. 

 

Moreover, the Condemnation Committee shall prepare the Order of 

Condemnation for the approval of the District Collector and shall contain the mode 

of condemnation, nature of the items or goods to be destroyed or condemned, Final 

Order of Forfeiture or Abandonment and the legal basis or justification for the 

condemnation of the goods. Such documents are vital and essential in ascertaining 

the particular and specific cargoes and containers to be released and ensure that only 

identified goods are allowed to be pulled out of the Bureau’s custody. 

 



73 

 

Evaluation of the Gate Passes for Disposal through Condemnation for the 

period January 1 to December 31, 2020 revealed that there were 48 gate passes 

submitted to the Audit Team with lacking supporting documents, such as the 

documents shown in Table 21.

Management’s lapses to provide the complete supporting documents and 

reportorial requirements defeat the purpose for which the controls were established, 

that is to ensure that documentation, procedures and processes were undertaken to 

guarantee that only the identified, authorized and verified goods for condemnation 

are released and disposed appropriately.  

 

We recommended that Management require the concerned ACDD 

personnel to attach all required supporting documents to Gate Passes before the 

release of Goods for Condemnation to ensure that established controls are 

implemented for operational efficiency.  

 

Management Comments: 

 

Management reasoned that the inconsistent compliance with the proper 

documentation of gate passes covering the condemnable goods was partly due to the 

difficulties encountered during the Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) and the 

compliance of the marching order of the Management to ensure unhampered releases 

of all containerized goods during ECQ in view of JAO No. 20-01, the Office have 

been double timing the disposal of overstaying goods. Compounded by the fact that 

majority of Bureau personnel were working from home, the covering documentation 

for certain releases were not efficiently made. Nonetheless, Management assured that 

releases and disposal were all duly witnessed by other concerned offices and the 

ACDD are now requiring all concerned to submit a detailed completion report on a 

per container basis.  Management further commented that in the absence of a CMO 

to fully implement CAO No. 03-2020, POM will develop a template for the 

Completion Report for uniformity in reporting. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

The said regulations were established to ensure that controls are implemented 

for operational efficiency and avoid possible corrupt practices, thus we maintain our 



74 

 

recommendation on strict compliance with condemnation laws, rules and regulations 

promulgated by the Bureau.  

 

b) A total of 32 detailed Completion Reports for condemnations conducted 
were not prepared/attached to reports of disposal through condemnation 

submitted to the Audit Team for review. 
 

Section 9.9 of CAO No. 03-2020 further mandates the accredited contractor 

to submit to the District Collector, a completion report after every condemnation. 

Likewise, pursuant to BOC Memorandum dated October 14, 1993 and No. 4 of the 

Detailed Written Plan of Condemnation, the Condemnation Committee shall cause 

the preparation of a Report, once the condemnation has been completed. It is worthy 

to note that, the Memorandum, in the interim, provided for a period of 15 calendar 

days from the date of issuance of the same, to submit complete or partial reports of 

condemnation. However, with the implementation of CAO No. 03-2020, the specific 

period for the submission of the completion reports was not set. 

 

Evaluation of the completeness of supporting documents for disposal 

activities undertaken by the POM revealed that a total of 32 Contractor’s Completion 

Reports and 42 Condemnation Committee Completion Reports were not attached or 

submitted to the Audit Team for review.  

 

Likewise, we noted that the Completion Reports submitted by the Contractors 

did not accurately describe what transpired during the condemnation proper for each 

day of destruction until completed, for goods that are not fully disposed/condemned 

in a day. (i.e., some reports only indicated the date when the condemnation started 

and ended but did not provide details as to what containers were condemned and the 

mode used). On the other hand, the Completion Reports prepared by the 

Condemnation Committee provided only the date of release from the BOC custody 

and facility but not as to the conduct of the condemnation proper. 

 

Moreover, the CAO does not provide a standard format for the preparation of 

the completion reports to ensure that all necessary information are captured for 

monitoring and evaluation purposes.  

 

The non-submission by the Condemnation Committee and Contractors of the 

required completion reports deprived Management of the immediate review of 

operational efficiency and likewise posed risk of untimely determination of possible 

irregularity in the conduct of condemnation that would serve as guide in its decisions 

and appropriate actions to be taken to address the risk.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to:  (a)  ensure strict 

compliance with the provisions of CAO No. 03-2020 on the submission by the 

contractor and the Condemnation Committee of the completion reports 

indicating therein relevant details of the process; and  (b)  revisit/review the 

regulation and consider prescribing a standard format, for uniformity, in the 



75 

 

preparation of the Completion Reports to be used by the contractors and 

Condemnation Committee to ensure that all important information and data 

are captured for operational efficiency. 

Management Comments: 

 

Management commented that in the absence of a CMO to fully implement 

CAO No. 03-2020, the Port will develop a template for the Completion Report for 

uniformity in reporting. 

 

 

16. The POM had not fully observed the procedures prescribed under CAO No. 03-
2020 on the accreditation of Waste Disposal Contractors, thus exposing the 

Bureau to undue disadvantage, such as but not limited to: (a) risk that the Port 

will not be compensated accordingly for non-compliance of contractor, (b) 

capability of contractor to carry out the contract not ascertained, and (c) loss of 

additional income amounting to P20,530.00, representing accreditation fees and 

customs documentary stamps.   

 

a) The Port granted accreditation to 12 Waste Disposal Contractors despite the 
non-posting of the annual performance bond of P500,000.00 as required 

under Section 9.7.16 of CAO No. 03-2020.  

 

Section 9 of CAO No. 03-2020 dated January 8, 2020 enumerates the 

documentary requirements that should be complied with by a contractor as pre-

requisite for the approval of the application for accreditation. Specifically, Section 

9.7.16 provides the mandatory posting of annual performance bond in the amount of 

P0.500 million by the contractor prior to the approval of accreditation to ensure 

satisfactory discharge of its services. 

 

The Condemnation Committee shall evaluate the application for accreditation 

of contractors upon submission of the documentary requirements and the payment of 

the accreditation fee, customs documentary stamps and performance bond. Disposal 

through condemnation shall be done only by contractors duly accredited and with 

sufficient facility or equipment or machineries to perform condemnation.  

 

Confirmation with the Bonds Division, however, revealed that none of the 12 

Service Providers/Waste Disposal Contractors accredited by the Port in CYs 2020 

had posted the required performance bond.  The details are shown in Table 22.

The non-adherence to the required posting of bond by the contractors may 

pose risk of non-compliance with contract agreement, hence the Port will not be 

compensated accordingly.  

 

We recommended that Management require the concerned active 

contractors to:  (a) immediately post the required performance bond; and (b) 

henceforth, strictly comply with the mandatory posting of performance bond in 

the amount of P0.500 million in accordance with Section 9.7.16 of CAO No. 03-

2020, before the approval of the application for accreditation as service 

provider/waste disposal contractor.   

 

Management Comments: 

Management claimed that the mandatory posting of bond amounting to 

P0.500 million is not yet implemented by the POM, or to any other Ports and justified 

that while it is true that CAO No. 03-2020 provides for accreditation of contractors, 

the same needs a Customs Memorandum to further implement the same. 

Management further averred that CAO No. 03-2020 is the final BOC issuance 

dealing on accreditation of contractors for condemnation, thus detailed procedures 

and guidelines need to be issued for uniform implementation. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

We maintain our recommendation for Management to implement the 

mandatory posting of the performance bond in the amount of P0.500 million in 

accordance with Section 9.7.16 of CAO No. 03-2020, before the approval of the 

application for accreditation as service provider/waste disposal contractor. No other 

issuance is needed as the CAO is self-explanatory as regards safeguarding the Bureau 

from non-compliance by the contractors with agreements.  

 
b) Three contractors with approved provisional accreditation, had not 

complied with the submission of updated documentary requirements 

pursuant to Section 9.7 of CAO No. 03-2020, as at December 31, 2020. 

 

Section 9.7 of CAO No. 03-2020 January 8, 2020 provides that interested 

contractors shall be accredited by the District Collector of a port, which shall be valid 



77 

 

within three years from the date of accreditation, subject to the annual submission of 

updated documents. The Applicant shall submit to the Accreditation Committee of 

the Port the requirements enumerated therein. 

 

Evaluation of the List of Accredited Contractors submitted by the ACDD 

revealed that there were three contractors that were granted provisional accreditation. 

However, as at December 31, 2020, these contractors remained non-compliant with 

the lacking documentary requirements. The details are presented in Table 23.

3. EcosafeAgro Products Manufacturing 06/11/2020 3 Mayor’s Permit 

Total 19  

 

The non-compliance by the contractors with the submission of the required 

documentary requirements for accreditation prevented the Port from fully evaluating 

the applicant’s capacity to carry out the assigned task of condemnation.  

 

We recommended that Management require the concerned contractors 

to submit the lacking documents and immediately revoke their accreditation in 

case of non-submission within the timeframe set. 

 

Management Comments: 

 

Management commented that the approval of the provisional accreditation of 

the three contractors, although lacking one document each, was made to compensate 

the number of available contractors at the POM during the period of ECQ.  These 

contractors have already submitted their lacking documents and are thus fully 

compliant. 

 
c) Two Waste Disposal Contractors were allowed to perform Condemnation 

despite non-renewal of accreditations beyond three years, contrary to the 

provisions of Section 9.7 of CAO No. 03-2020.  

 

Section 9.7 of CAO No. 03-2020 dated January 8, 2020 provides, among 

others, that interested contractors shall be accredited by the District Collector of a 

Port, which shall be valid within three years from the date of accreditation, subject 

to the annual submission of updated documents.  

 

Further verification of the List of Accredited Waste Disposal Contractors 

submitted by the ACDD revealed that there were two contractors that were allowed 



78 

 

to dispose cargoes, even if their accreditation was already beyond the three-year 

period provided under the CAO. The details are shown in Table 24.

2. Green Resource 9/1/2016 00015145 03/02/2020 

 

Interview/inquiry with concerned personnel at the ACDD disclosed that the 

accreditations of the above-mentioned contractors did not have expiration date for 

their accreditation. It was mentioned that the approving officer has the discretion to 

grant validity beyond the three-year period which is in violation of the provision 

prescribed under CAO No. 03-2020. 

 

The non-renewal of accreditation likewise deprived the BOC/government the 

total amount of P20,530.00, representing income from accreditation fees and customs 

documentary stamps. 

 

We recommended that Management strictly enforce the provision and 

comply with the procedures prescribed under CAO No. 03-2020 on the 

accreditation of contractors. 

 

We likewise recommended that Management collect the accreditation fee 

from both contractors pursuant to Section 9.7 of CAO No. 03-2020 dated  

January 8, 2020. 

 

Management Comments: 

 

Management explained that Tritek Reverse Logistics Corporation and Green 

Resource were accredited prior to issuance of CAO No. 03-2020, thus, no validity 

period on their accreditation were specified and made and informed that both are not 

active facilities anymore. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

We maintain our recommendation that Management comply with established 

rules and controls to promote operational efficiency. 

 

 



79 

 

17. A total of 2,083 importations processed at the POM and Harbour Centre Port 
Terminal Inc. with general/generic descriptions, assessed at an aggregate 

amount of P484.106 million had inappropriate selectivity tagging and were not 

subjected to 100 per cent examination for the period January 2019 to June 2020, 

inconsistent with  the provisions of CAO No. 8-2007 and CMO No. 28-2007. This 

deficiency caused difficulty in undertaking appropriate customs valuation, 

tariff classification, and posed risk of misdeclaration/undervaluation of goods 

to the disadvantage of the government.  

 

Section 413 of the CMTA or RA No. 10863 provides that under such terms and 

conditions prescribed under the rules and regulations, the description of the goods 

declaration must be sufficient and specific in detail to enable the goods to be 

identified for customs valuation, statistical purposes, and classification to the 

appropriate tariff heading and subheading in the currency of the invoice, and in such 

other particulars necessary for the proper assessment and collection of duties and 

taxes. 

 

Pursuant thereto, CAO No. 8-2007 dated September 8, 2007 and CMO No. 28-

2007 dated October 2, 2007 were issued to set forth and implement the criteria and 

convention to be observed in the proper description of imported goods declaration 

for valuation, classification and statistical purposes. The provisions/regulations 

indicated therein were consistently reiterated by BOC through Unnumbered 

Memoranda of various dates from CY 2015 to December 31, 2020, to enforce and 

ensure strict compliance thereof. 

 

Section VI of the said regulations state that the goods declared in a general 

manner shall undergo 100 per cent examination and are to be considered in a status 

of continuing alert. Annex A of the aforementioned Orders identified the preliminary 

list of 120 generally described goods which are subject to 100 per cent examination. 

Based on the current selectivity system of the BOC during the period January 2019 

to June 2020, those entries that required documentary check and physical 

examination were tagged as “red”. 

  

Furthermore, BOC OCOM Memorandum No. 139-2020 dated July 8, 2020 

requires that it shall be the responsibility of the Customs Broker together with the 

Chief, Entry Processing Division/Unit (EPD/EPU), Customs Operations Officer 

(COO) III/COO V to ensure the proper implementation of the said Orders. 

 

Failure to comply with the said regulations shall be penalized in the following 

manner: 

 

a) First Offense - Warning 
b) Second Offense - Suspension of accreditation of six (6) months 
c) Third Offense - Cancellation of accreditation and blacklisting as an 

importer 

  



80 

 

Review and verification of the consumption entries facilitated by the E2M for 

the period January 2019 to June 2020 entered through formal entry process at the 

BOC-POM, Harbour Centre and Port of Masinloc database disclosed that: 

 

a) A total of 2,083 importations with an aggregate assessment of P484.106 
million were declared in a general manner and details were not sufficient 

and specific. The said importations did not indicate the specific 

description, brand, model/style, capacity/quality/grade/ process and 

retail packaging, but were inappropriately tagged as green and yellow 

by the selectivity system. These involved 336 importers and 283 brokers 

with recorded cases of abandonment and seizure due to 

misdeclaration/undervaluation in CYs 2019 and 2020, as summarized in 

Table 25.

b) There were 237 importers and 208 brokers who are violators but not 
penalized or blacklisted, remained in active status and continuously 

transact with the BOC.  

 

Records likewise showed that violations ranged from one to as high as 261 

recurring transactions for a single importer for the period January 2019 to June 2020 

but Management had not taken actions to penalize the violators in accordance with 

regulations.  

 

The above deficiencies may cause difficulty for appropriate customs 

valuation and classification and suppress the efforts of the BOC in the establishment 

and/or publication of values for statistical purposes as evidenced by the Post 

Modification Assessments amounting to P23.939 million for the subject 

importations.  

 

The non-compliance by these concerned importers and brokers with the 

provisions of CAO No. 8-2007 and CMO No. 28-2007 and not subjecting these 

generally described importations to 100 per cent examination posed difficulty in the 

conduct of evaluation and assessment as well as validation if the nature, origin, 

condition, quantity and value of the goods are in accordance with the details and 

specifications contained in the goods declaration. This may cause inaccurate 

assessment of duties and taxes to be paid, thus causing possible loss of revenue 

accruing to the government. 

 



81 

 

In addition, the inability of the E2M system to appropriately tag all imports 

with generic descriptions due to lack of embedded facility to detect the same, 

rendered the system unreliable as it caused the release of said importations without 

the required examination.  

  

A walkthrough/interview with the Risk Management Office (RMO) on the 

ongoing and existing practice/procedure within the Bureau was conducted and 

gathered that the RMO uses the findings and feedbacks of the selectivity system of 

the Examiners/Appraisers through the facility Inspection Act for risk profiling and 

risk assessment since RMO’s system lack the facility for the detection of 

importations with general descriptions.  This facility Inspection Act, helps the RMO 

in its risk management, monitoring and review, to eliminate false negative, as well 

as false positive risk assessments for selectivity tagging.  However, upon validation, 

most of the entries with general descriptions have no input/data in the Inspection Act 

of the E2M. 

 

 Management’s inaction on the noted deficiencies and penalize the erring 

importers/brokers caused the recurrence of violations and when left uncorrected may 

bring about the breakdown of risk controls which would greatly affect the efficient 

implementation of operations. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require:  (a)  RMO to  

review of the current parameter settings in the selectivity system of the E2M 

and study the possibility of updating the parameters considering the existing 

regulations on generally described importations;   (b)  Examiners to comply with 

the policy and necessity of the Inspection Act and enforce strictly and effectively 

the proper accomplishment of the Inspection Act in the E2M system by 

indicating therein, the examiner’s adverse findings and recommendations 

which can be used and considered in risk assessment; and  (c) Ports to monitor 

importers and brokers who consistently violate the required importation 

declaration and recommend to the Account Management Office (AMO) the 

imposition of appropriate sanctions provided in Section VI of CAO No. 8-2007 

and CMO No. 28-2007 such as but not limited to warning, suspension of 

accreditation for six months or cancellation of accreditation and blacklisting as 

an importer/broker. 

 

 

Non-compliance with Accreditation Process. 

 

18. Import Entry Declaration (Single Administrative Document) amounting to 
P4.709 billion were filed and transacted with the Port without valid and proper 

accreditation from concerned importers or brokers in violation of the provisions 

of CMO No. 11-2014 and Section IV of CMO 31-2019. 

 



82 

 

CMO No. 11-2014 dated May 22, 2014 provides the guidelines for the 

registration of importers and Customs brokers who intend to or are transacting with 

the BOC.  It specifies the coverage with the exception of the following: 

 

a) Once-a-year importation; 
b) Importation by parcel post or by informal entry; 
c) Importation of the Philippine Government, its agencies and 

instrumentalities; 

d) Importation of personal effects, vehicles, motorcycles and household goods 
of a balikbayan and his or her family under RA No. 6768, as amended, 

Overseas Contract Workers and other returning residents; and 

e) Importation of foreign embassies, consulates, legations, agencies of other 
foreign governments and international organizations with diplomatic status 

and recognized by the Philippine government such as the Asian 

Development Bank and World Health Organization (ADB/WHO).  This 

shall include importation of personal effects and household goods of 

foreign workers and consultants, and officials and employees of foreign 

embassies, legations, consular officers and other representative of foreign 

governments. 

 

Unless otherwise provided for as an exception above, the term “importer” 

covered by these rules refers to any person who brings goods into the Philippines, 

whether or not made in the course of his trade or business.  It includes non - exempt 

persons or entities who acquire tax-free imported goods from exempt persons, 

entities or agencies. 

 

Section IV of CMO 31-2019 dated July 3, 2019 further provides and 

enumerates the documentary requirements for the importers and brokers 

accreditation and renewal which include the following, among others:  

 

 Bureau of Customs Official Receipt (BCOR) evidencing payment of 
processing fee of P1,000.00. 

 Printed Client Profile Registration System (CPRS) of the company/broker 
and updated notification of “STORED” and  

 Endorsement from the District Collector, if applicable. 
 

Likewise, due to the existing pandemic condition, OCOM Memo Nos. 57-

2020 dated March 19, 2020 and 117-2020 dated June 2, 2020 were issued to extend 

the validity of accreditations of importers and brokers during the ECQ which started 

on March 17, 2020 until May 31, 2020. The aforementioned memoranda provide that 

all customs accreditation of BOC Stakeholders that will expire during the 

implementation of the ECQ, starting March 17, 2020, shall remain valid.  The 

extension shall cover accreditation of BOC Stakeholders such as but not limited to 

importers, customs brokers, Super Green Lane Importers, Customs Bonded 

Warehouse, Customs Facilities and Warehouses, or any third-party transacting and 

accredited by the Bureau. All stakeholders with expired accreditation during the said 



83 

 

period will be given one month from the lifting of ECQ to submit application for 

renewal of their accreditation. In relation thereto, the AMO and all Collection 

Districts were directed to inform all stakeholders with expired accreditation during 

the said period to submit their application for renewal on or before July 1, 2020. 

 

The above regulations were issued to ensure the effective and proper 

enforcement of the CMTA and to guard the interest of the government against abuse 

of accreditation privileges, as well as to guarantee that only legitimate entities are 

accredited and allowed to transact with the Port. 

 

The CPRS as one of the internet-based subsystems of the Import Assessment 

System (IAS) serves as a central repository of data/information pertinent to BOC 

clients and stakeholders, and involves the process of capturing client information 

during accreditation and/or registration of the various BOC clients and stakeholders 

by filling out client specific form.  The captured information is stored in a central 

database to allow easy access to stakeholder’s information by operating units and 

systems serving line functions. Client registration is mandatory as various 

transactions with the Bureau cannot be processed unless the client is duly registered 

with the CPRS. 

 

For CY 2020, a review and evaluation was conducted on the process of 

accreditation of importers and brokers at POM and observed that several importers 

and brokers were able to transact with the Port despite their non-compliance with the 

accreditation process. The details are shown in Table 26.

Based on the data gathered, there were 10,188 entries for the period January 

to June 30, 2020 representing 40 importers and 111 brokers without proper 

accreditations, thus, should have not been processed in accordance with Section IV 

of CMO 31-2019 dated July 3, 2019. The details are presented in Table 27:

Particulars Importers Brokers Total 

Not listed as accredited  20 1 21 

Expired accreditation with no renewal 20 110 130 

Total 40 111 151 

 

As the BOC had not strictly enforced the proper accreditation, the 

accreditation fee of P1,000.00 was not collected for each importer and broker, or a 



84 

 

total of P151,000.00, thus, caused undue disadvantage to the government for non-

collection of the same amount representing processing fee of application and renewal 

of accreditation. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require:  (a)  strict 

compliance with the provisions of CMO No. 31-2019 dated July 3, 2019 and 

collect the amounts due from the erring importers/brokers as a result of non-

compliance; and  (b) MISTG to enhance the E2M system so that controls are 

embedded to check compliance with regulations as well as automatically detect 

or generate errors and reject transactions from non-accredited 

importers/brokers. 

 

 

Undeposited seized/confiscated currencies 

 

19. Seized and confiscated currencies equivalent to P88.777 million remained 
undeposited to the National Treasury or BOC’s AGDB as at December 31, 2020, 

not in accordance with Sections 63 and 65 of PD No. 1445 and posing risk of 

possible loss and misappropriation. 

 

Section 63 of PD No. 1445 states that except as may otherwise be specifically 

provided by law or competent authority, all moneys and property officially received 

by a public officer in any capacity or upon any occasion must be accounted for as 

government funds and property.  Government property shall be taken up in the books 

of the agency concerned at acquisition cost or appraised value. 

 

On November 6, 2020, the BOC NAIA, in the presence of Chief and Assistant 

Chief of Collection Division and COA representatives, conducted an inventory of 

seized/confiscated currencies stored in the Collection Division main vault. The Chief 

of the Collection Division on November 26, 2020, requested for re-inventory of the 

said currencies to be transferred from its main vault to the Bangko Sentral ng 

Pilipinas (BSP), however, said transfer did not pursue. These currencies were 

seized/confiscated by BOC NAIA due to misdeclaration and/or in excess of the 

allowable amount a person may bring in or take out of the Philippines. These 

currencies are still in the Collection Division’s vault and are not yet deposited to the 

National Treasury or in any duly Authorized Government Depository Bank (AGDB) 

of BOC as at December 31, 2020.  

 

The breakdown of the seized/confiscated currencies equivalent to P88.777

These currencies which remained undeposited to the National Treasury or any 

AGDB of BOC exposed the government funds to loss, misuse or misappropriation. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to deposit the 

seized/confiscated currencies to the National Treasury for currencies already 

with decision of finality in favor of the government and those under litigation in 

any duly AGDB of  BOC to ensure that these are safeguarded from loss or 

misappropriation. 

 

 

Non-Imposition of Liquidated Damages 

 

20. Liquidated damages totaling P8.527 million arising from delayed deliveries of 
X-ray machines were not imposed nor collected by the BOC, contrary to Section 

IV (19) General Conditions of the Contract Supply, Delivery, Installation and 

Commissioning of Various X-ray machines, thus causing undue disadvantage to 

the BOC in terms of maximizing the benefits of the project.  

 

Section IV (19) of the General Conditions of the Contract states that “Subject 

to GCC Clauses 18 and 22, if the Supplier fails to satisfactorily deliver any or all of 

the Goods and/or to perform the Services within the period(s) specified in this 

Contract inclusive of duly granted time extensions if any, the Procuring Entity shall, 

without prejudice to its other remedies under this Contract and under the applicable 

law, deduct from the Contract Price, as liquidated damages, the applicable rate of one 

tenth (1/10) of one percent of the cost of the unperformed portion for every day of 

delay until actual delivery or performance. The maximum deduction shall be 10% of 

the amount of contract. Once the maximum is reached, the Procuring Entity may 



86 

 

rescind or terminate the Contract pursuant to GCC Clause 23, without prejudice to 

other courses of action and remedies open to it.” 

   

On September 11, 2018, the BOC entered into a contract with of Astrophysics 

Inc., Astrophysics Asia Inc. and Genesis Transunited Inc., a joint venture, for the 

Supply, Delivery, Installation and Commissioning of Various X-ray machines 

amounting to P1.245 billion.  On the same date, the BOC issued notice to proceed 

(NTP) which was received and signed by the joint venture. 

 

Based on the contract and bidding documents, the delivery dates per schedule 

of requirements are enumerated in Table 29. 

 
Table 29. Contract Delivery Dates 

Type of Machine Date of Delivery 

Hand Carried X-Ray Machine 90 calendar days upon receipt of NTP or December 10, 2018 

Fixed Baggage X-Ray Machine 90 calendar days upon receipt of NTP or December 10, 2018 

Mobile Baggage X-Ray Machine 120 calendar days upon receipt of NTP or January 9, 2019 

Portal Type X-Ray Machine 1 year upon receipt of NTP or September 10, 2019 

 

In CY 2019 we observed that Management has not considered the imposition 

of Liquidated Damages (LD) amounting to P30.721 million for the delays in delivery 

and installation of the X-ray machines.  In CY 2020, Management submitted 

justifications on the said delays incurred, and submitted a computation of the 

imposed LD amounting to P0.616 million.  

 

The Audit Team recomputed the LD in the re-evaluation of Management 

comments pending submission of additional documents to justify the cause of delays.  

Results of the recomputation showed that the LD should have been P8.527 million 

based on the comments and justification received, as presented in Table 30.

The above recomputation pertains only to delays incurred pursuant to the 

stipulated delivery dates stated in the contract.  The delays that the contractor 

incurred in the installations and commissioning of the x-rays are not yet considered 

due to the lack of documentation provided to evaluate the  comments and 

justifications on restrictions incurred. 

 

The non-imposition of LD for the delays incurred by the contractor contrary 

to Section IV (19) General Conditions of the Contract Supply, Delivery, Installation 



88 

 

and Commissioning of Various X-ray machines caused disadvantage to the BOC in 

terms of maximizing the benefits of the project.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to impose the liquidated 

damages to the concerned contractor  totaling P8.527 million as a result of the 

delays incurred based on delivery dates stipulated. 

 

We likewise recommended and Management agreed to submit additional 

comments and supporting documents on the restrictions incurred on the 

installation and commissioning of various X-ray machines to facilitate review of 

the delays pertaining to installation and commissioning.  

 

 

Performance Evaluation 

 

Actual Collection vs. Target for CY 2020 

 

21. The BOC was not able to meet its Original Collection Target set by the DBCC 
of P731.255 billion for CY 2020 but exceeded the Revised Collection Target of 

P506.150 billion by P34.494 billion or 6.81 per cent. The reduction affected the 

overall collection goal of the Bureau and contributing lesser funds to the 

National Treasury for the implementation of programed expenditures for the 

year. 

 

Under Volume II of the GAA for FY 2020, the collection target of the Bureau 

for CY 2020 was set at P731.255 billion.  However, due to the COVID Pandemic, 

the overall collection target of the Bureau was revised to P506.150 billion as 

approved by the Development Budget Coordination Committee (DBCC). Despite the 

difficulties and setbacks brought about by the pandemic, the Bureau was able to 

generate revenue in the aggregate amount of P541.878 billion.  The detailed actual 

collection performance of the Bureau per port and sub-ports with the corresponding 

amounts and percentages vis a vis targets are presented in Table 33.

Tacloban, Zamboanga and Aparri ranging from 71.47 per cent to as high as 781.73 

per cent and the Port of Zamboanga increasing its target to P3.303 billion from the 

original target of P587.000 million.  

 

The struggles brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic and the 

accompanying lockdown affected greatly the ability of the Bureau to generate higher 

revenue and meet its collection target during the year.  However, it is noteworthy that 

the Port with the easing of the COVID - 19 restrictions during the 2nd quarter, was 

able to overcome the challenges and surpassed its revised monthly collection targets. 

 

Management attributed the inability of the Port to meet their targets due to 

the decrease in volume of importation.  The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the 

normal economic activity around the world in CY 2020.  The volume in importation 

declined following the declaration by the WHO.  Restrictions on movement directly 

affected labor supply, transport and travel and consequently, the whole sectors of 

national economies have been shut down including manufacturing. 

 

The non-attainment by the Bureau of its collection target would affect the 

financing plan of the government and would mean additional borrowings to finance 

deficits to support its various programs and projects.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to:   (a) continue to develop 

and adopt strategies that will improve the collection performance of every port 

in order to ensure correct allocation and achieve the targeted collection; and   

(b) exert more effort to analyze and examine Management’s systems and 

procedures on assessment, examination and collection, geared towards 

strengthening these processes and improving the Collection District’s 

performance. 

 

 

Compliance with Other Mandatory Accounts/Areas 

 
COVID-19-Related Observations 

 

With the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, the DBM issued National Budget 

Circular No. 580 dated April 22, 2020 on the Adoption of Economy Measures in the 

Government due to the Emergency Health Situations to guide NGAs in their fiscal 

management due to the pandemic.

For CY 2020, the BOC has incurred a total of P49.081 million COVID-19 related 

expenses for Personnel Services-Hazard Pay amounting to P28.028 million and 

Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE) of P21.053 million, which were 

charged against the regular budget of the BOC for the current year. Expenses under MOOE 

included procurement of various essential and critical supplies and materials mostly 

through PS-DBM, as well as services to ensure compliance with health protocols, such as 

the following:   

 

a) Surgical Face mask 
b) Surgical Gloves 
c) Face Shield 
d) Alcohol and sanitizers 
e) Disinfectant Sprays 
f) Thermal Guns 
g) Test Kits 
h) UV Machines 
i) Medical PPE 
j) Other Sanitation supplies 

 

Unsupported and Overpayment of Hazard pay 

 

22. Non-submission of relevant documents to support the grant of the COVID-19 
hazard pay to BOC officers and employees and COS during the ECQ in CY 

2020, not in keeping with  Section 4 (6) of PD No. 1445 and Section 7.2.1 of COA 

Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009, precluded the Audit Team in 

the audit of such compensation in accordance with the DBM Budget Circular 

2020-001 dated March 24, 2020. Moreover, overpayment amounting to 

P124,750.00 was incurred and disallowed in audit. 
 

Section 4(6) of PD No. 1445 provides that “Claims against government funds 

shall be supported with complete documentation.” Moreover, COA Circular No. 

2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 prescribes the revised guidelines and documentary 

requirements for common government transactions. For the grant of hazard pay, the 

required supporting documents include the following, among others: 

 

a) Duly Accomplished Time Record of Employees or Travel Report; 
b) Copy of Special Order from the agency/department head covering the 

assignment of hazardous/difficult areas; and 

c) Approved Daily Time Record (DTR)/Service Report”.  
 

Administrative Order No. 26 dated March 23, 2020 authorized the grant of 

Hazard Pay, beginning March 17, 2020, to government personnel who physically 

report for work during the period of implementation of the ECQ relative to the 

COVID-19 outbreak.  

 



91 

 

For CY 2020, of the BOC’s total expenses of P28.028 million for COVID-19 

Hazard Pay of officers and employees, the amount of P25.600 million covering the 

period March 17 to May 15, 2020 was paid. 

   

Review of the Agency’s records relative to the grant of Hazard Pay as 

processed by the OCOM in CY 2020 disclosed that payments for Hazard Pay to the 

officers and employees of the Ports listed in Table 31 were not supported with 

complete documentation, specifically  (a) Duly Accomplished Time Record of 

Employees/Approved DTR,  and (b)  Copy of Special Order from the 

agency/department head covering the assignment of hazardous/difficult areas, as 

provided under COA Circular No. 2012-001:  

 
Table 31. CY 2020 Hazard Pay Disbursements per Port

Tacloban        177,000.00  

Total P25,600,000.00 

 

The absence of these supporting documents precluded the Audit Team from 

ascertaining whether the employees were authorized and physically reported for 

work during the implementation of ECQ and MECQ, thus casting doubt on the 

validity and propriety of the COVID-19 Hazard Pay grant. 

 

Moreover, examination of the available data submitted by ports disclosed that 

there were overpayments made amounting to P124,750.00, as shown in Table 32.

92 

 

The grant of excessive hazard pay is not in keeping with the prudent 

management of government resources and without legal basis. 

 

We recommended and  Management  agreed to:    (a)  strictly comply 

with the provision of Section 4(6) of PD No. 1445 and with the requirements 

prescribed in COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 to ensure that all 

claims are supported with the necessary information and complete 

documentation to substantiate their validity, regularity and propriety and to 

avoid the issuance of Notice of Suspension/Disallowance; and  (b)  require the 

concerned employees to refund the overpayment of COVID-19 hazard pay. 

  

 

Gender and Development (GAD) 

 

23. The Bureau allocated a total of P2.065 million representing only 0.08 per cent 
of the total approved budget for FY 2020 and spent only a total of P1.264 

million, which was insufficient to fully address its gender issues/concerns, and 

thus, defeating the intent of the program to pursue women’s empowerment and 

gender equality, contrary to the pertinent provisions of RA No. 9710 or the 

MCW, RA No. 11465, otherwise known as the GAA for FY 2020, and PCW-

NEDA-DBM JC No. 2012-01. 

 
Section 31 of the General Provisions of RA No. 11465 provides that “All 

agencies of the government shall formulate a GAD Plan designed to address gender 

issues within their concerned sectors or mandate …xxx…The GAD Plan shall be 

integrated in the regular activities of the agencies, which shall be at least five per cent 

(5%) of their budgets.”  

 

For this purpose, activities currently undertaken by agencies which relate to 

GAD or those that contribute to poverty alleviation, economic empowerment 

especially of marginalized women, protection, promotion and fulfilment of women’s 

human rights, and practice of gender-responsive governance are considered 

sufficient compliance with said requirement. Utilization of the GAD budget shall be 

evaluated based on the GAD performance indicators identified by said agencies. 

 

Review/audit of the implementation of GAD programs and projects for CY 

2020 disclosed that the Bureau has not fully complied with the requirement of 

allocating at least five percent (5%) of the total appropriations for GAD Programs, 

Activities and Projects (PAPs), contrary to Section 36(a) of RA No. 9710 or the 

Magna Carta of Women (MCW), Section 31 of the General Provisions of the GAA 

for FY 2020 or RA No. 11465 and Section 2.3 of Philippine Commission on Women-

National Economic and Development Authority-Department of Budget and 

Management (PCW-NEDA-DBM) JC No. 2012-01.  According to the current GAD 

Focal Person, the reason for non-allocation of the required percentage of the budget 

was not known since she just assumed on December 3, 2019 and the BOC’s GAD 

Plan and Budget (GPB) was already approved. 



93 

 

 

Based on the list of activities submitted by Management, the amount 

appropriated for GAD PAPs was only P2.065 million, with the details shown in Table 

36. 
 

Table 36. GAD Budget and Fund Utilization (in P) 

Total Budget  

per GAA 

5% of Total 

Approved Budget per 

GAA for FY 2020 

 

Actual GAD Budget

2,447,765,000.00 P 122,388,250.00 P    2,065,140.00 P     1,263,901.61

Deficiency to (b)    P 120,323,110.00  P 121,124,348.39 

 

As can be gleaned from the table, the GAD budget allocation of P2.065 

million is only 0.08 per cent of the total appropriation which fell short of the 

requirement of five per cent, contrary to the pertinent provisions of Section 31 of RA 

No. 11465, thus budgets for organizational and client levels were not properly and 

sufficiently addressed.  

 

 We reiterated our recommendation with modifications that 

Management require the GAD Focal Point System (GFPS) to:  (a) strictly 

comply with the GAD annual budget allocation of at least five per cent of the 

total appropriation, considering the use of attribution of  estimated expenses for 

each PPA to arrive at the GAD budget;   (b)  monitor implementation of 

budgeted activities to ensure that these are implemented as scheduled and 

gender issues identified at organizational and client levels are properly and 

sufficiently addressed; and  (c)  require the members of the GFPS committee to 

attend seminars on GAD to enable them to formulate GPB that will address 

gender issues and in accordance with the PCW-NEDA-DBM JC No. 2012-01. 
 

 

24. Non-submission of the final GPB with signature of the head of the agency to the 
PCW for review and endorsement which is inconsistent with PCW-NEDA-DBM 

JC No. 2012-01, had prevented the appropriate government oversight bodies 

from conducting review of the same.   

 

Section 8.2 of PCW-NEDA-DBM JC No. 2012-01 mandates the GFPS to 

submit the final GPB and the corresponding GAD Accomplishment Reports (ARs) 

to PCW for review and endorsement to DBM.  It also provides the documents to be 

included in the agency submission of the GPB to PCW such as a letter signed by the 

head of agency informing the PCW that the agency’s GFPS has accordingly reviewed 

the GPB and GAD AR. 

 

Review of the CY 2020 GPB submitted by the Bureau revealed that the GPB 

was prepared but not approved and signed by the Commissioner.  This is likewise 

not submitted to and endorsed by PCW which is not in strict adherence to the 

abovementioned guidelines.  This was an audit observation in our CY 2019 audit 



94 

 

report, but Management has not complied with our recommendation, thus this 

observation. 

 

This practice has prevented the appropriate government oversight bodies such 

as PCW, DBM, and others from conducting review of the same to check conformity 

with existing GAD related guidelines, laws, rules and regulations and if necessary 

revisions should be made.   

 

We reiterated our recommendation that Management submit its GAD 

GPB for the succeeding years with the approval and signature of the agency 

head to the PCW for review and endorsement to DBM to allow the oversight 

bodies to ensure compliance with the established laws, rules and regulations. 

 

 

25. GAD ARs showed expenditures not included in the GBP as the GFPS was not 
able to prorate and mainstream GAD related activities in accordance with 

Section 31 of the General Provisions of GAA for FY 2020 or RA No. 11465 and 

Section 2.3 of PCW-NEDA-DBM JC No. 2012-01. 

 

Section 36 (a) of RA No. 9710 or the MCW, Section 31 of the General 

Provisions of GAA for FY 2020 or RA No. 11465 and Section 2.3 of PCW-NEDA-

DBM JC No. 2012-01 provides that the GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular 

activities of the agencies, which shall be at least five per cent (5%) of their budgets. 

 

Examination of the submitted GAD AR showed that out of the P2.065 million 

GAD budget, actual expenses incurred amounted to P163.542 million, as broken 

down in Table 37.

The amount of P1.264 million, representing 0.05 per cent of the GAD Budget 

was properly identified in the GPB as GAD related activities while the amount of 

P162.278 million pertained to salaries of employees assigned to examine balikbayan 

boxes in relation to the “Honey, My Love Scam”, victims which are usually women.  

The activity was not likewise included in the submitted GPB, however, the 

expenditure can be included in the GAD budget if GFPS was able to prorate the 

amount to reflect the actual expenses to be attributed to GAD. 

 

We recommended that Management properly plan, identify and 

mainstream GAD related activities to ensure that the AR rendered will reflect 

GAD Accomplishments which add value to a program.  

 

 

Senior Citizens and Persons with Disability, and Youth 

 

26. The Bureau had not allocated funds nor formulated plans, programs, and 
projects related to the Senior Citizens, Persons with Disability, and Youth, thus 

projects were not implemented for the benefit of senior citizens and differently-

abled persons.  

 

Section 32 of the General Provisions, GAA for FY 2020 or RA No.11465, 

requires all agencies of the government shall formulate plans, programs and projects 

intended to address the concerns of senior citizens and persons with disability, insofar 

as it relates to their mandated functions, and integrate the same in their regular 

activities.  Moreover, all government infrastructures and facilities shall provide 

architectural or structural features, designs or facilities that will reasonably enhance 

the mobility, safety and welfare of persons with disability pursuant to Batas 

Pambansa Blg. 344 and RA No. 7277, as amended. 

 

Likewise, Section 33 of the same GAA encouraged all agencies of the 

government to provide allocations for youth development projects and activities 

within the framework of the Philippine Youth Development Plan (2017-2022). 

 

Interview with FMO, Budget Division and HRMD revealed that no fund was 

allocated for youth development projects and to address the concerns of senior 

citizens and differently-abled persons.  Also, no other plans, programs and projects 

were specifically formulated for the same.  Nonetheless, Management explained that 

it has provided express lanes for senior and differently-abled individual within the 



96 

 

BOC premises for faster and ease of doing business but not specifically set in a 

budget.  

 

We reiterated our recommendation that Management allocate funds and 

formulate plans, projects and programs that will develop the youth and will 

benefit the senior citizens and differently-abled persons as prescribed by 

Sections 32 and 33 of the General Provisions of GAA for FY 2020. 

 

 

27. Tax Laws and Regulations, GSIS and Pag-IBIG Premium Contributions and 
Loan Amortization, and PhilHealth Premium Contributions 

 

For CY 2020, the BOC OCOM, Ports, and Sub-ports had deducted from the 

salaries of personnel the required taxes, premiums, contributions on personal share 

for Pag-IBIG and PhilHealth, social insurance contributions, and loan payments; 

withheld taxes from contractors and creditable value-added taxes from 

suppliers/dealers, and remitted the same, as well as the government share, within the 

prescribed period, to the respective institutions or agencies.  

 

a. Unremitted tax withheld in CY 2020 – P86.909 million  
 

Section 2.58 of Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 2-98, as amended by RR No. 

11-2018 to implement RA No. 10963, provides the due dates for filing of returns and 

payment of taxes. 

 

Section 12 of RR No. 11-2018 also provides that any employer/withholding 

agent, including the government, among others, who/which fails to comply with the  

filing/submission of BIR Form No. 2316 within the time required, may be held liable 

under Section 250 of the Tax Code, as amended, for each failure.  

 

Audit of the Due to BIR for CY 2020 disclosed that the BOC has withheld the 

amount of P153.241 million and remitted the amount of P198.606 million net of 

adjustments for the year amounting to P2.232 billion and P2.172 billion, respectively, 

thus, leaving an unremitted withholding taxes of P86.909 million as at December 31, 

2020.  The details are shown in Table 38.  

 
Table 38.  CY 2020 Tax Collections and Remittances

97 

 

Management informed that it is continuously reconciling its records with the 

Ports and making necessary adjustments to the account if necessary. 

        

The non-remittance of the taxes withheld is not in accordance with above-

cited RRs and may result in unnecessary penalties and surcharges as well as deprive 

the government of needed funds for government projects, if not remitted by the BOC. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Accounting 

Division to remit all taxes withheld in accordance with RR No. 2-98, as amended 

by RR No. 11-2018. 

 

b. Unremitted GSIS collections – P69.818  million  
 

Section 14, of the IRR of RA No. 8291, otherwise known as the Government 

Service Insurance Systems (GSIS) Act of 1997 requires, among others, each 

government agency to remit strictly to the GSIS the employees’ and government 

agency’s contributions including loan amortizations (consolidated loans, policy loan, 

emergency loan, housing loan, and other loans), premium payments (optional, pre-

need and other non-life insurance) and other amounts due the GSIS within the first 

10 days of the calendar month following the month to which the contributions apply.  

 

In CY 2020, the Bureau withheld P199.960 million and remitted P160.525 

million to the GSIS representing premiums, adjustments, and past due other 

authorized deductions from the salaries of personnel.  The Accounting Division 

informed that the unremitted balance of P69.818 million represents GSIS collections 

for the BOC Collection Districts that are subject for reconciliation before these are 

remitted to the GSIS.   

 

We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Accounting to 

conduct immediate reconciliation of the account and to comply strictly with RA 

No. 8291 on the timely remittance of GSIS contributions. 

 

c. Unremitted PhilHealth contributions - P4.777 million  
 

Section 179 of the National Health Insurance Act of 2013 and PhilHealth 

Circular No. 003-2015 dated February 27, 2015 provide that “Any employer or 

officer authorized to collect contributions who, after collecting or deducting the 

monthly contributions due from the employees, fails or refuses to remit said 

contributions to the Corporation within 30 days from the date they become due shall 

be punished with a fine of not less than P5,000.00 but not more than P10,000.00 

multiplied by the total number of employees of the firm.”  

 

Analysis of the Due to PhilHealth account disclosed that the BOC has a 

beginning balance of P5.880 million plus collections of P16.792 million in CY 2020 

and remitted the total amount of P17.895 million leaving a balance of P4.777 million 

as at  December 31, 2020.  The Accounting Division informed that the amount 



98 

 

unremitted is still for reconciliation since there are negative balances in the 

Subsidiary Ledgers of Collection Districts.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Accounting to 

conduct immediate reconciliation of the account and to remit the balances 

immediately to Philhealth. 
 

d. Unremitted PAG-IBIG contributions – P1.737 million  
 

Section E, subsection 4 of Pag-IBIG Circular No. 275 dated January 22, 2010 

provides the guidelines regarding the schedule of payment and corresponding 

penalties on late remittance of Pag-IBIG employer and employee contributions. 

 

Audit of the collection and remittances of Pag-IBIG contributions and loans 

disclosed that the amount of P1.737 million remained unremitted as at December 31, 

2020.  The Accounting Division informed that the amount unremitted is still for 

reconciliation and remittances will be done after reconciliation is made with the 

Collection Districts. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accounting 

Division and the Cashier to faithfully remit all monthly premiums/contributions 

withheld from the employees in compliance with existing laws, rules, and 

regulations and to reconcile their records with the concerned Ports. 

 

 

Hiring of casuals, job orders, contractuals and consultants 

 

28. Personnel hired under COS assumed and performed their duties despite the 
absence of contracts duly approved/signed by the Commissioner which is 

inconsistent with CMO No. 03-2019, thus posing risks and uncertainty on the 

interests of both the personnel and the Bureau. 

 

Section 5.1 of Joint Circular No. 2, series of 2020 dated October 20, 2020 of 

Commission on Audit (COA)  and Department of Budget and Management (DBM) 

defines Contract of Service (COS) as engagement of the services of an individual, 

private firm, other government agency, non-governmental agency, or international 

organization as consultant, learning service provider or technical expert to undertake 

special project or job within a specified period. 

 

Section 4.5 of CMO No. 03-2019 dated  February 7, 2019 provides the 

guidelines on hiring/renewal of COS personnel and states among others that no 

person under COS shall report to work without copy of contract signed by the 

Commissioner and no job order (JO) or COS personnel shall assume his/her duties 

without an approved/signed contract.  

 



99 

 

Section 6.1.1 of the same CMO likewise specify that 30 days before the end 

of the contract, the head of office/group/division in need shall request renewal of 

contract of COS personnel to be submitted to the office of the Deputy Commissioner, 

Internal Administration Group (IAG) containing details such as position and time 

frame or period of hiring.     

 

Inquiry with the management revealed that it was the Bureau’s practice that 

one month before the expiration of the contract of COS personnel, the Chief of 

Budget Division, Human Resource and Management Division (HRMD) and 

Accounting Division would have a meeting to decide on the duration of COS. Then, 

IAG would issue a memorandum requiring each office to submit the list of COS/JO 

for renewal within two weeks from the date of receipt. The head of each 

office/division will submit a list of COS personnel for renewal to the HRMD for 

evaluation and review. Upon advice of HRMD and after COS personnel submit the 

draft of contract and other supporting documents, the actions contained in Table 34 

will take place.

The IAG issued Memo No. 03-2020 dated January 14, 2020 and Memo No. 

19-2020 dated June 16, 2020, for the renewal of contracts of COS personnel for the 

period January to June 2020 and July to December 2020, respectively.  From this, it 

is evident that for the period of January to June 2020, the Bureau was not able to 

comply with Section 6.1.1 of CMO No. 03-2019.  Renewal of contracts for the said 



100 

 

period were prompted 14 days after the expiration of previous contract term, thus 

allowing COS personnel to assume work without approved contracts.  For contract 

renewal covering the period July to December 2020, the Bureau was compliant with 

the rules by issuing a memo before expiration of the existing contract.  

 

However, contrary to the estimated processing time as indicated in Table 35, 

review of the contracts showed that for the period of January to June 2020 and July 

to December 2020, it took an average of two months and one month, respectively, 

before a contract was perfected. The details are summarized in Table 35.

Likewise, inquiry with the HRMD personnel in-charge in processing contract 

renewal revealed that the delayed approval of contracts could be attributed to the 

following factors: 

 

a) difficulty in transmission of hard copy of documents from ports; and 
b) short contract term, thus, requiring COS personnel to undergo the same 

contract renewal process several times within a year. 

 

Delayed approval of the contracts resulted in late processing and payment of 

the salaries of the COS personnel as the certified true copy of the approved contract 

is one of the requirements to support the personnel’s claim for initial or monthly 

salaries.  Payment of salaries were delayed from two to three months due to the late 

processing of contracts to the disadvantage of the COS personnel. 



101 

 

 

Further, this practice exposed the Bureau to risks specifically if the COS 

personnel with no approved contracts performed functions which were part of the job 

description of the Agency’s existing regular employees.  There was no binding 

contract to hold the personnel liable for any demeaning or degrading act that may 

affect the integrity of the Bureau.  

 

Duly approved contract clearly defines the respective rights and obligations 

of both parties.  Absence of such, at the time of assumption of the personnel under 

COS brings uncertainty and lack of assurance that the interests of both parties shall 

be protected.  Enforcement of the terms and conditions that have been agreed upon, 

in case of violation or non-compliance shall be difficult.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to formulate plans and 

guidelines to streamline contract renewal process; and strictly observe the 

provisions of Section 4.5 of CMO No. 03-2019 dated February 7, 2019 that each 

COS personnel must have an approved contract of service before assumption to 

work.  

 

 

29. Non-compliance by the BOC with the maximum authorized monthly salary rate 
of several COS personnel in violation of CMO No. 22-2019 dated  April 24, 2019, 

thus may affect the budget of the Bureau to the disadvantage of the government 

or to the COS not receiving equitable compensation for work done. 
 

Section 8 of Joint Circular No. 2, series of 2020 dated October 20, 2020 of 

the COA and DBM provides that, individuals hired through contract of service shall 

be paid prevailing market rates subject to the provisions of RA No. 9184 and its 

Implementing Rules and Regulations. 

 

The IAG Memo No. 03-2020 dated January 14, 2020 and IAG Memo No. 19-

2020 dated June 16, 2020 on the renewal of contracts of personnel for the period 

January to June 2020 and July to December 2020, respectively, reiterated the 

authorized position title and the prescribed monthly salary as indicated in Item 4.9 of 

CMO No. 22-2019 dated  April 24, 2019, to wit:  

 

“Only the prescribed position titles indicated in the attached matrix 

shall be observed in the hiring, retention/renewal, and replacement of 

all persons under contract of service. Further, payment of monthly 

wages/ salaries shall not exceed the corresponding amounts specified 

therein.” 

 

Review and comparison of the monthly salary rates indicated in the contracts 

for CY 2020 against the authorized maximum monthly salary matrix in CMO No. 

22-2019 showed that: 

 



102 

 

a) Out of the 821 COS personnel hired for the period covering January 2 to 
June 30, 2020, the monthly salary rate of 10 personnel exceeds the 

prescribed rate while 596 personnel have monthly salary below the 

prescribed rate; and 

  

b) Out of the 805 COS personnel hired for the period covering July 1 to 
December 31, 2020, the monthly salary rate of five personnel exceeds the 

prescribed rate while 592 personnel have monthly salary below the 

prescribed rate. 

 

Providing for higher monthly salary than the prescribed rate is a clear 

violation of the CMO No. 22-2019 and could affect the Bureau’s budget concerns. 

Further, it may be unfavorable on the part of the government as it may be paying in 

excess for a service that it received.  On the contrary, providing for lower monthly 

salary rate, although authorized, would be disadvantageous to the COS personnel 

considering that they do not have security of tenure and do not enjoy similar benefits 

as against other government employees.  Likewise, providing for different monthly 

salary rate to COS personnel occupying the same position would be unfair if without 

valid distinction and reason.   

 

The monthly salary matrix for COS personnel as provided in CMO No. 22-

2019 should balance the interest of the government and each COS personnel.  Thus, 

strict compliance and uniform application of the said matrix is required to eliminate 

partiality. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to:  (a) review regularly the 

salary matrix for COS personnel and adjust the monthly wage/ salary 

accordingly equivalent to the comparable positions in government and 

considering other relevant factors; and (b) henceforth, ensure that the 

prescribed monthly salary rates are strictly and uniformly applied among 

contract of service occupying the same position. 

 

 
30. Non-compliance with timeliness and completeness of submission of contracts 

had caused delays in their review and deprived an objective examination/ 

evaluation of transactions which will guide management in its decision making.  
 

Section 3.1.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009 

provides that “Within five (5) working days from the execution of a contract by 

government or any of its subdivisions, agencies or instrumentalities, including 

government-owned and controlled corporations and their subsidiaries, a copy of said 

contract and each of all the documents forming part thereof by reference or 

incorporation shall be furnished to the Auditor of the agency concerned.” 

 

One of the activities essential to the conduct of post-audit of 

contracts/transactions is the review/evaluation of the technical and auditorial aspect 



103 

 

of the transactions.  Consonant to this objective, management is required to submit 

all necessary documents and information to the Audit Team within the prescribed 

periods to facilitate the review and evaluation of said contracts. 

 

However, it was observed that contracts were not regularly submitted unless 

requested by the Audit Team.  Moreover, validation from the list of the COS 

personnel submitted by the HRMD, disclosed that: 

 

a) 33 contracts for the period covering January 2 to June 30, 2020 and 9 
contracts for the period covering July 1 to December 31, 2020 were not 

submitted; and  

 

b) 36 contracts for the period covering January 2 to June 30, 2020 and 54 
contracts for the period covering July 1 to December 31, 2020 were 

submitted but without the statement of duties and responsibilities which 

formed part of the contract.  

 

The non-submission of said contracts within the prescribed timeline 

prevented the Audit Team from conducting timely review and determination of 

compliance with applicable rules and regulations including propriety of the financial 

transactions. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to strictly comply with the 

provisions of COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009 on the 

timeline of submission and documentary requirements to enable the Audit 

Team to conduct timely evaluation of its projects/transactions with the end-view 

of recommending measures for improved government operations and to avoid 

the issuance of audit suspensions. 

 

 

31. Status of Suspensions/Disallowances/Charges 
 

For CY 2020, there were no Notices of Charge (NC) issued. However, Notices 

of Suspension (NSs) of P714.539 million were issued to three Ports while Notices of 

Disallowance (NDs) of P0.765 million were issued to OCOM and four Ports.  Total 

settlements made during the year was P5.679 billion, P7.819 million and P35.306 

million for NS, ND and NC, respectively, which Notices of Settlement of Suspension 

and Disallowance/Charge (NSSDCs) were issued by the Audit Team.  The balances 

of NSs, NDs and NCs by port as at December 31, 2020 is presented in Table 39.
