EXECUTIVE SUMMARY







A)	Introduction



The House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal (HRET) was created under Section 17, Article VI of the 1987 Philippine Constitution to act as the sole judge of all contests relating to the election, returns and qualifications of the members of the House of Representatives.



 The primary mandate of the HRET is the adjudication of electoral contests involving members of the House of Representatives.  Since the adjudication period for each case depends on the progress of its proceeding, no annual target for the number of electoral protests is set by the Tribunal.

	

	The HRET is composed of nine members, three of whom are Justices of the Supreme Court and the rest are members of the House of Representatives, with the Senior Justice as the Chairman.  As at December 31, 2020, the HRET was composed of the following:

	

Justice Marvic Mario Victor F. Leonen

Chairperson

Justice Alexander G. Gesmundo

Justice Rosmari D. Carandang

	D. 	Scope of Audit



An audit was made on the accounts and operations of the HRET for CY 2020.  It was conducted to: a) verify the level of reliance that may be placed on Management’s assertions on the financial statements; b) determine the extent of compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations; c) recommend agency improvement opportunities; and d) determine the extent of implementation of prior years’ audit recommendations.





E. 	Independent Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements 



The auditor rendered an unmodified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the HRET’s financial statements as at December 31, 2020.

	

	

A)	Audit Observations and Recommendations



The audit disclosed the following observations with the corresponding recommendations, which are presented in detail in Part II of this report.  



1)	Non-forfeiture of unclaimed cash deposits which had been processed for return totaling ₱0.737 million resulted in the overstatement of Other Payables and understatement of Miscellaneous Income accounts, respectively, and non-issuance of notices authorizing the release of unused cash deposits totaling P9.297 million, contrary to existing rules of the House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal.

We recommended and Management agreed to require the a) Accountant to adjust Other payables and recognize Miscellaneous income totaling ₱737,597.31, after forfeiture, pursuant to Rule 35 of the Tribunal; b) Issuance by the Secretary of the Tribunal notices authorizing the release of unused cash deposits totaling ₱9,296,566.80 to the parties whose cases have been terminated/adjudicated with finality, and if not claimed within two years, application of Rule 35 will be considered; and c) Cashier to immediately remit to the BTr, pursuant to Section 65(1) of PD No. 1445, all collections pertaining to cash deposits which remain unclaimed for a period of two years from receipt of notice authorizing release thereof and are deemed forfeited in favor of the Tribunal.



2)	Salaries of coterminous and contractual employees, including per diems and extraordinary and miscellaneous expenses (EME) of Tribunal Members, totaling ₱47.721 million were paid through cash advances granted to the Cashier, acting as a Special Disbursing Officer (SDO), instead of employing  Automated Teller Machine payroll system thus, exposing the cash resources of the HRET to possible risk of mishandling and loss.

Foregoing considered, we reiterated our previous year’s recommendation and Management agreed to require the mandatory inclusion of all employees in an automated payroll system with the nearest Authorized Government Depository Bank for payment of all personnel services and other compensation, instead of payment through multiple cash advances.



3)	The Tribunal had an approved CY 2020 GAD Budget of ₱11.264 million equivalent to five percent of the Tribunal’s total budget and expended only ₱.030 million or 0.27 percent of the GAD budget for one GAD activity out of total 21 GAD activities thus, the intended purposes of legislation in addressing gender issues and concerns and contributing to poverty alleviation, economic empowerment especially of marginalized women were not attained, ultimately resulting in undelivered benefits to the intended beneficiaries of the program.

We reiterated our previous year’s recommendation and Management agreed to exert efforts, despite of the pandemic, to ensure compliance with pertinent provisions of the GAA and the Magna Carta of Women through the implementation of GAD programs and projects and full utilization of its available funding.

	

The above observations and recommendations were discussed with concerned officials on May 3, 2021 during an exit conference.  Management’s views and comments were incorporated in the report, where appropriate.

	

	

	G.	Status of Audit Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges

For CY 2020, no Notice of Suspension, Notice of Disallowance, and Notice of Charge was issued.





H.	Status of Implementation of Prior Years’ Recommendations



All four prior years’ audit recommendations were not implemented.
