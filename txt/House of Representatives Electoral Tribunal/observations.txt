FINANCIAL ISSUES



Unclaimed Cash Deposits for a period of two years from receipt of notice authorizing release thereof



1)	Non-forfeiture of unclaimed cash deposits which had been processed for return totaling ₱0.737 million resulted in the overstatement of Other Payables and understatement of Miscellaneous Income accounts, respectively, and non-issuance of notices authorizing the release of unused cash deposits totaling P9.297 million, contrary to existing rules of the House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal.



	1)	Rule 35 of the 2015 Revised Rules of the House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal, provides that x x x. Any unused cash deposit shall be returned to the party or parties who paid the same after complete termination of the protest, counter-protest or petition for quo warranto. Any unused cash deposit which remains unclaimed for a period of two years from receipt of notice authorizing release thereof shall be deemed forfeited in favor of the Tribunal.  x x x.” (emphasis ours)



	2)	As of December 31, 2020, the Other Payables account has an outstanding balance of ₱36,610,908.43. This amount includes ₱35,694,839.38 cash deposits from protestants and protestees intended to be used for expenses incidental to the adjudication of their cases. The breakdown of the cash deposits per congressional years/terms with protest is shown in Table No. 1.

	3)	We noted that ₱737,597.31 of the cash deposits for electoral protests filed before the Tribunal have been processed for return to the involved parties but were unclaimed as of audit period, which resulted in stale checks. Non-forfeiture of these unclaimed cash deposits as at year-end effectively overstated the Other Payables and understated the Miscellaneous Income accounts by ₱737,597.31.



	4)	Also, we were informed by Management that all protest cases filed before the Tribunal in five of the last six congressional terms/years (i.e. 2001 – 2019, except 2004 – 2007) have all been terminated/adjudicated with finality. This means that unused cash deposits totaling ₱9,296,566.80 (see Table No. 1) can be forfeited if unclaimed by the parties involved, after due notice, pursuant to Rule 35 of the Tribunal.

 

	5)	All collections from forfeited cash deposits should be remitted to the Bureau of Treasury (BTr) pursuant to Section 65(1) of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 or the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines to help improve the fiscal position of the National Government and support relevant programs especially during these difficult times of the COVID-19 pandemic.



	6)	We recommended and Management agreed to require the:



a)	Accountant to adjust Other payables and recognize Miscellaneous income totaling ₱737,597.31, after forfeiture, pursuant to Rule 35 of the Tribunal.



b)	Issuance by the Secretary of the Tribunal of notices authorizing the release of unused cash deposits totaling ₱9,296,566.80 to the parties whose cases have been terminated/adjudicated with finality, and if not claimed within two years, application of Rule 35 will be considered; and



c)	Cashier to immediately remit to the BTr, pursuant to Section 65(1) of PD No. 1445, all collections pertaining to cash deposits which remain unclaimed for a period of two years from receipt of notice authorizing release thereof and are deemed forfeited in favor of the Tribunal.





COMPLIANCE ISSUES



Continued employment of the traditional cash payroll scheme through cash advances for recurring personnel services 



2)	Salaries of coterminous and contractual employees, including per diems and extraordinary and miscellaneous expenses (EME) of Tribunal Members, totaling ₱47.721 million were paid through cash advances granted to the Cashier, acting as a Special Disbursing Officer (SDO), instead through Automated Teller Machine payroll system thus, exposing the cash resources of the HRET to possible risk of mishandling and loss.



	1)	Section 124 of Presidential Decree 1445 otherwise known as the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines, states that, “It shall be the direct responsibility of the agency head to install, implement and monitor a sound system of internal control.”



	2)	Moreover, COA Circular No. 76-26, provides that “x x x. It is therefore, incumbent upon management to institute internal safeguards or procedures particularly those in connection with disbursement of all forms, adopt systematic voucher processing techniques x x x“

	

	3)	Further, the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) had been urging all National Government Agencies to adopt the Expanded Modified Direct Payment Scheme (ExMDPS) which includes payment through the Automated Teller Machine (ATM) as stated in its Circular Letter No. 2013-16 dated December 23, 2013. The advantages of the ATM payroll system make transactions quick, verifiable and transparent. Through the ATM system, payees can withdraw funds at their most convenient time and location. On the agency’s side, man-hours for the preparation of the individual amounts, consumption of supplies and materials, and exposure of cash resources to possible loss are virtually eliminated.   

	

	4)	Examination of disbursements or payment through the cash advance in CY 2020 revealed that the total amount of ₱47,721,362.33 was granted to the Cashier, acting as a Special Disbursing Officer (SDO), as cash advance for salaries of coterminous and contractual employees, including per diems and Extraordinary and Miscellaneous Expenses (EME) of Tribunal Members. The details are shown in Table No. 2.

	5)	In our previous year Annual Audit Report (AAR), the issue on the use of the traditional Cash Payroll System had been raised and we stressed the advantages of the ATM payroll system. Management then explained that the uncertainty of the tenure of office and high turnover of the coterminous employees make it impractical to implement the ATM payroll system.



	6)	The turnover issue among coterminous personnel notwithstanding, we recognize Management’s effort in considering their inclusion into the Automated Payroll scheme of the agency as evidenced by a Memorandum issued on January 31, 2020 with the subject, “Enrollment in Automated Teller Machine (ATM) Payroll”. However, since the adoption of the said scheme was optional, not one of the coterminous employees enrolled.



	7)	Our inquiry with several coterminous employees to obtain feedback on possible inclusion in an automated payroll system, most if not all, are amenable to receive their salaries thru ATMs moving forward.  This underscores the importance of access to safe and secure transactions anywhere and anytime more so during this pandemic period.



	8)	Foregoing considered, we reiterated our previous year’s recommendation and Management agreed to require the mandatory inclusion of all employees in an automated payroll system with the nearest Authorized Government Depository Bank for payment of all personnel services and other compensation, instead of payment through multiple cash advances.





OTHER COMPLIANCE ISSUES



Gender and Development (GAD) Fund



3)	The Tribunal had an approved CY 2020 GAD Budget of ₱11.264 million equivalent to five percent of the Tribunal’s total budget and expended only ₱.030 million or 0.27 percent of the GAD budget for one GAD activity out of total 21 GAD activities thus, the intended purposes of legislation in addressing gender issues and concerns and contributing to poverty alleviation, economic empowerment especially of marginalized women were not attained ultimately resulting in undelivered benefits to the intended beneficiaries of the program.



	1)	Section 31 of the General Provisions of RA 11465, also known as the 2020 General Appropriations Act (GAA) states that, “the GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of the agencies, which shall be at least five per cent of their budgets. For this purpose, activities currently being undertaken by agencies which related to GAD or those that contribute to poverty alleviation, economic empowerment especially of marginalized women, protection, promotion, and fulfillment of women’s human rights, and practice of gender-responsive governance are considered sufficient compliance with said requirement.”



	2)	Similarly, Section 36 (a) of Magna Carta of Women, provides that “GAD programs addressing gender issues and concerns shall be designed and implemented based on the mandate of government agencies and local government units, Republic Act No. 7192, gender equality agenda of the government and other GAD-related legislation, policies, and commitments. The development of GAD programs shall proceed from the conduct of a gender audit of the agency or the local government unit and a gender analysis of its policies, programs, services and the situation of its clientele; the generation and review of sex-disaggregated data; and consultation with gender/women's rights advocates and agency/women clientele. The cost of implementing GAD programs shall be the agency's or the local government unit's GAD budget which shall be at least five percent (5%) of the agency's or the local government unit's total budget appropriations.”



	3)	The approved GAD budget of the HRET amounted to ₱11,263,629.44. Based on the submitted Annual GAD Accomplishment Report for CY 2020, the agency had only utilized ₱30,760 or 0.27 percent of the approved budget. All 21 GAD-related activities planned for 2020 were not implemented at all. Details are shown in Table No. 3.

	4)	While we acknowledged the limitations caused by the current COVID-19 pandemic and the efforts exerted by Management in implementing its GAD programs for the CY 2020, pertinent provisions of prevailing laws and regulations require the full utilization of available funds. The non-implementation of GAD programs and projects during the year resulted in undelivered benefits to intended personnel of the agency.
