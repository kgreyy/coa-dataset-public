EXECUTIVE SUMMARY



A)		Introduction 



Guimaras State College (GSC) came into existence by virtue of Republic Act No. 9138 enacted by the 11th Congress on June 8, 2001.  Conversion into a state college resulted in the integration of the Western Visayas College of Science and Technology-Guimaras Extension in Alaguisoc, Jordan, Guimaras as a satellite campus, which was renamed Guimaras State College-Mosqueda Campus. Another satellite campus, the Baterna Campus, was put up for the College of Agriculture.



Consequently, Republic Act. No. 11335, or an act converting the Guimaras State College in the Province of Guimaras, into a State University, to be known as the Guimaras State University, was enacted on April 26, 2019. However, the establishment or conversion of the GSC into a state university has not been effected pending compliance with the requirements for university status, as determined by the Commission on Higher Education (CHED).



Being the lone higher educational institution in the Province of Guimaras, the College is envisioned to be a center of development in Education and Technology, producing values-oriented, self-sufficient skilled workers, technicians, and globally competitive professionals. Its mission is to produce quality graduates and professionals, responsive to the needs of the community through competent faculty and staff, as well as updated facilities. 



The College is governed by the Board of Trustees (BOT) chaired by the CHED. 



The Administrative Council, which handles the direct supervision and administration of the College’s administrative affairs is led by College President Dr. Lilian Diana B. Parreño and assisted by two Vice Presidents, Division Chiefs, Deans, Department Chairpersons, and the heads of all the non-academic units of the College.  



The College has a total personnel complement of 377, consisting of the following:

A financial and compliance audit was conducted on the accounts and operations of the Guimaras State College for the calendar year ended December 31, 2020. The audit was aimed to determine the reliability of the agency’s accounts to be able to express an opinion on the financial statements and to determine whether the financial transactions were carried out in accordance with existing laws, rules, and regulations.

D)		Auditor’s Opinion on the Financial Statements



The Auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the financial statements of the Guimaras State College for the year ended December 31, 2020, since the existence, completeness and accuracy of Property, Plant and Equipment amounting to ₱128.665 million could not be verified in the absence of the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE).



E)		Observations and Recommendations  



The following are the significant findings and the corresponding recommendations: 



1)	Cash advances granted to officers and employees totaling ₱9.882 million as of December 31, 2020, per the agency’s status of unliquidated cash advances, remained outstanding, contrary to the Commission on Audit Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997, thus, it could not be determined whether or not the cash advances were spent in accordance with the purpose for which they were granted. Moreover, expenses were understated by the amount of unliquidated cash advances.

		

		

		

		We recommended and the Management agreed to:

			

a.	Provide a plan of action with timelines for addressing the deficiencies noted and furnish a copy thereof to the auditor;



b.	Require the immediate liquidation of all past due cash advances particularly those whose purposes have long been completed, otherwise the Accountant shall cause the withholding of the salary of the concerned accountable officer as provided under Section 5.1.3 of the COA Circular;



c.	Exhaust all possible remedies to collect or demand liquidation from the two accountable officers who are no longer connected with the College; 



d.	Reconcile discrepancies noted in the records and provide supporting documents or references upon resolving such differences; and



e.	Strictly comply with the rules and regulations on the grant, utilization and liquidation of cash advances provided under COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997.



2)	The formulation and revision of Project Procurement Management Plan (PPMP) and the Annual Procurement Plan (APP) of the GSC were not compliant with the provisions of Section 7, Rule II of the 2016 Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations of R.A. 9184 or the Government Procurement Reform Act, thus, defeating their usefulness as effective tools to sustain a meticulous and judicious procurement planning.



We recommended and the Management agreed that: 



a)	The End User Office and the BAC strictly adhere to the rules and regulations governing the formulation and revision of Project Procurement Management Plan (PPMP) and Annual Procurement Program (APP), in accordance with Section 7, Rule II of the 2016 Revised Implementing Rules of R.A. 9184 or the Government Procurement Reform Act and its Manual of Procedures, Volume 1;



b)	The End User Office and the BAC adopt the prescribed processes and forms in the preparation and revision of PPMP and APP, to include milestone of activities, mode of procurement, description of projects and other relevant information as mandated by R.A. 9184; 



c)	The College President seek authority from the Head of the Procuring Entity (Board of Trustees) to approve Supplemental Annual Procurement Plans and revisions of the procurement modality in the APP, and subsequently, the BAC to effect changes thereto in compliance with the requirements of Section 48.3, Rule XVI and Section 7.2, Rule II of the 2016 Revised IRR of RA 9184, in cases where the original mode of procurement indicated in the APP cannot be ultimately pursued; and



d)	The BAC formulate a method to be employed in the consolidation of PPMP into the APP to facilitate the establishment of a procurement strategy that will provide a cost-effective option such as preparing the APP according to the types of goods or services to be procured or by mode of procurement, all at the option of the procuring entity.



3)	Payments for Buildings and Other Structures totaling ₱9.775 million were not supported with complete documentation, contrary to Sec. 4.6 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445, thus, propriety and validity of disbursements are not ensured.



		We recommended and the Management agreed to:

		

a.	Direct the Accountant and the Planning Director to, henceforth, ensure compliance with Section 4.6 of P.D. No. 1445 and Section 9.1.1 of COA Circular 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 on the submission of documentary requirements to support disbursements; and



b.	Require the Planning Director to submit the required supporting documents of the building project.
