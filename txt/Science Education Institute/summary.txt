D. Scope of Audit  
  

The audit covered the accounts and operations of SEI for the year ended 

December 31, 2020. The audit was conducted to (a) ascertain the level of assurance 

that may be placed on management’s assertions on the financial statements; (b) 

recommend agency’s improvement opportunities, (c) determine the propriety of 

transactions as well as the extent of compliance with pertinent laws, rules and 

regulations, and (d) determine the extent of implementation of prior year’s audit 

recommendations.  

  

E. Independent Auditor’s Report  
    

A qualified opinion was rendered on the financial statements of the SEI as 

at December 31, 2020 for the misstatements in Cash; Receivables; Property, Plant 

and Equipment; and Other Asset accounts amounting to ₱42.409 million 

representing 0.46 percent of its total assets, while Accounts Payable account were 

misstated by ₱1.026 million or 0.98 percent of the total liabilities and Accumulated 

Surplus/ (Deficit) account was misstated by ₱15.237 million or 0.17 percent of the 

total equity of the Institute as at year-end.  

  

F. Summary of Other Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations  
  
The other significant observations and recommendations, discussed in detail 

in Part II of the report, are as follows:    

  
1. Retention of unutilized scholarship funds (SFs) of approximately ₱1.7 billion 

reported in prior year’s and an undetermined amount of SFs transferred to 

Implementing Agencies (IAs) which had accumulated in the Cash in Bank-LCCA 

accounts of the SEI and the IAs, respectively, and had not been remitted to the 

National Treasury contrary to Section 28, Book VI of Executive Order No. 292 and 

Section 99 of P.D.1445 depriving the government of the much needed resources to 

fund priority projects.  

  

We reiterated our prior year’s recommendation and Management agreed to: 

  

a. require the Science and Technology Scholarship Division (STSD) and 
Accountant to:   

  



iii 

 

i. Revert to the BTr the remaining prior year’s unexpended 
balances of the S&T Scholarship Fund (SF) including grants 

intended to scholars who defaulted and are no longer 

eligible/qualified to receive their benefits and all funds 

transferred to the S&T SF bank account without valid 

obligations; and 

 

ii. Stop the practice of transferring funds to the S&T SF account 
for transactions without valid expenses/obligations, more so if 

the intention is only to avoid the lapse of funds or automatic 

reversion of the excess funds to the BTr; otherwise, discontinue 

the transfer of funds from Cash MDS to LCCA and release the 

payment of financial assistance and grants directly to the 

scholars through the MDS; and 

  

b. Require the IAs on the immediate reversion to the BTr of the 
accumulated prior year’s unexpended balances of scholarship funds 

received by them; and 

 

c. Refrain from granting authority to utilize the unexpended balances of 
scholarship funds to the IAs. 

 

2. Timely liquidation of funds received from Source Agencies (SAs) was not strictly 
implemented thus, the accumulation of dormant balances of completed projects 

amounting to ₱3,929,663.71 under the account Due to NGAs contrary to COA 

Circular Nos. 94-013 and 2016-005 dated December 13, 1994 and December 19, 

2016, respectively. Moreover, the unliquidated balances outstanding for over ten 

(10) years, without the corresponding cash accounts and no records found for 

projects’ dates of completion cast doubts on the reliability of the balance of Due to 

NGAs account as at year-end and on whether the project was implemented and its 

outputs/objectives were attained.      

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to:  

  

a. Coordinate with the SA Accountant in the reconciliation of the long 
outstanding balances of completed projects by analyzing the accounts Due 

to NGAs against the Cash- Treasury Agency Deposit- Trust and effect the 

necessary adjustments for reconciling items noted;  

 

b. Enforce full liquidation of the amount received thru the submission of 
liquidation reports and the refund of the excess unutilized funds to avoid 

accumulation of dormant and long outstanding unliquidated fund 

transfer balances; and 

 



iv 

 

c. Henceforth, strictly enforce the liquidation of fund transfers received 
within the prescribed period depending upon their nature and purpose to 

ensure attainment of the project output/objectives. 

 

3. Honoraria amounting to ₱2,227,299.02 and paid to personnel assigned in the 
Special Projects were based on DOST Memorandum Circular No. 001 dated March 

12, 2009 contrary to the provisions of DBM-DOST Joint Circular No. 1, s. 2013 

dated June 25, 2013 and DBM Budget Circular No. 2007-2 dated October 1, 2007, 

resulting in irregular expenditures.  Moreover, payment thereof was not adequately 

supported with the proper documents as required in Section 5.7.5 of COA Circular 

No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012. 

  

We recommended and Management agreed to:  

 

a. Strictly comply with the guidelines set under DBM-DOST Joint Circular 
No. 1, s. 2013 and DBM Budget Circular No. 2007-2 on the computation 

of honorarium payment to personnel assigned in special projects; 

  

b. Adequately plan the implementation of the project by preparing special 
project plan considering the details enumerated in Section 4.3.1.1 to 

Section 4.3.1.5 of DBM-DOST Joint Circular No. 1, s. 2013; 

 

c. Formulate performance evaluation plan for rating purposes which will be 
used in the payment of actual honorarium; and 

 

d. Strictly comply with the immediate submission of the documentary 
requirements prescribed in Section 5.7.5 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 

on payment of honoraria for special projects. 

 

4. Honoraria granted were directly paid to concerned personnel who acted as lecturers, 
resource persons, coordinators and facilitators, and those who were assigned in 

special projects, and members of committees hence, benefits received were not 

properly accounted and monitored for the 25 percent annual salary threshold and 

taxation purposes. 

  

We recommended that the Management require the Accountant to remit to 

the respective mother agencies of the government personnel to be paid 

honoraria and ensure that honoraria received for all special projects does not 

exceed the employee’s 25 percent annual salary.  

 

The above findings and recommendations were presented to the concerned 

officials of SEI through the Summary of Audit Observations and Recommendations 

(SAOR) on May 4, 2021 in lieu of exit conference due to the restrictions brought 

about by the COVID pandemic. Management’s views and comments were 

considered in the report, where appropriate.
