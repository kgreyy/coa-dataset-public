PART II – OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS  

    
Financial Audit  
  
Accounting Errors and Omissions  
  

1. The Science Education Institute’s (SEI’s) Cash, Receivables, Property, Plant 
and Equipment, and Other Asset accounts have misstatements totaling P42.409 million 

representing 0.46 percent of its total assets, while Accounts Payable account had 

misstatements of P1.026 million or 0.98 percent of the total reported liabilities and 

Accumulated Surplus/ (Deficit) account had misstatements of P15.237 million or 0.17 

percent of the total equity of the Institute as at December 31, 2020, resulting in 

overstatements/understatements of the affected accounts. Due to the significant 

impact of such misstatements on the reported balances of the affected accounts, 

Management assertions as to the accuracy, completeness and classification of the said 

accounts could not be relied upon.  
  

2. Paragraph 15 of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) 1 
and Section 3, Chapter 19 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume I, states 

that “Financial statements are a structured representation of the financial position and 

financial performance of an entity. The objectives of general purpose financial statements 

are to provide information about the financial position, financial performance, and cash 

flows of an entity that is useful to a wide range of users in making and evaluating decisions 

about the allocation of resources.” The standards further states that specifically, the 

objectives of general purpose financial reporting in the public sector should be to provide 

information useful for decision making, and to demonstrate the accountability of the entity 

for the resources entrusted to it. 

 

3. Paragraph 27 of the IPSAS provides that Financial Statements (FSs) shall present 
fairly the financial position, financial performance, and cash flows of an entity. Fair 

presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, 

and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, 

liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in IPSASs. The application of IPSASs, with 

additional disclosures when necessary, is presumed to result in FSs that achieve a fair 

presentation. 

 

4. Moreover, Sections 111 and 112 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 requires 
agencies to keep the accounts in such detail as necessary to meet the needs of the agency 

and at the same time be adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or control 

agencies of the government; and that the highest standard of honesty, objectivity and 

consistency shall be observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate 

and misleading information. Each government agency shall record its financial transactions 

and operations conformably with IPSAS and in accordance with pertinent laws and 

regulations.  

 



27  

  

5. When an audited entity presents its FSs, it is implicitly making assertions that certain 
conditions have been fulfilled in the accounts, among others, which are as follows: 

 

6. The responsibility for the fair presentation and reliability of the FSs rests with the 
Management of the reporting entity, particularly the Head of Finance/Accounting Office 

and the head of entity or his authorized representative, as provided in the Philippine 

Application Guidance (PAG) 4 on IPSAS I and Section 4, Chapter 19 of the Government 

Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume I. 

 

7. In our audit of the Institute’s accounts, we noted the following misstatements which 
were not adjusted as at year-end.

11. Details of the above reconciling items are further discussed below: 
 

• Unidentified and unrecorded credit memos (a, b & f) 
 

12. As previously observed and reported in our Annual Audit Report (AAR) for CY 
2019, various credit memos pertained to the accumulated direct deposits from scholars 

whether for refund of scholarship benefits received, cash bonds posted in securing 

clearances or testing/examination fees, which remained unrecorded/unadjusted in the 

books pending the identification process by the Science and Technology Scholarship 

Division (STSD) and Accounting Unit. 

 

13. Despite the combined efforts of the two divisions, a total of ₱10,993,612.20 
unrecorded credit memos still exist which is 82 percent higher than the prior year’s amount 

of ₱6,037,716.741. The Schedule of credit memos is presented in Table 4:

14. Further, the Audit Team was informed that the credit memos do not only pertain to 
actual deposits from scholars for refund or cash bonds but also includes adjustments from 

the bank due to closed accounts of some scholar-payees.  The payment of financial 

assistance to scholars did not go through their accounts due to its closure, hence, the credit 

memo.  The reversal of entry of unprocessed payments, however, were not recognized in 

the CIB-LCCA account, thus, said credit memos remained to be a reconciling item in the 

BRS. The Accounting Unit noted that there were letters from the SEI to LBP informing the 

latter of the closures of bank accounts of certain scholars, changes in the account numbers, 

and a request to re-process the payment thereafter.  These requests then resulted in the 

occurrence of various debit memos on the S&T Scholarship Fund account since 2018.  

Moreover, it was only through the letter requests that the Accounting Unit was able to trace 

the corresponding credit memo for each debit memo which in effect offset and cleared the 

balances in the BRSs.  However, the Audit Team observed the accumulation of these credit 

memos as the requests to re-process payments to those scholars with closed accounts were 

not immediately prepared.   

 

15. Disbursements as defined in Chapter 6 of the GAM for National Government 
Agencies (NGAs), constitutes all cash paid out during a given period in currency (cash) or 

by check/Advice to Debit Account (ADA). 

 

16. The Audit Team believes that the process of offsetting said unprocessed 
payment/credit memo for each debit memo circumvent the proper accounting procedures.  

These considered credit memos were not actual deposits but were government 

disbursements which were not successfully paid to the scholar-payee due to the closed bank 

account.  Since no actual cash has been disbursed and funds were still in the depository 

bank, a reversal entry should have been made on the unprocessed payment of 

expenses/obligation to reflect the correct balance of the cash in bank.  The re-processing 

of payments can be made once a new active bank account of the scholar is available with 

a new approved disbursement voucher, therefore, there is no need to request for debit 

memos in the bank. 

 

17. Moreover, we have observed that there were long outstanding credit memos which 
were still not identified and recorded as shown in Table 4.  Query disclosed that these were 

actual deposits of either refunds, cash bonds or testing/examination fees from scholars 

which were still not recorded in the books due to unavailable information from the 

depositors.  Since there were neither valid claims nor available information on the 

outstanding credit memos, especially those unidentified and unrecorded for two years or 

more, the Audit Team suggested that these be recorded in the CIB-LCCA and Accumulated 

Surplus/Deficit accounts and be subsequently reverted to the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr). 

 

• Collections erroneously deposited to another fund (d & e) 
 

18. Erroneous deposits to the S&T Scholarship Fund totaling ₱89,519.82 that should 
have been deposited as a collection to the Philippine California Advanced Research 

Institute (PCARI) Scholarship Project account have not yet been withdrawn and transferred 

to the PCARI account. 



31  

  

 

19. In line with the foregoing, the unadjusted book reconciling items understated CIB-
LCCA account by ₱10,944,594.51 and Accumulated Surplus/Deficit by the same amount 

which affected the fair presentation of the accounts in the financial statements.  

 

20. We recommended and Management agreed to require: 
 

a. The Accountant to: 
 

i. Make representations with the bank for the submission of the bank 
debit and credit advices and other relevant documents to support the 

recording of reconciling items in the books; 

 

ii. Prepare the adjusting entry to recognize in the CIB-LCCA the credit 
memos representing unprocessed payments to scholars with closed 

accounts; and henceforth, promptly record the reversal entry of the 

unprocessed payments upon receipt of the monthly credit memo 

advices from the bank to reflect correct balance of cash in bank and 

actual disbursements; 

 

iii. Record credit memos outstanding for over two years or more and 
subsequently revert the funds to the BTr; 

 

iv. Effect adjustments on the erroneous deposits to S&T Scholarship 
Fund; and 

 

v. Exert more effort in preparing and submitting the BRS with adequate 
documentation within the prescribed period; and  

 

b. The STSD personnel to: 
 

i. Stop the practice of requesting the bank to re-process payments 
through debit memos, instead prepare a new disbursement voucher 

once new/active bank accounts of scholar-payees are provided; and 
 

ii. Provide the Accountant, copies of the validated deposit slips and 
clearances issued to scholars for prompt recording and easy 

identification of the deposits appearing in the monthly BS. 

 

21. Management has instructed the Accountant to address the issues raised and to 
coordinate with the bank for proper reconciliation. 

 

22. The Accounting Unit has already effected the adjusting entries to recognize the 
credit memos issued by the bank. Journal Entry Voucher (JEV) No. 2021-01-000250 

amounting to ₱10,649,091.48 was made to take up the unidentified credit memos in the 

S&T Scholarship Fund. The Accounting Unit prepared Check No. 563745 amounting to 



32  

  

₱3,543,797.93 for the reversion to the BTr of the outstanding credit memos with over two 

years starting from 2006 up to 2018. The Accounting Unit also prepared Check No. 563744 

amounting to ₱89,519.82 for the reversion to PCARI fund for the collection erroneously 

deposited to the S&T Scholarship Fund. 

 

23. Moreover, the STSD will stop the practice of requesting the bank to re-process 
payments via debit memos, and instead prepare a new disbursement voucher once new/ 

active bank accounts of scholars are available. 

 

24. STSD will also provide the Accounting Unit the copies of deposit slips and 
clearances issued to scholars for prompt and easy identification of the deposits in the BRS. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder 

 

25. Although Management informed that adjusting entries have been recorded, the JEVs 
and supporting documents are yet to be submitted to the Audit Team for validation. 

 

b) recognition of receivable in the Due from National Government Agencies 
(NGAs) and Due from National Government Organizations/Civil Society 

Organizations (NGOs/CSOs) account without an actual transfer of funds to IAs 

amounting to ₱163,200.00 and ₱863,200.00, respectively 

 

26. Annex M of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, prescribed illustrative accounting 
entries for the inter-agency transfer of funds, to wit: 
 

Table 5: Illustrative entries

Due from NGAs                                        xxx

** To recognize transfer of funds to IA To recognize receipt of funds from SA 

 
27. Records revealed that the Agency erroneously recognized receivables in the Due 
from NGAs and Due from NGOs/CSOs accounts amounting to ₱163,200.00 and 

₱863,200.00, respectively, without an actual transfer of funds to the implementing partner.  

Further, verification disclosed that the entry made was a mere setting up of payables for 

various expenses, thus, a corresponding credit to the Accounts Payable account. 

 

28. The recognition of receivables to Due from NGAs and Due from NGOs/CSOs 
account without the actual transfer of funds to implementing agency (IA) will not only 

overstate both accounts by ₱163,200.00 and ₱863,200.00, respectively, as well as the 

Accounts Payable by ₱1,026,400.00, but will also result in a reconciling difference between 

the SEI and IAs records, as the latter has not yet recognized liabilities in its records. 

 

29. Thus, the relevant amount of reconciling difference between the Agency and IA 
records, and the error in the recognition of receivables, affected the accuracy and reliability 

of Accounts Payable and both Due from NGAs and Due from NGOs/CSOs accounts as 

presented in the financial statements. 



33  

  

 

30. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to make 
the necessary adjusting entry to derecognize receivables in the Due from NGAs and 

Due from NGOs/CSOs accounts without an actual transfer of funds to IAs. 

 

31. Management has instructed the Accountant to be more careful in the recording of 
entries in the eNGAS to avoid the recurrence of error in recognition of receivables without 

actual transfer of funds to IAs. The Accountant admitted that it was an error on their part 

and explained that it was already corrected when the Institute released the funds in the 

succeeding year. The Accounting Unit also committed to be more careful in the recording 

of transactions and to review the transactions before the final entries are made in the 

eNGAS. 

 

c) Erroneous recording of advances to Procurement Service (PS) - ₱49,496.62 
 

32. COA Circular No. 2020-001 dated January 8, 2020, “Prescribing Volume III-
Revised Chart of Accounts (Updated 2019) to replace Volume III-The Revised Chart of 

Accounts (Updated 2015) of the Government Accounting Manual for National Government 

Agencies”, states that the “Due from National Government Agencies (NGAs) account be 

debited to recognize advances for purchase of goods/services as authorized by law and 

credited upon receipt of goods/services.” 

 

33. As of December 31, 2020, the subsidiary ledger balance of Due from NGAs- 
Procurement Service (PS) account amounted to ₱3,571.34.  Records showed that the balance 

remained to be outstanding and non-moving since 2018.  The Accountant disclosed that the 

amount was still unreconciled due to unavailability of sufficient documentary support, 
hence, could not be adjusted. 

 

34. Further, records revealed that advances to PS for the procurement of various office 
supplies were directly debited to Office Supplies Expense account. For CYs 2019-2020, cash 

advances granted to PS amounted to ₱324,819.17.  We were informed that the General 

Services Unit (GSU) is responsible for the monitoring of the balance of the cash advance.  

As of year-end, the GSU disclosed that advances to PS have a remaining balance of 

₱49,496.62.  The Audit Team already sent a letter to confirm the balance with PS but 

response is still to be awaited. 

 

35. In line with the foregoing, the erroneous recording of advances to PS in the Office 
Supplies Expense account understated the subsidiary balance of Due from NGAs-

Procurement Service account of ₱49,496.62. 

 

36. We recommended and Management agreed to require: 
 

a. The Accountant to make the necessary adjusting entry to recognize the 
remaining balance of advances to the PS in the Due from NGAs-

Procurement Service account; and henceforth, refrain from directly 

debiting advances to PS in the Office Supplies Expense account; and 



34  

  

 

b. The Accountant and the GSU to coordinate with the PS for the periodic 
reconciliation of advances granted and deliveries received to ensure the 

correct and reliable balance of the account.  

 

37. Management has already instructed the Accounting Unit to reconcile their records 
and make the necessary adjusting journal entries to recognize the balance of advances 

granted to the Procurement Service. Management also reminded the GSU and the 

Accounting Unit to coordinate with the Procurement Service to conduct a periodic 

reconciliation to ensure the correct balance of the account. 

 

d) Recording of inventory as an outright expense - ₱3,150,706.70 
 

38. Section 9, Chapter 8 of the GAM, Volume 1 requires that supplies and materials 
purchased for inventory purpose shall be recorded using the perpetual inventory system, 

resulting in a more accurate inventory records.  The system requires accounting records to 

show the amount of inventory on hand at all times through the maintenance of the Supplies 

Ledger Card (SLC) (Appendix 57) by the Accounting Division/Unit and Stock Card (SC) 

(Appendix 58) by the Supply/ and/or Property Division/Unit for each item in stock.  Regular 

purchases shall be coursed through the inventory account and issues thereof shall be 

recorded as they take place except for supplies and materials purchased out of Petty Cash 

Fund (PCF) for immediate use or on emergency cases which shall be charged directly to the 

appropriate expense accounts. 

 

39. Section 10 of the same Chapter provides that “tangible items below the capitalization 
threshold of ₱15,000.00 shall be accounted as semi-expendable property.  Semi-expendable 

property which were recognized as PPE shall be reclassified to the affected accounts and 

these tangible items shall be recognized as expenses upon issue to the end-user.” 

 

40. In paragraph 44 of IPSAS 12 also states that “when inventories are sold, exchanged 
or distributed, the carrying amount of those inventories shall be recognized as an expense 

in the period in which the related revenue is recognized. If there is no related revenue, the 

expense is recognized when the goods are distributed or related service is rendered.” 

 

41. It was disclosed that out of the total Inventory expenses of ₱7,489,457.18 (including 
semi-expendable items), purchases of various office supplies and other supplies and 

materials, except for supplies and materials purchased out of PCF, totaling ₱6,334,340.50 

were directly issued to end-users and recorded as outright expenses, instead of booking it 

up under the proper Inventory account. 

 

42. It bears stressing that all procured office supplies, including those regularly 
purchased in bulk, were immediately recorded as expenses upon receipt of the Institute and 

no record of Office Supplies Inventory account was reflected in the books for CY 2020. 

 



35  

  

43. The recording of inventories as outright expenses runs counter to the required 
Perpetual Inventory Method in recording inventories for proper control and monitoring, as 

it did not present the real figures in the inventory and expense accounts in a particular period. 

 

44. As at year-end, all Inventory accounts in the books had no balances.  The General 
Services Unit/Property Unit likewise informed that all supplies and materials were 

immediately issued to end-users upon receipt from the suppliers since there is no proper 

storage room for the supplies and materials, thus, there were no items that remained in their 

custody at the end of the year.   

 

45. However, the recording of inventories as outright expenses due to immediate 
issuance of supplies and materials to end-users resulted in a discrepancy between the latest 

submitted Report on the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) as of December 31, 2020, 

and the Inventory accounts in the books.  The RPCI showed that a total amount of 

₱3,150,706.70 of supplies and materials were still on hand with the end-users/departments, 

which was fifty (50) percent of the total purchases of the year amounting to ₱6,334,340.50, 

thus, affecting the accuracy and reliability of Inventory accounts as presented in the financial 

statements. 

 

46. We reiterated our prior year’s recommendation and Management agreed to 
require the Accountant to: 

 

a. Record all purchases of supplies and materials including semi-expendable 
properties as Inventory, except those purchased through Petty Cash Fund 

for immediate use or on emergency use, following the Perpetual Inventory 

Method to observe the policy of safeguarding the assets; and 

 

b. Make the necessary adjustments to recognize the total amount of actual 
inventory on hand to reconcile with the inventory balances reported in the 

RPCI. 

 

47. Management informed that the Accounting Unit will recognize the Inventory 
account upon the delivery and acceptance of the procured supplies and materials. The 

subsequent recognition of expenses shall only be made upon the issuance of inventories to 

the units. Regarding the semi-expendable inventories, the Accounting Unit is already 

following the GAM in using semi-expendable accounts as recommended by COA. 

 

e) Non-reclassification of semi-expendable property below ₱15,000.00 - 
₱15,578,640.54. 

 

48. Section 10, Chapter 8 of the GAM, Volume I, provides that tangible items below the 
capitalization threshold of ₱15,000.00 shall be accounted as semi-expendable property and 

shall be recognized as expense upon issue to the end-user. Those which were recognized as 

PPE shall be reclassified to the affected accounts. 

 



36  

  

49. Further, Section 11, Chapter 8 of the same Manual requires the issuance of an 
Inventory Custodian Slip (ICS) (Appendix 59) to the end-user of the semi-expendable 

property to establish accountability over them, which shall be extinguished upon the return 

of the item to the Property and Supply Division/Unit or in case of loss, upon approval of the 

relief from property accountability. 

 

50. Similarly, Section 17(g), Chapter 8 of the same Manual requires the Property and/or 
Supply Custodian to prepare the Report of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI) based on 

the Requisition and Issue Slip (RIS) and to be used by the Accounting Division as basis in 

preparing the JEV to record the supplies and material issued. It further provides that ICS are 

prepared upon issue of semi-expendable property covered by an approved RIS. 

 

51. Records showed that semi-expendable property previously recognized as Property, 
Plant and Equipment (PPE) were not yet reclassified to the corresponding semi-expendable 

expense account or debited to Accumulated Surplus/Deficit account for prior years’ 

issuances of semi-expendable property to end-users.  The summary of un-reclassified semi-

expandable property per PPE account is presented in Table 6:

Other Machinery Equipment 6,532.25 

Technical and Scientific  Equipment 869,413.95 

Total 15,578,640.54 

 

52. The Accountant explained that reclassification of semi-expendable property is not 
recorded due to incomplete reconciliation of records between the Accounting Unit and the 

General Services Unit/Property Unit and errors incurred in the e-NGAs. The Accountant 

committed that reclassification will be recorded once the conduct of the physical inventory-

taking of the properties are finalized/completed. 

 

53. Nevertheless, the non-reclassification of semi-expendable property overstated the 
PPE account and understated the Accumulated Surplus/Deficit account of ₱15,578,640.54. 

 

54. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to make 
the necessary adjustments to reclassify semi-expendable property once the 

reconciliation of records and the final inventory- taking are finalized/completed. 
 



37  

  

f) Misclassification of property - ₱14,034,761.25 

 

55. The Revised Chart of Accounts (RCA) (Updated 2019) defines the following 
accounts as follows: 

 

Other Assets - This account is debited to recognize assets not falling under any of 

the specific asset accounts. 

 

Other Land Improvements – this account is debited to recognize the cost incurred 

in the purchase or fair value, if acquired through donation or transfers without cost, 

of land improvements such as parking lots, landscape, walkways, driveways, 

covered walks, fences, roads within the agency’s premises and the like. 

 

Other Structures - This account is debited to recognize the cost incurred in the 

purchase or construction, or fair value, if acquired through donation or transfers 

without cost, of other structures for use in government operations or for income 

generating purposes. 

 

56. Moreover, Section 6, Chapter 10 of the GAM, Volume I states the “Costs not 
qualified for recognition as PPE”, and enumerates the following examples of costs that are 

expensed rather than recognized as elements of cost of a PPE:  

 

a. Costs of opening a new facility; 
b. Costs of introducing a new product or service (including costs of advertising 

and promotional activities); 

c. Costs of conducting business in a new location or with a new class of 
customers (including costs of staff training); and 

d. Administration and other general overhead costs. 
 

57. The reported balance of the Other Assets account as at year-end amounted to 
₱42,814,132.52, the details of which are presented in Table 7: 

 
Table 7: Schedule of Other Asset Account 

Code Particulars Amount

19999990-00-012-01 Various Equipment 11,528,399.20 

Total 42,814,132.52 

 

58. Records and notes to financial statements disclosed the following: 
 

a. Semi-expendable assets worth ₱4,050.80 were items ordered from Procurement 
Service not yet delivered under Agency Control Number AC#13P04-016 dated 



38  

  

April 01, 2014, as disclosed in the Notes to Financial Statements. The said 

amount was erroneously recorded in the Other Asset account. 

 

Since these items were not yet delivered by the Procurement Service, this should 

have been recorded in the Due from NGAs - Procurement Service account, 

should form part of the Agency’s receivables, and should not be recognized in 

the Other Assets account. 

 

b. The costs of office renovation with a total amount of ₱11,757,859.06 were also 
recorded in the Other Assets account, of which ₱10,747,150.06 pertains to 

renovation before the transfer/relocation of SEI’s office at the Science Heritage 

Building and the remaining ₱1,010,709.00 were incurred in 2015-2016.  The 

Notes to Financial Statements disclosed that recognition of renovation costs to 

Other Assets account were in compliance with the prior years’ audit 

recommendation.  This is because the building renovated was not owned by SEI 

but only given the right to use the property, hence, costs of renovation could not 

be recorded in the Building account. 

 

Be that as it may, the costs of office renovation before relocation may be 

categorized in the cited example under Section 6, Chapter 10 of the GAM, 

Volume I which should be properly recorded as an expense. 

 

c. The costs of shipping container storage and the setting up of parking lot, with a 
total amount of ₱2,272,851.39, were also recorded in the Other Assets account. 

 

As defined in the RCA, costs incurred in setting up of parking lot and 

procurement of shipping container van can be classified into Other Land 

Improvements and Other Structures account. 

 

The Accountant explained that as the land was not owned by the SEI, the costs 

incurred were not recorded in the Other Land Improvements and Other 

Structures account. 

 

59. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accounting Unit to 
make the necessary adjustment to reclassify the costs of office renovation, semi-

expendable asset, costs incurred for setting up of parking lots, and shipping container 

storage from the Other Assets account amounting to ₱14,034,761.25 to the Expense, 

Due from NGAs, and Property, Plant and Equipment accounts of ₱11,757,859.06,  

₱4,050.80 and ₱2,272,851.39 

 

60. Management has instructed the Accountant to review the Other Assets account and 
to effect the necessary adjustment to reflect the proper balance of the account. 

 

g) Erroneous classification of payment of honoraria to Other Professional 
Services, Scholarship Grants/Expenses and Training Expenses - ₱2,045,599.05 

 



39  

  

61. COA Circular No. 2020-001 dated January 8, 2020, also known as the Revised 
Chart of Accounts (RCA) - Updated 2019, states that “Honoraria account shall be debited 

to recognize the payment given to professionals for services in recognition of their 

expertise, broad and superior knowledge in specific fields and special projects.  This also 

include payments to lecturers, resource persons, coordinators and facilitators in seminars, 

training programs and other similar activities in training institutions including those who 

render services beyond their regular workload”. 

 

62. Records showed that the payment of honoraria to lecturers, resource persons, 
coordinators and facilitators were improperly recognized to Other Professional Services, 

Scholarship Grants/Expenses and Training Expenses accounts.  This also included 

honoraria to personnel assigned in special projects and those who are members of 

Committees. 

 

63. We were informed that it has been the practice of the Institute that transactions are 
classified according to the different divisions such as: paid honoraria under the Science and 

Technology Scholarship Division (STSD) were recorded into Scholarship 

Grants/Expenses, while expenses incurred by the Science Education and Innovation 

Division (SEID) and the Science and Technology Manpower Education Research and 

Promotion Division (STMERPD) were recorded as Training Expenses. 

 

64. The errors resulted in the improper classification of expenses totaling 
₱2,045,599.05, which ultimately overstated the accounts Other Professional Services, 

Scholarship Grants/Expenses, and Training Expenses by ₱654,872.14, ₱729,571.36 and 

₱661,155.55, respectively, and understated the Honoraria account by ₱2,045,599.05. 

 

65. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to 
observe consistency in the recording of transactions, and to properly classify the 

expenses to the Honoraria account following the Revised Chart of Accounts. 
 

66. In summary, the total misstatements in the Cash, Receivables, Property, Plant and 
Equipment, and Other Assets accounts amounting to ₱42.409 million represent 0.46 

percent of the total assets; while Accounts Payable account had misstatements of ₱1.026 

million or 0.98 percent of the total liabilities; and Accumulated Surplus/ (Deficit) account 

had misstatements of ₱15.237 million or 0.17 percent of the total equity as at year-end. 

Due to the significant impact of the misstatements on the FSs of the SEI, we rendered a 

Qualified Opinion on the FSs of the agency as at year-end.   

 
Accounting Deficiencies  
  

67. We also observed other accounting deficiencies amounting to ₱4,248.231 million 
which affected the reliability and accuracy of the reported balances in the FS as follows:

a) reconciling difference between Agency’s records and Implementing Agency’s (IAs) 
records - ₱967,128,549.22 

 

68. COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016 prescribes the guidelines 
and procedures in reconciling and cleaning the books of accounts of NGAs, Local 

Government Units (LGUs), and Government-Owned and -Controlled Corporations 

(GOCCs) of dormant accounts, unliquidated cash advances and fund transfers for the fair 

presentation of accounts in the Financial Statements (FSs). Specifically, Section 7 of the 

said Circular requires that: 

 

7.1 The Accountant shall conduct regular and periodic verification, analysis and 

validation of the existence of the receivables, unliquidated cash advances, and fund 

transfers, and determine the concerned debtors, accountable officers, and the 

source and implementing government entities concerned. 

 

69. Confirmation of fund transfer balances in various implementing entities disclosed 
the relevant amount of reconciling difference between the Agency’s (SEI) outstanding 

balances of fund transfers compared to the IAs confirmed balances, as shown in Table 9.

Total 1,234,233,996.33 267,105,447.11 967,128,549.22 

 

70. As can be gleaned from Table 9 above, a relevant amount of reconciling difference 
shows between the SEI and IAs records amounting to ₱967,128,549.22 or 78 percent of 

SEI’s outstanding balances.  The variances may be attributable to unrecorded liquidation 

and unexpended balances which have already been reverted to the Bureau of the Treasury 

(BTr), as informed by some of the IAs. 

 

71. Citing as example are the records of the Advance Science and Technology Institute 
(ASTI) and the Philippine Science High School (Central Visayas Campus), with the details 

presented in Table 10.

72. One of the prescribed duties and responsibilities of the Source Agency (SEI) is to 
require the IA to submit the reports and furnish the IA with a copy of the journal voucher 

taking up the expenditures.  The Accountant shall furnish the IA with a copy of the journal 

voucher.2  This can be a control measure to ensure that funds transferred to IA were 

properly and accurately liquidated and to inform the IA on the recording of expenditures 

for reconciliation of both accounts.  

 

73. However, Management previously noted that one of the major causes of the 
accumulation of unreconciled balance is the long interval of reporting/liquidation by the 

                                                 
2 Section 5.4 of Commission on Audit Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994 



42  

  

IAs being semi-annual instead of the usual quarterly reporting. In CY 2019, IAs were 

already required to revert to the usual quarterly reporting of liquidations. Management also 

conducted meetings with the scholarship coordinators and staff as well as DOST ROs 

accountant and project leaders to resolve the issues on liquidations and utilization of 

unexpended balances of fund transfers, in which IAs were given the subsidiary ledgers of 

their outstanding fund transfer balances to verify the same in their books and initiate 

reconciliation of balances with the SEI records.  However, as discussed in the succeeding 

observations, inefficiency in the enforcement of liquidation in the current year was still 

observed as there were IAs that did not strictly comply with the quarterly reporting of 

liquidations, resulting in a lower rate of liquidations. 

 

74. Due to the substantial amount of unreconciled fund transfer balances of 
₱967,128,549.22, it can be surmised that reconciliation between SEI and IAs records were 

not periodically conducted which is not only contrary to COA Circular No. 2016-005 but 

also affected the reliability of the reported balance of accounts in the financial statements.   

 

75. We reiterated our prior year’s recommendation and Management agreed to 
continue its effort in coordinating closely with the concerned IAs on the reconciliation 

of balances particularly those long outstanding, dormant accounts and completed 

projects by enforcing full settlement of fund transfers through the submission of 

Liquidation Reports and refunds of the unexpended balances to ensure that the funds 

transferred were translated into the recipients’/scholars’ benefit from the program. 

 

b) Accumulation of outstanding fund transfer balances - ₱3,162,407,051.64 
 

76. COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994 prescribes the rules and 
regulations in the grant, utilization and liquidation of funds transferred to Implementing 

Agencies: 

 

Section 4.6 Within ten (10) days after the end of each month/end of the agreed 

period for the Project, the IA shall submit the Report of Checks Issued (RCI) and 

the Report of Disbursement (RD) to report the utilization of the funds.  Only actual 

project expenses shall be reported.  The reports shall be approved by the Head of 

the IA. 

 

Section 4.7 The SA shall draw a Journal Voucher to take up the reports.  The 

amount to take up the liquidation per the RCI shall be net of the cash advances 

granted by the IA to its accountable officers in accordance with Commission on 

Audit Circular No. 90-331 dated May 3, 1990. 

 

77. On the other hand, the guidelines in the granting, utilization, accounting and 
auditing of the funds released to NGOs/POs for the implementation of government projects 

are governed by COA Circular No. 2007-001 dated October 25, 2007, which “requires the 

submission by the NGO/PO of the final Fund Utilization Report within 60 days after the 

completion of the project”. 

 



43  

  

78. The total reported balance of the Due from NGAs and Due from NGOs/CSOs 
accounts amounted to ₱5,381,631,961.65, the details of which are presented in Table 11 

below:

79. We observed that State Universities and Colleges (SUCs) consistently hold the 
largest share of the outstanding balance of fund transfers, of which ₱1,793,449,707.60 or 

65 percent of the total outstanding balance of ₱2,745,139,681.76 represent funds 

transferred to the University of the Philippines (UP) System. 

 

80. For CY 2020, the Agency as part of the implementation of the scholarship program, 
continuously transferred funds to various implementing partners.  Breakdown of grants and

81. As shown in Table 12 above, fund transfer releases for the year have a total amount 
of ₱2,735,413,502.62 which is 68 percent of the total prior year’s outstanding balance of 

₱3,993,719,563.08.  However, liquidation of prior years’ and current year’s fund transfers 



44  

  

are relative low with a total amount of ₱831,312,511.44 or 21 percent and ₱516,188,592.61 

or 19 percent, respectively.  As a result, the accumulation of prior years’ unliquidated 

transferred funds of ₱3,162,407,051.64 (₱3,993,719,563.08 - ₱831,312,511.44). 

 

82. Further, taking into consideration the previous year’s observations, there was an 
inefficiency in the enforcement of liquidation to various implementing agencies this year.  

The rate of liquidation for CY 2020 with a total of 21 percent and 19 percent for previous 

and current years’ fund transfers, respectively, are lower as compared to CY 2019 rate of 

liquidations of 49 percent and 29 percent of liquidations for PYs and CY balances, 

respectively, as accounted in prior year audit. 

 

83. We also noted and previously reported in our Annual Audit Report (AAR) on the 
SEI for CY 2019 that the accumulated outstanding fund transfer balances included long-

outstanding and dormant balances of inter-agency transferred funds (IATFs) which were 

already past due and had been outstanding for more than one to over ten years, wherein the 

probability of their liquidation was reduced or even became nil, specifically for those 

dormant accounts or outstanding accounts for over ten years.   

 

84. Again, as stated in our prior year’s audit report, Management should compel the 
IAs on the timely submission of liquidation reports seeing that these university 

coordinators and project leaders were fairly compensated through payments of honoraria, 

even to the extent of hiring a project staff to process the transactions of the SEI; thus, there 

should be no room for excuse on the delays in the submission of liquidation reports and 

supporting documents thereof.  In fact, Management may hold the payment of honoraria to 

coordinators and project leaders as timely submission of liquidation reports should be part 

of their project deliverables. 

 

85. Further, COA Memorandum No. 2017-010 dated May 15, 2017 states that there is 
a need for the Accountant to issue a demand letter to the Accountable Officer (AO)/ 

employee/recipient/NGOs to liquidate their due and demandable cash advances/fund 

transfers, this may serve as a proof of exhaustion of all remedies to collect receivables and 

liquidate cash advances and fund transfers as basis for the issuance of the final demand 

letter of the Audit Team Leader in preparation for the filing of appropriate charges by the 

concerned COA Cluster Directors before the Office of the Ombudsman (OMB) in case the 

accountable officers/recipient/NGO failed to comply therewith. In this case, the 

accumulation of unliquidated cash advances/fund transfers can be minimized if not totally 

avoided. 

 

86. We reiterated our prior year’s recommendation and Management agreed to: 
 

a. Require and consistently monitor the University Coordinators/Project 
Leaders/IA’s Accountants to strictly comply with the immediate 

submission of liquidation reports pursuant to the abovementioned COA 

Circulars to facilitate accurate and timely reporting; and 

 



45  

  

b. Enjoin the Accountant to issue a demand letter to recipients of transferred 
funds to liquidate their due and demandable fund transfers in compliance 

with COA Memorandum No. 2017-010. 

 

87. Management commented that they recognize the audit observations made by the 
Auditors regarding the accumulation of Due from NGAs and Due from NGOs/CSOs. The 

Institute is also closely monitoring the compliance of the Implementing Agencies (IAs) in 

their liquidations. They also admitted that there have been delays in the submission of 

financial reports and the institute has consistently tried to reconcile and demand for their 

urgent liquidation. 

 

88. As of current date, the IAs have submitted Financial Reports for the year 2020 but 
was received by the Institute only in the first quarter of the year 2021. This timing 

difference has been the main reason in the discrepancies in the balances per the SEI’s books 

and the IAs’ books. Naturally, the IAs would show a lower balance since they have updated 

records at year-end, while the SEI would have a higher balance at year-end due to the late 

receipt of the financial reports. The IAs gave the reasons for the delays and one of the most 

evident is their lack of manpower and the lingering effect of the pandemic and the persistent 

imposition of health and safety guidelines. 

 

89. In order to solve this issue, Management proposed during the planning activities to 
automate the disbursement system for the scholarship program. The S&T Scholarship 

Division and the Finance and Administrative Division would seek the help of the Land 

Bank of the Philippines (LBP) to help them utilize the LBP internet banking facility in the 

disbursement of scholarship benefits. In this scheme, the SEI through the LBP facility will 

be the one to release directly to the students their scholarship benefits, while the 

administrative cost will be the remaining fund to be released to the IAs. 

 

90. The Audit Team will monitor Management‘s compliance on the recommendations 
and the automation of the disbursement system for the scholarship program. 

  

Unreliable balance of Property, Plant and Equipment Account 

 

91. COA Circular No. 2020-006 dated January 31, 2020, prescribes the guidelines and 
procedures on inventory-taking, recognition of those found at station and disposition for 

non-existing/missing PPE items for the one-time cleansing of PPE accounts of government 

agencies to establish PPE balances that are verifiable as to existence, condition and 

accountability. 

 

92. Section 6.1 of the above Circular enumerates preliminary activities prior to the 
conduct of inventory-taking of which the Property and Accounting Units shall compare the 

latest Report on the RPCPPE/Inventory Report with the PPE ledger cards (PPELCs). The 

Property Unit shall prepare a list of PPE items which are recorded in the PPELCs but not 

included in the RPCPPE/Physical Inventory Report as well as PPE items which are 

included in the RPCPPE but not recorded in the PPELCs.  Both lists and the latest 

RPCPPE/Physical Inventory Report shall be submitted to the Inventory Committee.  These 



46  

  

documents shall be considered as inventory working papers and shall be used by the 

Inventory Committee as basis in preparing the Physical Inventory Plan (PIP). 

 

93. As of December 31, 2020, the reported gross balances of ten (10) PPE accounts 
totaled ₱180,176,796.82.  However, comparison between the accounting records and the 

submitted Report on Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) disclosed 

variances of the PPE accounts, as shown in Table 13.

94. Further, reconciliation revealed that variances between these two (2) records were 
due to the following deficiencies: 

 
a) PPE items recorded in the PPE Ledger Cards (PPELCs) but not included in the 

Report on Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE)- 

₱60,490,348.86 

 

95. Comparison of records showed that PPE items with a total amount of 
₱60,490,348.86 were reported in the accounting records but were not included in the latest 

submitted RPCPPE.  The summary per PPE account is shown in Table 14.

96. The General Services Unit/Property Unit informed that comparison of both records 
was also performed at their end and it was disclosed that some of the PPE items that were 



47  

  

still in the accounting records but were not included in the RPCPPE were actually already 

disposed. 

 

b) PPE items included in the RPCPPE but not recorded in the PPELCs - 
₱29,427,290.58

PPELCs or accounting records.

98. The Accountant informed us that in compliance with the above-cited Circular, 
Management has already created an Inventory Committee to conduct the physical 

inventory-taking of the properties.  

 

99. Based on the foregoing, the reconciliation resulted in a relevant difference in the 
PPE amount per books as compared to the amount per RPCPPE, rendering the unreliability 

of the PPE account balances, thus, affecting the fair presentation in the financial 

statements. 

 

100. We recommended and Management agreed to require: 
 

a. The Inventory Committee, in coordination with the Property Unit, to: (i)  
plan/strategize the conduct of and complete the physical inventory within 

the prescribed period; and (ii) prepare a Physical Inventory Plan which 

shall be approved by the Head of the Agency and submitted to the Audit 

Team at least ten (10) calendar days before the scheduled start of inventory- 

taking activities; 

 

b. The Property Unit to: (i) update its records based on the results of the 
physical inventory; and (ii) reconcile the same with the accounting records 

to come up with the reconciled balances of PPE accounts to be considered 

as the correct balance of the agency’s PPEs; and 

 

c. The Inventory Committee to ensure that all the guidelines as prescribed per 
COA Circular No. 2020-006 are strictly implemented. 

 



48  

  

101. The Institute, in pursuance of COA Circular No. 2020-006 dated January 31, 2020 
on the Guidelines and Procedures in the Conduct of Physical Count of PPE, has issued SEI 

Special Order No. 2021.038 dated March 2, 2021 which created the SEI PPE Inventory 

Committee. This is also in response to the audit findings on unreconciled PPEs of the 

Institute and to harmonize the records of the Accounting Unit and the GSU. 

 

102. The Committee already had initial meetings for the drafting of the inventory plan 
and the subsequent conduct of PPE inventory. However, we noted that the conduct of 

physical inventory was put on hold in view of the current situation due to the pandemic 

and the limited personnel of the GSU and the Accounting Unit.  Nonetheless, Management 

instructed the two units to reconcile their records so that initial steps are undertaken in the 

meantime that the physical inventory is on hold. 

 

c) PPE procured by IAs/recipients out of the received funds from SEI of 
₱17,250,972.07 and unidentified PPE items of ₱11,528,399.20 were recorded in 

Other Assets account 

 

103. Various PPE items were also recorded in the Other Assets account of which 
₱17,250,972.07 were misclassified and unrecorded based on the CYs 2008 and 2009 

Annual Audit Reports (AAR) as disclosed in the Notes to Financial Statements.  Back then, 

these PPE items were purchased out of the Grants-in-aid (GIA) funds of the Implementing 

Agencies (IAs)/recipients of transferred funds from SEI.  Section 8.4 of Department of 

Science and Technology (DOST) Administrative Order No. 006 s.2004 provides that 

equipment purchased out of GIA funds shall be recorded in the books of accounts of the 

Funding/Source Agency.  Thus, SEI as the source agency recorded the properties in the 

PPE account, notwithstanding the fact that it had no actual physical custody of these 

properties. 

 

104. However, Section 17 (b), Chapter 10 of the GAM, Volume I recently prescribed 
that “the implementing agency/entity shall record and monitor the PPE purchased out of 

inter-agency transferred funds when the PPE meets the recognition criteria and the 

Memorandum of Agreement/Understanding (MOA/U) provides that the PPE will be 

donated to the implementing agency/entity.  At the end of the project, the transfer shall be 

made in accordance with the MOA/U.” 

 

105. In this case, in order to comply with the recent accounting guidelines, SEI should 
verify in the MOA/U whether or not PPE will be donated to the implementing 

agency/entity.  Once determined, the Accounting Unit should drop/record any donation of 

PPE items to the implementing agency in the books of accounts. 

 

106. On the other hand, PPE items amounting to ₱11,528,399.20 were also recorded in 
CY 2019 per JEV No. 2019-12-007765, the details of which have yet to be provided by the 

Accounting Unit 

 

107. Moreover, we observed that these recorded assets were presented/considered as 
current assets in the Statement of Financial Position (SFP) as well as in the Notes to 



49  

  

Financial Statements. Current asset is any asset which can reasonably be expected to be 

sold, consumed, or exhausted through the normal operations of a business within the 

current fiscal year.  Hence, the properties recorded in the Other Assets account should be 

presented as non-current assets. 

 

108. In line with the foregoing and considering the relevant amount of the deficiencies 
noted, the reported balance of Other Assets account of ₱42,814,132.52 was deemed to be 

unreliable, thus, affecting the fair presentation of the account in the financial statements. 

 

109. We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 

a. Require the Property and Accounting Units to coordinate with the 
Implementing Agencies/recipients of transferred funds to conduct an 

inventory of the prior years’ recorded PPE items; 

 

b. Determine in the MOA/U whether or not the property will be transferred/ 
donated to the Implementing Agencies/recipients and prepare the 

necessary documents to transfer ownership of the property; and 

 

c. Require the Accounting Unit to: 
 

i. make the necessary journal entry to drop/record any transfer of 
property made; and 

 

ii. determine the ₱11,528,399.20 various equipment in the Other Assets 
account and reclassify these to the appropriate Property, Plant and 

Equipment account, if necessary. 

 

110. Management instructed the Accountant to coordinate with the Implementing 
Agencies/recipients of transferred funds for the conduct of inventory of PPE items they 

received per records and prepare document for the transfer of ownership of the property. 

 

111. On the issue of the ₱11,528,399.20, the Accounting Unit was directed to verify the 
composition of the balance and reclassify it to the proper PPE accounts. 

 

Compliance Audit   
  

Idle/unutilized cash not remitted to the BTr   

  

112. Retention of unutilized scholarship funds (SFs) of approximately ₱1.7 billion 
reported in prior years and an undetermined amount of SFs transferred to the 

Implementing Agencies (IAs) which had accumulated in the Cash in Bank-LCCA 

accounts of the SEI and the IAs, respectively, and had not been remitted to the 

National Treasury was contrary to Section 28, Book VI of Executive Order No. 292 

and Section 99 of PD 1445, thus, depriving the government of the much needed 

resources to fund priority projects.  



50  

  

 

113. Article VI, Section 29 of the Constitution provides that “No money shall be paid 
out of Treasury except in pursuance of an appropriation made by law.”  The only exception 

is found in Section 25 (5), Article VI of the Constitution, by which the President, the 

President of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Chief Justice of 

the Supreme Court, and the heads of Constitutional Commissions are authorized to transfer 

appropriation any item in the General Appropriations Act (GAA) for their respective 

offices from the savings in other items of their respective appropriations. 

 

114. Book VI of Executive Order No. 292, known as the Administrative Code of 1987, 
also provides in Chapter IV, Section 28, the Reversion of Unexpended Balances of 

Appropriations, Continuing Appropriations.  Unexpended balances of appropriations 

authorized in the General Appropriations Act shall revert to the unappropriated surplus of 

the General Fund at the end of the fiscal year and shall not thereafter be available for 

expenditure except by subsequent legislative enactment:  Provided, that appropriations for 

capital outlays shall remain valid until fully spent or reverted; provided further, the 

continuing appropriations for current operating procedures may be specifically 

recommended and approved such in support of projects whose effective implementation 

calls for multi-year expenditure commitments; provided finally that the President may 

authorize the use of savings realized by an agency during given year to meet non-recurring 

expenditures in a subsequent year. 

 

115. Executive Order No. 338, s. 1996 requires all government offices and agencies to 
immediately transfer all public monies deposited with depository banks and other 

institutions to the Bureau of Treasury (BTr), regardless of income source.  Section 3 of the 

same EO provides that disbursement shall be made by means of separate Modified 

Disbursement System (MDS) check series subject to the issuance of a Notice of Cash 

Allocation (NCA) and in accordance with accounting and auditing rules and regulations. 

 

116. In addition, Section 4.0 of Department of Budget and Management (DBM) Circular 
Letter No. 2013-12 dated November 21, 2013, requires that effective January 1, 2014, all 

NCAs for crediting to the Regular MDS sub-accounts for any month, whether part of the 

comprehensive releases or constituting additional NCA releases, shall be valid until the last 

working day of the 3rd month of that quarter.  NCAs released during the quarter e.g. 

February and March, shall be valid up to March 31, etc. 

 

117. Section 4 of Republic Act No. 7687 provides the creation of a Science and 
Technology (S&T) Scholarship Fund.  With this provision, the Advisory Committee passed 

Resolution No. 1, series of 1995, authorizing the transfer of the amount intended for the 

S&T Scholarship Fund from the regular fund to a trust fund, which is maintained at the 

LBP, Bicutan Branch. 

 
118. In the Annual Audit Report on the SEI for CY 2019, we reported that the Institute 
transferred funds from the Cash-Modified Disbursement System (MDS) to the Cash in 

Bank-Local Currency, Current Account - LBP Account (S&T Scholarship Fund), in which 

the unexpended balance had accumulated to ₱3,880,519,564.58 and had increased to 



51  

  

₱4,656,299,036.78 at the end of CY 2018 and CY 2019, respectively.  The Audit Team 

recommended that the amounts be reverted/remitted to the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr). 

. 

119. Details of the funds transferred and collections to the S&T Scholarship Fund are 
presented in Table 16.

 *Includes Other Collections and adjustments amounting to ₱21,653,543.12 
 

120. In compliance with the Audit Team’s recommendation, Management identified the 
amounts allocated for scholars who were terminated, suspended or had not reported to their 

respective DOST Regional Office/University Coordinators and SEI, and remitted to the 

Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) the total amount of ₱1,943,318,500.00 as of December 31, 

2020, and an additional ₱1,000,000,000.00 on February 17, 2021, leaving a balance of 

₱1,712,980,536.783.   

 

121. Despite the partial remittances of the accumulated unexpended balance, however, 
the balance of the S&T Scholarship Fund still amounted to ₱3,639,317,294.26 at the end of 

the year due to continued transferring of funds from Cash - Modified Disbursement System 

(MDS) to the Cash in Bank - Local Currency, Current Account - LBP Account (S&T SF). 

Hence, this was not in compliance with the Audit Team’s prior year’s audit 

recommendations - to stop the practice of transferring funds to the S&T Scholarship fund 

account for transactions without valid expenses/obligations, more so if the intention is only 

to avoid the lapse of funds or automatic reversion of the excess funds to the BTr; otherwise, 

discontinue the transferring of funds from Cash MDS to LCCA and directly release the 

payment of financial assistance and grants to scholars through the MDS.4 

 

122. Further, we noted that ₱2,735,893,502.62 or 83.37 percent of the total current year’s 
disbursement of ₱3,281,476,069.29 was transferred to various DOST Regional Offices, 

State Universities and Colleges, private universities and other implementers of the 

scholarship program. The funds transferred to IAs, however, were seven (7) percent lower 

compared to the CY 2019 grants/releases of ₱2,936,410,339.11. These fund transfers were 

considered as receivables and still form part of the Institute’s assets.   

 

123. It has also come to our attention that unexpended balances of transferred S&T 
Scholarship Funds were also accumulated in the Implementing Agency’s (IAs) trust fund 

account. The outstanding balances of transferred funds to IAs (Due from NGAs and 

NGOs/CSOs/POs accounts) amounted to ₱5,381,631,961.65 as of December 31, 2020.  We 

were informed by the IA that the unexpended funds were not returned due to the issuance 

                                                 
3 CY 2019 unexpended balance less total remittances (₱4,656,299,036.78 - ₱2,943,318,500.00)   
4 CY 2019 AAR 



52  

  

of a Memorandum dated January 5, 2021 by the SEI Director authorizing IAs to utilize the 

unexpended balance of S&T Scholarship program.  

 

124. It is worthy to note that the funds transferred to IAs for the implementation of 
scholarship programs were part of SEI’s yearly appropriations.  Hence, any unexpended 

balance of the funds transferred may be considered unexpended appropriations of SEI which 

should be reverted/remitted to the BTr once the purpose has been served.  Needless to say 

that unexpended appropriations shall not be available for expenditure except for subsequent 

legislative enactment or provided further, the continuing appropriations for current 

operating procedures may be specifically recommended and approved such in support of 

projects whose effective implementation calls for multi-year expenditure commitments.5 

 

125. It was previously advised in the CY 2019 exit conference that Management revert 
all unexpended funds or those considered surplus/excess and no longer needed or earmarked 

for existing scholars, and include the request for the new/expansion projects in the next 

budget proposal. 6   The SEI partly complied with the audit recommendation with the 

remittance of ₱2,943,318,500.00 to the BTr as of February 17, 2021.   

 

126. Further, Section 18 of RA 10612 enacted on July 23, 2012, otherwise known as “An 
Act Expanding the Coverage of the Science and Technology (S&T) Scholarship Program 

and Strengthening the Teaching of Science and Mathematics in Secondary Schools and for 

other Purposes” states that “the amount necessary to carry out the implementation of this 

Act, as specified in Chapter II, shall be charged against the current year’s appropriations 

of the SEI under the DOST.  Thereafter, such sums as may be necessary to augment the 

Science and Technology Scholarship Fund, as provided for in Republic Act No. 7687, shall 

be included in the annual General Appropriations Act.” 

 

127. The request for authority to use the unexpended scholarship funds may not be 
necessary as the law prescribed that the implementation of the new/expansion projects shall 

be charged in the SEI’s current year’s appropriation and shall be included in the annual 

General Appropriations Act, thus, the reversion of prior year’s unexpended scholarship 

funds is warranted.   

 

128. Based on the foregoing, the prior years’ unutilized funds of SEI of ₱1.7 billion  
including those accumulated unexpended balances of funds transferred to IAs which 

remained outstanding in the books and not remitted to the BTr, despite providing scholarship 

funds in prior years, is contrary to Section 99 of PD 1445, to wit: 

 

“Transfer of unexpended balances to the general fund.  The Commission may 

transfer at any time, from moneys appropriated for a specific purpose, to the 

unappropriated general fund any surplus balance standing to the credit of any 

appropriation or fund when the officer having administrative control thereof certifies to 

the Commission that there is a surplus in excess of the requirements, or that the work or 

                                                 
5 Book VI of Executive Order No. 292 
6 CY 2019 AAR 



53  

  

purpose for which the appropriation was made has been completed, indefinitely postponed 

or abandoned, and that there is no outstanding obligation to be paid therefrom.” 

 

129. Again, the continued retention of these substantial amounts of idle funds precluded 
the opportunity for the National Treasury to maximize the use of scarce government 

resources by minimizing borrowings, rationalizing cash management, and using these funds 

to finance its priority programs and expenditures.   

 

130. We reiterated our prior year’s recommendations and Management agreed to:  
 

a. Require the Science and Technology Scholarship Division (STSD) and the 
Accountant to: 

 

i. Revert to the BTr the remaining prior year’s unexpended balances of 
the S&T Scholarship Fund (SF) including grants intended for 

scholars who, however, defaulted and are no longer eligible/qualified 

to receive their benefits and all funds transferred to the S&T SF bank 

account without valid obligations; and 

  

ii. Stop the practice of transferring funds to the S&T SF account for 
transactions without valid expenses/obligations, more so, if the 

intention is only to avoid the lapsing of funds or automatic reversion 

of the excess funds to the BTr; otherwise, discontinue the transfer of 

funds from Cash-MDS to LCCA and release the payment of financial 

assistance and grants directly to the scholars through the MDS;  

 

b. Require the IAs on the immediate reversion to the BTr of the accumulated 
prior year’s unexpended balances of scholarship funds received by them; 

and 

 

c. Refrain from granting authority to utilize the unexpended balances of 
scholarship funds to the IAs. 

 

131. Management is aware of the provisions of the National Government to remit all 
unexpended balances to the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) which the Institute has been 

practicing consistently. However, the Institute was also allowed under Section 4 of RA 7687 

to create the Science and Technology (S&T) Scholarship Fund. 

 

132. The purpose of the S&T Scholarship Fund is to ensure that the full requirements of 
existing scholars are considered and to guarantee their continued funding, hence, the 

maintenance of the S&T scholarship fund.  In the CY 2019 Annual Audit Report, the 

Auditors instructed the Institute to revert ₱3,880,519,564.58 to the BTr, as it represents the 

unexpended balance of the S&T Scholarship Fund. Pursuant to this instruction, 

Management has reverted ₱1,943,318,500.00 as of December 31, 2020, and another 

₱1,000,000,000.00 on February 17, 2021.  Management is also in the process of determining 



54  

  

the balance of the total amount to be reverted to the BTr and will report to the Auditors 

when the Institute has reverted the remaining balance. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder 

 

133. The Audit Team acknowledged Management’s remittance to the BTr of the 
unexpended balance of approximately ₱2.9 billion as of February 2021. 

 

134. With regard to Management’s comment on our second recommendation, we referred 
only to the transfer of funds without valid obligation or if the intention is only to avoid the 

lapsing of funds, the purpose of which is to minimize the accumulation of unexpended S&T 

funds in the Cash-LCCA account. Further, we opine otherwise on Management’s claim that 

the Agency’s financial performance (obligation and disbursement) is remarkably 

satisfactory as it attained almost 100% utilization rates, and a big contribution to said 

financial performance is the transfer of the general fund to the special account on S&T 

Scholarship Fund. It bears emphasis that since the transfer of the general fund to a special 

account could not be considered an actual disbursement as the cash/fund is still in the 

Agency’s account, no actual disbursements or expenses have been incurred, as evidenced 

by the accumulated unexpended balance of the S&T funds in the special / LCCA account. 

 

135. Lastly, on Management’s comment on our third recommendation, although it has 
been the practice of the implementing agencies to ask for authority to use the unexpended 

balances of the S&T Scholarship fund and has been recognized by the SEI, the practice, 

however, circumvents rules and regulations.  S&T scholarship transferred funds should be 

used for its specific purpose and any unexpended balance at the end of the year should be 

returned to the SA or reverted to the BTr. 

 

Long outstanding and dormant received inter-agency transferred funds (IATF) 

 

136. Timely liquidation of funds received from Source Agencies (SAs) was not 
strictly implemented, thus, the accumulation of dormant balances of completed 

projects amounting to ₱3,929,663.71 under the account Due to NGAs, contrary to 

COA Circular Nos. 94-013 and 2016-005 dated December 13, 1994 and December 19, 

2016, respectively. Moreover, the unliquidated balances outstanding for over ten (10) 

years, without the corresponding cash accounts and no records found for projects’ 

dates of completion, cast doubts on the reliability of the balance of Due to NGAs 

account as at year-end and on whether the project was implemented and its outputs/ 

objectives were attained. 

 

137. COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016 was issued to prescribe the 
guidelines and procedures in reconciling and cleaning the books of accounts of NGAs, 

LGUs, and GOCCs of dormant accounts, unliquidated cash advances and fund transfers for 

the fair presentation of accounts in the Financial Statements (FSs). Specifically, Section 7 

of the said Circular requires that: 

 



55  

  

7.1  “The Accountant shall conduct regular and periodic verification, analysis 

and validation of the existence of the receivables, unliquidated cash advances, 

and fund transfers, and determine the concerned debtors, accountable officers, 

and the source and implementing government entities concerned.” 

 

138. Likewise, COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994, “requires the 
liquidation of fund transfers to implementing entities.” 

 

139. As of December 31, 2020, the reported balance of Due to National Government 
Agencies (NGAs) account was ₱56,371,998.92, the details of which are presented in Table 

17.

141. Records further disclosed that the above-enumerated projects had started from the 
year 2004 to 2010, the ages of which were already ten (10) years or more.  The Accounting 

Unit informed us that these projects were already completed, however, aside from the 

projects from the Department of Education of ₱2,259,384.31 and from the PCHRD of 

₱28,000.00 which were completed in 2004 and 2008, respectively, there were no records 

found to ascertain the remaining projects’ dates of completion.  Moreover, verification 

disclosed that the corresponding cash balances of these long outstanding completed projects 

that should be recorded in the Cash- Treasury Agency Deposit- Trust accounts were already 

nil. 

 

142. Be that as it may, the accumulation of these dormant and long outstanding balances 
without the covering cash to back up the liability accounts was due to failure to strictly 

implement liquidation of the funds received from the Source Agency which is not in 

compliance with the prescribed guidelines under COA Circular Nos. 94-013 and 2016-005. 

 

143. Strict compliance with the above Circulars through regular monitoring of project 
implementation and reconciliation of the amount received from the SAs shall effectuate 

timely submission of liquidation reports, immediate detection and correction of any noted 

discrepancies, timely return of unexpended budget that could have been used to fund other 

priority projects of the government, and ultimately the attainment of the project output/ 

objective. 

 

144. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to: 
 

a. Coordinate with the SA Accountant in the reconciliation of the long 
outstanding balances of completed projects by analyzing the accounts Due 

to NGAs against the Cash - Treasury Agency Deposit - Trust and effect the 

necessary adjustments for reconciling items noted;  

 

b. Enforce full liquidation of the amount received through the submission of 
liquidation reports and the refund of the excess unutilized funds to avoid 

accumulation of dormant and long outstanding unliquidated fund transfer 

balances; and 

 

c. Henceforth, strictly enforce the liquidation of fund transfers received 
within the prescribed period depending upon their nature and purpose to 

ensure the attainment of the project output/objectives. 

 



57  

  

145. Management instructed the Accounting Unit to review the long outstanding balances 
of Due to NGAs against Cash Treasury Agency Deposit and make the necessary adjusting 

entry to correct the balances. 

 

Inadequate supporting documents 

 
146. Liquidation reports submitted by recipient NGAs and Non-Government 
Organizations/Civil Society Organizations (NGOs/CSOs) were recorded despite 

inadequate supporting documents, in violation of the provisions of Section 4 of 

Presidential Decree No. 1445, COA Circulars No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994, 

No. 2007-001 dated October 25, 2007 and No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012, thus, 

affecting the propriety and validity of the disbursements reported thereof. 

 

147. Section 4 of Presidential Decree No. 1445 states that “claims against government 
funds shall be supported with complete documentation.” 

 

148. Post-audit of the sampled liquidation reports amounting to ₱219,642,465.09 
revealed that these were processed and recorded despite non-compliance with the prescribed 

documentary requirements embodied under the above-mentioned COA Circulars.  Some of 

the deficiencies noted were also reported in the previous year’s audit report, to wit: 

 
                                                              Table 19: Observed Deficiencies

149. As the transferred funds constitute the core operations of the Institute in the 
implementation of scholarship programs, it is Management’s responsibility to ensure that 

these funds are efficiently managed/utilized as planned and are monitored through the 

submission of required technical and financial reports by the implementing agencies, and 

that the same be verified and approved prior to recording.   Moreover, the inadequate/non-

submission of proper supporting documents for recorded liquidations, affects the propriety 

and validity of disbursements reported thereof. 

 

150. We reiterated our prior year’s recommendations and Management agreed to: 
 

a. Install a control measure to ensure that a review process on the validity and 
adequacy of submitted liquidation reports are undertaken prior to 

transmittal to the Accounting Unit for recording in order to establish 

accountability on the accuracy and validity of records; and 

 

b. Require all the fund recipients/IAs to submit complete documentation on 
liquidations in accordance with the provisions of COA Circulars No. 94-

013, No. 2007-001 and No. 2012-001; and Section 4 (6) of PD 1445. 

 

151. Management has already relayed this issue to the IAs and has presented to them the 
COA findings. The NGAs have commented that their resident COA auditors already 

subjected the supporting documents to post-audit, and therefore, they only forwarded the 

liquidation reports to the SEI. 

 

152. In the case of Civil Society Organizations (CSOs), the Institute already required the 
complete documents including vouchers and receipts. There were CSOs that already 

followed this instruction and the pertinent documents were forwarded to the COA Office as 

attachments to the liquidation reports. It is, however, admitted that not all the IAs follow 

this, and Management will be reminding them to submit the required documents. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder 

 

153. We emphasize that supporting documents such as, but not limited to, the Report of 
Checks Issued (RCI) were required to be submitted to the Source Agency pursuant to 

Section 4.6 of COA Circular No. 94-013 and Section 3.1.2 of COA Circular No. 2012-001, 

in the liquidation of transferred funds.   

 

154. Payment of honoraria to lecturers, resource persons, coordinators/facilitators 
amounting to ₱3,922,824.03 were not adequately supported with proper documents 

as required under Section 5.7.4 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012, 

hence, affecting the validity of claims. 

 



59  

  

155. Item 6, Section 4 of PD 1445 states that “Claims against government funds shall be 
supported with complete documentation.” 

 

156. Section 5.7.4 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 prescribes the 
following documentary requirements for the payment of honoraria to lecturer/coordinator, 

to wit: 

 

General Guidelines 

 

Payment of honoraria to lecturers, resource persons, coordinators and facilitators 

are subject to the guidelines provided under DBM Budget Circular No. 2007-1 

dated April 23. 2007. 

 

Documentary Requirements 

 Office Order 

 Coordinator’s report on lecturer’s schedule 

 Course Syllabus/ Program of Lectures 

 Duly approved daily time record (DTR) in case of claims by the coordinator and 
facilitators 

 

157. As of November 30, 2020, payment of honoraria to lecturers, resource persons, 
coordinators and facilitators amounted to ₱3,223,781.72 and ₱699,042.31 for CYs 2019 and 

2020, respectively, for a total of ₱3,922,824.03. 

 

158. Documents disclosed that the Institute adhered to the prescribed guidelines of the 
Department of Budget and Management and the Department of Science and Technology 

(DBM-DOST) Joint Circular (JC) No. 1, s. 2013 dated June 25, 2013, on the said payment 

of honoraria. This was consistent with the guidelines provided under DBM Budget Circular 

No. 2007-1 dated April 23. 2007, which both prescribed the following computation:  

 

Total Minimum Honoraria = (.023) (MSRmin) (T) 

Total Maximum Honoraria = (.023) (MSRmax) (T) 

Where: 

MSRmin = monthly salary rate of the lecturer, resource person, 

coordinator, or facilitator 

MSRmax = monthly salary rate of a Professor VI, Step 1 of SG-29; to 

consider the difficulty and complexity of the subject matter, 

professional qualifications, and position levels of 

participants 

T              = number of actual lecture/training hours 

 
159. Agency Heads have the flexibility to determine the rate of honoraria for the duration 
of the engagement of a qualified lecturer, resource person, coordinator, or facilitator, within 



60  

  

the range of minimum and maximum amounts computed in accordance with the above 

formula.7 

 

160. Although disbursement vouchers show that payment of honoraria to lecturers, 
resource persons, coordinators, or facilitators adheres to the prescribed computation, we 

have observed that disbursements were not adequately supported with the documentary 

requirements, particularly (i) Coordinator’s report on lecturer’s schedule, (ii) Course 

Syllabus/Program of Lectures, and (iii) Duly approved DTR in case of claims by the 

coordinator and facilitators, as prescribed in the above-cited COA Circular.  

 

161. The said documents support the validity of claims and help to ascertain the number 
of actual lecture/training hours which is a factor in the computation of payment of honoraria 

to lecturers, resource persons, coordinators, or facilitators.   

 

162. For instance, the payment of honoraria under JEV No. 2019-02-000551 to a 
Resource Person for the services rendered during the conduct of a two-day Scholar's 

Formation Program under the Filipino Patriot Scholar's Project which was held outside 

Metro Manila. The resource person was paid ₱30,337.55 for the two-day formation program 

based on the computation of total maximum honoraria with a monthly salary rate of a 

Professor VI, Step 1 of SG-29 and sixteen (16) training hours or eight (8) hours per day.  

Verification, however, showed that the resource person only rendered 2.15 hours of 

lecture/training based on the program of activities provided, thus, casting doubt on the total 

number of hours paid. 

 

163. Without these supporting documents the rate of honoraria paid might be deemed 
excessive as the number of actual lecture/training hours rendered in the conduct of seminars, 

conferences, symposia, training programs and similar activities cannot be ascertained or 

validated, thus affecting the validity of claims/payment. 

 

164. We recommended and Management agreed to strictly comply with the 
immediate submission of the documentary requirements prescribed in Section 5.7.4 of 

COA Circular No. 2012-001 on payment of honoraria to lecturers, resource persons, 

coordinators and facilitators. 
 

165. Management recognizes the audit observations and recommendations, and will 
ensure to abide by the relevant rules and regulations set by the Department of Budget and 

Management (DBM), Department of Science and Technology (DOST) and Commission on 

Audit (COA) circulars regarding the grant of honoraria to lecturers, resource persons, 

coordinators, and facilitators. 

 

166. Management will remind all its project leaders who will engage the services of 
lecturers, resource persons, coordinators and facilitators to include in their plans and 

programs of implementation the necessary documentary requirements for the processing of 

honoraria. Management will include this topic in the SEI Management Committee

(MANCOM) Meeting so that all Project Leaders will be aware of their duties and 

responsibilities.  Management will also instruct the project leaders to attach the required 

documentary requirements in the claim for honoraria as prescribed in the COA Circular.  

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder 

 

167. While we find Management’s justification for the payment of honoraria to be 
reasonable, it bears emphasis that all disbursements should be supported with the proper and 

adequate documents to enable us to check the propriety and validity of the claim. 

 

168. Honoraria amounting to ₱2,227,299.02 and paid to personnel assigned in the 
Special Projects were based on DOST Memorandum Circular No. 001 dated March 

12, 2009, contrary to the provisions of DBM-DOST Joint Circular No. 1, s. 2013 dated 

June 25, 2013 and DBM Budget Circular No. 2007-2 dated October 1, 2007, resulting 

in irregular expenditures.  Moreover, payment thereof was not adequately supported 

with the proper documents as required in Section 5.7.5 of COA Circular No. 2012-

001 dated June 14, 2012. 

 

a. Computation of honoraria not in accordance with DBM-DOST Joint Circular No. 
1, s. 2013 and DBM Budget Circular No. 2007-2 dated October 1, 2007 

 

169. Section 4.3 of DBM-DOST Joint Circular No.1, s.2013 states that “as token payment 
for services rendered beyond the regular duties and responsibilities of their positions, 

Honoraria for Assignment in Special Projects may be granted. 

 

170. Section 4.3.1 The total Honoraria per personnel for a month shall be based on 
productivity and quality of completed and accepted deliverables for the set timeframe.  

Hence, a special project plan shall be prepared, in consultation with all personnel concerned, 

subject to approval by the agency head.  Such plan shall contain the following details: 

 

4.3.1.1   Outputs or deliverables per project component; 

   4.3.1.2   Project timetable 

4.3.1.3   Personnel assigned to the special project and their duties and      

responsibilities 

4.3.1.4 Expected deliverables per personnel; and 

4.3.1.5 Estimated cost of monthly honoraria for each personnel 

based on work hours spent beyond the regular work hours, 

computed as follows: 

 

Estimated Honoraria, H =    Salary    1 Month 1Day 

 T hours                 Month     22 Days 8 Hours 

 

 

   Estimated Honoraria, H = 0.0057 (Monthly Salary Rate)(T)8 

 

                                                 
8 DBM BC 2007-2 dated October 1, 2007 



62  

  

Where:  

   Salary = Step 1 of the Salary Grade for the designated position 

   T = estimated numbers of work hours spent in the special project 

 

171. Section 4.3.2 The total Honoraria that may be paid from government funds for all 
special projects shall not exceed 25% of the employee’s annual basic salary pursuant to 

Section 44(e) of R.A. No. 10352 and as may be reiterated in subsequent GAAs. 

 

172. Moreover, Section 4.5 of DBM Budget Circular No. 2007-2 dated October 1, 2007 
states that “payment of the honorarium shall be made only upon completion and acceptance 

by the agency head of the deliverable per project component. 

 

173. Section 4.6 . The actual honorarium to be paid to each personnel shall depend on the 
performance rating to be given by the project management, as follows: 

 
Performance Rating % of Estimated Honoraria per 

project Component 

Outstanding 100% 

Very Satisfactory 85% 

Satisfactory 70% 

 

For example, if the performance rating is Very Satisfactory, the actual honorarium 

to be paid follows: 

 

   Actual Honorarium = 85% (H) 

 

174. Section 4.7  For rating purposes, the project management shall formulate a 
performance evaluation plan that is transparent and fair, and considers timeliness, quality of 

outputs, and other applicable work efficiency determinants. 

 

175. On the other hand, COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012 also known 
as the “Updated Guidelines for the Prevention and Disallowance of Irregular, Unnecessary, 

Excessive, Extravagant and Unconscionable Expenditures” defines Irregular Expenditure as 

an expenditure incurred without adhering to established rules, regulations, procedural 

guidelines, policies, principles or practices that have gained recognition in laws.  

 

176. As of November 30, 2020, payment of honoraria to science and technology 
personnel who are assigned to special projects and who rendered services beyond the regular 

duties and responsibilities of their positions or beyond the regular work hours amounts to 

₱1,807,699.02 and ₱419,600.00 for CYs 2019 and 2020, respectively, with a total amount 

of ₱2,227,299.02. 

 

177. The documents disclosed that computation of honoraria given to personnel assigned 
to special projects were not in accordance with DBM-DOST Joint Circular No. 1, s. 2013 

and DBM Budget Circular No. 2007-2 which are the specific guidelines issued on the grant 

of honoraria due to assignment in government special projects as cited above, but instead 



63  

  

adheres to the policy of Department of Science and Technology (DOST) Memorandum 

Circular (MC) No. 001 s. 2009 amending DOST MC No. 001 s. 2003 also known  as 

“Revised Implementing Guidelines on the grant of Honoraria to personnel whose services 

are engaged by the National Science and Technology System”. 

 

178. Based on DOST MC No. 001 s. 2009, honoraria was fixed at a specific rate per 
month depending on the level of position the personnel was assigned.  For instance, on the 

payment of honoraria with JEV No. 2019-12-000460, the personnel was assigned as a 

project/program staff, Level 3, with honoraria rate of ₱7,500.00 per month, thus, for the 

period of three months, the total payment would be ₱22,500.00.  

 

179. The implementation of the said Memorandum Circular clearly deviates from the 
guidelines set under DBM-DOST Joint Circular No. 1, s. 2013 and DBM Budget Circular 

No. 2007-2 as it failed to consider the productivity and quality of completed and accepted 

deliverables for the set timeframe.  Also, it was surmised that adequate planning has not 

been performed as special project plan containing details enumerated in Section 4.3.1.1 to 

Section 4.3.1.5 of DBM-DOST Joint Circular No. 1, s. 2013 was not provided. 

 

180. Further, project management failed to formulate performance evaluation plan for 
rating purposes that considers transparency and fairness, timeliness, quality of outputs, and 

other applicable work efficiency determinants.  These performance rating will be used in 

the payment of actual honorarium as prescribed in DBM Budget Circular No. 2007-2. 

 

181. In line with the foregoing, the payments of honoraria to personnel assigned to special 
project which is not in accordance with the guidelines set under DBM-DOST Joint Circular 

No. 1, s. 2013 and DBM Budget Circular No. 2007-2 are deemed to be irregular and 

disadvantageous to government spending. 

 

b. Payment of Honoraria to personnel assigned in special projects were not adequately 
supported with proper documents 

 

182. Section 5.7.5 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 prescribed the documents required in 
the payment of honoraria to personnel assigned in special projects: 

 

General Guidelines 

 

Payments of honoraria to officials and employees assigned to special projects are 

subject to the guidelines prescribed under DBM Budget Circular No. 2007-2 dated 

October 1, 2007.  Honoraria received from all special projects shall not exceed 

twenty-five percent (25%) of the annual basic salary. 

 

Documentary Requirements 

 Performance evaluation plan formulated by project management used as 
basis for rating the performance of members 

 Office Order designating members of the special project 

 Terms of Reference 



64  

  

 Certificate of completion of project deliverables 

 Special Project Plan 

 Authority to collect honoraria 

 Certificate of acceptance by the agency head of the deliverables per project 
component 

 

183. On the other hand, the payment of honoraria to personnel assigned in special projects 
amounting to ₱1,807,699.02 and ₱419,600.00 for CY 2019 and CY 2020, respectively, 

totaling ₱2,227,299.02 revealed that documentary requirements as prescribed in Section 

5.7.5 of the above COA Circular has not been complied upon.  

 

184. The documents attached to the disbursement vouchers to support the said payments 
were the Accomplishment Reports prepared by the assigned personnel and a certification 

from Management that the personnel had rendered services based on the submitted 

Accomplishment Report.  Further evaluation showed that accomplishment report submitted 

only showed activities performed without indicating the expected outputs/project 

deliverables as may be stated in the special project plan. 

 
185. The documentary requirements prescribed in the above COA Circular are consistent 
with the guidelines set under DBM-DOST Joint Circular No. 1, s. 2013 dated June 25, 2013 

and DBM Budget Circular No. 2007-2 dated October 1, 2007.  These documents help the 

Audit Team validate the correct computation of honoraria rates considering the details such 

as expected deliverables per personnel assigned to the project per project component at 

specified timeframes; cost by project component, including the estimated cost for honoraria 

for each personnel based on man-hours to be spent in the project beyond the regular work 

hours; and the performance rating of the personnel assigned. 

 

186. Based on the foregoing, the non-compliance with the requirements prescribed under 
Section 5.7.5 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 as well as the guidelines set under DBM-

DOST Joint Circular No. 1, s. 2013 and DBM Budget Circular No. 2007-2 

hindered/prevented the Audit Team to validate the claims/payment of honoraria to personnel 

assigned in special projects. 

 

187. We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 

a. Strictly comply with the guidelines set under DBM-DOST Joint Circular 
No. 1, s. 2013 and DBM Budget Circular No. 2007-2 on the computation of 

honorarium payment to personnel assigned in special projects; 

 

b. Adequately plan the implementation of the project by preparing special 
project plan considering the details enumerated in Section 4.3.1.1 to Section 

4.3.1.5 of DBM-DOST Joint Circular No. 1, s. 2013;  

 

c. Formulate performance evaluation plan for rating purposes which will be 
used in the payment of actual honorarium; and 

 



65  

  

d. Strictly comply with the immediate submission of the documentary 
requirements prescribed in Section 5.7.5 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 on 

payment of honoraria for special projects. 

 

188. Management explained that they were in good faith when they followed DOST MC 
No. 001, s. 2009. The MC was validly issued by the DOST pursuant to its authority as an 

overall overseer of the DOST system. The circular has been consistently used by the SEI in 

granting honoraria to special project personnel and the same rates have been used by other 

agencies of the DOST system.  DOST MC No. 001, s. 2009 provides a simplified rate 

computation and at times proves to be more cost efficient to the government as it fixed the 

honoraria rates depending on the task and position of the assigned personnel. 

 

189. Further, Management will also instruct the project leaders to attach the required 
documentary requirements in the payment of honoraria to personnel assigned to special 

projects as prescribed in the COA Circular. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder 

 

190. While we believe that Management was in good faith when it followed DOST MC 
No. 001, s. 2009, we opine that DBM-DOST Joint Circular No. 1, s. 2013 and DBM Budget 

Circular No. 2007-2 are still the guidelines that should be adhered to in the payment of 

honoraria, unless the DBM or any other laws repealed so. 

 

Direct payment of honoraria to other government personnel 

 

191. Honoraria granted were directly paid to concerned personnel who acted as 
lecturers, resource persons, coordinators and facilitators, and those who were 

assigned in special projects, and members of committees; hence, benefits received 

were not properly accounted and monitored for the 25 percent annual salary 

threshold and taxation purposes. 

 

192. Section 23 of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) of 1997 states that “A 
citizen of the Philippines residing therein is taxable on all income derived from sources 

within and without the Philippines. 

 

193. Further, Section 272- Violation of Withholding Tax Provision. – Every officer or 
employee of the Government of the Republic of the Philippines or any of its agencies and 

instrumentalities, its political subdivisions, as well as government-owned or-controlled 

corporations, including the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), who, under the provisions 

of this Code or rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, is charged with the duty to 

deduct and withhold any internal revenue tax and to remit the same in accordance with the 

provisions of this Code and other laws is guilty of any offense herein below specified shall, 

upon conviction for each act or omission be punished by a fine of not less than Five thousand 

pesos (₱5,000) but not more than Fifty thousand pesos (₱50,000) or suffer imprisonment of 

not less than six (6) months and one (1) day but not more than two (2) years, or both: 

 



66  

  

a. Failing or causing the failure to deduct and withhold any internal revenue tax 
under any of the withholding tax laws and implementing rules and 

regulations; 

b. Failing or causing the failure to remit taxes deducted and withheld within the 
time prescribed by law, and implementing rules and regulations; and 

c. Failing or causing the failure to file return or statement within the time 
prescribed, or rendering or furnishing a false or fraudulent return or statement 

required under the withholding tax laws and rules and regulations. 

 

194. Government personnel who act as lecturers, resource persons, coordinators or 
facilitators in other government agencies which are outside of their mother agencies, may 

be paid honoraria at such rates as may be determined by the agency authorities concerned.  

Further, science and technology personnel who render services beyond the established 

workload of scientists, technologists, researchers and technicians whose broad and superior 

knowledge, expertise or professional standing in a specific field contributes to productivity 

and innovativeness shall be entitled to receive honoraria in accordance with the guidelines 

prescribed in DBM-DOST Joint Circular No. 1, s. 2013 and DBM Budget Circular No. 

2007-1 & 2.  

 

195. Records, however, disclosed that honoraria were paid directly to the said government 
personnel and not to their respective mother agencies.  Honoraria directly paid to 

government personnel may not be reported to their mother agency, making it hard for the 

latter to properly account and monitor the amount of honoraria received for taxation 

purposes and for the 25 percent annual salary threshold. 

 

196. Although payments of honoraria were constantly deducted a ten (10) percent 
withholding tax by the Institute, honoraria received by government personnel are considered 

additional income in which, for taxation purposes, should be included/declared in the 

government personnel’s individual income tax returns.  Consequently, any taxes withheld 

by the paying agency should be supported by certifications which serve as a proof that 

applicable taxes had been deducted/withheld. 

 

197. Moreover, payment of honoraria entails some limitations particularly on the 
honoraria received for all special projects, which shall not exceed the 25 percent of the 

employee’s annual basic salary, thus, should be accounted and properly monitored.    

 

198. We recommended that  Management require the Accountant to remit to the 
respective mother agencies of the government personnel to be paid honoraria and 

ensure that honoraria received for all special projects does not exceed the employee’s 

25 percent annual salary.  
 

199. Management knows that the payment of taxes is a duty and obligation of every 
citizen; therefore, the Institute has been consistent in the implementation of withholding 

taxes. The Institute issues the corresponding withholding tax certificates whenever there is 

payment made so that it can be used by the concerned person in the payment of taxes. The 

withholding of taxes was done by the SEI in accordance with BIR Memorandum Circular 



67  

  

51-2018 and Revenue Regulation 11-2018 implementing the Tax Reform for Acceleration 

and Inclusion Act (TRAIN Law). 

 

200. Management, however, would like to express its concern on the payment of 
honoraria of government resource persons to their mother agencies. Although there is a good 

intention to ensure that proper taxes are withheld, and the 25 percent salary cap is monitored, 

Management sees the adverse effect of this arrangement in the implementation of the SEI 

projects.  The remittance to the mother agency will surely discourage government resource 

person to lend their expertise to the Institute because there will be delays in the payment of 

their honoraria. 

 

201. The disbursement system of the government is rather repetitious and circuitous at 
times; for example, when the payment is remitted to the mother agency, an MDS-Check is 

made and deposited to the National Treasury. Then the Treasury will confirm that they 

received the deposit and they shall issue a certificate which shall be used by the mother 

agency in their request to the Department of Budget and Management for the issuance of a 

Notice of Cash Allocation before they can finally disburse the honoraria to the resource 

person. This process entails time and manpower to the mother agency and this system 

certainly is not advantageous to all parties. The payment scheme would also in effect 

discriminate government resource persons as against the private sector counterpart who will 

not be subjected to the same rigorous procedure. In effect it will not only deprive them of 

additional income, but it could also entail loss of talent to the government. 

 

202. Management would like to retain its practice to continue payment to individual 
government resource persons their honoraria and consistently deduct withholding taxes as 

required by the tax laws. In addition to this, the institute will also require the government 

resource persons to execute under the pains of perjury a certificate that the honoraria they 

will receive will not exceed the 25 percent annual basic salary pursuant to Section 44(e) of 

Republic Act (RA) No. 10352. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder 

 

203. We acknowledge Management’s implementation of withholding taxes which is in 
adherence to the prescribed rules and regulations.  However, we believe that the income 

from honoraria of government personnel should be part of their taxable income and be 

declared in their individual income tax returns which should be subject to the corresponding 

individual income tax rates.  Payment of honoraria directly to the concerned government 

personnel gives them the opportunity not to inform their mother agency of honoraria 

received, hence, may not be subject to/declared in their income tax returns.  Further, it may 

be difficult for the mother agency to monitor the 25 percent threshold in the payment of 

honoraria to special projects.  

 

204. With regard to the repetitious and circuitous disbursement system of the government, 
we believe that the mother agency can formulate a process to expedite the payment of 

honoraria to government personnel concerned. Further, SEI Management can inform the 



68  

  

mother agency that payment/transfer has been made for them to immediately facilitate the 

payment. 

 

Other Compliance Issues  

  
Gender and Development (GAD)  

  

205. The Institute has substantially implemented the GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) 
by expending ₱1,821.229 million or 38.39 percent of its total budget of ₱4,744.175 

million, mainly attributed to its three major/flagship programs.  

  

206. Section 31, General Provisions of the General Appropriations Act (GAA) or RA 
11465 requires, among others, agencies to allocate at least five percent of their budgets for 

activities which relate to GAD. The preparation and submission of the annual GAD Plan 

and Budget (GPB) and annual GAD Accomplishment Report shall be subject to the 

guidelines issued by the agencies concerned.  

  

207. Item 5.0 of Memorandum Circular No. 2020-01 of the Philippine Commission on 
Women (PCW) provides that in the preparation of GAD AR, the Harmonized Gender and 

Development Guidelines (HGDG) Project Implementation, Management and Monitoring 

and Evaluation (PIMME) checklist shall be used in assessing the gender responsiveness of 

the major agency program/project based on its implementation/accomplishment report for 

attribution to GAD.  

  

208. For CY 2020, the Institute prepared GPB for 14 gender issues identified involving 
11 client-focused and organization-focused issues, and three attributed programs with 

allocated funds totaling ₱1,822,403,400.00 or 38.41 percent of its total appropriations of 

₱4,744,175,000.00, and expended ₱1,821,229,188.18.   

  

209. Verification of fund utilization in the submitted accomplishment report showed that 
of the total expenditures of ₱1,821,229,188.18, ₱1,820,921,399.00 or 99 percent were 

attributed to the three major programs of the Institute: Capacity Building Program in 

Science and Math Education, Accelerated Science and Technology Human Resource 

Development Program and Undergraduate Scholarship Program (RA 7687/2067).   

  

210. On the other hand, GAD client and organization focused activities, which constituted 
one percent of the total allocation, had only expended ₱307,789.18 out of ₱1,482,000.00 

budget allocation. Records showed that out of 11 GAD activities, only eight (8) were 

completely undertaken, while one was partially accomplished and two were not executed 

due to the current pandemic. 

  

211. It bears noting that the Institute was able to integrate gender-perspectives in its 
regular/flagship programs, nevertheless, implementation of GAD focused programs, 

projects and activities is also encouraged as it vividly describes the gender issues to be 

addressed.  

  



69  

  

212. We recommended and Management agreed to continue the integration and 
mainstreaming of GAD projects and activities in its operations with a budget of at least 

five percent (5%) of its total appropriations to address gender issues and gender 

responsive governance in compliance with the provisions of the GAA.   

  

Programs/ Projects for Senior Citizens and Differently-abled Individuals  

  

189. The Institute has undertaken activities for the welfare of the senior citizens 
and persons with disability (PWDs) amounting to P0.429 million.    
  

190. Section 32 of the General Provisions of the 2020 GAA or RA 11465 directs all 
agencies of the government to formulate plans, programs, and projects intended to address 

the concerns of senior citizens and persons with disability, insofar as it relates to their 

mandated functions, and integrate the same in their regular activities. Moreover, all 

government infrastructures and facilities shall provide architectural or structural features, 

designs, of facilities that will reasonably enhance to mobility, safety and welfare of persons 

with disability pursuant to Batas Pambansa Blg. 344 and RA 7227.  

  

191. In CY 2020, the Institute implemented/funded and organized various trainings and 
projects intended to benefit the senior citizens and PWDs with total cost of P428,930.59, 

as follows:

Force, thus, the amount was 
given up as per National 
Budget Circular No. 580 issued 
by the Department of Budget 
and Management.

192. The seminar to upgrade the Capacity of Older Persons was not conducted in view 
of the limitations on travels, observation of physical distancing, avoidance of mass 

gathering, and senior citizens as one of the immunocompromised as per issuance of the 

Inter Agency Task Force. 

 



70  

  

193. With regard to infrastructure, the SEI building has ramps and an elevator for the 
convenience and easy mobility of the elderly and PWDs which are regularly maintained 

by Management.  

  

194. We recommended and Management agreed to continue to integrate more 
programs and projects into its regular activities that will address the concerns of 

senior citizens and PWDs in line with the Institute’s mandates and pursuant to the 

objectives of the GAA.  
  

Programs for the Youth  

  

195. Pursuant to Section 33 of the 2020 GAA, the Institute implemented and provided 
allocation to youth-related programs/projects/activities, which are integrated into its 

regular activities, with total expenditures of ₱2.090 billion as at December 31, 2020.
