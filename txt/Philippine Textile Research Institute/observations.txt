PART II – OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

 
Financial Audit 

 
Accounting Errors/Omissions 
 
1. The Philippine Textile Research Institute’s (PTRI) Assets and Accumulated 
Surplus/(Deficit) accounts were misstated by P7,823,925.46, representing 2.84 percent 

of the total assets and P69,637.50, representing 0.05 percent of the net assets/equity of 

the Institute; thus, Management’s assertions as to the accuracy, completeness, and 

classification of the said accounts could not be relied upon.  
 

2. Section 27 of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) 1 and 
Section 15 of the Government Accounting Manual states that “the FSs shall present fairly 
the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation 
requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and 
conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, 
revenue, and expenses set out in IPSAS.” 
 

3. Moreover, Sections 111 and 112 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 requires 
agencies to keep the accounts in such detail as necessary to meet the needs of the agency 
and at the same time be adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or control 
agencies of the government; and that the highest standard of honesty, objectivity and 
consistency shall be observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate or 
misleading information. Each government agency shall record its financial transactions and 
operations conformably with IPSAS and in accordance with pertinent laws and regulations. 

 
4. In our audit of the Agency’s accounts, we noted the misstatements which were not 
adjusted as at year-end as shown in Table 1 below.

Audit" 

 

a) Non-recording of liquidations amounting to P96,000 
 
5. As at December 31, 2020, the account Advances to Special Disbursing Officer 
showed a balance of P285,167.18, which comprised of the following; 

 
Fund Source Amount 

Regular Agency P96,000.00 

Trust  189,167.18 

Total P285,167.18 

 
6. The balance of P96,000.00 under the Regular Agency Fund pertained to cash 
advances granted to two (2) Special Disbursing Officers (SDO) for the implementation of 
PTRI program/projects for CY 2020. However, audit of Liquidation Reports revealed that 
said amount was already liquidated but was not recorded by the Accounting Personnel.  
Details are presented in Table 2 below.

7. The Accountant explained that the recording of the above liquidations was 
overlooked before the closing of the CY 2020 books. Adjustments shall be made in the 
succeeding year. 

 
8. The non-recording of liquidation resulted in the overstatement of Advances to SDOs 
and the understatement of Cash-Collecting Officer and the appropriate Expense accounts 
at year-end in the FS of the Agency. 
 
9. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to 
record the liquidations and make the necessary adjusting entries in order to reflect 

the accurate balance of the affected accounts. 

 

10. In their reply dated April 12, 2021, PTRI Management commented that as per 
accounting records, journal entries were already issued to recognize the said amount from 
Advances to Special Disbursing Officer account to Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) account 
per JEV Reference Nos. 2021-01-0000200, 2021-01-000198, 2021-01-000199, 2021-02-
000179, 2021-01-000081 and 21-01-000082. 

 
b) The balance of Construction in Progress (CIP)-Buildings and Other Structures 

totaling P24,882,382.74 is unreliable due to non-reclassification of construction 
project already completed amounting to P7,701,562.96 to the appropriate PPE 
account; thus, resulting in the overstatement of Construction in Progress-Building 
and Other Structures account and the understatement of Building/Other Structures 
account at year-end. 

 
11. Chapter 10, Section 8 (g) of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for 
National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I, provides that during the construction 
period, all expenses incurred in relation to the construction of the PPE shall be taken up in 
the books as Construction in Progress (CIP) with the appropriate asset classification. As 
soon as the construction is completed, the Construction in Progress account shall be 
reclassified to the proper asset account. Likewise, all expenses such as interests, license 
fees, etc., during the construction period shall be capitalized. 
 

12. Further, Section 25 thereof provides that, “Betterments are enhancements to the 
future economic benefits or service potential of a capital asset, such as: 

a. an increase in the previously assessed physical output or service capacity; 
b. a reduction in associated operating costs; 
c. an extension of the estimated useful life; or 
d. an improvement in the quality of output.  
 

13. Betterments which meet the threshold of the applicable capital asset category are 
capitalized. Otherwise, they are expensed. Where betterment enhances the future economic 
benefits or service potential of a capital asset without increasing its estimated useful life, 



35 
 

the depreciation period shall remain the same. Where betterment increases the estimated 
useful life of a capital asset, its useful life shall be changed. The revised depreciation period 
shall not exceed the estimated useful life of that capital asset. Where betterment involves 
the replacement of an identifiable component of a capital asset, the original cost of that 
component and the related accumulated depreciation shall be derecognized. x x x. 
 
14. An entity shall capitalize the costs incurred for repair, betterment, enhancement, 
expansion or upgrade of existing PPE if the amount is material and: 
 

a. where the expenditure results in an effective increase in the future economic 
benefits or service potential that is expected to be derived from using the asset 
and the increase in future economic benefits or service potential will be 
realized;  

b. there has been an effective increase in the quality of the services provided by 
the asset beyond that previously determined; or 

c. there has been an effective extension to the asset’s useful life as a result of the 
expenditure.” 

 
15. Verification of the general ledger of the Construction in Progress-Building and 
Other Structures account disclosed that the one (1) Lot Repair and Renovation of PTRI 
Administration and Laboratory, Phase X (Part 1) costing P7,701,562.96, that was awarded 
to Red Diamond Construction per Notice to Proceed dated January 24, 2020, had already 
been completed during the year per Certificate of Acceptance and Turn-Over Report dated 
September 9, 2020.  Details of the payment history were as follows:

16. The duration of the project was 90 calendar days reckoned from the contract 
effectivity date which was January 29, 2020 up to April 27, 2020. However, due to the 
declaration of a lockdown brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, a work suspension 
was requested and granted from March 17 to May 15, 2020.  

 
17. The Red Diamond Construction, in its letter dated May 26, 2020, requested for a 
work resumption in view of the lifting of the Enhanced Community Quarantine over the 
entire Luzon region and this was granted by PTRI Director Celia B. Elumba, per her letter 
dated June 25, 2020, considering that the project will have to be completed not later than 
July 10, 2020. However, on June 30, 2020, the Red Diamond Construction requested for a 
contract time extension to July 28, 2020 instead of meeting the originally set completion 
date of July 10, 2020. The time extension was granted but only up to July 24, 2020 per 
TWG Recommendation letter dated July 8, 2020. The one (1) lot repair and renovation of 
the PTRI Administration and Laboratory Building, Phase X, was completed and its final 
inspection was requested for July 20, 2020. The Certificate of Completion, however, was 
issued only on September 9, 2020. 

 
18. Despite the foregoing information, the Accountant failed to reclassify the 
completed projects from the Construction in Progress account to a proper asset account as 
provided in Chapter 10, Section 8 (g) of the GAM, Volume I. 

 
19. The Accountant explained that reclassification was not made because there was 
Part 2 of the repair and renovation costing P5,419,587.35 that was awarded to the same 
construction company per Notice to Proceed dated September 21, 2020, and this was 
expected to be completed by January 16, 2021. 
 
20. Considering that Part 1 of the repair and renovation was already completed and 
accepted, it is presumed that the asset is available for use such as when it is in the location 
and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by 
Management. Therefore, it must be reclassified to the proper asset account and its related 
depreciation expenses be computed.  
 

21. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to 
reclassify costs/expenditures from the Construction in Progress account to the proper 
asset account once the projects are completed and are available for use as intended 

by Management, as provided in Chapter 10, Section 8 (g) and Section 25 of the GAM, 

Volume I. 

 

22. In their reply dated May 12, 2021, the Management commented that as of to date 
the Property, Procurement and General Services Section (PPGSS) is still waiting for the 
response of Red Diamond Construction with regard to the breakdown of the 
costs/expenditures since the project includes delivery and installation of furniture and 
fixtures, and equipment for them to know the cost per unit in recording the equipment to 
proper accounts which will be reflected in the Property Acknowledgement Receipt (PAR) 
to be used by the Accounting Section as basis. Once it is settled, Management agrees to 
instruct the Accountant to reclassify the said amount pertaining to the completed project 



37 
 

from CIP – Building and Other Structures account to proper asset accounts in compliance 
with Chapter 10, Section 8(g) and Section 25. 
 

23. In summary, due to the significant impact on the financial statements of the total 
misstatements amounting to P7,823,925.46, representing 2.84 percent of the total assets 
and P69,637.50, representing 0.05 percent of the net assets/equity of the Institute, we 
rendered a Qualified Opinion on the financial statements of the Institute as at year-end. 
 
Accounting Deficiencies 
 
24. Several accounting deficiencies were also noted in recording transactions totaling 
P112.348 million which affected the accuracy and reliability of the balances of FS accounts 
as at year-end.

Total P559,166,096.48   P112,348,271.16 

 

a) The balance of Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) totaling P441,610,794.24 
as at December 31, 2020 was unreliable due to the unfinished reconciliation of 
records between the Accounting and Property Sections, thus, resulting in an 
unreconciled variance of P20,956,176.58 between the property and accounting 
records, contrary to Section 42, Chapter 10 Volume I of the Government 
Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I.  

 
25. Section 42, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I provides that the Chief 
Accountant shall maintain the Property, Plant and Equipment Ledger Card (PPELC) for 
each category of PPE including work and other animals, livestock, etc. The PPELC shall 
be kept to record promptly the acquisition, description, custody, estimated useful life, 
depreciation, impairment loss, disposal and other information about the asset. For check 
and balance, the Property and Supply Office/Unit shall likewise maintain the Property Card 
(PC) for PPE in their custody to account for the receipt and disposition of the same. The 
balance per PC shall be reconciled with the PPELC maintained by the Accounting 
Division/Unit.  They shall also be reconciled with other property records like the Property 
Acknowledgement Receipt (PAR).  

 
26. The Property, Plant and Equipment Ledger Card (PPELC) (Appendix 71) – shall 
be used for each class of PPE to record the acquisition, description, custody, estimated life, 
depreciation, impairment, disposal, transfer/adjustment, repair history and other 



38 
 

information about the property. It shall be kept and maintained by the Accounting 
Office/Unit. 
 
27. The Property Card (PC) (Appendix 70) – shall be used by the Supply and/or 
Property Division/Unit to record the description, acquisition, transfer, disposal, and other 
information about the PPE. It shall be kept for each class of PPE.  
 
28. Likewise, the Property Acknowledgement Receipt (PAR) (Appendix 72) - shall be 
used by the Supply and/or Property Division/Unit to report the issuance of PPE and the 
acknowledgement of the end-user. 
 
29. As at December 31, 2020, the total PPE accounts of P441,610,794.24 with a net 
book value of P199,389,332.06 constituted 72 percent of the total assets of the agency, as 
shown in Table 5 below:

between the physical inventory count of P426,122,572.02 and the recorded amount of 
P441,610,794.24 as at December 31, 2020, the details of which are presented in Table 6:

31. The Property Officer acknowledged the discrepancies and explained that there is 
an ongoing reconciliation of PPE records between them and the Accounting Section. She 
further explained that as at December 31, 2020, the reconciliation process of their 
respective records was still ongoing. 

 
32. Thus, the existence of variances in the records between the Property and 
Accounting Sections rendered the balances of various Property, Plant and Equipment 
accounts as at December 31, 2020 unreliable. 
 
33. We reiterated our prior year’s recommendation and Management agreed to 
require the Accountant and the Property Officer to conduct a regular reconciliation 

of the recorded PPEs in order to avoid a recurrence of variances between both 

records. 

 

34. In their reply dated May 12, 2021, the Management commented that the Property, 
Procurement and General Services and the Accounting Section are still working on the 
reconciliation of PPE accounts. Initial results of reconciliation revealed that there is indeed 
a variance amounting to P8,700,861.20. 

 



40 
 

b) The reliability of the balance of Due from National Government Agencies (NGAs) 
account totaling P1,405,986.92 as at December 31, 2020 could not be ascertained 
due to (i) non-reconciliation of prior years’ balance of advances to PS-DBM, and 
(ii) over-remittance of taxes that caused a misstatement of the affected accounts. 

 
35. As at December 31, 2020, the account Due from NGAs showed a balance of 
P1,405,986.92, which comprised of the following; 

 
Name of National Government 

Agency 

Amount 

Procurement Service-Department 
of Budget and Management 

P1,399,122.92 

Bureau of Internal Revenue 6,864.00 
Total P1,405,986.92 

 
 b.1 Non-reconciliation of balances between PTRI and PS-DBM Records 

 
36. Examination of the subsidiary ledger of the PS-DBM at year-end revealed that the 
balance of P1,399,122.92 was increased by P305,094.37 or 28 percent from the previous 
year’s balance of P1,094,028.55. Analysis of the account showed that the increase was 
attributed to the funds transferred to the PS-DBM as advances for the agency’s 
procurement during the year totaling P619,813.40, which comprised of advance payments 
of P295,570.15 and P324,243.25 sourced out from regular agency funds and from Trust 
Funds, respectively. During the year, it was noted that PS-DBM made a total of 
P314,719.03 worth of deliveries and it was recorded by the agency as reflected in the 
General Ledger. 

 
37. We established in our previous year’s audit that a variance amounting to 
P957,797.06 was noted due to the non-reconciliation of the PTRI’s accounting records of 
P1,094,028.55 and the PS-DBM’s reply confirming the amount of P136,231.49, which was 
likewise acknowledged by Management. Inquiry with the Accountant and the Supply 
Officer disclosed that for CY 2020, reconciliation of records between the PTRI and the PS-
DBM had not been started. 

 
38. For CY 2020 audit, we sent out via email a confirmation letter to the PS-DBM on 
March 09, 2021, through the audit team thereat, in order to establish the correct balance as 
at December 31, 2020. 

 
39. The PS-DBM confirmation reply disclosed that the balance appearing in their books 
as at December 31, 2020 totaled only P354,894.60 resulting in a significant difference in 
balances between the two agencies. 

 
 b.2 Over-remittance of taxes to the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) 

 
40. Analysis of the accounting entries disclosed that the P6,864.00 balance booked 
under the subsidiary ledger Due from NGAs – Bureau of Internal Revenue was a result of 



41 
 

the over-remittance of withholding tax on honorarium of the Project leader for the 
implementation of the completed project entitled “Durable and Regenerable Biocidal 
Hydantoin-Grafted Polyester and Lignocellulic-fiber Containing Textile” under the Grant-
in-Aids (GIA) program of PCIEERD.  The project was already completed in CY 2017.

41. The amount of P72,128.00 remittance to the BIR included the P6,864.00 
withholding tax relative to the honoraria of the Project Leader.  However, on December 
29, 2017, the bank statement showed a debit memo of P6,864.00 charging the remittance 
to Cash in Bank-LCCA, hence, remittances were made twice that resulted in over-
remittance. The Accountant noticed the unrecorded transaction when the Bank 
Reconciliation Statement (BRS) for the month of December 2017 was prepared.  Thus, on 
January 1, 2018 per JEV No. 2018-01-001095, the corresponding journal entry was made:

          Adjustment for the unrecorded and erroneous charging of 
withholding tax remittance relative to the honoraria of Project Leader. 

 
42. The accounting entry made above was not actually an adjustment but an entry to 
take up the unrecorded erroneous remittance of tax to the BIR.  As a result, there was an 
over-remittance of P6,864.00, while the Cash in Bank-LCCA was understated by the same 
amount due to erroneous charging.   
 
43. The Accountant acknowledged that there was an over-remittance and opted to apply 
the provision for the tax adjustments as provided in Section 76 of the National Internal 
Revenue Code or RA 10963, wherein over-payments will be deducted from the subsequent 
remittances. The actual application/adjustment of the over-remittance will be made for FY 
2021. 

 
44. Thus, the above-mentioned discrepancies and deficiencies render the account Due 
from NGAs at year-end as unreliable. 
 



42 
 

45. We reiterated our prior year’s recommendation and Management agreed to 
require the Accountant and the Supply Officer to make representations with the PS-

DBM and reconcile their records with the PS-DBM representative relative to the 

noted discrepancies reflected in the books of accounts of the two agencies. We further 

recommended and Management agreed to take appropriate action to resolve the over-

remittance of taxes that has caused misstatements of the affected accounts. 

 

46. In their reply dated May 12, 2021, the Management commented on the observation 
as follows: 

 

I. Non-reconciliation of balances between PTRI and PS-DBM Records 
 

47. Management instructed to conduct the reconciliation between the Accounting and 
Property Sections first before meeting with a PS-DBM representative. Initial result of 
reconciliation revealed that Accounting Section has unrecorded delivery of P812,071.03. 
Hence, P281,857.52, out of the P1,094,028.55, remains unreconciled. 

 
I. Over-remittance of taxes to Bureau of Internal Revenue 

 
48. As per Accounting record, the amount of over-remitted tax was already offset in 
their tax remittance for the month of January 2021 as per Journal Entry Voucher (JEV) 
number 2021-02-000051 
 

c) The Due to NGAs balance of P116,149,315.32 as at December 31, 2020 includes 
the carrying value of equipment of completed projects not yet transferred 
amounting to P90,347,866.26 that are still awaiting transfer documents from the 
Source Agency. Furthermore, the Agency paid and incurred obligation more than 
the grant fund provided by the Philippine Commission on Women (PCW) in the 
amount of P786,002.34 and P976,509.24, respectively, contrary to Section 2 and 
Section 4 of PD 1445. 

 

49. Section 2 of PD 1445 states that “It is the declared policy of the State that all 
resources of the government shall be managed, expended or utilized in accordance with 
laws and regulations, and safeguarded against loss or wastage through illegal or improper 
disposition, with a view to ensuring efficiency, economy and effectiveness in the 
operations of government. The responsibility to take care that such policy is faithfully 
adhered to rests directly with the chief or head of the government agency concerned.”  

 
50. Section 4 of PD 1445 provides that the financial transactions and operations of any 
government agency shall be governed by the fundamental principles xxx “Trust funds shall 
be available and may be spent only for the specific purpose for which the trust was created 
or the funds received xxx”  

 

51. Verification and analysis of Due to NGAs account disclosed the following 
observations: 

 



43 
 

 c.1 Carrying value of equipment not yet transferred to the Agency amounting to 
P90,347,866.26 

 

52. The year-end balance of Due to NGAs account amounting to P116,149,315.32 
consisting mostly of balances attributable to various equipment purchased from funds 
received from different national government agencies for projects that were already 
implemented and those that are still undergoing implementation (see Annex  A - Schedule 
of Due to NGAs).  
 
53. Accounting records showed that P90,347,866.26 or almost 78% of the fund 
transferred represents the carrying value of various Property, Plant and Equipment as 
summarized in Table 8 below:

54. DOST Administrative Order 11(B), Series of 2020 dated September 02, 2020 
stipulates provision on ownership of equipment – “The Funding Agency shall initially own 
all equipment purchased using grant funds until such are transferred to the Implementing 
Agency or other implementers. The ownership of equipment may be transferred to the 
Implementing Agency including private institutions, upon completion of the 
program/project as stipulated in the signed Memorandum of Agreement, subject to existing 
government rules and regulations. The Funding Agency reserves the right to transfer 
ownership of such government equipment to government RDIs, HEIs or other private 
institutions through Property Transfer Reports (PTRs) or execution of Deed/s or Donation 
subject to existing government accounting and auditing laws, rules and regulations.” 

 
55. We noted in the CY 2018 Annual Audit Report that the equipment were acquired 
through GIA funds in prior years and were not recorded in the books.  Management 
informed us that the non-recording was due to the lack of documents needed to support the 
donation/transfer, like the Deeds of Donation or Invoice Receipt of Property from 
concerned Source Agencies (SAs). We recommended that the said equipment be recorded 



44 
 

in the books under the General Fund, once the required documents are secured from the 
SA.  

 
56. It may be recalled that when the equipment were acquired, these were not booked 
up in the Trust Fund, as these were directly charged to the account Due to NGAs upon 
delivery, acceptance and payment; hence, these appeared to have already been liquidated 
but were still in use by the agency. Section 17.b.2, Chapter 10 of GAM, Volume I, provides 
that “the Implementing Agency/entity (IA) shall record and monitor the PPE purchased out 
of inter-agency transferred funds when the PPE meets the recognition criteria, and the 
MOA/U provides that the PPE will be donated to the IA. At the end of the project, the 
transfer shall be made in accordance with the MOA/U xxx.”  

 
57. For CY 2019, we noted that equipment acquired through Grants-In-Aid (GIA) 
funds were already recorded in the Trust Fund in compliance with the audit 
recommendation. However, equipment acquired in prior years’ totaling P174,945,577.70 
although already booked up, lacked the required Deeds of Donation or Invoice Receipts 
for Property; hence, these were still not yet officially transferred to the agency.  Instead, 
the account Due to NGAs was restored; thus, it appeared that the funds transferred for the 
completed projects were not yet liquidated, thus, overstating the liability account of the 
agency.   
 

c.2 PTRI spent more than the GIA Fund provided by the Philippine Commission 
on Women (PCW) in violation of Section 9 of COA Circular No. 94-013 dated 
December 13, 1994 

 
58. Audit of the subsidiary ledger account disclosed that expenditures attributable to 
the project entitled “Empowerment of Women through Science, Technology and 
Innovation in Handloom Weaving Communities in Selected Areas in the Philippines” 
exceeded the amount actually received by the agency.  

 
59. The project was funded by the Government of Canada through the Global Affairs 
Canada (GAC) in which the Philippine Commission on Women (PCW) was designated as 
the lead executing agency with the objectives that align with the PTRI in the revitalization 
of the Philippine textile and garment industry through science, technology and innovation 
and that contribute to job generation and inclusive growth by improving the economic 
empowerment of women micro entrepreneurs and their workers in two (2) ways:                   
(a) improving competitiveness and sustainability of women’s micro enterprises, and (b) 
improving the enabling environment for women’s economic empowerment. The total 
budget was P6,627,500.00 with an implementation duration of two (2) years from February 
26, 2019 until December 31, 2020, as stipulated in the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) 
between PTRI and PCW.  

 
60. Moreover, Section 3 (1) of the MOA provides that the PCW shall release to the 
PTRI the project fund support based on the approved annual Work and Financial Plan 
(WFP). The schedule of releases of funds will be one hundred percent (100%) of the 
approved WFP, representing full release/payment upon submission of: (a) a fully signed 



45 
 

and notarized MOA; and (b) an approved WFP. However, on the first year of 
implementation, only P3,313,750.00 or fifty percent (50%) was released by the PCW to 
the PTRI and the remaining balance shall be released on the second year upon submission 
of the related liquidation reports. 

 
61. In CY 2020, the PCW was not able to release the remaining funds on its second 
year of implementation as expected by the PTRI due to the effect of the COVID-19 
pandemic as explained by the Project Leader. Thus, this resulted in financial struggles of 
the PTRI Management. The Project Leader further explained that they are in the process 
of a negotiation with the concerned officers of the PCW for the facilitation of the release 
of the remaining balance. 
 
62. As at December 31, 2020, the project reported a cash deficit of P786,002.34, 
wherein the PTRI Management made a total cash disbursement of P4,109,426.23 against 
the available funds of P3,323,423.89 as reported in the Fund Utilization Report (FUR). 

 
63. Furthermore, records showed that aside from the reported deficit, the project also 
reported an unpaid obligation at year-end totaling P976,509.24, as listed in the Schedule of 
Accounts Payable (DOST Form L), wherein a total of P940,982.32 was used for the 
payments of salaries of contractuals/job orders for the period covering May 2020 to 
September 2020.

Total 6,627,500.00 5,088,918.70  

  
64. As can be gleaned from the table above, the total actual expenditures attributable 
to salaries of contractuals exceeded what was budgeted for the project. The approved Line-
Item Budget (LIB) showed that the budget for the payment of contractuals/Job Orders was 
only P2,133,500.00, which comprised of P1,018,500.00 under PS and P1,115,000.00 under 
MOOE. However, as at December 31, 2020, the Institute incurred a total expenditure of 



46 
 

P3,102,546.84 for salaries of its contractuals/job orders, exceeding its budget by 
P969,046.84.  
 
65. Section 9 of COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994 discloses a 
limitation in the use of the Fund Transfer as it provides that - “In no case shall the fund 
transferred be utilized for the payment of additional compensation to employees in the form 
of allowances, incentive pay, bonuses, honorarium, or other forms of additional 
compensation, except as may be authorized by law or existing regulations, nor shall it be 
used to create new positions, to augment salaries of regular personnel xxx. “ 

 
66. The Accountant informed us that the excess payments were sourced from the 
available balance of the common funds which were also attributed to other project funds; 
thereby, violating Section 4 (3) of PD 1445 and Section 9 of COA Circular No. 94-013. 

 
67. Further, Management presented a copy of the Certificate of Availability of Funds 
(CAF) dated April 08, 2020 which was issued by the PCW and amounting to 
P2,897,325.18, as their basis to pay obligations/expenditures despite the cash deficits. 

 
68. Furthermore, we also observed that the Accounting Section did not maintain 
subsidiary records for projects under the General Ledger accounts for Cash-Modified 
Disbursement System (MDS), Trust and Cash–Treasury/Agency Deposit, Trust. The 
maintenance of subsidiary ledgers for every project under Cash-MDS, Trust and Cash-
Treasury/Deposit, Trust will help the Accounting Section to effectively monitor the 
movement of cash among different projects being implemented by the agency. 

  
69. We recommended and Management agreed to require: 

 

a. The Project Leaders to constantly coordinate and follow up with the 
officials of the Source Agency the request to expedite the transfer of 

equipment acquired out of GIA Funds by providing them the list of 

completed projects, together with the list of equipment requested for 

donation; 

 

b. The Accountant to maintain a separate subsidiary ledger among projects 
under the Cash-Modified Disbursement System (MDS), Trust and Cash – 
Treasury/Agency Deposit, Trust, to effectively monitor the movement of 
cash received by each project; and 

 

c. The Accountant and the Project Leader to:  
 

i) make representations or dialogue with the Philippine Commission on 
Women (PCW) to expedite the release of remaining funds so that funds 

being used from other projects can be restored and the remaining 

unpaid obligations can be settled; and 

 



47 
 

ii) limit the incurrence of expenses so as not to exceed the actual cash 
fund/budget from the Source Agencies, in adherence to Section 9 of 

COA Circular No. 94-013 and Section 4 (3) of PD 1445. 
 

70. In their reply dated May 17, 2021, the Management commented as follows: 
 

I. Carry value of equipment not yet transferred to the Agency amounting to 
P90,347,866.26 

 
71. The Management agrees that the previous COA audit observation in requiring the 
institute to recognize the unrecorded equipment purchased under Grant-In-Aid (GIA) 
projects to fairly present in the financial statements in compliance with Annex M of GAM. 
In the said annex, it illustrates that the Implementing Agency (IA) has the responsibility to 
record equipment purchased under Inter-Agency Transferred Funds (IATF) projects until 
transfer has been made. Hence, it would be appropriate to ensure that all equipment has 
been duly recorded or if there may still be unrecorded equipment and discrepancies 
between the records of Source Agency (SA) and Implementation Agency (IA). 

 
72. Nevertheless, the Management concurs with the recommendation to constantly 
coordinate and follow up with the project leaders the request with the officials of the SA 
to expedite the transfer of equipment acquired out of GIA funds by providing them the list 
of completed projects together with list of equipment requested for donation. In line with 
this, the Management has already issued several memoranda following up with project 
leaders for the 3rd time to submit the formal request to SAs for the transfer of equipment. 

 
I. PTRI spent more than the GIA Fund provided by the PCW in violation of 

Section 9 of COA 94-013 
 

73. The Management wishes to clarify that while it is true that the Institute spent more 
than the funds initially and physically transferred by the PCW, the total expenditures 
including unpaid obligations are well within the total budget of the project as per the 
Memorandum of Agreement (MOA). Hereby, only the cash allocation was utilized on the 
basis of the principle of the common fund system. As per Section 5.2.2.1 of the National 
Budget Circular (NBC) No. 573, Department of Budget and Management upholds the use 
if the common fund system to optimize the use of the available NCAs under the Regular 
MDS Sub-Account. 

 
74. This notwithstanding, the same principle applied to the common fund system under 
Trust MDS Sub-Account for the reasons below which led the Management to such action: 

 
a. When the country was put the enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) 

due to COVID-19, the Management started to worry about its people. 
During the time, only essential personnel were allowed to go to office 
including those who process the salaries and other benefits of PTRI 
employees. 



48 
 

b. For humanitarian reasons, one consideration was afforded to the PCW 
project particularly on the salaries of contractual personnel with the 
requirement of securing a Certificate of Availability of Funds (CAF) duly 
signed by the accountant of PCW. 

c. Upon having obtained the CAF from PCW, the Management applied the 
common fund system to pay for the outstanding payables in advance and 
prior to the transfer of funds. Please note that the majority of the 
expenditures paid at the time pertain to the salaries of the contractual 
personnel charged under the project who have not yet received their 
salaries since January 2020. The payment of salaries of contractual 
personnel was made in April 2020 covering the period January to April 
2020. 

 
75. Given the above circumstances, the Management firmly believes that it made the 
right decision for its people. This is also to reassure the public that the action done by the 
Management is not maliciously executed for the reason that the payment was made up to 
April 2020 only during the ECQ and did not pay the succeeding months to limit the damage 
caused, if any. 

 
76. Last May 10, 2021, the Institute has already submitted, through the accountant and 
project leader, the documentation required by PCW. And now, the Institute only awaits if 
there will be further comments from PCW. If none, hopefully, PCW will immediately 
transfer the funds for us to restore the funds used from other projects and settle the unpaid 
obligations. 

 
77. With these, Management will ensure to limit the incurrence of expenses to the 
actual cash fund from the SA in adherence to Section 9 of COA Circular 94-013 and 
Section 4(3) of PD 1145. 
  
78. For the recommendation on setting up separate subsidiary ledger per project under 
the Cash MDS, Trust Account and Cash – Treasury/Agency Deposit, Trust. As per 
Accounting Section, it has been implemented in 2021 with reference to JEV No. 2021-01-
000031. 
 
Other Compliance Issues 

 
 Gender and Development (GAD)  
 
79. The PTRI expended a total of P6,797,000.00 for CY 2020 attributed to Gender 
and Development planned programs and projects, which is within the five percent 

(5%) minimum requirement as mandated under Section 31 of the General Provisions 

of the General Appropriations Act (GAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2020.  

 

80. Section 31 of the General Provisions of RA 11465 or the GAA for FY 2020 
provides that “All agencies of the government shall formulate a Gender and Development 
(GAD) Plan designed to address gender issues within their concerned sectors or mandate 



49 
 

and implement the applicable provisions under RA 9710 or the Magna Carta of Women, 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the 
Beijing Platform for Action, the Philippine Plan for Gender-Responsive Development 
(1995-2025) and Philippine Development Plan ( 2017-2022).” 

 
81. The GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of the agencies, which 
shall be at least five (5) percent of their budgets. For this purpose, activities currently being 
undertaken by agencies which relate to GAD or those that contribute to poverty alleviation, 
economic empowerment especially of marginalized women, protection, promotion, and 
fulfillment of women’s human rights, and practice of gender-responsive governance are 
considered sufficient compliance with said requirement. Utilization of the GAD budget 
shall be evaluated based on the GAD performance indicators identified by said agencies. 

 
82. Moreover, Item V of COA Circular No. 2014-001 dated March 18, 2014 provides 
that the audited agency shall submit a copy of the Annual GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) to 
the COA Audit Team assigned to the agency within five (5) working days from the receipt 
of the approved plan from the PCW or their mother or central offices, as the case maybe. 
Likewise, a copy of the corresponding Accomplishment Report shall be furnished the said 
Audit Team within five (5) working days from the end of January of the preceding year. 
  
83. For CY 2020, the PTRI total appropriations amounted to P116,598,000.00. The 
GAD activities in the GAD Plan with related budgets and actual expenditures are shown 
in Annex B. 

          
84. As observed in Item 7 of the GAD Accomplishment Report (as shown in Annex 
B), the Institute fell short with their target. The focal person explained that the activity was 
not able to meet the budget as planned due to the unforeseen declaration of the Community 
Quarantines and Inter Agency Task Force (IATF) protocols which limits out of town events 
and activities. The focal person further explained that the activity was meant to be 
undertaken during the DOST-PTRI annual planning workshops usually conducted at a 
different venue. 
              
85. We recommended and Management agreed to continue to integrate at least 
5% of its budget allocation for the GAD, in accordance with the General Provisions 

of the General Appropriations Act.  

 
Senior Citizens and Persons with Disability  
 
86. Management provided funds totaling P4,000.00 for the enhancement of the 
well-being of senior citizens and persons with disability, consistent with the intended 

purpose of Section 32 of the GAA for FY 2020. 

 

87. Section 32 of the FY 2020 GAA directs all agencies of the government to formulate 
plans, programs and projects intended to address the concerns of senior citizens and 
persons with disability, insofar as it relates to their mandated functions, and integrate the 
same in their regular activities. Moreover, all government infrastructures and facilities shall 



50 
 

provide architectural or structural features, designs, of facilities that will reasonably 
enhance the mobility, safety and welfare of persons with disability pursuant to Batas 
Pambansa Blg. 344 and RA 7227, as amended. 
 
88. For CY 2020, the PTRI allocated the amount P4,000.00 to implement programs 
intended to address the concerns and welfare of senior citizens and persons with disability. 

 
89.    The following programs and projects as identified in the Senior Citizen and PWD 
Plan with related target, actual results and expenditures are shown below:

90. In connection with the Technology Transfer Diffusion Program, the PTRI fell short 
with their targets for CY 2020 as shown in the table above due to the effect brought about 
by the COVID-19 pandemic, wherein only one (1) training course was conducted and 
participated in by only five (5) out of the 25 targeted participants from Region IV-A 
(Cavite). 

 
91. For the Promotion of Wellness and Safety Protection Program, the agency met its 
target by way of conducting a (Walkathon) Fun Run Event for the victims of the Taal 
Volcano eruption that happened in the first quarter of 2020. During the year, PTRI also 
conducted 13 webinars relative to Mental Health Awareness. 

            
92. Moreover, PTRI had included in its Repair and Renovation of PTRI Main Building 
Phase IX plan the provision of PWD/Senior Citizen Comfort Room, which is expected to 
be completed in CY 2020. 

 
93. We recommended and Management agreed to continue to allocate funds and 
implement its programs intended to address the concerns and welfare of senior 

citizens and persons with disability, insofar as it relates to the agency’s mandated 

functions.

Youth Development 
 
94. Management has provided support to youth development activities as 
advocated in the GAA by accepting students from different colleges and universities 

to undergo on-the-job training necessary for the completion of their academic 

requirements. 
 

95. Section 33 of the FY 2020 GAA encouraged all agencies of the government to 
provide for allocations and activities within the framework of the Philippine Youth 
Development Plan (PYDP) 2017-2022. 

 
96. The youth are considered as the hope and future of the nation. Thus, the PYDP 
2017-2022 was launched which intends to promote the active and meaningful participation 
of our young citizens in the Administration’s agenda on education, health, environmental 
protection, good governance and the promotion of lasting peace and stability. Indeed, 
engagement of the youth will prepare them in fulfilling their destiny as future leaders of 
our nation. 

 
97. In order to promote the government’s drive towards the development of our youth, 
the agency has provided in CY 2020 training and assistance to two (2) students out of the 
six (6) students from various colleges and universities who applied and were required to 
undergo the internship program necessary for the completion of their academic curriculum. 
The remaining four (4) applicants for the internship program, however, have declined in 
CY 2020 due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, Management has provided 
support to youth development activities as advocated in the GAA and PYDP 2017-2022.  
 
98. We commend Management for continuously providing support to youth 
development activities that will enhance the capabilities and contribute to the 

development of the Youth. 

 

99. In their reply dated April 26, 2021, the Management commented that they will 
continuously provide support to youth development activities and will have other related 
activities that will enhance their capabilities and contribute to the development of the 
Youth. 
 
Compliance with tax laws and on proper deduction and remittance of GSIS, Pag-IBIG 
and PhilHealth premiums

required taxes, premiums and loan installments and remitted the same as well as the 
government share within the prescribed period to the concerned institutions or agencies. 
Details are shown in Table 11.

101. We recommended and Management agreed to ensure its faithful compliance 
with the required deductions and remittances of its employees’ contributions and the 

government share to the BIR, GSIS, PhilHealth, and Pag-IBIG.  

Property Insurance 

102. Office Building and properties stored therein, although covered by the 
General Insurance Fund of the GSIS, were not insured adequately, thus, exposing the 

agency to risk of non-indemnification and to unnecessary losses in the event of 

damage or loss caused by natural calamities such as earthquake, storm and other 

causes beyond the insurance limits. 

 
103. Section 2 of Republic Act (RA) No. 656, otherwise known as the Property 
Insurance Law, provides that “in order to indemnify or compensate the Government as 
defined in this Act for any damage to, or loss of, its properties due to fire, earthquake, 
storm, or other casualty, there is hereby established the "Property Insurance Fund", which 
shall consist of all moneys resulting from the liquidation of the insurance constituted in 
Section 340 of the Revised Administrative Code and from premiums and other incomes. ”  

 
104. Likewise, Section 5 further states that “every government, except a municipal 
government below first class, is hereby required to insure its properties with the Fund 
against any insurable risk herein provided and pay the premiums thereon, which, however, 
shall not exceed the premiums charged by private insurance companies.” 
 
105. Moreover, COA Circular No. 92-390 dated November 17, 1992, requires all Heads 
of national agencies, local government units and government owned or controlled 
corporations to prepare and submit the inventory of all insurable physical assets not later 
than October 31 annually to the GSIS and in ensuring that all insurable assets and properties 
of the Government are adequately covered/insured with the General Insurance Fund of the 
GSIS. 
 
106. Records disclosed that for CY 2020, the agency paid an insurance premium of 
P578,927.09 for the protection of its Property, Plant and Equipment (PPEs).  These PPEs 
include office building, machineries, office equipment, information and communication 
technology equipment, furniture and fixture, and other property, plant and equipment with 
a total acquisition cost of P231,139,494.80. The summary of Insurable Property is 
presented below:

            TOTAL P231,139,494.80 

 
107. We observed that the renewed property insurance for CY 2020 covering the period 
January 1 to December 31, 2020 per GSIS Insurance Policy No. FI-NM- GSISHO-0035284 
dated October 22, 2020 was limited to damage/loss from fire and excluded the damage or 
loss caused by natural calamities such as earthquake, storm, etc. as prescribed under 
Section 2 of RA 656.  The insurance coverage should have included earthquake considering 
that the agency’s office buildings are situated/located along an area transected/traversed by 
two fault lines of the West Valley Fault.   
 
108. In recent years, the weather conditions in the Philippines have drastically changed. 
Typhoons and floods continue to increase, becoming stronger and more frequent, and 
earthquake is a risk that the country has to face. According to the Philippine Institute of 
Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS), the West Valley Fault tends to move in 400-
year intervals and could potentially trigger a magnitude 7.2 earthquake and can devastate 
cities along the fault line.  

 
109. Management had initially applied for its insurance coverage for CY 2020 which 
covered fire and lightning, full earthquake, typhoon and extended cover allied for a total 
premium of P1,022,714.92. However, due to insufficient funds, the PTRI requested the 
GSIS per its letter dated October 05, 2020 to exclude earthquake coverage for them to 
facilitate the processing of payment and utilize the agency’s remaining balance appropriate 
for insurance, hence, paid only P 578,927.09. 
  
110. The inadequacy of insurance coverage of real assets and other properties not only 
deprives the PTRI of adequate and reliable protection against any damage to or loss of their 
properties, but ultimately exposes the agency to the risk of non-indemnification and to 
unnecessary losses in the event of damage or loss caused by calamities such as earthquake, 
storm, flood, theft and other causes beyond the insurance limits.   
 
111. We recommended and Management agreed to require its authorized and 
responsible officials to: 

 

a. upgrade the insurance coverage for the PTRI insurable properties against 
all natural and man-made calamities, and 

 

b. incorporate in its annual appropriation the amount necessary to cover the 
increase in premiums relative to the insurance upgrade. 

 



55 
 

112. In their reply dated May 06, 2021, the Management commented that through their 
Property Officer, they had already submitted to GSIS last April 28, 2021 the upgraded 
insurance coverage for the renewal of PTRI insurance properties for the CY 2021 
which includes Fire, Lightning, and Earthquake. Moreover, the Management will 
ensure that insurance policy will be incorporated in its annual appropriations the 
amount necessary to cover the increase in premiums relative to the insurance upgrade 
for CY 2022. 

Hiring of Contractual/Job Order Employees 

113. To implement its programs/activities for CY 2020, the agency hired a total of 53 
contractual/Job Order employees representing an additional workforce of 65% to the 81 
regular plantilla employees, to provide administrative and technical assistance. The agency 
paid a total of P12,707,489.87, of which a total of P6,184,266.48 was charged to the 
Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE) of the General Fund and a total of 
P6,523,223.39 against the Project Funds.
