The low absorption capacity of the Agency during the year was due to late release 

of funds relative for the following SARO and projects as specified below: 

a) SARO-BMB-F-20-0020741 dated December 1, 2020 under Agency Specific 

Budget intended for the Congress Introduced Project “Enhancing the Product 

of Abaca” in the amount of P11,476,000.00  with  corresponding obligations of  

P10,034,826.39 as of December 31, 2020. 

b) SARO-BMB-F-20-0018322 dated October 29, 2020 under Special Purpose 

Fund intended for the project “Establishment of a Medical Textile Testing 

Center” in the amount of P77,680,000.00 with corresponding obligations of    

P3,534,024.23 as of December 31, 2020. 

C. Scope of Audit 
 

 The audit covered the accounts and operations of the PTRI for the year ended 

December 31, 2020. The audit was conducted to: (a) verify the level of assurance that 

maybe placed on management’s assertions on the financial statements; (b) recommend 

agency improvement opportunities; and, (c) determine the propriety of transactions as 

well as the extent of compliance with pertinent laws, rules and regulations.  

 

D. Independent Auditor’s Report 
 

A Qualified Opinion was rendered on the financial statements of the PTRI as at 

December 31, 2020 for the misstatements amounting to P7,823,925.46, representing 2.84 



 

iii 

 

percent of the total assets and P69,637.50, representing 0.05 percent of the net 

assets/equity of the Institute at year-end. 

 

E. Summary of  Significant Observations and Recommendations 
 

The observations and recommendations are discussed in detail in Part II of the 

report, the most significant of which are as follows: 

 

Financial Audit 

 

Accounting Error 

 

1. The Philippine Textile Research Institute’s (PTRI) Assets and Accumulated 
Surplus/(Deficit) accounts were misstated by P7,823,925.46, representing 2.84 percent of 

the total assets and P69,637.50, representing 0.05 percent of the net assets/equity of the 

Institute; thus, Management’s assertions as to the accuracy, completeness, and 

classification of the said accounts could not be relied upon. 
 

a) Non-recording of liquidations amounting to P96,000 
 

b) The balance of Construction in Progress (CIP)-Buildings and Other Structures 
totaling P24,882,382.74 is unreliable due to non-reclassification of construction 

project already completed amounting to P7,701,562.96 to the appropriate PPE 

account; thus, resulting in the overstatement of Construction in Progress-Building 

and Other Structures account and the understatement of Building/Other Structures 

account at year-end. 
 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 

a. instruct the Accountant to record the liquidations and make necessary 
adjusting entries in order to reflect the accurate balance of the affected 

accounts; and 
 

b. require the Accountant to reclassify costs/expenditures from the 
Construction in Progress account to the proper asset account once the 

projects are completed and are available for use as intended by Management, 

as provided in Chapter 10, Section 8 (g) and Section 25 of the GAM, Volume 

I. 
 

Accounting Deficiencies 

 

2. The balance of Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) totaling P441,610,794.24 as 
at December 31, 2020 was unreliable due to the unfinished reconciliation of records 

between the Accounting and Property Sections, thus, resulting in an unreconciled 

variance of P20,956,176.58 between the property and accounting records, contrary to 



 

iv 

 

Section 42, Chapter 10 Volume I of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for 

National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I. 

 

We reiterated our prior year’s recommendation and Management agreed to instruct 

the Accountant and the Property Officer to conduct regular reconciliation of the 

recorded PPEs in order to avoid recurrence of variances between both records. 

 

3. The reliability of the balance of Due from National Government Agencies 
(NGAs) account totaling P1,405,986.92 as at December 31, 2020 could not be 

ascertained due to (i) non-reconciliation of prior years’ balance of advances to PS-DBM, 

and (ii) over-remittance of taxes that caused a misstatement of the affected accounts. 

 

We reiterated our prior year’s recommendation and Management agreed to require 

the Accountant and the Supply Officer to make representations with the PS-DBM 

and reconcile their records with the PS-DBM representative relative to the noted 

discrepancies reflected in the books of accounts of the two agencies. We further 

recommended and Management agreed to take appropriate action to resolve the 

over-remittance of taxes that has caused misstatements of the affected accounts. 

 

4. The Due to NGAs balance of P116,149,315.32 as at December 31, 2020 includes 
the carrying value of equipment of completed projects not yet transferred amounting to 

P90,347,866.26 that are still awaiting transfer documents from the Source Agency. 

Furthermore, the Agency paid and incurred obligation more than the grant fund provided 

by the Philippine Commission on Women (PCW) in the amount of P786,002.34 and 

P976,509.24, respectively, contrary to Section 2 and Section 4 of PD 1445. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require: 

 

a. The Project Leaders to constantly coordinate and follow up with the 
officials of the Source Agency the request to expedite the transfer of 

equipment acquired out of GIA Funds by providing them the list of 

completed projects, together with the list of equipment requested for 

donation; 

 

b. The Accountant to maintain a separate subsidiary ledger among projects 
under the Cash-Modified Disbursement System (MDS), Trust and Cash – 

Treasury/Agency Deposit, Trust, to effectively monitor the movement of 

cash received by each project; and 

 

c. The Accountant and the Project Leader to:  
 

i) make representations or dialogue with the Philippine Commission on 
Women (PCW) to expedite the release of remaining funds so that 

funds being used from other projects can be restored and the 

remaining unpaid obligations can be settled; and 

 



 

v 

 

ii) limit the incurrence of expenses so as not to exceed the actual cash 
fund/budget from the Source Agencies, in adherence to Section 9 of 

COA Circular No. 94-013 and Section 4 (3) of PD 1445. 

 

Compliance Audit 

 

5. Office Building and properties stored therein, although covered with the General 
Insurance Fund of the GSIS were not insured adequately, thus, exposing the agency to 

risk of non-indemnification and to unnecessary losses in the event of damage or loss 

caused by natural calamities such as earthquake, storm and other causes beyond the 

insurance limits. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require its authorized and 

responsible officials to:  

a. upgrade the insurance coverage for the PTRI insurable properties against all 
natural and man-made calamities, and 

 

b. incorporate in its annual appropriation the amount necessary to cover the 

increase in premiums relative to the insurance upgrade. 

The audit observations and recommendations were communicated with the 

Auditee through the issuance of Summary of Observations and Recommendations 

(SAOR) on May 12, 2021 and their comments were incorporated in the report, where 

appropriate.
