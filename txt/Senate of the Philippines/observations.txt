Unliquidated Cash Advances



1)	Cash advances in the total amount of ₽0.637 million under the accounts Advances for Operating Expenses and Advances for Payroll remain unliquidated as at December 31, 2020 as Accountable Officers (AOs) were not able to immediately refund the excess/unexpended balance of cash advances at the end of the year when the purposes for which they were granted have already been served thus, making it susceptible to possible loss or probable misuse.



	1)	Section 5.8 of Commission on Audit (COA) Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 requires that all cash advances shall be fully liquidated at the end of each year.  Except for petty cash fund, the Accountable Officer (AO) shall refund any unexpended balance to the cashier/collecting officer who will issue the necessary official receipt.

	3)	The unliquidated amount of ₽636,876.23 represents the unexpended balance of cash advances granted in October and December 2020 but were not refunded to the cashier at year end.



	4)	It was noted that respective supporting documents for liquidation of the abovementioned cash advances were already submitted to the Legislative Accounting Service (LAS) as at December 31, 2020, except for the official receipts evidencing refunds of excess/unutilized amounts which were made only in January 2021.



	5)	The practice of not being able to refund the excess/unexpended/unutilized balance of cash advance to the cashier/collecting officer at the end of the year, even if the purpose for which the said cash advance was granted had already been served is inconsistent with Section 5.8 of the COA Circular No. 97-002.



	6)	It is noteworthy to mention however, that the unliquidated amount of ₽636,876.23 was already refunded and liquidated as at January 31, 2021, as evidenced by official receipts, details are shown in Table No. 2.

	7)	The excess was refunded only in January 2021 because of the early Christmas break in the agency with the last working day being December 17, 2020.



	8)	The excess/unexpended cash ranging from ₽0.10 to ₽363,097.14, in the AO’s possession is susceptible to possible loss or probable misuse when not immediately refunded though the purpose it was  granted has been served.



	9)	This  audit observation was noted in the 2019 Annual Audit Report.  However, the total unliquidated cash advances were higher in CY 2019 amounting to ₽1,756,686.76 than in CY 2020 of ₽636,876.23 or a 64 percent decrease, due to the efforts exerted by the LAS to minimize. if not prevent the occurrence of unliquidated advances.  The unliquidated amount in CY 2019 was fully liquidated in CY 2020.



	10)	We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountable Officers to fully liquidate their cash advances as soon as the purposes for which they were granted have been served through the submission of the liquidation documents and the corresponding official receipts evidencing refund of any unexpended/excess balance at the end of each year.





	Unliquidated Fund Transfers to the Department of Public Works and Highways



1)		The balance of Due from NGAS account of ₱975.950 million representing fund transfers to the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) for the construction of the New Senate Building remain unliquidated as at December 31, 2020 as additional fund transfers were granted despite non-liquidation of previous releases. 



	1)	COA Circular No. 2016-002 dated May 31, 2016 requires the "Certification by the Accountant that funds previously transferred to the Implementing Agency (IA) has been liquidated and accounted for in the books" as part of the documentary requirements for the grant of fund transfers.



	2)	On September 13, 2018, the Senate of the Philippines (Senate) entered into a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with the DPWH for the construction of New Senate Building with a contract amount of ₽8.9 billion for a period from CY 2018 to CY 2022 to relocate on a permanent site to house the Senate offices because of cost-efficiency and the amenity of finding a more conducive suitable site to accommodate the requirements of the legislators and the Senate employees as a whole (Senate Resolution No. 293 dated February 15, 2017).   At present the Senate is renting an office space at the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) Building and a parking space at the Social Security System (SSS) since April 1997 at an annual rate of ₽156,718,178.28 and ₽13,735,008.00, respectively, or a total rent expense of ₽170,453,186.28 annually.



	3)	As cited in the MOA, the following are the respective responsibilities, among others, of the Senate and the DPWH in undertaking the project:

		--	Transfer to the DPWH the funding checks for the Project in accordance with the following schedule:



a)	Initial transfer - ₽900M out of the approved budget of the Senate for 2018 within 30 days from signing the MOA.



b)	For the 2nd and succeeding tranches – a percentage of the Project cost per approved budget for FY 2019-2021 as may be agreed upon between the parties for the completion of the Project.



           DPWH



		--	Serve as the procuring agent for the Senate, prepare and determination of the Program of Work for the D&B Contract, the Approved Budget for Contract and others;

			

		--	Provide the Official Receipts for funds transferred by the Senate to cover the funds payable for the Project for fiscal year 2018 and succeeding years;

			

		--	Conduct public bidding, post-qualification, and award the Project and enter into a contract with the winning contractor for the D&B services of the Project pursuant to Republic Act (RA) No. 9184 and its Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (RIRR);

			

		--	Prepare the appropriate contracts and agreements required for the Project;

			

		--	Designate a Project Management Team (PMT) who shall provide technical advisory to its counterparts from the SCT and to coordinate on all matters relative to the implementation and supervision of the Project;

			

		--	Submit periodic reports to the Senate through the SCT regarding progress work of the contractor, problems encountered, construction work force and status of accomplishment;

	5)	Table No. 3 shows that in CY 2018, the Senate made an initial transfer of funds in the amount of ₽900 million to the DPWH as agreed upon in the MOA.  However, it is noted that the Senate had likewise transferred funds amounting to ₱643,000,000.00 on July 2, 2019 despite the non-liquidation of the fund transfer made on October 10, 2018 of ₱900,000,000,00.  As a consequence, the accumulated unliquidated balance of the DPWH as of December 31, 2019 reached as high as ₽1,543,000,000.00.



	6)	Notably, liquidations in the amounts of ₱900,000,000.00 and ₱310,050,000.00 were made on September 16 and November 28, 2019, respectively. During CY 2020, neither fund transfer, nor liquidation of prior year fund transfers were made thus, the accumulated balance of ₱975,950,000.00 remain unliquidated/outstanding as at December 31, 2020.



	7)	It is noteworthy to mention however, that fund transfers amounting to ₱878,355,000.00 and ₱97,595,000.00 were liquidated on April 26, 2021 and May 31, 2021, respectively, thereby the remaining balance of of ₱975,950,000.00 as at December 31, 2020 was already fully liquidated as at May 31, 2021.



	8)	The practice of granting additional fund transfers despite non-liquidation of previous releases is not compliant with COA Circular No. 2016-002 and resulted in the accumulation of huge unliquidated balances.



	9)	We recommended that Management require the Chief Accountant to regularly monitor the fund transfers and likewise coordinate with the DPWH, through the Senate Coordinating Team, for the immediate submission of corresponding liquidation documents prior to the granting of additional fund transfer to avoid accumulation of huge unliquidated balances as at year end.





	Non-Reliability/Inaccuracy of PPE Account Balances

	

2)		The reliability and accuracy of Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) account balances in the total amount of ₽2.352 billion as at December 31, 2020 could not be ascertained due to unreconciled difference of ₽23.571 million upon comparison of balances between property and accounting records in the absence of a reconciliation. Subsequent conduct of verification, confirmation, and reconciliation of the same PPE records however disclosed a higher unreconciled balance of ₽79.538 million which represents only 3 percent of the total PPE of ₽2.352 billion due to: a) misclassification of accounts;  b) double count of PPE;  c) items not found either in the property or accounting records;  d) same items with different amounts;  e) change of property numbers; f) same items dissimilarly recorded in the books; g) dropped from the books but recorded in the Report on Physical Count of PPE (RPCPPE); and h) items could not be duly accounted for.  Likewise, 660 items amounting to ₽148.038 million are either without Property Number (PN) stickers or are returned per end-user but still in the RPCPPE, others are not officially transferred to other end-users while others still show inconsistency in reporting the conditions of the assets.

	

	1)	Section 42, Chapter 10 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume I provides that the Chief Accountant shall maintain PPE Ledger Card (PPELC) for each category of PPE.  The PPELC shall be kept to record promptly the acquisition, description, custody, estimated useful life, depreciation, impairment loss, disposal and other information about the asset.  For check and balance, the Property and Supply Office/Unit shall likewise maintain Property Card (PC) for PPE in their custody to account for the receipt and disposition of the same. The balance per PC shall be reconciled with PPELC maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit.  They shall also be reconciled with other property records like the Property Acknowledgement Receipt (PAR).   

	

	2)	Further, Section 42 (g) thereof states that the Report on Physical Count of PPE (RPCPPE) shall be used to report the physical count and condition of PPE by type as at a given date, including those which are unrecorded and those which could not be accounted for.  It shows the balance of PPE per property cards and per count and the shortage, if any.  It shall be rendered by the Inventory Committee, on its yearly physical count of properties owned by the entity.

	3)	Comparison of the accounting records and the 2020 RPCPPE showed a discrepancy of ₱23,570,858.90 in the amount of acquisition cost/unit value, as shown in Table No.4.

	4)	Apparently, the unreconciled difference of ₽23,570,858.90 as at December 31, 2021 is due to non-reconciliation of records between the Legislative Accounting Service (LAS) and the Property and Procurement Service (PPS).

	  

	5)	It was only upon completion and submission of the 2020 RPCPPE where the subsequent conduct of reconciliation between the accounting records and the RPCPPE were initially undertaken by the LAS and the PPS.   Reconciliation was made through matching and/or comparing the entries indicated in the PPELC in the LAS as against the RPCPPE per item of category or PPE account in the PPS.  Entries in the PPELC and RPCPPE, specifically the PPE Property Number (PN), Description and the Acquisition Cost/Amount were being matched to determine its similarity/dissimilarity in recording.   Those items having similar entries in both records were considered reconciled while those dissimilar were considered reconciling items. 



	6)	Results of reconciliation disclosed a significant amount of reconciled PPEs totaling ₽2,272,823,985.78 consisting of 4,295 items of different category, the details are in Table No.5.

	7)	Undeniably, from the table above, PPE account balances do not tally in the LAS and the PPS records.  As observed, the LAS has recorded 5,583 items of PPE in the books totaling ₽2,352,361,527.17 while 5,454 amounting to ₽2,359,139,811.55 in the PPS.   Upon reconciliation, the LAS and the PPS were able to match 4,295 PPE items having the same PN, description and amount totaling ₽2,272,823,985.78.



3.8	The difference of 1,288 items amounting to ₽79,537,541.39 per LAS or 1,217 worth ₽86,315,825.77 per PPS, on the other hand, are still subject for further verification and reconciliation that requires thorough analysis, verification, comparison and matching of the LAS and PPS PPE records. 



3.9	The LAS and PPS were not able to completely undertake the reconciliation for the entire PPE items in as much as the process started only upon submission of the 2020 RPCPPE on January 31, 2021 instead of doing the required reconciliation prior to completion and submission of the RPCPPE.

	

	1)	Remarkably, the reconciled amount of ₽2,272,823,985.78 represents 97 percent of the total PPE booked-up or 96 percent per PPS records while the unreconciled balance is 3 percent and 4 percent, respectively.



	2)	Meanwhile, the above reconciliation was made in coordination with the audit team’s verification of the RPCPPE as well as the PPELC.  In addition, in order to validate the entries indicated in the RPCPPE, the team made a confirmation to all end-users of the PPE using the 2019 RPCPPE as the basis since confirmation was conducted in 2020, though subsequent updates of entries were made upon submission of the 2020 RPCPPE.  



	3)	The objectives of the confirmation are to determine whether the PPE enumerated in the RPCPPE are existing, serviceable or not, marked with property number stickers, with issued Property Acknowledgment Receipt (PAR) and are actually used or in the possession of end-users. The confirmation was likewise undertaken in response to the Management’s request of finding/identifying the whereabouts of acquired PPE in anticipation of their transfer to their permanent Office Building in 2024.  



	4)	Henceforth, confirmation was made by the team to 634 end-users enumerated in the 2019 RPCPPE.   However, only 510 confirmation replies were returned covering 4,402 PPE out of 5,084.  The remaining 682 items plus purchases and disposals as well as new end-users indicated in the 2020 RCPPE are subject for reconciliation in CY 2021.

    

	5)	Overall results of our verification and comparison with the RPCPPE and the PPELC, as well as the audit team’s confirmation to end-users, revealed the following underlying reasons/causes, among others, of the aforesaid unreconciled amount of ₽86,315,825.77 in the property and ₽79,537,541.39 in the accounting records, discussed as follows:



a)			Misclassification of accounts.  The reconciliation is made by matching the PPE items in the PPELC against the RCPPE under the same account codes.   However, we noted that at least 155 units amounting to ₽15,896,819.73 with the same Property Number (PN), description and amount were using two different account codes.  Account codes used in the accounting books were not similar to the account codes used in the RPCPPE, as follows:

c)			PPE items not found either in the property or in the accounting records.  Matching the PPELC and the RPCPPE showed that a total of 1,003 PPE worth ₽51,956,370.71 recorded in the PPELC were not recorded in the RPCPPE and conversely, 821 items found in the RPCPPE were not found in the books totaling ₽57,258,540.83, thus needing further verification and thorough analysis in undertaking the reconciliation, summarized in Table No. 8, as follows:

	7)	Reconciliation of property and accounting records is essential to come up with a reliable and accurate balances of PPE accounts in the agency books as at year end.   Inasmuch as the Senate had already initiated the reconciliation where 97 percent or ₽2,272,823,985.78 of the total PPE recorded in the books of ₽2,352,361,527.17 had been reconciled and where the reasons/causes for the remaining unreconciled difference of 3 percent or ₽79,537,541.39 had been identified in audit, a follow through reconciliation process should be continuously undertaken.



	8)	Otherwise, failure of the LAS and PPS to reconcile their records rendered the PPE accounts unreliable/inaccurate, contrary to Section 42, Chapter 10 of the GAM, Volume I.



	9)	We recommended that Management require the LAS and PPS to:



a)	Bring to completion the reconciliation of the remaining unreconciled balance of ₽79.538 million or only 3 percent of the total PPE by undertaking well-coordinated procedures/measures/actions to appropriately address the causes/reasons identified in audit in order to efficiently and ultimately reconcile the PPE account balances in the books; and



b)	Address deficiencies/observations noted in the confirmation replies to establish accountability.



	10)	Management informed that the LAS will be in close coordination with the PPS and will discuss the necessary procedures/measures/actions to be taken in order to complete the reconciliation of the remaining amount.   Rest assured that they will adhere with the provisions mentioned in Sec. 42, Chapter 10 of the GAM Volume I.



	11)	The PPS likewise informed that they will comply with the recommendation of COA to continuously reconcile with the LAS to appropriately address the causes/reasons of unreconciled PPE account balances in the books.  In addition, PPS will continuously secure monthly PPE Schedule from the LAS for reconciliation purposes.



	12)	Lastly, Management informed that the COA Senate team played a vital role throughout the course of the reconciliation, verification and confirmation of the PPE accounts. The tremendous help and support of the team enabled Management to reconcile the amount of ₽2,272,823,985.78 or 97 percent of PPE account and identified the reasons/causes, among others, for the non- reconciliation of the remaining ₽79,537,541.39 or 3 percent of the PPE account.  





COMPLIANCE ISSUES



Non-Disposal of Unserviceable Property, Plant and Equipment



3)		Unserviceable Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) of 1,351 units acquired during the period from Calendar Years (CYs) 1987 to 2018 in the total amount of ₱63.102 million remain undisposed as at December 31, 2020 thus, exposing the unserviceable PPE to further deterioration and diminution of value thereby depriving the agency of additional income thru sale and the recipient agencies the benefit of receiving serviceable items from transfer of property between government agencies, respectively.



	1)		Section 76 of the Presidential Decree (PD) 1445 otherwise known as the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines states that Transfer of property between government agencies - any government property that is no longer serviceable or needed by the agency to which it belongs may be transferred without cost, or at an appraised value, to other agencies of the government upon authority of the respective heads of agencies in the national government, or of the governing bodies of government-owned or controlled corporations, other self-governing boards or commissions of the government, or of the local legislative bodies for local government units concerned.

	

	2)		Likewise, Section 79 of the same law, states that when government property has become unserviceable for any cause, or is no longer needed, it shall, upon application of the officer accountable therefore, be inspected by the head of the agency or his duly authorized representative in the presence of the auditor concerned and, if found valueless or unsalable, it may be destroyed in their presence.  If found to be valuable, it may be sold at public auction to the highest bidder under the supervision of the proper committee on award or similar body in the presence of the auditor or other duly authorized representative of the Commission on Audit.

	

4.3	In addition, COA Circular No. 89-296 dated January 27, 1989 provides one of the Modes of Disposal/Divestment which is Transfer to Other Government Agencies – where the property or assets involved are no longer serviceable or needed by the department, agency, corporation or local government unit concerned, they may be transferred to other government entities/agencies without cost or at an appraised value upon authority of the head or governing body of the said agency or corporation, and upon due accomplishment of an Invoice and Receipt of Property.

	

	1)	Confirmation and verification of the RPCPPE as at December 31, 2020 submitted by the Property Officer showed that 1,351 PPE units in the total amount of ₱63,102,253,53 acquired during the period from CYs 1987 to 2018, had been unserviceable yet remain undisposed as at December 31, 2020, shown as follows:

	2)		From Table No. 14, it can be noted however, that out of the total amount of unserviceable PPEs of ₽63,102,253.53, the amount of ₽29,718,479.85 or 47 percent of which are due for disposal in CY 2021.  The corresponding unserviceable units were done with inspection, the units were included in the IIRUP and consequently, this report was already forwarded to the Senate Disposal Committee (SDC).  Thus, the Senate has to undertake the process of preparing the IIRUP for the remaining unserviceable PPE of ₽33,383,773.68 in CY 2021.

	

	3)		Moreover, verification disclosed that of the 1,351 units of unserviceable PPEs, 1,311 were found in the Warehouse while the 40 units were with the other Senate offices. This means that almost all of the unserviceable PPEs were already stored in the warehouse; either unserviceable upon return by end-users or obsolete/defective.



	4)		Meanwhile, it was further observed in the confirmation replies received by the COA team that some PPEs returned to the warehouse were still serviceable but no longer needed by the agency.  These were the PPE items serviceable upon return in various dates to the Property Custodian but not re-issued to other end-users anymore.  In time, these items have become unserviceable in 2020. Samples of which are shown in Table No.15:

	5)		Returned PPE items still serviceable but could not be re-issued to other end-users because of obsolescence or outmoded, or for any other reason no longer needed by the Senate should likewise be disposed through transfer without cost to other government agencies that maybe in need of equipment/furniture, rather than storing them at warehouses for a longer period of time, thus reducing their serviceable value. This is in line with Section 76 of PD 1445 and COA Circular No. 89-296.  

	

	6)		Delayed transfer of these properties will decrease the physical condition of the PPEs due to storage deterioration.  As such, it deprives the recipient agencies of availing or receiving good-conditioned/functional items which can be utilized in their operations.   

	

	7)		On the other hand, non-disposal of PPE, already recognized as unserviceable by the Property Officer or no longer needed by the agency is inconsistent with Section 79 of PD 1445 that  requires the accountable officer to dispose unserviceable property upon application for inspection by the agency head or his duly authorized representative in the presence of the auditor concerned, valueless property may be destroyed in their presence, while valuable PPEs may be sold at public auction to the highest bidder.

	

	8)		Likewise, the delayed disposal of unserviceable properties exposes said properties to further deterioration that subsequently diminish/reduce whatever amount that may be recovered from the sale/disposal of the same. 

	

	9)		The disposal of unserviceable or serviceable but no longer needed PPEs either through sale or transfer to other government agencies will be considered by the Senate for immediate action in as much as the Senate is bound to transfer to its new permanent Office Building in 2024 and accordingly, it has no plans of taking in these old PPEs to the new building.  Otherwise, the Senate will be forced to rent a building space to house these PPEs which means incurrence of additional expense.

	

	10)		We recommended and Management agreed to require the Property Officer to strictly comply with Sections 76 and 79 of PD 1445 and immediately facilitate the inspection and disposal so that the unserviceable PPE or serviceable but no longer needed by the Senate in its operations are immediately disposed thru sale or transfer to government agencies, to avoid further deterioration and diminution of value.

 



Non-enforcement of the Notice of Finality of Decision



4)		The Senate was not able to enforce the Notice of Finality of Decision (NFD) issued by the Commission on Audit (COA) on February 29, 2016 on the settlement of refund on rental deposit and for the lost firearms totaling P185,881.22 which remained outstanding for more than 16 years as at December 31, 2020 recorded under Other Receivables account.



	1)		The dispositive portion of COA DECISION No. 2015-261 dated October 26, 2015 states, 

	

	“WHEREFORE, premises considered, the herein request of Deputy Secretary, Administration and Financial Services (DepSec, AFS), Senate of the Philippines (Senate), Pasay City for authority to write off dormant accounts of former Senator and Senate employees in the total amount of P152,583.27 is hereby DENIED for lack of merit”.  

	

	2)		Said RULING became final and executory on February 29, 2016 through the issuance of the NOTICE OF FINALITY OF DECISION (NFD) dated February 29, 2016 by the COA Commission Proper Secretary.

		

	3)		Verification of records showed that the Other Receivables account balance as at December 31, 2020 amounted to P185,881.22, shown as follows:

	4)		Records show that on September 19, 2012, the DepSec, AFS, Senate,  requested COA for authority to write off dormant accounts of a former Senator and a former LSG 1 in the total amount of P146,881.22.   



	5)		Said request of  the DepSec stated that the Senate has exerted efforts by sending demand letters to the debtors through registered mail, but to no avail because they either could no longer be located or they did not respond to the demand letters.

 

	6)		However, COA Decision No. 2015-261 dated October 26, 2015 DENIED the aforesaid request for authority to write off based on the documents submitted and the surrounding circumstances of the case.  It was stated that the dormant accounts are not proper subjects for write-off for the following reasons:



a)			On the receivable from the former Senator, Management should follow up the demand letters already given to the former Senator since his whereabouts is still known.



b)			In the case of the former LSG 1, a request for relief from property accountability should have been filed with the resident auditor in order for COA to determine if relief is proper under the circumstances.



	7)		Eventually, the abovementioned COA Decision No. 2015-261 became final and executory on February 29, 2016 through the issuance of the NFD, pursuant to Section 9, Rule X of the 2009 Revised Rules of Procedure of the Commission on Audit, as modified under COA Resolution No. 2011-006 dated August 17, 2011, denying the request in the total amount of ₽146,881.22 for lack of merit. 

	

	8)		However, despite the issuance of the NFD on February 29, 2016, the rental deposit amounting to P112,928.30 was still not refunded by the former Senator, thus the account remained outstanding for more than 22 years since 1998.  On the other hand, the lost firearm amounting to P33,952.92 has not yet been paid or replaced by the former LSG 1 as of December 31, 2020, thereby remain unsettled for more than 16 years since 2004.



	9)		This audit observation was already noted in the 2017 Annual Audit Report (AAR) of the Senate of the Philippines.  It was then recommended that the Chief of the Legislative Accounting Service (LAS) prepare and send follow-up letter to the former Senator requesting refund of the unused rental deposit.  However, records show that the latest demand letter sent was dated April 24, 2018 and no follow up letters thereafter, while letters were sent on June 7, 2018, August 6, 2019 and March 10, 2020 to the former LSG 1 who lost a firearm.



	10)		Meanwhile, in the case of the former LSG 2 who also lost a firearm, there was no request for authority to write off made to COA by the agency.  In addition, there was a demand letter sent for collection or replacement for the lost firearm on June 7, 2018 but still remain unpaid for more than 16 years as of December 31, 2020.  

	

	11)		For the lost firearms, it was recommended in the 2017 AAR that the Chief of the Property and Procurement Service (PPS) facilitate the filing of request for relief of accountability, however, to no avail as of December 31, 2020.



	12)		We reiterated our recommendation that Management require the:

	

a)	DepSec, AFS, Senate to explain why the NFD issued by the COA on February 29, 2016 remain unenforced up to this day; and



b)	 Chiefs of the LAS and PPS to prepare and send follow-up letters to the former Senator requesting refund of the unused rental deposit and to facilitate the filing of request for relief of accountability for the lost firearms, respectively. 



	13)		Management commented that the Notice of Finality of Decision (NFD) was not enforced to former LSG 1 in the amount of ₽33,952.92 as of December 31, 2020 because the heir of the deceased failed to cooperate with the PPS up to present despite several letters sent dated June 7, 2018, August 6, 2019, March 10, 2020 and the latest was dated May 3, 2021, requesting the submission of required documents necessary to support the filing of the petition for relief from property accountability such as:



1)		Affidavit that the service firearm is not in his possession.

2)		Copy of the Affidavit of Loss executed by former LSG 1 and other documents to support the said loss.

3)		Affidavit of two disinterested persons to be executed by his former co-employees in the Senate.



	14)		With regard to the former LSG 2, there was no request for authority to write off filed with COA. PPS sent a letter addressed to the heir of the deceased dated June 7, 2018 and personally received by the wife, requesting the submission of required documents for the filing of petition for relief of accountability, but PPS did not receive any reply up to present.

	

	15)		Nevertheless, the PPS will comply with the recommendations of COA.  

	

	

	

	

	

	“Conforme” Portion of the Purchase Order Not Signed by Suppliers

	

5)		Suppliers or their authorized representatives were unable to sign the “Conforme” portion of the Purchase Orders (POs) and have not indicated the date of receipt thereof, prior to delivery to signify their approval of the terms of the agreement, thereby, preventing Management from imposing liquidated damages in case of delays in the delivery of supplies/goods/property.



	1)		Appendix 61 of the GAM, Volume II defines PO as a form/document used by the agency/entity, addressed to a supplier, to deliver specific quantities of supplies/goods/property subject to the terms and conditions contained in the PO.

	

	2)		Moreover, Instructions on B.17 of Appendix 61 of the GAM Volume II states that “Conforme – signature over printed name of supplier or his/her representative signifying his/her approval to the term set by the agency/entity and the date of signing.”



	3)		Verification showed that the “Conforme” portion of the POs issued in 2020 by the Property and Procurement Service (PPS) for the procurement of various supplies/goods/property are not signed by the suppliers or representatives prior to delivery to signify agreement to the terms set by the agency. These were however, signed only upon delivery of the items.  Samples of which are as follows:

	4)		From Table No. 17, it is shown that the PPS will e-mail the PO to the supplier with the lowest price quotation to inform that such PO has been approved for delivery of the needed goods.  Thereafter, the concerned supplier will acknowledge receipt of the e-mail but is not required by the PPS to sign in and to indicate the date of receipt in the “Conforme” portion of the PO.

	

	5)		Since the “Conforme” portion was not signed and undated, the duration or length of period within which to deliver the goods by the supplier varies; either delivered within one day or delays occurred for as long as 110 days regardless of the PO amount. Consider the following:



a)		No. 1 PO with an amount of ₽6,872.00 was delivered in 48 working days (WDs), while No. 2 PO amounting to ₽122,880.00 in 12 WDs when in fact corresponding POs indicated the period of delivery within 15 and 10 to 20 WDs, respectively.

	

b)		Similarly, No. 15 PO amounting to ₽224,000.00 was delivered in 55 calendar days (CDs) only, while No. 16 PO worth ₽189,200.00 in 110 CDs. Delivery terms should be within 45 and 90 CDs, respectively. 



c)		More so, the No. 8 PO with an amount of ₽733,200.00 was only delivered within one day, while No. 14 PO amounting to ₽5,640.00 took the supplier 28 CDs.  Delivery terms is supposed to be within 7 CDs for both POs.

	

	6)		Accordingly, the signature of the supplier or representative is necessary in the “Conforme” portion of the PO because it implies his/her  approval to the terms of the PO as to the specific quantities of supplies/goods/property to be delivered, date of delivery and the penalty or liquidated damages to be imposed in case of delay, if any. The date of receipt by the supplier is likewise important because it serves as the reckoning date to compute for liquidated damages.  

	

	7)		Inasmuch as the “Conforme” portion of the PO was not signed by the supplier and the date of receipt not indicated, this prevented Management from imposing liquidated damages in case of delays incurred in the delivery of the required supplies/goods/property, as well as depriving Management from the immediate use of such needed items in the agency operation.

	

	8)		The Chief of the PPS informed the Audit Team that the POs were sent through e-mail to the suppliers to limit face-to-face interactions due to the pandemic and required the suppliers to sign the “Conforme” portion of the PO upon delivery of the items procured.



	9)		We were informed further that even if it is pandemic and the POs were just e-mailed to suppliers, they will not agree that the “Conforme” date will be dated at the time of receipt of e-mails since accordingly, there was no agreement made by and between the Senate and the suppliers to the effect, that the date of receipt of the e-mail by suppliers represents the “Conforme” date of the PO. The acknowledgement date of the e-mail signifies only the receipt of the e-mail. Thus, the PPS could not prevent the suppliers from signing and dating the “Conforme” portion at the time of delivery. 



	10)		We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Chief of the PPS to require and to make an agreement with suppliers that upon receipt of the PO through e-mail, the latter will sign the Conforme portion, duly dated and will send back the PO to the former to ensure enforcement of the terms contained therein and appropriately impose penalty in case of any delay in the delivery of goods/supplies/property needed in the agency operation.





OTHER COMPLIANCE ISSUES



Gender and Development



6)		The agency budget allocated for Gender and Development (GAD) was ₱9.160 million which represents only 0.10 percent of its total agency appropriation of ₱9.477 billion or 4.90 percent lower than the five percent requirement.  Likewise, out of the 23 GAD programmed activities for the year, 16 were implemented with a total cost of ₱21.235 million or 132 percent higher than the approved GAD Budget. 

	

	1)		The Philippine Commission on Women (PCW), the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA), and the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) Joint Circular (JC) No. 2012-01 provides the “Guidelines for the Preparation of Annual Gender and Development (GAD) Plans and Budgets and Accomplishment Reports to Implement the Magna Carta of Women.”

	

	2)		Likewise, Section 31 of the General Provisions of Republic Act (RA) No. 11465, also known as the General Appropriations Act (GAA) FY 2020, requires that the GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of the agencies, which shall be at least five per cent of their budgets. For this purpose, activities currently being undertaken by agencies which related to GAD or those that contribute to poverty alleviation, economic empowerment especially of marginalized women, protection, promotion, and fulfillment of women’s human rights, and practice of gender-responsive governance are considered sufficient compliance with said requirement.

	

	3)		Paragraph 6.1 of the PCW/NEDA/DBM JC No. 2012-01 also provides that “at least five per cent of the total agency budget appropriations authorized under the annual General Appropriations Act (GAA) shall correspond to activities supporting GAD plans and programs. The GAD budget shall be drawn from the agency’s maintenance and other operating expenses (MOOE), capital outlay (CO) and personnel services (PS).  It is understood that the GAD budget does not constitute an additional budget over an agency’s total budget appropriations.”

	

	4)		The total appropriations of the Senate for CY 2020 was ₱9,476,902,000.00, of which the approved budget allocated to GAD totaled ₱9,160,000.00, representing only 0.10 percent or 4.90 percent less than the required minimum of five percent of the agency appropriations, which is not compliant with Section 31 of the FY 2020 GAA and Paragraph 6.1 of the PCW/NEDA/DBM JC No. 2012-01.

	

	5)		Review of the annual GAD Accomplishment Report in the agency’s implementation of the GAD related-activities for CY 2020 showed that of the 23 programmed activities, only 16 were implemented with total cost of ₱21,234,779.68, details are shown in Table No.18.

12,074,779.68 / 9,160,000.00   =      132%

P12,074,779.68

	6)		From Table No. 18, it can be noted that the actual expenditures for the GAD amounted to ₱21,234,779.68 which exceeded the total appropriated budget of ₱9,160,000.00 by ₱12,074,779.68 or 132 percent.

	

	7)		It was disclosed that the seven other GAD-related activities were not implemented or put on hold due to suspension and limitations on work caused by the pandemic.

	

	8)		We recommended that the Chairperson of Senate GAD Focal Point System, in adherence with the pertinent provisions of the 2020 GAA, RA 9710 and its IRR and the PCW/NEDA/DBM JC No. 2012-01, allocate at least five percent of the total annual budget for the GAD-related activities and implement the programmed activities in the GAD Annual Plan and Budget in order to achieve its objective of strengthening GAD mainstream in the agency operations, as well as addressing gender issues and other concerns, as well as explain why GAD expenditures exceeded the approved budget.

	

	9)		Management explained that the reason GAD expenditures exceeded the total GAD budget in 2020 of ₽9,160,000 because the former included amounts which were not part of the 2020 GAD Budget since they are already part of the regular operating budget. The amount of ₽18,003,066.07 was not actually spent for GAD but merely attributed to GAD, and is broken down as follows:



--	₽1,554,000 for rental for the GAD room, breastfeeding room and gender neutral toilets considering the area/spaces given.

--	₽15,322,572.75 - a portion of the salaries of GAD members and GAD Secretariat officers and staff when attending GAD meetings, seminars and/or trainings.

--	₽1,126,494.32 - a portion of the salaries of Senate employees when attending GAD seminars and trainings.



	10)		The Senate GAD was advised by the PCW to attribute these expenses for GAD in the Accomplishment Report for 2020 even though these expenses were not included and contemplated in the 2020 GAD Budget since they were already part of the regular operating budget. This is the reason why the PCW also approved and endorsed the 2020 Accomplishment Report.



	11)		The Senate GAD will continue to endeavor, to the best of its ability, to abide by the provisions of the 2021 GAA, RA 9710 and its IRR, and PCW/NEDA/DBM JC No. 2012-01.











Senior Citizens (SCs) and Persons with Disability (PWD)



7)		The Senate is compliant with the provisions of Section 32 of the General Provisions of RA No. 11465, otherwise known as GAA for FY 2020 and Batas Pambansa Blg. 344 and RA No. 7277, as amended, in addressing the concerns and welfare of senior citizens (SCs) and persons with disability (PWDs).



	1)	Section 32 of the General Provisions of RA No. 11465, otherwise known as GAA for FY 2020 requires, among others, that all agencies of the government shall formulate plans, programs and projects intended to address concerns of SCs and PWDs, insofar as it relates to their mandated functions, and integrate the same in their regular activities.

	2)	Moreover, all government infrastructures and facilities shall provide architectural or structural features, designs or facilities that will reasonably enhance the mobility, safety and welfare of PWDs pursuant to Batas Pambansa Blg. 344 and RA No. 7277, as amended.



	3)	For CY 2020, Ad Hoc Committee on SCs and PWDs of the Senate formulated plans and programs with a budget of P2,552,900.00 of which P246,550.00 or 10 percent was utilized. The programs and projects accomplished during the year included the following:



a)	Purchase of wheelchair to be placed at the lobby;

b)	Livelihood program hybrid sessions;

c)	Webinars on health issues, such as how to be safe in the workplace, staying healthy and staying alive in times of pandemic, and building resilience during Covid-19 pandemic in the new normal; and

d)	Ad Hoc Committee regular meetings and annual strategic planning session



	4)	In addition, structures that enhance the mobility, safety and welfare of both SCs and PWDs, such as ramps to ensure easy access, priority lanes in the elevators as well as reserved parking spaces, are provided and maintained in the Senate building.





Tax Laws, Rules and Regulations



8)		The Senate withheld taxes from compensation of officials and employees and from payments to creditors/suppliers in the amount of P208.811 million and P45.022 million, respectively, and were remitted promptly and fully to the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR).



	1)				Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 10-2008 dated July 8, 2008 provides that “all government offices are constituted as withholding agents for purposes of the creditable tax required to be withheld on income payment from compensation, contractors, supplier of goods and services. As withholding agents, they are primarily liable for the remittance of the taxes to the National Treasury through the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR)”.



	2)				Further, Section 7 of RR No. 1-2013 dated January 23, 2013, provides that “filing of returns and payment of taxes shall be made on or before the 10th day of the month following the month in which withholding was made, except for taxes withheld for the month of December each year, which shall be filed on or before January 15 of the succeeding year”.



	3)				However, BIR RR No. 7-2020 dated March 27, 2020 provides that the Monthly Remittance Return of Value-Added Tax and Other Percentage Taxes Withheld (Form 1600 with MAP), Withholding Tax Remittance Return for National Government Agencies (Form 1600) and Monthly Remittance Return of Income Taxes Withheld on Compensation (Form 1601C) for the month of March, 2020 with an original due date on April 10, 2020 is extended to May 11, 2020. 



	4)				Under RR No. 11-2020 dated April 30, 2020, it further extended the due dates as follows: for the months of March 2020 and April 2020 with original due dates on April 10, 2020 and May 10, 2020, respectively, was further extended to June 9, 2020.



	5)				Review of financial records showed that the taxes due to the government from payments of goods and services to creditors/suppliers, including compensation of employees, were withheld and remitted to the BIR in accordance with the said regulations.

			

	6)				For CY 2020, the Senate withheld and promptly remitted taxes pertaining to compensation of officials and employees and payments to suppliers in the total amount of P208,811,364.49 and P45,022,189.97, respectively, shown in details in Table Nos. 19 and 20:
