C)			Scope and Objectives of Audit



The audit covered, on a sampling basis, the accounts and operations of the Senate for CY 2020. It was conducted to: a) verify the level of assurance that may be placed on Management’s assertions on the financial statements; b) recommend agency’s improvement opportunities; c) determine the propriety of transactions as well as the extent of compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations; and d) determine the extent of implementation of prior years’ audit recommendations. 



D)			Audit Methodology



The audit was conducted in accordance with International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAIs) issued by the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI) of which the Commission is a member. Procedures were performed to obtain audit evidence about amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including assessment of the risks of material misstatement/s of the financial statements; whether due to fraud or error.  The audit procedures included internal control review; examination of documents/records/reports; analysis, confirmation and inspection of selected accounts, transactions and projects, as necessary.



E)			Independent Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements



The Auditor rendered an unmodified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the Senate’s financial statements as at December 31, 2020.

	 

F)			Observations and Recommendations



Among the audit observations and corresponding recommendations discussed in Part II of this report, the significant observations are summarized as follows:



1.	The reliability and accuracy of Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) account balances in the total amount of ₱2.352 billion as at December 31, 2020 could not be ascertained due to unreconciled difference of ₱23.571 million upon comparison of balances between property and accounting records in the absence of a reconciliation. Subsequent conduct of verification, confirmation, and reconciliation of the same PPE records however disclosed a higher unreconciled balance of ₱79.538 million which represents only 3 percent of the total PPE of ₱2.352 billion due to: a) misclassification of accounts;  b) double count of PPE;  c) items not found either in the property or accounting records;  d) same items with different amounts;  e) change of property numbers; f) same items dissimilarly recorded in the books; g) dropped from the books but recorded in the Report on Physical Count of PPE (RPCPPE); and h) items could not be duly accounted for.  Likewise, 660 items amounting to ₱148.038 million are either without Property Number (PN) stickers or are returned per end-user but still in the RPCPPE, others are not officially transferred to other end-users while others still show inconsistency in reporting conditions of the assets. (Observation No. 3)

	

We recommended that Management require the LAS and PPS to:



a)	Bring to completion the reconciliation of the remaining unreconciled balance of ₱79.538 million or only 3 percent of the total PPE by undertaking well-coordinated procedures/measures/actions to appropriately address the causes/reasons identified in audit in order to efficiently and ultimately reconcile the PPE account balances in the books; and



b)	Address deficiencies/observations noted in the confirmation replies to establish accountability.

	

2.	The balance of Due from NGAS account of ₱975.950 million representing fund transfers to the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) for the construction of the New Senate Building remain unliquidated as of December 31, 2020 as additional fund transfers were granted despite non-liquidation of previous releases. (Observation No. 2)

	

 	We recommended that Management require the Chief Accountant to regularly monitor the fund transfers made and likewise coordinate with the DPWH, through the Senate Coordinating Team, for the immediate submission of corresponding liquidation documents prior to the granting of additional fund transfer to avoid accumulation of huge unliquidated balances as at year end.

	

3.	Unserviceable Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) of 1,351 units acquired during the period from Calendar Years (CYs) 1987 to 2018 in the total amount of ₱63.102 million remain undisposed as at December 31, 2020 thus, exposing the unserviceable PPE to further deterioration and diminution of value thereby depriving the agency of additional income thru sale and the recipient agencies the benefit of receiving serviceable items from transfer of property between government agencies, respectively. (Observation No. 4)



We recommended and Management agreed to require the Property Officer to strictly comply with Sections 76 and 79 of PD 1445 and immediately facilitate the inspection and disposal so that the unserviceable PPE or serviceable but no longer needed by the Senate in its operations are immediately disposed thru sale or transfer to government agencies, to avoid further deterioration and diminution of value.



4.	Cash advances in the total amount of ₱0.637 million under the accounts Advances for Operating Expenses and Advances for Payroll remain unliquidated as at December 31, 2020 as Accountable Officers (AOs) were not able to immediately refund the excess/unexpended balance of cash advances at the end of the year when the purposes for which they were granted have already been served thus, making it susceptible to possible loss or probable misuse. (Observation No. 1)

	

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountable Officers to fully liquidate their cash advances as soon as the purposes for which they were granted have been served through the submission of the liquidation documents and the corresponding official receipts evidencing refund of the unexpended/excess balances at the end of each year. 

	

5.	The Senate was not able to enforce the Notice of Finality of Decision (NFD) issued by the Commission on Audit (COA) on February 29, 2016 on the settlement of refund on rental deposit and for the lost firearms totaling ₱185,881.22 which remained outstanding for more than 16 years as at December 31, 2020 recorded under Other Receivables account. (Observation No. 5)

	

	

	

	

	We reiterated our recommendation that Management require the:

	

a)	DepSec, AFS, Senate, to explain why the NFD issued by the COA on February 29, 2016 remain unenforced up to this day; and

	

b)	Chiefs of the LAS and PPS to prepare and send follow-up letters to the former Senator requesting refund of the unused rental deposit and to facilitate the filing of request for relief of accountability for the lost firearms, respectively.



6.	Suppliers or their authorized representatives were unable to sign the “Conforme” portion of the Purchase Orders (POs) and have not indicated the date of receipt thereof, prior to delivery to signify their approval of the terms of the agreement, thereby, preventing Management from imposing liquidated damages in case of delays in the delivery of supplies/goods/property. (Observation No. 6)



We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Chief of the PPS to require and to make an agreement with suppliers that upon receipt of the PO through e-mail, the latter will sign the Conforme portion, duly dated and will send back the PO to the former to ensure enforcement of the terms contained therein and appropriately impose penalty in case of any delay in the delivery of goods/supplies/property needed in the agency operation.

	

Other equally significant audit observations and recommendations were also noted and discussed in detail under Part II of this report.

	

The above findings and recommendations contained in the report were discussed during the exit conference with concerned officials of the agency held on June 10, 2021.  Management’s views and comments were considered in the report, where appropriate.





G)			Status of Audit Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges



The Senate has no audit suspensions, disallowances and charges as of December 31, 2020.





H)			Status of Implementation of Prior Years’ Audit Recommendations

	

Of the 19 prior years’ audit recommendations, 11 were implemented, and eight were not implemented as of December 31, 2020.
