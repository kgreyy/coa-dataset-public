Introduction



The Zamboanga State College of Marine Sciences and Technology (ZSCMST) located at Rio Hondo, Zamboanga City, formerly known as the Mindanao Regional School of Fisheries (MRSF), became a state college on January 28, 1986 by virtue of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 2020. It was operating as Regional Institute of Fisheries Technology (RIFT) when it was converted into the present ZSCMST.



The ZSCMST is a government educational institution governed by Republic Act (R.A.) No. 8292, otherwise known as the “Higher Education Modernization Act of 1997, and its implementing rules and regulations contained in Commission on Higher Education (CHED) Memorandum Circular No. 4, series 1997.



The governance of the ZSCMST rests on its Board of Trustees (BOT), composed of the Chairman and 12 members, by virtue of RA No.  8292.  Policies are laid down by the Board and the observance and administration of such are vested on the College President who is assisted by two Vice-Presidents (VPs), specifically, the VP for Academic Affairs and the VP for Administration and Finance.



The College has the mandate to provide the necessary leadership in professional and technical instruction in fisheries, maritime technology, marine sciences and development management in line with the manpower requirement and other development needs of Western Mindanao and neighboring regions and offer undergraduate and graduate courses in fisheries, maritime technology, marine sciences and development management and computer technology (Section 3, PD No. 2020). 



For 2020, the ZSCMST had a total manpower complement of 329 consisting of 143 teaching, 97 non-teaching, 12 casuals, 42 part-time and 35 under job-order–signifying a decrease of 15 personnel as compared with the previous year of 344.

The objective of the audit conducted is to (a) ascertain the fairness of presentation of the financial statements (FS); (b) ascertain the propriety of financial transactions and compliance with prescribed rules and regulations; c) recommend agency improvement opportunities; and (d) determine the extent of implementation of prior years’ audit recommendations. Performance audit was likewise conducted with the objective of informing management where improvement can be instituted in the field of revenues, expenditures and management of resources.

	Independent Auditor’s Report on the FS



We rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the FS of ZSCMST for the year then ended December 31, 2020, taking exception on the effects of the following:



1)	Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) accounts in the total amount of P427.235 million as of December 31, 2020 presented in the FS is unreliable due to:  a) non-maintenance of accounting records and inadequate supporting records/details and information for PPE amounting to P392.301 million; and b) various errors and omissions in the keeping of accounts.  



2)	The validity of the Receivable account is doubtful due to the absence of Schedule of Receivables and/or details supporting the amount presented in the FS at P18.566 million; non-provision for Allowance for Impairment for Receivables whose collectability is uncertain; and unsupported deduction made from Receivables-Disallowances/Charges. 



3)	Inventory account balances totaling to P6.556 million contained errors and deficiencies including untraceable inventory on hand of P1.114 million and unrecorded issuances of P0.705 million, thus, affecting the propriety and reliability of the account balances as of year-end. 



4)	Accounts Payable was overstated by P0.947 million due to recording of partially and undelivered assets consequently overstating Office Supplies Inventory by P0.475 million, Semi-Expendable Furniture and Fixtures by P0.241 million, Office Equipment by P0.181 million and Furniture and Fixtures by P0.050 million. 



5)	Total expenditures for CY 2020 had a net overstatement of P0.842 million due to improper recognition of prior years’ expenditures as current year expenses, and non-recognition of current year expenses.



6)	School Fees amounting P0.793 million was understated due to incorrect reversion of unpaid billings for the 1st and 2nd semesters of school year 2018-2019. which was recognized as a reduction from school fees, instead of as Accounts Receivable. 



7)	Hazard Pay account was understated by P359,500.00 due to incorrect accounting entries consequently misstating other affected accounts. 



8)	Subsidiary records were not submitted to substantiate the account Due to Other National Government Agencies (NGAs) amounting to P42.539 million.  As a result, Management assertion on the accuracy of the account balance as of December 31, 2020 could not be validated.



Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations



1)	The engagement by the College of four staff/personnel of the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) and the payment of their honoraria at a fixed monthly rate of P20,000.00 notwithstanding the absence of accomplishment is excessive vis-a-vis the nature of legal services rendered to the College and is not in consonance with Commission on Audit (COA) Circular No. 2012-003 and Section 1(1) of PD No. 478.  



We recommended and Management agreed to consider reviewing its present payment scheme and reassessing the necessity of maintaining the services of four OSG lawyers taking into consideration the nature and volume of actual legal services/cases being handled, if services of the OSG could not be avoided. 



2)	Deposits and corresponding payments of salaries and wages to agency personnel through Automated Teller Machine (ATM) for the year amounting to P59.996 million under the agency’s Payroll Account were not properly recognized in the books contrary to Section 109 of PDNo. 1445.



We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Accountant to:



a)	Discontinue the practice of debiting Cash in Bank – Local Currency Current Account (LCCA) in Fund 101 to record transfer/deposit to the ATM Savings account and its subsequent credit to recognize payment made thru the ATM, considering that this ATM account is maintained in Fund 114;



b)	Record/recognize all transfer/deposits in the ATM Savings account maintained in Fund 114 with a debit to Cash in Bank – LCCA (Payroll Account/ATM). For transfers/ deposits from Fund 101 and 164, the corresponding account to be credited shall be Trust Liabilities; and



c)	Record/recognize subsequent transfer of payment to the individual personnel thru ATM by crediting Cash in Bank – LCCA (Payroll Account/ATM) for total withdrawals reflected in the passbook.



3)	The Sex-Disaggregated Data (SDD) maintained by ZSCMST is not in conformity with Section 36(c) of R.A No. 9710 and Section 37.A.1.a of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of the same Act. Further, the submitted GAD Accomplishment Report (AR) is not in accordance with Section 1 of the Memorandum Circular (MC) No. 2021-01 of the Philippine Commission on Women (PCW). 



We recommended and Management agreed to direct the GAD Focal Point System:



a)	Collect SDD regarding Families and Households, Employment and Livelihood, Education and Health thru sending out questionnaires to its employees and students via pen and paper questionnaires or through online surveys/ questionnaires; 



b)	Collate the above-mentioned SDD, regularly update and maintain it at the College’s GAD database and use them in analyzing and identifying gender issues in the formulation of GAD Plans, Programs and Budget;



c)	Prepare the GAD AR in accordance with the provisions of PCW to ensure that this will be endorsed when submitted thru the Gender Mainstreaming Monitoring System (GMMS) portal; and



d)	Attend in-depth GAD related trainings as there are adequate trainings provided by PCW and other accredited training centers, and there is budget for this purpose especially and in consideration with the assumption of the new GAD Head.
