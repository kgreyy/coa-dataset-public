	2)	Section 42 of Chapter 10, Volume I of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs) provides the following: 



“The Chief Accountant shall maintain the Property, Plant and Equipment Ledger Card (PPELC) for each category of PPE including work and other animals, livestock etc. The PPELC shall be kept to record promptly the acquisition, description, custody, estimated useful life, depreciation, impairment loss, disposal and other information about the asset. For check and balance, the Property and Supply Office/Unit shall likewise maintain Property Card (PC) for PPE in their custody to account for the receipt and disposition of the same. The balance per PC shall be reconciled with PPELC maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit. They shall also be reconciled with other property records like Property Acknowledgement Receipt (PAR).”



	3)	In our prior year Annual Audit Report (AAR), we noted that the Accounting Unit did not maintain complete records of the details/ PPELC of the PPE of the agency to support the recorded amount in the books required pursuant to the above cited regulation.  This is to facilitate reconciliation of accounts with the records being   maintained by the Supply Office to ensure accuracy of the amount presented in the FS.  For this deficiency, we recommended for the Accounting Unit to prepare and submit the details of the PPE and the corresponding PPELC as basis for the reconciliation with the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE).  



	4)	For current year audit, we requested the Accounting Unit to submit the required details of the accounting records and/or the PPELC to validate Management assertions on accuracy and completeness on PPE accounts.  Despite the request, the Accounting Unit failed to submit the necessary records and reports.



	5)	In view of the absence of the required records, we performed alternative procedures based on the list of PPE which was used to support the computation recognizing Accumulated Depreciation/Depreciation Expense for Calendar Year 2020 per submitted Journal Entry Voucher (JEV) as of December 31, 2020.   



	6)	Verification of the PPE amounting to P427.235 million that are subject to depreciation revealed that of the total amount, only the amount of P15.584 million was supported with complete supporting schedules while P392.301 million were either supported with schedules with incomplete information or no supporting schedules were provided by Management. 



	7)	As a result of this deficiency, Management assertion on accuracy and completeness of the PPE accounts and the related Accumulated Depreciation for PPE amounting to P392.301 million could not be validated due non-maintenance of complete records by the Accounting Unit that would substantiate the amount recorded in the books.



Other accounting deficiencies affecting the reliability of PPE Accounts



	8)	Pursuant to Section 27.c. Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs, depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use such as when it is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.  For simplicity and to avoid proportionate computation, depreciation shall be for one month if the PPE is available for use on or before the 15th of the month. However, if the PPE is available for use after the 15th of the month, depreciation shall be for the succeeding month. Likewise, Section 27.d. Depreciation of an asset ceases when the asset is derecognized.  Therefore, depreciation does not cease when the asset becomes idle or is retired from active use and held for disposal unless the asset is fully depreciated.” We noted however several errors and deficiencies in the computation of depreciation which are not in accordance with the foregoing regulations, as follows:



a)	PPE recorded under Fund 101, Fund 164 and Fund 114 showed that there are some PPEs amounting to P9.466 million that were not provided with depreciation during the CY despite the fact that these assets are not yet fully depreciated;  



b)	There were PPE that were recognized in the books during the year amounting to P31.448 million that were not also provided with depreciation;



c)	The depreciation schedule of some PPE accounts totaling P2.600 million under Fund 164 showed that the salvage value was five percent while useful life was 10 years.  However, as computed the useful life applied was for five years only as shown below: As a result, the Depreciation Expense and Accumulated Depreciation accounts is overstated by P54,295.02;



d)	In addition, the General Ledger (GL) for Fund 114 showed that the book value of Information and Communication Technology Equipment (10605030) as of year-end amounted to P7,300.00 while the Accumulated Depreciation-Information and Communication Technology Equipment (10605031) amounted to P76,481.14, or a difference of P69,181.14; and



e)	Accumulated Depreciation for PPE with a book value of P19.349 million has already exceeded the book balance by P9.286 million as illustrated in the following table:

	9)	The difference between the balance per books and per schedule of P9.287 million could represent unrecorded PPE and/or erroneous recording of PPE in the books of accounts.



	10)	Double reclassification of PPE to Semi -Expendable- P231,100.00 per JEV No. 20-01-0227 dated January 31, 2020 was drawn to recognize reclassification Furniture and Fixtures purchased in 2016. The accounting entry was a debit to Semi-Expendable Furniture and Fixtures (10406010) and a credit to Furniture and Fixtures (10607010) by P231,100.00. There was a reclassification of the account in September 2017 under JEV No. 17-09-3480 with a debit to Semi-Expendable Furniture and Fixtures (10406010) and a credit to Furniture and Fixtures (10607010) by P231,100.00. As a result, Furniture and Fixture (10607010) was understated while Semi-Expendable Furniture and Fixtures (10406010) was overstated by P231,100.00. 



	11)	Completed and/or non-moving infrastructure projects in the Construction in Progress (CIP) account – P21.382 million were not reclassified to appropriate PPE accounts. Review of the CIP account as of December 31, 2020 revealed that there are a total of 39 projects of prior years that remained in the CIP account amounting to P20.834 million in CIP- Building and Other Structures and P0.549 million in CIP- Land Improvements.  These projects remained non-moving which means that there had been no recorded progress billings for certain percentage of completion, or for those constructed by administration, any transfer of materials and cost of labor as of the period.  Interview with the College Engineer and inspection of some projects revealed that most of these projects were already completed and some already terminated such as the Construction of Administration Building Phase Three-Food Factory/Souvenir Shop. Hence, these projects should have been reclassified to corresponding PPE account and should have been depreciated from the time of completion. For the Supply Center Building with contract amount of P4.990 million, though already completed, the amount of P129,729.20 representing 2.6 percent accomplishment was not yet recorded in the CIP account. The net amount of P102,161.75 was instead applied to the project cost deficiency amounting to P142,855.00 in which the balance of P40,693.25 was paid by the Contractor and taken up as a reduction to Office Building account. Thus, the balance to date only amounted to P4.890 million. (See Appendix A, for the details of the projects.)



	12)	 Military, Police and Security Equipment for Fund 101 amounting to P10,968.50 was recorded under PPE contravening Section 3, Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs which provides the item of PPE shall be recognized as asset if it meets the capitalization threshold of P15,000.00.



	13)	Fully depreciated assets amounting to P6.394 million was recorded as Other Assets and was not reclassified to appropriate PPE account which is not in consonance with Section 40, Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs which provides that “A PPE is said to be fully depreciated when the carrying amount is equal to zero or residual value. The cost of fully depreciated assets remaining in service and the related accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses shall not be removed from the accounts.”



	14)	All the above deficiencies affected Management’s assertion on the accuracy and completeness of PPE and related accounts and rendered the balance presented in the FS unreliable. 



 Recommendation 



	15)	We recommended and Management agreed to:



a)	Advice the Accountant to prepare and maintain PPELC for each item of PPE; submit complete supporting schedule to establish the completeness and correctness of each of the account balances amounting to P411.651 million; review and compute depreciation for all depreciable assets based on complete schedules supporting the recorded PPE and make the necessary accounting entries to correct errors in the computation of Accumulated Depreciation;

   

b)	Direct the Accountant to adjust double recording of reclassification entry for Furniture and Fixtures (10607010) by P231,100.00; account and reclassify fully depreciated assets recorded under the Other Assets account and reclassify them to their appropriate PPE accounts, and reclassify to its appropriate account Military, Police and Security Equipment amounting to P10,968.50 recorded under PPE account; 



c)	Direct the concerned agency officials to determine the status of non-moving projects and the date of their completion; prepare and submit the necessary documents for projects already completed and due for reclassification to PPE; 



d)	Direct the Accountant to prepare the necessary adjusting entries when such necessary documents are already available including the provision of the accumulated depreciation and depreciation expense; and



e)	Look into the noted deficiencies for the Supply Center Building and make the necessary adjusting entries including its subsequent reclassification to PPE, and the provision of accumulated depreciation and depreciation expense.



1)	The validity of the Receivable account is doubtful due to the absence of Schedule of Receivables and/or details supporting the amount presented in the FS at P18.566 million; non-provision for Allowance for Impairment for Receivables whose collectability is uncertain; and unsupported deduction made from Receivables-Disallowances/ Charges that would allow verification of accuracy of the amount recorded. 



	1)	This is a reiteration of prior years’ audit observation. 



	2)	The year-end balance of the receivable accounts amounted to P18.566 million and broken down as follows:

	3)	Section 27, Chapter 7, Vol. I of the GAM for NGAs on Financial Instruments requires the preparation of a Schedule of Accounts Receivable (SAR) (Appendix 55) as of reporting date to substantiate the corresponding balances per books.  This schedule is supposed to show the aging as well as comments on the status of the receivable accounts in the Remarks column. These data are needed as reference in determining collectibility of receivables. For CY 2020, despite our recommendations in our audit of 2019 accounts, Management still failed to submit the SAR. 



Non-provision of Allowance for Impairment – P18.566 million



	4)	For proper valuation of financial assets, an assessment should be made to determine whether an asset is impaired or not. Assessment could be made thru reference to the SAR.  Since the College has been unable to prepare the SAR, assessment of the collectability and identification of specific uncollectible accounts could not be done. 



	5)	In the absence of the SAR, we made a general assessment of the receivable accounts based only on the movements of entries in the GL for current and prior periods to check if there are indications of impairment and we noted the following:



a)	AR amounting to P0.914 million represents unpaid tuition and miscellaneous fees of Masteral students, and collectibles from rental on food stalls as well as light and water, while P3,785.36 pertains to billing for light and water in February 2017;



b)	Loans Receivable-Others amounting to P2.908 million has remained outstanding for the years 2015 to 2020, implying problem/s and/or no collections made on the receivables account;



c)	Inter-Agency Receivables and Due from LGUs amounting to P0.513 million and P520.00 respectively, have been dormant for more than eight years while the amount of P11.012 million represents billing to Commission on Higher Education (CHED) for Free Tuition; and



d)	Other Receivables amounting to P1.062 million remained outstanding for more than eight years. 



	6)	Section 9, Chapter 5: Revenue and Other Receipts, Volume I of the same Manual, provides; 



“Impairment Losses and Allowance for Impairment Losses. When an uncertainty arises about the collectibility of an amount already included in revenue, the uncollectible amount, or the amount in respect of which recovery has ceased to be probable, is recognized as an expense (impairment losses), rather than as an adjustment of the amount of revenue originally recognized. 



Entities shall evaluate the collectibility of accounts receivable on an ongoing basis based on historical bad debts, customer/recipient credit-worthiness, current economic trends and changes in payment activity. An allowance is provided for known and estimated bad debts.”



	7)	Further, Chapter 7 of the same Manual on Financial Instruments also provides the following; 



“Section 10. Impairment of Financial Assets. An entity shall assess at the end of each reporting period whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired. If any such evidence exists, the entity shall measure the amount of loss as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset shall be reduced either directly or through use of an allowance account. The amount of the loss shall be recognized in surplus or deficit.

 

In case of AR, the Allowance for Impairment shall be provided in an amount based on collectibility of receivable balances and evaluation of such factors as aging of accounts, collection experiences of the agency, expected loss experiences and identified doubtful accounts.”



	8)	As a consequence of not preparing the SAR, the agency was not able to assess the receivables for impairment and ultimately recognize impairment loss for accounts which were found to have indications of impairment. Thus, affecting assertions on proper valuation and fairness of presentation of receivable accounts in the FS.



Recommendation 



	9)	We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Accountant to:



a)	Prepare and submit the SAR;



b)	Assess the collectibility of various receivables based on the aging of accounts, collection experiences of the agency and expected loss experiences; and



c)	Provide the necessary Allowance for Impairment Loss on such receivable accounts in consonance with Section 9, Chapter 5 and Section 10 and 27, Chapter 7 of the GAM for NGAs. 



Reduction of the Receivable-Disallowances/Charges without pertinent supporting documents 



	10)	Section 58, Chapter 2 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445, otherwise known as the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines provides:



“Section 58. Audit of assets. – The examination and audit of assets shall be performed with a view of ascertaining their existence, ownership, valuation and encumbrances as well as the propriety of items composing the respective asset accounts; determining their agreement with records; proving the accuracy of such records; ascertaining if the assets were utilized economically, efficiently and effectively; and evaluating the adequacy of controls over the accounts.”



	11)	On July 31, 2017 a JEV No. 17-07-2717 amounting to P0.706 million was taken up to recognize settlement of disallowances covered by Certificate of Settlement and Balances (CSB) No. 2002-003-101-(2000) dated January 9, 2002. The accounting entry was a debit to Accumulated Surplus (Deficit) and a credit to Receivables-Disallowances/Charges.  



	12)	Verification of the supporting documents attached to the JEV showed that only a copy of the CSB was attached together with the Summary of Settlement to CSB No. 00-06-101 dated June 30, 2000 issued on January 9, 2002. No other supporting documents were attached such as copy of the Notices of Disallowances covering the disallowed amounts, information relative to the manner of settlement and the corresponding JEV taking up the disallowance in the books of accounts.



	13)	As a result, settlement amounting to P0.706 million could not be validly verified due to incomplete supporting documents/information thus affecting the propriety and accuracy of the account.

Recommendation



	14)	We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Accountant to submit supporting documents to determine the propriety and accuracy of the JEV taking up the settlement by P0.706 million, and the corresponding JEV recognizing the disallowances and its GL account. 



2)	Inventory balance amounting to P6.556 million presented in the FS as of December 31, 2020 contained various errors and deficiencies thus, affecting the propriety and reliability of the account balances as of year-end. 



Unrecorded issuances and untraceable ending Inventory 



	1)	Section 7, Chapter 8 of GAM for NGAs provides the following: 



“Recognition as an Expense. When inventories are sold, exchanged, or distributed, their carrying amount shall be recognized as an expense in the period in which the related revenue is recognized. If there is no related revenue, the expense is recognized when the goods are distributed or the related service is rendered.” 

	

	2)	During CY 2020, a total of P54,865.50 and P1.584 million construction materials under Fund 101 and Fund 164 respectively, were purchased and debited to the Construction Materials Inventory account. Review of the postings in the GL showed that there were no issuances except for the P34,279.00 made on October 2020 under Fund 101 for the replenishment of Petty Cash Fund (PCF). 

	

	3)	Verification and comparison of the Report on the Physical Count of Inventory (RPCI) against purchase orders (POs) and other supporting documents for the purchases made during the year, disclosed that some of the items procured amounting to P0.705 million were no longer included in the RPCI and some of the items from the beginning balance of P6,670.00 were also not included in the year end RPCI resulting in P0.712 million issuances not reflected in the books. Details of these items are shown in Appendix B. The non-recording in the books was due to the non-submission of the required Requisition and Issue Slip (RIS) and related Report of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI) in support to this issuance. 



	4)	We have also noted that a total of P1.114 million construction materials form part of the ending inventory per RPCI though the same does not belong to neither the beginning balance nor the purchases made during the year, detailed list of which is presented in Appendix C.



	5)	Verification was supposed to be extended to the Stock Cards (SCs) maintained by the Supply Office to determine the source of these items, and with the Supplies Ledger Cards (SLCs) maintained by the Accounting Office. However, the same was not furnished the Team despite various verbal and written requests. 



	6)	This issue was repeatedly raised to the Management yet the same has not been addressed as of December 31, 2020. It also appears that the Accounting Office did not take part in the preparation of the RPCI which would include the reconciliation of items found on hand with their records. 



	7)	As a result of the non-recording of various issuances made during the year, the Construction Materials Inventory account is overstated by P0.712 million and related expense account is understated by the same amount. Also, the reliability of the RPCI for this particular inventory account is doubtful due to some untraceable items included in the year-end inventory count. 



Recommendation



	8)	We recommended and Management agreed to: 



a)	Direct the Supply Officer to prepare the RIS and related RSMI for all the issued construction materials inventory and submit the same to Accounting Office;



b)	Direct the Accountant to prepare the necessary adjusting entries to record the issuance of construction materials inventory account based on the supporting documents submitted by the Supply Officer;



c)	Direct the Accounting Office to take part in the next inventory taking to facilitate the reconciliation of the balances resulting from the inventory taking, and of recorded amounts in the books; 



d)	Direct the Supply Officer to maintain the SCs for Construction Materials Inventory and the Accounting Office to maintain the SLCs to facilitate reconciliation of the Inventory account; and  



e)	Provide for explanation and supporting documents for the P1.114 million construction inventory items which form part of the year-end inventory on hand.

	10)	JEV No. 20-01-01110 dated January 31, 2020 was drawn to recognize under booking of issuances of supplies and materials amounting to P21,900.00. The accounting entry was a debit to Semi-Expendable Technical and Scientific Equipment Expenses (50203220-01) and a credit to Semi-Expendable Technical and Scientific Equipment (10406010) by P21,900.00.



	11)	Audit revealed that the account number for Semi-Expendable Technical and Scientific Equipment Expenses is 50203210, while the account number for Semi-Expendable Technical and Scientific Equipment is 10405130.   



	12)	As a result, Semi-Expendable Furniture, Fixtures and Book Expenses (50203220) is overstated and Semi-Expendable Furniture and Fixtures (10406010) is understated by P21,900.00. Conversely, understating and overstating Semi-Expendable Technical and Scientific Equipment Expenses and Semi-Expendable Technical and Scientific Equipment accounts, respectively by P21,900.00. 



	13)	In addition, the agency purchased 10 units of Secure Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) 2000 Volt-Amps (VA) delivered in December 20, 2019 and three units of Orion UPS 1500 VA and six pieces High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) Cable delivered in January 14. 2020. These were accounted for as a debit to Semi-Expendable Information and Communication Technology Equipment (10405020) and Accounts Payable (20101010) amounting to P58,900.00. These were issued with a debit to Semi-Expendable Information and Communication Technology Expense (502032100-03) and a credit to Semi-Expendable Information and Communication Technology (10405030). 



	14)	Analysis of the accounting entry revealed that there was an error in the use of the account name as against the account number since the account number for account name Semi-Expendable Information and Communication Technology Equipment should be (10405030) instead of (10405020).  These were posted in the GL under the latter account number (10405020) as illustrated below:

	15)	As a result, Semi-Expendable Office Equipment (10405020) was overstated while Semi-Expendable Information and Communication Technology Equipment (10405030) was understated by P58,900.00.



Recommendation



	16)	We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Accountant to: 



a)	Prepare adjusting entry to correct overstatement of Semi-Expendable Furniture, Fixtures and Book Expenses (50203220) and understatement of Semi-Expendable Furniture and Fixtures (10406010) by P21,900.00; 



b)	Prepare appropriate adjusting entry to correct the understatement of Semi-Expendable Information and Communication Technology Equipment (10405030) by P58,900.00; and 



c)	Observe the proper account number as prescribed in Chapter 3, Volume III of the GAM for NGAs.



Incorrectly booked-up replenishment of PCF as Inventory instead of Expense 



	17)	Section 9, Chapter 8 on Inventories of GAM for NGAs provides the following: 



“Section 9. Perpetual Inventory Method. Supplies and materials purchased for inventory purpose shall be recorded using the perpetual inventory system, resulting in a more accurate inventory records and a running total for the cost of goods sold in each period. The system requires accounting records to show the amount of inventory on hand at all times through the maintenance of the SLC (Appendix 57) by the Accounting Division/Unit and SC (Appendix 58) by the Supply and/or Property Division/Unit for each item in stock. Regular purchases shall be coursed through the inventory account and issues thereof shall be recorded as they take place except for supplies and materials purchased out of PCF for immediate use or on emergency cases which shall be charged directly to the appropriate expense accounts.”



	18)	Also, Section 13, Chapter 6 of the same Manual provides the following illustrative accounting entry for the replenishment of petty cash:



Account Title

Credit

Expense 

xxx



     Cash (Modified Disbursement System)



xxx

     To recognize replenishment of PCF based on the Report on Paid Petty Cash Vouchers (RRPCV) and supporting documents. 

	

	19)	In addition, Section 35 of the same Chapter and Manual states that the PCF shall be maintained using the Imprest system where all replenishments shall be directly charged to the expense account. 



	20)	Review of the replenishments made under the PCF from January to October 2020 disclosed that instead of directly charging expense accounts, inventory accounts were set-up, to wit:

	22)	The above entries corrected the deficiency noted when the replenishments were made and inventory accounts were set-up instead of directly booking these up as expenses. However, the perpetual inventory system that requires purchased items be recorded as Inventory first is not applicable for items purchased thru the PCF. Rather, upon replenishment, expenses should be recorded outright as illustrated in the above entry provided by GAM for NGAs, and in consideration of the Imprest System for PCF. 



	23)	The replenishments made under Check Nos. 10918646 and 10918704 amounting to P74,324.00 and P74,698.00, respectively, were not adjusted to set-up the corresponding expense accounts for the various issuances made resulting to the understatement of the affected expense, and the corresponding overstatement of the affected inventory accounts. 



	24)	The replenishment of expenses for the months of October to December 2020 were however directly recorded as debit to expense accounts and credited to Petty Cash due to the retirement of the PCF Custodian and the closing of this account by end of the year as shown below:

Recommendation



	25)	We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Accounting Unit: 



a)	To observe the proper recording of replenishments of the PCF, that is to expense the same and not to prepare another or separate JEV for the issuance; 



b)	Prepare the necessary journal entries to correct the replenishment under Check Nos. 10918646 and 10918704; and



c)	To add the RSMI as supporting document in the replenishment thereof. 

Incorrect recognition of purchases related to food processing operation and aquaculture 



	26)	Chapter 3, Volume III - The Revised Charts of Accounts (Updated 2019) of the GAM for NGAs as prescribed under COA Circular No. 2020-001 dated January 8, 2020 provides:

	28)	However, audit disclosed that these were treated as an outright expense, debiting Other Maintenance and Operating Expense (50299990) account instead of the appropriate inventory account – Finished Goods Inventory (10403030) under Inventory Held for Manufacturing since these were already reported to have been utilized in production as stated in the attached accomplishment report.

	29)	Considering that these items are used in the production, proper accounting of materials and ingredients is important. Purchased raw materials shall be recorded in the Raw Materials Inventory that will eventually form part of the Finished Goods Inventory once already used in production and shall not be treated as an outright expense. Eventually, these will form part of the cost of sales when such items will be sold.

	32)	Items 1 to 4 are aquaculture related supplies and were used for fishpond/floating cages preparation, therefore the amount P12,396.00 should have been debited to Agricultural and Marine Supplies Expenses (50203100) while the Bangus Fry amounting to P4,200.00 should have been debited to Aquaculture (10701040) as the purchase relates to agricultural activity, that is, management of the biological transformation and harvest of biological asset for sale or for conversion into agricultural produce. It was gathered that it is the objective of the Corporate Affairs Office to manage the purchased fry for their eventual use in the production of various Bangus products, fitting the description of agricultural activity and its recognition as Aquaculture (10701040). 



	33)	Proper recognition and classification of accounts is necessary to ensure that reliable amounts are reflected in the financial reports. The erroneous classification of these particular assets and expenses is contrary to the aforementioned provision which may result to the misstatements of the accounts involved if not corrected.

	

	Recommendation 



	34)	We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Accounting Unit to make the necessary adjustments to the affected accounts and to ensure all purchases related to food processing operation and aquaculture are recorded in proper assets and expense accounts in consonance with Chapter 3, Volume III – The Revised Chart of Accounts (Updated 2019) of the GAM for NGAs. 



Booking up of undelivered Office Supplies 



	35)	Chapter 3, Volume III of the GAM for NGAs provides:

Description

This account is used to recognize the cost or value of purchased/acquired office supplies such as bond papers, inks, and small tangible items like staple wire removers, punchers, staplers and other similar items for government operations.  Credit this account for issuance to end-users, transfers, loss or other disposal.



	36)	On December 28, 2020, the agency issued check no. 11037054 payable to the Procurement Service (PS) amounting to P1,395.00 for the payment of office supplies covered by PS Agency Procurement Request (APR) No. 20-1644 dated December 18, 2020. An Official Receipt (OR) No. 7285813 C dated March 2, 2021 was issued by the Procurement Service to acknowledge receipt of payment.  The accounting entry was as follows:

       To recognize payment of Supplies purchased in the PS.



	37)	Review of the disbursement showed that the Office Supplies were delivered on March 2, 2021 per Delivery Receipt (DR) No. ROIX-21499 as Certified by the Depot Supply Officer, approved for delivery by the Depot Supervisor/ Asst. Supervisor and released by the Depot Storekeeper on the same date. 



	38)	Audit revealed that the accounting entry to recognize the payment of the office supplies in December 28, 2020 with a debit to Office Supplies Inventory (10404010) is not appropriate considering that the office supplies were delivered in March 2, 2021.



	39)	As a result, Office Supplies Inventory (10404010) was overstated by P1,395.00.



	Recommendation 



	40)	We recommended that Management advice the Accountant to refrain from processing payment for office supplies not yet delivered and observe the proper recognition of the account in accordance with Chapter 3, Volume III of the GAM for NGAs. 



Management Comment



	41)	The Accounting Office will observe proper recognition of account for office supplies from PS but the processing of payment or check must be done ahead of time because the PS will only issue the supplies if the check or payment is already available.



Auditor’s Rejoinder



	42)	If early payment is unavoidable, the Accounting Unit may record similar purchase of supplies as receivable from PS, but not as Office Supplies Inventory until the same is delivered. 



3)	Accounts Payable included partially delivered and undelivered supplies, equipment, and furniture and fixtures amounting to P0.947 million, resulting in the overstatement of the liability account by the said amount, and consequently overstating Office Supplies Inventory by P0.475 million, Semi-Expendable Furniture and Fixtures by P0.241 million, Office Equipment by P0.181 million and Furniture and Fixtures by P0.050 million. 



	1)	Sec. 2.a, Chapter 2, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs provides:

 

“Sec. 2. Definition of Terms.  For the purpose of this Manual, the term used as stated below shall be construed to mean as follows:



	a)	Accrual basis - means a basis of accounting under which transactions and other events are recognized when they occur (and not only when cash or its equivalent is received or paid). Therefore, the transactions and events are recognized in the accounting records and recognized in the financial statements of the periods to which they relate.  The elements recognized under the accrual accounting are assets, liabilities, net assets/equity, revenue, and expenses.”



	2)	Likewise, Sec. 2.a, Chapter 6, Volume I of the same manual provides:



“Sec. 2. Definition of Terms.  For the purpose of this Manual, the term used as stated below shall be construed to mean as follows:



a)	Accounts Payable – refers to valid and legal obligations of NGAs/OUs, for which, goods/ services/ projects have been delivered/ rendered/ completed and accepted, regardless of the year when these obligations were incurred.”



	3)	As of December 31, 2020, Accounts Payable had account balances of P5.820 million, P2.886 million and P221,401.60 under Funds 101, 164, and 114, respectively. 



	4)	Verification showed that partially delivered supplies, equipment, and Furniture and Fixtures amounting to P0.922 million and Office Equipment not yet delivered amounting to P24,793.60 were recognized in the books and formed part of the liability account. Details are as follows:

	5)	The partially delivered items were not supported with Inspection and Acceptance Report (IAR), and attached to the JEV was only the PO noting therein that some items were not yet delivered. Also, review of the disbursement voucher (DV) showed that check no. 59208727 dated November 5, 2020 amounting to P24,793.60 payable to the PS was drawn to process purchase of one Unit Desktop Computer recorded in the books as a debit to Office Equipment account. The check was unreleased as of December 31, 2020 and was reverted to Cash in Bank – LCCA account with a corresponding credit to Accounts Payable.



	6)	Since these items were not yet fully delivered and/or remained undelivered as of year-end, the cost of these items should not form part of the Accounts Payable of the agency.



	7)	As a result, the reported balance of Accounts Payable (20101010) was overstated by P0.947 million and the following accounts were also overstated: Semi-Expendable Furniture and Fixtures (10406010) by P241,300.00; Office Equipment (10605020) by P180,793.60; Furniture and Fixtures (10607010) by P50,000.00; and Office Supplies Inventory (10404010) by P474,792.45.



Recommendation



	8)	We recommend and Management agreed to direct the Accountant to:



a)	Prepare the necessary adjusting entries to correct overstatement of Accounts Payable and various asset accounts by P0.947 million; and



b)	Recognize and take up liability only when goods/services/projects have been delivered/rendered/completed and accepted in keeping with Section 2.a, Chapter 2, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs.



Improper recognition of prior years’ expenditures – P0.842 million net overstatement 



4)	Total expenditures for CY 2020 had a net overstatement of P0.842 million due to improper recognition of prior years’ expenditures as current and non-recognition of current year expenses which is not in keeping with Volumes I and III of the GAM for NGAs. 



	1)	Sec. 2, Chapter 2, General Provision, Basic Standards and Policies, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs as prescribed under Commission on Audit (COA) Circular No. 2015-007 dated October 22, 2015, provides among others:



“Sec. 2. Definition of Terms.  For the purpose of this Manual, the term used as stated below shall be construed to mean as follows:



a)	Accrual basis - means a basis of accounting under which transaction and other events are recognized when they occur (and not only when cash or its equivalent is received or paid). Therefore, the transactions and events are recognized in the accounting records and recognized in the financial statements of the periods to which they relate.  The elements recognized under the accrual accounting are assets, liabilities, net assets/equity, revenue, and expenses.”

	4)	Verification of JEV No. 20-12-4622 revealed that the payroll computation pertains to compensation for excess load for the 1st and 2nd Semester, School Year (SY) 2019-2020 covering the month of August to December 2019 and January to May 2020 amounting to P225,588.39 and P347,914.67, respectively. 



	5)	The accounting entry for JEV No. 20-12-4622 recognizing the full amount of P0.574 million as Salaries and Wages-Regular (50101010) was not appropriate considering that the amount of P225,588.89 was a proper charge to Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) (30101010) since these were incurred in 2019. 



	6)	Likewise, JEV No. 20-12-4802 in the amount of P355,132.00 recognizing the prior years’ expenditure as expenses for the year was not proper since these were incurred in 2019. 



	7)	Being a self-correcting, the said error has no effect on Accumulated Surplus account as of December 31, 2020, however, the following accounts as presented in the Statement of Financial Performance were overstated:   Salaries: Wages-Regular (50101010) by P500,844.39; PERA (50102010) by P24,000.00; Mid-Year Bonus (50102160) by P22,938.00; Year-End Bonus (50102140) by P22,938.00;   Cash Gift. (50102150) by P5,000.00 and Productivity Enhancement Incentive (50102990) by P5,000.00.  



	8)	In addition, JEV No. 20-01-0214 dated January 31, 2020 was drawn to recognize issuances of Semi- Expendable Furniture, Fixtures and Book Expenses (50203220-01) amounting to P231,100.00 described as follows:

	10)	Audit revealed that the accounting entry was not appropriate considering that the items were issued in November 2016. The correct accounting entry should have been a debit to Accumulated Surplus (Deficit) (30101010), instead of Semi-Expendable Furniture, Fixtures and Book Expenses (50203220-01).



	11)	Likewise, JEV No. 20-01-0212 dated January 31, 2020 was also drawn to recognize issuances of Semi- Expendable Office Equipment amounting to P50,250.00 described as follows:

	13)	Audit revealed that the accounting entry was not proper considering that the semi-expendable office equipment was issued in 2017. The correct accounting entry should had been a debit to Accumulated Surplus (Deficit) (30101010) instead of Semi-Expendable Machinery and Equipment Expenses- Office Equipment (50203210-02).



	14)	As a result, Semi-Expendable Furniture, Fixtures and Book Expenses (50203220-01) and Semi-Expendable Machinery and Equipment Expenses- Office Equipment (50203210-02) are overstated by P231,100.00 and P50,250.00, respectively, totaling P281,350.00 overstatement of current year expense. 



	15)	On December 1, 2020, Mindanao Association of State Tertiary Schools (MASTS) Advisory No. 004, S. 2020 was issued on the payment of Annual Institutional Membership Dues for CY 2020.



	16)	On December 3, 2020, the amount of P20,000.00 was obligated under Obligation Request and Status (ORS) No. 02-101101-2020-12-015 and was issued Check No. 11037024 on December 4, 2020 under DV No. 2020-12-0811 dated December 3, 2020.  The accounting entry was as follows:

	17)	Audit revealed that the accounting entry debiting Other Prepayments (19902990) is not appropriate considering that the expenditure was for CY 2020. The appropriate accounting entry is Membership Dues & Contribution to Organization (50299060).



	18)	As a result, Other Prepayments (19902990) was overstated while Membership Dues & Contribution to Organization (50299060) was understated by P20,000.00.



	19)	Taking into consideration the aforementioned deficiencies of charging prior year expenses as current expenditure and the non-recording of current year expense, total expenditures for CY 2020 had a net overstatement of P0.842 million presented in the following table:

Recommendation



	20)	We recommended and Management agreed to advice the Accountant to:



a)	Refrain from recognizing prior year expenses as expenses for the current year in consonance with the accrual basis of accounting; 



b)	Prepare appropriate adjusting entry to correct overstatement of Other Prepayments (19902990) by P20,000.00; and



c)	Observe the proper recording of financial transactions in consonance with Chapter 3, Volume III - The Revised Charts of Accounts (Updated 2019) of the GAM for NGAs as prescribed under COA Circular No. 2020-001.



Incorrect entry for reversion of unpaid billings of School Fees – P0.793 million



5)	Reversion of unpaid billing for the 1st and 2nd Semesters of SY 2018-2019 amounting to P0.793 million was recognized as a reduction from School Fees (40202010) instead of as Accounts Receivables (10301010) which is not in consonance with Chapter 3, Volume III - The Revised Charts of Accounts (Updated 2019) of the GAM for NGAs, thereby understating School Fees for the year.



	1)	Chapter 3, Volume III - The Revised Charts of Accounts (Updated 2019) of the GAM for NGAs as prescribed under COA Circular No. 2020-001 provides as follows:

	3)	The accounting entries were inappropriate considering that the school fees were earned in the previous years and the books of account for these periods were already closed.  The accounting entry should have been a debit to Accounts Receivable (10301010) to establish the collectibles from the students since these were not recognized by CHED UniFAST.



	4)	As a result, School Fees (40202010) and Accounts Receivable (10301010) accounts were understated by P0.793 million. 

Recommendation



	5)	We recommended and Management agreed to advice the Accountant to:



a)	Prepare appropriate adjusting entry to recognize Accounts Receivable (10301010) and Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) (30101010) by P0.793 million; and 



b)	Observe the proper recording of financial transactions in consonance with Chapter 3, Volume III - The Revised Charts of Accounts (Updated 2019) of the GAM for NGAs. 



Incorrect accounting entry for Hazard Payment – P359,500.00



6)	Hazard Pay account has a net understatement of P359,500.00 due to incorrect accounting entries, consequently misstating other affected accounts.    



	1)	Administrative Order No. 26 dated March 23, 2020 was issued by the Office of the President authorizing the grant of hazard pay to government personnel who physically report for work during the period of implementation of Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) relative to the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. 



	2)	Budget Circular (BC) No. 2020-1 dated March 24, 2020 was also issued by the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) setting the guidelines on the grant of the COVID-19 Hazard Pay including the conditions on the grant and the Funding Source: 



	“4.0 Guidelines and Conditions on the Grant of the COVID-19 Hazard Pay

	4)	Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, the City of Zamboanga was placed under ECQ starting March 20, 2020 and though the ECQ was lifted by May 1, the City was allowed by the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) on Emerging Infectious Diseases to remain under ECQ until May 15. 



	5)	In light of the situation, personnel of ZSCMST were ordered to observe the work from home (WFH) arrangement except for frontline units such as finance department, selected units identified by the Dean of Student Academic Services, and all security personnel who were required to report following the “skeletal force” until the EQC was lifted per Unnumbered Memo dated March 18, 2020. Unnumbered Memo dated March 23, 2020 was also issued directing the personnel of the Office of the College President to physically report for work to carry out urgent tasks, and other personnel for the continuous operation of Marino News FM Station. Unnumbered Memo dated March 26, 2020 created the ZSCMST COVID-19 Emergency Response Task Force to work on initiatives relative to the adverse impacts brought by the pandemic to vulnerable members of the community, and along with other memoranda which required personnel to be physically present in their work stations. 



	6)	COVID-19 Hazard Payments amounting to P423,000.00 was made to these personnel as benefit since they were exposed to health risks and hazards when they physically reported for work during ECQ. Two JOs were paid a total of P6,500.00 charged to MOOE of Fund 164 (Tuition and Other Fees) and two JOs were paid a total of P13,000.00 which was charged to MOOE of Fund 114 (Aquaculture). For Fund 101, two JO were paid a total of P3,500.00 charged to MOOE, two Casuals, P17,000.00 charged to PS, and 43 regular employees both teaching and non-teaching were paid a total of P383,000.00 charged to PS thru budget realignment duly approved by the College President covered by the following Reallocation Advice for use of PS Appropriations (RAPSA):

	7)	Review of the covering DVs and corresponding journal entries made, showed that some payments were charged to expense accounts other than Hazard Pay for personnel occupying regular, contractual or casual positions, and OMOE for personnel under COS and JO as shown in Appendix D. 



	8)	The incorrect accounting entries used resulted in net understatement of the Hazard Pay account by P359,500.00, overstatement of Salaries and Wages- Regular, Other Professional Services and Labor and Wages by P378,000.00, P4,000.00 and P500.00, respectively, and understatement of OMOE by P23,000.00.



	9)	In addition to the above deficiency, it was also noted that the hazard payment covered by Fund 114 (Aquaculture) was incorrectly posted in the Hazard Pay account of Fund 164 (Tuition and Other Fees). 



Recommendation 



	10)	We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Accountant to prepare adjusting entries to correct the affected account balances and to observe the proper recording of transactions in the future. 



Unrecorded book reconciling items- P17,697.63



7)	Book reconciling items amounting to P17,697.63 remained unrecorded in the books of accounts as of year-end contrary to Section 6, Chapter 21, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs. Likewise, bank reconciling items with net amount of P16,973.25 were also unadjusted as of year-end.



	1)	Section 2, Chapter 21, Volume I of the GAM defines Bank Reconciliation as settlement of differences contained in the bank statement and cash account in the agency’s/entity’s books of accounts.



	2)	Section 6 of the same Manual further provides:



	“Section 6. Recognition of Adjustments.  The Chief Accountant/Designated Staff shall prepare a JEV to recognize all reconciling items that require adjustment and correction in the books of accounts.”



	3)	This is a reiteration of prior years’ audit observation.

	4)	Verification of the Bank Reconciliation Statement (BRS) for CY 2020 showed that book and bank reconciling items amounting to P17,697.63 and P16,973.25, respectively, remained unadjusted despite the previous recommendation to require the officials/ employees concerned to look into these reconciling items and ensure that these are properly adjusted.

	5)	While the amounts may not be material, these reconciling items should be adjusted immediately to avoid stacking of reconciling items in the future BRS, to facilitate proper adjustment and correction and to ensure that proper accounting is implemented by both parties.



	6)	The unrecorded book reconciling items affects the accuracy of the Cash in Bank balance in the books of the agency.



Recommendation



	7)	We recommended and Management agreed to:



a)	Direct the Accountant to look into these reconciling items, obtain supporting documents, and prepare the necessary adjusting entries;



b)	Ensure that all reconciling items after the preparation of the BRS are taken up in the books of accounts in consonance with Section 6, Chapter 21, Volume I of the GAM; and 



c)	Call the attention or make representation with the bank concerned about the errors discovered upon receipt of the monthly Bank Statements.



Unsubstantiated Due to Other NGAs account – P42.539 million



8)	Subsidiary records were not submitted to substantiate account Due to Other NGAs (20201050) amounting to P42.539 million. As a result, Management assertion on the accuracy of the account balance presented in the FS as of December 31, 2021 could not be validated. Further, the amount of P10.586 million has no account movement for three years which is not in keeping with Paragraph 6 of COA Circular No. No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994.



	1)	Paragraph 6 of COA Circular No. 94-013 entitled Rules and Regulations in the Grant, Utilization and Liquidation of Funds Transferred to Implementing Agencies (IAs) provides among others:



“6. DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES



	       The IA shall:



6.3	keep separate subsidiary records for the trust liability whether or not a separate bank account is maintained;



      6.7	return to the Source Agency (SA) any unused balance and refund of disallowance upon completion of the project.”

	3)	Verification showed that Due to Other NGAs for Fund 101 amounting to P10.533 million had no account movement in 2017.  In 2018, it had an ending balance of P10.586 million, or an increase of P52,795.69 which remained non-moving as of December 31, 2019.  In 2020, there were account movement representing deductions from salaries and wages of personnel for loans availed with the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP). 



	4)	In Fund 164 are funds received for the Senior High, while Fund 114 comprised of P2.816 million for Student Assistance Fund for Education (SAFE) Scholarship, P22.600 million for Mindanao Advance Education Program (MAEP)-Tertiary Education Subsidy (TES) and P0.601 million for Department of Science and Technology (DOST)- Food Innovation Center (FIC).



	5)	Further, verification showed that there is no account title Due to Other NGAs (20201050) since the correct account title is Due to NGAs (20201050).



	6)	A request for the submission of the subsidiary records to support the account balances was requested in 2020.  Likewise, Aging Schedule for Due to Other NGAs (2020) was also requested for the P42.539 million balance as of December 31, 2020.  However, none of these records and schedules were submitted. This is a reiteration of the previous year audit recommendation requiring the submission subsidiary records as required in the aforementioned provision.



	7)	As a result, Management assertion on the accuracy of the account balance presented in the FS as of December 31, 2021, could not be validated. 



Recommendation



	8)	We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Accounting Unit to:



a)	Reclassify the account Due to Other NGAs to Due to NGAs;



b)	Account for the composition of Due to NGAs by submitting the individual subsidiary records/schedules of the transferred funds; and 



c)	Evaluate the balance of the non-moving account amounting to P10.586 million for possible return to the SA in accordance with Paragraph 6.3 and 6.7 of COA Circular No. No. 94-013 



Salary payment not properly recognized in the books 



9)	Deposits and corresponding payments of salaries and wages to agency personnel through ATM for the year amounting to P59.996 million under the agency’s Payroll Account were not properly recognized in the books, contrary to Section 109 of PD No. 1445.

	1)	Government Accounting encompasses the process of analyzing, recording, classifying, summarizing and communicating all transactions involving the receipt and disposition of government funds and property and interpreting the results thereof. (Section 109, PD No. 1445).



	2)	The agency maintains a bank account with the DBP, under account name ZSCMST-ATM Savings Account No. 0955-019473-530. The account was established for ZSCMST Payroll wherein all payment for salaries and wages of personnel under Fund 101, Fund 164 and Fund 114 are deposited. This bank account was accounted for under Fund 114 with a balance of P74,276.94 at year-end.



	3)	During the year, a total of P59.996 million were paid to the various personnel of this Agency thru the Payroll account, broken down as follows:

	4)	The checks/ ADA drawn for the payment of these salaries were payable to ZSCMST Payroll, deposited to ZSCMST-ATM Savings account maintained under Fund 114 for subsequent payment to the individual personnel thru ATM.



	5)	Audit revealed that upon disbursement, the following entries were made to recognize payment of salaries and wages thru ATM (varies per specific fund):

	6)	The accounting entry under Fund 114 covered only the establishment of the expense incurred and the disbursements, but did not record/recognize all the transfers/ deposits from all funds and the subsequent withdrawals made from the payroll account. As for the accounting entry to deposit salaries and wages thru ATM under Fund 101, this could have been appropriate had the payroll account been accounted under the same fund. However as abovementioned, this payroll account was accounted for under Fund 114. Although the Cash in Bank-LCCA account in Fund 101 had zero balance at year-end, the accounting entries made were inappropriate.

	7)	The correct accounting entries should have been:

	8)	Considering that the payee ZSCMST Payroll is a depository account of the agency, all deposits and withdrawals to and from the account should be properly recognized and accounted for in the books.



	9)	As a result, there is a misstatement on the recording of the financial transactions of the agency specifically on its payroll account under Fund 114. 



Recommendation



	10)	We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Accountant to:



a)	Discontinue the practice of debiting Cash in Bank – LCCA in Fund 101 to record transfer/deposit to the ATM Savings account and its subsequent credit to recognize payment made thru the ATM, considering that this ATM account is maintained in Fund 114;



b)	Record/recognize all transfer/deposits in the ATM Savings account maintained in Fund 114 with a debit to Cash in Bank – LCCA (Payroll Account/ATM). For transfers/ deposits from Fund 101 and 164, corresponding account to be credited shall be Trust Liabilities; and



c)	Record/recognize subsequent transfer of payment to the individual personnel thru ATM by crediting Cash in Bank – LCCA (Payroll Account/ATM) for total withdrawals reflected in the passbook.





Delayed recording of School Fees and deficiency in review control



10)	School fees were not immediately recorded in the books in the period/month to which they should had been recorded and Report of Assessment was not reviewed by the Assessment Unit before this is recorded in the books, thus there is a risk that Receivable and Income accounts may not be presented accurately in the FS, if not properly addressed.   



	1)	Section 2.1 of COA Circular Letter No. 2004- 002 dated September 30, 2004 provides: 



“2.0 GENERAL GUIDELINES AND PROCEDURES



2.1 The accrual method of accounting shall be used in recording income from tuition fees and it shall be recorded in the Regular Agency (RA) Book. Based on the final assessment of students upon enrollment, the Accounting Unit shall record the "Accounts Receivable" with the corresponding credit to income account "Tuition Fees". 

	2)	Under the accrual method, the recognition of School Fees and setting up of Accounts Receivables (Tuition Fees) is made once final assessments are made available after enrollment. Hence, it is imperative that Final Assessment Report is immediately submitted to the Accounting Unit as soon as enrollment process is completed to ensure that Income and Receivables account are accurately recognized in the books.



	3)	We conducted a review of the process affecting the recognition in the books of Income from Tuition Fees generated by the College which disclosed the following:



a)	The Head of the College Database Center prepares the Report of Assessment;



b)	The Report of Assessment is usually completed within a period of two weeks after the last day of enrollment for each semester;



c)	The Report of Assessment is usually generated by the College Database Center and does not pass the Assessment Unit for review. Reliance is usually placed on the Information Technology (IT) generated Report of Assessment; and



d)	On the basis of Report of Assessment, the total amount school fees under the Free Higher Education is immediately billed to CHED while the school fees for the Profession Education Certificate (PEC) and Graduate School Programs are immediately recorded based on the amount per Report of Assessment. 



	4)	Review of the School fees account revealed that the recording of Tuition Fees under the PEC Program and Graduate School Programs; and Tuition and Other School fees under the Free Higher Education for SY 2019-2020 and 1st Semester of SY 2020-2021 were not immediately recorded within the reasonable period to which they relate. Details are as shown in Appendix E. 



	5)	While the Accounting Unit records the School Fees and Receivables upon the submission of the Report of Assessment and the Billing Statement for CHED UniFAST for every semester by the Database Center/ IT Office, we noted that the Head of the College Database Center submits Report of Assessment and Billing Statement to the Accounting Unit only upon the latter’s request.  Further, the IT generated Report of Assessment is not reviewed by the Assessment Unit before this is submitted to the Accounting Unit. Accordingly, both the Assessment and Accounting Units rely on the IT Office for the generation of the report. 



	6)	Because of the delay in submission and absence of review of the Report of Assessment, and as illustrated in Appendix E, the recording of School Fees Tuition Fee-PEC- 1st Semester 2019-2020 was based on the Proposed Tuition Fee instead of the final Report of Assessment resulting in unrecorded School Fees for FY 2019 amounting to P9,540.00, and understatement of Accounts Receivable and Accumulated Surplus accounts of prior years.  These could have been avoided had the recording in the books been based on a duly reviewed Report of Assessment, and not on the Proposed Tuition Fee.  



	7)	Furthermore, verification of students’ assessment and payment records available in the Assessment/ Cashiering System maintained by the IT Office and the Report of Collections and Deposits (RCD), showed that collections made pertaining to the Tuition Fees illustrated in the following table were accounted as a reduction from Accounts Receivable prior to its recognition in the books. Details as follows:

	8)	The lack of clear distinction as to duties and responsibilities between the offices involved resulted in the deficiencies noted and if not properly addressed, could affect the accuracy of the amount recorded in the books and presented in the FS.



Recommendation



	9)	We recommended and Management agreed to:



a)	Direct the Assessment Unit to coordinate with the Database Center for the generation of reports immediately upon completion of final assessments for each program every semester, to certify correctness, and to immediately submit the reports to the Accounting Unit;



b)	Direct the Head of the College Database to immediately submit billing statement for CHED UniFAST upon completion to the Accounting Unit;



c)	Direct the Accountant to immediately record School Fees upon receipt of necessary documents from the Assessment Unit and the Database Center, to make the necessary follow up request for these documents to avoid delay; and

d)	To make the necessary adjusting entries for the unrecorded Tuition Fees under PEC amounting to P9,540.00.



Incorrect accounting entry for salary and wages deductions



11)	The use of account Due to NGAs instead of Due to Government-Owned and Controlled Corporations (GOCCs) in recording loan deductions from salaries and wages of personnel due the DBP Loan is not in keeping with Chapter 3, Annex A-Volume III of COA Circular No. 2020-001.



	1)	Chapter 3, Annex A-Volume III of COA Circular No. 2020-001Prescribing Volume III-Revised Chart of Accounts (Updated 2019) to replace Volume III-The Revised Chart of Accounts (Updated 2015) of the GAM for NGAs provides:

Description

This account is credited to recognize the receipt of funds for delivery of goods/services as authorized by law, fund transfers from NGAs, other than the BIR, for implementation of specific programs or projects subject to liquidation and other inter-agency transactions.  This account is debited for delivery of goods/services, liquidation of funds received and settlement of liabilities, and/or adjustments.

Description

This account is credited to recognize the receipt of: a) funds for delivery of goods/services as authorized by law; b) fund transfers from the GOCCs for the implementation of specific programs or projects subject to liquidation; c) NG-managed fund; d) escrow accounts; e) collateral deposits for the account of GOCCs/Government Financial Institutions (GFIs); and f) other inter-agency transactions, except those pertaining to GSIS, PhilHealth and Pag-IBIG. This account is debited for delivery of goods/services, liquidation of funds received and settlement of liabilities, and/or adjustments.



	2)	Audit revealed that the accounting entry to recognize the amount deducted from the salaries and wages of personnel for loans availed with the DBP and its remittances/ adjustments to Due to Other NGAs (20201050) is not appropriate considering that this is a proper charge to Due to GOCCs (20201060). 



Recommendation 

	

	3)	We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Accounting Unit to use account Due to GOCCs (20201060) instead of Due to Other NGAs (20201050) in recording deductions from salaries and wages of personnel to pay for DBP Loan in accordance with Chapter 3, Annex A-Volume III of COA Circular No. 2020-001.  











COMPLIANCE AUDIT 



Reduction of the Receivable-Disallowances/Charges without NSSDC



12)	Various reductions were made from the Receivable-Disallowances/Charges account without the corresponding Notice of Settlement of Suspension, Disallowance/Charge (NSSDC). 



	1)	Paragraph 7.2.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009, entitled Prescribing the use of Rules and Regulations on Settlement of Accounts (RRSA) provides among others:



				“7.2.1 Responsibility of the Agency Accountant

The disallowance and charges that have become final and executory as contained in the Notice of Finality of Decision (NFD) are recorded in the books of accounts, and settlements thereof under the NSSDC are dropped therefrom;”

	2)	Review of the Receivable-Disallowances/Charges (10305010) showed that there were reductions from the account, on the Cost of Living Allowance (COLA) disallowances issued by the Auditor that were not supported with NSSDC.



	3)	The practice of effecting deductions or credits from the account without the corresponding NSSDC is not in consonance with Paragraph 7.2.1.d of COA Circular No. 2009-006.



Recommendation 



	4)	We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Accountant to refrain from effecting deductions/credits from the Receivable-Disallowances/Charges without the corresponding NSSDC issued by the Auditor, in accordance with paragraph 7.2.1.d of COA Circular No. 2009-006, and prepare appropriate adjusting entry to correct the account.  



Unnecessary steps in the utilization of Petty Cash Fund (PCF) 



13)	The current procedure for PCF includes some unnecessary steps resulting to lengthy time frame and inefficient utilization of the fund consequently defeating its purpose. Also, some purchases included therein could have been included in the regular procurement of the Agency so that the PCF may be freed up and other emergency and petty expenses may be catered to. 



	1)	Section 38, Chapter 6, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs provides the following procedures for disbursements through Petty Cash:

Files the original PCV together with the SDs. 



	2)	Review of the two replenishments made by the PCFC under Check Nos. 10918646 and 10918704 dated March 30, 2020 and July 9, 2020, respectively showed the timeline from request of items availability to purchase request preparation to canvass and eventual buying of the items. Review disclosed that 57 per cent of the total PCVs covered took more than one month to process (request to buying) which is more or less the full cycle of procurement. Shown below is the summary of processing time of the PCVs, and the detailed analysis of the process is shown in Appendix F:

	3)	A review of the petty cash flow was made to identify the reason/s for the lengthy processing.  It was noted that there are some processes/ procedure that may be dispensed with, or unnecessary. This includes the following: 



a)	The need to ask for the assistance of the Supply Office Staff when requested items not available on stock, are for procurement through PS. 



This is not a necessary procedure.  Before the preparation of the Purchase Request (PR), the RIS already indicated that such items are not available on hand. The need to procure items from the PS is availed for regular procurement and not when the items requested are for PCF (petty and immediately needed).

 

b)	The need for the PR to pass thru the budget office for the availability of funds. 



In the establishment of the PCF, the allocated amount was already with corresponding budget as evidenced by the Obligation Request Status (ORS) drawn together with the Disbursement Vouchers (DVs) for the granting of petty cash. Also, in the replenishment, a separate ORS was also drawn for the recording of the expenses incurred out from the PCF. Hence, during the request for the purchase using PCF, this need not pass thru the Budget Office. 



c)	The College President approves the PCV. 



Per procedure laid for the PCF, it is the immediate supervisor who will approve of the PCV and not necessarily the Agency Head unless the latter is the Immediate Supervisor. 



d)	The need for the accomplishment of canvass form by the canvassers. 



In the currently observed procedure, before the cash is released to the end-user, the canvass forms are necessary which is accomplished by the official canvasser of the Agency. If the end-user will be the one who will purchase the item after the cash is released, it might be time efficient if the latter will conduct the canvass as well. After compliance with necessary documents supporting the request (RIS, PR and accomplished PCV) and the fund is released, then end-user will do the canvass as well the purchase. Upon liquidation, that could be the time that the Petty Cash Custodian requires the canvass form on top of the other necessary SDs. 



	4)	Review of the replenishments also showed that some items were recurring, in which case, this might as well be procured thru the regular procurement and kept in stock considering that the agency is allowed to maintain three-month supply of stock. Non-inclusion of these items will make the PCF available for other contingencies. 



Recommendation



	5)	We recommended and Management agreed to review: 



a)	The current flow for PCF and remove if not minimize the procedures that are not necessary, for a faster and efficient utilization of the fund; and 



b)	The current purchases made thru petty cash fund and consider including recurring items in the regular procurement that could kept in stock. 



Non-utilization of Report of Cash Disbursement (RCDisb) in the Liquidation of Cash Advances



14)	Liquidations of cash advances made by the SDO were not supported with a RCDisb, contrary to Section 17, Chapter 6, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs.  



	1)	Section 17, Chapter 6 on Disbursement of the GAM for NGAs Volume I provides the following: 



“Section 17. Accounting Books, Records, Forms and Reports to be Prepared and Maintained. The Disbursing Officer shall maintain the Cash Disbursements Record (CDRec) (Appendix 40) to monitor the cash advances/payroll, current operating expenses, and special purpose/time-bound undertakings and prepare the RCDisb (Appendix 41) to report its utilization.” 



	2)	Also, Appendix 41 requires the Disbursing Officer to prepare the RCDisb for liquidation of his/her cash advances for payment of salaries, wages, honoraria, allowances, and other personnel benefits, current operating expenses, and special purpose/time-bound undertakings.



	3)	Review of the liquidations made by a SDO disclosed that instead of using the RCDisb in his liquidation report, a summary of expenses was attached together with his CDRec. The mentioned summary showed the date, particulars, OR (supporting the payment), amount disbursed and running balance. Though in essence, the contents of the summary are essentially the same of that the RCDisb, it is not the required form as provided for by the abovementioned provision of GAM. 



Recommendation 



	4)	We recommended and Management agreed to direct the SDO to utilize the RCDisb in the preparation and submission of his liquidations in accordance with Section 17, Chapter 6, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs. 



Non-utilization of the prescribed format of CIP Ledger Cards



15)	Subsidiary Ledgers (SLs) maintained for each infrastructure project in the CIP account did not conform to the format prescribed in Appendix 77, Volume II of the GAM for NGAs. 



	1)	Appendix 77, Volume II of the GAM for NGAs states that:



“A. The Construction in Progress Ledger Card (CIPLC) shall be kept in the Accounting Division/Unit for each project. The Accounting Staff in charge in maintaining the CIPLC shall record promptly the construction costs and other information about the asset constructed. It shall be maintained per fund cluster.



A)	At the end of each month, the subsidiary ledger (SL) balance shall be reconciled with the corresponding controlling account.”



	2)	Review of the SLs maintained for each project in the CIP account disclosed that prescribed format of CIPLC was not utilized, thus other relevant details and information included in the form were not provided in the current SL maintained such as contract period and cost breakdown (see attached Appendix 77, prescribed CIPLC format). In addition, the Fund Cluster of some projects were not indicated in the SL. 



	3)	The individual status, balances to date, and other relevant information of these Infrastructure Projects are verified, determined and properly monitored through the maintenance of CIPLC. Thus, it is necessary to maintain CIP ledgers in proper form as prescribed so as to include all the necessary details and information of the projects.







Recommendation 



	4)	We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Accountant to update current SLs maintained in conformity to format of CIPLC for each project per fund cluster in consonance prescribed in Appendix 77, Volume II of the GAM for NGAs. 



Improper Utilization/Non-utilization of Certification of Expenses Not Requiring Receipts



16)	Expenses incurred above P300.00 which do not require ORs were supported by Certification of Expenses Not Requiring Receipts contrary to COA Circular No. 2017-001 dated June 19, 2017; whereas expenses incurred below P300.00 were supported by Reimbursement Expenses Receipts (RERs) instead of the prescribed certification for such expenses.



	1)	COA Circular No. 2017-001 on Reimbursement of expenses not requiring OR dated   June 19, 2017 provides:

“In view of the reduced purchasing power of the peso, expenses incurred by government officials and employees in the discharge of their official functions amounting to P300.00 or less need not be supported by ORs, except for the following:



a)	Payment of fares in public utility vehicles issuing receipts such as bus, train, vessel/ship; and



b)	Purchases in business establishments issuing receipts.



The official/employee concerned shall be required to submit a certification for expenses P300.00 or less as supporting document (Annex “A”).”



	2)	Moreover, Item b, Section 3.3.1 of COA Circular No. 2004-006 dated September 5, 2004 on Guidelines and Principles on the Acceptability of the Evidence of Receipt of Payment for Disbursements states that:



“3.3.1. A paper-based evidence of receipt of payment may take any of the following forms: 



b. Reimbursement Expense Receipt (RER) — The RER shall be acceptable for disbursements where the payee is not a business entity required by the BIR to issue ORs and the money is advanced by the official concerned and the expense is authorized to be reimbursed by the government agency concerned.”

	

	3)	Review of the liquidations of a SDO, showed that a Certification of Expenses Not Requiring Receipts was used for purchases which includes amounts above P300.00 amounting to P3,352.00. Details are as follows:

	5)	The use of the aforementioned certification applies only to expenses incurred amounting to P300.00 or less which do not require ORs. For expenses above P300.00 and where the payee is not a business entity required to issue ORs, RER shall be used.



Recommendation 



	6)	We recommended and Management agreed to direct the SDOs to:



a)	Observe proper use of the Certification of Expenses Not Requiring Receipts in accordance with COA Circular No. 2017-001; and



b)	Use RER for authorized expenses above P300.00 where the payee is not a business entity required to issue ORs. 



Inconsistent application of internal control measure in monitoring attendance 



17)	Attachment of logbook entries for the time of arrival and departure of the teaching and non-teaching personnel as an internal control measure to support their Daily Time Record (DTR) in lieu of the utilization of biometric machine was not consistently observed in various salary payments made. 



	1)	Section 123, Chapter 4 of PD No. 1445 provides that: 



“Internal Control is the plan of organization and all the coordinate methods and measures adopted within an organization or agency to safeguard its assets, check the accuracy and reliability of its accounting data, and encourage adherence to prescribed managerial policies.” 



	2)	As a mitigating measure to prevent the spread of COVID-19, one of the observed policies in ZSCMST, as allowed by the Civil Service Commission (CSC), is the halting of the utilization of the various biometrics installed for the teaching and non-teaching personnel of ZSCMST.



	3)	Audit of their salary payments showed that one of the compensating controls in place to ensure that the data reflected in the hand written DTRs of their personnel are accurate was the attachment of the logbooks for their time in and time out in the morning and afternoon arrival and departure which were used to countercheck data in the DTR. 



	4)	However, it was noted that this control was not consistently observed in payroll payments made for the months of November and December 2020 where some payments have complete documentation while the others lack thereof:

Payment for legal services despite absence of accomplishment 



18)	The engagement by the College of four staff/personnel of the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) and the payment of their honoraria at a fixed monthly rate of P20,000.00 notwithstanding the absence of accomplishment is excessive vis-a-vis the nature of legal services they rendered to the College, and not in consonance with COA Circular No. 2012-003 and Section 1(1) of PD No. 478.  



	1)	COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012 prescribes the Updated Guidelines for the Prevention and Disallowance of Irregular, Unnecessary, Excessive, Extravagant and Unconscionable Expenditures. Paragraph 5.1 defines “excessive expenditures’ as unreasonable expenses or expenses incurred at an immoderate quantity and exorbitant price.  It also includes expenses which exceed what is usual or proper, as well as expenses which are unreasonably high and beyond just measure or amount.  They also include expenses in excess of reasonable limits.



	2)	Section 1(1) of PD No. 478 dated June 4,1974 entitled Defining the Powers and Functions of the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) provides among others:



“i. Call on any department, bureau, offices, agency or instrumentality of the Government for such service, assistance and cooperation as may be necessary in fulfilling its functions and responsibilities and for this purpose enlist the services of any government official or employee in the pursuit of his tasks.

		

Departments bureaus, agencies, offices, instrumentalities and corporations to whom the Office of the Solicitor General renders legal services are authorized to disburse funds from their sundry operating and other funds for the latter Office. For this purpose, the Solicitor General and his staff are specifically authorized to receive allowances as may be provided by the Government offices, instrumentalities and corporations concerned, in addition to their regular compensation.”



	3)	 Moreover, Section 8 of Republic Act (RA) No. 9417 states:



	“Section 8. Other Benefits- Consistent with the provisions of Executive Order (EO) No. 292, otherwise known as the Revised Administrative Code of 1987, the legal staff of the OSG are allowed to receive honoraria and allowances from client departments, agencies and instrumentalities of the Government.”



	4)	On January 24, 2020, the OSG entered into a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with ZSCMST to provide legal services and advice to ZSCMST and its officials, and represent them in litigations. The ZSCMST in accordance with the law and throughout such period that said OSG services are rendered, binds itself to give monthly allowances from its sundry operating and other funds, the following: Solicitor General, P6,000.00; Assistant Solicitor General, P5,000.00; Senior State Solicitor, P5,000.00; and State Solicitor II, P5,000.00.  Said honoraria shall be directly credited to the bank account of the OSG subject to applicable taxes.

	5)	During the year, the OSG was paid the net amount of P220,800.00 as honorarium for legal services of four OSG personnel at monthly rate of P20,000.00, or a total of P240,000.00.



	6)	A summary of accomplishments made by the OSG personnel for CY 2020 is presented in Appendix G. 



	7)	As shown in Appendix G, the actual services rendered by the OSG based on their accomplishments report was only for the months of February, March, May, September, October and November, or a total of six months. In other words, the personnel of the OSG were paid honoraria equivalent to six months notwithstanding the fact that no legal services were rendered by them. Further scrutiny of the nature of their accomplishment showed that the services of the four OSG personnel were more of an administrative function such as review of the MOA with other government entities. Considering also the nature and volume of services they rendered to the College, the engagement and payment of honorarium to four OSG personnel could be considered excessive.  



	8)	As defined under DBM BC No. 2007-1 dated April 12, 2007, honorarium is a form of compensation given as a token of appreciation or reward for gratuitous services on account of one’s broad and superior knowledge or expertise. Even if the services they rendered fall under the term legal services, payment thereof should be based on actual services rendered but not in the form of a monthly allowance. In the absence of actual legal services rendered, payment of honorarium may not be appropriate and proper.  



	9)	Thus, had payment been limited to the actual services rendered instead of the fixed monthly payment, the agency could have reduced its expenditure by P120,000.00 since they are entitled only of an honorarium of P120,000.00 for the six-month period for the services rendered.



Recommendation 



	10)	We recommended and Management agreed to consider reviewing its present payment scheme and reassessing the necessity of maintaining the services of four OSG lawyers taking into consideration the nature and volume of actual legal services/cases being handled, if services of the OSG could not be avoided. 



COMPLIANCE WITH GENDER AND DEVELOPMENT (GAD)



19)	The Sex-Disaggregated Data (SDD) maintained by ZSCMST is not in conformity with Section 36(c) of RA No. 9710 and Section 37.A.1.a of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of the same Act.  Further, the submitted GAD Accomplishment Report (AR) is not in accordance with Section 1 of the Memorandum Circular (MC) No. 2021-01 of the Philippine Commission on Women (PCW). 



	1)	Section 36 (c) of RA No. 9710, or the Magna Carta for Women (MCW) provides that:



“All departments, including their attached agencies, offices, bureaus, state universities and colleges, government-owned and –controlled corporations, local government units, and other government instrumentalities shall develop and maintain a GAD database containing gender statistics and sex-disaggregated data that have been systematically gathered, regularly updated, and subjected to gender analysis for planning, programming, and policy formulation.”



	2)	Moreover, Section 37 A.1.a of the IRR of the same RA provides that:



“Following the conduct of a gender audit, gender analysis, and/or review of sex-disaggregated data, each agency or LGU shall develop its GAD Plans, Programs, and Budget in response to the gender gaps or issues faced by their women and men employees, as well as their clients and constituencies. Along with the Act and these Rules and Regulations, the Philippine Plan for Gender-Responsive Development (PPGD), the Beijing Platform for Action (BPfA), and the CEDAW, among others, shall serve as key documents to guide the identification of gender issues and the formulation of GAD Plans, Programs and Budget.”



	3)	Additionally, Section 3.2 of PCW MC No. 2011-01 defines Gender Analysis as referring:



“… to a framework to compare the relative advantages and disadvantages faced by women and men in various spheres of life, including the family, workplace, school, community and political system. It also takes into account how class, age, race, ethnicity, culture, social and other factors interact with gender to produce discriminatory results;”



	4)	Section 1 of PCW MC No. 2021-01 on the Submission of FY 2020 GAD AR provides for the timeline of the submission of GAD AR to various oversight bodies and eventual submission to the Gender Mainstreaming Monitoring System (GMMS). 



	5)	Query made with GAD Office of ZSCMST disclosed that they have a database which includes the gender statistics and SDD of their employees, both men and women which shows the breakdown of the number of male and female teaching and non-teaching staff of ZSCMST. These data were used together with gender analysis in identifying gender issues of ZSCMST, while other issues were identified through observed concerns and issues deemed as immediate necessities of the College. 



	6)	The above-mentioned provisions in the MCW and its IRR emphasize the importance of SDD in the identification of gender issues and the formulation of GAD Plans, Programs and Budget. As such, the College’s SDD should not just be a simple statistic of males and females but must include data regarding the following, among others:



a)	Families and Households;



b)	Employment and Livelihood;



c)	Education; and



d)	Health



	7)	These data in the agency’s SDD will help come up with pertinent gender issues necessary in the formulation of responsive GAD Plans, Programs and Budget, and ultimately, in addressing discrimination and inequality in the economic, political, civil, social and cultural life of women and men.  Though some identified issues were formulated through observation, enhancing the SDD of ZSCMST will address gender specific issues that are not readily identified through observation. 



	8)	For CY 2020 there were various GAD related activities that were made and participated in by ZSCMST such as initiation of “kick-off” activity in celebration of International Women’s Month, attendance to various Region-based GAD meetings, co-organizing a Stress Debriefing Activity, participation in a campaign to end Violence Against Women and Children and other GAD related events.



	9)	In the preparation of GAD AR, the Head of the GAD Office listed all accomplishments for CY 2020 with attached documentation (pictures of the activities). The Head also submitted the GAD AR thru the GMMS portal. However, it was not endorsed by the PCW because it lacked details, and that only few of the planned activities were implemented. 



	10)	It was provided in their GAD Plan and Budget that the activities planned to be undertaken would cost P11.700 million, or 5.39 per cent of the 2020 General Appropriation of P217.202 million. However, review of the unendorsed GAD AR showed that the activities undertaken were not provided with costing, hence the 5 percent cost attribution could not be assessed. 



	11)	Since the standard format was not followed, actual expenditures incurred by the Agency in relation to the accomplishments and deviations from the identified results, activities and targets in their GAD Plan and Budget (GPB), as well as reasons for the deviations were not shown. Hence, the reported accomplishments could not be validated against the transactions of the Agency though there were activities and accomplishment presented in their narrative format of GAD AR. 



	12)	The audit query also disclosed that personnel assigned in GAD Office have limited knowledge and have attended seminars and orientations dealing with concepts only, not specifically on the preparation and development of GPB and AR which may be one of the factors for the noted deficiencies. 



Recommendation 



	13)	We recommended and Management agreed to direct the GAD Focal Point System:



a)	Collect SDD regarding Families and Households, Employment and Livelihood, Education and Health thru sending out of questionnaires to its employees and students via pen and paper questionnaires, or through online surveys; 



b)	Collate the above-mentioned SDD, regularly update and maintain it at the College’s GAD database and use them in analyzing and identifying gender issues to be used in the formulation of GAD Plans, Programs and Budget;



c)	Prepare the GAD AR in accordance with the provisions of PCW to ensure that this will be endorsed when submitted thru the GMMS portal; and



d)	Attend in-depth GAD related trainings as there are adequate trainings provided by PCW and other accredited training centers, and there is budget for this purpose, especially in consideration of the assumption of the new GAD Head. 

 







 COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE TAX LAWS AND REGULATIONS



20)	Taxes withheld which are due for remittance amounting to P258,124.17 remained unremitted at year-end contrary to Section 5 of Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 11-2018.



	1)	Section 5 of BIR RR No. 11-2018 dated January 31, 2018 provides that:



	“Considering that taxes withheld by the withholding agents are held in trust for the government and its availability is an imperious necessity to ensure sufficient cash inflow to the National Treasury, withholding agents shall file BIR Monthly Remittance Form (BIR Form No. 0619E and/or 0619F) every tenth (10th) day of the following month when the withholding is made, regardless of the amount withheld. For withholding agents using Electronic Filing and Payment System (EFPS) facility, the due date is on the fifteenth (15th) day of the following month. Withholding agents with zero remittance are still required to use and file the same form. xxx”

	

	2)	Moreover, BIR Form No. 1601-C Monthly Remittance Return of Income Taxes Withheld on Compensation Guidelines and Instructions states that:



“The return shall be filed and tax paid on or before the tenth (10th) day of the month following the month in which withholding was made except for taxes withheld for December which shall be filed/paid on or before January 15 of the succeeding year. Provided, however, with respect to non-large and large taxpayers who availed of the EFPS the deadline for electronically filing the return and paying the taxes due thereon via EFPS shall be five (5) days later than the deadline set above.”



	3)	During the year, the agency had the following deductions for taxes withheld from employees’ compensation, suppliers and contractors which were remitted/refunded to the BIR and employees, for over deduction of taxes withheld as shown below:

	7)	We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Accounting Unit to determine the composition of the prior months unaccounted balance of P258,124.17, remit the same to the BIR, and henceforth to observe timely remittance of BIR withholding taxes in adherence to Section 5 of RR No. 11-2018.



COMPLIANCE WITH RA NO. 8291 re: DEDUCTION OF GSIS PREMIUMS AND REMITTANCE THEREOF



21)	Deductions from employees’ monthly compensation payable to GSIS of P269,669.43 remained unremitted as of year-end, contrary to Section 14.1 of RA No. 8291.



	1)	Section 14.1 of RA No. 8291, otherwise known as the GSIS Act of 1997 provides that:



	“14.1 Each government agency shall remit directly to the GSIS the employees’ and government agency’s contributions within the first Ten (10) days of the calendar month following the month to which the contributions apply. The remittance by the government agency of the contributions to the GSIS shall take priority over and above the payment of any and all obligations, except salaries and wages of its employees.”

COMPLIANCE WITH HDMF CIRCULAR NO. 275



22)	Prior period contributions and loan amortizations deducted from employees’ monthly compensation totaling P344,803.79 remained unremitted as of year-end contrary to Section E of HDMF Circular No. 275 dated January 22, 2010.



	1)	Paragraph E of HDMF Circular No. 275, entitled Implementing Guidelines on Employer Registration, Contribution, and Remittance under RA No. 9679 provides among others:
