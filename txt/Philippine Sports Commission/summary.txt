 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 

 

A. Introduction 
 

The Philippine Sports Commission (PSC) was created by virtue of Republic Act 

(RA) No. 6847 dated January 24, 1990 to serve as the sole policy-making and 

coordinating body of all amateur sports development programs and institutions in the 

Philippines. PSC has the same status as that of a governmental regulatory national 

agency attached to the Office of the President. It also exercises corporate powers. 

 

The objectives of PSC are to: 

 

a. provide leadership, formulate the policies and set the priorities and direction 
of all national amateur sports promotion and development, particularly 

giving emphasis on grassroots participation; 

 

b. encourage wide participation of all sectors, government and private, in 
amateur sports promotion and development; and 

 

c. supplement government appropriations for sports promotion and 
development. 

 

Chairman William I. Ramirez and four Commissioners lead the operations of 

PSC, all of whom are appointed by the President. The Executive Director, appointed 

or designated as such by the Chairman, directs and supervises the day-to-day 

transactions of the agency and has supervision and control over the Bureau on 

Administrative, Financial and Management Services (AFMS) and the Bureau on 

Coordinating Secretariat and Support Services (COSECSS), both headed by a Deputy 

Executive Director (DED). As of December 31, 2020, the manpower complement 

totaled 592, of which 228 were on permanent status, 316 were under Contract of 

Service (COS), and 48 under consultancy services.   

 

The offices of PSC are located in Rizal Memorial Sports Complex (RMSC) in 

Malate, Manila, PhilSports Complex in Pasig City, Baguio City and Cebu City. Other 

venues are the Shooting Range in Muntinlupa, Fort Bonifacio, Amoranto Velodrome,

Office (PCSO) amounting to ₱1,816,527.03, which formed part of the National Sports 

Development Fund (NSDF) authorized under RA No. 6847. 

 

 

D. Scope of Audit  
 

The audit covered the review of accounts and operations of PSC for the period 

January 1 to December 31, 2020. The audit was conducted to: a) ascertain the level of 

assurance that may be placed on the Management’s assertion on the financial 

statements; b) determine the propriety of transactions as well as extent of compliance 

on the applicable laws, rules and regulations; c) recommend agency improvement 

opportunities; and d) determine the extent of implementation of prior year’s 

recommendations. Moreover, the audit was conducted in accordance with the 

International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAIs). 

 

 

E. Independent Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements 
 

The Auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the 

PSC’s financial statements for CY 2020 due to the following observations: 

 

1. The account Cash in Bank-Local Currency, Current Account (LCCA) balance of 
₱749,782,640.24 was understated by ₱2,557,147.82 due to (a) ₱1,340,527.16 

unadjusted net of book reconciling items from CYs 2014 to 2020, and (b) 

₱1,216,620.66 stale checks that were not cancelled and reverted back to the cash 

account and correspondingly, the appropriate liability account was not recognized 

affecting the fair presentation of the accounts Cash in Bank–LCCA and the 

Accounts Payable. 

 

2. Errors in recording the liquidations of financial assistance (FA) resulted in the 
understatement of the account Due from NGOs/CSOs by ₱3,597,763.53, and 

crediting ₱1,198,528.52 to unrelated FA as of December 31, 2020. Moreover, a 

huge amount aggregating ₱1,669,996,955.59 or 88.2 percent of the account’s 

balance of ₱1,892,613,107.30 has long been outstanding, contrary to PSC Board 



 

 

iv 

Resolution No. 316-2010 and Section 5.1 of COA Circular No. 2007-001, casting 

doubt on the reliability of the account. 

 

3. Negative balances appearing in the SL of the account Other Receivables totaling 
₱13,996,193.24 is inconsistent with Section 112 of PD No. 1445, and rendered the 

account, with a balance of ₱116,769,548.12 as at December 31, 2020, unreliable.  

 

4. The misclassification of accounts, contrary to COA Circular No. 2020-001 
prescribing the updated Revised Chart of Accounts (RCA), overstated the 

₱274,588,007.75 year-end balance of Accounts Payable by ₱107,601,695.15. 

 

5. The reported depreciation expenses and the corresponding accumulated 
depreciation were both understated by ₱1,090,057.92 while the reported 

amortization expenses and the corresponding accumulated amortization were both 

understated by ₱185,250.00, due to the incorrect computation by the Accounting 

Division. 

 

 

F. Significant Observations and Recommendations 
 

The following are the other significant audit observations and corresponding 

recommendations, which were discussed with Management officials concerned 

through the issuance of Audit Observation Memoranda and discussed during the exit 

conference held on June 3, 2021, details of which are further discussed in the report. 

Management views and comments were incorporated in the report, where appropriate. 

 

1. The year-end balance of the account Due from NGAs totaling ₱242,338,574.99 is 
unreliable due to a difference of ₱208,315,146.25 between the agency’s Due from 

NGAs (PS-DBM) of ₱241,026,422.85 and the PS-DBM’s confirmation amount of 

₱32,711,276.60. Moreover, a total of ₱452,152.14 from prior years was not 

supported with SL, precluding review of its validity. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the: 

 

a. Acting Chief Accountant and the Supply Officer to coordinate with the PS-
DBM for the reconciliation of the two records, and make the necessary 

adjusting entries; and 

 

b. Acting Chief Accountant to: 
 

i. Demand from the DepEd - Region XI the submission of the liquidation 
reports to settle the fund transfer of ₱560,000.00; and 

 

ii. exert effort in locating and identifying the composition of the unsupported 
prior year amount of ₱452,152.14 to be able to demand settlement. 

 



 

 

v 

2. The existence, completeness and accuracy of the carrying amount of Inventory 
accounts of ₱166,957,092.30 is doubtful due to a discrepancy between the General 

Ledger (GL) and the Report on the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) of 

₱132,058,986.51.  Likewise, reconciliation could not be done since the Supplies 

Ledger Cards (SLCs) are not updated. 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the concerned staff to 

update the SLCs and reconcile said records with the RPCI prepared by the Inventory 

Committee. 

3. The reported PPE accounts balances with a total cost of ₱4,336,530,531.36 as at 
December 31, 2020 are unreliable due to discrepancies between the GL and the 

Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) totaling 

₱833,065,288.53. 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 

a. require the Acting Chief Accountant and the Heads of Property and Supply 
Office (PSO) and Engineering and Maintenance Unit (EMU) to expedite the 

reconciliation of their records; and 

 

b. instruct the Head, PSO to assign a dedicated staff to update the PCs. 
 

4. The weak internal control payroll administration system resulted in padded athletes’ 
and coaches’ allowances totaling ₱3,026,700.00 that were credited to the bank 

accounts of three Contract of Service (COS) employees, and allowances involving 

the amount of ₱2,178,186.67 were still given to the athletes and coaches despite 

several deficiencies, resulting in loss of government funds. 

We recommended and the PSC Board of Commissioners agreed to expedite the 

implementation of the recommendations in the investigation report of the Fact-

Finding Committee, particularly the recovery of the illegally disbursed fund 

through padded allowances, and the imposition of administrative penalties against 

those persons who failed to exercise due diligence. 

Likewise, we recommended and Management agreed to require the: 

a. Head, NSAAO to submit the related Board Resolutions to support the 
allowances given to the athletes and coaches despite being dropped or excluded 

in the Master List, and the validated list of bank accounts of all athletes and 

coaches; 

 

b. Acting Chief Accountant to recover the excessive allowances (i.e., absences 
that were not deducted, double/overpayment) from the athletes and coaches by 

issuing demand letter and/or implementing allowance deduction; and 

 



 

 

vi 

c. Head, ACD to submit the supporting attendance sheet of the disbursed 
₱97,000.00. 

 

5. A total of ₱1,678,404,073.02 remained unliquidated beyond the prescribed period 
to report the utilization of funds by several athletes, coaches and organizations out 

of the ₱7,312,987,378.07 funds allotted for the preparation, hosting, training and 

participation for the 2019 Southeast Asian (SEA) Games. This condition ran 

counter to the existing COA rules and the PSC Board Resolution, and which 

precluded the timely and holistic audit, to report on the accountability of public 

funds relative to the operations of the biennial regional multi-sport event. 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the: 

a. Accounting Division and Property and Supply Office to continue to reconcile 
their records with the PS-DBM; and 

 

b. Accountable persons and organizations to immediately submit the liquidation 
report together with the supporting documents for each outstanding FA and/or 

refund the balance of the transferred fund; and 

Likewise, we recommended and the PSC Board of Commissioners agreed to 

require the PHISGOC to submit the: 

a. final fund utilization report covering all the FA and expenditures pertaining to 
the SEA Games events; 

 

b. audited financial reports for CY 2020 transactions pertaining to PSC funds, and 
subsequent periods; 

 

c. collection reports disclosing all the revenues/receipts derived from all the SEA 
Games events including all donations/sponsorships from private institutions, 

duly supported by Official Receipts and contracts; and 

 

d. bank statements for funds received from PSC, country-participants/delegations 
and others. 

 

 

G. Status of Implementation of Prior Year’s Audit Recommendations 
 

Of the 70 audit recommendations embodied in the CY 2019 Annual Audit 

Report (AAR), 57 recommendations were implemented while 13 recommendations 

were not implemented, details of which are discussed in Part III of this report.
