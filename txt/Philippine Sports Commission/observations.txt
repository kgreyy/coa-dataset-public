OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

 

A. Financial and Compliance Audit 
 

Unreliable cash in bank account balances  

 

1. The account Cash in Bank-Local Currency, Current Account (LCCA) balance 
of ₱749,782,640.24 was understated by ₱2,557,147.82 due to (a) ₱1,340,527.16 

unadjusted net of book reconciling items from CYs 2014 to 2020, and (b) 

₱1,216,620.66 stale checks that were not cancelled and reverted back to the 

cash account and correspondingly, the appropriate liability account was not 

recognized affecting the fair presentation of the accounts Cash in Bank–LCCA 

and the Accounts Payable. 

 

Section 7, Chapter 19, Volume I of the GAM state that financial statements 

shall present fairly the financial position of an entity. Fair presentation requires the 

faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in 

accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria of assets, liabilities, 

revenue, and expenses set out in International Public Sector Accounting Standards 

(IPSAS). 

 

a) Book reconciling items not recorded 
 

Section 6, Chapter 21, Volume I of the GAM requires the Chief 

Accountant/Designated Staff to prepare a Journal Entry Voucher (JEV) to recognize 

all reconciling items that require adjustment and correction in the books of accounts.  

 

Verification of the Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRSs) revealed 

unadjusted net   reconciling items of ₱1,340,527.16 from CYs 2014 to 2020 

affecting four bank accounts, which remain unrecognized in the books of PSC as of 

December 31, 2020, as summarized below: 

 

Particulars Total (₱) 

Credit memos (April 2014 to March 2017) 3,619,977.39 

Unrecorded receipts (May 2017 to December 2020) 7,517,355.16 

Intraoffice (IOATS-intra bank transfer) (11/17/2017) 3,000.00 

Cash deposit (no date) 2,500.00 

Unrecorded collections (2015 to 2018) 3,134,787.28 

     Understatement 14,277,619.83 

Debit memos (June 2014 to March 2017)   (2,990,530.44) 

Unrecorded disbursements (June 2017 to November 2020) (2,109,841.37) 

Unrecorded transfer to other account   (5,500,000.00) 

Letter of Credits (LCs) in November 2016 to August 2017       (65,754.77) 

Intra Office GL Deduction        (34,756.12) 

Debit account against GL intra (2018)          (3,630.47) 



40 

Particulars Total (₱) 

Over the counter (OTC) bill payment (LCs in 2019 to 2020) (2,229,663.00) 

Bank/service charges          (2,916.50) 

     Overstatement (12,937,092.67) 

Net understatement     1,340,527.16  

 

Inquiry disclosed that there were already adjustments that recorded 

reconciling items, except for the above transactions due to the absence of documents 

from the banks to support said debit and credit memos. Several official 

communications were sent to the banks requesting for the submission of the 

supporting documents; however, the agency was informed that these transactions 

originated from different branches. Thus, it was advised to directly send the requests 

to the originating bank branches. 

 

Similarly, remaining documents pertaining to the Letter of Credits from 

2016 to 2017 were not yet submitted by the Procurement Office to the Accounting 

Division. While the Legal Affairs Office is currently locating the whereabouts of the 

relevant documents for the LCs from 2019 to 2020. 

 

b) Non-cancellation of stale checks 
 

Section 44, Chapter 6, Volume I of the GAM provides that checks may be 

cancelled when they become stale, voided or spoiled. The depository bank considers 

a check stale, if it has been outstanding for over six months from date of issue or as 

prescribed. 

 

Review of the BRS for LBP Account No. 1772103243 revealed that stale 

checks totaling ₱1,216,620.66, as summarized below, were still included as 

outstanding checks and were not cancelled and/or restored to the Cash in Bank-

LCCA account:

Total     1,216,620.66  

 

The Accounting personnel commented that some of the payees are already 

based in other countries; hence, they must have forgotten to encash their claimed 

checks. Inquiry with the Cashier also claimed that they are having difficulty 

communicating with the payees due to unavailability of contact numbers. 

 

The non-adjustment of the book reconciling items of ₱1,340,527.16 and 

the non-restoration to the cash account of stale checks worth ₱1,216,620.66 

understated the account Cash in Bank–LCCA by ₱2,557,147.82 and the Accounts 

Payable by ₱1,216,620.66, affecting the fair presentation of the accounts Cash in 

Bank-LCCA and the Accounts Payable. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accounting Division 

to: 

 

a. request from the respective bank branches the pertinent documents to 
support the credit and debit memos; 

 

b. prepare and provide the Procurement Office and Legal Affairs Office a 
summary/list of the unrecorded LCs to facilitate their tracing of the 

relevant documents; hence, be able to submit to the Accounting Division 

and 

 

c.       prepare the necessary adjusting journal entries to record the fully 
supported reconciling items, and restore to the cash account and payables 

the stale checks. 

 

 

Unreliable Due from National Government Agencies (NGAs) account 

 

2. The year-end balance of the account Due from NGAs totaling ₱242,338,574.99 
is unreliable due to a difference of ₱208,315,146.25 between the agency’s Due 

from NGAs (PS-DBM) of ₱241,026,422.85 and the PS-DBM’s confirmation 

amount of ₱32,711,276.60. Moreover, a total of ₱452,152.14 from prior years 

was not supported with SL, precluding review of its validity. 



42 

Section 6, Chapter 19, Volume I of the GAM enumerates the qualitative 

characteristics of financial reporting, where Section 6(e) states “Reliability - reliable 

information is free from material error and bias, and can be depended on by users to 

represent faithfully that which it purports to represent or could reasonably be 

expected to represent.” 

The account Due from NGAs totaled ₱242,338,574.99, as follows: 

 

Particulars Amount (₱) 

Due from PS DBM  241,026,422.85 

Department of Education (DepEd) 560,000.00 

AFP Finance Center 300,000.00 

Unsupported (prior year) 452,152.14 

Total 242,338,574.99 

 

a) Difference between agency’s Due from NGAs-PS-DBM and the PS-DBM’s 
confirmation amount 

 

Comparison of the Due from NGAs balance per accounting records with 

the confirmation reply from the PS-DBM showed a difference of ₱208,315,146.25, 

as shown below:

Less: Balance per PS-DBM   32,711,276.60  

Difference 208,315,146.25  

 

The discrepancy casts doubt on the reliability and accuracy of the account 

Due from NGAs as of report date. 

 

Management explained that there was a delay in the reconciliation due to 

the COVID-19 pandemic wherein skeletal workforce was being observed. Also, 

there were instances that some personnel were on quarantine. 

 

Meanwhile, the DepEd - Region XI responded on February 12, 2020 to the 

Audit Team’s demand letter on the liquidation of the transferred ₱560,000.00 under 

Check No. 411150 dated January 7, 2019. The DepEd - Region XI claimed that the 



43 

whole amount was fully utilized on May 14, 2019, however, the liquidation reports 

were not yet submitted to PSC Accounting Division. 

 

b) Unsupported balance of ₱452,152.14 
 

The General Ledger (GL) is the book of final entry containing the totals of 

special journals (journals designed to record transactions which are repetitive in 

nature) and individual entries that are directly posted in the account. On the other 

hand, the Subsidiary Ledger (SL) is the book of final entry containing the details or 

breakdown of the balance of the controlling account appearing in the GL. The totals 

of the SL balances shall be reconciled with their respective control account regularly 

or at the end of each month. 

 

Verification revealed that a total of ₱452,152.14 from prior years could not 

be accounted for due to the unavailability of SL, precluding review of its validity.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the: 

 

a. Acting Chief Accountant and the Supply Officer to coordinate with the 
PS-DBM for the reconciliation of the two records, and make the necessary 

adjusting entries; and 

 

b. Acting Chief Accountant to: 
 

i. Demand from the DepEd - Region XI the submission of the liquidation 
reports to settle the fund transfer of ₱560,000.00; and 

 

ii. exert effort in locating and identifying the composition of the 
unsupported prior year amount of ₱452,152.14 to be able to demand 

settlement. 

 

Management Comment: 

 

The Acting Chief Accountant explained, during the exit conference, that they are in 

constant coordination with both the Property and Supply Office and the Travel 

Office for the submission of pertinent documents showing delivery of procured 

items; hence, will be the basis for necessary adjustment in the books of accounts. 

Immediate coordination with the DepEd - Region XI to submit the liquidation 

report is also in process. 

  

 

Unreliable Due from Non-Government Organizations/Civil Society Organizations 

(NGOs/CSOs) account 

 

3. Errors in recording the liquidations of financial assistance (FA) resulted in the 
understatement of the account Due from NGOs/CSOs by ₱3,597,763.53, and 



44 

crediting ₱1,198,528.52 to unrelated FA as of December 31, 2020. Moreover, a 

huge amount aggregating ₱1,669,996,955.59 or 88.2 percent of the account’s 

balance of ₱1,892,613,107.30 has long been outstanding, contrary to PSC 

Board Resolution No. 316-2010 and Section 5.1 of COA Circular No. 2007-001, 

casting doubt on the reliability of the account. 

 

Financial reports should have reliable information that is free from material 

error and bias, and can be depended on by users to represent faithfully that which it 

purports to represent or could reasonably be expected to represent. (Section 6(e), 

Chapter 19, Volume I of the GAM) 

 

a) Errors in the recording of liquidations 
 

Verification disclosed that the Due from NGOs/CSOs account showed a 

balance of ₱1,892,613,107.30 as at December 31, 2020.  However, the subsidiary 

ledgers (SLs) of NGOs showed errors in the recording of liquidations/refunds of the 

FA understating the account by ₱3,597,763.53, and crediting a total of 

₱1,198,528.52 to unrelated FA, with details shown below:

It is worth mentioning that a total of ₱4,347,701.15 has been adjusted in 

March 2021. 

 

b) Huge and long outstanding balances 
 

PSC Board Resolution No. 316-2010 dated September 28, 2010 requires 

that FA shall be liquidated within 30 days after completion of the purpose for which 

it was given. This 30-day liquidation requirement is underpinned in the Affidavit of 

Undertaking being signed by the President/Secretary General of the recipient NGO. 

 

While Section 5.1 of COA Circular No. 2007-001 requires that NGOs shall 

submit the required financial reports to the government organization as agreed upon 

in a Memorandum of Agreement. 

 

Review of the account showed that of the balance of ₱1,892,613,107.30 as 

of December 31, 2020, a total of ₱1,669,996,955.59 or 88.2 per cent were already 

due for liquidation, as summarized below:

As gleaned from the preceding Table, a total of ₱1,513,764,754.72 was for 

the hosting of the 2019 SEA Games, but which displayed a significant decrease 

compared to the outstanding balance of ₱2,161,698,182.14 as of December 31, 

2019. 

 

The Accounting personnel in-charge explained that they are currently 

having difficulties in monitoring the FA and experiencing unavoidable delays in 



46 

processing the liquidation documents due to the skeletal workforce during the 

community quarantines. They have been exerting utmost efforts in making follow 

ups with the concerned NGOs for the submission of the required supporting 

documents. Likewise, they are coordinating with the Legal Affairs Office for 

appropriate legal action. 

 

To determine the existence and accuracy of the account, confirmation 

letters were sent out in March 2021.  Based on the replies, most of the outstanding 

balances were recognized by the NGOs as pending liquidation or for refund, and 

cited that they are still trying to complete the necessary documents despite the 

community quarantines and claimed that the documents are being kept by the 

athletes and coaches who are based abroad. 

 

The rest of the confirmation replies, however, cited the following negative 

responses:

22 2010; 2014;

24,887,972.62 Already liquidated 

 

We communicated said responses to the Accounting Division and they 

explained, with no further details provided, that the liquidation documents submitted 

by the National Sports Associations (NSAs) may still be subject for review. 

 

The Audit Team believed that the processing of the liquidation documents 

should have been prioritized since the FA were granted way back in CY 2010 to CY 

2019. Also, those NGOs with refundable amounts should have already directly 

deposited them to the bank account of the PSC; hence, could be used to support its 

other programs. 

 

The non-settlement by the NGOs of the FA within the deadline, in addition 

to the delay of the Accounting Division in the processing of liquidation reports, 

resulted in huge and long outstanding balances at year-end. Consequently, the PSC, 

as well as the Audit Team, could not readily ascertain whether FA were utilized for 

their intended purpose, in particular the SEA Games activities in CY 2019. 

 



47 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the: 

 

a. pertinent NGOs to: 
 

i. submit immediately the liquidation documents to the Accounting 
Division; and 

 

ii. refund the unutilized FA directly to the bank account of PSC or to the 
Cashier’s Office, furnishing the Accounting Division a copy of the 

deposit slip or Official Receipt thereof. 

 

b. Accounting Division to: 
 

i. immediately analyze the errors in the recording of the liquidations of 
FA and prepare the necessary journal entries to correct the 

misstatements; 

 

ii. closely monitor the status of FA, and immediately process the 
liquidation documents that were already in their possession;  

 

iii. investigate the difference between the balances per accounting and 
NGOs’ records; 

 

iv. evaluate the NGOs’ reasons/justifications for their non-liquidation, 
especially those outstanding for more than one year and those 

dormant accounts; 

 

v. examine other courses of action that maximize effort on the possible 
settlement of dormant accounts; and 

 

vi. if the remedies proved futile, request from COA for authority to 
write-off dormant accounts, strictly in accordance with COA Circular 

2016-005. 

 

 

Unreliable Other Receivables account 

 

4. Negative balances appearing in the SL of the account Other Receivables 
totaling ₱13,996,193.24 is inconsistent with Section 112 of PD No. 1445, and 

rendered the account, with a balance of ₱116,769,548.12 as at December 31, 

2020, unreliable. 

 

Section 112 of PD No. 1445 provides that each government agency shall 

record its financial transactions and operations in conformity with generally 

accepted accounting principles and in accordance with pertinent laws and 

regulations.  



48 

 

Relatedly, sound accounting practice dictates that the normal balance of 

asset and expense accounts should be debit, and the liabilities, equity and income 

accounts should be credit. 

 

Verification of the SL of the account Other Receivables as of December 

31, 2020 disclosed abnormal balances totaling ₱13,996,193.24. 

 

Interview with the Acting Chief Accountant revealed that said abnormal 

balances pertained to prior years’ transactions, but which records were not available 

for review since they could not locate where these were filed; hence, the necessary 

adjusting entries could not be made. The details of the ₱13,996,193.24 follows:

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Acting Chief 

Accountant to assign a dedicated staff to locate the documents pertaining to 

the abnormal balances; hence, necessary adjustment could be made, if 

warranted. 

 

The Accounting Division already made the necessary entry in CY 2021 to adjust 

several abnormal balances under JEV No. 01-2021-01-043A. 

 

 

Unreliable Inventory account balances 

 

5. The existence, completeness and accuracy of the carrying amount of Inventory 
accounts of ₱166,957,092.30 is doubtful due to a discrepancy between the GL 

and the RPCI of ₱132,058,986.51, which reconciliation could not be done since 

the SLCs were not updated. 

 

Appendix 57, Volume II of the GAM describes the SLC as a form used by 

the Accounting Division/Unit for each type of supplies to record all receipts and 

issues made. The RPCI shall be reconciled with the SLCs and the controlling 

accounts. Any discrepancies shall be immediately verified and adjusted. 

 



49 

Inquiry revealed that due to the implementation of skeletal work force, and 

a change of personnel handling the SLCs, the same were not updated. Consequently, 

the reconciliation between the SLCs and the RPCI was not done. 

 

The maintenance of appropriate records such as SLCs and the subsequent 

reconciliation of accounting and property records are all vital internal controls to 

ensure the existence and reliability of inventories and its balances. Their absence 

thereof resulted in the difficulty of ascertaining the completeness and accuracy of 

the reported balances in the financial statements. 

 

Comparison between the GL and RPCI disclosed a discrepancy of 

₱132,058,986.51, which remained unreconciled at year-end, as follows: 

 
Account Name Per GL (₱) Per RPCI (₱) Discrepancy (₱) 

Office Supplies Inventory 7,680,310.66 2,236,763.32 5,443,547.34

     Total 166,957,092.30 34,898,105.79 132,058,986.51 

 

The discrepancy casted doubt on the reported balances of Inventory accounts. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the concerned staff to 

update the SLCs and reconcile said records with the RPCI prepared by the 

Inventory Committee. 

 

Management Comment: 

 

Due to multiple lockdowns implemented by the Government and PSC, the periodic 

reconciliations between the Accounting Division and Property and Supply Office 

were delayed. In addition, several supplies issuances in CYs 2019 and 2020 were 

just submitted to the Accounting Division in CY 2021, further causing the late 

recording of adjustments.  

 

 

Unreliable PPE account balances 

 

6. The reported PPE accounts balances with a total cost of ₱4,336,530,531.36 as 
at December 31, 2020 are unreliable due to discrepancies between the GL and 

the RPCPPE totaling ₱833,065,288.53, which causes of the variance are subject 

of reconciliation. 

 

Appendices 69 and 70, Volume II of the GAM provide that the RPCPPE 

shall be reconciled with the Property Cards (PCs), PPE Ledger Cards (PPELCs) and 

the control accounts every year.  

 

The RCPPE is the form used to report the physical count of PPE by 

classification such as land, land improvements, infrastructure, buildings and other 



50 

structures, machinery and equipment, transportation equipment, furniture, fixtures 

and book, etc. which are owned by the agency. The report is indispensable in the 

reconciliation of balances between the accounting and property records to validate 

the recorded accountabilities in both records. 

 

Comparison between the results of the physical count of PPE and the 

balances per books disclosed a discrepancy totaling ₱833,065,288.53, which 

remained unreconciled as at December 31, 2020, with details as follows:

Inquiry disclosed that due to the implementation of skeletal work force, the 

reconciliation of records has been delayed. The discrepancies may be attributable to 

the following: 

 

PPE Account Discrepancy 

Power Supply The fully depreciated generator was still not included 

in the RPCPPE 
Other Structures The PPELCs listed 130 structures versus the 138 

structures in the RPCPPE 
Office Equipment Newly purchased equipment was not included in the 

RPCPPE (printer and photocopiers costing 

₱976,500.00 and ₱201,715.20, respectively) 
ICT Equipment The PPELCs listed 1,062 HP laptop computers 

versus the 1,022 units in the RPCPPE. Also, semi-

expendable items (239 pcs. mobile phones) worth 

₱1,604,072.40 were capitalized 
Communication Equipment Fully depreciated mobile phones (purchased from 

2003 to 2008) were still reported in the PPELCs 
Medical Equipment Newly acquired medical equipment totaling 

₱71,831,547.00 were not counted 
Sports Equipment Newly acquired sports equipment from Crayon 



51 

Sporting Goods were not counted 
Motor Vehicles Acquisition cost of the Hyundai Grand Starex TCI 

Ambulance per GL was ₱1,495,000.00 versus 

₱1,876,960.00 in the RPCPPE. Also, one motorcycle 

costing ₱81,000.00 was not counted 
Furniture and Fixtures Purchases in CY 2020 totaling ₱25,445,390.80 were 

not counted 
Books The fully depreciated encyclopedia, software books, 

sports medicine books and educational, medical and 

sports books worth ₱666,759.25 were not reported in 

the RPCPPE 
Other PPE 387 units of newly acquired refrigerators were not 

counted 
Construction in Progress The construction cost per Engineering and 

Maintenance Unit (EMU) was not updated on the 

increase of percentage of completion (e.g., 

percentage of completion for the Rehabilitation of 

North and South Dormitories with project cost of 

₱13,072,780.00 was already 86.55% completed or 

₱11,314,491.09, but the amount per EMU was only 

₱8,979,490.86 or 68.69% completed). Likewise, 

there were differences in the cost of the on-going 

projects per EMU against the Accounting Division 

 

Likewise, PCs have yet to be updated by the PSO; thus, further verification 

could not be done. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a. require the Acting Chief Accountant and the Heads of PSO and EMU to 
expedite the reconciliation of their records; and 

 

b. instruct the Head, PSO to assign a dedicated staff to update the PCs. 
 

 

Overstated Accounts Payable 

 

7. Inter-agency and other payables amounting to ₱107,601,695.15 were 
recognized as Accounts Payable contrary to COA Circular No. 2020-001 

prescribing the updated RCA, thus overstating the Accounts Payable account 

by 39.18 per cent of its ₱274,588,007.75 year-end balance.  

 

To establish uniformity in the recording and reporting of financial 

transactions of all government agencies, the COA prescribed the updated Revised 

Chart of Accounts through COA Circular No. 2020-001 dated January 8, 2020.  

 



52 

Review and analysis of the account disclosed that 17 transactions totaling 

₱107,601,695.15 were misclassified as Accounts Payable, which is described as the 

account to use for receipt of goods or services on account in the normal course of 

trade and business operation.  The 17 transactions are as follows:

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Acting Chief

balances of the payable accounts. 

 

 

Understated depreciation and amortization expenses  

 

8. The reported depreciation expenses and the corresponding accumulated 
depreciation were both understated by ₱1,090,057.92 while the reported 

amortization expenses and the corresponding accumulated amortization were 

both understated by ₱185,250.00, due to the incorrect computation by the 

Accounting Division, contrary to the policy provided in the GAM. 

 

Section 27, Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM provides that depreciation 

of PPE begins when it is available for use such as when it is in the location and 

condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by 

management.   

 

While Section 9, Chapter 12 provides that the depreciable amount of an 

intangible asset with a finite useful life shall be allocated on a systematic basis over 

its useful life. As a guideline, the finite useful life of intangible assets shall be 2 to 

10 years. Amortization shall begin when the asset is available for use. 

 



54 

Review of the depreciation expenses of PPE for CY 2020 revealed that the 

Accounting Division started computing for the depreciation expenses only at the 

time of payment, instead of at the time when such PPE were available for use. As a 

result, the various Depreciation Expenses and the corresponding Accumulated 

Depreciation accounts were both understated by ₱1,090,057.92 since there were 

time lags from the utilization of the PPE to the payment. Details are as follows:

On the other hand, the Accounting Division failed to record in CY 2020 

the amortization expenses in the amount of ₱185,250.00 ([2,340,000.00 x 95% / 10] 

x 10/12). Said amount was the amortization expense for the Management and 

Inventory System amounting to ₱2,340,000.00 that was procured on March 10, 

2020 recorded under the account Computer Software. 

 

In view thereof, the accounts Amortization-Computer Software and the 

Accumulated Amortization-Computer Software were both understated by 

₱185,250.00. 

 



55 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Acting Chief 

Accountant to draw a Journal Entry Voucher to correct the error in the books 

of accounts, and henceforth, strictly observe the proper computation of the 

depreciation and amortization expenses. 

 

 

Padded athletes and coaches allowances  

 

9. The weak internal control payroll administration system resulted in padded 
athletes’ and coaches’ allowances totaling ₱3,026,700.00 that were credited to 

the bank accounts of three COS employees, and allowances involving the 

amount of ₱2,178,186.67 were still given to the athletes and coaches despite 

several deficiencies, resulting in loss of government funds. 

 

The existing PSC Implementing Guidelines for granting of allowances to 

national coaches and local coaches including the Procedure and Work Instruction 

Manual (PAWIM) and Citizen’s Charter Handbook of PSC and COA fiscal policies 

provide the following duties of the relevant PSC Offices in charge of the payroll of 

athletes and coaches: 

 

a) National Sports Association Affairs Office (NSAAO) – evaluates requests for 
inclusion, replacement, reclassification, dropping and retroactive allowances of 

athletes and coaches in the National Training Pool based on approved quota 

and implementing policies of the PSC; 

 

b) Assistance and Coordination Division (ACD) – provides report of attendance 
to athletes and coaches as proof in the processing of their allowance, checks 

the total training days present and number of absences as well as the signatures 

of athletes and coaches, and incorporates all approved Board Resolutions for 

implementation (dropping, inclusion, revised line-up, approved/disapproved 

request for retroactive allowance); and 

 

c) Accounting Division – verifies the completeness of the supporting documents 
and that the amount claimed is proper. 

 

Likewise, the following fiscal policies are provided in PD No. 1445: 

 

Section 2. It is the declared policy of the State that all resources of 

the government shall be managed, expended or utilized in 

accordance with law and regulations, and safeguard against loss or 

wastage through illegal or improper disposition, with a view to 

ensuring efficiency, economy and effectiveness in the operations of 

government. The responsibility to take care that such policy is 

faithfully adhered to rests directly with the chief or head of the 

government agency concerned. 

 



56 

Section 4. Financial transactions and operations of any government 

agency shall be governed by the fundamental principles set forth 

hereunder, to wit: 

 

- Fiscal responsibility shall, to the greatest extent, be shared by 
all those exercising authority over the financial affairs, 

transactions, and operations of the government agency 

 

- Claims against government funds shall be supported with 
complete documentation 

 

Detailed audit of the pertinent disbursement vouchers (DVs) on the 

allowances to athletes and coaches for the period January 01 to June 30, 2019 

disclosed padded allowances in the total amount of ₱3,026,700.00. Said amount was 

illegally credited to the bank accounts of three COS employees, as follows: 

 

Name of COS Bank Account No.  Padded Amount (₱) 

1. Paul Michael Ignacio 1777-0795-10 1,877,200.00 

2. Lymuel Seguilla 1777-0454-62 584,500.00 

3. Michaelle Jone Velarde 1777-0795-02 565,000.00 

     Total 3,026,700.00 

 

Likewise, we noted the following deficiencies: 

 

Audit Remarks Amount Involved (₱) 

a. Dropped per Master List but still given allowances 1,039,080.00 

b. Not in the Master List but still given allowances 641,146.67 

c. Absences were not deducted 261,860.00 

d. Double/overpayment 139,100.00 

e. No attendance sheet 97,000.00 

     Total 2,178,186.67 

 

It was noted in the 2019 audit report the loose internal control on the 

processing of allowances, such that one COS employee was completely in control of 

the preparation of the payroll report and the uploading in the LBP’s payroll system. 

Likewise, the certifying officers (ACD Head, and the Acting Chief Accountant) 

failed to observe due diligence in counterchecking, reviewing the information, 

including the bank account numbers contained in the payroll report. As a 

consequence, the ₱3,026,700.00 was illegally credited by the COS to his bank 

account number and to two other COS’ account numbers, and was not detected as 

fraudulent transactions. 

 

Moreover, the PSC has not yet submitted the validated bank accounts of 

the national athletes and coaches who received the questionable allowances of 

₱2,178,186.67, for us to determine whether said allowances were actually credited 

to their bank accounts.  



57 

 

The Management informed the Audit Team that a criminal case has been 

filed against the three COS. The PSC Fact-Finding Committee conducted the 

internal investigation, however, the administrative proceeding against the persons 

recommended to be charged in their investigation report is still ongoing. As of audit 

date, segregation of duties was in place. The payroll is prepared by the Personnel 

Office, and the uploading of the payroll to the LBP’s payroll system is prepared by 

the Accounting Division. 

 

We recommended and the PSC Board of Commissioners agreed to expedite 

the implementation of the recommendations in the investigation report of the 

Fact-Finding Committee, particularly the recovery of the illegally disbursed 

fund through padded allowances, and the imposition of administrative 

penalties against those persons who failed to exercise due diligence. 

 

Likewise, we recommended and Management agreed to require the: 

 

a. Head, NSAAO to submit the related Board Resolutions to support the 
allowances given to the athletes and coaches despite being dropped or 

excluded in the Master List, and the validated list of bank accounts of all

Management Comment: 

 

Here is an update on the status of the payroll padding case. On July 15, 2020, the 

PSC, through the assistance of the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) filed a 

complaint before the Department of Justice (DOJ) against Mr. Paul Michael 

Ignacio for qualified theft, attempted qualified theft and violation of RA No. 10175 

(Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012). Later on, upon determination of their 

involvement in the payroll padding scheme, similar complaints were filed against 

Mr. Lymuel Seguilla and Mr. Michaelle Jones Velarde. On January 13, 2021, PSC 

received the Resolution by the DOJ finding probable cause and recommending 

charging the crimes of qualified theft and attempted qualified theft under the 

Revised Penal Code (RPC) and Cyber-Related Forgery and Computer-Related 

Fraud under Section 4(b) of RA No. 10175 against respondents Ignacio, Velarde 

and Seguilla. On February 16, 2021, the undersigned received the Order from the 

Regional Trial Court of Imus City, Cavite relative to Criminal Case Nos. 23492-21 

to 523501-21 for Computer-Related Forgery under RA No. 10175 filed against 



58 

accused Ignacio, setting the case for arraignment and pre-trial on March 3, 2021. 

Said Order also directed the transfer of custody of accused Ignacio from the NBI-

Main Jail Facility to the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology (BJMP) of Imus 

City, Cavite. However, the NBI was previously directed by the DOJ in its Order 

dated July 15, 2020 to release then respondent Ignacio from NBI custody for the 

conduct of regular preliminary investigation. The RTC of Imus City already has a 

copy of said DOJ Order, and will issue a warrant of arrest for the detention of 

accused Ignacio in the BJMP of Imus City. They are now waiting for the filing of 

information on the other cases recommended to be filed by the DOJ in Imus City 

and Manila. 

 

The PSC continues to coordinate with the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) 

and the Anti-Money Laundering Council (AMLC) for the filing of appropriate 

actions for the recovery of the money illegally taken from the government. It 

proposes to the OSG to integrate the filing of the civil aspect along with the 

criminal case currently filed. 

 

 

Unliquidated 2019 SEA Games accounts 

 

10. A total of ₱1,678,404,073.02 remained unliquidated beyond the prescribed 
period to report the utilization of funds by several athletes, coaches and 

organizations out of the ₱7,312,987,378.07 funds allotted for the preparation, 

hosting, training and participation for the 2019 SEA Games. This condition 

ran counter to the existing COA rules and the PSC Board Resolution, and 

which precluded the timely and holistic audit, to report on the accountability 

of public funds relative to the operations of the biennial regional multi-sport 

event.  

 

Section 6 of COA Circular No. 94-013 requires that within 10 days after 

the end of each month/end of the agreed period for the project, the Implementing 

Agency shall submit the Report of Checks Issued and the Report of Disbursement to 

the Source Agency (SA) to report the utilization of the funds. Any unused fund shall 

be refunded to the SA upon completion of the project. 

 

While Section 5.4 of COA Circular No. 2007-001 requires that within 60 

days after the completion of the project, the NGO/PO shall submit the fund 

utilization report certified by its Accountant and approved by its President/Chairman 

to the government organization. In relation to this, PSC Board Resolution No. 316-

2010 dated September 28, 2010 requires that FA shall be liquidated within 30 days 

after completion of the purpose for which it was given. 

 

  The updated utilization report prepared by the Accounting Division 

disclosed that PSC disbursed an amount totaling ₱7,312,987,378.07 to fund the 

SEA Games events in 2019, as follows:

 Of the liquidated amount of ₱1,922,115,682.29 by PHISGOC, the Audit 

Team has audited the total amount of ₱1,313,193,480.94, which result shall be 

collaborated with the balance of ₱608,922,201.35 not audited yet since the 

liquidation reports were only submitted and processed in 2021. We noted that in 

most cases, PHISGOC sought quotations from at least three business establishments 

and awarded the purchase agreements to those with the lowest offers. The deliveries 

were mostly inspected by the concerned staff from the Property and Supply Office 

(PSO) of PSC. There were exceptional cases such as without quotation or deliveries 

were not inspected by PSO staff, the concerned PHISGOC officer then issued a 

narrative justification to explain why. Our audit included payments for the rental of 

competition venues totaling ₱168,462,9403.35 which were already pre-selected as 

the venue to conduct the sports competitions. While the liquidation reports of POC 

were only submitted and processed in 2021, thus, the Audit Team is yet to conduct 

the audit. 

 

The PSC has transferred to PS-DBM an amount totaling 

₱3,023,323,519.28 in 2019 and deliveries have been made and inspected by the 

concerned PSO staff. The PSC also transfers PTV4 an amount of ₱11,600,000.00 

for the broadcast sports coverage, while the fund transfer to City of Tagaytay of 

₱30,000,000.00 pertained to the construction and completion of the BMX, Cycling 

and Skate Parks. All fund transfers were supported by Memorandum of 

Agreements. The detailed audit of the hotel accommodations is yet to be conducted 

since the pertinent vouchers and the supporting documents are voluminous.  

 

We were informed that the outstanding accounts of the PS-DBM is under 

reconciliation by both the Accounting Division and the Property and Supply Office, 

while the balance of the City Government of Tagaytay pertains to the 10 percent 

retention money, which remained unliquidated despite repeated demands. 

 

The Accounting Division had also sent demand letters requiring the 

athletes and coaches to submit the liquidation reports of the FA, to no avail. 

According to PHISGOC and POC, their submission of the liquidation documents 

was delayed due to the implementation of community quarantines because of the 

pandemic. Further, PHISGOC requested extension of its submission since the 

financial audit of their operation is yet to be completed by their private auditor. 

 

Timely and complete reporting and accounting of public funds are essential 

aspect of good governance where stakeholders like the PSC officers and the 

oversight agencies and other interested public are provided with necessary 



61 

information on the fund utilization; hence, the existence of outstanding accounts 

casts doubts on its validity thereof. 

 

 We recommended and Management agreed to require the: 

 

a. Accounting Division and Property and Supply Office to continue to 
reconcile their records with the PS-DBM; and 

 

b. Accountable persons and organizations to immediately submit the 
liquidation report together with the supporting documents for each 

outstanding FA and/or refund the balance of the transferred fund; and 

 

Likewise, we recommended and the PSC Board of Commissioners agreed to 

require the PHISGOC to submit the: 

 

a. final fund utilization report covering all the FA and expenditures 
pertaining to the SEA Games events; 

 

b. audited financial reports for CY 2020 transactions pertaining to PSC 
funds, and subsequent periods; 

 

c. collection reports disclosing all the revenues/receipts derived from all the 
SEA Games events including all donations/sponsorships from private 

institutions, duly supported by Official Receipts and contracts; and 

 

d. bank statements for funds received from PSC, country-
participants/delegations and others.
