OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

 

A. Financial Audit 
 

Unreliable balance of CIB-LCCA 
 

1. The CIB-LCCA and the Accumulated Surplus accounts are both understated 
by ₱104,260.00 due to unrecorded prior years’ disbursement amounting to 

₱30,187.50, tax payments of ₱1,612.50 and direct deposits to the bank by 

unidentified clients/attendees totalling ₱136,060.00.   

 

Paragraph 29 (b) of IPSAS 1 requires an entity to present information, 

including accounting policies, in a manner that meets a number of qualitative 

characteristics. This guidance summarizes the qualitative characteristics of financial 

reporting.  Qualitative characteristics are the attributes that make the information 

provided in financial statements useful to users. The four principal qualitative 

characteristics are understandability, relevance, reliability and comparability.  

 

Reliability is characterized as a reliable information that is free from material 

error and bias, and can be depended on by users to represent faithfully that which it 

purports to represent or could reasonably be expected to represent.  

 

As at December 31, 2020, the CIB-LCCA balance of ₱3,975,720.60 is 

composed of three bank accounts.  However, result of bank confirmation showed a 

total balance of ₱4,079,980.60; hence, a discrepancy of ₱104,260.00, to wit:

CIB-LCCA Balance 3,975,720.60  4,079,980.60  104,260.00  

 

As gleaned from the above table, the discrepancy of ₱29,000.00 and 

₱133,260.00 from the bank accounts for publication and seminar fee, respectively, 

were from the prior years’ errors, as shown in the table below.

     Total (29,000.00) 133,260.00 

 

Inquiry with the Accountant revealed that the said disbursements were 

unrecorded due to the failure of the Cashier to submit the corresponding 

disbursement vouchers (DVs) and supporting documents to the Accounting Division.  

Further, she revealed that the total unidentified deposits of ₱136,060.00 (₱2,800.00 

for Publication and ₱133,260.00 for Seminar fee) represented deposits made by 

unidentified buyers/attendees directly to the bank accounts.  However, the validated 

bank deposit slips were not presented to the CFL’s Cashier for issuance of official 

receipts (ORs), which is the basis of recording the same. 

 

The above prior years’ unrecorded deposits of ₱136,060.00 and disbursements 

of ₱31,800.00 resulted in a net understatement of CIB-LCCA and Accumulated 

Surplus by ₱104,260.00.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a. require the Cashier to submit the supporting documents for the 
disbursements totalling ₱31,800.00 to the Accounting Division, for 

recording of the same; 

 

b. instruct the Accountant to prepare JEV to record in the books the deposits 
made by clients/attendees directly to the bank based on the Bank 

Reconciliation Statement; and 

 

c. require the Property/Supply Unit to make an inquiry on the identity of the 
clients who deposited directly to the bank, and henceforth, advice all clients 

to present their validated deposit slips to the Cashier, for the issuance of 

ORs. 

 

 

Unreliable balances of the Inventory Held for Sale and Held for Distribution 
 

2. Unrecorded inventories and textbooks totalling ₱188,671.61 was noted due to 
non-preparation by the Property Custodian of the Report of Supplies and 

Materials Issued (RSMI) used as basis by the Accounting Unit to record the 

issuance and distribution of the inventories and printed materials, resulting in 

the overstatement of accounts Inventory Held for Sale and Inventory Held for 

Distribution reported balances and understatement of related expenses of the 

same amount.  

 

Appendix 66, Volume II of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) 

requires that the results of the physical count be presented in the RPCI and be 



32 

 

reconciled with the Supply Ledger Cards (SLCs), Stock Cards (SCs) and other 

controlling accounts and property records. Should there be any discrepancy noted, 

the same should be verified and adjusted accordingly. 

 

Section 17(g), Chapter 8, Volume I of the GAM provides that Report of 

Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI) (Appendix 64) shall be prepared by the 

Property and/or Supply Custodian and shall be used by the Accounting Division/Unit 

as basis in preparing the JEV to record the supplies and materials issued.  

 

As of December 31, 2020, records showed a discrepancy of ₱188,671.61 

between the accounts Inventory Held for Sale-Merchandise Inventory and Inventory 

Held for Distribution-Textbooks & Instructional Materials for Distribution totalling 

₱2,549,039.33 and the submitted RPCI with a total balance of ₱2,360,367.72. The 

details follow:

          Total 2,549,039.33  2,360,367.72  188,671.61  

 

Inquiry revealed that no RSMIs were prepared by the Property/Supply 

Custodian for the textbooks and instructional materials; hence, there was no basis for 

the Accountant to record their issuances and distributions. Management claimed that 

that the reason for the non-preparation of the RSMI was due to the retirement of the 

former Property Custodian in April 2020, and the currently appointed custodian is 

also the concurrent Cashier of the Agency.  

   

It was likewise noted that the Accounting Division had not maintained the 

corresponding SLCs for the said inventory items, preventing the Audit Team to 

adopt alternative audit procedure to check their accuracy. 

  

Section 17(c), Chapter 8 provides that SLCs (Appendix 57) shall be used to 

record materials received and issued, and their balance both in quantity and amount, 

at any time. It shall be maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit for each kind of 

supplies and materials. The maintenance of the SLC allows the verification of the 

amount of inventory on hand at all times. 

 

The correctness of the balances of the accounts Inventories Held for Sale and 

Inventories Held for Distribution could not be ascertained due to the non-preparation 

of the RSMIs by the Property Custodian, thereby, the non-recording of their 

issuances and distribution, which resulted in the discrepancy of ₱188,671.61 with the 

RPCI balance. 

 



33 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a. require the Property/Supply Custodian to prepare and submit RSMI 

regularly to the Accounting Division; and 

 

b. instruct the Accountant to: 

• make necessary adjusting entries to reflect the correct balances of the 

affected accounts; 

• maintain SLCs to be reconciled periodically with the RPCI; and 

• identify and adjust any discrepancy noted.  

 

 

Non-derecognition of an obsolete and unserviceable computer software 
 

3. Unserviceable and obsolete computer software amounting to ₱158,600.00 was 
not derecognized from the books, thus overstating the accounts Computer 

Software and understating its related Accumulated Surplus Amortization.  

 

On February 28, 2015, CFL purchased one Single Use License ArcGIS for 

Desktop Basic (formerly ArcView) from GeoData System Technologies, Inc., 

amounting to ₱158,600.00. This ArcGIS is a GIS, a software used by a cartographer 

in creating maps of languages of each regions of the Philippines for the Sangay ng 

Salita at Gramatika in their Linguistic Atlas Project, which was implemented from 

April 2014 to October 2015.   

 

Verification of the ArcGIS warranty certificate issued by software provider 

showed that this was for Desktop Basic and for Single Use License only. It likewise 

provided that the complimentary maintenance is only for one year, from the date of 

delivery, including the software updates. 

 

Further verification of the accounting record disclosed that no recognition of 

amortization was made to allocate the amortization amount of the asset over its 

useful life.  According to the Accountant, she classified the ArcGIS as an intangible 

asset with indefinite life, based on Paragraph 88 of IPSAS 31, since the user of the 

software claimed that it could be used in the future. 

 

Paragraph 88 states that the accounting for an intangible asset is based on its 

useful life. An intangible asset with a finite useful life is amortized, and an intangible 

asset with an indefinite useful life is not. 

 

However, Paragraphs 90 and 91 provides that the term indefinite does not 

mean infinite. The useful life of an intangible asset reflects only that level of future 

maintenance expenditure required to maintain the asset at its standard of 

performance at the time of estimating the asset’s useful life, and the entity’s ability 

and intention to reach such a level. Given the rapid change in technology, computer 



34 

 

software and many other intangible assets are susceptible to technological 

obsolescence and therefore, it is likely that their useful life is short. 

 

It was learned that the ArcGIS has not been used since September 2019, but 

was not derecognized, in non-conformity with Section 14, Chapter 12, Volume I of 

the GAM, which states that intangible assets shall be derecognized (a) on disposals 

(including disposal through a non-exchange transaction); or (b) when no future 

economic benefits or service potential are expected from its use or disposal. 

 

Thus, the Audit Team requested for an inspection, and confirmed that the 

ArcGIS was installed in a desktop that had become unserviceable/declared beyond 

repair as of March 31, 2020. Consequently, the team requested the user of the 

software to reinstall it in another desktop, but as confirmed by their IT officer, this 

was no longer working. 

 

The non-amortization and non-derecognition of the ArcGIS overstated the 

account Computer Software and understated its related Accumulated Surplus 

account.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to 

appropriately adjust in the books of accounts Computer Software and 

Accumulated Surplus accounts.  

 

 

B. Compliance Audit  
 

Incurrence of additional salary of Contract of Service (COS) 
 

4. Deficiencies were noted in the engagement of COS personnel such as (a) salary 
rates of two COS personnel were more than 20 percent of their comparable 

plantilla positions inconsistent with Section 11.5 of the COA-DBM JC No. 2, 

and (b) unverifiable accomplishment reports of four COS hence, the 

reasonableness of the payment of their salaries could not be established.  

 

COA-DBM JC No. 2 dated October 20, 2020 was issued to update existing 

policies on the engagement of COS and JO workers to ensure the smooth, effective, 

and efficient delivery of services to the public.  Section 5, thereof, defined COS as an 

engagement of the services of an individual, private firm, other government agency, 

non-governmental agency or international organization as consultant, learning 

service provider or technical expert to undertake special project or job within a 

specific period. 

  
Further, Section 11.5 of the same JC provides that the salary rate of COS shall 

be paid equivalent to the daily wage/salary of comparable positions in government 

and may also be granted a premium of up to 20 percent of their respective 

wage/salary. 

 



35 

 

During the year, the Personnel Services Itemization and Plantilla of Personnel 

(PSIPOP) of the agency showed that out of the 65 approved plantilla positions, only 

52 were filled-up, hence, CFL engaged the services of 17 individual COS. 

 

The Audit Team analysed the accomplishment reports of six sampled COS to 

determine whether their accomplishment reports and their job descriptions were 

comparable with the unfilled plantilla personnel and their equivalent salary grades 

(SGs). It was noted, that out of the six sampled accomplishment reports, two COS 

have accomplishment reports that did not equate with the salary rates granted to 

them, as shown in the table below.

functions of the Executive

Chairman or his office. 

 

As shown above, the given rates to the two COS disclosed that their rate is 97 

to 175 percent higher than the rate given to its comparable positions, which is 

inconsistent with the aforementioned Section 11.5 of the Joint Circular that provides 

the salary rate of COS shall be paid equivalent to the daily wage/salary of 

comparable positions in government and may also be granted a premium of up to 20 

percent of their respective wage/salary. 

  

Validation of the submitted accomplishment reports of the COS revealed that, 

as mentioned in the above Table, the tasks of the two Special Assistant COS were 

comparable, if not exactly the same as that of the Administrative Assistant II (SG 8) 

and Senior Administrative Assistant II (SG 14).    

 

Hiring the services of special assistants as COS with the salary ranging from 

₱57,805.00 to ₱69,366.00 who performed tasks comparable to the duties and 

responsibilities of a regular employee with lesser remuneration not only caused 

incurrence of additional expenses, but could also induce demoralization among the 

rank-and-file employees. 

 

Moreover, the Audit Team could not establish the validity or the 

reasonableness of the payment for the services of the sampled four COS since they 



37 

 

reported almost the same if not exactly the same tasks every month for the entire 

contract period. Likewise, their accomplishment reports were not detailed and 

without specifics, such as the name of the reports/communications drafted; 

attendance to various meetings; summary report for the reviewed policies and 

guidelines; and other deliverables to support the submitted accomplishment reports. 

 

It was also in the submitted accomplishment report of the Special Assistant to the 

Office of the Acting Chairman, that she is representing an officer in conferences, 

seminars and lectures, which was inappropriate for lack of employee-employer 

relationship with CFL since according to Rule XI of Civil Service Commission 

(CSC) Memorandum Circular (MC) No. 40, s. 1998, workers under COS are not 

covered by CS law, rules, and regulations and that services rendered thereunder are 

not considered as government service. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a. require the Human Resource Unit to evaluate the duties and responsibilities 
of the hired COS and align their respective salary rates with the 

comparable plantilla positions in compliance with the COA-DBM JC No. 2; 

 

b. require the Human Resource Unit to fill in the vacant position before hiring 
COS and be prudent in spending government resources amidst the current 

situation of the country; and 

 

c. instruct the COS personnel to submit detailed, clear and measurable proof 
or documentation, to fully support the activities listed in their 

Accomplishment Reports.  

  

Delayed submission of Contracts/MOAs/POs/JOs 
 

5. Delayed submission of the copies of perfected Contracts/Memorandum of 
Agreements (MOAs)/Purchase Orders (POs)/Job Order (JOs) and supporting 

documents from 7 to 420 days after execution or delivery of the goods, contrary 

to Section 3.1.1 and 3.2.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 

2009, precluded their timely review; hence, correction of any deficiencies noted 

therein.  

 

Section 3.1.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009, on the 

submission and review process of contracts, states that: 

 

Within five (5) working days from the execution of a contract by the 

government or any of its subdivisions, agencies or instrumentalities, 
including government-owned and controlled corporations and their 

subsidiaries, a copy of said contract and each of all the documents 

forming part thereof by reference or incorporation shall be furnished to 

the Auditor of the agency concerned xxx 



38 

 

 

While Section 3.2.1 of the same Circular, on the submission of purchase 

orders, states that: 

 

A copy of any purchase order irrespective of amount, and each and 

every supporting document, shall, within five (5) working days from 

issuance thereof, be submitted to the Auditor concerned xxx 

 

Our records showed that copies of perfected contracts and approved POs/JOs 

were submitted beyond the required timeframe of five days after its execution, as 

follows: 

 

Document No. of Days delayed 

Employment Contracts 7 - 208 

Pos/JOs 89 - 420 

 

It was likewise noted that no supporting documents such as sales invoices, 

delivery receipts or inspection and acceptance reports were attached to the submitted 

POs/JOs. 

 

As a result, the Audit Team were precluded from performing the timely review 

and evaluation of the contracts/POs/JOs and to communicate deficiencies, if any, 

from the review/evaluation conducted, as early as possible, for the management to 

effect corrective measures. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Procurement 

Officer to observe the five-day reglementary period for the submission of all 

contracts and POs and JOs and other documents to facilitate timely review and 

appropriate action by the auditor. 

 

 

C. Other Areas 
 

Covid Related Expenses 
 

6. The Management was able to respond and combat the threat of the COVID-19 
global pandemic during CY 2020. 

  

For the year, Management carried out the following activities and measures in 

respond to the threat of COVID 19 pandemic that wreaked havoc and claimed

Implementation and Gender and Development (GAD) Plans and Budget 

 

8. The CFL had formulated a GAD Plan designed to address gender issues for FY 
2020. 

 

Section 31 of the General Provision (GP) of RA No. 11465 or the General 

Appropriation Act (GAA) for Fiscal Year 2020 provides the Programs and Projects 

related to GAD.  All agencies of the government shall formulate GAD Plan designed 

to address gender issues, insofar as it relates to their intended functions, and integrate 

the same in their regular activities. 

 

The CFL GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) included one client focused activity 

and five organizational focused activities, and attributed six programs for CY 2020 

for a total of 12 GAD activities. Due to the pandemic, out of the 12, only 4 activities 

were accomplished as reported in the submitted GAD accomplishment report on the 

implementation of GAD activities with an actual cost of ₱381,386.10 or 0.60 percent 

of its released budget of ₱63,042,443.00, to wit:
