EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 

 

A. Introduction 
 

The Commission on the Filipino Language (CFL) is a government office under 

the Office of the President created under Republic Act (RA) No. 7104, signed on 

August 14, 1991 by former President Corazon C. Aquino.  The CFL was formerly 

the Institute of Philippine Languages (IPL) which replaced the Institute of National 

Language (INL) by virtue of Executive Order (EO) No. 117 issued by President 

Corazon C. Aquino in January 1987.  The INL was established in 1939 by 

Commonwealth Act No. 184 s. 1936 and was the first government agency to initiate 

the development of the national language of the Philippines. 

 

The CFL is mandated to undertake, coordinate and promote researches for the 

development, propagation and preservation of Filipino and other Philippine 

languages.  

 

The vision of CFL is to make Filipino an instrument of national development. 

Its mission is to promote the continued development and use of Filipino as a national 

language while preserving indigenous languages of the Philippines towards greater 

understanding, unity and prosperity of the Filipino people.  

 

The Commission is headed by Chairman Arthur P. Casanova who is assisted 

by two full-time Commissioners. As of December 31, 2020, CFL has a total 

manpower of 69, consisting of 52 regular plantilla position and 17 contract of

D. Scope of Audit 
 

The audit covered the accounts and operations of CFL for CY 2020. It was 

conducted to: a) ascertain the level of assurance that may be placed on the 

Management’s assertion on the financial statements; b) determine the propriety of 

transactions as well as extent of compliance on the applicable laws, rules and 

regulations; c) recommend agency’s improvement opportunities; and d) determine 

the extent of implementation of prior years’ audit recommendations.  Moreover, the 

audit was conducted in accordance with International Standards of Supreme Audit 

Institutions (ISSAIs). 

 

 

E. Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements 
 

The Auditor rendered an unqualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of 

the financial statements of CFL as at December 31, 2020. 

 

 

F. Summary of Significant Observations and Recommendations 
 

The following are the significant audit observations and the corresponding 

recommendations, details of which are discussed in Part II of this report. 

 

1.   The Cash in Bank-Local Currency, Current Account (CIB-LCCA) and the 
Accumulated Surplus accounts are both understated by ₱104,260.00 due to 

unrecorded prior years’ disbursement amounting to ₱30,187.50, tax payments of 

₱1,612.50 and direct deposits to the bank by unidentified clients/attendees 

totaling ₱136,060.00.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a. require the Cashier to submit the supporting documents for the disbursements 
totaling ₱31,800.00 to the Accounting Division, for recording of the same; 

 

b. instruct the Accountant to prepare journal entry voucher (JEV) to record in 
the books the deposits made by clients/attendees directly to the bank based on 

the Bank Reconciliation Statement; and 

 

c. require the Property/Supply Unit to make an inquiry on the identity of the 
clients who deposited directly to the bank, and henceforth, advice all clients 

to present their validated deposit slips to the Cashier, for the issuance of 

Official Receipts (OR). 

 

2.   Unrecorded inventories and textbooks totaling ₱188,671.61 was noted due to 
non-preparation by the Property Custodian of the Report of Supplies and 

Materials Issued (RSMI) used as basis by the Accounting Unit to record the 



 

 iv 

issuance and distribution of the inventories and printed materials, resulting in the 

overstatement of accounts Inventory Held for Sale and Inventory Held for 

Distribution reported balances and understatement of related expenses of the 

same amount. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a. require the Property/Supply Custodian to prepare and submit RSMI regularly 

to the Accounting Division; and 

 

b. instruct the Accountant to: 

• make necessary adjusting entries to reflect the correct balances of the 

affected accounts; 

• maintain Supply Ledger Cards (SLC) to be reconciled periodically with 

the Report on the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI); and  

• identify and adjust any discrepancy noted. 

3.   Unserviceable and obsolete computer software amounting to ₱158,600.00 was 
not derecognized from the books, thus overstating the account Computer 

Software and understating its related Accumulated Surplus account.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to 

appropriately adjust in the books of accounts Computer Software and 

Accumulated Surplus accounts.  

 

4.  Deficiencies were noted in the engagement of contract of service (COS) 
personnel such as (a) salary rates of two COS personnel were more than 20 

percent of their comparable plantilla positions inconsistent with Section 11.5 of 

the COA-DBM Joint Circular (JC) No. 2, and (b) unverifiable accomplishment 

reports of four COS, hence, the reasonableness of the payment of their salaries 

could not be established.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a. require the Human Resource Unit to evaluate the duties and responsibilities 
of the hired COS and align their respective salary rates with the comparable 

plantilla positions in compliance with the COA-DBM JC No. 2; 

 

b. require the Human Resource Unit to fill in the vacant position before hiring 
COS and be prudent in spending government resources amidst the current 

situation of the country; and 

 

c. instruct the COS personnel to submit detailed, clear and measurable proof or 
documentation, to fully support the activities listed in their Accomplishment 

Reports. 



 

 v 

 

G. Status of Implementation of Prior Years’ Audit Recommendations 
 

Of the nine audit recommendations embodied in the CY 2019 Annual Audit 

Report, eight were implemented and one was not implemented. The details are 

presented in Part III of this report.
