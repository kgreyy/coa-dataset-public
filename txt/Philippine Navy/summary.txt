C)	SCOPE OF AUDIT

D)	INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT



The auditor rendered an unmodified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the FS as at December 31, 2020. The Matrix of Analysis on the Effect of the Misstatements on the FS is shown in Annex B of this report.

	

E)	SIGNIFICANT OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



1)	The balance of the Cash in Bank – Local Currency Current Account amounting to ₱317,913,336.42 as of December 31, 2020 is understated by ₱7,076,068.66 due to unrecorded reconciling items contrary to Sections 5 and 6, Chapter 21 of the Government Accounting Manual for National Government Agencies (GAM for NGAs) Volume I; thus, affecting the fair presentation of the financial statements. (Observation No. 1) 

 

	We recommended that Management instruct the: (a) Navy Finance Service Unit (NFSU)-Manila and Disbursement and Remittance Unit (DRU)  to request for documents from the bank to support the unrecorded debit and credit memoranda; (b) NFSU-Manila to inquire from the depository bank the status of deposits in transit which have been outstanding for three months or more; and (c) Naval Accounting Service Office (NASO) to prepare Journal Entry Voucher (JEV) on reconciling items to reflect correct balance of the account and submit explanation on the inclusion of deposits made in January 2021 in the Bank Reconciliation Statement for the month of December 31, 2020.

	

2)	The Inventory balance of ₱1,729,213,542.37 as of December 31, 2020 is unreliable due to unreconciled difference amounting to ₱418,474,740.25 between the accounting records and the property records, contrary to Section 17 Chapter 8 and Section 6 Chapter 21 Volume I of the GAM of NGAs. (Observation No. 2)



	We recommended that Management require the concerned Field Service Property Accountability Office (FSPAO) and Field Accounting Service Unit (FASU) to reconcile their records regularly in order to detect discrepancies and effect immediate corrections on the inventory accounts.

	

3)	Receivable from Procurement Service – Department of Budget and Management (PS-DBM) for various fund transfers totaling ₱37,215,537.49 cannot be ascertained due to discrepancy of ₱10,938,419.13 between the PN book balance and the PS-DBM confirmation reply which is attributed to lack of regular reconciliation of records and coordination between the two agencies contrary to Section 7, Chapter 19 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, thereby casting doubt on the accuracy of the Due from National Government Agencies account  balance  of ₱37,227,073.94 as at year-end. (Observation No. 3)



	We recommended that Management require the: (a) Office of the Assistant Chief of Naval Staff for Logistics (O/N4) and Naval Accounting Service Office (NASO) to submit status of idle funds totaling ₱29,625,085.00 as reported in the Accomplishment Report of the PS-IATF and related documents pertaining thereto; (b) O/N4 and NASO to exert efforts to immediately reconcile their records with the PS-DBM to reflect the correct balances and request for the return of long outstanding fund transfers; and (c) NASO to instruct the respective FASUs to coordinate with concerned units of Logistics Office and Supply Office for the submission of lacking liquidation documents from PS-DBM for  recording in the books. 

	

4)	The balance of the Due from Government Owned and/or Controlled Corporations account of ₱2,078,751,871.98 as at year-end is unreliable due to accounting errors totaling ₱63,550,987.18 affecting fund transfers to the Philippine Trading International Corporation (PITC) and accounting deficiency attributed to inadequate reconciliation of the PN and PITC records with a variance of ₱110,286,343.99; thus, affecting the fair presentation of the financial statements. Furthermore, residual balances totaling ₱1,973,234.14 were not returned/refunded to PN while projects totaling ₱2,011,860,224.60 remained uncompleted at year-end despite the lapse of more than two years. (Observation No. 4)

	

	We recommended that Management direct the: (a) O/N4 to coordinate with PITC and request for documents pertaining to PN reconciling items for subsequent submission to NASO; (b) NASO to prepare necessary journal entries to record reconciling items upon receipt of documents from the O/N4; (c) O/N4 and NASO to reconcile their records with PITC for variance amounting to ₱110,286,343.99; and (d) O/N4 and the respective unit’s logistics office to request the immediate delivery of uncompleted projects and to demand the refund of the residual balances amounting to ₱1,973,234.14.

	

5)	The balance of Other Prepayments account amounting to ₱1,274,150,179.20 as of December 31, 2020 is unreliable due to deliveries totaling ₱47,212,664.04 that remained unrecorded caused by delayed/non-submission of liquidation reports contrary to the requirements of Section 15, Chapter I of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I; thus, resulted in the misstatements of the affected accounts in the financial statements. Furthermore, the balance includes CY 2018 and prior years’ fund transfers to foreign banks amounting to ₱398,887,523.85 for various procurements which remained undelivered or partially delivered as at year-end. (Observation No. 5)



	We recommended that Management instruct the: (a) O/N4 to exert efforts in gathering liquidating documents for submission to NASO as basis in recording in the books of accounts; (b) NASO to prepare JEV upon receipt of documents; and (c) O/N4 to request the immediate delivery of uncompleted projects.

	

6)	The accuracy of the Repairs, Maintenance and Construction (RMC) Fund balance amounting to ₱287,762,426.03 as of December 31, 2020 for rebates and patronage discounts from Petron Corporation is unreliable due to variance amounting to ₱7,352,747.75 between the accounting records and the Program of Expenditures (POE) for RMC Funds; thus, affecting the fair presentation of the Other Receivables account and related accounts in the financial statements. Further, ten completed and delivered projects amounting to ₱102,753,930.83 charged against the Fund were not recognized in the books; thereby misstating the appropriate PPE account and the Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) account.  Moreover, 18 programmed projects covering FYs 2015 to 2018 remained uncompleted and undelivered as at year-end. (Observation No. 6)



	We recommended that Management instruct the: (a) O/N4 to: (i) coordinate with the Petron Corporation and request the submission of documents relative to completed projects as basis of recording in the books of accounts; (ii) reconcile its records with that of the Naval Logistics Center (NLC) and eventually with the records of Petron Corporation; and (iii) request from Petron Corporation to fast track the implementation of the  remaining 18 projects; and (b) NASO to require the FASU of NLC to recognize in the books the completed projects totaling ₱102,753,930.83 and prepare adjusting entry on the remaining balance of RMC Fund after reconciliation.



7)	The accuracy of the Property, Plant and Equipment account balance aggregating ₱17,578,423,328.90 as at year-end is doubtful due to: (a) unrecorded PPEs found-at-station of two PN units due to absence of information/documents;                  (b) unrecorded transfer to Naval Logistics Center of motor vehicle amounting to ₱388,888.89; and (c) unrecorded transfer to Philippine Fleet of unserviceable equipment with net book value of ₱37,206.00. Moreover, appraised values of found at station PPEs were not supported with documents. (Observation No. 7)



	We recommended that Management instruct the: (a) FSPAO of concerned units to exert efforts to appraise the value of PPEs found at station and record the same in the books of accounts; (b) implement the guidelines prescribed in COA Circular No. 2020-006 dated January 31, 2020, in cleansing the PPE accounts; and          (c) FASU of Naval Installation and Facilities-West (NIF-W) to prepare necessary adjusting entry to drop the life rafts from the books of accounts duly supported with documents.

	

8)	Collections for various receipts totaling ₱52,496,154.71 were deposited to the PN Trust Receipt account instead of the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) as required in Section 4 of the General Provisions of R.A. No. 11465 or GAA of CY 2020, and Section 2 of Special Provisions of PN. (Observation No. 8)



We recommended that Management instruct the PNFC and NASO to facilitate the payment of utilities and honoraria for CY 2020 and remit to the BTr the balance, if any, including the amount of ₱52,496,154.71. 



9)	Out of the projects amounting to ₱1,495,104,593.84 procured through Deposits on Letters of Credit (DLC), 8.78 percent or ₱131,238,452.76 of which pertained to prior years’ transactions that remained uncompleted or unliquidated as at year-end, resulting in the accumulation of the DLC balance which affects the efficiency of the agency’s operation. (Observation No. 9)

	

	We recommended that Management direct the O/N4 and the concerned unit’s logistics office to request from the contractor/supplier the immediate delivery or fast track implementation of projects.

 

10)	Out of the overpayments made to officials and employees amounting to ₱27,811,425.46, only 53.56 percent or ₱14,895,932.09 was collected during the year leaving a balance of ₱12,915,493.37 as at year-end which signifies weak internal control over collection thereby resulting in the accumulation of receivable from officers and employees. (Observation No. 10)



	We recommended that Management require the Centralized Payroll Management Unit (CPMU) to: (a) fast track the formulation of policy/Standard Operating Procedures; (b) deduct the overpayment from salaries of concerned personnel until full recovery of the amount; and (c) instruct the NFSU to coordinate with the Office of the Assistant Chief of Naval Staff for Personnel, O/N1 for the current assignment of concerned personnel prior to sending of Demand Letter/Notices.



11)	Retention money amounting to ₱2,284,541.50 to guaranty the delivery/performance of the project remained outstanding in the books despite project completion and lapse of warranty period for more than two years due to failure of the concerned suppliers to claim the same contrary to Section 62.1 of the Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of Republic Act No. 9184. (Observation No. 11)



	We recommended that Management instruct the Field Accounting Service Unit- Philippine Fleet (FASU-PF) to inform concerned suppliers/contracts of the refund of their retention money/guaranty deposits.



12)	The accuracy and reliability of the Other Receivables account balance of ₱263,791,542.29 as of December 31, 2020 cannot be ascertained due to non-reconciliation of the FASU records and the Support Facility Administration (SFA) reports of the Bonifacio Naval Station with a variance amounting to ₱357,101.12. Moreover, the balance includes long outstanding accounts in two PN units totaling ₱8,236,259.76 deemed uncollectible. (Observation No. 12)



We recommended that Management direct the: (a) FASU and SFA of BNS to:     (i) trace unreconciled balance and FASU to prepare necessary adjusting entries to reflect correct balance of accounts and SFA to submit documents to support the adjustments; (ii) regularly coordinate and reconcile books/records and carefully review and check accuracy of amounts indicated in the reports; and (iii) make sure that all supporting documents are complete, and the amounts requested for write-off are accurate. (b) Commanding Officer and the Collecting and Remittance Officer (CRO) of Community and Special Service Unit (CSSU) formerly SFA, NBC to analyze receivables which are dormant/ non-moving for more than 10 years for proper disposition and derecognition.  File a request for authority to write-off dormant accounts from COA for receivables which could no longer be collected, duly supported with documents.



13)	Of the realigned/received funds amounting to ₱260,370,972.17 for COVID-19 related expenses, 99.78 percent or ₱259,789,527.17 was obligated/utilized during the year, leaving a balance of ₱581,445.00.  Moreover, various deficiencies were noted in the utilization of funds contrary to the existing rules and regulations. (Observation No. 13)



	We recommended that Management require the: (a) FSPAO, HSG to submit photocopy of Inspection and Acceptance Report with Delivery Receipt  to the Office of the Auditor for procurement amounting to ₱390,125.00; (b) Field Accountant and the SDO of FMRF to adhere to the provisions of COA Circular No. 97-002 relative to the manner of granting and liquidation of CAs; (c) FSPAO and Logistics Office of BNS to submit additional supporting documents on the distribution of procured items to all recipients; (d) Field Accountant of NLC to submit required documents immediately to avoid suspension  in audit of transactions. Likewise, require the Commander to instruct the Field Accountant to scrutinize supporting documents of claims and ensure that claims are supported with complete documents before payment is made; and (e) Chief of the 302nd Contracting Office of Philippine Fleet to properly observe period of action of procurement activities pursuant to RA No. 9184.



14)	The PN posted absorptive capacity of 99.14 and 94.30 percent on allotment over appropriations and obligation over allotments; respectively, which manifests its commitment towards the attainment/accomplishment of programs, projects and activities. (Observation No. 14)

 

	We recommended that Management instruct the NASO and Office of the Assistance Chief of Naval Staff for Financial Management, O/N10 to continue its commendable efforts in the attainment of a high absorptive capacity in the Agency’s allotment over appropriations and obligation over allotment.

	

15)	The PN had implemented Gender and Development (GAD) responsive projects, activities and programs with attributed cost of ₱10,211,899,692.95 or 35.15 percent of its total appropriations for CY 2020.  However, the GAD Plan and Budget and the corresponding GAD Accomplishment Report were not submitted to the Philippine Commission on Women (PCW) for review and endorsement as required in PCW-DBM-NEDA Joint Memorandum Circular (JMC) No. 2012-01.



	We recommended that Management require the PN GAD Center to: (a) continue its commendable efforts to identify and implement GAD related programs, projects and activities; and (b) ensure compliance to requirements of the Circular on submission, review and endorsement of GAD Plan and Budget and the corresponding GAD Accomplishment Report. (Observation No. 15)



The foregoing observations and recommendations were brought to the attention of concerned officials of the agency in our letter dated April 21, 2021 for further comment. Management comments and compliance with the recommendations were considered in this report, where appropriate.
