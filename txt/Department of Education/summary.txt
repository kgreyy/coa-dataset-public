the name of the agency from Department of Education, Culture and Sports (DECS) to 

Department of Education (DepEd). 

 

 The Department is organized into two major structural components: the Central Office 

(CO) and the Field Offices (FOs), which consist of 17 Regional Offices (ROs), 223 Schools 

Division Offices (SDOs) with 27,709 secondary schools (16,954 public and 10,755 private)

a) lapses in the budget utilization of ₱3,220,873,835.58 as of December 31, 2020 

such as, among others:   i) ₱1,390,073,721.10 funds were not immediately released 

to the ROs by DepEd CO and to the Schools Division Offices (SDOs) by the two 

ROs, ii) only 41.02 percent or ₱915,626,354.65 was disbursed of the 

₱2,232,216,345.18 obligated allotments in the six ROs, iii) ₱396,290,172.69  

funds were unutilized in the seven ROs; and b) flawed/ incomplete/ delayed 

procurement, reproduction and delivery of Self Learning Modules (SLMs) in 78 

SDOs of 15 ROs, thus affecting the overall effective implementation of the BE-

LCP adopted by the Department to relentlessly carry out its mandate of providing 

quality basic education in spite of the Pandemic crisis. Moreover, the validity and 

propriety of BE-LCP financial/disbursement transactions totaling 

₱4,009,042,807.72 were not fully ascertained by the Audit Teams and/or doubtful 

due to a) non-/incomplete submission of the required documents; b) non-/delayed 

submission of perfected contracts/ Purchase Orders and insufficiency of 

supporting documents; c) non-compliance with the IRR of RA No. 9184 and Other 

Issuances on Government Procurement; and d) inadequate supporting documents 

and other deficiencies in disbursements and procurements. (Observation No. 3) 

 

Lapses in Budget Utilization 

 

We recommended that Management require the following Offices:  

 

CO, NCR, CAR, I, III, IV-B, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX and XIII to- 

 

a) strictly follow the provisions in the allocation, release, and utilization of 
BE-LCP fund as prescribed under DepEd Order No. 2020-018;

a clear policy defining, among others, the timetable on the release of the 

Sub-AROs to facilitate the effective and efficient implementation of the 

program; 

 

c) maximize the utilization of allotment received by coordinating with the 
SDOs and IUs to further identify and address identified lapses and 

conduct close monitoring of the programs and activities to ensure that 

they are implemented as planned; 

 



xxi 

 

d) direct the BAC to fast track the procurement process for the remaining 
funds in order not to delay the implementation of BE-LCP for the 

succeeding quarters;  

 

e) ensure that utilization of fund is properly documented in accordance 
with the existing rules and guidelines to support its validity and 

propriety; 

 

Region VIII to-

and based on “per Grade Level on a per subject and topic basis which meant 

covering all Grade Levels and subjects per level as well as topics per subject, 

for the entire School Year (SY) of 2020-2021, in addition to the currently 

practiced Modular Distance Learning of SLMs distribution consonant to 

the directives contained in DepEd Order Nos. 18 and 19, series of 2020; 

 

g) coordinate with barangay officials for the identification of families who 
really need assistance in the teaching of their children.  The use of 

barangay facilities such as internet connectivity, computers and 

television can help families who do not have any of such equipment for 

the playing of recorded lectures or viewing of online lectures; 

 

h) furthermore, in case of limitation relative to funding requirements in 
conducting lectures, make proper representation to the Department 

Secretary to raise it as an issue consonant to DepEd Order No. 18, such 

as in the case of procurement of laptops and other equipment needed for 

the implementation of online or recorded lectures considering 

particularly that their acquisition if costing ₱15,000 or more is not 

allowed under Item 6.8 of said rule; and 

 

Region XIII to- 

 

i) direct the Curriculum Information Division to conduct proper 
identification of recipients, through proper coordination with the 

Regional Office, and thoroughly validate the actual need of the schools 

who offered digitized learning modality and student learners in need of 

the devices before procuring devices like tablets and OTGs/USBs; and 

instruct the EPS Focal Person to identify the appropriate recipients that 

should be prioritized with the available tablets procured to address the 

actual and diverse needs of the student learners. 

 

The Management’s comments/actions/commitments are as follows: 

 

 Process was also delayed due to AWA, and the restricted mobility with 
IATF rules enforced; 



xxii 

 

 Delays were also attributed to the following: amounts for allocation were 
based on available enrolment data, which were unstable; areas affected by 

typhoons “Quinta”, “Rolly”, and “Ulysses”; delayed process and provision 

of ready-to-print SLMs from the CO; and limited availability of suppliers 

which resulted to contracting services of different printing houses; and 

 The Bayanihan Fund I and II allocated for BE-LCP program had reached 
an obligation rate of 92.56% and 62.29%, respectively. 

 

Non-/incomplete submission of the required documents regarding BE-LCP 

 

We recommended that Management:  

 

a) require the concerned Offices/Divisions to submit the required reports, 
schedules and documents to the Audit Team within 10 days from date of 

receipt thereof from the AO as provided in COA Circular No. 97-002; 

and  
 

b) suspend automatically the payment of salaries of the employees/officials 
concerned not later than 10 days from receipt thereof, until they have 

complied with the requirements of the Commission on Audit pursuant to 

the provisions of Section 122 of PD No. 1445. 
 

The Management’s Comments and Auditor’s Rejoinder are presented below:

NCR, ROs III, 

IV-A, V, VI, IX, 

and XI 

The required reports, schedules and 

documents were already submitted to the 

office of the resident Auditor. 

Management comments are 

well noted and the submitted 

documents will be further 

evaluated. Further, we will 

continue to monitor the 

compliance of the Division 

in the regular submission of 

reports and disbursement 

and validate the records and 

reports of the Division, 

particularly on BE-LCP 

implementation. 

II and IV-B Will comply with the audit recommendations 

and will submit DVs, LRs, and the required 

reports  

VIII In SDO Maasin City, DVs totaling 

P28,789,336.07 were already submitted to the 

COA and the remaining transactions will be 

submitted immediately. Likewise, SDO 

Ormoc City delayed was due to travel 

restrictions, skeleton workforce and there 

were times the finance personnel were in 

home quarantine, there was a delay in the 

submission of the liquidation reports. But will 

be doing their best effort to submit the reports 

on or before the specified dates. Meanwhile. 

SDO Samar, the Accounting Department 

strictly requires the submission of the 

liquidation of the BE-LCP. In fact, several 

memoranda were issued stating the deadline 

of the submission of the different tranches. 



xxiii 

 

 

Non-/ delayed submission of perfected contracts and Purchase Orders (POs) 

and insufficiency of supporting documents  

 

We recommended that Management:  
 

a) submit justification on the delayed submission of contracts/POs contrary 
to COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009, as non-

compliance therewith affected the timely review of the contracts/POs and 

correction of errors to prevent the issuance of Notice of 

Suspension/Disallowance;   

 

b) furnish the Audit Team with the delivery documents, such as Delivery 
Receipts (DRs) and Inspection and Acceptance Report (IAR) within 24 

hours from delivery, in adherence to COA Circular No. 96-010 dated 

August 16, 1996; and 

 

c) submit the lacking required supporting documents in contracts that are 
considered necessary in the auditorial/legal review and in the technical 

evaluation thereof pursuant to COA Circular Nos. 2009-01 and 2012-001, 

otherwise, issuance of Notice of Suspension on any payments related to 

that contract is inevitable. 
 

The Management’s comments/actions/commitments are as follows: 

 

 most of the ROs informed their respective auditors that they have submitted 
the reportorial documents, but were delayed due to the alternative working 

arrangement, and the rise of COVID cases (for NCR); and 

 others committed to comply with the observations and submit the remaining 
lacking documents. 

 

Non-compliance with the IRR of RA No. 9184 and Other Issuances on 

Government Procurement

avoid splitting of requisition pursuant to the provisions of the Revised 

IRR of RA No. 9184 and COA Circular No. 2009-002 dated May 18, 2009. 

Otherwise, officials and employees concerned in-charge in the conduct of 

procurement process should be dealt with accordingly;

Entity’s website and submit to the GPPB or post it on the GPPB online 

portal; 

 

f) ensure that procurement of common-use supplies is made initially with 
DBM-PS. If stocks are not available from DBM-PS, secure therefrom the 

Procurement Service Certificate of Non-Availability of Stocks before 

resorting to the alternative mode of procurement such as Shopping; and 

 

g) adhere to all procurement processes, including the thorough deliberation 
and meticulous assessment by the BAC of the eligibility of prospective 

bidders to be covered by Resolution/s and the preparation of required 

documents as prescribed in the 2016 IRR of RA No. 9184 to ensure 

beneficial procurements to the government, thus precluding any doubts 

on the propriety of the transaction. 

 

The Management’s comments/actions/commitments are as follows: 

 

 concerned offices provided their respective auditors with explanations on the 
observed non-compliance (i.e. letter request from suppliers, Bidding 

Documents, minutes of the meetings, and etc.); and  

 ensured that the Commission’s recommendations will be taken seriously and 
all required documents will be submitted promptly. 

 

Inadequate supporting documents and other deficiencies in disbursements 

and procurements 

 

We recommended, and the Management of concerned Offices agreed, to: 

 

a) require the Accountant to submit the lacking documents, exercise due 
diligence in processing of claims and ensure that all 

disbursements/utilization of government funds are authorized and

properly supported with necessary documents to avoid audit 

suspension/disallowance;  

 

b) for SDO Marikina and Agusan del Sur, require the School Heads to 
exercise due diligence in assessing the School’s “hierarchy of needs” in 

the prioritization of use of funds without compromising the health and 

safety of learners, teaching and non-teaching personnel in response to the 

COVID-19 situation pursuant to DepEd Order No. 15, s. 2020; and defer 

non-essential activities in compliance with NBC No. 580 to prioritize the 

activities to support the implementation of the BE-LCP; 

 

c) for Quezon province, refund the excess payment of the contract cost 
amounting to ₱3,293,433.00 and instruct the Property and Supply 

Officer and Inspectors to conduct judicious examination of the items 

delivered to ensure the correctness of the quantity and specifications as 

against the Purchase Order/contract; 

 

d) for SDO Masbate, coordinate with the concerned Suppliers and demand 
the full delivery of the printing equipment and materials according to the 

specifications and the terms set forth in the approved POs/Contracts; 

 

e) for SDO Aklan, require the concerned School Heads to refund the double 
payment incurred and the amount found irregularly paid, and ensure 

that it is duly receipted and recorded in the books of accounts;  

 

f) for Isabela City, Talisay and Tagum City, to stop the practice of 
processing DVs without complete documentation and strictly observe the 

regulations on prohibition against advance payment on government 

contracts in accordance with Section 88 of PD No. 1445 and pertinent 

provisions of GAM for NGAs, Volume I; 

 

g) for General Santos, investigate the procurement process of the Non-IUs 
Schools particularly on the selection of participating suppliers, the 

request for submission of quotations and the awarding process and hold 

those liable for involvement in the irregularities and if warranted, initiate 

administrative and as well criminal charges against the persons liable; 

and 

 

h) for SDO of Isabela City, discontinue the practice of purchasing the 
equipment directly from suppliers regardless of the source of funds, 

which is not in accordance with the 2016 Revised IRR of RA No. 9184, 

and require the Accountant to record the receipt of funds in the books as 

Donation in Cash and secure complete documents for the purchase of 

equipment.

The Management’s comments/actions/commitments are as follows: 

 

 The SDOs will work on the submission of required documents; 

 The procurement of the air purifiers, vacuum cleaners, and pressure washers 
were done to safeguard the health and safety of its employees /personnel/ 

workers; 

 Delay in the transmission of documents was caused by the imposition of the 
ECQ; 

 Processing of voucher without complete delivery was done to avoid 
reversion/lapsing of NCA; and 

 Frequent power interruptions and machine breakdowns for some areas caused 
the delay in the printing of modules. 

 

Non-preparation/maintenance of prescribed forms for issuance and recording 

of inventory items 

 

We recommended that Management: 

 

a) strictly comply with the provisions of Chapter 8, Volume I of the GAM 
for NGAs, relative to the procedures in the Receipt, Inspection, 

Acceptance and Recording of Inventory items; and 

 

b) require the Supply Officer to prepare and maintain the prescribed forms, 
such as: IAR, for the inspection and acceptance of purchased items; and 

SCs, for each type of SLMs. Also, document the issuances with duly 

approved RISs to be reported in the RSMI so that the Accountant could 

record the issuances for the month and monitor the running balance of 

inventory items accurately. 

 

The Management’s comments/actions/commitments are as follows: 

 

 some SDOs have already submitted complete documents while others 
committed to work on the completion of the submission of required 

documents; 

 process flows were altered due to COVID-19 pandemic; and 

 all SDOs committed to work on the improvement of their system.

SDO’s actual enrollees; 

 There was a delay in the release of funds used for printing the modules; 

 ALS programs have a different timeline in contrast with regular programs;  

 Delay in the delivery of SLMs was due to unforeseen circumstances brought 
by the COVID-19 Pandemic; 

 Delay in the delivery of ready-to-print digital copies of the learning modules 
was due to the fact that the developed modules underwent thorough review 

and evaluation to weed out possible errors in all areas of discipline; 

 Delay in the delivery of SLMs admitted by Supplier;  

 Delay in the delivery of SLMs due to the scale of production, limited timeline, 
equipment, failures, supply chain delays, and inadequate manpower; 

 BLR has not downloaded even 50% of the required modules; and  

 Delay in the bidding process. 
 

Other deficiencies noted in the audit of BE-LCP

We recommended that Management: 

 

a) strictly comply with the existing COA rules and regulations and DepEd 
guidelines on the granting, liquidation, and monitoring of cash advances; 

 

b) issue demand letters to AOs to settle their cash advances. In case of 
failure to comply, implement the withholding of salaries or any money 

due to them in accordance to COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 

10, 1997; and 

 

c) allot/provide funds to cover the purchase of medical and protocol

utilization of cash advances to ensure that the same are utilized for its 

intended purpose pursuant to Section 4 of COA Circular No. 97-002 

dated February 10, 1997. 

 

 Non-withholding of taxes from the payments to the reproduction of learning 
modules 

 

We recommended that Management: 

 

a) require the Accounting Unit to ensure that the required and appropriate 
withholding taxes are deducted before making any payment to 

Suppliers/Consultants for the services rendered in accordance with the 

abovementioned provisions and that the same are remitted to the BIR 

within the prescribed period; and 

 

b) comply strictly with the BIR RMC No. 23- 2007 to avoid possibility of 
fines and penalties. 

 

 Purchases of Capital Outlay items costing ₱15,000.00 and above 
 

We recommended that the Management: 

 

a) submit justification on the non-adherence to DepEd Order No. 018, s. 
2020, which provides that purchase of capital items costing ₱15,000 and 

above is not allowed; and 

 

b) submit the detailed budget of the approved cash advance showing the 
breakdown of the allocated fund to schools and justification on granting 

of cash advances to schools for the purchase of tablets instead of 

conducting procurement through competitive bidding in SDO Proper.

₱26,923,076.72 in the idle/dormant/unneccesary bank accounts, contrary to the 

existing pertinent laws, rules and regulations. (Observation No. 4) 

 

We reiterated the recommendation that Management must secure authority 

from the Permanent Committee to maintain the current accounts which are 

considered extremely essential in the operations of the Agency and refrain 

from transferring funds from its MDS to currents accounts. Otherwise, close 

the unauthorized current accounts and remit the remaining balances to the 

BTr, pursuant to the existing laws, rules and regulations. 

 

5. Fund transfer to NGAs, LGUs, GOCCs and NGOs for the implementation of 
various projects/programs in DepEd CO and RO IV-A, with an aggregate amount 

of ₱1,847,144,377.17 remained unliquidated as at yearend, which included the 

₱95,258,169.61 dormant balances for more than ten years,due to leniency in 

requiring and monitoring the submission of liquidation and/or fund utilization 

reports from the Implementing Agencies (IAs) contrary to COA Circular Nos. 94-

013, 2007-001 and DepEd Order No. 23, s. 2020 dated December 13, 1994, October 

25, 2007, and September 20, 2020, respectively, hence casting doubts on the 

collectability of receivables and affecting the reliability of the account balances 

presented in the FSs. (Observation No. 7) 



xxxi 

 

 

We reiterated our PYs’ recommendation that the Management: 

 

a) coordinate directly with the concerned Implementing Agencies (IAs) 
requiring the submission of LRs/RODs on transferred funds for finished 

programs/projects for proper recording; 

 

b) validate the status of all unliquidated fund transfers and take 
appropriate action to demand immediate liquidation, or take 

appropriate legal processes to demand compliance with the MOA; and 

 

c) initiate the request for a write-off on the inter-agency and other 
receivables that remained non-moving for ten years or more in the books, 

according to COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016, duly 

supported with the necessary documents. 

 

6. Advances to the DBM-PS recorded under the Due from NGAs account by the 
DepEd CO, and NCR included past due/dormant balances totaling 

₱5,213,124,633.05, pertaining  to the procurement of computer hardware and 

software for distribution to various public elementary, and secondary schools 

nationwide under the DepEd Computerization Program (DCP) and the procurement 

of various instructional materials/textbooks/learning materials for public schools 

nationwide, thus affecting the efficient program delivery and leaving a huge amount 

of funds idle in the account of DBM-PS. (Observation No. 8) 

 

We recommended that the Management: 

 

a) regularly reconcile records with those with the DBM-PS, monitor 
diligently the fund utilization and the timely delivery of procured items 

and immediately inform the DBM-PS about the existence of undelivered 

supplies to avoid the accumulation thereof; 

 

b) establish its own monitoring of deliveries of supplies and equipment 
procured from DBM-PS per APR and assign Agency Control Number 

(ACN) to facilitate reconciliation with the Accounting Office; and 

 

c) limit fund transfer and apply its current requirements from the 
transferred funds outstanding with the DBM-PS and/or demand the 

refund of the unutilized/dormant funds, and remit the same to the BTr. 

 

7. Audit of the Advances accounts of DepEd CO and 15 ROs totaling 
₱2,791,640,657.24 revealed the following deficiencies: (a) unliquidated cash 

advances (CAs) aging 30 days to more than one year totaling ₱697,519,203.37; 

(b) long outstanding and dormant CAs not requested for write-off amounting to 

₱2,924,534.64; (c) advances not liquidated within the prescribed period totaling 

₱405,895,346.73; (d) grant of additional CAs even if the previous ones were not

yet settled totaling ₱316,622,433.96; (e) excess/unutilized CAs not immediately 

refunded/returned of ₱52,023,639.00; (f) late submission/non submission of 

liquidation reports; (g) incomplete documentary requirements; (h) non-liquidation 

of CA despite the completion of its intended purpose; and (i) gaps noted in the 

bonding requirements, which are contrary to existing COA rules and regulations 

and  the DepEd guidelines relative thereto. (Observation No. 12) 

 

We recommended that the Management: 

 

a) strictly comply with the existing COA rules and regulations, and DepEd 
guidelines on the granting, liquidation and monitoring of cash advances;  

 

b) issue demand letters to AOs with overdue unliquidated cash advances 
requiring immediate settlement of their accountabilities, in case of failure 

to comply, implement the withholding of salaries or any money due to 

them, including appropriate legal sanctions pursuant to Article 218 of the 

Revised Penal Code for failure to render accounts; 

 

c) exhaust all possible means to locate the whereabouts of 
retired/transferred officials and employees with outstanding advances, 

and demand immediate liquidation/refund of their unliquidated cash 

advances. Henceforth, if the settlement of which is uncertain and nil after 

having exhausted all appropriate remedies, initiate the request of write-

off of long outstanding cash advances in accordance with COA Circular 

No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016;  

 

d) stop the practice of granting cash advances to personnel not duly 
appointed or designated as Disbursing Officer;  

 

e) refrain from granting cash advances to AOs without first securing or 
renewing the fidelity bond to adequately covered for their respective 

accountabilities pursuant to Public Bonding Law; and 

 

f) secure adequate fidelity bond equivalent to the maximum accountability 
of the AO to safeguard the amount of cash in case of loss through theft 

or loss due to fortuitous event.

8. The BEFF Program - Repair and Rehabilitation of School Buildings of eight ROs- 
NCR, CAR, I, II, III, VIII, X, and XI, and new construction of classrooms in two 

ROs - NCR and II for CYs 2019 and 2020 were not carried out as 

planned/envisioned towards the provision of safe and structurally stable facilities 

that are conducive to learning and teaching given the implementation setbacks 

noted by the Audit Teams such as: a) delayed completion of projects in six ROs 

totaling ₱578,018,334.10, of which ₱202,406,600.05 pertains to DPWH

implemented projects in NCR; b)  discrepancies in the actual work performed as 

against the approved Program of Works (POW) and in the percentage of 

completion as reported by the DPWH; c) poor implementation of some aspects of 

the repairs/rehabilitation in five ROs; and d) projects not deferred during the 

period of discontinuance as economy measure. (Observation No. 18) 

 

We recommended the Management to: 

 

a) ensure strict compliance with the provisions of Annex “E” and “I” of the 
Revised IRR of RA No. 9184 and Item 3.1.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-

001 in the implementation of and monitoring of infrastructure projects; 

 

b) require the contractor to ensure 100% project accomplishment within 
the duration of the projects or the specified contract time to prevent the 

imposition of liquidated damages and other sanctions provided by 

existing regulations; 

 

c) instruct the Division Engineers (DE) to monitor regularly and evaluate 
the accomplishments of all projects it undertakes by exercising diligence 

in the contract administration ensuring, among others, that rectification 

works would be immediately undertaken and that the contractors strictly 

comply with the approved POWs; 

 

d) on the excessive quantity of unglazed tiles estimated and paid at Eusebio 
High School in DO Pasig City, submit the justification and remedy on the 

pecuniary loss obtained thereof. Carefully review, evaluated and inspect 

all documents as well as the actual works carried out by the contractor 

to ensure the project designs and estimates are properly done and paid 

according to the delivered outputs; 

 

e) on the modification/alterations on the design of Gabaldon school 
building, require Jimwen Construction and General Merchandise to 

repair and rectify the defects based on the plans and specifications of the 

project and demand refund for the items not installed and/or repaired 

but included in the payment;  

 

f) give justification or explanation on the reason why they proceeded with 
the repair/rehabilitation of school buildings during the period in which 

such projects are for discontinuance as provided in the NBC No. 580; 

 

g) observe strict compliance with COA Circular No. 2013-004 on 
information and publicity on PAPs; 

 

 

 

 



xxxiv 

 

On the DPWH project -  

 

h) conduct an immediate investigation on the incident and file appropriate 
charges to those officers involved or found negligent in the performance 

of their duties, if warranted. Make proper coordination and consultation 

with the officials who are involved in the project planning/identification 

to avoid overlapping of projects in the ensuing years; 

 

i) regular monitoring and evaluation of the status of all DepEd School 
buildings including LGU owned building construction projects should be 

conducted by the Division Engineer (DE) to ensure that duplication of 

works will be avoided; 

 

j) require the DPWH to conduct remedial measures on the defects noted 
during the inspection and require the DepEd CAR not to accept the 

school buildings if these are not corrected/rectified. Also, secure an 

assurance that the defects will not affect the structural stability of the 

school buildings obtain a report on the structural stability of the school 

building and obtain a report on the structural stability test thereof; and 

 

k) coordinate with the DPWH Engineer and request a copy of complete 
contract documents. Henceforth, the SDO Engineer should see to it that 

he/she is always provided with the contract documents implemented by 

the DPWH being the primary end-user.

After the conduct of assessment, 

DPWH did not give us feedback 

nor coordinate with us on the result 

of such findings. Likewise, this 

Division decided to request budget 

allocation from DepEd CO to 

cover the urgent 

repair/rehabilitation of classrooms 

rather than waiting for DPWH to 

implement their own project.  

On the latter part of February 

2021, DPWH informed us that

Furthermore, rest assured that 

defects/deficiencies from the 

recent repair works will be 

restored on its natural from upon 

the completion of the retrofitting 

project. 

Pasig The excessive quantity of tiles and 

paid was brought about by 

inadvertent human error in the 

preparation of the said program of 

works. Further, the concurrence of 

the CO to the said program upon 

its submission thereof gave the 

Division Engineer the impression 

that it had been reviewed again and 

that it bore no mistake in it, thus, 

giving some of leeway for 

scrutiny. Please be assured that 

more careful review and 

evaluation of program of works 

and stricter implementation of the 

projects in the future shall be 

observed. Also, the contractor has 

agreed to implement other scope of 

works at Eusebio High School 

amounting not less than the 

audited value of excessive 

unglazed tiles. 

Management is advised to strictly 

follow the existing rules and 

regulation on the matter to ensure 

that transparency, accountability, 

equity, efficiency and economy of 

the procurement of infrastructure 

project is guaranteed at all times.

there were no unused plywood 

stored in the school. All procured

Annex B. 

On Electrical Works 

 

Electric fans were removed by the 

school to avoid damage and lost 

during repair works inside the 

classroom. As to the finding that 

other switches are not working, it 

was validated last March 12, 2021 

that the electric fan that was used 

to test it, was not really 

functioning. 

 

On Scaffolding 

 

Scaffolding was needed for the 

Painting works especially on the 

painting jobs at the exterior wall to 

support the workers in painting the 

three (3) Storey-Building. 

However, for stability and 

durability and to optimally secure 

the safety of the workers, the 

contractors opted to use steel-

scaffolding which is costlier than 

the coco lumber. 

 

On Tile Works 

 

The floor tiles installed in the 

classrooms were all unglazed. The 

said tiles only appeared to be shiny 

and were misconstrued to be 

glazed. The installed floor tiles are 

common-type tiles used for 

general purposes and safe for the 

students.

contractors were more inclined to 

believe with Project Engineers of 

the DPWH even if DepEd 

Engineers had issues with the 

construction of the school 

buildings.  Further, the Regional 

Engineer informed that a 

retrofitting was done on the school 

building funded under the 2016 

BEFF located in Baguio City 

National Science HS, Irisan, 

Baguio City because of the 

findings of the DepEd CAR 

Engineers that the columns were 

not aligned. 

 

As regards the report on the 

structural stability of the said 

building, the Regional Engineer 

also informed that the report was 

already submitted to the Education 

Facilities Division of the DepEd 

CO and the same report will be 

furnished to the Audit Team.  It 

was also informed that DepEd 

CAR requested a meeting with 

DPWH-CAR concerning this audit 

observation. Besides, they 

informed the Audit Team that 

these school buildings were not yet 

accepted by DepEd-CAR 

particularly the SDOs of Baguio 

and Benguet. 

The Audit Team appreciated the 

efforts of DepEd-CAR as regards 

this matter and informed them that 

follow-ups will be made until the 

issues will be settled.

The Schools Division 

Superintendent explained that the 

delays were caused by unfavorable 

weather conditions that were not 

considered during the 

determination of the original 

contract time; request of some 

school heads for the stoppage of 

work due to school activities like 

the hosting of Ilocos Norte 

Athletic Association (INAA) 

Meet, Central Unit Meet, 

Camping/ Jamboree, Division 

Festival of Talents as well as 

Region 1 Athletic Association 

(R1AA) Trainings; and  lack of 

temporary learning facilities/ 

classrooms to be used by affected 

classes during the implementation 

of the project. 

 

Management also clarified that the 

77 days is not a contract time 

extension but the number of days 

lapsed from the issuance of Time 

Suspension Order and Resume 

Order due to the CoVid 19 

Pandemic.  They deemed 

appropriate that such orders can be 

issued without supporting 

documents taking into 

consideration the issuance of 

national emergency. 

During the Exit Conference, the 

Audit Team informed the 

Management to explain in writing 

their basis in granting suspension 

orders after the contract period so 

that COA office can evaluate 

properly.   

 

Also, a copy of evaluation report 

establishing the need for time 

extension including the 

computation showing in sufficient 

detail how the number of days of 

extension was determined, is 

necessary for the technical 

evaluation thereof.

VIII Leyte The SDO management has already 

instructed the Physical Facilities 

Unit to monitor the status of the 

projects awarded to contractors for 

the past years. This actually 

resulted to the deduction of 

significant amount of Liquidated 

Damages from the payments made 

to them. The management also has 

been strict with the grant of 

contract extensions, with 

exceptions during the lock-down 

implemented by the government. 

This audit recommendation has 

been thoroughly discussed during 

the Pre-Bid and Pre-Construction 

conferences and the contractors 

are fully aware of the 

consequences of delays incurred in 

the implementation of projects. 

Policies shall be issued to further 

enhance the mechanisms in place 

for contract implementations.

NBC 580 is clear as to its directive. 

But it has to be clear with the stand 

of the Division regarding on the 

10% discontinuance of FY 2020 

released allotment for MOOE and 

CO. This circular could not affect 

to the withhold 10% of its 

allotment regardless it has fiscal 

autonomy, this is because the 

required percentage can be 

covered by the CO. The CO has 

different P/A/Ps and “for Later 

Release”, therefore, it can cover all 

the required percentage sets by the 

circular. Thus, Department of 

Education as a whole is compliant 

to NBC 580. 

Yet as long as agency has not yet 

submitted the appropriate 

document to support their claim as 

being covered by the CO in its 

compliance with the 10% 

discontinuance of costs, it is our 

stand that the noted deficiency 

would constitute a violation to the 

particular provisions of NBC 580. 

They should have submitted the 

proof of details of the 10% 

discontinuance covering the 

operating units.

Here comes now our transactions. 

It started when the Division 

received Sub-ARO dated April 2,

undergo procurement process sets 

by the RA 9184 for repair of 

various elementary schools. It is 

clear that the dates of the contract, 

NTP up to its disbursements are 

beyond the approval date of the 

circular. But the Division believe 

that these transactions are not in 

violation of NBC 580, this is 

because of the Sub-ARO date 

which is before the approval of the 

circular. Also, there was no 

mandate from the CO to stop the 

implementation of the P/A/P and 

return the allotment. Hence, we 

request that this AOM be drop off

9. Delays in the completion and implementation of Electrification Projects 
amounting to ₱161,464,891.27 under the FYs 2018, 2019 and 2020 BEFF in NCR, 

CAR, ROs I, III, VI, X, XI, and XIII, as well as poor workmanship in NCR, were 

noted  due to procedural lapses in its administration, contrary to the contracts and 

DepEd Order No. 35 series of 2017, thus depriving the schools of the timely 

utilization of an upgraded and improved electrical system. (Observation No. 19) 

 

We recommended that the Management: 

 

a) instruct the Division Engineer to regularly monitor, evaluate, and 
validate all project accomplishment order to ensure that projects are on 

schedule; 

 

b) ensure the timely releases of Sub-AROs in order to avoid delays in the 
implementation of the projects; 

 

c) arrange the full coordination with Electric Utility Provider and other 
concerned agencies including the community of the recipient Schools to 

achieve effective and more synchronized planning and implementation 

of programs and projects; 

 

d) require the contractor to ensure 100% project accomplishments within 
the duration of the projects or the specified contract time; 

 

e) require the contractors to submit the request for final billing duly 
supported with the necessary documentary requirements if the projects 

are found to be 100% completed already; 

 

f) take actions on the unsatisfactory/insufficient performance made by the 
contractors and if necessary, investigate to ascertain if the contractors 

violated any provisions of the contract; 

 

g) ensure the necessary sanctions against the erring contractor as provided 
under RA No. 9184 such as the imposition of liquidated damages upon 

failure to complete the work within the contract period or in the event

that the total sum of liquidated damages exceeds 10 percent of the total 

contract price; and 

 

h) henceforth, minimize the delays in project implementation by:                   
(a) conscientious carrying out of the detailed engineering to ensure that 

issues and viability of the projects are properly addressed during the 

feasibility or preliminary engineering study prior to project 

implementation; (b) thorough review and evaluation of the Program of 

Work to ensure that project designs and estimates are properly prepared 

and covered the Bill of Materials issued by the Electric Utility Provider 

to minimize time extensions which often resulted to delayed completion 

of projects; and (c) strict monitoring and supervision of the projects 

implemented.

Region SDO Management Comment Auditor’s Rejoinder 

NCR San Juan Upgrading of Electrical System at San Juan 

National High School consists of two (2) 

phases. The main scope of PHASE 1 are as 

follows; replacement of panel boards and 

main circuit breaker per building, rewiring 

of feeder line, electrical powerhouse from 

service entrance to main distribution panel 

and for PHASE 2; Transformer, main 

distribution panel to distribution panel per 

building, replacement of electrical fixtures 

per building. 

 

As per audit findings, there will still 

unfinished works, defects and deficiencies 

on the project. Please be informed that such 

findings are already covered by Phase 2 

which is already on its implementation stage 

since December 21, 2020 and hopefully be 

completed on May 21, 2021. 

The Audit Team will 

verify and validate 

management actions on 

the matter. 

CAR Kalinga Management of SDO Kalinga agreed to 

evaluate the unfinished projects and non -

compliance of the winning contractor and 

impose the necessary penalties.

modernization of electrical system should be 

implemented due to proactive measures to 

prepare secondary schools on their readiness 

to operate and offer the senior high school 

program, as well as, minimize the incidence 

of overloading and ensure the safety of both 

the students and the school facilities. While 

the kilowatt usage was never mentioned 

during their workshop, this fact only became 

apparent during the contract implementation

Taking into all accounts, Management 

assured that all suggested undertakings and 

observations will be faithfully executed and 

implemented the soonest time possible and 

with utmost prompt consideration of actions. 

Bukidnon Management explained that the Project: 

Electrification of Un-energized Schools and 

Modernization of Electrical Systems On-

Grid Schools involved agencies concerned 

such as DepED, contractor, local Electric 

Cooperatives, recipient schools and even the 

community. Prior to the implementation of 

the projects specifically 2018-2019, the 

agency selected schools with electrical line 

survey thru issued Bill of Materials by the 

Local Electric Cooperatives and adapted the 

BOM in the preparation of the Program of 

Works (POW). This is to ensure that survey 

and site investigation in the source line and 

Right-of-Way were already considered. 

However, during the implementation of the 

project, plans were revised due to some 

circumstances such as Right-of-Way grant 

cannot be pushed through/feasible. Thus, 

rerouting of the proposed line and 

installation of electric posts. Scheduling of 

joint-resurvey, inspection of materials, and 

issuances of inspection reports/results, 

calibration of the transformer and issuance 

of the result, execution of MOA, 

construction of line, hang-up of transformer, 

application for turn-on, and the energization 

of the transformer has to be scheduled 

accordingly and would somehow take time 

which are unintentionally not considered in 

the contract duration specially in the first 

year of the implementation of such project. 

 

The contractor of CY 2018 project was 

issued with enough warnings and notices 

and even undertakings in this Office in order 

to complete the projects so that it will then 

be utilized by the beneficiary which is the 

recipient schools since the scope of works in 

the load side is in place and the application 

is ongoing in the local electric cooperatives. 

As of this writing, two (2) recipient schools 

were scheduled for energization by 

BUSECO, namely, Dalirig NHS and San 

Vicente NHS while others are on process. 

 

In pursuit to strengthen the coordination of 

the concerned agencies min order to 

minimize delays of the project, coordination

meetings with the local electric cooperatives 

and DepED thru the Regional Office were

concerns. The DepED-EFD CO also hired 

Electrical Engineers detailed at the Regional 

Office to assist the Division Offices in 

implementing the project thru preparation 

and revision of plans and program of works 

and monitoring of the projects. This 

Division also regularly coordinate with the 

local electric cooperative thru Official 

Letters, calls, emails, and personal 

appearance to follow-up all necessary 

applications/ requirements. School Heads of

Quarantine in the provincial level last March 

17, 2020 and the Enhance Community 

Quarantine (ECQ) in the city level from

prevention of the COVID-19 virus.  This 

limited the delivery of manpower and 

material resources to the project sites, 

leaving the projects unattended for a period 

of time. 

 

As to the second observation, the delayed 

energization of schools was affected also by 

the hindered delivery, testing and 

installation of electric materials. The 

payment of power bill deposit can only be 

made after the testing, and the approval of 

transformer and metering components had 

been conducted by ASELCO. 

ASELCO so as to 

compel the latter to 

expedite the conduct of

Moreover, other 

observations in relation 

to the BEFF which 

focused more on 

compliance with RA 

9184 were presented 

under Paragraph No. 12 

herein.  

 

10. An improvement in the utilization of DepEd-OSEC’s allotment under its Textbook 
and Other Instructional Materials Program for Calendar Year (CY) 2020 was noted 

compared to the previous years, as only ₱715,879,730.27 or 46.44 percent had 

remained unutilized as of yearend. Out of which, ₱368,042,210.97 or 51.41 

percent was associated with the savings from the awarded contracts. However, the 

unutilized CY 2019 continuing budget of ₱176,205,436.64 had already lapsed at 

yearend and the delivery of Textbooks (TXs) and Instructional Learning Materials 

(I/LMs) programmed for the school year 2020-2021 was not assured since most of 

the contracts were only awarded in December 2020, thus not in accordance with 

DepEd Order No. 74, s. 2011 dated September 29, 2011 affecting the attainment 

of its physical targets during that period and depriving its intended end-users of 

the benefits from these learning resources.  

 

Other lapses related to the program were still observed such as; a) unreliable 

reports on Buffer Stocks due to variances/errors including the control breakdown 

in the inventory management; and b) other audit recommendations in PYs 

concerning the warehouses for Buffer Stocks remained not completely acted upon 

to date. (Observation No. 21) 

 

We recommended that Management: 

 

a) continuously assess the budget needs and estimates to improve the budget 
and cash requirement utilization of its Textbook and Other Instructional 

Materials Program appropriations; 

 

b) ensure that the utilization of fund is matched with corresponding 
physical output by adhering to planned procurement schedule and 

enforcement of agreed delivery timelines in the contract with the 

supplier; 

 



xlvii 

 

c) address the noted inconsistencies/errors/variances on the Buffer Stock 
Inventory Report and account thru the BLR all stocks at the warehouses, 

maintain bin cards, and stock cards and submit the inventory report to 

the Accounting Division, COA, and the AMD for the complete and 

proper turnover of custody and accountability;  

 

d) establish the final total quantity and cost of buffer stocks delivered by the 
supplier and issued to different SDOs nationwide from CYs 2015-2019 

and submit the final/revised report duly supported with source 

documents; 

 

e) ensure adherence to Department’s specific guidelines and procedures, 
including responsible offices, officials, and appropriate documentation 

for the inventory accounting sub-systems such as: a) receipt, inspection, 

acceptance and recording deliveries; b) requisition and issue;  

c) transfer and/or disposal; and d) monitoring and inventory taking of 

inventory items; 

 

f) require the BLR/AMD to conduct the physical count of inventories semi-
annually and submit the RPCI, complete with the needed 

data/information, not later than July 31 and January 31 of each year for 

the first and second semesters, respectively; and 

 

g) address the remaining issues in the warehouses as noted in PYs’ audit 
and the inspection conducted by the AS-GSD. 

 

The Management’s comments are as follows: 

 

 The DepEd CO AMD and the Accounting Division are continuously 
reconciling the prior and current years and they are just waiting for the final 

inventory of books from BLR; 

 Management will be implementing a new Logistic System that will help them 
in the documentation of inventory; 

 As to the conduct of physical count, AMD recommended with the Accounting 
Division to conduct quarterly reconciliation starting this 3rd quarter of CY 

2021 and to include the inventory of buffer stocks in every physical count; 

and  

 For the warehouse in Taguig, they cannot recommend the repairs of the same 
because of the construction of railways and subways headed by DOTR in the 

subject DepEd property.  

 

11. The nutritional needs of the identified school children of the two ROs were not 
properly addressed on time when the a) School-Based Feeding Program (SBFP)-

regular component including its milk component for SY 2020-2021 suffered 

delays; while the b) milk feeding component for SY 2019-2020 was only 

completed at the end of CY 2020. More deficiencies that impeded the successful 



xlviii 

 

implementation of the program were likewise noted such as: c) purchased and 

distributed food and drink products categorized as RED (unhealthy); d) absence 

of product labels; e) absence of Physico-Chemical and microbiological test results 

in lieu of nutritional facts label; f) improper timing and scheme distribution  of 

food and milk commodities; g) unutilized balance of allotment amounting 

P2,695,026.00; and  h) unimplemented contracts both by Philippine Carabao 

Center (PCC) and National Dairy Authority (NDA). 

 

The foregoing deficiencies are attributable to the implementation setbacks 

encountered by the program proponents and challenges brought by the Pandemic, 

depriving the intended recipients of the maximum benefits derived from the 

feeding program and defeating the government’s thrust of promoting budget 

efficiency pursuant to existing DepEd SBFP guidelines.  (Observation No. 22) 

 

We recommended that Management: 

 

NCR – SDO Caloocan 

 

a) enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the program/project 
executions through better planning and greater coordination among all 

the levels in the Department to ensure the timely completion of the 

program and attainment of its objectives;   

 

b) confer with the CO (BLSS-SHD) and the SBFP Focal Person of DepEd-
NCR in addressing the underlying causes of the delays and setbacks 

encountered in the program implementation during its initiation, 

planning, execution, monitoring and completion;  

 

c) observe timeliness in carrying out the program to avoid delays in its 
implementation that will compromise the nutritional needs of its 

intended beneficiaries;

 check if all delivered milk products were timely consumed and to 
address the issues relating to spoiled milk products, if any; 

 ensure that all project documents have all the necessary information,

Rejoinder 

XIII - Bayugan City 

 

The Management of Bayugan City 

Division Office commented that there was 

in fact an actual conduct of the physico-

chemical and micro-biological test by the 

NDA, only that the result was not 

communicated before the delivery. In the 

next round of implementation of the milk 

feeding program, the NDA has already 

assented to the submission of the test result 

required before and during the delivery of 

the milk products and to require their 

contracted supplier to properly label the 

milk packs with the nutritional contents 

therein as required in the relevant DepEd 

Orders. 

 

The concerned personnel had made the 

same observation and stated that the matter 

had already been raised in a virtual meeting 

conducted with the NDA and other 

Division Offices. The concerned personnel 

assured to implement and observe the 

prescribed procedures on their succeeding 

SBFP-related procurements. 

 

 IV-A 

 

The remaining funds were already 

downloaded to Division Offices for feeding 

of all learners in far flung schools and 

schools with 100 enrollees; procurement of 

supplies, materials; and conduct of 

trainings and capability buildings in 

relation to SBFP. 

The remaining fund of P2,695,026.00 was 

supposedly be utilized for food and 

accommodation for the scheduled conduct 

of capability buildings and trainings in 

relation to SBFP but due to the Taal 

volcano eruption and face to face conduct 

is not allowed during COVID-19 

pandemic, the activity was instead done 

virtually.  

 

IV-A Rizal Province Management commented that they already 

informed the implementing unit to give 

details on the delivery of the milk products 

and other future implementation of feeding 

programs and assured to comply with COA 

Circular No. 94-013. 

 

IV-A Cavite Province Management commented that the FT 

amounting to P8,668,123.20 PCC had 

already been fully utilized on March 11, 

2021. The Focal Person is currently

submission. 

IV-A General Trias City Management commented that SBFP Milk 

Feeding was implemented from November 

18 to December 9, 2020. On January 13, 

2021 they made follow up to PCC thru their 

SBFP Coordinator for the liquidation but 

unfortunately one of the staff was found 

positive for COVID-19; thus, hindered the 

timely submission of reports. 

The Audit Team 

will post-audit the 

said Liquidation 

Report upon 

submission. 

 

12. In DepEd CO, only 7,555 packages or 16.29% out of the 38,827 revised targets of 
Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Packages under the DCP 

funded by the General Appropriations Acts (GAAs) for Fiscal Years (FYs) 2018-

2020 were delivered as noted in the submitted Budget Accountability Report 

(BAR) No. 1 – Quarterly Physical Report of Operation as of December 31, 2020. 

Also, comparison of the Annual Procurement Plan (APP) and Procurement 

Monitoring Report (PMR) for FY 2020 showed delays incurred ranging from 60-

317 calendar days (CD) in the procurement of the FY 2020 DCP packages with 

Approved Budget for the Contract (ABC) of ₱2.37 billion, thus, adversely 

affecting the program’s objectives of enhancing the teaching-learning process and 

raising the ICT literacy of learners and educators beneficiaries.  

 

Moreover, the status of the FY 2015 ICT packages under Batch 34 of DCP 

Unenergized Viz which procurement was transferred to the DBM-PS and 

remained not procured as per submitted Management Comments for prior year’s 

observation was not properly reported in the submitted BAR No. 1. 

 

Other deficiency was found in DepEd Region II where the delivery of IT Package 

(E-Textbooks) amounting ₱649,345.00 intended for Senior High Schools (SHS) 

were delivered to Basco Central School which is not offering any ICT Track, thus 

the intended purpose may not be achieved. (Observation No. 23) 

 

We reiterated our previous years’ recommendations that Management: 

 

a) review the Agency’s internal processes related to procurement in order 
to further improve its service delivery and its compliance with timeline 

requirements of Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA No. 

9184;  

 

b) provide an explanation/justification on the delayed implementation of 
the DCP FY 2020; 

 



liv 

 

c) provide status of procurement of the FY 2015 DCP Unenergized Viz 
(Batch 34) which was transferred to DBM-PS which should be required 

to expedite the procurement thereof; and 

  

d) require the DCP Coordinator in Region II-SDO Batanes to explain the 
delivery of IT Package (E-Textbooks) amounting to ₱649,345.00 to Basco 

Central School which is not a Senior High School offering ICT Track. 

Accordingly, inquiry shall be made with the CO as to the correctness of 

the transfer. 

 

Management’s comments/actions/commitments are as follows: 

 

 The DepEd Enterprise Resource Planning System (DERPS) project 
contains a module for Procurement that will automate several processes 

and allow DepEd to diagnose step which need to be re-engineered. 

Customization for the said module is already on-going in parallel with 

reforms in the manual processes of the procurement cycle which includes 

early procurement activities; 

 Delayed implementation of the DCP FY 2020 was due to COVID-19 crisis 
which required new mechanisms on how procurement would be done 

without face-to-face interaction. There was also restriction and limitations 

on the movement between the procuring entity and the suppliers/bidders; 

 For the FY 2015 ICT Packages under Batch 34 of DCP Unenergized Viz, 
DBM-PS has already relayed to DepED that the said funds have already 

lapsed. The Program Team will ensure coordination with our Planning 

Service for proper reporting in the BAR-1; and 

 As to the delivery of IT Package to Basco Central School, E-Textbooks are 
designed to be used from elementary to senior high school. They are not 

exclusive for ICT Track-in Grade 11-12. 

 

13. Intended beneficiaries of the Technical-Vocational-Livelihood (TVL) learning 
tools and equipment were deprived of its immediate use in DepEd Regions I 

(ROP), III (DO Pampanga), VIII (ROP), XIII (ROP) and CAR due to:                         

a) undelivered/delayed delivery and unterminated contracts, totaling 

₱86,638,202.14, b) deficiencies found in the post-audit of disbursements 

amounting to ₱34,528,962.99 including a take-over of contract of ₱1,214,692.25, 

c) undetermined status of delivery and implementation of four contracts totaling 

₱103,300,851.50 as a result of lack of proper monitoring and assessment and d) 

terminated contracts worth ₱10,195,304.00, indicating non-compliance with 

Department Order Nos. 8 series of 2016  and 046 s. 2018. (Observation No. 24) 

 

We recommended that the concerned DepEd Regions: 

 

a) take appropriate action to terminate the contracts of defaulting 
suppliers/contractors to protect the interest of the agency to ensure strict 



lv 

 

compliance with the guidelines prescribed under Annex “I” and Annex 

“D” of the Revised IRR of RA 9184; 

 

b) conduct actual inspection of the delivered TVL Tools and Equipment to 
ascertain the quality and compliance with the technical specification per 

contract; 

 

c) submit the necessary documents and proofs of compliance with 
aforementioned significant rules and regulations; 

 

d) stop the practice of splitting of contracts and strictly adhere to the 
provisions of RA No. 9184 in all procurements; 

 

e) monitor the implementation of the contract from start to end, 
particularly the delivery time; 

 

f) adhere strictly to Section 10 and 53.3 of R.A. 9184 to avoid occurrence of 
irregular expenditure which can lead to disallowance of transaction; 

 

g) ensure that the DVs and other supporting documents are completely 
filled out and signed before payment; 

 

h) conduct another procurement process to procure the undelivered items 
of the TVL tools, if possible; 

 

RO III (DO Pampanga) - 

 

i) submit an explanation or justification on the use of Small Value 
Procurement and strictly comply with Sections 53.9 and 54.1 of the RIRR 

of R.A. No. 9184; 

 

j) justify/explain why the BAC Resolution which was approved on 
December 16, 2019 was signed by the former SDS Leonardo D. Zapanta 

who was already transferred to another Division in October 2019; 

 

CAR - 

 

k) provide sanctions to the three suppliers either suspension or blacklisting 
for their failure to complete their delivery following the Uniform 

Guidelines for Blacklisting for Manufacturers, Suppliers, Distributors, 

Contractors, and Consultants of the 2016 Revised IRR of RA No. 9184; 

and 

 

l) the TWG and BAC to consider all factors such as financial capabilities, 
experience concerning the contract to be awarded, and inquiry with 

other DepEd offices and other national government agencies about the

performance of bidder in the conduct of post-qualification to prevent the 

awarding of contracts to unqualified suppliers, contractors or 

consultants. 

 

The Management’s comments as well as the Audit Team’s rejoinder are as follows: 

 
RO/SDO Management’s Comments Audit Team’s Rejoinder 

I (ROP) During the CYs 2019 and 2020, DepEd ROP has 

sent Notice of Termination of contracts to the 

contractors based on the amount of the 

undelivered TVL Equipment. The Agency also 

takes the possibility of re-bidding the undelivered 

TVL Equipment. Management also commented 

that it will schedule a meeting with the Legal Unit 

to thoroughly discuss the concrete legal actions 

needed to be taken by DepEd ROP to comply 

with COA's recommendations. 

 

III 

(Pampanga) 

The Management already submitted the omitted 

supporting documents. They also apologized for 

the use of SVP instead of Competitive Bidding, 

thinking the time and urgency of the needs of the 

students. Moreover, Management promised to 

execute future contracts pursuant to provisions of 

RA No. 9184 and will prohibit splitting of 

procurement contracts. 

 

VIII (ROP) Management commented that they shall prepare 

demand letter requiring the contractor/supplier to 

submit the necessary lacking documents to 

substantiate the veracity   and reliability of the 

reported door-to-door deliveries of TVL tools 

and equipment made to the respective recipient 

schools. 

 

XIII (ROP) The Management agreed to designate a 

responsible officer or a committee from the 

Regional Office to monitor the supplier’s 

compliance with the contract agreement - the 

delivery terms and the quality and quantity of 

items delivered, among others; and consolidate 

from time to time the inspection results of the 

TWG; and carefully assess the compliance of 

supplier and impose sanctions for violations of 

the contract such as termination of contract after 

incurrence of liquidated damages of more than 10 

percent of the contract price and forfeiture of 

performance security before its expiration. 

 

CAR During the Exit Conference, Management 

informed the Audit Team of the following:                    

1) Program Owner and Legal Officer to process 

the termination of the contract of the three 

suppliers for undelivered TVL tools and 

equipment units; 2) Management will conduct a 

meeting relative to the sanctions to be imposed;   

3) the BAC and TWG to consider all factors 

relative to the bidding process and documents 

The Audit Team commented 

that had the performance of 

these suppliers been monitored 

properly, their contracts should 

have been terminated within 

the two-year validity period of 

payables and the conduct of 

another procurement process 

would have been  still possible.

submitted by the bidders during the opening of 

bids, and 4) Program owners to strictly monitor 

the implementation of the project relative to 

procurement and implementation of the program. 

However, Management informed that the validity 

of payables had reached their validity period, thus 

they could not conduct another procurement 

process.

Observation Memoranda (AOM) and included in the Management Letter (ML) of DepEd 

CO and Consolidated Regional ML of DepEd Regional Offices, and discussed during the
