PART II – OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

Accounting Errors, Omissions and Misstatements 

 

1. The DepEd’s consolidated financial statements are materially misstated by 
₱15,474,952,612.45 on account of errors, omissions and improper accounting 

treatment of transactions that were considered as departures from the 

International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS), hence affecting the 

fair presentation of its financial position as at December 31, 2020, and its financial 

performance and cash flows for the year then ended. 

 

1.1 Section 15 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National 
Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I, states that “The financial 

statements (FSs) shall present fairly the financial position, financial 

performance and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful 

representation of the effects of transactions, other events and conditions in 

accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, 

revenue and expenses set out in Philippine Public Sector Accounting 

Standards (PPSAS)1.” 

 

1.2 Moreover, Section 111 (1) of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 provides that 
the accounts of the agency shall be kept in such detail as necessary to meet the 

needs of the agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish the information 

needed by the fiscal or control agencies of the government. 

 

1.3 The audit of the DepEd’s consolidated FSs disclosed misstatements in several 
of its accounts, as shown below:

1.5 Sections 5, 6 and 7, Chapter 21, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs provides that 
the Chief Accountant/Designated Staff shall submit the Bank Reconciliation 

Statement (BRS) within 20 days after receipt of the monthly Bank Statement 

(BS) to the COA Auditor with all the supporting documents and Journal Entry 

Vouchers (JEVs). The Chief Accountant/Designated Staff shall likewise 

prepare a JEV to recognize all reconciling items that require adjustment and 

correction in the books of accounts. 

 

1.6 Review of the submitted BRSs of the Cash in Bank – LCCA in the CO and six 
ROs showed net reconciling items per books amounting to ₱258,914,748.55 

which remained unrecorded/unadjusted at yearend. Details are shown below:

Amount  

(In Php) 

Over/ (Under) 

CO - The Cash in Bank - LCCA was understated by ₱625,286.69 

due to non-preparation of the adjusting or correcting entries 

to take up various reconciling items such as unrecorded debit 

memo, unrecorded deposits/fund transfers, cancelled stale 

checks and erroneous recording of deposits as identified in 

the BRS, thus the account was not fairly presented in the 

financial statements. 

(625,286.69) 

NCR Caloocan In SDO Caloocan, verification of BRS as of December 31, 

2020 disclosed that the variance in Cash in Bank and book 

balances was caused by the delayed recording of cash and 

check deposits for the period October 19, 2020 to December 

29, 2020 totaling ₱279,482.93. 

(279,482.93) 

I Pangasinan I In the course of review and examination of the BRS as of 

September 30, 2020, a reconciling item totaling ₱592,425.00 

presented as unrecorded deposits was noted, further 

verification showed that these were also unreceipted 

deposits. The total amount of ₱592,425.00 was accumulated 

from January to March 2020 and ₱504,925.00 of the total 

unreceipted and unrecorded deposits remained as reconciling 

items in the BRS of SDO Pangasinan I Proper as of audit date 

without any appropriate action from Management.

III ROP The BRS of Trust Account and Regional Payroll System 

Unit (RPSU) Deductions as of January 31, 2020 and March 

31, 2020, respectively, showed a number of reconciling 

items which pertain to prior year transactions that were 

already identified per the reconciliation statement but 

remained unadjusted in the books. 

(42,413,376.50) 

Prior years’ unidentified deposits of ₱2,158,494.80 and 

disbursements of ₱15,050.00 for RPSU are still included in 

the BRS and unrecorded in the books of accounts. 

(2,143,444.80) 

IV-B ROP Various reconciling items such as unrecorded debit memo 

and credit memo, unrecorded collections/ disbursements/

Total Understatement (258,914,748.55) 

 

1.7 The above noted deficiencies rendered the reported Cash in Bank – LCCA 
balance during the period unreliable. The inability of Management to complete 

the reconciliation between the GL, SL and the bank balances, prepare and 

submit BRS for all existing bank accounts, and adjust valid reconciling items 

in the books of accounts on a timely basis affected the reliability, completeness 

and accuracy of Cash in Bank’s balance as at yearend. 

 

1.8 We recommended that Management: 
 

a) coordinate with the bank for the submission of debit and credit 
advices or other substitute documents that would give information on 

the nature of the transactions to support the eventual recording in the 

books; and 

 

b) prepare the necessary JEV to record the book reconciling items in the 
Cash in Bank – LCCA account and the appropriate accounts affected. 

 

1.9 The Management commented as follows: 
 

Office/RO Management’s Comments 

CO The Management already prepared various JEVs in the 1st quarter of CY 2021 to effect 

the adjustment. The debit memo under SEAMEO trust account is still for verification. 

I Management of SDO Pangasinan I commented that the Finance and Accounting Units 

have been playing crucial roles in ensuring that their office fulfills its obligation to its 

almost 15,000 teaching and non-teaching personnel, taking into account the mandates 

received from the CO and ROs. As to the collections from Science Olympics, it could 

have been easier if the persons who deposited to the LBP account went to SDO 

Pangasinan I Proper to comply with the documentary requirements. Management 

justified further that the Cash and Accounting Units cannot be faulted for other’s 

inaction. It was also claimed that the individuals who paid thru bank deposits might 

have considered the amounts paid to be just nominal, thus never thought nor bothered 



83 

 

Office/RO Management’s Comments 

to secure an Official Receipt (OR) anymore. Nevertheless, the individuals responsible 

for the event and the personnel of the Cash and Accounting Units are already settling 

the issue at hand.   

 

For the other unreceipted and unrecorded deposits, the Division Accountant assured 

to undertake the timely reconciliation and adjustment of reconciling items in the books 

of accounts. As of March 15, 2021, deposits totaling ₱530,600.00 have already been 

issued with corresponding ORs, thus leaving an unreceipted balance of ₱63,325.00. 

X In its letter-reply dated February 15, 2021, the Division Management of Misamis 

Oriental commented that the Accounting Unit will comply with the requirements in 

strictly viewing the reports submitted for recording and verifying the entries made in 

the books of the SDO as against the source documents. On the deposit not reflected, 

unrecorded and erroneous entry for adjustment, the Division Cashier already rectified 

the errors to conform to the standards as mandated by GAM and COA Circular No. 

2015-007. Likewise, corrections were already reflected on her books after 

reconciliation.  

 

The SDO assured that the Cashier will properly monitor the Cash accounts and 

conduct reconciliation to ensure accuracy of all the records of the Division. Further, 

the Office acknowledges its deficiencies and commits to implement the 

recommendations to prevent exposing our funds to risks of loss and mishandling to 

the detriment of the Division and to enjoin strict compliance with established rules 

and guidelines. 

XI The Accountant of SDO Davao de Oro prepared an Action and Commitment Plan to 

ensure the submission of the BRS not later than August 31, 2020. 

 

a.2 Non-restoration of unreleased/stale checks – ₱137,745,686.44 
 

1.10 Section 10, Chapter 6 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, provides that “All 
checks drawn during the day, whether released or unreleased including 

cancelled checks shall be recorded chronologically in the Checks and ADA 

Disbursements Record (CkADADRec) maintained by the Cash/Treasury Unit. 

Xxx. All checks/ADA drawn whether released or unreleased shall be included 

in the Report of Checks Issued (RCI) or Report of ADA Issued (RADAI) which 

shall be prepared daily by the Cashier. The RCI/RADAI together with the 

original copies of the supporting documents shall be submitted to the 

Accounting Division/Unit for the preparation of JEV. At the end of the year, a 

Schedule of Unreleased Commercial Checks shall be prepared by the Cashier 

for submission to the Accounting Division/Unit.” 

 

1.11 Section 44, Chapter 6 of the same Manual likewise provides that “Checks may 
be cancelled when they become stale, voided or spoiled. The depository bank 

considers a check stale, if it has been outstanding for over six months from the 

date of issue or as prescribed. A stale, voided or spoiled check shall be marked 

cancelled on its face and reported as follows: 
 

a. Voided, spoiled or unclaimed stale checks with the Cashier shall be reported as 
cancelled checks in the List of Unreleased Checks that will be attached to the 

RCI. 

 

b. New checks may be issued for the replacement of stale/spoiled checks in the 
hands of the payees or holders in due course, upon submission of the stale/spoiled 



84 

 

checks to the Accounting Division/Unit. A certified copy of the previously paid 

DVs shall be attached to the request for replacement. A JEV shall be prepared to 

take up the cancellation. The replacement check shall be reported in the RCI.” 

 

1.12 Further, Section 56, Chapter 19 of the GAM for NGAs provides that: 
 

A Schedule of Unreleased Commercial Checks shall be prepared by the 

Cashier for submission to the Accounting Division/Unit. All unreleased 

checks at the end of the year shall be reverted back to the cash accounts. 

A JEV shall be prepared to recognize the restoration of the cash 

equivalent to the unreleased checks and the recognition of the appropriate 

liability/payable account. The accounting entry for the restoration of the 

unreleased check to the cash account shall be a debit to “Cash in Bank, 

Local Currency Current Account” with credit to the appropriate liability 

account. There shall be no physical cancellation of the checks. The JEV 

supporting such restoration shall form part of the supporting document 

to the financial statements to be submitted to COA at year end. At the 

start of the ensuing year, another JEV shall be drawn to reverse the 

previous entry made and recognize the availability of the checks for 

release. This procedure shall not apply to account “Cash-Modified 

Disbursement System (MDS)” since there is no actual cash with the 

GSBs. 

 

1.13 Verification of the BRSs of the Cash in Bank – LCCA in nine ROs revealed 
various unreleased checks and stale checks with an aggregate amount of 

₱137,745,686.44, which were not yet reverted, cancelled, replaced and/or

to prepare the adjusting entries in order to reflect the correct balance of

statements. 
 

1.16 The Management commented as follows: 
 

RO SDO/IU Management’s Comments 

NCR Las Piñas/CAA 

NHS 

The Management committed to comply with the audit 

recommendation regarding stale checks. 

Caloocan In a letter dated March 15, 2021 the Accountant and the Cashier 

stated that with regards the unaccounted 54 outstanding checks, 

they will closely coordinate with the previous Cashier’s Office 

personnel and a letter to LBP will be sent to determine whether 

the 54 outstanding checks were honored by the bank. Upon 

confirmation of LBP, the Accounting Unit will make appropriate 

adjusting entries in the book to restore the amount of cash 

corresponding to the identified unreleased and dishonored checks 

while the Cashier committed to coordinate with the previous 

Cashier to determine whether the subject outstanding checks 

released and honored by bank. 

Taguig/Pateros The appropriate journal entries will soon be prepared upon receipt 

of the Confirmation Letter/Certificate of Stale Checks from LBP. 

CAR ROP and Baguio 

City NHS 

The Management agreed to implement the audit 

recommendations.  

III ROP Management assured that all of the concerned personnel will be 

informed regarding the corresponding release of refunds and the 

failure of the remaining four private companies to pick up the 

checks which already became stale. 

IV-A Cavite Province The SDS, in his letter dated March 2, 2021, commented that the 

stale checks of ₱325,533.30 were already adjusted in Enhanced 

Financial Reporting System (eFRS) as of December 31, 2020; 

however, it remained in the BRS since the amount of stale checks 

were still reflected in the bank’s ending balance as of December 

31, 2020. As for stale checks under Trust Fund totaling 

₱224,225.00 and Provident Fund totaling ₱172,750.02, it was 

noted that they remained unadjusted as of December 31, 2020. 

The Management assured that they will do the necessary 

adjustment as soon as they have reconciled those long outstanding 

accounts. 

IV-B ROP 

  

The Accountant submitted a copy of JEVs partially adjusting the 

noted reconciling items under Remittances Fund. 

Calapan 

City 

The Management admitted their lapses and will regularly monitor 

the status of outstanding checks and that necessary adjustment in 

the books of accounts shall be done. 

X ICENHS 

 

The Bookkeeper and the Principal of the said school justified that 

they are unaware of such provision, thus failed to take actions on 

these stale checks. However, they will effect all the suggested 

entry of the auditor as recommended in the issued AOM. 

MCNHS In its undated Management reply, MCNHS informed that the 

Bookkeeper was directed to prepare necessary entries to record 

stale checks and furnish a copy of related JEV to COA. Further, 

the Accounting Office was directed to process only DVs with 

complete documentary requirements, validate correct name of 

payee in conformity with the Purchase Order (PO) and ensure that 

the PO will be signed first so that the items will be reserved to 

avoid cancellation of checks. 

XI Davao De Oro The Management explained that since July 2020, the Cashier had 

already prepared the List of Unreleased Checks and submitted   the   

same to the Accountant on a monthly basis. Furthermore, the 

Accountant had already submitted the corresponding JEVs to

1.18 In preparing financial statements, Management is making implicit/explicit 
claims (i.e., assertions) regarding the recognition, measurement and 

presentation of assets, liabilities, equity, income, expenses and disclosures in 

accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework, or the IPSAS. 

Among the Management’s assertions are the completeness and presentation 

and disclosure assertions. The completeness assertion addresses whether all 

transactions that were supposed to be recorded have been recognized in the 

financial statements, while the presentation and disclosure assertion addresses 

whether all transactions that should be disclosed have been disclosed. 

 

1.19 The following ROs failed to include the Cash account balances from various 
funds in their respective FS. Details are as follows:

confirmation reply from LBP in SDO Manila, the balance 

of Trust and Provident Funds at yearend amounted to 

₱12,799,511.82 and ₱39,780,825.54, respectively. In 

SDO Quezon City, the result of bank confirmation inquiry 

showed that the balance of Provident Fund at yearend 

amounted to ₱23,315,316.70. However, audit disclosed 

that the transactions related to the said funds were not 

recorded in the books of accounts of the respective SDOs

Based on the agency records, they have a common 

recurring reconciling item described as “bank maintaining 

balance” amounting to ₱500.00. Verification of the Bank 

Statements disclosed that the said reconciling items are 

made to earmark a portion of the MOOE budget of public 

schools so that the remaining cash balance at the end of a 

given period shall not be less than the maintaining balance 

required by the depository bank after considering the 

disbursements due. Although the cash amounting to 

₱500.00 shall be restricted per bank policy, such amount 

is technically a part of cash and should not have been 

deliberately excluded per agency records.

its 9 IUs 

The bank confirmation on the accounts of the SDO and 

the nine IUs revealed that these offices maintained a Local 

Currency, Savings Account in the Development Bank of 

the Philippines (DBP). The audit noted that the eGOV 

savings accounts of the aforementioned offices were not 

recorded and the account Cash in Bank-Local Currency, 

Savings Account was not used. The School Bookkeepers 

were also not aware of the account since they did not 

receive bank statements for the eGOV accounts. The 

Division Accounting Unit received bank snapshots for the 

account but thought it was a bank error since the account 

was named DepEd MisOr Div-PF same with their 

Provident Fund. The Division and school Cashiers 

commented that they were not aware that there are 

separate bank account numbers for eGOV payments and 

only knew that the DBP eGOV facility is used to pay the 

monthly remittances to Pag-IBIG and PhilHealth and that 

these balances may be for these statutory remittances.

Total Understatement (83,180,125.82) 

 

1.20 The non-recording of transactions and non-inclusion of cash balances from 
various funds understated the consolidated yearend balance of Cash accounts, 

thus affecting its fair presentation in the financial statements.

and/or corrections to ensure the fair presentation of Cash account

In its letter-reply dated February 26, 2021, the Management informed 

that the SDO already recognized and set up the said maintaining 

balances taken from previous account under JEV No. 01-2021-01-

00183 adjusted in CY 2021. Their Office assured that they will 

properly account the CIB-LCCA. Further, the Office acknowledged its 

deficiencies and committed to implement the recommendations to 

appropriately recognize assets, liabilities, and net assets/ equity in the 

FS. 

Bukidnon The initial deposit of ₱500.00 as guidelines says in the DepEd Order 

may be charged to the school's MOOE fund. The COA-DBM-DepEd 

Joint Circular (JC) No. 2019-1 dated February 4, 2019 mentioned only 

that maintaining balance of ₱500.00 shall be charged to school's 

MOOE budget. However, the two guidelines did not specify if it is to 

be treated as outside of the scope of cash advance or if it is part of a 

cash advance. If it is treated as cash advance, then it continuously 

appears in the advances record regardless if the accountable officer has 

transferred/resigned or retired. The DepEd Order only suggests that it 

shall be disclosed only in the Notes to Financial Statements. The issue 

has been relayed to the CO for the revisiting of the issued guidelines. 

Meantime, this Office will make recognition of this amount suggested 

by COA and probably not a receivable account. 

Cagayan de 

Oro City 

During the Exit Conference, the Management commented that the 

DepEd Order No. 29, s. 2019 provides specific guidelines to recognize 

the amount of ₱500.00 as Cash in Bank, not as cash advance. They 

further elaborated that there was a disclosure in the Notes to Financial 

Statements that the Cash in Bank account in the General Fund 

amounting to ₱54,500.00 pertains to the ₱500.00 maintaining balance 

by the 109 public elementary and high schools. Likewise, the Schools 

Division Superintendent (SDS) assured the Audit Team that there will 

be individual SLs to be maintained per school and the ₱500.00 will be 

disclosed every month. 

 

Audit Team’s Rejoinder: 

 

The Audit Team maintains its position that Management should record 

the ₱500.00 maintaining balance in every school’s SL so that these 

recurring reconciling items will not appear in the conduct of cash 

examination of accountable officers assigned in public schools in the 

succeeding periods. Nevertheless, the Audit Team will continue to 

monitor the extent of implementation of this audit recommendation.

On the non-recording of eGOV accounts, in its letter-reply dated 

February 26, 2021, the SDO commented that it had already instructed 

the Cashier to correct the erroneous entries and discrepancies noted in 

each of the accounts mentioned. Likewise, remittances were already 

filed and paid. The Accounting Unit committed to use the proper Cash 

accounts to record disbursements to and payments from the eGov 

facility. The personnel-in-charge, who prepares the monthly BRS was 

already instructed to include eGov account. Also, the Division 

Accountant already communicated with the DBP regarding the change 

of account name of the said eGov account. There was confusion of the 

personnel-in-charge and the Cashier because of its account name- 

“DEPED MIS OR DIV-PF” which is the same as their existing account 

but pertained to a different fund, the Provident Fund.

difference between the carrying amount of the asset and the present value of 

estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial asset’s original 

effective interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset shall be reduced either 



96 

 

directly or through use of an allowance account. The amount of the loss shall 

be recognized in surplus or deficit. 
 

1.33 IPSAS No. 26 pertains to the Impairment of Cash Generating Assets, which 
defines impairment as “a loss in the future economic benefits or service 

potential of an asset, over and above the systematic recognition of the loss of 

the asset’s future economic benefits or service potential through depreciation 

(amortization).” Impairment, therefore, reflects a decline in the utility of an 

asset to the entity that controls it. 

 

1.34 Likewise, COA Circular No. 2020-01 dated January 08, 2020 prescribes the 
use of Volume III-Revised Chart of Accounts of the GAM for NGAs. Chapter 

3, Annex A of the said COA Circular stipulates that the Allowance for 

Impairment-Loans Receivable is credited upon recognition/set up of provision 

for losses which arise from the non-collection of Loans Receivable. This 

account is debited upon collection of loan receivables, transfers, reversal of 

impairment, write-off, and/or adjustments.  
 

1.35 DepEd Order No. 037, s. 2018 on amendments to various DepEd issuances on 
Provident Funds (PF) requires that provision of bad debts for deceased 

borrowers shall be allowed at one percent of the total outstanding loans 

receivable for each Provident Fund chapter starting year 2018, subject to the 

usual accounting and auditing rules and regulations. 
 

1.36 Verification of the Loans Receivables – Others account as at December 31, 
2020 revealed that valuation reserve was not set up for CY 2020 for accounts 

with doubtful collectability. Shown on the table below is the summary of the 

Allowance for Impairment account amounting to ₱1,999,846.01 that was not 

provided by six ROs:

1.37 The failure of the six ROs to set up the Allowance for Impairment account 
overstated the various Receivables accounts. Non-recognition of allowance for 

impairment on receivables despite doubtful collectability may not provide 

realistic information on the recorded receivables. 

 



97 

 

1.38 We recommended that Management: 
 

a) require the Accounting Unit of the concerned DepEd Offices to 
prepare correcting entries for the errors and omissions noted in audit 

that caused misstatement in the Receivables account balance as at 

yearend; 

 

b) require the Division Provident Fund Secretariat to conduct assessment 
of the status of all borrowers with outstanding Provident Fund loan 

balances at the end of each reporting period and determine the 

collectability of those delinquent accounts; and 

 

c) direct the Accountant to provide for the Allowance for Impairment 
equivalent to one percent of the total outstanding loans receivable at 

yearend pursuant to Item 2.c of DepEd Order No. 037, s. 2018, to 

present fairly the Loans Receivable-Others account in the financial 

statements. 

 

1.39 The Management commented as follows: 
 

RO Management’s Comments 

I ROP - Management, thru the Accounting Section, will set up provision for impairment loss 

for the past due accounts in the Provident Fund starting this Calendar Year (CY) 2021 in 

compliance with DepEd Order No. 37, s. 2018 and GAM. 

 

Urdaneta City - The Management acknowledged the said observation and the Schools 

Division Superintendent had already raised this matter to the DepEd RO. Currently, they are 

waiting for further instructions or order from higher authorities. 

 

Alaminos City - Management is amenable to the recommendation and will set up immediately 

the required impairment loss to reflect the net realizable value of Loans Receivable. 

 

San Carlos City - The Management required the Accountant to comply with the adoption of 

Allowance for Impairment Loss yearly to present the Loans Receivable of Provident Fund to 

be with net realizable value, which fairly presents the FS. 

 

Pangasinan I - The Division Accountant had already provided for the Allowance for 

Impairment Loss account on the total outstanding loans receivable amounting to ₱565,399.14 

as per JEV No. 07-2021-02-0035 dated February 1, 2021. 

II Management agreed with the audit recommendation to make an adjusting journal entry on the 

recognition of Allowance for Impairment Loss on Loans Receivables since said loans 

receivable are outstanding for a long period of time due to separation of employee thru 

AWOL, or unexpected passing of employee. 

 

b.3 Non- recording of Audit Disallowances  

 

1.40 Pertinent provisions of the 2009 Revised Rules on Settlement of Accounts 
(RRSA) prescribed under COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 

2009 provides that: 

  



98 

 

Section 22.2 The Notice of Finality of Decision (NFD) shall be issued 

by the authorized COA official to the agency head to notify that a 

decision of the Auditor, Director, ASB of CP has become final and 

executory, there being no appeal or motion for reconsideration filed 

within the reglementary period. 

 

Section 22.6 The Chief Accountant shall, on the basis of the NFD, 

record in the books of accounts, the disallowance and/or charge as a 

receivable. 
 

1.41 Also, Section 46, Chapter 6, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs provides that: 
 

Section 46.  Accounting for Disallowances.  Disallowances shall be 

taken up in the books of accounts only when they become final and 

executory.  The Accountant shall prepare the JEV to take up the 

Receivables – Disallowances/Charges and credit the appropriate 

account for the current year or Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit)account 

if pertaining to expenses of previous years. 

 

1.42 The following audit disallowance with issued Notice of Finality of Decision 
(NFD) were not recorded in the books thereby understating the balance of the 

Receivables – Disallowance/Charges account at yearend:

Villa Jacinta National Vocational High School 38,595.00 

XI Davao City 26,000.00 

Total 826,308.21 

 

1.43 We recommended that Management require the Accountant to 
immediately record   the disallowances and comply with Section 22.6 of 

COA Circular No.  2009-006 and Section 46, Chapter 6 of GAM for NGAs, 

Volume III. 

 

1.44 The Management commented as follows: 
 

Office/RO Management’s Comment 
VIII ROP - Management commented that some of the concerned officials have already 

refunded the amounts subjected to ND prior to the receipt of NFD. However, appropriate 

adjusting entry shall likewise be taken up in the books this March 2021. 

 



99 

 

Office/RO Management’s Comment 
Northern Samar - The Accountant explained that the omission of the receivables account 

was due to the problem encountered on the generation of the final report in the eFRS. The 

system was not able to read the corresponding account codes, which resulted in non-

appearance of the accounts in the SFP, however, upon verification of the totals, it was 

found out that the balances of these accounts were included in the total balances resulting 

in balanced statement. To address the issue, the Management already coordinated with 

Central Office IT Support to make corrections or repairs to the system. 
XI The Division Accountant said that the recommendation was already implemented for the 

current year and that appropriate journal entry was already made to record the 

disallowance amounting to ₱26,000.00. However, during the Exit Conference, the Audit 

Team Leader requested the Division Accountant to provide a copy of the said JEV for 

validation. Nonetheless, the Audit Team shall monitor Management's compliance with 

the audit recommendation for CY 2021. 

 

b.4 Unrecorded Provident Loan 

  

1.45 Review of the Subsidiary Ledger (SL) of Loans Receivable as of December 
31, 2020 of the Schools Division Office (SDO) of Santiago City disclosed an 

unrecorded loan from the employees with an aggregate amount of ₱217,842.49 

(difference between the ledger, gross of negative balances, totaling 

₱4,921,127.92 and financial statement balance of ₱4,703,285.43). 

 

1.46 We recommended that Management require the Accountant to prepare 
adjusting entry to recognize the unrecorded loan receivables in the 

amount of ₱217,842.49. 
 

1.47 The Management commented that they will prepare the necessary adjustment 
after reconciliation of the amount in the books of accounts and the ledger. The 

Management asserted that disparity might be due to unposted payments in the 

SL. 

 

b.5 Erroneous classifications of accounts – P53,052,482.34 

 

1.48 Below are the details of the misclassifications made in the recording of the

account disclosed that a JEV 

was drawn to adjust the negative 

balance of Due to GSIS, which 

pertains to the excess remittance 

to GSIS. The above practice is 

contrary to prescribed 

accounting rules and regulations 

because of the absence of a valid 

source document to support the 

entry. In addition, the specific 

employees who were remitted 

in excess of what are due them 

are not identified and no SLs 

were maintained for each 

employee for record and 

monitoring purposes.

1.49 We recommended that the Management direct the Accountant of the 
concerned DepEd Offices to prepare the adjusting journal entries to 



101 

 

correct the deficiencies noted to ensure accuracy and fair presentation of 

the financial statements. 

 

1.50 SDOs Apayao, Baguio City and Benguet agreed with the audit observations 
and committed to implement the audit recommendations.  

 

1.51 Likewise, in SDO Leyte, reconciliation with the GSIS shall be made to ensure 
that the over-remittance in previous years will be corrected. Specific 

instructions will be given to the Remittance Unit so as not to incur similar 

errors in the future remittances. 

 

b.6 Various errors in recording 

 

1.52 Other errors and omissions in the recording of transactions which affected the 
fair presentation of various Receivables accounts balances of DepEd as at 

December 31, 2020 are as follows:

VI Roxas City The SDO Roxas City showed that the account Due to 

Regional Office has a negative balance of ₱1.032

revealed that the negative balance was due to their 

overpayment/over remittance to the RO of their 

liability for the salaries of teachers and employees 

under the Regional Payroll Service Unit (RPSU). The 

negative balance should have been taken up in the 

books as a receivable from the RO under the account

Liability account.

order to reflect the accurate balances of the affected accounts for fair 

presentation in the financial statements.

1.54 The Management’s comments as well as the Audit Team’s rejoinder are as 
follows: 

 
RO/SDO Management’s Comments Audit Team’s Rejoinder 

CAR - 
ROP 

The ROP agreed with the audit observations and 

committed to implement the audit recommendations. 

 

V – 

Various 

SDOs and 

Schools 

Management commented that the total SOA for the 

due to PLIs for the payroll months January to October 

2020 amounted to ₱3,062,122,006.43 while the total 

fund transfers for the same months amounted to 

₱3,133,901,677.78 and that the variance of 

₱71,779,671.35 was already addressed through 

various adjustments made within the period. 

 

Management also explained that the total amount 

required to be remitted by the SDOs and IUs for the 

period January to October 2020 was fully transferred.  

However, due to the pandemic restrictions of 

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and other 

justifiable reasons, the submission of the validated 

LDDAP-ADA and deposit slips were delayed, hence 

adjustments were recorded late in the succeeding 

months. 

 

Likewise, Management informed the Audit Team that 

all the recommendations on the said observation are 

well taken and noted to ensure the correctness of the 

amounts to be remitted to the concerned GFIs and 

PLIs. 

While the Audit Team acknowledges the effort 

made by the Accounting Section, we still insist that 

the Accounting Section must analyze carefully the 

transactions before recording the transactions in the 

books of accounts to ensure their correctness and to 

avoid the incurrence of abnormal account.  Annex 

F of the said audit observation was made to show 

the details/composition of the fund transfers, 

detailing that the amounts billed in the SOA were 

sometimes not reconciled with the fund transfers 

made by the OUs/IUs. 

  

b.7 Non-recording of donations 

 

1.55 Annex A of DepEd Order No. 24 s. 2016 dated April 25, 2016 provides the 
procedure in accommodating and utilizing financial assistance as donation. It 

states: 
A. On Receiving the Fund 

 

1. The DepEd SDO or school receives the financial assistance as 
donation from the Private Sector partner. 

2. The DepEd SDO or school deposits the fund as donation to the 
BTr. 

3. The DepEd SDO or school secures the Certification of Deposit 
from the BTr. 

 

B. On Utilizing the Fund 

 

1. The DepEd SDO or school requests the DBM for the issuance of 
Notice of Cash Allocation and for the release of funds. 

2. The DepEd SDO or school implements the program as planned 
using the released funds from DBM.  

3. The DepEd SDO or school provides the Private Sector partner and 

DBM report on expenditures arising from the implementation of 

the program.

Overstatement 

Batanes In the implementation of the 2020 Brigada Eskwela Program, cash 

donations of ₱69,485.00 were sourced from various sources. Our further 

review disclosed that these donations were not recorded in the books. As 

required by the pertinent provisions in the GAM for NGAs and the related 

DepEd issuances, donations in cash and in kind shall be recorded for the 

fair presentation of the financial statements. 

(69,485.00) 

Management submitted to the Audit Team a report of disbursements from 

the cash donations for the relief and rehabilitation after the magnitude 5.9 

earthquake in Itbayat, Batanes on July 27, 2019. The Audit Team 

conducted an independent computation based on available records and 

noted that a total of ₱187,626.00 cash withdrawn from the personal 

account of the OIC-SDS cannot be accounted. Likewise, an amount of 

₱668.23 remains in the personal account of the OIC-SDS. In view of the 

unaccounted ₱187,626.00 and failure to transfer the ₱668.23 to the 

Agency’s bank account, the “Due from Officers and Employees” and 

“Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit)” accounts are understated by a total of 

₱188,294.23. 

(188,294.23) 

Total Understatement of Due from Officers and Employees Account (257,779.23) 

 

1.56 We recommended that Management: 
 

a) instruct the Adopt-A-School Program (ASP) School Coordinators or 
the concerned officials to submit the report on the disbursements of 

the cash donations duly supported by ORs and other appropriate 

documents, otherwise require the responsible persons to remit to the 

National Treasury the ₱69,485.00 and ₱187,626.00 donations. 

Henceforth, observe the procedures in accommodating and utilizing 

financial assistance as donation in accordance with Annex A of DepEd 

Order No. 24 s. 2016 dated April 25, 2016 and avoid accepting and 

utilizing cash donations without following the prescribed rules; 

 

b) cause the withdrawal from the personal account and remittance to the 
National Treasury of the remaining ₱668.23 and avoid using a 

personal account for cash transactions involving government funds; 

and  

 

c) pending the full accounting of the difference and the transfer of the 
balance from the personal account, instruct the Accountant to prepare 

a journal entry debiting “Due from Officers and Employees” and 

crediting “Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit)” with a total of ₱188,294.23. 

 

1.57 In its reply dated March 25, 2021 and received via e-mail on March 26, 2021, 
Management averred that upon validation of the records available and upon 

the scrutiny of the transactions of the personal bank account and upon the re-

computation of the actual amount of cash donations received, two deposit 



104 

 

transactions were accounted as additional cash donations, instead of deposits 

from the excess cash from the withdrawals, to wit;

Total 154,177.62 
Audited Difference 187,626.00 
Variance (33,448.38) 

 

1.58 Noticeably, as of October 9, 2019, there were no transactions of deposits to the 
bank account, thus the donation stopped from that date. The variance computed 

is also subject to review and reconciliation by the Management. The 

Management believes that no unaccounted cash donations occurred. (Details 

of re-computation to follow). Also, no JEV was recognized pending the result 

of reconciliation.

1.60 These were the only items in the report of disbursements with excess amounts 
between the withdrawals made and the amounts actually disbursed. The 

₱56,440.00 was properly deposited in the Trust Fund and recorded in the 

books. Thus, Management cannot claim now that the ₱154,177.62 represents 



105 

 

deposits from the excess cash from the withdrawals. No document was 

submitted to support the actual disbursements related to the said excess 

amount. We maintain our position that pending reconciliation, the total 

unreconciled amount shall be recorded as receivable to establish accountability 

especially, since these funds were not initially recorded in the books as 

government funds.

1.62 Section 7, Chapter 8 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, provides that “When 
inventories are sold, exchanged, or distributed, their carrying amount shall be 

recognized as an expense in the period in which the related revenue is 

recognized. If there is no related revenue, the expense is recognized when the 

goods are distributed or the related service is rendered.” 

 



106 

 

1.63 Moreover, Section 16 of the same Manual requires that the issuance of 
inventories to the end-user shall be supported with an RIS.  The RIS shall be 

summarized in the RSMI, which will be the basis of the Accountant in 

dropping the inventory from the books. 

 

1.64 Further, Annex 76 of GAM for NGAs, Volume II states that Property Transfer 
Report (PTR) shall be used when there are transfers of property from one 

Accountable Officer (AO)/Agency/Fund Cluster to another AO/Agency/Fund 

Cluster.  

 

1.65 The issuances and distributions of supplies and semi-expendable items to end-
users and recipient schools in CO and 12 ROs in an aggregate amount of 

₱12,715,350,211.42 remained unrecorded in the books. This was attributable 

to non-preparation and/or non-submission of Requisition and Issue Slip (RIS), 

Inventory and Custodian Slip (ICS) and Report of Supplies and Material Issued 

(RSMI) by the Property and/or Supply Division/Unit to the Accounting 

Division/Unit, which the latter uses as basis in preparing JEV to record the

1.66 It can also be gleaned from the above table that ₱12.22 billion of the noted 
misstatements was attributable to the non-recording of transferred centrally-



110 

 

procured inventory items to the recipient division offices and schools 

nationwide in the books of the CO. 

 

1.67 In effect, the related Inventories accounts and related Expenses and 
Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) accounts remained materially misstated, thus 

adversely affects the fair presentation of the FSs. 

 

1.68 We recommended that Management: 
 

a) instruct the Property/Supply Officer to immediately prepare and 
submit the RSMIs, together with the RIS, ICS and the transfer 

documents, to the Accounting Section as basis for recording the 

issuances and receipts of transferred inventories; 

 

b) require the Accountants to prepare journal entries to record as 
expenses the inventory items already issued/transferred based on the 

submitted RSMI/RIS/ICS by the Property/Supply Officer; and 

 

c) direct the Accountant and the Property/Supply Officer to regularly 
review and reconcile their records to establish the correct Inventory 

balances at any given time. 

 

1.69 The Management commented as follows: 
 

RO Management’s Comments 

CO Management has already prepared various JEVs in CY 2021 to adjust issuances 

of centrally-procured items totaling P2,505,342,742.79.  

 

AMD submits to Accounting Division Property Transfer Reports, delivery 

receipts of inventoryies and assets transferred to various offices to derecognize 

subject accounts and properly recorded in the books of accounts. The Logistic 

System is now being implemented to faciliate and monitor issuances of Inventory. 

 

Both the Accounting and Asset Management Divisions continue to make efforts 

in reconciling the subsidiary account balances of both offices for proper 

inventory management. A quarterly meeting is scheduled to monitor the same. 

CAR, II, III, IV-

B, VIII, XI  

The Management committed to adhere to the recommendations. 

II The Bookkeeper of Camalaniugan NHS and the Accountant of Claveria SAT 

have already prepared JEV Nos. 01-2021-02-0044 dated February 18, 2021 and 

01-2021-02-0057 dated February 26, 2021 to record the adjusting entries in the 

books. On the other hand, SDO Cauayan City already posted and recorded the 

adjusting entries per JEV No. 2021-03-00146 dated March 11, 2021. 

V Management commented that said textbooks were issued to the school teachers 

little by little by subject and by grade level, hence decided to effect the recordings 

in the books after all textbooks have been issued. 

VII Cebu Province Division. Management had taken actions on the 

recommendations. The Cashier prepared the RIS while the Property and Supply 

Officer prepared and submitted RSMI to the Accounting Unit. The OIC-

Accounting Division prepared JEV Nos. 01-2021-03-00351, 01-2021-03-00352, 

01-2021-03-00353 & 01-2021-03-00358 dated March 4, 2021 to adjust the 

Accountable Forms, Plates and Stickers Inventory account. 



111 

 

RO Management’s Comments 

X Management informed that the Supply Officer committed to enforce strict 

requirement to the end-users to reflect the date of receipt to all the issuance 

documents (RIS, ICS and PAR) they shall be signing. 

 

Management assured that the Division Office will faithfully implement and 

adhere to the laws and regulations applicable to financial transactions. 

 

1.70 The Audit Team advised the Accountant of Legazpi City to effect the 
recordings in the books every time there is issuance and/or RSMI is received 

from the Supply Officer. This practice ensures proper and updated records of 

the account and will not make it dormant. 

 

c.2 Unrecorded cost of inventories on hand and those received through 

transfers and donations 

 

1.71 Section 63 of PD No. 1445 provides that “Except as may otherwise be 
specifically provided by law or competent authority all moneys and property 

officially received by a public officer in any capacity or upon any occasion 

must be accounted for as government funds and government property. 

Government property shall be taken up in the books of the agency concerned 

at acquisition cost or an appraised value.” 

 

1.72 Section 21, Chapter 5 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, provides that transfers 
meet the definition of an asset when the entity controls the resources as a result 

of past event and expects to receive future economic benefits or service 

potential from those resources.  

 

1.73 In case of donation of assets without condition, the cost of asset acquired 
through donation without condition shall be taken up at its fair value at the date 

it is acquired. All expenses incurred in connection with the donated asset, such 

as delivery and installation costs, shall be included in the amount recognized 

as asset. 

 

1.74 Audit disclosed that various inventory items on hand and received by four ROs 
through transfers and donations with a total amount of ₱4,711,417.16 were not 

taken up in the books, hence understated the balance of Inventories account as 

at yearend as shown in the given table:

pertaining to all items transferred/donated and submit the same to the 

Accountant as basis in recognizing thereof in the books of accounts; 

and 

 

b) direct the Accountants to prepare adjusting entry to record the cost of 
inventories received through transfers and donations upon receipt of 

the necessary supporting documents.    

 

1.76 The Management of SDO Cagayan asserted that they have issued a 
memorandum dated March 16, 2021 addressed to School Principals/Heads for 

the submission of Inventory report on semi-expendable items together with the 

supporting documents such as Memorandum of Agreement, Memorandum of 

Understanding, Deed of Donation, Property Transfer Report, 

Acknowledgement Receipt of Property and any other documents as evidence 

of the donations. They assured that they will exert all efforts to have the 

inventory of donated semi-expendable properties and book the said properties 

once the sufficient documents for booking are received from the schools.

c.3 Non-existing and unidentified inventories included in the account 

 

1.77 It was revealed that the yearend balance of the Inventory accounts in three ROs 
includes non-existing and unidentified items with an aggregate amount of 

₱6,157,303.69, which consequently overstated the Inventory accounts by the 

same amount, details of which are shown below:

c.4 Undelivered items recorded in the inventory 
 

1.80 Both IPSAS No. 1 and Section 2(a), Chapter 2, of the GAM for NGAs, Volume 
I, define Accrual basis as basis of accounting under which transactions and 

other events are recognized when they occur (and not only when cash or its 

equivalent is received or paid). Therefore, the transactions and events are 

recognized in the accounting records and recognized in the financial 

statements of the periods to which they relate. The elements recognized under 

accrual accounting are assets, liabilities, net assets/equity, revenue, and 

expenses. 
 

1.81 Purchased supplies which are yet to be delivered were already recorded as 
inventory in five ROs, thereby overstating the Inventory accounts by

1.82 We recommended that Management: 
 

a) direct the Accountant to adjust the appropriate Inventory accounts 



115 

 

for the undelivered supplies to correct the overstatement in the books 

in order to present the financial statements conformably with the 

accrual basis of accounting as stated in IPSAS and GAM (NCR, ROs 

VI, VII, VIII and XIII); 

 

b) instruct the Accountant to refrain from making any advance payment 
for any undelivered items for purposes of avoiding the lapsing of NCA, 

which is not allowed under existing rules and regulations and make 

the necessary adjusting entry (NCR);  

 

c) direct the Division Accountant and Cashier to stop the practice of 
preparing Disbursement Vouchers and issuing checks, respectively, 

for the payment of suppliers before the completion of all supporting 

documents, especially if no deliveries had been made (RO VII); and  

 

d) send a follow-up letter to DBM-PS for the complete delivery of the 
lacking supplies. (RO VII) 

 

1.83 The Management of SDO of Talisay City agreed and will comply with the 
audit recommendations. The Division Accountant prepared JEV No. 2021-02-

260 dated February 26, 2021 to correct the overstatement of Office Supplies 

Inventory and to set up Due from NGAs (DBM-PS) account for the 

undelivered supplies from DBM-PS. 

 

c.5 Improper recording and classification of accounts 
 

1.84 Chapter 2 of GAM for NGAs, Volume III, provides the lists of accounts per RCA 
and the additional accounts prescribed under COA Circular No. 2014-003 

while Chapter 3 thereof contains the description of all the accounts in the list 

for proper account classification and presentation of financial transactions.  

 

1.85 Review of the Inventory accounts showed improper recording of transactions 
and classification of accounts in ROs II and VIII, which resulted in the 

understatement of the account by ₱4,682,314.27, as presented below:

in the illustrative accounting entries for granting and liquidation of advances 

wherein granting of cash advances is recorded under the appropriate Advances 

account. Upon the liquidation of Advances for Operating Expenses and 

Advances to Special Disbursing Officer, expenses are recognized while in 

Advances for Payroll, liability is diminished.  

 

1.90 Cash advances granted to AOs in the total amount of ₱21,196,979.57 were 
directly recorded as expenses in various schools in CAR. Details are shown 

below:

recognized as Expense instead of an Asset account, 

inconsistent with Section VI.B.33.4 of DepEd Order No. 

029 s. 2019 dated Oct 17, 2019. 

Total Understatement (21,196,979.57) 

 

1.91 The practice of recognizing cash advances directly as expenses upon grant 
casts doubt on the correctness of the recorded expenses, thus the related 

Advances accounts were understated and any remaining unliquidated portion 

of these cash advances as of yearend was not recognized. 

 

1.92 We recommended that Management require the Accountants/ 
Bookkeepers to record the granting of cash advances to their appropriate 

Advances accounts and recognize expenses only upon liquidation of the 

cash advances, and prepare the adjusting entries for the fair presentation 

of the Advances account in the financial statements.  

 

d.2 Unrecorded transactions affecting Advances accounts 

 

1.93 In SDO Samar, reconciliations were made per audit among the three sources 
of records of accountabilities: source documents, Agency’s SLs as well as 

Statement of Accountabilities as of October 24, 2017; all of which involving 

those of Mr. Cuenco’s  as Disbursing Officer. These were done after the 

retrieval of SLs from the Agency’s Accounting Unit that bear the signatures of 

Accountants which cover four audited funds such as: Advances for Payroll 

Fund, Advances to Special Disbursing Officer, Advances to Officers and 

Employees and Petty Cash Fund. 

 

1.94 However, upon examination, unrecorded transactions were found which are 
presented in the table below:

1.95 As shown, among other items needing adjustments, ₱41,679,184.56 
comprising of unrecorded transactions need to be deducted from the balances 

appearing per the audited SLs covering the three funds. 

 



119 

 

1.96 Whether recording per records was with omitted or erroneously posted items 
and regardless of amount, this misstatement put into question the reliability of 

financial records being the basis in determining the extent of accountabilities 

of any AO. 

 

1.97 We recommended that the Management instruct the Accountant to 
double check if transactions made were completely recorded in the GL/SL 

before printing and submitting the same to the Audit Team. Also, secure 

hard copies of the required journals and ledgers for monitoring purposes. 

 

1.98 Thus, Management comments are quoted hereunder:  
 

“The Accounting Office was not able to produce printed copies of SLs, 

General Ledgers (GLs) and Cash Disbursements Journals (CDJ) concerning 

the audited cash advances since there were no available data at hand for CYs 

2013-2015. The accounting system which is the Electronic Financial 

Reporting System (EFRS) was introduced in 2015 only and seemed to be a 

pilot launch only since it cannot totally and perfectly record all the data. There 

were several problems encountered especially on the capture, export and 

extraction of all the accounting data, hence it was not an ideal recording system 

yet and, unfortunately, the entire EFRS for 2015 was eventually corrupted. 

Moreover, records pertaining to previous years, prior to 2015, were likewise 

not maintained because it was damaged by typhoons. 

 

1.99 Despite the enumerated facts, the Accounting Department exerts effort in order 
to produce the required journals and ledgers. Starting this year, they will 

maintain hard copies of Cash Receipts Journal, Check Disbursements Journal, 

and General Journal to be updated monthly and will be turned over to the Audit 

Team within ten days after the end of each month, together with Trial Balances 

and interim financial statements. In addition, all documents will be scanned 

after settlement for proper storage and back-up purposes as this will be an 

integral part in retrieving and recovering previous files/documents. 

 

1.100 At present, CDJs and SLs pertaining to previous years could not be provided 
by the Accounting Department considering that those were handled by 

previous Accountants and there were no turned over documents for such data. 

We could only assure that present transactions will be recorded in the required 

reportorial documents and preparation of General Journals, Ledgers, etc. will 

be given priority above anything else and that it will be updated on a monthly 

basis. In addition, they have already assigned a staff to handle and focus on 

transactions pertaining to cash advances (CAs). 

 

1.101 As a mitigating measure, the Accounting Department will strictly observe 
Section 89 of PD No. 1445. In fact no additional CA is given to any 

official/employee unless the previous CA given to him is first settled or a 

proper accounting thereof is made, as reflected in various Division Memoranda 



120 

 

they issued. Also, the Accounting Department issues demand letters to those 

with unliquidated balances.” 

  

d.3 Erroneous recording affecting Advances accounts 

 

1.102 Chapter 3, Volume III of the GAM for NGAs provides the description of 
accounts in the financial statements, as follows: 

 

Advances for Operating Expenses – This account is used to recognize 

in the agency books the amount of advances granted to accountable 

officers for payment of operating expenses of operating/field units and 

foreign posts not maintaining complete set of books of accounts. Credit 

this account upon liquidation. 

 

Advances for Payroll – This account is used to recognize the amount 

granted to regular disbursing officers for payment of salaries, wages, 

honoraria, allowances and other personnel benefits. Credit this account 

upon liquidation. 

 

Advances to Officers and Employees - This account is used to 

recognize amount advanced to officers and employees for official 

travel. Credit this account for liquidation of advances 

 
1.103 The Accountants/Bookkeepers of the following SDOs/IUs made erroneous 

entries in CY 2020 affecting the Advances accounts, details of which are as 

follows:

were recorded to Other Payables account, thus the 

accountability for the liquidation of the said funds were 

not established, contrary to the above provisions of 

GAM. Furthermore, crediting Other Payables rendered 

the transaction to be treated as an outright expense. 

 

Since these disbursements were not recognized as 

advances, no liquidation was rendered by the 

accountable employees.

₱45,760.15, ₱34,415.66 and ₱69,860.00, respectively, or

accounts in the financial statements. 

150,035.81 

Total Net Understatement (1,170,204.88) 

 
1.104 We recommended that the Management prepare the necessary adjusting 

entry for the misstatement, supported with complete documents, in order 

to reflect the correct balance of the account, and observe the use of 

appropriate accounts in the recording of cash advances as prescribed in 

the Revised Chart of Accounts, Volume III of the GAM for NGAs.  

 

1.105 The Management’s comments and the corresponding Auditor’s rejoinder are 
as follows:

IUs in Dagupan

The Accountant, in his written reply, assured the Audit 

Team that for the succeeding releases of said funds, 

these will be taken up in the books in the account of 

Advances to Special Disbursing Officer in order to 

establish the accountability of the School Heads, being 

the persons accountable, to liquidate the same. 

 

SDO Cauayan 

City  

Management of SDO Cauayan City commented that 

the adjusting entries were already posted and recorded 

per JEV No. 2021-01-00119 dated January 29, 2021 

and JEV No. 2021-02-0028 dated February 16, 2021. 

Verification of the 

entries recorded 

revealed that they are 

correct and proper. 

 

d.4 Delayed/Late recording of liquidations of advances 

 

1.106 In the review of General Ledger (GL), the Audit Team of SDO of Quezon City 
noted that the liquidations for MOOE of Senior High Schools, monthly 

MOOE, and additional MOOE for CY 2020 of some Non-IUs were belatedly 

recorded in the books of accounts. Liquidations totaling ₱9,962,298.43 were 

recorded only in CY 2021 although the transactions occurred in CY 2020. This 

is contrary to the accrual basis of accounting wherein transactions should be 

recorded in the period when they occurred, rather than the period in which the 

cash flows related to them took place. 

 

1.107 We recommended that the Management of SDO of Quezon City ensure 
that liquidations are recorded in the period on which they actually 

occurred, rather than on the period in which the cash flows related to 

them occurred, in adherence to accrual basis of accounting. 

 

d.5 Adjustment made in the books without proper review, processing and 

approval of proper officials 

 

1.108 In SDO of Mandaluyong, it was noted that the Accountant made an adjusting 
entry in the total amount of ₱12,377,612.47 to record all the LRs received by 

the Accounting Department from the respective school bookkeepers. 

However, the said LRs were still in their custody subject to pre-audit and for 

approval and signature by the Schools Division Superintendent.  

 

1.109 Furthermore, the particulars or breakdowns of the total adjustments made were 
not indicated in the JEV for reference. The pre-audit and review were not yet 

conducted, but the JEV was already prepared to reduce the recorded CA 

balance. 

 

1.110 We recommended that the Management of SDO of Mandaluyong examine 
the completeness of the supporting documents before recording and 

approving the same and prepare the necessary adjusting entries to reflect 

the correct balance of Advances accounts. 

  



123 

 

d.6 Absence/incomplete submission of supporting documents or legal basis 

on unliquidated cash advances 

 

1.111 Analysis of transactions in SDO of Mandaluyong revealed that an adjustment 
amounting to ₱6,403,280.59 was made by the Accountant in the Advances to 

Officers and Employees account without complete supporting documents or 

legal basis, which resulted in the understatement of the Accumulated 

Surplus/(Deficit) and Advances to Officers and Employees accounts by the 

same amount.  

 

1.112 It has been existing in the books since CY 2010, and the proper accountability 
of the balance could no longer be established or determined due to absence or 

insufficient records. Hence, it was closed by the Accountant at yearend as 

evidenced by JEV No. 2566 dated December 31, 2020, without properly 

adhering to the specific guidelines and procedures prescribed under COA 

Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016. 

 

1.113 While in SDO of Kalinga, Advances for Operating Expenses amounting to 
₱3,216,732.16 were overstated due to unrecorded Cash Disbursements 

Register submitted by different schools, thus affecting the accuracy and 

validity of the affected accounts in the FSs. 

 

1.114 We recommended that the Management of SDO of Mandaluyong prepare 
journal entries to revert back to the appropriate Advances account the 

cash advances which were adjusted without proper documentation. 

Henceforth, adjust only the balance when proper write-off was made to 

the account and supported with complete documentation.  

 

1.115 We likewise recommended that the Management of SDO of Kalinga: 
 

a) submit a list of unrecorded liquidations for the Audit Team’s 
validation; 
 

b) prepare the necessary adjustment to reflect the correct amount of 
Advances for Operating Expenses; and 

 

c) strictly comply with the provision of Paragraph 27 of IPSAS 1 and 
Section 111(2) of PD No. 1445 in recording and keeping of accounts. 

 

d.7 Existence of negative balances and/or amount for adjustment 

 

1.116 Verification of records and prior years’ schedule in SDO of Taguig/Pateros 
disclosed a negative balance totaling ₱3,213,872.61, which reduced the 

Advances to Officers and Employees account balance by 33 percent and 

affected the fair presentation of the accounts in the FSs. The negative balances 



124 

 

resulted from the various errors and omissions in recording transactions on the 

CAs from CYs 2012 to 2020.  

 

1.117 Moreover, the Accounting Unit failed to prepare an individual SL of each AO 
that could have been a useful tool in identifying each CA that was still 

outstanding in the records. 

 

1.118 We recommended that the Management of SDO of Taguig/Pateros 
require the Accountant to analyze all the negative balances of 

accountabilities of AOs and prepare necessary adjusting journal entries 

to correct the affected accounts and monitor the granting and liquidations 

of CAs through the maintenance of updated SLs and systematic record-

keeping to ensure immediate liquidation thereof and proper recording to 

prevent errors and negative balances. 

 

1.119 The Management of SDO of Taguig/Pateros commented that the initial 
analysis of SL  revealed the following: 

 

a. In previous years, only a few officers and personnel were applied for 
fidelity bond. This resulted in the early practice of granting CA to a Special 

Disbursing Officer rather than to the program proponent because the latter 

was not yet bonded. Due to lack of personnel to handle the SL for 

Advances to Officers and Employees, the recording of LRs   was not 

properly monitored. 

 

b. The recorded purpose for the grant of CA was different from the purpose 
indicated in the LR. This was due to the changes/cancellation of the 

previous PAPs for which the CA was granted. Instead of requesting for 

another CA, the proponent opted to utilize the received fund for another 

PAP. 

 

c. There were instances that the amount indicated in the LR was greater than 
the amount of CA. 

 

d. The negative balances were liquidations of valid CAs granted in previous 
years that were included in the beginning balance of ₱9,091,089.74 in CY 

2014. However, the composition/details of which cannot be accurately 

ascertained due to the unavailability of EFRS/ similar data for CY 2013 

and earlier years. 

 

e. The reconstruction of SL takes some time because each negative balance 
has to be matched with the corresponding grant of CA. 

 

1.120 The ongoing updating/reconciliation of the SLs requires much time and 
meticulous and painstaking effort. Nevertheless, continued conscientious 



125 

 

endeavor will be exerted in order to prepare necessary adjusting journal entries 

to correct the affected accounts. 

 

1.121 Continuous efforts are employed to come up with systematic record-keeping 
to ensure proper recording to monitor immediate liquidation and to prevent 

errors and negative balances. 

 

d.8 Erroneous recording of liquidation and collection of excess/unused cash 

advances 

 

1.122 Verification of entries made and validation of related reports revealed that the 
SDO Taguig/Pateros Bookkeeper committed errors in recording twice the 

liquidations and collection of excess/unused cash advances, thus resulting in 

the understatement of the Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) and Advances to 

Officers and Employees accounts by ₱92,868.91.  

 

1.123 We recommended that the Management of SDO of Taguig/Pateros make 
the necessary adjusting entries to correct the errors in recording. 

 

1.124 The Management of SDO of Taguig/Pateros commented that the noted 
erroneous recordings of liquidation and collection of excess/unused cash 

advances in the books amounting to ₱92,868.91 are appropriately corrected as 

evidenced by JEV Nos. 2021-02-428 to 431 dated February 26, 2021 and JEV 

Nos. 2021-03-648 to 649 dated March 19, 2021. 

 

d.9 Payment of Prepaid Insurance was directly recorded as expense 

 

1.125 Paragraph 7 of IPSAS 1 defines accrual basis as a basis of accounting under 
which transactions and other events are recognized when they occur (and not 

only when cash or its equivalent is received or paid). Therefore, the 

transactions and events are recognized in the financial statements of the 

periods to which they relate. The elements recognized under accrual 

accounting are assets, liabilities, net assets/equity, revenue and expenses. 

 

1.126 Likewise, Section 6(b), Chapter 2 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, states that 
each entity shall recognize and present its financial transactions and operations 

conformably to the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with the IPSAS. 

 

1.127 Audit showed that SDOs of Bislig City, Surigao del Sur and Tandag City used 
the Expense Method in recognizing payments for insurance during the year. 

Upon payment, the whole amount of the insurance premium was treated as an 

outright expense. However, there was no adjustment made at yearend to 

recognize the unexpired portions thereof using the straight-line method. The 

non-recognition of the unexpired portion of the insurance paid resulted in the 

understatement of the Prepaid Insurance and overstatement of Insurance 

Expense account by ₱94,451.37. 



126 

 

 

1.128 We recommended, and Management agreed, to direct the Accountant to 
prepare the necessary adjusting entry in recognizing the unexpired 

portion of the insurance for building and motor vehicle by debiting 

Prepaid Insurance and crediting Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) for the 

amount of unexpired portion to properly report the affected account 

balances in the quarterly financial statements of the ensuing quarters. 

Henceforth, ensure that all prepayments are initially recognized as an 

asset upon payment, which shall be adjusted at the end of the year to 

recognize the expenses applicable to the period being reported.

d. the asset is used to achieve government objectives; and  
e. it meets the capitalization threshold of ₱15,000. 

 

1.131 Section 63 of PD No. 1445 states that “Except as may otherwise be specifically 
provided by law or competent authority, all moneys and property officially 

received by a public officer in any capacity or upon any occasion must be 

accounted for as government funds and government property. Government 

property shall be taken up in the books of the agency concerned at acquisition 

cost or an appraised value.” 

 

1.132 Section 20, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, provides that 
deliveries of PPE shall be recorded immediately in the Property Card (PC) 

maintained by the Supply and/or Property Division/Unit on the basis of the 

Inspection and Acceptance Report (IAR) and other supporting documents. The 

IAR and other supporting documents shall be forwarded to the Accounting 

Division/Unit for the recording of deliveries in the books of account through 

JEV and in the Property, Plant and Equipment Ledger Card (PPELC). Based 

on the IAR and other supporting documents, the Supply and/or Property 

Division/Unit shall prepare the DV and submit to the Accounting 

Division/Unit for the processing of payment. 

 

1.133 Various equipment such as office, medical, dental and laboratory, and 
information and communications technology equipment, motor vehicles and 

furniture and fixtures acquired by the Agency over the years totaling 

₱291,423,029.03 were not recorded in the books of accounts of the DepEd, 

resulting in the understatement of PPE account, details are presented below:

1.134 We recommended, and the Management agreed, to recognize the cost of 
PPE items that were already delivered but remained unrecorded as of 

report date and ensure that assets are recorded in the books upon their 

delivery to the Agency. 

 

e.2 Unrecorded cost of completed buildings transferred by the DPWH 

 

1.135 Pursuant to the Special Provisions of the GAA for FY 2019 and as provided 
for in the Revised Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) dated April 3, 2017 

entered into by and between the DepEd and the Department of Public Works 

and Highways (DPWH), the construction of school buildings under the BEFF 

shall be implemented by the latter. 

 

1.136 Section II.7 of the Revised MOA provides that the DepEd Division 
Accountants shall record in the Agency’s books the accepted and completed 



129 

 

school building projects from the DPWH thru the submission of JEV from the 

DPWH District Engineering Office Accountant.  

 

1.137 Section 15, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, provides the 
guidelines and procedures for the inter-agency transfer of PPE. It provides that 

transfer from one government entity to another shall be recognized by the 

recipient entity at net carrying value. The transferor shall derecognize the PPE 

account upon transfer. 

 

1.138 Validation disclosed that completed school buildings and other structures 
totaling ₱6,926,289,151.51 were not yet recorded in the books of the respective 

SDOs of the following ROs, thus understating the related PPE accounts, as 

follows:

1.139 We recommended, and the Management agreed, to recognize in the books 

the cost of completed school buildings and other structures already 

transferred by DPWH and provide depreciation thereon. 

 

e.3 Unrecorded PPE with beneficial ownership and control but without 

proof of ownership 

 

1.140 Section 39 of PD No. 1445. Submission of papers relative to government 
obligations. 

 

(1) The Commission shall have the power, for purposes of inspection, to 

require the submission of the original of any order, deed, contract, or 

other document under which any collection of, or payment from, 

government funds may be made, together with any certificate, receipt, or 

other evidence in connection therewith. If an authenticated copy is 

needed for record purposes, the copy shall upon demand be furnished. 



130 

 

 

(2) In the case of deeds to property purchased by any government agency, 

the Commission shall require a certificate of title entered in favor of the 

government or other evidence satisfactory to it that the title is in the 

government. 

 

(3) It shall be the duty of the officials or employees concerned, including 

those in non-government entities under audit, or affected in the audit of 

government and non-government entities, to comply promptly with these 

requirements. Failure or refusal to do so without justifiable cause shall 

constitute a ground for administrative disciplinary action as well as for 

disallowing permanently a claim under examination, assessing additional 

levy or government share, or withholding or withdrawing government 

funding or donations through the government. 

 

1.141 Section 63 of the same PD on Accounting for moneys and property received 
by public officials, states: 

 

Except as may otherwise be specifically provided by law or competent 

authority all moneys and property officially received by a public officer 

in any capacity or upon any occasion must be accounted for as 

government funds and government property. Government property shall 

be taken up in the books of the agency concerned at acquisition cost or 

an appraised value. 

 

1.142 Section 3 (c), Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs relating to the 
criteria for recognition provides that the cost of an item of PPE shall be 

recognized as assets if, and only if, the beneficial ownership and control clearly 

rest with the government. 

 

1.143 Validation of the accounts in Regions II and VII revealed unrecorded PPE 
accounts with beneficial control but without proof of ownership, as shown 

below:

VIII Samar Land 124,319,525.62 

 Total  126,134,525.62 

 

1.144 Likewise, in RO I, it was noted that a number of parcels of land, which are 
apparently owned by the respective schools under the jurisdiction of SDO 

Pangasinan I and 19 IUs, considering that their respective school buildings and 

other permanent structures were built therein, lacked the necessary 

documentary evidences that would prove ownership such as Certificate of 

Title, Deed, Tax Declaration or any other documents of the same import 



131 

 

bearing the name of owner/claimant. Likewise, in Candon City, parcels of 

lands were acquired through donations were not recognized in the books. 

 

1.145 Similarly, in Regions VI, and VII, accounts Land and Building, School 
Buildings have not been recorded in their books of accounts. It was noted that 

there were no records or documents to show ownership such as certificate or 

titles of ownership duly registered with the Register of Deeds.  On the other 

hand, School Buildings constructed by the DPWH or by the LGU of 

undetermined amount remained unbooked due to transfer documents. 

 

e.4 Recorded property without beneficial ownership 

 

1.146 Section 658 of P.D. No. 1445 provides that “the examination and audit of 
assets shall be performed with a view to ascertaining their existence, 

ownership, valuation and encumbrances as well as the propriety of items 

composing the respective asset accounts, determining their agreement with 

records; ascertaining if the assets were utilized economically, efficiently and 

effectively; and evaluating the adequacy of controls over the accounts. 

 

1.147 In six ROs, it was noted that recorded property did not show beneficial 
ownership rendering the accounts doubtful:

1.148 We recommended to the Management that: 
 

a) for the parcels of land which are not yet registered in the name of the 
DepEd/School, cause the immediate transfer of the titles of the land in 

the name of the DepEd/School to acquire absolute ownership over the 

lot or cause the annotation at the back of the title of the lot with the 

Registry of Deeds to claim ownership on the portion of the land 

donated pending the completion of titling thereof; and 

 

b) the Head of the Offices concerned secure all necessary documents of 
ownership of land occupied by the schools and/or offices to facilitate 

recognition in their respective books. 



132 

 

 

e.5 Non-derecognition of unserviceable, lost and damaged assets 

 

1.149 Section 79 of PD No. 1445 provides that “When government property has 
become unserviceable for any cause, or is no longer needed, it shall, upon 

application of the officer accountable therefor, be inspected by the head of the 

agency or his duly authorized representative in the presence of the auditor 

concerned and, if found to be valueless or unsalable, it may be destroyed in 

their presence. If found to be valuable, it may be sold at public auction to the 

highest bidder under the supervision of the proper committee on award or 

similar body in the presence of the auditor concerned or other duly authorized 

representative of the Commission, after advertising by printed notice in the 

Official Gazette, for not less than three consecutive days in any newspaper of 

general circulation, or where the value of the property does not warrant the 

expense of publication, by notices posted for like period in at least three public 

places in the locality where the property is to be sold. In the event that the 

public auction fails, the property may be sold at a private sale at such price as 

may be fixed by the same committee or body concerned and approved by the 

Commission.” 

 

1.150 The following ROs have assets which were already evaluated by the SDOs and 
Schools as unserviceable or beyond economic repair that still remained in the 

books and not disposed, which resulted in the overstatement of the PPE 

accounts:

1.151 In Region XIII, unserviceable properties of the Division Offices of Bislig City, 
Surigao del Sur and six Implementing Units remained undisposed and were 

allowed to further deteriorate and have consumed an amount of space in the 

office premises. 

 

 

 

 



133 

 

1.152 We recommended that Management:  
 

a) require the Property/Supply Officers to prepare the necessary report 
using the Inventory and Inspection Report for Unserviceable Property 

(IIRUP) Form as prescribed in Appendix 74, Volume II of the GAM, 

for proper disposal and basis to derecognize from the books the 

unserviceable properties carried in the PPE accounts; 

 

b) prepare a letter-request addressed to the Office of the COA Audit 
Team Leader for the inspection of unserviceable properties subject to 

disposal; and 

 

c) require the Accountant/Bookkeepers to prepare JEV to derecognize 
the asset from the books of accounts after its disposal. 

 

e.6 Erroneous and non-provision of depreciation  

 

1.153 Section 27, Chapter 10, Volume 1 of GAM provides that “PPE gradually loses 
its ability to provide service over the course of time. Because of this, its cost 

needs to be distributed on a systematic basis over its useful life. The allocated 

cost is referred to as depreciation. The depreciation charge for each period 

shall be recognized as expense unless it is included in the carrying amount of 

another asset.” 

 

1.154 Paragraph 71 of PPSAS 17 further provides that “Depreciation of an asset 
begins when it is available for use, i.e., when it is in the location and condition 

necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by 

management.” 

 

1.155 Based on the analysis and recomputation performed by the Audit Teams, the 
amount of Accumulated Depreciation recognized in the books was understated 

by a total amount of ₱250,780,736.38, which consequently overstated the 

carrying amount of the affected PPE accounts by the same amount, broken 

down as follows:

1.156 Records disclosed that the common causes of the understatement in 

Accumulated Depreciation were due to the following: 

 

a. Failure of the Accountant to provide depreciation of PPE immediately from 
the acquisition date to the recording date in the books; 

 

b. Erroneous/miscomputation of depreciation; and 
 

c. Change of accounting estimate for residual value of PPE from 10 to five 
percent as adopted under GAM. 

 



135 

 

1.157 We recommended that Management require the Accountants to compute 
the Accumulated Depreciation for all depreciable assets, and henceforth, 

adjust the recording thereof in the books, and regularly compute and 

provide depreciation therefor; and prepare lapsing schedule and maintain 

SLs to facilitate monitoring. 

 

e.7 Non-reclassification of cost of completed projects from CIP to the 

appropriate asset accounts 

 

1.158 Section 8(g), Chapter 10, Volume I of GAM for NGAs provides that “During 
construction period, all expenses incurred in relation to the construction of the 

PPE shall be taken up in the books as Construction in Progress (CIP) with the 

appropriate asset classification. As soon as the construction is completed, the 

CIP account shall be reclassified to the proper asset account. x x x” 

 

1.159 The reported balance of CIP accounts of the following DepEd ROs still 
includes the cost of completed construction and repair/rehabilitation projects 

on school buildings and other structures totaling ₱911,987,910.40 which 

should have been reclassified or transferred to the appropriate asset accounts, 

thus understating the School Buildings account. Details are shown below:

1.161 Section 4, Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs provides the following: 

 
The capitalization threshold of ₱15,000 represents the minimum cost of 

an individual asset recognized as a PPE on the Statement of Financial 

Position. 
 

a. Items with individual values below the threshold but which work 
together in the form of a group of network asset whose total value 

exceeds the threshold shall be recognized as part of the primary PPE. 

(Example: computer network, PABX system, sewerage system). 

 

b. Expenditures incurred on purchasing, developing, and operating 
hardware, like web servers, staging servers, production servers and 

internet connections of a website is accounted for as PPE if the total 

value of the primary asset (communications networks) and these 

items is within the threshold of ₱15,000 and above. 

 

c. This threshold shall be applied on an individual asset or per item 
basis. Each item within the bulk acquisition with aggregate or total 

value of PPE, such as library books, computer peripherals and small 

items of equipment, will need to meet the capitalization threshold to 

be recognized as PPE. 
 

1.162 As observed by the Audit Teams, ₱40,558,774.89 worth of semi-expendable 
items were erroneously recorded as PPE, instead of inventory, resulting in the 

overstatement of PPE account. Details are shown below:

1.163 We recommended that the Management require the Accountants to 
prepare adjusting entries to reclassify all items costing below the 

capitalization threshold of ₱15,000.00 to appropriate inventory account. 

For items that had been issued to end-users, debit appropriate Semi-

Expendable Expenses account, if issued in the current year, or 

Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) account, if issued in prior years.

1.164 The Revised Chart of Accounts provides the list and description of all accounts 
to be used by NGAs. The objective of RCA is to provide uniform accounts for 

national government accounting and budget systems to facilitate the 

preparation of harmonized financial and budgetary accountability reports and 

ensure comparability of financial information. 

 

1.165 During the year, the Audit Teams noted erroneous journal entries in 11 ROs 
that resulted in net overstatement of PPE accounts by ₱8,623,399,067.19, as

OTHER NON-CURRENT ASSETS 

 

f.) Erroneous reclassification of fully depreciated property and equipment to 

Other Assets account – P877,574.90 

 

1.168 Chapter 3, Volume III of the GAM for NGAs prescribes Other Assets account 
to assets not falling under any of the specific assets account. A credit is made 

to this account for disposal or reclassification to specific assets account. 

 

1.169 Analysis of the Other Assets account of Canda NHS, Infanta NHS, Lutucan 
NHS, Paaralang Sekundarya ng Lucban, and San Isidro NHS under SDO of 

Quezon Province – RO No. IV-A, disclosed that the balance amounting to 

₱877,574.90 consists of the carrying amount of fully depreciated property and 

equipment, which were reclassified to Other Assets account in CY 2016 

because these were all fully depreciated. 

 

1.170 It should be noted that these items belong to specific assets 
classification/account, thus should not be categorized as Other Assets. 

 

1.171 We recommended that Management: 
 

a) require the Senior Bookkeeper to make the necessary entry from 
Other Assets to the appropriate PPE accounts as well as the restitution 

of accumulated depreciation to rectify/correct the affected PPE 

account balances;  

 

b) require the Property Officer to report in the Inventory and Inspection 
Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) the unserviceable property 

and drop from the books after disposal;  

 

c) instruct the Senior Bookkeeper to observe the prescribed accounting 
treatment for fully depreciated PPE and proper usage of Other Assets 

account for a fair presentation of the accounts in the financial 

statements; and 

 

d) require the Bookkeeper to establish the details of the Other Assets 
account balances and make the necessary adjusting entry from Other 

Assets account to the appropriate PPE accounts as well as the 

restitution of accumulated depreciation to rectify/correct the affected 

PPE account balances.

1.172 The Management’s comments and the corresponding Auditor’s rejoinder are

The School Heads of five 

Implementing Units concurred 

with the audit observation, 

while the Bookkeepers have 

agreed to adjust/ reclassify the 

Other Assets account to the 

corresponding asset accounts.    

It is worthy to mention that 

Management of five 

Implementing Units agreed to 

comply with the audit 

recommendations.

1.174 Audit of the Liabilities accounts balances of DepEd CO, ROPs and its SDOs 
revealed the following deficiencies: 

 

g.1 Obligations for goods and services that were not yet delivered or rendered 

were recorded as Accounts Payable 

 

1.175 The financial reporting system of the national government follows the accrual 
basis of accounting. This is a basis of accounting under which transactions and 

other events are recognized when they occur (and not only when cash or its 

equivalent is received or paid). Therefore, the transactions and events are 

recognized in the accounting records and recognized in the financial 

statements on the periods to which they relate. 
 

1.176 Additionally, Section 2.a, Chapter 6, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs defines 
Accounts Payable as valid and legal obligations of NGAs/OUs, for which, 

goods/services/projects have been delivered/rendered/completed and 

accepted, regardless of the year when these obligations were incurred. 

 

1.177 For the year then ended, ₱94,706,027.45 worth of goods and services that were 
not yet delivered or rendered were recorded as Accounts Payable in six ROs, 

contrary to accrual basis of accounting. Details are shown below:

rendered/completed as of December 31, 2020, thus considered as not yet 

due and demandable obligations. 

 

While in SDO Mandaluyong, result of validation of relevant documents 

and inquiries made with the BAC Secretariat on the status of the delivery 

and completion of the reported claims revealed that a total of 

₱5,568,892.97 worth of goods and services were recorded as Accounts

up accounts payable (credit), and debit-CIP. This is contrary to item 6 

(6.1.2) of the DBM Circular Letter No. 2013-16 since the projects have 

not yet commenced; and no billing statement/request for payment have 

been received by the Agency and no billing statement/request for 

payment has been received by the Agency.  

XI-ROP, Digos 

City, Tagum City,

68,420,269.49 Various obligations amounting to P68,420,269.49 of DepEd Region XI, 

Division Offices and IUs-Digos City, Tagum City and IGACOS, that 

were not yet due and demandable were already recognized as payables 

despite the absence or proofs of actual delivery or rendered service, thus 

resulting in the overstatement of the Accounts Payable account balances 

at yearend by the same amounts, contrary to Sec. 37 of Chapter 2 of 

GAM, Volume II and Section 111 of PD No. 1445. 

XIII-Bislig City, 

Surigao del Sur, and 

Tandag City 

1,253,741.21 Examination of the pertinent Obligation Requests and Status (ORS) 

maintained by the budget personnel of Division Offices of Bislig City, 

Surigao del Sur and Tandag City disclosed that the Delivery Receipts 

(DRs) and Inspection and Acceptance Reports (IARs) were either not 

attached to the ORS or were dated after December 31, 2020. Thus, these 

obligations were not yet due and demandable as of yearend as the 

corresponding goods and services have not yet been delivered/rendered 

by the suppliers/contractors. Nonetheless, these were recorded as 

Accounts Payable in the books of accounts. Without delivery of the 

goods covered by the ORS, such obligations are not valid to be recorded 

as a liability in the financial statements. The foregoing deficiency was 

due to the inadvertent recording by the Accounting personnel. 

Consequently, the Accounts Payable and the other affected accounts 

were overstated by ₱1,253,741.21. 

XIII-Agusan del Sur 

and Bayugan City 

15,602,804.95 Verification of the related Journals of the Division of Agusan del Sur 

revealed recording/booking of unreleased cash advances of 133 SHs 

totaling ₱15,522,422.22 at yearend by debiting various expense 

accounts and crediting the Due to Officers and Employees account even 

without incurrence of valid liabilities, such as, actual delivery of goods 

and rendering of services have not yet been made. This condition 

resulted in overstating the Due to Officers and Employees by 

₱15,522,422.22 and overstating various Expense accounts. Likewise, 

payables without valid obligations totaling ₱80,382.00 were recorded as 

Accounts Payable in the Division of Bayugan City which overstated the 

said account by the same amount. 

Total 94,706,027.45  



145 

 

 

1.178 We recommended that Management instruct the Accountants to record a 
liability in the books of accounts only when the obligations become due 

and demandable, that is, when goods are delivered and services are 

rendered. 

 

g.2 Recognition of claims with incomplete supporting documents 

 

1.179 Section 46 of PD No. 1177 provides the general guidelines on the certification 
of availability of funds, as follows: 

 
No obligation shall be certified to accounts payable unless the obligation is 

founded on a valid claim that is properly supported by sufficient evidence and 

unless there is proper authority for its incurrence. Any certification for a 

nonexistent or fictitious obligation and/or creditor shall be considered void. The 

certifying official shall be dismissed from the service, without prejudice to 

criminal prosecution under the provisions of the Revised Penal Code. Any 

payment made under such certification shall be illegal and every official 

authorizing or making such payment, or taking part therein or receiving such 

payment, shall be jointly and severally liable to the government for the full 

amount so paid or received. 

 

1.180 Appendix 6 – Instructions, Volume II of GAM for NGAs states that the SL 
shows detail for each control account in the GL, which is maintained per 

account and fund cluster by the Accounting Division/Unit. 

 

1.181 Based on validation conducted by the Audit Teams in three ROs, a total of  
₱8,807,711.11 represents claims recognized as payables even if undocumented 

or supporting documents were incomplete, resulting in the overstatement of 

Liability accounts. Details are shown below:

of Department of Budget and Management Circular Letter No. 2018-14 dated 

December 28, 2018 and Section 264 (a) of the National Internal Revenue 

Code of 1997.

1.182 We recommended that Management submit to the concerned COA Office 
the lacking supporting documents to substantiate the obligations/payables 

recognized as at December 31, 2020. 

 

g.3 Non-reversion of long outstanding/undocumented payables aged two 

years and above 
 

1.183 Section 98 of PD No. 1445 provides for the reversion of unliquidated balances 
of accounts payable, which states that “The Commission, upon notice to the 

head of agency concerned, may revert to the unappropriated surplus of the 

general fund of the national government, any unliquidated balance of accounts 

payable in the books of the national government, which has been outstanding 

for two years or more and against which no actual claim, administrative or 

judicial, has been filed or which is not covered by perfected contracts on 

record. 

 

1.184 Sections 1 and 2 of EO No. 87 require that: 
 

Section 1 - Reversion of Undocumented Accounts Payable. All documented 

accounts payable for fiscal year 2016 and years prior thereto shall be reverted 

to the Accumulated Surplus or Deficit of the General Fund, or Cumulative 

Result of Operations of the National Government.  Henceforth, all documented 

accounts payable which remain outstanding for at least two years, for which no 

actual administrative or judicial claim has been filed, shall be subject to 

automatic reversion. 

 
Section 2 - Treatment of Undocumented Accounts Payable. All accounts 

payable which are undocumented or not covered by perfected contracts on 

record, regardless of the year in which they were incurred, shall automatically 

be reverted. The recording of undocumented accounts payable in the books of 

accounts of agencies shall be strictly prohibited. 
 

1.185 Based on audit, a total of ₱222,055,899.15 represents long 
outstanding/dormant/undocumented payables aged two years and above that 

remains unreverted, thus overstating the Liabilities account. Details are shown 

below:

filed their claims against the DepEd-CO. There were also some creditors who 

were already issued several checks, however, the checks issued became stale 

since the claimants failed to encash the same within the period of three 

months. Likewise, there were also payments to suppliers thru LDDAP-ADA 

which were invalidated by the bank due to incorrect bank account details.

10,084,609.36 Verification of the Other Payables accounts revealed that the total amount of 

₱10,084,609.36 could not be supported with a schedule, hence no valid 

claimant and supporting documents were submitted to support the amount 

recorded in the books. It is also noted that there are variances between the 

schedule of the Other Payables account and the amount recorded in the books 

This account has remained dormant since CY 2016 or more than four years 

now. 

II-Isabela 4,880.69 Review of the Other Payables account as of December 31, 2020 of the SDO 

of Isabela showed an amount of ₱4,880.69, which has been outstanding for 

more than two years and has no supporting documents. This amount was 

carried forward only from the CY 2018 financial statements of the previous 

Accountant and no documents were turned over to support the payable. 

III-Angeles City 279,397.68 Our audit of the Liability accounts of SDOs of Angeles and Cabanatuan 

Cities disclosed that the payable accounts include past due accounts and 

payable accounts without valid claims and supporting documents.

Province 

13,503,378.24 As already noted in audit in CY 2019, the balance of P43,195,921.05 was not 

supported with documentation. This audit observation was included in the 

CY 2019 Management Letter for which we recommended to revert to the 

Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) the whole amount. 

 

Since only the amount of P29,692,542.80 from 2018 Payables – Due to 

Officers and employees was reverted, the balance of P13,503,378.24 which 

was not yet reverted was already two years as of end of CY 2020. 

IV-B-ROP 2,990,289.14 Trust liabilities from receipt of bid security and performance bond and 

retention of fees from contractors and suppliers remained outstanding for 

over two years and for which no actual claim for refund has been filed. 

VIII-ROP 3,632,711.82 Verification disclosed that Management still omitted the reversion of 

undocumented and long outstanding payables to the Accumulated Surplus of 

the national government totaling ₱3,632,711.82. 

XIII-Bayugan City 170,093.26 Scrutiny and evaluation of the Schedule of Accounts Payable of the Bayugan 

City Division Office revealed that a total of ₱170,093.26 was outstanding for 

more than two years wherein the related payables either pertained to 

discontinued contract without administrative or judicial claim filed by the 

contractor or without valid obligations.  Failure to revert the said Accounts 

Payable amounting to ₱170,093.26 to the Accumulated Surplus/Deficit is 

inconsistent with EO No. 87, thus rendering the said account unreliable. 

Total 222,055,899.15  

 

1.186 We recommended that Management require the Accountant to exert 
effort to validate the recorded obligations in prior years and revert all 

long outstanding payables to the Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) account 

to reflect the correct balance of the Accounts Payable of the Agency. 

 

g.4 Inclusion of claims already paid during the year 

 

1.187 In DepEd CO, validation showed that some creditors were paid debiting the 
Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) account instead of A/Ps, hence the balance 

remained outstanding at yearend amounting to ₱117,773.42. 

 

1.188 While in NCR, result of validation of SL of SDO of Taguig/Pateros disclosed 
that a claim amounting to ₱348,520.00 was already paid in CY 2018 but was 

still included in the Accounts Payable account balance at yearend. Moreover, 



148 

 

based on the validation conducted by the Audit Team in SDO of Mandaluyong, 

a total of ₱1,934,292.75 claims recognized as payables were already paid 

during the year but were still included in the Accounts Payable account balance 

at yearend, thus resulted in the overstatement of the account in the same 

amount. 

 

1.189 We recommended that Management perform account analysis and 
prepare the necessary adjusting entries to reflect the accurate balances of 

the affected accounts for fair presentation in the financial statements. 

 

g.5 Unreleased commercial check at yearend not reverted to the payable 

account 

 

1.190 Section 56, Chapter 19, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs provides that: 
 

A Schedule of Unreleased Commercial Checks shall be prepared by the 

Cashier for submission to the Accounting Division/Unit. All unreleased 

checks at the end of the year shall be reverted back to the cash accounts. 

A JEV shall be prepared to recognize the restoration of the cash 

equivalent to the unreleased checks and the recognition of the appropriate 

liability/payable account. The accounting entry for the restoration of the 

unreleased check to the cash account shall be a debit to “Cash in Bank, 

Local Currency Current” account with credit to the appropriate liability 

account. There shall be no physical cancellation of the checks. The JEV 

supporting such restoration shall form part of the supporting document 

to the financial statements to be submitted to COA at yearend. At the start 

of the ensuing year, another JEV shall be drawn to reverse the previous 

entry made and recognize the availability of the checks for release. This 

procedure shall not apply to account “Cash-Modified Disbursement 

System (MDS)” since there is no actual cash with the GSBs. 

 

1.191 In DepEd CO, ROP and Baguio City NHS of CAR, and SDO Batanes of RO 
II, unreleased commercial checks at yearend amounting to ₱186,901.97, 

₱56,550,162.69, and ₱1,920.00, respectively, or a total of ₱56,361,340.72 

were not reverted back to the Cash account at yearend, hence understating both 

the appropriate Cash and Liabilities accounts. 

 

1.192 We recommended that Management require the Accountants to ensure 
that adjusting journal entries to revert to Cash and appropriate Liability 

accounts the amount of unreleased checks are properly made at yearend. 
 

g.6 Failure to set up liability for the payments made to teaching and non-

teaching personnel 

 

1.193 In SDO-Quezon City of NCR, payment was made for the January 2020 salaries 
and differential of the SDO, Elementary School and Senior High School 



149 

 

teaching and non-teaching personnel without setting up the liability account. 

Hence, the non-setting up of liability for the salaries and deductions before 

payment or by directly debiting the Due to Officers and Employees account 

understated the account as well as the Salaries and Wages account by 

₱123,318,630.48. 

 

1.194 We recommended that Management conduct a careful and thorough 
review of the accounts before consolidation to ensure the completeness 

and accuracy of the consolidated balances of the accounts presented in the 

financial statements. 

 

g.7 Non-inclusion of balance in the FS 

 

1.195 Audit revealed that balances of liabilities in three ROs were not included in the 
FS, including a negative (debit) balances, thus causing net overstatement in the 

liability account as at yearend. Details are as follows:

total amount of ₱765,876.73. Moreover, the Due to BIR account 

with a negative (debit) balance of ₱2,113,389.22 as of December

Award for CYs 2019 and 2020 in the amount of ₱420,000.00

could have been avoided had the Accounting Unit 

thoroughly reviewed/analyzed the details of the 

remittances of taxes made during the said periods. 

NCR-ROP (1,114.21) Understatement amounting to ₱1,114.21 was due 

to inappropriate adjustment made under JEV No.

showed that the account Due to BIR (20201010) 

was debited with the remittance of December 

2020 withheld taxes. However, validation of the 

TRAs revealed that it had been the practice of the 

DO Accounting Unit and the eight IUs to record 

the constructive receipt of NCA for TRA and the 

remittance of taxes withheld immediately on the 

last day of the remittance month when in fact, the 

filing of tax returns, constructive receipt of NCA 

for TRA and remittance of taxes withheld, all 

ensued on the succeeding month. 

 

The erroneous recording of the receipt of TRA 

and tax remittance resulted in consolidated 

understatement of the account Due to BIR

balance in the financial statements, the above 

entry was resorted to. As such, the balance as of 

June 30, 2018 no longer existed because it was 

reclassified as Due from GOCCs, which until the 

current year still remained.

and Surigao del Norte under the DepEd 

Automatic Payroll Deduction System (APDS) 

totaling ₱121,873.98 and ₱298,042.10, 

respectively, were not recognized in the books of 

accounts as Income even in prior years since the 

service income deducted from the gross salary 

loan deductions of employees were not 

recognized upon remittance to PLIs. Instead, the 

amounts remained as part of the Due to NGAs 

account in the Division of Surigao City and Other 

Payables account in the Division of Surigao del 

Norte even after remittance to the BTr. By not 

closing out the gross amount of Due to NGAs and 

Other Payables account upon full remittance of 

loan repayments to BTr and not recognizing 

Other Service Income resulted in overstatement 

of Liability accounts and understatement of Other 

Service Income account by the same amounts.

₱1.032 million. Verification with the Division 

Accountant revealed that the negative balance 

was due to their overpayment/over remittance to 

the RO of their liability for the salaries of teachers 

and employees under the Regional Payroll 

Service Unit (RPSU). The negative balance 

should have been taken up in the books as a

guidelines on accreditation/re-accreditation of private entities under the 

Automatic Payroll Deduction System (APDS) program and states that: 

 

Item 27. Entities participating in the APDS shall pay the following 

service fees, which shall be collected by the DepEd Implementing Units 

(Central, Regional, Schools Division and Implementing Unit Secondary 

Schools) through automatic deduction from the remittance due to the 

Accredited/Re-accredited Entity, in favor of the DepEd Provident Fund. 
 

1.203 Chapter 3, Volume III of the GAM for NGAs provides the description of 
accounts in the financial statements. 

 

Cash - Treasury/Agency Deposit Trust – Debit this account in the 

agency books for the amount of trust/collections and trust funds remitted 

to the BTr and adjustments for lapsed NCA. This is credited to close Cash 

– MDS, Trust account. 
 

Other Payables – This account is used to record other liabilities not 

falling any of the specific payable accounts. Debit this account for 

settlement of liabilities. 
 



157 

 

Other Service Income – This account is used to record other service 

income not falling under any of the specific service income accounts. 

This account shall be closed to the Income and Expense Summary 

account. 
 

1.204 Both SDOs of Baguio City and Benguet and its various IUs, failed to recognize 
in the   books of accounts the collected service fees from the Private Lending 

Institutions (PLIs) which thus resulted in the understatement of the Other 

Service Income account and overstatement of the Other Payables account.  

 

1.205 On the other hand, the Benguet NHS recorded in its books the collections from 
lost books as Other Payables, which resulted in overstatement thereof.   

 

1.206 We recommended that the Management require the Accounting Units of 
the concerned Offices to recognize the services fees withheld and the 

deposit to the BTr, using the Other Service Income and Cash-Treasury 

Agency Deposit accounts. 
 

1.207 The Management comments as well as the Audit Teams’ rejoinder are as 
follows: 

 
SDO/IU Management Comments Audit Team’s Rejoinder 

Baguio City NHS, 

Baguio City NHS, 

Guisad Valley NHS, 

Irisan NHS, 

Magsaysay NHS, 

Mil-An NHS, Pines 

City NHS, and 

Roxas NHS 

The Management of seven  IUs of 

SDO-Baguio agreed to 

implement the audit 

recommendation.  The 

Bookkeepers will recognize the 

service fees withheld as Income 

and the subsequent deposit to the 

BTr. 

 

Alejo M. Pacalso 

Memorial NHS 

The Management of Alejo M. 

Pacalso Memorial NHS 

meanwhile refuted the audit 

recommendation for doing so will 

cause an overstatement of other 

service income on the end of 

DepEd. 

 

The assertion that only the Central 

Office will record the Other Service 

Income at yearend violated the 

principle of accrual basis of 

accounting, which provides that 

transactions should be recognized 

when they occur and not only when 

cash or its equivalent is received or 

paid.  Also, it was not the services of 

the Central Office that resulted in the 

collections of additional income but 

the services rendered by the IUs, 

hence it is appropriate that the 

collecting agency shall record the 

receipt of income. 

 

Thus, the Audit Team maintains its 

stand that service income should be 

recognized by the collecting agency 

upon constructive receipt of fees 

from the private lending institutions 

on loan repayments under the

account.”  
 

1.209 Audit disclosed that assistance received by the SDO-Dinagat Islands in RO 
XIII in the amount of ₱1,510,000.00 from the Local Government Unit was 

recorded to Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) instead of Assistance from LGU

j.1 Prior year expenses reported/charged against current year expenses/ 

appropriations 
 

1.212 Section 2, Chapter 2 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, defines “accrual” as 
basis of accounting under which transactions are recognized when they occur 

(not only when cash or its equivalent is received or paid). Therefore, the 

transactions and events are recognized in the accounting records and 

recognized in the financial statements of the periods to which they relate. 

 

1.213 Section 6(b), Chapter 2 of the same GAM, further states that “Each entity shall 
recognize and present its financial transactions and operations 

conformably…in the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with the 

PPSAS.” 
 

1.214 Section 119 of PD No. 1445 provides that “All lawful expenditures and 
obligations incurred during the year shall be taken up in the accounts of that 

year.” 

 



160 

 

1.215 In DepEd NCR - SDO of Quezon City, a total amount of ₱17,875,163.68 
pertaining to prior year’s salaries consisting of salary differential, step 

increments among teaching/non-teaching personnel and payment to newly-

hired staff was inadvertently recorded as current year’s payroll expenses. The 

Accounting Unit should have recognized said expenses in the year that these 

were incurred and will remain as Management’s liability under the Due to 

Officers and Employees account until such time that documentary 

requirements were complied with and payment was granted. 

 

1.216 Moreover, prior year expenditures were also paid out of the current year’s 
budgetary appropriations among various SDOs and NHSs in ROs I and II 

totaling P906,269.07 and P736,173.75, respectively, contrary to Section 119 

of PD No. 1445 and Sections 2 and 6(b) of the GAM for NGAs, Volume 1, 

thus affecting proper recording of financial transactions in the applicable 

accounting period. 

 

1.217 Likewise, in RO VIII, prior year’s expenses totaling P539,332.91 specifically 
that of the Bato School of Fisheries and Hilongos National Vocational School 

were also found to have only been paid during this period by utilizing their 

current year’s allotment. 
 

1.218 On the other hand, SDOs-San Jose City, Cabanatuan City and Camp Tinio 
NHS of RO III paid a total gratuity of ₱44,000.00 to their Job Orders (Jos) and 

Contract of Service (COS) Workers and charged it against current year 

appropriations, which was contrary to Section 3.a of Administrative Order No. 

20 and Sections 4(1) and 119 of PD No. 1445, thus casting doubt on the 

regularity and propriety of the transaction. 
 

1.219 Lastly, various CY 2019 expenses totaling P1,112,546.35 in RO XIII – SDOs 
Bislig City, Surigao del Sur and Tandag City were erroneously recorded in the 

CY 2020 books of accounts, which resulted in the overstatement of the affected 

Expenses accounts and understatement of the accumulated surplus for the 

current year. 
 

1.220 We recommended that the Management require the Accounting Units of 
the concerned offices to: 

 

a) draw necessary adjusting journal entries to correct the misstated 
accounts; 

 

b) observe proper recording and recognition of expenses in accordance 
with the GAM for NGAs to ensure fair presentation and reliability of 

the Expenses accounts balances in the FS; and 
 

c) stop the practice of charging prior years’ expenses against the current 
year appropriations. 

 



161 

 

1.221 The Management’s comments are as follows: 
 

RO Management’s Comments 

I Management has noted the recommendations and assured strict adherence 

to the provisions of Section 119 of PD No. 1445 effective CY 2021. 

II The Management agreed and will adhere with the recommendations given 

by the Audit Team. 

III Management agreed with the recommendations and Division Accountant 

disclosed that the Trial Balance of the seven FAHS were submitted before 

the adjustments during consolidation. 

VIII The Management will comply with the recommendation of the Audit 

Team to refrain from charging prior years’ expenses against the current 

year appropriation and to observe proper recording and recognition of 

expenses. 

 

j.2 Erroneous recording of expenses 
 

1.222 Section 27 of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) 1 
provides that “Financial statements shall present fairly the financial position, 

financial performance, and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires 

the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and 

conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for 

assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in IPSASs.” 

 

1.223 Sec. 27, Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs  states that “PPE 
gradually loses its ability to provide service over the course of time. Because 

of this, its cost needs to be distributed on a systematic basis over its useful life.   

The allocated cost is referred to as depreciation.  The depreciation charge for 

each period shall be recognized as expense unless it is included in the carrying 

amount of another asset.  For example, the depreciation of manufacturing 

plant and equipment is included in the costs of conversion of inventories.  

Similarly, depreciation of PPE used for development activities may be 

included in the cost of an intangible asset recognized” 
 

1.224 In RO III, a total amount of ₱1,352,859.00 was erroneously charged to 
Insurance Expenses, presented both in the Combined and Individual Trial 

Balances of three Fiscally Autonomous High Schools (FAHS). Validation 

made by the Audit Team disclosed that insurance expense amounting to 

₱3,017.83 was incurred during the year. Further validation disclosed that the 

unexpended portion of the appropriation pertained to Insurance Expenses, 

which was realigned to other necessary expenses of the school, thus the 

Insurance Expenses was misstated by ₱1,349,841.17. 
 

1.225 Furthermore, the Combined Trial Balance, Depreciation Expenses – 
Machinery and Equipment amounting to ₱100,079.51 for the Eduardo L. Joson 

Memorial High School was noted without the corresponding PPE account and 

Accumulated Depreciation. Inquiry with the Bookkeeper of the school 

disclosed that the recognition of Depreciation Expenses and corresponding 



162 

 

Accumulated Depreciation of ₱100,079.51 was instead made for the 

Inventories - Semi-Expendable – Machinery account. Thus, 

improper/erroneous recognition of Depreciation Expenses resulted in its 

misstatement.  

 

1.226 Meanwhile, in RO IV-A, payment of overtime totaling P104,363.42 for the 
year was recorded in the Overtime and Night Pay account instead of Due to 

Officers and Employees account since the said obligation was already recorded 

as a payable in CY 2019 under JEV No. 01-2019-12-0014563. 

 

1.227 In SDO Albay, the Prepaid Insurance account was overstated by P544,223.35 
because of the erroneous recording of the payments made for the fidelity bonds 

of accountable officers instead of recording the said amount to the Fidelity 

Bond Premiums account, as provided under Volume III of the GAM for NGAs, 

thus affecting the fairness of presentation of the affected accounts in the FSs 

as of December 31, 2020. 
 

1.228 We recommended that the Management require the Accounting Units of 
the concerned offices to: 

 

a) draw necessary adjusting journal entries to correct the misstated 
accounts; 
 

b) comply with the provision of depreciation for the PPEs in accordance 
with Section 27, Chapter 10 of the GAM; and 

 

c) classify correctly the transactions to avoid misstatements of accounts.      
 

1.229 The Management’s comments are as follows: 
 

RO Management’s Comments 

III Management agreed with the recommendations and Division Accountant 

disclosed that the Trial Balance of the seven FAHS were submitted before 

the adjustments during consolidation. 

IV-A Management of Batangas Province is amenable on the findings and 

observations and will comply with the audit recommendations.    

V During the Exit Conference, the Accounting Unit personnel said that 

necessary reclassification entries were already recorded in the books and 

incorporated in the 2020 FSs. The person-in-charge for JEV preparation has 

already been instructed to use the "Fidelity Bond Premium" account to 

conform to the GAM Manual. 

 

j.3 Unrecorded Salaries and Wages 
 

1.230 Section 2, Chapter 2 of Volume I of the GAM for NGAs defines “accrual” as 
basis of accounting under which transactions are recognized when they occur 

(not only when cash or its equivalent is received or paid). Therefore, the 



163 

 

transactions and events are recognized in the accounting records and 

recognized in the financial statements of the periods to which they relate. 

 

1.231 In DepEd NCR - SDO of Quezon City, review of the General Ledger for CY 
2020 disclosed that the Salaries and Wages of SDO-QC personnel for the 

month of January 2020 in the total amount of ₱205,334,770.52 was not 

recognized in the books of accounts, hence not included in the Statement of 

Financial Performance for the year ended December 31, 2020, thus 

understating the Salaries and Wages – Regular expense account by the same 

amount. 

 

1.232 We recommended that the Management require the Accounting Unit to 
observe the proper recording and recognition of expenses, in accordance 

with the GAM for NGAs, to ensure fair presentation and reliability of the 

Expenses accounts balances in the FS. 

 

 

OTHER ACCOUNTING DEFICIENCIES 

 

2. Unresolved variances and huge discrepancies of P40,888,026,633.98 between 
accounting records and the supporting schedules/documents and unsubstantiated 

balances in various accounts were noted, which affected the reliability of the 

consolidated financial statements. 

 

2.1 Section 6, Chapter 19 of the GAM, Volume I enumerated the qualitative 
characteristics of financial reporting. Among which, are reliability, faithful 

representation and completeness defined as follows: 
 

Reliability – reliable information is free from material error and bias, and 

can be depended on by the users to represent faithfully that which it 

purports to represent or could reasonably be expected to represent. 
 

Faithful representation – information to represent faithfully transactions 

and other events, it should be presented in accordance with the substance 

of the transactions and other events, and not merely their legal form. 
 

Completeness – the information in FSs should be complete within the 

bounds of materiality and cost. 
 

2.2 Section 7, Chapter 19, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs states that financial 
statements shall present fairly the financial position, financial performance and 

cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of 

the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with the 

definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses 

set out in PPSASs. (Par. 27, PPSAS 1) 
 



164 

 

2.3 Section 111, Chapter 2 of PD No. 1445 provides that the highest standards of 
honesty, objectivity and consistency shall be observed in the keeping of 

accounts to safeguard against inaccurate or misleading information. 
 

2.4 The following deficiencies in recording and reporting financial transactions 
resulting from lack of reconciliation of Accounting and Property records also 

affected the reliability, accuracy, completeness, and valuation of the reported 

account balances of the FSs.

2.5 Sound internal control for cash requires that a reconciliation of bank accounts 
be undertaken and reconciling items immediately corrected in order to ensure 

accuracy of the bank balances appearing in the financial statements. It is only 

when the books and bank records are reconciled that the reported cash balances 

are rendered accurate and reliable. 

 

2.6 Section 112 of PD No. 1445 requires that each government agency shall record 
its financial transactions and operations conformably with IPSASs and in 

accordance with pertinent laws and regulations. 
 

2.7 COA Circular No. 96-011 requires the Accountant to reconcile the Bank 
Statements (BS) with the General Ledger (GL) of the agency within ten days 

from receipt of the BS and submit to the Auditor concerned the Bank 

Reconciliation Statement (BRS) prepared for verification.  Sound internal 

control in safeguarding the assets of the agency particularly the Cash in Bank 

account is the preparation of BRS.  It is an indispensable tool to determine 

whether cash in bank balances recorded in the books of accounts reconcile with 

the bank accounts balances maintained by the agency in the authorized 

government depository banks (AGDB). 

 



165 

 

2.8 Sections 5, 6 and 7, Chapter 21 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I, provide that 
“The Chief Accountant/Designated Staff shall within ten days from receipt of 

the monthly Bank Statement (BS) together with the paid checks, original copies 

of Debit Memoranda (DM)/Credit Memoranda (CM) from the GSB, reconcile 

the BS with the GL, and prepare the BRS in four copies. The Chief 

Accountant/Designated Staff shall prepare Journal Entry Voucher (JEV) to 

recognize all reconciling items that require adjustment and correction in the 

books of accounts and shall submit the BRS within twenty days after receipt of 

the monthly BS to the following: 

 
Original - COA Auditor (with all the supporting documents and JEVs) 

Copy - Head of Agency/Entity 

Copy 3 - Accounting Division/Unit file

a.1 Unreconciled variance between the balances of Cash in Bank - LCCA 
per books and per bank – ₱109,412,435.33 

 

2.9 Audit showed that the correctness of the balances of Cash accounts in CO, 
NCR, RO IV-A and RO VIII amounting to ₱809,148,321.74 maintained with 

GSB as of a given period could not be easily determined due to late or non-

preparation/submission, erroneous and other deficiencies noted in the 

preparation by the Accountants of the BRS. Thus, it defeats the purpose for 

which the BRS are prepared and could result in unrecorded adjustments, hence 

casts doubt on the accuracy and reliability of the Cash accounts and other 

affected accounts. Details of the variance/discrepancy between the Cash in 

Bank - LCCA account balance per books and per bank are shown below:

maintenance of SLs, prevented the timely verification and reconciliation of the 

accounts, early detection of deficiencies and immediate communication of 

results by the Audit Teams to the Management. 

 

2.11 We recommended that the Management of the concerned offices: 
 

a) identify the nature and composition of unaccounted/unreconciled 
balances by substantiating the same with documents relative thereto 

and subsequently, prepare the necessary adjustments, as warranted, 

to reflect the accurate balance of the Cash accounts; and 

 

b) prepare and submit the monthly BRS for all bank accounts 
maintained by the SDOs to determine all reconciling items that need 

correction/adjustment in the books to reflect the correct balance of the 

Cash in Bank and other affected accounts, and henceforth, strictly 

comply with the prescribed period on the preparation and submission 

of the BRS. 
 



167 

 

2.12 The Management commented as follows: 
 

Office/RO SDO/IU Management’s Comments 

CO - The Management had requested time extension to submit their comments 

to enable them to properly coordinate responses from the concerned 

offices, prepare necessary documents and gather relevant information in 

order to appropriately address the observations and recommendations. 

NCR ROP The amount of ₱1,181,735.51 will be adjusted as soon as the reconstructed 

SLs of RELC-NEAP, which was unfortunately corrupted in the previous 

year, have been established.    

Valenzuela The BRS for the month of December 2020 which was received on 

February 26, 2021 was already submitted to the COA Office, together with 

the supporting schedule on March 9, 2021.  According to the Management, 

all reconciling items as a result of the bank reconciliation will be reflected 

in the 2021 FSs. 

Pasay The Chief Accountant of the Division Proper reconciled his bank balance 

per books with the bank and prepared a revised BRS. 

IV-A Batangas Province The Management of Batangas Province is amenable on the findings and 

observations and will comply with the audit recommendations. 

VIII Ormoc City The reconciling items were already reflected in the BRS since January 

2016. Thus, we will coordinate with the bank and ask for BS for CY 2015 

and backwards to trace the difference and determine what year the 

reconciling items started so that we can record the adjustments in the books 

of accounts. 

Samar The Accounting Department promised to regularly prepare the BRS and 

submit the same to the COA at the prescribed period. Moreover, the 

Accountant already had a verbal agreement with the staff that in case of 

delays, a memorandum will be issued to him. 

San Jose THS The Accountant explained that the Cash balance indicated in the bank 

confirmation is the amount for reversion to BTr because there was no 

SARO for the said cash allocation. Further, she stated that she already has 

the copy of the BS and agreed to submit the CY 2020 BRS on April 2021.

Cash Units.

CO - CIB-LCCA It was noted in our previous year’s audit that the DECS 

TEEP Dollar account and DECS Time Deposit totaling 

P580,256.04 should have been debited to the Cash in 

Bank – LCCA account but the same was erroneously 

debited under the OSEC Trust account SL, instead of a 

separate SL for the two accounts, hence resulted as a 

bank reconciling item under the OSEC Trust account.

and verification. Thus, the accuracy of the affected Cash 

balances could not be ascertained.

RO XIII disclosed an inclusion of an amount of 

₱1,171,321.61 pertaining to the duly reverted stale or 

unclaimed checks for payments to various PLIs from CY 

2017 to CY 2020. The said amount has been inequitably 

held in the possession of the ROP as this amount is due 

for refund to teachers-borrowers for closed PLIs or for 

remittance to PLIs. Moreover, the said 

unrefunded/unremitted cash pertaining to all stale 

checks has no SL to support the details of balances, thus 

the correctness thereof could not be ascertained 

particularly those unclaimed prior to CY 2017. 

1,171,321.61 

Total    400,236,290.89 

 

2.13 We recommended that Management: 
 

a) exert extra effort to analyze and identify the unaccounted balances to 
properly make the necessary adjustments in the book and reflect the 

correct balance of the affected Cash accounts; 

 

b) require the Bookkeeper to submit copies of the BS, debit/credit 
memos, cancelled and paid checks and all other supporting documents 

necessary to facilitate the timely verification of Monthly BRS 

submitted to the Audit Team for the verification process; and 

 

c) establish the correct cash balance pertaining to PLI’s stale checks 
from its inception which remained idle and recorded under Cash-

LCCA and maintain an SL relative thereto.

2.14 The Management comments as well as the Audit Team’s rejoinder are as 
follows: 

 

Office/RO SDO/IU Management’s Comments 

CO  The Management already prepared JEV to effect the adjustment in the SL 

accounts. 

NCR Taguig/Pateros The Management of SDO-Taguig/Pateros commented that the Division 

Office relentlessly work hard in order to analyze and identify the 

composition/breakdown of the Cash-Collecting Officers account as of 

December 31, 2020. Despite the unavailability of reliable records/data, 

initial analysis of the account was conducted. Persistent and extensive 

efforts are exerted to come up with the correct balance of the Cash - 

Collecting Officers account. The reconciliation report shall be submitted 

when deemed completed. 

VIII Ipil NHS Management commented that they will comply with the recommendation 

and will submit the requirements. 

ROP The Management commented that the Accounting Section will look into 

the reconciling items taken up in prior years’ submitted BRS and will 

effect necessary adjustments and undertake the updating of BRS to date.  

Northern 

Samar 

The Accountant III admitted the delay of the preparation of the BRS. Aside 

from the pandemic, the late issuance of the BS caused the delay in the 

preparation of the BRS. Furthermore, with regards to the Trust Fund, the 

assigned Accountant I is still new to the position and is still in the process 

of verifying the reconciling items. Currently, the BRS as of December 

2019 was already prepared and submitted and is already working on the 

CY 2020 BRS. The Accountant III assured to take actions in order to 

comply with the recommendation. 

XIII ROP The Management of the ROP commented that RPSU and APDS Task 

Force have no control over the teachers entering into loans and/or 

insurance; and they have no control over the insurance companies or PLIs 

who failed to claim their checks at the Cash Unit. It was emphasized that 

monthly contributions or amortizations cannot be terminated unilaterally 

by the RPSU without either a certificate of full payment or deletion form 

signed by the insurance companies or PLIs. Management advised the Cash 

Unit to prepare a regular report to RPSU if there are unclaimed checks by 

the insurance companies. 

 

Audit Team’s Rejoinder: 

 

The Auditor emphasized that the audit was focused on the unclaimed 

checks for several years and to the corresponding cash which was retained 

and booked under the Cash-LCCA account. The concern now is for the 

Management to validate the existence of the closed insurance companies 

so that the RPSU has a valid basis to discontinue the deduction of monthly 

premiums for the welfare of the teachers. Moreover, Management has to 

evaluate the possibility of returning the cash to the teachers which 

remained accumulated over the years. If refund to teachers is not possible, 

the accumulated amount representing the unclaimed amount without check 

re-issuance and deemed idle must be remitted to the BTr. 

 

b) Deficiencies affecting the reliability of Receivables account balances - 
₱5,497,963,459.20 

  

2.15 Reliability of Receivables account cannot be ascertained due to: (a) 
unreconciled variances caused by absence of reconciliation between 

Accounting Units of DepEd Offices and concerned agencies; (b) deficiencies 



170 

 

in keeping of accounts; and (c) doubtful collectability of receivables and 

accumulation of past due accounts. Details are as follows:

NCR Due from

The yearend balance of account Due from GOCCs of 

SDO-Manila cannot be relied upon due to the unreconciled 

variance appearing in the records of both the SDO and the 

NDA. Confirmation with the Chief Accountant of the 

NDA revealed that the SDO-Manila has no outstanding 

balance as of December 31, 2020, as against the book 

balance of ₱8,703,374.40, or a variance of Due from 

GOCCs account appearing in both of their records, 

amounting to ₱8,703,374.40.  The difference was due to 

the unrecorded LR No. 21-01-02 submitted only by NDA 

to the SDO-Manila on February 11, 2021, more than a 

month after the closing of its books.

explained that (a) especially for

hence there were over application 

of remittances to some accounts; 

(b) the Billing Statements did not 

specify the loan policy number

due accounts – ₱32,304,876.29 

 

2.18 Paragraph 1, Section X.10 of DepEd Order No. 36, s. 2007 provides that the 
Provident Fund loan shall have an interest rate of six percent (6%) per annum, 

add-on and straight computation. Repayment period shall be at the option of 

the borrower, subject to his/her capacity to pay and computation of his/her net 

take home pay which shall not be reduced to less than Three Thousand Pesos 

(₱3,000.00) after all deductions including the Provident Fund Loan 

amortization. The borrower may opt for a repayment schedule of twelve (12) 

months or one (1) year up to a maximum period of sixty (60) months or five 

(5) years equal monthly installments. In all cases, repayment of loans shall be 

through automatic deduction from the borrower’s salary, either by agency 

payroll or PSD-IBM deduction. 

 

2.19 Paragraph 1, Section X.12 of DepEd Order No. 12, s. 2004 also provides that 
all borrowers must have a co-maker who is a permanent employee of the 

Department and not due for retirement during the pendency of the loan. 

 

2.20 Section X.13 of the same DepEd Order likewise provides that retiring 
teachers/employees shall be requested to either pay the outstanding loan 

balance in full or issue a notarized promissory note stating, among others, that 

the outstanding loan balance shall be paid in full upon the receipt of his/her 

retirement/terminal leave benefits. 

  



177 

 

2.21 Item 1.d of DepEd Order No. 42, s. 2003 similarly states the following rules 
on the Remittance of Loan Repayments: 

 

 In all cases, repayment of loans shall be through automatic deduction 
from the borrower’s salary, to be reflected every 15th of the month either 

by payroll or disbursement voucher. 

 

 The Secretariat shall prepare the monthly abstract of deductions based 
on the processed payroll or disbursement voucher collected from the 

Cash Division not later than 22nd of each month. 

 

 Thereafter, the remittance of loan repayments shall follow the usual 
processing of voucher of remittance for the Provident Fund. 

 

2.22 Collectability of past due loans receivables in six regions with an aggregate 
amount of ₱29,109,321.28 is doubtful caused by borrowers who were either 

retired, resigned, deceased or on Absent Without Leave (AWOL). In the same 

way, the Other Receivables account of Region IV-A on the overpayment of 

salary amounting to ₱89,361.41 is also doubtful due to the payees who went 

abroad, transferred and with unknown whereabouts. Likewise, the Receivables 

from the overpayment to the contractors amounting to ₱1,479,682.95 in CY 

2015 remained uncollected as of December 31, 2020.

2.23 The continuous failure of the responsible officials to collect the past due 
accounts (principal amount plus accrued interest earned) and to transmit the 

list of borrowers to the RO for timely deduction of loan amortization could 

deprive qualified borrowers from availing of the provident loan and such delay 

or failure poses the risk of non-collection of income earned from such 

investment or worse, the diminution of capital provided by the DepEd to 

implement the Provident Fund program. 

 

2.24 Also, the overpayment of salaries posed risk of possible loss of government 
funds if not recovered within the soonest possible time and failure to 

immediately collect the refund of the full amount expended for undue expenses 

indicates inefficiency in managing and safeguarding the resources of the 

government from loss or wastage and ultimately deprived the government of 

the use thereof to finance its priority projects. 

 

2.25 We recommended that the Management: 
 

a) require both the Accounting and Property Units to exert extra effort 
in scrutinizing, analyzing and reconciling the noted unaccounted 

variances and dormant balances in Receivable accounts by 

coordinating with the concerned Agencies. Henceforth, conduct 

periodic reconciliation to ensure reconciled balances between DepEd 

Offices and other Agencies’ records at any given period and to 

immediately correct any discrepancies; 

 



180 

 

b) require the Accountants of the concerned DepEd Offices to make the 
necessary adjustments in the books of accounts to reflect the actual 

amount of receivables from other Agencies; 

 

c) coordinate with the NDA and require them to submit the LR before 
the yearend or its required cut-off date to properly reflect the correct 

account balance of the Due from GOCCs and the related expense 

accounts of SDO-Manila;  

 

d) cause the immediate preparation/submission of updated SLs for each 
loan borrower and ensure proper safekeeping of records to facilitate 

the monitoring of these receivables; 

 

e) strengthen the monitoring of the Provident Fund so that the 
delinquent accounts may be recovered, monthly amortizations will be 

collected on due dates and certifications on the outstanding balances 

of renewal of applications will be accurate; 

 

f) send demand letters to borrowers who have resigned, retired and 
transferred without prejudice to the availment of civil and 

administrative remedies to effect collection of unpaid loan balances 

and overpayment of salaries; 

 

g) ensure that borrowers who are about to retire, resign, or transfer shall 
only be cleared from accountabilities upon full settlement of their 

obligations; 

 

h) exert efforts to collect the disallowances of the personnel still in service 
including those that already retired or resigned, otherwise the balance 

of the unsettled disallowances shall be assumed by other officials and 

employees who were named as co-liable in accordance with Section 

16.3 COA Circular No. 2009-006;

2.26 The Management comments as well as the Audit Team’s rejoinder are as 
follows: 

 
Office/RO SDO/IUs Management Comments/Auditor’s Rejoinder 

CO  The Management had requested time extension to submit their comments 

to enable them to properly coordinate responses from the concerned offices, 

prepare necessary documents and gather relevant information in order to 

appropriately address the observations and recommendations. 

NCR ROP Due from NGAs 

 

The Management, in their letter dated March 8, 2021, reported that the 

DBM-PS informed them in its letter dated October 12, 2020, that the 

unutilized/undelivered prepayment balances from CY 2017 and prior years, 

has already been cash swept to the account of the BTr in response to the 

implementation of the Social Amelioration Measures to address the effects 

of the COVID-19 emergency. 

 

Moreover, DBM-PS has made an advisory to all National Government 

Agencies that CY 2018 and prior year's prepayment balances will also be 

reverted to the account of the BTr, leaving only the CY 2019 prepayments 

that can still be used for procurement.  

 

Thus, with the full implementation DBM-PS Virtual Store, Management 

found some errors in the account of DepEd NCR RO Proper.  The 

Management attached the Accounts Reconciliation Statement as of 

December 31, 2020, for further verification by the Audit Team.                                                                                                                                              

 

As of December 31, 2020, some of the erroneous entries had been corrected, 

however, as per the DBM-PS policy of one customer number assigned per 

Agency; having the same Agency Head, entries that should have been for 

NCR RELC NEAP still exist. Some of the book reconciling items on the 

account sweeping in prior years were already adjusted this February 2021.  

 

Management informed that request for Statement of Account vis-a-vis 

virtual store balance is being done monthly as a reference for the 

preparation of the periodic Reconciliation Statement with the DBM-PS. 

 

Due from Operating Units 

 

The Management commented in their letter dated April 5, 2021, that the 

balance from Due from Operating Units account of (₱25,672,962.34) 

represents a net over-remittance by some Operating Units (SDOs/IUs) for 

the monthly requirement of Other Payables to various Lending Institutions 

(PLIs) as of December 31, 2020. 

 

As of February 28, 2021, the said amount has already been reconciled, 

adjusted per JEV No. 2021-02-00228 dated February 28, 2021, and 

immediately remitted to the BTr per Check No. 389146 dated March 1, 

2021. 

 

Moreover, to ensure that all financial transactions are properly and 

accurately taken up in the books, the Management had developed an 

online/real-time submission of deposits to facilitate the immediate 

verification and reconciliation of this reciprocal account. 

The Management agrees with the recommendation in the AOM and has 



182 

 

Office/RO SDO/IUs Management Comments/Auditor’s Rejoinder 

directed the Accountant to exert effort in reconciling the Due from NGAs 

account by coordinating the DBM-PS regarding the discrepancy and to 

analyze thoroughly the inter-agency transactions and effect the necessary 

adjustments in order to come up with the current balances.  

 

The Accountant has already requested for Certificate of Cash Availability 

based on the balance of Unutilized Deposits to DBM-PS, however, as of 

today, no response was received. Management commented that out of the 

total balance of ₱46,236.85, additional delivery of items was received last 

January 26, 2021 amounting to ₱24,171.96.  The beginning balance of 

₱23,662.01 is already being reconciled with the DBM-PS as the said 

amount is not reflected in their statement of account.

Valenzuela Management commented that out of the total balance of ₱46,236.85, 

additional delivery of items was received on January 26, 2021 amounting 

to ₱24,171.96.  The beginning balance of ₱23,662.01 is already being 

reconciled with the DBM-PS as the said amount is not reflected in their 

Statement of Account (SOA).

City 

Management mentioned that they will abide with the Audit Team’s 

recommendations and ensure strict compliance on the collections of the 

loans granted to the borrowers, or notifying the co-borrowers to settle the 

loan balances. 

 

Further, Management commented that most of the balances appearing in 

the past due loans receivables were turned-over by the DepEd RO without 

any supporting documents. They also informed us during the Exit 

Conference that if there were documents pertaining to the loans, it most 

probably have been damaged during the flood in CY 2018 for SDO 

Pangasinan II. Management, however, vowed to coordinate with the RO 

regarding the past due loans and enforce collections from member-debtors. 

Various 

SDOs and 

Implementing 

Units 

Management commented that the Accounting Office regularly conducts 

quarterly reconciliation of reciprocal accounts between RO and the School 

Division Offices (SDO). The reconciliation of reciprocal accounts was 

discussed during the Webinar on the Preparation and Submission of CY 

2020 Financial Reports on January 6, 2021. Agreements between the RO 

and SDOs were to disclose in the Notes to FSs. The balance under the Due 

from Operating Units account in the RO books represents the unfunded 

salary deductions for December 2020 of some SDOs due to cash 

insufficiency. The deficit was funded in January 2021. SDOs and 

Implementing Units (IU) with balances under Due to Regional Office 

account were advised to settle their account with the RO. 

 

Moreover, as to the Due to Operating Units (RO books) account, the 

Accounting Office has sent letters to IUs to confirm the existence of 

dormant accounts. The Accounting Office received some reply-letters. The 

Accounting Section will also request a Certification of the non-existence 

of amount to IU, which declared the non-existence of account in their 



183 

 

Office/RO SDO/IUs Management Comments/Auditor’s Rejoinder 

books. Through the Accounting Office, the Management will also send 

follow-up letters to IUs that have no reply. 

 

The requirements needed for the possible request for the write-off of the 

reciprocal accounts in the agency's books will be prepared by the 

Management subject to the evaluation and approval of the Commission on 

Audit (COA) on the authority to write-off. 

II ROP The noted material difference between the remittances based on SOA 

maintained by the RPSU- Accounting and the confirmation provided by the 

SDOs to the Audit Team is caused by some SDOs who did not include data 

pertaining to their Implementing Units (IUs) whose payrolls are still 

maintained with the RPSU. Nevertheless, reconciliation on this account is 

ongoing.  As regards the over remittances, Management said that it is 

waiting for the answer of the SDOs concerned. 

Cauayan City Demand letters were already prepared to those retired employees. Also, 

unbilled borrowers were billed in 2021. Moreover, transferred borrowers 

were already transmitted to receiving SDO. Nonetheless, the Management 

ensures adherence to the audit recommendations.

ROP: 

 

• A follow up letter addressed to DepEd CO was prepared and will be sent 

accordingly; and 

 

• The Due from Operating/Field Units amounting to ₱62,005,300.65 was 

reclassified to Due to Operating/Field Units. 

 

Pampanga: 

 

The receivable from DepEd ROP are GSIS cancelled checks pertaining to 

various DepEd Pampanga personnel. The Account is outstanding for more 

than five (5) years and the Accounting unit already checked all possible file 

or document related to the said account but no listing or schedule was 

found. In addition, the DepEd ROP has no disposition on whether to write 

off the account. 

 

Cabanatuan City and Science City of Muñoz: 

 

The Management agreed to comply with the recommendations. 

IV-A Lucena City Management has already sent demand letters to concerned delinquent 

borrowers to settle their outstanding loan balance as soon as possible.  For 

the deceased borrower they will coordinate with the RO whether the co-

maker will be held liable. For those borrowers who will refuse to settle their 

respective loan balances will be referred to the RO for an authorization to 

effect salary deduction. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

We appreciated the action being taken and to be taken by Management.

Office/RO SDO/IUs Management Comments/Auditor’s Rejoinder 

 Batangas City The Accountant averred that this was due to transition period when the 

personnel-in-charge was promoted and transferred to another office.  Two 

new staff were assigned to immediately update and reconcile the Loans 

Receivable account under the Provident Fund. Reconciliation of SLs per 

Financial Statement (FS) is still ongoing to identify the said difference.  She 

further justified that due to the volume of work the SLs were not properly 

maintained. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

We remained our stand that the FS should be supported with updated SLs 

duly accounted for per each borrower for submission to the Audit Team for 

verification and validation. 

 Quezon 

Province 

The Accountant will issue demand/ collection letter to enforce full 

collection of the said receivable from the Contractor. The Accounting 

Section will be more cautious pre-auditing the documents for payment of 

various claims. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

Considering that the receivable resulted from the undue payment to 

contractor, the full amount should have been collected immediately 

 Tanauan City The OIC-SDS sent demand letters dated February 23, 2021 addressed to the 

six concerned personnel thru LBC on March 8, 2021 giving them 15 days 

to settle the amount.  No response yet was received by the Management. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

We maintained our stand that Management should exert all efforts to collect 

those long overdue receivables in favor of the government. 

IV-B Calapan City The Management committed to implement the recommendations. 

VII Applied

VIII ROP Management commented that SL for all fund transfer to SDOs is being done 

and continuously being updated. The prior years' balances are also being 

considered in the task at hand. 

Northern 

Samar 

The Accountant III explained that the balance for “Due from NGAs” was 

already disclosed in the Notes to FS as overpayment of remittances for Pag-

IBIG and PhilHealth, which were outstanding since June 2013. On the other 

hand, the balance for “Due to LGU”, has no disclosure in the Notes to FSs 

but was existent since 2013. The cited balance of “Due to RO” is subject to 

ongoing reconciliation with the RO due to excess transfer of funds in CY 

2017. There are times that the amounts actually remitted is less than the 

amount of the issued check, resulting in excess transfers. Moreover, the 

account “Due to Operating Units” was used to recognize funds downloaded 

to operating units directly to the bank account maintained under the name 

of the school. In compliance with the recommendation, the Accountant 

assured to submit the required SLs/schedules. 

X ROP In response to the audit observation, the Management attached photocopies 

of the ORs of Joel B. Granada, Nos. 8335687 and 8335688 dated February 

18 and 19, 2021, respectively, as full settlement of provident loan thereby 

decreasing the balance of delinquent accounts to P1,544,709.33. 

Management assured that the recommendations are well taken. The 

outstanding loans of DepEd borrowers are regularly monitored and 

presently, measures are undertaken to ensure that delinquency of accounts 

is prevented.

Office/RO SDO/IUs Management Comments/Auditor’s Rejoinder 

Misamis 

Oriental 

In its letter-reply dated March 9, 2021, the Division Accountant explained 

that the negative balances of PF Loans Receivables tagged under “Others” 

pertained to collections from the period October to December 2020 when 

the accounting system of the PF encountered technical failures. The in-

charge of the accounting system was not able to fix the said failure because 

of the COVID lockdowns and the difficulties of travelling. The in-charge 

recently visited the Division Office, and he is currently trying to fix the 

system. The PF accounting in-charge was already instructed once the 

system is up to follow strictly the recommendations of COA to fast-track 

the reconciliation of the unusual balances and enforce DepEd Orders 

regulating the administration of the Provident fund. During the Exit 

Conference, the Budget Officer reiterated this condition and added that the 

existing accounting system sometimes generated erroneous entries. 

 

Likewise, on Provident Fund Loan Billing Report was prepared and sent in 

December 2019. A copy of the previous years’ remittance list was requested 

from the RO to fast-track the reconciliation of the accounts. Also, the copies 

of remittance list available in the Accounting Office were only from the 

year 2016 and such limitation raised difficulty in reconciling the accounts 

of the borrowers. If provided with remittance list from the region for the 

previous years and they would find out that there are still past due loans not 

yet fully deducted, the Accounting Unit committed to take actions that these 

past due loans will be billed and collected to abide by the existing rules and 

regulations on the Provident Fund. 

 

The Division Accountant added during the Exit Conference that the 

Accounting in-Charge had difficulty identifying to which loan the 

repayments should be applied. However, he assured that Management will 

review these accounts. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

At the Exit Conference, the Regional Supervising Auditor emphasized that 

Management should ensure that the accounting system for the Provident 

Fund is properly maintained since this will affect the reliability of the 

individual borrower’s accounts. The Audit Team Leader of the Division of 

Misamis Oriental likewise responded that Management should review the 

individual past due accounts and properly tag the type of loan availed since 

per guidelines in said DepEd Order, existing loan balances should be 

deducted upon loan renewal hence, every borrower should only have a 

maximum of 2 loan accounts. 

Valencia City The Provident Fund Status Report is not the balances of loans receivable 

for the year but rather the accumulation of which is the current balance of 

the loan’s receivable. For example, the balance of 2009 of P137,480.02 

does not mean that as of December 31, 2020 that is still the balance of the 

loans receivable for the released or granted loans receivable. It means that 

for 2009 the balance of P137,480.02 was the balance which is carried on 

the next year. The report should be taken to accumulate the following year. 

We will also communicate with the RO to make the necessary adjustment 

in the format of the report to avoid confusion. We have also complied with 

the requirements in 2018 that previous loan balance shall be deducted from 

the loan application. 

 

For the past due accounts, the Accounting Section has issued demand letters 

to these employees. Some accounts were also billed by the Division if the 

salary of the employee can accommodate additional deduction to make the

account moving. For retiring employees, we have also required payment of 

Provident Loan balance before clearances are signed since 2017. 

 El Salvador Evaluation and assessment of status of all borrowers with outstanding 

provident loan balances at yearend were usually done by the Division 

Provident Fund Secretariat. On the other hand, collection of delinquent 

loans is on process 

XI ROP The   Management already issued a Memorandum addressed to the 

Accountant on February 9, 2021, directing compliance with the audit 

recommendations. 

 

b.4 Erroneous adjustments and misclassification – P51,066,142.96 

 

2.27 In NCR - SDO Caloocan, the transfer of fund to NDA amounting to 
₱9,771,559.20 was erroneously recorded as Due from NGAs instead of Due 

from GOCCs, which runs counter with Section B.5, Article II of Department 

Order No. 023. 

 

2.28 Also, deficiencies were noted in the adjustments made by the Accounting 
Section in DepEd RO V Proper to Due from Operating/Field Units account 

during the year 2020 totaling ₱41,294,583.76, which affected the reliability 

and fairness of presentation of the reported balance of the account in the 

yearend FSs. 

 

2.29 We recommended that the Management provide the necessary supporting 
documents and make the appropriate adjusting/correcting entries. 

 

2.30 The Management’s comments are as follows: 
 

RO/SDO Management’s Comments 

V - ROP Management commented that the adjustment made crediting the Cash, LCCA account amounting 

to ₱26,971,679.57 per JEV No. 01-2020-10-00567 dated October 31, 2020 were correct and 

verified. This entry pertains to the fund transfers recorded in the books without the corresponding 

bank credits and over/under recording of bank credits as shown in the Bank Statement and BRS 

as of September 20, 2020. Further, the Accumulated Surplus (Deficit) credited under the same 

JEV number was inadvertently recorded to reclassify the abnormal (credit) balance of the Due 

from OU/IUs account to Due to O/FU account to Due to O/FU account but the same will be 

adjusted in the books of account in March 2021. 

 

Also, JEV No. 01-2020-11-00614 was drawn by Management to recognize the reclassification of 

the credit balance amounting to ₱3,868,370.01 from Due from O/FU to Due to Operating Units. 

This entry was made to properly offset these accounts against each other’s balance as Intra-

Agency Receivables and Intra-Agency Payables. However, correction was already effected 

through JEV No. 01-2020-12-00737 dated December 31, 2020.  

 

Likewise, Management is truly appreciative that the Audit Team acknowledged and recognized 

their efforts in their compliance with the prior year’s audit recommendations. Management 

promised that they will continue to do their best in monitoring, analyzing, and complying with 

the guidelines and procedures to ensure the fair presentation of accounts in the FSs. 

 

c) Deficiencies affecting the reliability of Inventories account - 
₱13,451,839,950.05 

 



187 

 

c.1 Inventories directly charged to expenses account – P140,714,812.92 

 

2.31 Section 9, Chapter 8, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs provides that supplies 
and materials purchased for inventory purposes shall be recorded using the 

Perpetual Inventory Method. This method requires that regular purchases shall 

be coursed through the inventory account and issues thereof shall be recorded 

as they take place except for supplies and materials purchased out of Petty 

Cash Fund for immediate use or on emergency cases which shall be charged 

directly to the appropriate Expenses accounts.  

 

2.32 The perpetual inventory system in recording inventories was not observed in 
10 ROs. Regular purchase of various supplies in the approximate amount of 

₱140.71 million were not coursed through the Inventory account but were 

charged directly to the Expense account.  Details are shown below:

2.33 Consequently, the accuracy of the balances of the related Inventory accounts 
were affected since inventory items may not have been actually issued and 

utilized but were already recognized as expenses, and hence Inventory 

accounts were understated while the corresponding Expense accounts were 

overstated by the amount of unissued supplies and materials as at yearend. 

 

2.34 On the other hand, Section 17, Chapter 8 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, 
requires the Accounting Division/Unit and Property Division/Unit to prepare 

and/or maintain SCs and SLCs, described as follows: 
 

Supplies Ledger Card (SLC) (Appendix 57) – shall be used to record 

materials received, issued and the balance both in quantity and amount at 

any time. It shall be maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit for each 

kind of supplies and materials. The Inspection and Acceptance Report 

(IAR), Requisition Issue Slip (RIS), Report of Supplies and Materials 

Issued (RSMI), Purchase Order (PO) and DR serve as the original 

sources of information for making entries on the card. 
 

Stock Card (SC) (Appendix 58) – shall be used to record all receipts and 

issues of supplies and the balance in quantity at any time. It shall be 

maintained by the Property and/or Supply Division/Unit for each item in 

stock. The IAR, RIS, PO and DR serve as the original sources of 

information for making entries on the card.  

 

2.35 Based on validation conducted by the Audit Teams, the 67 SDOs and IUs in

2.36 The absence of duly accomplished and updated SLCs and SCs did not 
demonstrate full compliance with the applicable provisions of Sections 8, 9, 

and 17, Chapter 8 of the GAM and implies lack of consideration to the 

importance of keeping an accurate inventory record as a major component of 

an effective Inventory Management System. This likewise limited the ability 

of the Management to effectively reconcile the accounts to establish the correct 

amount of the asset. 

 

2.37 We recommended that Management: 
 

a) direct the Accountant to observe the Perpetual Inventory Method by 
recording all purchases of supplies (except purchases through petty 

cash) to the appropriate inventory accounts and recognizing expense 

upon issuance thereof to end-users; and 

 

b) require the Accountants/Bookkeepers and Property/Supply Officers 
to prepare/ update the required SLCs and SCs, respectively, to ensure 

the existence and accuracy of reported inventory items.

2.41 The unreconciled variances in both the Accounting and Property Units’ 
records were primarily due to the failure of both Offices to conduct periodic 

reconciliation of their respective records, incomplete inventory-taking by the 

Property Units, and failure of the Accounting Units to update their records 

caused by the non-preparation and non-submission of the RSMI by the 

Property Units. 
 

2.42 Unless this is acted upon by Management, the process control of reconciliation 
will remain weak that can lead to a bigger variance in ensuing financial periods 

and eventually in misstatement of the financial statements. 
 



191 

 

2.43 We recommended that Management direct both the Accountants/ 
Bookkeepers and Property/Supply Officers to update their ledger cards 

and records and perform thorough and periodic reconciliation of their 

respective reports, and make necessary adjustment for noted discrepancy 

in order to arrive at the correct balance. 
 

2.44 The Management commented as follows: 
 

Office/RO/IU Management’s Comments 

CO Management assured that the AMD and Accounting Division continue to make 

efforts in reconciling subsidiary account balances of both Offices for proper 

inventory management. Both Divisions meet quarterly to reconcile SL account 

balances. The AMD committed that they will submit adjusted Inventory Reports as 

of June 30, 2021 on July 15, 2021. 

NCR San Juan. The Management commented that all other audit findings and 

recommendations will be complied with as recommended. 

II The Accountant and Supply Officer committed to submit the reconciliation report on 

or before May 31, 2021. 

IV-A Batangas Province.   Management is amenable to the audit observations and Property 

Officer and the Accountant will comply with the audit recommendations.  

 

Quezon Province.  The Accounting Staff/ In-Charge will review the said accounts 

and provide necessary adjustment, if any.  The Supply and Property Officer agreed 

to comply with the audit recommendations. 

 

Lucena City.  The Supply Unit shall maintain SCs to facilitate inventory monitoring 

and reconciliation.    In addition, SLCs shall be maintained. 

V The Supply Officer replied that the Accounting and Supply Units will ensure that the 

SLCs and SCs will be updated and that said property records will be reconciled on or 

before April 30, 2021. 

VIII The Management agreed to comply with the audit recommendation. 

 

ROP. The designated Supply Officer shall undertake a thorough review of the RPCI 

and RSMI as of December 31, 2020 for all accounts to ensure accuracy on actual 

inventories and the figures indicated in the RPCI and ensure the same are presented 

during the agreed Workshop with the Accounting Office for reconciliation of records.  

It must likewise be noted that in accordance with the Operations Manual of the AMS, 

all deliveries are issued to the end-users within 24 hours from receipt, hence 

inventories stated in the RPCI is of minimal value. 

XI Procedural guidelines attached in the Regional Memorandum in reconstituting the 

Regional Inventory Committee (RIC) also includes the physical count of inventory 

items and sub-committee was created solely for this purpose. 

 

c.3 Misclassified Inventory Accounts – P4,160,507.00 
 

2.45 The Audit Teams noted that there were erroneous journal entries wherein the 
accounts used are not the correct ones based on the RCA, resulting in 

misclassification of accounts within the same account class. Although there is 

no effect on the ending balance of Inventory accounts, the misclassification 

will somehow affect the comparability of the financial statements for the 

current and prior years. The following are the misclassifications identified in 

the audit:

2.49 We recommended that Management require the Accountants to verify the 
cause/s of dormant or non-moving inventories or create a special team 

that will investigate the composition and details of the static/slow turnover 

of inventories. 
 

2.50 The Management’s comments, together with the Auditor’s Rejoinder, are as 
follows: 

 
Office/RO Management’s Comments 

V Albay.  Management said that the concerned units have committed to conduct a periodic 

reconciliation of the Ledger Cards and SCs and committed to submit a reconciled report on 

or before September 30, 2021. 

 

Legaspi. Management commented that said textbooks were issued to the school teachers 
little by little by subject and by grade level, hence decided to effect the recordings in the 

books after all textbooks have been issued. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

The Audit Team advised the Accountant to effect the recordings in the books every time 

there is issuance and/or RSMI is received from the Supply Officer. This practice ensures 

proper and updated records of the account and will not make it dormant. 

VIII Calbayog City. The Management assured that the reconciliation will be conducted within 

the prescribed period and it has required both the Supply Officer and Accountant the status 

report on the conduct of the reconciliation for proper monitoring and compliance thereat. 

 

c.5 Non-conduct/Partial and/or Deficient conduct of physical count 
 

2.51 Section 13, Chapter 8 of the GAM, Volume I, states that “Physical 
count/inventory, which is required semi-annually, is an indispensable 

procedure for checking the integrity of property custodianship.” 
 

2.52 One of the objectives of physical count is to determine whether the assets 
actually exist as at yearend and that they are actually owned by the Agency. 

 

2.53 The Report on the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) shall be used to report 
the physical count of the supplies by type of inventory at a given date. It shows 

the balance of inventory items per card and per count and shortage/overage, if 

any. These include the semi-expendable property wherein the issue is covered 

by ICS. 
 

2.54 For CY 2020, the 42 SDOs and IUs in nine ROs failed to conduct physical 
inventory-taking or has conducted one but the same is deficient or partial, 

contrary to Section 13, Chapter 8 of the GAM for NGAs, to wit:

2.55 The failure to conduct physical count of inventories resulted in non-submission 
of RPCI as well as cast doubts as to the correctness and existence of the 

inventories recorded in the Agency’s books of accounts. 
 

2.56 In like manner, the following 27 SDO/IUs in six ROs did not submit the RPCI 
to their respective Audit Teams, hence construed as no physical inventory was 

undertaken, to wit:

2.57 On the other hand, ROP and Northern Samar DO of Regions VI and VIII, 
respectively, were not able to submit the RPCI despite the conduct of physical 

inventory-taking. 
  

2.58 We recommended that Management require the Property/Supply Units 
or Inventory Committee to conduct timely and complete physical count of 

inventories semi-annually and prepare/submit the RPCI, complete with 

the needed data/information, not later than July 31 and January 31 of 

each year for the first and second semesters, respectively. 
 

2.59 The Management commented as follows: 



195 

 

 
Office/RO/IU Management’s Comments 

III Gapan City, Tarlac Province and Science City of Muñoz. The Management of the 

Division Offices, San Nicolas High School and Muñoz NHS Main and Annex agreed 

to comply with the recommendations during the Exit Conference. 

IV-A Quezon Province.  The Accounting Staff/ In-Charge will review the said accounts 

and provide necessary adjustment, if any.  The Supply and Property Officer agreed 

to comply with the audit recommendations. 

 

Calamba Bayside Integrated School, Camp Vicente Lim Integrated School, Eduardo 

Barretto, Sr. NHS, Looc Integrated School, Makiling Integrated School, Punta 

Integrated School. Management expressed apology on the non-submission of the 

RPCI and assured that this will not happen again in the future. The following schools 

already submitted their RPCI in compliance with the audit recommendations: 

Calamba Bayside Integrated School       -03/15/21 

Eduardo Barretto Sr. NHS                      -03/15/21 

Makiling Integrated School                    -03/16/21                   

V ROP.  Management agreed to comply with the recommendation. 

 

Camarines Norte.  Management explained that the incomplete Inventory Report was 

due to the delayed submission of Report on Inventories from Non-Implementing 

Schools for integration in the Division’s RPCI. They will revisit the composition of 

Inventory Committee that would facilitate the inventory-taking and proper recording 

of asset accounts. 

 

Iriga City.  The Agency assured that the actual inventory will be done and a complete 

and correct RPCI for the 1st semester of FY 2021 will be submitted to the Audit Team 

on or before July 31, 2021. 

 

Masbate Province. The Supply Officer assured that the Inventory Committee will 

conduct physical count of the inventory items this coming April 2021. 

 

Masbate City.  Management commented that the conduct of physical count of 

inventories is already in process. 

VIII San Jose Technical HS and Silvino Lubos Vocational HS.  Management agreed to 

comply with the recommendation. 

X Management stated that both the Supply Unit and Accounting Unit will comply with 

the recommendation through a meeting to draw  a physical inventory plan and 

pledged to implement the conduct of physical count twice a year before the 

preparation of RPCI. 

XI Davao City. In their letter-reply dated March 10, 2021, the Division Property and 

Supply Officer   explained that they could hardly consolidate, prepare and submit the 

RPCI and the RPCPPE every Semester on July 31st of the preceding month and 

January 31st of the succeeding year because of non-submission of the reports of their 

counterpart from the field offices despite the issuance of the Division Memorandum. 

However, the Division Property and Supply Officer requested for consideration to 

submit and finalize their reports before March 31, 2021 since they are still waiting 

for the other schools to submit their reports and validate the same for consolidation. 

 

Digos City. The Management explained that the failure to submit the RPCI was due 

to the difficulty in fixing the schedule of inventory to the teachers being issued with 

expendable items due to the skeletal work which is once a week only. Further, there 

were newly delivered items from Central Office that were not yet encoded in the 

RPCI. The Management, through the Administrative Officer, Mr.  Harry Obenza, 

will closely monitor the Supply Office as to compliance with RPCI within this month. 

 

Mati City. The Management affirmed the audit observation and commits to regularly 

reconcile the SLCs and the SCs of the Accountant and the Supply Officer, 

respectively. The Management also explained that the Division Property/Supply 

Officer was not able to submit the yearend RPCI because he was quarantined for two 

weeks after his travel from the NCR and due to time constraint, he was not able to 



196 

 

Office/RO/IU Management’s Comments 

conduct the actual count of inventories in the DO and was not able to monitor the 

RPCI from the schools. 

 

Tagum City. In a letter-reply, the Management explained that the Supply Officer 

failed to prepare the RPCI due to the imposition of lockdowns or the newly 

designated Supply/Property Officer was not yet knowledgeable of the required 

reports.  However, the Management committed to submit immediately the lacking 

 RPCI. 

 

IGACOS. The Management explained that the Inspectorate Committee has conducted 

the physical count, however, due to the outbreak of the pandemic, said RPCI was not 

submitted to COA Office.  During the Exit Conference, the Bookkeeper informed the 

Audit Team that the RPCI was already submitted. 

 

c.6 Non/Delayed-preparation/submission of RSMI 
 

2.60 Section 17, Chapter 8 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, prescribes the records, 
forms and reports to be used, such as the RSMI. It shall be prepared by the 

Property and/or Supply Custodian based on the RIS and shall be used by the 

Accounting Division/Unit as basis in preparing the JEV to record the supplies 

and materials issued. 
 

2.61 The Audit Teams observed that in 40 SDO/IUs in nine ROs, the RSMIs were 
not prepared/submitted regularly or incurred delays in submission by the 

Property/Supply Office to the Accounting Office, hence the latter has no basis 

to prepare the JEV for the issuances made or was not able to make timely 

recognition of expenses in the books. Details are presented below:

2.65 We recommended that Management improve the Inventory Management 
System by implementing/adopting transactional controls in the receipt, 

custody, and disposal of the goods purchased/received as provided in the 

GAM for NGAs and improve coordination between the Property/Supply 

and the Accounting Offices. 

 

2.66 The Management’s comments, together with the Auditor’s Rejoinder, are as 
follows: 

 
Office/RO/IU Management’s Comments 

V ROP. Management commented that the Accounting Section had already adjusted all the 

semi-expendable inventories per JEV No. 01-2016-09-00653 in 2016. Also, the PPELCs 

maintained by the Accounting Section for semi-expendable properties were currently 

recorded and transferred to the SLC.  Consequently, the Supply Section had started 

updating the Inventory Report for CY 2021 to change the account names to conform to 

the RCA updated as of 2019. Also, the Inventory Report on Semi-Expendable properties 

for CY 2020 was already submitted to the Audit Team on January 28, 2021. 

 

SDO Ligao City.  Management said that since there was no sufficient storage space at the 

DO for the 78,250 reams of printing supplies that it procured, it identified five drop-off 

points to expedite the delivery, in-house printing and distribution of the self- learning 

modules. The Riso-equipment supplied by the City Government of Ligao were 

strategically distributed to accessible locations to expedite the release of modules to 

learners. Further, Management said that the distribution of the printing supplies was duly 

supported with distribution lists and acknowledgement receipt by recipient schools. To 

require the supplier to deliver and unload the 78,250 reams of coupon bonds at the DO 

may pose great risk in the distribution to the different schools and may compromise the 

timely release of Self-Learning Modules (SLMs) to learners. So far, Management added, 

that the quarter requirements for the modules was overall successful considering that the 

DO was able to provide SLM at a rate of 1 is to 1.

Office/RO/IU Management’s Comments 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 
 

The Audit Team commends the strategy adopted by SDO-Ligao City in the handling, 

distribution and utilization of procured printing supplies. The results were indeed 

laudable considering the timely and the ratio of 1 is to 1 distribution of modules to the 

beneficiaries. The Audit Team’s concern, however, was only to preserve the required 

transaction trails as manifested thru appropriate accounting and audit evidential matters. 

Evidence of due inspection and acceptance by duly reconstituted inspectorate team and 

accepting officer, respectively, are among the substantial documents of the procurement. 

 

d) Deficiencies affecting the reliability of the Other Assets accounts 
 

2.67 The following errors and deficiencies were disclosed in the audit of accounts 
under Other Assets which cast doubt on the correctness and validity of the 

reported balances in the FSs.  
Table 26: Summary of Deficiencies in the Other Current Asset Accounts 

Office/RO Audit Observations Amount 

Recording of liquidations in the books of accounts not yet submitted for audit  

NCR Verification of the GL in SDO-Mandaluyong revealed that 

various liquidations with an aggregate amount of 

₱1,785,035.79 under the account Advances for Operating 

Expenses were recorded in CY 2020. However, the 

corresponding LRs and their supporting documents were not 

submitted for audit, hence the validity and propriety of the 

said liquidations could not be ascertained and audit thereof 

could not be undertaken.  

Thus, delayed/non-submission of these LRs precluded the 

timely conduct of the audit and consequently prevented the 

early detection and correction of errors and deficiencies as 

well as the timely reporting of the audit results to the 

Management. 

1,785,035.79  

Lack/Absence of detailed information and supporting documents on unliquidated cash advances 

CO It was noted in the SL balances of Advances to SDO and OE 

accounts the existence of OSEC Trust account amounting to 

₱12,747,932.91 and ₱313,266.94, respectively, or a total of 

₱13,061,199.85, which rendered the Advances account 

balances unreliable. Based on Accounting Division, the 

balance comprises of prior year accounts tagged with various 

offices and funds, which were charged against OSEC trust 

account without supporting schedules showing the detailed 

information on the CAs granted and settlements made. Thus, 

accountabilities and persons granted with CAs under the trust 

account could not be determined. 

13,061,199.85  

VIII Verification disclosed that SL/Schedules nor Aging of these 

unliquidated CAs granted to Special Disbursing Officers, and 

Contractors were not prepared nor submitted as an output to 

support the reliability of the reported balance. The 

SL/Schedule should contain information as to the name, office 

address, contact number/email address of the 

debtor/creditor/contact person in case of agency/company. 

The said balance could not be ascertained for lack of details 

as to the name of the debtor/creditor/contact person who were 

granted cash advances and advance payment for the 

contractor’s mobilization expenses. Thus, cast doubt as to the 

   9,917,664.18

accuracy and validity of the reported balance in the Statement 

of Financial Position as of December 31, 2020. 

X Review of the LRs of various public elementary and 

secondary schools in SDO Cagayan de Oro submitted to the 

Audit Team disclosed that 145 POs at an aggregate amount of 

₱20,767,295.73 have no details as to mode of procurement, 

date and place of delivery, and delivery and payment terms 

indicated therein. The lacking information could have been 

useful in calculating the liquidated damages to be paid by the 

suppliers had they incurred delay in delivering to the school 

the items they are bound to deliver. 

20,767,295.73  

Non-submission/Incomplete submission of supporting documents to the Audit Team  

CAR The Report of Disbursements together with the paid payrolls, 

vouchers, and supporting documents of the reported 

liquidations of cash advances granted were not submitted for 

audit, contrary to prescribed rules and regulations. 

4,750,793.68  

VII Most of the hard copies GL and SLs presented herein were 

only turned over in CY 2019 when the Audit Team already 

got hold of significant volumes of source documents covering 

all the audited cash advances as well as liquidations thereof. 

In fact, different Accountants gave the certification on said 

books of final entry. 

 

As observed, the Accounting Unit merely maintains soft 

copies of the said records. As such, it was not part of the 

practice to turn over to the Audit Team, hard copies of the 

GLs and SLs. 

 

The omission in the turn-over for audit, as part of the 

Agency’s accounts, of hard copies of GLs and SLs did not 

make possible for the Audit Team, the proving of any instance 

of manipulation of said records through alteration of postings 

thereon. As such, the cash examination relied substantially on 

source documents as basis of the AO’s accountabilities like 

Disbursement Vouchers (DVs) and Payrolls together with 

their respective supporting papers

Conduct of audit on its financial activities was precluded and

X Verification of LiNHS documents disclosed that cash 

advances for the payroll of JO personnel were not attached as 

part of the Report of Checks Issued (RCI) for the month of 

September 2020. Instead, the DV, Obligation Requests and 

Status (ORS) and JEV were included, with the supporting 

documents, on the LR of that AO. The same documents were 

attached on the liquidation of the AO for the March 2020 

payroll but copies were attached to the RCI sans any 

supporting documents.

126,945.00  

Disbursements for Cash Advances were not recorded in the Cash Disbursements Record.  

XI The staff of Davao Del Sur Division assigned in the 

preparation of the CDRec reasoned that it was difficult to 

prepare the CDRec because she does not have the knowledge 

on all cash advances and payments made by the AO. 

558,802.79  

Inquiry with the AO of SDO of Davao Occidental mentioned 

that he was not familiar with the said record although he 

always coordinates with the Accounting Office to monitor 

what are his unliquidated cash advances and the only 

reference he has was the LRs to monitor his liquidation. 

249,500.00  

Discrepancies in the reported balance of Advances   

NCR Review of the consolidated FSs of SDO- Paranaque as at 

yearend revealed that the total balance of the Advances 

accounts totaling ₱19,553,101.02 differed from the 

schedules reported/submitted to the Audit Team of 

₱16,787,618.43, leaving a difference of ₱2,765,482.59. 

2,765,482.59  

Likewise, a variance of ₱416,257.40 was observed in SDO- 

Mandaluyong between the submitted Status Report vis-a-vis 

the balance reported in the Statement of Financial Position as 

of December 31, 2020. The variance was due to unrecorded 

grants and liquidation of CAs. 

416,257.40  

VIII The reported balances of the Advances for Payroll per 

Statement of Financial Position as of December 31, 2020 

under the Regular Fund and Status of Unliquidated Cash 

Advances (SUCA) submitted by the office cannot be relied 

upon since they are not the same with those per the SL Per 

Payee of one employee amounting to ₱33,683,013.25.

Difference between the balance per GL and SL  

NCR Comparison made by the Audit Team of SDO-San Juan on the 

balances between the GL and SL submitted by the Accounting 

Unit revealed there existed a difference in the Advances 

accounts totaling ₱182,061.32. Hence, non-reconciliation 

between the GL and SL balances affected the accuracy of the 

recorded balances. 

182,061.32  

IV-A Review of Advances to Officers and Employees and 

Advances for Operating Expenses account revealed that GL 

and SL balances were not reconciled, resulting in a 

discrepancy of ₱1,226,401.65.  

1,226,401.65  

VIII There were instances of unrecorded transactions per GL but 

recorded in the SL or vice-versa. Such cover significant 

amounts of granted CAs and liquidations. Yet the Accounting 

Unit was disclosed to have permitted these deficiencies as 

they cover transactions from January 1, 2013 to October 2017 

pertaining to all the audited Cash Advance Funds. As of 

October 2017, both GLs and SLs are unreconciled in terms of 

balances and entries for the AO’s accountabilities. In fact, all 

SLs are without beginning and ending balances and these 

defects continue as well as uncorrected.

wherein expenses are considered as such once incurred. Also, 

this is contradictory to the mandate about recording of all 

expenses during the year when incurred. 

Non-reconciliation of amount between JEVs and SLs  

X In the audit of the 2019 liquidations of the SBFP Cash 

Advances of the DepEd Misamis Occidental Division, it was 

observed that the liquidations reflected in the JEVs did not 

reconcile with the amounts posted in each of the AO’s SL, 

resulting in a discrepancy of at least ₱21,910.00. It is to be 

noted that two (2) of the liquidations are still in the process of 

checking. Upon inquiry, it was revealed that the postings to 

the SLs were based on the Cash Disbursement Records 

(CDRs) submitted by the AOs which accounted the over-

liquidations or expenses in excess of the CAs. However, such 

excesses were excluded in the journal entries. 

21,910.00  

Erroneous classification of accounts  

NCR In SDO-Caloocan, CAs granted for the implementation of the 

School-Based Feeding Program for SY 2020-2021 were 

erroneously recorded in the books as Advances for Operating 

Expenses. However, the School-Based Feeding Program, 

being a specific time-bound activity, would consequently 

necessitate that the said advances be recorded as Advances to 

Special Disbursing Officer.

b) prepare the breakdown/Schedule of UCAs charged in the OSEC Trust

a write-off on the UCAs that remained non-moving for ten years or 

more in the books according to COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated 

December 9, 2016, duly supported with required documents;  

 

c) require the Accountants/Bookkeepers to review the completeness of 
DVs and their supporting documents before processing the CAs. 

Hence, immediately submit the lacking supporting documents; 

 

d) instruct the AOs to prepare the Cash Disbursements Record as 
prescribed under the GAM for NGAs;  

 

e) instruct the Accountants/Bookkeepers to prepare/maintain/update SL 
for each AO/Head of School/concerned grantee of the CAs and exhaust 

all possible courses of action to reconcile the balances reported in the 

GL, SL and schedule submitted;  

 

f) determine the erroneous postings and make the necessary adjusting 
entries to correct the account balance observing the use of appropriate 

accounts in the recording of CAs as prescribed in the GAM for NGAs, 

Volumes I and III; 

 

g) instruct AOs to utilize the CA solely for the specific legal purpose for 
which it was granted and refrain from reimbursing claims made prior 

to the date when the CA was granted; and 

 

h) exert more effort to determine the specific details of the Other Assets 
account, and adhere strictly to the provisions in recording and keeping 

of accounts as stated under Section 111(1) of PD No. 1445.

2.69 The Management comments and the corresponding Auditor’s rejoinder are as 
follows: 

 
Office/RO Management Comments Auditor’s Rejoinder 

Lack/Absence of detailed information and supporting documents on unliquidated cash advances 

CO The Management commented that  the 

Accounting Division is already preparing the 

documentary requirements to write-off 

outstanding accounts of  prior years including 

the P13,061,199.85 balances mentioned in the 

audit observation. 

 

VIII The Accountant III disclosed that they already 

required the copy of SLs from the fields for 

each AO. They are just waiting for the 

completion of reports for submission to COA, 

in compliance with the recommendation.  

 

Non-submission/Incomplete submission of supporting documents to the Audit Team 

VIII Management has submitted already the said 

liquidations but some CAs remain 

unliquidated up to this time. DVs for PS and 

MOOE for December were submitted already 

The Audit Team will  check and 

verify all submitted liquidations 

and audit working papers will 

be prepared to account all 

unliquidated CAs as well as 

submitted DVs for PS and 

MOOE as of end of December 

2020. A Notice of Suspension 

(NS) will be issued for non-

submission of paid DVs and 

Payrolls and non-submission of 

LRs. 

X In its letter-reply dated February 4, 2021, 

LiNHS Management called the attention of 

the Bookkeeper and instructed her to 

thoroughly review documents for CA as stated 

in the COA Circular No. 2012-001 and to 

properly record the transaction. The AO was 

also instructed to attach complete and proper 

documents required and record CAs as per 

COA Circular No. 2012-001. 

 

XI The Management assured the Audit Team that 

the lacking supporting documentary 

requirements will be submitted to the Office 

of the Auditor and they shall ensure that future 

transactions out of CA will be supported with 

the required documents.   

The Audit Team   has   yet   to   

validate   the implementation of 

the recommendation for the CY 

2021 operations.  

The Schools’ Management had already 

instructed the Bookkeepers for the immediate 

submission of the lacking documents but 

requested that they will be given more time 

since   they   had   difficulty   in gathering the 

documents because of the current pandemic 

situation.  The Management will look into the 

said LRs and will double check their 

supporting documents as soon as the School 

opens since it is being used as a COVID-19 

isolation facility. The Management assured 

that future transactions will be supported with 

complete documentary requirements and they 

committed to observe the audit

recommendations in order to correct the 

deficiency. 

The Management   admitted   the deficiency 

and agreed to support all subsequent 

disbursements from CAs for special   

purpose/undertaking with duly accomplished 

disbursement vouchers/payrolls/petty cash 

vouchers.  

The Audit Team duly noted 

Management’s comment as it 

shall continuously monitor 

Management’s actions on this 

particular observation to ensure 

proper implementation of the 

audit recommendations. 

Disbursements for Cash Advances were not recorded in the Cash Disbursements Record 

XI  The AO submitted the Report of Cash 

Disbursements (Appendix   41) for the period 

covered January 1 to December 31, 2018, 

January 1 to December 31, 2019, and January 

1 to December 31, 2020 on February 2, 2021. 

The Audit Team reminded the 

Management that the required 

document is the Cash 

Disbursements Record 

(Appendix 40), which is 

different from the submitted 

report of the AO. The Report of 

Cash Disbursements is used for 

the liquidation of cash advances 

while the Cash Disbursements 

Record provides the list of all 

the cash advances, their 

liquidations and the running 

balance of the CAs of the AO. 

Hence, the Audit Team 

reiterated the submission of the 

Cash Disbursements Record. 

XI During the Exit Conference, the Management 

informed the Audit Team that the required 

records have already been submitted to the 

COA Office. 

The Audit Team appreciated the 

commitment by the 

Management and will evaluate 

the submitted documents for 

further verification and audit. 

Difference between the balance per GL and SL 

NCR As regards the unreconciled balance between 

the GL and SL, Management will 

recommunicate to SDO-Pasig for the possible 

turnover of files. 

 

IV-A The Division Accountant will reconcile 

regularly the GL and SL balances for timely 

adjustments of discrepancies/ errors for 

accurate and fair presentation of FSs and 

conduct an extensive analysis, verification 

and evaluation of the discrepancies/difference 

between the GL and SLs.  Delay in the process 

of the aforementioned reports was due to the 

ongoing outbreak of the Coronavirus 2019 

(COVID-19), which was recently declared as 

a pandemic by the World Health Organization 

and this also resulted due to the issuance of 

DepEd Order No. 11, s. 2020 by the 

Department of Education stating that there 

will be an alternative work arrangement for 

the Department. Because of this, the 

Accountant, with the help of her staff in 

charge of cash advances, had difficulty 

reconciling the past years’ discrepancy while 

keeping up with the bulk of daily transactions 

in the situation of a pandemic. 

 

Non-reconciliation of amount between JEVs and SLs 

X The Management commented that the amount 

of CA is the full amount reversed in the JEV

Office/RO Management Comments Auditor’s Rejoinder 

to record maximum allowed amount the 

schools should spend, and that if they spent 

less, they will be required to return the 

remaining amount for deposit to BTr. 

Nonetheless, they assured that adjustments on 

the SLs have been made to reconcile the SLs 

and the JEVs and that the same will be 

implemented in future liquidations. 

Erroneous classification of accounts 

NCR Management of SDO-Navotas informed the 

Audit Team, in its letter dated March 30, 

2021, that total CAs amounting to 

₱132,840.00 was already liquidated as of 

March 2021 under JEV Nos. 01-2021-03-

00410 to 00414 and 01-2021-03-00423 where 

the remaining unliquidated amount of 

P6,002.00 was properly adjusted, thereafter, 

to the appropriate Advances to Special 

Disbursing Officer account under JEV No. 

01-2021-03-00452. 

 

The erroneous account was already liquidated 

and closed in the FSs of SDO-Valenzuela as 

of March 9, 2021.  For the succeeding 

transactions, Management will observe the 

use of appropriate accounts in the recording of 

CAs as prescribed in the Revised Chart of 

Accounts, Volume III of the GAM for NGAs. 

 

Cash Advances were used to pay payrolls and other operating expenses 

VIII All CAs from prior years which were charged 

as Advances for Operating Expenses were 

liquidated and no subsequent CA was made to 

personnel unless prior CAs were fully 

liquidated. Management has a monthly a 

report submitted to COAI on a monthly basis 

to monitor the status of CAs. 

 

XI Management assured that such deficiency will 

never happen again. 

The Audit Team acknowledged 

Management’s explanation on 

the matter and will continue to 

monitor the implementation of 

such recommendations. 

Other Deficiencies noted 

CAR SDO-Kalinga had already started to determine 

the specific details of the Other Assets 

account. 

 

XI During the Exit Conference, the Accountant 

admitted that some of the Special Disbursing 

Officers usually deviate from their budgeted 

amounts to the actual disbursements.  He also 

reminded 

the School Heads to make sure that their 

monthly MOOE requests must be in line with 

the schools’ Work and Financial Plan and 

Annual Procurement Plan since it will be the 

basis for the schools’ disbursements. 

The Audit Team maintains that 

it is crucial for the Disbursing 

Officer/School Head to utilize 

the monthly CA in accordance 

with the purposes for which 

they were granted to avoid 

incurring disbursements 

without allotted budget as at 

yearend. Such practice exposes 

the funds to misuse, hence may 

be subject to further audit 

action. 

XI The excess of the obligated amounts which 

were not released to the Schools remained 

unexpended as at yearend. NORSAs will be 

submitted to the Office of the Auditor to prove 

 



208 

 

Office/RO Management Comments Auditor’s Rejoinder 

that adjustments were made to the amounts 

initially obligated.    

XI Management assured that such deficiency will 

never happen again.

the matter and will continue to 

monitor the implementation of 

such recommendations.

School’s Property Custodian accepts the delivered items and signs IAR and 

Certificate of Final Acceptance (CFA), together with the school teacher, as 

witness. The DepEd CO, thru the supplier, issues two copies of PTR signed by 

DepEd CO Chief Administrative Officer as Approving Officer and received 

by the Division School’s Property Custodian. The 2nd copy of the PTR is kept 

by the Division School’s Property Custodian. Aside from the fact that the

2.78 We recommended that the Management: 
 

a) instruct the Property Custodians to furnish the Accounting Offices 
with copies of all the documents related to the delivered equipment as 

basis of the recording; and 

 

b) make representation with DepEd CO to furnish the SDOs or IUs with 
copies of the JEV for proper recording of the transferred equipment 

in the book of accounts. 

 

Non-compliance with the pertinent rules and regulations with respect to PPE 

 

2.79 Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, provides the following: 
 

“Section 38. Physical Count of the PPE. The entity shall have a periodic 

physical count of PPE, which shall be done annually and presented on the 

Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment as at 

December 31 of each year. This shall be submitted to the Auditor concerned 

not later than January 31 of the following year. Equipment found at station 

and losses discovered during the physical count shall be reported to the 

Accounting Division/Unit for proper accounting/recording. 
 

xxx 
 

Section 42.Accounting and Property Records to be maintained for PPE. The 

Chief Accountant shall maintain the PPE Ledger Cards (PPELC) for each 

category of PPE xxx. The PPELC shall be kept to record promptly the 

acquisition, description, custody, estimated useful life, depreciation, 

impairment loss, disposal and other information about the asset. For check 

and balance, the Property and Supply Office/Unit shall likewise maintain 

Property Cards (PC) for PPE in their custody to account for the receipt and 

disposition of the same. The balance per PC shall be reconciled with 

PPELC maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit. They shall also be 

reconciled with other property records like the PAR.” 
 

2.80 Volume II of the GAM for NGAs provides the following forms and reports 
necessary to account for PPE: 

 

Appendix 69, Property Card, this card shall be used by the Supply and/or 

Property Division/Unit to record the description, acquisition, transfer, 



216 

 

disposal, and other information about the PPE. It shall be kept for each class 

of PPE. 
 

Appendix 70, Property, Plant and Equipment Ledger Card, this card shall 

be used for each class of PPE to record the acquisition, description, custody, 

estimated life, depreciation, impairment, disposal, transfer/adjustment, 

repair history and other information about the property. It shall be kept and 

maintained by the Accounting Office/Unit. 

 

Appendix 72, prescribed the use of Registry of Heritage Asset, which is 

used to record and monitor heritage assets owned by the agency/entity 

which are not recognized in the books of accounts. It shall be maintained by 

the Accounting Division/Unit and kept in a perpetual manner. 
 

Appendix 73, Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and 

Equipment, this form shall be used to report the physical count and 

condition of PPE by type as at a given date, including those which are 

unrecorded and those which could not be accounted for. It shows the 

balance of PPE per property cards and per count and the shortage/overage, 

if any. It shall be rendered by the Inventory Committee, on its yearly 

physical count of properties owned by the entity. 
 

Appendix 77, Construction in Progress Ledger Card (CIPLC), this form 

shall be kept in the Accounting Division/Unit for each project. The 

Accounting staff in charge in maintaining the CIPLC shall record promptly 

the construction costs and other information about the asset constructed, 

transactions shall be posted promptly based from the source documents.

following deficiencies (See Annex C):

2.82 The omission to maintain the PCs, and deficient RPCPPE and PARs 
contributed largely to the agencies’ failure to reconcile the PPE accounts 

balances per Accounting records and per Property records. 

 



217 

 

2.83 Moreover, most of the observations are reiteration of the previous years’ 
findings on the PPE accounts. The Management’s inaction to address the noted 

discrepancy and failure to comply with the requirements of existing 

regulations, particularly the conduct of complete physical inventory and 

preparation of RPCPPE exposed the unaccounted government assets to the risk 

of loss. Reconciliation of records is of paramount importance to ensure that the 

PPEs recorded in the books of the Divisions and Schools actually exist.

PPELC and PC, and conduct regular reconciliation between 

Accounting and Property records to facilitate adjustments; 

 

b) conduct appraisal of the Gabaldon Buildings and instruct the

of ownership of the Land within their possession and custody to 

establish ownership and recognition in their respective books, and to 

facilitate the transfer and registration of ownership with the Register 

of Deeds, in accordance with Section 58 of PD No. 1445 and Section 3 

(c), Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM on the Criteria for Recognition, 

to protect the interest of the schools concerned; 

 

d) require the Supply/Property Officers to:  
 

i. report in the IIRUP all unserviceable properties of the Division 
including those that are included in the RPCPPE and 

prepare/submit the IIRUP and a revised RPCPPE; 

 

ii. cause the immediate disposal of all unserviceable properties, in 
consonance with Section 79 of PD No. 1445; and 

 

iii. based from the IIRUP, direct the Accountants to drop from the 
books the unserviceable assets upon disposal; 

 

e) conduct training/seminar as well as information dissemination 
regarding property disposal and properties for demolition and 

instruct the Accounting Division to derecognize with complete 

supporting documents in the books the amount of the disposed school 

buildings; and 

 

f) ensure strict compliance by the Accountants/Bookkeepers with the 
requirements and procedures prescribed in the recording of PPE and 

provide Accumulated Depreciation for all depreciable assets of the 

SDOs in the regions to reflect the true balance of affected accounts in 

the financial statements and disclose required additional information

Office/RO Management’s Comments 

NCR, CAR, I, 

II, IV-A, VI, 

VII, X, and 

XIII. 

Management agreed with the audit recommendations. 

 

Taguig/Pateros: The Accounting Unit started the reconstruction of the PPE SL in 

order to reconcile with Property records. The noted discrepancies between the two 

records cannot be easily adjusted due to various challenges/issues/problems/gaps. 

 

Ilocos Sur: Management informed the Audit Team that the Division Accountant and 

the Supply Officer have already started reconciling the unreconciled account balances 

based on the available records filed in their office. 



219 

 

Office/RO Management’s Comments 

 

Cabuyao: Management commented that upon checking from the Central Office the 

OR/CR of both vehicles are still in process hence the properties could still not be 

recognized in the books. 

III Management agreed with the audit recommendations. 

 

ROP: Out of the 17 items of PPE, eight have been reconciled, two are for transfer 

JEV, one for physical count, one for adjustment, two to be recognized, and three for 

reconciliation. 

 

A list of PPE recorded in the books of NEAP was provided to the Property Office to 

serve as guide in the preparation of revised RPCPPE by category. 

IV-B Marinduque: The Schools Division Superintendent issued a Special Order on March 

10, 2021 for the creation of Inventory Committee. Supply Services and Accounting 

Sections were also advised to facilitate the reconciliation of their respective reports. 

V Sorsogon Province: Management commented that they are still updating the IIRUP to 

determine the exact properties that are to be disposed of. 

 

Sorsogon City: Management commented that the Supply Officer is already preparing 

the updated IIRUP which shall be the basis by the Accountant to book up the 

unserviceable properties. As to the disposal of said unserviceable properties they will 

create a Disposal Committee to speed up their disposal. 

VIII Management committed to comply with audit recommendations. 

 

ROP: Management commented that recommendations of the Audit Team shall be 

complied with by the Supply Office. It must be noted that the Inventory Committee 

has already been created and is about to undertake inventory-taking in accordance 

with the procedure provided for in COA Circular No. 2020-006 dated January 31, 

2020.  Reconciliation of records with the Accounting Section shall be done thru a 

quarterly reconciliation/workshop to be conducted this year. 

 

Southern Leyte/Ormoc City: The Management is in the process of determining the 

ownership of the lots of schools and will give their best effort to have copies of 

documents that would determine the owner of the lots.  

 

Northern Samar: The Accountant III explained that they are maintaining soft copies 

of PPELCs from CY 2015 onwards. However, due to lack of personnel, maintenance 

of said records are done at yearend. She admitted that it will be difficult to maintain 

a separate set of PPE records per fund since they only started maintaining separate 

records in CY 2018. 

 

Baybay National HS: Efforts were exerted last year to conduct inventory on the PPE 

of the school but was later postponed due to pandemic. Records were retrieved but 

incomplete. However, the Inventory Committee will conduct a meeting with proper 

authorities on the evaluation of PPE to come up with accurate valuation of assets. 

XI The Management concurs in the audit observation and commits to reconcile 

periodically the Property Ledger Cards of the Accounting Units with the Property 

Cards and Property Acknowledgement Receipts (PAR) maintained by the 

Property/Supply Officer. They also commit to fast-track the actual physical count in 

schools in order to complete the RPCPPE and in order to establish a more accurate 

property record. The Accountant, on the other hand, shall follow up the requested JEV 

and other documents from DPWH in order to have a reliable basis of the valuation of 

the constructed buildings and school buildings in the accounting records. 



220 

 

Office/RO Management’s Comments 

XII DOP: The Management commented that the accumulated PPE amounts were based 

on the paid DVs processed in the Accounting Unit (AU), but reconciliation is yet to 

be made until the Property Officer furnishes the AU with its Physical Count Report.

2.88 We recommended that the Management: 

 

a) establish and maintain SLs for these accounts, which should contain 
details or breakdown of the balances of the controlling account 

appearing in the GL as prescribed under Sections 111 and 114 of PD 

No. 1445 and Appendix 6 of the GAM for NGAs; 

 

b) direct the Accountant and other responsible personnel to verify, 
analyze, and reconcile the prior years’ balance and effect adjustments, 

where necessary; 

 

c) conduct regular reconciliation of records and adopt measures to 
prevent the recurrence of any difference; 

 

d) review thoroughly the transactions involving the liability accounts 
with abnormal/debit balances and, thereafter, effect the necessary 

adjusting entries to reflect the correct balance of the payable 

accounts; and 



222 

 

 

e) draw the necessary adjustment/s for all accounting errors made in 
recording the transactions to arrive at the accurate balance of affected 

Payables accounts. 

 

2.89 The Management commented as follows: 
 

Office/RO Management’s Comments 

CO The Management had requested time extension to submit their comments to enable 

them to properly coordinate responses from the concerned offices, prepare necessary 

documents and gather relevant information in order to appropriately address the 

observations and recommendations. 

I-Ilocos Norte The Accountant explained that the unreconciled balances pertain to beginning balance 

and she needs more time to validate the recorded amounts. 

III-ROP Management commented that they are still in the process of analyzing the Other 

Payables account of the Trust Fund. 

 

The subject unreliable balances of Due to BIR, Due to GSIS, Due to Pag-IBIG and 

Due to PhilHealth of regular fund book have been analyzed and that the corresponding 

adjusting journal entries are being prepared and will be recorded, accordingly. 

IV-B-Marinduque The Management commented that all the concerned official and staff have been 

advised to (i) review/check the details of the inter-agency payables account; and (ii) 

prepare and maintain SL for each employee to account and determine the composition 

of the unremitted balances. 

IV-B-Calapan City 

and Managpi NHS 

The School Principal instructed the Bookkeeper about the audit recommendations. 

V-ROP Management commented that the Accountant assigned to the account was already 

instructed to carefully prepare, analyze and review all the entries posted in the GL and 

SLs of Other Payables account and examine the correctness of the Schedule and Aging 

of the said account. 

 

Management also informed the Audit Team that the Accounting Section is currently 

in the process of reconciling the PLIs SLs vis-à-vis the GL to properly effect the 

necessary adjustments.   

 

Likewise, all the recommendations made by the Audit Team are well taken and 

Management guarantees to periodically review and clean up the Schedule of Other 

Payables account. 

VIII-ROP Management commented that the Accounting Section shall prepare SLs for the 

enumerated Payable accounts. They have to work back several years that needs 

considerable time to finish the job. Due to lack of personnel, they also consider hiring 

a JO to handle this task under the close supervision of the Chief Accountant. 

VIII-Samar The Accounting Department commented that they will facilitate the reconciliation of 

the accounts and will prepare the necessary adjusting entries. 

VIII-Southern Leyte Management commented that they will revert the amount of P780,706.86 noted 

Accumulated Surplus back to the BTr. 

X-Bukidnon Management assured that the Accounting Unit has the GL  for the account 

Guaranty/Security Deposits Payable and was regularly submitted to COA, together 

with those of other accounts on a monthly basis. This account comprises retentions 

from the Progress Billings of the contractors. Though some of them are more than two 

years, the retention was part/attached to the account Construction in Progress with no 

final presentation of 100% completion billings from the contractors. However, as to 

the schedule and the SL of Guaranty Deposits/Security Payable requested, the 

Accounting Unit will prepare and extract it from the GL of the account. 

XI-ROP The Management issued Regional Memorandum directing the personnel concerned on 

the compliance with the audit recommendations and a copy of it will be submitted to 

the  COA Office. 

 



223 

 

Office/RO Management’s Comments 

Submission of the required schedule of valid due and demandable payables shall also 

be submitted upon its completion. Adjusting entry in the books of accounts will be 

made after validation procedures on the correct amount of payables based on the list. 

 

g) Deficiencies affecting the reliability of Expenses account 
 

2.90 Section 6, Chapter 19 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I, enumerated the 
qualitative characteristics of financial reporting. Among which are reliability, 

faithful representation, and completeness. 

 

2.91 Various misclassifications of accounts with an aggregate value of

2.93 Volume III – The Revised Chart of Accounts (Updated 2019) of the 
Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies 

(NGAs), defines Traveling Expenses-Local as the account used to recognize 

the costs incurred in the movement/transport of government officers and 

employees within the country. This includes amount paid/incurred for 

fare/transportation, travel per diems, and all other related expenses. 



225 

 

 

2.94 Review of accounting entries relative to the monetized leave credits amounting 
to P5,076,327.54 availed by the 119 employees of SDO-Pasig revealed that 

these were recorded as Salaries and Wages – Regular account instead of Other 

Personnel Benefits account. 

 

2.95 The various expense accounts of SDOs-Nueva Vizcaya and Tuguegarao City   
totaling P7,789,648.87 were not appropriately recorded in the appropriate 

account classifications due to the charging of expense based on the nature of 

allotment where it was obligated and not based on facts or nature of the 

transactions/events, thus affecting the fair presentation of the accounts in the 

financial statements.  

 

2.96 In RO IV-A, SDO-Batangas erroneously recorded the incurred expenses for 
electrification works and air conditioning unit repairs as Repairs and 

Maintenance - Infrastructure Assets and Repairs and Maintenance-Machinery 

and Equipment accounts amounting to P3,564,897.45 and P135,000.00, 

respectively, or a total of P3,699,897.45 instead of recording under the Repairs 

and Maintenance-Others account. 

 

2.97 Also, SDO-Batangas incorrectly recorded the cost of checkbook in the Bank 
Charges account instead of Bank Transaction Fee account as required in the 

Revised Chart of Accounts (Updated 2019). 

  

Furthermore, in SDO-Batangas, payment for Service Recognition Incentive 

(SRI) in the amount of  P48,682,000.00 recorded under JEV No. 01-2020-12-

00229 dated December 01, 2020 was recognized as Terminal Leave Benefits 

instead of Other Personnel Benefits account . 
 

2.98 Meanwhile, in RO X-ROP, expenses in various regional meetings such as 
Regional MANCOM Meeting, Special MANCOM Meeting, PROGCOM 

Meeting, and Regional Video Conference, conduct of survey for the Special 

Hardship Allowance (SHA) Baseline Study and monitoring of other 

programs/policies implemented amounting to P139,115.00 were recorded as 

Training Expenses. The related expenses during meetings should be charged 

to and recorded as Extraordinary and Miscellaneous Expenses (EME) or 

Representation Expenses depending on the expenses incurred. 

 

2.99 We recommended that the Management instruct and require the 
Accountant to: 

 

a) prepare the necessary adjusting entries to reclassify the affected 
accounts; and  

 

b) observe the proper recording and recognition of the expenses in their 
appropriate Expense accounts, in accordance with the Volume III - 



226 

 

Revised Chart of Accounts to ensure fair presentation and reliability 

of the account balance in the FS. 

 

2.100 The Management comments are as follows: 
 

RO Office/SDO Management Comments 

NCR ROP In a letter dated March 26, 2021, the Management commented 

that adjustments for the misclassification of accounts amounting 

to ₱207,712.70, which involves nominal accounts are no longer 

necessary as the said accounts were already closed to the Income 

and Summary Account as of December 31, 2020.  It was 

commented that it was done unintentionally, and had it known 

before December 31, 2020, the same had no reason to adjust the 

same immediately. 

Pasig The Management will require the Accountant to record 

monetization of leave credits under its proper account, Other 

Personnel Benefits Account as defined in GAM, Volume III  or 

The Revised Chart of Accounts. 

II Nueva 

Vizcaya 

The Management agreed to comply with the audit 

recommendation. The Management directed the Accountant to 

observe the use of appropriate accounts in the recording of 

transaction as prescribed in the Revised Chart of Accounts of the 

GAM for NGAs, Volume III.  

Tuguegarao 

City 

The Management appreciated the observation on the wrong 

classification of the expenditure item. They assured that the 

Accounting Unit will display more vigilance in classifying the 

accounts to avoid the occurrence of the same observation.  

IV-A SDO 

Batangas 

Management is amenable to the findings and observations and 

will comply with the audit recommendations.    

V SDO Albay The Agency’s Accountant reacted positively with the 

observation and agreed to make the necessary adjustment in the 

agency books of accounts. He also assured that salaries of 

substitute teachers will be recorded/taken up in its appropriate 

account in accordance with COA Circular No. 2020-001 Volume 

III-The Revised Chart of Accounts (Updated 2019) of GAM for 

NGAs. 

 

 

COMPLIANCE AUDIT  

 

Audit of COVID-19 Fund for the Basic Education Learning Continuity Plan (BE-LCP) 

 

3. Audit of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Bayanihan Funds 1 and 2  for 
the BE-LCP in SY 2020-2021 disclosed  a) lapses in the budget utilization of 

P3,220,873,835.58 as of December 31, 2020 such as, among others:                                 

i) P1,390,073,721.10 funds were not immediately released to the ROs by DepEd 

CO and to the SDOs by the two ROs, ii) only 41.02 percent or P915,626,354.65 

was disbursed of the P2,232,216,345.18 obligated allotments in the six ROs,  iii)        

P396,290,172.69  funds were unutilized in  the seven ROs; and  b) flawed/ 

incomplete/ delayed procurement, reproduction and delivery of Self Learning 

Modules (SLMs) in 78 SDOs of 15 ROs, thus affecting the overall effective 



227 

 

implementation of the BE-LCP adopted by the Department to relentlessly carry 

out  its mandate of providing quality basic education in spite of the Pandemic 

crisis. Moreover, the validity and propriety of BE-LCP financial/disbursement 

transactions totaling P4,009,042,807.72 were not fully ascertained by the Audit 

Teams and/or doubtful due to a) non-/incomplete submission of the required 

documents; b) non-/delayed submission of perfected contracts/ Purchase Orders 

and insufficiency of supporting documents; c) non-compliance with the IRR of 

RA No. 9184 and Other Issuances on Government Procurement; and d) 

inadequate supporting documents and other deficiencies in disbursements and 

procurements.  

 

3.1 The COVID-19 outbreak has caused a profound impact on people’s lives and 
livelihoods. With this crisis, a State of Public Health Emergency throughout 

the Philippines has been declared. Community quarantine and physical 

distancing measures being imposed by the government to prevent the spread of 

the virus have adversely affected various sectors including education, as 

schools and community learning centers (CLCs) are closed for physical 

conduct of classes.  This poses an unprecedented challenge in providing equal 

education for all amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. 

 

3.2 In view of the adverse effect and serious threats of the COVID-19 to health, 
safety, security and livelihood of the Filipinos, a state of national emergency 

was declared under Republic Act (RA) No. 11469 or the Bayanihan to Heal as 

One Act (Bayanihan Act One) which was approved on March 24, 2020; and in 

view of the need for sustained COVID-19 response and recovery interventions 

by the government, RA No. 11494 or the Bayanihan to Recover as One Act 

(Bayanihan Act Two) was approved on September 11, 2020. 

 

3.3 To mitigate the impact in education brought about by this pandemic and in 
conjunction with the objective for learning to continue amidst the threats and 

uncertainties while ensuring health and well-being of students, teachers and 

personnel, DepEd developed and adopted the BE-LCP as the overall 

framework to govern SY 2020 – 2021. The BE-LCP, as provided under DepEd 

Order No. 012, s. 2020 dated June 19, 2020, is a package of educational 

interventions to ensure that learning opportunities are safely provided to the 

learners, through different learning delivery. This serves as guidance to all 

DepEd offices and schools, learners and their parents, partners, and 

stakeholders. 

 

3.4 Under the BE-LCP, schools use SLMs as alternative learning materials to 
provide quality and equal access to education for all during this time of crisis 

considering the uneven access to digital devices and online tools and slow 

internet connection. In addition to SLMs, other schools conduct online classes 

and provide digital learning materials, assignments and tasks which may be 

completed and submitted online.  

 



228 

 

3.5 The internal reprogramming of existing programs and projects is the major 
funding source for the BE-LCP. With it, the DepEd CO, in pursuance of 

Section 4 (v) of RA No. 11469 (Bayanihan 1), has identified and pooled 

Programs, Activities and Projects (PAPs) for the funding requirements of the 

said program amounting to ₱10.9 billion. The amount was covered by Special 

Allotment Release Order (SARO) Nos. BMB-F-20-0013655 and BMB-F-20-

0013656 released by the DBM. Furthermore, under RA No. 11494 (Bayanihan 

2), additional SAROs amounting to ₱4 billion and ₱1.19 billion were released 

in view of the need for additional funds by DepEd for the implementation of 

BE-LCP. The summary of these abovementioned SAROs released by DBM 

and the transferred funds to ROPs/SDOs nationwide as of  December 31, 2020

3.9 Section B of DepEd Order No. 18, s. 2020 dated July 20, 2020 provides the 
guidelines on the allocation, release and utilization of funds relative to the 

implementation of BE-LCP. This sets the procedures from the submission of 

request to the Secretary for the downloading of fund for DepEd ROs up to the 

release of NCA. Moreover, it provides general guidelines for printing of SLMs 

to facilitate their timely delivery to the learners and the list of the allowable

implementation. The RO has incurred delays from 5 to 47 

days in the issuance of five Sub-AROs totaling 

₱440,572,000.00 to the Divisions. This resulted in delay in 
the conduct of procurement process and delivery of 

procured SLMs, thus resulted in low utilization of the 

allocations received by SDOs. 

440,572,000.00 5 – 47 days 

Total   1,390,073,721.10  

 

3.11 According to the Management in DepEd CO, the process of requesting the Sub-
AROs was prolonged due to the delays of the program owners in requesting 

the downloading of funds from the Budget Division.  Besides, the process was 

also hampered because of the challenges brought up by the work arrangement 

adopted during this time of the pandemic since only 50 percent of the staff was 

allowed to work, or even less. With the limited workforce, processing of the 

obligational authority intended for the Regions including the complete staff 

work in the fund request by the program owners would entail additional 

working days to complete.  

 

3.12 Also, Management contended that although part of the ₱10.9 billion under the 
Bayanihan 1 Fund was not released immediately to ROPs and downloaded in 

tranches, the Learning Resources and Platforms Committee2 (LRPC) has 

managed to give out the mobilization fund charged from its regular 

program, particularly the Textbooks and Instructional Materials 

allocation, ensuring further that it continuously undertake the realignment, 

review, and recalibration of its available funds including the resources of its 

recipients.  

 

3.13 The Audit Team recognizes and understands the challenges posed by the 
current working condition, however, it has to be emphasized that the 

implementation of the program should not be affected by the setback in the 

timely release of the fund to maximize the benefits that can be derived 

therefrom and to assure the overall preparedness of the implementing schools 

in order to continue students’ learning amidst the threat and uncertainties 

brought about by the pandemic.

and that the necessary platforms or technologies (printed, digital online, and offline, television, and radio) are engaged or made in a 
timely and efficient manner

a.2) Low overall disbursement utilization rate of 41.02% in 6 ROs 

 

3.14 The low disbursement utilization rate in six ROs was attributed to the slow 
procurement process, undelivered SLMs and supplies, late release of fund, 

delay in the uploading or transmission of Ready to Print Modules and non-

submission of supporting documents to facilitate the payment. Other SDOs 

reserved the fund for the production of 2nd quarter SLM.

3.15 Accordingly, the low disbursement utilization rate caused by the delay in 
procurement and delivery of procured items and such other cited conditions 

affected the implementation of the BE-LCP considering the urgency and 

necessity of development, production and provision of learning resources to 

learners before SY 2020-2021 formally opens on October 5, 2020.

CY 2020, ₱396,290,172.69 or equivalent to 12.76% remained unobligated at

provide tablets for the learners who are residents of San Juan City. 

The estimated cost of the tablet as basis for the amount on the cash 

advance granted per school was not specified from the documents 

furnished to the Audit Team. Further, the fund was not 

proportionately allocated to Schools if their basis was the number of 

non-resident learners of SDO-San Juan as claimed. It was also 

disclosed that the quantity of tablets to be procured is 1,432, which 

is 91 more than the number of non-resident learners of San Juan. 

Hence, the reasonableness of the quantity to be procured cannot be 

ascertained. In addition to this, given the large amount of budget for 

ICT purchases, the Division could have also procured on behalf of 

the Schools through public bidding.

The BE-LCP Fund was used to pay for the salary, honoraria and

SDOs, ₱448,999,292.93 or 87% remained unobligated as of 

September 30, 2020 despite the school’s opening on October 5. This 

has caused some SDOs’ lack of sense of urgency in undertaking the 

process of procurement and lack of close monitoring on fund

before the opening of classes.

VIII Various 

SDOs 

Various schools merely adopted the SLMs distribution under 

Modular Distance Learning Modality instead of combining it with 

Online Distance Learning and TV/Radio-Based Instruction under 

which lectures are required whether online or recorded. Thus, 

learning appears absolutely dependent on how the learner interprets 

or understands the SLMs rather than as how teachers through lectures 

elaborate the topics they contain for their learners.  Also, the fund 

allocated for lecture services that the teaching staff are supposed to 

render whether online or recorded, may not have been optimized.

Insufficient 

allotment and 

inadequate 

budget for

XIII Agusan 

del Sur 

The Division of Agusan del Sur received insufficient allotment for 

BE-LCP from the RO due to understated number of learners 

submitted by SDO which excluded a total of 14,897 Senior High 

School learners. Also, the approved budget for the procurement of 

materials needed for SLMs is inadequate since the number of 

learners as basis for the procurement was understated by 4,724 

pertaining to Senior High Schools. 

- 

Improper 

distribution of 

devices to

XIII Agusan

The procured tablets and On the Go Adapters (OTG) aggregating to

by the Regional Director that will identify recipients of the USBs and 

tablets to ensure the equitable distribution thereof as provided in 

DepEd Memorandum OUF-2020-0614 dated November 11, 2020. 

Instead, the target recipients who were given priority to receive the 

tablets were identified based on assessment of the levels of learning 

of the students, and the schools who offered digitized learning 

modality based on the results of their Learner Enrolment and Survey 

Form (LESF). This resulted in the improper distribution of the 

devices to the recipient learners. Thus, their actual and diverse needs 

were not addressed and were not given priority such as those with 

disabilities and those who are in much need to avail the devices.

tablets and OTGs/USBs; and instruct the EPS Focal Person to identify 

the appropriate recipients that should be prioritized with the available 

tablets procured to address the actual and diverse needs of the student 

learners. 

 

3.20 The Management’s comments/actions/commitments are as follows: 
 

 Process was also delayed due to AWA, and the restricted mobility with 
IATF rules enforced. 

 Delays were also attributed to the following: Amounts for allocation were 
based on available enrolment data, which were unstable; Areas affected by 

Typhoons “Quinta”, “Rolly”, and “Ulysses”; Delayed process and 

provision of ready-to-print SLMs from the CO; and Limited availability of 

suppliers which resulted in contracting services of different printing 

houses. 

 The Bayanihan Funds I and II allocated for BE-LCP program had reached 
an obligation rate of 92.56% and 62.29%, respectively. 

 

b) Non-/incomplete submission of the required documents regarding BE-LCP 
 

3.21 COA Circular No. 95-006 dated May 18, 1995 provides that:  
 

“Accountable officers shall submit records of receipts, disbursements, 

expenditures, operations, and all other documents, to the Chief 

Accountants in the manner and within the time frame prescribed in 

existing rules and regulations. 

 

Disbursing Officers in particular shall faithfully comply with Section 100 

of Presidential Decree No. 1445 which requires them to render monthly 

reports of their transactions pursuant to existing auditing regulations not 

later than the fifth (5th) day of the ensuing month to the auditor 

concerned.  

 

The official involved in the daily recording of transactions in the books of 

accounts shall turn over the receipts and the disbursement records with 

all paid vouchers and documents evidencing the transaction to the 

Auditor within ten (10) days from date of receipt of said documents.” 



238 

 

 

3.22 Section 5.3 of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 provides 
that “within ten days (10) after receipt of the report and supporting documents 

from the AO, the accountant shall verify the report, record it in the books and 

submit the same with all the vouchers/payrolls and supporting documents to 

the Auditor.” 

 

3.23 Section 7.1.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009 
provides that “The head of the agency, who is primarily responsible for all 

government funds and property pertaining to his agency, shall ensure that: a) 

the required financial and other reports and statements are submitted by the 

concerned agency officials in such form and within the period prescribed by 

the Commission, xxx.” 

 

3.24 Item No. VIII of DepEd Order No. 2020-018 dated July 20, 2020 regarding the 
policy guidelines for the provision of learning resources in the implementation 

of the BE-LCP states that “BLR shall continuously gather feedback on the

DSO, through the Curriculum Implementation Division (CID); and down the 

level of school. DSO shall submit to their respective ROs a Statement of 

Expenditure (SOR) within two (2) months from the receipt of funds. The SOE 

shall be duly Certified by the Division Accountant and approved by the Schools 

Division Superintendent.” 

 

3.25 Review of the implementation of the BE-LCP for CY 2020 revealed that the 
Accounting Division and other concerned offices in NCR and in eight ROs 

failed to submit JEVs, Disbursement Vouchers (DVs), LRs, and other 

supporting documents related to BE-LCP. Other documents such as the 

required reports on funding and proper Statement of Expenditures (SOE) were 

likewise not submitted to the Audit Team.

3.26 The non-submission of the abovementioned reports, schedules and documents 
hindered the timely audit of the transactions entered into by the Agency and 

determine the legality, propriety and reasonableness of said transactions. It 

caused delay in the execution of audit procedures by the Audit Team to 

evaluate its compliance with RA Nos. 11469 and 11494, "The Bayanihan to 

Heal as One Act" and "Bayanihan to Recover as One Act", respectively, and 

related DepEd Orders.  

 

3.27 We recommended that Management:  
 

a) require the concerned Offices/Divisions to submit the required 
reports, schedules and documents to the Audit Team within ten days 

from date of receipt hereof from the AO as provided in COA Circular 

No. 97-002; and  
 

b) suspend automatically the payment of salaries of the 
employees/officials concerned not later than ten days from receipt 

hereof, until they have complied with the requirements of the 

Commission on Audit pursuant to the provisions of Section 122 of PD 

No. 1445.

3.28 The Management’s Comments and Auditor’s Rejoinder are presented below: 
 

RO Management’s Comments/s and/or Action Auditor’s Rejoinder 

NCR, ROs III, IV-

A, V, VI, IX, and 

XI 

The required reports, schedules and documents 

were already submitted to the office of the resident 

Auditor. 

Management comments are 

well noted and the submitted 

documents will be further 

evaluated. Further, we will 

continue to monitor the 

compliance of the Division in 

the regular submission of 

reports and disbursement and 

validate the records and reports 

of the Division, particularly on 

BE-LCP implementation. 

II and IV-B Will comply with the audit recommendations and 

will submit DVs, LRs, and the required reports  

VIII In SDO-Maasin City, DVs totaling P28,789,336.07 

were already submitted to the COA and the 

remaining transactions will be submitted 

immediately. Likewise, in SDO-Ormoc City, delay 

was due to travel restrictions, skeleton workforce 

and there were times the Finance personnel were in 

home quarantine, there was a delay in the 

submission of the LRs. But will be doing their best 

effort to submit the reports on or before the 

specified dates. Meanwhile, in. SDO-Samar, the 

Accounting Department strictly requires the 

submission of the liquidation of the BE-LCP. In 

fact, several memoranda were issued stating the 

deadline of the submission of the different 

tranches. 

 

c) Non-/ delayed submission of perfected contracts and Purchase Orders (POs) 
and insufficiency of supporting documents  

 

3.29 Paragraph 3.1.3 of COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009 states 
that:  

 

“Within five (5) working days from the execution of a contract by the 

government or any of its subdivision, agencies or instrumentalities, 

including government-owned and controlled corporations and their 

subsidiaries, a copy of said contract and each of all the documents forming 

part thereof by reference or incorporations shall be furnished to the Auditor 

of the Agency concerned. . . x x x.”  

 

3.30 Corollary thereto, Paragraph A.2 of COA Circular No. 96-010 dated August 
16, 1996 requires that the agency official responsible for accepting deliveries 

of procured items shall, within 24 hours from such acceptance, notify the 

Auditor of the time and date of the scheduled deliveries. 

 

3.31 Further, Section 3.1.2 of COA Circular No. 2009-01 dated February 12, 2009 
and Section 9.1 of COA Circular No. 2012-01 dated June 14, 2012 cover all 

contracts, POs and the like entered by any government agency. 

 

3.32 A systematic and effective review process on the contracts cannot be fully and 
timely carried out in view of: a) non- and delayed submission of contracts for 

the provision of SLMs totaling ₱1.8 billion; and b) absence of required 

documents supporting the contracts on procurement amounting to ₱603 



241 

 

million, contrary to COA Circular Nos. 2009-001 and 2012-001. The summary 

of non-/delayed submission of contracts/POs is presented in the table below:

3.33 We recommended that Management:  
 

a) submit justification on the delayed submission of contracts/POs, 
contrary to COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009 as 

non-compliance therewith affected the timely review of the 

contracts/POs and correction of errors to prevent the issuance of 

Notice of Suspension/Disallowance;   

 

b) furnish the Audit Team with the delivery documents, such as DRs and 
Inspection and Acceptance Report (IAR) within 24 hours from 

delivery, in adherence to COA Circular No. 96-010 dated August 16, 

1996; and 

 

c) submit the lacking required supporting documents in contracts that 
are considered necessary in the auditorial/legal review and in the 

technical evaluation thereof pursuant to COA Circular Nos. 2009-01 

and 2012-001, otherwise, issuance of Notice of Suspension on any 

payments related to that contract is inevitable. 
 

3.34 The Management’s comments/actions/commitments are as follows: 

 

 most of the ROs informed their respective auditors that they have 
submitted the reportorial documents, but were delayed due to the 

alternative working arrangement, and the rise of COVID-19 cases (for 

NCR); and 

 others committed to comply with the observations and submit the 
remaining lacking documents. 

 



242 

 

d) Non-compliance with the IRR of RA No. 9184 and Other Issuances on 
Government Procurement 

 

3.35 The Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) is promulgated 
pursuant to Section 75 of RA No. 9184, otherwise known as the “Government 

Procurement Reform Act,” for the purpose of prescribing the necessary rules 

and regulations for the modernization, standardization and regulation of the 

procurement activities of the Government of the Philippines (GOP). 

 

3.36 In line with the commitment of the GOP to promote good governance and its 
efforts to adhere to the principles of transparency, accountability, equity, 

efficiency and economy in the procurement process, Section 3, Rule 1 of the 

Revised IRR of RA No. 9184 is upheld, which reads: 

“Section 3. Governing Principles on Government Procurement 

 

The procurement of the GOP shall be governed by these principles: 

 

a. Transparency in the procurement process and in the implementation of 
procurement contracts through wide dissemination of bid 

opportunities and participation of pertinent non-government 

organizations. 

 

b. Competitiveness by extending equal opportunity to enable private 
contracting parties who are eligible and qualified to participate in 

competitive bidding. 

 

c. Streamlined procurement process that will uniformly apply to all 
government procurement. The procurement process shall be simple 

and made adaptable to advances in modern technology in order to 

ensure an effective and efficient method. 

 

d. System of accountability where both the public officials directly or 
indirectly involved in the procurement process as well as in the 

implementation of procurement contracts and the private parties that 

deal with GOP are, when warranted by circumstances, investigated 

and held liable for their actions relative thereto. 

 

e. Public monitoring of the procurement process and the implementation 
of awarded contracts with the end in view of guaranteeing that these 

contracts are awarded pursuant to the provisions of the Act and this 

IRR, and that all these contracts are performed strictly according to 

specifications.” 

 

3.37 Likewise, GPPB Circular No. 01-2020 dated April 06, 2020 provides the 
guidelines for Emergency Procurement under RA No. 11469 or the Bayanihan 

to Heal as One Act (Bayanihan Act One), the GPPB Online Portal was 



243

3.39 We recommended that the Management: 
 

a) observe strict compliance with the applicable rules and regulations of 
the 2016 Revised IRR of RA No. 9184, relevant COA rules and 

regulations, and other government issuances on the government 

procurement process; 

 

b) require responsible officials to explain/justify with verifiable basis why 
they failed to comply with existing procurement rules and regulations 

as mentioned above, and enjoin the BAC to strictly follow RA No. 9184 

and its revised IRR; 

 

c) conduct proper planning in the procurement of goods and services to 
avoid splitting of requisition pursuant to the provisions of the Revised 

IRR of RA No. 9184 and COA Circular No. 2009-002 dated May 18, 



248 

 

2009. Otherwise, officials and employees concerned in-charge in the 

conduct of procurement process should be dealt with accordingly; 

 

d) ensure that contracts and POs stipulate the rights and obligation of 
the contracting parties to assure compliance and imposition of penalty 

or liquidated damages in case of failure or non-fulfillment of the 

contract terms;  

 

e) submit the APP/Supplemental APP for the reproduction of SLMs as 
required under Section 7 of the 2016 Revised IRR of RA No. 9184 and 

to prepare the APP for the SDS’ approval and post it on the Procuring 

Entity’s website and submit to the GPPB or post it on the GPPB online 

portal; 

 

f) ensure that procurement of common-use supplies is made initially 
with DBM-PS. If stocks are not available from DBM-PS, secure 

therefrom the Procurement Service Certificate of Non-Availability of 

Stocks before resorting to the alternative mode of procurement such 

as Shopping; and 

 

g) adhere to all procurement processes, including the thorough 
deliberation and meticulous assessment by the BAC of the eligibility 

of prospective bidders to be covered by Resolution/s and the 

preparation of required documents as prescribed in the 2016 IRR of 

RA No. 9184 to ensure beneficial procurements to the government, 

thus precluding any doubts on the propriety of the transaction. 

 

3.40 The Management’s comments/actions/commitments are as follows: 
 

 concerned offices provided their respective Auditors with explanations on 
the observed non-compliance (i.e., letter-request from suppliers, Bidding 

Documents, minutes of the meetings, and etc.), and  

 ensured that the Commission’s recommendations will be taken seriously 
and all required documents will be submitted promptly. 

 

e) Inadequate supporting documents and other deficiencies in disbursements 
and procurements 

 

3.41 Section 2 of PD No. 1445 provides that: 
 

“It is the declared policy of the State that all resources of the government 

shall be managed, expended or utilized in accordance with law and 

regulations, and safeguarded against loss or wastage through illegal or 

improper disposition, with a view of ensuring efficiency, economy and 

effectiveness in the operations of government. The responsibility to take 



249 

 

care that such policy is faithfully adhered to rests directly with the chief or 

head of the government agency concerned.” 

 

3.42 While Section 4 of the same PD provides that: 
 

 “(5) Disbursements or disposition of government funds or property shall 

invariably bear the approval of the proper officials.  

  (6) Claims against government funds shall be supported with complete 

documentation.  

 (7) All laws and regulations applicable to financial transactions shall be 

faithfully adhered to.” 

 

3.43 Likewise, COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 prescribes the 
documentary requirements for common government transactions. Included 

therein is the provision, among others, that claims against the government 

funds shall be supported with complete documentation.

were issued to different units in the DO; the vacuum cleaners remained 

under their custody, while the pressure washers were yet to be 

distributed to the schools. These can be viewed as unnecessary since the 

offices to which the equipment was issued were not involved in the

only supported by DR and Cash Invoice indicating that the procurement was 

not in accordance with RA No. 9184. Likewise, the fund received was not 

recorded in the books of the Agency, thus casting doubts on the regularity and 

propriety of the transaction. 

 

3.48 We recommended and the Management of concerned Offices agreed to: 
 

a) require the Accountant to submit the lacking documents, exercise due 
diligence in processing of claims and ensure that all 

disbursements/utilization of government funds are authorized and 

properly supported with necessary documents to avoid audit 

suspension/disallowance;  

 

b) for SDO Marikina and Agusan del Sur, require the School Heads to 
exercise due diligence in assessing the School’s “hierarchy of needs” in 

the prioritization of use of funds without compromising the health and 

safety of learners, teaching and non-teaching personnel in response to 

the COVID-19 situation pursuant to DepEd Order No. 15, s. 202; and 

defer non-essential activities in compliance with NBC No. 580 to 

prioritize the activities to support the implementation of the BE-LCP; 

 

c) for SDO-Quezon Province, refund the excess payment of the contract 
cost amounting to ₱3,293,433.00 and instruct the Property and Supply 

Officer and Inspectors to conduct judicious examination of the items 

delivered to ensure the correctness of the quantity and specifications 

as against the Purchase Order/contract; 

 

d) for SDO Masbate, coordinate with the concerned Suppliers and 
demand the full delivery of the printing equipment and materials 

according to the specifications and the terms set forth in the approved 

POs/Contracts; 
 

e) for SDO Aklan, require the concerned School Heads to refund the 
double payment incurred and the amount found irregularly paid, and 

ensure that it is duly receipted and recorded in the books of accounts;  

 

f) for Isabela City, Talisay and Tagum City, to stop the practice of 
processing DVs without complete documentation and strictly observe 

the regulations on prohibition against advance payment on 

government contracts in accordance with Section 88 of PD No. 1445 

and pertinent provisions of GAM for NGAs, Volume I; 

 



254 

 

g) for General Santos, investigate the procurement process of the Non-
IUs Schools, particularly on the selection of participating suppliers, 

the request for submission of quotations and the awarding process and 

hold those liable for involvement in the irregularities and if warranted, 

initiate administrative as well as criminal charges against the persons 

liable; and 

 

h) for SDO of Isabela City, discontinue the practice of purchasing the 
equipment directly from suppliers regardless of the source of funds, 

which is not in accordance with the 2016 Revised IRR of RA No. 9184, 

and require the Accountant to record the receipt of funds in the books 

as Donation in Cash and secure complete documents for the purchase 

of equipment. 
 

3.49 The Management’s comments/actions/commitments are as follows: 
 

 The SDOs will work on the submission of required documents. 

 The procurement of the air purifiers, vacuum cleaners, and pressure 
washers were done to safeguard the health and safety of its employees 

/personnel/ workers. 

 Delay in the transmission of documents was caused by the imposition of 
the ECQ. 

 Processing of voucher without complete delivery was done to avoid 
reversion/lapsing of NCA. 

 Frequent power interruptions and machine breakdowns for some areas 
caused the delay in the printing of modules. 

 

f) Non-preparation / maintenance of prescribed forms for issuance and 
recording of inventory items 

 

3.50 Section 17, Chapter 8, of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I provides the various 
records, forms and reports being prepared for Inventory accounts:  

 

“Sec. 17. Records, Forms and Reports to be prepared and/or

of information for making entries on the card. 

 

 Requisition and Issue Slip (RIS) (Appendix 63) shall be used by the

3.53 We recommended that Management: 
 

a) strictly comply with the provisions of Chapter 8, Volume I of the GAM 
for NGAs, relative to the procedures in the Receipt, Inspection, 

Acceptance and Recording of Inventory items; and 

 

b) require the Supply Officer to prepare and maintain the prescribed 
forms, such as: IAR, for the inspection and acceptance of purchased 

items; and SCs, for each type of SLMs. Also, document the issuances 

with duly approved RISs to be reported in the RSMI so that the 

Accountant could record the issuances for the month and monitor the 

running balance of inventory items accurately. 

 

3.54 The Management’s comments/actions/commitments are as follows: 
 

 some SDOs have already submitted complete documents while others 
committed to work on the completion of the submission of required 

documents; 

 process flows were altered due to COVID-19 pandemic; and 

 all SDOs committed to work on the improvement of their system. 
 

g) Flawed/Incomplete/Delayed procurement, reproduction and delivery of SLMs 
 

3.55 Section 1 of DepEd Order No. 018, s. 2020 states that: 
 

“In response to this emergency, DepEd developed the Basic Education 

Learning Continuity Plan (BE-LCP) to ensure that learning opportunities 

are provided to our learners in a safe manner, through different learning 

delivery. In line with this, the Department, through its Regional and School 

Division Offices undertake the urgent and necessary development, 

production and provision of learning resources, in accordance with its 

mandate.” (Emphasis supplied) 

 

3.56 Considering that learning continuity is one of the principles of BE-LCP, 
documents and reports were reviewed to verify the timely provision of learning 

resources to students and disclosed the following observations in 78 SDOs in

3.57 The number of modules procured and delivered in NCR, and Regions III and 
IV-A was insufficient to cover the total enrollees for CY 2020-2021 since the 

basis used in the procurement of printing services is the early enrollment for 

SY 2020-2021, hence additional enrollees were not considered. However, it 

was reported that the schools readily provided the needed modules by 

immediately performing the printing of learning materials out of their own 

MOOE funds.

allocation they would provide resulting in the late procurement on the part 

of the Division.  

IVA Batangas 

Province 

- Procurement was started late because of the late release of fund in RO IX 

and the SDOs waited for release of the complete soft copies of modules from 

RO/CO in order to determine the number of pages per module to be printed. 

This resulted in late deliveries of supplies/modules which was managed by 

providing the learners with activity sheets or by utilizing locally developed 

modules charged to MOOE.

3,572,150.00 The procurement took a longer time because of rebidding which was the 

result of setting short-term delivery period. With this, the printing was not

Siargao - SDO-Siargao was still on its procurement process as of November 15, 2020 

based on the contract and supporting documents for the supply of materials 

for the 2nd Quarter. We noted that actual delivery commenced on the first 

week of January 2021.

was delayed by seven days.  

Bayugan City - Some procurements were not yet undertaken as at December 11, 2020 due to 

erroneous identification of mode of procurement. It was originally identified 

that the mode was through public bidding which changed to Negotiated

g.3) Excess/Uneven number of modules

were also paid in Zambales. 

IVA Various SDOs Not indicated The 1:1 ratio of distributed SLMs vis-à-vis enrollees/learners was 

not achieved due to uneven distribution of SLMs among 2,910,639

and distribution of SLMs to enrollees.

g.4) Incomplete and delayed deliveries of modules 

 

3.60 There were noted delays in the delivery of modules which were attributed to 
the deficient planning, poor monitoring of deliveries, suppliers’ failure to 

complete or provide the needed requirements within the agreed term and 

delayed transmittal of final soft copy of modules for printing.

3.62 Considering the urgency and importance of the printed materials, the 
incomplete/non-availability of modules on the period in which it is supposed 

to be used deprived the learners of better learning opportunity and hampers the

continuity of the learning process of students during this time of pandemic 

contrary to the program’s objective.  

 

g.5) Printing of SLMs lacked the minimum technical standards set by the 

Department 

 

3.63 DM-CI-2020-00245 dated September 9, 2020 issued by Undersecretary 
Diosdado M. San Antonio provided an addendum to DepEd Order No. 18, s 

2020 stating that for Quarter 2 printing of SLMs should comply with the 

minimum technical standards enclosed in the said DM to ensure uniformity in 

the procurement or in-house/by administration printing and delivery of SLM. 

However, five ROs were not able to fully adhere to the prescribed 

specifications which resulted in poor printing quality and affected the 

readability of the contents of SLMs.

learning resources under the BE-LCP. 

 

g.7) Discrepancy between the procured and actual printed number of pages 

3.67 Management of Digos City entered into a contract with an amount of 
₱16,871,956.60 for the procurement of 48,205,616 pages of locally-made 

learning materials. However, this was based only on estimates and not on the 

actual requirements. 

 

3.68 Data shows that the total number of pages to be printed is only 34,777,914 
pages compared to what was indicated in the contract of 48,205,616 pages or a 

difference of 13,427,702 pages. Thus, the Division is inclined to provide 

additional locally developed learning resource that will correspond to the 

remaining number of pages. However, they are still in the process of 

developing these additional learning resources. Conservatively, the remaining 

pages totaling 13,427,702 would amount to ₱6,713,851.00 of idle funds that 

could have been used to cover other related expenses in the implementation of 

the different learning modalities of the BE-LCP. 

 

g.8) Errors and deficiencies noted in the evaluation of SLMs 

 

3.69 Item 6.6 of DepEd Order 18 s. 2020 provides that SLMs have been used by 
DepEd for its Alternative Delivery Modes (ADM) during disasters or in 

situations where learners have difficulty for daily school attendance. COVID-

19 has compelled the use of SLMs on a large scale. Considering the uneven 

access to technology among learners and the revealed greater preference for 

modular learning from the learner enrollment and survey forms responses, 

SLMs will be the backbone of distance learning mechanism to accompany 

textbooks, complemented by other distance learning modalities such as online 

and educational television and radio.  

 

3.70 Results of the survey and interview with teachers regarding the quality of the 
SLMs in NCR, CAR and Regions III disclosed the following observed errors 

and deficiencies:

Region SDO SLM Errors / Deficiencies 

NCR Various SDOs  Most errors noted were in the spellings, punctuations, and/or typographical errors. 

 0 to 3 errors in printing and sorting of SLMs, facts, computations, format and 
grammar/syntax errors were identified by large number of respondents. In totality, 

the errors noted did not impact the learning materials as a whole. 

CAR Baguio City; 

Benguet 

The most common noted deficiencies in the SLMs based on the survey conducted were 

typographical errors, dark/ unclear illustrative images, errors in answer keys, 

insufficient / confusing instructions and multiple choices with no correct answer. 

 

Concerned SDO Baguio City personnel disclosed that the unclear directives from CO 

on the preparation of modules, lack of training of teachers on the Learning Resource 

preparation, inadequate review and vague Quality Assurance Workflow contained in 

the Division Memorandum No. 351 series of 2020, might have brought about the 

observed errors and deficiencies.

 There were activities that required the identification of colored images/photos, but 
materials were printed in black and white. Consequently, the schools had to do extra 

work in printing the colored pages using their own school MOOE. 

 Some activities in the SLMs require internet connection or require the use of 
computers, thus creating learning disparities among students. 

 Contact information for inquiries, suggestions or feedbacks was from other Division 
Offices. 

 References used were outdated.

Based from the survey conducted, enrollees are required to return the modules without 

any markings for the purpose of re-issuance next school year. However, the use of 

different specifications may cause the early damage due to wear and tear.  

 

3.71 In effect, the existence of errors and deficiencies in the SLMs was an indication 
of the deficient planning on the preparation of SLMs, and procedural lapses in 

the checking/review and evaluation process/system of the Division provided

include specific/definite time requirements for the review and other work flow 

processes, preferably in flowchart form for clarity. Moreover, adhere strictly to 

DepEd Memorandum No. 82 s. 2017 and other DepEd issuances and guidelines on the 

preparation and evaluation of SLMs to ensure quality-assured modules; and 

 

t.) if possible, consider the use of available textbooks together with the printed modules 
and learning activity sheets to further enhance the learning skills of the students. 

 

3.73 The Management’s comments/actions/commitments are as follows: 
 

 There is a variance in the Audit’s Team data on actual enrollees vis-a-vis 
SDO’s actual enrollees.  

 There was a delay in the release of funds used for printing the modules. 

 ALS programs have a different timeline in contrast with regular programs.  

 Delay in the delivery of SLMs was due to unforeseen circumstances 
brought by the COVID-19 Pandemic.  

 Delay in the delivery of ready-to-print digital copies of the learning 
modules was due to the fact that the developed modules underwent 

thorough review and evaluation to weed out possible errors in all areas of 

discipline. 

 Delay in the delivery of SLMs admitted by Supplier.  

 Delay in the delivery of SLMs due to the scale of production, limited 
timeline, equipment, failures, supply chain delays, and inadequate 

manpower.  

 BLR has not downloaded even 50% of the required modules.  

 Delay in the bidding process.

4.9 Audit of Cash accounts revealed that the bank accounts in the Authorized 
Government Depository Bank (AGDB) are being maintained without specific 

authority or legal basis, defying the pertinent provisions of law, rules and 

regulations. Furthermore, various unremitted collections are retained in the 

said unauthorized current accounts as standby funds and are kept available at 

their disposal. Thus, exposing it to the risk of misuse or misappropriation of 

funds that could possibly be used to augment the financial requirements of 

unprogrammed activities and/or settlement of invalid obligations. Details of

4.10 The unauthorized bank accounts served as the depository of funds transferred 
from the MDS accounts, various collections and unutilized program funds, 

among others. The retention of these funds in an unauthorized account in the 

bank not only runs contrary to its governing rules and regulations, but also 

deprived the government of the use thereof to finance its other priority 

programs. 

 

4.11 We reiterated the recommendation that Management must secure 
authority from the Permanent Committee to maintain the current 

accounts which are considered extremely essential in the operations of the 

Agency and refrain from transferring funds from its MDS to currents 

accounts. Otherwise, close the unauthorized current accounts and remit 

the remaining balances to the BTr, pursuant to the existing laws, rules and 

regulations.

lapsing and refrain depositing to the CIB-LCCA. 

Marikina The Management stated that the Division will comply with the 

recommendations. Regarding adherence with existing rules and 

regulations mentioned including DepEd RM No. 057 s. 2021 dated

X Camiguin In a letter dated March 12, 2021, the Management stated that the 

funds are lodged in the Agency’s Trust Fund account and the whole 

amount cannot be remitted yet because most of it are continuing 

funds transferred from the RO for programs to be utilized in CY 

2021. Attached to the Management reply was a DV for the remittance 

to the Treasurer of the Philippines of the unutilized Trust Fund 

balance amounting to ₱507,437.46. The office is trying to ensure the 

timely implementation of programs and projects so that the 

disbursements can be made as scheduled as reflected in the Monthly 

Disbursement Program. But due to the pandemic wherein there are 

lots of protocols implemented by the National Government and the 

LGU that the suppliers have to follow, the delivery of some of the 

procured supplies/modules were not delivered on time. As of 

December 28, 2020, the agency transferred the unutilized NCA to the

the above practice is contrary to certain regulations and will refrain 

from such in order to strictly follow in the future the provisions of

During the exit conference, the school Cashier commented that they 

have already partially remitted ₱221,110.68 of the Trust Fund 

balance since the Bookkeeper is still in the process of reconciling the 

proper amount that should be remitted to the BTr. 

XI ROP The Management already issued the Regional Memorandum 

directing the Accountant to comply with the audit recommendations. 

The account was dormant since December 31, 2018 considering that 

the Head of the Accounting Unit was not immediately filled up from 

the time it was vacant and the situation makes it more difficult to the 

remaining staff to trace prior year’s transactions because there was 

no proper turnover of records. However, the Management commits 

compliance to the audit recommendations with the help of the newly 

hired Accountant III and Accountant I as an additional manpower.

Collections not deposited intact  

 

5. Collections under Cash – Collecting Officer account were not deposited intact, 
contrary to Section 69 of PD No. 1445 and Section 32, Chapter 2 of the Revised 

Cash Examination Manual. 
 

5.1 Section 69 (1) of PD No. 1445 states that “Deposit of moneys in the treasury. 
- Public officers authorized to receive and collect moneys arising from taxes, 

revenues, or receipts of any kind shall remit or deposit intact the full amounts 

so received and collected by them to the treasury of the agency concerned and 

credited to the particular accounts to which the said moneys belong.”

5.2 In addition, Paragraph 4 of the above stated section provides that the respective 
treasuries of those agencies shall in turn deposit with the proper government 

depository the full amount of the collections not later than the following 

banking day. 
  

5.3 Likewise, Section 32, Chapter 2 of the Revised Cash Examination Manual

5.5 The failure of the Collecting Officers to deposit intact and within the 
prescribed period the subject collections, exposed the funds to the risks of 

possible theft, loss or misappropriation.

the collection. Rest assured that prompt remittance of the

The undeposited collections were due to travel

travels to Borongan only twice a month to transact 

business at LBP for the payment of salaries and other

Borongan. However, those unremitted collections were 

all deposited already in January 2021. Starting March 

2021, they will ask for permission to allow the deposit of 

collections twice a month together with other transactions 

considering the long distance from our place to Borongan 

and the cost of travel it will incur. 

Northern Samar  The Cashier’s representative explained that the delay in 

the deposits of CY 2020 collections was due to instances 

when the bank’s system was offline, as well as on the 

temporary closure of their depository bank due to a 

COVID-19 positive case in one of the bank’s employees. 

For those collections that are to be remitted to BTr, they 

have tried to transfer the deposits to LBP instead, 

however, due to long queue, these collections are 

sometimes not deposited on the same day. Also, due to 

voluminous number of daily collections, it is sometimes 

impossible for them to deposit on the same day since they 

will still prepare a finalized report. The SDS assured that 

they will evaluate the collections system implemented by 

the agency in order to improve the process and implement 

the audit recommendation. 

X Misamis Oriental In its letter-reply dated February 15, 2021, the

instruction to the Division Cashier to strictly observe the 

deposit of all collections intact on the day or the next 

banking day. Further, the Division Cashier shall have a 

cut-off of her collections every 2PM and any collections 

beyond 2PM will be deposited the next banking day. 

Also, her assistant has been instructed not to collect any 

deposits. Likewise, the advice to the Division Cashier to 

prepare separate deposit slips will be practiced since cut-

off will now be implemented to ensure that all collections 

will be deposited. The Management also informed that 

they will be assigning additional personnel to replace the 

previous in-charge who has been promoted to 

Administrative Officer II. Also, to strictly adhere to the 

mandatory designation and bonding requirement of all 

accountable officers handling cash, the new personnel 

will be bonded and will be properly designated as

prescribed period as required under Section 74 of PD No. 1445 and Sections 5 

and 6, Chapter 21 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I. Likewise, other deficiencies 

were noted in the handling and reporting of cash accountabilities. 
 

6.1 Sound internal control for cash requires that a periodic reconciliation of bank 
accounts and control accounts be undertaken and reconciling items 

immediately corrected in order to ensure accuracy of bank balances appearing 

in the financial statements. It is only when both the books and bank records are 

reconciled that the reported cash balances are rendered accurate and reliable. 
 

6.2 Section 74 of PD No. 1445 states that “At the close of each month, depositories 
shall report to the agency head, in such form as he may direct, the condition 

of the agency account standing on their books. The head of the agency shall 

see to it that a reconciliation is made between the balance shown in the reports 

and the balance found in the books of the agency.” 
 

6.3 Sections 5 and 6, Chapter 21 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, provides that 
“The Chief Accountant shall submit the BRS within twenty days after receipt 

of the monthly BRS to the COA Auditor with all supporting documents and 

JEVs. Also, the Chief Accountant shall prepare a JEV to recognize all 

reconciling items that require adjustment and correction in the books of

determination of errors or omissions for immediate execution of corrective 

actions by the Management, as well as the establishment of the propriety and 

validity of transactions thru the Audit Team’s apt verification thereof. 
 

6.6 We recommended that Management: 
 

a) avail of the LBP’s online facility to immediately view and print the 
Agency’s bank statements; and 

 

b) strictly comply with the submission of BRS and the supporting 
financial reports/records/ documents within the prescribed period for

required timeline for the submission of the BRS. 

V Naga City The Management also explained that the delayed submission of the BRS 

was primarily due to the late release of bank statements. However, they 

will take into consideration enrolling in other bank service facilities such 

as WeAccess and/or eMDS when it becomes available for them for a more 

convenient access on the status of their bank accounts. 

VIII ROP Management commented that they will comply with the recommendation 

and will submit the requirements.

The Accountant III admitted the delay of the preparation of the BRS. Aside 

from the pandemic, the late issuance of the Bank Statements caused the 

delay in the preparation of the BRS. Furthermore, with regard to the Trust 

Fund, the assigned Accountant I is still new to the position, and she is still 

in the process of verifying the reconciling items. As of now, she has already 

prepared and submitted the BRS as of December 2019, and is already 

working on the CY 2020 BRS. The Accountant III assured to take actions 

in order to comply with the recommendation.

Iligan City The Accountant expressed his apology for the weaknesses made from his 

office because it was an effect of the government restriction to eradicate 

the COVID-19 wherein every employee was advised to resist from 

reporting to the office regularly by adapting the so-called Skeletal Work 

Force, their individual works were affected and all the various reports were 

always delayed and recording is motionless. Therefore, he assured that 

from now on he will do his best to prepare and submit BRS of all fund 

effectively as required by the COA Audit Team.

Incomplete recording of transactions related to cash accounts 

III Meycauayan The Accountable Officer did not maintain her cashbook to enter all the valid 

transactions and adjustments on a daily basis, if any. From our interview 

with the AO, she stated that she is just preparing the Check and ADA 

Disbursement Records, RCD and PCF Record monthly. There was no 

cashbook being maintained for the disbursements of PCF, she just prepares 

the PCF Record and submit to the Accounting Office the paid PCVs together 

with the supporting documents for the preparation of the Accounting staff of 

the LRs for the replenishment. These are the procedures she practiced due to 

her lack of awareness on the rules and regulations on proper recording and 

maintenance of cash books and other records. 

Nueva Ecija -

Bongabon NHS 

Copies of documents to be maintained by the Cash/Treasury Unit were not 

properly secured, and as disclosed by the Accountable Officer the office files 

for the period covered of the cash examination were already infested by 

termites. The requested Copy 2 of the Advice of Checks Issued and 

Cancelled (ACIC) was also not completely presented during the audit. 

Munoz NHS-

Treasury. 

XI Davao Del Sur The Collection process of the SDO Davao Del Sur contravened the existing 

laws and regulations due to the following inconsistencies: Non-submission 

of Provident Fund’s RCD including ORs within the prescribed period; 

receiving of collections sans order of payment; non-issuance of OR 

immediately after receipt of collections; and collections received by non-

bonded employee.

It was observed that the Disbursing Officer has no separate office but shares 

only with the Accounting Section, Records Section and Property and Supply 

Section in just one room. The Accounting Section is just located at the back 

of the Disbursing Officer’s table without any partition, thus, the two can

Audit review of the School’s bank account showed that the accountable 

officer failed to maintain the required minimum balance, thus bank service 

charge amounting to ₱1,400.00 was incurred. The bank service charge is 

construed as unnecessary expenditure per COA Circular No. 2012-003 

because due diligence was not exercised by the School Principal that could 

have prevented the incurrence of bank charges. The said unnecessary 

expense was covered by Notice of Disallowance No. 2020-001-Triala NHS

6.12 The foregoing lapses and deficiencies showed unsound practices in the 
handling of cash accountabilities and are indicative of weak internal control 

system over government resources. As an asset most susceptible to risk of loss 

and/or misappropriation, strong and adequate internal controls over cash must 

be ensured. 

 

6.13 We recommended that Management require the concerned offices to: 
 

a) submit to the Audit Team  all the required supporting documents and 
maintain necessary accounting records; 
 

b) ensure strict adherence to existing regulations as prescribed in Section 
101 of PD No. 1445 that all accountable officers/employees for the 

collections of revenues and receipts   are   properly   bonded   to 

properly safeguard government funds; 

 

c) provide the Cashier/Disbursing Officer with lock and/or safety deposit 
boxes/locked drawer to protect the money, accountable forms and 

other properties under his/her possession from risk loss or misuse; 

and 
 

d) ensure that disbursements are duly supported with the required

to the Development Academy of the Philippines (DAP) for the Intensified

7.12 The unliquidated amount of ₱17,403,800.81 was the financial assistance 
granted to the recipient LGUs from March to May 2017 for the implementation 

of the Abot Alam Program, which is a nationwide program of various 

government agencies and NGOs under the leadership of the DepEd. It aimed 

at integrating programs for Out of School Youth (OSY), and who have not 

completed basic education through interventions comprising education, 

entrepreneurship, or employment. Upon execution of the MOA, the project 

shall remain valid for ten months, and the LGUs shall return to DepEd any 

unused balance upon the termination of the Project. 

 

7.13 On the other hand, the unliquidated funds transferred of ₱8,962,526.14 to the 
five abovementioned LGUs were intended for the construction of school 

buildings under the School Building Program. 

 

7.14 The dormant Due from LGUs account balance of ₱10,002,040.00 as of 
December 31, 2020 was granted to the City of Puerto Princesa in the amount 

of ₱10,000,000.00 for the repair and rehabilitation of various school buildings 

in School Year (SY) 2008-2009 but was disallowed in audit because the funds 

were used in MIMAROPA Meet and Palarong Pambansa CY 2008; while the 

remaining amount of ₱2,040.00 pertains to unliquidated funds transferred to 

the Municipality of Sta. Barbara, Pangasinan for the construction of school 

buildings. 

 

d) Due from NGOs/POs  
 

7.15 The account Due from NGOs/POs as of December 31, 2020, showed a total 
balance of ₱1,211,722,142.32, of which the amount of ₱1,190,711,142.32 was 

transferred to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) for the 

sole purpose of implementing the project of procurement and delivery for and 

in behalf of DepEd.  



295 

 

 

7.16 The remaining Due from NGOs/POs account balance of ₱21,011,000.00 as of 
December 31, 2020, pertains to the prior years’ long outstanding/dormant 

accounts of NGOs/foundations aging from 14 to 24 years. Details are 

presented below:

7.17 It is expected that the various programs/projects for which these funds were 
transferred have already been accomplished considering the span of period that 

lapsed. Yet, unliquidated fund transfers aging over one to five years 

accumulated to ₱1.724 billion and dormant balances of ₱95.258 million 

continuously exist, rendering the account balances unreliable. 

 

7.18 This may be attributable to the laxity of the Management in requiring and/or 
monitoring of the submission of required reports, such as but not limited to 

LRs and Report on the Utilization of Funds, from the respective IAs. 

Accordingly, the Management made follow-ups and sent demand letters in the 

previous years for these long overdue accounts; however, it appears that that 

these were not sufficient to address the deficiencies noted rendering the 

collectability of these receivables doubtful. 

 

7.19 This is a reiteration of the Audit Team’s prior years’ observation wherein 
courses of actions were recommended but remained unimplemented. 

 

Region IV-A – ₱28,259,092.00 

 

7.20 Likewise, funds transferred of eight SDOs of RO IV-A to Philippine Carabao 
Center (PCC) and National Dairy Authority (NDA) amounting to 

₱19,896,492.80 and ₱8,272,599.20, respectively, for the implementation of 

Milk Feeding Program remained unutilized/unimplemented/no LR was

7.21 As at yearend, there was no utilization made by the PCC and NDA as the IAs 
for the fund transfer made by SDOs Rizal Province, Cavite Province and 

General Trias City, thus the intended purpose of the program was not realized 

and attained.  

 

7.22 On the other hand, it was noted that the monthly Status of Fund Utilization 
Report of the SBFP-Milk Feeding Program certified by the Division 

Accountant and approved by the Schools Division Superintendent of SDOs 

Batangas City, Lipa City, Tanauan City, Batangas Province and Antipolo City 

were not submitted to the Audit Team to determine the extent of 

implementation and the attainment of purpose for which this program was 

designed. 

 

7.23 The non-submission of monthly status of fund utilization by SDO and the 
schools concerned to update the Due from NGAs/GOCC account casted doubt 

on the propriety of disbursements. 

 

7.24 We reiterated our prior years’ recommendations that the Management: 
 

a) coordinate directly with the concerned Implementing Agencies 
requiring the submission of LRs/RODs on transferred funds for 

finished programs/projects for proper recording; 

 

b) validate the status of all unliquidated fund transfers and take 
appropriate action to demand immediate liquidation, or take 

appropriate legal processes to demand compliance with the MOA; 

and 

 

c) initiate the request for a write-off on the inter-agency and other 
receivables that remained non-moving for ten years or more in the 

books, in accordance with COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated 

December 19, 2016, duly supported with the necessary documents. 

 

7.25 The Management’s comments are as follows: 
 

Office/RO Management’s Comment 
CO The Accounting Division (AD) will closely coordinate with the 

project/program proponents for them to take actions and be responsible for 

the immediate submission on LRs/Report on the utilization of funds to settle 

and liquidate the accounts properly. 



297 

 

Office/RO Management’s Comment 
 

The AD is in the process of preparing the necessary documents to support 

request for write off for fund transfer made to entities wherein full 

documentation of accountability cannot be established. 
IV-A Management to comply with the audit recommendation and in DepEd Order 

No. 23, s. 2020. The Management also commented that the fund transfer to 

PCC of Cavite Province and General Trias City were already utilized and 

awaiting for the submission of reports from the IAs. While the OIC-SDS of 

SDO Lipa City and the Accountant of SDO Batangas City had already 

coordinated to NDA and demanded the submission of the report and related 

documents. 

 

Accumulation of outstanding balance of Due from DBM-PS 

 

8. Advances to the DBM-PS recorded under the Due from NGAs account by the 
DepEd CO, and NCR included past due/dormant balances totaling 

₱5,213,124,633.05, pertaining  to the procurement of computer hardware and 

software for distribution to various public elementary, and secondary schools 

nationwide under the DCP and the procurement of various instructional 

materials/textbooks/learning materials for public schools nationwide, thus 

affecting the efficient program delivery and leaving a huge amount of funds idle 

in the account of DBM-PS. 

 

8.1 EO No. 359 dated June 2, 1989 provides that the PS of the DBM shall be 
maintained as the regular organizational unit to implement and operate a 

central procurement system. Section 4 (b) thereof further provides that 

agencies shall remit to the PS the funds needed to service their requirements 

for supplies, materials and equipment as reflected in the Work and Financial 

Plan. 

 

8.2 Sections 6 and 7 of COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016 
prescribed rules and regulations on the monitoring and liquidation of fund 

transfers, to wit: 

 

Section 6.0 - General Guidelines  

 

6.1 All government entities shall conduct regular monitoring and 
analysis of receivable accounts to ensure that these are collected 

when these become due and demandable and that cash advances 

and fund transfers are liquidated within the prescribed period 

depending upon their nature and purpose; 

 

Section 7.0 - Specific Guidelines  

 

7.1 Conduct regular and periodic verification, analysis, and 
validation of the existence of the receivables, unliquidated cash 

advances, and fund transfers, and determine the concerned 



298 

 

debtors, accountable officers (Regular and Special Disbursing 

Officers, Collecting Officers, Cashiers) and the source and 

implementing government entities concerned; 

 

7.2 Reconcile the unliquidated fund transfers between the source 
and implementing government entities, prepare the adjusting 

entries for the reconciling items noted, and require liquidation of 

the balances; 

 

7.3 Prepare aging of dormant receivables, unliquidated cash 
advances, and fund transfers on a quarterly basis to support the 

request for write-off, and indicate in the remarks column the 

existence of the applicable conditions, such as, “absence of 

records or documents to validate/support the claim and/or 

unreconciled reciprocal accounts”. 

 

8.3 In CO, out of the total outstanding balance of fund transfer to DBM-PS of 
₱6,649,118,034.83, the amount of ₱1,440,477,817.04 or 22 percent pertains to 

the current year, whereas the amount of ₱5,208,640,217.79 or 78 percent 

pertains to prior years’ fund transfers pertains to the procurement of computer 

hardware and software for distribution to various public elementary, and 

secondary schools nationwide under the DCP, and the procurement of various 

instructional materials/textbooks/learning materials for public schools 

nationwide. 

 

8.4 Analysis of transactions revealed that the outstanding balance of advances by 
DepEd to DBM-PS for  the procurements of computer hardware and software 

under the DCP, and various instructional materials/textbooks/learning 

materials for public schools nationwide, amounted to ₱5,031,954,110.41 and 

₱502,834,711.74, respectively, or a total of ₱5,534,788,822.15 or 83 percent 

of the balance of ₱6,649,118,034.83.  

 

8.5 In NCR, out of the total of ₱855,018.75 paid in advance by SDO Proper of 
Valenzuela, Malabon and Navotas to the DBM-PS for the purchase of various 

equipment, supplies and materials and other commonly used items, deliveries 

worth ₱510,116.58 were made and taken-up in the books of the SDOs, leaving 

a balance of ₱344,902.17.  

 

8.6 While in SDO Quezon City, excess payments/advances to DBM-PS totaling 
₱4,139,513.09 have been noted, which were not yet refunded to the SDO nor 

deducted from the succeeding fund transfers. The amount could have been 

used to procure other needed supplies and/or developmental projects. 

 

8.7 Transfer of funds without meticulously monitoring the liquidations and timely 
delivery of the procured items may adversely affect the efficient program 

delivery of the DepEd. It also resulted in the accumulation of undelivered 



299 

 

supplies and equipment. Moreover, the considerable delays in the deliveries 

deprived the SDOs of the use thereof at the time these were needed and left the 

funds idle for a long time in the hands of DBM-PS.  

 

8.8 We recommended that the Management: 
 

a) regularly reconcile records with those with the DBM-PS, monitor 
diligently the fund utilization and the timely delivery of procured 

items and immediately inform the PS-DBM about the existence of 

undelivered supplies to avoid the accumulation thereof; 

 

b) establish its own monitoring of deliveries of supplies and equipment 
procured from DBM-PS per APR and assign Agency Control Number 

(ACN) to facilitate reconciliation with the Accounting Office; and 

 

c) limit fund transfer and apply its current requirements from the 
transferred funds outstanding with the DBM-PS and/or demand the 

refund of the unutilized/dormant funds, and remit the same to the 

BTr. 

 

8.9 The Management commented as follows: 
 

Office/RO Management’s Comments 

CO The Management commented that in as much as both Offices (AMD and AD) 

do not concur with the continuous transfer of funds to DBM-PS due to the 

existing balances per books, they are not in the position to control new fund 

releases for approved programs/projects. For common-use supplies, the AMD 

is doing its best to prudently track the balances and to ensure   that   funds   

transferred   are   fully accounted. 

NCR Valenzuela - Management assured that the monitoring procedures that they 

have established is being strictly implemented to closely facilitate the 

reconciliation of transferred funds and items delivered. 

 

The Management of SDO Malabon stated the following actions taken on the 

audit findings, as follows: 

 

 Property and Supply Office promptly provide the Accounting Office 
documents pertinent to deliveries for the timely recording in the books; 

 

 The Property and Supply Office established its own monitoring of 
deliveries of supplies and equipment procured from DBM-PS per APR 

and assign ACN to facilitate reconciliation with the Accounting Office; 

and 

 

 The Property and Supply Office made a representation with the PS-DBM 
to facilitate the delivery of the undelivered items, especially those 

pertaining to CY 2019 and below, otherwise, required refund equivalent 

to its cost. 

 



300 

 

Office/RO Management’s Comments 

Furthermore, Management replied that all the recommendations will be taken 

seriously including the periodic reconciliation of reports and records by the 

Supply Officer and Accountant. 

 

Past Due/Dormant Receivables account 

 

9. Inadequate monitoring and control of receivables in eight ROs resulted in past 
due/dormant accounts with an aggregate indicative amount of ₱62,751,571.43, 

casting doubts on the propriety and validity of the transactions posted in the 

Receivables account. 
 

9.1 COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016, on Guidelines and 
Procedures on the Write-off of Dormant Receivable Accounts, Unliquidated 

Cash Advances, and Fund Transfers of NGAs, LGUs and GOCCs, prescribes 

the following: 

 

 Dormant Unliquidated Fund Transfers refer to advances granted by the 
source entity to implementing entity for the implementation of 

programs/projects which remained non-moving for ten years or more and 

where settlement could no longer be ascertained. 

 

 Write-off of Dormant Accounts is the process of derecognizing the asset 
account and the corresponding allowance for impairment from the books 

of accounts and transferring the same to the Registry of Accounts Written 

Off (RAWO). This does not mean condoning/extinguishing the obligation 

of the accountable officer/debtor. 

 

 This Circular shall not cover the write-off of loans and advances of 
Government Financial Institutions which are governed by pertinent 

provisions of the General Banking Act. 

 

 Likewise, it shall not cover the following: 
 

 Receivables arising from disallowances and charges; 
 Receivables arising from cash shortages; and 
 Claims from entities' officers and employees and other parties for 

transactions which are the subject of a pending case in court or before 

investigative authorities. 

 

 The Head of the government entity shall file the request for authority to 
write off dormant receivable accounts, unliquidated cash advances, and 

fund transfers to the COA Audit Team Leader (ATL) and/or Supervising 

Auditor (SA). No filing fee is required. 

 

 

 



301 

 

 The request shall be supported by the following documents:  
 

a. Schedule of dormant accounts by accountable officer/debtor/

b) secure the supporting documents from all possible records for the 
reconstruction and maintenance of SLs; 

 

c) require the Accountant to review and analyze the accounts to 
ascertain the collectability of the receivables and the probability of 

liquidation/refund from various accountable persons. Henceforth, 

consider requesting authority to write-off dormant accounts which 

could no longer be collected after exhaustion of all possible remedies, 

pursuant to COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016;  

 

d) intensify efforts to require the principal borrowers as well as the co-
makers of those who resigned, retired and deceased to pay the unpaid 

balance of their loans. In case of continuous default in payment of 

loans, seek assistance for the enforcement of legal remedies in the 

collection of dormant and long outstanding receivables and for the 

filing of appropriate charges; and 

 

e) strengthen the internal control in place, particularly in the processing 
of clearance of retiring employees or those who are transferring to 

other offices to ensure that all accountabilities are first 

settled/liquidated before issuance of said clearance. 

 

9.6 The Management commented as follows: 
 

Office/RO Management’s Comments 

CAR Management of SDO Abra agreed to the audit recommendations. 

I ROP - The Management has sent letters to the concerned GOCCs to confirm the 

existence of the receivable accounts. The Office has already received the replies of 

some of the GOCCs (PhilHealth, Pag-IBIG –La Union, Pag-IBIG-Dagupan City, 

GSIS-La Union). It will send another set of letters to GOCC's which have not yet 

responded. As to Other Receivables, the Accounting Section is currently reviewing 

all available documents that affect the dormant account to establish the validity and 

accuracy of claims. Furthermore, the accounting office will also request the COA's 



305 

 

Office/RO Management’s Comments 

assistance for the proper treatment of the dormant accounts. The requirements needed 

for the possible request for the write-off of the reciprocal accounts will be prepared 

subject to the evaluation and grant of authority to write-off from COA. 

 

Nueva Era NHS and Catagtaguen NHS - Management informed the Audit Team that 

the school bookkeepers attended a Seminar on the Reconciliation of Due from/Due 

to Regional Office Account and found that the school book balance and that of the 

RO are the same. During the seminar, the Regional Accountant advised the school 

bookkeepers to wait for further announcement when to close the said account. As of 

this time, no announcement has been made. The audit team noted the information and 

in constant monitoring on the dormant accounts. 

 

Vigan City - During the exit the conference, Management informed the Audit Team 

that due to the sudden pandemic that affected work arrangements of employees, 

where some of the staff and officials had to strictly work from home, they had to 

adjust to the new set up at work which made it difficult for them to accomplish their 

task as promptly as they should be, particularly in the reconciliation of accounts. 

However, they assured that they will still give preferential attention to this matter. 

 

Dagupan City - Management in their written comment stated that they will prepare 

the required pertinent documents of the request for authority to write-off the 

aforementioned intra-agency receivable account, and submit the same to the COA 

RO for review and approval. 

 

Urdaneta City - The Management acknowledged the said observation and 

commented that the Division Accountant was directed by the Schools Division 

Superintendent to personally coordinate this matter to the Regional and Central 

Office but unfortunately, because of the pandemic, face-to-face meeting was limited. 

However, online coordination with the RO was made where they reconciled with the 

balances. In this regard, they are willing to comply with the audit recommendation 

and will be requesting a write-off of the said accounts. 

 

La Union - Management already reconciled the Due from Regional Office account 

amounting to ₱5,324,564.36. A certification of the DepEd Regional Accountant will 

be secured to serve as basis for the adjustment in the books. They also committed to 

reconcile with the central office for the Due from Central Office account. 

IV-B The Accounting Unit committed to complete the supporting documents required in 

requesting to write-off the dormant account. 

V Masbate City - The Accountant responded that since her assumption in 2008, the 

subject loans receivable under the Provident Fund were already existing in the books, 

and that extra efforts have been exerted to check the status and whereabout of the 

teachers with loan balances, but to no avail. 

 

She added that inquiry with the Human Resource Office had been made but showed 

negative result since the concerned teachers did not appear in their plantilla of 

personnel, hence, a request for authority to write-off the said dormant receivables is 

being considered as these balances remained non-moving for the past 16 to 20 years. 

 

Masbate Province - The Accountant justified that various borrowers were already 

deceased or retired from the service and that most of them were not deducted of their 

loan balances, attributed to the practice before that the Division Clearance were 

issued without requiring the bookkeeper in-charge of Provident Loan to make sure 

that balances were settled prior to the issuance of clearance. 

 



306 

 

Office/RO Management’s Comments 

Nevertheless, he agreed to analyze the long-outstanding receivables and will request 

authority from the COA to write-off these dormant receivables, of which collection 

is uncertain or remained nil for several years now. 

VII The Management commented that they have started preparing the request for the 

write-off of dormant receivable accounts for submission to our office. However, they 

are still locating for the demand letters sent to two debtors to complete the 

attachments for the request. 

 

The Management also conducts regular monitoring of receivable accounts by sending 

updated statement of accounts and demand letters to their clients/debtors. 

X The Management commented that as per inquiry with of the previous Bookkeeper, 

the said inactive and dormant Other Receivables was not written-off because the 

documents needed to support the write-off was burnt by Fire Incident last April 30, 

2019. Thus, in Item 7.4 (b) of the Circular states that the existence of the applicable 

conditions as follow: Death of the accountable officer/employee/debtor. 

 

Further, we will supervene with COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 

2016. 

 

Deficiencies on granting Provident Fund loans 

 

10. Deficiencies totaling P11,642,754.62 in grants and collections of Provident Loans 
were observed in five ROs, contrary to the Revised Implementing Guidelines for 

DepEd Provident Fund, thus prejudicing qualified members to avail the same 

due to the inefficient administration of the Fund. 

 

10.1 The Provident Fund (PF) aims to provide DepEd officials and employees with 
various benefits and loan privileges listed as follows: 

 

a. Multi-Purpose Loan (MPL), whether for educational, medical, or 
emergency needs of the teacher/employee, or the immediate and other 

members of his/her family, major and minor house repairs/improvements, 

payment of loans from other private lending institutions (PLIs) and/or 

government financial institutions (GFIs), livelihood, and for other legal 

purposes; and 

 

b. Additional Loan, which shall be for extreme emergency cases only. 
 

10.2 Section 4 of the President Administrative Order No. 279 provides that the 
Board shall be directly responsible for the efficient and effective 

administration and management of the Fund.  

 

Functions and Responsibilities of the Board. The Board shall be directly 

responsible for the efficient and effective administration and management of 

the Fund. It shall have the following duties and functions: 

 

a. Promulgate, apply, and enforce the rules and regulations governing the use 
and operation of the fund; 



307 

 

b. Determine the type, use and amount of loans and other benefits that may 
be granted and prescribe the applicable repayment schedules and interest 

rates; 

c. Establish the eligibility requirements for applicants, claimants, and 
grantees; and 

d. Approve all loans, other benefits, and other payments from the Fund 
 

10.3 Paragraph 1, Section X.11 of DepEd Order No. 36, series of 2007 states that 
the National Regional Boards may allow renewal of loan provided that fifty 

percent (50%) of the previous loan has been paid, there are no pending 

applications for new loans, and the balance of the principal amount shall be 

deducted from the new loan. 

 

10.4 The above provision was amended under DepEd Order No. 037, s. 2018 or the 
Revised Implementing Guidelines for the DepEd Provident Fund, which states 

that the National/Regional Boards may allow renewal of loan provided that at 

least thirty percent (30%) of the existing loan has been paid, there are no 

pending applications for new loans, and the balance of the principal amount 

shall be deducted from the new loan. 

 

10.5 Item (e) of the same DepEd Order provides the following: 
 

 Effective November 2017, all types of loans shall have a contractual 
interest of six percent (6%) per annum, with no grace period on the start 

of payment of loan, computed using the diminishing/declining balance 

method wherein the interest per instalment period is calculated based on 

the outstanding balance of the PF loan at the beginning of each instalment 

period. 

 

 Total amount due, inclusive of principal and interest, will be payable in 
equal monthly amortizations. The borrower may opt for repayment period 

from 12 up to 60 months, subject to his/her capacity to pay. In all cases, 

repayment of loans shall be through automatic payroll deductions and 

over-the-counter payment in case of removal of PF deductions from the 

payroll. 

 

 The amount of loan amortization of the borrowers with outstanding PF 
loan balance as of November 2017 shall be maintained in the payroll until 

full payment. The PF Secretariat shall make necessary adjustment in the 

posting of borrowers’ respective accounts in SLs, and any excess 

payments for fully paid loans using the new method of loan computation 

shall be refunded to the concerned borrowers. 

 

10.6 Additional provision in the implementing guidelines pursuant to Board 
Resolution No. 03, series of 2007 provides that the total loan account of the 



308 

 

borrower shall not exceed the amount of One Hundred Thousand Pesos 

(₱100,000.00).

loan. Loan amortization period granted to borrower 

who was due to retire should have been computed 

up to the time of his/her retirement day only. 

 

b. Borrowers from the four DO’s were able to retire 
from service without settling their outstanding loan 

balances in full and/or issuance of a notarized 

promissory note stating that the outstanding loan 

balance shall be paid in full upon the receipt of 

his/her retirement/terminal leave benefits.

related to such loans disclosed the following 

observation: 

 

a. Provident loans totaling P100,000.00 were granted 
to two personnel despite their ineligibility to avail 

the same, owing to their multiple previous 

outstanding loan balances. 

 

b. Twenty-five employees were granted multiple 
provident loans remained overdue ranging from 5 

months to 13 years due to non-payment or non- 

deductions from the employees’ monthly payroll. 

 

c. Grant of anomalous Provident Loans. Failure of 
the DepEd-Davao del Sur Division to establish 

regularity on the granting of Provident Loans to 

various employees amounting to P150,000.00 due 

to forged documents, spurious claimants, forged 

signatures, approval of the same by the officers 

despite inappropriate/insufficient documentations, 

contravened DepEd Order No. 12 series of 2004 

and pertinent provisions of COA Circular No. 

2012-003, hence rendering the transactions 

irregular, hence  disallowed in audit.   

 

The Audit Team humbly opined that the main reason 

for any transaction to be processed/passed through 

multiple process/individuals or in this case, the PF 

Secretariat, is to maintain check and balance. Thus, 

every member has each own responsibility to scrutinize 

and verify the documents and be liable thereto for any 

issues/defects that may arise later and cannot be 

exempted thereof by claiming to have trusted other 

members for a transaction that he/she clearly has 

participated in.

10.8 The non-collection of provident loans due to the weakness of control in the 
processing of loans, proper monitoring and enforcement of collections within 

the prescribed due date, in violation of Item (e) of DepEd Order No. 037, s. 

2018, caused the accumulation of the loans receivable balances and depleted 

the funds available for the prospective borrowers especially in urgent situation. 

 

10.9 The Provident Fund’s integrity and viability will not be preserved and the 
widest and most equitable dispersal of the benefits, most particularly to 



311 

 

qualified applicants with lower salaries will not be attained if the existing 

practice on the manner of granting provident loans will continue. 

 

10.10 We recommended that the Management: 
 

a) observe strict adherence to established rules concerning Provident 
Fund; 

 

b) strictly enforce collection of loans through payroll deductions for 
those unbilled borrowers in compliance with the existing rules and 

regulation of the Provident Fund and enjoin the co-maker to pay their 

obligations on the delinquent borrowers being the secondary persons 

liable;  

 

c) ensure that borrowers who are about to retire, resign, or transfer shall 
only be cleared from accountabilities upon full settlement of their 

obligations; 

 

d) require the PF Accounting in-Charge to monitor properly the type of 
loans availed, properly deduct from loan renewals to the outstanding 

loan balances of the same loan type, as provided for under DO No. 37, 

s. 2018; 

 

e) require the person liable to settle the amount disallowed in audit of 
SDO Davao del Sur amounting to P100,000.00 and P 150,000.00 and 

require the Cashier to issue ORs to the paying employees/liable 

personnel, henceforth deposit it to the Provident Fund account; 

 

f) conduct investigation on the personnel involved in the anomalous 
granting of Provident Loan and enforce administrative sanctions, as 

warranted; and  

 

g) apprise the Audit Team on the status of the ongoing investigation 
against the former Provident Fund In-charge. 

 

10.11 The Management commented as follows:

granting and collection of will be adhered and that they 

ensure that the recommendations will be complied with.

Management replied to comply with the audit 

recommendations. 

VIII Northern Samar The SDS explained that they followed the provisions under 

DepEd Order No 12, s. 2004, in the approval on loans 

granted under the Provident Fund. However, he assured to 



312 

 

RO SDO Management’s Comments 

secure a signing authority from higher officials in order to 

comply with the recommendation. Furthermore, the 

Accountant explained that during their orientation in 

Tacloban City, it was emphasized that they can allow the 

grant of additional provident loan, as long as the employees 

Net Take Home Pay is still enough to pay the monthly 

amortization per DepEd Order No. 37, s. 2018. She assured 

to submit to the audit team a copy of said DepEd Order. 

X Misamis Oriental In its letter-reply dated March 9, 2021, Management 

informed that the Provident Fund in-charge was already 

instructed to properly evaluate the application forms of the 

borrowers and to identify the type of loans when posting in 

the accounting system to easily review the loans whether 

MPL or additional. The Accounting Unit assured that the 

PF in-charge will indicate the type of loan availed to 

monitor whether total loans availed are within the 

maximum loanable amount. Further, Management will 

review and verify those accounts disclosed which may have 

exceeded the allowed maximum loanable amount per loan 

type. As well, intensify the collection and close monitoring 

on the said individual accounts. Likewise, Management 

informed that they already initiated that the PF accounting 

in-charge abide with the DO.37, s.2018 to properly deduct 

from loan renewals the outstanding loan balances falling 

under the same loan type. 

Valencia City The recommendations enumerated in the AOM including 

those discussed during the Exit Conference will be followed 

by the Division Office to address the deficiencies noted. 

XI Davao Del Sur The Management has already issued demand letters. Hence, 

there are already some personnel who started settling their 

Provident Fund loans. Moreover, Management stated that 

they are already strict and transparent with respect to the 

granting of PF loans. They further said that the Secretariat 

will strictly scrutinize the papers as to the qualification of 

those who will avail of the loan. 

 

The SDS stated that some of the debtors whom they have 

issued demand letters said that they don’t have the money 

to settle their loan balances. Hence, they suggested that they 

will reapply to restructure their loans and deduct their old 

accounts. Also, he added that the Management is planning 

to convene with the personnel affected regarding the issue 

on PF loans. 

 

Inefficiency on Collecting Receivables 

 

11. The collection efficiency of the past due receivables recorded under the Due from 
Officers and Employees account of the DepEd NCR-ROP totaling ₱326,608.05 at 

yearend remains low, despite the lapse of more than three years owing from the 

inadequate control measures in collecting the reported outstanding balance, 

contrary to Section 6 of COA Circular No. 2016-005. Likewise, inefficiency of the 

SDO-Samar to collect the Other Receivables aging 130 to 281 days amounting to 



313 

 

₱146,178. 07 as of December 31, 2020 is contrary to Section 2 of PD No. 1445 

which unfavorably affects the Agency’s operation. 

 

11.1 Section 2 of PD No. 1445 states: 
 

Section 2. Declaration of Policy. It is the declared policy of the State 

that all resources of the government shall be managed, expended or 

utilized in accordance with law and regulations, and safeguard against 

loss or wastage through illegal or improper disposition, with a view to 

ensuring efficiency, economy and effectiveness in the operations of 

the government. The responsibility to take care that such policy is 

faithfully adhered to rests directly with the chief or head of the 

government agency concerned. 

 

11.2 Section 6 of COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016 states that: 
 

6.1  All government entities shall conduct regular monitoring and 

analysis of receivable accounts to ensure that these are collected 

when these become due and demandable xxx; and 

 

6.2  All government entities shall prepare the schedule of all 

receivables, unliquidated cash advances, and fund transfer as of 

December 31, 2015 and quarterly thereafter. (see Appendix 55, 

Vol. II, GAM). 

11.3 Review and analysis of Due from Officers and Employees account of DepEd 
NCR-ROP revealed that of the total reported balance of ₱351,208.05, the 

amount of ₱326,608.05 pertains to the remaining uncollected past due 

receivables which, arises from the erroneous preparation of the September 

2017 payroll for the salaries of Quezon City Teachers.  

 

11.4 Initially, a total amount of ₱598,288.55 was erroneously credited to the 
accounts of the said teachers. Then, for CYs 2017, 2018, and 2019, the Agency 

collected only an aggregate amount of ₱271,680.50, thus leaving an 

outstanding balance of ₱326,608.05 as of December 31, 2020. Details are as 

follows:

11.5 It can be gleaned that the collectability of the outstanding receivables remained 
low despite the lapse of three years, signifying the Agency's below-par 

collection efforts during that period. It is also worth mentioning that no 

collection was made in CY 2020. 



314 

 

 

11.6 Verification disclosed that the said book balance was not supported with an 
aging schedule, detailing the overdue accounts and the number of days such 

accounts were delayed, thereby affecting the verifiability of the account 

balance of the receivables account. 

 

11.7 The non-preparation of an aging schedule is a clear indication of poor financial 
management system wherein the aging schedule is an important tool that will 

help keep track and measure the outstanding accounts, focusing on the past 

due receivables and demanding prompt payment from its accountable officers 

and employees. 

 

11.8 Likewise, the inefficiency of SDO-Samar to collect the Other Receivables 
account aging 130 to 281 days amounting to ₱146,178.07 is contrary to Section 

2 of PD No. 1445. Other receivables account balance resulted from the double 

payment of catering services, over payment of tax, and erroneous payment of 

travel reimbursement. Said receivables may not have appeared from the 

records at yearend had the collection been effected strictly. Also, had 

withholding of taxes been practices diligently on similar transactions, this kind 

of receivables should not have existed which effect deprives the government 

of added income. 

 

11.9 It is worthy to note that the longer the receivables go uncollected, the less likely 
they are to be ever collected, either partially or in full; hence regular 

monitoring and analysis of the account must be consistently undertaken by the 

agency. 

 

11.10 We recommended that the Management: 
 

a) send demand letters to concerned employees to collect the receivables 
and continuously monitor the settlements thereof; 

 

b) coordinate with the authorized officials of concerned RPSU’s and the 
concerned employees to expedite the collection of the outstanding 

accounts receivable balances; and  

 

c) prepare regularly and submit the aging schedule of receivables based 
on the age of accounts as required in COA Circular No. 2016-005. 

 

11.11 The Management commented as follows: 
 

Office/SDO Management’s Comments 

NCR - ROP The Management, in their letter dated March 25, 2021, commented 

that the outstanding amount of ₱326,608.05 in the Due from Officers 

and Employees account pertains to the erroneous crediting of the 

teacher's payroll account which has been monitored, and demand

Office/SDO Management’s Comments 

letters has been sent to accountable officers through the RPSU in 

coordination with the SDO of Quezon City to facilitate collections.  

 

Management committed to issuing demand letters again this year to 

each accountable personnel with outstanding balances still reflected on 

the Ageing of Due from Officers and Employees account. 

 

The Management also submitted an Ageing Schedule of the Due from 

Officers and Employees account along with the payment schedules and 

outstanding balances for reference of the Audit Team.

₱2,791,640,657.24 revealed the following deficiencies: (a) unliquidated cash 

advances (CAs) aging 30 days to more than one year totaling P697,519,203.37; 

(b) long outstanding and dormant CAs not requested for write-off amounting to 

P2,924,534.64; (c) advances not liquidated within the prescribed period totaling 

P405,895,346.73; (d) grant of additional CAs even if the previous ones were not 

yet settled totaling P316,622,433.96; (e) excess/unutilized CAs not immediately 

refunded/returned of P52,023,639.00; (f) late submission/non-submission of LRs; 

(g) incomplete documentary requirements; (h) non-liquidation of CA despite the

12.10 Existence of the substantial accumulated unliquidated cash advances is 
attributable to the lapses in the controls placed by Management in the granting,

Various payments lacking proper documentation and/or legal basis 
 

13. Various disbursements incurred by DepEd CO and its ROs in the aggregate 
amount of ₱3,986,908,908.86, which were paid despite inadequate supporting 

documents and/or without legal basis to support the claims  contravene 

applicable laws, rules and regulations; hence casting doubts on the validity, 

propriety and reasonableness of these expenditures funded by government funds. 
 

13.1 Section 2 of PD No. 1445 provides that: 
 

It is the declared policy of the State that all resources of the government 

shall be managed, expended or utilized in accordance with law and 

regulations, and safeguarded against loss or wastage through illegal or 

improper disposition, with a view to ensuring efficiency, economy and 

effectiveness in the operations of government. The responsibility to take 

care that such policy is faithfully adhered to rests directly with the chief or 

head of the government agency concerned. 

 

While Section 4 of the same provision provides that disbursements or 

disposition of government funds or property shall: (1) invariably bear the 

approval of the proper officials; (2) claims against government funds shall 

be supported with complete documentation; and (3) all laws and regulations 

applicable to financial transactions shall be faithfully adhered to. 
 

13.2 Likewise, COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 prescribes the 
documentary requirements for common government transactions. Included 

therein is the provision, among others, that claims against government funds 

shall be supported with complete documentation. 
 

13.3 Meanwhile, COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012 prescribes 
the Updated Guidelines for the prevention and disallowance of Irregular, 

Unnecessary, Excessive, Extravagant and Unconscionable Expenditures. 
 

a) Disbursements without proper documentation 
 

13.4 Results of the post-audit of transactions in the ROs, SDOs and its IUs for CY

community quarantine were without legal basis and not 

supported with adequate documents. The Management 

of DepEd NCR-ROP did not issue clear guidelines on 

the reimbursement of transportation expenses as they 

adopt the Alternative Work Arrangement, which 

resulted in the following deficiencies in the audit: 

  

a. Reimbursements of transportation expenses at a 

different rate; b. Non-attachment of Authority to report 

to work or Certification as member of the designated 

SWF and Accomplishment Report; c. Payment of

Irregularities on the payment of per diem during the 

inspection of delivery of tools, equipment and materials 

for the SHS TVL. The grant of per diem amounting to 

₱12,760.00 is not in consonance with EO No. 77 as the 

areas inspected are not beyond the 50-kilometer radius, 

thus considered an irregular expense. 

12,760.00  

From January to November 2020, the Regional Director 

(RD) claimed a total of ₱75,773.65 for telephone 

expenses. The allowable rate of telephone expenses for 

RD under DepEd Order No. 017, s. 2019 is only 

₱4,000.00 per month. Post-audit of the amount claimed 

during the period show that it is exceeded by 

₱31,773.65.

The GSIS contributions totaling ₱625,408.56 had 

checks initially issued under the MDS account in CY 

2019. But due to the unmatched records with the GSIS, 

the checks have not been remitted and became stale. 

Since the cash balance of MDS for CY 2019 had already 

lapsed and has been reverted to the BTr, the Agency 

resorted to utilizing the LCCA account. 

625,408.56 

In CY 2020, the Agency made a tax refund using the 

cash available at LCCA to its two (2) employees under 

Check Nos. 353243 and 353244 amounting ₱7,585.09 

and ₱21,697.64, respectively, or a total amount of 

₱29,282.73, for the excess withholding tax paid in CY 

2019. Tax refund should have been taken from its 

regular CY 2020 appropriations. 

29,282.73 

The Manchester United School Foundation was 

refunded from the cash balance of LCCA for the double 

payment of the inspection fee amounting to ₱4,040.00 

for School Year (SY) 2019-2020. However, the 

collection of inspection fees were already remitted to

obligated, leaving an unobligated balance of ₱23,998,418,978.54, or equivalent to 

a marginal percentage of 4.31 percent as at yearend, which was not availed  due 

to a) savings from taxes, procurement, and alternative mode of training and

14.1 Government Budget is the financial plan of the government for a given period, 
usually for a fiscal year, which shows what its resources are and how they will 

be generated and used over the fiscal period. The budget is the government’s 

key instrument for promoting its socio-economic objectives. It also refers to 

the income, expenditures, and sources of borrowings of the National 

Government (NG) that are used to achieve national objectives, strategies, and 

programs.  

 

14.2 The DepEd is mandated through RA No. 9155, otherwise known as the 
Governance of Basic Education Act of 2001, to formulate, implement, and 

coordinate policies, plans, programs, and projects in the areas of formal and 

non-formal basic education. It supervises all the elementary and secondary 

education institutions, including alternative learning systems, both public and 

private; and provides for the establishment and maintenance of a complete, 

adequate, and integrated system of basic education relevant to the goals of 

national development. 

 

14.3 Section 60 of the RA No. 11465, or the GAA of FY 2020, and Section 3.4 of 
the NBC No. 578 dated January 6, 2020 state that all appropriations authorized 

under the FY 2020 GAA shall be available for release and disbursement for the 

purpose specified until December 31, 2020. It highly encouraged, among 

others, the full budget utilization of each agency and provides guidelines on 

the release of funds for FY 2020, to wit: 
 



346 

 

1.0 Purposes 
 

1.1 To provide policies, procedures, rules and regulations on the 
release, utilization of funds, and monitoring of items authorized 

under Republic Act No. 11465, the FY 2020 General 

Appropriations Act (GAA), in accordance with the General and 

Specific Provisions thereof. 

 

1.2 To synchronize fund release with the implementation of the 
overall physical and financial plans, targets and schedules 

submitted by the departments, agencies, and/or operating units 

(OUs). 

 

1.3 To institutionalize a simplified, streamlined monitoring ad 
evaluation of performance information through the required 

budgetary reports. 

 

3.0 General Guidelines 
 

3.4.5 After the end of validity period, all unreleased appropriations 

or unexpended or undisbursed funds shall revert to the 

unappropriated surplus of the General Fund, in accordance 

with Section 28, Chapter 4, Book VI of EO No. 292 and shall 

not be available for expenditure except by subsequent 

legislative enactment.   

 

14.4 However, RA No. 11520, as approved by the President on December 29, 2020 
extended the availability of the FY 2020 appropriations for Maintenance and 

Other Operating Expenses (MOOE) and Capital Outlay (CO) up to December 

31, 2021. 
 

14.5 DBM Circular Letter No. 2013-12 dated November 21, 2013 was issued to 
further enhance the ability of agencies to fully utilize their NCAs. It provides 

that the comprehensive NCAs to be released shall be based on the agency’s 

submitted Monthly Disbursement Program (MDP). It also prescribes that all 

NCAs for crediting to the Regular MDS sub-accounts shall be valid until the 

last working day of the 3rd month of the particular quarter. 

 

14.6 DBM Circular Letter No. 2016-9 dated October 27, 2016 requires agencies to 
prepare a realistic MDP for the implementation of their programs and projects, 

taking into consideration the seasonality of activities, scheduled work targets 

of capital outlays, and timing of the grant of benefits, allowances and other 

similar items of expenditures. 
 

14.7 Section 70(b) of the General Provisions (GP) of FY 2020 GAA provides that 
the following modifications are allowed, subject to approval by the DBM and 

timely submission of reports by all offices: (i) from one allotment class to 

another; (ii) from one operating unit to another; (iii) within a special purpose 



347 

 

fund; and (iv) for the payment of magna carta benefits authorized under 

Section 50 of the same GP. 

 

14.8 Section 46 of PD No. 1117, the Budget Reform Decree of 1977, is quoted in 
part that “No obligation shall be certified to accounts payable unless the 

obligation is founded on a valid claim that is properly supported by sufficient 

evidence and unless there is proper authority for its incurrence.  Any 

certification for a non-existent or fictitious obligation and/or creditor shall be 

considered void.” 
 

14.9 Further, Section 11, Chapter 3, of the GAM for NGAs Volume I provides that 
the incurrence of obligations shall be made through the issuance of Obligation 

Request and Status (ORS) (Appendix 11). The ORS shall be prepared by the 

Requesting/Originating Office supported by valid claim documents like DVs, 

payrolls, purchase/job orders, itinerary of travel, etc. The Head of the 

Requesting/Originating Office or his/her authorized representative shall 

certify in the Section A of the ORS as to the necessity and legality of charges 

to the budget under his/her supervision, and validity, propriety, and legality of 

Supporting Documents. The Head of the Budget Division/Unit shall certify to 

the availability of allotment and such is duly obligated by signing in Section B 

of the ORS. 
 

14.10 Clearly from the abovementioned regulations, budgeting requires from the 
Department a greater discipline in its preparation and utilization.  It enforces, 

among others, that the original intent of the appropriation law, as it was planned 

and legislated, will be fully executed within the year.  This will also ensure that 

they will focus on executing the budget of the current FY and not from the prior 

years. Further, it is expected to quicken their program implementation, as well 

as strengthen their focus and accountability as the targeted outputs of the 

programs/projects/activities become more evidently linked to their 

appropriated budget.  
 

14.11 Review of the DepEd’s Consolidated Statement of Appropriations, Allotments, 
Obligations Disbursements and Balances (SAAODB) for CY 2020 showed that

Notice of Suspension Nos. 21-001-MOOE (19) and 21-002-

MOOE (19) for the procurement of learning toolkits in 2019 using 

the school MOOE, the SDO opted to conduct a centralized 

procurement of goods and services for the purpose of distributing 

the same among districts. Such action is considered an 

infringement to the School Heads’ disbursing authority over the 

funds pertaining to their respective schools.

Camiguin It was noted that for GMS - CO and TX and Other IMs programs 

of the division, the corresponding whole amount of ₱1,000,000.00 

and ₱97,436.00, respectively, allotments received were not used 

or obligated during the year. Also, of the unobligated allotments 

for MOOE, the highest unexpended amounts were intended for 

Other Supplies and Materials, ₱1,072,729.31 was under Regular 

Agency Fund and another ₱1,235,597.38 under SPF. Upon 

inquiry, it was learned that the delayed release of the Letters of 

Advice of Allotment (LAA) by the RO to the Division was one 

cause why the funds were not fully utilized on time.  

3,536,348.56 

XIII ROP DepEd RO XIII received on December 23, 2020 a Sub-ARO 

under OSEC 13-20-2996 to cover funding requirements for the 

implementation of programs under FLO. The allotment was valid 

for obligation until December 31, 2020. Subsequently, said fund 

was sub-allotted by the RO to 13 different SDOs and IUs on 

December 29, 2020. Inquiry with the Chief of Finance disclosed 

that few weeks prior to the release of Sub-ARO to the RO, the 

concerned focal person at the CO had a meeting with its 

counterpart at the RO and inquired on the necessity of fund at the 

Regional level. It was somehow admitted that the sub-allotment 

was released very late to the RO, thus restricted the concerned 

end-users and concerned personnel to process and facilitate 

efficiently the necessary documents for obligation as the validity 

of which expired on December 31, 2020 as provided under RA 

No. 11464.

14.14 Inquiry with the Management disclosed the following justifications as to the 
non-utilization, to wit: 

 

Office/RO SDOs Reasons on the Non-Utilization of NCAs 

CO   Non-submission/receipt of billings from PEAC for the 
conduct of GASTPE programs during the third quarter 

period 

NCR Taguig/Pateros  Delayed billing/claims of contractors for capital outlays 



355 

 

Office/RO SDOs Reasons on the Non-Utilization of NCAs 

 Late implementation of the SBFP for SY 2020-2021 

 Late receipt of various Sub-AROs 

Manila  Late implementation of the SBFP for SY 2020-2021 

 Late receipt of various Sub-AROs 

Malabon  Non-implementation of some of the activities caused by 
the restrictions brought about by the current COVID-19 

pandemic. 

 Prior year’s accounts payable which were reverted due 
to wrong specifications on the delivered laptops 

amounting to ₱24,654,085.98.  

 Delayed delivery of modules amounting to 
₱8,359,809.80. 

 Reverted NCAs were actual provisions for the hiring of 
teaching and non-teaching personnel in CY 2020 

inclusive of all the various benefits like yearend 

bonuses, cash gifts and productivity enhancement 

incentives. 

Mandaluyong  Late Memo/Guidelines for the SRI payment. 

 Remittances to DepEd NCR was not processed on time. 

 Late payment of March 2020 HDMF contribution due to 
lockdown. 

 Excess allocation of PS funds. 

 Late receipt of PS funds - the fund was intended for the 
salary of the newly hired personnel and excess funds for 

CY 2020. 

Navotas  Non-implementation of some of the activities caused by 
the restrictions brought about by the current COVID-19 

pandemic. 

 Reverted NCAs were actual provisions for the hiring of 
teaching and non-teaching personnel in CY 2020 

inclusive of all the various benefits like yearend 

bonuses, cash gifts and productivity enhancement 

incentives. 

Valenzuela  Non-implementation of some of the activities caused by 
the restrictions brought about by the current COVID-19 

pandemic 

 Discontinuance of the repairs and maintenance in the 
Dalandan NHS 

 Travel restrictions 

 Minimal consumption of supplies and materials 

 Inability to pursue the various trainings and seminars 

 

14.15 Sound management practice requires, among others, the efficient and effective 
management and utilization of its available budget and cash resources 

following strictly the existing rules and regulations on the matter. Primarily, 

the alignment of its approved budget including the cash requirements for the 

period vis-à-vis the programs/activities/projects scheduled to be implemented 

during the year must be assured to avoid the excess allocation of its funds 

intended for the proper implementation and delivery of its planned outputs. 

 



356 

 

14.16 Being an implementing arm of the government in promoting basic education, 
the existence of unobligated allotments and lapsed/unutilized NCAs reflects 

Management’s inability to maximize the use of its authorized budgetary and 

cash requirements; thus, depriving all of its students/beneficiaries of the 

maximum benefits that can be derived from the allocated funds.

CAR Benguet DVs for the procurement of supplies and materials to be

reversion of unused cash allocations. 

393,565.00 

Baguio City  Baguio City NHS DVs for the Semi-Expendable ICT

434,373.00 

VIII Tacloban City MDS Check was erroneously issued to the BTr to return 

the unutilized portion of the SBFP Fund received by the 

Agency in 2016 under their Trust Fund account (LBP 

001732-1011-08). Consequently, upon realization of the 

mishap, the Division Cashier then issued another check 

(No. 1144110 dated 9/21/2020) under the Trust Fund. 

Thus, resulted in a disbursement amounting to 

P826,307.76 under the MDS account without an 

appropriation. 

826,307.76 

 Total 1,654,245.76 

 

14.17 It must be emphasized that charges against an allotment should always be 
supported with valid, proper, and legitimate documents. The practice of 

obligating funds even without valid claimants and lacking in supporting 

documents contravenes the specific provisions indicated in Section 46 of PD 

No. 1177.

₱19,057.5, ₱274,309.69 and ₱84,862.31, respectively, 

were not submitted to the Office of the Auditor, thus 

renders difficulty for the Audit Team to identify what 

nature of expenses had the Agency incurred. 

 Total 4,972,916.62 

 

14.18 The payment of MOOE made by the NSNHS were suspended in audit because 
of the absence of statutory authority for its grant, citing Section 84(1) of P.D. 

No. 1445, otherwise known as the Government Auditing Code of the 

Philippines, which provides that revenue funds shall not be paid out of any 

public treasury or depository except in pursuance of an appropriation law or 

other specific statutory authority. 

 

d.3.) Obligation of funds prior to the perfection of a valid contract in 
Albay 

 

14.19 Upon evaluation of the ORS attached in the DVs, the Audit Team observed 
two different dates i.e., a) the earlier date written by the Budget Staff upon 

assignment of the ORS number; and, b.) the later date written by the Budget 

Officer upon certifying and signing Box B of the ORS.  These two dates were 

significantly apart from one another.  Either considered as the actual obligation 

date will be contrary to the provisions of Section 2.j, Chapter 3 of the GAM for 

NGAs GAM and DepEd Order No. 35 s. 2017.   

 

14.20 Thus, if the Audit Team consider the earlier date as the date of actual 
obligation, the later and subsequent contract dates will show that the obligation 

was made prior to a valid perfected contract and purposely done to avoid the 

validity of the fund from lapsing.  In the same way, if the Audit Team consider 

the later date affixed by the Budget Officer as the date of obligation, the 3-

month period to obligate funds under DepEd Order No. 35 s. 2017 will be 

violated. 

 

14.21 Upon audit inquiry, the Audit Team discovered some procedural lapses 
especially in the monitoring and processing of documents, some of the audit 

recommendations in this regard has already been stated in the issued AOM No. 

2020-02-2020.  In the instant case, however, the Audit Team was informed that 

the earlier date supplied by the budget staff, upon assigning an ORS number, 

was the actual date of fund obligation; and the later certification by the Budget 

Officer in Box B of the ORS was the time when the documents are substantially 

completed to support the certification as to the availability of allotment and its 

obligation in the ORS. 

 

 

 



358 

 

14.22 We recommended that the Management require the following offices: 
 

CO, NCR, CAR, V, X and XIII to – 

 

a) maximize the utilization of the budget and disbursement of NCAs it 
received within the period of its validity to ensure that the optimum 

results and benefits derived from the funds would be realized; 

 

b) observe efficiency in the implementation of the 
programs/activities/projects to fully achieve the objectives and 

address the needs of its intended beneficiaries; 

 

c) intensify the hiring of unfilled plantilla positions for teaching and non-
teaching personnel of the SDOs/IUs/Non-IUs through publication of 

the vacant positions; 

 

d) present a catch-up action plan including interventions on the 
programs with unutilized/underutilized allotments in FY 2020; 

 

e) CO to give an explanation on the reason/s for the significant difference 
between the ABC and the contract cost in the procurement of DCP 

packages and the printing and delivery of Learning Resources; 

 

f) CO, NCR, CAR, ROs X and XIII  to promptly request/issue allotment 
to the concerned offices/focal person to enable the effective and 

efficient utilization of funds intended for its planned projects and 

programs; 

 

g) RO X – SDO Misamis Occidental to immediately download 
unreleased School MOOEs to respective schools. Strictly abide by the 

guidelines of DepEd Order No. 8, s. 2019 in the direct release, use, 

monitoring and reporting of School MOOE Allocations; 

 

CAR SDOs Benguet and Baguio City to – 

 

h) strictly require the School Heads to observe the prescribed timeline in 
the submission of their liquidation documents; 

 

i) utilize all NCA releases for Regular MDS Sub-Accounts only for the 
payment of due and demandable A/Ps and within the validity period 

of such releases; 

 

j) ensure that disbursements are supported with duly approved ORS 
and supporting documents before processing of payments is made, to 

establish the propriety, validity, legality, and authority of 

disbursements;  

 



359 

 

k) CAR SDO Benguet to require the School Heads to increase their 
fidelity bonds enough to cover their actual accountabilities, especially 

for the School Heads with cluster schools; 

 

l) RO VIII SDO Tacloban City  to stop all payments for expenditures 
without an appropriation; 

 

m) CAR, ROs I and XII to observe the rules on modification in the 
allotment as provided in the GP of the FY 2020 GAA;  

 

n) RO I - SDOs Pangasinan I and II to inform top-level Management on 
the issue of non-appropriation for capital outlays thru proper 

channels to capacitate the schools, not only during this time of 

pandemic, to purchase the said equipment and other necessary capital 

expenditures that may help in the efficient and effective delivery of 

services, as well as increase the performance efficiency of school 

personnel; and 

 

o) RO V - SDO Albay to refrain from obligating funds without a valid 
and perfected contract, and strictly adhere to the 3-month period of 

obligation as provided under DepEd Order No. 35 s. 2017. 

 

14.23 The Management’s Comments and Auditor’s Rejoinder are presented in Annex 
H. 

 

Non-compliance with the IRR of RA No. 9184 and Other Issuances on Government 

Procurement 

 

15. Various  procedural lapses in adhering with the provisions of RA No. 9184 or the 
Government Procurement Reform Act, COA and other related rules and 

regulations  in the procurement of goods and services, infrastructure related 

projects including consultancy services totaling ₱5.68 billion at the DepEd CO, 

and  ₱1.84 billion in the 14 ROs and several SDOs were noted, such as: a) 

delayed/failure to submit contracts/POs and supporting documents totaling P 

P1,038,826,903.71 to COA for review; b) over-estimated Approved Budget for 

the Contract (ABC) of P357,912,310.40 for the six procurement projects of the 

Bureau of Learning Resources – Learning Resources Production Division (BLR-

LRPD); c) non-observance of the required procurement timelines for the 

P129,657,066.81 projects; d) procurements of goods thru reimbursement of 

P22,115,985.27 or by splitting of POs/Requisition in the total amount of  

P15,083,663.29; and  e) other deficiencies that cast doubt on the validity, integrity 

and reliability of the procurement processes and defeating the purpose of the law 

on transparency, competitiveness and accountability. 

 

15.1 In line with the commitment of the Government of the Philippines (GOP) to 
promote good governance and its efforts to adhere to the principles of 



360 

 

transparency, accountability, equity, efficiency and economy in the 

procurement process. It is the policy of the GoP that procurement of Goods, 

Infrastructure Projects and Consulting Services shall be competitive and 

transparent, and therefore shall undergo competitive bidding, except as 

provided in Rule XVI, Section 3 of the Revised IRR of RA No. 9184, hence 

must be upheld dutifully, which reads:    
 

The procurement of the GoP shall be governed by these principles: 

 

a) Transparency in the procurement process and in the implementation 
of procurement contracts through wide dissemination of bid 

opportunities and participation of pertinent non-government 

organizations.  

b) Competitiveness by extending equal opportunity to enable private             
contracting parties who are eligible and qualified to participate in 

competitive bidding. 

c) Streamlined procurement process that will uniformly apply to all 
government procurement. The procurement process shall be simple 

and made adaptable to advances in modern technology in order to 

ensure an effective and efficient method. 

d) System of accountability where both the public officials directly or 
indirectly involved in the procurement process as well as in the 

implementation of procurement contracts and the private parties that 

deal with GoP are, when warranted by circumstances, investigated 

and held liable for their actions relative thereto.  

e) Public monitoring of the procurement process and the 
implementation of awarded contracts with the end in view of 

guaranteeing that these contracts are awarded pursuant to the 
provisions of the Act and this IRR, and that all these contracts are 

performed strictly according to specifications.  

 

15.2 Section 7.1 of the Revised IRR of RA No. 9184 provides that:  
 

All procurement shall be within the approved budget of the Procuring 

Entity and should be meticulously and judiciously planned by the 

Procuring Entity. Consistent with government fiscal discipline 

measures, only those considered crucial to the efficient discharge of 

governmental functions shall be included in the Annual Procurement 

Plan (APP). For purposes of this IRR, a procurement project shall be 

considered crucial to the efficient discharge of governmental functions 

if it is required for the day-to-day operations or is in pursuit of the 

principal mandate of the Procuring Entity concerned. x  x  x

Sec. 3.1.1 of COA Circular 2009-001 provides that “Within 

five (5) working days from the execution of a contract by the 

government or any of its subdivisions, agencies or xxx, a 

copy of said contract and each of all the documents forming 

part thereof by reference or incorporation shall be 

furnished to the auditor of the agency concerned.”

No original or authenticated 

copies of contract and 

supporting documents were 

submitted. 

Section 3.1.1 of COA Circular 2009-001 quoted under item 

no. three (3) and existing jurisprudence on the matter. 

The general rule is that the photocopies of documents are 

inadmissible. As held in various judicial rulings and the

to the third civil degree. Failure to comply with the 

aforementioned provision shall be a ground for the 

automatic disqualification of the bid in consonance with 

Section 30 of this IRR. For this reason, relation to the 

aforementioned persons within the third civil degree of 

consanguinity or affinity shall automatically disqualify the 

bidder from participating in the procurement of contracts of

15.5 It is worth to note the CY 2020 Audit Observations is almost identical with the 
deficiencies noted in CY 2019 particularly the first three observations and at 

same time these are deficiencies of all the 10 reviewed contracts, to wit: 

 

a. Copies of perfected contracts and supporting documents were submitted 
to the Auditor`s Office beyond five (5) working days from receipt by the 

winning bidder of the Notice to Proceed; 

b. No original or authenticated copies of contract and supporting documents 
were submitted; and 

c. The non-submission of some of the required documents needed to 
facilitate and complete the auditorial and legal review/evaluation of the 

contracts. 

 

15.6 Hence, it is appropriate to call the attention of DepEd Management to the 
provision of Section 39 of PD No. 1445, to wit: 

 

Section 39. Submission of papers relative to government obligations.  

1.  x  x x 

2.  x  x x 

3. It shall be the duty of the officials or employees concerned including 

those in non-government entities under audit, or affected in the audit of 

government and non-government entities, to comply promptly with these 

requirements. Failure or refusal to do so without justifiable cause shall 

constitute a ground for administrative disciplinary action x x x.  

 

15.7 It was also noted that of the 11 Completed Procurement Activities (CPAs), six 
procurement projects of the Bureau of Learning Resources – Learning 



367 

 

Resources Production Division (BLR-LRPD) are with over-estimated

15.8 The over-estimated ABC amounting to P357,912,310.40 is the result of poor 
planning attributed from an unrealistic and excessive cost components of the 

ABC contrary with the Manual of Procedures for the Procurement of Goods and 
Services, which states that: 

 

In determining the ABC, the PMO or end-user unit, with the assistance of 

the TWG (when necessary), must consider the different cost components, 

namely:  

 

a. The cost or market price of the product or service itself;  
b. Incidental expenses like freight, insurance, taxes, installation 

costs, training costs, if necessary, and cost of inspection;  

c. The cost of money, to account for government agencies usually 
buying on credit terms; 

d. Inflationary factor, since the planning phase is usually done one 
year ahead of the actual procurement date;  

e.  Quantities, considering that buying in bulk usually means lower 
unit prices; and  

f. The supply of spare parts and/or maintenance services, if these 
are part of the contract package. 

 

15.9 The PE is also reminded of the GPPB Non-Policy Matter Opinion No. 022-
2011 dated December 23, 2011, where: 

 

It is the task of the procuring entity to ensure that in adopting an ABC, 

the contract cost or estimate must not be excessively high or 

unreasonably low to the detriment of government interest. The valuation 

of the procurement activity must be cost-efficient and, at the same time, 

realistic since the procuring entity dictates the range of the prices it 

would like to receive.

15.10 Moreover, we have noted that the allocated quantity for the activity sheets 
purchased during the year exceeded the number of enrollees per SY 2020-2021 

by 122,331 for the Kindergarten, 140,896 for Grade 1 and 77,278 for Grade 4 or

15.12 Clearly, the over-estimation of the cost components in the determination of a 
realistic ABC can be attributed to the absence of meticulous and judicious 

procurement planning as required under Section 7.1 of IRR of RA No. 9184 

and the Manual of Procedures for the Procurement of Goods and Services. 

 
15.13 In view of the foregoing, DepEd as Procuring Entity exerted inadequate effort 

to adhere to the principles of transparency, accountability, equity, efficiency 

and economy in the procurement process. Likewise, the non-compliance 

thereof with the existing procurement regulations based on the available 

documents forwarded by Management to date affected the validity of the 

consummated transactions. 

 
15.14 We recommended that Management: 

 
a) immediately submit the required documents duly certified to facilitate 

the legal/auditorial and technical review of the said contracts, to 

preclude audit suspension on related disbursements;  

 

b) institute corrective measures in procurement planning activities 
specifically in the establishment of a cost- efficient and realistic ABC 

guided by Sec. 7.1 of Revised IRR of RA No. 9184 and the Manual of 

Procedures for the Procurement of Goods and Services; 

 

c) explain/justify with verifiable basis why disbursements related to the  
procurements of the activity sheets with  allocated quantity for the 

purchased during the year exceeded the number of enrollees which 

were noted as non-compliant  with existing procurement law and the 

COA rules and regulations,  as mentioned above,  should not be 

suspended/disallowed in post-audit; and  

 

d) enjoin the BAC to strictly follow RA No. 9184 and its revised IRR.  
 

15.15 The common Management comments and Auditor’s rejoinders are presented 
in Annex I. 

 

Procurement at the ROs and SDOs 

 

15.16 Review, evaluation and analysis of contracts, PO and related documents as well 
as post-audit of delivered and paid procurement transactions revealed that 

procurement at the ROs and SDO did not strictly comply with the rules and 

regulations provided by IRR of RA No. 9184 and applicable COA issuances. 

Enumerated below are the deficiencies noted:

15.42 Non-compliance with the provisions of RA No. 9184 and its Revised IRR, 
applicable COA Circulars and other related procurement issuances defeated the 

purpose of the law in promoting transparency, competitiveness and 

accountability. These also cast doubt on the integrity and reliability of the 

procurement process being undertaken. 
 

15.43 We recommended that the Management: 
 

a) avoid recurrence of similar lapses which are contrary to  the aforesaid  
provisions  of the Revised IRR of RA No. 9184, relevant Sections of 

FY 2019 GAA, COA rules and regulations, and other government 

issuances on the government procurement process; 
 

b) submit immediately the required documents duly certified to facilitate 
the legal/auditorial and technical review of the subject contracts to 

preclude audit suspensions on related disbursements;  

 

c) evaluate all projects of the contractors/suppliers to determine whether 
they satisfactorily delivered the projects/goods under the contract 



393 

 

within the specified delivery schedule, if not, sanction them with 

liquidated damages for every day of delay of delivery under Section 

68, Annexes C and D of IRR of RA No. 9184; 
 

d) limit the procurement of goods and services on a reimbursement basis, 
unless the circumstances warrant its application; and 

 

e) require responsible officials to explain/justify with verifiable basis 
why disbursements on procurements which were noted as non-

compliant  with existing procurement law and the COA rules and 

regulations,  as mentioned above,  should not be suspended/ disallowed 

in post-audit. 

 

15.44 The Management commented as follows: 
 

RO Management’s Comments 

II, III, IV-B, VII, 

VIII, X & CAR 

Agreed and will comply with the Auditor’s recommendations. 

II, XII Issued explanations/justifications on the noted observations and 

assured that they will submit the required documentations and 

compliance with the audit recommendations. 

VI No management comment issued. 

 
15.45 RO and SDO Auditors issued their rejoinders on management comments issued 

by the ROs I, IV-A, V, XIII and NCR. 
 

Delayed/Non-submission of Financial Reports 
 

16. Non-adherence of concerned Offices/Schools/SDOs of the DepEd ROs to the 
submission of the required accounting and financial reports precluded the Audit 

Team from timely performance of its Constitutionally-mandated auditorial and 

reportorial functions. 
 

16.1 Section 7.1.1(a) of COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009 
provides that “The head of the agency, who is primarily responsible for all 

government funds and property pertaining to his agency, shall ensure that: a) 

the required financial and other reports and statements are submitted by the 

concerned agency officials in such form and within the period prescribed by 

the Commission, xxx.” 
 

16.2 The GAM for NGAs, Volume I, sets the deadlines on the submission of various 
accounting reports and financial statements (FSs). 

 

16.3 Section 4(6) of PD No. 1445 stated that claims against government funds shall 
be supported with complete documentation. This provision is one of the 

fundamental principles governing financial transactions and operations of any 

government agencies. 
 



394 

 

16.4 Section 122 of PD No. 1445 provides that “Xxx require the agency heads, chief 
accountants, x to submit trial balances, x, and such other reports as may be 

necessary for the exercise of its functions. (2) failure on the part of the officials 

concerned to submit the documents and reports mentioned herein shall 

automatically cause the suspension of payment of their salaries until they shall 

have complied with the requirements of the Commission.”

financial statements/reports, as stated below.

16.7 Unreasonable delays/non-submission of reports by the ROs, SDOs and schools 
not only impeded the timely and thorough review and evaluation of the 

accuracy, completeness and propriety of the transactions reported but also 

prevented the early detection and correction of any deficiency/error noted in 

the audit thereof. Likewise, significant delays in the rendition of reports 

directly affects the data that can be generated therefrom which could lose its 

value to the intended users as their basis in decision-making. 



399 

 

 

16.8 Moreover, failure on the part of the concerned officials to submit on time the 
required financial reports and documents shall be an automatic ground to cause 

the suspension of payment of their salaries as penalty, until they have complied 

with the existing regulations, pursuant to Paragraph 2, Section 122 of PD No. 

1445, also known as the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines. 
 

16.9 We recommended that Management direct the persons responsible in the 
preparation and submission of the financial reports to submit the same 

within the period prescribed by the COA, to enable the Audit Teams to 

conduct its timely audit. Otherwise, consider the suspension of payment of 

salaries of the concerned personnel for unjustifiable delay in the 

submission of the required reports, pursuant to Section 122 of PD No. 

1445. 
 

16.10 The Management’s Comments and Auditor’s Rejoinder are presented in Annex J. 
 

Compliance with the Transparency Seal 

 
17. Transparency in governance was not fully assured by the DepEd CO and the 

NCR  including its 16 SDOs in Metro Manila when the posting and updating of 

some of the vital information necessary in enhancing transparency and 

accountability in government on the financial reports, infrastructure projects 

and the required ‘Transparency Seal’ in their respective official websites have 

not been completely undertaken as mandated under Sections 89, 90, 91, 93, and 

94 of the General Provisions of the GAA for FY 2020 or RA No. 11465 and Section 

1 of the EO No. 662 dated September 20, 2007; thus, depriving the public of 

inclusiveness to a real-time and relevant information  necessary to enforce 

accountability among its officials. 

 

Moreover, this also affected the Department’s eligibility for Performance-Based 

Bonus (PBB) in CY 2020 due to non-compliance with the good governance 

conditions required under Memorandum Circular No. 2020-1 dated June 2, 2020 

issued by Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) on the Harmonization of National 

Government Performance Monitoring, Information and Reporting Systems. 
 

17.1 Applicable provisions in the GAA of FY 2020 or RA No. 11465 to enhance 
transparency and accountability in the government are the following: 

 

 Section 89. Report on Commission on Audit Findings and 
Recommendations  

 

Within sixty (60) days from receipt of the COA Annual Audit 

Report, agencies concerned shall submit to the COA, either in printed 

form or by way of electronic document, a status report on the actions 

taken on said audit findings and recommendations using the prescribed 

form under COA Memorandum No. 2014-002 dated March 18, 2014. 



400 

 

They shall likewise furnish the DBM, the speaker of the House of 

Representatives, the President of the Senate of the Philippines, the 

House Committee on Appropriations, and the Senate Committee on 

Finance, either in printed form or by way of electronic document, a copy 

of said reports. 

 

The heads of agencies and the agencies’ web administrator or their 

equivalent shall be responsible for ensuring that said monthly reports 

are likewise posted in their respective websites.” 

 

 Section 90. Financial Reports  
 

On or before the tenth (10th) day of the month immediately 

following the covered period, departments, bureaus, offices and 

instrumentalities of the National Government, including Constitutional 

Offices enjoying fiscal autonomy and SUCs, shall submit the monthly 

report on appropriations, allotments, obligations and disbursements of 

current appropriations, as well as the monthly report of disbursement, 

through the following: a) URS or other electronic means for reports not 

covered by the URS; and b) Agency’s website. 

 

The agency shall send written notice when said reports have been 

submitted or posted on its website to the DBM, House of 

Representatives, Senate of the Philippines, House Committee on 

Appropriations, and the Senate Committee on Finance, and other offices 

where the submission of reports is required under existing laws, rules, 

and regulations. The date of notice to said agencies shall be considered 

the date of compliance with this requirement. 

 

 Section 91.  Financial and Physical Reports 
 

Within thirty (30) days after the end of each quarter, departments, 

bureaus, offices and instrumentalities of the National Government, 

including Constitutional Offices enjoying fiscal autonomy and SUCs, 

shall submit the quarterly reports on its financial and physical 

accomplishments as well as reports and other information mandated in 

the special and general provisions of this Act, through the following: a) 

URS or other electronic means for reports not covered by the URS; and 

b) Agency’s website. 

 

The agency shall send written notice when said reports have been 

submitted or posted on its website to the DBM, House of 

Representatives, Senate of the Philippines, House Committee on 

Appropriations, and the Senate Committee on Finance, and other offices 

where the submission of reports is required under existing laws, rules, 

and regulations. The date of notice to said agencies shall be considered 

the date of compliance with this requirement. 

 

Failure to comply with any of the foregoing shall result in the automatic 

suspension of the salaries of the responsible official or employee until 



401 

 

they have complied with the above requirements pursuant to Section 57, 

Chapter 6, Book VI of E.O. No. 292. 

 

Repeated failure or refusal of said official and employee to submit the 

above reports or to post the reports on the Agency’s official website 

without any justifiable cause may be a ground for administrative 

disciplinary action, subject to pertinent civil service rules and 

regulations. The head of agency shall be responsible for ensuring 

compliance with this penalty provision. 

 

 Section 93. Transparency in Infrastructure Projects 
 

All agencies of the government shall post the following on their 

respective websites, with the period indicated: 

 

a. The project title, location and detailed description; detailed 
estimates in arriving at the Approved Budget for the Contract; the 

winning contractor and the detailed estimates of the bid as awarded, 

within thirty (30) calendar days from entering into contract; 

 

b. Start of construction; target date of completion; completion rate; 
project status; the reason/s in in case of delay; 

 

c. Source of fund; implementing office, responsible official, contact 
number and email address; and, 

 

d. The detailed actual cost of the project; and variation orders issued, 
if any, within thirty (30) calendar days from the issuance of a 

certification of completion.   

 

The heads of the agencies and web administrators or their equivalent 

shall be responsible for ensuring compliance with this Section. 

 

 Section 94. Transparency Seal  
 

To enhance transparency and enforce accountability, all agencies of the 

government shall maintain a transparency seal to be posted on their 

website. The Transparency Seal shall contain the following: 

 

i. The agency’s mandate and functions, names of its offical with 
their position and designation, and contact information; 

ii. Approved budgets and corresponding targets, immediately 
upon approval of this Act; 

iii. Modifications pursuant to the general and special provision in 
this Act; 

iv. Annual procurement plan/s and contract awarded with the 
winning contractor, supplier or consultant; 

v. Major activities or projects categorized in accordance with the 
0+10 agenda and their target beneficiaries; 

vi. Status of implementation, evaluation or assessment reports of 
said programs or projects; 



402 

 

vii. Budget and Financial accountability report; 
viii. Final People’s Freedom to Information (FOI) Manual signed by 

head of agency, Agency Information Inventory, 2018 and 2019 

FOI Summary Report, and 2018 and 2019 FOI Registry; and, 

ix. Annual reports on the status of income authorized by law to be 
retained or used and be deposited outside of the National 

Treasury, which shall include the legal basis for its retention or 

use, the beginning balance, income collected and its sources, 

expenditures, and ending balance for the preceding fiscal year. 

 

The heads of the agencies and their web administrator or their 

equivalents shall be responsible for ensuring for compliance with this 

Section.” 

  

17.2 Likewise, Section 1 of the EO No. 662 dated September 20, 2007 requires the 
government agencies to the posting of the Procurement Reports to enhance 

transparency, which reads as follows: 

 

All National Government Agencies (NGAs), Government Owned 

and/or Controlled Corporations (GOCCs, Government Financial 

Institutions (GFIs), State Universities and Colleges (SUCs), and Local 

Government Units (LGUs, through their bids and awards committees 

are directed to post in the appropriate government website the following 

procurement reports as required under R.A. 9184 and its IRR-A: 

 

a) Annual Procurement Plan; 
b) Procurement Monitoring Report; 
c) List of Non-Government Organizations (NGOs), Civil Society 

Organizations, Professional’s Associations Organization invited as 

observers; and 

d) Blacklisting orders against suppliers, contractors and consultants 
 

17.3 In addition, Section 4 of Memorandum Circular (MC) No. 2020-1 dated June 
2, 2020 issued by IATF on the Harmonization of National Government 

Performance Monitoring, Information and Reporting Systems on Guidelines 

on the Grant of the PBB for FY 2020 under EO No. 80 s. 2012 and EO No. 201 

s. 2016, likewise provides the Good Governance Conditions (GCGs) based on 

performance drivers of the Results-Based Performance Management System 

(RBPMS). Included among the conditions for good governance is the 

maintaining and updating and the Agency’s Transparency Seal. 

 

17.4 To promote transparency and accountability in the government operations, all 
agencies thru their respective heads and web administrators are required to 

publish on their websites the complete details of budgetary allocations and 

utilization, physical accomplishment reports, major programs and 

infrastructure projects, procurement activities including other necessary vital 

information regarding its operation. 

 



403 

 

17.5 The Transparency Seal (Section 94) summarizes all the needed data in the (9) 
nine identified components as prescribed in the current budget act. It is depicted 

by a pearl shining out of an open shell, which is a symbol of a policy shift 

towards openness in access to government information. It hopes to inspire 

Filipinos in the civil service to be more open to citizen engagement; on the 

other hand, it invites the citizenry to exercise their right to participate in 

governance. This initiative is envisioned as a step in the right direction towards 

solidifying the position of the country as a shining example for democratic 

virtue in the region. 

 

17.6 Validation of the official websites of the DepEd CO and 16 of its SDOs in the 
NCR revealed that there were contents prescribed under Section 94 of the 

General Provisions, GAA FY 2020 which were not or partially complied with

17.7 In SDO Pasig, they had no official website with a domain name, and instead 
availed of the WordPress website which is an open-source content management 

system that builds webpages. Being a free hosting service, one can create and 

publish one’s web address, but would not have full control over one’s web 

domain, which can eventually be taken down anytime without prior notice. 

However, in CY 2020, the Management had decided to create their website but 

it lacked the necessary information as prescribed by the rules and regulations 

mentioned above. Validation of the sdopasigcity.ph weblink revealed that 

compliance with the transparency and accountability requirements need further 

improvement in terms of the quality of the Transparency Seal disclosures on 

its website.  

 

17.8 Further scrutiny of their official websites also showed that the following 
requirements as prescribed under Sections 89, 90, and 93 of the same Act were

17.10 Although the agencies have their own official websites, the information posted 
do not contain all the required data and also not regularly updated. It lacks the 

necessary information as prescribed by the rules and regulations mentioned 

above. It needs further improvement in terms of the quality of the Transparency 

Seal disclosures on their website. 

 

17.11 The Managements’ failure to fully utilize its official website to disclose to the 
public all the vital information enumerated above is a glaring setback in 

adopting measures to ensure transparency and accountability which is required 

from the Agency, as one of the budgetary reforms being undertaken to 

encourage good governance among the different branches of government.   

 

17.12 Similarly, the need to employ these available digital platforms is more fitting 
nowadays due to the challenges brought about by the pandemic, where 

restriction of movement is imposed across the country. Making use of the 

advances provided by this website to communicate the important information 

is now the new norm that is unparalleled and paramount under these 

circumstances. 

 

17.13 Furthermore, these deficiencies may affect the Agencies’ eligibility for PBB in 
CY 2020 due to non-compliance with good governance conditions required 

under Memorandum Circular No. 2020-1 dated June 2, 2020 issued by IATF 

on the Harmonization of National Government Performance Monitoring, 

Information, and Reporting Systems.  

 

17.14 The Transparency Seal Provisions aims to leverage the internet to make key 
information on each particular unit of the government, more accessible to the 

public. Hence, failure to comply with the said provisions defeats its purpose 

and enforcing accountability was not fully achieved. 

 

17.15 We recommended that Management: 
 

a) comply strictly with Sections 89, 90, 91, and 94 of the General 
Provisions of the GAA for FY 2020 or RA No. 11465 and Section 4 of 

Memorandum Circular 2020-1 dated June 2, 2020 issued by IATF on 

the Harmonization of National Government Performance Monitoring, 

Information and Reporting Systems;  

 



410 

 

b) fully leverage the Agency’s available information technology 
resources by ensuring that the required pieces of fiscal and operational 

information are disclosed on its official website on a regular basis for 

the public to access the key information, and to clearly demonstrate its 

commitment to transparency and accountability; and 

 

c) make certain that the information/data posted in its official website 
are regularly updated and monitored. 

 

17.16 The Management’s comments are as follows: 
 

Office/SDO Management Comments 

CO The Public Affairs Service (PAS) is responsible for the uploading of 
documents related to the Transparency Seal of the official Department 

website. These documents are being forwarded to PAS by various concerned 

offices. PAS reviewed these uploaded documents and endorsed the report on 

the status of required Transparency Seal information for posting with 

partially compliant or non-compliant tag from COA, as of March 30, 2021. 

Accordingly, CY 2020 physical report of operations/physical plan per quarter 

and Annual Procurement Plan from FY 2020 and 2020 Indicative Plan were 

posted on the DepEd website. However, PAS did not receive any submission 

of the following reports for posting on the DepEd website: a) 4th quarter 

SAAODB (FAR No.1); b) DepEd’s Infrastructure Projects, c) Data for 

contracts awarded with the winning supplier, contractor or consultant; and d) 

Annual reports on the status of income authorized by law to be retained and/or 

used and be deposited outside of the National Treasury. 

Malabon Management commented that upon receipt of the AOM dated March 

23, 2021, the SDO conducted a special online meeting with all 

concerned personnel and discussed the needed data as prescribed in 

the current budget act.   

 

A mechanism was also employed to promptly gather and complete all 

the information to be posted on the Division’s official website. 

 

In addition, to ensure transparency and accountability in government 

operations through the use of the division’s website, a division 

memorandum was issued on March 29, 2021 entitled “Maintenance 

and Update of the Transparency Seal (TS) posted on the Division 

Official Website” which enjoins all responsible units to comply with 

the requirements.   

 

Also, the Management commented that all recommendations will be 

taken seriously and will ensure strict compliance. 

Pasig All the Audit Teams findings are fully noted, and rest assured that the 

new SDO Web Team will ensure the compliance with Sections 91, 93 

and 94 of the General Provisions of the GAA for FY of 2020, or RA 

No. 11645, Section 4.0 of Memorandum Circular 2020-1 dated June 

2, 2020, issued by IATF on the Harmonization of National 

Government Performance Monitoring, Information and Reporting

Taguig/Pateros The SDO has been experiencing a lot of downtime with our website 

www.depedtaguigpateros.com since 2019 until the opening of the 

School Year 2020-2021which made the ITO Officer to create a new 

website https:sites.google.com/deped.gov.ph/sdTaguig/Pateros 

dashboard to be able to update the stakeholders of the happening in 

the SDO Taguig and Pateros. The Management directed through a 

memorandum, the concerned units to submit reports for updating and 

posting in the new website while deliberating if the SDO should 

continue with its subscription from the current website provider or 

seek services from other providers. 

 

Rest assured that the concerned units will work closely to ensure the 

implementation of COA recommendations. 

Valenzuela Management commented that memoranda were issued to accountable 

officers regarding the submission of financial reports, LRs, 

procurement reports and other required reports.   

 

Management also stated in its letter dated March 29, 2021 that they 

already subscribed/commissioned a new government website and 

activated the transparency board in compliance to the existing policy 

provided by the state.   

 

They also commented that they are currently studying different 

approaches on how to improve their process and lessen the delays in 

acquiring the reports from other units. 

Pasay The required reports, data, and information are being posted on the 

SDO Pasay Website.

Section 4 of Memorandum Circular 2020-1 dated June 2, 2020. 

Further, he emphasized that the Unit is closely working and 

coordinating with the concerned offices of the SDO as to the 

documents and data needed. His Office has also started to upload 

some of the gathered documents to Google drive and link it to the 

specific subject. 

 

PROGRAM EVALUATION 

 

Basic Educational Facilities Fund (BEFF) – Repairs and Rehabilitation of School 

Buildings and New Construction of Classrooms (DPWH – Implemented Project) 

 

18. The BEFF Program - Repair and Rehabilitation of School Buildings of eight ROs- 
NCR, CAR, I, II, III, VIII, X, and XI, and new construction of classrooms in two 

ROs - NCR and II for CYs 2019 and 2020 were not carried out as 

planned/envisioned towards the provision of safe and structurally stable facilities 

that are conducive to learning and teaching given the several implementation 

setbacks noted by the Audit Teams such as: a) delayed completion of projects in 

six ROs totaling P578,018,334.10, of which P202,406,600.05 pertains to DPWH 

implemented projects in NCR; b)  discrepancies in the actual work performed as 

against the approved Program of Works (POW) and in the percentage of 



412 

 

completion as reported by the DPWH; c) poor implementation of some aspects of 

the repairs/rehabilitation in five ROs; and d) projects not deferred during the 

period of discontinuance as economy measure. 

 

18.1 The BEFF is an annual budget of DepEd intended for the improvement of 
maintenance of school facilities such as provision of classroom and workshop 

buildings, replacement of old dilapidated buildings, provision of furniture and 

fixture, repair and rehabilitation of classrooms, including heritage buildings, as 

well as water and sanitation facilities, and electrification. 

 

18.2 Under DepEd Order No. 035, s. 2017, the implementation of New Construction 
of Classrooms Program under the BEFF shall be undertaken by Department of 

Public Works and Highways (DPWH), while the implementation of 

Repair/Rehabilitation of Classrooms, Water and Sanitation Facilities, and 

Gabaldon Heritage Buildings will be undertaken by DepEd.  

 

18.3 8.1 of Annex E of the Revised IRR of RA No. 9184 provides that “Where the 
contractor refuses or fails to satisfactorily complete the work within the 

specified contract time, plus any time extension duly granted and is hereby in 

default under the contract, the contractor shall pay the procuring entity for 

liquidated damages, and not by way of penalty, any amount, as provided in the 

conditions of the contract, equal to at least one tenth (1/10) of one (1) percent 

of the cost of the unperformed portion of the works for every day of delay.” 

 

18.4 Annex I of the same Revised IRR provides for that the Procuring Entity shall 
terminate a contract for default when any of the following conditions attend its 

implementation when the Contractor, among others: 

 

a) Abandons the contract works, refuses or fails to comply with a valid 
instruction of the Procuring Entity or fails to proceed expeditiously and 

without delay despite a written notice by the Procuring Entity; or 

 

b) Does not execute the Works in accordance with the contract or 
persistently or flagrantly neglects to carry out its obligations under the 

contract. 

 

18.5 The Audit Teams assigned at nine ROs: DepEd NCR, CAR, Regions I, II, III, 
VI, VIII, X, XI, XII and XIII, conducted auditorial review of the contracts, 

verification of the related documents and inspection of the implementation of 

various BEFF project in CYs 2019 and 2020 and noted the following 

deficiencies: 

 

a. Delayed completion of projects of BEFF 
 

18.6 Enclosure No. 2 the DepEd Order No. 35, series of 2017 dated July 17, 2017 
provides the guidelines on the implementation of the repair/rehabilitation of 



413 

 

classrooms, water and sanitation facilities, and Gabaldon Heritage school 

buildings, stated among others are as follows: 
 

Section 3.a states that, “The Division Offices or any 

Implementing Unit as authorized by the Secretary shall 

conduct procurement of BEFF Repair and/or Restoration of 

Gabaldon and other Heritage Buildings upon receipt of 

Authority to Procure with attached list of recipient schools 

from Central Office.” 

 

Section 4.a -  under Monitoring and Inspection aspect, stated 

that: “The Regional/Division Engineer (RE/DE) shall 

function as Project Engineer and shall be mainly in-charge of 

regular monitoring and inspection of the repair projects and 

shall have the following tasks: 

 

a. Conduct regular site inspections to ensure that the 
approved program of works (POWs) are being 

executed by the selected contractor/s accordingly; 

 

b. Review and validate work accomplishments of the 
constructors and their claims for payments of 

completed works; 

 

c. Assist in the resolution of issues and concerns 
during project implementation.” 

 

18.7 General Conditions of the Contract states that: “LIQUIDATED DAMAGES. 
The Contractor shall pay liquidated damages to the Procuring Entity for each 

day that the Completion Date is later than the intended completion date. The 

applicable liquidated damages are at least one-tenth (1/10) of a percent of the 

cost of the unperformed portion of every day of delay. xx”

CAR Kalinga As of December 31, 2020, SDO’s 13 projects 

were not completed within the contract 

duration. Due to the unexpected COVID-19 

pandemic, the original target dates of 

completion were not met by the contractors.  

However, despite the additional 85 days 

granted by the SDO, construction and repair 

works were still not completed as of yearend. 

Thus, liquidated damages should have been 

computed. 

 

Further, Repair of Classroom in Buscalan and 

ButBut under Jessie Construction amounting 

to ₱1,382,848.36 which was supposed to be 

completed last July 27, 2020 were not yet 

started as of yearend. The contract should 

have been rescinded and appropriate penalties 

such as blacklisting should have been 

imposed on the erring Contractors following 

RA No. 9184. 

71,123,871.72 

Mountain 

Province 

Thirteen infrastructure projects of the SDO 

were not completed within the contract 

duration. 

 

Validation showed that the projects were not 

completed due to insufficient supervision and 

deficiency in planning during the 

implementation of the project.  As a result, the 

immediate use of the projects was delayed, 

and the aim of the school to be more 

responsive to the school needs was not 

delivered and enjoyed on time by the 

students.    

 

It was also noted that the cause of the delay in 

the completion of projects for four projects 

with total contract cost of ₱23,295,924.02 

were suspended due to the COVID-19 and the 

target dates for the completion of the projects 

were January and February 2020. Therefore, 

the cause of the delay had no merit since the 

suspension of work due to the COVID-19 

started on March 16, 2020.

It was also noted that the suspension orders

considered default under the contract. 

 

Further, notices of contract time extensions 

necessary for the technical evaluation were 

not supported by a copy of evaluation report 

establishing the need for time extension 

including the computation showing in 

sufficient detail how the number of days of 

extension was determined, contrary to Annex 

“E” COA Circular No. 2009-001. 

 

Moreover, analysis of the final payments 

showed that the projects had incurred delays 

ranging from 114 to 348 days, but liquidated 

damages were not collected for every day of 

delay, thus disadvantageous on the part of the 

government.  

Ilocos Sur Contracts for the Rehabilitation, Renovation 

and Repair of various Primary, Elementary

211 days from February 14, 2020 or the date 

of determination of the BAC of the bidder 

with the Lowest Calculated Responsive

there were 26 infrastructure projects totaling 

P98,667,067.77 as of yearend, which are 

already delayed in the implementation in so 

far as the target date of completion is 

concerned. Nine of these projects costing 

₱11,062,488.93 were not yet implemented as 

of target date of completion thereby incurring 

delays ranging from 34 days to 244 days. Two 

projects totaling ₱2,528,365.04 were already 

paid 15% advance payment but no 

accomplishment has been reported as of 

target date of completion, thus, was delayed 

for 87 days as of yearend. The rest of the 

reported projects were partially implemented 

as of target date of completion, thus, as of 

yearend, these projects were already delayed 

from 87 days to one year and 33 days.

not yet completed as of December 31, 2020 that are already beyond the contract 

period. 

 

18.10 Considering that the NTP was issued to the winning bidders as early as January 
2018, these contractors under the reasonable circumstances had already used 

up the required contract duration period. It denotes among others, that the 

projects should have been completed before December 2019 prior the COVID-

19 pandemic wherein the government orders the stoppage of all the 

construction works, which is treated as a “force majeure” event. 
 

18.11 Delay in the completion of projects deprived the intended beneficiaries of the 
early use/operation of these facilities had these been completed within the

specified contract time as agreed upon in the individual contracts entered into 

by and between the DepEd and the contractors. 
 

b. Discrepancies in the actual work performed as against the approved 
Program of Works (POW)and in the percentage of completion as reported 

by the DPWH and poor implementation of some aspects of the 

repairs/rehabilitation 

 

18.12 The Audit Teams of NCR, CAR, ROs II, III and X inspected several projects 
implemented under BEFF repair and rehabilitation of school buildings and 

newly constructed classrooms of the DepEd and observed deficiencies in the 

perfected contracts and approved POWs,  as shown below: 

 
RO SDO Audit Observations 

NCR Pasig The Audit Team inspected the completed project at Eusebio High School 

on February 2, 2021 under the CY 2019 BEFF program for a total 

contract cost of ₱22,021,860.07. Scrutiny of the approved POWs 

showed that the tiling works aspect as indicated therein had a quantity 

which is different from the actual count made by the Audit Team. The 

POWs for the installation of “60 x 60” unglazed tiles showed 32,185 

units for the seven (7) various buildings comprising of 95 classrooms, 

which exceeded the actual units counted by the Audit Team in the total 

quantity of 14,215 or a difference of 17,790 units. 

 

This condition indicates that the actual work done relative to the tiling 

work aspect is below the specified requirements in the POWS, which 

may cause the government pecuniary losses in the form of overpricing 

since the POWs became the basis of the project’s Approved Budget Cost 

(ABC). Overestimation and/or erroneous computation of tiles 

requirements/works in the POWs by the SDO resulted in paying more 

than what was delivered by the contractor. 

  

A canvass of price obtained by the Audit Team on the internet revealed 

that the current price of “60 x 60” unglazed tiles range from ₱155.00 to 

₱250.00. It appears that the excess difference noted in the tiling works 

will lead to more savings of approximately ₱2,785,350.00 (₱155.00 x 

17,970 units) in the budget, excluding the labor cost for the installation 

and the cement grout. 

San Juan There were no fire exits and electrical panel board installed in the four-

storey building constructed by the DPWH. The Audit Team requested 

the contractor’s representative for the blueprint of the project, it was 

discovered that indeed there is no fire exit in the blueprint plan. These 

should be corrected or rectified by the concerned contractor, in order to 

allow for the quick and safe exit in case of an emergency. 

Navotas Inspection was conducted by the Audit Team on February 24, 2021 to 

validate the status of the repairs undertaken in Dagat-dagatan 

Elementary School and Tanza NHS. The schools have improved and 

looked presentable during the inspection. However, assessment of the 

actual worked performed as against the specifications provided in the 

approved POWs disclosed the following deficiencies:

Malabon Inspection was conducted by the Audit Team on February 12, 2021 to 

validate the status of the repairs being undertaken at SHS within Imelda 

ES and Tinajeros ES with a total contract cost of ₱3,860,122.64. The 

two contracts’ completion date should have been January 12, 2021 based 

on the awarded contracts; however, the project in Imelda ES has already 

incurred delay on its completion as work are still being carried out during 

the inspection. The result of inspection and assessment on the actual 

work performed versus the specification provided in the approved POW

Navotas Scrutiny of the approved POWs showed that scaffolding was included 

under the Painting Works aspect in the total amount of ₱259,824.10, 

details as follows:

(In Php)

Wire Nails (CWN) 

169,428.14 

Tanza NHS 90,395.96 

Total 259,824.10 

 

Interview with Property Custodians revealed that a steel-type 

scaffolding was used to facilitate the painting of buildings instead of a 

coco-lumber as stated in the POWs. When asked about the whereabouts 

of the subject scaffolding, they claimed that the same was taken by the 

contractor after completing the project. 

 

Valenzuela Review of the POWs and Detailed Estimates of the contracts showed 

that the scaffolding in the total amount of ₱3,117,362.67 for the 11 

schools were part of the direct cost allocated for the repairs/rehabilitation 

of the 3-storey buildings. 

 

The reasonableness of the amount allocated for the scaffoldings in the 

total amount of ₱3,117,362.67 could not be fully ascertained by the 

Audit Team in the absence of the Detailed Price Unit Analysis (DUPA) 

that must support the POW and Bill of Quantities (BOQ) prepared and 

submitted by the Management, and the contract cost offered by the 

winning contractors.  Allocating a price range from ₱61,819 to as high 

as ₱255,250.80 for scaffolding using coco lumber, plywood, and 

ordinary common wire nails raises doubt in their cost estimation that 

could possibly result in excessive project cost attributable from an 

overestimated quantities of work items and materials, prices of 

materials, labors and/or equipment rental rates including the contract 

duration. 

 

It was found that the scaffoldings utilized by the winning contractor 

during the construction period are not turn-over to the schools after the 

completion of the repair/rehabilitation project; hence, the allocation of 

an unreasonable price for scaffoldings will result in a higher project cost, 

which will fall among the irregular/unnecessary/excessive transactions 

being disallowed by the Commission.

II Batanes DPWH reported the seven projects with total contract cost of 

₱57,491,986.57 to be 70.92% to 93.75% complete as of September 30, 

2019. While ocular inspection as of September 2020 revealed that the 

same projects are estimated to be 1% to 93% complete only, hence, the 

discrepancy. 

  

There are no records (e.g. Program of Works, Plans, Statement of Work 

Accomplished, etc.) available in the custody of DepEd relative to the 

said projects. Thus, to reasonably estimate the actual project 

accomplishment, we requested the DepEd Project Engineer, through a 

letter dated October 14, 2020, to provide his best estimate on the actual 

accomplishment based on his personal knowledge acquired during the 

on-site inspection and the images taken during the physical count in the 

project sites.   

 

It should be emphasized that the bloated percentage of accomplishment 

as reported by the DPWH-Batanes DEO could have been avoided should 

the counterparts in the DepEd-Batanes strictly enforced their oversight 

functions through close coordination and monitoring. 

III Pampanga There were some defects on the repaired classrooms which were 

likewise observed by the School Principals concerned. Despite this, the 

School Principals still signed the Certificate of Completion and CFA 

without questioning the contractor or the DepEd Engineer about the 

noted deficiencies/defects.   

 

More so, the School Principals did not even bother to request or get a 

copy of the contracts and the program of work even if they know fully 

well that they are the recipients of the projects.   

 

For this reason, the quality of work for the construction, repair and 

rehabilitation of classrooms funded under BEFF were not fully 

monitored and correction of deficiencies noted was not imposed to the 

contractor. The repair and rehabilitation projects were accepted in their 

completed condition without the rectification of the noted defects.

Salvador 

City 

The lack of adequate supervision and monitoring of the conservation and 

restoration of the Gabaldon School Building awarded to Jimwen 

Construction and General Merchandise with a contract cost of 

₱1,528,527.60 resulted in various deficiencies and the 

alteration/revision of the historical and architectural design of the 

building contrary to the pertinent provisions of RA No. 11194 and 

DepEd Handbook on Supply and Property Management. 



426 

 

RO SDO Audit Observations 

During the validation and ocular inspection by the audit team together 

with the project engineer of the Division, the following deficiencies were 

noted: 

 

i. The ceiling (interior and exterior) was plain plywood and not the 
wooden T&G as per approved POW and Gabaldon design as 

prescribed by the Republic Act; 

ii. The windows are capiz swing window instead of capiz awning 
window that is based on the original specification of the 

Gabaldon building; 

iii. The partition of the rooms was not made of T&G wooden panel 
per approved POW and Gabaldon building design; 

iv. There was no removal and reconstruction of T&G wooden wall 
panel, exterior wooden ceiling, and interior wooden ceiling; 

v. Only one (1) septic vault was constructed instead of two (2) 
concrete hollow block septic vaults; and 

vi. The historical design of the Gabaldon School building was 
modified and changed. 

 

Despite the aforementioned deficiencies, a Certificate of Completion 

was issued and signed by the Project Engineer, Chief 

ESSD/Governance, PFSED (CO) Representative, School Head, and 

Head of the Procuring Entity. 

 

c. Lack of consultation/coordination in the project implementation between 
the DepEd and DPWH  

 

18.13 The Department of Education created the Physical Facilities Services and 
Engineering Division (PFSED) through the issuance of DepEd Order No.17, 

series of 2004 dated March 12, 2004. Under the same order, the Physical 

Facilities Coordinator (PFC) in each school division office was also created/ 

designated to oversee its physical facilities nationwide. The functions of 

PFSED included, among others, the formulation of policies, preparation of 

designs, plans and cost estimates, supervision, monitoring, evaluation and up 

to the inspection of infrastructure projects. The PFSED, through the Division 

Project Engineers (DPEs) is responsible for the preparation of the POWs and 

detailed estimates of the proposed school facilities, as well as its monitoring, 

supervision and inspection. 
 

18.14 On the other hand, the PFCs have to perform the tasks mandated of them such 
as supervision and monitoring of the School Building Repair and Maintenance 

(SBRM). In relation to this, they are tasked to assist the school heads of their 

respective divisions in physical facilities concerns such as the preparation of 

the school site plan, preparation of individual school building records and 

inventory of school building and school sites. They are also mandated to 

oversee and monitor the implementation of the regular SBP, the BEFF and all 

other school building projects undertaken by DepEd or undertaken by the 

DPWH.

RO SDO Audit Observations 

NCR San Juan For CY 2019, SDO San Juan implemented the repair and rehabilitation of the 

18 classrooms of Estrada and Rodriguez building in Kabayanan Elementary 

School amounting to ₱4,385,520.55 that commenced on September 12, 2019 

and completed on June 11, 2020.  

 

During the ocular inspection by the Audit Team on February 18, 2021 of the 

repair and rehabilitation of the two buildings, an on-going construction was 

being made on the Rodriguez building. Various workers are on-site 

performing destruction of the building columns and beams. Just six months 

after its completion, the newly repaired classroom was being destroyed to 

make way for the retrofitting/strengthening of the beams and columns. 

Interview with the Principal said that the building was constructed sometime 

in 1973 and retrofitting should be conducted to make them earthquake safe.  

 

Interview with the DepEd Engineer and the School Principal revealed that 

they are not aware that a retrofitting program will be conducted by the DPWH.  

 

Considering that the school building program is also implemented by other 

government agencies and private organizations, the Division Office being a 

recipient should have been consulted with the construction project. A 

consultation process between DepEd with DPWH is very important to ensure 

that the project to be undertaken is based on the actual needs, and to avoid 

duplication of works that will result into wastage of meager government 

resources. 

 

In view of this, the retrofitting activity carried out by the DPWH surely 

affected the newly repaired classrooms carried out by the Department putting 

into waste the repair cost presently incurred by the latter. It manifested the 

lack of coordination and consultation of the construction projects being 

undertaken by both agencies. The retrofitting works should have been 

considered under the BEFF repair and rehabilitation program of the Division 

since they know from the beginning that the school needed that type of works 

and prevent the possibility of the duplication of projects. 

Las Piñas Two projects in the SDO namely, Construction of the Four-Storey Eight 

Classroom in Las Piñas NHS – Main and Construction of Four-Storey Twelve 

Classroom in Pulanlupa Elementary School, included in the GPPA amounting 

₱63,911,105.12 were implemented by the DPWH. The date on when the 

project started, and completion date were not indicated in the report. These 

dates are significant in the evaluation of the actual status of the projects.  

Interview with the Division Engineer revealed that they were not provided by 

the DPWH copy of the contract except for the POWs which serves as the only 

basis in the validation of the projects. 

 

d. Repairs/Construction works were not deferred during the period of 
discontinuance of PAPs 

 

18.15 Section 4.3.12 of the NBC No. 580 dated April 22, 2020 with subject 
“Adoption of economy measure in the government due to the emergency health 

situation,” provides for the discontinuance of start-up construction of 

government buildings, as well as repairs/renovation works which may be 

deferred. 

 



428 

 

18.16 Audit of the agency’s transactions during the period the said Circular took 
effect revealed the following observations: 

 

RO SDO Audit Observations 

VIII Borongan 

City 

Post-audit of transactions revealed that repair of various school buildings 

was not deferred and were paid a total of ₱3,373,133.78 progress billings 

during the period in which discontinuance of programs, projects and 

activities were adopted as economy measures, in contravention to DBM 

Budget Circular No. 580, thus it defeats the purpose of the government’s 

economy measures to produce adequate and readily available funds in 

response to the national health emergency. 

 

Verification why the repair/rehabilitation pushed through while there is a 

discontinuance with this kind of project revealed that management had 

allowed the transaction as a result of agreement agreed upon during a 

management meeting concerning NBC 580. Management claimed that the 

result of the said meeting concluded that the Division office is not covered 

by the DBM NBC 580. 

Construction of schools may not be a top priority during this state of 

emergency, most notably that the DepEd is currently not conducting classes 

in schools and it defeats the purpose of the government effort to produce 

adequate and readily available cash during this state of emergency. 

Southern 

Samar 

Repair/construction works totaling ₱112,735.27 were pushed through, while 

there is a discontinuance with this kind of project. Management had allowed 

the transaction as a result of agreement. Management claimed that these 

repairs/constructions should likewise be given importance since other 

paramount P/A/Ps were already accomplished.  

 

Information and publicity on PPAs 

 

18.17 COA Circular No. 2013-004 dated January 30, 2013 provides that all 
government agencies, or the implementing unit, office or division as the case 

may be, shall notify the public of their PAPs through the posting of relevant 

information on signboards, blackboards, whiteboards, posters, tarpaulins, 

streamers, electronic boards or similar materials in conspicuous places within 

the agency premises, and in the venue where the PAP is located or carried out. 

  

18.18 In the course of Audit, the Audit Team had likewise observed the following 
deficiencies on the implementation of the BEFF Programs as follows: 

 
RO SDO Audit Observations 

NCR Pasig The amount on the tarpaulin posted in the school premises and the amount 

shown in the contract for the repair and rehabilitation of Classrooms Batch 

2 - Lot 2 in San Lorenzo Ruiz Elementary School differs. Per contract the 

amount was at ₱10,838,598.81, while the amount posted in the tarpaulin 

signboard hanged in the school is only ₱6,484,547.15. 

II Batanes Material information such as name/description of the project, name of 

contractor/supplier, fund sources, contract cost and project milestones 

cannot be determined immediately at the sites due to the absence of tarpaulin 

showing the aforementioned details as required in COA Circular 2013-004 

dated January 30, 2013. 



429 

 

RO SDO Audit Observations 

III Pampanga The SDO did not put any signboards for the projects under implementation. 

Consequently, the public and other stakeholders were deprived of pertinent 

information about the Agency’s projects and non-compliance with COA 

Circular No. 2013-004, thus the deficiency did not promote transparency of 

project implementation. 

 

18.19 We recommended the Management to: 
 

a) ensure strict compliance with the provisions of Annex “E” and “I” of 
the Revised IRR of RA No. 9184 and Item 3.1.1 of COA Circular No. 

2009-001 in the implementation and monitoring of infrastructure 

projects; 

 

b) require the contractor to ensure 100% project accomplishment within 
the duration of the projects or the specified contract time to prevent 

the imposition of liquidated damages and other sanctions provided by 

existing regulations; 

 

c) instruct the Division Engineers (DE) to monitor regularly and evaluate 

the accomplishments of all projects it undertakes by exercising 

diligence in the contract administration ensuring, among others, that 

rectification works would be immediately undertaken and that the 

contractors strictly comply with the approved POWs; 

 

d) on the excessive quantity of unglazed tiles estimated and paid at 
Eusebio High School in DO Pasig City, submit the justification and 

remedy on the pecuniary loss obtained thereof. Carefully review, 

evaluated and inspect all documents as well as the actual works carried 

out by the contractor to ensure the project designs and estimates are 

properly done and paid according to the delivered outputs; 

 

e) on the modification/alterations in the design of Gabaldon school 
building including the repairs on other schools, require the concerned 

contractors to repair and rectify the defects based on the plans and 

specifications of the project and demand a refund for the items not 

installed and/or repaired but included in the payment;  

 

f) give justification or explanation on why they proceeded with the 
repair/rehabilitation of school buildings during the period in which 

such project is for discontinuance as provided in NBC No. 580; 

 

g) observe strict compliance with COA Circular No. 2013-004 on 
information and publicity on PAPs; 

 

 

 



430 

 

On the DPWH project -  

 

h) conduct an immediate investigation on the incident in SDO San Juan 
and file appropriate charges to those officers involved or found 

negligent in the performance of their duties, if warranted. Make 

proper coordination and consultation with the officials who are 

involved in the project planning/identification to avoid overlapping of 

projects in the ensuing years; 

 

i) regular monitoring and evaluation of the status of all DepEd School 
buildings including LGU owned building construction projects should 

be conducted by the DE to ensure that duplication of works will be 

avoided; 

 

j) require the DPWH to conduct remedial measures on the defects noted 
during the inspection and require the DepEd CAR not to accept the 

school buildings if these are not corrected/rectified. Also, secure an 

assurance that the defects will not affect the structural stability of the 

school buildings and obtain a report on the structural stability test 

thereof; and 

 

k) coordinate with the DPWH Engineer and request a copy of complete 
contract documents. Henceforth, the SDO Engineer should see to it 

that he/she is always provided with the contract documents 

implemented by the DPWH being the primary end-user. 

 

18.20 The Management’s comments as well as the Audit Team’s Rejoinder are as 
follows: 

 

Region SDO Management Comments Auditor’s Rejoinder 

NCR San Juan This Division issued 

Memorandum dated April 22, 

2019 re: DPWH’s Engineering 

Design for the Repair and 

Retrofitting of Government 

Building in preparation for the 

“BIG ONE” of recipient schools. 

After the conduct of assessment, 

DPWH did not give us feedback 

nor coordinate with us on the 

result of such findings. Likewise, 

this Division decided to request 

budget allocation from DepEd 

Central Office to cover the 

urgent repair/rehabilitation of 

classrooms rather than waiting 

for DPWH to implement their 

own project.  

 

Management comments will be 

subject to validation and 

verification by the Audit Team. 



431 

 

Region SDO Management Comments Auditor’s Rejoinder 

On the latter part of February 

2021, DPWH informed us that 

retrofitting works shall 

commence as soon as possible 

but we cannot refuse the project 

since it has already been awarded 

and ready for implementation. 

 

Furthermore, rest assured that 

defects/deficiencies from the 

recent repair works will be 

restored on its natural from upon 

the completion of the retrofitting 

project. 

Pasig The excessive quantity of tiles 

and paid was brought about by 

inadvertent human error in the 

preparation of the said POW. 

Further, the concurrence of the 

Central Office to the said 

program upon its submission 

thereof gave the Division 

Engineer the impression that it 

had been reviewed again and that 

it bore no mistake in it, thus, 

giving some of leeway for 

scrutiny. Please be assured that 

more careful review and 

evaluation of program of works 

and stricter implementation of 

the projects in the future shall be 

observed. Also, the contractor 

has agreed to implement other 

scope of works at Eusebio High 

School amounting not less than 

the audited value of excessive 

unglazed tiles. 

Management is advised to 

strictly follow the existing rules 

and regulation on the matter to 

ensure  that transparency, 

accountability, equity, 

efficiency and economy of the 

procurement of infrastructure 

project is guaranteed at all 

times. 

Navotas On Carpentry Works 

 

All celling boards are fully 

replaced. It is attested by the 

Principal and the School

good condition plywood that 

were taken from the ceiling were 

stored and intended to be used in 

making cabinets; 

 

Uncovered maintenance access 

on the 3rd floor was already 

corrected. This was already 

covered but need not be fixed as 

it is the access to the ceiling 

whenever problem on wirings 

occur; and

restrictions on movement and 

reporting to the office will be 

relaxed. 



432 

 

Region SDO Management Comments Auditor’s Rejoinder 

 

No. of plywood indicated in 

POW’s exceeds the actual no. 

used, as only the 3rd floor with 3 

rooms and the corridor required 

plywood for ceiling – The POWs 

was checked by the cost 

assessment-in-charge of the 

EFD, DepEd Central Office; and 

number of plywood for the repair 

of all ceilings at 3rd floor for 

both schools were approved and 

checked. As of last inspection, 

there were no unused plywood 

stored in the school. All procured 

plywood were installed.  

 

On Electrical Works 

 

Electric fans were removed by 

the school to avoid damage and 

lost during repair works inside 

the classroom. As to the finding 

that other switches are not 

working, it was validated last 

March 12, 2021 that the electric 

fan that was used to test it, was 

not really functioning. 

 

On Scaffolding 

 

Scaffolding was needed for the 

Painting works especially on the 

painting jobs at the exterior wall 

to support the workers in 

painting the three (3) Storey-

Building. However, for stability 

and durability and to optimally 

secure the safety of the workers, 

the contractors opted to use steel-

scaffolding which is costlier than 

the coco lumber. 

 

On Tile Works 

 

The floor tiles installed in the 

classrooms were all unglazed. 

The said tiles only appeared to be 

shiny and were misconstrued to 

be glazed. The installed floor 

tiles are common-type tiles used 

for general purposes and safe for 

the students.

Management also commented 

that during the Pre-Procurement 

Conference held on September 

30, 2020, Mr. Irwin Jopio (Tanza 

NHS) received a copy of the 

POWs where the detail of the 

project was fully explained. 

CAR Benguet and 

Baguio City 

The Regional Engineer 

commented during the exit 

conference that DepEd CAR 

Engineers were very active in 

monitoring the construction of 

school buildings. However, the 

contractors were more inclined 

to believe with Project Engineers 

of the DPWH even if DepEd 

Engineers had issues with the 

construction of the school 

buildings.  Further, the Regional 

Engineer informed that a 

retrofitting was done on the 

school building funded under the 

2016 BEFF located in Baguio 

City National Science HS, Irisan, 

Baguio City because of the 

findings of the DepEd CAR 

Engineers that the columns were 

not aligned. 

 

As regards the report on the 

structural stability of the said 

building, the Regional Engineer 

also informed that the report was 

already submitted to the

I Ilocos Norte The Schools Division 

Superintendent explained that 

the delays were caused by 

unfavorable weather conditions 

that were not considered during 

the determination of the original 

contract time; request of some 

school heads for the stoppage of 

work due to school activities like 

the hosting of Ilocos Norte 

Athletic Association (INAA) 

Meet, Central Unit Meet, 

Camping/ Jamboree, Division 

Festival of Talents as well as 

Region 1 Athletic Association 

(R1AA) Trainings; and  lack of 

temporary learning facilities/ 

classrooms to be used by affected 

classes during the 

implementation of the project. 

 

Management also clarified that 

the 77 days is not a contract time 

extension but the number of days 

lapsed from the issuance of Time 

Suspension Order and Resume 

Order due to the COVID-19 

Pandemic.  They deemed 

appropriate that such orders can 

be issued without supporting 

documents taking into 

consideration the issuance of 

national emergency. 

During the Exit Conference, the 

Audit Team informed the 

Management to explain in 

writing their basis in granting 

suspension orders after the 

contract period so that COA 

office can evaluate properly.   

 

Also, a copy of evaluation 

report establishing the need for 

time extension including the 

computation showing in 

sufficient detail how the 

number of days of extension 

was determined, is necessary 

for the technical evaluation 

thereof.

Central Office, they prepare the 

necessary documents for posting

already instructed the Physical 

Facilities Unit to monitor the

with the grant of contract 

extensions, with exceptions 

during the lock-down 

implemented by the government. 

This audit recommendation has 

been thoroughly discussed 

during the Pre-Bid and Pre-

regarding on the 10% 

discontinuance of FY 2020 

released allotment for MOOE 

and CO. This circular could not 

affect to the withhold 10% of its 

allotment regardless it has fiscal 

autonomy, this is because the 

required percentage can be 

covered by the Central Office. 

Central Office has different 

P/A/Ps and “for Later Release”, 

therefore, it can cover all the 

required percentage sets by the 

circular. Thus, Department of 

Education as a whole is 

compliant to NBC 580. 

 

Here comes now our 

transactions. It started when the 

Division received Sub-ARO 

dated April 2, 2020, this was the 

legal base to undergo 

procurement process sets by the 

RA No. 9184 for repair of 

various elementary schools. It is 

clear that the dates of the 

contract, NTP up to its 

disbursements are beyond the 

approval date of the circular. But 

the Division believe that these 

transactions are not in violation 

of NBC 580, this is because of 

the Sub-ARO date which is 

before the approval of the 

circular. Also, there was no 

mandate from the Central Office 

to stop the implementation of the 

P/A/P and return the allotment. 

Hence, we request that this AOM 

be drop off and that we are in 

compliant with NBC 580. 

as being covered by the Central 

Office in its compliance with 

the 10% discontinuance of 

costs, it is our stand that the 

noted deficiency would 

constitute a violation to the 

particular provisions of NBC 

580. They should have 

submitted the proof of details of 

the 10% discontinuance 

covering the operating units. 

 

As for the violation pertaining 

to non-discontinuance of 

repair/rehab mentioned in the 

audit finding, it must be noted 

that the received Sub-ARO 

dated April 2, 2020 which was 

legal basis to undergo the said 

procurement is still covered by 

NBC 580 that was in full force

amounting to ₱1,528,527.60 was 

not enough if the one-storey two 

classrooms of Gabaldon design 

will be followed, but 

Management assured the team 

they will make representation 

with Jimwen Construction and 

General Merchandise to rectify 

defects. Likewise, Management 

gave good reason that the cost of 

one septic vault which was not 

installed / constructed will be 

used to cement the entrance of 

the building and repair of the

Engineer promised that she will 

inform the audit team of the

The audit team reaffirmed its 

position to strictly implement 

the specifications prescribed by

it is imperative for the Division

Poor workmanship on some aspects of upgrading of the electrical system 

project 
 

19.5 In DO San Juan City, the upgrading of electrical system under the CY 2019 
BEFF of San Juan NHS revealed that there were still unfinished works or 

minimal defects that need further rectification during the ocular inspection 

conducted by the Audit Team. The noted deficiencies are as follows: 

 

a) The portion of the ceiling where the newly installed 
fluorescent bulb with housing is located were not completely 

covered; 

b) Electrical wirings were exposed and/or not properly fixed in 
proper places;  

c) Fluorescent bulbs were not screwed or fixed properly; and 
d) Loose fluorescent bases. 

 

19.6 The defects/unfinished works should be rectified by the contractor in 
accordance with Paragraph No. 5 of the Contract Agreement. 

 

19.7 The primary consideration of the government for entering into a contract is the 
timely completion of the projects so that the intended benefits may be achieved. 

The delay in the implementation of these projects defeated the objective of 

DepEd’s programs of providing electrical connections in priority schools 

without electrical connections and for the upgrading of electrical connections 

of priority schools with urgent needs. Losses on the part of the government will 

rise if condition will remain unattended by Management. Consequently, delay 

in implementation and losses should be justified by responsible officer/s. 

 

19.8 We recommended that the Management: 
 

a) instruct the Division Engineer to regularly monitor, evaluate, and 
validate all project accomplishments in order to ensure that projects 

are on schedule; 

 

b) ensure the timely releases of Sub-AROs in order to avoid delays in the 
implementation of the projects; 

 

c) arrange the full coordination with Electric Utility Provider and other 
concerned agencies including the community of the recipient Schools 

to achieve effective and more synchronized planning and 

implementation of programs and projects; 

 

d) require the contractor to ensure 100% project accomplishments 
within the duration of the projects or the specified contract time; 

 



443 

 

e) require the contractors to submit the request for final billing duly 
supported with the necessary documentary requirements if the 

projects are found to be 100% completed already; 

 

f) take actions on the unsatisfactory/insufficient performance made by 
the contractors and if necessary, investigate to ascertain if the 

contractors violated any provisions of the contract; 

 

g) ensure the necessary sanctions against the erring contractor as 
provided under RA No. 9184 such as the imposition of liquidated 

damages upon failure to complete the work within the contract period 

or in the event that the total sum of liquidated damages exceeds 10 

percent of the total contract price; and 

 

h) henceforth, minimize the delays in project implementation by: (a) 
conscientious carrying out of the detailed engineering to ensure that 

issues and viability of the projects are properly addressed during the 

feasibility or preliminary engineering study prior to project 

implementation; (b) thorough review and evaluation of the POW to 

ensure that project designs and estimates are properly prepared and 

covered the Bill of Materials issued by the Electric Utility Provider to 

minimize time extensions which often resulted to delayed completion 

of projects; and (c) strict monitoring and supervision of the projects 

implemented.

result, execution of MOA, 

construction of line, hang-up of 

transformer, application for turn-

accordingly and would somehow 

take time which are 

unintentionally not considered in 

the contract duration specially in 

the first year of the implementation 

of such project. 

 

The contractor of CY 2018 project 

was issued with enough warnings 

and notices and even undertakings 

in this Office in order to complete 

the projects so that it will then be 

utilized by the beneficiary which is 

the recipient schools since the 

scope of works in the load side is 

in place and the application is 

ongoing in the local electric 

cooperatives. As of this writing, 

two (2) recipient schools were 

scheduled for energization by 

BUSECO, namely, Dalirig NHS 

and San Vicente NHS while others 

are on process. 

 

In pursuit to strengthen the 

coordination of the concerned 

agencies min order to minimize 

delays of the project, coordination

cooperatives and DepEd thru the 

RO were conducted in order to 

resolve issues and concerns. The 

DepEd-EFD Central Office also 

hired Electrical Engineers detailed 

at the RO to assist the Division 

Offices in implementing the 

project thru preparation and 

revision of plans and POWs and 

monitoring of the projects. This 

Division also regularly coordinate 

with the local electric cooperative 

thru Official Letters, calls, emails, 

and personal appearance to follow-

up all necessary applications/ 

requirements. School Heads of the 

recipient’s schools are enjoined to 

take part in facilitating the 

applications and the 

implementation of the project. 

Further, your recommendations to 

the management are very well 

taken in order to eradicate the 

recurring issues regarding this 

project. Rest assured that a strict 

monitoring and synchronized 

coordination will be strengthened. 

Tangub 

City 

Management informed that there 

are still needed permits and that 

they had yet to coordinate with the 

Central Office for the structural 

analysis. However, to date there 

are already some completed 

projects. 

 

XI Davao City During the exit conference, the 

Division Engineer explained that 

some of the infrastructure projects 

were already terminated or 

discontinued and that he will 

provide an update regarding those 

projects. 

During the exit 

conference, the Audit 

Team Leader (ATL) 

stated that the 

infrastructure projects 

mentioned in the AOM 

do not pertain to 

terminated or 

discontinued projects. 

Moreover, the ATL 

requested from the 

Division Engineer a 

copy of the updated 

QPPA for validation. 

Further, the Audit 

Team shall closely 

monitor the status on 

the implementation of 

the infrastructure 

projects for CY 2019 in

Region SDO Management Comment Auditor’s Rejoinder 

the current and ensuing 

years. 

XIII Agusan 

Del Sur 

The Management of the Bayugan 

National Comprehensive High 

School under the SDO Agusan del 

Sur commented that the delays are 

the effects of the non-availability 

of electrical materials within the 

region and the declaration of the 

General Community Quarantine in 

the provincial level last March 17, 

2020 and the Enhance Community 

Quarantine (ECQ) in the city level 

from April 6 to 30, 2020 due to the 

spread prevention of the COVID-

19 virus.  This limited the delivery 

of manpower and material 

resources to the project sites, 

leaving the projects unattended for 

a period of time. 

 

As to the second observation, the 

delayed energization of schools 

was affected also by the hindered 

delivery, testing and installation of 

electric materials. The payment of 

power bill deposit can only be 

made after the testing, and the 

approval of transformer and 

metering components had been 

conducted by ASELCO. 

The concerned Auditor 

emphasized that as far 

as practicable, require 

the contractor to pay for 

the power bill deposit 

before inspection by the 

ASELCO so as to 

compel the latter to 

expedite the conduct of 

inspection. 

 

 

 

BEFF – School Furniture Program 

 

20. Pre and Post-Delivery Inspection of delivered School Furniture amounting 
P32,691,970.00 in RO VIII were not undertaken, thus the quality and compliance 

with the technical specification of the delivered items were not assured contrary 

to Enclosure 3 of DepEd Order No. 35, s. 2017 dated July 17, 2017. 

 

Moreover, school desks and furniture funded under the 2018 BEFF-Furniture 

worth ₱20,167,200.00 in CAR remained undelivered for 702 days as of December 

31, 2020, contrary to the contracts executed between the Department with the 

Suppliers. 

 

20.1 The BEFF is an annual appropriation that includes the acquisition of school 
desks for new and existing classrooms. Enclosure 3 of DepEd Order No. 35, s. 

2017 dated July 17, 2017, pertains to the Guidelines for the Implementation of 

the School Furniture Program under the BEFF, which provides the pertinent 

provisions related to contract implementation. 

 



449 

 

20.2 The Inspection of school furniture must be conducted in three different stages. 
Pre-delivery Inspection, during/on-site delivery and post-delivery. Pre-

delivery inspection shall be conducted prior to the delivery of finished school 

furniture to recipient schools. Inspection may be conducted at random at the 

manufacturing site of the supplier. The on-site delivery inspection is conducted 

during the delivery of the school furniture to the recipient school. All school 

furniture delivered by the supplier shall be inspected as to quantity and quality. 

After the delivery to recipient schools, a post-delivery inspection shall be 

conducted within the warranty period which is one year from the date of the 

Certificate of Completion. 

 

20.3 Post-audit of the CY 2020 procurement transactions in RO VIII disclosed that 
the payment was made for the supply and door-to-door delivery of school 

furniture to the different Kindergarten and Elementary Schools, Junior and 

Senior High Schools in Region VIII under the CYs 2017 and 2019 BEFF in the 

total amount of P32,691,970.00.  

 

20.4 As observed, there was no indication that the School Inspectorate Team had 
checked the delivery of the school furniture. The inspection report did not 

express whether they conformed with the approved technical specifications nor 

the team carried out the required pre and post inspections. Furthermore, no 

pictures were taken as an additional control measures and proof of deliveries 

to the recipient schools identified pursuant to existing DepEd directives on 

delivery and inspection. 

 

20.5 In DepEd CAR, review of reports disclosed that contracts  awarded to HAPPC, 
BARCMPC and Portal Steels, Inc. in the amount of ₱35,829,940.00 remains 

unpaid since they failed to complete their deliveries as of yearend.  

 

20.6 Further, it was learned that the SDO granted time extension of 60 days to 
BARCMPC and Portal Steels, Inc., and  90 days to HAPPC with the revised 

contract completion dates on their contracts set on October 2, 2018, and 

January 29, 2019, respectively. However, despite the time extensions granted 

to BARCMC and Portal Steels, Inc., for school furniture totaling 

₱20,167,200.00 remained undelivered as of December 31, 2020, or registering 

an unwarranted delays of 702 days. 

 

20.7 We recommended that Management of: 
 

Region VIII to –  

 

a) instruct the DepEd Inspectorate Team to immediately conduct Pre 
and Post-Delivery Inspection on all procured school furniture; 

 

b) take pictures on the delivered school furniture with the name of the 
respective school duly identified together with the School Head, 



450 

 

Property Custodian, School Inspectorate Team and DepEd 

Inspectorate Team; 

 

c) check whether the delivered school furniture conforms with the 
approved technical specifications and list down all the defective 

furniture with their corresponding purchase cost to determine its total 

value; 

 

d) make a formal demand from the respective Suppliers for the 
immediate rectification or replacement of defective furniture or those 

which do not conform with the approved technical specifications;  

 

CAR to –  

 

e) consider terminating the contracts of the suppliers, BARCMPC and 
Portal Steels, Inc. for the undelivered school desks and tables totaling 

₱20,167,200.00 and forfeiture of their performance security or 

retention money if applicable; 

   

f) impose the corresponding liquidated damages for the delayed 
deliveries by the HAPPC, BARCMPC, and Portal Steels, Inc. on the 

remaining deliverables and claims to the Department; and 

 

g) enforce sanctions against the erring suppliers by either imposing for 
their suspensions or blacklistings pursuant to RA No. 9184. 

 

20.8 The Management’s comments as well as the Audit Team’s Rejoinder are as 
follows: 

 
Region SDO Management Comments Auditor’s rejoinder 

CAR ROP The Chief of ESSD disclosed 

during the exit conference that 

they wrote letters to the suppliers 

informing them of the AOM 

issued by the Audit Team. In 

reply, Portal   Steels, Inc. 

requested that they would be 

given a chance to complete their 

delivery on or before May 31, 

2021. Management claimed that 

if they terminate the contracts, 

the funds could no longer be 

used because the validity period 

of two years had already expired.  

 

The Regional Engineer further 

informed that the delivery of 

Portal Steels, Inc. was ongoing, 

and while on the part of 

BARCMPC its delivery was 

The Audit Team advised 

Management to strictly monitor 

the delivery of Portal Steels, Inc. 

and to properly validate the 

deliveries made by Portal Steels, 

Inc. and BARCMPC.

Region SDO Management Comments Auditor’s rejoinder 

allegedly completed in 

December 2020, but still subject 

to validation by the Division 

Engineers. He further informed 

that a corresponding amount of 

liquidated damages to the 

Suppliers will be imposed to be 

deducted from their respective 

payments. 

 

It was also informed during the 

exit conference that they had 

written the suppliers concerned a 

show-cause order on why they 

should not be suspended or 

blacklisted. 

VIII ROP Management commented that 

the Office of the ESSD shall 

comply with the submission of 

cited documentary requirements 

as recommended. 

 

 

Textbooks/Instructional Materials Program  

 

21. An improvement in the utilization of DepEd-OSEC’s allotment under its Textbook 
and Other Instructional Materials Program for CY 2020 was noted compared to 

the previous years, as only ₱715,879,730.27 or 46.44 percent had remained 

unutilized as of yearend. Out of which, ₱368,042,210.97 or 51.41 percent was 

associated with the savings from the awarded contracts. However, the unutilized 

CY 2019 continuing budget of ₱176,205,436.64 had already lapsed at yearend  

and the delivery of Textbooks (TXs) and Instructional Learning Materials 

(I/LMs) programmed for the school year 2020-2021 was not assured since most 

of the contracts were only awarded in December 2020, thus not in accordance 

with DepEd Order No. 74, s. 2011 dated September 29, 2011, affecting the 

attainment of its physical targets during that period and depriving its intended 

end-users of the benefits from these learning resources.  

 

Other lapses related to the program were still observed such as; a) unreliable 

reports on Buffer Stocks due to variances/errors including the control breakdown 

in the inventory management; and b) other audit recommendations in prior years 

concerning the warehouses for Buffer Stocks remained not completely acted upon 

to date. 

 

21.1 The DepEd is mandated through the RA No. 9155, otherwise known as the 
Governance of Basic Education Act of 2001, to formulate, implement and 

coordinate policies, plans and projects in the areas of formal and non-formal 

basic education. It supervises all the elementary and secondary education 

institutions, including alternative learning systems, both public and private; 

and provides for the establishment and maintenance of a complete, adequate, 



452 

 

and integrated system of basic education relevant to the goals of national 

development. 

 

21.2 In consonance with its mandate, it is the policy of the DepEd to provide every 
pupil/student in all public schools with a complete set of textbooks (TXs) per 

grade/year level, and every teacher, a complete set of teacher’s manuals (TMs) 

which go with the textbooks. Likewise, it is the policy of DepEd to procure 

TXs and TMs on a centralized basis to avail of economies of scale5. 

 

21.3 The heads of the government agencies are responsible for ensuring that all 
resources entrusted to them are managed, expended, or lawfully utilized and 

safeguarded against loss or wastage to ensure efficiency, economy, and 

effectiveness in operations of government, as provided under PD No. 1445, s. 

1978, as amended.  

 

21.4 Chapter 8, GAM for NGAs Volume I provides the pertinent provisions related 
to Inventory Accounting System. These are as follows: 

 

Section 9 - Perpetual Inventory System requires accounting records to show 

the amount of inventory on hand at all times through the maintenance of the 

SLC by the Accounting Division/Unit and SC by the Supply and/or Property 

Division/Unit for each item in stock.     

 

Section 13 - The Inventory Accounting System consists of the system of 

monitoring, controlling, and recording of acquisition and disposal of inventory. 

It also requires that the Accounting and Property Offices shall conduct periodic 

reconciliation of their records to identify and adjust any discrepancy. Physical 

count/inventory, which is required semi-annually, is an indispensable 

procedure for checking the integrity of property custodianship. 

 

Section 14 - The Sub-Systems for inventory accounting are as follows: a) 

Receipt, Inspection, Acceptance and Recording Deliveries of Inventory Items; 

b) Requisition and Issue of Inventory Items; and c) Transfer and/or Disposal 

of Inventory Items. 

 

Section 17 – Provided list and explanation of the records, forms, and reports 

prescribed for use and/or to be maintained by the NGAs for the effective 

implementation of Inventory Accounting System.  

 

21.5 The utilization of the current year and CY 2019 continuing budget allotted for 
Textbooks and Other Instructional Materials for CY 2020 is above 50 percent 

based on the Status of Appropriations, Allotments, Disbursements, and

21.8 Out of ₱715,879,730.27 unutilized CY and PY continuing allotments, the

21.9 As mentioned also in the review of the procurement contracts mentioned in 
paragraphs 15.7 to 15.12, although the excess allocation can be considered as 

savings, the Agency still needs to evaluate the cause of significant amounts to 

avoid the over-estimated or excessive ABC and to ensure that the available 

funds will be used efficiently for its intended purpose. 

 

21.10 Other sources of the unutilized allotments are the discontinued Bureau of 
Learning Resources (BLR) projects returned by BAC as follows:

Evaluation of DepEd Developed Learning Resources (DDLRs) totaling 

₱4,141,080.00 was canceled by the BLR due to difficulty in acquiring

of Highly Technical Consultants of LREs. The remaining unutilized 

₱183,636,979.10 allotment pertain to non-procurement activities by the BLR.

21.12 Moreover, further analysis of the 2020 Registries of Allotment and Obligations 
revealed that the significant portion of the obligated allotment was made on the 

latter part of the year wherein ₱612,903,427.64 or 74.23 percent of the utilized 

budget in Textbooks and Other Instructional Materials Program of DepEd-CO 

were obligated in November and December 2020, as shown in the table below:

21.13 The Audit Team inquired with the BLR Division of DepEd-CO on the 
propriety of procuring the above-mentioned TX and I/LMs in the last quarter 

of CY 2020 despite the suspension of face-to-face classes. BLR replied in the 

affirmative and explained that this will serve as a venue for filling the gaps in 

the learning delivery and will also be used as additional sources of learning 

materials in the subject areas. In addition, DM-CI-2020-001626 provides that 

textbooks are still necessary learning resources in the Distance Learning 

Modality. Most Essential Learning Competencies (MELCs)-mapped DepEd 

TX/LMs shall be used as learning resources for all Distance Learning Delivery 

Modalities. When used with the activity sheets and learning plans, MELCs-

mapped DepEd Textbooks/LMs may substitute the printed SLMs. 
 

21.14 However, the late/delayed budget utilization/obligation is indicative that the 
projected targets of printing and delivery of the TXs and I/LMs in CYs 2019-

2020 intended for the timely use in the schools cannot be fully achieved. As 

such, teachers and learners were deprived of the necessary instructional 

materials during that school year when the said items were needed. As shown 

in BAR No. 1, Physical Report of Operation of DepEd-CO, some of the 

physical targets for the year were not accomplished. Details of the program 

accomplishment analysis are as follows:

456 

 

 

21.15 Based on the above table, there was no allocated budget for the procurement of 
the manuscript in the current year’s appropriation, while the continuing 

appropriation intended for this purpose was also realigned/deferred to prioritize 

the printing of the SLMs. This gives a zero-overall accomplishment for the 

number of manuscripts procured. 

 

21.16 For the TX and I/LMs procured, current year appropriation has a 95.78 
accomplishment rate. However, the contracts with planned procurement 

schedule in the second and third quarters of CY 2020 were belatedly started in 

the last quarter, and were only awarded in December 2020; hence, delivery will 

be made in the succeeding year. While the continuing appropriation had 

exceeded the target 3,811,646 quantity by 42 percent. 

 

21.17 Lastly, for the TX and I/LMs printed and delivered performance indicators, 
there is no accomplishment for the current year appropriation due to the late 

award of contracts as mentioned in the preceding paragraph, while for the 

continuing appropriation, the deliveries completed registered a minimal 12.35 

percent accomplishment rate. 

 

21.18 The impact of the slow-paced procurement and deliveries of the TX and I/LMs 
in CY 2020 reflects the Agency’s inability to address one of the recurring 

bottlenecks in the effective implementation of the Textbook and Other 

Instructional Materials Program, depriving among others, its intended end-

users of the benefit that can be derived from these learning resources. 
 

Other Lapses: 
 

i. Unreliable Report on the Inventory, Deliveries, and Issuances of Buffer 
Stocks due to variances/errors, failure to conduct physical inventory count, 

and non-preparation/accomplishment/submission of required documents 
 

21.19 The Audit Team had requested thru a letter dated January 22, 2021, the conduct 
of joint ocular inspection of five warehouses of DepEd-BLR located at 

National Nutrition Council (NNC) compound, Taguig City to validate the 

implementation of prior years’ audit observation on lapses in handling and 

storage of Buffer Stock, and unreliable reports on Buffer Stocks due to 

variances/errors including the control breakdown in inventory management. 

The submission of the following data/report was also requested before 

inspection: 

 

a) Inventory Report of Textbooks (TXs)/ Teacher’s Manual (TMs and 
Learner’s Materials (LMs)/ Teacher’s Guide (TGs) stored in the 

warehouses as of December 31, 2020 

b) Schedule of Deliveries and Issuances of Buffer Stocks 
c) Summary of Issuance/Releases of Buffer Stocks 
 



457 

 

21.20 The BLR/Asset Management Division (AMD) did not adhere to the prescribed 
semi-annual conduct of the physical count of inventories for control purposes, 

hence, the report for the second semester of CY 2020 which is due on January 

31, 2021, was belatedly submitted on May 7, 2021.   

 

21.21 However, analysis of the submitted CY 2020 report shows total receipts of 
6,561,480, total issuances of 5,132,965, and remaining buffer stocks of 

1,428,515 as follows:

21.22 Based on the above report, the remaining buffer stocks totaled 1,428,515 
TX/LMs. However, reliability of the said report is still questionable due to the 

following noted inconsistencies/errors/variances: 
 

 The total quantity delivered for CYs 2015-2019, as reported by the BLR in 
CYs 2018-2020 constantly changed over the past three years, casting doubt 

on the actual quantity of buffer stocks received by the BLR on this period.

 The total number of issuances/releases is 5,132,965 per summary, while per 
report on the breakdown of issuances and releases, it is only 5,132,964 

TXs/TMs or a difference of one TX/TM, hence the reported remaining 

buffer stocks should     be 1,428,516 instead of 1,428,515 TXs/TMs. 



459 

 

 

 Total quantity of issuances significantly increased from 1,689,961 in CY 
2019 to 5,132,965 in CY 2020; however, details of actual deliveries to 

SDOs were not validated due to the absence of pertinent details in the report 

such as actual date of issuance and reference numbers of RIS, RSMI, DRs 

and Acknowledgement Receipt (AR). The related source documents are 

also unavailable upon requests from the preparer of the inventory report.  

 

21.23 The above-noted deficiencies still reflected control weaknesses in the 
Inventory Management and Accounting System by the Agency about the buffer 

stocks. The proper turn-over of buffer stock accountability from BLR to AMD 

as previously recommended in audit was not yet fully implemented by the 

Management in CY 2020, thus the receiving, issuance, recording, and 

monitoring is still with the BLR.  Both the AMD and the Accounting Division 

are still not aware of the issuances or transactions affecting the buffer stocks; 

hence, no complete recording of inventory transactions and reconciliation of 

records was conducted by these offices which are prescribed in Chapter 8, 

GAM for NGAs Volume I. Thus, resulted in the overstatement of the 

Inventories account in the books of the DepEd-CO. 

 

21.24 Likewise, the delayed/non-submission of complete, accurate, and reliable 
inventory records by the BLR/AMD to the Audit Team rendered it difficult to 

ascertain the accuracy and existence of the reported Buffer Stocks Inventory 

account at yearend. 

 

ii. Other recommendations in prior years concerning the condition of 
warehouses for Buffer Stocks remained not acted upon to date. 

 

21.25 During the joint inspection of five warehouses in National Nutrition Council 
(NCC) Compound, Taguig City on February 21, 2020, the Audit Team noted 

a significant improvement in the warehouses’ condition compared to its state 

per the last inspection conducted last March 8, 2019. However, there are still 

some areas of the facilities which need improvement, to wit: 

 

 Warehouse No. 4 ceilings and windows are still dilapidated. 

 The storage rooms located on the 2nd floor of the NCC Building are still 
not installed with lightings. 

 There is no DepEd personnel assigned in the area for safekeeping and 
security purposes. 

 The scrap materials located in the Main Warehouse which were earlier 
reported in the previous inspection are not yet disposed to date, exposing 

the said warehouse to fire hazards, and occupying a portion of the space 

intended for learning materials. 

 

21.26 Follow-up joint ocular inspection/validation on status of Agency’s compliance 
with prior years’ observations and recommendations pertaining to these 



460 

 

warehouses was requested thru a letter dated January 22, 2021. However, due 

to delayed submission of the requested buffer stock inventory reports and the 

announcement of stricter community quarantine classifications in Metro 

Manila covering the month of March to May 2021, the said inspection was not 

conducted.  

 

21.27 In lieu thereof, the Audit Team had requested the BLR to submit a status report 
on the condition of these warehouses as of December 31, 2020, but they had 

submitted only the initial assessment report prepared by the Senior Technical 

Assistant of Administrative Service-General Services Division (AS-GSD) 

dated March 3, 2020 (Attached as Annex A) which according to BLR was a 

result of their various memoranda request for the repair and refurbishment. The 

BLR had pointed out that in general, the administration of the warehouses in 

Taguig is under the supervision of the Administrative Service thru the GSD. 

 

21.28 The summary of observations and comments under the said report are as 
follows: 

 

Warehouse No. 1  

 

 This is probably the biggest and has the least work to be done. The walls 
are properly plastered only. On the outside, only painting works need to be 

done. 

 Doors and windows are still working and functioning. 

 The area in the alley needs to be compacted as to the ground level. 

 There is one busted light that needs to be replaced. 

 Needs some repainting on the interior walls. 
 

Warehouse No. 2 – Pentasaptai AeroTech 

 

 Entrance door needs repainting. 

 Interior needs a few repainting works. 

 Ceiling needs to be repaired. Fluorescent needs to be replaced. 

 Outside ceiling eaves need to be replaced and renovated. 

 Repainting of exterior walls and ceiling restoration. 
 

Warehouse No. 3 – NCP 

 

 G.I. sheets are already brittle but may be enhanced. Door needs to be 
restored and repainted. Outside walls need to be repainted. 

 Electrical wiring needs to be arranged and organized. 

 There are loose steel C channels that need to be checked if safe or not. 

 It is very dark and no natural lighting in the center, only the sides. The 
suggestion is to have one fluorescent light per rafter for enough lighting. 

 



461 

 

Warehouse No. 4 – Sign Media 

 

 Exterior walls need to be repainted. 

 Almost all the ceiling in the whole area is dilapidated. 

 There is a need to provide exhaust fans inside. 

 Floorings need to be restored. 

 Telephone wirings need to be organized, labeled, and hidden in the ceiling. 

 There are termites on the top of the side door that needs to be treated. 
 

Warehouse No. 5 – NCC 

 

 Repainting on the walls for uniformity. 

 Replacement of some floor tiles and plywood for the ceiling. 
 

Warehouse No. 6 – Beside NCC 

 

 Some ceilings need to be restored. 
 

21.29 The report of AS-GSD confirmed the Audit Team’s previous years’ 
observations and even provided a more detailed assessment on the actual need 

for repairs and refurbishments of these warehouses’ facilities where the 

₱43,485,699.36 worth of TX and Other I/LMs buffer stocks are stored. 

However, because of lapses in communication between BLR, AMD, and GSD, 

the warehouse facility concern may still have not been acted upon due to the 

absence of an updated status report as of December 31, 2020. Moreover, the 

Audit Team has also noted that no procurement activities nor charges to repairs 

and maintenance specifically for this purpose were reported in DepEd’s CY 

2020 financial and budgetary reports.  

 

21.30 Thus, this observation is reiterated to remind the Management of the 
importance of placing appropriate contingency measures to ensure that all 

resources entrusted to them are managed, expended, or lawfully utilized and 

safeguarded against loss or wastage to ensure efficiency, economy, and 

effectiveness in operations of government, as provided under Presidential 

Decree (PD) No. 1445 or the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines. 

 

21.31 We recommended that Management: 
 

a) continuously assess the budget needs and estimates to improve the 
budget and cash requirement utilization of its Textbook and Other 

Instructional Materials Program appropriations; 

 

b) ensure that the utilization of fund is matched with corresponding 
physical output by adhering to planned procurement schedule and 

enforcement of agreed delivery timelines in the contract with the 

supplier; 



462 

 

 

c) address the noted inconsistencies/errors/variances on the Buffer Stock 
Inventory Report and account thru the BLR all stocks at the 

warehouses, maintain bin cards, and stock cards and submit the 

inventory report to the Accounting Division, COA, and the AMD for 

the complete and proper turnover of custody and accountability;  

 

d) establish the final total quantity and cost of buffer stocks delivered by 
the supplier and issued to different SDOs nationwide from CYs 2015-

2019 and submit the final/revised report duly supported with source 

documents; 

 

e) ensure adherence to Department’s specific guidelines and procedures, 
including responsible offices, officials, and appropriate 

documentation for the inventory accounting sub-systems such as: a) 

receipt, inspection, acceptance and recording deliveries; b) requisition 

and issue; c) transfer and/or disposal; and d) monitoring and 

inventory taking of inventory items; 

 

f) require the BLR/AMD to conduct the physical count of inventories 
semi-annually and submit the RPCI, complete with the needed 

data/information, not later than July 31 and January 31 of each year 

for the first and second semesters, respectively; and 

 

g) address the remaining issues in the warehouses as noted in prior years’ 
audit and the inspection conducted by the AS-GSD. 

 

21.32 The Management’s comments are as follows: 
 

 The DepEd CO AMD and the Accounting Division are continuously 
reconciling the prior and current years and they are just waiting for the final 

inventory of books from BLR; 

 Management will be implementing a new Logistic System that will help 
them in the documentation of inventory; 

 As to the conduct of physical count, AMD recommended with the 
Accounting Division to conduct quarterly reconciliation starting this 3rd 

quarter of CY 2021 and to include the inventory of buffer stocks in every 

physical count; and  

 For the warehouse in Taguig, they cannot recommend the repairs of the 
same because of the construction of railways and subways headed by 

DOTR in the subject DepEd property.

School-Based Feeding Program 

 

22. The nutritional needs of the identified school children of the two ROs were not 
properly addressed on time when the a) SBFP-regular component including its 

milk component for SY 2020-2021 suffered delays; while the b) milk feeding 

component for SY 2019-2020 was only completed at the end of CY 2020. More 

deficiencies that impeded the successful implementation of the program were 

likewise noted such as: c) purchased and distributed food and drink products 

categorized as RED (unhealthy); d) absence of product labels; e) absence of 

Physico-Chemical and microbiological test results in lieu of nutritional facts 

label; f) improper timing and scheme distribution of food and milk commodities; 

g) unutilized balance of allotment amounting P2,695,026.00; and h) 

unimplemented contracts both by Philippine Carabao Center (PCC) and 

National Dairy Authority (NDA). 

 

The foregoing deficiencies are attributable to the implementation setbacks 

encountered by the program proponents and challenges brought by the 

pandemic, depriving the intended recipients of the maximum benefits derived 

from the feeding program and defeating the government’s thrust of promoting 

budget efficiency pursuant to existing DepEd SBFP guidelines.   

 

22.1 Malnutrition and poor health among elementary school pupils leading to 
absenteeism, early dropout, and/or poor classroom performance have been 

observed since the early days. To address the said predicament, the Department 

of Education (DepEd) developed and conducted a feeding program scheme, 

which has gone through several reformations since its first launch in 1997 until 

it reached its present form as the School-Based Feeding Program (SBFP).  

  

22.2 On August 7, 2017, DO No. 39, series of 2017 was issued in order to establish 
the Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of SBFP for SYs 2017-

2022, which aims, specifically, to do the following:  

  

a. Provide feeding to learners, prioritizing the Severely Wasted (SW) and   
Wasted (W);  

 

b.Improve the nutritional status of the SW and W learners at the end of the 

120 feeding days;  

  

c. Ensure 100% deworming of target beneficiaries prior to the feeding 
activity;  

  

d.Conduct group daily hand washing and tooth brushing activities as 

stipulated in DepEd Order No. 10, s. 2016 to impart development of 

positive health-promoting values and behaviors;  

  



464 

 

e. Promote health and nutrition information and awareness among target 
beneficiaries through the K to 12 Curriculum and its alternative 

modalities of education; and  

  

f. Encourage Gulayan sa Paaralan Program and backyard vegetable 
gardening to augment the feeding program and to complement the 

nutrition and poverty-reduction initiatives of the Government.  

 

22.3 Moreover, the Department, through the Bureau of Learner Support Services-
School Health Division (BLSS-SHD), issued DepEd Order No. 23, s. of 2020 

dated September 7, 2020 for the Operational Guidelines on the Implementation 

of the School-Based Feeding Program for SY 2020-2021, to maintain its 

commitment in providing good nutrition to learners amidst the COVID-19 

pandemic. 

 

22.4 Meanwhile, Section 60 of the RA No. 11465, or the GAA for FY 2020, and 
Section 3.4 of the NBC No. 578 dated January 6, 2020 state that all 

appropriations authorized under the FY 2020 GAA, shall be available for 

release and disbursement for the purpose specified until December 31, 2020. 

However, RA No. 11520, as approved by the President on December 29, 2020 

extended the availability of the 2020 appropriations for Maintenance and Other 

Operating Expenses (MOOE) and Capital Outlay up to December 31, 2021. 

 

22.5 Further, DBM Circular Letter No. 2016-9 dated October 27, 2016 requires 
agencies to prepare a realistic MDP for the implementation of their programs 

and projects, taking into consideration the seasonality of activities, scheduled 

work targets of capital outlays, and timing of the grant of benefits, allowances 

and other similar items of expenditures. 

 

22.6 The Office of the Undersecretary for Administration (OUA) Memorandum No. 
00-1120-0214 dated November 16, 2020 was issued to extend the SBFP Milk 

and Nutritious Food Products Implementation using FYs 2019 and 2020 funds 

stating the following: 

 

“xxx 

 

Section 3.4.2 The completion of construction, inspection, acceptance and 

payment for infra-related CO shall be made not later than December 31, 

2021, while the delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment for MOOE 

and other CO items shall not be later than June 30, 2021. 

 

In view of the above, the SBFP Implementation for FYs 2019 and 2020, 

both milk and nutritious food products, shall be extended until June 30, 

2021. However, it is hereby reiterated that the FY 2019 and FY2020

conditions mentioned above, while the delivery, inspection, acceptance, and 

payment shall not be later than June 30, 2021. xxx” (Emphasis supplied)

22.7 The above extension covers the implementation of the milk component for SY 
2019-2020 and the implementation of SY 2020-2021 that has two components, 

namely: (1) the regular component [i.e., nutritious food products (nutripacks), 

rationed for at least 60 feeding days), and (2) the milk component (i.e., 

fresh/sterilized milk, for 50 feeding days]. 

 

22.8 In CY 2020, the DepEd allocated a total of ₱5,974,518,000.00 distributed to

22.9 The RO transferred the funds to the respective SDOs. For the implementation 
of the regular component, the SDO released the funds to the School Heads thru 

cash advances subject to liquidation, while for the milk component, the SDO 

transferred the funds to the NDA and/or the PCC. 

 

22.10 Evaluation of the implementation of the SBFP in the three ROs revealed non-
compliance with the program guidelines such as: a) delayed implementation of 

the SY 2020-2021 SBFP-Regular Component (nutritious food products) 

including its milk component; b) setback in the implementation of SBFP-Milk 

Component under the FYs 2019 and 2020 funds; other deficiencies that 

impeded the successful implementation of the program due to: c) purchased 

and distributed food and drink products categorized as RED; d) absence of 

product labels; e) absence of Physico-Chemical and microbiological test results 

in lieu of nutritional facts label; f) improper timing and scheme distribution of 

food and milk commodities; g) unutilized balance of allotment as at yearend 

amounting P2,695,026.00; h) unimplemented contract both by PCC and NDA; 

                                                           
7 Based on Actual SBFP Beneficiaries for SY 2019-2020

and i) reporting of fund transfer to Cash, LCCA as disbursement. Detailed 

discussion of the noted lapses are as follows: 

 

a) Delayed Implementation of the SBFP-Regular Component (nutritious 
food products) including its milk component  

 

22.11 The DepEd through the Bureau of Learner Support Services-School Health 
Division (BLSS-SHD) maintains its commitment to provide good nutrition to 

learners amidst COVID-19 pandemic.  

 

22.12 In CY 2020, the spread of the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID 19) brought 
numerous challenges in various sectors of the society, basically in the delivery 

of education.  The school calendar has been changed and  start of classes has 

been moved to  October 5, 2020 affecting the remaining number of school days 

for 2020 and learners are required to stay in their homes.   

 

22.13 Considering that the implementation of the feeding program is dependent on 
the new mode of delivery of education, the Education Department issued 

DepEd Order No. 023, series of 2020 dated September 07, 2020 to provide 

guidelines on the modified implementation of the SBFP with the goal of 

ensuring the attainment of the program’s objectives while also keeping the 

welfare, health, and safety of all the learners and personnel involved as top 

priority.  

  

22.14 Paragraphs 3 to 4 thereof states that the program’s primary beneficiaries shall 
be all incoming kindergarten learners, and the Grades 1 to Grade 6 learners 

who are wasted and severely wasted based on the SY 2019-2020 SBFP report, 

except those who have moved to Grade 7. In case of excess funds, the stunted 

learners identified as such in the SY 2019-2020 SBFP implementation, the 

pupils-at-risk of dropping out (PARDOs), indigenous people (IP) learners, and 

those coming from indigent families, shall be considered as secondary 

beneficiaries. The program shall supply beneficiaries with nutritious food 

products for at least 60 feeding days, and fresh or sterilized milk for 50 feeding 

days.  

  

22.15 Item I.B of the Enclosure to the aforesaid Order states that:  
  

Ordinarily a period of 120 days is ideal to achieve a significant impact 

on the nutritional status of children. However, due to the changes in the 

school calendar and in consideration of the possible lapse of the funds 

by yearend, the feeding for SY 2020-2021 is reduced to 60 days for the 

regular component and 50 days for the milk component. The 

program shall supply beneficiaries with nutritious food products for at 

least 60 feeding days xxx, and fresh or sterilized milk xxx for 50 feeding 

days.   

 



467 

 

CY 2020 SBFP – Regular Component 

 

22.16 Four SDOs reported a delay in the implementation of SY 2020-2021 SBFP-
Regular Component contrary to what was stipulated in the said DepEd Orders, 

details are as follows: 
 

RO SDO Audit Observations 

NCR Manila  SBFP Regular Component (nutripacks) was awarded only on December 
21, 2020 while the Notice to Proceed was issued and received by the 

supplier on December 28, 2020 and December 29, 2020, respectively.  

 An interview with the SBFP Focal Person on March 18, 2021 disclosed 
that the delivery of the nutripacks commenced on February 8 and 9, 2021 

and its distribution started on February 9, 2021 duly received by the 

parents of the students/pupil beneficiaries. A considerable delay of one 

month and one week between the date the NTP was received and the 

date of delivery. 

 For the implementation of Milk Component for SY 2020-2021, a 
transfer of funds was made to National Dairy Authority (NDA) under 

ADA No. 200-2021-03-056 dated March 5, 2021 amounting to 

P21,758,436.00.  However, as of date, the supply and delivery of the 

pasteurized milk have not yet started; thus, implementation suffered 

delays. 

Caloocan  Management conducted the SBFP orientation with stakeholders on 
October 15, 2020. On November 6, 2020, a coordination meeting was 

held to discuss the modality of procurement and feeding. The program 

was conducted through the administration of schools or school-led.   

 Of the total fund allocated totaling ₱89,221,361.00 for Regular and Milk 
Component, ₱78,798,015.00 was obligated leaving an unobligated 

amount of ₱10,423,346.00. Due to time constraint because the Sub-ARO 

from DepEd-NCR was received in August 2020 only, and to prevent the 

lapsing of unutilized fund at yearend, the Management decided to 

request funding from DBM an amount equivalent to 29 feeding days 

only for regular component amounting ₱16,713,839.80.  

Makati  SDO Makati downloaded on December 14, 2020 only the allocations to 
the respective schools/Accountable Officers for their individual 

procurement of nutripacks through cash advance. 

 Inquiry with the Focal Person and request of pertinent documents and 
reports relative to the FY 2020 SBFP implementation disclosed that the 

Regular Component of the program was not completed during the year 

and are still on-going, hence, the necessary data requested by the Audit 

Team were still unavailable. The distribution of food packs started in 

January 2021 only; hence, no actual feeding was conducted in CY 2020. 

XIII Bayugan 

City 

The Audit Team noted that due to the delayed preparation and approval of 

the Purchase Orders, the funds were transferred only on October 26, 2020 

and the delivery and implementation of the 20 days feeding period 

commenced only on November 26, 2020 or 52 days from the start of 

classes on October 5, 2020, hence the implementation was behind the 

timeline. 

 

22.17 Further interview/inquiry with SBFP Focal Persons of NCR-SDO Caloocan 
and five SDOs of Region XIII disclosed the following factors which are 

contributory to the delay in the implementation of the program:  

  



468 

 

Region SDO Causes in delay in the implementation of the program 

NCR Caloocan  Restriction of movement of people within the locality due to 

COVID-19 pandemic;  

 While keeping compliant with paragraph 3 of DO No 23, s. 2020 

which states that primary beneficiaries shall be all incoming 

kindergarten learners xxx, however, number of kindergarten 

students changes daily because they are enrolled late resulting in the 

adjustment in the number of food packs;   

 Time element in bringing nutritious packs from drop off point to 

homes of beneficiaries;  

 Shifting from hot meals cooked in the school to enhanced nutribun 

and nutri-packs causes delay because the suggested food technology 

products developed by Food and Nutrition Research Institute (FNRI) 

such as enhanced nutribun and nutri-packs are limited only. List of 

FNRI adaptors in NCR are limited, some are not responsive to the 

queries of schools; and  

 Contacting FNRI adaptors for the availability and delivery of 

nutritious food packs.  

XIII Agusan del 

Norte 

Cabadbaran 

City 

Delayed resolution between the DepEd-CO and the PCC on the 

identification of local milk supplier and its capacity to produce the 

volume of pasteurized milk needed and its delivery to various drop-off 

points. 

Butuan City Late preparation of PO and their lapses on failing to submit and 

coordinate with the Supply Office on PO preparation, completion of 

necessary information/specifications and proper recording. 

Surigao City 

and Surigao 

del Norte 

Due to the breakout of the COVID-19 and eventual pandemic where 

local services, travels and face-to-face set-up are constrained by varying 

protocols of the Local Government Unit. 

Bayugan City Delay in Batch 2 is due to delayed implementation of SBFP-Milk 

Feeding Component in areas identified under Batch 1 due to the limited 

production and supply of milk packs from the NDA. 

 

22.18 Despite the crisis encountered in the program implementation, it is worth 
mentioning that the DO Caloocan City is one of the three SDOs that started the 

program early in the last quarter of CY 2020, completing the required 60 days 

feeding period on the following year of March 2021. 

 

FY 2019 and 2020 SBFP-Milk Component  

   

22.19 The DepEd is mandated to implement the nationwide SBFP pursuant to RA 
No. 11037 or otherwise known as “Masustansyang Pagkain Para sa Batang 

Pilipino Act” and the GAA for FY 2019.  RA No. 11037 provides the inclusion 

of fresh milk or fresh milk-based products in the SBFP as additional component 

to the hot meals.   

  

22.20 Item II, Paragraph 2 of Department Order No. 036 s. 2019 dated December 13, 
2019 provides that the SBFP-Milk shall benefit the undernourished children 

from Kinder to Grade 6, who are covered under the SBFP beneficiaries for hot 

meals for a period of at least 20 days.  

  



469 

 

22.21 However, the implementation of SBFP-Milk Feeding Component in SY 2019-
2020 was deferred when issuance of implementing guidelines of the 

abovementioned Department Order was only issued in the latter part of CY 

2019 or on December 13, 2019 to the disadvantage of the identified school 

children beneficiaries; thus, their nutritional needs were not properly and 

timely addressed.  

 

22.22 Implementation of Milk Feeding using the 2019 fund was initially scheduled 
in March 2020. However, due to the pandemic brought about by COVID-19, 

DepEd Order No. 022 s. 2020 dated September 7, 2020 was issued for 

additional provisions and amendments to DepEd Order No. 036 s. 2019.  The 

Department Order aims to ensure the growth and development and also boost 

the immune system of learners during the pandemic. Paragraph 3.a(i) of the 

Order reads:  

  

In light of the COVID-19 Pandemic, the School-Based Feeding 

Program (SBFP)-Milk Feeding Component initially scheduled for 

implementation in March 2020 shall now commence in  

September 30 for areas identified under Batch 1 xxx Batch 2 will 

start in October 2020…Batch 3 in November 2020 xxx.  Milk 

feeding shall be conducted for a period of 20 days.  

 

22.23 Strengthening the implementation of the SBFP is identified in the BE-LCP as 
one of DepEd’s interventions for increasing the physical resilience of learners. 

In line with the BE-LCP, the SBFP implementation strategy for SY 2020-2021 

(includes CY 2019 milk component) was modified and DepEd Order No. 23 s. 

2020 dated September 7, 2020 was issued since the SBFP field implementers 

need proper guidance on how the program shall be implemented given all these 

new conditions and modifications in the program. 

 

22.24 In the last quarter of CY 2019 the following SDOs were allocated of fund to 
implement the program on Milk Component with noted material delay in its

In NCR-DO Manila 

22.25 Inquiry with SBFP Focal Person on the implementation of the SBFP-Milk 
Component using 2019 funds revealed that a planning conference to start the 

said component was conducted in March 2020 (before the lockdown) by the 

Central Office. In October 2020, the SDO made a transfer of funds to NDA 

amounting to P8,703,374.40 under JEV No. 01-2020-10-001980. The supply 

and delivery of the pasteurized milk was delivered to designated drop-off point 

schools on November 16, 23, 27 and December 7, 2020 and likewise 

distributed to the intended beneficiaries.  It commenced on November 16, 2020 

and ended on December 20, 2020. 

 

22.26 For the implementation of Milk Component for SY 2020-2021, a transfer of 
funds was made to NDA under ADA No. 200-2021-03-056 dated March 5, 

2021 amounting to P21,758,436.00. However, as of date the supply and 

delivery of the pasteurized milk have not yet started; thus, implementation 

suffered delays. 

 

While in NCR-DO Caloocan and Makati 

22.27 Funds for SBFP Milk Component 2019 was derived out of the agency’s 
continuing appropriation in FY 2020. Of the total allotment of ₱14,424,480.00 

received for the 2019 Milk Feeding Component, ₱14,160,123.20 was utilized, 

leaving a balance of ₱264,000.00 which was spent for monitoring allowance.  

  

22.28 With regard the implementation of Milk Feeding for SY 2020-2021, interview 
with the Focal Person of SDO on February 17, 2021 disclosed that no fund yet 

was received by the management because the contract implementation 



471 

 

documents like the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between the NDA and 

SDO Caloocan City, including the related Purchase Order, are yet for signing 

and/or notarization. Further, the NDA refused to deliver the milk unless and 

until fund transfer has been completely made.  

 

22.29 It can be deduced from the foregoing that the late execution of the Milk 
Component initially funded by GAA FY 2019 which was only completed at 

the end of the year, along with the challenges brought by the pandemic during 

the year, considerably affected the start of implementation of the SY 2020-

2021 SBFP (regular and milk components) that had overlapped in the ensuing 

year.   

  

22.30 Such delays in the execution are mainly attributable to the belated issuance of 
the operational guidelines and subsequent amendments of the Department’s 

Orders related to the program by the policymakers at the top including the 

timing of releases of the Sub-AROs and related project documents.  Likewise, 

the pandemic outbreak that hit the country during the early part of the year that 

resulted in the disruptions of the school calendar and the limitation of the no 

face-to-face class interactions had contributed as well.  

  

22.31 Apparently, it is noticeable that these setbacks are beyond the control of the 
SDOs which had a domino effect in its project execution and performance that 

extended the SBFP FYs 2019 and 2020 implementation beyond the scheduled 

timelines including the attainment of its expected outputs.  

  

22.32 The above observations are indicative of the Department’s, as a whole, inability 
to properly execute the program and deliver the planned results in a timely 

manner depriving its beneficiaries of the maximum benefits that can be derived 

thereon, particularly in addressing the nutritional needs of its school children.  

   

22.33 The substantial delay is largely attributable to the late release of Sub-ARO 
which was received by the SDO in the last quarter of 2019, belated issuance of 

relative operational guidelines issued only on December 13, 2019, late 

notarization of the Mother MOA, and the disruptions caused by the pandemic 

including the additional provisions and amendments in the DepEd Orders 

released on September 2020 including the Memorandum. It is worth 

mentioning that these implementation setbacks are notably beyond the controls 

of the SDOs, which considerably affected and contributed to extending its 

SBFP FYs 2019 and 2020 implementation beyond December 2020.  

 

22.34 The amount downloaded to NCR-DO Makati for the implementation of SBFP- 
Milk Component for SY 2020-2021 amounting to ₱1,676,700.00 was not 

utilized during the year and instead transferred from MDS to LCCA in 

December 29, 2020.  

 

 



472 

 

b) Purchased and distributed food and drink products categorized as RED 

 

22.35 Part V of the Operational Guidelines of the said DepEd Order provides: 
 

A.  As substitute to hot meals, nutritious food products shall be provided to the 

beneficiaries, considering the availability of the said products from the 

market as well as the taste sensitivity in the locality. The nutritional content 

of the nutritious food products and fresh/sterilized milk should meet one-

third (1/3) of the beneficiary’s daily requirements for energy (calories), 

protein, vitamin A, and iron – as specified in the Philippine Dietary 

Reference Intakes (PDRI). 

 

B.  The Regional Office, through the SBFP Focal Person, in collaboration with 

the SDO’s focal persons, shall prepare a regional food supply map of 

nutritious food products available in the region, and a localized one-month 

cycle menu based on the available nutritious food products. In general, the 

cycle menu shall be composed of but not limited to a combination of the 

following: 

 

1. Fortified/enriched breads; 
2. Root crops/fruit in season/vegetables; and 
3. Fortified blended food and nutri-packs. 

 

22.36 The Policy and Guidelines on Healthy Food and Beverage Choices in Schools 
and in DepEd Office as provided in DepEd Order No. 13, series of 2017, dated 

March 14, 2017 classify food and drinks as those under GREEN Category, 

YELLOW Category, and RED Category. The RED Category includes foods 

and drinks, which are not recommended as these contain high amounts of 

saturated fat or sugar or salt, and they may also provide excess energy or 

calories, hence, should not be served. These include, among others, soft drinks, 

alcoholic drinks, powdered juice drinks, or any other processed fruit/vegetable 

juice with added sugar of more than 20 grams or 4 teaspoons per serving. 

Moreover, cakes and slices, donuts, sweet biscuits and pastries and other sweet 

bakery products, chocolates, yema, french fries, instant noodles, and all other 

types of heavily salted snacks are under this category. Deep-fried foods, fruits 

canned in heavy syrup, and sweetened fruits and vegetables are likewise 

included thereunder. 

 

22.37 Audit disclosed that the SBFP implemented by 11 Elementary Schools under 
the SDO of Surigao del Sur in Region XIII was ineffective as the food given to 

the incoming kindergarten, and Grades 1 to 6 pupils, being the SBFP’s primary

22.38 Inquiry with the SBFP Coordinator revealed that the above-enumerated 
Schools resorted to the said products for distribution in order to avoid food 

spoilage as they would still travel for long hours and cross the river before 

arriving at the destination. 

 

22.39 Notwithstanding the said limitation, the food and drink products distributed to 
the target beneficiaries still did not conform with the required specifications 

and quality standards, defeating the primary purpose of providing the learners 

the needed nourishment for their maximum growth potential and in increasing 

their physical resilience. By giving these food and drinks, instead of 

contributing to the improvement of their nutritional status and help boost their 

immune system, the learners were even more exposed to risks as the food and 



474 

 

drinks given pertained to those that should even not be given in view of high 

amount of saturated fat, sugar and salt contents.  

 

c) Absence of product labels, e.g. dates of production and expiration and 
other basic information on the procured pasteurized milk pouches 

 

22.40 Item VIII of DepEd Order No. 023 s. 2020 on the “Delivery, Inspection and 
Acceptance” specifically points out under paragraph D(h) the importance of 

“Observing the expiry dates of food commodities” as one of the precautionary 

measures in the implementation of SBFP. 

 

22.41 Similarly, Item 2.3 of the approved MOA, separately and distinctly entered into 
and between the SDOs Agusan del Norte, Butuan City and Cabadbaran City,  

as the first parties to the contract and Philippine Carabao Center (PCC) as the 

second party of the contract, outlines that “The terms and conditions indicated 

in the PO, specifying the quality standards, specifications, delivery and storage 

instructions, among others, shall be strictly complied with by the Parties.” 

 

22.42 Actual inspection during delivery of procured pasteurized milk at various 
school drop-off points of three SDOs in Region XIII disclosed that the procured 

milk products do not contain the necessary labels, as prescribed. It was revealed 

that the mentioned deficiency transpired due to incomplete details in the 

prepared PO. Perusal of the submitted POs totaling ₱6,334,668.00 revealed the 

following observations, summarized below:

d) Absence of Physico-Chemical and microbiological test results in lieu of 
nutritional facts label 

 

22.43 Item 3.b.iii of DepEd Order No. 022 s. 2020 on Specifications, Quality 
Standards, and Delivery of Fresh Milk and Sterilized Milk, states, among 

others, that as part of quality assurance, a proximate analysis on the Physico-

Chemical and microbiological test on milk shall be submitted by NDA/PCC as 

an alternative to nutrition facts before the first delivery of milk. 

 

22.44 Item 1(a) on the terms and conditions attached to the MOA and the PO provides 
that the milk products should contain the following Nutritional Contents: 

 
Required Nutritional Contents 

Particulars Minimum amount per Pack of Milk 

Energy 120-150 kcal 

Protein 6-10 grams 

Carbohydrate 8-15 grams 

Fat 3-7 grams 

Vitamin A 70-130 µg RE 

Calcium 280-300 mg 

Sodium <120 mg 

Energy, Protein, Carbohydrates and Fats must be expressed in or rounded off to whole 

numbers, but not in any way lower than the minimum amount as stated above. 

 

22.45 Actual inspection by the Audit Team on the delivery of the procured 19,400 
pasteurized 200-ml milk pouches to Region XIII-SDO Bayugan City revealed 

the absence of nutritional facts labels on the products. Shown under Exhibit 1 

is the actual packaging of the 200-ml milk packs taken upon delivery thereof: 
 

Exhibit 1. Actual packaging of the 200-ml milk packs 

  

22.46 In the absence of both nutritional facts labels on the procured items; and 
Physico-Chemical and microbiological test, the conformance to the required 

nutritional contents of the milk packs could not be validated, thereby posing 



476 

 

health risk to the intended beneficiaries on possible consumption of expired 

food products. 

 

e) Improper timing and scheme distribution of food and milk commodities 

 

 e1.  Milk Component for SY 2019-2020 

 

22.47 Part V, Item F of DepEd Order No. 036, s. 2019 dated December 13, 2019 
provides the guidelines on the storage and control system of milk, to wit: 

 

a. The SDOs shall ensure effective, efficient and systematic handling, 
storage and distribution of the fresh milk to be used in the Program 

from the time the milk is received and inspected. Its representatives 

shall submit reports prescribed by the program. 

 

b. Safekeeping of milk stocks shall be the responsibility of the School 
Head and school personnel. 

 

c. The fresh milk packs shall be stored in a cool, dry place prior to its 
distribution at lunch time. When necessary for preservation, unused 

delivered stocks for the day shall be stored properly to ensure its 

quality and freshness. Separate guidelines detailing proper storage 

will be issued by the BLSS-SHD to the field offices. 

 

d. Sterilized milk packs shall be stored in a secured, clean, pest-free, 
and well-ventilated area in the school. Boxes of milk shall be piled 

on pallets following the supplier’s stockpiling requirement. 

    

22.48 Audit disclosed that in Region XIII-SDO Bislig City adopted a distribution 
scheme wherein the quantity of milk commodities rationed to the target 

beneficiaries covered their seven to 13-day consumption, as shown below: 
 

Distribution Schedule of Milk Component 

Batch Distribution  Date of Distribution Period Covered 

First December 2, 2020 Seven (7) Days 

Second December 16, 2020 Thirteen (13) Days 

Total 20 Days 

 

22.49 It has to be emphasized that one of the objectives of the SBFP is to develop the 
learners’ milk drinking habit and be provided with the nourishment needed for 

their maximum growth potential. To achieve this, entails that they drink milk 

on a daily basis, and the conduct of proper monitoring would contribute to such 

realization. The scheme of rationing milk products thru a one-time distribution 

to cover their seven to 13 days consumption would expose the consumption of 

these milk products in less than the desired daily intake. Moreover, the 

allocated milk products would even be exposed to risk of being consumed 

earlier than the desired schedule. 

 



477 

 

22.50 The concerned DepEd personnel must have also considered the financial 
capability of the families of the learners as regards proper storage. While the 

scheme being implemented may have been a good option in view of the 

limitations brought by the COVID-19 pandemic such as the prohibition of 

physical face-to-face classes and the imposition of certain restrictions and 

health protocols, nonetheless, it could not be ascertained whether or not the 

milk stocks were properly stored in a cool and dry place after these were 

distributed to the beneficiaries. Considering the financial status of the 

beneficiaries to provide refrigeration of the said goods, proper storage of milk 

commodities to ensure its quality and freshness may have been adversely 

affected. 

 

22.51 Based on research, holding pasteurized milk at temperatures above 45°F will 
shorten the shelf life dramatically; the colder the milk the longer it will last, the 

warmer the milk, the quicker it will spoil. Ideal storage temperatures for milk 

and dairy products are 34-38°F. Under ideal refrigeration, most pasteurized 

milk will remain fresh for 2-5 days after its sell-by date. Once opened, 

pasteurized milk should be used as soon as possible for best quality and taste. 

 

22.52 It was also noted that the said scheme resulted in the shifting of the 
responsibility as regards the safekeeping and storage of milk commodities from 

the School Head and the school personnel to the beneficiaries. By distributing 

to the target beneficiaries, the products which are good for 7-13 days, the 

families of the beneficiaries were burdened by the responsibility of storing 

them to preserve their quality and freshness. This responsibility is entrusted to 

the School Heads and the concerned school personnel as per the above-cited 

DepEd Order.  

 

  e2. Regular Component (Nutritious Food Products) for SY 2020-2021 

 

22.53 Part VIII, Item C of the Operational Guidelines under DepEd Order No. 023, 
s. 2020, as regards food packaging and distribution, states: 

 

a. With physical classes, schools shall strategize schemes to deliver the 
nutritious food products and milk packs to the beneficiaries in their 

homes. 

 

i) Parents can pick up the nutritious food products and milk to 
designated days and time. 

 

ii) School personnel may opt to distribute the nutritious food 
products and milk from the school to the homes of the 

beneficiaries by contracting local utility vehicles in the 

community within reasonable costs. 

 



478 

 

iii) School personnel may coordinate with partners such as the 
barangay or non-government organizations (NGOs) to distribute 

the milk packs from the school to the homes of the beneficiaries. 

 

b. Nutritious food products to be distributed to the homes of the 
learners shall be hygienically packed in environment-friendly bags. 

The use of plastic bags is discouraged. Parents who will pick up the 

foods products can also bring their own reusable bags. 

 

c. During the repacking of nutritious food products, personnel must 
adhere to food safety standards and the required health standards 

such as handwashing before handling foods products, wearing of 

masks, gloves, face shields, and practice of physical distancing. 

 

d. Even if nutritious food products and milk are to be consumed at 
home, it is important to communicate to the parents that the 

beneficiaries shall be the ones to consume the food and milk. 

 

e. School shall document the receipt of food items by parents for all 
deliveries made. All receiving documents shall be forwarded to 

SDOs at the end of feeding cycle for accounting and recording 

purposes. 

 

22.54 Furthermore, in SDO Bislig City the following deficiencies were noted with 
regard the distribution of nutripacks for SY 2020-2021: 

 

a. Quantity of food products distributed to target beneficiaries covered their 
five-day consumption being done on a weekly basis; 

  

b. Perishable food products such as meat bread, pan de coco, cheese bread, 
empanada, peanut bread, monggo bread, ube and spanish bread, 

ensaymada, and fruits such as apple, mango, poncan and banana, 

distributed is susceptible to spoilage if not properly stored. 

 

f) Unutilized balance of allotment as at yearend amounting P2,695,026.00 
 

22.55 DepEd Order No. 018, s. 2019 dated July 23, 2019 was issued to provide 
supplemental guidelines on the implementation of SBFP for FY 2019. Among 

these is the utilization of the available balance from program funds, which 

states that: 

 

The remaining balance from Program Funds after implementation of the 

full cycle of the feeding program shall be used for the following 

purposes: 

 

A. Xxx 



479 

 

 

B. Other remaining funds may also be used for SBFP-related 
activities such as orientation activities for field implementers, 

monitoring SBFP, Gulayan sa Paaralan Program (GPP) and other 

health and nutrition implementations of the programs/projects; 

purchase of weighing scale, multivitamins/micronutrient 

supplements/iron folic, medical and dental supplies, funds 

/augmentation for hygiene kit. Other remaining funds may also 

augment the development/refurbishment of central kitchen. 

 

C. Xxx 
 

In Region IV-A 

 

22.56 Review of the Accomplishment Report and Program Terminal Report on the 
implementation for SBFP for SY 2019-2020 disclosed an unutilized balance 

amounting P2,695,026.00. The same report revealed the absence of weighing 

scale and the recommendation of the SBFP coordinator for the conduct of 

workshop on the proper determination of weight, height and body mass index 

(BMI). However, these issues remain despite the available balance from its 

program allocation. 

 

g) Unimplemented contracts both by PCC and NDA  
 

22.57 Fund Transfer (FT) amounting to P16,485,240.80 and P4,185,663.20 to PCC 
and NDA, respectively, made by Region IV-A of SDOs of Rizal Province, 

Cavite Province and General Trias City during the year 2020 was received by 

the two implementing agencies (IAs) under various Official Receipts; however, 

the contracts for the delivery of the milk remained unimplemented as of 

yearend. 

 

22.58 In view of the foregoing observations, we recommended that Management 
to:   
 

NCR – SDO Caloocan 

 

a) enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the program/project 
executions through better planning and greater coordination among 

all the levels in the Department to ensure the timely completion of the 

program and attainment of its objectives;   

 

b) confer with the Central Office (BLSS-SHD) and the SBFP Focal 
Person of DepEd-NCR in addressing the underlying causes of the 

delays and setbacks encountered in the program implementation 

during its initiation, planning, execution, monitoring and completion;  

 



480 

 

c) observe timeliness in carrying out the program to avoid delays in its 
implementation that will compromise the nutritional needs of its 

intended beneficiaries; 

 

RO XIII - SDO Surigao del Sur 

 

d) direct the School Heads, the Core Group, and other concerned 
personnel to ensure that the foods and drinks distributed are 

nutritious and affordable;  

 

e) implement more stringent monitoring measure to ensure the 
compliance of the schools with the guidelines, health and nutritional 

assessment, and other complementary activities;  

 

f) direct the School Heads concerned to: 

 submit to the Office of the Auditor the duly-signed distribution 
lists of food and drink commodities to ascertain actual receipt 

thereof by the identified beneficiaries; 

 check if all delivered milk products were timely consumed and 
to address the issues relating to spoiled milk products, if any; 

 ensure that all project documents have all the necessary 
information, complete, authorized and approved. Otherwise, 

defer the program implementation in cases of deficient project 

documentations, unless sooner resolved; 

 

SDO Bayugan City

quality standards in the delivered milk products in conformity with 

Item 3.b.iii of DepEd Order No. 022; 

 

SDO Bislig City 

 

h) to revise the scheme presently adopted and to strategize a different 
approach that could lead to the program’s optimum advantage in 

delivering nutritious milk packs to the identified beneficiaries; 

 

i)  implement more stringent monitoring measures to ensure the 
compliance of the schools with the guidelines, health and nutritional 

assessment, and other complementary activities;  

 

j) responsibility for storage and safekeeping of the milk stocks shall be 
discharged by the School Heads and other concerned school 

personnel; 

  



481 

 

 

RO IV-A 

 

k) focal person to explain the unutilized funds for SBFP program; and 
 

SDO Rizal Province, Cavite Province, General Trias City 
 

l) to coordinate closely with the PCC and NDA demanding the 
submission of Report of Disbursements and related documents on

contract. 

 

22.59 The Management comments and Auditor’ rejoinder are presented below: 

 
RO/SDO Management Comment Auditor’s Rejoinder 

NCR - Caloocan In a letter dated April 5, 2021 the SDS, Chief of 

SGOD and SDO SBFP Focal stated that: 

To further enhance the implementation of the 

SBFP, SDO Caloocan would enforce the 

following integrated approach and innovative 

strategies, to wit:

with SBFP Implementers (School Heads, 

Finance Officers, Feeding Coordinators and 

some members of the Technical Working 

Group) to help ensure the timely completion of 

the program and attainment of its objectives; 

and 

 Monitor and provide technical assistance that 
includes documentation of good practices and 

challenges encountered through key informant 

interviews (Klls), evaluation, and periodic data 

collection.

working group, and volunteers; make proper 

evaluation, and periodic data collection as 

 



482 

 

RO/SDO Management Comment Auditor’s Rejoinder 

deemed necessary and still with the guidance of 

the SDO officials. 

 The project team worked closely with partners 
from NDA, FNRI-DOST, and SBFP Division 

Focal Persons to develop implementation 

guidelines for the integrated school nutrition 

model using consultative and participatory 

processes. It was formulated after a careful 

study and virtual meeting of the functional and 

structural challenges encountered in 

implementing SBFP during COVID - 19 

Pandemic. 

 Last March 2021, DepEd Central Office, RO 
and some SDO SBFP focal were invited to join 

and discussed the draft guidelines for SBFP 

2021-2022. The identified gaps were addressed 

through further refinements in the 

implementation and sustainability measures. 

 The schools adhere to the guidelines set by the 
project team of SDO who worked closely with 

partners from NDA, FNRI-DOST, and Focal 

Persons as they develop cautious 

implementation guidelines for the integrated 

school nutrition model using consultative and 

participatory processes. It was formulated after 

having undergone a thorough and careful study 

and virtual meetings responding to the 

challenges encountered in implementing SBFP 

during COVID-19 Pandemic; and 

 To avoid delays in the implementation of the 
program, SDO Caloocan shall strategize the 

implementation plan to carry out the program. 

XIII - Surigao del Sur The concerned SBFP focal person concurred on 

the noted observations and explained that they 

overlooked to complete the required 

specifications on the PO particularly by indicating 

the dates of production and expiration. 

Nonetheless, the concerned officer assured to 

implement and observe the prescribed procedures 

on their succeeding procurements on SBFP 

program implementation. 

 

XIII - Bayugan City 

 

The Management of Bayugan City Division 

Office commented that there was in fact an actual 

conduct of the physico-chemical and micro-

biological test by the NDA, only that the result 

was not communicated before the delivery. In the 

next round of implementation of the milk feeding 

program, the NDA has already assented to the 

submission of the test result required before and 

during the delivery of the milk products and to 

require their contracted supplier to properly label 

the milk packs with the nutritional contents 

therein as required in the relevant DepEd Orders. 

 

The concerned personnel had made the same 

observation and stated that the matter had already 

been raised in a virtual meeting conducted with 

the NDA and other Division Offices. The 

concerned personnel assured to implement and 

observe the prescribed procedures on their 

succeeding SBFP-related procurements. 

 



483 

 

RO/SDO Management Comment Auditor’s Rejoinder 

 IV-A 

 

The remaining funds were already downloaded to 

Division Offices for feeding of all learners in far 

flung schools and schools with 100 enrollees; 

procurement of supplies, materials; and conduct of 

trainings and capability buildings in relation to 

SBFP. 

 

The remaining fund of P2,695,026.00 was 

supposedly be utilized for food and 

accommodation for the scheduled conduct of 

capability buildings and trainings in relation to 

SBFP but due to the Taal volcano eruption and 

face to face conduct is not allowed during 

COVID-19 pandemic, the activity was instead 

done virtually.  

 

IV-A Rizal Province Management commented that they already 

informed the implementing unit to give details on 

the delivery of the milk products and other future 

implementation of feeding programs and assured 

to comply with COA Circular No. 94-013. 

 

 

 

 

 

IV-A Cavite Province Management commented that the FT amounting to 

P8,668,123.20 PCC had already been fully utilized 

on March 11, 2021. The Focal Person is currently 

processing necessary documents from different 

school districts for submission to the SDO. 

 

The Audit Team will 

look into the 

implementation of the 

feeding program and 

check the pertinent 

documents upon 

submission. 

IV-A General Trias City Management commented that SBFP Milk 

Feeding was implemented from November 18 to 

December 9, 2020. On January 13, 2021 they 

made follow up to PCC thru their SBFP 

Coordinator for the liquidation but unfortunately 

one of the staff was found positive for COVID-

19; thus, hindered the timely submission of 

reports. 

The Audit Team will 

post-audit the said 

Liquidation Report upon 

submission. 

 

DepEd Computerization Program (DCP) 

 

23. In DepEd Central Office, only 7,555 packages or 16.29% out of the 38,827 revised 
targets of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Packages under 

the DCP funded by the General Appropriations Acts (GAAs) for Fiscal Years 

(FYs) 2018-2020 were delivered as noted in the submitted Budget Accountability 

Report (BAR) No. 1 – Quarterly Physical Report of Operation as of December 

31, 2020. Also, comparison of the APP and Procurement Monitoring Report 

(PMR) for FY 2020 showed delays incurred ranging from 60-317 calendar days 

(CD) in the procurement of the FY 2020 DCP packages with ABC of ₱2.37 billion, 

thus, adversely affecting the program’s objectives of enhancing the teaching-

learning process and raising the ICT literacy of learners and educators 

beneficiaries.  

 

Moreover, the status of the FY 2015 ICT packages under Batch 34 of DCP 

Unenergized Viz which procurement was transferred to the DBM-PS and 

remained not procured as per submitted Management Comments for prior 

year’s observation was not properly reported in the submitted BAR No. 1. 



484 

 

 

Other deficiency was found in DepEd Region II where the delivery of IT Package 

(E-Textbooks) amounting ₱649,345.00 intended for Senior High Schools (SHS) 

were delivered to Basco Central School which is not offering any ICT Track, thus 

the intended purpose may not be achieved. 

 

23.1 Section 2 of the DepEd Order No. 78, s. 2010 dated June 10, 2010 entitled, 
Guidelines on the Implementation of the DepEd Computerization Program, 

states that: 

 

 DCP aims to provide public schools with appropriate technologies 

that would enhance the teaching-learning process and meet the 

challenges of the 21st century. This program shall respond to the 

computer backlog of public schools by providing them hardware and 

software, and training on simple trouble shooting. 

 

23.2 The objectives of the Program were further detailed in Section 3 of the said 
Order, enumerated as follows: 

 

1. Provide computer laboratory packages to secondary schools; 
2. Provide e-classroom to elementary schools; 
3. Provide laptop units to mobile teachers; 
4. Integrate ICT in the school system; 
5. Raise the ICT literacy of learners, pupils, students, teachers and school 

heads; and 

6. Reduce the computer backlog in public schools 
 

23.3 The Quarterly Report of Operation as of December 31, 2020 or BAR No. 1 
submitted by the Department showed that the DCP has a physical 

accomplishment of 7,555 out of the total targeted of 46,382 ICT packages 

delivered or an accomplishment rate of 16.29%, leaving a balance of 38,827 

packages of which 94% or 36,679 items represent the FY 2020 DCP, as shown

23.4 The non-delivery of the targeted 36,679 FY 2020 DCP packages with ₱2.37

the different procurement activities as shown in the comparison between the 

planned activities stated in the Department’s APP with the PMR for FY 2020,

23.5 Based on the above table, the Department was still behind in its scheduled 
timelines of procurement for DCP in FY 2020, the same issue noted in the 

previous years. This deficiency continuously affects the attainment of the 

program’s objectives of enhancing the teaching-learning process and raising 

the ICT literacy of learners and educators beneficiaries. 

 

23.6 It was noted that the status of the FY 2015 DCP Unenergized Viz (Batch 34) 
was not included in the submitted BAR No. 1 which procurement was 

transferred to DBM-PS and remained not procured as per submitted 

Management Comments for prior year’s observation, details are as follows:

23.7 On the other hand, Region II Audit Team’s scrutiny of the Property Transfer

was for “Supply, Delivery of IT Package (E-Textbooks) for Senior High

23.8 It is to be noted that DepEd Memorandum dated July 18, 2019 issued by the 
Undersecretary for Administration prescribes the guidelines for the 

deployment/delivery of the IT packages to SHS offering ICT Track. 

 

23.9 Relying on the correctness of the details contained in the PTR issued by the 
Central Office, the IT Package delivered to Basco Central School, which is not 

a high school offering ICT Track, the units may become unusable or 

incompatible with the needs of the user-learners hence, the intended purpose 

may not be achieved. 

 

 

 



487 

 

23.10 We reiterate our previous years’ recommendations that Management: 
 

a) review the Agency’s internal processes related to procurement in 
order to further improve its service delivery and its compliance with 

timeline requirements of Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) 

of RA No. 9184;  

 

b) provide an explanation/justification on the delayed implementation of 
the DCP FY 2020;  

 

c) provide status of procurement of the FY 2015 DCP Unenergized Viz 
(Batch 34) which was transferred to DBM-PS which should be 

required to expedite the procurement thereof; and 

  

d) require the DCP Coordinator in Region II-SDO Batanes to explain the 
delivery of IT Package (E-Textbooks) amounting to ₱649,345.00 to 

Basco Central School which is not a Senior High School offering ICT 

Track. Accordingly, inquiry shall be made with the Central Office as 

to the correctness of the transfer. 
 

23.11 Management’s comments/actions/commitments are as follows: 
 

 The DepEd Enterprise Resource Planning System (DERPS) project 
contains a module for Procurement that will automate several processes 

and allow DepEd to diagnose step which need to be re-engineered. 

Customization for the said module is already on-going in parallel with 

reforms in the manual processes of the procurement cycle which includes 

early procurement activities; 

 Delayed implementation of the DCP FY 2020 was due to COVID-19 crisis 
which required new mechanisms on how procurement would be done 

without face-to-face interaction. There was also restriction and limitations 

on the movement between the procuring entity and the suppliers/bidders; 

 For the FY 2015 ICT Packages under Batch 34 of DCP Unenergized Viz, 
DBM-PS has already relayed to DepED that the said funds have already 

lapsed. The Program Team will ensure coordination with our Planning 

Service for proper reporting in the BAR-1; and 

 As to the delivery of IT Package to Basco Central School, E-Textbooks are 
designed to be used from elementary to senior high school. They are not 

exclusive for ICT Track-in Grade 11-12. 

 

Technical-Vocational-Livelihood (TVL) Program 

 

24. Intended beneficiaries of the Technical-Vocational-Livelihood (TVL) learning 
tools and equipment were deprived of its immediate use in DepEd Regions I 

(ROP), III (DO Pampanga), VIII (ROP), XIII (ROP) and CAR due to:                       

a) undelivered/delayed delivery, including for unterminated contracts, totaling 



488 

 

₱86,638,202.14, b) deficiencies found in the post-audit of disbursements 

amounting to ₱34,528,962.99 including a take-over of contract of ₱1,214,692.25, 

c) undetermined status of delivery and implementation of four contracts totaling 

₱103,300,851.50 as a result of lack of proper monitoring and assessment, and d) 

terminated contracts worth ₱10,195,304.00, indicating non-compliance with 

Department Order Nos. 8 series of 2016  and 046 s. 2018. 

 

24.1 Aligned with the Senior High School Program, the Department of Education 
issued Department Order No. 8 series of 2016 which provides for the guidelines 

on the procurement of TVL specialization tools, equipment and materials for 

SY 2016-2017. The DepEd provides the necessary Tools and Equipment to 

various specializations or programs offered by TVL-SHS for effective teaching 

and learning process to produce technically competent learners ready for the 

world of work. It has four main courses, namely: 1) Agri-Fishery; 2) Home 

Economics; 3) Information and Communication Technology; and 4) Industrial 

Arts. 

 

24.2 Also, DepEd Order No. 046, s. 2018 provides the guidelines on the fiscal year 
2018 release and utilization of TVL Funds. The guidelines are for the 

procurement of TVL learning tools and equipment of the implementing units 

(IUs) and SDOs, which discuss the procedures of the release and utilization of 

funds, the roles of the recipient IUs and SDOs, the quality assurance protocols, 

the delivery, storage, utilization and documentation. 

 
24.3 TVL aims to provide an opportunity for students to be employable after 

finishing Grade 12 if they choose not to pursue tertiary education because of 

financial constraints.  Students must pass the competency-based assessment of 

the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority and obtain the 

National Certificate (NC) I or II. To get the NC I or II, TVL students must 

show their competencies in handling the equipment units and tools of their 

chosen TVL specialization. To help students become competent the DepEd 

must provide the necessary tools and equipment units. 

 

24.4 Noted observations are as follows: 
 

a) undelivered/delayed delivery, including for  unterminated contracts, 
totaling ₱86,638,202.14 

 

24.5 The supplier’s failure to deliver goods within the specified period stipulated in 
the agreement is tantamount to the termination of the contract as provided for 

in the 2016 Revised IRR of RA No. 9184 Annex “I” – Guidelines on 

Termination of Contracts for Goods: 

 

A.  Termination for Default 

 



489 

 

“The Procuring Entity shall terminate a contract for default when 

any of the following conditions attend its implementation: 

 

a. Outside of force majeure, the Supplier fails to deliver or 

perform any or all of the goods within the period(s) specified in 

the contract, or within any extension thereof granted by the 

Procuring Entity pursuant to a request made by the Supplier 

prior to the delay, and such failure amounts to at least ten 

percent (10%) of the contract price;  

 

b. As a result of force majeure, the Supplier is unable to deliver or 

perform any or all of the Goods, amounting to at least ten 

percent (10%) of the contract price, for a period of not less than 

sixty (60) calendar days after receipt of the notice from the 

Procuring Entity stating that the circumstance of force majeure 

is deemed to have ceased; or 

 

B. The Supplier fails to perform any other obligation under the 

Contract. 

 

C. Termination for Convenience 

 

“The Procuring Entity may terminate the Contract, in whole or in 

part, at any time for its convenience.  The Head of the Procuring 

Entity may terminate a contract for the convenience of the 

Government if he has determined the existence of conditions that 

make Project Implementation economically, financially or 

technically impractical and/or unnecessary, such as, but not 

limited to, fortuitous events or changes in law and national 

government policies.” 

 

24.6 The 2016 Revised IRR of RA No. 9184 Annex “D” – Contract Implementation 
Guidelines for the Procurement of Goods, Supplies and Materials provides 

that: 

 
3.1.1.  “When the supplier fails to satisfactorily deliver goods under the 

contract within the specified schedule, inclusive of duly granted time 

extensions, if any, the supplier shall be liable for damages for the delay 

and shall pay the procuring entity liquidated damages, not by way of 

penalty, an amount equal to one-tenth (1/10) of one percent (1%) of the 

cost of the delayed goods scheduled for delivery for every day of delay 

until such goods are finally delivered and accepted by the procuring 

entity concerned. 

 



490 

 

“The procuring entity need not prove that it has incurred actual damages 

to be entitled to liquidated damages.  Such amount shall be deducted 

from any money due or which may become due to the supplier, or 

collected from any securities or warranties posted by the supplier, 

whichever is convenient to the procuring entity concerned.  In no case 

shall the total sum of liquidated damages exceed then ten percent (10 %) 

of the total contract, in which event the procuring entity concerned may 

rescind the contract and impose appropriate sanctions over and above 

the liquidated damages to be paid”. 

 

24.7 In DepEd Region I ROP, records show that the agency had terminated contracts 
of the suppliers for the procurement and delivery of TVL Equipment in 2019. 

During the auditorial review of the contracts for the Procurement and Delivery 

of TVL Equipment for CY 2020, the audit team noted that contracts had 

exceeded the expected delivery date which is 45 days from the date of receipt 

of NTP. The agency received requests for an extension of delivery from the 

suppliers but its action plan for CY 2020 was to terminate the contracts based 

on the amount of undelivered items of TVL Equipment for the past four (4) 

years. As of the Region’s RCML date, however, these contracts totaling 
₱47,661,666.00 in which delivery of equipment to the recipient schools was 

not completed were not yet terminated. 

 

24.8 While in DepEd CAR, TVL tools and equipment units were procured in CYs 
2016 and 2017 which are to be used by students in their classes. However, there 

were tools and equipment units from these procurements that were not yet 

delivered as of December 31, 2020, or the items were delivered late and 

remained unpaid as shown in the following table:

24.11 RA No. 9184 provides the following pertinent regulations, to wit: 
 

Section 10 states that “All Procurement shall be done through 

Competitive Bidding, except as provided for in Article XVI of this Act.” 

 

Section 53.3 also states that “Take-over of contracts, which have been 

rescinded or terminated for causes provided for in the contract and 

existing laws, where immediate action is necessary to prevent damage 

to or loss of life or property, or to restore vital public services, 

infrastructure facilities and other public utilities.”  (Underscoring ours) 

 

Annex H of the Revised IRR of RA No. 9184 states the specific 

guidelines for Negotiated Procurement through Take-over of contracts. 

It also enumerated the procedures for take-over of contracts which is 

partly quoted as follows: 

 

xxx if the original awardee is a Single Calculated Responsive 

Bidder/Single Rated Responsive Bidder, the BAC may either invite at 

least three (3) suppliers/contractors/consultants to submit their bids, or 

resort to any other appropriate alternative method of procurement xxx 

 

Annex I: GUIDELINES ON TERMINATION OF CONTRACTS 

 

I. PURPOSE, SCOPE, AND APPLICATION 

 

These guidelines aim to promote fairness in the termination of 

procurement contracts and to prescribe contract conditions and 

measures to enable government to protect its interests. For this purpose, 

policies and procedures relating to the whole or partial termination of 

government procurement contracts of goods, infrastructure projects, and 

consulting services are herein established. 

 

xxx 

 

IV. PROCEDURES FOR TERMINATION OF CONTRACTS 

 

1. Verification. Upon receipt of a written report of acts or causes 
which may constitute ground(s) for termination as aforementioned, 

or upon its own initiative, the Implementing Unit shall, within a 

period of seven (7) calendar days, verify the existence of such 

ground(s) and cause the execution of a Verified Report, with all 

relevant evidence attached. 

 

2. Notice to Terminate.  Upon recommendation by the Implementing 
Unit, the Head of the Procuring Entity shall terminate contracts 



493 

 

only by a written notice to the Supplier/Contractor conveying the 

termination of the contract. The notice shall state: 

 

a) that the contract is being terminated for any of the ground(s) 

afore-mentioned, and a statement of the acts that constitute the 

ground(s) constituting the same; 

b)  the extent of termination, whether in whole or in part; 

c)  an instruction to the Supplier/Contractor/Consultant to show 

cause as to why the contract should not be terminated; and 

d)  special instructions of the Procuring Entity, if any. 

 

The Notice to Terminate shall be accompanied by a copy of the 

Verified Report. 

 

3. Show Cause. Within a period of seven (7) calendar days from 
receipt of the Notice of Termination, the 

Supplier/Contractor/Consultant shall submit to the Head of the 

Procuring Entity a verified position paper stating why the contract 

should not be terminated. 

 

If the Supplier/Contractor/Consultant fails to show cause 

after the lapse of the seven (7) day period, either by inaction 

or by default, the Head of the Procuring Entity shall issue an 

order terminating the contract.

24.13 Post-audit of the transactions revealed the following deficiencies under the DO 
Pampanga, to wit: 

 

b.1 Non-conduct of Quality Control Inspection 

 

24.14 DepEd Order No. 046 provides the quality assurance and control in procuring 
TVL goods. As such, Paragraph 11.5 provides that the SDO inspectorate Team 

conduct pre-delivery inspection at the warehouse of the supplier. In addition, 

the SDO inspectors shall seal the package of the goods that passed the 

inspection and test by signing and providing date across the sealing tapes. They 

also need to provide QC PASSED sticker on the goods that passed the QC 

inspection. 

 

24.15 Furthermore, final inspection and acceptance at the recipient schools, the 
School Inspection and Acceptance Team (SIAT) shall conduct inventory and 

final acceptance and may also conduct re-inspection and re-test of the delivered 

goods to validate the completeness and the condition of the Goods as it arrived 

since the goods passed the SDO inspection and provided with "QC PASSED" 

sticker. It is also advised that to ensure quality and correctness of the delivered 

goods, the SIAT should not accept delivery with broken seal or open package. 

 

24.16 Interview with the Division Inspector claimed that the required pre-delivery 
inspection at the warehouse of the suppliers was conducted. However, our 

interview with the concerned personnel of the recipient schools disclosed that 

the items delivered lacked the necessary seal to prove that such deliveries were 

inspected and tested by the SDO Inspectorate Team. 

 

24.17 In addition, the Audit Team was also informed that during deliveries, the 
recipient schools were only provided with DRs without any approved technical 

specification/approved sample that can be used as the basis to ensure the 

quality and correctness of the delivered goods.  

 

24.18 Moreover, one of the recipient schools during the ocular inspection of the Audit 
Team revealed that some TVL equipment, tools and materials were delivered 



495 

 

to their school, which did not offer a SHS subject that will make use of such 

materials. 

 

24.19 Further, audit interview with one of the recipients of TVL – Horticulture 
teachers revealed that some items delivered were of low quality and can be 

harmful when used by students. 

 

b.2 Incomplete Documentation 
 

24.20 PD No. 1445 provides the hereunder relevant provisions: 
 

Section 2. Declaration of Policy. It is the declared policy of the State that 

all resources of the government shall be managed, expended or utilized in 

accordance with law and  regulations, and safeguarded against loss or 

wastage through illegal or improper disposition, with a view to ensuring 

efficiency, economy and effectiveness in the operations of government. 

The responsibility to take care that such policy is faithfully           adhered to 

rests directly with the chief or head of the government agency 

concerned. 

 

Paragraph 6, Section 4, states that claims against government funds 

shall be supported with complete documentation. 

 

Section 33. Prevention of irregular, unnecessary, excessive, or 

extravagant expenditures of funds or uses of property; power to disallow 

such expenditures. The Commission shall promulgate such auditing and 

accounting rules and regulations as shall prevent irregular, 

unnecessary, excessive, or extravagant expenditures or uses of 

government funds or property. 

 

Section 39. Submission of papers relative to government obligations.  

 

(1) The Commission shall have the power, for purposes of inspection, 

to require the submission of the original of any order, deed, contract, 

or other document under which any collection of, or payment from, 

government funds may be made, together    with any certificate, receipt, 

or other evidence in connection therewith. If an authenticated copy 

is needed for record purposes, the copy shall upon demand be 

furnished. 

 

(2) Xxx. 
 

It shall be the duty of the officials or employees concerned, including 

those in non-government entities under audit, or affected in the audit 

of government and non-government entities, to comply promptly 

with these requirements.  Failure or refusal to do so without justifiable 



496 

 

cause shall constitute a ground for administrative disciplinary action 

as well as for disallowing permanently a claim  under examination, 

assessing additional levy or government share, or withholding or 

withdrawing government funding or donations through the 

government. 

 

Section 123. Definition of internal control. Internal control is the plan of 

organization and all the coordinate methods and measures adopted 

within an organization or agency to safeguard its assets, check the 

accuracy and reliability of its accounting data, and encourage adherence 

to prescribed managerial policies. 

 

Section 124. Installation. It shall be the direct responsibility of the 

agency head to install, implement, and monitor a sound system of 

internal control. 

 

24.21 Similarly, IRR of RA No. 9184 requires various supporting documents for 
procurement such as directive to post NOA and NTP and the approved contract 

in the PhilGEPS.  

 

24.22 In SDO Pampanga, the Audit Team’s scrutiny of the transactions also revealed 
that the required supporting documents were not submitted, to wit: 

 

DV No. Remarks 

20-02-0648-A No attached - 

-price quotation of the winning supplier 

-PhilGEPS Registration Number 

-Mayor’s/Business Permit 

-proof of posting requirement in PhilGEPS of NOA and NTP 

20-04-1670 

20-04-1671 

20-09-2946 

 

24.23 Moreover, BAC Resolution No. 2019-015 and Resolution No. 2019-016, both 
dated October 14, 2019 which were attached to DV Nos. 20-04-1670 and 20-

04-1671, respectively, were signed by Ms. Rowena T. Quiambao as BAC 

Chairperson. Apparently, Ms. Quiambao was on official leave of absence and 

was temporarily replaced by Mr. Leonardo C. Canlas as BAC Chairman for 

Goods and Services as evidenced by the Special Order No. 26, s. 2019, thereby 

casting doubt on the validity and legality of the aforesaid Resolutions. 

 

24.24 Also, in DepEd Region VIII (ROP), audit and verification of the CY 2020 
disbursement transactions of the agency disclosed payments made for the 

supply and door-to-door delivery of TVL tools and equipment for Senior High 

School program totaling P21,889,112.16.  

 

24.25 Supporting documents attached to the DVs for the payment of the six contracts, 
revealed that the Report on Door-to-Door deliveries made by the supplier to 

the respective recipient schools were not supported with the following 

documents to establish transparency and reliability of the report and to aid 



497 

 

management in monitoring the actual deliveries made per school considering 

the distance        and as part of its internal control: 

 

- Pictures on the delivered items together with the School Head and 
the designated School Inspectorate Team; 

 

- Pictures taken with the School Head and the /designated School 
Inspectorate Team taken at the gate where the name of the school is 

located, this is the best evidence that delivery were being made in 

that school; 

 

- Pictures taken during the installation, testing, commissioning & 
trainings for various TVL tools & equipment conducted by the 

supplier; 

 

- Duly subscribed and sworn to Certification issued by the respective 
School Head and designated School Inspectorate Team certifying 

that the delivered TVL tools & equipment were complete and in 

good condition. 
 

24.26 Also, the Agency Inspection Report prepared by the designated Inspectorate 
Team cannot  be concluded as Post Inspection Report of the delivered items 

since it does not indicate the following: a) name of the school; b) items 

delivered; c) remarks whether the items delivered conform with specifications 

and in good condition; and d) that the installation, testing, commissioning and 

trainings for various tools & equipment were being undertaken by the supplier. 

 

24.27 Moreover, the said Agency Inspection Report was not supported with pictures 
with the School Head and the Designated Property Custodian taken at the gate 

where the name of the school is located, as evidence that post inspection of 

deliveries was really conducted in that particular school. 

 

24.28 It was also observed that the DVs were certified by the Chief Accountant that 
supporting documents were complete. 

 

24.29 The absence of the above-stated necessary documents to support the reported 
door-to-door    deliveries made to the different identified schools in Region VIII 

including the agency inspection report, affected the veracity and reliability of 

the said report and validity of the             transactions. 

 

b.3 Splitting of Procurements 

 

24.30 Section 54.1 of the same RIRR defines splitting as follows: 
 

Splitting of Government Contracts is not allowed. Splitting of Government 

Contracts means the division or breaking up of GoP contracts into smaller 



498 

 

quantities and amounts, or dividing contract implementation into artificial 

phases or sub-contracts for the purpose of evading or circumventing the 

requirements of law and this IRR, particularly the necessity of competitive 

bidding and the requirements for the alternative methods of procurement. 
 

24.31 Small Value Procurement (SVP)  as stated in Section 53.9 is an alternative 
mode of procurement under Negotiated Procurement which involves 

procurement of Goods, Infrastructure Projects and Consulting Services, where 

the amount involved is within the threshold, provided, that in case of Goods, 

the procurement does not fall under shopping. Accordingly, the threshold for 

National Government Agency is one million pesos (₱1,000,000.00). 

 

24.32 Audit of DV Nos. 20-04-1600, 20-04-1601 and 20-05-1882 revealed that the 
SDO Pampanga used the SVP as the method of procurement. The pertinent 

Purchase Requests (PR) for the three transactions were prepared on December 

2, 2019. Interview with the Budget Officer revealed that the source of fund was 

from savings of the aforementioned Sub-Allotment Release Order No. OSEC-

3-18-15155. 

 

24.33 Though PRs were prepared per specialization package, it was noted that PR 
No. 2019-12-346 contained three (3) specialization packages totaling 

₱888,805.49 while PR No. 2019-12-344 and PR No. 2019-12-345 each 

contained single specialization package amounting to ₱883,240.36 and 

₱813,776.14, respectively. This gave the Audit Team an impression that the 

management purposely divided each purchase request and resulted in splitting 

of transactions to circumvent the requirement for necessity of competitive 

bidding and the requirement for alternative mode of procurement. 

 

24.34 Similarly, in CY 2019, SDO Pampanga entered into a contract with Hanjenn 
Enterprises using Take-over of Contract under the Negotiated Procurement as 

the mode of procurement. The details are as follows:

499 

 

24.35 Our audit of the transaction disclosed that the above-mentioned project was 
originally awarded to Infinite Powertech Scientific Equipment Sales being the 

Single Calculated Responsive Bidder under Competitive Bidding and the 

Division Office entered into a contract on December 18, 2018, the contract 

duration of which was 70 calendar days. 

 

24.36 However, on March 5, 2019, due to the failure of the supplier to make a 
delivery on the specified date, another 45 days extension period was requested 

which was duly approved on March 6, 2019. In spite of the approved extended 

period until April 29, 2019, the supplier still failed to make a delivery. 

 

24.37 In view of this, on July 23, 2019, eighty-four (84) calendar days after the 
failure of the supplier to make a delivery on the extended period, the SDO 

enjoined the above-mentioned supplier to submit a show cause regarding the 

non-delivery of goods.  

 

24.38 It is to be noted that the contract duration or completion period as specified in 
the contract was 70 calendar days including the extension period of 45 days 

which was extended up to April 29, 2019.  

 

24.39 However, it was only on September 2, 2019, one hundred sixteen (116) 
calendar days after the failure of the supplier to make a delivery, when the Bids 

and Awards Committee made a resolution recommending the termination of 

the contract between SDO Pampanga and Infinite Powertech Scientific 

Equipment Sales. Moreover, no Verified Report was attached to the letter. 

 

24.40 Also, on September 13, 2019, one hundred twenty eight (128) calendar days 
after the failure to make a delivery on the extended period, a Notice to 

Terminate the contract was sent to the above-cited supplier for failure to submit 

timely the required position paper. Apparently, SDO Pampanga failed to 

observe the timelines in the termination of contract.  

 

24.41 Our evaluation of the procurement process showed that management had not 
closely monitored, coordinated and assessed the contracts entered with 

suppliers especially contracts which were already 100% delayed in terms of 

delivery.  

 

24.42 On December 10, 2019, after the termination of the contract with Infinite 
Powertech Scientific Equipment Sales, the BAC sent thru electronic mail the 

invitation to bid to three suppliers which was dated December 6, 2019. The 

opening of bid was conducted on December 16, 2019. 

 

24.43 From the date the original contract was terminated, to date of opening of bids, 
one hundred five (105) days had already lapsed, which gives an impression 

that such procurement of goods does not meet the criteria of take-over of 



500 

 

contracts where immediate action is necessary to prevent damage to or loss of 

life or property, or to restore vital public services, infrastructure facilities and 

other public utilities. 

 

24.44 The agency should have opted to use competitive bidding as the mode of 
procurement rather than negotiated procurement for it will only take a 

maximum period of fifty-two (52) days from posting of invitation to bid to bid 

opening as recommended in Annex C of the Revised IRR, thus affecting the 

regularity of the transaction. 

 

24.45 Meanwhile, some deficiencies were also noted in the post-audit of the 
transaction such as: 

 

a. The DV was not completely filled out, no date, no DV number and was 
not signed by the Schools Division Superintendent (SDS);  

 

b. The date of receipt of the NOA by the winning supplier was not indicated;  
 

c. The proofs of posting of NOA, NTP and Contract at the PhilGEPS were 
not submitted; and  

 

d. The BAC Resolution dated December 16, 2019 recommending the award 
of contract to Hanjenn Enterprises was signed by the former SDS 

Leonardo D. Zapanta who was already transferred to SDO Zambales in 

October, 2019. 

 

24.46 In view of the foregoing, the SDO Pampanga failed to comply with the 
government policy on procurement of competitive bidding and may result in 

not obtaining the most advantageous price for the government. Likewise, the 

regularity of the transactions was not established. 

 

24.47 Further, had the procurement of various TVL tools and equipment been 
monitored rigorously and judiciously from its planning stage up to the point of 

completion, the procurement of tools and equipment under CY 2018 TVL 

Program for Senior High School could have been delivered and used by the 

students and teachers at the start of SY 2019-2020. 

 

c) undetermined status of delivery and implementation of four contracts 
totaling ₱103,300,851.50 as a result of lack of proper monitoring and 

assessment 

 

24.48 Section 68 of the 2016 Revised  IRR of RA No. 9184 provides that “all 
contracts executed in accordance with the Act and this IRR shall contain a 

provision on liquidated damages which shall be payable by the contractor in 

case of breach thereof. For the procurement of Goods, Infrastructure Projects 



501 

 

and Consulting Services, the amount of the liquidated damages shall be at least 

equal to one-tenth of one percent (1/10 of 1%) of the cost of the unperformed 

portion for every day of delay. Once the cumulative amount of liquidated 

damages reaches ten percent (10%) of the amount of the contract, the 

Procuring Entity may rescind or terminate the contract, without prejudice to 

other courses of action and remedies available under the circumstances.”  

 

24.49 Also, Section 39 of the same law provides that “to guarantee the faithful 
performance by the winning bidder of its obligations under the contract in 

accordance with the Bidding Documents, it shall post a performance security 

prior to the signing of the contract.  It shall be denominated in Philippine Pesos 

and posted in favor of the Procuring Entity, which shall be forfeited in the event 

it is established that the winning bidder is in default in any of its obligations 

under the contract 

 

24.50 Under DepEd Region XIII, four contracts were entered for the “Supply and 
Door to Door Delivery of TVL Tools and Equipment” either through public 

bidding or under alternative mode of procurement – negotiated procurement 

totaling ₱103,300,851.50, as presented below:

24.51 The above table shows that the NTPs were received by the supplier or his/her 
authorized representative in CY 2017 and in January 2018, thus the latest 

estimated delivery date was June 2018. However, to date these procurements 

remained unpaid by the Accounting Unit since the related documentation were 

not yet processed for payment, which could mean that complete delivery was 

not yet made. No report was presented on whether or not the cumulative 

amount of liquidated damages reached ten percent (10%) of the amount of the 

contract. 

 

24.52 Our inquiry with the concerned personnel disclosed that she was not aware on 
the status since the contract stipulated for a door to door delivery, meaning 



502 

 

goods were directly delivered to the concerned schools. However, she 

mentioned that partial delivery may have been made as of this writing. She 

mentioned that a Technical Working Group (TWG) was constituted which was 

mostly composed of Secondary School Teachers from Agusan del Norte and 

Butuan City Divisions who were directed to conduct inspection on the 

delivered goods to different schools. She also provided us copies of the “Status 

Report on the Utilization of Senior High School Technical-Vocational 

Livelihood Tools and Equipment” for the month of February 2021 from 

different Division Offices. However, these reports could not be identified if 

these referred to items procured under the four (4) contracts mentioned above, 

or the contracts from other suppliers which were already paid by the RO, thus 

could not be considered as monitoring on the status of delivery of the four (4) 

mentioned contracts. 

 

24.53 Another concerned personnel from the RO provided us distribution lists of 
TVLs per Division Office, however these were not indicative if these pertained 

to the above contracts, thus could not be utilized as a basis for the monitoring 

of delivery. Records disclosed that several request for extension was filed by 

suppliers, however, these were not acted by the Management before and it was 

only in October 2020 that the requests were approved by the Management 

granting the extension until December 31, 2020. 

 

24.54 On the other hand, the above-mentioned contracts were not incorporated in the 
Agency’s Report on Government Projects/Programs/Activities as required 

under COA Circular No. 2013-004 dated January 30, 2013 for monitoring 

purposes and to promote good governance through transparency and 

accountability. 

 

24.55 We noted that the said procurements were not properly monitored at the 
Regional level because they could not present a status report on the delivery of 

the TVL tools and equipment. Considering the payment will be made at the 

RO, a regular monitoring should have been made as the delivery has a wide 

latitude covering the entire CARAGA Region. As a result, they have failed to 

assess the suppliers’ performance and to check on whether or not the 

cumulative amount of liquidated damages reached ten percent (10%) of the 

amount of the contract, which could have been the basis to impose the 

applicable provisions under RA No. 9184, particularly on the termination of 

contract and forfeiture of performance security.  

 

24.56 Had Management considered terminating the contracts with these suppliers in 
default, and awarded the same through negotiation with other eligible 

suppliers, further damages could have been avoided and the needed goods 

would have been made available to the schools and had been beneficial to the 

students before the onset of the pandemic.  

 



503 

 

24.57 The absence of monitoring on the delivery is an indication that the 
Management needs to strengthen its control measures not merely to impose 

sanctions to defaulting suppliers, but to ensure that quality and quantity of 

goods are in accordance with the specifications per contract, and most 

importantly to ensure that the objectives of procuring these tools and 

equipment were not defeated. 

 

d) terminated contracts worth ₱10,195,304.00 
 

24.58 Lot Nos. 7 and 11 in DepEd CAR under Infinite Powertech Scientific 
Equipment Sales with a contract price of ₱1,417,904.00 and ₱8,777,400.00, 

respectively, were terminated due to the inability of Infinite Powertech to 

deliver the tools and equipment units for consumers’ electronics servicing and 

electrical installation maintenance. It was learned that these two contracts were 

awarded to RALCO Commercial Trading but subsequently partially terminated 

by the agency on August 5, 2020. 

 

24.59 We recommended that the concerned DepEd Regions: 
 

a) take appropriate action to terminate the contracts of defaulting 
suppliers/contractors to protect the interest of the agency to ensure 

strict compliance with the guidelines prescribed under Annex “I” and 

Annex “D” of the Revised IRR of RA No. 9184; 

 

b) conduct actual inspection of the delivered TVL Tools and Equipment 
to ascertain the quality and compliance with the technical specification 

per contract; 

 

c) submit the necessary documents and proofs of compliance according 
to the aforementioned relevant rules and regulations; 

 

d) stop the practice of splitting the contracts and strictly adhere to the 
provisions of RA No. No. 9184 in all procurements; 

 

e) monitor the implementation of the contract from the start to end, 
particularly the delivery time; 

 

f) adhere strictly to Section 10 and 53.3 of RA No. 9184 to avoid 
occurrence of irregular expenditure which can lead to disallowance of 

transaction; 

 

g) ensure that the DVs and other supporting documents are completely 
filled out and signed before payment; 

 

h) conduct another procurement process to procure for the undelivered 
items of the TVL tools, if possible; 



504 

 

 

RO III (DO Pampanga) - 

 

i) submit an explanation or justification on the use of SVP and strictly 
comply with Sections 53.9 and 54.1 of the Revised IRR of RA No. 9184; 

 

j) justify/explain why the BAC Resolution which was approved on 
December 16, 2019 was signed by the former SDS Leonardo D. 

Zapanta who was already transferred to another Division in October 

2019; 

 

CAR - 

 

k) provide sanctions to the three suppliers either suspension or 
blacklisting for their failure to complete their delivery following the 

Uniform Guidelines for Blacklisting for Manufacturers, Suppliers, 

Distributors, Contractors, and Consultants of the 2016 Revised IRR 

of RA No. 9184; and 

 

l) the TWG and BAC to consider all factors such as financial 
capabilities, experience concerning the contract to be awarded, and 

exercise due diligence in evaluating the capacity and performance of 

participating bidder to prevent the awarding of contracts to 

unqualified suppliers, contractors or consultants. 

 

24.60 The Management’s comments as well as the Audit Team’s rejoinder are as 
follows: 

 
RO/SDO Management’s Comments Audit Team’s Rejoinder 

I (ROP) During the CYs 2019 and 2020, DepEd ROP has sent 

notice of termination of contracts to the contractors 

based on the amount of the undelivered TVL 

Equipment. The agency also takes the possibility of 

re-bidding the undelivered TVL Equipment. 

Management also commented that it would schedule 

a meeting with the Legal Unit to thoroughly discuss 

the concrete legal actions needed to be taken by 

DepEd ROP to comply with COA's recommendations. 

 

III (DO 

Pampanga) 

The Management already submitted the omitted 

supporting documents. They also apologized for the 

use of SVP instead of Competitive Bidding, thinking 

the time and urgency of the needs for the students. 

Moreover, Management promised to execute future 

contracts pursuant to the provisions of RA No. 9184 

and will prohibit splitting of procurement contracts. 

 

VIII 

(ROP) 

Management commented that they shall prepare 

demand letter requiring the contractor/supplier to 

submit the necessary lacking documents to 

substantiate the veracity  and reliability of the reported 

door-to-door deliveries of TVL tools and equipment 

made to the respective recipient schools. 

 



505 

 

RO/SDO Management’s Comments Audit Team’s Rejoinder 

XIII 

(ROP) 

The management agreed to designate a responsible 

officer or a committee from the RO to monitor the 

supplier’s compliance with contract agreement - the 

delivery term and the quality and quantity of items 

delivered, among others; and consolidate from time to 

time the inspection results of the TWG; and carefully 

assess the compliance of supplier and impose 

sanctions for violations of the contract such as 

termination of contract after incurrence of liquidated 

damages of more than 10 percent of the contract price 

and forfeiture of performance securities before its 

expiration. 

 

CAR During the Exit Conference, Management informed 

the Audit Team the following: 1) Program Owner and 

Legal Officer to process the termination of the 

contract of the three suppliers for undelivered TVL 

tools and equipment units; 2) Management will 

conduct meeting relative to the sanctions to be 

imposed; 3) the BAC and TWG to consider all factors 

relative to the bidding process and documents 

submitted by the bidders during the opening of bids, 

and 4) Program Owners to strictly monitor the 

implementation of the project relative to procurement 

and implementation of the program. However, 

Management informed that the validity of payables 

had reached their validity period, thus, they could not 

conduct another procurement process. 

The Audit Team commented that if the 

performance of these suppliers were monitored 

properly, their contract should have been 

terminated within the two-year validity period of 

payables and conduct of the procurement process 

was still possible. 

 

 

OTHER COMPLIANCE ISSUES 

 

Audit of Yolanda and Marawi Funds 

 

25. Funds received by DepEd CO/OSEC intended as financial aid to Typhoon 
Yolanda and Marawi Siege victims totaling ₱64,181,063.40 and ₱11,683,110.00, 

respectively, or a total of ₱75,864,173.40  remained unutilized as of December 31, 

2020, thereby defeating the very purpose of the donations and depriving the 

supposed beneficiaries of the maximum benefits that they may have derived from 

the financial assistance. 

 

25.1 Section 2 of RA No. 10121, otherwise known as the Philippine Disaster Risk 
Reduction and Management Act of 2010, provides that the State shall uphold 

the people's constitutional rights to life and property by addressing the root 

causes of vulnerabilities to disasters, strengthening the country's institutional 

capacity for disaster risk reduction and management and building the resilience 

of local communities to disasters including climate change impacts. It shall 

also engage the participation of civil society organizations (CSOs), the private 

sector and volunteers in the government's disaster risk reduction programs 

towards complementation of resources and effective delivery of services to the 

Citizenry. 

 



506 

 

25.2 In consonance with the enactment of RA No. 10121, COA Circular No. 2014-
002 dated April 15, 2014 provides for the accounting and reporting guidelines 

on the receipt and utilization of National Disaster Risk and Reduction and 

Management Fund (NDDRMF), cash and in-kind donations from local and 

foreign sources, and funds allocated from the agency regular budget for DRRM 

program. 

 

25.3 On donated funds, the said Circular requires that all unutilized cash donations 
after the purpose had been served shall be remitted to the BTr, if no condition 

to return any unused amount to the donor. 

 

25.4 Looking back, Typhoon Yolanda was one of the most powerful tropical 
cyclones ever recorded. On making its first landfall over Guiuan, Eastern 

Samar on November 8, 2013, it devastated primarily the Visayas Region killing 

at least 6,300 people in the country. 

 

25.5 On the other hand, the Marawi Siege was a five-month-long armed conflict in 
Marawi, Lanao del Sur that started on May 23, 2017, between Philippine 

government security forces and militants affiliated with the Islamic State of 

Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), including the Maute and Abu Sayyaf Salafi jihadist 

groups. 

 

25.6 Verification of the Report on the Receipt and Utilization of Cash Donations – 
Trust Account of DepEd CO/OSEC as of December 31, 2020 showed that a 

total of ₱75,864,173.40 remained unutilized as at yearend. Details are as

25.7 As can be gleaned from the data above, ₱64,181,063.40 Yolanda Funds and 
₱11,683,110.00 Marawi Funds remained not distributed and utilized, as of 

December 31, 2020. This condition deprived the victims of the calamities of 

the supposed benefits from these donated funds, and at the same time satisfying 

the primary intent of the donors of helping for humanitarian reasons. 



507 

 

 

25.8 On the other hand, as required by COA Circular No. 2014-002 dated April 15, 
2014, DepEd CO/OSEC may consider remitting the unused donated funds to 

BTr if the purpose or any plans and intentions to utilize the same had 

concluded. 

 

25.9 We recommended that Management: 
 

a) expedite the proper utilization of the remaining idle Typhoon Yolanda 
and Marawi funds for the intended beneficiaries or purpose; and  

 

b) remit to the BTr the unutilized funds if there are no plans to use such 
donated funds for the Typhoon Yolanda and Marawi Siege victims. 

 

25.10 The DepEd provided the following comments/updates: 
 

Typhoon Yolanda Donation 

 

25.11 The Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Service (DRRMS) is closely 
working with the Presidential Management Staff (PMS) on the completion of 

Socio-Civic Projects Fund (SCPF) of DepEd personnel affected by Typhoon 

Yolanda and the 2013 Bohol Earthquake. To date, there are two remaining field 

offices with unreleased Batch 2 SCPF second tranches. The SDO of Eastern 

Samar’s check for the Batch 2 SCPF second tranche is ready for pick-up at the 

Office of the President, while the SDO of Tacloban is currently undergoing site 

validation by the PMS Regional Field Unit. The DepEd through the DRRMS 

submitted a request to PMS for upgrading of assistance and inclusion of 

additional beneficiaries. As per PMS, the balance from the SCPF releases 

deposited in the DRRM Calamity Fund will be utilized for the said request upon 

the completion of release of the remaining Batch 2 SPCF tranches and 

submission of LRs of recipient field offices. 

 

25.12 Whereas, the remaining ₱1,395,921.72 deposited to the DepEd OSEC Trust 
Account for Typhoon Yolanda purposes from various donors shall be requested 

for the procurement of school furniture for Villa Engage Elementary School. 

 

Marawi Siege Donation 

 

25.13 The remaining ₱11,683,110.00 Marawi donation was proposed by DRRMS to 
be allocated for the rehabilitation and recovery of schools in Marawi City that 

were not included in the Bangon Marawi Comprehensive Rehabilitation and 

Recovery Plan (BM-CRRP) and remained unfunded. The ₱11,683,110.00 has 

been allocated for the construction of a two (2)-story four (4) classroom 

building and its necessary prerequisites (e.g., soil testing) in Timbangalan 

Primary School (PS) under the SDO of Marawi City, following the approval of 

the Secretary. 



508 

 

 

25.14 The completeness of the Deed of Donation and site ownership documents is 
currently being finalized in coordination with the SDO of Marawi City and the 

DepEd Sites Titling Office. Once these documents are completed, the funds 

shall be transferred to the SDO of Cotabato which will facilitate the 

procurement and construction. 

 

Gender and Development (GAD) 

 

26. For CY 2020, the implementation of Gender and Development (GAD) Programs 
in DepEd CO and various ROs and SDOs disclosed various deficiencies, such as: 

(a) non-submission of CY 2020 GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) as well as GAD 

Accomplishment Report (AR) to the Philippine Commission of Women (PCW) 

for review and endorsement to the DBM copy furnished the Audit Team; (b) non-

integration of at least five percent (5%) of Agency’s Budget to regular activities 

addressing gender issues;  (c) failure to administer and conduct gender analysis 

using the Harmonized Gender and Development Guidelines (HGDG) tool during 

the planning/budgeting phase for each major program/project/activity; and (d) 

non-utilization of the full amount of allocated budget as per GPB contrary to the 

pertinent provisions of COA Circular No. 2014-001 dated March 18, 2014, 

Section 31 of the General Provisions of the GAA for FY 2020 and the PCW-

National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA)-DBM Joint Circular 

(JC) No. 2012-01, thus, gender concerns and issues were not properly addressed 

and proper implementation and utilization of GAD programs, projects and 

activities for CY 2020 cannot be ascertained. 

 

26.1 Section 31 of the General Provisions of the GAA for FY 2020 or RA No. 11465  
provides that all agencies of the government shall formulate a GAD Plan 

designed to address gender issues within their concerned sectors or mandate 

and implement the applicable provisions under RA No. 9710 or the Magna 

Carta of Women (MCW), Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 

Discrimination Against Women, the Beijing Platform for Action, the 

Philippine Plan for Gender-Responsive Development (1995-2025) and the 

Philippine Development Plan (2017-2022). The GAD Plan shall be integrated 

in the regular activities of the agencies which shall be at least five percent (5%) 

of their budget appropriations, which is also required in Section 6.1 of JC No. 

2012-01 of PCW-NEDA-DBM effective January 2013. Utilization of GAD 

budget shall be evaluated based on the GAD performance indicators identified 

by the said agencies. 

 

26.2 Similarly, Annex A of JC No. 2012-01 provides the guidelines in completing 
the GPB template. It states that the primary consideration is the clearness of 

gender issue being addressed by the expense or activity and provides the 

sample list of expenses allowed and not allowed to be charged to the GAD 

Budget.  

 



509 

 

26.3 The same prescribes the guidelines and procedures for the preparation of 
annual GPB and the submission of the GPB duly reviewed by GAD Focal Point 

System (GFPS) to the PCW for review prior to the submission of the agency 

budget proposal to the DBM which served as the basis for implementing the 

GPB as well as for monitoring and reporting. Item 8.2 of the Joint Circular 

states that:   

 

“The GFPS of the agency shall review all submitted GPBs and as needed, 

provide comments or recommendations for revision. Agency review of GPBs 

shall focus on the alignment of the GAD plan with the GAD agenda and the 

correctness and alignment of the entries in each column of the GPB template, 

e.g. if the proposed activities respond to the identified gender issue or cause 

of the issue, the issues are correctly identified or formulated, if there are clear 

indicators and targets, if the propose budget is realistic, if the number of 

proposed activities are doable within the year, among others. The GFPS shall 

then submit the final GPBs and the corresponding GAD ARs to PCW for 

review and endorsement to DBM.” 

 
26.4 Also, Section 10 of the said Circular also states, among others, that: 

 

 Attached agencies, bureaus, regional offices, constituent units and all 
others concerned shall submit their GAD ARs to their central offices. 

The agency GFPS shall prepare the annual GAD AP based on the PCW 

– endorsed GPB or the GPB adjusted to the approved GAA following 

the form prescribed in Annex B. Activities completed until the end of 

the year may be included in the final GAD AR of agency submitted to 

the PCW in January. 

 

 The annual GAD AR shall be accompanied by the following: 1) brief 
summary of the reported program or project; 2) copies of reported policy 

issuances; 3) results of HGDG tests, if any; and 4) actions taken by the 

agency on the COA audit findings and recommendations, if any. 

 

 The PCW shall assess the actual accomplishments of agencies on GAD 
and prepare an annual integrated GAD AR for submission to Congress, 

and the Office of the President, copy furnished DBM and COA and all 

agencies that submitted GPBs and GAD ARs. 

 

26.5 In support thereto, DepEd Order No. 63, series 2012 dated June 20, 2012, 
establishes the guidelines in the preparation, review and endorsement of its 

GPB, its utilization, and the submission of the Accomplishment Report by the 

Department to PCW. It provides, among others, in detail the expenditures that 

can be charged in the GAD budget. 

 

26.6 Further, COA Circular No. 2014-001 dated March 18, 2014 provides the 
revised guidelines in the audit of GAD funds and activities in the government 



510 

 

agencies.  Specifically, Item C on the Audit of GAD Projects states that: (d) 

whether the GAD projects are in accordance with Harmonized Gender and 

Development Guidelines issued by the NEDA, the PCW and the Official 

Development Assistance Gender and Development Network.  Likewise, (g) in 

the evaluation of GAD projects, it shall be determined whether or not the 

gender issue identified has been fully addressed by the project implemented. 

 

26.7 On the other hand, PCW Memorandum Circular No. 2020-3 dated April 27, 
2020 provides the guidelines on the revision and/or implementation of the FY 

2020 GPB to implement GAD PAPs that address gender issues and concerns 

related to the COVID-19 situation: 
 

4.1 All national government agencies and instrumentalities are enjoined to review 

and revise, as necessary, their FY 2020 GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) to implement 

measures to address gender issues and concerns arising from the unequal status of 

their women and men stakeholders due to the COVID-19 situation. Such measures 

should be in line with their respective agency mandates, Republic Act No. 9710 or 

Magna Carta of Women and Bayanihan to Heal As One Act. Xxx 

 

4.2 The revision of the FY GPB should also be in line with the parameters set under 

NBC 580. GAD PAPs that fall under Section 4.3.1 of said policy shall be 

discontinued. 

 

4.3 The computation of the minimum five percent (5%) GAD budget as provided 

under Section 36(a) of the MCW shall be based on the total adjusted budget of the 

agency following the NBC No. 580. 

 

4.4 Agencies with FY 2020 GPB that has been endorsed or is still under review by 

PCW have an option to submit an adjusted GPB until July 1, 2020 for (re-) 

endorsement of PCW. Requests to reopen the access to the agency’s FY 2020 GPB 

submitted through Gender Mainstreaming  Monitoring System (GMMS) should be 

emailed to oed@pcw.gov.ph, copy furnished (cc) review.moderator@pcw.gov.ph 

and sysadmin@pcw.goc.ph. 

 

4.5 Agencies, whether with an endorsed or unendorsed GPB, shall reflect all changes 

made in the original FY 2020 GPB (e.g., cancellation/postponement of a GAD 

activity due to the Enhanced Community Quarantine or implementation of a new 

GAD activity to respond to the COVID-19 situation) in their GAD Accomplishment 

Report (GAD AR). Agencies shall also fill-out Column 10 of the GAD AR form to 

indicate deviations from the identified GAD activities and targets, if applicable. 

 

26.8 Review of compliance of DepEd CO together with the ROs on GAD related 
policies for CY 2020 revealed the following observations/deficiencies: 

 

a) Non-submission of CY 2020 GPB as well as GAD AR to the PCW for 
review, approval and endorsement to the DBM, copy furnished the Audit 

Team, and other related deficiencies 
 

mailto:oed@pcw.gov.ph
mailto:review.moderator@pcw.gov.ph
mailto:sysadmin@pcw.goc.ph


511 

 

26.9 Verification of the compliance with the abovementioned provision revealed 
that the submitted annual GPB, as well as the GAD AR during the year of the 

DepEd CO, could not be relied upon due to the failure of Management to 

present and endorse the same to the PCW; thus, prevented the Audit Team in 

establishing the propriety and accuracy of the reported GAD expenditures 

incurred including the activities undertaken that should fully address the gender 

issues. 

 

26.10 Summarized below are deficiencies of the DepEd CO and SDOs on the 
preparation and submission of the GPB and GAD AR and other related 

deficiencies:  
 

Table 57: Summary of Non-submission of GPB and GAD AR and Other Related Deficiencies 

Office/RO SDO/IU Deficiencies/Observations 

CO - The submitted annual GPB, as well as the GAD AR during the year, 

could not be relied upon due to the failure of Management to present and 

endorse the same to the PCW; thus, prevented the Audit Team in 

establishing the propriety and accuracy of the reported GAD 

expenditures incurred including the activities undertaken that should 

fully address the gender issues in accordance with the General Provisions 

of the GAA for FY 2020, and JC No. 2012-01. 

NCR ROP, Quezon 

City, Manila, 

Muntinlupa San 

Juan 

The submitted GAD ARs in NCR ROP, SDOs Manila, Quezon City and 

Muntinlupa were not supported with PCW)endorsed GPB contrary to 

Section 8.2 of JC No. 2012-01. 

 

For SDO San Juan, the annual GPB including the annual GAD AR of 

the Division included activities that were not intended for GAD PPAs. 

Moreover, the Management failed to develop or integrate into its existing 

database the GAD information that includes gender statistics and sex-

disaggregated data in the gender-responsive planning, programming, and 

policy formulation; hence, the objective of integrating into its programs, 

projects, and activities all its gender-related desired outcomes and goals 

are not fully achieved.  

CAR SDOs Baguio, 

Mt. Province, 

Ifugao, Benguet, 

Buguias NHS, 

Kibungan NHS 

Non-compliance to the provisions of JC No. 2012-01 resulted in the non-

attainment of GAD identified programs and activities.  

 

II SDO Batanes and 

three 

implementing 

units 

The GPB and the GAD AR  were not endorsed by the PCW; non-

submission of the GAD Plan and GAD AR to the Audit Team within the 

required period; and the 2020 GAD AR was prepared only upon the 

request of the Audit Team. 

III SDOs Aurora, 

Cabanatuan City, 

Gapan City, 

Nueva Ecija, 

Zambales, 

Science City of 

Munoz, San Jose 

City, Olongapo 

City 

In SDO Aurora, two Fiscally Autonomous Schools failed to submit 

Annual GPB and Annual GAD AR and  five Fiscally Autonomous 

Schools failed to submit Annual GAD AR for the year 2020 contrary to 

Section 31 of General Provisions of RA No. 11465, otherwise known as 

the GAA for FY 2020, thus precluding the Audit Team to conduct a 

timely audit of agency accounts and transactions. 

 

SDO Cabanatuan City formulated GPB and GAD AR and submitted to 

the RO for consolidation, however, no Consolidated GPB approved by 

the PCW was presented, thus, planned GAD programs and activities may 

not be within the context of the agency mandate and with the prepared 

GAD Agenda. 

 

SDOs Gapan City and Olongapo City failed to submit a GAD Plan and 

Budget and GAD AR, thus integration of GAD Plan in the regular 



512 

 

Office/RO SDO/IU Deficiencies/Observations 

activities of the Division Office of at least five percent of the budget 

could not be ascertained. 

 

Annual GPB  as well as the GAD AR of SDO Nueva Ecija were not 

submitted to the PCW, program and activities of the Non-Implementing 

Units were not properly identified in the GPB, and the same were not 

prepared by several Fiscally Autonomous Schools. 

 

SDOs Science City of Munoz and San Jose City formulated GPB and 

GAD AR, however, these were not submitted to PCW for review and 

approval, 

V Tabaco City, 

Camarines Sur, 

Sorsogon 

Province and City 

The GAD Accomplishments vis-a-vis targeted activities cannot be 

evaluated due to delayed submission of GPB and non-submission of 

GAD ARs contrary to COA Circular No. 2014-001 dated March 18, 

2014 and Section 31 of the General Provisions of RA No. 11465 or the 

GAA for FY 2020. 

The SDOs Sorsogon Province and City were not able to submit to the 

Audit Team for validation a PCW-approved and endorsed GPB within 

five working days upon its approval, hence, issues and concerns on GAD 

might not have been fully addressed. 

For SDO Camarines Sur,  the GAD AR for CY 2020 submitted was not 

accompanied by a brief summary of the reported program or project, 

copies of reported policy issuances, results of HGDG tests and actions 

taken by the agency on the COA audit findings and recommendations, 

inconsistent with the aforementioned regulations, thus resulted to poor 

monitoring and evaluation whether the gender issues and concerns were 

sufficiently addressed by the agency during the year. 

XI ROP, SDOs 

Davao de Oro, 

Mati City, Davao 

del Sur, Davao 

Oriental 

ROP, and the SDOs Davao de Oro, Mati City, Davao Del Sur and Davao 

Occidental failed to submit the GPB for CY 2020 and the GAD AR for 
the same year which are necessary in the evaluation of the School’s 
accomplishment against the targeted PAPs. 

XII Sultan Kudarat, 

Tacurong 

The SDOs failed to prepare and submit GPB and GAD AR contrary to 

DepEd Order No. 63, s.2012 dated June 20, 2012. 
XIII Tandag City, 

Surigao del Sur 

and SDS IUs  

Non-preparation and/or deficient GPB and GAD AR. 

 

 

26.11 Moreover, evaluation with the abovementioned provisions revealed that  SDOs 
Cebu Province, Talisay City, Tandag City and Surigao del Sur have not yet 

created GFPS that could have provided the Agencies the gender policies, 

programs and projects, the targeted beneficiaries and their needs flowing down 

to the assessment of the gender impact.  
 

b) Non-integration of at least five percent (5%) of Agency’s Budget to 
regular activities addressing gender issues. 

 

26.12 During the year, the following DepEd ROs had reported actual budget 
allocation which is below  the required five percent of their respective budget, 

to wit:

V Masbate City 527,669 ,000 240,450.00 0.05% 

 

26.13 Furthermore, RO III (SDO Tarlac City and 5 autonomous HS), RO IV-A 
(SDOs-Batangas City, Lipa City, Tanauan City, Bacoor City, Cavite Province, 

General Trias City, Cavite City, Imus City, Binan City, Laguna Province, 

Cabayao City, San Pablo City,  Quezon Province, Lucena City, Tayabas City), 

RO V (SDO Sorsogon Province), CAR (Conner Central NHS) were not able to 

fully utilize the full amount of allocated budget for GAD Plan activities. The 

allocation of GAD budget below the five percent minimum requirement as 

mandated by the GAA and MCW indicates a deficiency in GAD planning and 

inefficient integration of the GAD budget to the Agency’s major programs 

thereby restricting the enhancement of gender mainstreaming within the 

Agency. 
 

c) Failure to administer and conduct gender analysis using the HGDG tool 
during the planning/budgeting phase for each major program/project/ 

activity 
 

26.14 Section 3.4 of PCW-NEDA-DBM JC No. 2012-01 provides that to aid gender 
mainstreaming, agencies shall perform gender analysis using the existing tools, 

such as the HGDG, to ensure that the different concerns of women and men 

are addressed equally and equitably in their PPAs. Activities to address these 

differential concerns through capacity development on GAD or GAD-focused 

activities shall be included in agency GPBs. 
 

26.15 Section 6.4.4 of the same JC further states that during the preparation of its 
GAD AR, the agency will again administer the HGDG test to determine the 

extent that the targeted HGDG score is attained. This score will be the basis in 

determining actual expenditure that can be attributed to the GAD budget. 
 

26.16 Based on the submitted GAD reports of CAR and ROs V and X, the SDOs of 
Benguet, Albay, Ligao City, Masbate Province, Masbate City and Bukidnon 

have failed to conduct gender analysis using the required HGDG tool during 

the planning/budgeting phase for each major program/project/activities. Thus, 

gender concerns and issues were not properly addressed and the propriety of 

the reported GAD expenditures cannot be ascertained. The results of analysis 



514 

 

on the data that could have been collected may be used as bases in the 

preparation of the annual GAD plans and budgets and accomplishment reports. 
 

26.17 The foregoing deficiencies indicate non-compliance by the concerned offices 
with laws and rules and regulations on GAD. As a result, maximum 

implementation of GAD plans and programs and the areas that need 

improvement were not properly assessed and identified. Also, the effectiveness 

of the interventions implemented in addressing the gender issues towards the 

realization of the objectives of the country’s commitments, plans, and policies 

in women’s empowerment and gender equality cannot be ascertained. 

Likewise, GAD activities undertaken cannot be determined whether such 

expenditures were spent economically, efficiently and effectively in addressing 

GAD related issues and concerns. 

 

26.18 We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 

a) identify the gender issues and concerns in GAD Plans and prioritize 
the preparation and submission of the annual GPB to the PCW for 

review, approval and endorsement of the DBM in adherence to the 

aforesaid regulations and require submission thereof to the Audit 

Team/s within the required period under Item V of COA Circular No. 

2014-001 dated March 18, 2014; 

 

b) continue developing and implementing more GAD-related programs, 
projects and activities that will address gender issues and concerns not 

only of the Agency but also its clientele, properly 

allocating/attributing to five percent of its annual appropriations, and 

submit the same to the PCW for review and endorsement to DBM; 

and 

 

c) instruct the GFPS, otherwise create and establish the same in 
accordance with the MCW, to conduct gender analysis using the 

HGDG tool for each major program/project as well as to identify 

gender issues based on the result of gender audit, gender analysis or 

sex-disaggregated data. 

 

26.19 The following are the actions taken/to be taken by the Management: 
  

 Revise the activity design of the upcoming Gender Sensitivity Training 
(Capacity Building) to include strategical planning and workshop with 

CO units and field offices; 

 Work closely with the Planning Service on the development of the 
enhancement of the Program Management Information System (PMIS) in 

which GAD will be integrated; 

 Proposed collaboration with Planning Service in tagging GAD-related 
PAPs in the PMIS; 



515 

 

 Coordinated with PCW on the follow-up of the endorsement status of the 
submitted GPB 2020; and 

Finalize the collection and consolidation GAD ARs across governance 

level and submit to PCW by requesting access to the GMMS. 

 

Senior Citizens and Persons with Disability 

 

27. DepEd had partially complied with Section 32 of the General Provisions of RA 
No. 11465, or the GAA for FY 2020, mandating agencies of the government to 

formulate plans, programs and projects intended to address the concerns of 

senior citizens (SCs) and persons with disability (PWDs), insofar as it relates to 

their mandated functions, and integrate the same in their regular activities, in 

view of the deficiencies observed in DepEd ROPs and SDOs, such as: (a) non-

formulation  and submission of plans, programs and projects for SCs and PWDs 

and integration of the same in their regular activities; and (b) non-allocation of 

funds and non-implementation of projects and programs intended to address the 

concerns of SCs and PWDs in CY 2020, thus depriving the concerned  

beneficiaries of the benefits due them. 

 

27.1 All Filipino Citizens are protected and provided for by the Constitution. It seeks 
to ensure the well-being and safety of all its citizens, especially those who are 

considered part of the marginalized sectors like the SCs and PWDs. 

 

27.2 As such, in order to address the needs and concerns of SCs and PWDs, Section 
32 of the General Provisions of RA No. 11465, or the GAA for FY 2020, states 

that “All agencies of the government shall formulate plans, programs and 

projects intended to address the concerns of senior citizens and persons with 

disability, insofar as it relates to their mandated functions, and integrate the 

same in their regular activities. Moreover, all government infrastructure and 

facilities shall provide architectural or structural features, designs or facilities 

that will reasonably enhance the ability, safety and welfare of persons with 

disability pursuant to Batas Pambansa Blg. 344 and R.A. No. 7277, as 

amended.” 

 

27.3 Further, RA No. 7277, otherwise known as Magna Carta for Persons with 
Disability, as amended by RA No. 9442, provides privileges and incentives and 

specifies prohibitions against verbal, non-verbal ridicules and vilification to 

persons with disability. 

 

27.4 The granting of privileges and incentives to PWDs is aimed to enhance their 
health, physical fitness, economic and social well-being and their integration 

into mainstream society. 

 

27.5 Furthermore, disabled persons should be able to live freely and independently 
and should be able to enjoy the same rights and privileges as other people in 

order to take their proper place in society. The rehabilitation of the disabled 



516 

 

persons shall be the concern of the Government in order to foster their 

capability to attain meaningful, productive and satisfying life. 

 

27.6 Evaluation and verification disclosed that only DepEd CO, ROs III and 10 
SDOs, VI, VII, six SDOs of RO X, XII, XIII and three SDOs in NCR, have 

conducted programs and projects, in compliance with the provision of RA No. 

11465 or the GAA for FY 2020. These programs and projects include seminars 

and programs which promote empowering employees after retirement, 

programs which promote public awareness on various issues on disability, 

health and wellness programs, and disability awareness webinars. Furthermore, 

the Department immediately started drafting guidelines for the work 

arrangements in DepEd during the period of national emergency due to the 

pandemic, institutionalization of Special Education (SPED) Program in various 

schools to provide access to basic education among learners with special kids, 

and maintain facilities such as designated comfort rooms, ramps, wheelchairs 

and priority lanes for the SCs and PWDs. 

 

27.7 For ROs V and XI, it was noted that although they were unable to allocate 
funds and implement programs and projects concerning the welfare of the SCs 

and PWDs for CY 2020, the Management continued the implementation of 

programs and provision of physical facilities to address the concerns of said 

persons, in consonance with the aforementioned provisions of the GAA.  

 

27.8 On the other hand, NCR ROP and nine of its SDOs and one SDO of RO X have 
no plans and program for senior citizens and PWDs; while one SDO of RO X 

and XII have no plans and program for SCs; and three SDOs of NCR have no 

plans and program for PWDs, thus the needs and concerns of these individuals 

were not properly addressed. In addition, RO I, two SDOs of RO III, one SDO 

of RO V and ROP of RO X have not submitted their plans and programs for 

senior citizens and differently abled persons. Moreover, three SDOs of RO III, 

RO IV-B and CAR have failed to allocate funds and implement projects and 

programs intended to address the concerns of senior citizens and persons with 

disability in CY 2020. 

 

27.9 In addition to compliance with the General Provisions of RA No. 11465, three 
SDOs of RO III complied with the Joint Circular No. 2003-01 dated April 28, 

2003 while three of its SDOs are not compliant. 

 

27.10 Consequently, the foregoing observations have deprived the prospective 
beneficiaries of the benefits due them as the concerns of SC and PWD may not 

be addressed. 

 

 

 

 



517 

 

27.11 We recommended and Management agreed to ensure that all DepEd 
offices: 

 

a) formulate plans and programs intended to address the concerns of SCs 
and PWDs pursuant to the annual General Provisions of the GAA 

which shall be integrated in the regular activities of the agencies; 

 

b) allocate funds and integrate the implementation of the programs in the 
regular activities and provide structural designs and features in the 

office facilities that will enhance the mobility, safety and welfare of 

PWDs; and  

 

c) designate a focal person or establish a focal committee that will work 
on formulating and conducting activities of SCs and PWDs. 

 

27.12 The Management’s comments are as follows: 
 

Region Management’s Comments 

NCR In a letter dated April 5, 2021 of RO, the Management informed the Audit 

Team of Office Memorandum No. ROP-2020-084 dated October 9, 2020, 

issued to Security Officers thru Mr. Rommel M. Villareal to assign one of 

the janitors to extend assistance to clients with disabilities and senior 

citizens who are having mobility difficulty by ushering them to the 

concerned office, when necessary, assistance in using a wheelchair. 

III The Management fully agreed with the observations and stated they will 

continue to implement programs and activities to support the Senior Citizens 

and Persons with Disability. 

 

Compliance with RA No. 656, otherwise known as the Property Insurance Law 

 

28. Government properties with an aggregate cost of ₱33,398,845,324.51 located in 
10 ROs of DepEd were not provided with insurance coverage as required under 

RA No. 656, as amended by PD No. 245, thus, exposing them to unnecessary losses 

in the event of damage to, or loss of, their properties due to fire, earthquake, 

storm, or other casualties. Furthermore, non-submission of Property Inventory 

Form (PIF) in six ROs - NCR, I, II, IV-B, VI, and X as required under COA 

Circular No. 2018-002 resulted in non-verification of the completeness of the 

Agency’s insurance coverage for its insurable assets. 

 

28.1 It has been observed in recent years that weather conditions in the Philippines 
have drastically changed due to global warming. As a consequence, typhoons 

and floods continue to increase and become more frequent. Earthquake 

continues to be a risk that the country also has to face. Different catastrophic 

perils either damage or destroy the school structures and other properties that 

are important education resources for the students, hence, the need to protect 

these school structures and properties.  

 



518 

 

28.2 In order to indemnify or compensate the Government for any damage to, or 
loss of its properties due to fire, earthquake, storm, or other casualties, the 

Property Insurance Fund (PIF) was established under Section 2 of RA No. 656, 

otherwise known as the Property Insurance Law, as amended by PD No. 245 

dated July 13, 1973, requiring all government agencies (except municipal 

governments below the first-class category) to insure against any insurable risk 

their properties, assets, and interests with the General Insurance Fund (GIF) of 

the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS). 

 

28.3 Section 3.1 of COA Circular No. 92-390 dated November 17, 1992 provides 
that, all heads of national agencies, local government units and government 

owned or controlled corporations shall be responsible for the preparation and 

submission of the inventory of all insurable physical assets; while, Section 3.2 

thereof requires submission of said inventory report to the GSIS not later than 

October 31 of the ensuing year.  

 

28.4 In addition, COA Circular No. 2018-002 dated May 31, 2018  requires the 
Heads of government agencies to direct the pertinent official under his/her 

supervision to: a) prepare the PIF listing of all the insurable properties and other 

assets, showing their latest appraised values/valuation, appraisal date, location 

and other information and submit the same to the Supervising Auditor/Audit 

Team Leader and the GIF, GSIS not later than April 30 of each year; b) include 

in the agency annual budget the amount of premiums for the general insurance; 

and  c) ensure centralized payment of insurance premiums of all 

assets/property. 

 
28.5 Properties in 10 DepEd ROs with an aggregate amount of ₱33,398,845,324.51 

were not provided with GSIS insurance coverage, contrary to RA No. 656 or 

the Property Insurance Law. Details are as follows:

28.6 On the other hand, closer examination of the observed gaps indicated some root 
causes such as: 

 

Region SDO Deficiencies/Errors 

NCR ROP 

Manila 

The completeness of the existing insurance coverage could 

not be ascertained due to the failure of the Management of 

DepEd NCR to submit the accomplished PIF as used by the 

GSIS in its assessment of general insurance coverage of the 

Agency’s insured assets, as required under Section 5 of COA 

Circular No. 2018-002 dated May 31, 2018. 

I  a. Inability of the Management to provide annual provision 
for insurance premiums for all insurable properties; 

b. Non-preparation of the PIF; 
c. Funds to cover insurance premiums not provided by the 

ROs; 

d. Non-compliance with the requirements of the GSIS with 
respect to the preparation of building specifications and 

building/floorplan/office layout; and 

e. Non-conduct of physical inventory for insurable assets. 

II  Updated PIF of SDO Batanes was not submitted to the 

Office of the Auditor, as required in the above provisions of 

COA Circular 2018-002 dated May 31, 2018. 

IV-B 

 

Marinduque The non-preparation and non-submission of the accurate and 

updated PIF to the Regional/Central Office for CY 2020 

resulted in the non-inclusion of the amount of premiums for 

the general insurance of all insurable properties to the GIF 

of the GSIS in the annual budget. 

VI  a. Non-provision for insurance premiums for all insurable 
assets in the budget; 

b. Non-conduct of complete physical inventory of existing 
properties of the Division; 

c. Incomplete data of the National School Building 
Inventory Report (NSBI), e.g., the historical cost of 

Buildings and Other Structures were not provided; and 

d. Non-preparation of the PIF. 

X Cagayan de Oro Payments of annual registration and insurance premiums of 

government vehicles which were not owned by the Division 

El Salvador Non submission of PIF 

Malaybalay City a. Non submission of PIF 
b. Absence of budget allocation for the insurance premiums 

Valencia City a. Non submission of PIF 
b. Absence of budget allocation for the insurance premiums 

Ozamiz City Absence of budget allocation for the insurance premiums 

 

28.7 The absence of insurance coverage with the GIF of the GSIS denies the 
government of adequate and reliable protection against any damage or loss of 

government properties due to fire, theft, force majeure, and the like. Also, 

failure to secure insurance deprives the GSIS of substantial premium income 

that should have formed part of the GIF. 

 

28.8 Nevertheless, it is noteworthy to mention that DepEd RO No. XIII has insured 
its government property with GSIS pursuant to Section 5 of RA No.656. The 

Management had submitted Policy ID 8000521243 with an insurable amount 



520 

 

of ₱69,541,313.55 applicable for the period covering February 21, 2020 to 

February 21, 2021 insuring the Agency’s buildings and contents thereof. 

 

28.9 We recommended that Management: 
 

a) require the Supply/Property Officer to prepare the PIF listing of all 
the insurable properties showing their latest appraised 

values/valuation, acquisition date, location, and other information and 

submit the same to the Office of the Audit Team Leader and the GSIS 

not later than April 30 each year as prescribed under COA Circular 

No. 2018-002 dated May 31, 2018;  

 

b) strictly comply with the RA No. 656 or the Property Insurance Law;  
 

c) coordinate with concerned Office in evaluating the ownership of the 
vehicles assigned to the SDO Cagayan de Oro and comply with the 

necessary documents regarding property transfer, if warranted; and  

 

d) provide a yearly budget for the insurance premiums of their insurable 
properties. 

 

28.10 The Management’s comments are shown below: 
 

Region SDO Management Comments 

NCR Caloocan The SDS in her letter dated March 10, 2021 stated that they 

already sent a request letter dated March 9, 2021 to the DepEd 

CO seeking their expertise and assistance on the matter. 

Likewise, the Management submitted a Consolidated PIF to the 

GSIS as basis for assessing the insurance premiums. Once 

assessed by the GSIS, the SDO will request from DepEd CO an 

allotment to cover for the premium. Copy of Consolidated PIF 

was also submitted to the Audit Team. 

Valenzuela Management replied that after their physical inventory of the 

Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) last March 8 to 16, 2021, 

the SDO is currently in the process of cleansing and consolidating 

all of their insurable assets per classification and will submit the 

said report to the Budget Section in order to allocate an amount 

for insurance premiums in the Agency’s yearly budget. 

The Supply Officer and School Property Custodians already 

prepared an inventory list of all its insurable assets/properties and 

furnished the GIF to the GSIS in order to ensure compensation of 

the equivalent value thereof in case of loss or damage. 

Malabon The Supply Officer and School Property Custodians already 

prepared an inventory list of all its insurable assets/properties and 

furnished the GIF to the GSIS in order to ensure compensation of 

the equivalent value thereof in case of loss or damage. 

All concerned School Property Custodians and the Division 

Property Officer have already furnished a copy of all insurable 

assets to the Office of the Schools Division Superintendent and 

Budget Officer to allocate an amount for the insurance of all 

assets in the Agency’s yearly budget. 



521 

 

Region SDO Management Comments 

CAR  The Management of the RO informed that their budget for 

insurance is for motor vehicles only.  However, they will try to 

include the budget for the insurance of buildings in the 2022 

proposed budget of DepEd CAR RO. 

X Cagayan de 

Oro City 

Management replied that this will not be an issue anymore 

because they have decided to return the two (2) old vehicles to 

the City Government, as the Division has already incurred a 

substantial amount for repairs and maintenance. They also 

believed that those vehicles have already served its purpose. 

Ozamiz City Due to the constraints in funds, the Agency has only so far insured 

it Office Building and all its contents and vehicles issued to it 

from the Central Office. Furthermore, for the Implementing 

Units, some of the properties were insured for management 

prioritized those that they assess as needed to be insured to utilize 

the scarce funds. However, these were not submitted to this 

office. The School Heads will look into the matter and coordinate 

for funding. 

Tangub City With the putting up of the GSIS one stop shop, management will 

hopefully come up with the list of insurable properties of the 

Division Office. The Supply Officer of the implementing unit 

created a committee that is responsible in conducting actual 

physical count and inventory of all insurable assets. Also, the new 

Bookkeeper is currently coordinating with the RO for the funding 

requirements of all insurable assets. 

 

Compliance with Taxation Laws 
 

29. For CY 2020, the DepEd substantially complied with the revenue regulations on 
withholding of Income Tax on Compensation and procurement of services, and 

the subsequent remittance thereof pursuant to Revenue Regulation No. 10-2008 

dated July 8, 2008. However, weaknesses in the controls were observed as the 

account still showed unremitted taxes amounting ₱561,639,760.02 and other 

deficiencies with regard to compliance with BIR regulations. 
 

29.1 Revenue Regulations No. 10-2008 dated July 08, 2008 provides the pertinent 
provisions relative to the withholding of income taxes on compensation while 

Revenue Memorandum Circular No.  23-2007 dated March 20, 2007 provides 

clarifications on the computations of withholding taxes and other requirements 

on government money payments due or payable to suppliers of goods and/or 

services. 
 

29.2 Revenue Regulations No. 1-2013 dated January 23, 2013 provides that “The 
filing of return and payment of tax due should be on or before the 10th day 

following the month in which withholding was made, except for taxes withheld 

for the month of December of each year, which shall be filed on or before 

January 15 of the succeeding year.” 
 

29.3 The DepEd Offices substantially complied with the revenue regulations on 
withholding of taxes on salaries, benefits, and procurement of goods and 

services and the subsequent remittance thereof. However, there is still 



522 

 

unremitted taxes as of December 31, 2020 of ₱561,639,760.02, details are 

shown below:

revenue regulations in different ROs: 

 
Observations/Deficiencies on Compliance with BIR Regulations 

RO SDO Audit Observations/Deficiencies Noted 

Non-withholding of tax 

CAR  The non-withholding of taxes on purchase of goods and services 

amounting ₱17,120.94 and the non-remittance of taxes withheld within 

the reglementary period to the BIR totaling P1,269,808.20 may result to 

the incurrence of penalties and surcharges.

withholding tax contrary to RA No. 10963 otherwise known as Tax 

Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion (TRAIN) Act of 2017 and

I Ilocos 

Norte 

Post audit revealed that payments were made without withholding the 

mandatory taxes: Creditable income tax (3%) and Tax on government 

money payments (1% or 2%) from the total amount of the transactions. 

Pangasinan 

I 

The SDO Pangasinan I Proper and Mangatarem NHS incurred delays in 

the remittance of taxes withheld on the employees’ compensation and 

on procurement of goods and services totaling ₱865,647.50, hence, not 

in accordance with Section 114C of the 1997 National Internal Revenue 

Code (NIRC). 

Under/Over-remittance of Taxes 

CO  Prior years’ transactions showed an under-remittance of ₱9,437,816.17.  

NCR ROP ROP also noted that Agency incurred a net over-remittance of 

₱101,163.48, attributed from various errors and omission of recording 

in the books. 

Incomplete Documentation 

NCR ROP Failure to attach copies of the Tax Remittance Advice (TRA), BIR eFPS 

remittance slip/confirmation slip, and tax returns [BIR Forms (BIR 

Form 1601-C, 1601-E, 1601-F and 1600, respectively)] to support the 

JEVs made during the year totaling ₱10,772,366.45, which prevented 

the Audit Team to verify the reliability of the amounts remitted and its 

compliance with the statutory deadlines/requirements. 

 

29.5 Taking into account the gaps observed in the preceding table, it now becomes 
a necessity for the Department to enhance the uptake of its offices of the 

importance of compliance with the tax laws and regulations, and to improve 

the related control mechanisms so that the Department can improve its level of 

compliance to said law and BIR regulations, thereby avoiding unnecessary 

risks of legal sanctions and inefficiency. 
 

29.6 We recommended that Management: 
 

a) strictly enforce remittance of taxes withheld within the prescribed 
period as provided by the law; 

 

b) withhold taxes from government money payments pursuant to 
Revenue Regulations No. 2-98 as amended; 

 

c) coordinate with the BIR on the proper action to be taken of file a claim 
for refund or issuance of a tax credit certificate, whichever is 

applicable, for the over-remittances incurred in CY 2019 and 2020, 

following the procedures prescribed in Section 204(c) of the NIRC of 

the Tax Code;  

 

d) submit to the Audit Team of ROP of DepEd NCR the complete 
documents on the remittances of withholding taxes for CY 2020 and 

the succeeding years; and 

 

e) review and reconcile prior years’ under/over remittances balance and 
effect the necessary adjustment or remittance, whichever is 

appropriate.

29.7 Management provided the following comments and explanations: 
 

RO Management’s Comments 

CAR Management acknowledged the audit observation and committed to remit the 

outstanding balance to the BIR. 

NCR In a letter dated March 01, 2021, the ROP Management commented that the Due 

to BIR account balance as of December 31, 2020 of ₱10,389,414.28 is part of the 

tax remitted for December 31, 2020, which was recorded in January 2021 in 

compliance with AOM No. 2020-015(2019) issued last June 15, 2020. 

 

The Management of SDO-Pasig commented in their letter dated April 05, 2021, 

that they will require the Accounting Unit to promptly remit to the BIR the taxes 

withheld by the Division within the prescribed due dates to avoid the payment of 

surcharges and penalties. 

I Concerned officials assured that they will comply with the BIR Revenue 

Memorandum Order No. 23-2014 and Section 4, 114-2 of RR No. 13-2018 and 

withhold the taxes properly. 

II Management instructed the Accountant to remind the schools on the withholding 

of taxes on all procurement of goods and services. SDO Isabela already provided 

technical assistance to school bookkeepers/ADAS of non-implementing units last 

January 25, 2021 and March 3, 2021.  

 

Compliance with GSIS Law 
 

30. Premium contributions and/or loan amortizations totaling ₱4,363,234,199.87 
deducted from salaries of teaching and non-teaching personnel of CO and 15 ROs 

remained unremitted as at December 31, 2020, exposing the concerned personnel 

to penalties/interest that could result in undue limitations in enjoying privileges 

and benefits conferred under the GSIS law. 
 

30.1 RA No. 8291 or the GSIS Act of 1997 provides for the following relevant 
provisions: 

 

a. Section 6(a) – The employer shall report to the GSIS the names of 
all its employees, their corresponding employment status, positions, 

salaries and such other pertinent information, including subsequent 

changes therein, if any, as may be required by the GSIS; the employer shall 

deduct each month from the monthly salary or compensation of each 

employee the contribution payable by him in accordance with the schedule 

prescribed in the rules and regulations implementing this Act; 

 

b. Section 6(b) – Each employer shall remit directly to the GSIS the 
employees’ and employers’ contributions within the first ten (10) days of 

the calendar month following the month to which the contributions apply. 

The remittance by the employer of the contributions to the GSIS shall take 

priority over and above the payment of any and all obligations, except 

salaries and wages of its employees; and,  

 



525 

 

c. Section 7 – Interests on delayed remittances shall be charged on 
Agencies which delay the remittance of any and all monies due to the GSIS 

as may be prescribed by the Board but not less than two percent (2%) simple 

interest per month. 

 

30.2 Furthermore, as a result of the existence of National Emergency arising from 
the COVID-19, the DBM Budget Circular No. 2020-06 dated March 30, 2020 

was issued stating that starting April 2020, the DBM will directly remit to the 

GSIS the government share in the RLIP contribution for departments, bureaus 

and offices of the national government. 

 

30.3 As of December 31, 2020, deductions from the salaries of teaching and non-
teaching personnel of DepEd Offices for the GSIS premiums and loan

30.4 Audit of the deductions and remittances of GSIS premiums and loan 
amortizations deducted from salaries of personnel revealed the following 

deficiencies: 
 

Office/RO Other Deficiencies 

CO The balance of ₱2,078,780.53 pertains to CYs 2016-2019 unremitted balance 

of GSIS from salary voucher claims mainly deductions of newly-hired 

employees and salary adjustments of existing employees arising from 

promotions, step increments and the effectivity of Salary Standardization 

Law (SSL), which were not included in the monthly master list of balances 

due for remittance 



526 

 

Office/RO Other Deficiencies 

NCR The Audit Team of SDO Caloocan reported that the SDO Proper had incurred 

a net over remittance of ₱5,823.90, and adjustments totaling ₱206,935.96. 

 

In three SDOs, part of the causes of unremitted account pertains to the prior 

year unremitted balances to GSIS. 

CAR The GSIS contributions and loan repayments that were deducted from 

payrolls from 2017 to 2019 remained unremitted due to discrepancies in the 

personal information of affected employees. 

 

In Kalinga NHS, Tabuk City NHS, TNHS, the GSIS monthly premiums and 

loan amortizations withheld from the salaries of personnel for CY 2020 were 

not remitted within the prescribed. 

III The reliability and accuracy of the Due to GSIS account under the Regular 

Fund of the RO III Proper (ROP) with negative balances of ₱147,368.73 as 

of yearend cannot be ascertained due to failure of the Accounting Unit to 

justify the cause of the abnormal balances of these accounts. 

 

On the other hand, the Due to GSIS accounts under the Trust Fund of the 

ROP with ending balances of ₱309,794,021.18 remained non-moving since 

December 31, 2019. Details of the accounts are not available as well upon 

inquiry with the Accounting Unit. 

IV-B In Division of Calapan City, the GSIS Employees’ contributions and 

government shares for the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) and Employees’ 

Compensation Insurance Fund (ECIF) totaling ₱1,237,527.02 remained 

unremitted as of December 31, 2020, contrary to RA No. 8291 thus, may be 

subjected to the interests and penalties and may affect the privileges and 

benefits redounding to the member-employees. 

VI The balance of ₱2,788,814,693.66 of ROP pertains to yearend transactions 

for remittance in the first quarter of 2021 and monthly accumulation of 

differences from remitted amount vis-a-vis monthly billing from its Regional 

Payroll Services Unit. 

VIII The unremitted balance of SDO Samar was due to the difference between the 

total GSIS billing and payroll deductions indicating the absence of reconciled 

data between the employee records of the agency and GSIS billings. 

X ROP - GSIS Loans totaling P854,876,039.23 remained undeducted and 

unremitted as of December 31, 2020, in spite of the order of priority of 

Authorized Deductions provided in Section 47 of the General Provisions of 

the FY 2020 GAA and the existence of DepEd Agency Authorized Officers 

and Verifiers who certify sufficiency of Net Take Home Pay and confirm 

loan eligibility of DepEd borrowers, thereby increasing risk of default and 

consequently resulting to paying interests and penalties by the borrower-

employees, and ultimately become ineligible in availing annual dividends 

and be deprived of the retirement benefits upon separation from service. 

XI SDO-Davao Del Sur - Payment of Government Share in Retirement Life 

Insurance Premium (RLIP) for the month of July 2020  and months April and 

May for the Division of Digos City, with aggregate amount of 

P13,814,618.07 were made despite absence of allotments and availability of 

funds contrary to Section 40 of Chapter 5 Book VI of EO 292 and DBM 

Circular Letter No. 2020-6, thus resulting in illegal payments/double 

remittances in the same amount, which are disallowable in audit and grossly 

and manifestly disadvantageous to the Government. 

XIII Tabon M. Estrella NHS of SDO-Bislig City Due to GSIS account disclosed 

an amount of ₱260,486.28 which was non-moving for over five (5) years 

while the Division Office of Tandag City showed an unremitted amount of 



527 

 

Office/RO Other Deficiencies 

₱818,774.84. The validity of these amounts could not be substantiated due to 

non-maintenance of individual employee’s ledger cards and absence of any 

disclosure of facts and/or details in the Notes to Financial Statements, thus 

rendering the Due to GSIS account of both Division Offices unreliable.  

 

30.5 We recommended that Management to: 
 

a)  direct the Accountant and the responsible personnel to reconcile the 
Due to GSIS account and remit all premium contributions, loan 

payments and/or remittances to the GSIS within the timelines set to 

avoid penalties/interests, the effects of non-remittance of contributions 

such as suspension of loan privileges and the disqualification to receive 

yearly dividends, to avail of the benefits these agencies have to offer 

and sanctions to be imposed on employees responsible for the non-

remittance thereof;  

 

b) require the concerned personnel to maintain subsidiary records of 
members for proper monitoring and supporting of the Due to GSIS 
account; and 

 

c) submit a written/explanation/justification on why the remittances 
were made to GSIS despite absence of Allotments and corresponding 

NCA, and why these should not be disallowed in audit (RO XI – SDOs 

Digos City and Davao del Sur). 

 

30.6 The Management commented as follows: 
 

Office/RO SDO/IU Management Comments 

CO  The Management commented that they are exerting earnest efforts 
to implement the recommendations proposed by the Audit Team 

thru the coordination of its concerned offices.  

 

They also has initiated programs and measures that will improve 

the accuracy of remitting contributions and deductions, and lessen 

the discrepancies and possible errors that might be encountered in 

remitting GSIS contributions. 

NCR ROP and 
Caloocan 

Management commented that it has already made and is 

continuously undergoing reconciliation of account Due to GSIS 

prioritizing the year 2020 to present to avoid further accumulation 

of the unpaid remittances. Furthermore, the remittances for 2020 

up to present have already been remitted within the timeline and in 

accordance with provisions of RA No. 8291 or the GSIS Act of 

1997. 

 

Likewise, the discrepancies noted on the remittances in prior years 

have been due to un-updated personnel records under the GSIS, 

which is due to the failure in real-time updating of records thru 

Agency Remittance Advice (ARA). 

 



528 

 

Office/RO SDO/IU Management Comments 

A mechanism has already been set in place to ensure that the 

records are being updated with GSIS simultaneously with any 

changes on the record within the agency from 2020 onwards to 

avoid further accumulation of discrepancies. 

 

The SDS of SDO-Caloocan, thru the Division Accountant, 

commented that the latter stated that per inquiry with the Payroll 

Unit, they have always been aware of the employees who are 

subject to clarifications with the GSIS; thus, their remittances are 

not being accepted by the eBCS. The Unit will have to prepare 

payroll for refund or ARA for GSIS. 
CAR ROP The Supervising Administrative Officer, Administrative Division, 

and In-Charged of the RPSU disclosed that they have been sending 

communications to the different SDOs concerning the deficiencies 

of personnel under their jurisdiction. Also, the RPSU immediately 

remits the GSIS contributions and loan of the personnel with 

deficiencies noted by GSIS and HDMF once they have 

accomplished the necessary documents. A monthly report would 

be submitted on the progress of the remittance of these GSIS and 

HDMF contributions and loan amortizations, which were not 

remitted as of December 31, 2020. 
I ROP, 

Pangasinan 

I and 

Vigan City 

Management commented that it has already remitted 

₱13,115,961.59 on January 2021, while the check of P100.00 for 

the ECIP of one employee was already prepared. DepEd ROP's 

Administrative Division has already coordinated and asked the 

assistance of GSIS for the uploading of remittances to their system 

with regard to the stale checks. The outstanding balance of 

₱29,154,047.80 represents the RO No. I Proper's unremitted 

deductions in 2017 and the supplementary payrolls of RPSU paid 

employees in 2010, 2012, and 2014. The Accounting Section and 

RPSU are currently retrieving files and preparing working papers 

for the breakdown of those supplementary payrolls. The ROP is 

having difficulty in remitting the prior years’ contributions due to 

the upgraded system of GSIS. The Management is looking into the 

possibility of transferring the fund and responsibility to the SDOs 

to remit. The division office has assigned an Electronic Remittance 

File (ERF) handler who is in-charge in uploading the remittance 

list and has direct access to the updating of membership records 

through Agency Remitting Advice (ARA), which is a requirement 

for the payment. Rest assured that the Management will exert its 

effort to remit all contributions and loan repayments immediately 

due to GSIS. 

 

The Management of SDO Vigan City ensure that they will give 

preferential attention to this matter and the remittances will be 

remitted to the concerned office the soonest possible time 
II Nueva 

Vizcaya 

Management is constantly coordinating with GSIS Bayombong in 

order to remit the GSIS Premiums of Employees who are mostly 

Provisional Teachers, newly hired and reinstated employees. They 

have designated additional employee to fast track the remittance of 

this GSIS with a target to fully diminish the said remittances as 

soon as possible. 

III ROP The Management of ROP commented, thru their letter dated 

February 17, 2021, that the subject unreliable balance of Due to 

GSIS account under the regular fund book have been analyzed and 



529 

 

Office/RO SDO/IU Management Comments 

that the corresponding adjusting journal entries are being prepared 

and will be recorded, accordingly. 

IV-B Calapan 

City 

The Division Office of Calapan City commented that proper 

obligation had been taken up for the government share (SIF) and 

ECIP for 2017-2019. In 2020, the allotment for the RLIP was taken 

back by the DBM who was paying for the RLIP. Unobligated RLIP 

for 2020 shall be taken up this year. The Management is also in 

constant dialogue with the GSIS representatives for the updating 

of ERF. 

V Albay 

Province, 

Naga City 

and 

Sorsogon 

Province 

 

The Management of DepEd Albay Province stated that the delayed 

remittance of GSIS premiums and contributions was of without 

intention on the part of the agency to compromise the loan 

applications of its personnel nor to deprive the government of the 

use of the funds. The complexity and bulk of the transactions of 

the agency vis-a-vis the late receipt of billings for employees’ loan 

has contributed to the issue. 

 

Through the Cashier of Naga City, the Management explained that:  

 

The unremitted amount corresponds to the contributions of those 

teachers whose names are not yet included in the GSIS Electronic 

Billing and Collection System, wherein they can only remit the 

contributions upon their inclusion to the system. 

 

They will review/analyze thoroughly the transactions involving the 

balance of the GSIS account and reconcile with the accounting 

records so that appropriate adjustments can be made. 

 

They will remit any reconciled balance to GSIS without further 

delay as soon as Business Partner (BP#) become available and data 

in the GSIS are already adjusted. 

 

In Sorsogon Province, management commented that they have 

instructed the Electronic Remittance File (ERF) Handlers and 

Agency Authorized Officers (AAOs) together with their respective 

supervisors and reiterated the value of timely remittance and their 

accountabilities being the responsible persons in charge of 

generating the Electronic Remittance File (ERF) thru GSIS – 

Electric Billing and Collection System (EBCS). Also, 

Management deployed an additional staff to reinforce the present 

manpower in charge of GSIS concerns in solving the issue. 

X ROP Management commented, and we quote: 

 

 “It is informed that starting November 2018 up to this point in 

time, the deduction for GSIS loans and contribution and HDMF 

remittances is made a priority deduction in the Department’s 

payroll system to eliminate the possibility of undeducted 

obligations. However, in instances when an employee incurs 

absences without pay, the amount equivalent to the number of days 

absent is deducted first from the salary before the deduction of 

GSIS Loans. This raises an issue if the Net Take Home Pay 

(NTHP) of the employee is reduced to Five Thousand Pesos 

(P5,000.00) only. In accordance to law, no deduction further is 

allowed from the employees’ salary.

Office/RO SDO/IU Management Comments 

XI Digos City 

and Davao 

Del Sur 

In SDO-Digos City, the Management admitted the inadvertent 

inclusion of the Government Share in  the  remittance and assured 

the Audit Team to communicate the matter with GSIS for the 

appropriate actions to be taken. 

 

Per letter-reply of SDO-Davao Del Sur dated March  10,  2021, the  

previous Bookkeeper explained that she was not aware of the DBM 

Circular Letter No. 2020-6 dated March 30, 2020 when she 

replaced the previous Accountant. Also, the GSIS Division-in-

Charge did not notify her regarding the  matter. Nevertheless, they 

communicated the matter with the GSIS and as of to date, resolving 

the matter is still on process.

31.6 Other deficiencies in CO and four ROs were also noted as follows: 
 

RO SDO Deficiencies/Observations 

NCR Caloocan Analysis of the account conducted by the Audit Team revealed an abnormal 

balance or negative balance of ₱875,478.00 in the books of SDO-Caloocan. 

Interview with the SDO Accountant disclosed that in compliance with the 

Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of Section 4 (aa) of the Bayanihan 

1, loan repayments of April and May 2020 of Secondary and Elementary School 

teachers totaling ₱875,478.00 were refunded. Relative thereto, JEVs were 

drawn debiting or reversing the entry made in setting up payables to Pag-IBIG. 

However, despite having refunded the amount withheld, the same was still 

remitted to the Pag-IBIG. Again, JEVs were drawn debiting for the second time 

the account Due to Pag-IBIG, thus resulted in a negative abnormal balance of 

₱875,478.00 at yearend. 

 

Moreover, an under/over remittance in the contributions/premiums of three 

Implementing Units (IU) under SDO-Caloocan has been noted, thus resulted in 

a net under remittance of ₱11,300.00 during the year. There was also noted 

under remittance in Bagong Silang High School for the loan repayments 

totaling ₱615.94. 

III  RO III Proper (ROP) Due to Pag-IBIG account under the Regular Fund had a 

negative balance of ₱215,948.17 as of yearend which cannot be ascertained due 

to failure of the Accounting Unit to justify the cause of the abnormal balances 

of these accounts. 

XIII Bislig City Audit of the Due to Pag-IBIG account of the Bislig City Division Office showed 

an abnormal balance or negative balance of ₱72,081.63. This was due to 

remittance of loan amortization to Pag-IBIG Fund even though the amount 

withheld from salary of RPSU paid employees was refunded to them due to the 

loan moratorium effective April 2020. 

 

31.7 It is mandatory on the part of the agencies to withhold and remit all monthly 
premium contributions and loans amortization within the timelines set by the 

government agencies. It is only when premiums and amortizations are remitted 

that members are able to enjoy and access whatever privileges or benefits 

accruing to them, thus unremitted Pag-IBIG premium contributions and loans 

amortization could result in the delay in the availment of loan privileges and 

other benefits offered to all Pag-IBIG members. 
 

31.8 We recommended that Management: 
 

a) immediately remit to the Fund, the withheld contributions and loan 
repayments that were outstanding at the end of CY 2020 to ensure full 

compliance to relevant provisions of the RA No. 9676, avoid risk of 



533 

 

penal sanctions, and demonstrate its commitment to the upkeep of the 

Fund and related accountability;  
 

b) apply and/or strengthen process controls, particularly the monitoring 
and information processing controls, in the management of its Pag-

IBIG trust account, to ensure its efficient and effective delivery, 

manage the related risks and enhance accountability; and 

 

c) require the Accounting Unit to review prior years’ journal entries 
made that may have caused the negative balance of Due to GSIS and 

Due to Pag-IBIG (Regular Fund) accounts. 
 

31.9 Agreeing to our recommendation, the Management also provided us with 
further explanations presented below: 

 
Office/RO SDO/IU Management Comments 

CO  The Management commented that they are exerting earnest 
efforts to implement the recommendations proposed by the 

Audit Team thru the coordination of its concerned offices.  

 

They also has initiated programs and measures that will 

improve the accuracy of remitting Pag-IBIG contributions and 

deductions, and lessen the discrepancies and possible errors 

that might be encountered thereto. 

NCR Caloocan The Accountant of SDO-Caloocan, thru the SDS’s letter dated 

April 08, 2021, informed the Audit Team that JEV 01-2021-

03-001178 dated March 31, 2021 (hard copy attached) was 

drawn to adjust the abnormal balance in the account of Due to 

Pag-IBIG. 

I ROP, 

Pangasinan I 

and Vigan City 

RO No. I Proper has already remitted ₱20,452,177.22 as of 

January 2021. The balance constitutes unremitted deductions 

caused by the upgraded system implemented by HDMF. Series 

of meetings/dialogues were conducted with HDMF to resolve 

the issue and agreements are currently implemented. 

 

It was agreed upon that HDMF will accept the unremitted loan 

contributions of DepEd personnel, should the loans be found 

out to be already inactive, the contributions will be remitted as 

part of their Total Accumulated Value (TAV) because 

contributions and loan repayments which were not accepted by 

HDMF due to system upgrade were then deducted from the 

TAV of the DepEd members. 

SDO-Pangasinan I Proper has already remitted the withheld 

HDMF/Pag-IBIG Contributions on March 5, 2021.  

III  ROP The Management of ROP commented thru their letter dated 

February 17, 2021 that the subject unreliable balances of Due 

to BIR, Due to GSIS, Due to Pag-IBIG and Due to PhilHealth 

of regular fund book have been analyzed and that the 

corresponding adjusting journal entries are being prepared and 

will be recorded, accordingly.

The unremitted balances for HDMF of Notre Dame Village 

NHS were already paid and remitted to the HDMF offices on 

February 11, 2021. 

 

Datu Siang NHS requested to DBM RO No. XII for 

reconsideration of the cancelled check and for issuance of 

Notice of Cash Allocation as it is considered as account 

payable. 

 

Compliance with RA No. 7875 as amended, otherwise known as National Health 

Insurance Act 

 

32. Of the total amount withheld by DepEd for PhilHealth premium contributions as 
of December 31, 2020, the amount of ₱143,211,024.52 remained unremitted, 

contrary to the provisions of RA No. 7875, also known as the National Health 

Insurance Act of 1995, and its IRRs. This could prejudice  the availments of 

claims/benefits due to the concerned members/employees and may also result in 

unnecessary penalties and charges for delayed remittances. 

 

32.1 Republic Act No. 7875, also known as the National Health Insurance Act of 
1995, aims, among others, to provide all citizens of the Philippines with the 

mechanism to gain financial access to health services and to create the National 

Health Insurance Program (NHIP) to serve as the means to help the people pay 

for health care services. 

 

32.2 In addition, pertinent provisions of the IRR of RA No. 7875 provides that: 
 

 Paragraph (d), Section 18: 
 

The failure of the employer to remit the required contribution and to submit 

the required remittance list shall make the employer liable for 

reimbursement of payment of a properly filed claim in case the concerned 

employee or dependent/s avails of Program benefits, without prejudice to 

the imposition of other penalties as provided for in this Rules. 

 

 Paragraphs (a), (b) and (d), Section 20: 
 

(a)  The member’s monthly contribution shall be deducted and withheld 

automatically by the employer from the former’s salary, wage or 

earnings. The employer’s counterpart in the payment of contribution 

shall not in any manner be charged to the employee.

due and applicable. 



535 

 

 

(b) For government agencies, it shall be mandatory and compulsory for the 
employers to include the payment of contributions in their annual 

appropriations. The use of said funds other than for the purpose of 

remitting NHIP contributions will hold the erring government 

employers liable under the pertinent provisions of the Revised Penal 

Code. 

 

 Section 179: 
 

Any employer or officer authorized to collect contributions who, after 

collecting or deducting the monthly contributions due from the employees
