PART II – AUDIT OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



The audit of financial transactions and operations of the Tarlac Agricultural University (TAU) for calendar year 2020 disclosed some observations that needed improvements and/or corrections. Our observations with the corresponding recommendations are discussed in detail in the succeeding paragraphs.



Financial and Compliance Audit



Unrecorded bank deposits from unidentified/unknown origin - ₱12,306,697.84

1)	The accuracy of the Cash in Bank Local Currency, Current Accounts (LCCA) balance amounting to ₱106,604,950.56 as of December 31, 2020 was uncertain because of the (a) failure of the Cashiering and Accounting Units to identify the source of direct deposits/credits amounting to ₱12,306,697.84 and prepare the respective accounting entries therefrom at year-end; and (b) inadequacy of control mechanisms in the  collection  management, resulting in the non-recognition in the books of collections and funds received from other sources contrary to Section 111 of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1445. 

	1)	Section 111 of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1445 states that (1) The accounts of an agency shall be kept in such detail as is necessary to meet the needs of the agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or control agencies of the government; and (2) The highest standards of honesty, objectivity and consistency shall be observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate or misleading information. 

--	Unrecorded bank deposits of unknown source



	2)	Verification of the bank statements showed that there were amounts credited as deposits amounting to ₱12,306,697.84 in the Special Trust Fund (STF) bank accounts maintained by the University with the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) because of unknown nature and origin. As such, the same were not yet acknowledged as collections by the University Cashier, summarized by fund bank accounts, as follows:

	3)	As could be gleaned from the above schedule, there were amounts credited to the respective bank accounts but no documents to support the direct source. However, a revisit of the individual bank accounts of the University would show the usual nature of said transactions; to wit: 

a)	Fund 05 under LBP CA #2622-1013-89 is intended for deposits from the SUC’s internally generated income like tuition fees, matriculation fees and other receipts under R.A. No. 8292.  The Cashier believed that the monies amounting to ₱652,315.44 deposited in this bank account were in the nature of tuition and other fees paid by the enrolling students using the online payment facilities of the University during the COVID-19 pandemic starting June 2020. But the students failed to send a copy of the deposit slips to the Admission and Registration Section (ARS). As such, payments were not coordinated with the Cashiering Section for the issuance of the corresponding official receipts (ORs); 

b)	 Fund 06 under LBP CA #2622-1013-97 deposits normally are proceeds from the auxiliary or business type activities of the University. The Cashier has no idea of the source of ₱672,382.40 pending receipt of information or documents from the depositor. It might take time to determine the particularity of the deposits made; and 

c)	For Fund 07 maintained under LBP CA #2622-1028-14, it is the usual practice to receive deposits from trust receipts and funds transferred from other government agencies. The Cashier assumed that the monies amounting to ₱10,982,000.00 were funds received from other government agencies and the sending of communication or supporting documents for the transferred funds might have been delayed. 

	4)	The total amount of ₱12,306,697.84 remained as reconciling items in the bank reconciliation statements (BRS) of the respective deposit accounts as of year-end.  The Audit Team was able to trace back reconciling items under Fund 05 depository accounts in the BRS of January 2013 and January 2015 in the amounts of ₱16,152.20 and ₱20,952.04, respectively; however, the nature and the identity of the depositor/s of the monies remained unknown for the last seven years. 

	5)	The foregoing issue was discussed with the Cashier during the cash examination of her cash accountability in August 2020 and the Audit Team suggested for the immediate identification of the depositors so that the monies deposited be properly acknowledged and reported as collections.  However, as at year-end, the issue remained unresolved.  She explained that the non-issuance of acknowledgement receipts for collections made through the bank started during the COVID-19 pandemic when the ARS of the University adopted an enhanced enrollment policy of allowing the enrollees to deposit payments in the Land Bank account number LBP CA #2622-1013-89, as a measure to comply with the COVID-19 protocols required by the government.   As such, deposits from unknown depositors accumulated and there was no basis for determining the nature of the transactions involved.  In so doing, the monies deposited were not yet receipted and recorded as collections both in the Cashier’s books and accounting records at year-end.  She further recounted that before the pandemic, all enrollees were required to pay to the Cashier because the ORs have to be presented to the ARS for the issuance of the Certificate of Registration, confirming that the students were officially registered in the course subjects they enrolled in. 

	6)	The Head of the Accounting Unit disclosed that he sought the assistance of the Head of the depository bank on the possible way of identifying the depositors and they were directed to make representation with the Land Bank branch where the depositors actually transacted with. Nonetheless, at year-end, both the Cashier and the Head of the Accounting Unit still need to act on the matter.

	7)	The inability of the Cashier and the Head of the Accounting Unit to take immediate remedial action within the month the problem occurred contributed to the accumulation of unknown deposits. Confirmation with the bank at this time when the transactions are no longer fresh may further pose difficulty.   In view hereof, possible collections from tuition fees, income from business activities and trust funds received through the bank were not duly reported and timely recognized as income and trust  liabilities of the University  resulting in  the misstatements of the balances of the  Cash in Bank -Local Currency, Current Accounts (LCCA) by ₱12,306,697.84, the Payable-Due to Other NGAs or appropriate trust liability account by ₱10,982,000.00 and appropriate Business Income and/or Receivable accounts by ₱1,324,697.84.  

--	Inadequacy of cash management (collection and deposit) control mechanisms

--	For Fund 05- Collection of tuition and other fees

	8)	Verification of existing enrollment policy adopted by the ARS of the University disclosed that on June 4, 2020 and June 22, 2020, the ARS Director submitted proposals which were endorsed by the Vice Presidents of Academic Affairs and the Student Affairs for approval by the University President.  The two approved proposals contained the enrollment procedures for the Mid-year 2020 enrollment for the Graduate School and   1st Semester, Academic Year (AY) 2020-2021 for the undergraduates that were aligned with the interim guidelines for alternative work arrangements (AWA) during the period of state of public health emergency due to COVID-19 pandemic. The guidelines on AWA were promulgated by the Civil Service Commission (CSC) while the implementation of the flexible learning for both undergraduate and graduate programs was circularized by the Commission on Higher Education (CHED). 



	9)	Both approved proposals contained the step-by-step procedures in going thru TAU online registration of enrollees including, among others, the procedures for the payment of tuition fees for those who were not eligible for free tuition and other fees.  The payment procedure specifically provides that (i) if the students are not eligible for free tuition fee and other fees, the payment of the assessed fees, shall be paid to the Land Bank through the following bank account details:



Bank Name

Land Bank of the Philippines

Account Name

TAU Tuition and other Fees

Account Number

2622-1013-89

Bank Branch

LBP Camiling



It also stated that students may pay their tuition and other fees at the TAU Cashier’s Office, at a given schedule; and (ii) if payment is made through the Landbank, students shall email/send a copy of proof of payment to <a href="mailto:tauars@tau.edu.ph">tauars@tau.edu.ph</a>, the email address of the ARS.



	10)	The given procedures did not include any step involving the process of reporting/ communicating the payments made by the students to the Cashiering Office for the proper acknowledgement of the deposits made which resulted in the accumulation of unreceipted monies deposited in the bank account of Fund 05.



	11)	The Audit Team sought the comment of the ARS Director regarding the existing procedures adopted in June 2020 and averred that when students email or send a copy of proof of deposit of their tuition and other fees, the ARS regularly would submit the same to the Cashier for the issuance of OR.  Since the necessary proofs did not reach the ARS, naturally they cannot readily provide the identity of the enrollees. 



--	For Fund 07- Fund Transfers from other government agencies



	12)	The Cashier and the Chief of the Accounting Unit normally followed the procedure in the reporting and recording of the receipt and utilization of fund transfer transactions provided under COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994. In the past, the source agency normally sent a copy of the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) or a letter to the University President informing that an amount was credited to the University bank account for a particular program or project.  However, for CY 2020, with the COVID-19 pandemic, the University has not received the usual communication from source agencies or at least a call or email from their end regarding the fund transferred to the University.  



	13)	Apparently, the unexpected emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic in the lives of the people not only in the Philippines but all over the world in March 2020, has brought to fore the critical need for each government agency to evolve and explore other innovative modalities to deliver their mandates, with primordial concern of avoiding and limiting the risks of infection. On that note, the need to adopt measures that will facilitate the delivery efforts of the officials and employees in the day-to-day operations of the University was rightly explored to meet the needs of the new normal. 



	14)	To strengthen the initiatives done by the ARS in its enrollment process particularly in the payment procedures, we recommended, and management agreed to undertake the following courses of action: 



a)	Instruct the Directors of the ARS and Finance to: (i) immediately identify all enrollees who have paid their tuition fees using the Land Bank online payments;  (ii) send confirmation to students who did not appear in the ARS records that an email or a copy of the deposit slips was sent; and (iii) specifically, the ARS Director prepare a report/list  identifying all students who were not eligible for free tuition fees, both for the undergraduate and the graduate schools for the Academic Year (AY) 1st Semester 2020-2021, with information of the  College/course enrolled in and the amount of tuition and other fees assessed based on the  emailed Certificate of Registration to the paying enrollees.  The report/list shall be forwarded to the Director for Finance, Attention: The Cashier, to identify enrollees issued with official receipts for the payment made thru the Cashier’s Office or bank online payment as of December 31, 2020.  Suggested format of the report/list is attached, marked as Appendix A; 



b)	Direct the Head of the Accounting Unit, thru the Director for Finance, to: (i) verify the accuracy of the assessed fees and the amount paid; (ii) check the correctness of the recorded unpaid tuition and other fees to the Receivables subsidiary ledger (SL) balance as of December 31, 2020; (iii) take the necessary adjustment for any variance established; and (iv) draw the necessary journal entry vouchers (JEVs) to take up the adjustment and furnish a copy to the Audit Team for audit reference; and



c)	Require the ARS Director and the Director for Finance to: (i) review the enrollment process contained in the approved proposal dated June 4, 2020 and June 22, 2020, particularly on the adoption of the online payment of tuition and other fees for  enrollees who are not eligible for free tuition fees; (ii)  explore available online banking facility of the depository bank to maximize the online payment option initiated and with the end in view of expediting collections and real time capture of collection data from the bank and the prompt issuance of ORs and recording of collections; (iii) see to it that  clear and workable control procedures using the Land Bank online payment are put in place and included in the approval process, thus, maintaining check and balance at this stage; and (iv)  disseminate the online payment process flow to all users for them to properly understand the mechanics and the requirements needed in the availment of the bank online payments.





Improper utilization and liquidation of PCF - ₱75,000.00



1)	The procedures in the disbursement, recording and reporting of cash advances drawn from the Petty Cash Fund (PCF) were not properly observed inconsistent with Section 38 of Chapter 6 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I and Appendix 48, Volume II of the same Manual, resulting to the improper recognition in the PCF Record/Cashbook of the refund of excess/unused fund balances amounting to ₱1,484.72 and the use of the Fund for the defrayment of regular operating expenses of ₱50,279.89. Moreover, in the absence of necessary signatures on the Petty Cash Vouchers (PCVs), the responsibility and accountability of the requesting personnel/certifying officers were not established posing the risk of misuse of the University Funds.  



	1)	The Cashbook showed that the cash advances granted from the Petty Cash Fund (PCF) were recorded as fully expended upon release of the cash to the requesting personnel. Upon actual liquidation of the cash advance, the unused balances, if any, were taken up in the PCF record as addition to the unutilized PCF. 

 

	2)	Summarized below are the withdrawals made from the PCF by the requesting personnel for the period covered April 19, 2019 to July 28, 2020; viz:

	3)	The above practice is not in consonance with the procedures to be followed in the liquidation of cash advance from PCF as prescribed in Section 38 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I, specifically sequence nos. 11 to 15, as follows:



Area of Responsibility

Sequence No.

Activities

11

Receives from requesting personnel Copy 2 of the PCV together with SDs. Checks and reviews the completeness of documents such as the date, amount and nature of expenses paid as shown in the SDs.

If incomplete, returns to Requesting Personnel for completion of the needed SDs.



12

If complete, retrieves the original PCV from file and fills up Box II “Total Amount Granted”, Total Amount Paid per OR/Invoice No.”, and amount Refunded/Reimbursed” portion of the original and copy 2 of the PCVs.



13

Checks the appropriate boxes for the “Received Refund” or Reimbursement Paid” portion and sign Box C of the PCV.”



14

Checks and fills up the appropriate boxes for “Liquidation Submitted By” and Reimbursement Received by” upon submission of necessary SDs and receipt or reimbursement of cash, if any, and signs Box D of the PCV.



15

Returns Copy 2 of the PCV to the Requesting Personnel

	4)	Relatively, sequence nos. 12 and 13 require that a refund of the excess or unused cash advance or reimbursement paid shall be made by/to the requesting personnel; thus, the expenses paid out of the PCF shall equal the amount of the Official Receipts (ORs)/Invoices presented.  As such, the PCF Custodian shall only record the actual expenses based on the ORs/Invoices.



	5)	Consequently, the actual expenses and the cash refund for the excess PCF cash advance were not accurately and properly reported in the PCF cashbook/record.   However, PCF expenses for replenishment were based on the actual ORs/Invoices paid out of the PCF.



	6)	Further verification showed that the PCF was utilized for payment of regular/mandatory obligations contrary to Section 35 (a) of Chapter 6, GAM for NGAs, Volume I, stating that the fund shall be kept separately from the regular cash advances/collections and shall not be used for the payment of regular expenses such as rentals, subscription, lights and water bills, purchase of supplies and materials for stock purposes and the like.



	7)	 Incidentally, the following paid transactions amounting to ₱50,279.89 involved regular expenses which are not eligible for payment out of the PCF pursuant to the aforementioned regulation:

	10)	The charging of regular expenses to the PCF and absence of signatures by the fund recipients/certifying officers opened opportunity for Agency Officials/personnel to simply bypass the usual disbursement procedures and documentation required by law, rules and regulations.  If not properly monitored, eventually, such practice may lead to the misuse/misappropriation of the University funds. 



	11)	We recommended and management agreed to instruct the PCF Custodian to: (i) strictly follow the procedures in the utilization and liquidation of PCF as provided under Section 38 of Chapter 6 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I; (ii) stop the practice of using the PCF in paying mandatory obligations and/or regular operating expenses; and (iii) observe the proper use and accomplishment of the PCF Voucher as directed in the Instructions of Appendix 48, GAM for NGAs. Volume II to identify responsibility and accountability on the use of the fund.





Unsubstantiated reconciling items in the Bank Reconciliation Statements



2)	Prior Years’ reconciling items in the Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS) for the Cash in Bank, Local Currency Current Account (LCCA) maintained for the Special Trust Fund (STF), aged more than five years, remained unadjusted and unsubstantiated with documentary evidences to establish their validity rendering doubt on the accuracy of the adjusted book and bank balances presented at ₱106,774,059.63  as of December 31, 2020, inconsistent with Section 74 of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1445, as implemented under COA Circular No. 96-011 dated October 2, 1996, and the pertinent provisions of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I.  

	

1)	Section 74 of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1445 provides that at the close of each month, depositories shall report to the agency head in such form as he may direct the condition of the agency account standing on their books. The head of the agency shall see to it that reconciliation is made between the balance shown in the reports and the balance found in the books of the agency. (Underscoring supplied.)



2)	Bank Reconciliation is defined in Section 2(b), Chapter 21 of the same Manual as settlement of differences contained in the bank statement and cash account in the agency’s/entity’s books of accounts.  Section 3 also enumerates the objectives of the BRS such as the following: (a) to check correctness of both the bank and agency records; (b) serve as a deterrent to fraud; and (c) enable the agency/entity or bank to take up charges or credits recognized by the bank or agency/entity but not yet known to the agency/entity or bank. Section 6 thereof further requires that the Chief Accountant/designated staff shall prepare JEV to recognize all reconciling items that require adjustment and correction in the books of accounts.  



--	Unsubstantiated books and bank reconciling items



3)	Review of the BRS of the Special Trust Fund (Funds 05, 06 and 07) for the months of January 2020 to August 2020 disclosed numerous prior years’ unadjusted reconciling items, aged more than five years.  The same reconciling items were carried in the latest BRS as of December 31, 2020.  



4)	Based on our inquiry with the Chief of Finance, the accounting staff encountered difficulty in tracing and identifying the documents and the specific journal entry vouchers (JEVs) drawn way back in CY 2013 which may help in establishing the validity of the transactions for adjustment.



5)	With reference to the BRS for the months of January to August 2020, the Audit Team noted that the following book and bank reconciling items for the Cash in Bank – LCCA were still not documented or substantiated as at year-end; viz:

6)	As of December 31, 2020, the Accounting Office failed to give clear information on each reconciling item stated above. Apparently, the accounting personnel in charge of the preparation of monthly BRS hastily included the transactions as reconciling items in the books and the bank without proper analysis and tracing to the original source documents.   Nonetheless, the Audit Team assisted the then designated Head of the Accounting Unit (now resigned) in the analysis of the presented reconciling items particularly those identified as the bank’s concern.  However, the recommended adjustments were still not taken into consideration as at year-end since copy of the BRS was not furnished to the Authorized Government Depository Bank (AGDB) concerned.



7)	  Section 10, Chapter 21 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume 1, states that: 



The Chief Accountant or the Designated Staff shall submit the BRS to the following:



Original - COA Auditor (with all supporting documents and JEVs)

Copy 2 - Head of Agency/Entity

Copy 3 - Accounting Division/Unit file

Copy 4 - Bank, if necessary (Underscoring supplied.)



--	Delayed submission of the Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS)



8)	Records also showed that the Accounting Office failed to regularly prepare and submit the monthly BRS to the Audit Team contrary to Section 7, Chapter 21, supra, which states that the Chief Accountant shall submit the BRS (original copies) within twenty days after the receipt of the monthly BS to the COA Auditor. (Underscoring supplied.) The dates of submission of the monthly BRS to COA with the corresponding number of days delayed are as follows, details shown in Appendix B.

9)	The official bank statements were oftentimes received late, so the University Cashier requested from the bank a copy of the snap shot or online generated bank statements for the preparation of the monthly BRS. The delay in the preparation, according to the Chief of Finance, especially during the first six months of CY 2020 was attributed to the COVID-19 lockdown. However, even after the lifting of the lockdown, the Audit Team noted the consistent delay of submission. 



10)	Section 122 of P.D. No. 1445 is partly quoted as follows:



Failure on the part of the officials concerned to submit the documents and reports mentioned herein shall automatically cause the suspension of payment of their salaries until they shall have complied with the requirements of the Commission.



11)	Consequently, the delays in reporting precluded the Audit Team from the timely review of the BRS and the prompt communication to management of any reportable deficiencies encountered in audit.



12)	We recommended and management agreed  that the Chief of Finance take the following courses of action: (i) prepare the BRS and support the reconciling items with complete supporting documents and JEVs; (ii) review and trace prior years’ reconciling items and establish their validity prior to adjustment or correction in the books of accounts; and (iii) consider work delegation/distribution in his Office to best address the delayed submission of BRS; and as a way forward, set target time to finish the review and reconciliation of CY 2021 BRS. Otherwise, impose the provisions of Section 122 of P.D. No. 1445 in case of continuous failure of the Accounting Office to comply with the reporting deadline. 





Unsubmitted cash advance liquidation reports- ₱554,130.00



3)	Liquidation reports of cash advances amounting to ₱554,130.00 granted to Special Disbursing Officers (SDOs) for various purposes in March 2020 and October 2020 were not yet submitted to the COA Audit Team as of December 31, 2020 giving doubt on the validity and propriety of the recorded liquidation contrary to the provisions of Sections 7.1.1 and 7.2.1(a) of the Rules and Regulations on Settlement of Accounts (RRSA). 



	1)	The pertinent provisions of Sections 7.1.1 and 7.2.1(a) of the Revised Rules on Settlement of Accounts (provided under COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009) are quoted successively below for ready reference; to wit:



Section 7.1.1 – The head of the agency, who is primarily responsible for all government funds and property pertaining to his agency, shall ensure among others that the required financial and other reports and statements are submitted by the concerned agency officials in such form and within the period prescribed by the Commission.



Section 7.2.1(a) – The Chief Accountant, Bookkeeper or other authorized official performing accounting and/or bookkeeping functions of the audited agency shall ensure that the reports and supporting documents submitted by the accountable officers are immediately recorded in the books of accounts and submitted to the Auditor within the first ten (10) days of the ensuing month. 



	2)	Inventory of submitted reports on cash advances showed that as of December 31, 2020, the Accounting Unit has not submitted to the Commission on Audit the liquidation documents of the accountable officers amounting to ₱554,130.00 that were already reported as liquidated in the accounting books as of December 31, 2020, summarized as follows:

	3)	Information gathered disclosed that the accountable officers had earlier submitted their liquidation report and supporting documents to the Accounting Unit. However, the liquidation documents have not reached the Office of the Auditor as at year-end; thus, submission was far beyond the required deadline.  The Audit Team was lenient in requiring the submission of the cash advance liquidation report for CY 2020 because of the COVID 19 pandemic and the observance of the imposed protocols.  However, for the reported liquidated cash advances, it is necessary that the required period of submission to COA shall be observed, since the liquidation report and the supporting documents were expectedly received by the Accounting Unit from the accountable officers.  The failure of the accounting unit to timely submit the cash advance liquidation reports and supporting documents cast doubt on the validity and propriety of the recorded liquidation.  As of January 8, 2021, the liquidation reports have yet to be received by the COA Audit Team. 



	4)	The matter has been earlier brought to the attention of the Chief of Finance and justified that upon review of the liquidation reports and supporting documents, documentary deficiencies were noted and required the accountable officers to submit the deficiencies. As such, it took a while before the liquidation documents were submitted to the Commission on Audit.   He promised to submit immediately the liquidation reports and supporting documents once the deficiencies were completed. 



	5)	We recommended and the management agreed to undertake the following courses of action:



a)	Submit immediately to the Audit Team the liquidation reports and documents supporting the utilization of the cash advances of ₱554,130.00; and 



b)	Strictly observe the deadlines on the rendition of accounts and financial reports for the timely review of financial transactions and facilitate the detection and correction of reportable deficiencies.





Unreconciled Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) accounts -₱620,955,907.95



	1)	The year-end balance of the Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) accounts amounting to ₱620,955,907.95 remained unreliable because actions to reconcile the PPE book balances with the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) were limited and interrupted by the multiple tasks handled by the Accounting and the Property and Supply Management Office (PSMO) personnel.  Further, updated Property Ledger Cards (PLCs) and Property Cards (PCs) have yet to be maintained; thus, the correctness and accuracy of PPE data and balances may require considerable time and effort to establish inconsistent with the provisions of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I. 



	1)	This deficiency is a reiteration of the previous audit observations contained in the CYs 2019, 2018 and 2017 Annual Audit Reports (AARs) because of the insignificant improvement on the reconciliation of the Accounting and Property and Supply Management Office (PSMO) records.



	2)	Like the previous years, review of the CY 2020 Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) vis-a-vis the PPE accounting records and PSMO Property Cards (PCs) showed recording discrepancies, summarized as follows:

	3)	As could be gleaned from the above PPE data, there was a negative net difference of ₱12,476,575.01 between the two reports needing appropriate review and reconciliation.



	4)	The discrepancies in the PPE accounts balances may be attributed, among others, to the following causes: 



a)	Different costing method for the University-acquired land. In the accounting books, recognition was based on acquisition cost while the cost used by the Inventory Committee in the RPCPPE was the fair market value of the 32 lots owned by the University (28 of which were verified with titles in the name of the University and 4 donated lots still in the name of the donors); 



b)	Improper classification of PPE accounts like those classified under the (i) Other Land Improvements account in the accounting books as compared to those classified under the Land Improvements and Other Land Improvements accounts in the RPCPPE; (ii) Other Structures account like the Hostels, the Hospitals and Health Centers, etc., which should be separately classified as presented in the Revised Chart of Accounts;



c)	Inclusion in the accounting records of PPE items which were lost/missing, damaged, idle and unserviceable and/or not properly reported by the end-users to the Property Custodian and /or by the Inventory Committee every after physical inventory counts; and 



d)	Inclusion in the RPCPPE of items that were found at station during the physical count and/or not properly reported with the Accounting Office and PSMO for proper adjustment in the accounting and property records.



	5)	Validation of the implementation of the previous years’ audit recommendations disclosed that the Accounting Office and the PSMO started the reconciliation process by initially identifying the proper PPE account classification of all acquired PPE items in CY 2020 then traced their conformance with the PPE records by fund, as exemplified in the following CY 2020 acquired PPEs:

	6)	Verification of the correctness of the PPE classification used for the CY 2019 acquisition was also conducted. However, complete and updated Property Ledger Cards (PLCs) and Property Cards (PCs) have yet to be maintained by the accounting department and the PSMO, respectively. The Chief of Finance and the Head of the PSMO, when asked to comment, justified that they already made initial steps to update their existing PPE PCs and continued the tracing of the prior years acquired PPE to simplify reconciliation of PPE records.  The Accounting Office, on the other hand, has yet to update the existing PLCs.



	7)	The PPE accounts represent 75% of the total assets of the University. Due to multiple functions of personnel in the Accounting and Property Offices, the reconciliation of PPE records might entail a long time to finish.  The absence or incomplete PLCs and PCs may even complicate the reconciliation process, hence, establishing the reliability, correctness and accuracy of PPE data and balances may likewise require considerable time and effort. 



	8)	We recommended and management agreed to implement the following courses of action:



a)	The University President to create an Inventory Committee composed of adequate number of members to be able to complete the physical inventory in three months or less. The Inventory Committee shall have at least one member each from the Accounting and Property Divisions/Units of the Agency. The members of the Inventory Committee shall be temporarily relieved of all their regular duties to fully devote their time in the conduct of the physical inventory taking until the same is completed. The entire inventory taking shall be witnessed by the Commission on Audit (COA) Auditor. A representative from the agency's Internal Audit Service/Unit to witness the inventory taking;



b)	Instruct the Property Division/Unit to update records based on the results of the physical inventory and reconcile with accounting records to come up with the reconciled balances of Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) accounts to be considered as the correct balance of the Agency's PPE; and



c)	Direct the Inventory Committee, in coordination with the Accounting and Property Divisions/Units, to strictly implement the guidelines and procedures in the conduct of physical count of PPE, recognition of PPE items found at station, and disposition for non-existing/missing PPE items, for the one-time cleansing of PPE account balances of government agencies prescribed under COA Circular No. 2020-006 dated January 31, 2020.





Unreconciled Intra Agency fund transfers-₱2,760,558.36  



	2)	The balances of the Due from Other Funds and Due to Other Funds accounts amounting to ₱5,465,102.20 and ₱8,225,660.56, respectively, were not reconciled and fully eliminated as at year-end, resulting in unreconciled difference of ₱2,760,558.36, raising doubt on the correctness and completeness of the recorded transactions, inconsistent with Section 111 of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1445.



1)	Section 111 of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1445 states that (1) The accounts of an agency shall be kept in such detail as is necessary to meet the needs of the agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or control agencies of the government; and (2) The highest standards of honesty, objectivity and consistency shall be observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate or misleading information. 



2)	As of December 31, 2020, the intra-agency fund transfers, like in the previous year, remained unreconciled.  The Chief of the Accounting Unit, as a remedial action last year disclosed the net unreconciled balance of ₱2,760,558.36 in the Notes to the Financial Statements with the notion that it can be a temporary explanation on the issue of non-reconciliation. The same was again disclosed as of year-end without any hint of action to reconcile the same.



3)	Records showed that the unreconciled amount of ₱2,760,558.36 pertains to transactions in CYs 2010 and 2014 that were not analyzed to identify the cause of recording error, by commission or omission, and reconciliation was overlooked through the years (Details in Appendix C).  Summarized below is the breakdown of the discrepancy, to wit:

4)	From the above schedule, the unreconciled amounts were all from Fund 06-Business and Auxiliary Fund.  It appeared that the amounts were prior years’ transfers from and to Fund 06 bank account without the corresponding entries from and to the source/receiving fund accounts.  The Chief of Finance justified that they have been trying to trace the documentary evidence for the prior years’ fund transfers. Reportedly, there were intra-fund transfers without documents and journal entries for the actual movement of cash from one fund to another rendering doubt on the accuracy and completeness of the intra-fund transfer transactions and the balances of the Due from Other Funds and Due to Other Funds as at year-end.  



5)	The Audit Team reminded the Chief of Finance to supervise and monitor the work of the Accounting Unit in the reconciliation process. Nonetheless, as of year-end, the intra-agency fund transfers have yet to be reconciled. This is to emphasize that the disclosure of the unreconciled transactions in the Notes to FS cannot cure the recording errors committed.  It only strengthened the inaction of the concerned officials to reconcile the intra-fund transfer transactions. 



6)	The Chief of Finance averred that available accounting records only provide amounts carried over without the transaction references, making reconciliation difficult at this time. 



7)	We recommended and management agreed that the Chief of Finance take the following courses of action:



a)	Supervise and provide assistance to the accounting personnel in charge of recording the intra-fund transfers in gathering all available documents and data/information pertinent to the unreconciled amount; 



b)	Trace and analyze the documents gathered based on the nature and purpose of the transactions as well as the actual transfer of monies, and reconcile and adjust the accounts to the appropriate fund cluster; and



c)	Refrain from making intra-fund transfers since each Fund Cluster has specific purpose and separate bank account where monies can be readily deposited.  In case of recording errors, take immediate corrective measure and draw necessary adjusting entries to avoid unreconciled/unadjusted accounts. 





Improper transfer of unutilized balance for CY 2018 project cost to the Trust Fund -₱1,197,459.31

	3)	The unutilized balance amounting to ₱1,197,459.31 of the CY 2018 contract on the Construction of Information Technology (I.T.) Data Center Project, no longer necessary for the attainment of the purpose of the fund, was improperly transferred to the Trust Fund, resulting in the overstatement of the affected accounts such as Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) accounts (net of depreciation) Prior Year Adjustment, and Accounts Payable by ₱1,161,535.53, ₱35,923.78 and ₱1,197,459.31, respectively, contrary to Sections 98, 111 and 112 of Presidential Decree (P. D.) No. 1445.



--	Non-reversion of the unexpended contract cost-₱1,197,459.31  

1)	Section 98 of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1445 states that the Commission, upon notice to the head of agency concerned, may revert to the unappropriated surplus of the general fund of the national government, any unliquidated balance of accounts payable in the books of the national government, which has been outstanding for two years or more and against which no actual claim, administrative or judicial, has been filed or which is not covered by perfected contracts on record. This section shall not apply to unliquidated balances of accounts payable in trust funds as long as the purposes for which the funds were created have not been accomplished.



2)	Section 10 of the General Provisions of the General Appropriations Act (GAA) of FY 2020 (R.A. No. 11465) also  provides that Departments, bureau offices, and instrumentalities of the National Government, including Constitutional Offices enjoying fiscal autonomy and SUCs are mandated to close and revert all balances of Special Accounts, Fiduciary or Trust funds, and Revolving Funds to the General Fund in any of the following circumstances: (i) when there is no legal basis for its creation; (ii) when their terms have expired; or (iii) when they are no longer necessary for the attainment of the purpose for which said funds were established. 



3)	Validation of completed infrastructure projects covering the period CYs 2019 and 2020 showed that the CY 2018 Construction of Information Technology (I.T.) Data Center Project, with a total contract cost of ₱23,949,186.23, was inspected and accepted by management as completed.  Based on records, however, a sum of ₱1,197,459.31 of the contract cost remained unutilized due to the contractor’s failure to deliver movable furniture and fixtures as component of the project.

4)	When the said contractor defaulted by the end of CY 2019, the Chief of the Accounting Unit transferred the unexpended balance to the Trust Fund on December 23 of that year to avoid the reversion of the money to the National Treasury as required under Section 10 of the General Provisions of the GAA of FY 2019 and at the same time ensure the availability of funds in case the contractor might opt to deliver the items in the succeeding year.  Notwithstanding, the contractor never signified its intention to deliver even in CY 2020 so that management decided to forego the remaining unfulfilled contract. The money remained in the Trust Fund even though the original purpose of the fund was no longer necessary.



--	Improperly accounted intra-fund transfer

5)	Section 111 of the same Decree provides that (1) The accounts of an agency shall be kept in such detail as is necessary to meet the needs of the agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or control agencies of the government; and (2) The highest standards of honesty, objectivity and consistency shall be observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate or misleading information.



6)	Section 112 also states that each government agency shall record its financial transactions and operations conformably with generally accepted accounting principles and in accordance with pertinent laws and regulations.  



7)	Review of the Journal Entry Vouchers (JEVs) drawn to take up the said completed project to the appropriate PPE accounts and the unused remaining project cost disclosed the following journal entries; viz:

8)	As could be gleaned from the table above, the Project was recognized under Fund 01 for the entire contract cost of ₱23,949,186.23, including the unutilized portion of ₱1,197,459.31. Meanwhile, in the General and Trust Fund books, no proper accounting was made for the transfer to and receipt of the fund transferred. Instead, a credit to Accounts Payable was made to take up the unpaid obligation for the undelivered items. 



9)	 In view of the foregoing, the School Buildings account and Accounts Payable were both overstated by ₱1,197,459.31 since the liability of the Agency for the undelivered Furniture and Fixtures did not exist.  In addition, depreciation of the asset was provided based on the erroneous amount, resulting in the overstatement of Depreciation Expense and Accumulated Depreciation by ₱35,923.78 as of December 31, 2020.



10)	We recommended and management agreed to take the following courses of action: 



	a)	Chief of Finance and the University Cashier to cause the proper reversion of the amount of ₱1,197,459.31 to the National Treasury since the purpose of the fund is no longer necessary and that valid claim had not been established for the past two years;

a)	The Chief of Finance adjust/reduce the cost of the Information Technology (I.T.) Data Center Building by ₱1,197,459.31, the corresponding allowance for depreciation and Prior Year Adjustment (Depreciation Expense) by ₱35,923.78 and Accounts Payable by ₱1,197,459.31; and

b)	Strictly observe the guidelines in the release and utilization of funds as well as the monitoring of expenditure items authorized in the General Appropriations Act (GAA) in accordance with its general and specific provisions.



Non-closure of completed projects to appropriate PPE accounts-₱1,839,257.99



	4)	The costs of prior year’s implemented/completed projects such as Rehabilitation of Damaged Buildings and Infrastructure-Men’s Dormitory totaling to ₱1,839,257.99 were not classified to the appropriate Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) account, resulting in the overstatement of the Construction in Progress (CIP)- Buildings and Other Structures and understatement of the PPE account balance by ₱1,839,257.99. In addition, the related allowance for depreciation account was undetermined as of year-end, contrary to Section 8(g), Chapter 10, Volume 1 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs) and Section 111 of Presidential Decree (P. D.) No. 1445.

 

1)	Section 8(g), Chapter 10 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume 1 states that during the construction period, all expenses incurred in relation to the construction of the PPE shall be taken up in the books as Construction in Progress (CIP) with the appropriate asset classification. As soon as the construction is completed, the CIP account shall be classified to the proper asset account. Likewise, all expenses such as interest, license fees, etc. during the construction period shall be capitalized.



2)	Section 111 of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1445 also states that (1) The accounts of an agency shall be kept in such detail as is necessary to meet the needs of the agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or control agencies of the government; and (2) The highest standards of honesty, objectivity and consistency shall be observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate or misleading information.



3)	Records showed that the CY 2015 project Rehabilitation of Damaged Buildings and Infrastructure-Men’s Dormitory, paid under Disbursement Voucher (DV) No. 101-2015-12-1171 dated December 12, 2015 for a total of ₱1,839,257.99, was not yet reclassified to the Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE)-Buildings and Other Structures account despite its completion.  Information disclosed that the contractor abandoned the project in CY 2015 when it was only 60% completed. The remaining 40% was pursued by administration scheme.  Since the rehabilitation works were already 100% completed, the cost recorded in the Construction in Progress (CIP) account plus additional expenditures incurred during the construction period should have been closed and classified/capitalized to PPE-Buildings and Other Structures account. Incidentally, the allowance for depreciation was not established for that portion of the project since the period of completion.



4)	The matter was discussed with the Chief of Finance and the Chief of the Supply and Property Management Office who commented that the project was completed by administration, so they presumed that all costs have already been capitalized until their attention was called upon by the Audit Team.  However, as of year-end, adjustment of the project cost to the appropriate PPE classification has yet to be made by the Accounting Unit resulting in the misstatements of the CIP-Buildings and Other Structures, PPE- Buildings and Other Structures and the related Depreciation Expense/Accumulated Depreciation accounts.



5)	We recommended and management agreed that the Chief of Finance take the following courses of action:



a)	Immediately draw a journal entry voucher (JEV) taking up the reclassification and adjustment of the completed projects amounting to ₱1,839,257.99 to the appropriate Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) account; 

b)	Recompute the depreciation of the finished buildings and adjust provisions accordingly from the time the projects were capitalized; 

c)	Strictly comply with the accounting policy on the recording and reporting of construction in progress and monitor the completion and acceptance thereof by management for the proper capitalization of the completed projects to the appropriate PPE account classification; and 

d)	Furnish the Audit Team with a copy of the JEV and the supporting documents taking up the necessary adjustments.	





Undocumented Accounts Payable-₱64,590.00



	1)	The year-end balance of the Accounts Payable account as of December 31, 2020 amounting to ₱12,701,624.09 included long outstanding payables, aged more than two years, in the amount of ₱64,590.00 which were devoid of proper documentation to establish valid and legal obligations of the University contrary to Sections 4 (5) and (6) of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1445 as implemented by COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012.



1)	Review of the schedules of outstanding Accounts Payable as of December 31, 2020 showed that there were three obligations amounting to ₱64,590.00 charged against Fund 07 (184)-Trust Fund which remained unsettled for more than two years, the details are as follows:

2)	As gleaned from the schedule, the unpaid obligations have not been processed for payment for the last three years.  Verification disclosed that the Disbursement Vouchers (DVs) and the Utilization Request and Status (URS) supporting the recorded payables were not approved by the authorized officials. Further, no other documentary evidence was attached to the DVs contrary to Sections 4(5) and (6) of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1445 providing the fundamental principles in the financial transactions and operations of the government which require, among others, that disbursements or disposition of government funds or property shall invariably bear the approval of the proper officials; and claims against government funds shall be supported with complete documentation. As such, the unpaid claims cannot be further processed for payment.  



3)	 Apparently, the transactions were recognized as payable even in the absence of vital supporting documents that can prove the valid and legal obligations of the University regardless of the year these were incurred and ignoring the basic documentary requirements for government transactions provided for in COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 4, 2012 and its amendments. 



4)	We recommended and management agreed to undertake the following courses of action:

 

a)	Instruct the University Budget Officer and the Chief Finance Officer to: (i) stop the practice of recognizing undocumented accounts payable; and (ii) ensure that recording thereof is based on valid and legal obligations or commitments of the University for which goods/services/projects have been delivered/rendered/completed and accepted, regardless of the year these obligations were incurred; and 

b)	Direct the Chief Finance Officer to: (i) review the accounting entries taking u the Accounts Payable and make the immediate necessary reversion to adjust/correct the erroneous recognition; and (ii) furnish the Commission on Audit (COA)/Audit Team a copy each of the journal entry voucher (JEV) supported with the original DVs and the JEV drawn adjusting Accounts Payable. 





Infractions in the payment of monthly RATA-₱2,189,000.00



	2)	Various infractions were noted in the grant of monthly  Representation and Transportation Allowance (RATA) to 22 designated University officials for the year 2020, such as (a) absence of a stipulation in their respective Designation Order on their entitlement to RATA as required under Section 8.1.1 of National Budget Circular (NBC)  No. 548 dated May 15, 2013;  (b) grant of said allowance in the total amount of  ₱235,000.00 to six designees whose designations were not among the authorized positions to receive RATA under NBC No. 404 dated  March 29, 1989; (3) improper charges against the Special Trust Fund (Fund 05) in the sum of ₱690,250.00  inconsistent with CHED Memorandum No. 20, Series of 2011 dated August 4, 2011; and (4) approval of claims with insufficient documentation contrary to Section 4 of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1445 as implemented under COA Circular 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012, denoting  irregular  disbursements  of government funds. 

1)	COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012 defines irregular expenditure as an expenditure incurred without adhering to established rules, regulations, procedural guidelines, policies, principles, or practices that have gained recognition in laws. Irregular expenditures are incurred if funds are disbursed without conforming to prescribed usages and rules of discipline. There is no observance of an established pattern, course, mode of action, behavior, or conduct in the incurrence of an irregular expenditure. A transaction conducted in a manner that deviates or departs from, or which does not comply with standards set is deemed irregular. A transaction which fails to follow or violates appropriate rules of procedure is, likewise, irregular.



2)	Review and evaluation of the Representation and Transportation Allowance (RATA) disbursed for the calendar year 2020 disclosed the following observed deficiencies:



--	Designation Order of the University officials bore no stipulation of their entitlement to RATA as required under Section 8.1.1 of DBM NBC No. 548 dated May 15, 2013.



3)	Item 12.1.1 of Department of Budget and Management (DBM) National Budget Circular (NBC) No. 548 states that a faculty member designated as Vice President, dean of a college, director of center/institute/service or a satellite campus, or a department head in a State University and Colleges (SUC) may be authorized to collect RATA for the virtual position on reimbursable basis, if stipulated in the office order designating him/her as such. (Underscoring and emphasis supplied.)



4)	For CY 2020, the total amount of ₱2,189,000.00 was paid for the monthly RATA of three officials on commutable basis and 23 designated faculty members to various administrative positions on reimbursable basis (details in Appendix D), summarized as follows:

5)	We reviewed copies of the Office Orders issued for the designation of the University faculty members in their respective designated assignments and observed that the stipulation on the entitlement of RATA was not categorically provided.  We noted further that the provisions in the designation orders were limited to the assigned duties and functions of the position and the de-loading of their regular teaching loads to be able to attend to their designated functions, summarized as follows:

6)	The Chief Administrative Officer (CAO), when sought earlier to comment on the matter, said that the original designation orders of the officials who were re-designated to the same positions included the stipulation on the grant of RATA. The same may just have been overlooked in the latest designation orders which she promised to discuss with the approving officer.



7)	  Review of the previous year’s designation orders of the same batch of designated faculty members issued randomly in CYs 2017 to 2019 proved that the RATA entitlement was categorically stated therein which served as the authority to collect. So, the CAO may have been right in her comment that such stipulation was inadvertently omitted. However, as of December 31, 2020, we have yet to receive the copy of the CY 2020 revised designation orders.



--	Grant of RATA to six designees whose designations were not among the authorized positions to receive RATA under NBC No. 404 dated March 29, 1989-₱235,000.00  

 

8)	DBM NBC No. 404 identifies the SUC officials entitled to RATA.  Review of RATA payroll for CY 2020 showed six designees who were granted the allowance but were not among the SUC positions entitled to such.  The table below shows the designations of the officials concerned and the amount of RATA received by each for a sum of ₱235,000.00, to wit:

9)	In follow-up of our previous year’s audit recommendation embodied in the CY 2019 Annual Audit Report (AAR), Finding No. 6, we discussed with management the recurring issue on the payment of RATA to aforementioned designees without sufficient budget in the General Fund. The Chief for Finance justified that effective May 2020, the six designees stopped receiving the allowance as directed by the Chief of the Accounting Unit. Nonetheless, we still noted that the Director for Library Services and Learning Resources continually received the same for the period covering August 2020 to December 2020 which may have been overlooked by the processors. 



10)	 Considering that the designees’ positions were not among those entitled to RATA, the amount paid shall be questioned in audit, unless management can show valid evidence that the designated positions of the designees are among the DBM approved SUCs positions entitled to RATA.



--	Improper charging against Special Trust Fund (Fund 05) inconsistent with CHED Memorandum No. 20, Series of 2011 dated August 4, 2011- ₱690,250.00



11)	The collection and utilization of the Special Trust Fund (STF) is governed by CHED Memorandum Order No. 20 series of 2011.  In the said Memorandum, the purpose in the use of the fund is specific and quantified. As such, the STF can only be utilized for the purpose it was created. Relatedly, the payment of the additional compensation of regular employees like the RATA is not one of the purposes for its creation.  



12)	Paragraph 13 of DBM NBC No. 548, however, instructed the funding source of RATA. The amounts required for the grant of commutable or reimbursable RATA to incumbents or OICs of regular positions and the designated officials in SUCs shall be charged to the respective agency appropriations/budgets for the purpose. In case of deficiencies, the same shall be charged against agency savings from the regular fund.



13)	The issue was likewise discussed in detail in the CY 2019 AAR, Finding No. 6, with the recommendation, among others, to refrain from charging RATA against the STF pursuant to the foregoing DBM regulation.



14)	During the discussion with management regarding the above issue, we were informed that the practice was put to stop effective May 2020.  As observed, the RATA of the designees for the period covered May to December 2020 were paid and charged against Fund 101 only in December 2020 upon obtaining the approval by the University President of the use of the savings from Personal Services (PS) for the purpose.  Moreover, the Chief Finance Officer recounted that a disbursement voucher (DV) under Fund 101 was already prepared for the return of the amount of ₱690,250.00 to the STF-Fund 05. Nonetheless, as of December 31, 2020, the approval on the use of the savings from PS and the journal entry vouchers (JEVs) supporting the transfer of fund from Fund 101 to Fund 05 amounting to ₱690,250.00 were not yet submitted to the Audit Team.



--	Insufficient valid supporting documents inconsistent with Section 4 of P.D. No. 445 as implemented under COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012



15)	Section 4(6) of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1445 providing the fundamental principles in the financial transactions and operations of the government requires, among others, that claims against government funds shall be supported with complete documentation.  COA Circular No. 2012-001 prescribes the following documentary evidence that shall support the RATA claims:



a)	Certification that the official/employee did not use government vehicle and is not assigned any government vehicle;  

b)	Certificate or evidence of service rendered or approved Daily time Record; and

c)	For reimbursable RATA, receipts or Certificate to the effect that the expenses had been incurred in accordance with the purpose for which the allowance is granted. (Sec. 386, Article 1, Chapter 5, Vol. I, GAAM) 

16)	For CY 2020, the only supporting documents attached to the RATA payrolls of the designees were hard copies of bank payroll register; bank’s official receipt in acknowledgement of the RATA check issued to the bank; and certification that the recipients rendered services duly certified by the Human Resource and Management Officer (HRMO). However, the payrolls for the reimbursable RATA for the designees did not bear the signatures opposite their names in the provided column and the receipts or certifications that the expenses had been incurred in accordance with the purpose for which the allowance is granted were not attached.



17)	Meanwhile, the audit of the paid RATA payrolls was not timely performed because of the delayed submission of the monthly accounts of the University which may be attributed to the COVID-19 lockdown and the protocols required to be observed nationwide and in all government agencies.  Nonetheless, government rules and regulations governing financial transactions shall be strictly adhered to and consistently applied by all concerned.  Otherwise, the regularity of the transactions shall be questioned.



18)	We recommended and management agreed to undertake the following courses of action:



a)	Instruct the Chief Administrative Officer and the Executive Secretary to the University President to: (i) check and monitor official designations of faculty members entitled to RATA to include stipulations on their entitlement to such, as required by DBM NBC 548 before approval by the University President. The absence of which shall be construed that the University President does not allow the designees to receive the reimbursable RATA; and (ii) immediately furnish the Audit Team a copy of the revised Designation Orders, if any, duly received by the faculty members authorized to receive RATA;

b)	Require all six identified designees without valid authority to receive the monthly RATA to refund immediately the amount of ₱235,000.00;

c)	Direct the Chief Administrative Officer, the Budget Officer, and the Chief Finance Officer to: (i) refrain from processing and charging RATA against Special Trust Funds; and (ii) strictly comply with the use of savings of the regular fund to cover the deficiency on the approved budget for RATA. Charge against savings of the Personal Services (PS) only upon the approval of the Head of the Agency, and if charging is to be made against the savings of Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE), secure first the approval of the DBM as provided for in Section 70 of the CY 2020 GAA as implemented under Paragraph 5.2 of DBM NBC No.578 dated January 6, 2020; and 

d)	The Chief Administrative Officer, the Budget Officer, the Chief Finance Officer and the Human Resource and Management Officer to: (i) require all RATA payees to immediately affix their signatures in the RATA payrolls for CY 2020 attesting that the corresponding amounts were correct and actually received by them. Henceforth, all reimbursable RATA payrolls shall bear the signature of the payees; and (ii) require all payees to immediately submit the duly signed certifications identified in item (a) and (c) of paragraph 1.15 above.  If necessary, create a template that will contain all the certifications needed as supporting documents to the paid RATA to facilitate preparation and submission thereof.  



Delayed Rendition of Accounts



1)	The Accounting Office of the University has been delayed in the submission of financial reports and documents to the Commission on Audit (COA); thus, the Audit Team is precluded from timely audit and review of the financial data, adversely affecting the prompt communication of reportable deficiencies to management contrary to Section 60, Chapter 19, Volume I of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs) and other existing laws, rules and regulations. 

	1)	Section 60, Chapter 19, GAM for NGAs, Volume 1, sets the deadlines on submission of reports providing that all National Government Agencies shall prepare and submit the following financial statements and schedules, within the following prescribed deadline:

	4)	The Chief of the Accounting Unit had been constantly reminded of the regular submission of the reports especially after the COVID-19 lockdown. The Audit Team issued Audit Observation Memorandum (AOM) Nos. 2018-009(18), 2019-002(19) and 2020-04(20) dated July 16, 2018, January 31, 2019 and November 20, 2020, respectively, informing management of the delayed submission of the monthly reports.  However, the audit recommendations appeared to be consistently overlooked. 



	5)	The prompt recording and reporting in the accounting records of financial transaction are clearly the responsibility of the accounting unit. The preparation of the monthly and quarterly financial reports and supporting documents/schedules are the final outputs for submission to the Commission on Audit (COA) and other oversight agencies within a set deadline to be strictly complied with. 



	6)	It appeared, however, that the Chief of the Accounting Unit has not been closely supervising and monitoring the performance of the accounting staff resulting in the consistent delay in the submission of reports. The Finance officials concerned also failed to supervise the Accounting Unit; thus, the pervasiveness of the audit observation.  For the last three years, the Accounting unit failed to manifest improvement on the matter. 



	7)	Continuous delay in the submission of the financial reports to the COA is a manifestation of inefficiency of the involved University personnel responsible in the processing, recording and reporting of financial transactions in every accounting period. Such inefficiency may be attributed to neglect of duty by the officials directly supervising the accounting/finance personnel. Continuous disregard of the required period of submission of financial documents to the COA shall cause the suspension of the salary of the involved accounting/finance personnel as provided for in Section 122 of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1445, quoted:



(1)  Whenever deemed necessary in the exigencies of the service, the Commission may under regulations issued by it require the agency heads, chief accountants, budget officers, cashiers, disbursing officers, administrative or personnel officers, and other responsible officials of the various agencies to submit trial balances, physical inventory reports, current plantilla of personnel, and such other reports as may be necessary for the exercise of its functions.  (2)   Failure on the part of the officials concerned to submit the documents and reports mentioned herein shall automatically cause the suspension of payment of their salaries until they shall have complied with the requirements of the Commission. (3)    No appropriation authorized in the General Appropriations Act shall be available to pay the salary or any official or employee who violates the provisions of this section, without prejudice to any disciplinary action that may be instituted against such official or employee.

	8)	Consequently, the delays in financial reporting adversely affected the conduct of audit. The delayed rendition of the monthly and quarterly financial reports precluded the Audit Team to review the financial data for CY 2020. The Audit Team was hindered in performing its mandate in a timely fashion, while the reportable deficiencies were also not conveyed promptly to the agency management.



	9)	We recommended and management agreed to implement the following courses of action:



a)	Strictly observe the deadlines in the rendition of accounts and financial   reports for the timely review of financial transactions to enable detection and correction of reportable deficiencies;



b)	(i) Review the existing financial recording and reporting system; (ii) Identify the cause/s of the problems/issues on the delays of submission and adopt possible workable solution; and (iii) Formally and clearly delegate accounting tasks and require the submission of the expected outputs at specific date/s from each personnel; 



c)	Closely supervise the accounting staff and monitor the performance of their assigned tasks and outputs. Identify personnel responsible for the delay and apply the necessary intervention like mentoring and coaching, to improve their accounting skill. Enhance, if necessary, the use of digital applications to improve the efficiency and productivity of the personnel;



d)	Include in the Individual Performance Commitment and Review (IPCR) of all accounting personnel the specific tasks, timelines, and the expected outputs to be accomplished to pinpoint responsibility and accountability on the assigned tasks, and facilitate review of actual performance and accomplishments of individual staff; and



e)	Initiate administrative sanctions on the erring personnel, as warranted by the situation, thru automatic suspension of payments of salary and other emoluments until they shall have complied with the submission of reports pursuant to Section 122 of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1445.  





	Gender and Development (GAD)

1)	For CY 2020, the Tarlac Agricultural University (TAU) utilized the amount of ₱55,966,858.49 or 42.58% of the allocated amount of ₱131,500,384.57 for the implementation of planned Gender and Development (GAD) activities that addressed gender issues within the University in accordance with Joint Circular (J.C.) No. 2012-01 of the Philippine Commission on Women (PCW), Department of Budget and Management (DBM) and National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA).

1)	Joint Circular (J.C.) No. 2012-01 of the Philippine Commission on Women (PCW), Department of Budget and Management (DBM) and National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) dated July 20, 2012  states that Pursuant to the Magna Carta of Women (MCW) and the General Appropriations Act (GAA), all government departments, including their attached agencies, offices, bureaus, state universities and colleges (SUCs), government-owned and controlled corporations (GOCCs), local government units (LGUs) and other government instrumentalities shall formulate their annual Gender and Development (GAD) plans and budgets within the context of their mandates to mainstream gender perspectives in their policies, programs and projects. GAD Planning shall be integrated in the regular activities of the agencies, the cost of implementation of which shall be at least five percent (5%) of their total budgets. The computation and utilization shall be implemented in accordance with the specific guidelines provided therein.

2)	In CY 2020, the GAD Office of the University formulated a GAD Plan to address the gender issues such as gender-responsive governance, protection and fulfillment of women’s human rights and promotion of women’s economic empowerment. 

3)	As shown in the CY 2020 year-end accomplishment report, various seminar/workshops relative to Gender Sensitivity Orientations were conducted and facilitated the holding of several development trainings for the faculty and employees of TAU.

4)	Per evaluation of the Audit Team, the above accomplishments were all GAD-related activities.

5)	We commended the management in its efforts to: (i) address the identified gender issues; (ii) design a training program towards women empowerment and gender equality; (iii) pursue programs/projects intended to uplift the status of women employees in the workplace; and (iv) allot funds for the formulation and implementation of Gender and Development (GAD) Plan for the benefit of all employees. 



6)	We recommended and the management agreed to continue its compliance with the laws, rules, and regulations on GAD.





Compliance of the curricular programs to the CHED policies, standards, and guidelines 



2)	The 51 curricular programs offered by the University were aligned with the mandate explicitly mentioned in Section 2 of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 10800. However, (a) only nine were included in the listed priority courses as identified in the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) Memorandum Order (CMO) No. 05, series of 2019; (b) 17 have no Certificate of Program Compliance (COPC) as mandated under CMO No. 14, series of 2019; and (c) ten have not undergone the required independent accreditation under CMO No. 01, series of 2005,  raising doubt on the capacity of the University to deal with the national development plan on current manpower demands and its full compliance with the policies, standards, and guidelines of CHED ensuring that the existing programs of the State Universities and Colleges (SUCs) are quality-assured.



1)	The general mandate of the University as mentioned in Section 2 of the governing charter of the University or Republic Act (R.A.) No. 10800 approved on May 10, 2016 is to primarily provide advanced education, higher technological and professional instruction, and training in the fields of agriculture. agribusiness management, science and technology, engineering, teacher education, non-traditional courses, and other relevant fields of study. It shall also undertake research, extension services, and production activities in support of the development of the Province of Tarlac, and provide progressive leadership in its areas of specialization. 



2)	As of December 31, 2020, the University has 48 curricular courses in the fields of agriculture, agribusiness management, science and technology, education, and engineering both in the undergraduate and graduate levels and three vocational/technical courses which are aligned with its primary mandate as summarized in this chart.







3)	The three Vocational/ Technical courses offered are two-year courses aimed at developing essential skills and competencies for highly effective personnel in the industry sector particularly in office management, computer hardware technology and home technology management.



--	23 undergraduate priority courses not listed under CHED Memorandum Order No. 05, series of 2019



4)	Of the 32 undergraduate curricular courses offered, only nine were listed in the updated priority courses under CHED Memorandum Order No. 05, series of 2019.  Eight were old courses offered way back in CYs 1975 to 2004 and one was newly offered in AY 2020-2021. A total of 12 other courses currently offered by the University were CHED priority programs under CMO No 04, Series of 2011 dated January 9, 2014 and CMO No. 01, Series of 2014 dated March 18, 2011, summarized as follows:

5)	The Vice President for Academic Affairs (VPAA) informed the Audit Team that there is an ongoing revision of about 15 curricular programs to update these with the requirements of the emerging developments in the educational system. Meanwhile, the priority courses identified under the CMO are timely being considered.  



6)	It is worthy to mention that the priority courses identified by CHED were offshoots of the studies and deliberations conducted by the oversight government agencies in consultation with the private organizations in line with the national development plan on manpower demands. Hence, it is necessary that the University encourage new enrollees to take up the priority programs for them to avail of the scholarship support and obtain a job-ready profession upon graduation.  Failure of the University to consider the list of priority courses identified in the CMO might lead to over/undersupply of graduates ultimately resulting to a limited chance of employment in the field of professions with high demand and required competencies in the local and global labor market. 



--	65% Issuance of Certificate of Program Compliance under CMO No. 14, Series of 2019 



7)	Section 10 of the Republic Act (R.A.) No. 10931 or the Universal Access to Quality Tertiary Education Act requires that the CHED and the TESDA shall ensure quality standards in the review and consequent endorsement of the budget of the SUCs, Local University and Colleges and state-run Technical and Vocational Institutions, respectively.  To implement said provision, CHED issued CMO No. 14, series of 2019 dated November 13, 2019 which provides the policies and guidelines in the issuance of Certificate of Program Compliance (COPC) to SUCs and LUCs. The COPC, as defined in the CMO, is a recognition that the specific degree program being offered by the SUCs/LUCs are fully compliant with the policies, standards, and guidelines of the CHED to ensure that their existing programs are quality assured.



8)	Data and information gathered from the Office of the VPAA disclosed the following status of the OCPC requirement of the degree programs offered by the University (Details are shown in Appendix E):

9)	As could be gleaned from the above data, 94% of the programs offered in the undergraduate level have OCPC, 8% in the Master’s Programs and none for the Doctorate Programs.  The University, as of December 31, 2020, had 65% overall compliance with the requirement of the CMO No. 14.  The revision of the curriculum in the graduate programs delayed the University’s compliance with the CHED requirements for the issuance of the OCPC.  The University has to comply with the two-year grace period from the date of the CMO’s effectivity to continuously avail of the benefits and privileges accorded by the government to SUCs and likewise ensure a quality assured degree program offering to the public.



--	  Independent accreditation of curricular courses under CMO No. 01, Series of 2005 



10)	It is the declared policy of the State to encourage and assist, through the CHED, higher education institutions which desire to attain standards of quality over and above the minimum required by the State. For this purpose and in aid of the exercise of its regulatory functions, CHED adopted policies, the latest of which is CMO No. 01, Series of 2005 dated February 15, 2005, providing the Revised Policies and Guidelines on Voluntary Accreditation in Aid of Quality and Excellence in Higher Education, to encourage both private and public sector institutions the use of voluntary non-governmental accreditation system, through the CHED accredited Accrediting agencies. Accreditation, as defined in the CMO, is a process for assessing and upgrading the educational quality of higher education institutions and programs through self-evaluation and peer judgment. It leads to the grant of accredited status by an accredited agency and provides public recognition and information on educational quality.  



11)	The University has been a recipient, for years, of the different levels of program accreditation given by the Accrediting Agency of Chartered Colleges and Universities in the Philippines (AACCUP).  However, based on verified documents, the following observations were noted:



a)	Out of the 16 curricular programs of the Graduate level, seven Master’s degree program have valid accreditation until year 2023; nine programs have lapsed AACCUP program accreditation, details as follows:

b)	Direct the Director for Quality Assurance to: (i) closely monitor the lapsed accreditation statuses of the different programs of the University for updating or upgrading on or before the end of the grace period; and (ii) ascertain that all curricular programs are subjected to AACCUP accreditation as soon as graduates are produced in order to enjoy the benefits thereon; and

c)	Furnish the Audit Team of the copy of the CHED issued COPCs and AACCUP accreditation documents for reference in audit.
