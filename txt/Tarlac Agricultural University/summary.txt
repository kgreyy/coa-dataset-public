E)	Summary of Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations





1)	The accuracy of the Cash in Bank Local Currency, Current Accounts (LCCA) balance amounting to ₱106,604,950.56 as of December 31, 2020 was uncertain because of the (a) failure of the Cashiering and Accounting Units to identify the source of direct deposits/credits amounting to ₱12,306,697.84 and prepare the respective accounting entries therefrom at year-end; and (b) inadequacy of control mechanisms in the  collection  management, resulting in the non-recognition in the books of collections and funds received from other sources contrary to Section 111 of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1445. (Observation No. 1)



To strengthen the initiatives done by the ARS in its enrollment process particularly in the payment procedures, we recommended and management agreed to undertake the following courses of action: 



a)	Instruct the Directors of the ARS and Finance to: (i) immediately identify all enrollees who have paid their tuition fees using the Land Bank online payments;  (ii) send confirmation to students who did not appear in the ARS records that an email or a copy of the deposit slips was sent; and (iii) specifically, the ARS Director prepare a report/list  identifying all students who were not eligible for free tuition fees, both for the undergraduate and the graduate schools for the Academic Year (AY) 1st Semester 2020-2021, with information of the  College/course enrolled in and the amount of tuition and other fees assessed based on the  emailed Certificate of Registration to the paying enrollees.  The report/list shall be forwarded to the Director for Finance, Attention: The Cashier, to identify enrollees issued with official receipts for the payment made thru the Cashier’s Office or bank online payment as of December 31, 2020.  Suggested format of the report/list is attached, marked as Appendix A; 



b)	Direct the Head of the Accounting Unit, thru the Director for Finance, to: (i) verify the accuracy of the assessed fees and the amount paid; (ii) check the correctness of the recorded unpaid tuition and other fees to the Receivables subsidiary ledger (SL) balance as of December 31, 2020; (iii) take the necessary adjustment for any variance established; and (iv) draw the necessary journal entry vouchers (JEVs) to take up the adjustment and furnish a copy to the Audit Team for audit reference; and



c)	Require the ARS Director and the Director for Finance to: (i) review the enrollment process contained in the approved proposal dated June 4, 2020 and June 22, 2020, particularly on the adoption of the online payment of tuition and other fees for  enrollees who are not eligible for free tuition fees; (ii)  explore available online banking facility of the depository bank to maximize the online payment option initiated and with the end in view of expediting collections and real time capture of collection data from the bank and the prompt issuance of ORs and recording of collections; (iii) see to it that  clear and workable control procedures using the Land Bank online payment are put in place and included in the approval process, thus, maintaining check and balance at this stage; and (iv)  disseminate the online payment process flow to all users for them to properly understand the mechanics and the requirements needed in the availment of the bank online payments.



2. 	The balances of the Due from Other Funds and Due to Other Funds accounts amounting to ₱5,465,102.20 and ₱8,225,660.56, respectively, were not reconciled and fully eliminated as at year-end, resulting in unreconciled difference of ₱2,760,558.36, raising doubt on the correctness and completeness of the recorded transactions, inconsistent with Section 111 of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1445. (Observation No. 6)



We recommended and management agreed that the Chief of Finance take the following courses of action:



a)	Supervise and provide assistance to the accounting personnel in charge of recording the intra-fund transfers in gathering all available documents and data/information pertinent to the unreconciled amount; 



b)	Trace and analyze the documents gathered based on the nature and purpose of the transactions as well as the actual transfer of monies, and reconcile and adjust the accounts to the appropriate fund cluster; and



c)	Refrain from making intra-fund transfers since each Fund Cluster has specific purpose and separate bank account where monies can be readily deposited.  In case of recording errors, take immediate corrective measure and draw necessary adjusting entries to avoid unreconciled/unadjusted accounts. 



3. 	The costs of prior year’s implemented/completed projects such as Rehabilitation of Damaged Buildings and Infrastructure-Men’s Dormitory totaling to ₱1,839,257.99 were not classified to the appropriate Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) account, resulting in the overstatement of the Construction in Progress (CIP)- Buildings and Other Structures and understatement of the PPE account balance by ₱1,839,257.99. In addition, the related allowance for depreciation account was undetermined as of year-end, contrary to Section 8(g), Chapter 10, Volume 1 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs) and Section 111 of Presidential Decree (P. D.) No. 1445. (Observation No. 8)

 

We recommended and management agreed that the Chief of Finance take the following courses of action:



a)	Immediately draw a journal entry voucher (JEV) taking up the reclassification and adjustment of the completed projects amounting to ₱1,839,257.99 to the appropriate Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) account; 

b)	Recompute the depreciation of the finished buildings and adjust provisions accordingly from the time the projects were capitalized; 

c)	Strictly comply with the accounting policy on the recording and reporting of construction in progress and monitor the completion and acceptance thereof by management for the proper capitalization of the completed projects to the appropriate PPE account classification; and 

d)	Furnish the Audit Team with a copy of the JEV and the supporting documents taking up the necessary adjustments.	

	The other audit observations, together with the recommended courses of action, are discussed in detail in Part II of the report. These along with the prior year’s recommendations not yet or partially acted upon and included in Part III of the report, were discussed with the officials and staff of that Agency.

As of year-end, the unsettled audit suspensions and disallowances amounted to ₱2,001,204.86 and ₱6,961,982.41, respectively.
