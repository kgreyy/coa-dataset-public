PART II - OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
Financial Audit 
 
Accounting Errors/ Omissions 

 
1. The Agency’s Cash, Receivables, Inventories, Property, Plant and Equipment 
(PPE) and Other Assets accounts have misstatements amounting to ₱144.235 million 
representing 11.10 percent of its total assets, while Financial Liabilities, Trust 
Liabilities and Other Payables accounts have misstatements of ₱ 1.135 million or 1.44 
percent of the total reported liabilities, and Net Assets/Equity account has 
misstatements of ₱ 8.630 million or 0.71 percent of the total equity as at December 31, 
2020, resulting in overstatements/understatements of the affected accounts. Due to 
the significant impact of such misstatements on the reported balances of the affected 
accounts, Management assertions as to the accuracy, existence, classification and 
valuation of the said accounts could not be relied upon. 
 
2. Paragraph 27 of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) 1 
and Section 15, Chapter 2 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume I, state 
that “The Financial Statements (FSs) shall present fairly the financial position, financial 
performance and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful 
representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance 
with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses 
set out in IPSASs.” 

 
3. Moreover, Sections 111 and 112 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 require 
agencies to keep the accounts in such detail as necessary to meet the needs of the agency 
and at the same time be adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or control 
agencies of the government; and that the highest standard of honesty, objectivity and 
consistency shall be observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate or 
misleading information. Each government agency shall record its financial transactions and 
operations conformably with IPSAS and in accordance with pertinent laws and regulations. 
 
4. In our audit of the Agency’s accounts, we noted the following misstatements that 
were not adjusted by Management as at December 31, 2020, as shown in Table 1 below:

a. Unrecorded collection and expenses – net of ₱0.184 million 

 
5. Reconciliation of balances per books and Bids and Awards Committee (PBAC) 
bank account revealed unrecorded collection from sale of bid documents of ₱300.00 and 
payments for honorarium and other procurement-related expenses in the aggregate amount 
of ₱183,851.91, resulting in the understatement of the accounts Honoraria and Other 
Payables of ₱183,851.91 and ₱300.00, respectively, and overstatement of Cash in Bank- 
Local Currency, Current Account (CIB-LCCA) account by ₱183,551.91. 
, 
6. The submitted Bank Reconciliation Statement (BRS) for PBAC account was until 
April 2015 only, hence, the non-submission of said BRS in the succeeding months 
thereafter affected the early detection of above noted discrepancies. 
  
7. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to 
prepare journal entries by debiting Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) of ₱183,851.91 and 
crediting the accounts Other Payables of ₱300.00 and CIB-LCCA of ₱183,551.91. 

 
b. Unrecognized PS-DBM incurred plane fares of ₱1.894 million and refund for 

undelivered common-use supplies of ₱0.149 million 
 

8. GAM Volume III defines Due from NGAs as the “account used to recognize 
advances for the purchase of goods/services as authorized by law, fund transfers to the 
NGAs for implementation of projects and other receivables from NGAs. Credit this account 
upon receipt of goods/services, and liquidation of fund transfers/receivables.” 

 
9. The Due from NGAs account in the books of PHIVOLCS showed a receivable 
balance from the Procurement Service-Department of Budget and Management (PS-DBM) 



35 
 

of ₱3,157,913.74 as at year-end, while confirmation with the latter accounting records 
disclosed that the former has an overpayment of ₱1,129,235.61 only as of December 31, 
2020, hence, a difference of ₱2,028,678.13 between two (2) records, as summarized in 
Table 2.

Balance per PS-DBM 1,129,235.61  

 
10. Refund of ₱149,365.18 pertains to the cost of undelivered common-use supplies 
from CY 2012 and prior years that was already paid in advance by the agency. Payment 
for said refund was directly remitted by the PS-DBM to the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) 
but still unrecorded in the books of PHIVOLCS due to lack of pertinent supporting 
documents such as copy of Official Receipt from the BTr and breakdown of undelivered 
supplies. Inquiry from the Property Section (PS) disclosed that the details of this refund 
were verbally requested from the PS-DBM. However, as of this report, the requested 
information has not yet been provided by the PS-DBM.  
 
11. For the unrecorded plane fares of ₱1,893,537.97 in the current and prior years, the 
amount of ₱1,477,796.43 was adjusted in January 2021, leaving an unrecorded balance of 
₱415,741.54 due to the absence of supporting documents such as Sales Invoices and plane 
tickets. 

 
12. The non-recognition of travelling expenses and refund from the PS-DBM resulted 
in the overstatement of the accounts Due from NGAs and Accumulated Surplus (Deficit) 
by ₱2,042,903.15 and ₱1,640,052.73 respectively, with corresponding understatement in 
the Traveling Expense-Local of ₱402,850.42 as at year-end.  

 
13. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to: 
 

a. prepare the necessary adjusting journal entries by debiting Accumulated 
Surplus/(Deficit) account by ₱415,741.54 and crediting Due from NGAs 
account by the same amount, duly supported by Travel Orders, Sales 
Invoices and e-tickets from the PS-DBM; and 
 

b. request from the BTr a certification of deposited collection by the PS-DBM 
of ₱149,365.18 as basis in recording the refund. 

 
c. Recognition of Other Receivables despite the absence of COA Notice of Finality of 

Decision (NFD) – ₱0.119 million 



36 
 

 
14. Section 46, Chapter 6, GAM, Volume I provides that “Disallowances shall be taken 
up in the books of accounts only when they become final and executory.” 

 
15. Scrutiny of the Other Receivables account revealed that receivables amounting to 
₱119,003.06 from resigned employees were recognized in the books as debit to the account 
and credit to Trust Liability despite the absence of NFD issued by COA. 

 
16. At present, it is the practice of Management to deduct all disallowances (even those 
with pending appeal) against the terminal leave benefits of resigned/retired employees. 
This is in consonance with an unnumbered memorandum by the Government Accountancy 
Sector of COA dated December 20, 2019, which states that “Premature payments made 
through salary deduction, the agency shall recognize the amount as “Trust Liabilities” 
under the Fund Cluster 01-Regular Agency Fund since no actual cash will be remitted in 
the BTr. The account shall be closed when the disallowances become final and executory 
xxx.” 

 
17. However, some of these disallowances exceeded the amount of claimed benefits 
leading to the recognition of receivables in the books. Considering that these disallowances 
have not yet become final and executory, the recording of audit disallowances as Other 
Receivables prior to the issuance of the NFD is contrary to Section 46, Chapter 6 of GAM 
Volume I, and ultimately overstated the accounts Other Receivables and Trust Liability by 
₱119,003.06. 

 
18. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to 
prepare adjusting entries to derecognize the amount of ₱119,003.06 in the books of 
accounts for the disallowances still on appeal with the Commission Proper. 
 

d. Unrecorded issuances of office supplies – ₱0.096 million 
 

19. Section 7, Chapter 19 of the GAM for National Government Agencies (NGAs), 
Volume I states that: “FSs shall present fairly the financial position, financial performance 
and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the 
effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with the definitions and 
recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in IPSASs.” (Par. 
27, 1PSAS 1) 
 
20. Issuances of office supplies during the year totaled ₱1,203,075.35 credited under 
the Office Supplies Inventory account consisting of prior and current year’s issuances of 
₱1,026,697.97 and ₱176,377.38, respectively, with the latter supported by the first 
semester’s Report of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMIs). 
 
21. The unrecorded issuances of office supplies in the second semester of CY 2020 was 
due to the delayed submission of Requisition Issue Slip (RIS) and the corresponding RSMI 
by the Property Section (PS) to the Accounting Section (AS), which were submitted only 
on January 12, 2021.  
 



37 
 

22. The delayed/incomplete recording of issuances of office supplies overstated the 
Office Supplies Inventory and understated the Office Supplies Expense by ₱95,804.22, as 
at December 31, 2020. 

 
23. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Property Officer to 
submit the RIS and RSMIs to the AS on a timely basis to permit prompt recording of 
issuances of office supplies. 
 

e. Misclassification of semi-expendable properties as PPE- ₱0.127 million 
 
24. Semi-expendable properties consisting of ten (10) Samsung Galaxy A30s 
amounting to ₱127,300.00 per PO No. 2019-11-299ICT were recognized under the account 
Information and Communications Technology Equipment (ICTE) contrary to Section 3, 
Chapter 10 of the GAM, Volume I, which states that “the cost of an item of PPE shall be 
recognized as assets if it meets the capitalization threshold of ₱15,000.00.”  
 
25. Taking up the semi-expendable properties as ICTE overstated the PPE account by 
₱127,300.00 and understated the Semi-Expendable Machinery and Equipment Expenses 
account by the same amount. Further, the related accounts Depreciation Expense and 
Accumulated Depreciation were also overstated by ₱22,171.60. 

 
26. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to 
prepare journal entries to reclassify the acquisition cost of semi-expendable 
properties to Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) of ₱127,300.00 and reverse the related 
Accumulated Depreciation of ₱22,171.60 to reflect the true balance of the accounts. 
 

f. Unrecognized deliveries on unpaid equipment- ₱1 million 
 

27. Paragraph 7 of IPSAS 1 provides “Accrual basis means a basis of accounting under 
which transactions and other events are recognized when they occur (and not only when 
cash or its equivalent is received or paid). Therefore, the transactions and events are 
recognized in the accounting records and recognized in the FSs of the periods to which 
they relate.” 
 
28. On January 22, 2020, the agency entered into a contract with Certeza Infosys Corp. 
for the supply and delivery of one (1) lot Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) 
Receiver and Antenna worth ₱12,498,919.97 under Purchase Order (PO) No. 2020-01-
007SE. Out of the contract amount, the supplier delivered on August 24, 2020 equipment 
worth ₱9,852,016.00 consisting of five (5) Leica GR50W Highline GNSS Reference 
Server of ₱8,633,881.25 and five (5) 100Ah Valve Regulated Lead Acid Battery of 
₱1,218,134.75. The remaining balance of ₱2,646,903.97 pertains to training and 
installation costs in the implementation of the project which was, however, deferred due to 
the COVID-19 pandemic. 

 
29. To compel the supplier to swiftly implement the project, Management reduced by 
₱1,000,000.00 the amount it paid for the deliveries of Technical and Scientific Equipment 



38 
 

(TSE) worth ₱9,852,016.00; hence, only the amount of ₱8,852,016.00 was paid under 
LDDAP No. 9902000528 dated October 29, 2020. However, the TSE was erroneously 
recorded in the books on the basis of the amount paid rather than on the cost of the delivered 
PPE. This practice is contrary to the accrual basis of accounting which states that 
transactions are recognized when they occur and not only when cash or its equivalent is 
paid. 

 
30. As a result, the accounts TSE and Accounts Payable were understated by 
₱1,000,000.00. Moreover, the said PPE are not yet installed and not yet available for use; 
hence, no depreciation expense will be provided. 

 
31. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to 
prepare the necessary journal entry debiting TSE and crediting Accounts Payable, 
both in the amounts of ₱1,000,000.00. 
 

g. Misclassification of PPE items as expenses – ₱0.464 million 
 

32. Section 25, Chapter 10 of the GAM, Volume I states that “An entity shall capitalize 
the costs incurred for repair, betterment, enhancement, expansion or upgrade of existing 
PPE if the amount is material and where the expenditure results in an effective increase in 
the future economic benefits or service potential that is expected to be derived from using 
the asset and the increase in future economic benefits or service potential will be realized, 
among others.” 
 
33. Further, Section 3 of the same Chapter provides that the cost of an item of PPE shall 
be recognized as assets if, among others: 
 

a. It is probable that the future economic benefits or service potential associated 
with the item will flow to the entity; 

b. The cost or fair value of the item can be measured reliably; and 
c. It meets the capitalization threshold of P15,000. 

 
34. The following purchases were recorded under the Expense accounts, contrary to the 
above criteria in the recognition of PPE, resulting in the overstatement thereof by 
₱463,851.40.

35. Inquiry with the Accountant revealed that the above two (2) items were classified 
as expenses since both were charged to MOOE, with the first item considered as 
consumable and replaceable parts of a computer while the second item treated as supplies 



39 
 

rather than one of the components of PPE. Although the above items will not provide 
service potential as parts/components, but when work/assembled together in the form of 
group of assets, said items shall be recognized as PPE as part of the primary PPE. Further, 
considering the materiality of the amount and the conversion in itself enhanced the 
capability of the equipment, the costs should thus be capitalized as these met the 
capitalization criteria in Section 25, Chapter 10 of the GAM, Volume I. 

 
36. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to 
adjust the misclassified expenses to the appropriate PPE account in accordance with 
Sections 3 and 10, Chapter 10 of the GAM, Volume I. 
 

h. Non-provision of depreciation expense to some depreciable PPE - ₱4.253 million 
 

37. Some PPE acquisitions especially those nearing year-end were not provided with 
the required depreciation due to lack of awareness by the Accounting staff involved on the 
rules in providing the same as mentioned in Paragraph 71 of IPSAS 17 which states that 
“Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use, i.e., when it is in the location 
and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by 
management,” hence, the carrying amount of the following PPE accounts was overstated 
by ₱4,252,554.69 , as shown in the Table 4.

38. The non-provision of depreciation on the above PPE also resulted in the 
overstatement of Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) account of ₱3,703,934.58 and 
understatement of the accounts Depreciation Expense and Accumulated Depreciation of 
₱548,620.11 and ₱4,252,554.69, respectively.    
 
39. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to 
prepare journal entries to provide depreciation by debiting Accumulated Surplus 
(Deficit) of ₱4,252,554.69 and crediting Accumulated Depreciation for the same 
amount.  

 

i. Unrecorded repairs and delivered technical and scientific equipment – ₱135.824 
million 
 

40. Outstanding Deposit on Letters of Credit (DLC) account disclosed that an aggregate 
of ₱135,823,607.20 pertains to the cost of completed repairs and delivered TSE but not yet 
reclassified to the appropriate asset/expense accounts. Journal Entry Vouchers (JEVs) 
recording the opening of LC for the said repairs/deliveries were supported by Inspection 
and Acceptance Report (IAR), together with the Purchase Order (PO), Purchase Requests 
(PR), Contract Agreements, Commercial Invoices, Property Acknowledgement Receipts 
(PAR) etc., with details in Table 5.

41. Inquiry with the staff in the AS revealed that accumulation of balances was due to 
the failure of the Property Section (PS) to submit status of deliveries, provide copies of 
IARs and other delivery documents as basis for recording of PPE and the corresponding 
adjustments of the DLC account in the books. It has been the practice of the PS, though 
without basis, to prepare only two (2) copies of IAR upon delivery of the items to document 
the conformity of delivered PPE to standards and specifications stipulated in the PO. It was 
further explained that the first copy, though not required, is attached to the JEVs previously 
drawn in the opening of LC while the second copy is forwarded to the Audit Team to notify 
them of the deliveries.  
 
42. Thus, the existing practice resulted in unrecorded deliveries of equipment or repairs 
for items inspected and accepted by Management, contrary to the following provisions: 
 

• Sections 19, Chapter 10 of the GAM, Volume I on Receipt, Inspection and 
Acceptance of PPE, which provides that “receipt of items purchased by the 
Agency shall be inspected by the Inspection Officer/Committee before 
acceptance by the Property Custodian. Acceptance shall be made only if the PPE 
delivered conform to the standards and specifications in the PO. Inspection and 
acceptance shall be made using the IAR.”   
 

• Section 20, Chapter 10 of the GAM, Volume I on Recording of Deliveries, which 
provides that “deliveries of PPE shall be recorded immediately in the Property 
Card maintained by the PS on the basis of the IAR and other supporting 
documents. The IAR and other supporting documents shall be forwarded to the 
AS for the recording of deliveries in the books of accounts through JEV and in 
the Property, Plant and Equipment Ledger Card (PPELC).” 

 
• Appendix 62 of the GAM, Volume II on the instructions in accomplishing the 

form “IAR”. As prescribed therein, the IAR shall be prepared in four (4) copies 
distributed as follows: 

 
Original – Supplier (to be attached to the DV) 
Copy 2 – Inspection Officer/Committee  
Copy 3 – Accounting Division/Unit (to be attached to the JEV setting  

up payables) 



42 
 

Copy 4 – Supply and/or Property Division/Unit’s file 
 

• Section 6.06 of COA Circular No. 95-006 dated May 18, 1995, which provides 
that “The official responsible for or in charge of accepting deliveries of procured 
items shall, within 24 hours from such acceptance, shall notify the auditor of the 
time and date of the scheduled deliveries.” 

 
43. As a result, the DLC account was overstated by ₱135,823,607.20 and the accounts 
Repairs and Maintenance and TSE were understated by ₱2,396,890.38 and 
₱133,426,716.82, respectively.  
 
44. Likewise, the corresponding depreciation expense for the unrecognized PPE was 
not recognized in the books and should therefore be adjusted once transferred to the PPE 
account to reflect the correct account balance in the CY 2020 FSs.  

 
45. We recommended and Management agreed to require:  

 
a. The PS to submit to the AS the lacking IARs and other delivery documents 

for the immediate recording of unbooked Repairs/Maintenance and TSE 
aggregating to ₱135,823,607.20; and 
 

b. The Accountant to prepare the journal entries debiting Accumulated 
Surplus/(Deficit) and TSE, and crediting DLC for the unrecorded deliveries 
of ₱135,823,607.20. 

 

j. Cash Advances (CA) for recurring expenses erroneously charged to Advances to 
Special Disbursing Officer (SDO) account – ₱0.178 million 
 

46. Audit of transactions revealed that Advances to SDO amounting to ₱920,000.00 
were used for the payment of recurring petty operating expenses of specific Sections in each 
Division rather than for special purpose/time-bound undertakings, as presented in Table 6 
below.

47. As shown in Table 6, grants of CAs were intended for the payment of authorized 
petty or miscellaneous expenses of specific Sections in each Division which cannot be 
conveniently paid through checks; hence, these should have been appropriately recorded 
as Petty Cash instead of Advances to SDO.  
 
48. As provided in the Government Accounting Manual, Volume III, Advances to SDO 
is used to recognize the amount granted to agency’s accountable officers and employees 
for special purpose/time-bound undertakings to be liquidated within a specified period. On 
the other hand, Petty Cash is used to recognize the amount granted to duly designated Petty 
Cash Custodian for payment of authorized petty or miscellaneous expenses which cannot 
be conveniently paid through checks.  
 
49. Thus, any unused balance of the PCF shall not be closed/refunded at the end of the 
year. The Petty Cash Fund Custodian (PCFC) shall only submit to the AS all unreplenished 
PCVs at the end of the year for recording in the books of accounts. 

 
50. The misclassification errors of CAs resulted in an aggregate overstatement of the 
Advances to SDO account by ₱178,138.65 with corresponding understatement of the PCF 
account by the same amount. 

 
51. We recommended and Management agreed to enjoin the Accountant to 
strictly observe the account classifications prescribed in the GAM and to immediately 
prepare a JEV to reclassify the remaining CA of ₱178,138.65 to Petty Cash account.  
 
52. Management commented that JEV No. 2021-02-356, to reclassify the Advances to 
SDO to PCF of ₱164,876.91, was prepared but the remaining CA of ₱13,261.74 was not 
reclassified since it had a specific timeline in the use of the CA such as Capacity Building 
for PHIVOLCS Stakeholders Project. The purpose of the said CAs, however, have been 
revised this year to make it special purpose/time-bound undertakings. 

 
53. As a rejoinder, while it may be true that CAs of ₱13,261.74 are for special 
purpose/time-bound undertakings, said CAs shall be fully liquidated at the end of each year 
and any unexpended balance shall be refunded to the Cashier pursuant to Section 5.8 of 
COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997. 

 
k. Unrecorded deliveries of supplies – ₱0.016 million 

 

54. Paragraph 7 of IPSAS 1 provides “Accrual basis means a basis of accounting under 
which transactions and other events are recognized when they occur (and not only when 
cash or its equivalent is received or paid). Therefore, the transactions and events are 
recognized in the accounting records and recognized in the FSs of the periods to which 
they relate.” 



44 
 

 
55. On February 27, 2020, the amount of ₱15,600.00 was paid under Check No. 
1467058 to Jadimav Trading for the delivery of 200 pieces ID lace lanyard with digital 
print. Payment was debited to the Accounts Payable account under JEV-2020-02-000785. 
However, the covering payable for the delivery and acceptance of these items on December 
26, 2019 was not set up, resulting in the overstatement of Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) 
and understatement of Accounts Payable account by ₱15,600.00. 

 
56. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to 
prepare the necessary adjusting entries to record deliveries of supplies of ₱15,600.00. 
 
57. In summary, the total misstatements in the Cash, Receivables, Inventories, PPE 
and Other Assets accounts of the PHIVOLCS amounting to ₱144.235 million represent 
11.10 percent of its total assets of ₱1,299.570 million as at December 31, 2020. Due to the 
significant impact of the misstatements on the FSs, we rendered a Qualified Opinion on 
the FSs of the agency as at year-end. 
 

Accounting Deficiencies 

 
58. We also noted some accounting deficiencies, which affected the reported balances 
of the accounts in the FSs, as follows: 
 

a) Inaccurate CIB-LCCA account balance 
 

59. The accuracy of the CIB-LCCA account balance of ₱42.989 million was 
affected by the inclusion of dormant non-existent Philippine National Bank (PNB) 
account of ₱90,396.42 and unrecognized payments for custom duties and taxes of 
various imported equipment of undetermined amount. Likewise, the non-submission 
of BRS for Bureau of Customs (BOC) bank account further rendered the account 
balance unreliable.  
 
60. Section 74 of PD 1445 requires the reconciliation between the balances per bank 
and agency books. While Sections 6 and 7, Chapter 21 of the GAM, Volume I further 
require the Chief Accountant to prepare a JEV to recognize all reconciling items that 
require adjustments and corrections in the books of accounts and to submit the BRSs within 
20 days after receipt of the monthly Bank Statement (BS). 

 
61. Moreover, Section 111 of PD 1445 evokes to observe the highest standards of 
honesty, objectivity and consistency in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against 
inaccurate or misleading information. 
 

a.1. Dormant and non-existent PNB bank balance of ₱90,396.42 
 
62. The dormant/non-existent PNB account of ₱90,396.42 had already been observed 
in previous years. Despite our recommendation to request for its write-off with COA, the 
amount is still outstanding in the books as at year-end. According to Management, a copy 



45 
 

of the Statement of Account was requested from the PNB in CY 2019 to verify the 
outstanding bank balance and which shall serve as support for the planned request for write-
off. However, as of this report, Management has not received any response from the PNB. 
 

a.2. Unadjusted payments for customs duties and taxes 
 
63. As at December 31, 2020, the CIB-LCCA-BOC account with bank account no. 
0702-1057-90 disclosed a book balance of ₱42,604,085.48 while the confirmation reply 
from the LBP disclosed a year-end balance of ₱393,236.48; thereby, resulting in an 
unreconciled difference of ₱42,210,849.00, pertaining to unrecognized payments for 
customs duties and taxes of various imported scientific equipment that accumulated over 
the years. Actual disbursements from the account have not been adjusted to the appropriate 
asset/expense accounts upon delivery of equipment due to absence of supporting 
documents such as bank debit advice, IAR and PAR from the PS, to match the paid Letters 
of Credit (LC) for the cost of equipment against actual BOC charges for customs duties 
and taxes. Such charges are included in the cost of the equipment as provided in paragraph 
30 of IPSAS 17 which states that cost of an item of PPE comprises its purchase price, 
including import duties and non-refundable purchase taxes, among others.  
 
64. Attached to the JEVs in the transfer of funds from Modified Disbursement System 
(MDS) to CIB-LCCA, BOC account were copies of Disbursement Vouchers (DVs), 
Obligation Request and Status, PO and Duty and Revenue Tax Computation showing the 
amount to be transferred. However, upon electronic payment in the Payment Abstract 
Secure System version 5.0 (PASS 5) payment system of the BOC, the bank debit advice, 
showing the actual charges by BOC, was not provided by the PS as one of the bases of the 
AS in the recording of withdrawals from the account. This resulted in the difficulty in 
matching paid customs duties and taxes against related costs of delivered equipment, as the 
actual payments in the PASS 5 payment system were different from the amount transferred 
to the CIB-LCCA account due to changes in foreign exchange rates. It was only in CY 2019 
that a copy of the bank debit advice was forwarded by the PS to AS; thus, the corresponding 
adjustments were prepared by the AS for some deliveries. 
 
65. Further verification of records disclosed that out of ₱28,836,900.00 transferred 
funds to the CIB-LCCA, BOC account from CYs 2018-2020, the amount of ₱10,024,151.00 
had corresponding deliveries of PPE as verified from the copies of IARs received by the 
Audit Team. Breakdown is shown in Table 7.

Total Technical and Scientific Equipment 70,453,594.93 10,024,151.00   

 
66. Inquiry with the AS revealed that costs of the above equipment were still not 
adjusted in the books due to lack of submitted copies of PAR, IAR and bank debit advice 
by the PS. Although the aggregate cost in the DLC of ₱70,453,594.93 and CIB-LCCA, 
BOC of ₱10,024,151.00 may not be the final charges to the two (2) accounts and may still 
differ due to foreign currency conversions, the combined amount indicates a material 
misstatement in the FSs. No alternative procedures can be adopted by the Audit Team to 
resolve the huge unreconciled amount of ₱42,210,849.00 since no BRS was ever submitted 
by the AS for this account.  
 
67. Considering the dormant/non-existent PNB account, unsupported bank 
disbursements for customs duties and taxes, and unsubmitted BRS, the accuracy of the 
CIB-LCCA balances as at year-end could not be relied upon. 

 
68. We recommended and Management agreed to require: 

 
a. The PS to provide the AS a copy of all bank debit advices for all 

disbursements made out of the CIB-LCCA account for the immediate 
recording of unbooked customs duties and taxes to the appropriate PPE 
accounts; 

 
b. The AS to: 

 
i. Analyze and reconcile CIB-LCCA, BOC Subsidiary Ledger (SL) 

based on bank debit advices provided by the PS and prepare 
necessary adjustments to reflect the correct balances of the affected 
accounts; 
 

ii. Prepare and submit monthly BRS on time to ensure all cash 
transactions are identified, documented and recorded in the books; 
and 
 



47 
 

iii. Request write-off of the unaccounted difference of ₱90,396.42 
between the books of accounts and the PNB records, which were 
considered dormant, following the guidelines in Item III.10 of COA 
Circular No. 97-001. 

 
b) Issues affecting Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit (TAD) accounts 

 
69. The year-end balances of Cash-TAD accounts are unreliable due to the error 
of the Cashier in reporting collections of ₱8,309.50 in the Trust Fund, and 
misclassification of deposits to the National Treasury of ₱9.557 million in the Regular 
Agency Fund (RA), ₱7.192 million of which were dormant and long outstanding. 
 
70. As defined in GAM, Volume III and COA Circular No. 2020-001 dated January 8, 
2020 which provides the adoption of the Revised Chart of Accounts for National 
Government Agencies, Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, Regular is used to recognize the 
amount of collections remitted to the BTr under the General Fund, either directly or through 
the Authorized Agent Banks (AABs) and Authorized Government Depository Banks 
(AGDBs). On the other hand, Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, Trust is used to recognize 
the trust receipts/collections and trust funds remitted to the BTr and adjustments for lapsed 
NCA.  

 
71. The Treasury/Agency Cash accounts of the agency consisting of Cash-
Treasury/Agency Deposit, Regular (Cash-TAD, Regular) and Cash-Treasury/Agency 
Deposit, Trust (Cash-TAD, Trust) with a year-end balance of ₱29,199,112.56 disclosed 
that the two (2) accounts were used inappropriately in the recording of cash remittances to 
the BTr. For the Trust Fund, remittance of ₱8,309.50 was erroneously recorded to Cash- 
TAD, Regular while for Regular Agency Fund, cash deposit of ₱9,557,382.28 was entered 
to Cash-TAD, Trust account, as shown in Table 8: 

 
Table 8. Composition of Cash-TADs account 

 
72. The amount of ₱8,309.50 pertained to the remittance to the BTr of the excess 
payments for electronic fund transfer/telegraphic transfer from the Grants-in-aid (GIA) 
projects, which was erroneously reported by the Cashier in the “List of Collection” as Fund 
101 or RA instead of Fund 184 or Trust; hence, this was inappropriately recorded in the 
Cash-TAD, Regular account under Trust Fund. 
 
73. On the other hand, we noted that the Regular Fund, Cash - TAD, Trust has a balance 
of ₱9,557,382.28 consisting of premature payments of disallowances for Longevity Pay 
and Collective Negotiation Agreement of ₱2,365,487.02 and a dormant account balance of 
₱7,191,895.26. The former pertains to disallowed employee benefits which were deducted 
immediately in advance to the final claims of resigned/retired liable employees despite the

absence of final and executory decisions issued by COA while the latter are non-moving 
cash balances for more than four (4) years comprising of: (i) collections of performance 
security/bond from suppliers of ₱96,149.23, (ii) unadjusted cash balances from various 
GIA projects of ₱3,848,998.71 since the adoption of Fund Cluster Accounting, and (iii) 
₱3,228,133.32 unreconciled amount, in which ₱18,614.00 was added to the SL balance as 
CY 2018 adjustments for Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) related transactions from 
May 2009 to May 2016. However, doubts exist on the adjusted amount whether analysis 
of the account was performed to reconcile the balance or merely an account used for the 
settlement of BAC-related accounts. 

 
74. The inappropriate use of Cash-TAD accounts in the Regular and Trust Funds may 
result in misleading information of cash balances for the two (2) accounts. It can be noted 
that based on the accounts’ description provided in GAM, Volume III, the Cash-TAD, 
Regular only relates to remittances to the BTr for the General Fund, while Cash-TAD, Trust 
is used to report all remittances to the BTr for trust receipts/collections which should be 
reported under Trust Fund. 

 
75. It should be emphasized that proper account classification is essential as it serves 
as a basis in the reconciliation of the remittances to the BTr, particularly in accounting for 
revenues/proceeds due to the National Government as well as trust receipts and funds 
which are intended for multi-year projects where corresponding NCAs are continuously 
requested until the completion of the project. 

 
76. We recommended and Management agreed to require: 
 

a. The Cashier to observe prudence in the reporting of cash remittances to 
the BTr; and 
 

b. The Accountant to: 
 

i. exert efforts to analyze and verify the dormant balances of 
₱7,191,895.26, and make the necessary adjustments in the books to 
correct the balance in the Cash-TAD, Trust account; and 
 

ii. observe the account classification prescribed in the GAM, and 
immediately prepare the adjusting journal entries for the 
misclassified account balances in the RA and Trust Funds. 

 
c) Unconfirmed hazard assessment fees – ₱0.030 million 

 
77. The failure of the Agency to provide a list of collections for hazard assessment 
fees which were directly deposited to the account of the BTr resulted in unconfirmed 
bank deposits of ₱30,830.00 by the National Treasury. 
 



49 
 

78. Section 74 of PD 1445 requires the Head of the Agency to see to it that 
reconciliation is made between the balance shown in the monthly reports of depositories 
and the balance found in the books of the agency. 
 
79. The Agency maintains Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) Account No. 3402-
2680-33 for the remittance of collections to the BTr.  Comparison of the confirmation reply 
from the BTr against the amount recorded in the books disclosed that deposits aggregating 
₱30,830.00 were not reflected in the BTr’s Daily List of National Collection for CY 2020. 
A summary is presented in Table 9, while the details are shown in Annex A.

80. Due to the new normal system brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, 
government transactions are mostly available online with corresponding fees paid using 
different online platforms. 
 
81. In this connection, a public notice was issued by the Agency in their official website 
that payments for hazard assessment reports may be done through online fund transfer or 
over the counter deposit to the account of LBP-BTr. We commend Management for their 
efforts to help prevent the further spread of the COVID-19 virus by avoiding face-to-face 
transactions with its stakeholders. However, the detailed list of collections for hazard 
assessment fees which were directly deposited to the account of the BTr by the stakeholders 
was not provided by Management. The same was also not coordinated with the BTr for the 
easy identification of deposits in their bank account, resulting in unconfirmed bank deposits 
of ₱30,830.00 in the books of the National Treasury. 

 
82. Inquiry with BTr personnel revealed that only collections deposited by the 
Collecting Officer and payments through LDDAP-ADA could be confirmed or verified per 
their records. Deposits made through online payment scheme should be coordinated with 
the National Cash Accounting Division of BTr, a specific division in the BTr with access 
to Bank Statements.  

 
83. It is worth mentioning that said payment schemes were already suspended by 
Management. Other payment schemes such as cash remittance through LBC was resorted 
to instead. 



50 
 

 
84. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to 
provide the National Cash Accounting Division of the BTr a detailed list of collections, 
together with copies of the deposit slips or any proof of payment, to confirm the 
amount of ₱30,830.00 directly deposited by the stakeholders to the bank account of 
the PHIVOLCS through the BTr. 

 
85. Management commented that the agency has entered into a Memorandum of 
Agreement with LBP’s Payment Service Provider (PSP) to avail of the ePayment models 
offered by the bank and is still waiting for the installation of the link in the PHIVOLCS 
Website. 

 
d) Issues affecting Other Receivables 

 
86. The Other Receivables account balance as at December 31, 2020 of ₱1.118 
million included the amount of ₱0.958 million for a double paid retention fee, 
unliquidated fund transfers/travel advances, and unsupported dormant balances 
outstanding for over five (5) years in the books due to weak monitoring and 
enforcement of its liquidation/settlement and the failure to assess its collectability.  
 
87. As at December 31, 2020, the balance of Other Receivables account included 
deficiencies amounting to ₱957,747.51 and mainly consisted of the following items: 
 

d.1. Double Payment of Retention Fee 
 

88. In October 2014, the agency entered into a contract with Golden Vision 
Construction for the supply of labor and materials for the rehabilitation of roof at Taal 
Volcano Observatory. However, due to monitoring control lapses, the retention fee of 
₱142,222.60 was paid twice in June 2015 and March 2016. Inquiry with the Accountant 
revealed that the balance will be applied in the next construction project of the contractor, 
but as at year-end, no succeeding projects or demand letters have been issued to them for 
the settlement of refund. 
 

d.2. Unliquidated Fund Transfer and Travel Advances 
 

89. Section 7.4 of COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016 provides that 
the Accountant shall prepare aging of dormant receivables, unliquidated CAs, and fund 
transfers on a quarterly basis to support the request for write-off and indicate in the 
remarks column the existence of applicable conditions, among others: 
 

• Absence of records or documents to validate/support the claim and/or 
unreconciled reciprocal accounts. 

• Exhaustion of all possible remedies by the Management to collect the receivables 
and to demand liquidation of CAs and fund transfers. 
 



51 
 

90. Records showed that since August 2014, PHIVOLCS had other receivables from 
Philippine Council for Industry, Energy and Emerging Technology Research and 
Development (PCIEERD) amounting to ₱611,523.67 representing transfer of funds in the 
implementation of the Dynaslope Project. Confirmation with PCIEERD, however, 
disclosed that said amount was not recorded in their books as at June 2020. To validate, we 
issued an audit query on October 27, 2020, seeking information on Management’s basis in 
the recording of this fund transfer and the subsequent actions taken by Management to 
demand liquidation/settlement of the amount due. In a reply letter dated December 29, 
2020, Management commented that they are in the process of completing the required 
documents to prove the validity of the claims and any submitted documents to report the 
balance. Further, we requested in the same query the copies of demand letters issued for 
unliquidated travel advances to resigned employees amounting to ₱11,710.00 but 
Management informed us that drafted letters are still to be mailed to the respective 
addressees indicated in the 201 file/Contract of Service.  
 
91. With the availability of information such as name of payee, amount and nature of 
receivables, it is believed that there is weak monitoring and lack of effort on the part of 
Management in the enforcement of its liquidations/settlements since the amounts were 
dormant and long-outstanding in the books for six (6) years to eight (8) years. Likewise, 
the absence of issued demand letters to defaulting payees proved that measures were not 
adequately taken to assess the collectability of the receivable balances. 
 

d.3. Unsupported dormant balances in the e-NGAs 
 

92. Section 4(6) of PD 1445 states that “Claims against government funds shall be 
supported with complete documentation.” 
 
93. Further, included in the SLs of Other Receivables account are receivables 
amounting to ₱192,091.24 which have been outstanding and dormant for more than eight 
(8) years, composed mainly of prior years’ balances transferred from the manual 
accounting system to the e-NGAs. Said balances were set up as beginning balances from 
CY 2012 transactions and earlier with no details or documents to support their validity, 
thus, remained for reconciliation as at year-end. 
 
94. The continuous negligence of Management in the enforcement of the liquidation of 
these receivables and the corresponding lapse of time would only increase the difficulty of 
its settlement and collectability, further resulting in its dormancy and impairment which 
affect the fair presentation of the FSs as to the accuracy of the balance reported. 

 
95. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to: 

 
a. Justify why the double paid retention fee shall not be disallowed in audit; 

 
b. Send demand letter to concerned supplier for the collection/settlement of 

double paid retention fee; 
  



52 
 

c. Demand the submission of liquidation reports (LR) on unliquidated fund 
transfers and travel advances;  
 

d. Exert efforts to locate the documents to support the details/information of 
dormant account balances; and 
 

e. Request for authority to write off dormant receivables following the 
provisions of COA Circular No. 2016-005. 

 
96. Management commented that the Accountant, in coordination with the PS, is 
retrieving all available documents on file to support the demand letter for the refund of the 
double paid retention fee to Golden Vision Construction. For the unliquidated transfer of 
project funds, a request letter was sent to PCIEERD on February 2, 2021 for the submission 
of necessary supporting documents for the settlement of the account balance. 
 
97. On the other hand, the AS is exerting efforts to retrieve all the documents related 
to dormant accounts before the implementation of the e-NGAS in CY 2016, particularly 
those accounts in CY 2012 and earlier. Documents previously kept by the AS in the 
basement area were destroyed during the flashflood caused by Typhoon Ondoy. Digital 
files stored in old diskettes that might be useful were retrieved; however, PCs with diskette 
drives are no longer available.   
 
98. As a rejoinder, as of April 2021, we have not yet received the required justification 
on the double paid retention fee. Thus, Management must exert more effort in the collection 
of said retention fee to supplier to prevent disallowance in audit. 
 

e) Deficiencies affecting PPE accounts 
 

99. The existence and accuracy of the PPE account balances could not be 
ascertained due to: (a) continued inclusion of obsolete and unserviceable properties 
in the books and Report of Physical Count of PPE (RPCPPE) of undetermined 
amount, (b) unrecognized damaged property during volcanic eruption with an 
estimated amount of not less than ₱6.438 million, and (c) existence of abnormal/ 
negative SL balances of ₱6.853 million. 
 
100. Section 7, Chapter 19 of the GAM for National Government Agencies (NGAs), 
Volume I states that: “FSs shall present fairly the financial position, financial performance 
and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the 
effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with the definitions and 
recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in IPSASs. The 
application of IPSASs, with additional disclosures when necessary, is presumed to result 
in FSs that achieve a fair presentation”. (Par. 27, IPSAS 1). 

 
101. Analysis of the PPE accounts during the year disclosed the following deficiencies: 

 



53 
 

e.1. Continued inclusion of obsolete and unserviceable properties in the books and 
RPCPPE 

 
102. Sections 39 and 40, Chapter 10 of the GAM, Volume I provide that “All 
unserviceable property shall be reported in the Inventory and Inspection Report of 
Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) which will serves as the basis in derecognizing the 
unserviceable properties carried in the PPE accounts. The cost of the PPE together with 
the related accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss shall be removed 
from the accounts. A JEV shall be prepared by the Accounting Division/Unit to derecognize 
the asset from the books of accounts only after its disposal”. 
 
103. For CY 2020, unserviceable PPE of undetermined amount were still included in the 
books of accounts despite its disposal in CY 2019. The descriptions of disposed PPE in the 
prepared IIRUP were listed in general terms and lack significant information such as unit 
costs and property numbers for easy identification of items in the PPELC by the AS.  
Proceeds from the sale of these unserviceable PPE were recorded as miscellaneous income 
while the costs of PPE together with the related Accumulated Depreciation were not 
dropped from the books contrary to the provisions under Section 39, Chapter 10 of the 
GAM, Volume I. The details of the disposal are shown in Table 10 below:

104. The Property Officer commented that they are having difficulty in the preparation 
of completely filled-up IIRUP due to lack of records in prior years’ acquisitions of PPE. 
Thus, the continuous inclusion of disposed obsolete and unserviceable properties in the 
books and RPCPPE resulted in the overstatement of the PPE accounts of undetermined 
amount. 
 
105. We recommended and Management agreed to require the PS to prepare the 
IIRUP with complete information on acquisition costs and property numbers and 
submit a copy to the AS as basis in the dropping from the books of the unserviceable 
properties.  
 
106. Management commented that the PS is currently working on the list of PPE with 
complete details such as property number and cost; however, Memorandum 



54 
 

Receipts/AREs/PARs in the prior years were not properly filled up by the Accountable 
Officers (AOs) causing difficulty in determining the cost of those PPEs. 
 

e.2. Unrecognized damaged properties during volcanic eruption with an estimated 
amount of not less than ₱6,437,958.30 

 
107. Appendix 75 of the GAM, Volume II prescribed the use of the form “Report of 
Lost, Stolen, Damaged, Destroyed Property (RLSDDP) which shall be used by the AO to 
report or notify the auditor of the COA, the Chief Accountant and all others concerned of 
the lost, stolen, damaged or destroyed property. All documents pertaining to the said 
property shall be attached to this form. It shall be prepared in four copies distributed as 
follows: 
 

Original- Chief Accountant for JEV preparation 
Copy 2- COA Auditor (as required by Sec. 71(3) of PD 1445) 
Copy 3- Property Officer 
Copy 4- Accountable Officer for file 
 

108. During the eruption of the Taal Volcano on January 12, 2020, several equipment/ 
instruments with an estimated amount of not less than ₱6,437,958.30 were damaged. Said 
PPE were not yet derecognized in the books and were still included in the RPCPPE as of 
December 31, 2020. A partial list of damaged equipment/ instruments was provided by the 
Volcano Monitoring and Eruption Prediction Division (VMEPD) to the PS, with summary 
in Table 11 and details in Annex B:

109. Notably, only the general terms and quantities were the information provided by 
the AOs, other details such as property numbers were not available, thus, cross referencing 
with the RPCPPE was difficult. We initiated the costing of the damaged equipment based 
on the RPCPPE submitted by the PS. Out of 96 reported items, only 38 or 40 percent were 
identified to have similar item descriptions in the RPCPPE and an estimated cost of 
₱6,437,958.30 was arrived at. 
 
110. The non-recording of above damaged equipment was due to the non-submission of 
the required form RLSDDP by the concerned AOs, which is the basis of the Accountant in 
the dropping of damaged properties from the books of accounts. The partial list provided 
by the VMEPD to the PS in August 2020 contained insufficient information as to the 
property numbers of the PPE, hindering the proper derecognition of damaged properties 
from the books. 

 
111. We recommended and Management agreed to require: 
 

a. The VMEPD to provide a detailed list of damaged properties with 
complete property numbers for easy identification in the Property Cards 
of the PS; and 
 

b. The Accountant to enjoin the AOs concerned to submit four (4) copies of 
duly notarized RLSDDP and distribute the same following the schedule 
provided in Appendix 75 of the GAM, Volume II. 

 
112. Management commented that it took a while for the VMEPD to provide a list of 
damaged properties since the areas where the equipment are installed were declared 
restricted while the volcano was on Alert Level 2.  They also tried to check on the status 
of some of the equipment which may not be totally damaged. All documents necessary to 
recognize the damaged properties will be compiled for submission to COA. 
 
 
 
 
 



56 
 

e.3. Existence of abnormal/negative balances  
 

113. Section 111(2) of PD 1145 provides that “The highest standards of honesty, 
objectivity and consistency shall be observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard 
against inaccurate or misleading information.” 
 
114. Verification of the PPELC disclosed the inclusion of abnormal/negative carrying 
amounts of various PPE totaling ₱6,852,850.98, the details of which are shown in Table 
12:

115. For the Furniture and Fixtures account, JEV No. 2020-06-001416 dated June 18, 
2020 was drawn to adjust various semi-expendable inventories erroneously recorded into 
the account in the acquisition cost of ₱72,413.40. However, the related Accumulated 
Depreciation of ₱46,876.01 was not adjusted resulting in negative carrying value in the 
PPELC for the same amount. Meanwhile, for the TSE account, the negative/abnormal 
balance was due to unreliable acquisition costs provided in the PPELC, with equipment 
costed at zero and ₱29,760.00 (see Acquisition Cost in Table 12). 
 
116. We recommended and Management agreed to require the AS to: 
 

a. Prepare adjusting entry to reclassify the abnormal PPELC balance in the 
Furniture and Fixtures account by debiting Accumulated Depreciation of 
₱46,876.01 and crediting Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) for the same 
amount; and 
 



57 
 

b. Check the acquisition costs posted in the negative PPELC for STE in the 
original source documents and prepare necessary adjusting entries to 
reflect the correct balance of the account in the PPELC. 

 
f) Unreliable balance of DLC account – ₱100.538 million 

 
117. Deposit on Letters of Credit (DLC) of ₱100.538 million remained outstanding 
in the books for more than one (1) year to seven (7) years due to the non-submission 
of IAR and other delivery documents to the AS by the PS rendering the account 
balances unreliable and inaccurate. 
 
118. The Conceptual Framework for General Purpose Financial Reporting, IPSAS 1 
provides that “Under the accrual basis of accounting, transactions and other events are 
recognized in FSs when they occur (and not only when cash or its equivalent is received 
or paid). Therefore, the transactions and events are recorded in the accounting records 
and recognized in the FSs of the periods to which they relate.” 

 
119. Verification of records disclosed that not all disbursement vouchers in the opening 
of LCs were supported with IARs and delivery documents due to the failure of the PS to 
provide copies of the same to the AS. Inspection revealed that DLC aggregating 
₱100,538,065.50 remained outstanding in the books for more than one (1) year to seven 
(7) years without the covering IAR and other delivery documents submitted to the AS and 
the Audit Team, thus, casting doubts whether deliveries had been made or not. The details 
are in Table 13:

120. As an alternative audit procedure, the above items were verified against the 
summary of IARs received by the Audit Team from September 2015 to the present and we 
noted that the above importations were not included in the list.  This situation violates 
Section 6.06 of COA Circular No. 95-006 dated May 18, 1995 which provides that “the 
official responsible for or in charge of accepting deliveries of procured items shall, within 
24 hours from such acceptance, notify the auditor of the time and date of the scheduled 
deliveries, and Section 20, Chapter 10 of the GAM, Volume 1 requiring the immediate 
recording of PPE after inspection and acceptance on the basis of the IAR and other 
supporting documents. To further check the reliability of transactions, check payments 
were confirmed against prior years’ bank statements and we noted that amounts were 
deducted from the bank balance on the following dates:

121. Thus, the continuous existence of balances outstanding in the DLC account for one 
(1) year to seven (7) years is not only contrary to the GAM provisions requiring the 
immediate recording of deliveries in the books after inspection and acceptance on the basis 
of the IAR and supporting documents, but also rendered the account balances as at year-
end doubtful, hence, the reiteration in the current year’s audit.  
 
122. Further verification of transactions revealed that the amount of ₱1,684,807.28 was 
credited to the DLC account during the year for cash received from the LBP representing 
excess payments in the opening of LC as Management’s compliance on the previous year’s 
observation, with details as follows:  



59 
 

 

Table 15. Refunds on Issued DLC 

 
123. It can be inferred from the refunds received from the excess payments of LCs that 
the terms and conditions in the LCs had been met such as the complete delivery of the 
items since the bank will only facilitate refunds and fund transfers to suppliers upon full 
delivery of the equipment. 
 
124. Although much time and effort are needed to retrieve all the IARs and other 
supporting documents considering that importations took place more than a year ago, the 
continuous neglect in the recognition of these deliveries and the corresponding lapse of 
time will only increase the difficulty in recording the same and may also result in the 
dormancy of the account. 

 
125. We recommended and Management agreed to require: 
 

a. The Property Section to: 
 

i. Prepare four (4) copies of IAR on a regular basis to document 
inspection and acceptance of deliveries and strictly comply with the 
provisions of Appendix 62 of the GAM, Volume II regarding proper 
distribution of copies; 

 
ii. Exert efforts to provide copies of the IAR and other proofs of 

deliveries to the AS for the DLC balance of ₱100,538,065.50; 
thereafter, regularly comply with the GAM provisions on the regular 
submission to the AS of the IAR and other supporting documents for 
immediate recording in the books; and 

 
iii. Ensure that all deliveries are supported with IAR and submit the 

same to the Auditor within 24 hours after acceptance thereof; and

b. The Accountant to: 
 

i. Prepare the necessary adjustments in the books of accounts once the 
IAR and other supporting delivery documents for the DLCs with a 
balance of ₱100,538,065.50 become available; and 

 
ii. Provide the covering depreciation for the delivered equipment based 

on the dates of deliveries, and make the necessary adjustments to 
reflect the correct carrying amount of PPE in the FSs. 

 
126. Management commented that the PS was instructed to ensure that supporting 
documents related to delivery of procured items must be submitted to the Auditor within 
24 hours.   
 
127. As a rejoinder, the IAR, in whatever form of deliveries, is absolutely necessary. It 
is the form used to report the result of the inspection made by the Authorized Inspector on 
the deliveries and the status of the accepted items by the Property Custodian. Thus, the PS 
must exert efforts in securing the IAR and other delivery documents of those long-
outstanding and unliquidated DLCs with a total amount of ₱100,538,065.50 since the 
absence of these documents render the deliveries of imported equipment unreliable and 
doubtful. 
 

g) Issues affecting Cash Advances (CA) 
 

128. CAs totaling ₱4.947 million remained unliquidated as of December 31, 2020 
due to the failure of the AOs to immediately submit necessary documents and refund 
any excess/unexpended balance of CAs at the end of the year, contrary to Section 5 of 
COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997. Moreover, additional CAs were 
granted to AOs even with previous unliquidated CAs. 
 
129. As of December 31, 2020, the reported balance of CAs amounted to ₱4,947,093.03, 
of which ₱4,714,018.28 or 95.29 percent remained outstanding for 31 days to more than a 
year, as summarized in Table 16:

130. As shown in Table 16, majority of the CAs pertain to those drawn by officers and 
employees purposely for their travel allowances during field works. It is worth mentioning 
that several employees have liquidated their outstanding CAs in compliance with the 
demand letters issued by the Audit Team in October 2020. However, deficiencies were still 
noted in the granting and liquidation of CAs as discussed below: 
 
  g.1. Unliquidated Cash Advances as at year-end – ₱4.947 million 

 
131. Analysis of CAs for the year disclosed that CAs have an initial balance of 
₱5,626,479.59, an aggregate amount of ₱14,188,841.18 was granted, of which the amount 
of ₱14,868,227.74 was settled, thereby leaving an unliquidated balance of ₱4,947,093.03. 
Records of grants and liquidations showed the following:

132. As shown in Table 17, 85% of the CAs granted in the current year were liquidated 
while 50% of the prior year’s balance was settled during the year. The increase in 
liquidation rates can be attributed to the combined efforts of Management and the Audit 
Team through constant follow-ups and issuance of demand letters. Management disclosed 
that accumulation of balances was caused by the delayed liquidation of CAs due to the late 
submission of supporting documents and unrefunded excess/unexpended balance of CAs, 
which is not in accordance with the liquidation timelines set in Section 5 of COA Circular 
No. 97-002, as stated below: 
 

5.1.2 Field Operating Expenses - within twenty (20) days after the end of the year; 
subject to replenishment as frequently as necessary during the year. 

5.1.3 Official Travel - within sixty (60) days after return to the Philippines in the 
case of foreign travel or within thirty (30) days after return to his permanent 
official station in the case of local travel. 

5.8 All cash advances shall be fully liquidated at the end of each year. Except for 
petty cash fund, the AO shall refund any unexpended balance to the Cashier/ 
Collecting Officer who will issue the necessary official receipt. 

133. Management averred that due to the series of field works of AOs and the sensitivity 
and urgency of the operations of the agency, several CAs were not liquidated within the 
prescribed period. However, PHIVOLCS should not only focus on the technical aspect of 



62 
 

its operations but instead, should also give equal importance to the financial aspect 
specifically on the liquidation of CAs. As provided in Section 5.9 of the same COA 
Circular, when no liquidation of the previous CA is received on or before January 20 of 
the ensuing year, the Accountant shall cause the withholding of the AOs salary.  
 
134. As a result, the corresponding expenditures were not taken up in the books, thereby, 
affecting the accuracy of the related expense accounts. Further, the unused CA balance in 
the custody of the AOs may be exposed to possible loss or misuse. 
 

g.2. Granting of additional CAs to AOs with previous CAs 
 

135. Further scrutiny of CA transactions revealed that additional CAs were granted to 
officials and employees without first settling or rendering proper accounting of previous 
CAs as required in Section 4.1.2 of COA Circular No. 97-002, which states that no 
additional CAs shall be allowed to any official or employee unless the previous CA given 
to him is first settled or a proper accounting thereof is made, resulting in the accumulation 
of the CA balances. 
 
136. The granting of numerous CAs for travel piled up the cash in the hands of the AO 
may be susceptible to misuse of funds and may also lead to difficulty in the safekeeping of 
supporting documents.  

 
137. We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 
a. Require the AOs to fully liquidate their CAs as soon as the purpose for 

which it was granted has been served through the submission of the 
liquidation documents and the corresponding official receipts evidencing 
refund of the unexpended/excess balances at the end of each year; and 
 

b. Stop the practice of granting additional CAs to AOs with unliquidated 
advances to prevent accumulation of balances. 

 
138. Management commented that the practice of granting additional CA to AOs with 
unliquidated CAs for travel cannot be totally stopped, particularly if the nature of the travel 
is emergency, in response to earthquake occurrences or volcanic eruptions. They also 
reminded AOs that the next step to be done for non-liquidation of CA for travel is the 
withholding of their salaries.   
 
139. As a rejoinder, the granting of additional CAs for travel to AOs with previous CAs 
may only be permitted on justifiable reasons but Management must ensure that controls on 
monitoring and timely liquidation of CAs are properly functioning.

h) Unreverted Accounts Payables aged more than two (2) years 
 

140. Accounts Payables of ₱16,147.29, which have been outstanding for over two (2) 
years, were not reverted to the General Fund of the National Government, contrary 
to Section 98 of PD 1445 and Section 1 of EO 87 dated August 14, 2019.  
  
141. Section 98 of PD 1445 states that “The Commission upon notice to the head of 
agency concerned may revert to the unappropriated surplus of the general fund of the 
national government, any unliquidated balance of accounts payable in the books of the 
national government, which has been outstanding for two years or more and against which 
no actual claim, administrative or judicial, has been filed or which is not covered by 
perfected contracts on record.” 

 
142. The same is reiterated under Section 1 of Executive Order No. 87 dated August 14, 
2019 which provides that “All documented accounts payable for fiscal year 2016 and years 
prior thereto shall be reverted to the Accumulated Surplus or Deficit of the General Fund 
or the Cumulative Result of Operations of the National Government. Henceforth, all 
documented accounts payable which remain outstanding for at least two years, for which 
no actual administrative or judicial claim has been filed, shall be subject to automatic 
reversion.”  

 
143. Review of the Accounts Payable account showed that four (4) SLs, totaling 
₱16,147.29 were outstanding for more than two (2) years and not reverted to the 
Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) account of the general fund pursuant to the afore-cited 
regulations. Details are shown in Table 18: 
 

Table 18. Accounts Payable outstanding for over two years

Overtime pay for the period April 1-30, 2017   2017-12-007875 2,469.27 

Total  16,147.29 

 
144. Inquiry from the AS revealed that the long-outstanding overtime pay of ₱16,147.29 
was due to failure of the payees to complete the appropriate documents needed, thus, 
payments could not be made.  
 
145. Nonetheless, the above-stated condition is contrary to Section 98 of PD 1445 and 
Section 1 of EO 87 dated August 14, 2019, thus, affecting the fair presentation and 
reliability of the FSs. 
 
146. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to 
prepare the necessary adjusting entries to revert to the Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) 
account the payables of ₱16,147.29 which have been outstanding for more than two 
(2) years. 

 



64 
 

147. Adjusting entries with JEV Nos. 2021-03-646 to 649 were prepared by the 
Accountant to reverse the noted deficiency in Accounts Payable.  
 

i) Unreliable balance of Due to NGAs account 
 

148. Lack of coordination by PHIVOLCS in the submission of liquidation reports 
among Source Agencies (SAs) is not only contrary to pertinent provisions of Sections 
4.6 and 6.5 of COA Circular No. 94-013, but also resulted in unreliable balance of 
Due to NGAs account. Further, the improper posting of transactions in the account 
resulted in negative SL balance of ₱0.422 million, thus, affecting the fair presentation 
and reliability of the FSs. 

 
149. Sections 4.6 and 6.5 of COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994, 
prescribing the Rules and Regulations in the Grant, Utilization and Liquidation of Funds 
Transferred to Implementing Agencies (IAs), provide that: 

 
“4.6. Within ten (10) days after the end of each month/end of the agreed period for 

the Project, the IA shall submit the Report of Checks Issued (RCI) and the 
Report of Disbursement (RD) to report the utilization of the funds.  Only 
actual project expenses shall be reported.  The reports shall be approved by 
the Head of the IA. 

 
6.5 The Accountant shall verify the Reports, provide accounting entries, record and 

submit the duplicate copies of the Reports with all the originals of 
vouchers/payrolls and all supporting documents to the IA Auditor.  The 
Accountant shall ensure that only expenses for the project are included in the 
Reports.  He shall submit the original copy of the Reports to the SA (Attention: 
The SA Accountant).” 

 
150. As of December 31, 2020, the FSs showed Due to NGAs with a balance of 
₱48,097,821.56 and comprised the following amounts:

151. Review and analysis of the accounting records to confirm the validity of the account 
balance revealed deficiencies as follows:  
 
 
 
 



65 
 

 i.1. Lack of coordination in the submission of liquidation reports among SAs  
 

152. The Due to NGAs account is composed of unliquidated fund transfers from SAs, 
mainly DOST-CO and PCIEERD, in the implementation of various research projects 
relevant to the mandates of the Agency. Confirmation letters were electronically mailed to 
two (2) SAs on February 12, 2021 to verify the correctness of the amount presented in the 
books; however, only the DOST-CO responded on March 5, 2021 but without details on 
the recorded transactions for the year. As an alternative audit procedure, we requested the 
assistance of the COA Audit Teams assigned in the SAs for a copy of the SLs from the e-
NGAS of their respective auditees. Comparison of SLs revealed that as at year-end, the 
two (2) SAs have a combined receivable balance of ₱110,367,960.69 from the PHIVOLCS, 
hence, a discrepancy of ₱65,051,676.07 was noted against the book balance of 
₱45,316,284.62. Details are presented below:

only the amount of ₱26,927,473.45 was recognized in the books of the SAs, hence a 
combined unrecorded expense of ₱47,112,748.28 was registered for the two (2) SAs 
(details in Annex D). This is due to the lack of coordination by PHIVOLCS on the 
submission of liquidation documents and monitoring of projects among SAs. Copies of 
RCI with corresponding JEV entries were not forwarded to the Accountant of SAs as 
required in Sections 4.6 and 6.5 of COA Circular No. 94-013; hence, liquidation entries on 
the utilization of transferred funds were not fully recognized in the books of SAs. Instead, 
the amount recorded in the books of SAs as project expenses were based on progress 
financial reports submitted by project staff members which were inaccurate due to 
unreported depreciation on project’s equipment and undeducted refunds on granted CAs.  



67 
 

155. Review of Progress Financial Reports revealed that copies of the reports were 
regularly submitted to SAs with stamp received as proof of submission. Though at a glance, 
it may be inferred that Management complied with the submission of reportorial 
requirements with SAs, however, PCIEERD’s Accountant commented in her reply last 
year on confirmation letter that copies of financial reports were not forwarded to them. 
Further, as mentioned in paragraph 16, Part 2 of CY 2019 DOST Consolidated Annual 
Audit Report,  expenditures in some Financial Reports (FRs) were not recorded in their 
books due to: (a) FRs were not yet submitted or forwarded by the NGA/IAs or Monitoring 
Agencies (MA) to DOST-CO but liquidations were already recorded in the IA’s books of 
accounts, (b) some NGAs/IAs submitted the FRs, however, due to incomplete documentary 
requirements such as PAR, List of Equipment Purchased (LEP), the DOST- CO cannot 
process the liquidation. Thus, the reasons why majority of project expenses were not 
recorded in the books of SAs despite submission of FR, resulting in accumulated 
unrecorded expenses of ₱47,112,748.28 as at year-end. 
 
156. Moreover, equipment amounting to ₱5,691,988.00 was recorded in the books of 
SAs, which may imply that said equipment were already turned over to SA. However, 
inquiry with PHIVOLCS’ Accountant revealed that none of the equipment was neither 
donated to the PHIVOLCS nor turned over to the SAs; hence, casting doubts whether 
coordination on the correct status of GIA equipment were established and communicated 
among the involved agencies. Further, this situation is contrary to one of the provisions of 
Section 17, Chapter 10 of the GAM, Volume I which states that “The source agency/entity 
shall monitor the PPE purchased out of transferred funds to other government agencies 
but shall not record the PPE until it is returned by the implementing agency.” 
 
157. Taking into account these noted observations, the PHIVOLCS, being the IA and 
the agency entrusted to utilize project funds, must take the initiative to ensure accurate and 
prompt recording of project expenses in the books of SAs. Moreover, PHIVOLCS should 
not only focus on the proper implementation of the project but should also give equal 
importance to its financial aspect. Regular coordination and reconciliation with SAs must 
be established and any adjustments to the reports must be communicated clearly. The noted 
discrepancies/errors or other reconciling items between them maybe promptly 
corrected/adjusted. 

 
158. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to: 
 

a. Closely coordinate with SAs regarding the status of ownership of PPEs 
purchased out of project funds and prepare necessary journal entries, if 
warranted; and 
 

b. Provide copies of recorded JEVs per project, together with copies of RCI 
and supporting documents, to the Accountants of SAs and reconcile with 
their records to establish the correct balance of Due to NGAs; henceforth, 
regularly coordinate and provide copies thereof to the Accountants of SAs. 

 



68 
 

159. The Management commented that the AS is coordinating with the SAs on the 
ownership of purchased PPEs out of project funds. For the DOST GIA-Funded Projects, 
the inventory of the equipment was conducted last 2019 and both PHIVOLCS and DOST 
agreed that the latter will make recommendations on the transfer of the properties and will 
send the necessary supporting documents for adjustments in the books of accounts.   
 
 i.2. Improper posting of transactions  
 
160. Further analysis of Due to NGAs account disclosed the existence of improper 
posting of transactions resulting in five (5) negative SL balances totaling ₱422,369.45. 
Four (4) of them are mainly composed of unsupported and unaccounted carry-over 
balances since the adoption of the e-NGAS in CY 2016, amounting to ₱189,585.50. While 
for the remaining SL, the abnormal balance originated from the August 2018 adjustments 
of Other Payables-PBAC account purportedly to match the balance against CIB-LCCA 
PBAC account. However, doubt still exists whether reconciliations were undertaken by the 
AS or merely reflected the adjustments to Due to NGAs account in the books, resulting in 
a negative balance of ₱(232,783.95). Breakdown is presented in Table 22:

161. The occurrence of negative balance in the books resulted from various accounting 
errors due to lapses in recording and lack of effort to investigate the same. The AS should 
immediately verify the causes and effect of the necessary adjustments in the books to 
reflect its true balance. Failure to do so may lead to prolonged dormancy of the account 
which may affect the fair presentation of the FSs.  
 
162. On the other hand, if proven that a valid receivable exists after thorough analysis 
of the account, the agency could demand the return of over-payments to concerned project 
leaders which may serve as additional sources of funds to the government. 

 
163. The foregoing deficiencies along with the underlying causes have been recurring 
audit observations. However, as per validation, no adjustments and/or corrections have 
been made. 

 
164. We reiterated our prior years’ recommendations and Management agreed to 
require the AS to: 

 
a. Make an in-depth analysis of the negative SL balance and prepare 

appropriate adjusting journal entries; and 



69 
 

 
b. Send demand letters to concerned project leaders for the collection of 

overpayments, if warranted. 
 
165. Management commented that the AS is working on the analysis of the negative SL 
balances based on the available hard copies and digital files.  However, some of these 
accounts have pending analysis/verifications due to incomplete supporting documents on 
file.    
 
Program Review 
 
166. The three (3) GIA projects implemented and completed by PHIVOLCS as at 
year-end have substantially achieved their respective objectives and have 
significantly contributed to the advancement of science and technology in the 
Philippines. However, deficiencies were noted in the monitoring and reportorial 
requirements on the projects’ implementation, such as (a) uninsured PPE of ₱0.966 
million, (b) understated project expenses reported in the Financial Reports (FR) of 
₱0.657 million, (c) unrefunded excess grants of ₱0.743 million, and (d) ₱0.439 million 
rent of motor vehicle for a continuous period of more than 15 days without the 
covering DBM authority. 
 
167. The Philippine archipelago is one of the most disaster-prone areas in the world. The 
location of the Philippines in the southern portion of the Pacific Ring of Fire where two (2) 
major tectonic plates (Philippine Sea and Eurasian) meet, makes it highly prone to 
earthquakes, and as a consequence, to tsunamis and volcanic eruptions. The Ring of Fire 
is an area in a 40,000 km-long horseshoe shape where a large number of earthquakes and 
volcanic eruptions occur as a direct result of movements and collisions of tectonic plates. 
It is home to over 75% of the world's active and dormant volcanoes; approximately 81% 
of the world's largest earthquakes occur along the Ring of Fire. 

 
168. Considering this, PHIVOLCS was created by the government as a service institute 
of the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) that is principally mandated to 
mitigate disasters that may arise from volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, tsunamis and other 
related geotectonic phenomena. 

 
169. In line with its mandates, three (3) GIA projects were implemented and completed 
by the agency as of December 31, 2020. These were funded by PCIEERD, one of the 
sectoral planning councils of the DOST. Details of the projects are presented in Table 23:

170. The Development of Information 
Gathering and Utilization Systems Using Small 
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for Disaster 
Risk Assessment, Monitoring and Response is a 
collaborative project between Philippines, Japan, 
Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam. For the Philippine 
research team, wherein PHIVOLCS is the 
participating agency, the main objective is to 
mainstream the application of UAV technology into 
the different aspects of disaster preparedness and risk 
mitigation researches of the Institute. The specific aim is for PHIVOLCS technical staff to 
acquire the expertise in the operation, assembly, configuration and maintenance of UAVs.  
 
171. Feature based Earthquake Analysis Toolset 
for Urban Response Estimation (FEATURE): 
Enhancing PHIVOLCS damage estimation 
capability using building-specific analysis aided by 
high resolution GIS data aims to develop a toolset 
for implementation of per building approach to urban 
area seismic response estimation. Modules of 
FEATURE toolset were developed to perform input 
data processing, time-history ground motion 
generation, building dynamic analysis, and post-
processing. 
 
172. Specific Earthquake Ground Motion 
Levels to Help Increase the Seismic Resiliency of 
Residential and Medium-to-High Rise Buildings 
in Metro Cebu and Metro Davao aims to enhance 
the capacity of PHIVOLCS personnel to the 
microtremor array measurements, seismic 
microzoning map of long-period site response in 
Metro Cebu and Davao, specific site amplification 
that is needed by the structural designers/engineers 
and realistic ground motion level that would affect 
the structures. The final product of this study is to 
provide seismic microzoning map specific for short-period and long-period waves in Metro 



71 
 

Cebu and Metro Davao. These maps have been compiled into Site Response Atlas and 
were turned over to the constituent local government units, government agencies and other 
stakeholders through workshops. The produced atlas can be incorporated into their Disaster 
Risk Mitigation Plan, Comprehensive Land Use Plans and Comprehensive Development 
Plans. 

 
173. The submitted terminal reports revealed that objectives for each project were 
substantially achieved. Although the latter part of the projects was affected by the COVID-
19 pandemic, the above three (3) projects registered the following accomplishments: 
 

 
 
174. The aforementioned projects have significantly contributed to the advancement of 
science and technology in the country and will definitely help stakeholders build safer and 
more disaster-resilient communities. We noted, however, several deficiencies in their 
compliance with the monitoring and reportorial requirements during the implementation of 
the projects as discussed in the succeeding paragraphs:

a) Uninsured Projects’ PPEs - ₱0.966 million 
 

175. In the implementation of the three (3) completed GIA Projects, necessary PPEs 
amounting to ₱1,165,541.98 were purchased out of inter-agency transferred funds. These 
were recorded in the books of PHIVOLCS in compliance with Section 17, Chapter 10 of 
the GAM, Volume I which states that for proper monitoring and accountability, the IA 
shall record and monitor the PPE purchased out of inter-agency transferred funds. The SA 
shall monitor the PPE purchased out of transferred funds to other government agencies 
but shall not record the PPE until it is returned by the IA.” Details are presented in Table 
24:

176. The above PPEs were still in the custody of PHIVOLCS under the accountability 
of Project Leaders per Acknowledgement Receipt of Equipment (ARE) until physical 
transfer/donation or disposition of ownership are executed as per Section 12 of the 
Memorandum of Agreement between the two agencies. Said equipment, however, were 
neither donated to PHIVOLCS nor turned over to PCIEERD as of this report.  
 
177. Moreover, the above PPEs consisting of ICTE of ₱906,022.00 and TSE of 
₱59,520.00 were unintentionally excluded from the CY 2020 GIA RPCPPE and list of 
PPEs insured with the General Insurance Fund of the GSIS under JEV-2020-09-002862 
dated September 7, 2020.  We also noted that during the implementation of these projects, 
the Project staff members did not pay any amount for the insurance coverage of the 
acquired PPE out of GIA funds due to the non-provision of insurance premiums in the line-
item budget of each project, contrary to Section 5 of RA 656 which states that the 
government must insure its properties with the Property Insurance Fund against any 
insurable risk such as damage to, or loss of, its properties due to fire, earthquake, storm or 
other casualty and pay the premiums thereon.  

 
178. The failure of Management to insure all of the projects’ insurable properties with 
the General Insurance Fund of the GSIS exposed the government to the risk of non-
recovery and/or non-indemnification in case of loss or damage. 

 
179. We recommended and Management agreed to require the concerned officials 
to include all PPE acquired out of GIA-Funded Projects in the RPCPPE and provide 
for GSIS insurance coverage pursuant to RA 656 by allocating the covering general 
insurance premiums in the Line-item budget. 

 



73 
 

180. Management commented that the PS has started the preparation of the RPCPPE for 
some of the GIA-Funded Projects. Likewise, coordination with the funding agency will be 
made for the transfer of the equipment purchased under the GIA-funded projects for proper 
recording and insurance purposes.   
 

b) Understated project expenses in the Financial Reports – ₱0.657 million 
 
181. Item 3.c of the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) provides that PHIVOLCS has 
an obligation to submit to PCIEERD the Quarterly Progress Report (DOST Form 3A) and 
Semi-Annual/Annual Financial Report (DOST Form 4) of grant certified by the Accounting 
Officer. 
 
182. Comparison of the total reported expenditures (column 13) in the Quarterly 
Progress Report (DOST Form 3A) and Semi-Annual/Annual Financial Report submitted 
to PCIEERD against the total recorded PPE and expenses in the books of accounts revealed 
that a net discrepancy of ₱757,034.78 exists for the three (3) projects. Detailed breakdown 
is shown in Table 25:

Variance 100,355.83 (40,113.54) 0.00 696,792.49 757,034.78 

 
183. Further analysis of the two (2) records revealed that variances were due to the 
following: 
 

1. Book error on the salary differential of contractual employees for the project 
“Specific EQ Ground Motion Level” amounting to ₱100,355.83 that should be 
charged to the project “Specific EQ Ground Motion Level in Pangasinan, Tarlac, 
Xxx;” 
 

2. Refunds of CAs of ₱40,113.54 directly remitted to the BTr as the amount reported 
in the Disbursement Column of the FR pertains only to the amount of CA granted 
and not the actual expenses incurred out of the CAs; and  
 



74 
 

3. Depreciation of ₱696,792.49 recorded in the books but not reported in the FRs since 
only cash expenses are considered in the FR. 

 
184. It bears stressing that FRs are the basis of SA in recording project expenditures. If 
within the IA’s records, the amounts reported in the FR and books are not reconciled, more 
so with the amounts recorded in the SA’s books. PHIVOLCS must ensure prompt 
reconciliation of the balances to permit accurate recording of the Inter-Agency Transfer of 
Fund’s transactions both in the books of PHIVOLCS and that of the SA. 
 
185. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant and the 
concerned Project Staff in the AS to immediately effect adjustments on the noted 
discrepancies to reconcile their respective records. After which, coordinate with 
PCIEERD regarding the adjustments made on the FRs to report the correct balances 
for each project.  
 
186. Management commented that the AS will review, reconcile and coordinate with the 
funding agency all the necessary adjustments to correct the FR balances. 
 

c) Unrefunded excess grants – ₱0.856 million 
 

187. Item 3.e of MOA provides that PHIVOLCS has an obligation to return to 
PCIEERD any unexpended balance of the grant fund within six (6) months after the project 
completion. 
 
188. Contrary to the above provision, we noted delays ranging from three (3) months to 
13 months in the return of the unexpended balance of ₱856,252.70 despite project 
completion. Details are in Table 26 below:

TOTAL  856,252.70  

 
189. As a procedure, PHIVOLCS must coordinate with PCIEERD for the final and 
correct amount of unexpended balance. Once established, a Notice of Cash Allocation 
(NCA) will be requested from the DBM to cover the amount to be refunded. Upon receipt 
of the NCA, the LDDAP-ADA will be prepared to facilitate the return of excess funds for 
deposit to the MDS account of the PCIEERD. Lastly, a certificate of deposited collection 
must be secured from the BTr to be presented to PCIEERD for the issuance of covering 
official receipt by the latter, which will serve as one of the supporting documents to the 
LDDAP-ADA. 
 



75 
 

190. Management commented that the NCA for the above unexpended balances were 
requested with the DBM; however, the same has not been released to PHIVOLCS as 
evidenced by NCA No. BMB-F-21-0001399.   
 
191. The unexpended balance of ₱856,252.70 which remained outstanding in the books 
as at year-end, despite that the purposes of the projects had already been served, affected 
the propriety and validity of the reported balance of Due to NGAs account.  

 
192. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to 
comply with the aforementioned procedures for the return of the unexpended balance 
of ₱856,252.70 and to prepare the necessary adjusting entry to close the excess grant 
funds in the Due to NGAs account. 
 

d) Rental of motor vehicle for a continuous period of more than 15 days even without 
the authority from DBM – ₱0.439 million 
 

193. Paragraph 3.3 of NBC No. 446, Series of 1995, implementing Section 76, Chapter 
7, Book VI of Executive Order No. 292 (Administrative Code of 1987) provides that no 
appropriations authorized in the General Appropriations Act shall be used for renting 
motor transport equipment for a continuous period of more than fifteen days, except as 
maybe authorized by the Secretary of DBM. 
 
194. COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012 defines “irregular 
expenditure” as an expenditure incurred without adhering to established rules, 
regulations, procedural guidelines, policies, principles or practices that have gained 
recognition in laws. Irregular expenditures are incurred if funds are disbursed without 
confirming with prescribed usages and rules of discipline.  

 
195. We verified compliance of the project “Specific Earthquake Ground Motion Level” 
and found that Project staff had contracted the services of different car rental companies 
for their Cebu and Davao field works. However, we noted that the amount of ₱439,004.73 
was paid to two (2) car rental companies for a continuous period of 19 days and 25 days, 
respectively, even without the covering authority from the DBM. The details are in Table

196. Under COA Decision No. 2009-007 dated February 9, 2009, a similar case of not 
securing authority from the DBM for rental contract of motor vehicle for more than 15 
days was disallowed in audit and the appeal of the person considered liable was denied. 
 
197. We recommended Management to submit their justification why the rental of 
motor vehicle exceeding the allowable 15 days will not be disallowed in audit. 

 
198. Management commented that the Specific Earthquake Project is a research-based 
project focused on determining local ground response in the event of an earthquake on two 
of the three major metropolitan areas of the Philippines, namely, Metro Cebu and Metro 
Davao.  The nature of the fieldwork and survey methodologies of this project greatly 
involves site-specific surveys, simultaneous and unhampered recordings, and series of 
survey sites transfer, which is why continuous fieldworks are necessary for more accurate 
data gathering phase. 

 
199. For cost efficiency, the project staff scheduled their fieldwork continuously to cover 
the target survey areas, rather than dividing each fieldwork into 15 days, which will also 
double the cost for local travel, particularly the cost of plane ticket. The project is on a 
limited duration and constantly being monitored by PCIEERD; thus, it would be more 
time-efficient to conduct continuous month-long fieldworks.   
 
200. Furthermore, the Circular expressly identified the circumstances or situations 
requiring the rental of motor vehicles not exceeding 15 days in the performance of the 
agency’s functions such as investments promotion, foreign affairs, international trade and 
tourism, conventions, seminars, athletic sports, and other similar activities.   It did not 
specifically include research projects of the government, which should be done diligently, 
in order to have an accurate result to guide the local government units, urban planning, and 
engineering offices, as well as private firms and individuals in determining the appropriate 
building design for the existing ground conditions.  Inconsistency of the data due to delay 
or non-continuous fieldwork will affect the result of the survey/study and has detrimental 
effect if used by the stakeholders.     

 
201. As a rejoinder, we maintain our stand that as provided in Section 12.2 of NBC 446, 
series of 1995, the “rental of motor vehicles for a continuous period of more than fifteen 
(15) days may be allowed, subject to the approval by the Secretary of Department of Budget 
Management (DBM)” regardless of the circumstances/situations. Further, research 
projects of the government may not be among those expressly stated in Section 12.1 of said 
circular, but fall under the “other situations similar” to those stated therein. 

 
202. Moreover, upon approval of any project, a program of work must be accomplished 
beforehand by the Project Leader and submitted for review by the SA. The said document 
will help in determining the date and duration of planned field works for the year. Thus, an 
ample time is available in securing approval from the DBM if rental of motor vehicles 
during field works would exceed the allowable 15 days.  

 



77 
 

203. Henceforth, Management must ensure that approval from the Secretary of the DBM 
is regularly secured in the rental of motor vehicles for a continuous period of more than 
fifteen (15) days in compliance with Paragraph 3.3 of NBC No. 446. 
 
Compliance Audit 
 

a) Non-bonding/renewal of fidelity bonds of AOs 
 
204. Of the 87 AOs with CAs totaling ₱5.004 million, only 32 AOs holding the 
aggregate amount of ₱1.805 million were actually bonded, 42 AOs had expired bond 
certificates, and 13 others had no bond applications as at year-end, contrary to 
Sections 4.1 and 7.2 of Treasury Circular No. 02-2009. 
 
205. Sections 4.1 and 7.2 of Treasury Circular No. 02-2009 provide that “Every Officer, 
agent, and employee of the Government of the Philippines xxx, regardless of the status of 
their appointment shall, whenever the nature of the duties performed by such officer, agent 
or employee permits or requires the possession, custody or control of funds or properties 
for which he is accountable, be deemed a bondable officer and shall be bonded or bondable 
and his fidelity insured. The fidelity bond of an accountable public officer shall be renewed 
before the expiration of the bond.” 

 
206. Comparison of the confirmation letters received from the BTr against CAs granted 
for the year revealed that out of 87 AOs with CAs amounting to ₱5,004,400.00, only 32 
AOs holding the aggregate of ₱1,805,400.00 were actually bonded, thereby, defeating the 
purpose of the fidelity fund of replacing defalcations, shortages, unrelieved losses in the 
account of bonded public officers. Details are presented in Table 28: 
 

Table 28. Breakdown of Bonded and Unbonded AOs 

  
207. Inquiry with Management disclosed that non-bonding or non-renewal of expired 
fidelity bond was due to the non/delayed submission of bonding requirements such as 
Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Net Worth (SALN), and the lack of the Agency’s own 
physician who will certify for the physical identifying marks/characteristics of the AOs as 
required in General Form No. 58 (A). Further, the skeletal workforce arrangement 
implemented during existing community quarantine due to the COVID-19 pandemic 
contributed to the delay in the submission of online applications of bonds with the BTr.

78 
 

208. As stated in the aforementioned Treasury Circular, the above AOs as accountable 
public officers should have applied or have been issued fidelity bonds from the moment 
they assumed their duties as SDOs/PCFCs. The non-renewal of expired bonds considered 
such bonds as automatically cancelled and have no legal effect, thereby defeating the 
purpose of fidelity funds in replacing defalcations, shortages or unrelieved losses under the 
account of the bonded public officer.  
 
209. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to 
enjoin all concerned AOs for their prompt submission of the bonding requirements 
necessary for the immediate application and prompt renewal of fidelity bonds of 13 
AOs and 42 AOs, respectively. 

 
210. Management commented that in monitoring the application and renewal of fidelity 
bonds, approval of Office Orders authorizing the holding of CA is deferred if application 
for bonds including the required SALN as attachment are not yet submitted to the AS. 
Moreover, a certification from the Accountant that the previous CA was submitted or fully 
liquidated must be attached before any Office Order will be approved. 

 
b) Unsubmitted DVs and LRs 

 
211. DVs and LRs aggregating ₱68.484 million were not submitted within the 
prescribed period, contrary to Sections 7.1.1 and 7.2.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-006, 
thus, preventing the prompt review of transactions with the end view of generating 
timely and relevant audit results. 

 
212. Sections 7.1.1 and 7.2.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009 
provide that the Head of the Agency who is primarily responsible for all government funds 
and property pertaining to his Agency, shall ensure that “the required financial and other 
reports and statements are submitted by the concerned officials in such form and within 
the period prescribed by the Commission xxx.” Likewise, the Chief Accountant shall ensure 
that “the reports and supporting documents submitted by the AOs are immediately 
recorded in the books of accounts and submitted to the Auditor within the first ten (10) 
days of the ensuing month.”  

 
213. Examination of submitted RCI/DVs and LRs revealed that 718 transaction 
documents amounting to ₱68,483,607.53 were not submitted to the COA Office as of 
February 2021, a summary of which is shown in Table 29, with further details presented in 
Annex C.

79 
 

 
214. The delayed submission of the above documents, as prescribed under the pertinent 
regulations, was due to the delay in the signing and/or approval of DVs and LRs and the 
late submission of Official Receipts (OR) by various payees especially those who are paid 
through List of Due and Demandable Accounts Payable (LDDAP). 
 
215. Non-submission of the aforementioned DVs and LRs and the corresponding 
supporting documents precluded the Audit Team from the prompt review and verification 
of the propriety of the financial transactions. Likewise, the accuracy, completeness and 
regularity of the recorded transactions cannot be reasonably assured unless duly supported 
with valid transaction documents. 

 
216. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to 
regularly (a) monitor the signing and/or approval of DVs and LRs by the concerned 
signatories, and (b) follow up the submission of ORs by paid payees for the immediate 
submission of 718 DVs/LRs aggregating to ₱68,483,607.53 duly supported with valid 
transaction documents. 
 

217. Management commented that the delay in the submission of DVs/LR was due to 
the late submission of supporting documents by the concerned payees/employees as a result 
of the “work from home” arrangement. Likewise, some suppliers failed to issue and 
provide corresponding Official Receipts despite their payments through LDDAP-ADA due 
to the community quarantines. 
 

c) Under-insured PPE 
 

218. Technical and Scientific Equipment (TSE) amounting to ₱133.427 million 
were not insured with the General Insurance Fund, thus, denying the Agency of 
adequate protection against any damage or loss of its properties. 
 
219. Examination of the transactions revealed that PPEs amounting to ₱133,426,716.82 
were not insured with the General Insurance Fund of the GSIS, thus, violating Section 5 of 
Republic Act No. 656, otherwise known as the Property Insurance Law which requires that 
“Every government, except a municipal government below first class, is hereby required 
to insure its properties, with the General Insurance Fund against any insurable risk herein 
provided and pay the premiums thereon, which, however shall not exceed the premiums 
charged by private insurance companies”. 
 
220. For the current year, the insured TSE amounted to ₱269,347,873.98 only as against 
the CY 2019 book value of ₱637,367,789.19 due to several unrecognized PPEs caused by 
non-submission of delivery documents by the PS to the AS for the recording in the books 
of accounts. This situation can be considered as precedent that some PPEs owned and/or 
used by the agency were not fully covered with insurance premium denying the agency of 
adequate protection against any damage or loss of its properties. 

 



80 
 

221. We recommended and Management agreed to require the PS to secure 
property insurance for the uninsured equipment in compliance with the provisions of 
RA 656 or the Property Insurance Law. 
 
Other Compliance Issues 
 
Gender and Development (GAD) 
 
222. The PHIVOLCS has faithfully responded to the GAD program and attributed 
a portion of their appropriations to their GAD-related programs and activities 
pursuant to Section 31 of the General Provisions of the 2020 General Appropriations 
Act and COA Circular No. 2014-001 dated March 18, 2014.  
 
223. Section 31 of the General Provisions of the 2020 General Appropriations Act 
provides that “all agencies shall formulate a GAD Plan designed to address gender issues 
within their concerned sectors or mandate and implement the applicable provisions under 
R.A. 9710 or the Magna Carta of Women, Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination Against Women, the Beijing Platform for Action, the Philippine Plan for 
Gender-Responsive Development (1995-2025) and the Philippine Development Plan 
(2017-2022). The GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of the agencies, 
which shall be at least five percent (5%) of their budgets.” 
 
224. Section V of COA Circular No. 2014-001 dated March 18, 2014 provides that “The 
Audited agency shall submit a copy of the Annual GPB to the COA Audit Team assigned 
to the agency within five (5) working days from receipt of the approved plan from the PCW 
or their mother or central offices, as the case maybe.  Likewise, a copy of the corresponding 
Accomplishment Report shall be furnished the said Audit Team within five (5) working 
days from the end of January of the preceding year.” 

 
225. Audit of submitted reports showed that the Agency initially allocated a GAD 
budget for CY 2020 amounting to ₱1,233,642.78 or 0.21 percent of its total appropriations 
of ₱596,223,000.00 which is below the five percent (5%) threshold prescribed in Section 
31 of the General Provisions of the 2020 General Appropriations Act. However, 
verification of the accomplishment report submitted to the PCW for review revealed that 
PHIVOLCS has met the five percent (5%) minimum budget allocation for GAD activities. 
The GPB initially submitted did not include the budget for the two (2) attributed programs 
of PHIVOLCS amounting to ₱65,684,000.00 which would increase budget allocation from 
0.21 percent (₱1,233,642.78) to 11.22 percent (66,917,642.78). 

 
226. Further verification of fund utilization in the submitted accomplishment report 
showed that the total actual expenditures incurred by PHIVOLCS for its GAD-related 
activities amounted to ₱30,769,387.42 or 45.98 percent of the total allocated budget for 
GAD, ₱30,567,564.00 or 99.34 percent were attributed to two (2) major programs of the 
Agency: Capacity Building of Philippine Local Communities on the Use of REDAS 
software and Dynaslope: Development of Site-Specific Threshold for Deep-seated 
Landslides and Slope Failures, as shown below:

Total 66,917,642.78 30,769,387.42 45.98% 100% 

 
227. The lower utilization rate was due to the non-implementation/postponement of 
some activities due to the imposed restrictions brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, 
with three (3) out of six (6) GAD activities not executed for organization-focused activities. 
Further, GAD-related meetings/forums were conducted virtually which lowered the 
expenses for the activities.  
 
228. We recommended and Management agreed. to: 

 
a. Allocate and attribute at least five percent (5%) of the appropriation for 

the implementation of GAD-related activities into the Agency’s regular 
programs and activities, and to formulate more gender-responsive 
planning and budgeting; and  

 
b. Consider the inclusion of unimplemented/postponed activities in the 

current year to succeeding year’s GPB for approval by the PCW, if 
warranted. 

 
Senior Citizens and Persons with Disability 
 
229. PHIVOLCS is responsive to the needs of Senior Citizens (SCs) and Persons 
with Disability (PWDs) by giving them equal opportunities in all activities undertaken 
and providing necessary assistance such as shuttle services, equipment and other 
materials to address their safety during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

 
230. Section 32 of the General Provisions of Republic Act (RA) No. 11465 requires that 
all agencies of the government shall formulate plans, programs and projects intended to 
address the concerns of SCs and PWDs, insofar as it relates to their mandated functions, 
and integrate the same in their regular activities. 

 
231. RA 7277 of the Magna Carta for PWDs mandates for the rehabilitation, self-
development and self-reliance of disabled persons and their integration into the mainstream 
of society and for other purposes. It further defines the rights and privileges of disabled 
persons such as equal opportunity for employment, access to quality education, National 
Health Program, Auxiliary Social Services, telecommunications, accessibility (barrier-free 
environment), political and civil rights.  

 
232. For CY 2020, PHIVOLCS implemented the following programs/projects for the 
welfare of SCs and PWDs: 



82 
 

a. Conducted Capacity Building Activities in which SCs and PWDs were 
identified and consulted about their specific needs to ensure full participation 
in the activities and equal opportunities for learning; 
 

b. Celebrated the DOST National Science and Technology Week (NSTW) and 
Disaster Resilience Summit on Earthquake and Volcano Preparedness through 
an online forum, in which 12 participants were SCs; 

 
c. Delivered the needed equipment, supplies and materials to the homes of SC 

employees to enable them to continue with their work while on Enhanced 
Community Quarantine (ECQ) and Modified Enhanced Community 
Quarantine (MECQ); and 

 
d. Provided shuttle services and COVID-19 Prevention kits to all staffs including 

senior citizens and PWDs during General Community Quarantine (GCQ). 
  

233. We recommended and Management agreed to maintain/continue its endeavor 
to address the welfare and concerns of SCs and PWDs. 
 
Youth Development 
 
234. PHIVOLCS has provided support to youth development activities as 
advocated in the General Appropriations Act (GAA) by accepting four (4) college 
students under the Department of Education’s (DepEd) Work Immersion Program 
for Senior High School Students, and conducting activities to increase earthquake, 
volcano and tsunami awareness and preparedness among the youth.  
 
235. Section 33 of the General Provisions of Republic Act (RA) No. 11465 encourages 
all agencies of the government to provide allocations for youth development projects and 
activities within the framework of the Philippine Youth Development Plan (2017-2022). 
 
236. Under the DepEd’s Work Immersion Program for Senior High School Students, the 
PHIVOLCS accommodated four students from Fatima College - Camiguin. It also hosted 
virtual online forum (live via FB and Zoom) and virtual exhibit tour (zoom exclusive) as 
part of the observance of the DOST-NSTW in November 2020. 

 
237. In the observance of the World Tsunami Awareness Day 2020, a total of 233 
students submitted their entries in the slogan and digital poster-making online contests 
conducted by the Agency to encourage the participation of the youth in raising tsunami 
awareness and preparedness while ensuring safety during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 
238. We recommended and Management agreed to continuously provide youth 
development activities in their programs/projects. 
 
 
 



83 
 

Compliance with Other Mandatory Accounts 
 
239. The PHIVOLCS complied with the withholding and remittance of mandatory 
deductions pursuant to the regulations issued by the Bureau of Internal Revenue 
(BIR), Government Service Insurance System (GSIS), Philippine Health Insurance 
Commission (PhilHealth) and Home Development Mutual Fund (HDMF), as follows:

₱0.028 million includes ₱0.027 million unreconciled balance of prior 
years 

 
240. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to remit 
in full the unremitted amounts withheld for CY 2020 and to exert efforts to identify 
the composition of unreconciled balances of taxes, premiums and loan instalments 
and/or over (under)-remitted withheld contributions and effect the necessary 
adjustments, if warranted.

as provided under Section 28 thereof. 
 
243. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to 
monitor the settlement of all suspensions and disallowances pursuant to Section 7 of 
the RRSA.
