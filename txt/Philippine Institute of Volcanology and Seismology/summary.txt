EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 

A. Introduction  
 

The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) is a 

service institute of the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) that is 

principally mandated to mitigate disasters that may arise from volcanic eruptions, 

earthquakes, tsunami and other related geotectonic phenomena and its accompanying 

hazards. 

 

PHIVOLCS was known before as the Commission on Volcanology 

(COMVOL), created by virtue of Republic Act No. 766 on June 20, 1952, following 

the violent eruption of Mt. Hibok-Hibok. COMVOL was created as an institution 

dedicated to the studying and monitoring of active volcanoes in the Philippines. It was 

initially placed under the Executive Board of the National Research Council and later 

under the National Science Development Board. In 1982, COMVOL was restructured 

and renamed Philippine Institute of Volcanology (PHIVOLC). On September 17, 1984, 

by virtue of Executive Order (EO) No. 984, Seismology, or the science that deals with 

earthquakes, which used to be concern of the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and 

Astronomical Service Administration (PAGASA), was transferred to the Institute.  

Thus, PHIVOLC was renamed Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology or 

PHIVOLCS.  In 1987, the National Science and Technology Authority (NSTA), 

including PHIVOLCS, underwent reorganization by virtue of Executive Order No. 

128. The NSTA was structurally and functionally transformed into Department of 

Science and Technology (DOST) with cabinet rank. At present, PHIVOLCS is a line 

agency under the DOST. 

 

The Institute is headed by Dr. Renato U. Solidum Jr., Undersecretary, DOST 

and Officer-In-Charge, PHIVOLCS, assisted by five divisions, namely: Volcano 

Monitoring and Eruption Prediction Division (VMEPD), Seismological Observation 

and Earthquake Prediction Division (SOEPD), Geology and Geophysics Research and 

Development Division (GGRDD), Geologic Disaster Awareness and Preparedness 

Division (GDAPD) and Finance and Administrative Division (FAD). 

 

As of December 31, 2020, PHIVOLCS has a total of 252 plantilla positions, 

215 of which are filled-up. The total number of Contract of Service staff for both 

internally and externally-funded projects is 164.

as at December 31, 2020 for the misstatements in Cash, Receivables, Inventories, 

Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) and Other Assets accounts totaling ₱144.235 

million representing 11.10 percent of its total assets as at year-end, while the Financial 

Liabilities, Trust Liabilities and Other Payables accounts were misstated by ₱1.135 

million 1.44 percent of the total reported liabilities and Net Assets/Equity account had 

misstatements of ₱8.630 million or 0.71 percent of the total equity of the Agency as at 

December 31, 2020.  

 

E. Summary of Other Significant Observations and Recommendations  
 

The observations and recommendations, discussed in detail in Part II of the 

report, are shown below: 



 iii 
 

Accounting Deficiencies 

 

1. The accuracy of the CIB-LCCA account balance of ₱42.989 million was affected 
by the inclusion of dormant non-existent Philippine National Bank (PNB) account 

of ₱90,396.42 and unrecognized payments for custom duties and taxes of various 

imported equipment of undetermined amount. Likewise, the non-submission of 

BRS for Bureau of Customs (BOC) bank account further rendered the account 

balance unreliable. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the: 

 

a) Property Section (PS) to provide the Accounting Section (AS) a copy of all 
bank debit advices for all disbursements made out of the CIB-LCCA 

account for the immediate recording of unbooked customs duties and taxes 

to the appropriate PPE accounts; 

 

AS to: 

b) Analyze and reconcile CIB-LCCA, BOC Subsidiary Ledger (SL) based on 
bank debit advices provided by the PS and prepare necessary adjustments 

to reflect the correct balances of the affected accounts; 

 

c) Prepare and submit monthly BRS on time to ensure all cash transactions 
are identified, documented and recorded in the books; and 

 

d) Request write-off of the unaccounted difference of ₱90,396.42 between the 
books of accounts and the PNB records, which were considered dormant, 

following the guidelines in Item III.10 of COA Circular No. 97-001. 

 

2. The existence and accuracy of the PPE account balances could not be ascertained 
due to: (a) continued inclusion of obsolete and unserviceable properties in the books 

and Report of Physical Count of PPE (RPCPPE) of undetermined amount, (b) 

unrecognized damaged property during volcanic eruption with an estimated amount 

of not less than ₱6.438 million, and (c) existence of abnormal/ negative SL balances 

of ₱6.853 million. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the: 

 

a) PS to prepare the IIRUP with complete information on acquisition costs 
and property numbers and submit a copy to the AS as basis in the dropping 

from the books of the unserviceable properties; 

 

b) VMEPD to provide a detailed list of damaged properties with complete 
property numbers for easy identification in the Property Cards of the PS;  

 

 

 



 iv 
 

• Accountant to: 
 

c) Enjoin the AOs concerned to submit four (4) copies of duly notarized 
RLSDDP and distribute the same following the schedule provided in 

Appendix 75 of the GAM, Volume II; 

 

d) Prepare adjusting entry to reclassified the abnormal PPELC balance in the 
Furniture and Fixtures account by debiting Accumulated Depreciation of 

₱46,876.01 and crediting Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) for the same 

amount; and 

 

e) Check the acquisition costs posted in the negative PPELC for STE in the 
original source documents and prepare necessary adjusting entries to 

reflect the correct balance of the account in the PPELC. 

 

3. Deposit on Letters of Credit of ₱100.538 million remained outstanding in the books 
for more than one (1) year to seven (7) years due to the non-submission of IAR and 

other delivery documents to the AS by the PS rendering the account balances 

unreliable and inaccurate. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require: 

 

• PS to: 
 

a) Prepare four (4) copies of IAR on a regular basis to document inspection 
and acceptance of deliveries and strictly comply with the provisions of 

Appendix 62 of the GAM, Volume II regarding proper distribution of 

copies; 

 

b) Exert efforts to provide copies of the IAR and other proofs of deliveries to 
the AS for the DLC balance of ₱100,538,065.50; thereafter, regularly 

comply with the GAM provisions on the regular submission to the AS of 

the IAR and other supporting documents for immediate recording in the 

books;  

 

c) Ensure that all deliveries are supported with IAR and submit the same to 
the Auditor within 24 hours after acceptance thereof;  

 

•  Accountant to: 
 

d) Prepare the necessary adjustments in the books of accounts once the IAR 
and other supporting delivery documents for the DLCs with a balance of 

₱100,538,065.50 become available; and  

 



 v 
 

e) Provide the covering depreciation for the delivered equipment based on 
the dates of deliveries, and make the necessary adjustments to reflect the 

correct carrying amount of PPE in the FSs. 

 

4. Lack of coordination by PHIVOLCS in the submission of liquidation reports 
among Source Agencies (SAs) is not only contrary to pertinent provisions of 

Sections 4.6 and 6.5 of COA Circular No. 94-013, but also resulted in unreliable 

balance of Due to NGAs account. Further, the improper posting of transactions in 

the account resulted in negative SL balance of ₱0.422 million, thus, affecting the 

fair presentation and reliability of the FSs. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the AS to: 

 

a) Closely coordinate with SAs regarding the status of ownership of PPEs 
purchased out of project funds and prepare necessary journal entries, if 

warranted;  

 

b) Provide copies of recorded JEVs per project, together with copies of RCI 
and supporting documents, to the Accountants of SAs and reconcile with 

their records to establish the correct balance of Due to NGAs; henceforth, 

regularly coordinate and provide copies thereof to the Accountants of SAs; 

 

c) Make an in-depth analysis of the negative SL balance and prepare 
appropriate adjusting journal entries; and 

 

d) Send demand letters to concerned project leaders for the collection of 
overpayments, if warranted. 

 

Compliance Audit 

 

5. Of the 87 AOs with CAs totaling ₱5.004 million, only 32 AOs holding the 

aggregate amount of ₱1.805 million were actually bonded, 42 AOs had expired 

bond certificates, and 13 others had no bond applications as at year-end, contrary 

to Sections 4.1 and 7.2 of Treasury Circular No. 02-2009. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant 

to enjoin all concerned AOs for their prompt submission of the bonding 

requirements necessary for the immediate application and prompt renewal of 

fidelity bonds of 13 AOs and 42 AOs, respectively.
