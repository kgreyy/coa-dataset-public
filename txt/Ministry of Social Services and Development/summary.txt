EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 

A. Introduction 
 

The Ministry of Social Services and Development (MSSD) – Bangsamoro Autonomous 
Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) was the former Department of Social Welfare and 
Development –ARMM existing under the Organic Act of Muslim Mindanao (RA 6734). 
The Bangsamoro Organic Law. R.A. no. 11054 or the Organic Law of the BARMM was 
signed into law on July 24, 2018 and ratified in a plebiscite called for the purpose on 
January 21, 2019 among the provinces in Mindanao. Another plebiscite was held on 
February 6,2019 in nearby regions that sought to join the area. All properties owned by 
Autonomous Region Government will be transferred to Bangsamoro Government. On 
February 26, 2019, Autonomous Region Government was turned over to Bangsamoro 
Government. Thus, began to function and formed its organizational structure in accordance 
with the Bangsamoro Organic Law. 
 

MSSD-BARMM is composed of regional office, five provincial branches and three 
independent areas under LGU. The Regional Office is located at BARMM Bangsamoro 
Government Center, Cotabato City with five (5) sub-centers located at Brgy. Semba, Datu 
Odin Sinsuat (DOS), Maguindanao, namely: Integrated Family Life Resource Center 
(ILFRC), Reception and Study Center for Differently Able Persons (LPCDAP) and 
Emergency Management and Operation Information Center (EMOIC). The provincial 
branches are 1) Maguindanao Branch Office located at Brgy. Semba, DOS, Maguindanao, 
occupying the former Regional Office building or the Regional Social welfare 
Development (RESWAD) building; 2) Lanao Del Sur A (LSA) Branch Office located at 
Marawi City, Lanao del Sur; 3) Lanao Del Sur B (LSB) Branch Office located at Malabang, 
LDS; 4) Sulu Branch Office located at Jolo, Sulu, and the 5) Tawi-Tawi Branch Office 
located at Bonggao, Tawi-Tawi.  The equivalent social welfare offices of Cotabato City, 
Marawi City, and Basilan are under their respective LGU, since social welfare has been 
devolved to these LGUs before they have joined the ARMM/BARMM. 
 

The Ministry has a total working force personnel of 195 permanent positions and 48 
Job-order and Contract of Service workers.

C. Audit Scope 
 

The audit covered the operations and financial transactions of the MSSD BARMM 
for calendar year 2020. 
 

D. Independent Auditor’s Report 
 

A qualified opinion was rendered on the financial statements (FS) of the MSSD 
BARMM as at December 31, 2020 due to noted accounting deficiencies totaling 
P3,552,113,929.16 affecting the fair presentation of the Asset and Liability accounts 
reported in the FS by P2,947,997,563.28 and P574,116,365.88, respectively. 
 

E. Significant Observations and Recommendations 
 

As discussed in Part II of this Report, the following are the significant audit 
observations and recommendations, as summarized below: 
 

1. The MSSD BARMM Regional Office failed to revert unused funds which 
became dormant amounting to P15,099,691.61 contrary to DOF-DBM-COA 
Joint Circular No. 4-2012 and Executive Order No. 431, thereby overstating 
the cash balances intended for the fiscal year 2020. 

 
  Require the concerned personnel to make the necessary analysis, review and 

evaluation of the dormant funds, and if the purpose for which they were made has 
been fulfilled or abandoned, revert them to the general fund in compliance with 
DOF-DBM-COA Joint Circular No. 4-2012 and Executive Order No. 431. 

 
2. The MSSD BARMM RO failed to submit the supporting schedules of 

unliquidated advances to special disbursing officers, advances to officers and 
employees and inter and intra-agency receivables totaling P150,986,560.00, 
579,138.00 and 2,348,890,110.52, respectively, hence we cannot ascertain in 
audit the correctness, existence, validity of their balances reported in the FS 
contrary to COA Circular No. 2016-005. 
 
Require the concerned personnel to submit the required schedules of all receivable 
accounts; facilitate the immediate liquidation of foregoing receivable, grant no 
subsequent cash advances until the previous ones are fully liquidated pursuant to

Sec. 89 of PD 1445; and suspend the salaries of the erring employees or 
accountable officers (Sec. 122, PD 1445). 

 
3. The MSSD BARMM RO erroneously recorded as outright expenses the 

procured supplies and welfare goods amounting to 20,914,231.45 and 
P411,288,831.70, respectively, thereby understating the inventory accounts 
and overstating the expense accounts, and failed to maintain Supply Ledger 
Card (SLC) and Stock Card (SC) contrary to Sections 9 and 13, Chapter 8, 
Vol. I of GAM. 

  
 Require the Accounting and Supply units to conduct inventory of the supplies and 

goods at hand and make adjusting entries to recognize their actual value in the 
books, and maintain at all times SLC and SC to properly monitor each of the 
inventory items purchased and issued; and also conduct physical count of 
inventories semi-annually. 
 

4. MSSD BARMM RO failed to conduct inspection on unserviceable motor 
vehicles with residual value of P239,000.00 or 10% of the total acquisition 
cost  of P2,390,000.00, thereby affecting the fair presentation of the accounts 
in the financial statements contrary to Section 79 of PD 1445. 

 
Require the Inventory Committee to immediately conduct inspection on the 
subject motor vehicles; submit Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable 
Property (IIRUP), if found unserviceable, and recommend for their disposal either 
through destruction or public auction sale pursuant to Sec. 79 of PD 1445. 

 
5. The MSSD BARMM RO failed to submit the required statement/aging of its 

Accounts Payable totaling P574,116,365.88 hence we cannot ascertain its 
validity, existence and correctness contrary to COA Circular No. 2015-004 
and Section 98, Par. 2, Section 111 of PD 1445. 

 
Direct the personnel concerned to prepare and submit to COA the required 
statement/aging of accounts payable within the prescriptive period; and revert 
accounts payable which has been outstanding for over two years and against which 
no actual claim, administrative or judicial, has been filed or which is not covered 
by perfected contracts on record. 
 

6. The MSSD Lanao del Sur A (LSA) failed to record the receipt and 
disbursement of funds in the Statement of Receipt and Disbursement (SORD) 
on the dates they were received and disbursed amounting to P301,416,654.415 
and P328,860,574.29 contrary to Section 2 of PD 1445, thus exposing the 
government fund to risk of possible loss or wastage. 

 
Direct the MSSD LSA accountable officer to consistently record in the SORD 
pursuant to rules and regulations. 

 



 

iv 
 

7. MSSD BARMM RO and Tawi-Tawi Branch failed to submit some paid 
disbursement vouchers (DVs) and supporting documents within the 
prescribed period resulting to the delayed post-audit of transactions contrary 
to Sections 107 and 122 of PD 1445 (Table 12, Part II). 

 
Direct the concerned personnel to submit the paid DV and supporting documents 
on time; notify those accountable officers or employees causing the delay to 
liquidate their cash advances; if warranted, hold the salaries of those erring 
officers pursuant to Section 122 (2) of PD 1445; direct the Disbursing Officer and 
OIC bookkeeper to submit the submit the paid DV and their supporting documents

9. The MSSD BARMM RO and Sulu Brach failed to submit paid DV and 

supporting documents pertaining to COVID 19 transactions contrary to Sec. 
107 of PD 1445 and COA Circular No. 94-013, thus preventing the Audit 
Teams from ascertaining whether or not the funds were effectively, 
economically and efficiently disbursed and benefited the target beneficiaries 

 
Faithfully comply with the rules and regulation on the Granting, Utilization and 
Liquidations of Fund Transfers pursuant to COA Circular 94-013 dated December

funded programs amounting to P1,424,364,339.67 due to delayed submission 
of liquidations by the operating units contrary to Par. 6.5 of COA Circular 
No. 94-013, hence we cannot ascertain whether or not such funds were 
properly utilized. 

 
Faithfully comply with the rules and regulation on the Granting, Utilization and

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT 
 
 
Atty. RAISSA H. JAJURIE 
Minister  
Ministry of Social Service and Development  
Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao 

 
Qualified Opinion 

 
We have audited the financial statements (FS) of the Ministry of Social Services and 
Development, Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), 
which comprises the Statement of Financial Position as at December 31, 2020, and the 
Statement of Financial Performance, Statement of Changes in Net Assets/Equity, 
Statement of Cash Flows and Statement of Comparison of Budget and Actual Amounts 
for the year then ended, and Notes to the Financial Statements, including a summary 
of significant accounting policies. 

 
In our opinion, except for the effects of the matter described in the Basis of Qualified 
Opinion section of our report, the accompanying FS present fairly, in all material 
respects, the financial position of the MSSD-BARMM as at December 31, 2020, and its 
financial performance, its cash flows, and its comparison of budget and actual 
amounts for the year then ended in accordance with International Public Sector 
Accounting Standards (IPSASs). 

 
Basis for Qualified Opinion 

 
As discussed in Part II of this report, we noted accounting deficiencies of the MSSD 
BARMM as at December 31, 2020 totaling P3,552,113,929.16 affecting the fair 
presentation of the Asset and Liability accounts reported in the FS by P2,947,997,563.28 
and P574,116,365.88, respectively 
 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards of Supreme Audit 
Institutions (ISSAIs). Our responsibility under those standards are further described in the 
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. 
We are independent of the agency in accordance with the ethical requirements that are 
relevant to our audit of the financial statements, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and Code of Ethics. We believe that 
the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
qualified opinion.

Responsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements 
 

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial 
statements in accordance with IPSASs, and for such internal control as management 
determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
 
Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Agency’s financial 
reporting process. 

 
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements 

 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements 
as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue 
an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of 
assurance, but is not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISSAIs will 
always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud 
or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could 
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of 
these financial statements. 
 
As part of an audit in accordance with ISSAIs, we exercise professional judgment and 
maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: 
 
• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, 

whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those 
risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud 
is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, 
intentional omissions, misrepresentations, of the override of internal control; 
 

• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design 
audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, not for the purpose of 
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Agency’s internal control; 
 

• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of 
accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management; and 
 

• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, 
including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the 
underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. 
 

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, 
the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit observations, including 
any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

 11.14.  There is no current operating income. Expenses on the other hand, include 
personnel expenses amounting to 100,427,881.15 and 623,553,028.01 for MOOE, with the 
total expenses of 723,980,909.16 and deficit for current operation of (723,980,909.16). 
However, Ministry recorded Subsidy from National Government in the books of accounts 
amounting to 1,599,733,613.10 and Other Non-Operating Income of 250,474.52. In strict 
accounting sense, this is not actual excess of income over expenses.  Part of this amount 
includes fund transfers to provincial offices. These funds are still unliquidated by end of 
2020. The same has been taken up as Due from Operating Units and not as expenses 
pending their liquidation. The over statement in the equity will eventually be corrected 
once these funds are liquidated in 2021 

 

Note 12. Inter- Agency Fund Transfer – Trust Fund 

 12.1. An inter-agency fund transfer includes all programs of the Ministry. These 
represent the amount of funds received by the agency under Centrally Managed Fund or 
coming from DSWD Central Office and from Ministry of Finance, Budget, and 
Management for Bangsamoro Appropriations intended for the implementation of project 
and program activities of the Ministry. These funds are treated as cash advances by the 
agency and the same submits liquidation directly to DSWD - Central Office for Centrally 
Managed Fund.

A. Accounting Deficiencies 
 

1. Various accounts of the MSSD BARMM Regional Office contains accounting 
deficiencies amounting to P3,522,113,929.16 affecting the fair presentation of the 
account balances, contrary to Section 7, Chapter 15 of the Government 
Accounting Manual (GAM) and Sections 111 and 112 of Presidential Decree (PD) 
1445. 

 
a. Section 27 of the Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standards (PPSAS) 1 and 

Section 7, Chapter 19 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume I, 
states that “the Financial Statements shall present fairly the financial position, 
financial performance and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the 
faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in 
accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, 
revenue, and expenses set out in PPSASs. The application of PPSASs.” 
  

b. Moreover, Sections 111 and 112 of PD 1445 provide that the accounts of an agency 
shall be kept in such detail as is necessary to meet the needs of the agency and at the 
same time be adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or control agencies 
of the government; and the highest standards of honesty, objectivity and consistency 
shall be observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate or 
misleading information. Section 112. Recording of financial transactions. Each 
government agency shall record its financial transactions and operations conformably 
with generally accepted accounting principles and in accordance with pertinent laws 
and regulations.

amounting to P15,099,691.61 contrary to DOF-DBM-COA Joint Circular No. 4-
2012 and Executive Order No. 431, thereby overstating the cash balances intended

a. Executive Order No. 431 dated May 30, 2005 directs the reversion of all dormant 

accounts, unnecessary special and trust funds to the general fund and for other 
purposes. It further emphasized Section 29(3), Article VI of the Constitution which 
provides that: “once the purpose for which a special fund was created has been 
fulfilled or abandoned, the balance, if any, shall be transferred to the general funds 
of the government.” 
 

b. DOF-DBM-COA Joint Circular No. 4-2012 dated September 11, 2012 was issued 
to prescribe the procedures and guidelines for the implementation Executive Order 
No. 431 which also requires the evaluation of the necessity of maintaining dormant 
and unnecessary accounts. 
 

c. Upon examination of the BRS of MSSD BARMM RO, it was noted that the agency 
has carried forward cash balances coming from the old funds of then DSWD 
ARMM which become dormant since BARMM assumed office, as shown below 
in Table 2.

Table 2. Summary of Dormant Accounts 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
d. We recommended and the Management agreed to: 

 
Require the concerned personnel to make the necessary analysis, review and 
evaluation of the dormant funds, and if the purpose for which they were made 
has been fulfilled or abandoned, revert them to the general fund in compliance 
with DOF-DBM-COA Joint Circular No. 4-2012 and Executive Order No. 431. 

 
e. Accountant asserted that the aforementioned audit observation was complied with 

before December 31, 2020, however no supporting documents was submitted such 
as official receipts and journal entry voucher. In fact, the bank reconciliation 
statements as of December 31, 2020 show the actual balance per fund, thus that 
means that the subject fund balances were not yet reverted as at year-end contrary 
to the assertion of the Accountant. 

 
Non-submission of Schedules of Receivables, Cash Advances and Fund Transfer 

 
3. The MSSD BARMM RO failed to submit the supporting schedules of 

unliquidated advances to special disbursing officers, advances to officers and 
employees and inter and intra-agency receivables totaling P150,986,560.00, 
579,138.00 and 2,348,890,110.52, respectively, hence we cannot ascertain in audit 
the correctness, existence, validity of their balances reported in the FS contrary to 
COA Circular No. 2016-005. 

 
a. All government entities shall conduct regular monitoring and analysis of accounts 

to ensure that these are collected when these become due and demandable and that 
cash advances and fund transfers are liquidated within the prescribed period 
depending upon their nature and purpose; and  
 

b. All government entities shall prepare the schedules of all receivables, unliquidated 
cash advances, and fund transfer as of December 31, 2015 and quarterly thereafter.

(see Appendix 55 of Vol. I, GAM). 
 

c. Audit of receivable accounts of MSSD RO revealed that there are receivable 
accounts on record which existence and validity could not be ascertained because 
the foregoing supporting schedules were not presented for audit purposes, as 
presented below in Tables 3 and 4.

d. We recommended and the Management agreed to: 
 
Require the concerned personnel to submit the required schedules of all 
receivable accounts; facilitate the immediate liquidation of foregoing 
receivable, grant no subsequent cash advances until the previous ones are fully 
liquidated pursuant to Sec. 89 of PD 1445; and suspend the salaries of the 
erring employees or accountable officers (Sec. 122, PD 1445). 
 

e. Management committed to submit the required schedules and facilitate the 
immediate liquidation of all outstanding receivables. 
 

Erroneous recognition of office supplies and welfare goods as outright expenses and non-

maintenance of Supply Ledger Card and Stock Card 

4. The MSSD BARMM RO erroneously recorded as outright expenses the procured 
supplies and welfare goods amounting to 20,914,231.45 and P411,288,831.70, 
respectively, thereby understating the inventory accounts and overstating the 
expense accounts, and failed to maintain Supply Ledger Card (SLC) and Stock 
Card (SC) contrary to Sections 9 and 13, Chapter 8, Vol. I of GAM.

and a running total for the cost of goods sold in each period. The system requires 
accounting records to show the amount of inventory on hand at all times through 
maintenance of the Stock Ledger Card (SLC) by the Accounting Division/Unit and 
Stock Card (SC) by the Supply and/or Property Division/Unit for each item in 
stock. Regular purchases shall be coursed through the inventory account and issue 
thereof shall be recorded as they take place except for supplies and materials 
purchased out of PCF for immediate use or on emergency cases which shall be 
charged directly to the appropriate expense account. 

 
b. Sec. 13. (3). Physical count/inventory, which is required semi-annually, is an 

indispensable procedure for checking the integrity of property custodianship. 
 
c. It was noted in the examination of accounts that no inventory accounts were 

recorded in the financial position because all office supplies and welfare goods 
were recorded as outright expenses. And upon inquiry, we came to know that no 
Supply Ledger Card and Stock Card maintained, hence we cannot ascertain the 
correct balances of office supplies and welfare goods.  

 
d. Upon ocular inspection in the stock room of the MSSD BARMM RO, we noticed 

that there are supplies or goods that are kept intact inside the office warehouse for 
consumption and distribution. Further, No Stock Ledger Card and Stock Card was 
presented to the audit team for audit purposes. 

 
e. We recommended and the Management agreed to: 
 

Require the Accounting and Supply units to conduct inventory of the supplies 
and goods at hand and make adjusting entries to recognize their actual value 
in the books, and maintain at all times SLC and SC to properly monitor each 
of the inventory items purchased and issued; and also conduct physical count 
of inventories semi-annually. 

f. The Accounting unit of MSSD BARMM RO said that they recorded office supplies 
and welfare goods as outright expenses, and they committed to comply and 
maintain the Stock ledger card in the accounting division this year 2021. Also, 
Supply Unit committed to maintain supply ledger card for 2021. 

Failure to inspect unserviceable office vehicles 

 
5. MSSD BARMM RO failed to conduct inspection on unserviceable motor vehicles 

with residual value of P239,000.00 or 10% of the total acquisition cost  of 
P2,390,000.00, thereby affecting the fair presentation of the accounts in the 
financial statements contrary to Section 79 of PD 1445. 

 
a. Section 79. Destruction or sale of unserviceable property. When government 

property has become unserviceable for any cause, or is no longer needed, it shall, 



 

42 
 

upon application of the officer accountable therefor, be inspected by the head of the 
agency or his duly authorized representative in the presence of the auditor 
concerned and, if found to be valueless or unsalable, it may be destroyed in their 
presence. If found to be valuable, it may be sold at public auction to the highest 
bidder under the supervision of the proper committee on award or similar body in 
the presence of the auditor concerned or other duly authorized representative of the 
Commission, after advertising by printed notice in the Official Gazette, or for not 
less than three consecutive days in any newspaper of general circulation, or where 
the value of the property does not warrant the expense of publication, by notices 
posted for a like period in at least three public places in the locality where the 
property is to be sold. In the event that the public auction fails, the property may be 
sold at a private sale at such price as may be fixed by the same committee or body 
concerned and approved by the Commission. 
 

b. Upon ocular inspection, we noticed that there are two motor vehicles, one Isuzu 
Pick Up and one Adventure SUV, parked beside MSSD BARMM Regional Office 
building, seemed to be beyond repair and not brought to shop for a long period for 
repair and maintenance, for which the agency failed to conduct inspection to 
determine whether or not the subject vehicles are serviceable contrary to Section 
79 of PD 1445.  
 

c. Per 2019 RPCPPE, it shows that there are three unserviceable motor vehicles which 
became unserviceable, as shown below in Table 5.

d. It must be noted that if said vehicles are already unserviceable then they should 

have been disposed way earlier to secure their best value.  
 

e. We recommended and the Management agreed to: 
 
Require the Inventory Committee to immediately conduct inspection on the 
subject motor vehicles; submit Inventory and Inspection Report of 
Unserviceable Property (IIRUP), if found unserviceable, and recommend for 
their disposal either through destruction or public auction sale pursuant to 
Sec. 79 of PD 1445. 
 

f. The Management of MSSD BARMM RO committed to conduct inspection on 
unserviceable PPE and to strictly comply with the provisions of Section 79 of PD 
1445. 
 

Non-submission of schedules of Accounts Payables 

 
6. The MSSD BARMM RO failed to submit the required statement/aging of its 

Accounts Payable totaling P574,116,365.88 hence we cannot ascertain its 
validity, existence and correctness contrary to COA Circular No. 2015-004 and 
Section 98, Par. 2, Section 111 of PD 1445.   

 
a. Par. 3.1, COA Circular No. 2015-004. The Chief Accountant/Head of Accounting 

Unit shall submit directly to the Government Accountancy Office (GAO), GAS, 
and to the Supervising Auditor (SA)/Audit Team Leader (ATL) concerned, the 
following year-end financial statements and other related financial 
reports/schedules (e.g. Statement/Aging of Accounts Payable) in accordance with 
the existing format and in printed and digital copies on or before February 14 of 
each year. 
 

b. Section 98.  Reversion of unliquidated balances of accounts payable. The 
Commission, upon notice to the head of agency concerned, may revert to the 
unappropriated surplus of the general fund of the national government, any 
unliquidated balance of accounts payable in the books of the national government, 
which has been outstanding for two years or more and against which no actual 
claim, administrative or judicial, has been filed or which is not covered by perfected 
contracts on record. This section shall not apply to unliquidated balances of

accounts payable in trust funds as long as the purposes for which the funds were 
created have not been accomplished. 
 

c. Audit of liability accounts of MSSD BARMM RO revealed that there are accounts 
payable on record which existence and validity could not be ascertained because of 
absence of supporting schedules such as statement/aging of accounts payable, and 
some of them have been outstanding for two years and were not reverted contrary 
to COA Circular No. 2015-004 and Section 98 of PD 1445, as presented below in 
Table 6.  

 
Table 6. List Recorded Accounts Payable 

 
d. We recommended and the Management agreed to require the Head of: 

 
MSSD RO to direct the personnel concerned to prepare and submit to COA 
the required statement/aging of accounts payable within the prescriptive 
period; and revert accounts payable which has been outstanding for over two 
years and against which no actual claim, administrative or judicial, has been 
filed or which is not covered by perfected contracts on record. 
 

e. The Accounting Unit commented that the accounts payable pertaining to 2018 was 
already reverted, however no supporting documents such as journal entry voucher 
and other supporting documents was submitted to the audit team for audit purposes. 

 
C. Accounting Deficiencies – Operating Units 

 
Non-submission of Bank Reconciliation Statements 

 

7. Three MSSD Provincial Branches failed to submit monthly bank reconciliation 
statements in violation of Section 5, Chapter 21, Vol. I of GAM, hence we cannot 
ascertain the correctness of the cash balances reported in the books, as shown in 
Table 7 below.

a. During our audit, we have noticed that the management is not submitting a monthly 

BRS to the Office of Auditor. Hence, the audit team sent a Demand Letter dated 
March 2, 2021 requesting the submission of the Bank Reconciliation Statement, 
Bank Statements (all funds) and its corresponding supporting documents for the 
month of January to December 2020. 

 
b. We would like to point out that preparation of BRS should be for all depository 

“Cash in Bank” and “Cash-Modified Disbursement System (MDS)” accounts may 



 

46 
 

it for General Fund or Trust Funds. Thus, BRS other than that for Regular Fund 
should also be prepared and submitted to the Office of the Auditor. 

 
c. We recommended and the Management agreed to require the concerned: 

 
Accountants to update and submit the lacking BRS; designate a personnel who 
will assist in the preparation of the Monthly Bank Reconciliation Statements 
for all Funds maintained in the depository bank account so that the Cash in 
Bank accounts will be reconciled on time; secure bank statements from the 
bank and prepare a BRS for the period of January to December 2020 and 
furnish the Office of the Auditor a copy of the report. 
 

d. The managements committed that the newly hired accountants will update and 
submit monthly BRS.     

 
The MSSD LSA improperly recorded and monitored receipts and disbursements of funds. 

 
8. The MSSD LSA failed to record the receipt and disbursement of funds in the 

Statement of  Receipt and Disbursement (SORD) on the dates they were received 
and disbursed, respectively amounting to ₱301,416,654.415 and 328,860,574.29 
contrary to Section 2 of PD 1445, thus exposing the government fund to risk of 
possible loss or wastage. 

 
a. It is the declared policy of the State that all resources of the government shall be 

managed, expended or utilized in accordance with laws and regulations, and 
safeguarded against loss or wastage through illegal or improper disposition, with a 
view to ensuring efficiency, economy and effectiveness in the operations of 
government. The responsibility to take care that such policy is faithfully adhered to 
rests directly with the chief or head of the government agency concerned. (Sec. 2, 
P.D. No. 1445.) 

 
b. We have verified the Notice of Fund Transfers (NFT) against the Statement of 

Receipts and Disbursements (SORD) and the Report of Checks Issued and found 
out inconsistency in the recording of the fund received as well as the disbursements 
thereof.  

 
c. As shown in the table below, a total of ₱301,416,654.41fund transferred from 

MSSD-Regional Office to MSSD- LSA were not included or were not properly 
recorded in the SORD. In some instances, only when the disbursements are made 
when the fund received is recorded, as shown in Table 8.

e. When asked, the accountable officer explained that the Receipt portion of SORD 
includes all NFT received from the agency’s Regional Office and the Disbursement 
portion includes all checks issued for a particular period.  

 
f. However, the total amount of ₱328,860,574.29 shown in the table above was 

unrecorded in the statement of receipt and disbursement. These expenses pertain to 
the different programs charged against regular fund account such as expenses under 
operational activities, supplementary feeding program, social pension for indigent 
senior citizen (SOCPEN), OCM welfare goods and social amelioration program 
(SAP).  

 
g. The above-mentioned deficiencies display a poor control in safeguarding and in the 

proper control and monitoring of the government fund contrary to PD 1445 thus 
exposing the government fund to risk of possible loss or wastage. 

 
h. We recommended and the Management agreed to require the Head of: 
 

MSSD LSA to direct the accountable officer to consistently record in the 
SORD pursuant to rules and regulations.

COMPLIANCE AUDIT 
 
Failure to submit Report on Physical Count of PPE (RPCPPE) for fiscal year 2020 

 

9. The MSSD BARMM RO, and two Provincial Branches failed to submit the Report 
on Physical Count of PPE (RPCPPE) within the prescribed period, contrary to 
Section 38, Chapter 10, Vol. I, GAM, thus the existence, validity and accuracy of 
the PPE account balances could not be fully ascertained, as shown below in Table 
10.

Observation 
 
MSSD BARMM RO, Maguindanao, and Sulu failed to 
submit the Report on Physical Count of PPE (RPCPPE) 
within the prescribed period contrary to Section 38, 
Chapter 10, Vol. I, GAM, thus the existence, validity and 
accuracy of the PPE account balances could not be fully 
ascertained. 
 
Criteria 
 
Sec. 38. Physical Count of PPE. The entity shall have a 
periodic physical count of PPE, which shall be done 
annually and presented on the Report on the Physical Count 
of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) (Appendix 71) 
as at December 31 of each year. This shall be submitted to 
the Auditor concerned not later than January 31 of the 
following year. Equipment found at station and losses 
discovered during the physical count shall be reported to the 
Accounting Division/Unit for proper accounting/recording.” 
 
The MSSD BARMM RO’s Inventory Committee has started 
the physical count of Property Plant & Equipment but failed 
to submit the Report on Physical Count of PPE (RPCPPE) 
within the prescribed period, contrary to Section 38, Chapter 
10, GAM Vol. I, thus resulting to unreconciled and doubtful 
balances of PPE in the FS totaling P30,798,035.26.

conduct the physical count of PPE. 
 
Effect 
 
The PPE balances reported in the FS are doubtful and 
therefore could not be relied upon. 
 
 

a. Through AOM and during the entrance conference, we recommended that MSSD 
BARMM RO create an Inventory Committee on the conduct of physical count of 
PPE. 
 

b. As compliance, an inventory committee was created and last January 2021, said 
committee with the presence of the COA representative conducted physical count 
of PPE throughout the region. Since it was conducted late, the Auditee failed to 
submit the RPCPPE within the prescribed period. 
 

c. Per statement of financial position of the MSSD BARMM RO recorded the PPE of

The Bookkeeper and Cashier of MSSD BARMM Tawi-
Tawi failed to submit to the Office of the Audit Team 
Leader the paid disbursement vouchers and supporting 
documents intended to Seed Capital Assistance and 
Stipend of 2700 PWDs, thereby hinders the post audit

a. AOMs were issued requiring submission of paid disbursement vouchers and supporting 
documents Except for the foregoing lacking documents, we noted that MSSD 
BARMM RO has been submitting paid disbursement vouchers and supporting 
documents with reasonable delay.  

 
b. We recommended and the Management agreed to require the Heads of: 
 

such times and in such manner as shall be prescribed in the 
regulations of the Commission. 
 
Section 122. Submission of reports. Whenever deemed 
necessary in the exigencies of the service, the Commission 
may under regulations issued by it require the agency 
heads, chief accountants, budget officers, cashiers, 
disbursing officers, administrative or personnel officers, 
and other responsible officials of the various agencies to 
submit trial balances, physical inventory reports, current 
plantilla of personnel, and such other reports as may be 
necessary for the exercise of its functions. 
 
(2) Failure on the part of the officials concerned to submit 
the documents and reports mentioned herein shall 
automatically cause the suspension of payment of their 
salaries  
until they shall have complied with the requirements of the 
Commission.  
 
(3) No appropriation authorized in the General 
Appropriations Act shall be available to pay the salary or 
any official or employee who violates the provisions of this 
section, without prejudice to any disciplinary action that 
may be instituted against such official or employee. 
 
Cause 
 
Delayed submission of liquidations by the accountable 
officers in the field offices. 
 
Effect 
 
Report of disbursement and checks issued are doubtful and 
therefore could not be relied upon in audit due to lack of 
documentary evidence. 
 



 

53 
 

i. MSSD BARMM RO to direct the concerned personnel to submit the 
vouchers and supporting documents on time; promptly notify those 
accountable officers or employees causing the delay to liquidate their cash 
advances; if warranted, hold the salaries of those erring officers pursuant to 
Section 122 (2) of PD 1445 (#1 Audit Observation). 

 
ii. MSSD Tawi-Tawi to direct the Disbursing Officer and OIC bookkeeper to 

submit the various paid vouchers and supporting documents on time to the 
Auditor as provided or stated in the COA Circular No. 95-006 (#2 Audit 
Observation). 

 
c. The Accounting Unit of MSSD BARMM RO committed to comply with and 

asserted that it had submitted the disbursement vouchers and supporting documents 
up to the month of August 2020, and currently processing the disbursement 
vouchers and other supporting documents for the succeeding months. 

 
The MSSD BARMM Lanao del Sur A (LSA) failed to comply Section 4, Chapter 6 of 

Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Vol. 

I. 

 
11. The MSSD LSA failed to comply with the prescribed forms of Notice of Transfer 

Allocation (NTA) and Registry of Allotment and Notice of Transfer Allocation 
(RANTA) contrary to Section 4, Chapter 6 of Government Accounting Manual 
(GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I. 

 
a. Sec. 4. Chap. 6 of GAM. The NTA shall be the authority of the regional and 

operating units to pay their operating expenses, purchases of supplies and materials, 
acquisition of PPE, accounts payable, and other authorized disbursements through 
the issue of MDS checks, ADA or other modes of disbursements. 

 
b. No MDS check/ADA shall be issued by the ROs/OUs without the covering NTA. 

Hence, the total MDS checks issued shall not exceed the total NTA received. NTA 
issued and credited to the Regular MDS Accounts of ROs/OUs for their regular 
operations which are programmed for a specific month shall be valid within the 
period prescribed under existing rules and regulations. To maximize the available 
NTAs of the agency, the Common Fund System policy shall be adopted whereby 
cash allocation balances of agencies under the Regular MDS Account may be used 
to cover payment of current year’s accounts payable i.e., goods and services which 
have been delivered and accepted during the year charged against appropriations of 
prior year/s, after satisfying their regular operating requirements as reflected in their 
Monthly Cash Program. 

 
c. Moreover, Section 5 of the same Manual on Recording of the Receipt of NCA/NTA 

states that: “The CO/ROs/OUs shall record in the RANCA/RANTA all 
NCAs/NTAs received and the amount disbursed to control and monitor unfunded 
allotments and the balance of disbursement authorities.” 



 

54 
 

 
d. During the course of our audit, we observed that the Ministry of Social Services 

Development (MSSD)- LSA were issued Notice of Fund Transfer (NFT) from 
MSSD-Regional Office in lieu of the Notice of Transfer Allocation (NTA), thus 
not in conformity with the instructions set forth in the said Manual. 

 
e. Upon examination, included in the face of NFT is the amount of transferred fund 

and the corresponding specific purpose/allocation of the fund received. 
 
f. On the other hand, the agency is monitoring the inflows and outflows of fund 

received through the preparation of Statement of Receipts and Disbursement 
(SORD). The Receipts column lists all the fund received from the Regional Office 
and the disbursement column lists details of checks issued. Also included a column 
for the balance of the fund. 

 
g. Non-compliance faithfully in the use of the prescribed format like NTA and 

RANTA reflects poor internal control. 
 
h. We recommended and the Management agreed to require the Head of: 
 

MSSD LSA to use the prescribed format of Notice of Transfer Allocation and 
Registry of Allotment and Notice of Transfer Allocation and accomplish all 
the necessary or required items therein in conformity with the provisions set 
forth in the Government Accounting Manual for National Government 
Agencies. 

 
Non-submission or delayed submission of documents/reports 

 
12. MSSD Provincial Branches failed to submit documents and reports required by 

the Audit Teams necessary for ascertaining the existence, validity and accuracy of 
transactions in their respective provinces, as presented below in Table 13.

Criteria 
 
Rule II of the Updated 2016 Revised Implementing Rules 
and Regulations (IRR) of the Republic Act (R.A.) No. 
9184 otherwise known as the Government Procurement 
Act has the following provisions pertaining to 
procurement planning: 
 
11.2. “7.1. All procurement shall be within the 
approved budget of the Procuring Entity and should be 
meticulously and judiciously planned by the Procuring 
Entity. Consistent with government fiscal discipline 
measures, only those considered crucial to the efficient 
discharge of governmental functions shall be included in 
the Annual Procurement Plan (APP). For purposes of this 
IRR, a procurement project shall be considered crucial to 
the efficient discharge of governmental functions if it is 
required for the day-to-day operations or is in pursuit of 
the principal mandate of the Procuring Entity concerned. 
The APP shall include provisions for foreseeable 
emergencies based on historical records. In the case of 
Infrastructure Projects, the APP shall consider the 
appropriate timing/phasing of related project activities, 
such as, engineering design and acquisition of right-of-
way site or location, to reduce/lower project costs. 
 
7.2. No procurement shall be undertaken unless it is in 
accordance with the approved APP, including approved 
changes thereto. The APP must be consistent with the 
duly approved yearly budget of the Procuring Entity and 
shall bear the approval of the Head of the Procuring 
Entity (HoPE) or second-ranking official designated by 
the HoPE to act on his behalf. 
 
Cause  
 
The HoPE failed to strictly impose and enjoin the 
concerned personnel to prepare the APP. 
 
Effect 
 
The procurement of supplies and goods was made not in 
accordance with the above-mentioned provisions of law 
and therefore could be subjected for legal sanctions.

2. Observation 
 
Failure to submit copies of the MOA/Trust 
Agreement, and Official Receipt and other salient 
documents to support all funds received from MSSD 
BARMM RO during the year, hence we cannot 
ascertain the existence, correctness and validity of 
transactions for which the funds are intended 
contrary to COA Circular No. 94-013 and COA 
Circular No. 2012-001.  
 
Criteria 
 
Fund transfers should be properly taken up in the books 
of both agencies, used only for the purpose intended, and 
properly accounted and reported in adherence to COA 
Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994. 
 
Required documents from implementing agency under 
3.1.2 of COA Circular No. 2012-001: 
 
•  Necessary supporting documents depending on the 
nature  
   of transactions 
•  Copy of MOA/Trust Agreement 
•  Copy of OR upon receipt of fund transferred 
•  Copy of OR issued by the Source Agency evidencing 
    refund of unexpended/unutilized balance of fund 
transfer 
 
 
Cause 
 
The concerned personnel took for granted the 
AOMs/reminders of the Audit Team furnish the latter 
with the required documents for audit purposes. 
 
 
Effect 
 
Receipt and utilization of funds were not properly 
recorded and the assigned auditors could were not fully 
informed thereof hence showing poor financial

3. Observation 
 
Management failed to respond with COA’s yearly 
request and/or demand to submission of agency’s 
annual accomplishment, thus evaluation on the actual 
accomplishments/performance of the agency during 
the year in relation with its plans and targets on its 
programs, projects and activities in the Province of 
Sulu could not be eventually made, and the result of 
evaluation could not be reported by the assigned 
Audit Team/Auditor in its annual audit report as 
required under regulations. 
 
Criteria 
 
Section 122. Submission of reports. Whenever deemed 
necessary in the exigencies of the service, the 
Commission may under regulations issued by it require 
the agency heads, chief accountants, budget officers, 
cashiers, disbursing officers,  administrative or personnel 
officers, and other responsible officials of the various 
agencies to submit trial balances, physical inventory 
reports, current plantilla of personnel, and such other 
reports as may be necessary for the exercise of its 
functions. 
 
(2) Failure on the part of the officials concerned to submit 
the documents and reports mentioned herein shall 
automatically cause the suspension of payment of their 
salaries until they shall have complied with the 
requirements of the Commission. 
 
(3) No appropriation authorized in the General

Section 100 of the Government Auditing Code of the 
Philippines (P.D. 1445) provides that “Disbursing 
officers in any government agency shall render monthly 
reports of their financial transactions pursuant to 
regulations of the Commission on Audit to be submitted 
not later than the fifth day of the ensuing month to the 
auditor concerned who shall conduct the necessary 
examination and audit within thirty days from receipt 
thereof”. 
 

 
a. On APP and PPMP, MSSD LSA asserted that the concerned personnel already 

prepared the APP and its corresponding PPMP as it is also demanded by their 
BARMM Regional Office. Hence verbal request for a copy of the said reports for 
the verification of the goods procured for the current year but weeks after, without 
receiving the same, we sent Demand Letter dated March 2, 2021 duly received by 
the Management. Still, the agency failed to submit the supposed reports to the 
Office of the Auditor up to date. 

 
b. On MOA, Trust Agreement and OR, and Annual Accomplishment Report, the 

Auditor of the MSSD Tawi-Tawi said that AOM was already sent to the 
management to comply with the observation but management failed to do so. 

 
c. On RAAF, the Auditor of the MSSD Sulu noticed that no monthly Report 

Accountability for Accountable Forms (RAAF) were submitted by the accountable 
officer to the Audit Team during the calendar year, hence reiterated the audit 
observation in 2019 on the same lapses of the agency.  

 
d. We recommended and the Management agreed to require the Heads of: 

 
i. MSSD LSA, LSB, and Sulu to direct the immediate submission of the 2020 

APP and the PPMP to the Office of the Auditor. If the mentioned reports 
are not yet done, we strongly recommend that Management direct the 
concerned officials to prepare and submit the APP and its corresponding 
PPMP the earliest possible time (#2 Observation). 

 
ii. MSSD Tawi-Tawi to direct the bookkeeper and disbursing officer to 

immediately submit the lacking supporting documents to the Audit Team 
to help the latter validate and ascertain which programs or activities the 
funds are intended and utilized for (#3 Observation). 

 
iii. MSSD Sulu to direct the concerned personnel to prepare the 2020 annual 

accomplishment report and submit the same to the Audit Team the soonest

possible. 
 

iv. MSSD Sulu to direct the concerned accountable officer to prepare and 
submit monthly Report of Accountability for Accountable Forms (RAAF) 
to the Audit Team with RCI, ROD and other required mandatory 
accounting reports.  

 
Compliance with Other Mandatory Accounts 

 
13. Except for the under-remittance to BIR of P2,937,686.71, MSSD BARMM 

religiously withheld and remitted all the mandatory deductions pursuant to the 
rules and regulations of the BIR, GSIS, PHIC and HDMF. 

 
a. For CY 2020, taxes and premiums were deducted from the salaries of the 

employees within the prescribed period and remitted to the concerned institutions. 
 
b. However, under-remittance amounting to P2,937,686.71 was noted in MSSD

61 
 

 
 
a. During post-audit of transactions, we noticed that MSSD BARMM RO and MSSD 

Sulu failed to submit, as of date, the required disbursement vouchers and supporting 
documents hence the Audit Teams were not able to examine and audit the COVID 19 
transactions. 

 
b. MSSD BARMM record showed that the Agency received Quick Response Funds from 

the Office of the Chief Minister intended for COVID 19 totaling P200,000,000.00. 
P181,969,296.00 of which was disbursed, and P124,174,582.06 was recorded as 
liquidated, subject for post-audit. 

 
c. We recommended and the Management agreed to require the Heads of:  
 

i. MSSD BARMM RO to faithfully comply with the rules and regulation on the 
Granting, Utilization and Liquidations of Fund Transfers pursuant to COA 
Circular 94-013 dated December 13, 1994; grant no additional fund transfer 
or cash advances not until the previous ones are fully liquidated; and if 
warranted, hold the salaries and benefits of the officers or employees 
responsible. 
 

ii. MSSD Sulu to submit all documentary requirement for emergency purchases 

Par. 6.5. of COA Circular No. 94-013 
provides that “Within ten (10) days after 
receipt from the AO, the Accountant 
shall verify the Reports, provide 
accounting entries, record and submit the

the originals of vouchers/payrolls and all 
supporting documents to the IA Auditor. 
The Accountant shall ensure that only 
expenses for the project are included in 
the Reports.  He shall submit the original 
copy of the Reports to the SA (Attention: 
The SA Accountant). 
 
Cause 
 
The accounting personnel concerned 
were not able to gather all liquidation 
documents within the prescribed period. 
 
Effect 
 
Report of disbursements are doubtful and 
therefore could be relied upon in audit.

d. MSSD BARMM RO committed to exert utmost effort to get the liquidation reports 

of the COVID 19 fund, and already sent an e-copy of the liquidation report of the 
200M COVID Fund to OCM. 

 
Unliquidated Fund Transfer of MSSD BARMM RO 

 

15. The MSSD BARMM RO has unliquidated fund transfer from nationally funded 
programs amounting to P1,424,364,339.67 due to delayed submission of 
liquidations by the operating units contrary to Par. 6.5 of COA Circular No. 94-
013, hence we cannot ascertain whether or not such funds were properly utilized. 

 
a. Par. 6.5. Within ten (10) days after receipt from the AO, the Accountant shall verify 

the Reports, provide accounting entries, record and submit the duplicate copies of 
the Reports with all the originals of vouchers/payrolls and all supporting documents 
to the IA Auditor.  The Accountant shall ensure that only expenses for the project

c. We recommended and the Management agreed to require the Head of: 

 
MSSD BARMM RO to faithfully comply with the rules and regulation on the 
Granting, Utilization and Liquidations of Fund Transfers pursuant to COA 
Circular 94-013 dated December 13, 1994; grant no additional fund transfer 
or cash advances not until the previous ones are fully liquidated; and if 
warranted, hold the salaries and benefits of the officers or employees 
responsible. 

 
Non-submission of GAD Plan and Budget and Accomplishment Report 

 
16. The MSSD BARMM RO and its Branches failed to submit its 2020 Approved 

Annual GAD Plan and Budget (GBP) and the corresponding GAD 
Accomplishment Report within the prescribed period contrary to COA Circular 
No. 2014-001, Section 30 of GAA, and Par. 6.1 of PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint 
Circular No. 2012-01. 

 
a. Par. V. COA Circular No. 2014-001. The Audited agency shall submit a copy of 

the Annual GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) to the COA Audit Team assigned to the 
agency within five (5) working days from the receipt of the approved plan from the 
PCW or their mother or central offices as the case maybe. Likewise, a copy of the 
corresponding Accomplishment Report shall be furnished the said Audit Team 
within five (5) working days from the end of January of the preceding year. 

 
b. Section 30 of the General Provisions of GAA for FY 2018 provides that “all 

agencies of the government shall formulate a GAD Plan designed to address gender 
issues within their concerned sectors or mandate and implement applicable 
provisions under R.A. No. 9710 or the Magna Carta of Women, Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the Beijing Platform 
for Action, the Millennium Development Goals (2005-2015), the Philippine Plan 
for Gender-Responsive Development (1995- 2025), and the Philippine 
Development Plan (2017-2022).  

 
c. Paragraph (6.1) of PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01 provides that: 

“At least five percent (5%) of the total agency budget appropriations authorized 
under the annual GAA shall correspond to activities supporting GAD plans and 
programs. The GAD budget shall be drawn from the agency’s maintenance and 
other operating expenses (MOOE), capital outlay (CO), and personal services (PS).  



 

64 
 

 
d. Upon inquiry, we learned that the agency has no GAD focal point, and no annual 

GAD Plan and Budget and accomplishment report was made hence it failed to 
allocate at least 5% of the total agency appropriation. Take note that the GAD budget 
is not an additional fund to be downloaded by the DBM nor by the Ministry, it is 
rather an attributed cost. So that when an operating unit received an allocation from 
the Ministry, at least 5% of that allocation is attributed to GAD activities.   

 
e. We recommended and the Management agreed to require the Head of: 
 
MSSD BARMM RO to immediately create an active and responsive GAD Focal 

Point; timely prepare and submit to Audit Team the GAD Plan and Budget 
for 2021, and submit the pertinent accomplishment report. 

 
f. Management commented that the agency has no GAD focal point, but the latter 

committed to organize its GAD focal point for the ensuing year to implement GAD 
activities as one of its priorities.
