PART II - OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

 

1. We acknowledge the comments of the Department of Health (DOH) Management on 
our audit observations and recommendations.  Some of these comments, particularly those 

given by the DOH-Central Office (DOH-CO) were included in this Report, where appropriate. 

As to the updated comments of the Operating Units (OUs), we recommend that these be 

reviewed by the DOH-CO’s Audit Committee based on our recommendations to the Secretary 

of Health (SOH) stated herein, and that said comments be submitted by the OUs to their 

respective Audit Teams for the latter’s further evaluation in coming up with appropriate audit 

decisions.  The deficiencies noted in audit are summarized in the following paragraphs:  

 

Financial Matters 

 

Accounting errors and omissions 

 

2. The asset, liabilities and equity accounts of the DOH had errors and omissions 
misstating their year-end balances by ₱70,894,401,298.55, ₱944,035,967.72 and 

₱70,171,552,317.53, respectively, which represent 26.97%, 3.66% and 29.60% of said 

account groups.  Due to the significant impact of such misstatements on the reported 

balances of the affected accounts, Management’s assertions as to the completeness, 

accuracy, cut-off, classification, existence, rights and obligations, valuation and 

allocation, presentation, and understandability of the said accounts could not be relied 

upon. 

 

3. Paragraph 15 of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) 1, 
Presentation of Financial Statements (FS), describes FS as structured representation of the 

financial position and financial performance of an entity.  The standard further states that the 

objectives of general-purpose FS are to provide information about the financial position, 

financial performance, and cash flows of an entity that is useful to a wide range of users in 

making and evaluating decisions about the allocation of resources.  Specifically, the objectives 

of general-purpose financial reporting in the public sector should be to provide information 

useful for decision making, and to demonstrate the accountability of the entity for the 

resources entrusted to it by: 
 

a. Providing information about the sources, allocation, and uses of financial 
resources; 

b. Providing information about how the entity financed its activities and met its 
cash requirements; 

c. Providing information that is useful in evaluating the entity’s ability to finance 
its activities and to meet its liabilities and commitments; 

d. Providing information about the financial condition of the entity and changes in 
it; and 

e. Providing aggregate information useful in evaluating the entity’s performance in 
terms of service costs, efficiency and accomplishments.

4. The complete set of general purpose FS consists of: 
 

a. Statement of Financial Position; 
b. Statement of Financial Performance; 
c. Statement of Changes in Net Assets/Equity; 
d. Statement of Cash Flows; 
e. Statement of Comparison of Budget and Actual Amounts; and 
f. Notes to the Financial Statements, comprising a summary of significant 

accounting policies and other explanatory notes.  
 

5. Paragraph 27 of IPSAS 1 further states that the FS shall present fairly the financial 
position, financial performance and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the 

faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance 

with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set 

out in IPSAS. The application of IPSAS, with additional disclosures when necessary, is 

presented to result in FS that achieve a fair presentation. 
 

6. When an audited entity presents its FS, it is implicitly making assertions that certain 
conditions have been fulfilled in the accounts, among which are as follows: 

 
Table I. FS Assertions Affected 

Assertion Condition 

Completeness All transactions and events that should be recorded have been recorded. 

Accuracy All transactions and events were recorded without error; all information disclosed is in the correct amounts, 
and which reflect their proper values. 

Cut-off All transactions and events were recorded within the correct reporting period. 

Classification All transactions have been recorded in the proper accounts; assets, liabilities and equity interests have 
been recorded in the proper accounts. 

Existence All account balances exist for assets, liabilities, and equity. 

Rights and 
obligations 

The entity holds or controls the rights to assets, and liabilities are the obligations of the entity. 

Valuation and 
allocation 

Assets, liabilities, and equity interests have been included in the FS at appropriate amounts and any 
resulting valuation or allocation adjustments have been appropriately recorded. 

Presentation For account balances - assets, liabilities and equity interests are appropriately aggregated or 
disaggregated and clearly described, and related disclosures are relevant and understandable in the 
context of the requirements of the applicable financial reporting framework. 

Understandability The information included in the FS has been appropriately presented and is clearly understandable. 

 

7. The responsibility for the fair presentation and reliability of FS rests with the 
Management of the reporting entity, particularly the head of finance/accounting office and the 

head of entity or his authorized representative, as provided in the Philippine Application 

Guidance (PAG) 4 on IPSAS I and Section 4, Chapter 19 of the Government Accounting 

Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I.  

 

8. In our audit of the DOH’s accounts, we noted accounting errors and misstatements 
which were not adjusted as at year-end, as shown in Table II.

10. The errors found in Cash accounts were attributed to the non-recording of receipt of 
collections and fund transfers, deposits, interest income, deposits of trust receipts, non-

restoration of unreleased commercial checks at year-end, non-cancellation of stale checks, 

unrecorded remittances of contributions, absence of periodic reconciliation of records, non-

compliance with pertinent rules and regulations and inability to institute sound financial 

controls. 

 

11. Due to the significant impact of the foregoing accounting errors/omissions on the 
reported balance of the Cash accounts, Management’s assertions as to accuracy, classification, 

completeness, and rights and obligations on the said accounts could not be relied upon. 

 

12. We recommended and the Secretary of Health (SOH), through the 
Administration and Financial Management Team (AFMT), agreed to instruct the 

Central Office (CO) and concerned operating units (OUs) to record the necessary 

adjusting entries in the books of accounts based on relevant and sufficient supporting 

documents.

14. The errors found were attributed to the absence of periodic reconciliation of records, 
non-compliance with pertinent rules and regulations and inability to institute sound financial 

controls.   

 

15. These adversely affected Management’s assertions on the completeness, accuracy, 
existence, classification and valuation of the year-end balances of Receivables in the 

Statement of Financial Position.  The conditions presented likewise impact on the ability to 

manage its receivable accounts, proper implementation of programs, activities and projects, 

and in general, safeguard its assets and public funds entrusted to its care.   

 

16. We recommended and the SOH, through the AFMT, agreed to direct the CO and 
concerned OUs to: 

 

a. immediately conduct reconciliation of records and accomplish the same 
within a specific time-frame; 

 

b. record the necessary adjusting entries in the books of accounts based on 
relevant and sufficient supporting documents; 

 

c. henceforth, comply strictly with pertinent rules and regulations; and

d. conduct thorough evaluation, assessment and investigation of outstanding 
accounts, and record impairment and other adjustments thereof.

18. Our audit showed that despite prior years’ audit recommendations, the deficiencies 
were still caused by the failure to conduct periodic physical count, incomplete inventory 

reports, failure to maintain and update complete accounting records, non-evaluation of 

inventory items for impairment and non-conformance to established guidelines in the 

management of inventories, among others. 

 

19. The noted accounting errors affected Management’s assertions on the completeness, 
accuracy, cut-off, existence, classification and valuation of the year-end balances of 

Inventories in the Statement of Financial Position. 

 

20. The continued neglect of settling the errors in various inventory accounts and the 
apparent lack of interest in clearing the current year’s inventory variances as evidenced by the 

inaction, considered to be the root cause of the problem, violate the pertinent provisions of 

Presidential Decree (PD) 1445 on adequacy of needed information and has resulted to the 

presentation of unreliable, inaccurate and misleading financial information of the DOH.   

 

21. We recommended and the SOH, through the AFMT, agreed to direct the CO and 
OUs to: 



84 

 

 

a. strategize and come up with documented plans on how they can reconcile the 
variances between inventory balances shown in the FS and those of the 

supply records and inventory reports, with the plan clearly stating the 

specific responsibilities of personnel involved, targets and timelines, among 

others, and implementation thereof be strictly monitored;  

 

b. after reconciliation, for the Accountants to effect necessary adjustments in 
their respective records to establish the correct inventory balances based on 

sufficient supporting documents; and 

 

c. impose sanctions on erring personnel, on the basis of Section 127 of PD 1445, 
both those who are responsible for any loss of inventories and those who are 

negligent in their duties causing the continued presence of variance between 

book and physical count balances.

23. Our audit showed that there have been no considerable efforts on the part of some OUs 
to rectify the deficiencies noted in previous years concerning the PPE accounts.  This is 

evidenced by the unsettled errors and omissions already communicated to their respective 

Management in prior audit reports but were still observed in the current year’s audit, and the 

existence of additional deficiencies noted, which grossly affect the reliability of the reported 

PPE balances as well as Management assertions of completeness, existence, valuation, rights 

and disclosure, inherent in the fair presentation of the FS. 

 

24. The material amounts of discrepancy which have been present since the past years 
have not been verified, investigated, adjusted and cleared as required by existing regulations.  

There was no running or test inventory done for the purpose of ascertaining the correctness of 

records and determining any possible losses and even with the conduct of year-end physical 

count was not taken by the DOH. 

 

25. The continued inability in resolving the decades-old problem involving PPE accounts 
directly resulted in the release of unreliable financial information on the true state of DOH 

assets and its power to take full control over its PPE.   

 



87 

 

26. We recommended and the SOH, through the AFMT, agreed to direct the CO and 
OUs to:  

 

a. effect the necessary adjusting entries in the books of accounts based on 
relevant and sufficient supporting documents; and   

 

b. impose sanctions on erring personnel, on the basis of Section 127 of PD 1445, 
both those who are responsible for any loss of inventories and those who are 

negligent in their duties causing the continued presence of variance between 

book and physical count balances.

28. The GAM for NGAs, Volume III, define the account Computer Software as being used 
to recognize the purchase cost or capitalized development cost of computer software programs 

for use in government operation. Development costs include cost of coding, testing and cost 

to produce product masters. The account is credited for obsolescence, transfers or other 

disposal. 

 

29. Our audit showed that there was erroneous recording of computer software items as 
ICT Equipment in the total amount of ₱2,566,290.00 in the books of NSC-Min and WV-CHD 

and that the same remained not adjusted as at year-end. 

 

30. The deficiency, caused by non-compliance with the GAM, resulted in the 
overstatement of ICT Equipment and the consequent understatement of the Computer 

Software account.  It also adversely affected Management’s assertions on the classification of 

intangible assets in the Statement of Financial Position. 

 

31. We recommended and the SOH, through the AFMT, agreed to direct the 
concerned OUs to record the necessary adjusting entries in their books of accounts.

33. The misstatements noted were caused by the failure to recognize the unexpired portion 
of insurance premiums, unrecorded liquidations, wrong usage of accounts, under-recording, 

double posting and erroneous amounts posted for cash advances and advances to contractors, 

and recording of undelivered food supplies. 

 

34. The deficiencies noted adversely affect the reliability of the reported balances of Other 
Assets as well as Management assertions of completeness, accuracy, cut-off, classification and 

existence of said balances. 

 

35. The reliability and correctness of year-end balances of affected accounts were 
therefore compromised because of the errors detected.

effect the necessary accounting entries to correct the book balances of the Other Asset 

accounts and, henceforth, observe the proper classification of accounts.

38. As found, the misstatements were due to erroneous recording of assets and 
corresponding liabilities, non-recognition of transfers/turn-over of assets to OUs, failure to 

record fund transfers, unrecognized liabilities for services rendered, non-accrual of liability 

items, unrecorded deposits of trust receipts, non-restoration of unreleased commercial checks 

at year-end, failure to cancel stale checks, non-reversion of invalid, unsupported and past due 

payables, unrecorded mandatory remittances to various government institutions, unrecorded 

reimbursements from the Interim Reimbursement Mechanism (IRM) fund, and erroneous set-
up of payable accounts for not-yet-incurred expenditures, among others.

39. The year-end balances of liability accounts are therefore materially misstated. The 
noted accounting errors grossly affected Management’s assertions on the completeness, 

accuracy, cut-off, existence and classification of the year-end balances of liability accounts in 

the Statement of Financial Position. 

 

40. We recommended and the SOH, through the AFMT, agreed to direct the CO and 
concerned OUs to cause the recording of adjustments in their books of accounts based 

on sufficient supporting documents and henceforth, comply with all relevant rules and 

regulations in the recognition of liabilities.

42. These misstatements, caused by non-compliance with pertinent accounting 
regulations, resulted in erroneous account balances in the books of accounts of the DOH and 

its OUs. These were attributed to: (a) late submission or non-submission of reports by 

concerned offices (i.e., Supply Chain Offices, General Services Offices, among others,) to the 

Accounting Division;  (b) lack of coordination and monitoring procedures on flow of 

transactions by the concerned offices and the Accounting Division; (c) lack of necessary 

documentation to support adjusting entries;  (d) erroneous entries being overlooked by the 

Accountants; (e) absence of official pronouncements as to accounting treatment of particular 

transactions department-wide; and (f) lack of financial audit conducted by the Internal Audit 

Service (IAS). 

 

43. The noted errors and omissions in recording and reporting financial transactions 
inevitably affected the fair presentation of the accounts in the FSs of the OUs and that of the 

DOH as a whole, and grossly affected Management’s assertions on the completeness, 

accuracy, cut-off, existence, classification, rights and obligations, valuation, presentation and 

understandability of the reported balances in the FS. 

 

44. It is worth noting that there are few OUs which had already effected adjusting entries 
to correct some errors in CY 2021. However, their year-end FS still include the 

aforementioned errors, thus, still rendering the reported balances erroneous and unreliable. 

 

45. We recommended and the SOH, through the AFMT, agreed to direct : 
 

The Accountants to: 

 

a. effect the necessary adjustments on the errors and omissions, among others, 
the erroneous recording of transactions as well as misclassification of accounts 

to correct the reported balances of affected accounts in the FS;  

 

b. effect the necessary restatement entries to correct the final and beginning 
balances of the 2020 consolidated FS; and 

 

c. observe the proper recording, adjustments and reclassifications of accounts 
and transactions, and that all transactions be supported with necessary 

documentations in accordance with the IPSAS, GAM for NGAs and other 

existing accounting rules and regulations;  

 

 



93 

 

 The Heads of OUs to: 

 

d. formulate and strictly implement internal control policies requiring timely 
submission of reports consistent with requirements in the GAM and 

immediate submission of supporting documents to their respective accounting 

units for recording purposes, taking into account the deadlines and imposition 

of corresponding penalties for non-compliance, and for strict adherence 

thereto by the process owners and other responsible offices; and 

 

e. submit complete documentation and improve financial controls in their 
respective agencies and ensure that only transactions with complete and 

proper documentations are recorded; and 

 

The IAS to: 

 

f. develop audit strategies and systems and conduct financial audit on all DOH 
offices in accordance with the Internal Auditing Standards for the Philippine 

Public Sector and the Internal Control Standards for the Philippine Public 

Sector prescribed under COA Circular No. 2018-003 dated November 21, 

2018, and submit recommendations to the SOH on courses of actions that need 

to be implemented in order to avoid errors and misstatements in the books of 

accounts.

Unaccounted discrepancies in cash balances - ₱101,845,218.21   

 

46. The existence of unaccounted discrepancies in Cash accounts totaling 
₱101,845,218.21 affected the reliability of year-end cash accounts. 

 

47. Section 74 of PD No. 1445 states that at the close of each month, depositories shall 
report to the agency head, in such form as he may direct, the condition of the agency account 

standing on their books. The head of the agency shall see to it that a reconciliation is made 

between the balance shown in the reports and the balance found in the books of the agency. 

 

48. Section 111 thereof requires that the accounts of an agency shall be kept in such detail 
as is necessary to meet the needs of the agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish 

the information needed by fiscal or control agencies of the government. The highest standards 

of honesty, objectivity and consistency shall be observed in the keeping of accounts to 

safeguard against inaccurate or misleading information. 

 

49. We have noted in our audit that there were discrepancies in Cash accounts totaling 
₱101,845,218.21 which the concerned OUs could not account mainly due to unavailability of 

bank statements and uncorrected errors in posting in subsidiary ledgers (SLs). Details are 

shown in Table XII.

VIII EV-CHD Cash in Bank - LCCA The closing of SALAG account was erroneously posted 
to OSEC-SASAKAWA while UNICEF collections were 
erroneously posted in SALAG. The Renal Disease and 
REDCOP are just one account but posted separately. Per 
SL, SRTD had no beginning balance but this account was 
closed in March 2018. Thus, it can be concluded that the 
existence of balances was due to erroneous posting in 
the SL and unreliable beginning balances.   

10,091,964.24 

IX BasGH Cash in Bank-LCCA The reconciling items arose because of the unavailability 
of bank statements for all months in 2013 until 2015. 
Hence, the nature of these differences cannot be 
established.  Despite a request made to LBP- Basilan 
Branch on June 20, 2016 for copies of the bank 
statements from 2015 to May 2016 to facilitate 
reconciliation of the agency’s records, only the bank 
statements for the months of CY 2016 were provided.

recorded in lump sum by the Accountant at month-end 
documented by monthly bank statement regardless of the 
date of issuance of ORs by the Cashier and recognition 
of such as part of Cashier's accountabilities. 

14,737,547.39 

TOTAL          101,845,218.21 

 

50. Said deficiencies indicate failure of concerned OUs to immediately address the causes 
of the discrepancies resulting in their non-correction up to the year-end, thus, the reliability of 

the reported Cash accounts balance is negated. 

 

51. We recommended and the SOH, through the AFMT, agreed to direct the OUs to 
immediately reconcile all cash records, settle all deficiencies noted in cash accounts and 

effect adjustments when needed. 
 

 

 



96 

 

Improper handling of receivables - ₱49,121,153,305.23  

 

52. The inability of the CO and some OUs to properly handle and monitor their 
receivables led to the non-collection and/or non-liquidation of receivables amounting to 

₱3,496,940,596.58 for more than three to 10 years and ₱1,619,333,785.48 for more than 
10 years.  

 

53. The reported receivables of the DOH consisted of accounts receivable, fund transfers 
to other government agencies and non-government organizations/civil society organizations, 

receivables from officers and employees and other receivables. These are expected to be 

collected and/or liquidated within one year, thus, they are aptly categorized as current assets 

in the FS. 

 

54. The accounting procedures on inter-agency transferred funds and write-off of 
receivables have been prescribed in several COA issuances such as Circular Nos. 94-013 dated 

December 13, 1994, 2007-001 dated October 25, 2007, 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016, 

and 2016-022 dated December 19, 2016. 

 

55. In our review of receivables, we found that relevant guidelines/regulations were not 
strictly complied with in the management of these accounts totaling ₱49,121,153,305.23, 

resulting in the non-collection and/or non-liquidation of receivables amounting to 

₱3,496,940,596.58 for more than three to 10 years and ₱1,619,333,785.48 for more than 10 

years, as shown in the Aging Schedule in Annex II, Table 1.   

 

56. Other deficiencies such as unreconciled balances with debtors’/implementing 
agencies’ records, unreconciled amounts between accounting records and Accounts 

Receivable (AR) schedule, non-preparation of AR schedule and absence of periodic 

reconciliation, as presented in Annex II, Table 2.   

 

57. These observations were mainly caused by the non-institutionalization of accounting 
guidelines/regulations within the DOH system. 

 

58. As a result, the valuation and accuracy of year-end receivable balances were rendered 
doubtful. 

 

59. We recommended and the SOH agreed to: 
 

a. issue appropriate orders/memoranda/circulars institutionalizing existing 
guidelines/regulations on the management of receivable accounts within the 

DOH system and exact strict compliance thereof; and 

 

b. remind the CO and OUs to immediately settle all deficiencies noted in the audit 
of receivable accounts, record necessary adjustments, and impose 

administrative sanctions on negligent/erring personnel concerned. 

 

 



97 

 

Deficiencies in inventory accounts  
 

60.  The pertinent rules, policies and procedures in accounting and management of 
inventories were not faithfully adhered to raising doubts on the existence and accuracy 

of the reported year-end balances of the Inventory accounts, thereby affecting the 

reliability and fair presentation thereof in the FS. 
 

61. Chapter 8 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, prescribes the inventory accounting 
system which consists of the system of monitoring, controlling and recording of acquisition 

and disposal of inventory. Physical count of inventories, which is required semi-annually, is 

an indispensable procedure for checking the integrity of property custodianship. 
 

62. Our audit revealed deficiencies in accounting and management of inventories such as 
failure to conduct physical inventory and to submit their Report on Physical Count of 

Inventories (RPCI), non-maintenance of Supplies Ledger Cards (SLCs) and Stock Cards 

(SCs), non-preparation of Report on Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI), and other 

deficiencies.   Details are shown in Annex III. 
 

63. Said deficiencies are attributed to lack of manpower as well as the restrictions brought 
about by the COVID-19 pandemic. 

 

64. These conditions, Management’s assertions on the completeness, existence and 
accuracy of the year-end balance of Inventories could not be relied upon. 

 

65. We recommended and the SOH, through the AFMT, agreed to direct the 
concerned OUs to: 
 

a. ensure the conduct of semi-annual physical count of inventories and 

reconciliation of accounting and supply records; and 
 

b. direct the Accountants and supply officers to maintain SLCs and SCs, 

respectively; and 
 

c. consider assigning sufficient manpower in their accounting and supply units.    
 

Deficiencies in PPE accounts - ₱29,274,787,446.69 
 

66. The persisting failure of the CO and various OUs to conduct reconciliation 
activities, mismanagement of accounting and property records and other deficiencies 

involving PPEs with total value of ₱29,274,787,446.69 cast doubt on the reliability of 
reported PPE balances in the FS. 
 

67. Pertinent provisions of Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs, IPSAS 17 and other 
governmental issuances regulate the proper accounting and recording of transactions 

involving PPE accounts. 
 

68. Our audit revealed accounting deficiencies which further adversely affected the 
completeness, accuracy, existence, rights and obligations, valuation and allocation of PPE 



98 

 

balances in the FS.  Most notable are the non-assessment of the physical conditions of 

equipment for impairment and unaccounted variances between accounting and property 

records affecting PPEs aggregating at least ₱33,204,355,907.38.  Details are provided in Table 

XIII and XIV.

NCR DOH-CO 1,746,415,542.91  Paragraph 26, IPSAS 21, Impairment of Non-Cash Generating Assets, states 
that at each reporting date, an entity shall assess whether there is an indication 
that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the entity shall 
estimate the recoverable service amount of the asset. 
 
The policies and procedures on impairment of non-cash generating PPEs are 
provided in Section 28, Chapter 10 of the GAM, Volume I. 

Non-maintenance of 
PPELC 

NCR POC 877,872,921.51 Section 42, Chapter 10 of the GAM, Volume I, requires the Chief Accountant 
to maintain the PPE Ledger Card (PPELC) for each category of PPE including 
work and other animals, livestock etc. The PPELC shall be kept to record 
promptly the acquisition, description, custody, estimated useful life, 
depreciation, impairment loss, disposal and other information about the asset. 
For check and balance, the Property and Supply Office/Unit shall likewise 
maintain Property Card (PC) for PPE in their custody to account for the 
receipt and disposition of the same. The balance per PC shall be reconciled 
with PPELC maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit. They shall also be 
reconciled with other property records like Property Acknowledgement 
Receipt (PAR).

69. The continued neglect of settling the problems besetting the PPE accounts and 
apparent lack of interest in clearing the current year’s unreconciled balances and other 

deficiencies noted as evidenced by its inaction and considered to be the root cause of the 

problem, violate the relevant provisions of PD 1445 on adequacy of needed information and 

has resulted to the presentation of unreliable, inaccurate and misleading financial information

whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired, and to follow the 

policies and procedures on impairment of non-cash generating PPEs as 

provided in Section 28, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I; 

 

b. submit their individual plans on how to, once and for all, resolve the problems 
encountered in the conduct of periodic physical count and reconciliation 

activities; and 

 

c. after reconciliation and within a specific time-frame, direct the Accountants 
to effect necessary adjustments in their respective records to establish the 

correct PPE balances based on sufficient supporting documents. 

 

Unaccounted liability account balances - ₱705,192,805.59 

 

71. The accuracy of year-end balances of liability accounts is unreliable due to the 
presence of abnormal and unreconciled accounts. 

 

72. Under prevailing general accounting principles, an account balance is abnormal when 
the reported balance does not comply with the normal debit or credit balance established in 

the Revised Chart of Accounts. An abnormal general ledger account balance is an accounting 

irregularity caused by the incorrect posting of transactions or by an operational issue such as 

over-obligation. 

 

73. On the other hand, reconciling the accounts is a particularly important activity for 
agencies because it is an opportunity to check for fraudulent activity and prevent financial 

statement errors. Reconciliation is typically done at regular intervals, such as monthly or

quarterly, as part of normal accounting procedures.  When reconciling an account, agencies 

verify that every transaction sums to the correct ending account balance. Generally, there are 

two ways to reconcile an account: reviewing documents and reviewing analytics. 

 

74. Based on our review of accounts, it was noted that liabilities in the total amount of 
₱705,192,805.59 either have abnormal or unreconciled balances.  Details are provided in

75. The OUs’ continued neglect in ascertaining and addressing the reasons/factors that led 
to these balances has resulted in the unreliability of affected account balances and accuracy 

of DOH’s financial reporting. 

 

76. We recommended and the SOH, through the AFMT, agreed to direct the OU 
Accountants, through the AFMT, to review, analyze and reconcile all liability 

accounts/balances and prepare necessary adjustments in the books of accounts. 

 

77. Management commented that the DOH through the AFMT will direct the OU 
Accountants’ compliance on the noted deficiencies pertaining to liability accounts - 

reconciliation of balances and recognition of necessary adjusting entries. 

 

Non-elimination of intra-agency accounts 

 

78. The balances of intra-agency receivables/payables and subsidy from/to accounts, 
showed total differences of ₱577,556,094.51 and ₱18,379,692,578.50, respectively, 

thereby casting doubt on the correctness and reliability of their balances. 

 

79. Section 8, Chapter 20 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, states that one of the steps to 
be taken in order for the consolidated FS to present information about the economic entity as 

that of a single entity, balances, transactions, revenues, and expenses between entities within 

the economic entity shall be eliminated in full.  

 

80. Section 3.2.3 of Government Accounting and Financial Management Information 
System (GAFMIS) Circular Letter No. 2003-007 dated December 19, 2003 requires that at 

the Central Office level and in the process of consolidation, the Central Office Chief 

Accountant shall eliminate the reciprocal accounts between the Central Office and the 

Regional Offices, and between the Central Office and the Provincial Offices/Operating Units, 

if any. 

 

81. Review and analysis of the reciprocal accounts intra-agency receivables/payables and 
subsidy from/to, respectively showed total differences of ₱577,556,094.51 and 

₱18,379,692,578.50, with details shown below:

82. With the differences in balances of the corresponding reciprocal accounts, same were 
not properly eliminated during the consolidation process of the FS of the CO and OUs.  Said 

condition indicates accounting errors and omissions which were not promptly detected and 

corrected due to the lack of regular reconciliation between the CO and OUs’ records at interim 

periods. As disclosed, the breakdown of the intra-agency accounts’ year-end balances were 

likewise not provided by the Accountants of various OUs. 

 

83. It bears stressing that while subsidy accounts are closed to Revenue and Expense 
Summary account at year-end and closed to the accumulated surplus account, its non-

elimination will still result in the retention of contra-accounts debited and credited, thus, 

understating and overstating the balances found in the FS.  

 

84. The condition further contributes to the doubtful reliability of the amounts presented 
in the consolidated FS of the DOH.   

 

85. We recommended and the SOH, through the AFMT, agreed to direct: 
 

a. direct the CO’s OIC-Chief Accountant, through the AFMT and FMS, to 
conduct regular quarterly reconciliation activities for reciprocal accounts 

with the Accountants of various OUs in order to immediately rectify any 

discrepancy and to show the correct financial condition and results of 

operation of the Department as a single entity; 

 

b. require the Accountants of the OUs, through the AFMT, to: 
 

i. prepare schedules of reciprocal accounts and undertake an analysis, 
reconciliation and elimination thereof; and 



105 

 

 

ii. effect accounting entries to take up the reconciling items noted to correct 
the balances of the accounts affected after reconciliation; and  

 

iii. direct the OIC-Chief Accountant, through the AFMT and Finance 
Management Service (FMS), to prepare consolidation working papers 

and adjusting entries to eliminate in full the balances of reciprocal 

accounts in the DOH’s consolidated FS. 
 

86. Management commented that the Reconciliation with the OUs is in place.  As a result 
of the reconciliation conducted in July 2021, balances/items needing adjustment were 

identified of which, one is the receipt of Notice of Transfer of Cash Allocation (NTCA). It 

was raised during the reconciliation that some OUs recognized the NTCA transactions as 

Subsidy from Central Office while others as Subsidy from National Government.  This concern 

is subject to COA GAS proper guidance to have a uniform accounting entry, and to lessen the 

reconciling balance/item during the elimination of accounts on consolidated FS. The DOH-

CO had partially effected adjustment in the books of the identified reconciling items based on 

the submitted reports/documents from OUs. 

 

Deficiencies in the Notes to the FS 

 

87. The Notes accompanying the FS are wanting accurate and adequate disclosures 
necessary to provide Management and other users an understanding of the DOH’s FS, 

mainly due to the lack of information in the OUs’ individual FS, thus, depriving 

Management and other users thereof with the right information that could be considered 

useful in making effective decisions and informed judgements on the Department’s 

resources. 

 

88. Paragraph 127 of IPSAS 1 states that the Notes to the FS shall, among others, provide 
additional information that is not presented on the face of the statement of financial position, 

statement of financial performance, statement of changes in net assets/equity, or cash flow 

statement, but that is relevant to an understanding of any of them. 

 

89. Section 29, Chapter 2 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, states that the notes provide 
narrative descriptions or disaggregation of items disclosed in those FS and information about 

items that do not qualify for recognition in those statements.  Section 30 further provides that 

an entity shall present information including accounting policies in a manner that meets a 

number of qualitative characteristics such as understandability, relevance, materiality, 

reliability and comparability. These qualitative characteristics are the attributes that make the 

information provided in the FS useful to users. 

 

90. We observed that the Notes accompanying the DOH’s FS are wanting of adequate 
information necessary to provide Management and other users/stakeholders an understanding 

of the Department’s statements of financial position, financial performance, changes in net 

assets/equity and cash flows, such as the following:  

 



106 

 

a. explanations on the reasons for the movements (i.e. increases/decreases) of the 
account balances during the year for the Property, Plant and Equipment 

accounts; 

b. details of the movement (e.g. additions/acquisitions during the year, expensed 
during the year (cost of sales, expenses involving distribution of inventories) 

except write-down, write-down during the year, reversal of write-down during 

the year) of the increases or decreases of Inventory accounts; 

c. details of the movements of the account “Cost of Sales” in CY 2019 and 2020; 
and Cost of Sales was included as deduction to Revenue in the Statement of 

Financial Performance instead of being presented as separate expense account; 

d. details of the movement (e.g. additions/acquisitions, disposals, impairment 
loss, accumulated depreciation, amortization recognized, allowance for 

impairment) of the increases or decreases of PPE, Intangible Assets and 

Accumulated depreciation/ amortization accounts; 

e. carrying amount of temporarily idle PPE, fully depreciated PPE still in use and 
PPE retired from active use and held for disposal, and the fair value of PPE 

when this is materially different from the carrying amount;  

f. details of the movements of the Construction in Progress accounts 
g. a reconciliation of the carrying amounts at the beginning and end of the year 

for intangible assets as required in paragraph 117(e) of IPSAS 31, Intangible 

Assets; and 

h. information on the cash and in-kind donations received relative to Disaster Risk 
Reduction and Management (DRRM) as required under COA Circular No. 

COA Circular No. 2014-002 dated April 15, 2014. 

 

91. As gathered, the required disclosures were not provided due to unavailability of the 
breakdown, details and explanation of the nature of the accounts which were either not 

provided by various OUs or non-disclosure in the latter’s FS used as reference for 

consolidation. 

 

92. With the Notes to the FS disclosing inadequate information, as described in the 
preceding paragraphs, the DOH’s consolidated FS may not be considered to possess the 

qualitative characteristics of financial reporting.  Hence, Management and other users thereof 

(taxpayers, donors, lenders, other resource providers, service recipients, etc.) were not 

afforded with the right information that could be considered useful in making effective 

decisions and informed judgements on the Department’s resources, claims to those resources, 

how it used the resources to achieve its objectives, and its liquidity. 

 

93. It bears stressing that the pro-forma notes to FS presented in Annex F of GAM for 
NGAs, Volume I, prescribes and does not in any way preclude government agencies from 

providing in the notes additional information not presented in any of the FS but relevant to 

better understanding of the same. 

 

 

 

 



107 

 

94. We recommended and the SOH, through the AFMT, agreed to direct :  
 

a. enjoin all OUs to provide the necessary details/disclosures in their respective 
FS and impose appropriate sanctions on erring officials/employees who are 

remiss in the performance of their duties and responsibilities; and 

 

b. direct the AFMT to ensure that the Notes provide additional information not 
presented on the face of the FS, but relevant to full understanding of any of 

them and that such information be adequate to afford users thereof sufficient 

basis for making effective decisions and informed judgements, and to consider 

affecting revisions/modifications in the Notes to achieve this end. 

 

95. In summary, the total misstatements in Asset accounts amounted 
to ₱70,894,401,298.55 which represents 26.97% of the total assets, while the Liabilities and 

Net Assets/Equity accounts were misstated by ₱944,035,967.72 or 3.66% 

and ₱70,171,552,317.53 or 29.60%, respectively. Moreover, accounting deficiencies were 

noted in Cash, Receivables, Inventory and PPE accounts totaling ₱95,140,718,253.12 

representing 36.19% of the total assets, in Liability accounts of ₱3,229,902,013.08 or 12.51% 

of total liabilities and ₱33,388,737,795.50 or 14.08% of total equity. (Details of accounting 

errors and omissions per operating unit and details of accounting deficiencies are shown in 

Annex I.)   Due to the significant impact of these misstatements and deficiencies on the 

financial statements, we rendered an Adverse Opinion on the financial statements of the DOH 

as at year-end. 

 

Management and Governance Issues 

 

96. Section 123 of PD No. 1445 defines internal control as the plan of organization and 
all the coordinate methods and measures adopted within an organization or agency to 

safeguard its assets, check the accuracy and reliability of its accounting data, and encourage 

adherence to prescribed managerial policies.  Section 124 further provides that it shall be the 

direct responsibility of the agency head to install, implement, and monitor a sound system of 

internal control. 

 

97. Internal controls are integral mechanisms of good management processes, which are 
established in order to provide reasonable assurance that the operations are carried out 

efficiently and effectively, financial reports and operational data are reliable, and the 

applicable laws and regulations are complied with so as to achieve organizational objectives 

of the Agency. 

 

98. COA rules and regulations and Internal Control Policies prescribes that the agency 
should adopt internal control over safeguarding of assets against unauthorized acquisition, use 

or disposition. These should be effected by the Head of the Agency, Inventory Committee and 

employees designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection 

of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the entity’s assets that could have a material 

effect on the financial statements. A measure to ensure the prevention and early detection of 

loss of assets is best exercised among others through proper monitoring. 



108 

 

99. In the course of our audit, several deficiencies were observed that negate the existence 
of a sound internal control system in the CO and OUs of the DOH, as discussed in the 

following paragraphs. 

 

Deficiencies in the management of COVID-19 Funds - ₱67,323,186,570.57 

 

100. Various deficiencies involving some ₱67,323,186,570.57 worth of public funds 
and intended for national efforts of combating the unprecedented scale of the COVID-

19 crisis were noted.  These deficiencies contributed to the challenges encountered and 

missed opportunities by the DOH during the time of state of calamity/national 

emergency, and casted doubts on the regularity of related transactions. 
 

101. COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.  
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the COVID-19 virus spreads primarily 

through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or 

sneezes.  Most people infected with the virus experience mild to moderate respiratory illness 

and recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying 

medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and 

cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. 

 

102. The Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) developed the capability to 
conduct confirmatory tests for COVID-19 in response to the emergence of suspected COVID-

19 cases. It started conducting confirmatory tests on January 30, 2020. On the same day, the 

first case of COVID-19 in the Philippines was confirmed. The diagnosed patient was a 38-

year-old Chinese woman from Wuhan, who had arrived in Manila from Hong Kong on 

January 21. She was admitted to the San Lazaro Hospital in Manila. 

 

103. Several measures were imposed to mitigate the spread of the disease in the country, 
including travel bans. On March 7, 2020, the DOH raised its "Code Red Sub-Level 1" with a 

recommendation to the President of the Philippines to impose a "public health emergency" 

authorizing the DOH to mobilize resources for the procurement of safety gear and the 

imposition of preventive quarantine measures. On March 9, 2020, President Rodrigo 

Duterte issued Proclamation No. 922, declaring the country under a state of public health 

emergency.  

 

104. On March 12, 2020, President Rodrigo Roa Duterte declared "Code Red Sub-Level 2" 
issuing a partial lockdown on Metro Manila to prevent a nationwide spread of COVID-19.  

The lockdowns were expanded on March 16, 2020, placing the entirety of Luzon under an 

"Enhanced Community Quarantine" (ECQ). Other local government units outside Luzon 

followed in implementing similar lockdowns. On March 17, 2020, President Duterte issued 

Proclamation No. 929, declaring the Philippines under a state of calamity for a tentative period 

of six months.  

 

105. Additional health facilities started to conduct confirmatory testing. On March 20, 
2020, four facilities, namely: the Southern Philippines Medical Center in Davao City, Vicente 

Sotto Memorial Medical Center in Cebu City, Baguio General Hospital and Medical

Center in Benguet, and the San Lazaro Hospital in Manila (where the first COVID-19 patient 

was admitted), began conducting tests as well, augmenting the RITM. Other public and 

private facilities began operations as well in the following days.  

 

106. On March 25, 2020, the President signed RA No. 11469 or the Bayanihan to Heal as 
One Act, which gave him additional powers to handle the outbreak.   The government then 

imposed varying community quarantine levels in the provinces in the ensuing months. 

 

107. The President then signed RA No. 11494 or the Bayanihan to Recover as One Act into 
law on September 11, 2020. The period of the state of calamity was extended until September 

2021, through his Proclamation No. 1021 filed on September 18, 2020.  COVID-19 has spread 

to all provinces in the Philippines by September 28, 2020, when Batanes Province recorded 

its first case. 

 

108. In mid-December 2020, a new variant of SARS-CoV-2 known as VOC-
202012/01 was identified in the United Kingdom and is reportedly more contagious than 

earlier variants of the virus. This has led to several countries to restrict or ban travel from the 

United Kingdom, including the Philippines. The Philippines also banned travel from 19 other 

nations which has reported cases of more-infectious variants of SARS-CoV-2.   

 

109. The DOH is one of the leading government agencies tasked in the implementation of 
various programs and projects aimed at fighting the deadly COVID-19.  By virtue of Section 

1 of Executive Order No. No. 168, s. of 2014, the Secretary of Health sits as the Chairperson 

of the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID). 

 

110. In our audit of the COVID-19 funds, various deficiencies presented in Annex IV were 
found.  These deficiencies involving public funds aggregating ₱ 66,287,336,325.31 are mainly 

caused by non-compliance of pertinent laws, rules and regulations and contributed to the 

challenges encountered and missed opportunities by the DOH during the time of state of 

calamity/national emergency.  It, likewise, casted doubt on the regularity and propriety of 

related transactions.  A Consolidated Management Letter (CML) on the audit of COVID-19 

funds for the year ended December 31, 2020 was transmitted to Management on May 4, 2021 

containing our detailed audit observations and recommendations to the SOH. 

 

111. Our continuous audit also disclosed additional deficiencies involving COVID-19 
funds in the aggregate amount of ₱1,036,390,245.26 which were not included in the CML and 

these are presented in Annex V. 

 

112. Most importantly, the billions of pesos in the coffers of the DOH that have remained 
not obligated and disbursed as at year-end is counter-beneficial to the Department’s 

continuing efforts towards controlling the spread of COVID-19 through provision of quality 

health services.  It can, thus, be said that these funds that remained idle as at year-end were 

not translated to much-needed health supplies, equipment and services that could have 

benefited both the health workers and the general public during the critical times of the 

pandemic.

Lapses in the implementation of the Health Facilities Enhancement Program (HFEP) - 

₱4,057,650,623.82 

 

114. Equipment in the aggregate amount of ₱1,225,260,566.29 procured under the 
HFEP were found to be either undelivered, unutilized, and/or without calibration and 

preventive maintenance, while several HFEP infrastructure projects with total value of 

₱2,832,390,057.53 were either idle/unutilized or with substantial delay in 

implementation, thus, exposing these properties to the risks of deterioration, loss, lapse 

of warranty period and wastage of government funds, thus, depriving the public of the 

benefits they could have derived from the immediate and maximum use of said facilities 

and resulted to the non-attainment of the program objectives.  

 

115. Section 2 of PD No. 1445 states as a declared policy of the State that all resources of 
the government shall be managed, expended or utilized in accordance with law and 

regulations, and safeguarded against loss or wastage through illegal or improper disposition 

with a view to ensuring efficiency, economy and effectiveness in the operations of 

 
We recommended the Secretary of Health to: 
 
a) Require the Heads of concerned operating units to cause the refund of the meal 
allowances distributed without legal basis; 
 
b) Direct the Heads of concerned operating units strictly adhere to the provisions of RA No. 11494 and pertinent issuances of the DOH 
or other competent authorities concerning the provision of life insurance, accommodation, transportation, and meals during the state 
of national emergency; and 
 
c) Remind operating units to ensure that funds received by them are utilized exclusively for their intended purposes. 

Incomplete Documentation for Death and Sickness Compensation 
 
We recommended the Secretary of Health to: 
 
a) Require the heads of concerned operating units to cause the immediate submission of required documents and explain in writing 
their failure to attach the same in the disbursement vouchers, with the explanation subject to the evaluation of the DOH Audit 
Committee; 
 
b) Remind operating units to ensure that there should be proper approval prior to payment of the benefits as part of internal controls; 
and 
 
c) Instruct the operating units to, henceforth, strictly comply with existing rules and guidelines on the matter. 

Failure to prepare the required reports and documents for COVID-19 related donations in-kind 
 
We recommended the Secretary of Health to remind the operating units through a 
Memorandum to: (i) ensure proper monitoring of all donations in-kind received from all sources by maintaining records of receipts and 
issuance/ distribution thereof, and (ii) to 
prepare the required reports with the necessary supporting documents and submit to the NDRRM Council, through the OCD. 

Lapses in the management of IRM funds 
 
We recommended the Secretary of Health: 
 
a) Consider making representations with PHIC to facilitate the approval of utilizing IRM Fund for reimbursement of HCIs’ claims related 
to the COVID-19 cases; 
 
 b) Remind the Heads of various operating units to comply strictly with existing PHIC regulations on the IRM and effect the required 
adjustments; 
 
 c) Instruct the operating units concerned to submit written explanations on the deficiencies noted, evaluate the same and implement

government. The responsibility to take care that such policy is faithfully adhered to rests 

directly with the chief or head of the government agency concerned. 

 

116. Included by the DOH in its “Kalusugan Pangkalahatan'' strategic program is the 
improvement of access to quality health services by all Filipinos through the HFEP.  This 

program aims at (a) improving primary health facilities (RHUs, BHS) to gatekeep and deliver 

preventive health services; (b) improving quality of LGU hospitals to comply with DOH 

licensing and PhilHealth accreditation requirements as quality referral centers; and (c) 

decongesting DOH hospitals to be able to provide affordable quality tertiary care and 

specialized treatments (DOH Department Order [DO] Nos. 2015-0287 and 2016-0045). 

 

117. In the implementation of the HFEP, the DOH had issued DO No. 2012-0065 dated 
May 03, 2012 to provide guidelines on the management of procurement, delivery, receipt, 

inspection, acceptance, training, issuance and payment of various equipment under the HFEP. 

 

118. Table XIX shows that various equipment funded under the HFEP with total value of 
₱37,391,241.29 and were undelivered, while a total of ₱296,415,888.00 were unutilized and 

those without calibration and preventive maintenance totaled ₱873,469,437.00.

Non-conduct of Calibration and Preventive Maintenance 

VIII EVRMC 839,482,437.00 1.  The Biomedical Unit is not aware of 
the responsibilities of the suppliers 
regarding preventive maintenance of 
the equipment because they were not 
furnished with copies of the POs and 
warranty certificates.         
2. Suppliers/Manufacturers were not 
required to comply with the terms and 
conditions in the contracts regarding 
corrective preventive maintenance.                           
 3. The Biomed Unit conducted periodic 
check-up of all the medical and 
laboratory equipment of the hospital. 
However, whether or not actually 
undertaken, the check-ups made could 
not be verified because they failed to 
provide the Audit Team with copies of 
the periodic maintenance reports. 

a. The Biomedical Section already coordinated 
with MMD regarding the medical equipment under 
warranty. It was also established during the 
conference that the Biomedical Section will be 
notified regarding the deliveries of new Medical 
Equipment; b. The Biomedical Section has the 
copy of the PO/Contract of some medical 
equipment under warranty. The coordination with 
MMD is ongoing to get all the copies of the 
necessary documents such as PO/Contract, 
Warranty, Certificate, Preventive Maintenance 
and Calibration Schedule of these Medical 
Equipment. The section will also submit a status 
report to HOPSS regularly; and c. MMD 
committed to regularly furnish the EFMD thru the

to Inter-Agency Task Force restrictions 
such as travel restriction and some of 
their engineers reportedly got infected 
with COVID-19, but will comply probably 
this 1st quarter of CY 2021;

3.The Engineering Facility Management 
Section (EFMS) is conducting regular 
preventive maintenance on equipment 
only after the warranty period. 

Due to travel restrictions set by the IATF and 
LGUs requirements, they cannot perform their 
obligation to conduct preventive 
maintenance/calibrations on schedule due to the 
COVID-19 pandemic travel restrictions. But as of 
current year, 2021 the supplier is already 
scheduling their site visit for preventive 
maintenance/calibration because of recent IATF 
and LGUs fewer documentary requirements for 
easier travel. Because of this, the suppliers will be 
able to perform preventive

120. These occurrences manifested poor strategic planning and inadequate monitoring by 
the OUs and runs contrary to the policy of the State that all resources shall be used 

appropriately. Further, the prolonged idleness of these equipment/infrastructure project entail 

risks of diminishing their value and effectiveness due to deterioration while non-performance 

of calibration and preventive maintenance may endanger the equipment to malfunction as well 

as result in unserviceability prior to the life expiration; which likewise may result in additional 

costs for possible major repairs/replacement.  In effect, the main goal of HFEP to improve the 

delivery of basic, essential, as well as specialized health services through the revitalization, 

rationalization, and upgrading of health facilities was not attained.  

 

121. We recommended and the SOH agreed to: 
 

a. require the HFEP Team to: 
 

i. properly plan, assess and evaluate the equipment to be procured in terms 
of availability of space, facilities and immediate needs of the recipient 

hospitals to attain the maximum use of the HFEP equipment;  

 

ii. immediately address the implementation challenges in various 
infrastructure projects and come up with detailed plan on how to address 

the problems encountered; and 

 

iii. closely coordinate with the concerned OUs in planning, monitoring and 
supervision of HFEP projects; 

 



118 

 

b. instruct the heads of OUs to: 
 

i. demand the suppliers to deliver the equipment immediately and in 
accordance with the terms and specifications so that these can be utilized 

by the intended beneficiaries;  

 

ii. ensure readiness of the recipient facilities in receiving the equipment (i.e. 
enough power supply, availability of the space/location, availability and 

trainings of necessary personnel, and availability of turn-over documents) 

during the procurement and before implementation;  

 

iii. ensure that the suppliers regularly conduct calibration and preventive 
maintenance of the equipment; and 

 

c. instruct both the HFEP Team and concerned OUs to facilitate the full 
operation of the newly-built infrastructures and ensure the immediate 

installation of needed equipment, electrical power, and all other needed 

utilities. 
 

Lapses in the management of centrally-procured (procured by DOH Central Office) assets - 

₱65,356,720.70 

 

122. Deficiencies were noted in the distribution of centrally-procured assets to various 
OUs in the total amount of ₱65,356,720.70 and which reflected deficient asset 

distribution systems in the CO. 

 

123. DOH Department Memorandum (DM) No. 2016-0220 dated June 23, 2016 with 
subject: Reiteration of and Compliance to DM No. 2015-0197 dated June 17, 2015 and DM 

No. 2015-0197-A dated July 3, 2016 and Additional COA Recommendation 

on HFEP Implementation provides to direct the DOH Regional HFEP Teams to extend their 

validation and monitoring of equipment up to its proper disclosure in the books of accounts 

and use the Journal Entry Voucher (JEV) drawn by the source agency and end-user to link the 

accounting records. 

 

124. We have sent confirmation letters to various OUs in order to confirm the status of 
deliveries of centrally-procured inventories for distribution, comprising of various equipment, 

supplies and computer software, under the various programs/offices of the CO. 

 

125. Results of said confirmation showed that several inventories in the total amount of 
₱65,356,720.70 were either not received by the concerned OUs, unrecorded in their books of 

accounts, received but with no supporting documents and/or not covered with necessary 

transfer documents.  Details are provided in Table XXI.

126. The deficiencies are caused by lack of procurement planning and proper coordination 
among various offices and between the CO and recipient agencies, which resulted in delayed 

transfers, absence of appropriate transfer and other supporting documents, and unrecorded 

property values both in the books of accounts of the CO and the recipient agencies.   

 

127. We recommended and the SOH agreed to: 
 

a. require concerned offices to establish coordination among themselves to 
ensure that all the equipment and inventories are delivered immediately within 

a reasonable period of time to the intended recipients by closely monitoring 

the status of deliveries of supplies and equipment, facilitate the immediate 

distribution of the items not yet received by the recipients, submit explanation 

on the cause/s for the non- or late delivery thereof to the intended recipients, 

and execute MOAs, deeds of donation or other equivalent documents in the 

transfer of centrally-procured items to ensure clear terms regarding their 

utilization; 

 

b. direct the concerned offices in the CO to provide the pertinent 
documents/records to the recipient facilities to establish property 



121 

 

accountability and custodianship and as basis in recording in the recipient’s 

books of accounts of transferred accountabilities by the CO, and require them 

to record said equipment immediately upon receipt of the equipment and 

documents;  

 

c. instruct the Knowledge Management and Information Technology Service 
(KMITS) to issue policies and procedures to extend validation and monitoring 

of equipment up to the proper recording in the books of accounts, coordinate 

with the Accounting Division of the CO and forward the JEVs made by the 

latter to the end-users/recipients to ensure proper establishment of the 

property custodianship for equipment and computer software distributed by 

CO, and ensure that the actual needs of intended recipients or end-users are 

considered in the allocation list of computer software for distribution to avoid 

idleness and non-utilization; 

 

d. direct concerned offices to submit an action plan as to specific courses of 
action that will be undertaken in order to avoid the deficiencies from 

recurring again, officials/employees responsible and specific timelines 

thereof; and 

 

e. impose appropriate sanctions to officials/employees responsible for the 
deficiencies, in accordance with PD No. 1445, the Administrative Code and 

other applicable laws, rules and regulations. 

 

128. Management commented that in order to effectively monitor the flow of logistics, a 
Logistics Committee was created to coordinate with the SCMS. In an unnumbered 

Memorandum dated December 3, 2020 issued by the Director of HPCS, it was stated that the 

late delivery of the Health Beat Magazines was due to the following reasons: expired contract 

with the official courier, Taal Volcano eruption and the COVID-19 pandemic. 

 

129. Auditor’s rejoinder: 
 

The creation of the Logistics Committee is a welcome development but the importance 

of communication and strong coordination between and among various CO offices 

must be recognized in order to institute mechanisms that will enhance the efficiency 

and effectiveness of delivery of public health services. 

 

The expiration of the courier’s contract is determinable and so proper monitoring and 

planning activities should have been done.  On the other hand, natural calamities such 

as the eruption of Taal Volcano and the pandemic must, on the contrary inspire the 

DOH all the more to exert effort in ensuring on-time deliveries. 

 

Expired, over-stocked, idle, slow-moving and nearly expired inventories - ₱95,151,889.46 

 

130. Drugs, medicines and other types of inventories with a total value of 
₱95,151,889.46 were found to be nearly expired and/or have expired due to deficient 



122 

 

procurement planning, poor distribution and monitoring systems, and identified 

weakness in internal controls.  This recurring problem of the DOH has resulted in 

indiscriminate wastage of government funds and resources, and impedes the attainment 

of DOH’s mission of leading the country in the development of a productive, resilient, 

equitable and people-centered health system. 

 

131. Section 25, General Provisions of RA No. 11465 or the GAA FY 2020 requires that 
the inventory of supplies, materials and equipment spare parts to be procured shall not exceed 

the agency’s two-month requirement. 

 

132. DOH Administrative Order (AO) No. 9-B s. 1996 (Guidelines for Acceptance of 
Drugs and Medicines, Reagents, and Other Medical Supplies Relative to the Expiration Dates) 

provides that expiration dates should not be less than two (2) years from date of manufacture 

and not less than one and a half years (1½) years from the date of delivery.  DOH AO No. 

2019-0058, on the other hand, mandates that the expiration dates of items for consignment 

shall not be less than 12 months from the date of the delivery. 

 

133. In the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Guidelines for Drug Donations, it is 
clearly stated that all donated drugs should have a remaining shelf-life of at least one year. 

 

134. The mission of the DOH is to lead the country in the development of a productive, 
resilient, equitable and people-centered health system. 

 

135. Despite our observations and recommendations in previous years, it was found that 
various drugs, medicines and other types of inventories are nearly-expired or had already 

expired in DOH warehouses and OUs.  Details are presented in Annex VI. 

 

136. The presence of these overstocked, idle and slow-moving inventory items evidences 
excessive spending as the procured items constitute volume far more than what the OUs 

presently need.  As in the past years, the problem is exacerbated by breakdown of the 

inventory/supply management system such as deficient procurement planning, poor 

distribution and monitoring systems, and identified weakness in internal controls.   

 

137. While it cannot be denied that there are a lot of Filipinos in need of drugs and 
medicines, especially in the countryside, millions-worth of DOH inventories were allowed to 

expire, thereby constituting indiscriminate wastage of government funds/resources. 

 

138. Over-all, the problem exposed Management’s inability to safeguard, manage and 
utilize health funds and resources economically and effectively.  Slow-moving drugs and 

medicines are exposed to the risk of losing their efficacy prior to distribution to intended 

beneficiaries.  Idle inventories, meanwhile, takes up expensive warehouse space and ties up 

valuable health resources which could have benefitted government’s health programs for the 

poor. 

 

 

 



123 

 

139. We recommended and the SOH agreed to: 
 

a. take immediate action/concrete steps in resolving all issues associated with the 
recurring problem such as improvement of procurement planning, 

strengthening of distribution and monitoring systems, and review of internal 

controls; and 

 

b. direct the Legal Service and AFMT to conduct thorough investigations and 
impose appropriate sanctions on all erring officials and employees whose 

neglect caused wastage of government funds. 
 

140. Management commented that the Legal Service conducts preliminary investigation 
pursuant to the DOH AO 2015-0048 and the 2017 Revised Rules of Administrative Cases in 

the Civil Service.  For a proper conduct of preliminary investigation, we suggest to refer first 

to IAS for fact-finding investigation to gather relevant documents and identify officials 

responsible. 

 

141. Auditor’s rejoinder: 
 

The SOH is not precluded from directing the IAS or even creating a task force to 

conduct fact-finding investigation which could be used by the Legal Service in 

determining and recommending the appropriate sanctions to be imposed on erring 

officials and employees. 

 

Denied and Return to Hospital (RTH) Claims from the Philippine Health Insurance 

Corporation (PHIC)  

 

142. Claims from the PHIC totaling ₱118,943,357.63 of six (6) OUs were denied by the 
PHIC for various reasons resulting in the loss of hospital income.  Moreover, claims 

totaling ₱8,778,846.00 which were returned to the hospital pose possible additional loss 

of income.   

 

143. RA No. 7875, as amended by RA Nos. 9241 and 10606, otherwise known as the 
National Health Insurance Act (NHIA) of 2013 aims to: (1) provides all citizens of the 

Philippines with the mechanism to gain financial access to health care services; (2) establish 

the Program to serve as the means to help the people pay for health care services; and (3) 

prioritize and accelerate the provision of health services to all Filipinos, especially that 

segment of the populations who cannot afford these services. 

 

144. Section 47e, Rule II, Title IV of the law provides that the PHIC shall penalize health 
care providers for claims attended by any of the circumstances enumerated therein.  Section 

47f further provides that when the claim is denied, its amount shall not be recovered from the 

member. 

  

145. Item IV of PhilHealth Circular No. 2019-001 dated January 10, 2019 defines the 
following: 



124 

 

● Return to Hospital (RTH) claims - deficient claim after due adjudication and 
validation, redirected back to health care institution (HCI) with instructions to 

comply with certain requirements, but from which the action of returning the 

complied claim to PhilHealth may result in the reversal of the deficiency into a good 

claim or non-compliance that may result into the denial of the claim. 

 

● Denied claims - those that have been determined to be invalid and unworthy of 
payment/reimbursement due to an absolute deficiency that cannot be remedied 

through RTH or due to a finding of an unmet requirement. 

 

146. Despite previous years’ audit recommendations, cases of denied and RTH claims 
totaling ₱118,943,357.63 and ₱8,778,846.00, respectively, were still noted in CY 2020 

manifesting persistent failure to address the identified causes/challenges leading to such 

conditions and continuous non-compliance with existing regulations. Details are presented in 

Annex VII.  
 

147. The denied claims meant a loss of income for the OUs considering that under Sections 
47e and 47f of the Revised IRR of the NHIA, it is the health care provider which shall be 

penalized and that the amount of denied claim shall not be recovered from the member.  In 

effect, the OUs lost the amount of ₱118,943,357.63 which could have been used to augment 

their maintenance and other operating expenditures, or for the repair of existing hospital 

facilities.  On the other hand, the RTH claims rendered the hospital as vulnerable to possible 

loss of income. 

 

148. We recommended and the SOH agreed to direct the OUs to: 
 

a. ensure strict compliance with the requirements for PHIC claims as set forth 
under the NHIA and pertinent PHIC rules and guidelines;  

 

b. study and consider possible courses of action towards the recovery of the 
amounts of denied claims; and 

 

c. conduct periodic orientation/reorientation seminar to all personnel involved in 
the documentation and processing of PHIC claims particularly on PHIC 

Circulars and its updates. 
 

Deficiencies in property management - ₱9,566,727,164.08 
 

149. The non-conduct of physical count and other deficiencies in the management of 
PPEs manifested the failure of some OUs to fully observe the prescribed policies and 

procedures promoting accountability and responsibility towards safeguarding 

government assets against loss or wastage.  

 

150. Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume 1, provides policies and procedures that 
will ensure that said assets are properly accounted for and safeguarded against loss or wastage.  

Such policies and procedures include the regular conduct of physical count of PPEs as well as 



125 

 

the preparation and submission of prescribed forms to document the physical count, receipts, 

issuance and disposal of said assets.   

 

151. Our audit, however, revealed deficiencies in the management of PPEs by some OUs 
such as failure to conduct physical inventory, non-observance of pertinent procedures in the 

conduct thereof, non-disposal of unserviceable properties and other deficiencies affecting 

PPEs aggregating at least ₱9,566,727,164.08.  Details are provided in Table XXII.

Failure to renew Motor Vehicle's registration III JBLMGH 4,750,000.00  Sec.5, Article I, Chapter II of RA No. 4136 states that all 
motor vehicles and trailer of any type used or operated on 
or upon any highway of the Philippines must be registered 
with the Bureau of Land Transportation for the current 
year, and that any registration of motor vehicles not 
renewed or before the date fixed by the Bureau of Land 
Transportation shall become delinquent and invalid. 

Vehicles did not carry government plates and 
had no logo/seal or not properly marked  

X APMC  not stated  COA Circular No. 75-6 dated November 7, 1975 and

government motor vehicles shall bear government plates 
only.   

TOTAL   9,566,727,164.08  

 

152. These conditions coupled with the leniency of the CO and OUs in complying with 
pertinent rules have caused doubt on the existence of the said assets and exposes them to loss 

or wastage. There is also evidence that the internal controls established for PPEs are weak and 

that sound policies, guidelines, systems and processes for PPE are lacking.  

 

153. We recommended and the SOH agreed to direct the CO and OUs: 
 

a. to address the gaps noted by improving its internal controls, and strictly 
comply with the pertinent rules, laws and regulations to ensure that PPEs are 

properly accounted and safeguarded; and 

 



127 

 

b. impose administrative sanctions on all erring officials/employees responsible 
for the recurring problems, whenever appropriate. 

 

Other deficiencies in internal control system 

 

154. The observed breakdown/inadequacy of internal control systems of some DOH 
OUs has exposed governmental funds, properties and other resources to risks of 

malversation, theft, wastage, obsolescence and loss of government funds. 

 

155. COA rules and regulations and Internal control policies dictate that the agency should 
adopt internal control over the safeguarding of assets against unauthorized acquisition, use or 

disposition.  These should be effected by the Head of the Agency, Inventory Committee, and 

employees designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection 

of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the entity’s assets that could have a material 

effect on the financial statements. Measures to ensure the prevention and early detection of 

loss of assets are best exercised among others through proper asset tagging and physical 

inventory-taking. The Property & Supply Management System Manual (PSMSM) embodies 

the specified COA rules and regulations. 

 

156. The following deficiencies were also observed in some OUs which indicate the lack 
of sound internal control system: 

 
Table XXIII. Deficiencies in internal control  

Region OU  Deficiencies 

CAR FNLGH Collections were not deposited intact because part of the collections of the hospital was sometimes used 
to cover up dietary expenses while replenishment of the dietary’s petty cash fund is on process; 
sometimes used for emergency purchases other than dietary expenses; and the wages of various laborers 
were sometimes disbursed out of collections pending the issuance/encashment of their checks by the 
Cashier.  

I ITRMC The Financial Management Officer (FMO) was designated as one of the signatories of checks issued 
which could make an impression that the concerned official has control over the accounting and cash 
divisions of the agency. Evidently, there is no segregation of duties contrary to existing internal control 
standards.  Also, as the FMO is designated as one of the signatories of all checks issued while being the 
head of accounting and cashiering divisions, the Agency pays Fidelity Bond to cover the official’s 
accountability. As it is, the payments made on the Fidelity Bond could be considered as 
unauthorized/unnecessary in accordance with COA Circular 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012.   

I ITRMC 277 prepared checks for issuance from the period October 2019 to September 2020 were cancelled due 
to various errors which included typographical errors, misspelled names of payees, incorrect entries on 
the face of the checks, among others. This resulted not only in the incurrence of unnecessary expenses 
pertaining to the cost of the cancelled check but also showed inefficiency of the concerned employee in 
performing the job assigned. In the parlance of good internal control, this is a non-compliance with existing 
standards pertaining thereto. 

III BGHMC The Agency has 11 designated warehouses that were located remotely to each other.  All of the 
warehouses did not contain any labels or signages. One of the most important aspects of proper 
warehouse management is the implementation of warehouse labels and signs because without them, 
finding inventories and managing issuances and receiving in-bound deliveries will be much more 
disorganized and challenging for the Agency. It also increases the risk of damage to property since 
hazards are not clearly labelled and identified. Overflowing of stocks were also visible during the 
inspection of hospital auditors; boxes and packs of supplies were not properly placed on the shelves, 
while some inventories were stored not within the warehouse but in the hallways. Moreover, some of the 
warehouses were not properly ventilated and lighted.

Region OU  Deficiencies 

IV-B ONP Significant inventory supplies of I.V. fluids and garbage bags were stacked in the alley and staircase of 
the Communicable Building, with some I.V. fluid boxes already opened. It was also observed that the 
areas are unsecured as the entry points to the building were left open even after office hours and there is 
no CCTV installed in the building premises.  

VII DEVMH The disbursing officer requested a stoppage of payment for the check lost by the payee amounting to 
₱122,839.23. There was negligence in issuing a replacement check without requesting a stoppage of 

payment for the lost check. It would seem like there was a double payment for the said transaction since 
there were two checks issued. The accountant should have verified first the validity of the claim of the 
payee and requested a stoppage of payment for the lost check before processing the request for a 
replacement check. 

VII GCGMH Inspection and Acceptance Report (IAR) and Property Acknowledgment Receipt (PAR) attached to 
disbursement vouchers have incomplete information. 

 

157. The failure to install a sound internal control system runs contrary to the directive to 
safeguard and promote accountability and responsibility for government assets and 

unnecessarily exposes them to possible risks of loss or misuse. 

 

158. We recommended and the SOH agreed to direct the OUs, in writing, to institute, 
continually enhance and conduct regular evaluation of internal control systems strictly 

in accordance with the Property and Supply Management System Manual (PSMSM), 

Annex A and B of DOH Administrative Order No. 2013-0027 dated October 2, 2013, 

with respect to management of personnel, premises, warehousing, storage, and 

distribution of pharmaceuticals products, Government Accounting Manual with respect 

to the documentation of hospital transactions and COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated 

October 29, 2012 for the rules on Fidelity Bond. 

 

Unutilized funds at year-end 

 

159. Considerable amounts of unobligated allotments totaling ₱24,641,119,764.42 as 
of December 31, 2020, aimed at strengthening the Department’s capacity to ensuring 

access to basic public health services to all Filipinos and further buttressing the health 

care delivery system, were noted.  This condition affects the efficient utilization of public 

funds vis-à-vis the agency’s implementation capabilities and its response to the urgent 

healthcare needs during the time of state of calamity/national emergency. 

 

160. Section 70 of the General Provisions of RA No. 11465 or the GAA of FY 2020 states 
that “as a general rule, departments, bureaus and offices of the National Government xxx shall 

spend what is programmed in their respective appropriations xxx”. This provision is 

mentioned and repeated in similar terms in Section 3.10 of the DBM NBC No. 578 dated 

January 6, 2020 or the Guidelines on the Release of Funds for FY 2020. 

 

161. On March 8, 2020, the President issued Proclamation No. 922 and declared a state of 
public health emergency throughout the country.  This was followed by Proclamation No. 929 

which declared a state of calamity throughout the Philippines due to COVID-19 and 

Proclamation No. 1021 which extended the period of state of calamity throughout the country 

due to said virus disease.  All these presidential issuances provided that all government 

agencies and LGUs are enjoined to continue rendering full assistance to and cooperation with 

each other and mobilize the necessary resources to undertake critical, urgent, and appropriate 



129 

 

disaster response aid and measures in a timely manner to curtail and eliminate the threat of 

COVID-19. 

 

162. Section 2 of RA No. 11469 declared a state of national emergency in the entire country.  
Section 3 thereof stresses the urgent need to, among others, mitigate if not contain the 

transmission of COVID-19; undertake measures that will prevent the overburdening of the 

healthcare system; immediately and amply provide healthcare, including medical tests and 

treatments to COVID-19 patients, Persons Under Investigation (PUIs), or Persons Under 

Monitoring (PUMs); ensure that there is sufficient, adequate and readily available funding to 

undertake the foregoing; and promote the collective interests of all Filipinos in these 

challenging times. 

 

163. In Section 4 of the law, the President was authorized to exercise powers that are 
necessary and proper to carry out the declared national policy.  One of these powers is to 

reprogram, reallocate, and realign from savings on other items of appropriations in the FY 

2020 GAA in the Executive Department, as may be necessary and beneficial to fund measures 

that address and respond to COVID-19 emergency.  Accordingly, all amounts so 

reprogrammed, reallocated or realigned shall be deemed automatically appropriated for such 

measures to address the COVID-19 situation within the period specified. 

 

164. Moreover, RA No. 11494 affirmed the existence of continuing national emergency.  
The provision of adequate social services was emphasized as part of the policy of the State.  

The President was once again authorized to realign and reprogram funds from PAPs which 

cannot be utilized effectively as a result of COVID-19 outbreak. 

 

165. Section 2.1.1 of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA No. 11494 
states that release of funds to the implementing agency shall be based on implementation-

ready work programs and supporting budget documentary requirements. 

 

166. Records show the following allotments, obligation of funds, disbursements and 
balances of the DOH as of December 31, 2020:

167. Based on the foregoing data, the over-all Allotment Utilization Index (AUI) is 0.8773, 
computed by dividing the ₱176,214,328,738.98 or the total amount obligated during the year 

by ₱200,855,448,503.40 or the total amount of allotments.   

 

168. It is important to state that the index measures the extent to which the agency has 
utilized the allotments that are actually made available by the DBM.  Thus, the AUI is 

primarily affected by the agency’s implementation capabilities. 

 

169. On the other hand, it appears that on the basis of the above-presented figures in Table 
XVI sourced from the official records of the DOH, the rate of disbursement over allotments 

and obligations are 70.56 percent and 80.42 percent, respectively.   

 

170. While the computed AUIs and disbursement rates are relatively high, the unobligated 
allotments and unpaid obligations totaling ₱24,641,119,764.42 and ₱34,483,710,711.50, 

respectively, as of December 31, 2020 are considered as very material and are more than 

enough to affect the level of efficiency put into managing the COVID-19 funds vis-à-vis the 

agency’s implementation capabilities and its response to the urgent healthcare needs during 

the time of state of calamity/national emergency.  Based on our assessment, this condition is 

caused by challenges encountered in the procurement processes, the belated downloading of 

funds to the Centers for Health Development (CHDs) and other operating units and volume 

of transactions handled by procurement and implementing partners.   

 

171. According to the Accounting Division, the additional Notices of Cash Allocations 
(NCAs) for Special Allotment Release Orders (SAROs) specifically for COVID-19 Response 

issued by the DBM were not fully utilized because big ticket commodities such as medical 

equipment and various improvement of facilities have to be delivered and completed first 

before payment.  Thus, NCAs in the DOH-CO amounting to ₱9,117,786,369.44 lapsed and 

was reverted back to the BTr.   

 

172. It was further explained that the processing of the DVs is not within the exclusive 
control of the Accounting Division, considering that the completion of the supporting 

documentary requirements is the responsibility of the end-user or to the program implementer. 

Accordingly, the DVs of all the suppliers/contractors with valid claims are immediately 

processed by the Accounting Division. It was also justified that the testing positive with 

COVID-19 of some employees as well as the imposition of lockdowns impeded the more 

efficient processing of transactions and may be considered as one factor as to why there was 

low fund utilization in the DOH. 

 



131 

 

173. The billions of pesos in the coffers of the DOH that have remained not obligated and 
disbursed as at year-end and funds that were reverted back to the national treasury are counter-

beneficial to the Department’s continuing efforts towards ensuring access to basic public 

health services to all Filipinos, further buttressing the health care delivery system, and most 

importantly controlling the spread of COVID-19 through provision of quality health services.  

It can, thus, be said that these funds that remained idle as at year-end were not translated to 

much-needed health supplies, equipment and services that could have benefitted both the 

health workers and the general public during the critical times of the pandemic.  These 

billions-worth of public funds could have saved many lives if only these were translated into 

meaningful PAPs during the state of calamity/national emergency. 

 

174. While RA No. 11520 amended Section 60 of the General Provisions of RA No. 11465 
by extending the availability of the FY 2020 appropriations up to December 31, 2021, with 

the DOH’s current rate of fund utilization, it becomes doubtful if it will be able to fully utilize 

its remaining unutilized CY 2020 allotments considering that new appropriations totaling 

₱134,453,462,000.00 were again provided to the DOH under RA No. 11518 which also need 

to be utilized by the end of CY 2021.   

 

175. We recommended and the SOH agreed  to: 
 

a. facilitate the completion of PAPs within the periods provided under existing 
laws and regulations in order to fully utilize and improve the Department’s 

spending rate in terms of disbursement of allotments received and avoid any 

adverse effect on future budget levels of the agency; 

 

b. immediately address the perennial factors impeding project implementation 
through a written plan,  such as bidding process and contractor selection and 

performance monitoring, improvements in preliminary and detailed 

engineering, project monitoring and evaluation system, conduct of early 

procurement activities as sanctioned by law and guidelines, more efficient 

system of downloading funds to the CHDs and other operating units, 

partnerships and coordination with the DOH on project/program 

implementation as well as organizational strengthening  especially with 

respect to project management offices with the end view of rationalizing or 

standardizing their sizes either in terms of number, components or total costs 

of projects/programs handled; 

 

c. coordinate with the various operating units, procurement partners, and 
implementing agencies, in the form of written communications and series of 

meetings (with copies/minutes furnished to the COA Office), on the following 

matters: 

 

i. possible reforms that will improve budget determination and 
programming,  

 



132 

 

ii. linkage between fiscal framework and budget preparation so that funds 
will be available for use by the operating units, procurement partners, 

and/or implementing agencies, and released on time, 

 

iii. need to institutionalize monitoring of fund utilization and the use of 
information derived from DBM’s system of annual agency budget review, 

and 

 

iv. greater flexibility in the provision of technical assistance in project 
preparation/planning, design and management, installation of incentive 

systems in project management offices for early or on schedule 

completion of projects and sanctions for delays if delays are caused by 

inefficiencies. 

 

Low obligation of DRRM Funds in time of state of calamity/national emergency 

 

176. The non-obligation of some ₱306,734,289.77 worth of public funds allotted for 
Disaster Risk Reduction and Management (DRRM) and during the state of 

calamity/national emergency in CY 2020 demonstrates that not enough programs and 

projects were implemented in order to mitigate related risks and alleviate the people’s 

condition faster to recovery. 
 

177. The responsibility of delivering health care and services was transferred by RA No. 
7160 or the 1991 Local Government Code, as amended, from the DOH to the LGUs.  One of 

the functions that remained with the DOH, however, is disaster management focused on 

preparedness and prevention. The LGUs have the primary responsibility of providing 

immediate and direct response to disasters, but in cases where disasters have 

reached proportions beyond the capability of the LGUs, the national government takes control 

as stipulated under Section 1051 of the law. 

 

178. Over the past two decades, the DOH has come up with salient policies and guidelines 
that further defined its roles and functions in disaster response management in addition to the 

laws and executive orders that were passed over the same period. 

 

179. In Section 22 (e) of RA No. 10121, it is provided that all departments, bureaus, offices 
and agencies of the government are authorized to use a portion of their appropriations to 

implement projects designed to address DRRM activities in accordance with the guidelines to 

be issued by the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) in 

coordination with the DBM.  This was reiterated in Section 5, Rule 19 of the law’s IRR. 

180. Section 36, General Provisions of RA No. 11465 (GAA FY 2020) mandates that all 
agencies of the government shall plan and implement programs and projects, taking into 

consideration measures for climate change adaptation and mitigation, and disaster risk 

reduction, based on climate and disaster risk assessments. 

                                                           
1 In the event of ‘epidemic, pestilence and other widespread public dangers’, the Secretary of the Department of Health may, 

upon the direction of the President and in consultation with the government unit concerned, temporarily assume direct 
supervision and control over health operations in any LGU for the duration of the emergency. 



133 

 

 

181. Section 2.1.1 of the IRR of RA No. 11494 states that release of funds to the 
implementing agency shall be based on implementation-ready work programs and supporting 

budget documentary requirements. 

 

182. The three (3) main components of the DOH’s DRRM Fund are the following: (1) 
Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Fund (HEPR); (2) Quick Response Fund 

(QRF); and (3) Calamity Fund.  These funds support the implementation of various Programs, 

Activities, and Projects (PAPs) under the Health Emergency Management Program (HEMP) 

of the Department. 

 

183. Based on official records, the DOH was appropriated2 with ₱308,897,654.58 and 
₱1,392,069,000.00 worth of public funds for its HEMP in CYs 2019 and 2020, respectively.  

The same amounts were released to the DOH in the form of allotments.  

 

184. In CY 2020 when the country was ravaged by the COVID-19 pandemic, only 
₱236,745,340.59, ₱719,877,500.64 and ₱437,609,523.58 or 84.71 percent, 86.98 percent and 

76.39 percent of the HEPR, QRF and Calamity Fund allotments were obligated, respectively. 

Table XXV shows the details of the appropriation, allotments received, obligations and 

disbursements (both for the Current Year and Continuing Appropriations or CONAP) 

concerning said funds.

185. Allotment for HEPR was obligated and disbursed by the CO and various DOH CHDs 
and other OUs for the implementation of HEMP, specifically the (1) procurement of various 

drugs and medicines, medical supplies, laboratory expenses; and (2) cover hospital bills, 

response operations and other logistical augmentation to the affected populations. 

Corresponding guidelines on the sub-allotment and utilization of these funds were issued. 

 

186. On the other hand, the amount of ₱600,000,000.00 appropriated in the GAA of FY 
2020, serves as a standby fund to be used for rehabilitation and repair of health facilities, 

replacement of medical equipment, as well as provisions for emergency medical assistance, 

including pre-positioning of medical aids and personal hygiene kits.  These are intended at 

improving the situation and living conditions of people in communities or areas stricken by 

calamities, epidemics, crises and catastrophes which occurred in the last quarter of the 

immediately preceding year and those occurring during the year, so that they may be 

normalized as quickly as possible. 

 

187. While the computed AUIs and disbursement rates are relatively high, the unobligated 
funds totaling ₱306,734,289.77 (Current and CONAP) as of December 31, 2020 are 

considered very material, enough to affect the level of efficiency put into managing the DRRM 

funds vis-à-vis the agency’s implementation capabilities and its response to the urgent 

healthcare needs during the time of state of calamity/national emergency.  The condition 

demonstrates that not enough programs and projects were implemented during the year in 

order to mitigate related risks and alleviate the people’s condition faster to recovery.  It 

likewise manifests that there was no efficient use of fiscal resources despite hefty fund 

appropriations/allocations and that program implementation was not maximized during the 

state of calamity/national emergency, a time when an effective health delivery system is most 

needed by the people. 

 

188. For a pandemic-stricken country with prevailing risks and delicate vulnerabilities, the 
DOH’s DRRM funds were underutilized and not all scheduled programs were implemented. 



135 

 

 

189. The HEMB Administrative Officer of HEMB explained that the COVID-19 pandemic 
led to the slow mobilization of DOH personnel and processing of documents, while some of 

the activities indicated on their WFP were not continued. There was likewise failed/cancelled 

HEMB procurement activities. It was stressed that the DRRM funds were obligated and 

disbursed by the CO and OUs who received the funds through SAA, hence, the utilization of 

SAAs is beyond the control of the DOH-CO because the responsibilities are already lodged 

to the recipients.   

 

190. It was noted in the audit that funds released through SARO No. BMB-20-0020677 
dated November 27, 2020 amounting to ₱62,000,000.00 and intended to cover the site 

development and landscaping for the construction of the Marawi City General Hospital in 

Marawi City were not obligated in CY 2020. 

 

191. Based on the auditors’ verification, the identified reasons for low utilization of funds 
released under SARO No. BMB-20-0002174  (Calamity Fund) by the OUs are as follows: (1) 

lapses in the conduct of procurement activities; (2) absence of trainings conducted face to 

face, all is done virtually; (3) prevailing travel restrictions; (4) no takers; (5) complicated and 

hazardous work; (6) low compensation and high standard qualifications; (7) low hiring for 

COVID-19 related personnel; and (8) late receipt of SAA and voluminous claims that Human 

Resource (HR) Units have difficulty in preparing the payroll. 

 

192. It was further justified by Management that the DRRM funds were not solely utilized 
by the HEMB. The other programs/bureaus may charge their expenditures to the QRF and 

Calamity Fund, provided that such expenditures are for the use of rehabilitation and repair of 

health facilities, replacement of medical equipment, as well as provisions for emergency 

medical assistance, including pre-positioning of medical aids and personal hygiene kits. 

 

193. On the contrary, we are of the view that the presence of the COVID-19 pandemic must 
inspire the DOH to do more and cause the overspending of the DRRM funds because these 

are specifically appropriated for the purpose and health services currently play a vital role in 

saving the lives of Filipinos.  Mechanisms and systems are available in order to avoid or at 

least, minimize the other identified reasons for non-utilization of budget.  There is only one 

DOH under the SOH and proper coordination between and among its programs and bureaus 

is imperative to ensure efficient delivery of needed health services. 

 

194. A source agency which transferred funds to an implementing agency retains and is not 
divested of responsibility over such funds. In Section 5.4 of COA Circular No. 94-013 dated 

December 13, 1994, the source agency has the duty and responsibility to require the 

implementing agency to submit the reports and furnish the latter with a copy of the journal 

voucher taking up the expenditures.   

 

195. We recommended and the SOH agreed to: 
 

a. facilitate the completion of PAPs within the periods provided under RA No. 
11520, Section 3.4 of DBM National Budget Circular (NBC) No. 585 and 



136 

 

related laws and regulations in order to fully utilize and improve the DOH’s 

spending rate in terms of disbursement of allotments received and avoid any 

adverse effect on future budget levels of the agency; 

 

b. immediately address the perennial factors impeding project implementation 
through a written plan; 

 

c. Coordinate with the various operating units, procurement partners, and 
implementing agencies, in the form of written communications and series of 

meetings (with copies/minutes furnished to the COA Office), on the 

downloading of funds, PAPs implementation and preparation/submission of 

the FURs and other required reports; 

 

d. Direct the HEMB to monitor the movement and balances of the DRRM 
commodities and current allotment, obligation and disbursements which 

may be used in making informed decisions for the formulation of reasonable 

WFP and PPMP. 

 

Low utilization/allocation of hospital income 

 

196. The utilization of at least 25 percent allocated hospital income of four OUs 
totaling ₱169,578,991.42 for the procurement of equipment and upgrading of hospital 

facilities had not been fully maximized, with only 37.43 percent or ₱63,467,670.77 

utilized, while one OU had allocated only ₱4,102,375.65 or 3.54 percent of its hospital 

income of ₱116,037,875.84, thus, denying the intended beneficiaries of quality health 

care services that could have been provided to them had the required percentage of said 

income been properly allocated, and plans for the efficient utilization thereof were 

formulated and implemented. 

 

197. Special Provision No. 2 of the Appropriations of the DOH Office of the Secretary of 
RA No. 11465 (GAA FY 2020), partly provides that at least 25 percent of hospital and other 

facilities income shall be utilized to purchase and upgrade hospital equipment used directly in 

the delivery of health services.  

 

198. In Section 3.5 of DOH-DOF-DBM Circular No. 2003-01 dated July 16, 2003, the use 
of hospital income is authorized to augment the requirement of the hospitals for maintenance 

and other operating expenditures, including repair and maintenance of existing hospital 

facilities provided that at least 25 percent of said income shall be used to purchase and upgrade 

hospital equipment used directly in the delivery of health services and that it shall not be used 

for salaries and other allowances and benefits whether in cash or in kind.    

 

199. It was noted that in five (5) OUs, the utilization of hospital income totaling 
₱169,578,991.42 was not fully maximized, with only 37.43 percent or ₱63,467,670.77 utilized 

for the procurement of hospital equipment and upgrading of existing facilities, leaving an 

unutilized balance of ₱106,111,320.65, as shown in Table XXVI.

*Beginning balance of hospital income with authority to use for MMMHMC 

 

200. The non-/under-utilization of hospital income of these OUs was attributed to: (a) 
receipt of separate funds from LGUs and DOH-CO despite the availability of allocated 

hospital income; (b) the projected budget was not achieved since the hospital did not generate 

much cash to support the plans for the year; and (c) inadequacies and inability of OUs in 

setting up plans and targets in the use of hospital income, and majority of procurements were 

obligated only towards the end of the year. 

 

201. Moreover, it was found that SLRGH had allocated only ₱4,102,375.65 or 3.54 percent 
of its hospital income of ₱116,037,875.84, for equipment/upgrading of facilities, 

notwithstanding that its income covered with “authority to use” amounted to ₱29,009,468.96. 

Evidently, the low allocation of hospital income was due to the failure of the hospital to 

allocate additional funds in accordance with the guidelines set in DOH-DOF-DBM Circular 

No. 2003-01. 

 

202. The non-maximization of allocation and utilization of hospital income denied the 
intended beneficiaries of quality health services that could have been provided to them had 

the required percentage of said income been allocated, and plans for the efficient utilization 

thereof were formulated and implemented by the concerned OUs. 

 

203. We recommended and the SOH agreed to direct the heads of concerned OUs to: 
 

a. plan carefully through proper and complete identification of all 
equipment/facilities needed by the hospitals to deliver quality health care 

services to intended patients and prioritize the utilization of the allocated 

hospital income; 

 

b. require the submission of explanation/justification on the deficiencies noted, 
evaluate the same and impose appropriate sanctions to concerned 

officials/employees; and 

 



138 

 

c. henceforth, ensure that at least 25 percent of the hospital income is allocated 
for the procurement of necessary equipment and upgrading of hospital 

facilities to provide the intended patients with access to better health care 

services. 

 

Other Governance-related issues 

 

204. Seven OUs failed to comply with the requirements of existing laws, rules and 
regulations related to unpaid obligations, utilization of MAIP funds,  delegation of 

functions to JO personnel, proper maintenance of official website,  maintenance of bank 

accounts, and improper transfer of funds to a private organization due to laxity in 

controls and absence of organizational review of existing agency practices/processes, 

thus affecting the regularity of related transactions and exposing resources to the risk of 

wastage and misuse. 

 

205. Other governance-related deficiencies were also noted in some OUs such as long-
outstanding unpaid obligations, assigning the functions of monitoring and technical 

inspections and evaluation of infrastructure to Job Order (JO) personnel, and unauthorized 

transfer of funds to a private organization, as detailed in Annex VIII.   

 

206. The noted gaps are indicative of the OUs’ laxity in controls and absence of 
organizational review of existing agency practices/processes.  All these adversely affected the 

regularity of related transactions and exposed resources to the risk of wastage and misuse. 

 

207. We recommended and the SOH, through the AFMT, agreed to direct in writing 
all concerned OUs to:  

 

a. strictly comply with existing laws, rules and regulations; and 
 

b. impose administrative sanctions on erring officials/employees in accordance 
with PD No. 1445, Administrative Code of the Philippines and other applicable 

laws. 

 

Unauthorized/idle cash and non-remittance of collections to the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) 

 

208. Unauthorized and unnecessary balances in depository accounts as well as fees 
and other receipts or revenues collected totaling ₱441,239,379.94 remained unremitted 

to the National Treasury contrary to law and regulations. 

 

209. Section 4 of the General Provisions of GAA of FY 2020 provides that, as a general 
rule, all fees, charges, assessments, and other receipts or revenues collected by departments, 

bureaus and offices of the National Government, including Constitutional Offices enjoying 

fiscal autonomy in the exercise of their mandated functions, as such rates as are now or may 

be approved by the appropriate approving authority shall be deposited with the National 

Treasury as income of the General Fund. 

 



139 

 

210. Section 10 thereof requires departments, bureaus, offices, and instrumentalities of the 
National Government to close and revert all balances of Special Accounts, Fiduciary or Trust 

Funds, and Revolving Funds to the General Fund in any of the following instances: (i) when 

there is no legal basis for its creation; (ii) when their terms have expired; or (iii) when they 

are no longer necessary for the attainment of the purposes for which said funds were 

established. 
 

211. Paragraph 2.1 of the DOF-DBM-COA Permanent Committee Joint Circular No. 4-
2012 dated 11 September 2012 states that, unless otherwise specifically provided by law, all 

income collected by agencies of the government by virtue of the provisions of law, orders and 

regulations shall be deposited in the National Treasury, and shall accrue to the unappropriated 

surplus of the General Fund of the Government. 

 

212. Item 3 thereof defines unauthorized accounts as cash account balances maintained by 
agencies without specific authority or legal basis, while unnecessary special and trust funds 

refer to authorized special and trust funds maintained by government agencies with authorized 

government depository banks (AGDBs) but which are no longer necessary for the attainment 

of the purposes for which said funds were established, i.e., specific projects/programs, the 

implementation of which have been completed or abandoned. 
 

213. Item 5.5.1 thereof further requires the immediate transfer to the National Treasury of 
the cash balances of the unauthorized accounts. 

 

214. COA Circular No. 2015-001 dated January 29, 2015 prescribes the guidelines and 
procedures in the reversion to the General Fund of all dormant cash, unauthorized accounts, 

unnecessary special and trust funds and related accounts, in conformity with the Permanent 

Committee Joint Circular No. 4-2012 dated September 11, 2012 implementing EO No. 431 

dated May 30, 2005.  Section 3 thereof provides the procedural guidelines to be undertaken 

by NGAs with dormant cash/unauthorized accounts and unnecessary special and trust funds 

including recipients of inter-agency fund transfers, starting from the thorough analysis of the 

cash accounts, providing cash account mapping and/or grouping the cash accounts up to the 

disposition of the said accounts/funds. 

 

215. We observed that seven OUs, as shown in Table XXVII, continuously maintained the 
following balances totaling ₱441,239,379.94 in their depository banks contrary to the above-

cited law and regulations.  These are recorded in the OUs’ books under the account Cash in 

Bank – Local Currency, Current Account.

0755-002847-030 and 0755-002847-032 with balances 
amounting to ₱56,745.93 and ₱26,958.91, respectively, 
which had been dormant for more than three years were 
not closed. The Accountant sent a letter-request to DBP 
dated November 8, 2019 for the closure of the dormant 
accounts and the issuance of the Manager’s Check for the 
remaining cash balance. However, as of date, for 
unknown reasons, the bank had not acted on the request. 
No further information was provided by the Management, 
when necessary follow-ups were made to the bank. 

Fees, and other 
receipts or revenues 
collected not remitted 
in BTr 

NCR  FDA 432,509,658.11 Collections of fees under the SAGF and excess proceeds 
from seminars and trainings amounting to 
₱408,361,714.99 and ₱24,147,943.12, respectively, 
which accumulated for several years were not remitted to 
the BTr as at year-end.  

III MMWGH 679,313.07 Collections from the sale of bid documents and forfeited 
performance security bond were not reverted to the BTr 

Bataan GHMC 1,442,053.25 Collections from the sale of bid documents and forfeited 
performance security bond i were not reverted to the BTr 

IV-B CSGH 372,500.25 Unutilized collections from the sale of bidding documents 
were not remitted to the BTr 

VI TRC Pototan 161,965.23 Collections of non-hospital income in the aggregate 
amount of ₱2,800.00 remained in the ADGB and excess 
of the proceeds from the sale of bid documents amounting 
to ₱159,165.23 at the end of the year, after the payment 
of honoraria to BAC members, were not deposited with 
the BTr 

XIII CHD 44,500.00 Collections derived from the sale of unserviceable assets 
were deposited at the Land bank of the Philippines 
Current Account as Trust Fund which should have been 
remitted in the National Treasury as income to the 
General Fund. 

IX MRH   183,555.41  Interest income not remitted to the BTr 

Total   441,239,379.94  

 

216. The failure to remit to the National Treasury the aforementioned cash balances 
deprived the National Government of the use of idle cash deposited in AGDB for other priority 

projects and defeated the purpose of the Government of maximizing the use of its financial 

resources. 

 
217. It is worth noting that the FDA already remitted the accumulated balance of its 
collected fees to the BTr totaling ₱432,509,658.11 and these were recorded under JEV Nos. 

21-02-340 to 345 and JEV No. 21-01-55 dated January to February 2021.  The FDA 

Management informed that, henceforth, remittance of collected fees will be done on a 

quarterly basis. 

 

218. We recommended and the SOH agreed to direct the concerned OUs to cause the 
immediate transfer/remittance of their unauthorized/unnecessary cash balances and 

collected fees to the BTr in compliance with law and regulations.

Non-compliance with rules and regulations on cash advances - ₱230,844,376.47 

 

219. Policies in the grant, utilization and liquidation of cash advances were not fully 
complied due to the lenient implementation and laxity in monitoring, thereby, exposing 

government funds to risks of loss and misuse. 

 

220. Section 89 of PD No. 1445 provides that a cash advance shall be reported on and 
liquidated as soon as the purpose for which it was given has been served3.  Section 107 of the 

law, on the other hand, mandates that all accountable officers shall render their accounts, 

submit their vouchers, and make deposits of money collected or held by them at such times 

and in such manner as shall be prescribed in the regulations of the Commission. 

 

221. COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 provides the rules and regulations 
on the granting, utilization and liquidation of cash advances including the reglementary 

periods within which the different types of cash advances are to be liquidated or reported on. 

 

222. In the review of operations of the CO and various OUs, deficiencies were noted 
relative to the management of cash advances aggregating ₱ 230,844,376.47, more notable of 

which are the existence of unliquidated and dormant cash advances and cases of delayed 

liquidation.  Details are provided in Annex IX. 

 

223. The presence of said deficiencies is a result of weak financial controls, absence of 
policy enforcement and laxity of monitoring by the Accountants of the liquidation by officers 

and employees, and exposes government funds to risks of loss and misuse. 

 

224. We recommended and the SOH agreed to: 
 

a. direct the CO and OUs, through the AFMT, to immediately settle all 
deficiencies found in cash advances within three (3) months after receipt of this 

Report;  

 

b. enjoin all OUs to henceforth, strictly comply with all pertinent laws, rules and 
regulations in the handling of cash advances and liquidation thereof through 

the issuance/restatement of internal guidelines and strict monitoring; and 

 

c. impose appropriate sanctions on erring officials/employees whenever 
warranted. 

 

Failure to observe policies in the handling of Petty Cash Fund (PCF) - ₱9,332,504.77 

 

225. The non-compliance of existing rules and regulations in the management of PCFs 
exposed government resources to risks of fund misuse. 

 

                                                           
3 Reiterated in Sec. 14 (b) of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, page 74 



142 

 

226. COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 and Sections 35 and 36, Chapter 6 
of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, provide the policies in the grant, utilization and 

replenishment of PCFs. 

 

227. Our audit found that these policies were not fully complied with by the OUs in the 
management of PCFs aggregating at least ₱9,332,504.77.  Among the deficiencies noted were 

the excessiveness or insufficiency of the amount granted as PCF, issues in replenishment and 

irregular charges to PCF.  Details of the deficiencies noted are presented in Annex X. 

 

228. The continuous failure of the OUs to conform their practices and transactions with 
existing rules exposed government resources to risks of fund misuse.   

 

229. We recommended and the SOH agreed to: 

 

a. direct the OUs, through the AFMT, to immediately settle all deficiencies 
found in PCFs within three (3) months after receipt of this Report; 

 

b. enjoin all OUs to, henceforth, strictly comply with all pertinent laws, rules 
and regulations in the management of PCFs through the issuance/restatement 

of internal guidelines; and 

 

c. impose appropriate sanctions on erring officials/employees whenever 
warranted. 

 

Deficiencies noted in procurement process and implementation of contracts - 

₱3,967,249,291.33 

 

230. Procedural deficiencies in the procurement process and lack of documentation in 
various contracts entered into and implemented by the DOH as well as lapses in 

implementation of its various projects in the aggregate amount of at least 

₱3,967,249,291.33, were not in keeping with pertinent provisions of RA No. 9184 and its 

RIRR, thus, deprived the government of the most advantageous prices and resulted in 

doubtful payment transactions and significant delays in project completion. 

 

231. RA No. 9184, its RIRR and related issuances apply to the procurement of 
infrastructure projects, goods and consulting services, regardless of source of funds, whether 

local of foreign, by all branches and instrumentalities of government, its departments, offices 

and agencies, including GOCCs and LGUs.  

 

232. Section 2, Rule I of the 2016 RIRR of RA No. 9184 provides that the provisions therein 
are in line with the commitment of the Government of the Philippines (GoP) to promote good 

governance and its effort to adhere to the principles of transparency, accountability, equity, 

efficiency, and economy in its procurement process. It is the policy of the GoP that 

procurement of goods, infrastructure projects and consulting services shall be competitive and 

transparent, and therefore shall undergo competitive bidding, except as may be provided by 

law. 



143 

 

 

233. Consistent thereto, the Supreme Court in the case of Philippine Sports Commission, et 
al. v. Dear John Services, Inc., G.R. No. 183260 dated 04 July 2012, held that the law on 

public bidding is not an empty formality. A strict adherence to the principles, rules and 

regulations on public bidding must be sustained if only to preserve the integrity and the faith 

of the general public on the procedure. 

 

234. In the procurement of goods, consultancy services, and infrastructure projects by the 
CO and various OUs totaling ₱3,967,249,291.33, the provisions of R.A. No. 9184, its RIRR 

and related issuances were not strictly complied with as several procedural deficiencies in the 

procurement process and lack of documentation as well as lapses in implementation of various 

projects were observed.  Specific deficiencies with corresponding amounts are shown in Table 

XXVIII.

236. The noted deficiencies were not only contrary to the pertinent provisions of RA No. 
9184 and its RIRR but also deprived the government of the most advantageous prices in the 

procurement of goods, consultancy services, and infrastructure projects and resulted in 

doubtful payment transactions and significant delays in project completion. 

 

237. We recommended and the SOH agreed to direct the CO and OUs to: 
 

a. henceforth, strictly comply with the requirements of RA No. 9184 and 
pertinent laws, rules and regulations, particularly on the conduct of public 

bidding and other procurement activities and on the preparation and 

submission of required documents; 

 

b. submit explanation/justification on the various deficiencies noted, evaluate the 
same and take appropriate actions; 

 

c. conduct periodic assessment of processes and procedures to streamline 
procurement activities pursuant to Section 3(c) of this 2016 Revised IRR; and  

 

d. consider the imposition of proper liquidated damages on delayed delivery 
and/or completion of procured goods, services and infrastructure projects to 

encourage faithful adherence and timely execution of contracts. 
 

Irregular, unnecessary and excessive expenditures  

 

238. Disbursements of various DOH OUs in the total amount of ₱557,699,748.22 did 
not comply with established rules, procedural guidelines, policies, principles or 

practices, resulting in the incurrence of irregular, unnecessary, and excessive 

expenditures.  

 



146 

 

239. Section 33 of PD No. 1445 states that the Commission shall promulgate such auditing 
and accounting rules and regulations as shall prevent IUEEU expenditures of funds or uses of

I R1MC Members of Consignment Committee were paid with corresponding honoraria in relation to the completion of 
various consignment contract despite them not being entitled as consignment contracts are not considered

243. The apparent disregard of existing laws and regulations affected the regularity, validity 
and propriety of covered transactions. Government funds and property were exposed to the 

risks of loss or misuse.  Notices of disallowances will be issued on said transactions.

established rules, regulations, procedural guidelines, policies, principles or practices and 

avoid IUEEU expenditures to prevent disallowance in audit. 
 

Disadvantageous payment of advances to contractor - ₱12,599,469.21 

 

245. Mobilization fee in the amount of ₱12,599,469.21 was paid for an infrastructure 
project sans determination of the fairness/reasonableness of payment, specifically on site 

readiness, a condition deemed to be highly disadvantageous on the part of government. 
 

246. Section 2 of PD No. 1445 mandates that all resources of the government shall be 
managed, expended or utilized in accordance with law and regulations, and safeguarded 

against loss or wastage through illegal or improper disposition, with a view to ensuring 

efficiency, economy and effectiveness in the operations of government. 

 

247. Section 7, Article II of RA No. 9184 expressly requires that all procurement should be 
meticulously and judiciously planned by the Procuring Entity concerned. 

 

248. No bidding and award of contract for infrastructure projects shall be made unless the 
detailed engineering investigations, surveys and designs, for the project have been sufficiently 

carried out and duly approved in accordance with the standards and specifications prescribed 

by the HoPE concerned or his duly authorized representative, pursuant to the recommendation 

of the end-user or implementing unit (Section 17.6, Rule VI of the 2016 RIRR of RA No. 

9184).  Site investigation is mandatorily required, among others, to be included in a schedule 

of detailed engineering activities per Item 2, Annex “A” of the 2016 RIRR of RA No. 9184. 



150 

 

 

249. Annex “F” of the RIRR provides specific conditions for the allowance of advance 
payment. One condition is that this arrangement must be requested in writing by the consultant 

and subject to the approval of the Government if it deems such payment to be fair and 

reasonable. 

 

250. Our audit showed that the Cebu South Medical Center or CSMC (formerly Talisay 
District Hospital) paid a mobilization fee in the amount of ₱12,599,469.21 for the project 

“One Job Order for Labor and Materials for the Construction of Talisay District Hospital 

Building A Phase 1”.  However, there was delay in the implementation of the project caused 

by problems, foremost of which is the non-availability of the project site on account of an 

existing building, the Emergency Room (ER) and the Out-Patient Department (OPD), which 

the Medical Center was still using in 2019.   

 

251. As of December 31, 2020, a total of 669 days had lapsed since the time the 
mobilization fee was granted, a period wherein the contractor enjoyed the free use of 

government funds without rendering services in return.   

 

252. The failure of the CSMC Management to conduct proper procurement planning and 
apparent desertion of its sacred task in determining reasonableness of advance payment has 

put the government in a highly disadvantageous position. 

 

253. We recommended and the SOH agreed to direct the Legal Service to conduct 
thorough investigation on this matter, impose administrative sanctions to erring 

officials/employees and enjoin the CSMC Management to immediately resolve all issues 

in order to complete the infrastructure project for the benefit of intended beneficiaries. 

 

254. Management commented that the Legal Service conducts preliminary investigation 
pursuant to the DOH AO 2015-0048.  For a proper conduct of preliminary investigation, the 

FMS suggest to refer first to IAS for fact-finding investigation to gather relevant documents 

and identify officials responsible. 

 

They further explained that the CSMC has always been exercising prudence in the 

disbursements of funds. As a matter of fact, the propriety of releasing the Mobilization Fee 

(Advance Payment) was referred to the FMS for evaluation. Based on our record, the actual 

accomplishment for the Project is at 10.07% and no progress billing was paid to the 

Contractor. As of date, the project implementation is ongoing and the Implementing Office 

will regularly report the physical & financial status of the project. 

 

255. The CSMC Management is, as always been, committed to exert earnest efforts to 
ensure speedy implementation of the project without sacrificing quality and integrity of the 

structure. Likewise, will continuously endeavor to properly plan future projects and will not 

acquiesce to causing undue damage to the government.

Delayed/Non-submission of financial reports and transaction documents  

 

256. Various financial reports and transaction documents were not or belatedly 
submitted, thereby prevented the timely conduct of thorough review, evaluation and 

verification by the Auditors and deprived Management of relevant information for 

decision-making.

258. Identified causes of the delayed/non-submission of these records are the following: (a) 
late submission of some DVs  and reports by the Cashier Section and other offices; (b) late 

receipt of the bank statements; (c) voluminous transactions; (d) late completion of the required 

documents such as the receipt of ORs from the payees; (e) adoption of e-NGAS, wherein the 

Accounting Division is still in the transition stage from manual recording to the computerized 

system; (f) lack of coordination between the Accounting Office  and other offices concerned 

in the inspection; (g) lack of awareness in the prescribed period of submission; (h) lack of 

personnel; and (i) declaration of enhanced community quarantine and the difficulties brought 

about by the COVID-19 pandemic such as limitations in the mobility of personnel, 

transportation of documents, work arrangements and the transmission of COVID-19 among 

the personnel. 

 

259. The inability of DOH and its OUs to submit the records on time precluded the auditors 
from conducting timely audit and verification of financial transactions, propriety of 

disbursements and analyzing correctness of accounting entries as well as from communicating 

timely and relevant audit results to Management which could have been used as aid in 

management decisions and inputs in enhancing financial accountability. 

 

260. We recommended and the SOH agreed to: 
 

a. direct the OUs to submit immediately all the perfected contracts, purchase 
orders and the related supporting documents and documentary requirements 

to the respective COA Offices for auditorial and legal review, in compliance 

with COA Circular Nos. 2009-001 and 2012-001; 

  

b. require the concerned officers/employees to strictly and consistently observe 
the timely submission of the required FS and financial reports and related 

schedules and supporting documents as mandated under existing COA rules 

and regulations; otherwise, consider the withholding of salaries of concerned 

officials, if deemed necessary, until the timely submission of financial and 

accounting reports has been complied with, pursuant to Section 122 of PD 

1445;  

 

c. expedite the use of e-NGAS in order to cope with the demand of voluminous 
accounting transactions for a timely recording of accounting records and 



157 

 

submission of reports, and to have access to up-to-date information involving 

financial data or transactions; 

 

d. enroll the bank accounts to the online facility offered by Government Servicing 
Banks to obtain the necessary electronic data in real time for the timely 

preparation and submission of the BRS; and 

 

e. address the lack of manpower in the Accounting Divisions to cope with the 
voluminous transactions. 

 

Non-submission of lists of on-going government PPAs 

 

261. The failure of four OUs to submit necessary information on on-going PPAs 
precluded the prompt verification on the validity and propriety of information, 

implementation publicity and their efficient scheduling of inspection, validation and 

monitoring. 

 

262. Item 1.1 of COA Circular No. 2013-004 dated January 13, 2013 provides that the State 
adopts and implements a policy of full disclosure of all transactions involving public interest 

(Section 28, Article II, 1987 Philippine Constitution) and recognizes the right of the people to 

information on matters of public concern (Section 7, Article III, 1987 Philippine Constitution). 

 

263. Item 2.1 of the said Circular requires that at the beginning of the year, all government 
agencies shall provide their respective assigned Supervising Auditors (SAs) and Audit Team 

Leaders (ATLs) with a list of all on-going government projects/programs/activities (“PPA”) 

and those that are to be implemented during the year.  

 

264. Further, Item 3.1 of the same Circular states that the Head of the Agency shall inform 
its SA and ATL within ten (10) days after the award of the infrastructure project or before the 

start of the program/activity that the appropriate project signboards and/or public notices are 

already posted, and the SA and ATL shall validate the same. 

 

265. It was noted that four OUs, as shown in Table XXXIII, failed to submit complete list 
of their PPAs or to provide sufficient details thereon, contrary to the above-quoted provisions 

of the COA Circular.

NCR LPGH-STC 1,417,378.03 Non-reporting of the self-
constructed COVID Testing 
Laboratory at Las Piñas General 
Hospital and Satellite Trauma 
Center contrary to the 
requirements provided under 
COA Circular 2013-004 dated 
January 30, 2013, as amended 
by COA Circular 2015-006 dated 
August 20, 2015, thus, prevented 
the Audit Team to conduct a 
timely review and evaluation of 
transactions and immediately 
correct any deficiencies found 
therein, if any  

Being the only DOH hospital in the 
South, the Agency is mandated to 
put up a Molecular Laboratory in 
support for the government’s 
COVID-19 testing program. The 
construction of the Laboratory was 
supposed to be done through 
negotiated procurement but no 
contractor would want to take the 
project. Being one of the 
benefactors of the Agency, 
Senator Cynthia Villar offered to 
take the project and to pay its labor 
expenses. The materials and 
equipment for the project were 
procured using Agency’s MOOE.

Insufficient details provided in

Management submitted an 
updated report as of March 15, 
2021 providing information 
required on the GPPA report.  

Total   281,127,192.42      

 

266. The failure of the OUs to submit the required listings, caused by apparent neglect of 
responsible officials/employees, depicts weakness in the internal controls, creates doubt as to 

the reliability of reports and precluded the prompt verification of the validity and propriety of 

information and publicity on PPAs.  The efficient scheduling of inspection, validation and 

monitoring of PPAs was also not performed. 

 

267. We recommended and the SOH agreed to: 
 

a. remind the OUs to cause the submission of lists of all ongoing PPAs and those 
to be implemented during the year to the Audit Teams at the beginning of the 

year; 

 

b. direct concerned officials/employees of the OUs to inform the COA Auditors 
within ten (10) days after the award of the infrastructure projects or before 

the start of the program activity that the appropriate project signboards 

and/or public notices are already posted; and 



159 

 

 

c. instruct the OUs to, henceforth, observe strictly the provisions of COA 
Circular No. 2013-004 dated January 30, 2013. 

 

Incomplete submission of documentary requirements - ₱45,849,113,881.05 

 

268. Governmental transactions in the total amount of ₱45,849,113,881.05 were not 
supported with complete documentary requirements contrary to law and regulations, 

and casted doubts on the validity, regularity and propriety of transactions. 
 

269. Section 4(6) of PD No. 1445 provides that claims against government funds shall be 
supported with complete documentation. 

 

270. COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 sets forth the specific documentary 
requirements for each type of disbursement. 

 

271. Various other issuances were released in order to guide the government agencies in 
the processing of transactions, depending on the nature of the same. 

 

272. Our audit found that several transactions were not supported with adequate documents 
and DVs and other documents not stamped “PAID”.  Details are shown in Annex XI.   

 

273. Other than non-adherence of existing law and regulations, the incomplete submission 
of supporting documents rendered the ascertainment of the propriety, regularity, and validity 

of the transactions difficult.  Moreover, the practice of not stamping “PAID” all disbursement 

vouchers and its supporting documents after payment is susceptible to double payment of 

claims and is not in line with sound internal control on disbursements of government funds.  

 

274. We recommended and the SOH agreed to direct the CO and OUs, in writing, to: 
 

a. submit complete documentary support on all transactions in compliance with 
the law and existing regulations; and 

 

b. strictly comply with the requirement of stamping “PAID” all DVs and their 
supporting documents after payment. 

 

Non-provision of storeroom for safekeeping of records  

 

275. The COA Offices in EV-CHD and TRC Dulag, Leyte were not provided with 
adequate storeroom facility for safekeeping of records contrary to law and regulation, 

and thus, exposed such records to risks of loss and damage. 

 

276. Section 26 of PD No. 1445 provides that the authority and power of the Commission 
shall extend to and comprehend all matters relating to auditing procedures, systems and 

controls, the keeping of the general accounts of the Government, the preservation of vouchers 

pertaining thereto for a period of ten years.  



160 

 

 

277. On the other hand, Section 20 of the law further states that there shall be in each agency 
of the government an auditing unit which shall be provided by the audited agency with a 

suitable and sufficient office space together with supplies, equipment, furniture, and other 

necessary operating expenses for its proper maintenance, including expenses for travel and 

transportation.  

 

278. In line with the above provision, COA Circular No. 2011-001 dated July 5, 2011 
requires that each agency shall provide all audit groups/teams assigned to them the following, 

among others: (a) adequate office space as befits the representative(s) of the COA, well-

ventilated and properly maintained in terms of aesthetics, security, safety and cleanliness; (b) 

storeroom for the vouchers and documents over which the COA has legal custody, which is 

adequate in size and property secured from the elements, including from individuals/groups 

with malicious/evil intentions.  For the purpose, the auditees concerned shall include the 

financial requirements for the above-mentioned audit support items in their respective budgets 

for maintenance and other operating expenses (MOOE) and capital outlay pertaining to 

COA/Auditing Services. 

 

279. Although the COA Offices in EV-CHD and TRC-Dulag have storerooms, these are 
not adequate to store the voluminous documentations which include transaction documents 

with their supporting papers and other official documents submitted by the said OUs. All such 

documentation accumulated monthly and could no longer fit in the storerooms provided to the 

Audit Teams.  

 

280. The inadequate storerooms provided by the said OUs expose their own documents to 
risks of loss, deterioration and unauthorized interferences from interested entities/individuals 

and outsiders. It must be emphasized that since the auditee’s management is responsible for 

the provision of stockroom to the auditing unit, the loss of any document caused by the 

inadequate storage room will remain the accountability of the former. 

 

281. We recommended and the SOH direct the concerned OUs’ Management to 
prioritize the provision of adequate storage facility through allocation of sufficient 

budgetary requirements thereof. 

 

Unauthorized removal of records from COA storage facility 

 

282. The confidentiality of public records under COA custody in RMC was 
compromised due to removal from the designated storage area without authority, 

contrary to existing law and regulation.  

 

283. Section 43 of PD No. 1445 mandates that the auditors in all auditing units shall have 
the custody, and be responsible for the safekeeping and preservation of paid expense vouchers, 

journal vouchers, stubs of treasury warrants or checks, reports of collection and disbursements 

and similar documents, together with their respective supporting papers, under regulation of 

the Commission. 

 



161 

 

284. Article 2 of the IRR of RA No. 9470 states that public records are essential to the 
administration and operation of all government offices, whether national or local, including 

GOCCs and GFIs. Such records need to be systematically managed to ensure preservation of 

historically valuable materials, to provide ready access to vital information and to promote the 

efficient and economical operation of government. 

 

285. Article 133 thereof requires that all public records of the government, whether national 
or local, and the political subdivisions thereof shall be kept in facilities maintained by the 

agencies and offices responsible for the creation and maintenance of such records, unless the 

consent of the National Archives of the Philippines is obtained for their transfer or storage 

elsewhere. 

 

286. The IRR further provides that the commission of acts in violation of RA 9470 
constitutes an offense and provides penalties therefore stated in Articles 123 and 124. 

 

287. On July 30-31, 2020, documents pertaining to transactions of the RMC under the 
custody of the COA were transferred from the designated storage area in the dormitory 

building to an area exposed to risks of destruction and loss. This was done without prior 

communication or permission properly obtained from the Audit Team. The area to which the 

documents were transferred to is a space between two buildings which is exposed to rainwater, 

causing the destruction of the documents beyond recovery.  

 

288. The incident was communicated to the RMC Management through a letter dated 
August 3, 2020. In the said letter, the Audit Team requested a written communication 

regarding the circumstances which resulted in the abrupt transfer of the documents from its 

designated storage area. It was also requested that a written communication be provided for 

similar incidents in the future. No response was received from the Management. 

 

289. On December 3, 2020, documents under the custody of the Audit Team were again 
transferred by Management without proper notice and authority to a makeshift storage area 

enclosed by galvanized iron sheets. During the inspection conducted on March 18, 2021, it 

was found out that the documents had been severely damaged due to exposure to moisture and 

covered with dust. Furthermore, the completeness of the documents is now doubtful since 

they were placed in an area easily accessible by any person.  

 

290. The unauthorized transfer/removal of documents caused by lack of coordination and 
communication with the Audit Team has compromised the confidentiality nature of the 

documents and led to the damage and possible loss of said records. 

 

291. We recommended and the SOH agreed to: 
 

a. direct the Legal Service to conduct a thorough investigation on the incident 
that happened and impose sanctions to responsible officials/employees when 

warranted; and 

 



162 

 

b. remind the RMC Management to henceforth, refrain from the unauthorized 
transfer of records under COA custody and secure proper 

authority/permission when the need to transfer the same arises. 

 

292. Management commented that for a proper conduct of preliminary investigation 
pursuant to DOH AO 2015-0048 and the 2017 Revised Rules of Administrative Cases in the 

Civil Service, the Legal Service suggested to refer first to IAS for fact-finding investigation 

to gather relevant documents and identify officials responsible. 

 

Reporting on Disaster Risk Reduction and Management (DRRM) Funds and Donations 

Received 

 

293. The non-compliance with the requirements on reporting and publication of 
receipts and utilization of DRRM funds as well as cash and in-kind donations as required 

by pertinent law, rules and regulations runs counter to the government’s thrust towards 

transparency and accountability. 

 

294. Section 22 (d) of RA No. 10121 requires that all departments/agencies and LGUs that 
are allocated with DRRM funds shall submit to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and 

Management Council (NDRRMC) their monthly statements on the utilization of DRRM funds 

and make an accounting thereof in accordance with existing accounting and auditing rules. 

 

295. COA Circular No. 2014-002 dated April 15, 2014 provides the accounting and 
reporting guidelines on the receipt and utilization of National Disaster Risk Reduction and 

Management Funds (NDRRMF), cash and in-kind aids/donations from local and foreign 

sources, and funds allocated from the agency regular budget for DRRM program, pursuant to 

RA 10121.  The prescribed reports are required to be submitted to the NDRRMC through the 

Office of Civil Defense (OCD), copy furnished respective COA Auditors, and posted in the 

official websites of the implementing/done-agency, OCD and NDRRMC. 

 

296. COA Circular No. 2020-009 dated April 21, 2020 temporarily relaxed the application 
of certain provisions of the aforementioned Circular in areas subject to quarantine in so far as 

receipt, recording, distribution, reporting and direct release of donations in-kind and relief 

goods to the beneficiaries are concerned during the period of the State of Calamity declared 

under Proclamation No. 929 dated March 16, 2020.  However, recipient agencies are still 

required to submit within ten (10) working days after the end of the quarantine, or if the 

quarantine exceeds three (3) months, within ten (10) working days after the end of each 

quarter, a Summary/List of Donations Received, Distributed and Balances for donations in-

kind received from local and foreign sources, and a one-time report, separately for cash 

donations and in-kind donations, to the NDRRMC, through the OCD (OCD), copy furnished 

the respective COA Auditors. 

 

297. In the course of our audit, we noted that there were cases of non-compliance with the 
accounting and reporting guidelines on the receipt and utilization of DRRM funds and 

donations received, as shown in Table XXXIV. 
 

 



163 

 

Table XXXIV. Deficiencies in reporting DRRM funds and donations received 

Region OUs Observation Remarks 

NCR CO Non-preparation/submission of reports to 
the NDRRMC through the OCD 

 

As verified with the Budget Division, the preparation of the reports 
on the receipt and utilization of the DRRM Funds sourced from the 
GAA and cash donations were accomplished monthly.  The reports, 
however, were directly submitted to the DBM instead of the 
NDRRMC through the OCD and the COA Auditor. 

Non-posting of reports in the DOH 
website 

 

According to the Budget Division, the non-posting of the Cash 
Donation Report for the second quarter was already communicated 
to the DOH Web Team.  Accordingly, the 4th quarterly report was 
not yet updated due to frequent revisions of the Statement of 
Allotments, Obligations, Balances and Disbursements (SAOBD) for 
CY 2020, hence, the request for web posting was not done.  

Absence of inventory list of procured 
DRRM items and the quarterly/one-time 
report was not officially submitted to the 
NDRRMC through the OCD. 

According to the Property Officer, only a partial report was prepared 
by their office because for March 2020, all donations were received 
at the Central Office while from April 2020 to December 2020, the 
donation in-kind and even the procured DRRM items were delivered 
to the OCD. They already coordinated with the OIC Director for the 
complete details of the report for CY 2020. 

 NCH Failed to submit the Summary/List of 
Donations Received, Distributed and 
Balances of COVID-19 related donations 
received with an aggregate amount of 
₱70,926,691.80 to NDRRMC thru the 
OCD.  Moreover, the documentary 
requirements for donations in-kind 
related to COVID-19 were not 
consistently submitted to the audit team 
thus, precluding complete and proper 
audit of the COVID-19 donations. 

Management explained that they are not aware that the said reports 
are required to be submitted to the NDRRMC. 

 

 TMC Failure to prepare the necessary 
documents/reports for the proper 
accounting of COVID-19 related 
donations in-kind amounting to at least 
₱77,924,303.58 

Lack of awareness of the COA guidelines that require the separate 
reporting and monitoring of COVID-19 related donations in-kind.  

 SLH Failure to submit the Summary/List of 
Donations Received, Distributed and 
Balances of COVID-19 related donations 
received with an aggregate amount of 
₱1,298,553,978.24 to the NDRRMC, thru 

the OCD 

 

 

The Management Materials Department (MMD) prepares on a 
monthly basis the Report of Donated Supplies and Report of 
Donated Drugs and Medicines. However, said report does not 
provide details/information on the distribution and balances of the 
said donated items. Also, separate reports namely, Distribution List 
of Equipment (Donation-COVID 19) and Distribution List of Semi-
Expendable Equipment (Donation-COVID 19) are prepared by the 
MMD for equipment and semi-expendable equipment received 
through donations which shows information on donated items 
received and distribution thereof. Said reports were submitted to the 
Accounting Department and to the Audit Team but not to NDRRMC 
and OCD. 

 JRRMMC Failure to submit the required reports and 
necessary supporting documents to 
properly account COVID-19 related 
donations in-kind valued at 
₱29,482,268.64 as of December 31, 

2020. 

The Health Emergency Management Committee (HEMC) explained 
that they were not able to submit the required supporting documents 
to the Audit Team due to the enormous volume of supporting 
documents. 

X APMC Failure to furnish the Audit Team with the 
one-time report, separately for cash and 
in-kind donations on sources and 
utilization of DRRM funds to the 
NDRRMC through the OCD 

This failure can be attributed to the inadequate knowledge of the 
key personnel on the subject COA Circulars or the lack of personnel 
due to the pandemic that occurred, considering that they are 
frontline workers. 

 



164 

 

298. These conditions are counter-beneficial to the DOH’s continued efforts of improving 
transparency and accountability in the handling of DRRM funds and donations and also 

precluded the Auditors from validating the receipts, distribution and balances of donations 

received.   

 

299. We recommended and the SOH agreed to direct concerned offices of the CO and 
OUs to strictly comply with the provisions of COA Circular Nos. 2014-002 and 2020-009 

and integrate the same in an internal DOH policy/issuance. 

 

Uninsured properties with the GSIS - ₱ 34,869,776,746.18 

 

300. Despite the mandatory requirement to insure all government properties with the 
General Insurance Fund (GIF) of the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) 

pursuant to existing laws, rules and regulations, properties owned by the DOH with total 

cost of ₱34,869,776,746.18 remained not insured with the GSIS GIF, exposing the 

government to unnecessary risk of not being indemnified for any damage or loss due to 

any fortuitous events such as fire, earthquake, typhoon and/or flood. 

 

301. RA No. 656, otherwise known as the Property Insurance Law, as amended by PD No. 
245, requires all government agencies (except municipal governments below first class 

category) to insure against any insurable risk their properties, assets, and interests with the 

GIF, as administered by GSIS. 

 

302. To strictly enforce this law, AO No. 33 was signed in 1987, requiring government 
agencies to submit an updated inventory of properties of their respective offices to the GSIS 

and to secure from the GIF an insurance covering all its properties.   

 

303. In addition to AO No. 33, COA Circular No. 92-390 dated November 11, 1992 was 
issued to assist GSIS in ensuring that all insurable assets and properties of the government 

were adequately covered/insured with the GIF. 

 

304. COA Circular No. 2018-002 dated May 31, 2018 was issued, setting up the guidelines 
prescribing the submission of the Property Inventory Form (PIF) as basis for the assessment 

of general insurance coverage over all insurable assets, properties and interests of the 

government with the GIF of the GSIS.  As defined in Item 4.1 thereof, the term property 

includes vessels and craft, motor vehicles, machineries, permanent buildings, properties stored 

therein (i.e. furniture, fixtures, equipment, supplies and materials, etc.) or in buildings rented 

by the government, or properties in transit, the ownership of which had already passed to the 

government. 

 

305. In recent years, the weather conditions in the Philippines have drastically changed.  
Typhoon and flooding incidents continue to increase and become more frequent while 

earthquakes have become a major risk that the country also has to grapple with.  Various 

catastrophic perils have either damaged or destroyed buildings and other structures, especially 

those belonging to the government.  The DOH, given its considerable number of buildings 

and health-care infrastructure, is of no exemption.  To protect these DOH properties, Fire and 



165 

 

Allied Perils Insurance must be secured from the GSIS GIF to cover loss or damage of assets 

and guarantee immediate damage control, repair and replacement thereby reducing 

interruption of the DOH and its OUs’ delivery of public service through health infrastructure. 

 

306. Our verification showed that properties amounting to ₱34,869,776,746.18 owned by 
the CO and six OUs, as shown in Table XXXV, were not insured with the GIF due to: (a) 

overlooked application for insurance of building structures; (b) misunderstanding between 

offices on who should apply for the property insurance in one regional office; (c) budget 

constraints; (d) neglect in the performance of prescribed procedures in order to insure assets 

and the evident non-interest of what the law and pertinent regulations require; (e) absence of 

internal policy/controls incorporating the relevant provisions of laws and regulations and 

directing concerned officials/employees to comply strictly with those mandatory provisions; 

and (f) observance of the cut-off period.

APMC 121,020,412.95  

Total 34,869,776,746.18 

 

307. Other deficiencies noted in SLH are the following: (a) the insurance did not cover 
other perils such as typhoons, flood, and theft; (b) untimely renewal of insurance; and (c) 

delayed submission of PIF to the Audit Team for validation purposes.  On the other hand, 

APMC failed to submit PIF to its Audit Team. 

 

308. The non-compliance with the requirements under the aforecited laws and regulations 
denies the government adequate and reliable protection against any damage to or loss of its 

properties or assets and interests due to any unforeseen events that may occur. It also deprived 

the GSIS of substantial premium income that should have formed part of the GIF.  

 

309. We recommended and the SOH agreed to require the CO and OUs to: 
 

a. facilitate the provision of insurance coverage of the identified insurable 
properties by allotting additional funds for the required cost of premiums to 

ensure indemnification of the equivalent value thereof in case of eventuality 

that may occur; 

 

b. monitor and ensure the continuity of insurance coverage of all insurable 
assets/properties; 

 



166 

 

c. formulate and issue internal policy/controls incorporating the relevant 
provisions of laws and regulations and directing concerned officials/employees 

to comply fully with those mandatory provisions; 

 

d. ensure the timely submission of PIF and GIF to the GSIS, and to the Auditors 
not later than April 30 of each year; and 

 

e. henceforth, comply fully with the Property Insurance law and applicable 
regulations. 

 

Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Funds for FYs 2016 and 2017 

 

310. The DOH has no remaining balance of funds intended for this program. 
 

Typhoon Yolanda Funds 

 

311. In CY 2020, the DOH received NCA amounting to ₱305,000.00 which was transferred 
to the Philippine Institute of Traditional and Alternative Health Care (PITAHC) covering 

financial assistance to PITAHC Tacloban Employees per Check No. 594058 dated December 

9, 2020 and recorded under JEV No. 2020-12-000423 on the same date.  On the other hand, 

previously reported fund transfers to CHD VI and PhilHealth amounting to ₱9,233,757.23 

remained unliquidated as of December 31, 2020, to wit:

Marawi Crisis Funds 

 

312. For CY 2020, the DOH received NCA Nos. BMB-B-20-0006448 and BMB-B-20-
0009944 in the amounts of ₱1,688,800.00 and ₱2,499,000.00, respectively, to cover trust 

receipts representing donations made by the Chinese Embassy as financial assistance for the 

Marawi crisis. The amount was likewise utilized for the procurement of light cargo truck and 

light delivery van for the total amount of ₱4,145,130.00, leaving an unutilized balance of 

₱42,670.00 which lapsed and reverted to the BTr on December 29, 2020 per JEV No. 2020-

12-000458. 

 

313. Further, DOH received NCA No. BMB-B-20-0014637 in the amount of 
₱58,900,000.00 to cover the Site Development and Landscaping in preparation for the 

construction of the Marawi City General Hospital per Office of the President's approval dated 

November 17, 2020 with SARO NO. BMB-20-0020677 dated November 27, 2020 amounting 



167 

 

to ₱62,000,000.00. No obligation was made pertaining to these funds, thus, the same lapsed 

and were reverted to the National Treasury. 

 

Gender and Development (GAD) Program 

 

314. Several OUs failed to submit their GAD reports and various other 
lapses/deficiencies were noted, thus, casted doubts as to whether the DOH was able to 

fully promote GAD and attain the intent and purpose of legislation to address gender 

issues within their mandate. 

 

315. Section 31 of the General Provisions of the FY 2020 GAA provides, among others, 
that the GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of the agencies, which shall be 

at least five percent (5%) of their budgets. For this purpose, activities currently being 

undertaken by agencies which relate to GAD or those that contribute to poverty alleviation, 

economic empowerment especially of marginalized women, protection, promotion, and 

fulfilment of women’s human rights, and practice of gender-responsive governance are 

considered sufficient compliance with said requirement. Utilization of the GAD budget shall 

be evaluated based on the GAD performance indicators identified by the said agencies. 

 

316. In COA Circular No. 2014-001 dated March 18, 2014, it is stated that the audited 
agency shall submit a copy of the Annual GPB to the COA Audit Team assigned to the agency 

within five (5) working days from the receipt of the approved plan from the Philippine 

Commission on Women (PCW) or their mother or central offices, as the case may be. 

Likewise, a copy of the corresponding Accomplishment Report (AR) shall be furnished to the 

said Audit Team within five (5) working days from the end of January of the preceding year. 

 

317. The following lapses and deficiencies in the preparation and submission of the GPB 
and GAD AR as well as in the implementation of GAD activities were observed:

fully promote GAD and attain the intent and purpose of legislation to address gender issues 

within their mandate. 

 

319. We recommended and the SOH agreed to direct the OUs to: 
 

a. promptly submit to their respective Audit Teams the GPB as well as GAD AR 
within the prescribed period pursuant to COA Circular No. 2014-001; 

 

b. ensure that GAD planned activities are undertaken in the ensuing years;  
 

c. orient and capacitate agency personnel involved in GAD planning and 
budgeting through relevant trainings; and 

 

d. establish/institutionalize the GAD database to include gender statistics and 
sex-disaggregated data that have been systematically produced or gathered as 

inputs or bases for planning, budgeting, programming, and policy 

formulation. 
 

 

 

 

 



169 

 

320. Management commented that: 
 

 The total GAD budget utilization of the DOH as an agency (which includes the CO, 
CHDs, DOH-managed hospitals, TRC, FDA and BOQ) was ₱82,428,288,688.31 or 

56.35% of the DOH OSEC’s 2020 GAA amounting to ₱146,277,881,630.00. 

 

 The submission of the GAD reports is dependent on the PCW’s policy issuance and 
timeline considering that the GAD report are submitted through their managed data 

system, and undergoes a review process. With this may we respectfully recommend 

that the COA and PCW harmonize the timeline of the GAD report submission. 

 

 The DOH GAD Focal Point System Secretariat chaired by the Health Policy 
Development and Planning Bureau is currently prioritizing the finalization of the 

DOH GAD Agenda for UHC which shall serve as the road map for the annual GAD 

Plan and Budget of the DOH. The recommendations cited from b to d shall being 

considered in the development process. 

 

Senior Citizens (SCs) and Persons with Disability (PWDs) 

 

321. The DOH generally complied with Section 32 of the General Provisions of the FY 
2020 GAA intended to address the concerns of SCs and PWDs, however, some 

lapses/deficiencies were observed in some OUs which affected the full attainment of the 

purpose of said legislation.  

 

322. Section 32 of the General Provision of the FY 2020 GAA states that all government 
agencies shall formulate plans, programs and projects intended to address the concerns of SCs 

and PWDs, insofar as it relates to their mandated functions, and integrate the same in their 

regular activities. Moreover, all government infrastructures and facilities shall provide 

architectural or structural features, designs or facilities that will reasonably enhance the 

mobility, safety and welfare of persons with disability pursuant to Batas Pambansa Blg. 344 

and R.A No. 7277, as amended. 

 

323. In support of the RA Nos. 9257 (The Expanded Senior Citizens Act of 2003) and the 
9994 (Expanded Senior Citizen Act of 2010), the DOH issued AOs for health implementers 

to undertake and promote the health and wellness of SCs as well as to alleviate the conditions 

of older persons who are encountering degenerative diseases. 

 

324. Under the current Philippine Health Agenda (2017-2022), centralized health services 
for care in all life stages, service delivery networks, and financial risk protection, geriatric 

health are mentioned as areas of concern.  All SCs are mandatorily covered by the Philippine 

Health Insurance Corporation by virtue of RA No. 10642. 

 

325. Among the activities continuously conducted for the Health and Wellness Program for 
SCs is the development of the following: (1) Social Media Cards for Healthy ageing; and (2) 

Geriatric Training Manual for Primary Health Services Providers. 

 



170 

 

326. On the other hand, activities for the implementation of programs for PWDs were also 
conducted during CY 2020.  Said activities include: Review and Updates on Disability 

Inclusive Health, Rehabilitation Services, Peer Counselling and Homecare; National 

Disability and Prevention Rehabilitation Week Celebration; and Training on the Philippine 

Registry for Person with Disability Version 3. 
 

327. Moreover, it is noteworthy that the OUs generally addressed the concerns of SCs and 
PWDs in relation with their mandated functions through (a) free health care services such as 

laboratory examination, rehabilitation medicines and inpatient/outpatient treatment, provision 

of medical and laboratory supplies, drugs and medicines; (b) provision of   access 

ramp/handrails in all hospital buildings and priority lanes for SCs and PWDs; (c) financial 

assistance and discounts on laboratory examinations, medicines and hospital bills; (c) 

coordination with LGUs on allocation and inoculation of Pneumococcal and Influenza 

vaccines to SCs; (d) conduct of  webinar/orientation to SCs re: “Caring for the Elderly in times 

of COVID”; (e) conduct of “Rehabilitation Week for PWDs”; (f) Medical Residents provided 

orientation on “Proper Care for Senior Citizens”; and (g) Virtual Regional Convention of 

PWDs, among others.  These activities, for which a total of at least ₱685,732,250.84 was spent 

by the concerned OUs, as shown in Annex XII, undoubtedly benefitted their clients and 

personnel who are SCs and PWDs. 
 

328. However, some lapses and deficiencies were observed in the following OUs:

XIII CRH 

TRC- Caraga, Surigao City Did not formulate plans, programs/projects intended to

329. The above conditions are due to poor planning by management where the GAD plan 
and budget should have been integrated and mainstreamed in its program/projects/activities 

address gender related issues. Said conditions have adversely affected the full attainment of 

the purpose of the aforementioned laws of enhancing the mobility, safety and welfare of senior 

citizens and PWDs. 



171 

 

 

330. We recommended and the SOH agreed to direct all its OUs to fully comply with 
the requirements in the GAA of FY 2020 to allocate funds and formulate programs, 

projects and activities that address the concerns of SCs and PWDs insofar as it relates 

to their mandated functions and ensure that GAD Plan is integrated and mainstreamed 

in its program/projects/activities to address gender issues and gender responsive 

governance in compliance with the provisions of Sec. 31 of the GAA for FY 2020 and 

Section 3.4 of PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular 2012-01. 
 

Programs and projects related to youth development  

 

331. Section 33 of the General Provision of the FY 2020 GAA provides that all agencies of 
the government shall provide allocation for youth development projects and activities within 

the framework of the Philippine Youth Development Plan (2017-2022). 

 

332. In CY 2020, only nine OUs had reportedly conducted activities for youth development,
