A. Introduction 
 

The Department of Health (DOH) is mandated to be the over-all technical authority 

on health. The major mandate of DOH is to provide national policy direction and develop 

national plans, technical standards and guidelines on health. It is also a regulator of all 

health services and products; and provider of special or tertiary health care services and of

Essentially, the DOH has three specific roles in the health sector: leadership in health, 

enabler and capacity builder and administrator of specific services namely, national and 

sub-national health facilities and hospitals serving as referral centers, direct services for 

emergent health concerns requiring complicated technologies and assessed as critical for

 Oversee financing of the health sector and ensure equity and accessibility to 
health services; and  

 Articulate the national health research agenda and ensure the provision of 
sufficient resources and logistics to attain excellence in evidenced-based 

intervention for health.  

 

Together with its attached agencies, the DOH with seven Functional Management 

Teams in the Central Office, Centers for Health Development (CHD) in every region, 

DOH-Hospitals  and Treatment for Rehabilitation Centers (TRCs) performs its roles to 

continuously improve the country’s health care system and to implement the FOURmula 

One Plus for Health (F1+for Health) Strategic Framework. 

 

To perform these functions are the various central bureaus and services in the Central 

Office, Center for Health Development (CHD) in 16 regions, 65 hospitals, one (1) 

laboratory facility and 18 Treatment and Rehabilitation Centers (TRCs), two (2) two 

bureaus, namely Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Bureau of Quarantine (BOQ). 

(Annexes A).  

 

The DOH has the following attached agencies: one national government agency, the 

National Nutrition Council (NNC); two government corporations, namely: Philippine 

Health Insurance Corporation (PHIC) and Philippine Institute of Traditional and 

Alternative Health Care (PITAHC); and four specialty hospitals, namely Lung Center of 

the Philippines (LCP), National Kidney and Transplant Institute (NKTI), Philippine 

Children’s Medical Center (PCMC) and Philippine Heart Center (PHC).  

 

The PHIC, as an attached agency, is implementing the National Health Insurance 

Law and administers the medical care program for both public and private sectors.  It has 

provincial health teams made up of DOH representatives to local health boards and 

technical personnel for communicable disease control. 

 

The Centers for Health Development (CHDs) are responsible for the field operations 

of the Department in each region and for providing catchment areas with efficient and 

effective medical services. They are, likewise, tasked to coordinate with regional offices 

of the other Departments, offices and agencies for health-related concerns, as well as with 

the LGUs, the DOH partners, in the implementation of various public health programs.  

 

On the other hand, the DOH hospitals provide hospital-based medical care, 

specialized or general services, some conduct research on clinical priorities and some are 

training hospitals for medical specialization. In 2003, the DOH hospitals were provided 

fiscal autonomy, allowing 100 percent retention and use of hospitals’ income to improve 

health facilities.  

 

The DOH is headed by Secretary Francisco T. Duque III, who leads the nationwide 

implementation of the F1+for Health and exercises overall supervision and control over 



iii 

the Teams. He is assisted by seven (7) Functional Management Teams for the 

implementation of the F1+for Health Strategic Framework, headed by either an 

Undersecretary of Health or Assistant Secretary or both: 

 

1. Office of the Chief of Staff (OCS) and Health Regulation Team (HRT)

C. Scope of Audit 
 

The consolidated audit report covers the audit of the accounts and operations of the 

DOH CO, 16 CHDs, 12 TRCs, 65 Hospitals, 1 laboratory facility and 2 Bureaus for the 

year ended December 31, 2020 or a total of 97 out of 103 DOH Offices. Annex A-1 shows 

the list of DOH Offices not included in this report. The audit was conducted to: (a) verify 

the level of assurance that may be placed on management’s assertions on the financial 

statements; (b) recommend agency’s improvement opportunities, (c) determine the 

propriety of transactions as well as the extent of compliance with pertinent laws, rules and 

regulations, and (d) determine the extent of implementation of prior year’s audit 

recommendations. 

 

The audit covered some of the identified audit thrust areas per Memoranda dated 

October 11, 2019 (General Audit Instructions for CY 2020 audit), October 21, 2019 

(Specific Audit Instructions on the preparation of DOH CY 2020 Audits), July 27, 2020 

(Supplemental General Audit Instructions for CY 2020 audit), and October 1, 2020 

(Supplemental Specific Audit Instructions for CY 2019 Audits); in addition to the areas 

observed in the course of our risk-assessment during the year. 

 

D. Independent Auditor’s Report 
 

An adverse opinion was rendered on the financial statements of the DOH as of 

December 31, 2020 due to the total misstatements in Asset accounts amounted to 

₱70,894,401,298.55 which represents 26.97% of the total assets, while the Liabilities and 

Net Assets/Equity accounts were misstated by ₱944,035,967.72 or 3.66% and 

₱70,171,552,317.53 or 29.60%, respectively. Moreover, accounting deficiencies were 

noted in Cash, Receivables, Inventory and PPE accounts totaling ₱95,140,718,253.12 

representing 36.19% of the total assets, in Liability accounts of ₱3,229,902,013.08 or 

12.51% of total liabilities and ₱33,388,737,795.50 or 14.08% of total equity.  

 

E. Summary of Significant Observations and Recommendations 
 

The observations and recommendations, discussed in detail in Part II of the report, 

the most significant of which are shown below: 

 

1. Various deficiencies involving some ₱ 67,323,186,570.57 worth of public funds and 
intended for national efforts of combatting the unprecedented scale of the COVID-19 

crisis were noted.  These deficiencies contributed to the challenges encountered and 



vi 

missed opportunities by the DOH during the time of state of calamity/national 

emergency, and casted doubts on the regularity of related transactions. 

 

We requested that the SOH implement the recommendations contained in the 

Consolidated Management Letter (CML) on the audit of COVID-19 Funds for the 

year ended December 31, 2020 and submit a status report on the actions taken on 

the audit recommendations stated therein. 
 

2. Equipment in the aggregate amount of ₱1,225,260,566.29 procured under the HFEP 
were found to be either undelivered, unutilized, and/or without calibration and 

preventive maintenance, while several HFEP infrastructure projects with total value of 

₱2,832,390,057.53 were either idle/unutilized or with substantial delay in 

implementation, thus, exposing these properties to the risks of deterioration, loss, lapse 

of warranty period and wastage of government funds, thus, depriving the public of the 

benefits they could have derived from the immediate and maximum use of said facilities 

and resulted to the non-attainment of the program objectives.  

 

We recommended and the SOH agreed to: 
 

a. require the HFEP Team to: (i) properly plan, assess and evaluate the 
equipment to be procured in terms of availability of space, facilities and 

immediate needs of the recipient hospitals to attain the maximum use of the 

HFEP equipment; (ii) immediately address the implementation challenges in 

various infrastructure projects and come up with detailed plan on how to 

address the problems encountered; and (iii) closely coordinate with the 

concerned OUs in planning, monitoring and supervision of HFEP projects; 

 

b. instruct the heads of OUs to: (i) demand the suppliers to deliver the equipment 
immediately and in accordance with the terms and specifications so that these 

can be utilized by the intended beneficiaries; (ii) ensure readiness of the 

recipient facilities in receiving the equipment (i.e. enough power supply, 

availability of the space/location, availability and trainings of necessary 

personnel, and availability of turn-over documents) during the procurement 

and before implementation; and (iii)  ensure that the suppliers regularly 

conduct calibration and preventive maintenance of the equipment; and 

 

c. instruct both the HFEP Team and concerned OUs to facilitate the full 
operation of the newly-built infrastructures and ensure the immediate 

installation of needed equipment, electrical power, and all other needed 

utilities. 
 

3. Deficiencies were noted in the distribution of centrally-procured assets to various OUs 
in the total amount of ₱65,356,720.70 and which reflected deficient asset distribution 

system in the CO. 

 

 



vii 

We recommended and the SOH agreed to: 

 

a. require concerned offices to establish coordination among themselves to 
ensure that all the equipment and inventories are delivered immediately within 

a reasonable period of time to the intended recipients by closely monitoring 

the status of deliveries of supplies and equipment, facilitate the immediate 

distribution of the items not yet received by the recipients, submit explanation 

on the cause/s for the non- or late delivery thereof to the intended recipients, 

and execute MOAs, deeds of donation or other equivalent documents in the 

transfer of centrally-procured items to ensure clear terms regarding their 

utilization; 

 

b. direct the concerned offices in the CO to provide the pertinent 
documents/records to the recipient facilities to establish property 

accountability and custodianship and as basis in recording in the recipient’s 

books of accounts of transferred accountabilities by the CO, and require them 

to record said equipment immediately upon receipt of the equipment and 

documents;  

 

c. instruct the Knowledge Management and Information Technology Service 
(KMITS) to issue policies and procedures to extend validation and monitoring 

of equipment up to the proper recording in the books of accounts, coordinate 

with the Accounting Division of the CO and forward the JEVs made by the 

latter to the end-users/recipients to ensure proper establishment of the 

property custodianship for equipment and computer software distributed by 

CO, and ensure that the actual needs of intended recipients or end-users are 

considered in the allocation list of computer software for distribution to avoid 

idleness and non-utilization; 

 

d. direct concerned offices to submit an action plan as to specific courses of action 
that will be undertaken in order to avoid the deficiencies from recurring again, 

officials/employees responsible and specific timelines thereof; and 

 

e. impose appropriate sanctions to officials/employees responsible for the 
deficiencies, in accordance with PD No. 1445, the Administrative Code and 

other applicable laws, rules and regulations. 
 

4. Drugs, medicines and other types of inventories with a total value of ₱95,675,058.98 
were found to be nearly expired and/or have expired due to deficient procurement 

planning, poor distribution and monitoring systems, and identified weakness in internal 

controls.  This recurring problem of the DOH has resulted to indiscriminate wastage of 

government funds and resources, and impedes the attainment of DOH’s mission of 

leading the country in the development of a productive, resilient, equitable and people-

centered health system. 

 

We recommended and the SOH agreed: (a) take immediate action/concrete steps 

in resolving all issues associated with the recurring problem such as improvement 



viii 

of procurement planning, strengthening of distribution and monitoring systems, 

and review of internal controls; and (b) direct the Legal Service and AFMT to 

conduct thorough investigations and impose appropriate sanctions on all erring 

officials and employees whose neglect caused wastage of government funds. 
 

5. Considerable amounts of unobligated allotments totaling ₱24,641,119,764.42 as of 
December 31, 2020, aimed at strengthening the Department’s capacity to ensuring 

access to basic public health services to all Filipinos and further buttressing the health 

care delivery system, were noted.  This condition affects the efficient utilization of 

public funds vis-à-vis the agency’s implementation capabilities and its response to the 

urgent healthcare needs during the time of state of calamity/national emergency. 

 

We recommended and the SOH agreed to: 

 

a. facilitate the completion of PAPs within the periods provided under existing 
laws and regulations in order to fully utilize and improve the Department’s 

spending rate in terms of disbursement of allotments received and avoid any 

adverse effect on future budget levels of the agency; 

 

b. immediately address the perennial factors impeding project implementation 
through a written plan,  such as bidding process and contractor selection and 

performance monitoring, improvements in preliminary and detailed 

engineering, project monitoring and evaluation system, conduct of early 

procurement activities as sanctioned by law and guidelines, more efficient 

system of downloading funds to the CHDs and other operating units, 

partnerships and coordination with the DOH on project/program 

implementation as well as organizational strengthening  especially with respect 

to project management offices with the end view of rationalizing or 

standardizing their sizes either in terms of number, components or total costs 

of projects/programs handled; and 

 

c. coordinate with the various operating units, procurement partners, and 
implementing agencies, in the form of written communications and series of 

meetings (with copies/minutes furnished to the COA Office), on the following 

matters: (i) possible reforms that will improve budget determination and 

programming;  (ii) linkage between fiscal framework and budget preparation 

so that funds will be available for use by the operating units, procurement 

partners, and/or implementing agencies, and released on time; (iii) need to 

institutionalize monitoring of fund utilization and the use of information 

derived from DBM’s system of annual agency budget review; and (iv) greater 

flexibility in the provision of technical assistance in project 

preparation/planning, design and management, installation of incentive 

system in project management offices for early or on schedule completion of 

projects and sanctions for delays if delays are caused by inefficiencies.

6. The non-obligation of some ₱306,734,289.77 worth of public funds allotted for 
DRRM and during the state of calamity/national emergency in CY 2020 demonstrates 

that not enough programs and projects were implemented in order to mitigate related 

risks and alleviate the people’s condition faster to recovery. 

 

We recommended and the SOH agreed to: (a) facilitate the completion of PAPs 

within the periods provided under RA No. 11520, Section 3.4 of DBM National 

Budget Circular (NBC) No. 585 and related laws and regulations in order to fully 

utilize and improve the DOH’s spending rate in terms of disbursement of 

allotments received and avoid any adverse effect on future budget levels of the 

agency; (b) immediately address the perennial factors impeding project 

implementation through a written plan; (c) coordinate with the various operating 

units, procurement partners, and implementing agencies, in the form of written 

communications and series of meetings (with copies/minutes furnished to the 

COA Office), on the downloading of funds, PAPs implementation and 

preparation/submission of the FURs and other required reports; and (d) direct 

the HEMB to monitor the movement and balances of the DRRM commodities 

and current allotment, obligation and disbursements which may be used in 

making informed decisions for the formulation of reasonable WFP and PPMP. 

 

7. The utilization of at least 25 percent allocated hospital income of four OUs totaling 
₱169,578,991.42 for the procurement of equipment and upgrading of hospital facilities 

had not been fully maximized, with only 37.43 percent or ₱63,467,670.77 utilized, 

while one OU had allocated only ₱4,102,375.65 or 3.54 percent of its hospital income 

of ₱116,037,875.84, thus, denying the intended beneficiaries of quality health care 

services that could have been provided to them had the required percentage of said 

income been properly allocated, and plans for the efficient utilization thereof were 

formulated and implemented. 

 

We recommended and the SOH agreed to direct the heads of concerned OUs to: 

(a) plan carefully through proper and complete identification of all 

equipment/facilities needed by the hospitals to deliver quality health care services 

to intended patients and prioritize the utilization of the allocated hospital income; 

(b) require the submission of explanation/justification on the deficiencies noted, 

evaluate the same and impose appropriate sanctions to concerned 

officials/employees; and (c) henceforth, ensure that at least 25 percent of the 

hospital income is allocated for the procurement of necessary equipment and 

upgrading of hospital facilities to provide the intended patients with access to 

better health care services. 

 

8. Unauthorized and unnecessary balances in depository accounts as well as fees and 
other receipts or revenues collected totaling ₱441,239,379.94 remained unremitted to 

the National Treasury contrary to law and regulations. 

 



x 

We recommended and the SOH agreed to direct the concerned OUs to cause the 

immediate transfer/remittance of their unauthorized/unnecessary cash balances 

and collected fees to the BTr in compliance with law and regulations. 

 

9. Procedural deficiencies in the procurement process and lack of documentation in 
various contracts entered into and implemented by the DOH as well as lapses in 

implementation of its various projects in the aggregate amount of at least 

₱3,967,249,291.33, were not in keeping with pertinent provisions of RA No. 9184 and 

its RIRR, thus, deprived the government of the most advantageous prices and resulted 

in doubtful payment transactions and significant delays in project completion. 

 

We recommended and the SOH agreed to direct the CO and OUs to: (a) 

henceforth, strictly comply with the requirements of RA No. 9184 and pertinent 

laws, rules and regulations, particularly on the conduct of public bidding and 

other procurement activities and on the preparation and submission of required 

documents; (b) submit explanation/justification on the various deficiencies noted, 

evaluate the same and take appropriate actions; (c) conduct periodic assessment 

of processes and procedures to streamline procurement activities pursuant to 

Section 3(c) of this 2016 Revised IRR; and (d) consider the imposition of proper 

liquidated damages on delayed delivery and/or completion of procured goods, 

services and infrastructure projects to encourage faithful adherence and timely 

execution of contracts. 
 

10. Disbursements of various DOH OUs in the total amount of ₱557,699,748.22 did not 
comply with established rules, procedural guidelines, policies, principles or practices, 

resulting in the incurrence of irregular, unnecessary, and excessive expenditures.  

 

We recommended and the SOH agreed to direct the OUs to comply fully with 

established rules, regulations, procedural guidelines, policies, principles or 

practices and avoid IUEEU expenditures to prevent disallowance in audit.
