On July 1, 1976, the AFPCES was formally organized as an AFP-Wide Support and Separate Unit of the AFP pursuant to General Order No. 920 dated July 13, 1976.

D)	Independent Auditor’s Report 



The auditor rendered an unmodified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the financial statements (FS) of AFPCES as of December 31, 2020. The Matrix on the Effects of the Misstatements on the Financial Statements is shown in Annex A.



E)	Summary of Observations and Recommendations 



1)	The accuracy of the Merchandise Inventory and Cost of Sales account balances totaling ₱604,357,159.33 and ₱2,386,208,820.65, respectively, was adversely affected by the following: a) unfinished cost write-down and disposal of expired/contaminated items; b) consistent disparities of ending inventory cost per Retail Method formula as against results of actual physical count; and c) internal control weaknesses over inventory management. (Observation 1)

We  recommended that   Management: (a)	hasten the completion of ongoing investigations so that disposal of items can be completed;  (b) consider prompt assessment of AFPCES’ operations particularly those relative to sales and inventory management which are the core segments of its business and on the basis of assessment results, undertake pre-procurement activities to update/acquire an automated system that will address its operational requirements given its limitations on manpower; and  (c)	ensure that a strategy to preserve all CES business information is in place prior to the installation and commissioning of the automated system.  This will serve as backup data storage in case the initial stages of system utilization manifest glitches or malfunctions.

	

2)	The accuracy of the Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) account balance of ₱77,404,063.58 was adversely affected by the following: a) non-disposal of prior year’s unserviceable properties; and b) non-recording of three serviceable motor vehicles. (Observation 2)

 We recommended that Management:  (a) implement disposal procedures for PPE items that have been identified to be unserviceable to avoid its further deterioration; and (b) should source documents for the acquisition of the three vehicles remain unobtainable during the next calendar year, consider said vehicles as “Found at Station” and have it recorded in the Accounting and Property units by assigning conservative costs.



3)	Steps were not taken to process ₱60,762,971.35 total dormant receivables for possible application for write-off in accordance with COA Circular 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016. (Observation 3)



We recommended and Management agreed to consider forming a temporary group that would focus on updating, verifying and collecting information about individuals or entities with outstanding accounts to determine conclusively the collectability thereof.  Data gathered may then be used as basis in complying with the requirements on requests for write-off pursuant to COA Circular No. 2016-005.



4)	The propriety and validity of expenditures totaling ₱515,884.35 could not be ascertained due to the absence of supporting documents to substantiate its official nature.  Noted deficiencies are: a) expenses not supported by ORs;b) absence of Inspection and Acceptance Reports (IARs) for purchases of motor parts/supplies for repairs and maintenance expenses for vehicles; c) expenses for local travels not supported with approved Itinerary of Travel; and d) expenses exceeding P300.00 inappropriately supported by Certification of Expenses Not Requiring Receipts (CENRR). (Observation 4)

 	

We recommended that Management (a) implement strict compliance with COA Circular No. 2012-001 on the submission of mandatory supporting documents for official expenditures and refrain from processing replenishments that are inadequately supported; b) require submission of IARs to support repairs and maintenance expenses of official vehicles in accordance with Appendix 62 of the GAM Volume II; c) require employees who are on official travel outside of Metro Manila to accomplish the Itinerary of Travel in compliance to COA Cir 2012-001;  and d) advise AOs not to honor the CENRR as a valid liquidation supporting document for expenses exceeding ₱300.00.



5)	Employees accountable for the custody of Inventories Held for Sale at several AFPCES outlet warehouses were not bonded contrary to Section 101 of PD 1445 and Treasury Circular No. 02-2009.



We recommended that Management secure fidelity bonds of warehousemen in charge of safekeeping inventories in the outlets in accordance with BTr Circular 02-2009 dated August 6, 2009.



6)	The Retailware Manager System (RMS), also known as Report of Deliveries Received (RDR) computerized system, failed to generate the status report of returned merchandise at the Camp Servillano Aquino and Camp O’Donnell outlets in Tarlac City and Capas, respectively, both in Tarlac Province.



	We recommended that the Managers of outlets located at Camps Servillano Aquino and O’Donnell immediately make written representations with the AFPCES Headquarters to report limitations affecting their automated systems.  In the meantime, said branches must be advised to formulate measures to compensate for the failure of the RMS to provide purchase returns data.

	

7)	Management failed to submit financial and mandatory reports, advance copies of purchase orders and notification of scheduled deliveries of purchased items to the Office of the Auditor within the prescribed period, contrary to the provisions of PD No. 1445 and the Rules and Regulations on Settlement of Accounts (RRSA). 

	

	We recommended that Management comply with deadlines set for the submission of financial reports, disbursement records, liquidation reports, Journal Entry Vouchers, Daily Sales and Remittance Reports and other reportorial requirements to the Office of the Auditor. 

	

8)	The designated division heads and AOs of several AFPCES outlets do not hold permanent positions contrary to Sections 4.1.4 and 4.1.5 of COA Circular No. 97-002; and Section 7.2 of CSC, COA and DBM Joint Circular No. 1, s. 2017. 

	

	We reiterated our previous audit recommendation that Management elevate this concern to General Headquarters officials so that appropriate measures be initiated to address this issue.

	

	

	The foregoing observations and recommendations were discussed with concerned officials last April 7, 2021.  Management’s replies were considered in this Report, where appropriate.



	Other audit observations and recommendations noted are discussed in detail in Part II of this Report.



F)	Status of Settlement of Audit Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges



	The AFPCES has no suspensions, disallowances and charges as of December 31, 2020.  





G)	Status of Implementation of Prior Years’ Audit Recommendations



	Out of the 31 prior years’ audit recommendations, 13 were implemented while 18 were not implemented, of which 12 were reiterated in Part II of this report.
