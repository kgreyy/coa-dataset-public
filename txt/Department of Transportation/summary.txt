EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 
 
 

Introduction 
 

 
The Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC), DOTr’s predecessor, 

was created by virtue of Executive Order (EO) No. 546, series of 1979, which converted 
the then Ministry of Public 
Works, Transportation and 
Communications 
(MPWTC) into two 
ministries, namely, the 
MOTC and the Ministry of 
Public Works and 
Highways (MPWH). The 
MOTC was reorganized, 
both structurally and 
functionally, and was 
renamed as Department of 
Transportation and 
Communications (DOTC) 
pursuant to EO No. 125 
dated January 30, 1987, as amended by EO No. 125-A dated April 13, 1987, which was 
issued to give further impetus to the declared policy of the State towards the maintenance 
and expansion of viable, efficient and dependable transportation and communication 
system as effective instruments for the Department’s objectives. Following the passage in 
2016 of Republic Act (RA) No. 10844, otherwise known as the Department of 
Information and Communications Technology Act of 2015, DOTC was renamed as the 
Department of Transportation (DOTr) and its functions and responsibilities dealing with 
communications were transferred to the newly formed Department of Information 
Communications and Technology (DICT). 
 
       The DOTr is the primary policy, planning, programming, coordinating, and 
implementing, regulating and administrative entity of the government in the promotion, 
development and regulation of dependable and coordinated networks of transportation 
systems.  
 
       The DOTr is headed by Secretary Arthur P. Tugade who is assisted by six 
Undersecretaries and twelve Assistant Secretaries which include the Head of the Land 
Transportation Office (LTO), and the Chairman and Members of the Land Transportation 
Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB).

       The DOTr has direct line supervision and control over two Regional Offices, namely, 
Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR) and CARAGA Administrative Region (Region 
XIII). CAR was established by virtue of EO No. 220 dated July 15, 1987, while 
CARAGA Administrative Region was established pursuant to RA No. 7901.  In June 
2019, by virtue of DOTr Department Order No. 2018-003, separate regional offices for 
the LTO and LTFRB were established both in CAR and CARAGA Administrative 
Region, with each office headed by a Regional Director. The DOTr also has jurisdiction 
over two sectoral agencies, namely, LTO and LTFRB. As at December 31, 2020, the 
DOTr and its attached agencies has a total personnel complement of 7,863 inclusive of 
the regional offices.

 VII 

 

The negative variances as shown in the foregoing table were due to the following: 
 

 Rail Transport Services 
 

 Decrease in number of operational 
trains for Metro Rail Transit (MRT)3 due to 
ongoing rehabilitation of the system; 

 
 Imposition of social distancing 

measures due to Corona Virus Disease 2019 
(COVID-19) pandemic; and 

 
 Reduced demand due to community quarantines, closing of 

establishments, remote school and Work from Home (WFH) setup implemented. 
 

 Air and Water Transport Facilities and Services 
 

 Development and improvement of Airport were 
affected due to funding reallocation to cover the 
requirement in addressing COVID-19 pandemic. 
Allocation for 10 Airport projects under the CY 2020 
GAA were offered to cover funding requirement to 
address COVID-19; 

 
 Sudden decrease in passenger/cargo traffic is due 
to the closure of airport brought by the COVID-19 
pandemic; and 

 

 No data for Volcano Island Port and 
Caticlan Port due to the recent Taal Volcano 
eruption and pandemic, respectively. 

 
 Road Transport Services 

 
 The decrease in percentage of accomplishment 
was attributed to the implementation of nationwide 

Enhanced Community Quantity (ECQ) from March 16 
to May 15, 2020 and of Modified Enhanced 
Community Quarantine (MECQ) and General 

Community Quarantine (GCQ) in Metro Manila and 
other areas in the succeeding months due to COVID-
19 Pandemic; and 

 
 Extension of implementation of Public Utility Vehicle 

Modernization (PUVMP) from June 30, 2020 to December 31, 
2020 under MC No. 2020-027.

E. 

Scope of Audit 
 

The audit covered the accounts and operations of DOTr for the year ended December 
31, 2020. The objectives of the audit were to (a) verify the level of assurance that may be 
placed on Management’s assertions on the consolidated financial statements;                  
(b) determine the propriety of transactions as well as the extent of compliance with 
applicable laws, rules and regulations; (c) recommend agency improvement 
opportunities; and (d) determine the extent of implementation of prior years’ audit 
recommendations. 
 

The Consolidated Financial Statements (FS) as at December 31, 2020 consist of the 
FS of the Office of the Secretary, CAR, CARAGA, LTO and LTFRB for all funds, 
including MVUC. 

 
 

Independent Auditor’s Report 
 

As discussed in Part II of this report, the Auditor 
rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of 
presentation of the consolidated financial statements of 
the DOTr due to accounting errors and omissions found 
in nine accounts amounting to P13,480,638,745.43. 

 
Enumerated below are the errors, omissions and 

accounting deficiencies which, among others, bear the 
greatest significant impact on the account balances in the 
financial statements of the DOTr: 
 
1. The Cash and Cash Equivalents account was misstated by P19,520,224.53 as at 

year-end due to unrecorded collections from online payment transactions and 
proceeds from the auction of impounded motor vehicles, undeposited collections and 
uncorrected prior year’s errors. 
 

2. The Receivable account was misstated by P242,890,149.03 due to (i) unrecorded 
liquidations/adjustments of various Implementing Agencies corresponding to a net 
overstatement on the account by P2,336,946,764.75; (ii) improper recording of 
liquidations with Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) component, thereby 
understating the account by P2,182,106,935.72; (iii) erroneous classification of 
claims against relieved/dismissed Collecting Officers which understated the account 
by P4,129,986.97; and (iv) non-recognition of impairment for impaired receivables, 
thus overstating the account by P92,180,306.97. 
 

3. The Inventory account was misstated by P424,369,650.82 due to (i) non-
derecognition of obsolete inventories and damaged/rejected inventory items resulting 
to the overstatement of the account by P18,030,662.64; (ii) inconsistent accounting 



  

 IX 

 

treatment of Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID), thereby understating the 
account by P8,150,000.00; and (iii) recording errors (unrecorded receipts, issuances, 
double recording and erroneous costing) which overstated the account by 
P414,488,988.18. These are departures from IPSAS 12. 
 

4. The sub-accounts under the Deposits account was misstated by P498,977,406.00 due 
to improper recording to the Guaranty Deposit account of deposits to different 
Regional Trial Courts (RTCs) in favour of the landowners of affected properties in 
connection with the implementation of the Metro Manila Subway Project (MMSP) 
Phase 1 project instead of Other Deposits account. 
 

5. The PPE account was misstated by P10,437,733,087.86 due to (i) completed projects 
not yet transferred to entities having control over the assets, thereby overstating the 
account by P10,419,357,926.21; (ii) unrecorded intra-agency transfers which 
understated the account by P82,947,873.25; (iii) erroneous recording of transactions 
resulting to overstatement of Construction in Progress (CIP) account by 
P78,875,403.96; (iv) non-recognition of impairment losses on unserviceable PPE, 
thus overstating the account by P22,447,630.94; and (v) non-reclassification of 
completed projects to appropriate PPE accounts. The noted deficiencies are 
departures from IPSAS 17. 
 

6. The Accounts Payable account was misstated by P2,837,389.39 due to (i) 
unrecorded purchases already delivered and services rendered as at year-end, thereby 
understating the account by P4,424,421.21; and (ii) recognition of liability without 
sufficient and appropriate documentation which has been outstanding for more than 
two years resulting to the overstatement of the account by P1,587,031.82. 
 

7. Various Expense accounts were misstated by P2,353,288,243.80  due to net 
overstatement on Financial Assistance/Subsidy to NGAs, LGUs, GOCCs of 
P1,206,528,273.43 caused by (i) improper recording of liquidations of fund transfers 
which understated the said account by P14,631,141.76, and (ii) erroneous use of 
Assistance to Other National Government Agencies account to record transfers of 
completed projects made to Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP), 
which overstated the same account by P1,191,897,131.67; net understatement on 
Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses by P1,067,989,579.44 caused by (i) 
erroneous recording of recoupment of advance payment for the procurement of 
supervision consultant for the MRT Line 3 Rehabilitation Project which overstated 
the account by P5,085,764.48, and (ii) non-compliance with accrual basis of 
accounting which understated the account by P1,073,075,343.92; and understatement 
on Non-cash Expenses by P78,770,390.93 caused by erroneous computation of 
Depreciation Expenses.

F. Other Significant Observations and    
Recommendations 
 

Hereunder are the other significant audit observations noted during the year and the 
corresponding recommendations that are discussed in detail in Part II of this Report. 

 
1. The DOTr obligated P98,247,219,704.41 or 

96.03% of the total allotments of 
P102,312,022,626.65 received in CY 2020 
and disbursed P27,967,647,276.63 or 
28.47% of the total obligations. The 
undisbursed amount of P70,279,572,427.77 
pertains primarily to the fund for the 
payment of Right-of-Way (ROW) and for 
the implementation of 56 out of 81 locally 
and foreign-assisted projects with low 
disbursement rates ranging only from zero 
to 20% of the obligations. Moreover, of the 
total Notice of Cash Allocations (NCAs) 
received amounting to P56,381,678,557.01, 
only P54,561,845,196.71 or 96.77% was 
utilized as at December 31, 2020 resulting 
in the reversion to the Bureau of the 
Treasury (BTr) of P1,819,833,360.30 or 
3.23% thereof. (Observation No. 3) 
 
We recommended that Management: 

 
a. closely coordinate with the Department 

of Budget and Management (DBM) for 
the timely release of SARO for the 
implementation of ROW activities; 

 
b. endeavor to fully utilize the allotments 

received for timely implementation of programs and projects for public use, thus 
improve the quality of service to be rendered to the general public; and 

 
2. A total of four projects which were terminated by the DOTr from CY 2015 to CY 

2019 with total contract cost of P76,470,882.00 have no continuity or progression 
plan for its further implementation, thereby depriving the public of the optimum use  
of these projects. Moreover, two completed projects with aggregate contract cost of 
P502,583,653.82 remained idle and not utilized since its completion, thereby 
exposing these projects to further deterioration, decline in value by reason of 
technological obsolescence and risk of pecuniary loss to the Government. 
(Observation No. 4) 



  

 XI 

 

In view of the foregoing, we reiterated the following prior year’s recommendations 
that Management:   
 
a. provide the Audit Team with a continuity or back up plans for the noted 

terminated projects; 
 
b. explore various options to 

utilize the substantially 
completed New MACC 
Phase 1 and 2 to ensure that 
objectives are met and 
public resources are 
judiciously utilized to 
prevent further loss to the 
government by reason of 
technological obsolescence; 
and 
 

c. ensure that the application of 
advances as compensatory payment to works performed by the contractor is 
justified and authorized and exhaust all remedies to recover any outstanding 
and/or remaining advances made to the contractor. 
 

3. A total of  7,347 pieces or 
20.41% of the total concrete 
barriers procured for the EDSA 
Bus Way Project with an 
equivalent value of 
P31,592,100.00 remained 
uninstalled/undeployed due to: 
(a) replacement of at least 3,243 
pieces of barrier by steel and/or 
metal bollards in flyovers and 
underpasses; and (b) construction 
of needed concourses, structures 
and other structures along EDSA 
prior installation/deployment of barriers,  thereby limiting its potential use not only 
to maintain orderliness and ensure the safety and security of commuters using the 
EDSA Busway but also to mitigate traffic congestion. (Observation No. 5) 
 
We recommended that Management of the DOTr-MRT3 in coordination with the 
MMDA, provide installation and/or deployment plan indicating the specific areas 
and/or locations to which these remaining concrete barriers will be installed and/or 
deployed to ensure maximum utilization thereof.  
 



  

 XII 

 

Likewise, we recommended that Management closely coordinate with partner 
agencies and entities to ensure timely construction and completion of required 
concourses, structures and other developments not only to facilitate installation 
and/or deployment of the remaining uninstalled concrete barriers but primarily to 
achieve the very objective for the procurement thereof. 
 

4. Various issues/setbacks were encountered in the implementation of 15 DOTr-
Foreign Assisted Projects (FAPs) in CY 2020 with an aggregate cost of 
P1,312,605,770,000.00,   thus, resulted in prolonged/extended project 
implementation period and/or further project delays, possible change in total project 
cost and slippages or low/no actual physical accomplishments of the projects which 
consequently will require project restructuring. The overall causes of delays in the 
project implementation 
also resulted in the 
incurrence and 
payment of additional 
commitment fees for 
the seven FAPs per 
BTr report amounting 
to P158,223,997.87 in 
CY 2020. 
(Observation No. 6) 
 
We recommended that 
Management:  
 
a. directly/closely monitor the execution of the action plans set to address the 

issues/setbacks and delays identified on each FAP to ensure smooth and timely 
implementation of projects and to avoid further delays;  

 
b. require the 

concerned Project 
Management 
Offices (PMOs) 
to (i) review and 
validate the data/ 
information 
contained in the 
National 
Economic and 
Development 
Authority 
(NEDA) Draft 
CY 2020 Official Development Assistance (ODA) Portfolio Review of the 
DOTr; and (ii) submit to the Audit Team the updated/revised FAPs Physical 
Status Report as at December 31, 2020, including the updates/status on the 



  

 XIII 

 

measures undertaken to address the issues/setbacks and delays on the project’s 
implementation; and (iii) regularly provide NEDA-Monitoring and Evaluation 
Staff (MES) and COA Audit Team with complete quarterly/periodic status 
reports of the FAPs;  

   
c. require all stakeholders such as the approving authorities, PMOs, and others 

involved in the procurement and implementation phase to exert best efforts to 
minimize delays and maximize loan proceeds availment during the loan validity 
period thereby minimizing incurrence of commitment fees; and 

 
d. fast-track preparation of ICC requisite documents for the approval of the DOTr’s 

requests for project restructuring in CY 2021.  
 

5. Various PPE costing P120,001,519.66 and P20,521,978.09 relative to the DOTr 
Road Transportation Information Technology Infrastructure Project and Driver’s 
License Cards with Five-Year Validity, respectively, were either undeployed, 
uninstalled or unutilized, thus, resulted in the inefficient implementation of the 
projects. (Observation No. 7) 
 
We recommended that Management: 
 
a.  direct the Management Information Division (MID) of LTO-SHO to coordinate 

with the Equipment Unit to ensure deployment and utilization of equipment and 
devices procured to avoid wastage of government funds;  
 

b.  direct LTO-XII to conduct assessment on the possible reasons/causes or delay for 
the non-utilization of the ICT and Communication equipment and  fast track the 
full implementation on the utilization of the said properties in order to achieve 
the agency’s program and prevent equipment obsolescence and wastage of public 
funds; 
 

c.  utilize and deploy the fingerprint scanner (ZF2) and other idle peripherals to 
efficiently implement the project and effectively execute its mandate; and 

 
d.  instruct Drivers’ License Renewal Offices (DLROs) to return the laser engravers 

and peripherals to the Property Section and the latter in coordination with MID to 
issue and utilize returned and undeployed laser engravers. 

 
6. Approval of extension orders for the DOTr Road Transportation IT Infrastructure 

Project - LTO Component A with a contract amount of P3,190,020,094.08 without 
proof of due diligence, and acceptance of customized core applications even with 
unresolved defects and implementation thereof to the non-pilot sites caused undue 
payments to the vendor which is disadvantageous to the government and delayed 
processing of transactions causing unnecessary burdens to its clients, respectively. 
(Observation No. 8) 
 



  

 XIV 

 

We recommended that Management: 
 
a. monitor and ensure implementation of the project in accordance with the 

provisions of the contract and the applicable laws, rules and regulations; 
 
b. consider stopping the implementation of the core applications to non-pilot sites 

until all core 
applications 
are accepted 
and integrated 
to one 
another, and 
the Land 
Transportation 
Management 
System 
(LTMS) is 
functioning 
seamlessly; 

 
c. fast-track the connectivity of unconnected Medical IT Providers, and submit 

Management actions on non-compliance with LTO Memorandum Circular No. 
2018-2157 by the 12 medical clinics directly connected with the LTMS; 

 
d. instruct the Acceptance Committee and Project Management Committee to 

check the receipt dates in the penalty computation and support it with 
appropriate documents as basis for the computation of liquidated damages; and 

 
e. stop extending and changing dates of deliveries of items and activities in favor 

of the vendor without a valid and justifiable reason. 
 

7. The LTO Disposal Committee of SHO, Regional Office Nos. I, IV-A and X were not 
able to dispose 2,595 units of Impounded Motor Vehicle (IMV) stored in their 
respective compound/premises which are presumed to have been unreasonably and 
actually abandoned by their owners for failure to pay the necessary and required 
fines and penalties. The non-disposal of these motor vehicles despite the lapse of the 
six-month period from the date of its apprehension has prevented the agency from 
earning more revenues and from clearing the premises to provide additional space for 
vehicle storage. (Observation No. 9) 
 
We reiterated our previous recommendations that Management: 
 
a. fast track the disposal of the IMVs in accordance with the provisions of PD No. 

1729 to prevent further deterioration and loss of economic value, free its 
premises with adequate space needed for future storage, generate additional 
income and prevent incurrence of additional expenditures; and  



  

 XV 

 

 
b. instruct the concerned personnel of LTO-SHO to disseminate the approved 

uniform guidelines on the disposal of unclaimed Impounded MVs/MCs to the 
concerned regional offices. 

 
8. Various circumstances caused delays in the procurement of plates, thus, resulted in 

the undelivered license plates of the registrants nationwide from CY 2014 to CY 
2020 amounting to P2,159,036,340.00 corresponding to 8,120,837 pieces of 
Motorcycle (MC) and 2,632,302 pairs of replacement Motor Vehicle (MV) license 
plates. Further, the undelivered replacement plates indicated lapses in the 
performance by the LTO Management of one of its mandates, thus, depriving the 
registrants of their right to receive the plates they have paid for and affecting the 
efficient apprehension of the traffic violators. (Observation No. 10) 

 
We recommended that Management fast track the production of the backlog in MC 
plates and replacement MV plates from the existing contracts and subsequently issue 
the same to the respective registrants nationwide. 

 
9. The erroneous computation of the undelivered license plates for the amended 

contract of the Motor Vehicle License Plates Standardization Program resulted in the 
overstatement of the remaining requirements thereby exceeding the original contract 
price by P46,824,310.00. (Observation No. 11) 
 
We recommended that Management consider amending the schedule of requirements 
to correct the computation of the remaining deliverables so as not to exceed from the 
original contract price of P3.186 billion. 
 

10. The reported balances of Advances to Contractors account amounting to 
P1,086,551,678.23 as at year-end included unrecouped advances to contractors from 
terminated/rescinded projects and projects with inadequate information and/or 
documentation totaling P278,871,316.04 or 25.67% of the account balance, contrary 
to item 4.3 of Annex “E” of the Revised IRR of RA No. 9184, which may cause loss 
of government funds if these advance payments will not be recovered from 
contractors concerned. (Observation No. 12) 
 
We recommended to Management the following courses of action: 
 
a. consider the creation of a Committee who will be responsible for the following: 

(i) inventory and collection of money value of forfeiture of surety bonds;          
(ii) retrieval, review and verification of documents particularly those advances to 
contractors with inadequate information and documentation; and (iii) eventually, 
issuance of demand letters and/or legal remedies, if warranted, to recover 
outstanding advances made to concerned contractors; and  
 

b. closely monitor the status of project implementation and corresponding 
payments made to concerned contractors to ensure that advances made are 



  

 XVI 

 

recouped pursuant to item 4.3 of Annex “E” of the Revised IRR of RA No. 
9184. For completed projects with outstanding advances, apply the unbilled final 
billings of contractors from completed projects to any of their outstanding 
advances in order to recoup the full amount. 

 
11. Fund transfers to various government agencies for the implementation of programs 

and projects aggregating P19,576,219,559.76 remained unliquidated in the books for 
1 to 39 years contrary to item 4.6 of COA Circular No. 94-013, thereby resulting in 
the accumulation of long outstanding Inter-Agency Receivables. (Observation No. 
13) 
 
We recommended to the DOTr-OSEC Management the following courses of action: 
 
a. instruct the Accountant of MRT-3 to closely coordinate with the PS-DBM on the 

liquidation of fund transfers for various purchases for the DOTr-MRT3;  
 
b. demand liquidation and refund of unused funds for fund transfers with 

completed projects;  
 
c. closely coordinate with the PMO on the status of implementation of 

programs/projects to facilitate the proper recording of liquidations of fund 
transfers in the books of accounts; and 

 
d. consider to request authority to write-off dormant outstanding inter-agency 

receivables in accordance with COA Circular No. 2016-005. 
 

12. Several deficiencies were noted in the Right-of-Way (ROW) acquisition, particularly 
on the payments of claims and incidental expenses, contrary to existing laws, rules 
and regulations and exposes the Department to the risk of possible adverse claims to 
the disadvantage of the government. (Observation No. 14) 
 
We recommended that Management of the DOTr-OSEC: 
 
a. refrain from allowing Attorney-in-Fact as payee of the checks representing 

payment of the ROW claims so as not to expose the Department to the risk of 
possible adverse claims to the disadvantage of the government; 

 
b. submit proof and/or any document showing that the Special Power of Attorney 

(SPA) was registered with the Registry of Deeds of the province or city where 
the land lies pursuant to Section 64 of PD No. 1529; 

 
c. strictly adhere to Section 5 of RA No. 10752, in any case, incidental expenses 

such as CGT, DST, transfer tax and registration fees must be paid by the 
IA/DOTr directly to the BIR or Office of the LGU where the land lies;  
 



  

 XVII 

 

d. closely coordinate with the AIF to follow-up the status of the transfer of the 
three lots that remained not transferred in the name of the Republic of the 
Philippines; and  

e. henceforth, comply with Section 6.2 of the IRR of the RA No. 10752 to ensure 
that appropriate price offer is obtained for its ROW acquisition. 

 
13. Delayed and/or non-submission of financial and budgetary reports precluded the 

prompt audit of the accounts and financial transactions impeding early detection and 
correction of errors/deficiencies and timely reporting of the audit results to 
Management contrary to various issuances of COA and pertinent provisions of the 
Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies 
(NGAs). Moreover, audit disclosed disbursements totaling P223,684,266.37 were not 
supported with complete documentation. (Observation No. 15) 
 
We recommended that Management of concerned DOTr and LTO offices: 
 
a. require all concerned agency officials/personnel to comply strictly with the 

timelines in the submission of financial reports and other documents set forth in 
the above mentioned COA issuances and GAM provisions to ensure timely 
delivery of our audit outputs; 

 
b. develop and implement adequate measures that will enable the officials 

concerned to religiously comply within the set timelines/due dates of submission 
of the required reports and documents; 

 
c. follow up the status of its application for enrollment to weAccess banking 

facility of LBP for the aforesaid two bank accounts and request for the 
immediate approval thereof in order to facilitate the timely preparation and 
submission of the required Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS);  
 

d. consider enrolling all their bank accounts in online banking facility of the 
depository bank to facilitate timely preparation and submission of BRS; 
 

e. submit the BRS and Analysis Statements of various bank accounts listed in 
Table 74 once reconciliation and analysis are completed; and 

 
f. cause the immediate submission of the lacking documents in compliance with 

DBM Budget Circular No. 2020-1 and COA Circular Nos. 2012-001 and 96-
004. Likewise, instruct the respective Accountants to refrain from processing 
claims and/or payments to internal and external creditors unless the submission 
of required supporting documents have been complied with. 
 

14. Several approved Contract Agreements and Memoranda of Agreement involving 
total amounts of P19,764,179,830.59 and P3,074,743,973.38, respectively, were 
submitted late, in violation of item 3.1.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-001. Further, 
submitted contracts lacked documentary requirements as set forth under item 8 of the 



  

 XVIII 

 

COA Circular No. 2012-001, thereby, hindered the effective and complete review of 
transactions. (Observation No. 16) 
 
We recommended that the respective BAC Secretariat Division of the DOTr-OSEC 
and concerned LTO offices: 
 
a. comply with the timely submission of Contracts Agreements/MOA and its 

supporting documents pursuant to COA Circular No. 2009-001; and 
 
b. submit the documentary requirements listed in the attached Appendix 3 in order 

to facilitate the timely and complete review and evaluation of the subject 
contracts. 

 
15. The DOTr-CAR contracted the services of Job Order workers without first obtaining 

the approval of the Undersecretary of Administrative Service or equivalent office 
contrary to DOTr DO No. 2019-004, resulting in irregular expenditures on the 
payment of salaries/wages amounting to at least P6,522,694.56. (Observation No. 
17) 
 
We recommended that Management of the DOTr-CAR obtain post-facto approval of 
the service contracts entered into by the Regional Office with the Job Order 
employees from the Office of the Undersecretary of Administrative Service or 
equivalent office, and also acquire the required authority for the contracts which 
have yet to be executed. 
 

16. Deviations from certain provisions of RA No. 9184 and its Revised IRR were noted, 
thus, defeating the very purpose of prescribing the necessary rules and regulations 
for the modernization and standardization of the procurement activities of the 
government. (Observation No. 18) 
 
We recommended that Management of the respective DOTr offices strictly adhere to 
the provisions of RA No. 9184 and its Revised IRR in all stages of procurement of 
infrastructures, goods and services to uphold transparency, efficiency and economy 
in the procurement process. 
 

17. Control gaps and/or improvement opportunities were noted in the Gender and 
Development (GAD) planning, budgeting and implementation of the GAD programs, 
projects and activities (PPAs) of the DOTr, thereby, contrary to existing laws, rules 
and regulations on GAD and defeated the very purpose of addressing gender issues 
towards gender equality and women’s empowerment. (Observation No. 19) 
 
In view of the foregoing, we recommended the following courses of action:  
 
a. comply with the allocation of at least 5% of its total appropriation as required by 

the Magna Carta of Women (MCW) and the General Appropriations Act 
(GAA); 



  

 XIX 

 

 
b. strictly comply with the requirements of the IRR of RA No. 7192 regarding the 

implementation of the Resource Mobilization for Gender Concerns and 
Women’s Activities of the ODA funds received by the Department from foreign 
government and multi-lateral agencies and organizations, and to properly 
prepare and accomplish the GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) incorporating the 
attributions of budget and programs specifically for FAPs and the related 
Accomplishment Report thereon addressing gender related activities/issues;  

 
c. ensure that GPB along with the Annual GAD Accomplishment Reports (AR) are 

duly approved and endorsed by the Philippine Commission on Women (PCW). 
Likewise, submit approved and endorsed reports to the assigned Audit Team 
pursuant to COA Circular No. 2014-001; 

 
d. closely monitor and consider in the ensuing year the implementation of the 

identified GAD PPAs that were affected by the global pandemic COVID-19 not 
only to maximize the utilization of the allocated budget but primarily to achieve 
the GAD objectives pursuant to Section 31 of RA No. 11465;  

 
e. speed-up the establishment and completion of the GAD database/ Sex-

Disaggregated Data (SDD) with adequate and systematically gathered sex-
disaggregated data which will provide the basis for gender analysis, planning, 
budgeting, programming and policy formulation and undertake gender analysis 
to identify and confirm existing gender issues and ensure that the programs, 
projects and activities are responsive to said issues; and 

 
f. require GAD Focal Point Sytem (GFPS) to undertake regular capacity 

development training on GAD, including gender mainstreaming, gender analysis 
and gender-responsive planning and budgeting, to further their understanding 
and appreciation of GAD and be updated on GAD-related laws and 
commitments. 

 
18. The DOTr was not fully compliant with Section 32 of the General Provisions of RA 

No. 11465 or the GAA of FY 2020, thereby, concerns and needs of Senior Citizens 
(SCs) and Persons with Disabilities (PWDs) were not completely addressed. 
(Observation No. 20) 
 
We recommended that Management of the DOTr offices concerned pursue the 
implementation of identified programs/projects which were put on hold due to the 
COVID-19 global pandemic  and continue the formulation and integration of 
programs/projects in the agency’s regular activities in order to address the concerns 
and/or enhance the mobility, safety and welfare of SCs and PWDs in our 
transportation system. 
 
 



  

 XX 

 

19. The DOTr-OSEC, DOTr-CAR, DOTr-CARAGA, and LTO and LTFRB offices, 
except LTO-NCR, LTO-VI and XII, LTFRB-VI and X, have substantially complied 
with the Insurance of Property, Plant and Equipment pursuant to Section 2 of RA No. 
656. (Observation No. 22) 
 
We recommended that Management direct the designated Supply/Property Custodian 
to insure all its insurable assets with the General Insurance Fund of the GSIS against 
any insurable risk to ensure that the government will be secured or indemnified for 
any damage or loss of properties. 

 
20. The DOTr had not attained optimum use of its P9,500,000,000.00 budgetary 

appropriation under RA No. 11494 “Bayanihan to Recover as One Act” due to 
delays noted in the release of funds to the Implementing Agencies (IAs). Moreover, 
of the total Notice of Cash Allocations (NCAs) received under this Act, 
P9,398,574,014.69 or 98.93% thereof was utilized as at year-end, thereby resulting in 
the reversion to the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) of P101,425,985.31or 1.07%. In 
addition, required liquidation reports were not submitted by the IAs to the DOTr, 
contrary to item 4.6 of COA Circular No. 94-013 and Memoranda of Agreement 
(MOA) with IAs. (Observation No. 24)  

 
We recommended that Management of the DOTr-OSEC: 

 
a. moving forward, ensure the timely completion of all the requirements stipulated 

in the MOA and endeavor to achieve the implementation schedules/timelines set 
for the identified programs/projects of the DOTr through close monitoring and 
coordination with the concerned IAs; 

 
b. timely prepare the MOA and other necessary project documents to avoid 

reversion of NCA so as not to delay the implementation of the identified COVID-
19 programs/projects of the Department; and 

 
c. require the respective IAs to submit liquidation reports in compliance with 

pertinent provisions 
of COA Circular 
No. 94-013 and 
MOA with 
respective IAs. 

 
21. Delays in the 

implementation of the 
Service Contracting 
Program ranging from 
2 to 10 weeks as at 
December 31, 2020 
resulted in the minimal 
fund utilization of only 



  

 XXI 

 

P59,720,089.25 or 1.07% of the total project fund of P5,580,000,000.00, thereby 
delaying the intended benefits to the PUV drivers and operators. Furthermore, only a 
total of 29,871 drivers or 49.79% of the 60,000 targeted driver-participants were 
registered in the Program as at year-end. (Observation No. 25) 
 
We recommended that the LTFRB Management review the guidelines and simplify 
the processes for the implementation of the Service Contracting Program to 
maximize the utilization of the project funds and the participation of qualified PUV 
drivers and to serve the intended benefits expeditiously. 
 

22. Out of the total Direct Cash Subsidy Program Fund of P1,161,214,210.00, only the 
amount of P963,696,500.00 or 82.99% of which was utilized and P839,520,500.00 or 
87.11% thereof was actually 
disbursed, hence, delaying the 
benefits intended for the 
Program beneficiaries. 
(Observation No. 26) 
 
We recommended that the 
LTFRB Management:          
(a) facilitate the immediate 
distribution of the remaining 
cash subsidies to the intended 
beneficiaries before the lapse 
of the Program fund to 
maximize its benefits; and   
(b) require the LBP to immediately return any excess/unutilized fund, including all 
interests earned, if any, to the DOTr once it lapses.  
 

23. Payments for COVID-19 Hazard Pay of P1,771,500.00 to the DOTr-OSEC 
employees were not subjected to applicable withholding taxes, contrary to BIR 
Revenue Regulation No. 11-18. Further, the DOTr-MRT3 has failed to include in the 
contractual agreements warranty clause for the procured supplies in relation to 
COVID-19, contrary to pertinent clauses of GPPB Circular No. 01-2020 and NPM 
No. 003-2020. (Observation No. 27) 

 
We recommended that Management of the DOTr-OSEC require the Chief 
Accountant to withhold applicable taxes on the payments of COVID-19 Hazard Pay 
pursuant to existing BIR Revenue Regulation. 

 
Likewise, we recommended that DOTr-MRT3 Management comply henceforth with 
the guidelines set forth under GPPB Circular No. 01-2020 and NPM No. 003-2020. 
 
In view of the current pandemic, the foregoing observations and recommendations 

were communicated to DOTr Management on June 17, 2021 through the issued 
Summary of Audit Observations and Recommendations (SAOR). Likewise, the results of 



  

 XXII 

 

G. 

H. 

audit of offices/agencies covered in this report, i.e. the DOTr Proper (OSEC, CAR and 
CARAGA) Head/Central and regional offices of LTO and LTFRB, were discussed to the 
Management of the respective offices by the concerned Audit Team on various dates.   

 
The comments on the above observations and recommendations were incorporated in 

this report, where appropriate. 
 

Summary of Total Suspensions, Disallowances and 
Charges  

 
The unsettled suspensions, disallowances and charges as at December 31, 2020 

accumulated to P585,969,040.07, P1,406,089,894.58 and P13,566,942.20 respectively, 
due to Management’s failure to enforce settlement from the persons held liable contrary 
to pertinent provisions of 
COA Circular No. 2009-
006 which prescribes the 
use of the 2009 Rules 
and Regulations on 
Settlement of Accounts 
(RRSA). Moreover, 
suspensions, 
disallowances and 
charges, issued prior to 
the effectivity of the 
RRSA, in the amount of 
P173,412.25, 
P143,101,300.69, and 
P3,669,527.09 
respectively, remained 
unsettled. Details of the 
status of the audit suspensions, disallowances and charges are presented in detail in 
paragraph no. 23 in the Part II of this Report.  

 

 

Status of Implementation of Prior Years’ Audit 
Recommendations 

 
Of the 155 outstanding prior years’ audit recommendations as at January 1, 2020,   

25 were reiterated and/or restated in Part II of this report, 81 were implemented and 49 
were not implemented as at year-end. The details of the implemented and not 
implemented recommendations are presented in detail in Part III of this Report.
