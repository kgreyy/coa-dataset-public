A. FINANCIAL AUDIT 
 

Accounting Errors and Improper Accounting Treatment of Transactions 
 

1. Of the total misstatements of P13,560,483,914.57 found in audit due to 
accounting errors and improper accounting treatment of transactions that are 
considered departure from the International Public Sector Accounting 
Standards (IPSASs), P79,845,169.14 have been adjusted, while 
P13,480,638,745.43 remained uncorrected as at year-end. Hence, based on the 
material impact of the uncorrected misstatements, the reported balances of the 
affected accounts could not be fully relied upon which affect the fair presentation 
of the financial statements of the DOTr as of December 31, 2020. 

 
1.1 Paragraph 27 of IPSAS 1 provides that “Financial Statements shall present fairly the 

financial position, financial performance and cash flows of an entity. Fair 
presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other 
events, and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for 
assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in IPSASs.” 

 
1.2 Moreover, Chapter 2, Section 111 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 provides that 

the accounts of the agency shall be kept in such detail as necessary to meet the needs 
of the agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish the information needed by 
fiscal or control agencies of the government. 

 
1.3 Audit of the DOTr’s consolidated financial statements as at December 31, 2020 

revealed misstatements in nine accounts, details of which are summarized below and 
discussed subsequently in this report. (See Annex B)

97  

a. Unrecorded collections from online payment transactions and proceeds from the 
auction of impounded motor vehicles – P18.981 million 

 
1.5 Paragraph 7 of IPSAS 1 states that each entity shall recognize and present its financial 

transactions under the accrual basis of accounting, under which transactions and other 
events are recognized when they occur (and not only when cash or its equivalent is 
received or paid). Therefore, the transactions and events are recorded in the 
accounting records and recognized in the financial statements of the periods to which 
they relate. 

 
1.6 In LTO-SHO, review and analysis of the CIB-LCCA revealed that the IT Fees under 

the e-Payment scheme of LTO-NCR for the period September to November 2020 
amounting to P18,617,394.38, as well as the adjustments in the collection of IT Fees 
of LTO-CARAGA in September 2017 and January 2019 amounting to P212,814.75, 
were not properly taken up in the books as at year-end due to the late receipt of transfer 
Journal Entry Vouchers (JEVs) from the aforementioned regional offices. As a result, 
CIB-LCCA and Other Payables accounts are understated by P18,830,209.13. 

 
1.7 In LTO-NCR, review, on a test basis, of the relevant financial records disclosed that 

collections and deposits from Land Transportation Management System (LTMS) 
online payment amounting to P78,980.00 were not recognized in the books of 
accounts due to the absence of Abstract of Collections - Payment Channels and List 
of Deposited Collections. Further, it was noted that the subject collections and 
deposits from LTMS online payment were also excluded in the regular submission of 
Monthly Report of Collections and Deposits (MRCD) prepared by the concerned 
Cashiers since these are beyond their control and monitoring. Hence, the Accounting 
Section, under LTO Finance and Management Division (FMD), has no basis in the 
recording of collections and deposits in the books of accounts, thereby, resulted in the 
understatement of the recorded collections and deposits from LTMS online payment 
by P78,980.00. 

 
1.8 In LTO-XII, collections from the sale of bid documents relative to the auctions of 

impounded motor vehicles amounting to P69,500.00 and P48,000.00 in July 2019 and 
December 2020, respectively, were not recorded upon collection. Further, it was 
utilized outright for publication, mailing and meals relative to the said auctions, hence, 
the same were unrecorded. Total related expenses amounted to P6,199.00 and 
P39,086.25 in CYs 2019 and 2020, respectively. The non-recognition of collections 
and related expenses understates Cash-Collecting Officers account, the related 
expenses and Miscellaneous Income accounts as at year-end. 

 
1.9 We recommended that Management instruct the: (a) Accounting Sections of the 

offices concerned to conduct reconciliation on a monthly basis to avoid delay in 
the preparation of transfer JEVs and to ensure that all transfer of IT fees are 
being taken up in the books in the proper period; and (b) Management 
Information Division of LTO-SHO to grant LTMS access to Accounting Section, 



98  

LTO-NCR FMD to facilitate the immediate recording of all collections and 
deposits. 

 
Management Comments: 

 
1.10 The Management of LTO-SHO commented that they have already communicated 

with the Regional Accounting Sections of all regional offices and instructed them to 
conduct monthly reconciliation of all covered payable accounts, to ensure that the 
transfer JEVs and collection of all related fees are properly recorded in the books of 
the LTO-SHO on time. The unrecorded IT fees were recorded under JEV Nos. 101- 
01-008 19 and 101-01-042 dated January 29, 2021 and February 26, 2021, 
respectively. 

 
1.11 The Management of LTO-NCR commented that LTMS viewing facility was installed 

at the FMD in February 2021, however, the date range function is not available to 
consolidate the daily transactions before recording the collections and deposits to the 
books. 

 
1.12 The Management of LTO-XII commented that the collection was already recorded as 

other receipts in JEV No. 21-02-08 in February 2021 and the same was remitted to 
the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) on February 10, 2021. 

 
Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 
1.13 Management’s immediate recognition of the noted unrecorded transactions is 

appreciated but LTO and its regional offices are still encouraged to timely recognize 
transactions at the proper period through the aid of periodic reconciliation. 

 
b. Undeposited collections – P328,662.60 

 
1.14 Section 39 (b), Chapter 5, Volume I of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) 

for National Government Agencies (NGAs) lists the guidelines and supporting 
documents needed in submitting Report of Collections and Deposits (RCD) which 
includes duplicate copies of official receipts and bank validated deposit slips. 

 
1.15 Review of the Cash-Collecting Officer account of LTFRB-X showed that credits to 

the account were made for remittances without bank validated deposit slips in the total 
amount of P328,662.60, hence affected the accuracy and completeness of the recorded 
account in the financial statements and resulted, particularly, in the understatement of 
the Cash-Collecting Officer account by the same amount. 

 
1.16 We recommended that Management of LTFRB-X require the: (a) Accountable 

Officer to submit the bank validated deposit slips, otherwise, refund the total 
undeposited amount of P328,662.60; and (b) Accountant to make the necessary 



99  

adjustments to reflect in the books of accounts the undeposited amount of 
P328,662.60. 

 
c. Uncorrected Prior Years’ Errors – P210,158.05 

 
1.17 Moreover, review of the Cash-Collecting Officer account of LTFRB-VI revealed that 

it included previous years’ uncorrected errors amounting to P210,158.05 which 
affects the reliability of the year-end balance of the account. 

 
1.18 The same were also not disclosed in the Notes to Financial Statements and as such 

mislead the readers and/or users of the financial statements. 
 

1.19 We recommended that Management of LTFRB-VI direct the Accountant to: 
(a) exert more efforts in correcting the previous years’ errors to establish the 
reliable balance of the Cash-Collecting Officer account; and (b) disclose in the 
Notes to Financial Statements relevant information on the account. 

 
 

RECEIVABLES 
 

1.20 The total reported balance of Receivable accounts as at December 31, 2020 is 
misstated by P242,890,149.03 due to errors and omissions as summarized in the 
following table and discussed in the succeeding paragraphs.

a. Unrecorded liquidations/adjustments of various Implementing Agencies (IAs) – 
P2.337 billion 

 
1.21 The RCA (Updated 2019) Volume III of the GAM for NGAs, defines the Due from 

National Government Agencies as an account used to recognize advances for purchase 
of goods/services as authorized by law, fund transfers to the NGAs for implementation 
of projects and other receivables from NGAs. The same account is credited upon 
receipt of goods/services, liquidation of fund transfers, receipt of payment, settlement, 
write-off, and/or adjustments. 

 
1.22 In the DOTr-OSEC, confirmation of the reported balance of the said account disclosed 

unrecorded liquidations of various IAs for CY 2019 in the books in the aggregate sum 
of P2,338,546,916.03, details are as follows: 

 
Particulars Amount (in Php) 

Lapsed/expired funds which was already reverted by the Office of 
Transportation Cooperatives (OTC) to the BTr 

828,469.03 

Second tranche of fuel subsidy given to 113,593 beneficiaries on 
December 26, 2019 under Pantawid Pasada Program (PPP) implemented 
by LTFRB 

2,337,718,447.00 

Total 2,338,546,916.03 
 

1.23 The above noted deficiency resulted in the understatement of the Accumulated 
Surplus (Deficit) and the overstatement of the Due from NGAs accounts by the same 
amounts. 

 
1.24 Moreover, related confirmation of the outstanding unliquidated fund transfer to the 

LTFRB as at year-end disclosed a difference of P1,600,151.28 attributable to the fuel 
subsidies already given to the beneficiaries but reverted back to the LTFRB due to 
incorrect account numbers, thereby, understating the Due from NGAs and overstating 
the Assistance to Other NGAs accounts by the said amount. 

 
1.25 We recommended that Management of the DOTr-OSEC require the Chief 

Accountant to make the necessary adjusting entries to correct the noted errors 



101  

in the recording of liquidations of fund transfers pursuant to Section 17, Chapter 
10 and Annex M, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs. 

 
b. Improper recording of liquidations with PPE component – P2.182 billion 

 
1.26 Meanwhile, Section 17, Chapter 10 and Annex M, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs, 

provide the policies that shall be followed on the acquisition of PPE through fund 
transfer to other government agencies. Accordingly, only the expenses incurred and 
charged by the IAs from the fund transfer during the year shall be recognized and 
recorded by the Source Agency (SA) in its books of accounts upon partial liquidation. 

 
1.27 It also provides that when the acquisition is made by the IA, it shall record and monitor 

the PPE purchased out of inter-agency funds when it meets the recognition criteria. If 
the PPE will be returned to the SA at the completion of the project, the PPE shall be 
derecognized by the IA and recognized by the SA in their respective books of accounts 
upon its turnover. Otherwise, if the PPE will be eventually donated to the IA, the SA 
and IA shall record Donation/Assistance to NGAs/LGUs account and Income from 
Grants/Donations in Kind, respectively. 

 
1.28 The DOTr being mandated to promote, develop and regulate a dependable and 

coordinated network of transportation systems, as well as to provide the country a 
fast, safe, efficient and reliable transportation services has entered into various 
Memoranda of Agreement (MOA) with other NGAs, GOCCs and LGUs for the 
implementation of rail, airport, port and road programs/projects. Generally, these 
MOA provide that the Department shall cause the money/cash transfer to the IA and 
shall record the issuance, utilization and liquidation, including documentation of the 
same. On the other hand, the IAs shall utilize the funds transferred by the DOTr 
strictly for the implementation of the programs/projects and shall submit liquidation 
reports to the DOTr to monitor the utilization of the funds and facilitate the recording 
in the DOTr books of accounts. 

 
1.29 Relative to the above, it was noted that in the recording of financial transactions 

arising from fund transfers, the Accounting Division of DOTr-OSEC normally applies 
the prescribed illustrative entries embodied in the COA Circular No. 94-013 dated 
December 13, 1994, wherein all the items in the liquidation reports submitted by the 
IAs are recorded as Assistance to Other NGAs for fund transfer to other NGAs, 
Budgetary Support to GOCCs for fund transfers to GOCCs and Financial Assistance 
to LGUs for fund transfers to LGUs, regardless of whether it is an asset or an expense. 

 
1.30 Further, it was noted that partial liquidations of other IAs for the construction of 

facilities/projects totaling P2,182,106,935.72 were already recognized in the books of 
the DOTr-OSEC as expenses and deducted from the Inter-Agency Receivables 
accounts despite the non-completion of the projects and the lack of turn-over by the 
DOTr-OSEC and corresponding acceptance of the facilities/projects by the end-users, 



102  

thus, not in keeping with Section 17, Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs.

1.31 Accordingly, upon completion of these constructed facilities/projects, the same will 
be turned-over to the respective end-users and/or offices which shall be responsible 
for the operation, maintenance and preservation thereof. However, related review of 
the accounting entries drawn revealed that the foregoing PPE items are recorded 
neither in the books of the DOTr nor in the IAs books. For instance, the LTFRB 
initially records the asset during construction and derecognizes the same upon 
liquidation of the fund transfer to the DOTr. Whereas in the case of PPA and CAAP, 
the Trust Liability account is directly debited upon receipt of billings from the 
contractors instead of Construction-in-Progress account. 

 
1.32 On the other hand, the DOTr-OSEC records in its books the partial liquidations by 

these IAs directly to Assistance to Other NGAs/Budgetary Support to 
GOCCs/Assistance to LGUs regardless of the nature of transactions charged against 
the fund transfers. 

 
1.33 We recommended that Management of the DOTr-OSEC coordinate with the 

concerned IAs and discuss the appropriate recording of liquidations in the books 
of accounts in accordance with the GAM for NGAs. 

 
c. Erroneous classification of claims against relieved/dismissed Collecting 

Officers (COs) – P4.129 million 
 

1.34 The RCA (Updated 2019), Volume III of the GAM for NGAs, prescribes the use of 
Other Receivables account in recognizing amount due from debtors and other 
agencies not falling under any of the specific receivable account. 

 
1.35 Review of the consolidated financial statements of LTO disclosed that outstanding 

balances of former COs who either absconded or dismissed were recorded in the 
following accounts instead of Other Receivables as presented in Table 5.

Less: Erroneous classification with no impact within the 
same account class 

28,786,080.81 

Understatement of the Other Receivables account 4,129,986.97 
 

1.36 Erroneous classification can be attributed to the absence of a uniform accounting 
policy, coordination among the LTO offices in financial reporting affecting the 
consistency and uniformity of presentation of their respective separate financial 
statements. While the erroneous classifications totaling P28,786,080.81 have no 
impact within the same account class, the improper charge against the Cash- 
Collecting Officers account in the amount of P4,129,986.97 overstated the said 
account and correspondingly understated the Other Receivables account by the same 
amount. 

 
1.37 We recommended that Management of the LTO instruct the Accountants of 

LTO-SHO and LTO regional offices to closely coordinate and establish 
accounting policies on the financial transactions of LTO and to uniformly 
implement the same to ascertain consistency in financial reporting as well as the 
fair presentation of account balances in the separate and consolidated Statement 
of Financial Position. 

 
d. Non-recognition of impairment for impaired receivables – P92.180 million 

 
1.38 Section 10, Chapter 7, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs prescribes that an entity shall 

assess at the end of each reporting period whether there is any objective evidence that 
a financial asset or group of assets is impaired. In case of accounts receivable, the 
allowance for impairment shall be provided in an amount based on collectability of 
receivable balances and evaluation of such factors as aging of accounts, collection 
experiences of the agency, expected loss experiences and identified doubtful accounts. 

 
1.39 As discussed in (c) above, claims against Accountable Officer (AO) who were no 

longer connected to the LTO were erroneously classified as either Cash-Collecting 
Officer and/or Due from Officers and Employees. Further review of the accounts 
disclosed long outstanding balances which collectability are deemed to be remotely 



105  

possible due to the death of the AO, unknown whereabouts of the AOs, and 
unavailability of records, among others. 

 
1.40 Related audit disclosed impaired receivables carried in the Statement of Financial 

Position totaling P92,180,306.97 as at year end, details of which are presented in the 
following table.

1.41 The non-recognition of impairment on the aforementioned receivables is due to the 

absence of accounting policy on impairment. While LTO-SHO had already 
established an accounting policy on impairment, the same has yet to be communicated 
and implemented in the regional offices. Accordingly, the balance of Other 
Receivables account after reclassification in preceding observation is still overstated 
by P92,180,306.97, as it includes impaired receivables which may no longer be 
collected. 

 
1.42 We recommended that Management of the LTO implement the impairment 

policy nationwide for the Accounting Sections of the concerned offices to 
recognize impairment losses on impaired receivables to fairly present the 
receivables in the Statement of Financial Position.

a. Non-derecognition of obsolete and expired, and damaged/rejected inventory 
items – P18.031 million 

 
1.44 Paragraph 38 of IPSAS 12 states that “The cost of inventories may not be recoverable 

if those inventories are damaged, if they become wholly or partially obsolete, or if 
their selling prices have declined...The practice of writing inventories down below 



108  

cost of net realizable value is consistent with the view that assets are not to be carried 
in excess of the future economic benefits or service potential expected to be realized 
from their sale, exchange, distribution, or use.” 

 
1.45 Review and verification of Subsidiary Ledger Cards (SLCs) and Report on the 

Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) as at December 31, 2020 of LTO-SHO 
disclosed that the reported total amount of inventory includes obsolete inventories and 
damaged inventories as shown in the following table.

4,600 278,632.00 

Total 18,030,662.64  
 

1.46 The improper recording of rejected inventory items affects the cost of plates 
manufactured and issued to Plate Unit while ballooning the quantity remaining in the 
Work-in-Process Inventory account as the actual rejected plates remain at the custody 
of the Plate Making Plant (PMP). In addition, the space intended for the good raw 



109  

materials and finished plates inside the PMP were being occupied by the rejected 
plates. 

 
1.47 The inclusion and non-derecognition of obsolete, expired and damaged inventory 

items resulted in the overstatement of various inventory accounts as presented in 
Table 8 totaling P18,030,662.64 and understatement of the related Impairment Loss- 
Inventory and Accounts Payable accounts. 

 
1.48 We recommended that Management of LTO-SHO and LTFRB-IX instruct the 

concerned Accounting Sections to implement impairment policy and recognize 
impairment (inventory write-down) on obsolete inventories. 

 
Management Comments: 

 
1.49 The Management of LTO-SHO commented that provision for Impairment Loss on 

obsolete Accountable Forms and Stickers was recognized in accordance with the 
Impairment Policy which was approved on February 1, 2021, under JEV Nos. 101- 
21-02-0050 dated February 26, 2021. 

 
Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 
1.50 We appreciate Management’s prompt action on our recommendation on the recording 

of impairment losses. The Audit Team shall continue to monitor and verify the proper 
implementation of the Impairment Policy. 

 
b. Inconsistent Accounting Treatment of RFID –P8.150 million 

 
1.51 Further, review of the SLCs of LTO-SHO disclosed inconsistent accounting treatment 

for RFID between MC and MV. It was noted that the issuance of 50,000 pcs of RFID- 
MV to PMP was charged to expense during the year even if the said RFID is still at 
the custody of the PMP for printing. On the other hand, RFID-MC is only being 
charged to expense when the related MC was issued to the LTO offices nationwide. 

1.52 The inconsistent accounting treatment understated the Accountable Forms, Plates and 
Stickers Inventory by P8,150,000.00 and overstated the Accountable Forms Expense 
as at December 31, 2020. 

1.53 We recommended and Management agreed to treat the issuance of RFID for MC 
and MV consistently. 

 
c. Recording errors such as unrecorded receipts, issuances, double recording, 

erroneous costing – P414.489 million 
 

1.54 Section 17 (g), Chapter 8, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs states that “Report of 
Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI) shall be prepared by the Property and/or 



110  

Supply Custodian based on the RIS and shall be used by the Accounting Division/Unit 
as basis in preparing the JEV to record the supplies and materials issued.” 

1.55 The Inventory accounts also showed recording errors as presented in the table:

Net Overstatement     (414,488,988.18)  

 
1.56 In the DOTr-CAR, audit of the accounts showed double recording of issuances of 

various office supplies amounting to P69,485.90 which overstates the Office Supplies 
Expense and understates the Office Supplies Inventory account. 

 
1.57 In LTO-SHO, review and examination of SLCs and RPCI disclosed variances due to 

unrecorded issuances, double recording, over and under recording of inventory 
movements due to erroneous reporting of the PMP, late submission of RSMIs and 
non-reconciliation, which resulted in a net overstatement in various inventory 
accounts totaling P91,956,760.49. 



111  

1.58 Examination on test basis of submitted Reports on Summary of Issuance and 
Remaining Balances on Hand and related RSMI of LTO-NCR revealed that 
accountable forms particularly DL Cards, MV Plates, Validation Stickers and Plate 
Year Tags totaling P322,420,816.97 which were already issued in relation to services 
rendered to its clienteles and/or consumed by the office on its daily operations 
remained recorded as inventories instead of expenses contrary to the above provisions 
of the GAM for NGAs. Likewise, review of RPCI and SLCs disclosed several semi- 
expendable items amounting to P3,249,663.00 were already issued to end-users but 
remained recorded in the books. 

 
1.59 Also, in LTO-X, semi-expendables amounting to P3,618,990.33 were already issued 

to end-users but due to lack of manpower and time constraints, the said inventories 
were not charged to expense. Instances of late receipt of JEVs from the LTO-SHO for 
transferred properties also contributed to the delay in recognition of expense. 

 
1.60 In LTO-XII, comparison between SLC and RPCI disclosed a variance of 

P6,687,756.71 for reconciliation. Further audit disclosed that the variance is due to 
the unrecorded receipts of Motorcycle Plates and unrecorded issuances of 2020 
Validations Stickers and Plate Year Tags amounting to P7,134,866.34 and 
P447,109.63, respectively, ultimately, which resulted in a net understatement in the 
recorded inventory accounts of the said Office by P6,687,756.71. 

 
1.61 The recording errors resulted in net overstatement of the inventory accounts and 

understatement in the related expense accounts and Accounts Payable. 
 

1.62 We recommended that Management of the DOTr-CAR and LTO offices 
concerned: (a) instruct the concerned Accounting Section of the respective offices 
to record the necessary adjusting/correcting entries and coordinate with the 
concerned Property/Supply Officers to conduct monthly reconciliation of 
records to ensure timely recognition and correction of recording errors; and 
(b) direct the Accountant of LTO-SHO to promptly issue JEV for each and every 
transfers/issuances to the regional offices for them to promptly recognize the 
same in their respective books. 

 
Management Comments: 

 
1.63 In LTO-SHO, Management informed that issuances to regional offices were taken up 

in the books per JEV Nos. 101-21-01-04 and 05 both dated January 25, 2021 while 
issuances of various supplies, semi-expendable inventories and books were taken up 
in the books through JEV Nos. 101-21-02-046 and 51, 184-21-02-011 and SB-21-03- 
001 dated February 25 and 26 and March 26, 2021, respectively. 

 
1.64 Management of LTO-NCR commented that the non-recording of issuances of 

Accountable Forms, Plate and Stickers were attributable to the transfer of the 
accounting personnel in-charge to the field office and the resignation of contract of 



112  

service accountant coupled with the new normal condition and frequent lockdown due 
to the pandemic. Issuances of the said inventory amounting to P37,339,432.33 from 
January to December 2020 were taken up in the books under JEV Nos. 21-01-023 to 
025 dated January 31, 2021. 

 
1.65 Meanwhile, Management of LTO-XII issued a Memorandum for the acting Regional 

Supply Officer and the Regional Accountant to conduct a thorough review and 
reconciliation of their records and respective reports. As for the unrecorded receipts 
of Motorcycle plates, the Regional Accountant already coordinated with LTO-SHO 
Accounting Section for the issuance of the transfer JEV for the former to record the 
receipts in their books. As at March 10, 2021, LTO-SHO was not yet furnished with 
the transfer JEV. 

 
Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 
1.66 The noted misstatements were recorded/corrected after the reporting period hence, the 

Audit Teams maintain their stand that the LTO and its regional offices should 
recognize transactions in the proper period in compliance with the accrual basis of 
accounting. The Audit Teams shall monitor and verify the Management’s 
commitment to conduct a thorough review and periodic reconciliation. 

 
 

GUARANTY DEPOSITS 
 

1.67 The RCA (Updated 2019), Volume III of the GAM for NGAs defines the Guaranty 
Deposits as an account used to recognize amount deposited for goods such as deposit 
for containers and deposits made to guarantee compliance with the terms of an 
agreement. Whereas, the Other Deposits is the account used to recognize the amount 
of deposits not falling under any of the specific deposit accounts. 

 
1.68 In the DOTr-OSEC, examination of the SL for the Guaranty Deposits account 

revealed that it has deposited a total of P498,977,406.00 to different Regional Trial 
Courts (RTCs) in favor of the landowners of affected properties in connection with 
the implementation of the Metro Manila Subway Project (MMSP) Phase 1 project. 
The deposits represent the amount equivalent to the 100% of the value of the affected 
land based on the current relevant zonal valuation of the BIR. 

 
1.69 However, considering the definition of the said account as provided in the RCA 

(Updated 2019), the deposits to respective RTCs relative to right-of-way acquisition 
through expropriation do not fall under Guaranty Deposits account, since the financial 
transactions involved were neither deposits for goods nor deposits to guarantee 
compliance with the terms of an agreement. On this note, the proper recording of such 
transactions should be under the Other Deposits account as the deposits involved 
thereto are for expropriation cases and does not fall under specific deposit accounts. 



113  

While the year-end balances of both accounts were misstated, this has no impact on 
the account class balance. 

 
1.70 We recommended that Management of the DOTr-OSEC direct the concerned 

Chief Accountant to adjust and/or reclassify the deposits to RTCs to Other 
Deposits account in conformity with the RCA (Updated 2019) provided in 
Volume III of the GAM for NGAs to ensure the fair presentation of the financial 
statements. 

 
Management Comments: 

 
1.71 The Accounting Division prepared the JEV No. RA21-04-01033 dated April 30, 2021 

reclassifying the Guaranty Deposits to Other Deposits account. 
 
 

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (PPE) 
 

1.72 The balance of the PPE accounts as at December 31, 2020 is misstated by 
P10,437,733,087.86 due to errors, details of which are summarized in the following 
table and discussed in the succeeding paragraphs.

a. Completed projects not yet transferred to entities having control over the 
assets – P10.419 billion 

 
1.73 Paragraph 14 of IPSAS 17 states that the cost of an item of PPE shall be recognized 

as an asset if, and only if, it is probable that future economic benefits or service 
potential associated with the item will flow to the entity. 

 
1.74 Paragraph 82 of IPSAS 17 also provides that the carrying amount of an item of PPE 

shall be derecognized: on disposal; or when no future economic benefits or service 
potential is expected from its use or disposal. 

 
1.75 In the DOTr-OSEC, review of the account disclosed completed airport systems, 

seaports systems, buildings, other structures, land improvements and transportation 
equipment with a carrying value of P10,419,357,926.21, net of Accumulated 
Depreciation of P2,005,922,214.06, that remained recorded in the books of the DOTr 



116  

despite the latter having no control over these assets, thus, not in keeping with 
pertinent provisions of IPSAS 17. 

 
1.76 We recommended that Management of the DOTr-OSEC prepare the necessary 

property transfer documents pertaining to these completed projects starting 
from the recent ones and continue to strengthen its coordination with the 
concerned recipient agencies and/or end-users to expedite the transfer of these 
PPE items and eventually to derecognize the same in the DOTr’s books of 
accounts. 

 
Management Comments: 

 
1.77 Management commented that preparation of the necessary property transfer 

documents is continuously being undertaken by the Project Management Services/ 
Project Management Office (PMS/PMO) thru coordination with the recipient 
agencies to expedite the transfer of PPE items and to properly substantiate transfer 
documents prior to final billing/claim. For completed projects with no property 
transfer documents, the Accounting Division prepares the Property Transfer Report 
(PTR) to be signed by the concerned officials of the Department and the recipient 
agencies however, this yielded low outcome since most of the recipient agencies were 
hesitant to sign the PTRs. Nonetheless, consistent follow-ups were made for recipient 
agencies which failed to sign the PTRs. 

 
b. Unrecorded intra-agency transfers – P82.948 million 

 
1.78 Section 14, Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs provides the rules and 

regulations on the intra-agency transfers of PPE. Accordingly, transferred properties 
shall be recognized at the carrying amount of the assets received. The receiving office 
shall recognize the asset at its original historical cost less accumulated depreciation 
and accumulated impairment loss. 

 
1.79 Reconciliation of the PPE schedule of the Accounting Section and the Report on 

Physical Count of PPE (RPCPPE) showed that some assets were not recorded in the 
books as shown below:

117  

1.80 In the DOTr-CAR, LTO-NCR and LTO-V, their respective Accounting Section 
informed that the transactions have not been recorded in the books because they were 
not able to gather or have not been furnished with the corresponding JEVs from the 
Accounting Section of the LTO-SHO. In effect, the affected PPE accounts as well as 
the Subsidy from Central Office account were understated. 

 
1.81 We recommended that Management of the offices concerned direct the 

Accounting Section to communicate with the LTO-SHO regarding the 
unrecorded intra-agency transfers and effect necessary accounting entries to 
recognize the receipt of property. 

Management Comments: 
 

1.82 The DOTr-CAR Management agreed to the given recommendation on the non- 
recording of intra-agency transfer. For the noted variances relative to the intra-agency 
transfers of PPE items, Management commented that the Supply Division and 
Accounting Section will confer to the LTO-SHO. 

 
c. Erroneous recording of Contractor’s VAT claims to CIP Account 

 
1.83 Moreover, in the DOTr-OSEC, audit of PPE accounts disclosed erroneous recording 

to the CIP- Infrastructure Assets - North - South Rail Project account of payment 
amounting to P78,875,403.96 representing the VAT claims of Sumitomo Mitsui 
Construction Co. Ltd. in relation to the North-South Commuter Railway Project 
(Malolos-Tutuban), Contract Package 2. The entries made on the payment of the VAT 
claim was debited to the CIP account instead of Accounts Payable account. 

 
1.84 We recommended that Management of DOTr-OSEC require the Accounting 

Section to make the necessary entries to correct the erroneous recording of the 
transactions. 

 
Management Comments: 

 
1.85 The Accounting Section agreed to the recommendation and will make the necessary 

adjusting entries accordingly. 
 

d. Non-recognition of impairment losses on unserviceable PPE – P22.448 million 
 

1.86 Section 28, Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs states that a property is said 
to be impaired when its carrying amount in the Statement of Financial Position 
exceeds its recoverable service amount or recoverable amount due to fall in market 
value of an asset. 

 
1.87 Likewise, Section 40 (d), Chapter 10, Volume 1 of the GAM for NGAs provides that 

“All unserviceable property shall be reported in the Inventory and Inspection of 



118  

Unserviceable Property (IIRUP). PPE reported in the IIRUP shall be dropped from 
the books by debiting Impairment Loss-Property, Plant and Equipment (cost of PPE 
less Accumulated Depreciation).” 

 
1.88 Related audit disclosed that several LTO regional offices were not able to recognize 

impairment losses on unserviceable/obsolete properties which remained undisposed 
due to the non-preparation and non-submission of Inventory and Inspection Report of 
Unserviceable Property (IIRUP), thus overstating the reported PPE account balance 
by P22,447,630.94. Details are shown in the following table.

1.89 We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the concerned: (a) LTO 
Regional Property Officer to prepare and submit IIRUP to their respective 
Accounting Section; and (b) Accounting Section to recognize impairment losses 
on impaired PPE to fairly present the account balances in the Statement of 
Financial Position. 

 
e. Non-reclassification of completed projects to appropriate PPE accounts 

 
1.90 Section 8 (g), Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs provides that during the 

construction period, all expenses incurred in relation to the construction of the PPE 
shall be taken up in the books as Construction in Progress (CIP) with the appropriate 
asset classification. As soon as the construction is completed, the CIP account shall 
be reclassified to the proper asset account. Likewise, all expenses such as interests, 
license fees, etc., incurred during the construction period shall be capitalized. 

 
1.91 In the DOTr-OSEC and DOTr-CAR, analysis of the transactions recorded to the CIP– 

Infrastructure Asset account revealed that various projects with total value of 
P4,869,298,578.52 were already completed and duly supported by Certificate of 
Project completion and/or turn-over documents but remained recorded under the CIP 
account as at year-end. Details are shown in the following table.

1.92 In the DOTr-OSEC, further verification revealed that 11 projects with a total cost of 

P4,841,257,219.96 were already completed and duly supported by Certificate of 
Project Completion but remained recorded under the CIP account as at year-end. Of 
this amount, P4,795,926,521.82 represents the billed portion which form part of the 
CIP account balance as at year-end, while P45,330,698.14 pertains to the unbilled 
portion by the contractor. 

 
1.93 In the DOTr-CAR, examination of documents revealed building projects amounting 

to P28,041,358.56 which have already been completed and duly supported with turn- 



120  

over and acceptance certificates issued in CYs 2019 and 2020, and have been in use, 
but are still recorded under the CIP-Buildings and Other Structures account. 

 
1.94 The non-reclassification of completed projects to its appropriate asset accounts may 

have no direct effect in the recorded PPE account balance in the Statement of 
Financial Position, but had adversely affected the accuracy and reliability of the 
balances of the affected asset accounts, thereby giving misleading information and at 
the same time constituting inaccurate recording of transactions. 

 
1.95 We recommended that Management of the DOTr-OSEC and the DOTr-CAR 

direct the Accountants concerned to draw the necessary adjusting entries to 
reclassify the completed projects to the appropriate PPE accounts on the basis 
of the Certificate of 100% Completion and other documents necessary therefor. 

 
Management Comments: 

 
1.96 The Accounting Division of the DOTr-OSEC commented that they will coordinate 

with the concerned PMO for the submission of documents for the reclassification of 
the CIP accounts and will drop the assets, if warranted. 

 
1.97 The Supply Officer of the DOTr-CAR commented during the exit conference that the 

variance in the Buildings account pertained to various repair projects implemented in 
the past, but related documents still remained unavailable as at audit date. It was also 
mentioned that the one-time cleansing of PPE account balances under COA rules 
could address the issue.

1.98 The balance of Accounts Payable as at December 31, 2020 is misstated by

a. Unrecorded already delivered purchases and rendered services – P4.424 million 
 

1.99 Section 119 of PD No. 1445 states that “All lawful expenditures and obligations 
incurred during the year shall be taken up in the accounts of that year.” 

 
1.100 In LTO-SHO, audit revealed the non-recording of the transactions in the proper period 

is due to the late submission of the concerned offices of the required supporting 
documents as basis for the recording, thus, resulted in the understatement of Accounts 
Payable amounting to P4,424,421.21 and understatement of the affected accounts as 
at year-end. 

 
b. Recognition of liability without sufficient and appropriate documentation and 

which has been outstanding for more than two (2) years – P1.587 million 
 

1.101 Sections 1 and 2 of the EO No. 87 dated August 13, 2019 states the all documented 
accounts payable which remain outstanding for at least two (2) years shall be subject 
to automatic reversion. Likewise, all accounts payable which are undocumented or 
not covered by perfected contracts on records, regardless of the year in which they 
were incurred, shall automatically be reverted. 

1.102 In LTO-XII, review of the financial records disclosed long-outstanding payables 
amounting to P1,587,031.82 which pertain to the terminal leave benefits of retired 
employees. The liability was recognized in the books due to the sub-allotment given 
to cover such but it was not processed due to non-availability of appropriate and 
sufficient supporting documents for the claim. Further inquiry with the Human 
Resource Management Office revealed that the reason, among others, was because of 
the pending clearance from LTO-SHO of the reported cash accountability of the 
concerned employees. 



122  

1.103 We recommended that Management of concerned LTO offices instruct the 
respective Accounting Sections to prepare the necessary adjusting entries to 
correct the recorded Accounts Payable and other affected accounts reported in 
the financial statements. 

 
Management Comments: 

 
1.104 Management of LTO-SHO informed that restatement of prior year’s balances will be 

reported for CY 2021 financial statements to correct the Accounts Payable and other 
accounts affected. 

 
1.105 On the other hand, Management of LTO-XII commented that an adjusting entry was 

made under JEV No. 21-01-04 in January 2021 to record the reversion of the accounts 
payable with outstanding balance aging two years or more. The Regional Accountant 
further committed that she will strictly adhere to the COA’s recommendation. 

 
Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 
1.106 The Audit Teams shall monitor and verify Management’s commitment to fairly 

present Accounts Payable balance.

1.108 Section 17, Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs provides for the rules on the 
acquisition of property, plant and equipment through fund transfers to other 
government agencies. The accounting entries are presented in Annex M of GAM

during the year shall be recognized and recorded by the Source Agency in its books 
upon receipt of partial liquidation. 

 
1.109 On this note, review of the JEV relative to the liquidation of PNR for the North-South 

Commuter Railway System Project disclosed that partial liquidation amounting to 
P14,631,141.76 was recorded to Budgetary Support to Government-Owned or 
Controlled Corporations account, thereby, overstating the said account by the same 



124  

amount instead of the specific expenses to which it relates. However, the identification 
of proper expense account could not be made since only Certification/Status of Fund 
Transfer with no specific details of disbursements supports the liquidation report. 

 
1.110 We recommended that Management of the DOTr-OSEC require the Chief 

Accountant to make the necessary adjusting entry to correct the erroneous 
recording of liquidations of fund transfers pursuant to Section 17, Chapter 10 
and Annex M, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs. 

 
b. Erroneous use of Assistance to Other National Government Agencies account 

to record completed projects transferred to CAAP – P1.191 billion 
 

1.111 The RCA (Updated 2019), Volume III of the GAM for NGAs defines Assistance to 
Other National Government Agencies as account used to recognize assistance to other 
NGAs through transfer of funds or assets. The same chart of accounts states that 
Donations account is debited to recognize the amount of donations to other levels of 
government and individuals and institutions and is credited, at year end, to close to 
the Revenue and Expense Summary account, and/or adjustments. 

 
1.112 In the DOTr-OSEC, review of accounting records disclosed that 58 projects 

amounting to P1,191,897,131.67 were transferred to CAAP and recorded in the books 
as a debit to Assistance to Other National Government Agencies, instead of 
Donations, contrary to the description and nature of the account as prescribed in the 
aforementioned Manual. 

 
1.113 It is emphasized that the Donations account is the proper and/or appropriate account 

to be used for this particular transaction and/or property transfers considering that 
CAAP is a GOCC created by virtue of R.A No. 9497, otherwise known as the Civil 
Aviation Authority Act of 2008. 

 
1.114 We recommended that Management direct the Chief Accountant of the DOTr- 

OSEC to draw necessary adjusting entry to reclassify the cost of completed 
projects transferred to CAAP from Assistance to Other National Government 
Agencies account to the appropriate Donations account. 

 
c. Erroneous recording of recoupment of advance payment for the procurement 

of supervision consultant for the MRT Line 3 Rehabilitation Project - P5.086 
million 

 
1.115 Audit of the Consultancy Service account revealed an erroneous recording of 

transactions relating to the recoupment of advance payment for the procurement of 
supervision consultant of the Joint Venture (JV) for the MRT Line 3 Rehabilitation 
Project which payment was erroneously recorded to the Repairs and Maintenance- 
Leased Assets-Other Leased account instead of the Consultancy Service account. The 
journal entry made by the Accounting Division for the recoupment of advance 



125  

payment per JEV No. RA20-07-01305 dated July 31, 2020 was a debit to the Repairs 
and Maintenance-Leased Assets-Other Leased Assets amounting to P5,085,764.48 
and a credit to Advances to Contractors of the same amount. 

 
1.116 Accordingly, the transaction relating to the recoupment should be recorded under 

Consultancy Services and not in Repairs and Maintenance account. However, a 
separate subsidiary ledger under Consultancy Service should be made to record the 
transactions involving the said supervision consultant of the MRT rehabilitation. This 
is in pursuant to the Project Administration Manual of Asian Development Bank that 
requires maintenance of a separate books and records for the Infrastructure 
Preparation and Innovation Facility Project–Output 3 which is currently recorded in 
Consultancy Service account. 

 
1.117 In effect, the Repairs and Maintenance account was overstated while the Consultancy 

Services account was understated by the same amount of P5,085,764.48. 
 

1.118 We recommended that Management of the DOTr-OSEC direct the Chief 
Accountant to make the necessary adjusting entry to correct the erroneous 
recording of the transaction. 

 
Management Comments: 

 
1.119 Management prepared the JEV No. RA21-04-00934 dated April 30, 2021 transferring 

the related recoupment from Repairs and Maintenances- Leased Assets- Other Leased 
Assets to Consultancy Services. Moreover, a separate Subsidiary Ledger (SL) for the 
supervision consultant of the MRT was created. 

 
d. Non-compliance with the accrual basis of accounting – P1.073 billion 

 
1.120 Section 6 (b), Chapter 2, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs states that each entity shall 

recognize and present its financial transactions and operations conformably to accrual 
basis of accounting in accordance with IPSAS. 

 
1.121 Accrual basis as defined in Section 2 (a), Chapter 2, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs 

is a basis of accounting under which transactions and other events are recognized 
when they occur (and not only when cash or its equivalent is received or paid). 
Therefore, the transactions and events are recognized in the accounting records and 
recognized in the financial statements of the periods to which they relate. 

 
1.122 In the DOTr-OSEC, evaluation of the transactions in CY 2020 pertaining to the 

Rehabilitation and Maintenance Agreement (RMA) on MRT-3 with Sumitomo 
Corporation disclosed that no accrual was made for the works/services rendered for 
the months of November and December 2020. This resulted in non-recognition of the 
accrued amount of P1,073,075,343.92. 



126  

1.123 Further, our prior year’s recommendations which advised the MRT-3 Management to 
ensure the completion of the assessment/appraisal of the MRT-3 System in CY 2020 
and to provide the Chief Accountant of the report of the appraisal in order that said 
asset and related affected accounts be recorded in the books of the DOTr-OSEC were 
not yet complied with. 

 
1.124 Hence, the materiality of the total amount of the RMA could not be clearly assessed 

since the total cost of the MRT-3 system is still undetermined. Congruently, the 
Accounting Division continued the recording of the rehabilitation costs as outright 
expense instead of capitalizing it to the appropriate asset account. 

 
1.125 It is emphasized that pursuant to Section 24, Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM for 

NGAs, the rehabilitation/upgrade/replacement (including the spare parts) of MRT-3 
system could be recognized/classified as major repair since this would improve the 
functionality of and/or extend the MRT-3’s estimated useful life and increase in future 
economic benefits, or realize service potential. Further, considering the huge sums of 
money involved and the identifiable costs of the replacement and upgrade to be 
undertaken under the RMA, these should have been capitalized as an asset or addition 
to the carrying amount of PPE in the books and shall be depreciated over the 
remaining useful life of the PPE, then the original cost of that replaced component 
and the related accumulated depreciation shall be derecognized. 

 
1.126 We recommended that Management of the DOTr-OSEC direct the Chief 

Accountant to strictly comply with the accrual basis of accounting pursuant to 
Section 6 (b), Chapter 2, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs. 

 
1.127 Likewise, we reiterated our prior year’s recommendation that Management 

advise the MRT-3 Management to ensure that the assessment/appraisal of the 
MRT-3 System be completed as planned, and upon completion, provide the Chief 
Accountant of the DOTr-OSEC of the result/report of the appraisal in order for 
the said asset and the related affected accounts to be recorded/adjusted in the 
books and presented in the financial statements accordingly. 

 
Management Comments: 

 
1.128 The Director for Operations provided that the contract for Consultancy Services for 

MRT 3 Asset Valuation was entered into between DOTr-MRT3 and the contractor on 
March 15, 2021. Accordingly, a copy of the result of appraisal will be submitted to 
DOTr through the Chief Accountant. 

 
e. Erroneous computation of Depreciation Expenses – P78.770 million 

 
1.129 Paragraph 13 of IPSAS 17 defined depreciation as the systematic allocation of the 

depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life. 



127  

1.130 Moreover, paragraph 71 of the IPSAS 17 states that depreciation of an asset begins 
when it is available for use, i.e., when it is in the location and condition necessary for 
it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. 

 
1.131 In the DOTr-OSEC, related audit of the recorded depreciation expenses in the books 

during the year showed understatement of Depreciation Expense and Accumulated 
Depreciation accounts by P78,770,390.93 due to the inability of the Management to 
provide depreciation expenses on some completed and available for use infrastructure 
assets. The details are shown below:

Total 2,225,796,640.59 2,304,567,031.52 78,770,390.93 
 

1.132 It bears to note that regardless of the end-user, the corresponding costs of these 
properties are bound to be allocated over their useful lives. Consequently, the failure 
of the Management to provide appropriate depreciation to these completed projects 
resulted in the overstatement of the recorded values of these assets, as well as the 
equity balance of the agency as at year end. 

 
1.133 We recommended that Management of the DOTr-OSEC direct the Accounting 

Division to compute and provide depreciation for all PPE items consistent with 
paragraphs 13 and 71 of IPSAS 17 - Property Plant and Equipment. 

 
Management Comments: 

 
1.134 The Accounting Division noted the audit recommendation and will record the 

adjustments in the 1st Quarter of CY 2021. 
 

Accounting Deficiencies Affecting the Reliability of Account Balances 
 

2. Accounting deficiencies such as unreconciled/unsubstantiated balances due to 
absence or inadequate records and/or schedules/documents affecting some 
accounts to the extent of P11,448,921,481.40 were noted. Based on the possible/ 
potential effects of these accounting deficiencies, the reported balances of the 
accounts affected could not be fully relied upon. 



128  

2.1 Section 6 (e) Chapter 19, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs on Qualitative 
Characteristics of Financial Reporting states that an entity shall present information 
including accounting policies in a manner that meets reliable information which is 
free from material error and bias, and can be depended on by users to represent 
faithfully that which it purports to represent or could reasonably be expected to 
represent. 

 
2.2 Audit of the accounts disclosed that there were accounting deficiencies in eight 

financial accounts with an aggregate amount of P11,448,921,481.40 which requires 
further analysis, reconciliation, physical count/verification, coordination and future 
corrective actions as these have possible effects on the accuracy and reliability of the 
reported account balances of the agency’s financial statements. Details of this are 
summarized in the following table:

2.4 Section 10 of the General Provisions of GAA of FY 2020 states that the departments, 

bureaus, offices, and instrumentalities of the National Government, including 
Constitutional Offices enjoying fiscal autonomy and SUCs are mandated to close and 
revert all balances of Special Accounts, Fiduciary or Trust Funds, and Revolving 
Funds to the General Fund in any of the following instances: (i) when there is no legal 
basis for its creation; (ii) when their terms have expired; or (iii) when they are no 
longer necessary for the attainment of the purposes for which said funds are 
established. 

 
2.5 Audit and review of the Cash and Cash Equivalents account disclosed the existence 

of dormant balances totaling P1,238,494.13 in the books as at year-end as shown in 
the following table.

P285,769.29. 

b. LBP, Local Currency 
Savings Account - NIADP 
Adverse Claim Case - 
P411,704.00 

    Management informed that they 
have sent a letter to LBP on 
December 1, 2020 requesting for 
the closure of the foregoing 
accounts and that the remaining 
balance be deposited to LBP Trust 
account of the Department since 
the NIADP was already completed 
and all money claims for the 
properties affected have been 
settled. 

Totals 1,238,494.13   
 

2.6 We recommended that Management of the DOTr-CAR direct the Finance 
Division to document the request for write-off and/or adjustment from the COA 
of the Cash-Collecting Officers account balance in the amount of P541,020.84, 
which are considered dormant and are not supported by complete documents, 
pursuant to COA Circular Nos. 97-001 and 2016-005. 

 
2.7 Likewise, we recommended that Management of the DOTr-OSEC follow up the 

outstanding request to LBP for the closure of the bank accounts pertaining to 
NIADP and its immediate reversion to the BTr consistent with Section 10 of the 
General Provisions of the GAA of FY 2020 which provides for the reversion of 
all dormant accounts and/or unnecessary special and trust funds to the general 
fund and other purposes. 



131  

Management Comments: 
 

2.8 The Management of DOTr-OSEC commented that they have followed up the closure 
of the NIADP accounts. In their recent communication with the LBP Iloilo, they were 
informed that the former will have to re-activate these accounts to facilitate their 
closure. However, the bank is requiring them to submit a court order for the closure 
of the accounts. Accordingly, another follow-up letter for the closure shall be sent 
invoking Section 10 of the General Provisions of the FY 2020 GAA, instead of 
submitting a court order. 

 
b. Negative balances and unreconciled balances of Cash-Collecting Officers 

account – P0.566 million 
 

2.9 Section 111 (2) of PD No. 1445 provides that “The highest standards of honesty, 
objectivity and consistency shall be observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard 
against inaccurate or misleading information.” 

 
2.10 Review of the submitted notes to financial statements of LTO-I, II and VI disclosed 

abnormal/negative cash balances of Cash-Collecting Officers account aggregating 
P374,806.52 which could be attributed to erroneous recording and/or posting of 
collections and deposits. 

 
2.11 Aside from the negative balances noted above, there were unreconciled/outstanding 

balances of Cash-Collecting Officers in LTO-II pertaining to regular fund, seatbelt 
fund and MVUC fund amounting P94,760.79, P90,000.00 and P6,349.86, 
respectively. 

 
2.12 The noted negative balances and outstanding unreconciled balances on the accounts 

of Cash-Collecting Officers can be attributed to carelessness of the concerned 
Collecting Officers (COs) and non-reconciliation of records of the Accountants. 
These unreconciled and negative balances rendered the recorded Cash-Collecting 
Officers account balance unreliable. 

 
2.13 We recommended that Management instruct the COs concerned to be more 

circumspect in the discharge of their functions, which includes maintenance of 
accurate reports; and the Accountants to perform periodic/monthly 
reconciliation of records to timely identify and correct accounting errors. 

 
c. Other deficiencies noted in the handling and recording of cash collections and 

deposits 
 

2.14 Moreover, audit also disclosed control deficiencies in the handling and recording of 
cash collections and deposits as well as in the preparation of required reports by the 
concerned Accountable Officers (AOs) of LTO regional offices, contrary to existing 
laws, rules and regulations on cash management and exposes the concerned agencies 



132  

to possible risk of loss or misuse of government funds and/or property. Details are 
summarized below: 

 
Table 17: Deficiencies noted in Handling and Recording of 

Cash Collections and Deposits 
Existing Laws, Rules and 

Regulations 
Region/ 
Office Noted Deficiencies Effect 

On bond requirement – 
 

Item 5.1 of BTr Treasury Circular No. 
2-2009 states that “The amount of bond 
shall be based on the total 
accountability (cash, property and 
accountable forms) of the accountable 
public officer as determined by the 
Head of Agency. Provided, the 
individual maximum accountability of 
each accountable public officer shall 
not exceed One Hundred Million 
Pesos. However, the Head of Agency 
may assign to other public officers the 
excess accountability for which a 
separate Fidelity Bond shall be 
secured.” 

LTO-NCR Verification of the list of 
cashiers with access to 
Revenue Collection System 
(RCS) revealed that 23 out 
of 73 users were Job Orders 
acting as sub-collecting 
officers and receiving LTO 
fees over the counter even 
without bond and any 
designation from the Head 
of the Agency to perform 
such critical function which 
is exclusively for bonded 
officials and employees. On 
this note, the Management 
of LTO-NCR informed that 
control measures are in place 
to mitigate the risk of 
misappropriation however, 
such practice still exposes 
the said office to the risks of 
not being indemnified in 
case of defalcation, shortage 
or unrelieved loss in the 
account of the concerned 
COs. 

AOs who were not 
bonded/sufficiently 
bonded heightens the 
risks that the agency 
may not be able to 
file any claim for 
reimbursement from 
the Fidelity Fund in 
the event that there is 
a case of defalcation 
or shortage on the 
account of the AOs. 

LTO-III Four AOs have exceeded the 
Maximum Cash 
Accountability as prescribed 
in Annex C - Revised 
Schedule of Premium Rates 
of the Treasury Circular No. 
2-2009.

On transfer of funds and properties – 
 

Section 77 of PD No. 1445 states that 
“When  government  funds or property 
are transferred from one Accountable 
Officer    to    another,    or    from  an 

LTO-III No proper turn-over of 
accountabilities occurred

shall be done upon properly itemized 
invoice and receipt which shall 
invariably support the clearance to be 
issued to the relieved or out-going 
officer, subject to regulations of the 
Commission.” 

   

On deposit of collections – 
 

Section 69 of PD No. 1445 provides 
among others that “(1) Public officers 
authorized to received and collect 
moneys arising from taxes, or 
revenues, or receipts of any kind shall 
remit or deposit intact the full amounts 
so received and collected by them to 
the treasury of the agency concerned 
and credited to the particular accounts 
to which the said money belong… (4). 
The respective treasuries of those 
agencies shall in turn deposit with the 
proper government depository the full 
amount of the collections not later than 
the following banking day.” 

 
Item D of the Instructions for Appendix 
26, Volume II of the GAM for NGAs 
requires that “Collections should be 
deposited intact daily. The balance of 
collections not deposited during the 
day due to cut-off should be deposited 
on the first banking hour of the next 
working day.” 

LTO-V Analysis of E-Patrol’s 
Report of Collections and 
Deposits for the period from 
November  26, 2019  to July 
31,  2020,  September  1-30, 
2020 and December 1-31, 
2020 revealed that out of the 
total deposits of 
P18,421,615.23, the amount 
of P6,046,202.50 were not 
deposited intact daily to the 
authorized depository bank, 
with delays ranging from 1 to 
55 banking days. 
Management relieved the 
said AO from her post 
effective December 15, 2020 
and   ordered   the  Regional 
Internal Audit Service to 
conduct audit. 

The practice of not 
depositing the 
collections as 
prescribed by 
existing rules and 
regulations exposes 
the government 
moneys to risk of 
loss, misuse and/or 
misappropriation. 

LTO-VI Significant amount of cash 
on hand in the possession of 
the COs amounting to 
P8,961,636.23 (all funds) 
can be construed that 
Management has weak 
internal controls on its 
collections and deposits.

District Office (DO) failed to 
deposit her collections 
incurring 32 days of delay. 

LTO-XII The concerned COs of E-

Marawi DO of LTO-XII 
incurred 1 to 65 days delay in 
depositing its collections 
amounting to 
P33,605,151.63. The 
concerned COs claimed that 
it is impracticable for them to 
deposit their collections 
daily due to the significant

On submission of RCDs and ORs – 
 

Section 39, Chapter 5, Volume I of

prepare the Report of Collections and 
Deposits (RCD) for submission to

shall be supported by documentary 
evidence such as duplicate copies of 
ORs and validated deposit slips. 

 
Further, item 7.2.1 (a) of COA Circular 
No. 2009-006 or the Rules and 
Regulations on the Settlement of 
Accounts (RRSA) requires that the 
submission of the reports and 
supporting documents by the AOs be 
immediately recorded in the books of

within the first ten (10) days of the 
ensuing month. 

LTO-IV-B RCDs and ORs were not 
submitted within the 
prescribed deadline 
incurring 9 to 262 days of 
delay. 

Accuracy and 
completeness of the 
reported revenue 
could not be 
ascertained. 

LTO-V RCDs together with the 
duplicate copies of issued 
ORs and validated deposit 
slips were not submitted by 
E-Patrol and Pamplona DO, 
both of LTO-V, within the 
prescribed  period,  or  31 to 
366 days past due, thus, 
accuracy and completeness 
of the reported revenue by E- 
Patrol in August, October 
and November 2020 of 
P7,190,182.16 and by 
Pamplona DO in October 
2019 to October 2020 of 
P28,555,738.61, or a total 
amount   of  P35,745,920.77 
could not be ascertained. 
Further verification revealed 
that deposits of E-Patrol of 
LTO-Region V in the total 
amount of P8,070,464.44 
were not supported with 
bank validated deposit slips. 
Management relieved the 
said AO from her post 
effective December 15, 
2020 and ordered the 
Regional Internal Audit 
Service to conduct audit. 

Deposits cannot be 
verified and the AO’s 
accountability cannot 
be accurately 
established. 

On use of PCFR – LTO-III The COs who also acted as 
PCF Custodians for the 
change fund amounting to 

The non-

Existing Laws, Rules and 
Regulations 

Region/ 
Office Noted Deficiencies Effect 

Section 37, Chapter 6, Volume I of 
the GAM for NGAs mandates the 
preparation and maintenance of Petty 
Cash Fund Register (PCFR) to monitor 
and control the granting and utilization 
of the fund. Whereas, Section 41 of the 
same Chapter vis-à-vis the pertinent 
portions of Volume II of the GAM 
for NGAs states that for agencies 
without complete set of books, the use 
of PCFR is necessary, which will be 
submitted to the Accounting 
Unit/Division to serve as basis in the 
preparation of the DVs or JEV. 

 P2,000.00 did not maintain 
PCFR. 

existing provision 
and may result to 
difficulty of 
monitoring and 
controlling the 
granting and 
utilization of the 
PCF. 

On maintenance of Cash Receipts 
Record (CRRec) 

 
Sections 39 and 40, Chapter 5 of the 
GAM for NGAs, Volume I provide the 
reporting and detailed procedures for 
the collections and deposits of the 
agency through its Collecting Officer. 
Whereas, the GAM for NGAs, Volume 
II (Accounting Books, Registries, 
Records, Forms and Reports) provides 
the updated form pertinent to his 
capacity as Accountable Officer. The 
CRRec shall be used by the designated 
collecting officer to record his/her 
collections and deposits. This record is 
used to monitor his/her accountability. 
All transactions for the day shall be 
recorded immediately and a balance 
(Undeposited Collection) shall be 
extracted. 

LTO-III The COs maintain Cash 
Receipt Register in lieu of 
CRRec. 

The non-maintenance 
CRRec is not in 
conformity with the 
said provisions which 
resulted to 
incomplete records 
and reports. 

On reconciliation of records of 
collections and deposits – 

 
Section 40, Chapter 5, Volume I of 
the GAM for NGAs details the 
procedures for collections and deposits 
through the CO. 

LTO-VI Comparison of Cash- 
Collecting Officer account 
balance against CRRec of all 
COs resulted in a difference 
of P4,351,332.55 which 
means that no reconciliation 
was done. Further it was also 
observed that the summary 
of collections and deposits in 
the CRRec has no 
breakdown or details as to 
how much were collected, 
deposited and balances for 
MVUC and LTO accounts. 

Non-reconciliation 
between       the 
Accounting  records 
and  the  CRRec 
rendered the Cash- 
Collecting Officers 
account doubtful and 
unreliable. And any 
difference between 
the said   reports 
cannot   be    easily 
detected      and 
corrected. 

On issuance of Official Receipts (ORs) 
–

136  

Existing Laws, Rules and 
Regulations 

Region/ 
Office Noted Deficiencies Effect 

Section 4 (h), Chapter 4, Volume I of 
the GAM for NGAs states that “Pre- 
numbered ORs shall be in strict 
numerical sequence. All copies of each 
receipt shall be exact copies or carbon 
reproduction in all respects of the 
original.” 

 computerized ORs in New 
Registration Unit were not in 
chronological order. 

The noted deficiency 
heightens the risk of 
misappropriation. 

On segregation of duties – 
 

Segregation of incompatible duties is 
indispensable in a system of internal 
control. Key duties such as 
authorization, custody and accounting 
shall be assigned to separate offices and 
individuals to eliminate opportunities 
to conceal errors and irregularities. 

LTO-VIII The PCF Custodian is at the 
same time the Accountant of 
the said office. Management 
justified that the Accountant 
was designated as the PCF 
Custodian in order to control 
unnecessary disbursements 
and at the same time check 
the completeness of 
supporting documents for 
faster processing of 
replenishments. 

On preparation of RAAF – 
 

Section 17 of Chapter 8, Volume I of 
the GAM for NGAs provides that 
“Report of Accountability for 
Accountable Forms (RAAF) (Appendix 
67) – shall be prepared by the 
Accountable Officer to report on the 
movement and status of accountable 
forms in his/her possession. The 
accountable forms include those with 
or without face value.” 

LTO-III The RAAF prepared and 
submitted by the Cashiers 
disclosed double reporting of 
ORs in the Receipt column 
and erroneous reporting of 
ending balance of ORs. 

The noted deficiency 
resulted       in      the 
inaccurate and 
unreliable reporting 
of accountable forms. 

 

2.15 We recommended that Management of LTO and LTFRB regional offices strictly 
adhere to the existing laws, rules and regulations in the handling and recording 
of cash collections and deposits not only to ensure the complete and accurate 
recording of collections and deposits in the books of accounts but also to prevent 
exposure of the concerned agencies to possible risk of loss and/or misuse of 
government funds and/or property. 

 
Management Comments: 

 
2.16 Management of LTO-XII commented that they have issued a stern warning to the 

Heads of Office and Cashiers concerned. In addition, they informed that they were 
prevented to enter into MOA with LBP local branches since this is done between 
LTO-SHO and LBP Central Office Officers. The determination of DOs and EOs that 
would qualify for the recommended arrangement is under the exclusive authority of 
LTO-SHO and not with the Regional Management. 



137  

2.17 Likewise, Management of LTO-III commented that a Regional Office Memorandum 
dated February 9, 2021 was issued directing all COs to comply with the preparation 
and maintenance of the CRRec and PCFR. 

 
 

INTER-AGENCY RECEIVABLES 
 

2.18 Audit of the Inter-agency Receivables account with a year-end balance of 
P36,896,973,899.56 disclosed accounting deficiencies with possible effects on the 
accuracy and reliability of the reported account balances on the agency’s financial 
statements. 

 
a. Unreconciled differences between confirmation replies and reported balances 

of Due from NGAs, Due from GOCCs and Due from LGUs accounts in the books 
– P2.348 billion 

 
2.19 In the DOTr-OSEC, confirmation replies from various Implementing Agencies (IAs) 

with outstanding unliquidated fund transfers as at year-end disclosed an unreconciled 
difference of P2,327,711,493.10 between its books of accounts and that of the IAs 
concerned. Details are shown in the following table:

2.20 From the foregoing, the books of DPWH and NEDA showed no reciprocal 
transactions recorded in the amount of P672,401.57 and P9,744,315.88, respectively. 
Review of the books of the DOTr disclosed that the recorded fund transfer to DPWH 
pertains to December 31, 1998 transaction for the Telecom Project CY 83-85 
Highways Telecom Projects, while for NEDA, it pertains to three transactions that 
took place on September 18 and June 30, 1987 for DOTC technical assistance and 
road classification study, and on October 06, 1986 for the Manila Port Development 
Strategies and Financial Statements (FS) for rail served inland container depots 
project. 

 
2.21 Meanwhile, the other unreconciled differences aggregating to P2,317,294,775.65 are 

attributed to the disbursements/utilizations of fund transfers already recorded by the 
IAs but are still unrecorded in the DOTr books due to non-submission of related 
liquidation reports by the IAs. 

 
2.22 Similarly, in the LTFRB-CO, confirmation with the Procurement Service (PS)-DBM 

disclosed an unreconciled difference between the balances per books of accounts of 
the LTFRB-CO and the PS-DBM as at December 31, 2020 in the amount of 
P20,749,863.17. 

 
2.23 It was noted that there were differences in the recorded amounts of payments and 

deliveries between the books of accounts of the LTFRB-CO and the PS-DBM in the 
amounts of P289,770.00 and P150,800.00, respectively. 

 
2.24 It is worthy to mention that the General Provisions of the annual General 

Appropriations Act, on the release and use of funds, require that all unexpended or 
undisbursed funds shall revert to the General Fund at the end of their validity period 
and shall not be available for expenditure except by subsequent legislative enactment. 
The fact that the common office supplies purchased were intended for use in the 
previous years and the requirements for the current year are duly allocated, it is 
appropriate that the cost of those undelivered common office supplies, if any, be 
refunded by the PS-DBM to the LTFRB-CO and subsequently be remitted to the BTr. 

 
2.25 We recommended that Management of the DOTr-OSEC and LTFRB-CO closely 

coordinate with the Accountants concerned of the DPWH, NEDA and PS-DBM 
in order to resolve the unreconciled balances with the books of the DOTr and 
LTFRB. If remained unresolved, (i) consider requesting for authority to write- 
off the dormant outstanding inter-agency receivables in accordance with COA 
Circular No. 2016-005; and (ii) demand from the identified IAs the submission 
of liquidation documents to facilitate the recording in the books of accounts. 

 
2.26 We also recommended that Management of LTFRB-CO request the PS-DBM 

Management, once the balances are reconciled, to refund any remaining balance 
from the purchases of common office supplies intended for use in the previous 
years and subsequently remit the same to the BTr. Likewise, continue to ensure 



139  

that all transactions with the PS-DBM are properly recorded in the books of 
accounts of the LTFRB-CO to avoid further discrepancies between their records. 

 
Management Comments: 

 
2.27 The LTFRB-CO FMD explained that the unreconciled difference of P150,800.00 

pertains to the cancelled check dated 06 January 2020 due to unavailability of supplies 
at the PS-DBM. Further, the discrepancy of P18,919,397.75 pertaining to the previous 
computerization project undertaken by the PS-DBM was already requested for write- 
off. However, the PS-DBM is still locating the supporting documents in order to 
request for its write-off from their books of accounts. On the other hand, the remaining 
balance with the PS-DBM will not be refunded but will be utilized for succeeding 
purchases. 

 
Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 
2.28 We emphasized our recommendation for the LTFRB-CO to request for the refund of 

the remaining balance from the PS-DBM since the common office supplies purchased 
were intended for use in the previous years and the requirements for the current and 
succeeding years are/or will be duly allocated. Hence, it is appropriate that the cost of 
those undelivered common office supplies, if any, be refunded to the LTFRB-CO and 
subsequently remitted to the BTr. 

 
b. Unsubstantiated inter-agency receivables – P3.390 million 

 
2.29 In the DOTr-CAR, the recorded amount of P3,372,848.95 to the account represents a 

receivable of the agency from the Philippine Postal Corporation (PPC). However, 
such recorded amount is not supported by concrete documents to assert and facilitate 
such claims. 

 
2.30 Relative thereto, in CY 2014 the previous Audit Team conducted a confirmation with 

the Audit Team of the PPC and showed that there is no outstanding liability to the 
DOTr-CAR appearing in the financial statements as at December 31, 2012 as well as 
in the General Ledgers and Trial Balance as at October 31, 2013 of the PPC. 
Accordingly, a follow-up letter was sent to PPC on January 30, 2020 but no reply has 
been received as at audit date. 

 
2.31 Further, the amount of P16,946.70 is merely being reported by the Accounting 

Division as “Funding Check”. The Accountant informed that it was already existing 
when she joined the agency and has no knowledge about it. 

 
2.32 We recommended that Management of the DOTr-CAR direct the Financial 

Division to document the request for write-off from the COA and/or adjustment 
of the Due from GOCC account totaling P3,372,848.95.

INVENTORIES 
 

2.33 The accuracy, completeness and existence of the recorded Inventories as at December 
31, 2020 amounting to P6,608,982,645.07 could not be ascertained due to various 
lapses in inventory management. 

 
2.34 Related audit and review of Inventories accounts disclosed several control 

deficiencies in the recording of transactions that rendered the reported account balance 
as at year-end unreliable. Details are shown in the following table: 

 
Lapses in Cash Management Region/Office 

a. Non-conduct of semi-annual physical inventory count 
of Inventories and non-submission of RPCI 

DOTr-OSEC, DOTr-CAR, 
LTO-II, IV-B, VI & VII, 
and LTFRB-II 

b. Non-reconciliation of accounting and property records

DOTr-OSEC, LTO-VI and 
LTFRB-II & X 

c. SLCs and SCs were not updated/maintained LTO-NCR and LTFRB-II 
d. Overlapping accountability LTO-III 

 
a. Non-conduct of semi-annual physical inventory count of Inventories and non- 

submission of RPCI 
 

2.35 Section 13, Chapter 8, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs requires the conduct of 
physical count of inventory semi-annually. Moreover, Appendix 66, Volume II of the 
same Manual prescribes the use of RPCI and requires submission thereof to the COA 
Auditor concerned not later than July 31 and January 31 of each year for the first and 
second semesters, respectively. 

 
2.36 In the DOTr-OSEC, audit of inventory accounts disclosed that Management was not 

able to conduct the required physical count of various inventories amounting to 
P3,574,484,172.99 as shown in Table 19, and was not able to submit the related RPCI 
as at December 31, 2020.

2.37 In LTFRB-II, verification of the Inventories account with a balance of P138,431.07 
as at year-end revealed that physical count of the inventories was also not conducted. 

 
2.38 Accordingly, it is emphasized that the conduct of physical count is an indispensable 

procedure aimed to establish the actual existence and condition of the assets. It is also 
a management control in checking the accuracy of accounting records and integrity of 
property custodianship. 

 
2.39 Referring to the preceding table, the Audit Team also wish to point out that the balance 

of the account Construction Materials for Distribution totaling P85,178,606.79 
pertains to the unused materials for Kayo ang Boss Ko (KBK) Toilet Facilities 
Improvement Project, which remained not fully counted despite being raised in 
previous years’ audit reports. Apparently, one of the reasons for the non-completion 
of the inventory count of these items is the location of storage facilities of these unused 
materials which are situated in various offices nationwide. 

 
2.40 Review and validation of Management’s compliance with the prior year’s 

recommendation relative to the Construction Materials Inventory (CMI) for the 
terminated Greater Manila Access (GMA) RoRo Ports Project with a year-end balance 
of P3,018,300,024.53 revealed that the inspection conducted on January 16, 2020 by 
the DOTr-PCG-PPA Task Team was limited only to ocular inspection due to safety 
considerations. Hence, no detailed physical count and inventory was executed and no 
RPCI was prepared. 

 
2.41 Furthermore, on the transfer and/or turnover of the GMA RoRo steel construction 

materials/accessories to the intended beneficiaries/users, the Audit Team was able to 
confirm that an agreement for its utilization is yet to be reached. It was provided that 
the steel materials are proposed to be donated to MMDA for the use on its EDSA Bike 
Lane Project. Moreover, the Audit Team was informed that a Mutual Agreement dated 
January 6, 2021 was entered into between the DOTr and the Philippine Merchant 
Marine Academy (PMMA) for the use of a one-hectare land inside the PMMA 
compound in Barangay Natividad, San Narciso, 2505 Zambales as storage area for 
the steel construction materials/accessories to aid the DOTr alleviate further 
accumulation of storage fees from the current storage in the SBMA Compound. 



142  

2.42 Meanwhile, in the DOTr-CAR and LTO-II, IV-B, VI and VII, the RPCI as at 
December 31, 2020 were not submitted, thus, existence, accuracy and completeness 
of the reported Inventory amounting to P2,485,221.08, P10,643,417.90, 
P7,375,352.85, P772,017.75, and P8,664.00 respectively, could not be ascertained. 

 
2.43 We recommended that Management instruct the Property Officers of the offices 

concerned to immediately undertake complete inventory count especially the 
unused construction materials of the KBK Toilet Facilities Improvement Project 
and to prepare/submit to the Office of the Auditor the related RPCI within the 
prescribed period as set forth under Appendix 66 of Volume II of the GAM for 
NGAs. 

 
2.44 In addition, we recommended that Management facilitate the approval of 

transfer/ turnover of the steel construction materials/accessories to the intended 
beneficiaries/ users for immediate utilization to avoid possible waste/loss and 
further accumulation of storage fees. 

 
Management Comments: 

 
2.45 Management of DOTr-OSEC commented that due to safety considerations in the 

conduct of physical inventory, the detailed inventory will be done during the pull out 
and transfer of the materials. As observed by Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority 
(SBMA) Engineers and Joint DOTr-PPCG-PPA Task Team, the stock filed steel 
materials already posed hazard as the dunnage support of it was already in advanced 
state of deterioration. 

 
2.46 Moreover, Management of DOTr-OSEC informed that the Department Secretary has 

signed the MOA between the DOTr and the SBMA which stipulates the pull out of 
the steel materials within the period of four months from Naval Supply Depot (NSD) 
of SBMA but without prejudice to the settlement of obligation incurred for storage of 
the said materials. 

 
2.47 For DOTr-CAR, Management reasoned that physical inventory was not conducted 

due to the pandemic and lack of manpower. 
 

b. Non-reconciliation of accounting and property records on Inventories 
 

2.48 Sections 9 and 17, Chapter 8, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs require the 
maintenance of SLC by the Accounting Division/Unit for each item in stock and 
prescribes the preparation of RPCI to report the physical count of inventories by type 
as at a given date. Accordingly, the reported Inventory balances in the financial 
statements as carried from SLCs should reconcile with RPCI. 



143  

2.49 In the DOTr-OSEC and LTO-VI, however, review of the inventory accounts reported 
as at year end did not reconcile with the balances presented in the RPCI submitted. 
Details are shown in the following table.

2.50 Variances totaling P158,231,217.85 between the reported balances of Inventory in the 

financial statements and RPCI revealed that no reconciliation were conducted, thus, 
accuracy and existence of the related inventories could not be ascertained. 

 
2.51 In LTFRB-X, review of the Inventories account showed that Report of Supplies and 

Materials Issued (RSMIs) were not prepared and submitted to the Accounting Unit 
for the issuance of office supplies and accountable forms from the Supply Office 
amounting to P548,698.78 and P81,732.00, respectively, which affects the reliability 
and accuracy of the reported year-end balance of Inventories. 

 
2.52 In LTFRB-II, it was noted that the agency did not submit the RPCI as at year-end due 

to the non-conduct of physical count of inventory. 
 

2.53 We recommended that Management direct the Supply Officers and Accountants 
concerned to reconcile their reports/records and effect any necessary 



144  

adjustment/s, if warranted, in order to come up with an accurate, complete and 
reliable report pursuant to pertinent provisions of the GAM for NGAs. 

 
c. SLCs and SCs were not updated/maintained 

 
2.54 Section 17, Chapter 8, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs provides for the preparation 

and/or maintenance of various records which include SLC and SC, among others. 
Both SLC and SC shall be used to record materials/supplies received, issued and the 
balance both in quantity and amount at any time and shall be maintained by the 
Accounting Division/Unit and Property and/or Supply Division/Unit, respectively, for 
each kind of supplies and materials. 

 
2.55 In DOTr-CAR, review of records disclosed incomplete postings of receipts and 

issuances in SLCs resulting in negative and unreconciled balances. Further, since the 
SLCs were not updated, the Accounting Unit, in recording the issuances, resorted to 
using the Unit Cost and Amount in the RSMIs which were calculated by the Supply 
Unit using the First-In, First-Out method. In addition, SCs have not been updated for 
CYs 2019 and 2020 transactions. Instead, the Supply Unit prepares monthly reports 
called “Balances of Office Supplies” which merely show the unissued balances of all 
kinds of office supplies at month-end. 

 
2.56 In the LTO-NCR, examination of SLCs disclosed that the required forms were not 

updated which hindered the recognition of impairment of 295,507 pieces of obsolete 
validation sticker and plate year tag with an estimated value totaling P4,300,082.35. 
The concerned Accounting Section personnel informed that the updating of SLCs is 
on-going particularly on those items that have significant and material amount. 
Nonetheless, the non-maintenance of SLC affected the fair presentation of the 
Accountable Forms, Plates and Stickers Inventory account as at year-end. 

 
2.57 In the LTFRB-II, it was noted that SLCs and SCs were not maintained by the 

Accounting and Supply Offices, respectively, as required. 
 

2.58 We recommended that Management direct the Accounting Section personnel 
concerned and Supply/Property Officer to prepare and/or maintain an SLC and 
SC, respectively, for each and every kind of supplies and materials procured to 
ensure that the Inventory account balances recorded in the Statement of 
Financial Position is accurate, correct and properly valued. 

 
Management Comments: 

 
2.59 Management agreed on the recommendation. Further, Management of DOTr-CAR 

informed that the Supply Division is on the process of updating the SCs. 



145  

d. Overlapping accountability 
 

2.60 Meanwhile, in LTO-III, examination of the Motor Vehicle Miscellaneous 
Registration Receipt (MVMRR) as per RAAF (by Cashier) and Accountability Report 
on Forms (by Supply Officer) showed overlapping accountability as the Supply 
Officer issues MVMRR on a per piece basis while the Cashier reports the serial 
number of the whole booklet in her RAAF. Therefore, at the end of the month, the 
reported balance in the said documents do not tally with the actual inventory of 
accountable forms on hand of the Cashier and the Supply Officer. 

 
2.61 We recommended that Management of LTO-III require the cashier and the 

Supply Officer to regularly conduct reconciliation of their records to guarantee 
accuracy of the report and cause the necessary adjustment in the RAAF. 

 
Management Comments: 

 
2.62 Management assured the Audit Team that they will capacitate the concerned 

employees by conducting training within the year in the preparation of RAAF and 
other related accounting reports. 

 
 

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (PPE) 
 

2.63 Deficiencies in recording and reporting financial transactions resulting from lack of 
reconciliation of accounting and property records and lapses in internal controls 
affected the reliability, accuracy and completeness and valuation of the reported PPE 
account balances in the financial statements. 

 
2.64 Audit of PPE accounts disclosed several accounting deficiencies which requires 

further analysis, reconciliation, physical count/verification, coordination and future 
corrective actions with possible effects in the reliability, accuracy, completeness and 
valuation of the reported PPE account balances in the financial statements. The 
deficiencies noted are summarized in the following table.

a. Unsupported dropping of PPE accounts – P3.723 billion 
 

2.65 Section 42 (j), Chapter 10, Volume I and Appendix 76, Volume II, of the GAM for 
NGAs require the use of the Property Transfer Report (PTR) every time there will be 
transfer of property from an outgoing officer to his successor or from one accountable 
officer/employee to another of the same or another entity. 

 
2.66 In DOTr-OSEC, verification disclosed that Management dropped a total of 21 projects 

with a carrying amount of P3,660,761,896.92 in the books of account despite absence 
of the required PTR as can be seen in Appendix 1. The derecognition of the projects 
was only supported by certificates of project completion and certificates of acceptance 
attached to the JEV. 

 
2.67 Although the details as required in the PTR is substantiated by the supporting JEV 

and computation of carrying values for the subject transfer, it is necessary that 
Management comply with the required PTR to support the derecognition of assets 
pursuant to Section 42(j), Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs. 

 
2.68 Moreover, our audit also disclosed that out of the 97 units of motor vehicle valued at 

P68,152,845.28 which are already transferred and accepted by the end-users and 
subsequently dropped and/or derecognized from the books of the DOTr-OSEC, only 
6 thereof with total value of P5,078,365.44 were confirmed by the recipient (LTO- 
IV-B) to have been recorded in its books through the submission of a copy of its 
General Ledger. The remaining 91 units transferred to DICT and PCG amounting 
P51,513,546.59 and P11,560,933.25, respectively, still lack the necessary JEVs from 
the recipient agencies. Details are shown in Table 22.

2.69 Upon follow up on the submission of JEVs for the transferred motor vehicles, the 

Accounting Division informed that they will coordinate with the Accounting Division 
of recipient agencies and will request for a copy of their JEVs on the recording of the 
received motor vehicles. 

 
2.70 We recommended that Management of the DOTr-OSEC prepare the required 

PTRs indicating the details of the transferred projects, and coordinate with the 
recipient agencies for the acceptance thereof and for it to submit its JEV 
recording the received assets together with other pertinent documents. 

 
Management Comments: 

 
2.71 Management commented that the PTRs for recently completed projects were being 

handled by PMS. In addition, the Management Division shall be requested to 
formulate/update the procedures on transfer of completed projects and identify the 
proper office to prepare the PTR. 

 
b. Unrecorded Lots donated to the LTO-CAR District Offices and LTFRB-CAR were 

not supported by any documents evidencing ownership which may be subjected 
to disputes due to titling and appraisal issues in the future 

 
2.72 Section 11, Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs provides that for PPE 

acquired through a non-exchange transaction such as donation, presidential 
proclamations, taxes, transfer and grants, its cost shall be measured at its fair market 
value as at the date of acquisition. 

 
2.73 Inquiry and review of documents disclosed that lots occupied by LTO-CAR DOs and 

LTFRB-CAR were donated by other government agencies and a private individual, 
details of which are as follows: 

 
Location/ 

Particulars Remarks 

LTO–Pacdal, 
Baguio City 

Donated by TELOF-CAR, which is now under the DICT, per Supplemental 
MOA made and entered into by and among the DOTC-CAR, now DOTr- 
CAR; DPWH-CAR; and TELOF-CAR. 

1,700 sq.m, 
more or less, per 
MOA 

 
There is no copy of the Deed of Donation or other transfer documents on file. 



148  

Location/ 
Particulars Remarks 

LTO–Bontoc,

Donated by the Province of Mt. Province per Office of the Provincial Board 
Resolution No. 1502 dated December 19, 1963 and Deed of Donation 
executed on April 21, 1964. 

LTO–Tabuk,

LTO–Luna, 
Apayao 

 
3,000 sq.m per 
MOA 

Awarded and allotted by the Local Government of Luna, Apayao per MOA 
dated January 28, 2019 entered into by and between the Local Government of 
Luna, Apayao and LTO–Apayao, represented by the former OIC Regional 
Director of the DOTr-CAR. As stated also in the MOA, the LTO–Apayao 
shall be responsible in the titling procedures of the lot and shall bear all fees 
and other obligations relative thereto. 

LTO–Lamut, 
Ifugao 

Inquiry and previous audit reports disclosed that the lot of LTO in Ifugao and 
LTFRB in Baguio City were donated by a private individual and the TELOF- 
CAR, respectively. 

 
There is no copy of the Deeds of Donation or other transfer documents on file. 

LTFRB–Pacdal, 
Baguio City 

 

2.74 According to the Accounting Division, the aforementioned donations have not been 
recorded in the books due to the absence of ownership documents such as Certificates 
of Title, Deeds of Donation, and/or other transfer documents; and the non-conduct of 
appraisal to determine their fair market values. Further, it was noted that foregoing 
donations were transacted as early as 1964 but the titling of the property has not been 
processed as at audit date. 

 
2.75 On the other hand, the lot with an area of 1,000.00 sq.m occupied by the LTO Benguet 

District Office was covered by a Contract of Lease executed with the Province of 
Benguet on December 21, 1995. Under the said Contract, the rental fee per annum is 
P1.00, which was never paid by the DOTr-CAR since the effectivity of the contract, 
and the lease period is for 25 years. Since the expiration of the Contract in December 
2020, it was not noted that Management acted on its renewal or submitted its intent to 
avail the lot. 

 
2.76 For the lot where the building of the LTO Abra District Office was constructed, it was 

informed that the ownership is retained by the Local Government of Abra. There is 
no MOA or any equivalent document found on file to support the utilization of the 
property by the LTO Abra District Office. 

 
2.77 It bears to emphasize that the noted laxities in the titling of the donated land and in 

securing pertinent documents relative to the use of the other lots, the ownership and 
occupation are vulnerable to possible disturbances and challenges from other parties 
in the future. 



149  

2.78 We recommended that Management: 
 

a. create a committee which shall (i) secure all related records and documents 
from the donors and/or the Registry of Deeds/Office of the Assessor where 
the donated property is located to facilitate the transfer of titles in the name 
of the DOTr-CAR; and (ii) monitor the period of effectivity of all contracts 
executed with owners of occupied lots to ensure their timely renewal; and 

 
b. hire a qualified appraiser to determine the fair market values of the donated 

lots which will be the basis of the Accounting Division to record in the 
Books. 

 
Management Comments: 

 
2.79 During the exit conference, the OIC Assistant Regional Director of LTO–CAR 

informed that offices concerned have been instructed to secure the Deeds of Donation, 
Contract of Lease, and/or MOA from the identified donors, Registry of Deeds, and/or 
owners of occupied lots. In like manner, the OIC Regional Director of the LTFRB– 
CAR also commented that for the lot in Pacdal occupied by the LTFRB-CAR and 
shared with LTO-CAR, an inquiry with the DICT (then TELOF) was made which 
informed that no document relative to the donation has been located. She informed 
that since TELOF was then attached to the DOTr, a formal agreement may not have 
been executed at that time. 

 
c. Non-reconciliation between Accounting and Property Records – P15.140 

million 
 

2.80 Likewise, COA Circular No. 2020-006 dated January 31, 2020 prescribes the 
guidelines and procedures on inventory taking, recognition of those found at station 
and disposition for non-existing/missing PPE items for the one-time cleansing of PPE 
accounts of government agencies to establish reliable and accurate PPE balances. 
Further, the Property and Accounting Units shall undertake collaborative procedures 
to ensure that all PPE included in the Report on Physical Count of PPE (RPCPPE) are 
duly recorded in their respective records and that the PCs maintained by the Property 
Unit and the PPELCs maintained by the Accounting Unit are reconciled, to come up 
with the reconciled balances of PPE accounts to be considered as the correct balance 
of the agency’s PPE. 

 
2.81 Section 42, Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs prescribes the use of the 

RPCPPE which shall be rendered on a yearly basis and be reconciled with the records 
of the Accounting Division. 

 
2.82 In the DOTr-CAR, comparison of the costs of PPE items recorded in the books as 

against the costs reflected in the RPCPPE disclosed a total variance of P13,955,682.80 
which comprised of the unsubstantiated cost in the Buildings account amounting to 



150  

P6,914,741.90 and the unreconciled variance from costs of laser engravers and 
fingerprint scanners in the documents received from the LTO-SHO amounting to 
P7,040,940.90. 

 
2.83 Furthermore, in the LTO-NCR and LTO-III, IVB, V, VI, VII, and XII, comparison of 

the PPE accounts balances between the Accounting and Property records disclosed 
non-reconciliation of the same which is attributable to the non-maintenance of the 
required Accounting and Property records. 

 
2.84 Similarly, in the LTFRB-VI and IX, review of the PPE account balances revealed that 

there were unreconciled differences between the books of accounts and the RPCPPE 
amounting to P953,525.40 and P230,701.13, respectively, or a total of P1,184,226.53, 
thereby affecting the reliability of the reported year-end balances of the PPE accounts. 

 
2.85 We recommended that Management of the offices concerned instruct the 

Accounting and Supply Divisions to: (a) have a periodic reconciliation of PPE 
accounts; and (b) undertake the one-time cleansing of PPE accounts by strictly 
following the guidelines and procedures of COA Circular No. 2020-006. 

 
d. Accounting and Property records were not properly maintained/updated and 

submitted. 
 

2.86 Section 42, Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs enumerates the forms/reports 
necessary to account for PPE such as Property Card (PC), PPE Ledger Card (PPELC), 
Property Acknowledgement Receipt (PAR), RPCPPE and Inventory and Inspection 
Report for Unserviceable Property (IIRUP). 

 
2.87 Related audit of the PPE accounts in DOTr–OSEC, LTO and LTFRB regional offices 

disclosed non-preparation/maintenance of Accounting and Property Records listed in 
the following table, which hindered reconciliation, recognition of impairment, and 
recording of adjustments, as necessary.

Unserviceable properties have not been 
reported in the IIRUP and remained 
undisposed of as at year-end. 

The properties were exposed to further 
deterioration and are continuously 
incurring additional storage costs. 
Likewise, the accountable officers are 
still not relieved of their accountabilities 
for such properties. 

 

2.88 We recommended that Management of DOTr-OSEC, LTO and LTFRB offices: 
(a) require the Supply Officer/Property Officer and the Accountant to maintain 
the required Accounting and Property records; (b) require the Accountants to 
provide impairment on unserviceable properties and to record the dropping 
thereof in the books upon disposal; and (c) immediately process the disposal of 
those unserviceable properties. 

 
2.89 Moreover, require the Management of LTFRB-X and XII to: (a) regularly 

conduct the annual physical count of their PPEs; and (b) prepare and submit 
their RPCPPEs to their respective Auditing Units. 

 
Management Comments: 

 
2.90 The DOTr–OSEC commented that the Accounting Division has already completed 

the reconciliation of RPCPPE with the books of accounts. The Property Utilization 
and Disposal Division (PUDD) will be furnished a copy of the report for its 
appropriate action before submission to the Audit Team. 

 
 

OTHER NON-CURRENT ASSETS - MVUC 
 

2.91 Section 79 of PD No. 1445 permits the disposal of unserviceable government 
property, through destruction if the property is valueless or unsalable, or sale if the 
property is valuable, as determined after inspection by the head of the agency or his 
duly authorized representative in the presence of the auditor concerned. The disposal 
shall be conducted in the presence of the auditor concerned or other duly authorized 
representative of COA. 



152  

2.92 Item V of COA Circular No. 89-296 provides the different modes of divestment or 
disposal of property and other assets of government entities. 

 
2.93 Further, Section 40 (d) Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs provides that all 

unserviceable property shall be reported in the IIRUP. The IIRUP form which is to be 
prepared by the Supply and/or Property Unit and be the basis of the Accounting 
Division in dropping the unserviceable properties from the books is provided in 
Appendix 74, Volume II of the GAM for NGAs. 

 
2.94 The Audit Team evaluated the Management’s actions and/or compliance to our prior 

year’s recommendations which advised the Management to require the DOTr 
Disposal Committee and PUDD to facilitate the immediate disposal of the 
unserviceable properties; to prepare the corresponding IIRUP for submission to the 
Accounting Division; and to prepare/submit Inventory Report on the physical count 
of said properties. 

 
2.95 Congruent thereto, review of the submitted Financial Statements for the DOTr- 

OSEC, Fund Cluster 03 and its books of accounts revealed that its Other Non-Current 
Assets which pertains to the unserviceable properties amounting to P148,902.99 were 
not yet dropped from the books. The details of the unserviceable properties are 
summarized in the following table.

2.96 Inquiry with the Accounting Division revealed that a new Disposal Committee was 

constituted under DOTr Special Order No. 2021-002 dated January 4, 2021. However, 
no disposal was undertaken and no IIRUP was prepared and submitted to their Office 
that will be the basis to record the dropping of the unserviceable properties from the 



153  

books. Further, the Audit Team was informed that the above list of obsolete and 
unserviceable properties was not yet submitted to the said Disposal Committee. 

 
2.97 Inquiry with the PUDD personnel confirmed that no disposal was undertaken in CY 

2020 and the last disposal made by the DOTr was in December 2019. In addition, the 
Inventory Report on physical or actual count of the aforesaid properties was still 
unsubmitted to our office. 

 
2.98 It is worthy to mention that the prolonged non-disposal of the above listed 

obsolete/unserviceable assets exposes them to further deterioration and loss of 
economic value, thus, depriving the agency of the proceeds that may be derived from 
the sale thereof, if any. 

 
2.99 We reiterated our recommendation that Management of the DOTr-OSEC 

require the DOTr Disposal Committee: (a) facilitate the immediate disposal of 
the obsolete and unserviceable properties; (b) prepare the corresponding IIRUP 
for submission to the Accounting Division to record the dropping from the 
books; and (c) prepare/submit Inventory Report on the physical count of said 
properties. 

 
Management Comments: 

 
2.100 Management of DOTr-OSEC acknowledged the audit observations and provided the 

following: 
 

a. The IIRUP for CY 2020 was already prepared together with the Summary Report 
of Unserviceable Properties; 

 
b. They are yet to submit the same to the DOTr- Disposal Committee pending the 

receipt of formal written request from other attached agencies for possibly 
donating/transferring to them the DOTr’s unserviceable properties (i.e., 
derecognition via non-exchange transactions and/or at an appraised value) per 
verbal requests made; and 

 
c. If and when requests are formalized and received, the PUDD necessitates to 

segregate subject properties for transfer for the IIRUP and transferred without 
cost to requesting attached agencies of the Department. After which, the revised 
Report/IIRUP shall be endorsed to DOTr’s Disposal Committee for other and/or 
alternative modes of disposal.

INTER-AGENCY PAYABLES 
 

2.101 The validity and reliability of the recorded Inter-agency Payables account could not 
be established due to noted deficiencies as summarized in the following table: 

 
Deficiencies Region/Office Amount (in Php) 

a) Dormant Due to NGAs account balance DOTr-OSEC 368,737,103.17

Total  1,443,089,854.51 

 
a. Dormant Due to NGAs account balance – P368.737 million 

 
2.102 COA Circular No. 97-001 provides the guidelines on the proper disposition or closure 

of dormant funds and/or accounts. Under the said Circular, dormant accounts are 
defined as individual or group of accounts which balances remained non-moving for 
more than five years. Accordingly, dormant accounts in an active fund shall be 
reviewed, analyzed and reconciled together with the other related accounts in the trial 
balance. If the analysis/review of the accounts/funds is not possible due to absence of 
records and documents, the agency head concerned should request for write-off and/or 
adjustment of account balances from the COA, supported by list of available records 
and extent of validation made on the accounts, and certification and reasons why the 
Books of accounts/records, financial statements/ schedules and supporting 
vouchers/documents cannot be located. 

 
2.103 In the DOTr-OSEC, audit disclosed that the Due to NGAs account balance amounting 

to P368,737,103.17 comprising of: (i) acquisition of second-hand buses by various 
transport cooperatives amounting to P215,586,842.84; and (ii) accumulated balance 
of Legal Research Fees (LRFs) amounting to P153,150,260.33, remained outstanding 
and/or dormant in the books for 16 to more than 25 years. 

 
2.104 Congruent thereto, Management has submitted on February 13, 2020 a Request for 

Write-off of its Receivables account counterpart from the four transport cooperatives, 
however, the same was returned by the concerned Audit Team through a letter dated 
March 11, 2020. 

 
2.105 On the other hand, as regards the accumulated balance of LRFs, Management 

informed that they have requested the University of the Philippines Law Center 
(UPLC) that the subject LRFs be reverted to the surplus account of the National 
Government since these were already deposited with the National Treasury but have 
taken up in the books as trust receipt. Once the request for reversion to the National 
Treasury is granted, the trust receipt account shall be adjusted accordingly. 



155  

2.106 We recommended that Management of the DOTr-OSEC: 
 

a. prioritize the preparation of the required documents to support the Request 
for Write-off of Receivable Accounts counterpart of the abovementioned 
liability account balance and immediately submit the same to the Audit 
Team for review, evaluation and appropriate action/s pursuant to COA 
Circular No. 2016-005; and 

 
b. furnish the Audit Team with a copy of the request made to UPLC on the 

reversion of the LRFs to the surplus account of the National Government 
and closely coordinate with the UPLC on the matter at hand so as to 
facilitate the immediate settlement of the long outstanding balance of Due 
to NGAs – UPLC account. 

 
b. Long outstanding unliquidated fund transfer – P1.074 billion 

 
2.107 Section 63, Chapter 6, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs provides as follows: 

 
“Within ten (10) days after the end of each month/end of the agreed period for the 
Project, the IA shall submit the Report of Checks Issued (RCI) and the Report of 
Cash Disbursements (RCDisb) to report the utilization of the funds. Only actual 
project expenses shall be reported. The reports shall be approved by the Head of the 
IA. 

 
The IA shall return to the SA any unused balance upon completion of the project, if 
stipulated in the MOA.” 

 
2.108 The significant amount of the unliquidated fund transfer in LTO-SHO for two years 

pertains to the funds received from DOTr intended for the implementation of the 
DOTr Road Transportation Information Technology Infrastructure Project, which as 
at audit date is still on-going. Despite the non-liquidation of the full amount of the 
fund transfers granted in CYs 2017-2019 amounting to P1,676,395,064.00, the LTO- 
SHO still received from the DOTr an additional fund transfer in CY 2020 amounting 
to P540,277,011.27 for the implementation of various projects. Details are shown in 
Table 25.

2.109 Furthermore, contributory factors on the delayed utilization of the fund transfers 
which resulted in the non-liquidation of the same as at year-end include the following: 

 
 Timing of release made by the DOTr for the implementation of the I-ACT 

operation which was received by LTO-SHO on December 23, 2020 which 
affected the efficiency of the LTO as the Procuring Entity and End-user to 
procure and implement the said Project; 

 Delayed implementation of the DOTr Road Transportation Information 
Technology Infrastructure Project; and 

 Failure of the Regional Accountants to submit the liquidation documents due to 
the delayed implementation on the rehabilitation of various LTO 
regional/district offices nationwide. 

 
2.110 Additionally, in the DOTr-OSEC, audit disclosed fund transfer to LTFRB-X, Marina 

Region X and Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) in relation to the President’s Social Fund 
(PSF) – Sendong amounting to P141,000.00, which remained unliquidated for more 
than five years. 

 
2.111 On this note, Management informed that several call-up letters starting CYs 2018 up 

to 2020 were sent to the agencies concerned to follow-up the long outstanding 
unliquidated fund transfers, however, no response was received by the DOTr as at 
audit date. 



157  

2.112 We recommended that Management of LTO-SHO to: 
 

a. coordinate closely with the DOTr to ensure the proper timing of 
subsequent fund transfers that would allow the LTO to effectively and 
efficiently execute the required procurement activities for the project 
within the same fiscal year and avoid accumulation thereof; 

 
b. fast track the implementation of the DOTr Road Transportation 

Information Technology Infrastructure Project to warrant timely 
liquidation of the outstanding balances of the inter-agency payables 
immediately upon project completion and refund any unutilized portions 
thereof to the Source Agency; and 

 
c. require the Accountants of the regional/district offices to submit the 

liquidation documents of the funds received and return to BTr the 
unexpended balance, if any. 

 
2.113 Likewise, we recommended that Management of DOTr-OSEC exhaust all 

remedies to compel the agencies concerned to submit liquidation reports for the 
President’s Social Fund – Sendong, otherwise elevate and/or refer the matter to 
the Department’s Legal Division for appropriate action to facilitate the 
settlement thereof. 

 
Management Comments: 

 
2.114 Management of LTO-SHO informed that as at February 8, 2021, they have already 

liquidated the amount of P4,146,388,908.82, equivalent to 83.44% of 
P4,969,371,466.26 total amount granted, leaving an unliquidated balance of 
P822,982,557.44. They also informed that they had coordinated with the Management 
of I-ACT, DOTr-FMS and Controllership Service for the proper release of funds 
implementation activities. As at March 31, 2021, the balance of I-ACT was reduced 
further to P6,448.181.17. Further, Memoranda were already sent to the concerned 
Accountants of regional offices to submit the liquidation documents of the funds 
received and to return any unexpended balance to the BTr, if any. 

 
Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 
2.115 The Audit Team appreciates the Management’s effort on the partial liquidation of the 

fund transfer received by LTO from DOTr. However, our recommendation shall be 
considered complied with only upon submission of the complete liquidation report, 
hence we request submission thereof for further evaluation. 

 
2.116 The commitment of the Management of LTO to take appropriate measures to 

implement our recommendation shall be monitored by the Audit Team.

GUARANTY/SECURITY DEPOSITS PAYABLE 
 

2.117 Item 3.3 of COA-DBM Joint Circular (JC) No. 99-06 states that all undocumented 
A/Ps, regardless of the year they were incurred, shall immediately be reverted to the 
Cumulative Result of Operations-Unappropriated (CROU) now Accumulated Surplus 
(Deficit). 

 
2.118 Item 3.4 of the same COA-DBM JC stated that Payables representing unliquidated 

advances, prepayments and deposits shall be reviewed and appropriate adjustments 
accordingly taken in the books of accounts in accordance with accounting and 
auditing rules and regulations. 

 
2.119 Moreover, item 3.5 of the said COA-DBM JC directs the reversion of all Foreign 

Assisted Projects (FAPs)-Accounts Payable which have remained outstanding for two 
years after the completion date of the project per loan/grant documents to the CROU, 
now Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit). 

 
2.120 Further, EO No. 87, s. 2019, directs the automatic reversion of all documented APs 

which remain outstanding for at least two years and for which no actual administrative 
or judicial claim has been filed, and all undocumented APs regardless of the year in 
which they were incurred. 

 
2.121 Review of the SLs disclosed that the recorded liabilities amounting to P13,458,368.22 

have long been overdue for release since the projects to which these retention fees 
relate were already completed. Details are shown in Table 26.

2.122 As can be noted above, the related DOTr-OSEC’s APs remained outstanding for more 
than two years already after the completion of the project, hence, already due for 
reversion  pursuant to  item 3.5 of  DBM –  COA JC No. 99-06  and Section 1 of  EO 
No. 87. 



159  

2.123 Inquiry from the DOTr-OSEC’s Accounting Division revealed that the contractor has 
not yet submitted the claim for the Guaranty/Security Deposit and that there are no 
longer documents available on record to support the above Other Payables. Also, the 
concerned Project Management Offices were already abolished. Hence, they have no 
other alternative way of obtaining documents for their assessment and analysis. 

 
2.124 Moreover, LTO-SHO retention fees amounting to P12,839,049.50 were not supported 

with actual valid claims and no records were available to support the same. Likewise, 
LTO-Region VIII retention fees amounting to P37,442.50 remained outstanding for 
over three years and there are no records on file that to prove the liability or name of 
the claimant. 

 
2.125 On the other hand, the dormant Guaranty/Security Deposits Payable account of the 

DOTr-CAR amounting to P45,960.00 refers to the retention fee of BIOS IT Solutions, 
Inc., which should have been forfeited and derecognized from books following the 
cancellation of the contract in CY 2013; whereas the amount of P139,661.18 reported 
as retention fee of Nicolas Jift Corporation should have been assessed and reviewed 
to determine its validity. Based on inquiry, it appears that no review and analysis on 
the said account has been conducted by the Accounting Division despite such 
dormancy in the books. 

 
2.126 We recommended that Management of the DOTr-OSEC, CAR and LTO direct 

the officers/unit concerned to review and verify the undocumented and 
documented Payables and to follow up with the Contractors to provide them the 
opportunity to claim the amount, if feasible. If none responded, require the Chief 
Accountant to prepare journal entry for the reversion of the amounts to 
Accumulated Surplus to reflect the correct balance of the accounts. 

 
Management Comments: 

 
2.127 The DOTr OSEC Chief Accountant informed the Audit Team that the contractor has 

submitted its claim for the release of Guaranty/Security Deposits Payable (10% 
Retention Money) and a Disbursement Voucher was prepared for the release of the 
retention money. 

 
2.128 The DOTr OSEC Chief Accountant also commented that the Other Payables account 

is covered by a deposit to the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Palawan. Accordingly, 
they shall request the RTC to refund the cash deposited in the LBP Puerto Princesa 
Branch, and furnish the COA with a copy. 

 
2.129 Management of LTO-SHO commented that contractors/suppliers with unclaimed 

retention fees shall be notified in writing to collect their outstanding claims, and shall 
be given five working days from the receipt thereof for the release of their 
guaranty/security deposit. Moreover, Accounting Section shall revert the account 



160  

balance to the Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) account the balance of the retention 
money, which will remain unclaimed after they have been notified. 

 
Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 
2.130 COA-LTO will monitor the commitment of Management to release and/or revert 

unclaimed retention fees, long-outstanding and undocumented payables.

3.8 For DOTr-OSEC, the low obligation rates for Agency Specific Budget were due to the 
following: 

 
a. Decrease in the total number of buses used for I-ACT operations due to the 

COVID-19 pandemic; 
b. Various machinery and equipment were not procured though included in the 

approved Annual Procurement Plan (APP) during the year due to lack of 
documents; 

c. Late release of Special Allotment Release Order (SARO) by DBM for the 
implementation of Right-of-Way (ROW) activities; 

d. Local and foreign travels were controlled due to COVID-19 pandemic; 
e. No claims received from Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) for the payment 

of arbitration cases; 
f. Decrease in the utilization of funds for the electricity, water and security services 

of the DOTr-MRT 3 mainly due to its non-operations during Enhanced 
Community Quarantine (ECQ) / Modified Enhanced Community Quarantine 
(MECQ); 

g. Various vacant positions which were not filled during the year; and 
h. Delay in the procurement activities. 

 
3.9 For LTO, Management informed that the main reason for the low disbursement rate 

for CY 2020 was due to the COVID-19 pandemic causing physical restrictions which 
prevented the office to fully disbursed its allotment. Management procurement 
processes were halted by the lockdowns and community quarantines. Nevertheless, 
since the restrictions are now easing up, Management are slowly adapting to this new 
normal, its operations are now gaining traction and hopeful that they can recover from 
last year’s setbacks. Management also informed that a Finance Committee was created 
to oversee and monitor the expenses of the Office including the preparation of the 
Annual Procurement Plan as well as the scheduling of procurement of major projects 
of the agency. 

 
3.10 For LTFRB-CO, Management explained that most of the unpaid obligations were due 

to the non-collection by the agency’s creditors/suppliers who were not sending their 
respective bills for payment and the non-availability of cash at the RFROs which 
resulted in the non-payment of payables. 

 
Projects 

 
3.11 The DOTr-OSEC received total allotments of P70,272,683,435.85 in CY 2020 in order 

to finance the implementation of the 81 locally and foreign-assisted projects. Of the 
total allotments, P68,937,625,185.80 or 98.10% was obligated and 
P10,455,035,398.94 or equivalent to 15.17% of the total obligations was disbursed as 
at year-end. Details are shown in Table 29.

3.12 Further in audit, we noted that the unobligated balance of P1,335,058,250.05 for 

projects pertain to (i) unobligated allotment for Ormoc Airport which is currently on 
hold for award pending resolution of the protest filed by one of the bidders; 
(ii) unobligated balance for New Cebu International Container Port Project (NCICPP) 
due to the on-going procurement of civil works and delayed project implementation as 
a result of the pandemic; (iii) unobligated balance for the Mindanao Railway Project, 
due to prioritizing the obligation of continuing funds over the current project allotment; 
and (iv) result of savings from biddings of various projects. 

 
3.13 Moreover, 56 out of the 81 projects have less than 20% disbursement rates, with 

Maritime Infrastructure Program taking the lead in terms of number of projects and 
Rail Transport Program if measured in terms of allotments. These are presented in the 
following table.

3.15 The Management provided the following reasons for the low disbursement of locally- 

funded projects: 
 

a. There were delays in the release of SARO which delayed the procurement 
process or the execution of MOA in case of fund transfers; 

b. The Department still implements the “No Advance Payment” policy to 
contractors; 



166  

c. As at end of 2020, projects that are to be implemented by offices outside DOTr 
have no signed MOA, hence, initial fund transfers cannot be made; 

d. Progress billings of contractors may be submitted for payment once the 20% 
physical accomplishment is attained but some contractors opted to bill when 
accomplishments are more than 20%; and 

e. Disbursements are mainly programmed and spilled over in 2021. 
 

3.16 Moreover, the following reasons for the low disbursement of foreign-assisted projects 
were provided: 

 
Table 32: Reason/s for the Low Disbursement of FAPs 

Project Reason/s for Low Disbursement 
a. Metro Manila Subway 

Project Phase I 
Non-claiming of progress billings and decrease in expected VAT payment 
for Advance Payment of CP107 and non-disbursement of CP106 

b. MRT-3 Rehabilitation 
Project 

The rehabilitation and maintenance contractor deferred claiming payments 
for works covering March 17 to September 16, 2020 due to the imposition of 
Enhanced Community Quarantine. 

c. PNR South Commuter The amount is obligated for VAT portion of the progress payments of the 
General Consultant (GC) which is billed monthly. However, initial 
projections were larger than actual billed amounts. Thus, remaining obligated 
balance shall be disbursed once the GC submits their claims for payment. 

d. North-South 
Commuter Railway 
System 

Contractor’s claims for payment for their monthly progress billings were less 
than their programmed amounts. Therefore, remaining obligated balance will 
be used for progress billings of the contractor for late-2020 and 2021. 

e. PNR South Long-Haul 
Project 

Low disbursement is due to China Railway Design Corporation (CRDC) 
claiming only for one billing period. 

f.   Mindanao Railway 
Project 

Utilization of continuing fund was prioritized over the current project 
allotment. Undisbursed funds will be fully utilized in CY 2021. 

g.  New Cebu 
International Container 
Port Project 

The amount obligated was broken down into Consultancy and ROWA. There 
was no billing submitted yet from the consultant and no basis yet to disburse 
for the ROWA. 

h.  Maritime  Safety 
Capability 
Improvement Project 
Phase II (MSCIP P2) 

The OIC Director, Comptrollership Service commented that the 
Disbursements in their submitted FAR No. 1 are purely GOP disbursements 
and do not include the disbursements on the loan proceeds. Despite their 
numerous requests sent to the DBM, no NCAA was issued by DBM for the 
year 2020. This precludes them to record the non-cash disbursements of these 
FAPs which understates the figures of disbursements in FAR No. 1 in the 
amount of P76,678,203.00, P23,169,671.90 and P115,257,480.78 for the 
MSCIP P2, NBIADP and IPIF, respectively. 

i. New Bohol (Panglao)

Development Project 
(NBIADP) 

j. Infrastructure

(IPIF) 

 
3.17 While available appropriations under RA Nos. 11465 and 11494 were carried over 

until December 31, 2021 and June 30, 2021, respectively, the Department is 
encouraged to maximize the utilization of its obligations for timely and efficient 
implementation of programs and projects, thus improve the quality of service rendered 
to the general public. 



167  

Utilization of Notice of Cash Allocation (NCA) 
 

3.18 Item 4.2.2 of DBM NBC No. 578 provides for the validity for each NCA issued, thus: 
 

Purpose Validity 
Regular MDS Sub-Accounts Until last working day of the third month of that quarter 
Trust MDS Sub-Accounts Until the last working day of the year 

 
3.19 Review of the Budget and Financial Accountability Reports (BFARs) and Cash- 

Modified Disbursement System (MDS) accounts showed that the DOTr received 
NCAs amounting to P56,381,678,557.01, of which P54,561,845,196.71 or 96.77% 
was utilized as at December 31, 2020, resulting in the reversion to the BTr of 
P1,819,833,360.30 or 3.23% of the total NCAs received. The NCAs received, utilized 
and reverted are summarized in the following table.

3.21 We recommended that Management: 
 

a. closely coordinate with the DBM for the timely release of SARO for the 
implementation of ROW activities; and 

 
b. endeavor to fully utilize the allotments received for timely implementation 

of programs and projects for public use, to improve the quality of service to 
be rendered to the general public. 

 
Management Comments: 

 
3.22 Management commented that they are taking cognizance of the limited period by 

which CY 2020 allotment may be utilized, i.e. up to December 31, 2021 only, and that 
they are closely coordinating with all the project implementors, either through 
respective Sectoral Heads for projects to be procured in the DOTr CO and partner- 
agencies for projects to be undertaken through Memoranda of Agreement, to ensure 
that preparatory works for project implementations such as the conduct of bidding 
short of award are undertaken notwithstanding the covering allotments classified under 
“For Later Release” which are yet to be released by DBM. 

 
3.23 Moreover, Management assured that they are unrelenting on the commitment to push 

for the timely implementation of projects. Also, efforts are constantly being made to 
improve disbursements by the respective sectors, despite the pandemic situation. 

 
 

Terminated and Idle Projects – P579.055 million 
 

4. A total of four projects which were terminated by the DOTr from CY 2015 to 
CY 2019 with total contract cost of P76,470,882.00 have no continuity or 
progression plan for its further implementation, thereby depriving the public of 
the optimum use of these projects. Moreover, two completed projects with 
aggregate contract cost of P502,583,653.82 remained idle and not utilized since 
its completion, thereby exposing these projects to further deterioration, decline 
in value by reason of technological obsolescence and risk of pecuniary loss to the 
Government. 

 
4.1 Section 2 of PD No. 1445 states that “it is the declared policy of the State that all 

resources of the government shall be managed, expended or utilized in accordance 
with law and regulations, and safeguarded against loss or wastage through illegal or 
improper disposition, with a view to ensuring, efficiency, economy and effectiveness 
in the operations of government. The responsibility to take care that such policy is 
faithfully adhered to rests directly with the chief or head of the government agency 
concerned.” 



169  

4.2 Validation of Management implementation of prior year’s recommendations on the 
observation relative to the Department’s terminated and idle projects disclosed that at 
least four terminated projects implemented from CYs 2009 to 2019 still have no 
continuity plans for its further implementation and two substantially completed 
projects in CYs 2010 and 2012 remained idle since its completion. Details are 
summarized in the following table.

4.3 As shown in the preceding table, the terminated projects from CY 2015 to CY 2019 

have reported physical accomplishments ranging from 10% to 42% only while the 
New Manila Area Control Center (MACC) System Project - Phases 1 and 2 are 
substantially completed projects in CYs 2010 and 2012 with reported 
accomplishments of 99.56% and 99.20%, respectively. 

 
a. Terminated Projects 

 
4.4 For the project Concreting of Runway in Marinduque Airport, it was informed that the 

project was mutually terminated and the advances to contractor of P1,258,765.00 was 



170  

applied as compensatory payment to works conducted by the contractor. As reported 
by Management, the contractor was not granted permit to quarry due to the legal case 
filed to them by the Ombudsman in the Province of Marinduque. 

 
4.5 Considering the ground of the termination, which was the failure of the contractor to 

obtain a permit to quarry, was on personal account of the contractor, we are of the view 
that applying the advances made to the contractor, which is about 14% of the contract 
price, against the contractor’s physical accomplishment of only 9.57% is improper and 
grossly disadvantageous to the government. 

 
4.6 Furthermore, it was noted that the project was terminated on March 15, 2017 or more 

than 3 years ago but up to this writing Management has no continuity or back up plans 
for the project completion. 

 
4.7 As regards the construction of the Santa Fe Port, which commenced implementation 

in November 2013 and with only 16.80% physical accomplishment, no information 
was provided by the Management on the reason for termination as well as the actions 
undertaken to recover the advances made to the contractor amounting to 
P2,630,579.00. Management has not also provided the Audit Team with information 
on whether the project will still be pursued or not. 

 
4.8 Similarly, for the KBK Lot 16 - MIAA – NCR and the Buhatan Port Projects, 

Management has yet to provide this Audit Team of its continuity or back up/catch up 
plans. 

 
b. Idle Projects 

 
4.9 For the idle New MACC 

Phase 1 and 2 projects, the 
Audit Team was informed 
that Management is currently 
looking for other government 
agencies where the New 
MACC could be transferred 
such as Philippine Air Force 
(PAF) and Philippine Coast 
Guard (PCG). However, no 
further information was 
provided by the Management 
on the realization of such 
plan, thus the projects 
remained idle and unused as 
at audit date. 



171  

4.10 Notwithstanding our prior year’s audit recommendations relative to the foregoing 
observations, no management action or status update of the subject projects was 
provided to the Audit Team as at audit date. 

 
4.11 Congruent thereto, we would like to reiterate that aside from undertaking legal 

remedies such as imposition of liquidated damages, issuance of blacklisting order, and 
forfeiture of performance bonds of the contractors, a continuity or back-up plans 
should also be considered prior or upon project termination to protect public’s interest 
in the optimum use and utilization of these projects. 

 
4.12 We reiterated the following prior year’s recommendations to Management: 

 
a. provide the Audit Team with a continuity or back up plans for the noted 

terminated projects; 
 

b. explore various options to utilize the substantially completed New MACC 
Phases 1 and 2 to ensure that objectives are met and public resources are 
judiciously utilized to prevent further loss to the government by reason of 
technological obsolescence; and 

 
c. ensure that the application of advances as compensatory payment to works 

performed by the contractor is justified and authorized and exhaust all 
remedies to recover any outstanding and/or remaining advances made to 
the contractor. 

 
Management Comments: 

 
4.13 For the KBK Project in MIAA, Management commented that a MOA shall be forged 

to formally transfer the unutilized goods for renovation/expansion of their toilets, its 
maintenance, and upkeep. Likewise, the accountability for the remaining goods 
intended for the project shall be transferred to MIAA through a Property Transfer 
Report. A follow-up with the Office of the Solicitor General through a letter dated 
January 23, 2021 was made for assistance in proceeding against AQA Global, Inc. for 
the recoupment of Advance Payment and Liquidated Damages relative to the 
terminated contracts for KBK Projects. 

 
4.14 For the MACC Project, the Management commented that the option left for DOTr to 

put it to use is to transfer or donate the MACC assets to the PCG, or to any national 
defense units with monitoring and surveillance mandates. Confirmation from project 
proponents added that the MACC project can be upgraded from civilian to military 
use, if required. 

 
4.15 Management has not yet provided comment on the other remaining identified projects. 



172  

Uninstalled/undeployed concrete barriers for the EDSA Bus Way Project - P31.592 million 
 

5. A total of 7,347 pieces or 20.41% of the total concrete barriers procured for the 
EDSA Bus Way Project with an equivalent value of P31,592,100.00 remained 
uninstalled/undeployed due to: (a) replacement of at least 3,243 pieces of barrier 
by steel and/or metal bollards in flyovers and underpasses; and (b) construction 
of needed concourses, structures and other structures along EDSA prior to 
installation/deployment of barriers, thereby limiting its potential use not only to 
maintain orderliness and ensure the safety and security of commuters using the 
EDSA Busway but also to mitigate traffic congestion. 

 
5.1 The DOTr, in coordination with the DPWH, LTFRB and MMDA, implemented the 

EDSA Bus Way Project purposely to ease the transportation struggles of the riding 
public by creating seamless movement of high-capacity Public Utility Vehicles 
(PUVs), faster travel time for commuters and at-grade pedestrian crossings, and/or 
footbridges along EDSA while ensuring observance of the safety measures prescribed 
by the Inter Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases 
(IATF-EID). 

 
5.2 The project aims to reform the city bus system along EDSA by rationalizing the 61 

city bus routes and 3,340 city bus units previously passing EDSA into one integrated 
EDSA Loop Service with an 
estimated 550 bus units to 
operate in the main corridor, 
which will then be 
interconnected to an initial 29 
other rationalized city buses. 
It runs from SM Mall of Asia 
in Pasay City to Monumento 
in Caloocan City with staging 
areas intended to be located at 
the Paranaque Integrated 
Terminal Exchange (PITX) 
and Valenzuela Gateway 
Complex (VGC). The length of the route is 24-km per direction (48-km for both 
directions) with an initial 26 bus stations along the stretch. 

 
5.3 Congruent thereto, in order to maintain orderliness and ensure the safety and security 

of commuters using the EDSA Busway, the DOTr has planned to put up more concrete 
barriers on EDSA. Accordingly, a total of 36,000 pieces of concrete barrier was 
determined to be placed side-by-side with no gaps in between stretches. 

 
5.4 On this note, on June 16, 2020 the DOTr-MRT3 has procured through Negotiation 

with concerned suppliers the Fabrication and Delivery of Precast Barriers - Lots 1, 2, 
and 3. Each lot has a total quantity of 12,000 concrete barriers at a unit cost of 



173  

P4,300.00 per barrier or contract cost of P51,600,000.00 or a total quantity of 36,000 
concrete barriers with total contract cost of P154,800,000.00 for all lots. Details of the 
project are summarized in Table 35.

5.5 Relatedly, the deliveries of the foregoing barriers were completed in December 2020, 
however, our verification showed that as at audit date, a total of 7,347 pieces or 20.41% 
of the total procured concrete barriers for the EDSA Bus Way Project with an 
equivalent value of P31,592,100.00 were at the staging areas and remained 
undeployed/uninstalled due to the following: 

 
a. 3,243 pieces of concrete barrier in various locations were replaced by steel 

and/or metal bollards 
 

5.6 Upon inquiry, the DOTr-MRT 3 informed, and the MMDA Technical Discipline 
Office (MMDA-TDO) confirmed, that a total of 3,243 allotted concrete barriers 
originally intended for flyovers and underpasses along EDSA were replaced by steel 
bollards because the road-width at these locations are considerably narrower compared 
to the roads located at-grade, thus, contributing to the increase of quantity of 
uninstalled barriers. 

 
5.7 The MMDA-TDO informed that the installation of concrete barriers in flyovers and 

underpasses will further reduced the already narrow lane making it impossible for two 
cars to traverse the road side by side. The bollards being thin in diameter were then 
installed since these will not significantly affect the size of each lane. 

 
5.8 Further, it was informed that the 3,243 steel and/or metal bollards used by MMDA- 

TDO were part of the 6,000 pieces of bollard received from Citra Metro Manila 
Tollways Corporation (CMMTC) in August 2020 and were deployed in the following 
locations: (i) Nepa Qmart Flyover – 64 pieces; (ii) Along Kamuning Flyover – 700 
pieces; (iii) QAve Flyover to Vertis North – 583 pieces; (iv) Cubao Underpass – 248 
pieces; (v) Before Ayala Tunnel – 950 pieces; and (vi) Ayala Tunnel – 698 pieces. 

 
5.9 In view of the foregoing, Management of the DOTr-MRT3 clarified that the 

installation of bollards was not considered during the negotiated procurement of the 
concrete barriers and is not included in the original plan. More so, the turn-over thereof 
from CMMTC only transpired three months after the award of contracts.

5.10 We acknowledge the explanation provided by the Management of the DOTr-MRT 3 
that the availability of bollards was not considered in coming up with the total quantity 
of concrete barriers to be procured as the same were donated to MMDA in a later date, 
however, we are of the view that the road-width of the flyovers and underpasses vis- 
à-vis the width specification of the concrete barrier should have been taken into 
account during the planning phase for the said procurement. Had Management took 
cognizant of the road-width, there will be no over-stocking and/or 
uninstalled/undeployed 3,423 pieces of barrier with equivalent value of 
P13,944,900.00, which are kept at the staging areas along EDSA. 

 
b. installation and/or deployment of barriers is dependent on the completion of 

concourses, structures and other developments along EDSA 
 

5.11 Apart from the above, Management of the MRT 3 further explained that another reason 
for the non-installation and/or non-deployment of the concrete barriers could be 
attributed to the related construction of needed concourses, structures and other 
developments particularly from Magallanes Station to Mall of Asia, extending to 
PITX. Accordingly, the DOTr has agreements with SM Prime Holdings, DM 
Wenceslao and Associates, Inc. and Double Dragon Properties Corporation to carry 
out the construction and completion of the concourses, in accordance with the concept 
and design parameters approved by the DOTr, at the following EDSA Busway 
stations: 

 
Locations Company Remarks 

Bus stations along: SM Prime Holdings Both have expressed interest in constructing 
and donating footbridges for the recently 
established busway system. 
The DOTr has already requested DPWH on 
its letter dated September 17, 2020, for 
comments and inputs on the conceptual 
design of the proposed EDSA Busway 
Bridge with Concourse supplied by the 
concerned private stakeholders.

5.12 In like manner, the DOTr-MRT3 also entered into a MOA with MMDA for the 
additional stations that need to be constructed for the EDSA Busway Project. The 
project cost of P77,738,389.82 will be transferred to MMDA in CY 2021 upon the 
approval of the agreement by concerned officials. 



175  

5.13 The project cost breakdown is as follows: 
 

Items Total (in Php) 
A. Design and construction of pedestrian foot bridge with roofing and lightings along 

EDSA, North Ave., Quezon City and EDSA- Tramo Pasay City 
19,789,999.71 

B. Rehabilitation of existing pedestrian foot bridge with roofing and lightings at

12,267,385.06 

E. Electrical works 11,299,950.93 
Total 77,738,389.82 

 
5.14 The DOTr-Road Sector, on the other hand, informed that these barriers will be utilized 

after the completion of concourses, structures and other developments and that 
installation thereof rests with the MMDA as the end-user. 

 
5.15 Notwithstanding the above, since the deployment of these concrete barriers is 

dependent on the completion of these aforementioned concourses, structures and other 
developments to be constructed along EDSA, the non-utilization of at least 7,347 
pieces, inclusive of the barriers replaced by bollards, with equivalent value of 
P31,592,100.00, limits the DOTr of its potential and immediate use of the procured 
barriers not only to maintain orderliness and ensure the safety and security of 
commuters using the EDSA Busway but also to mitigate traffic congestion along 
EDSA. 

 
5.16 We recommended that Management of the DOTr-MRT3, in coordination with 

the MMDA, provide installation and/or deployment plan indicating the specific 
areas and/or locations to which these remaining concrete barriers will be installed 
and/or deployed to ensure maximum utilization thereof. 

 
5.17 Likewise, we recommended that Management closely coordinate with partner 

agencies and entities to ensure timely construction and completion of required 
concourses, structures and other developments not only to facilitate installation 
and/or deployment of the remaining uninstalled concrete barriers but primarily 
to achieve the very objective for the procurement thereof. 

 
Management Comments: 

 
5.18 Management commented that the installation of all the barriers to the entire stretch of 

the route has always been the primary concern of all of the agencies involved. 
However, installation of the remaining barriers could not be carried out since there are 
still no median stations in the areas identified that needs to be enclosed by barriers. In 
addition, the planners and the proponents justified that it is necessary to procure all the 
36,000 units of concrete barrier for the entire designated stretch in EDSA parallel with 



176  

the development of the remaining stations and concourses for the barriers to be readily 
available for use by the commuting public after completion of civil works and not be 
stalled because there are no barriers available to enclose the median stations. 

 
5.19 Management also provided the following update as at April 12, 2021: 

 
 The detailed engineering designs for the concourse that will be donated by the 

SMPHI group have already been submitted by the designers for the designated 
site located in SM MOA, SM Megamall, SM North EDSA. The ground breaking 
of the project will be conducted virtually on May 18, 2021. 

 
 Management is currently in the process of downloading funds to MMDA, for the 

latter to construct three (3) additional stations at Taft Ave, Tramo, and Roxas 
Blvd. 

 
5.20 Moreover, a copy of the barrier installation plan with a proposed timeline for the 

remaining 7,347 barriers was already submitted by the Road Sector to the Audit Team. 
 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 
 

5.21 The implementation of the submitted deployment plan will be monitored by the Audit 
Team in the ensuing year. 

 
 

Various issues/setbacks encountered in the implementation of 15 Foreign Assisted Projects 
(FAPs) and incurrence of commitment fees 

 
6. Various issues/setbacks were encountered in the implementation of 15 DOTr- 

FAPs in CY 2020 with an aggregate cost of P1,312,605,770,000.00, thus, resulted 
in prolonged/extended project implementation period and/or further project 
delays, possible change in total project cost and slippages or low/no actual 
physical accomplishments of the projects which consequently will require 
project restructuring. The overall causes of delays in the project implementation 
also resulted in the incurrence and payment of additional commitment fees for 
the seven FAPs per BTr report amounting to P158,223,997.87 in CY 2020. 

 
6.1 Review and analysis of the status of implementation of the DOTr-FAPs as at 

December 31, 2020 disclosed implementation issues, setbacks and delays that affected 
the projects’ performance as shown in Table 36.

6.2 As seen in Table 36, 15 FAPs encountered different issues/setbacks that cause further 
delays in project’s implementation which the Management and/or concerned 
officers/personnel have already taken actions to resolve the issues or have prepared/set 
an action plans/measures to be undertaken to address the said projects’ concerns. 

 
6.3 Moreover, the most 

common issues/setbacks 
encountered by DOTr 
FAPs in CY 2020 relate to 
issues in budget and fund 
flows, site 
condition/availability and 
issues brought about by 
COVID-19 pandemic. 

 
6.4 The said issues/setbacks 

contributed to the 
prolonged/extended 
project implementation period and change (increase/decrease) in total project costs and 
scope which resulted to the restructuring of the projects listed in Table 37.

6.5 Some of the above FAPs had already been restructured in CY 2020, but for most of 

these projects, restructuring has been scheduled in CY 2021. This should be given 
utmost attention by the Management and concerned Project Management Offices 
(PMOs) to ensure the submission of the necessary documents required by the 
Investment Coordination Committee (ICC) for the approval of the restructuring within 
the said timeline. 



179  

6.6 Further, evaluation of the Physical Performance/Status of ODA-loan supported 
projects disclosed the following deficiencies: 

 
a. Slippages or low/no actual physical accomplishments 

 
6.7 Our evaluation of the FAPs physical performance showed that as at December 31, 

2020, out of the 16 ODA projects, 4 projects were physically complete, 4 were on 
schedule, 4 were behind schedule, and no data was provided on the physical status of 
the remaining 5 projects (except for IPIF Project which is entirely a Consultancy 
Services Project hence no physical status). Details are summarized in Table 38.

All the information contained in this table came from the NEDA Draft CY 2020 ODA Portfolio Review of the 
DOTr except for CBRTP and IPIF – Output 3 which came from the Quarterly Status Report submitted by the 
Project Management Office as at December 31, 2020. It can be noted that the data submitted to NEDA- 
Monitoring and Evaluation Staff (MES) were incomplete. 



180  

6.8 These  slippages or 
low/no reported actual 
physical 
accomplishments of the 
FAPs may be attributed 
to the extended/delayed 
project implementation 
caused by the issues/ 
setbacks   presented in 
Table 38. 

 
6.9 Therefore,  these 

issues/setbacks would 
require immediate actions/response by the Management and the officers/personnel 
concerned in order to prevent further delays in the project implementation. 

 
b. Commitment Fees (CF) 

 
6.10 In view of the issues/setbacks encountered by the projects which resulted in delayed 

implementation or extended project implementation period and low disbursements or 
loan availments, the Government paid additional commitment fees amounting to 
P158,223,997.87 in CY 2020 per report submitted by the BTr. Details are shown in 
Table 39.

6.11 A CF is a fee levied on undisbursed portion of the loan, payable in the currency in 
which the loan is denominated. This charge can be collected or capitalized based on 
the Loan Agreement (LA) when the loan becomes effective. This CF is charged by 



181  

foreign lending institution on top of the interest charges and other fees as embodied in 
the LA. 

 
6.12 Hence, it bears stressing that delays in project implementation need to be addressed 

immediately to prevent further extension of services/project’s completion/ 
implementation period and possible incurrence of additional CFs/charges in case of 
extension of the loan validity period. 

 
6.13 We recommended that Management: 

 
a. directly/closely monitor the execution of the action plans set to address the 

issues/setbacks and delays identified on each FAP to ensure smooth and 
timely implementation of projects and to avoid further delays; 

 
b. require the concerned PMOs to (i) review and validate the data/ information 

contained in the NEDA Draft CY 2020 ODA Portfolio Review of the DOTr; 
and (ii) submit to the Audit Team the updated/revised FAPs Physical Status 
Report as at December 31, 2020, including the updates/status on the 
measures undertaken to address the issues/setbacks and delays on the 
project’s implementation; and (iii) regularly provide NEDA-MES and COA 
Audit Team with complete quarterly/periodic status reports of the FAPs; 

 
c. require all stakeholders such as the approving authorities, PMOs, and 

others involved in the procurement and implementation phase to exert best 
efforts to minimize delays and maximize loan proceeds availment during 
the loan validity period thereby minimizing incurrence of commitment fees; 
and 

 
d. fast-track preparation of ICC requisite documents for the approval of the 

DOTr’s requests for project restructuring in CY 2021. 
 

Management Comments: 
 

6.14 The delayed submissions of reports for the IPIF Project are considered acceptable and 
duly noted by the sector offices due to various reasons, in particular, was affected by 
the limited movements/activities of the Consultants brought by the COVID-19 
pandemic. 

 
6.15 The total commitment fees paid for the IPIF Project are noted. While we were 

optimistic at the start of 2020 that we will be able to meet our target disbursements and 
subproject timetables, the COVID-19 pandemic has challenged the delivery of project 
outputs and targets. 

 
6.16 The recommendation on the calibrated plan of action for IPIF Project is duly noted. 

This will be undertaken together by the DOTr and the project’s consultant. 



182  

6.17 The National Project Manager of BRT-NPMO submitted their compliance on the 
submission of updated/revised physical accomplishments for the CBRT and MMBRT 
Line 1 Projects. The BRT-PMO in their letter dated May 17, 2021 provided 
information and/or updates on the action plans to address the issues and setbacks 
encountered, efforts exerted to minimize delays and maximize loan availments, and 
updates on the preparation of ICC requirements for project restructuring. Also, it was 
provided that for future reports, COA will be provided complete quarterly/periodic 
status reports. 

 
6.18 The Assistant Project Manager of the NBACSEPP provided updates on the noted 

issues/setbacks encountered by the project. For the site condition/availability, all the 
lots were already possessed with Land Entry Permit documents while the 
compensation is still being process through Deed of Exchange and direct payment. 
Further, it was stated that mobilization of key experts to the project site has already 
started and the target completion of works and issuance of performance certificate is 
in July 2021. 

 
6.19 Undersecretary for Railways disclosed that the MMSP is currently undergoing review 

before the NEDA ICC-Technical Board for restructuring due to its interoperability 
with the NSCR South Line and its extension to the Ninoy Aquino International Airport 
Terminal 3, resulting to the increased overall project cost. Likewise, they stated that 
their office is closely monitoring the project to ensure effective and timely 
implementation moving forward and other updates/clarifications were provided. 

 
 

Undeployed, uninstalled and unutilized PPE – P140.523 million 
 

7. Various PPE costing P120,001,519.66 and P20,521,978.09 relative to the DOTr 
Road Transportation Information Technology Infrastructure Project and 
Driver’s License Cards with Five-Year Validity, respectively, were either 
undeployed, uninstalled or unutilized, thus, resulted in the inefficient 
implementation of the projects. 

 
7.1 Section 2 of PD No. 1445 states that all resources of the government shall be managed, 

expended or utilized in accordance with law and regulations, and safeguarded against 
loss or wastage through illegal or improper disposition, with a view to ensuring 
efficiency, economy and effectiveness in the operations of government.

7.3 The deliverables in the projects enumerated above were all delivered and paid in CY 
2019. The Equipment Unit informed that they are just waiting for the instruction and 
allocation of the Management Information Division (MID) for the equipment to be 
deployed. 

 
7.4 Likewise, in the LTO-XII, various ICT Equipment, Semi-Expendable 

Communications and ICT equipment amounting to P14,826,127.72 received from 
LTO-SHO by the Regional Supply Officer and Chiefs/ Heads of the Field and DOs 
from March 2020 to November 2020, remained uninstalled and unutilized as at 
December 31, 2020. These properties were still being kept in their respective boxes, 
uninstalled and unutilized in the custody of numerous supply officers for almost 11 



184  

months from the dates of equipment delivery, in addition to last year’s unutilized ICT 
equipment that have already occupied a substantial portion of office space in almost 
all LTO offices. 

 
7.5 Interviews conducted revealed that some of the reasons/causes for the non-utilization 

of the ICT, Communication Equipment and Semi-Expendable ICT equipment are the 
following: 

 
 Equipment intended for LTO Malabang were all stored in the supply office since 

the office was closed for years; 
 Twenty-six (26) Dell OptiPlex Computers remained in the supply office for the 

reason that they could not decide on the distribution of said equipment; 
 No instruction from higher authority to use or operate said Equipment; 
 Non-availability of site support personnel coming from Dermalog (Not all 

Districts and Extension Offices have a Site Support personnel); 
 Non-availability of access point or weak internet connection in the area; 
 Unpreparedness of examination rooms; 
 Non-availability of computer tables and chairs for the examination rooms and 

for the workstations; and 
 Unreadiness of the site due to upgrading of electrical infrastructure, since the 

Building is not owned by LTO and one (1) structure affected by earthquake and 
electrical sockets are not suited for the examination rooms because of limited 
socket connections. 

 
7.6 The delay and/or non-installation of the equipment will result to its non-utilization and 

heightens risk of technological obsolescence and wear and tear. In like manner, 
unutilized equipment affects the efficiency and the attainment of the objective of the 
project and is tantamount to wastage of public funds which is disadvantageous to the 
government. 

 
7.7 We recommended that Management: (a) direct the MID of LTO-SHO to 

coordinate with the Equipment Unit to ensure deployment and utilization of 
equipment and devices procured to avoid wastage of government funds; and 
(b) direct LTO-XII to conduct assessment on the possible reasons/causes or delay 
for the non-utilization of the ICT and Communication equipment and fast track 
the full implementation on the utilization of the said properties in order to achieve 
the agency’s program and prevent equipment obsolescence and wastage of public 
funds. 

 
Management Comments: 

 
7.8 The Management of LTO-XII commented that they also wanted to use and utilize the 

ICT equipment delivered to them, however, they are dependent on the instructions of 
the LTO-SHO since the implementation of Land Transportation Management System 



185  

(LTMS) is not yet completed. Full utilization of ICT Equipment relative to the DOTr 
Road Transportation Information and Technology Infrastructure Project is beyond 
their control. 

 
b. ZF2 Fingerprint Scanners 

 
7.9 Additionally, 265 units of fingerprint scanner ZF2 model costing P17,318.81 each or 

a total of P4,589,484.65 were unutilized due to the change in specification from four 
print (ZF2) to ten print (LF10). Management informed that it is more secure to use a 
ten print as it would eliminate the tampering of fingerprints. Accordingly, the 
fingerprint scanners being utilized in the fingerprints data gathering were LF10 instead 
of the ZF2. This is a prior year audit finding which remained unimplemented to date. 

 
7.10 The foregoing was verified by COA Information Technology Audit Office (ITAO) in 

their inspection conducted to various LTO offices nationwide. In their report, it was 
noted that 156 units of ZF2 inspected were unutilized, most of which were found at its 
box. In addition to the ZF2, COA ITAO observed other peripherals which were 
unutilized at the time of inspection at various selected LTO sites nationwide. The 
details of these unutilized peripherals are summarized in Table 41. 

 
Table 41: Unutilized peripherals 

Particulars Quantity 
Unit Cost Total Cost 

(in Php) 
1 Fingerprint Scanner (ZF2) 156 17,318.81 2,701,734.36 
2 Fingerprint Scanner (LF10) 9 113,542.00 1,021,878.00 
3 Signature Pad 6 7,596.49 45,578.94 
4 Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) 1 10,738.00 10,738.00 
5 Web Camera 6 4,695.13 28,170.78 
Total 178  3,808,100.08 

 
7.11 The non-utilization of the enumerated peripherals, aside from the ZF2, was due to the 

following: 
 

 the defect on any component which form part of the process line/set intended for 
the processing of DL which resulted in the non-utilization of the entire process 
line/set as what has been noted in LTO-IV-B and V; 

 installation of Laser Engraver to a workstation/desktop computer wherein the 
peripherals were uninstalled to lessen workstations’ hang ups and license card 
printing backlogs as noted in LTO-I; and 

 non-availability of space for the equipment in LTO-III. 
 

7.12 The non-utilization of peripherals with a total cost of P5,695,850.37 (computed using 
265 units of ZF2 instead of 156 units), of which P4,589,484.65 pertains to ZF2 which 
were unutilized since delivery, indicates that the delivered peripherals are not needed 
in the efficient implementation of the contract/project, hence, considered as 
unnecessary expenditure and a wastage of government funds. 



186  

7.13 We recommended that Management utilize and deploy the fingerprint scanner 
(ZF2) and other idle peripherals to efficiently implement the project and 
effectively execute its mandate. 

 
Management Comments: 

 
7.14 Management informed that the following actions have been taken: 

 
 The LTO Management already approved the proposal/recommendation of MID 

and Law Enforcement Services – Traffic Safety Division (LES-TSD) to utilize the 
fingerprint scanner on the following: 

 
i. Test Track Driving Facility-The equipment can be used for the purpose of 

login verification and client authentication to confirm their identity. Ideally, 
the number of facilities that will be established is equal to the number of 
licensing centers; 

 
ii. Front liners for Newly Opened LTO Offices- Currently, the equipment is 

being used for login purposes of the internal users, authenticating clients to 
confirm their identity during online examination, and releasing of any 
appropriate items such as SP, DL, OR, CR, and etc. These can be distributed 
to the 45 new LTO owned sites that are initially part of the 228 list.; 

 
iii. Driver’s Education Center (DEC)-The TSD suggested to use the equipment 

for the attendance of the clients of the DEC to be used to validate if the clients 
are really attending classes; and 

 
iv. The Property Section was instructed to coordinate with the concerned offices 

for the distribution list and deployment schedule. 
 

 The LTO Management issued a directive to the regional offices to utilize and 
maximize the issued peripherals such as cameras, signature pads, fingerprint 
scanners, etc. Otherwise, it should be returned to the Regional Office including 
the unutilized ZF2 and to locate and account all of the workstations and 
peripherals to update records including their status and condition and to ascertain 
complete delivery of the Supplier of the required deliverables. 

 
Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 
7.15 The commitment of Management to implement the recommendations shall be 

monitored by the Audit Team during the conduct of validation of prior year’s audit 
recommendation. 



187  

c. Laser Engravers 
 

7.16 On March 12, 2018, the Executive Director of the LTO-SHO ordered the pull-out of 
the engravers deployed to the Drivers’ License Renewal Offices (DLROs) for the 
deployment in other LTO offices and requiring the DLROs to provide their own 
equipment. Correspondingly, on October 2, 2019 he likewise instructed that the 
engravers and peripherals of DLROs issued by the LTO are to be returned to the 
Property Section, LTO-SHO since the laser engravers and peripherals procured by the 
proponents of DLROs have already been delivered by the supplier. 

 
7.17 Review of the report of Equipment Unit on the issuance and return of engravers and 

noted that 21 DLROs received 1 engraver each, of which only 9 have returned the 
previously issued engravers despite the aforementioned orders by the Executive 
Director. Moreover, the returned engravers remained unutilized/idle at the MID and 
Equipment Warehouse for a period of five months to more than a year. 

 
7.18 Further, we noted five units of laser engraver with serial numbers 51812096, 

51812097, 51812098, 51812099, and 51812100 under Lot 3 delivered on March 20, 
2019, remain undeployed as at December 31, 2020. It was disclosed that the Property 
Section is only waiting for the instruction from MID for its issuance. 

 
7.19 The non-utilization of the engravers despite the period lapsed from the time of delivery 

resulted to wastage of government funds. 
 

7.20 We recommended that Management instruct DLROs to return the laser 
engravers and peripherals to the Property Section and the latter in coordination 
with MID to issue and utilize returned and undeployed laser engravers. 

 
 

Delayed Implementation of the DOTr Road Transportation IT Infrastructure Project 
 

8. Approval of extension orders for the DOTr Road Transportation IT 
Infrastructure Project - LTO Component A with a contract amount of 
P3,190,020,094.08 without proof of due diligence, and acceptance of customized 
core applications even with unresolved defects and implementation thereof to the 
non-pilot sites caused undue payments to the vendor which is disadvantageous 
to the government and delayed processing of transactions causing unnecessary 
burdens to its clients, respectively. 

 
8.1 The IT Project which aimed to automate the LTO’s internal and external functions as 

it envisions paperless transactions for optimum efficiency was divided into two (2) 
components – Component A and Component B with an Approved Budget for the 
Contract (ABC) of P3,443,531,334.00 and P4,783,153,175.14, respectively, totaling 
P8,226,684,509.14. The project is a multi-year contract with a Multi-Year Obligational 
Authority and National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) approval. 



188  

Component A pertains to the Land Transportation Management System (LTMS), a 
web-based core system that will replace the old IT system including the establishment 
and operationalization of an exclusive on-premise private cloud, network operations 
center, technical 
support  and 
helpdesk centers. 
On the other hand, 
Component B is 
composed   of 
various and distinct 
projects for the 
procurement of 
hardware, software 
and services 
relative      to     the 
automation of LTO’s internal and external functions. 

 
8.2 Review and evaluation of the contract documents pertaining to Component A 

disclosed the following deficiencies: 
 

a.  Approval of various Extension Orders (EOs) and acceptance of customized core 
application with unresolved defects 

 
8.3 The contract for the DOTr IT Project - Component A was perfected on May 28, 2018 

and was awarded to Dermalog Identification Systems, Holy Family Printing Corp., 
Microgenesis and Verzontal Builders, Inc. Joint Venture (herein referred as the 
vendor) with a total contract cost of P3,190,020,094.08. 

 
8.4 Similarly, review of contract documents relative to Component A and corroboration 

with the Project Management Team revealed that Management approved several 
Extension Orders (EOs) for each milestone/activity, revising the timelines stated in the 
bid documents. The status of implementation of the project as at December 31, 2020 
is shown in Table 42.

8.5 Gleaned from Table 42, the contractor is expected to deliver customized and integrated 

core applications that will allow seamless processing and exchange of data, single 
registration of LTO clients and other stakeholders, single submission, simplified 
processing, quick decision-making of transactions. In addition, it is expected to allow 
all the LTO Enforcers to have access to Law Enforcement and Traffic Adjudication 
database anytime and anywhere through the use of mobile devices with internet 
connectivity. As at December 31, 2020, the implemented LTMS is in version 2.1.1 
released on November 30, 2020 and the status of the core applications as assessed by 
the Project Management Committee (PMC) and Acceptance Committee is provided in

dated January 29, 2021 items 
that were neither tagged as 
“passed” nor “failed”. 

 
Minutes of the Steering 
Committee meeting held on 
February 11, 2021 passed 
some items with no explicit 
action on the following: 
- The proposed solution 

must be able to provide 
Driver’s/Conductor’s 
License Certification; 

- Face recognition database 
sizing support must be up 
to a minimum of 
20,000,000 records with

8.6 As shown in Table 43, the Report on the QA Testing of LTMS version 2.1.1 as at 

March 5, 2021 disclosed defects which are still open even after acceptance of Portal, 
DLS and RCS. Acceptance of the system even with noted defects is disadvantageous 
to the government as acceptance resulted in payments when the system has yet to 
function and operate fully as expected. 

 
b. Medical Certificates 

 
8.7 As required in the Terms of Reference (TOR), medical certificates should be 

electronically submitted from the Medical IT providers to the LTMS. However, 
evaluation by the Acceptance Committee in their report dated January 29, 2021 
disclosed that medical certificates from the Stradcom Corporation (as the IT Provider 
of various Medical Clinics) are manually encoded in the DLS. 



192  

8.8 Inquiry with the PMC disclosed the following status of the connectivity of the 
accredited medical IT providers with the LTMS as at December 31, 2020:

7 Cimplex Solutions Inc. December 17, 2020 Newly accredited, 

connectivity to LTMS is 
on process 

Not applicable 

 
8.9 Table 44 showed that even if Stradcom Corporation is one of the earliest accredited IT 

Provider, it has yet to connect with LTMS. Inquiry with the PMC and examination of 
correspondences between Management, Stradcom Corporation and the vendor showed 
that the discussions on the Stradcom Corporation’s connectivity started only in 
December 2020. 

 
8.10 On a related note, PMC informed that the following accredited Medical Clinics 

connected to the LTMS are being managed by an accredited IT Service Providers, 
except the 150 medical clinics under the Stradcom Corporation as their IT Provider, 
details are as follows: 

 
Table 45: Number of Accredited Medical Clinics connected to the LTMS

No IT Provider 12 
Total 407 

 
8.11 The LTO listed a total of 583 accredited Medical Clinics as posted in the LTO Website. 

However, based on information gathered from the PMC, the 150 accredited medical 
clinics which is under the Stradcom Corporation as their IT Provider including the 26 
medical clinics were still not connected with the LTMS as at audit date, hence the total 
clinics connected with the LTMS were only 407 accredited medical clinics. It was also 
observed that 12 out of the 407 medical clinics as shown in Table 44 has no IT Provider 
and they are directly connected with the LTMS which is not in compliance with 
Section 11 of LTO Memorandum Circular No. 2018-2157 which instructs that medical 
clinics should make use of an LTO-approved application program developed and 
managed by an accredited Medical IT Service Provider.

c. Status of Pilot Test and Pilot Implementation 
 

8.12 Previous audit observation disclosed delay in the pilot test and implementation due to: 
(a) incomplete turn-over of Database by Stradcom Corporation, the existing IT system 
of LTO; (b) Inter-Agency Interface; and (c) site conditions/availability. 

 
8.13 Further review and evaluation of available documents revealed the following updates 

on the noted observations:

8.15 However, as shown in Table 46 the pilot testing and pilot implementation were done 
per core applications which are yet to be integrated. It can also be observed that more 
than 12 months (8 months prior to COVID-19 pandemic) had passed before the 
LETAS was implemented in the pilot sites due to the unreadiness of the said core 
application. 

 
8.16 Review of the contract and various EOs issued revealed the following changes in the 

delivery date of the Acceptance of Pilot Test and Completion of Pilot Implementation: 
 

Table 48: Revised Schedule of Delivery of Pilot Testing and Pilot Implementation 
Activity End Date per TOR

Completion of Pilot    BRS and FDS were completed in 
Implementation    December 2018 and April 2019, 

    respectively. 

  2020-A-013 March 31, 2021 COVID-19 pandemic and 
  dated October  imposition of quarantine lockdown 
  14, 2020   

 
8.17 The vendor in its letter dated May 6, 2019 requested for an extension of delivery for 

the end-user’s trainings, data disaster recovery plan, technical support and helpdesk 
plan manuals, legal gap analysis and Go-Live of the LTMS due to various 
dependencies and blockers which was approved in EO 2019-A-009 dated May 30, 
2019. Extension for the Acceptance of pilot test and completion of pilot 
implementation was not included in the said letter. Further, while the EO states 
“considering the actions required from LTO to address and complete the dependencies 
and blockers, the Pilot Implementation can be completed on or before May 30, 2020” 
it did not extend the delivery schedule of the subject activity. 

 
8.18 Accordingly, the Audit Team find EO 2020-A-013 dated October 14, 2020 without 

merit, thus, considered the LTMS project as behind schedule for almost 1 year and 8 
months subject to liquidated damages to be computed from July 30, 2019 until the pilot 
test and pilot implementation of the LTMS (with integrated core systems) is delivered 
and accepted by Management. 

 
8.19 It is also worthy to mention that EO 2020-A-013 includes extension of delivery 

schedules to dates earlier than the approval of the said extension.

LETAS 20 - 20 
MVIRS 19 34 53 

 
8.20 As mentioned in Table 43 and as gleaned in Table 49, LTMS is being implemented in 

non-pilot sites even if the core applications are not yet integrated and some (MVIRS 
and LETAS) are yet to be accepted. It is our understanding that the Go-Live 
requirement in the contract is for the 24 pilot sites, thus, the integrated core 
applications should be operating as designed and required by the end-users prior to its 
roll-out to the non-pilot sites. 

 
8.21 The implementation of LTMS to non-pilot sites resulted in cases wherein transactions 

are not being processed or if processed are delayed causing burden to the LTO clients 
which could have been limited to the pilot sites. The difficulties encountered is 
attributed to the unconnected core applications and the two systems (LTMS and the 
existing IT system) that are not in sync. Currently, transactions processed in the 
existing IT system is not reflected in LTMS and vice versa. 

 
8.22 On February 16, 2021, the Steering Committee initiated the conduct of data 

synchronization through Steering Committee Resolution No. 2021-A-001 after the 
matter was discussed among the Steering Committee, Acceptance Committee, IT 
Consultants and Vendor Representatives. However, as at audit date, data 
synchronization has not yet started due to conflicting interpretations as to whether it is 
required in the contract or not. 

 
8.23 Despite the issues encountered, LTMS roll-out plan as at March 8, 2021 disclosed the 

implementation of the LTMS to additional non-pilot sites, specifically, 20 additional 
offices and 13 new Driver’s License Renewal Offices (DLROs) by March 15, 2021. 
While we commend Management’s aggressiveness in fast-tracking the 
implementation of the IT Project, we would like to remind Management to always do 
things the right/proper way. 

 
e. Creation and reconstitution of the Steering Committee 

 
8.24 The Steering Committee was initially tasked to review and approve all change requests 

and amendments in the TOR and deliverables of the project but this duty was 
transferred to the Change Request Control Committee (CRCC) on December 5, 2018 
per Office Order No. 2019-002. However, review of the said Office Order disclosed 
that a vendor’s representative was included as a member of the said committee. It is 



196  

our stand that since the Office Order is an internal document to manage internal affairs 
of the Agency, it should not include third parties especially vendor’s representative. 

 
8.25 Moreover, review of the EOs showed several instances where the Steering Committee 

and the CRCC did not signify approval of the change request which are the subject of 
the EOs. 

 
8.26 The absence of the committee’s approval on the change requests or committee’s 

resolution recommending approval thereof casts doubt as to whether due diligence was 
performed prior to the approval of each of the enumerated changes. 

 
f. Project Management Team 

 
8.27 Further review and verification of Office Order No. 2018-275 dated August 1, 2018 

relative to the constitution of the PMT and Memoranda dated September 1, 2020 and 
January 4, 2021 disclosed that the team is significantly composed of consultants. 
Moreover, upon the resignation of the Project Director in 2020, no organic personnel 
were formally assigned to directly oversee the project implementation. 

 
g. Other deficiency noted 

 
8.28 As at December 31, 2020, the PMC computed penalty amounting to P11,700,632.60 

for Component A, however, it was not yet deducted in the payments made as the date 
of receipt of deliveries indicated in the computation of penalty cannot be traced in the 
attached documents. 

 
8.29 We recommended that Management: 

 
a. monitor and ensure implementation of the project in accordance with the 

provisions of the contract and the applicable laws, rules and regulations; 
 

b. consider stopping the implementation of the core applications to non-pilot 
sites until all core applications are accepted and integrated to one another, 
and the LTMS is functioning seamlessly; 

 
c. fast-track the connectivity of unconnected Medical IT Providers, and 

submit Management actions on non-compliance with LTO Memorandum 
Circular No. 2018-2157 by the 12 medical clinics directly connected with the 
LTMS; 

d. instruct the Acceptance Committee and Project Management Committee to 
check the receipt dates in the penalty computation and support it with 
appropriate documents as basis for the computation of liquidated damages; 
and 



197  

e. stop extending and changing dates of deliveries of items and activities in 
favor of the vendor without a valid and justifiable reason. 

 
Management Comments: 

 
8.30 Management commented the following: 

 
 The request for extension as requested by the Joint Venture before its approval 

were properly reviewed, evaluated and examined by Management; 
 

 Although it is indeed stated in the contract that implementation of the LTMS shall 
initially be confined to the 24 pilot sites, it must be highlighted that there were 
already modules that were accepted and paid for by the agency. Accordingly, 
Management deemed it best to roll out these modules to pilot and non-pilot sites 
so as to immediately realize the benefits of these individual systems, which have 
been paid for by government funds. If Management opted to wait to evaluate and 
accept all the components of the LTMS before implementing the same to pilot and 
non-pilot sites, it would have been confronted again with another situation 
wherein the agency had already paid for items that will be left unutilized. 
Consequently, to avoid this situation altogether, Management decided to utilize 
the systems that have been accepted by rolling these out to pilot and non-pilot 
sites. In any case, the outgoing LTO IT System is still operational and this 
complements the roll out of the implementation of the LTMS to the pilot and non- 
pilot sites; 

 
 LTO Memorandum Circular 2018-2157, on the requirement for Medical Clinics 

to use an LTO approved application program developed and managed by 
accredited Medical IT Service Provider, was issued to monitor medical clinics 
efficiently through the IT Medical Service Provider. With regards to the issuance 
of Medical Certificates of which the Stradcom Corp as the IT Provider, the issue 
of biometrics incompatibility has been resolved as well as the interface testing has 
been deployed to enable the Stradcom Corp to electronically submit medical 
certificates to the LTO IT System; 

 
 The Management will direct the corresponding Acceptance Committee and 

Project Management Committee to take this in consideration for proper 
computation of liquidated damages; 

 
 The Management will direct and take necessary measures to fully comply with 

this item; and 

 The Management before granting extensions always ensure that the reasons for 
the request are valid and justifiable. Nevertheless, this Management will not 
extend or change the dates of deliveries in favor of the vendor or will put the 
Agency in a disadvantage position. 



198  

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 
 

8.31 The commitment of the Management will be monitored by the Audit Team during the 
conduct of validation of prior year’s audit recommendation. 

 
 

Delayed/non-disposal of impounded motor vehicles/motorcycles 
 

9. The LTO Disposal Committee of SHO, Regional Office Nos. I, IV-A and X were 
not able to dispose 2,595 units of impounded motor vehicles stored in their 
respective compound/premises which are presumed to have been unreasonably 
and actually abandoned by their owners for failure to pay the necessary and 
required fines and penalties. The non-disposal of these motor vehicles despite the 
lapse of the six-month period from the date of its apprehension has prevented 
the agency from earning more revenues and from clearing the premises to 
provide additional space for vehicle storage. 

 
9.1 Among the mandates and functions of the LTO is the enforcement of land 

transportation rules and regulations, adjudication of traffic cases and collection of 
revenues for the government. 

 
9.2 Section 1 of PD No. 1729 states that “All motor vehicles, duly impounded by the 

Director of Land Transportation or by his deputy or by any other authorized officer, 
which are unreasonably and actually abandoned by their owners for failure to pay the 
necessary and required fines and penalties within a period of six months from the 
date of apprehensions, shall be sold and disposed of by the Bureau of Land 
Transportation in a public sale. Provided, that, in all cases before any public sale is 
done, the owners of the impounded and abandoned vehicles shall be given written 
notice and the option to redeem the said property after paying all the necessary 
charges within a period of fifteen (15) days from the receipt of such notice or to 
participate in the public bidding to be set and conducted by the Bureau.” emphasis 
supplied. 

 
9.3 Likewise, Joint Administrative Order (JAO) No. 2014-01 of the then DOTC (now 

DOTr), LTO and LTFRB provides the Revised schedule of fines and penalties for 
violations of laws, rules and regulations governing land transportation. 

 
9.4 Further, the Guidelines on the Disposal of Unclaimed Impounded Motor Vehicle 

prescribed that “the owners of the impounded motor vehicles approved for public sale, 
will be notified by mail for their right to settle penalty within fifteen (15) days upon 
receipt of the notice. Motor vehicles not claimed by its owner after the set deadline, 
shall be included on the final list of motor vehicles for public sale. Likewise, the floor 
price shall also be indicated in the publication. Moreover, supplemental guidelines 
were issued with instructions to identify the encumbered vehicle and to inform the 



199  

banks and/or financial institutions that said Motor Vehicle will be subject to public 
sale after the set deadline.” 

 
9.5 Records showed that as at December 31, 2020, the Law Enforcement Services (LES) 

has impounded 2,656 various motor vehicles. Further verification and evaluation of 
the documents submitted disclosed that 2,595 units of Motor Vehicle and Motorcycle 
which are impounded for more than six months remained undisposed as at December 
31, 2020. Details are shown in the following table.

SHO 84 12  38 22 12 - Of the 72 units of IMV due for disposal 
for public auction, 58 units were under 
encumbrance status to various 
financial institutions. The uniform 
guidelines was already approved by the 
Assistant Secretary, hence, letters have 
been sent to the concerned financial 
institutions informing them that the 
motor vehicles with encumbered status 
with their company were apprehended 
and due for disposal thru public 
auction. Disposal is yet to be scheduled 
upon receipt of the 
response of the Financial Institutions. 

I 264 - 2 83 124 55 - No public auction was undertaken for 
CY  2020.  On  March  14,  2019   and 
April 5, 2019, the Disposal Committee 
conducted a public auction, however, 
both public auction failed because of 
the absence of interested bidder due to 
high appraised value of IMVs. 

IV-A 1,123 49 54 178 447 291 104 No public auction was conducted for 
CY 2020. Lack of adequate and 
suitable impounding areas and 
facilities for the IMVs. Most of the 
vehicles have been continuously stored 
anywhere within the compound of 
various LTO district and extension 
offices, thus, exposing these units to 
elements that are causing their rapid 
deterioration and apparent pilferages 
of the parts of the IMVs. This 
prevailing situation caused the 
difficulties in disposing the impounded 
vehicles at their appraised value.. 

 
The 104 IMVs’ year of impoundment 
cannot be determined due to the 
absence of documents supposedly 
maintained by the LES.

Percentage 97.70%  
 

9.6 Despite the authority given to LTO to dispose the abandoned/unclaimed MVs, the 
disposal of the same has not been conducted as at audit date. Likewise, the non- 
disposal of these motor vehicles for over six months to more than five years has 
prevented the agency from earning substantial revenue and from clearing the LTO 
premises to provide additional space for vehicle storage. 

 
9.7 Also, considering that these impounded motor vehicles and motorcycles are kept in an 

open area within the LTO compound, the delay in the disposal of these impounded 
motor vehicles and motorcycles directly affects their auction price during the sale, and 
the continued exposure of these vehicles to elements causes deterioration, thus 
lowering their economic value. 

 
9.8 The Audit Team validated the action taken by Management on our previous 

recommendation and noted that the uniform guidelines for the disposal of IMVs has 
already been issued, hence should be disseminated to the concerned regional offices 
for proper implementation. 

 
9.9 We reiterated our previous recommendation that Management: 

 
a. fast track the disposal of the IMVs in accordance with the provisions of PD 

No. 1729 to prevent further deterioration and loss of economic value, free 
its premises with adequate space needed for future storage, generate 
additional income and prevent incurrence of additional expenditures; and 

 
b. instruct the personnel concerned of LTO-SHO to disseminate the approved 

uniform guidelines on the disposal of unclaimed Impounded MVs/MCs to 
the concerned regional offices.

Management Comments: 
 

9.10 Respective Management of concerned offices agreed to the recommendations and 
further commented as follows: 

 
LTO Region/ 

Office Management Comments 

SHO The uniform guidelines on the disposal of unclaimed Impounded 
MVs/MCs was already approved by the Assistant Secretary. Letters 
were already sent to the financial institutions/banks concerned 
informing them that the MVs/MCs are impounded and are due for 
disposal. Responses are yet to be received. 

I Waiting for additional guidelines from Central Office to proceed on the 
disposal of the IMVs. They informed that a draft Memorandum was 
prepared by the Committee concerned at the LTO Central Office for 
comment and approval of the Executive Director and Assistant 
Secretary. 

IV-A Management will consistently make representation with higher 
authorities for specific written guidelines in the handling, safekeeping 
and maintenance of Impounded Motor Vehicles. 

X Management will be reconstituting the Committee on Disposal of IMVs. 
 
 

Undelivered replacement plates to owners of motor vehicles – P2.159 billion 
 

10. Various circumstances caused delays in the procurement of plates, thus, resulted 
in the undelivered license plates of the registrants nationwide from CY 2014 to 
CY 2020 amounting to P2,159,036,340.00 corresponding to 8,120,837 pieces of 
MC and 2,632,302 pairs of replacement MV license plates. Further, the 
undelivered replacement plates indicated lapses in the performance by the LTO 
Management of one of its mandates, thus, depriving the registrants of their right 
to receive the plates they have paid for and affecting the efficient apprehension 
of the traffic violators. 

 
MVLPSP – Contract with PPI-JKG and ND from COA 

 
10.1 As one of the LTO’s mandates, the agency is required to produce and issue license 

plates to owners of registered motor vehicles (MVs), motorcycles (MCs), and trailers 
for a reasonable fee. Consequently, LTO formulated the Motor Vehicle License Plate 
Standardization Program (MVLPSP) to standardize license plates as the various 
designs makes it difficult for the agency to identify properly which plates are genuine 
or fake. In addition, the proliferation of dilapidated or illegible plates and the practice 
of not replacing lost license plates also prompted the implementation of the program. 



202  

10.2 Thus, on February 21, 2014, the then DOTC (now DOTr) entered into a contract with 
PPI-JKG Philippines, Inc. (PPI-JKG) for the delivery of 5,236,439 pairs of Motor 
Vehicle Plates and 9,968,017 pcs of Motorcycle Plates costing P1,989,846,820.00 and 
P1,196,162,040.00, respectively, totaling P3,186,008,860.00, which shall supply the 
LTO license plate requirements for CY 2013 to CY 2017 for the MVLPSP. However, 
the project was only implemented in CY 2014 because of budgetary constraints. The 
deliverables on the said contract are presented in the following table.

10.4 Meanwhile, upon audit of the related advance payment, Notice of Disallowance (ND) 

No, 2015-001-101-14 was issued due to noted infractions of various laws, rules and 
regulations. 

 
10.5 Relatedly, on December 11, 2014, the then Assistant Secretary issued Memorandum 

Circular No. AVT-2014-1895 requiring all 4-wheeled motor vehicles that will renew 
its registration in 2015 to apply for the replacement of its old license plates with the 
new standard license plate for P450.00. This was subsequently suspended on 
December 23, 2015. In 2015, the number of transactions tagged as renewal of 4- 
wheeled motor vehicles by the Management Information Division (MID)-Statistics 
Section totaled 3,413,624 nationwide. From the said transaction, LTO collected a total 
of P1,536,130,800.00, however, only 781,213 pairs of MV and 109 pcs of Trailer 



203  

plates were delivered and issued to the regional offices from CY 2014 to CY 2020, 
leaving an undelivered replacement plates of 2,632,302 pairs. 

 
Contract with Trojan JV and Proposed Bill on MC Plates 

 
10.6 In July 2017, the LTO proceeded to the procurement, through public bidding, of the 

license plates requirement for the period from July 2016 to December 2017 so that it 
could perform its mandate of issuing license plates pending the resolution of the appeal 
on the ND. On December 9, 2017, the contract therefor was executed in favor of the 
Joint Venture of Trojan Computer Forms Manufacturing Corporation and J.H. Tonnjes 
E.A.S.T. GmbH & Co. KG (Trojan JV) with a contract price of P978,800,000.00 for 
the deliverables listed in the following table. 

 
Table 53: MV/MC Plates to be delivered by Trojan JV 

Deliverables Quantity 
MV Plates with RFID windshield stickers 775,000 pairs 
MC Plates with Headlamp Tags 1,700,000 pcs 

 
10.7 On June 25, 2018, in anticipation of the passage of a new law regulating the new size 

and form of the MC plate which will prevent it from issuing new MC plates, LTO 
executed the Amendment to Order No. 2018-001 in connection with the contract with 
Trojan JV purposely to change the 1,700,000 pcs of MC plates with headlamp tags to 
999,474 pairs of MV Plates with RFID windshield stickers. 

 
Continuance with Amendment of PPI-JKG Contract After Lifting of ND 

 
10.8 The ND on the MVLPSP was lifted on July 9, 2018, during which time the contract 

with PPI-JKG Philippines still subsists, with a contract duration of three years and four 
months. The DOTr, through the LTO, decided to continue the program by executing 
an Amendment to the Contract dated April 10, 2019 to harmonize with, and meet the 
specification of the current Philippine Standard License Plates for Motor Vehicle and 
Motorcycle, but with no change in the contract amount as agreed by both parties. The 
undelivered quantities were converted to the following, as shown in Table 54.

10.10 However, Management informed that they have amended the schedule of requirements 

through Amendment Order No. 2 which was approved by the DOTr Secretary on 
September 26, 2020, but said amendment is yet to be received by the Supplier because 
the agency is still waiting for the resolution on the intra-corporate dispute on the 
ownership of the Joint Venture before the Regional Trial Court (RTC). 

 
Contract with Utsch JV 

 
10.11 On January 8, 2019, LTO entered into a contract with the Joint Venture of Columbia 

Technologies Inc. and ErichUtsch, AG (Utsch JV) for the procurement of 1,725,000 
pcs of Motorcycle Blank Plates and 1,725,000 pcs of Motorcycle RFID Stickers. 
However, the contract was terminated on June 17, 2019 on the ground that Utsch JV 
committed an act of misrepresentation in the Statement of Compliance to the Technical 
Specifications, particularly on the statement that the motorcycle blank plates shall have 
a 2D barcode containing data which can be stored in a digital signature envelope that 
can be verified offline using ISO/IEC 20248.

were noted due to legal impediments, contract termination, and changes in MC 
specifications in compliance with RA No. 11235, among others. Consequently, 
issuances of license plates to the public were also delayed. 

 
10.14 Comparison between the number of registrants and actual issued MV and MC plates 

from CY 2014 to CY 2020 disclosed the following backlog:

* Figures on new MV and MC are based on the submitted number of registrants by the Plate Unit from the MID while the figures on 
replacements is based on the listed renewals in CY 2015 as reported by MID-Statistics. 

 
10.15 As shown in Table 56, based on the total number of registrants, 8,120,837 or 63.59% 

pieces of new MC license plate and 2,632,302 or 77.11% pairs of replacement MV 
plates are yet to be produced/issued. The said registrants have paid P120.00/pc of MC 
plates and P450/pair of replacement MV plates. Therefore, LTO already collected at 
least P974,500,440.00 and P1,184,535,900.00, respectively, or a total of 
P2,159,036,340.00 for MV/MC license plates which remained undelivered to the 
registrants as at audit date. 

 
10.16 While the Audit Team acknowledge that the change in the MC license plates’ 

specifications brought by the passage of law is beyond the control of the LTO 
Management, the undelivered replacement MV plates still indicates lapses in the 
performance by the LTO Management of one of its mandates, thus, depriving the 
registrants of their right to receive the plates they have paid for and affecting the 
efficient apprehension of the traffic violators. 

 
10.17 We recommended that Management fast track the production of the backlog in 

MC plates and replacement MV plates from the existing contracts and 
subsequently issue the same to the respective registrants nationwide. 



207  

Management Comments: 
 

10.18 Management informed that they prioritized the production of plates for new registered 
MV and MC plates. As of June 7, 2021, 790,725 pairs of replacement MV plates were 
delivered to the District Offices for distribution to the dealers and issuance to the 
registered owners. 

 
10.19 Moreover, they informed that they are contemplating on assigning new plate numbers 

in conformance with the new format for MV plates. Policies and guidelines were 
drafted for the roll out of the LTMS on or before the first week of July 2021. 

 
10.20 Currently, they are producing both the backlog and current MC Plates. 

 
Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 
10.21 The commitment of Management to fast track the production of the backlog MC plates 

shall be monitored by the Audit Team. On assigning new plate numbers, we would 
like to inform our stand that unless RA No. 4136 is amended, the identification, 
numbers and letters of any motor vehicle number plate assigned to such motor vehicle 
should be permanent during its lifetime, in conformity with Section 17, Article III of 
the said Act. 

 
 

Erroneous computation of undelivered license plates 
 

11. The erroneous computation of the undelivered license plates for the amended 
contract of the Motor Vehicle License Plates Standardization Program resulted 
of the overstatement of the remaining requirements, thereby, exceeding the 
original contract price by P46,824,310.00. 

 
11.1 Following the lifting of ND No. 2015-001-101-14 through COA Decision No. 2018- 

334 dated July 9, 2018, the DOTr, LTO and PPI-JKG agreed to continue the contract 
and amend the deliverables to harmonize with, and meet the specification of, the 
current Philippine Standard License Plates for Motor Vehicle and Motorcycle. Further, 
in compliance with the aforesaid COA Decision, the Audit Team requested the COA 
Technical Services Office (TSO) to evaluate and review the original contract as well 
as the amended contract dated April 10, 2019. 

 
11.2 The Technical Evaluation Report dated January 14, 2021 of the COA TSO disclosed 

that the amended contract exceeded the original contract price by P111,086,160.00 
computed in Table 58.

11.8 We recommended that Management consider amending the schedule of 

requirements to correct the computation of the remaining deliverables so as not 
to exceed from the original contract price of P3.186 billion. 

 
Management Comments: 

 
11.9 Management informed that they have amended the schedule of requirements through 

Amendment Order No. 2 which was approved by the DOTr Secretary on September 
26, 2020 in which the deficiencies noted were already corrected. However, said 
amendment is yet to be received by the Supplier because the agency is still waiting for 
the resolution on the intra-corporate dispute on the ownership of the Joint Venture 
before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) and the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG). 

 
Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 
11.10 The Amendment Order No. 2 is yet to be reviewed and evaluated by the Audit Team 

to determine whether the erroneous computation have been corrected by Management. 
 
 

Unrecouped Advances to Contractors – P278.871 million 
 

12. The reported balances of Advances to Contractors account amounting to 
P1,086,551,678.23 as at year-end included unrecouped advances to contractors 
from terminated/rescinded projects and projects with inadequate information 
and/or documentation totaling P278,871,316.04 or 25.67% of the account 
balance, contrary to item 4.3 of Annex “E” of the Revised IRR of RA No. 9184, 
which may cause loss of government funds if these advance payments will not be 
recovered from contractors concerned. 



211  

12.1 Pertinent provisions of Annex “E” of the Revised IRR of RA No. 9184 provides: 
 

“4.2. The advance payment shall be made only upon the submission to and 
acceptance by the procuring entity of an irrevocable standby letter of credit of 
equivalent value from a commercial bank, a bank guarantee or a surety bond 
callable upon demand, issued by a surety or insurance company duly licensed by the 
Insurance Commission and confirmed by the procuring entity 

 
4.3. The advance payment shall be repaid by the contractor by deducting fifteen 
percent (15%) from his periodic progress payments a percentage equal to the 
percentage of the total contract price used for the advance payment.” 

 
12.2 Related audit disclosed that the Advances to Contractors account balance totaling 

P1,086,551,678.23 as at year end included unrecouped advances to 45 contractors of 
locally funded projects totaling P278,871,316.04 or equivalent to 25.67% of the 
account balance. Accordingly, these unrecouped advances have been outstanding in 
the books of accounts from 1 to 21 years and has been an audit observation in prior 
years due to its materiality and/or significance in amount and impact on the fairness of 
the presentation of the financial statements. Presented in the following table is the 
comparative breakdown of the details.

Total 64 1,086,551,678.23 81 1,776,719,315.74 

 
12.3 From the foregoing table, it is noteworthy to mention that Management was able to 

substantially reduce the balances of unrecouped advance payments by 
P687,198,544.10 or 46.28% for on-going projects from a high of P1,484,634,727.77 
to P797,436,183.67, with 14 projects remaining, and by P2,969,093.41 or 22.47% for 
completed projects from P13,213,271.93 to P10,244,178.52, with 5 projects 
remaining. 

 
12.4 Further, the unrecouped advance payments pertaining to rescinded/terminated projects 

and projects with inadequate information/documentation remained unchanged 
showing a balance of P197,691,845.13 and P81,179,470.91 respectively. On this note, 
the Project Management Services (PMS) of the DOTr commented that contractors of 
these projects were paid advances prior to termination and some have already been 



212  

recouped from their progress billings. However, an inventory of the posted surety 
bonds must be performed since some of these bonds were posted more than 10 years 
already. 

 
12.5 Accordingly, Management informed of their recovery plan for these unrecouped 

advance payments to contractors which include the following: (a) inventory and 
forfeiture of the surety bonds; (b) endorsement to the Legal Service for filing a case 
through the Solicitor General; and (c) follow up with the Solicitor General’s Office of 
the status of previously filed cases. However, as at audit date, Management has not 
submitted any proof that indeed their recovery plans are being implemented despite 
written follow up made by the Audit Team. 

 
12.6 Notwithstanding the above, it is emphasized that the failure to recover this significant 

amount of unrecouped advances to contractors is not only non-keeping with item 4.3 
of Annex “E” of the Revised IRR of RA No. 9184 but may also result in the loss of 
government funds if not recovered from the concerned contractors. 

 
12.7 We recommended to Management the following courses of action: 

 
a. consider the creation of a Committee who will be responsible for the 

following: (i) inventory and collection of money value of forfeiture of surety 
bonds; (ii) retrieval, review and verification of documents particularly those 
advances to contractors with inadequate information and documentation; 
and (iii) eventually, issuance of demand letters and/or legal remedies, if 
warranted, to recover outstanding advances made to concerned 
contractors; and 

 
b. closely monitor the status of project implementation and corresponding 

payments made to contractors concerned to ensure that advances made are 
recouped pursuant to item 4.3 of Annex “E” of the Revised IRR of RA No. 
9184. For completed projects with outstanding advances, apply the unbilled 
final billings of contractors from completed projects to any of their 
outstanding advances in order to recoup the full amount. 

 
 

Unliquidated fund transfers to various government agencies for 1 - 35 years 
 

13. Fund transfers to various government agencies for the implementation of 
programs and projects aggregating P19,576,219,559.76 remained unliquidated 
in the books for 1 to 39 years contrary to item 4.6 of COA Circular No. 94-013, 
thereby resulting in the accumulation of long outstanding Inter-Agency 
Receivables. 



213  

13.1 Pertinent provisions of items 4.6 and 4.9 of COA Circular No. 94-013 and reiterated 
under Section 63, Chapter 6, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs transfer of funds are as 
follows: 

 
“f. Within ten (10) days after the end of each month/end of the agreed period for the 
Project, the IA shall submit the Report of Checks Issued (RCI) and the Report of Cash 
Disbursements (RCDisb) to report the utilization of the funds. Only actual project 
expenses shall be reported. The reports shall be approved by the Head of the IA. 

 
g. The IA shall return to the SA any unused balance upon completion of the project, 
if stipulated in the MOA.” 

 
13.2 Furthermore, item 8.2 of COA Circular No. 2016-005 provides that: 

 
“The Head of the government entity shall file the request for authority to write-off 
dormant receivable accounts, unliquidated cash advances and fund transfers to the 
COA Audit Team Leader (ATL) and/or Supervising Auditor (SA). Xxx” 

 
13.3 Audit of the Inter-Agency Receivables account of the DOTr-OSEC also disclosed 

unliquidated fund transfers to various agencies totaling to P36,884,311,963.70, of 
which P19,576,219,559.76 or about 53% are past due accounts aged more than one (1) 
year to 35 years which resulted in the accumulation of long outstanding inter-agency 
receivables as shown in Table 64.

214  

IA Amount (in Php) Remarks 

  have remained unliquidated for four to six years due to non- 
availability of Certificate of Acceptance and other documents 
necessary to facilitate the recording in the books of accounts. The said 
projects are already operational and currently being used in the DOTr- 
MRT 3 premises. On this note, Management informed that a demand 
letter requesting pertinent documents supporting the completion of the 
project was already sent to PS-DBM on April 27, 2018. 

Due from GOCCs 
NHA 303,453,818.00 The fund transfer was made in CY 2019 and is composed of 

P265,444,848.00 for the relocation and resettlement of 287 affected 
informal settlers families (ISFs) from Caloocan City and Manila for 
the PNR North 1 (Malolos-Tutuban), North-South Commuter 
Railway Project; and P38,009,334.00 for the implementation of 
tagging and census validation activities and relocation and 
resettlement of 66 affected ISFs from Valenzuela City on the same 
project. These fund transfers remained unliquidated in the DOTr 
books for almost two years. Moreover, Management informed that 
demand letters were consistently sent to the IA every year. 

Due from LGUs 
Cebu City 
Government 
(CCG) 

460,260,500.00 The fund transfer was made on April 26, 2017 to cover the cost of land 
acquisition for right-of-way of Cebu Bus Rapid Transit Project 
(CBRTP), including relocation of the displaced landowners, residents, 
tenants, dwellers or ISFs. This has been unliquidated in the books for 
more than three years. Inquiry with the PMO revealed that the 
disbursement/utilization for this fund transfer will commence by May 
2021 as the DOTr has restarted communication with CCG in the re- 
opening of the agreement since it was suspended due to some changes 
in the project such as the alignment, designs and the proper agency to 
engage with. 

Total 929,220,598.00  
 

13.5 Likewise, the Inter-agency receivables account involves fund transfers totaling 
P123,372,586.12 which have remained unliquidated in the DOTr-OSEC books for two

13.6 From the foregoing, it is worthy to mention that some of the port projects implemented 
by PPA was already transferred to the LGUs, the end-users of the projects, as provided 
in the MOA dated May 12, 2015. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no demand letters 
were sent to the PPA requesting the liquidation and the return of the remaining funds, 
if any. It was informed however that the Accounting Division is not aware of the 
completion of the aforementioned projects due to the non-submission of necessary 
documents by the concerned PMO. 

 
13.7 In addition, the full amount of fund transfer to DENR made on February 28, 2018 and 

intended for the implementation of Reforestation Project of the New Bohol Airport 
Construction and Sustainable Development Project (NBACSEPP) remained 
unliquidated in the books of the DOTr to date despite project’s completion and 
operability on November 28, 2018. 

 
13.8 Furthermore, the Audit Team wished to point-out that the Inter-Agency Receivables 

amounting to P140,490,593.14 presented in Table 64, have been dormant in the books 
for over 10 to 35 years. Management informed that demand letters were consistently 
sent to the NGAs, GOCCs and LGUs concerned every February and August of the 
year but to no avail. Accordingly, the changes in IA’s personnel concerned and the 
non-availability of documents to support the utilization of fund transfers were some of 
the reasons of the non-liquidation thereof. 

 
13.9 If Management will not take further steps to ensure the timely liquidation of the fund 

transfers, the past due receivables will continue to accumulate and will pose the risk 
of failing to record project expenditures on time thereby, affecting the correctness of 
the related account balances. 

 
13.10 We recommended that DOTr-OSEC Management take the following courses of 

action: 
 

a. instruct the Accountant of MRT-3 to closely coordinate with the PS-DBM 
on the liquidation of fund transfers for various purchases for the DOTr- 
MRT3; 

 
b. demand liquidation and refund of unused funds for fund transfers with 

completed projects; 
 

c. closely coordinate with the PMO on the status of implementation of 
programs/projects to facilitate the proper recording of liquidations of fund 
transfers in the books of accounts; and 

 
d. consider to request authority to write-off dormant outstanding inter-agency 

receivables in accordance with COA Circular No. 2016-005. 



216  

Management Comments: 
 

13.11 The DOTr-MRT 3 commented that a letter request dated March 22, 2021 was sent to 
PS-DBM requesting for the submission of copies of liquidation report and other 
supporting documents. Moreover, it was informed that monitoring and coordination 
with PS-DBM will be undertaken apart from the regular reminder of sending demand 
letter to liquidate and/or refund the unused fund transfer for the completed 
procurement of PPE. 

 
 

Several deficiencies in the Right-of-Way acquisition 
 

14. Several deficiencies were noted in the Right-of-Way (ROW) acquisition, 
particularly on the payments of claims and incidental expenses, contrary to 
existing laws, rules and regulations hence, exposes the Department to the risk of 
possible adverse claims to the disadvantage of the government. 

 
14.1 The DOTr acquires real property needed as ROW, site or location in connection with 

the implementation of infrastructure projects. The acquisition thereof is either through 
donation, negotiated sale, expropriation or any other mode of acquisition as provided 
by law. 

 
14.2 Congruent thereto, the Audit Team reviewed the compliance of the Management with 

RA No. 10752, also known as The Right-of-Way Act, including existing internal 
policies and/or guidelines on the acquisition, and the propriety, correctness and 
accuracy of recorded ROW transactions in the books of account. In the course of 
review, several deficiencies were noted that signify non-compliance with existing 
laws, rules and regulations on ROW acquisition, details of which are discussed in the 
succeeding paragraphs. 

 
a. Checks were drawn in the name of the Attorney-in-Fact (AIF) instead of the 

landowners – P267.866 million 
 

14.3 Section 93 of PD No. 1445 provides that checks drawn against the treasury Checking 
Account for Agencies maintained with any government depository shall be made 
payable either directly to the creditor to whom the money is due or to a disbursing 
officer for official disbursement. (emphasis supplied) 

 
14.4 Moreover, Section 64 of PD No. 1529 states that any person may, by power of attorney, 

convey or otherwise deal with registered land and the same be registered with the 
Registry of Deeds of the province or city where the land lies. Any instrument revoking 
such power of attorney shall be registered in like manner. 

 
14.5 Audit of the submitted DVs for the payment of the ROW acquisitions revealed that 

check payments totaling P267,865,761.03 were drawn in the name of the AIF instead 



217  

of the landowners as indicated in the Transfer Certificate Title (TCT), contrary to 
Section 93 of PD No. 1445. These payments pertain to the following projects: 

 

Project Amount (in Php) 
1. Sanga-Sanga Airport Development Project 187,080,021.03 
2. Metro Manila Subway Project Phase I 80,785,740.00 
Total 267,865,761.03 

 
14.6 Related review of the attached Special Power of Attorney (SPA) disclosed that the 

various landowners constituted, appointed and granted the AIF the power and 
authority, among others, to do and perform different acts, such as requesting the DOTr 
to effect the payment of the property in the form of check or checks to be issued in the 
name of their representative. 

 
14.7 Verification disclosed that none from the submitted documents showed that the SPAs 

were registered with the Register of Deeds of the province or city where the land lies 
pursuant to Section 64 of PD No. 1529, thus, may not fully confer rights to the agent 
and/or Attorney-in-Fact to represent the principal and/or landowner to sell his or her 
real property. 

 
14.8 In view of the foregoing, the Audit Team firmly believes that drawing of checks should 

be made in the name of the creditor to whom the money is due not only in compliance 
with Section 93 of PD No. 1445 but primarily not to expose the Department to the risk 
of possible adverse claims to the disadvantage of the government. 

 
14.9 We recommended that Management of the DOTr-OSEC: 

 
a. refrain from allowing AIF as payee of the checks representing payment of 

the ROW claims so as not to expose the Department to the risk of possible 
adverse claims to the disadvantage of the government; and 

 
b. submit proof and/or any document showing that the SPA was registered 

with the Registry of Deeds of the province or city where the land lies 
pursuant to Section 64 of PD No. 1529. 

 
b. Payment of incidental expenses totaling P23.184 million were paid by the DOTr 

to the AIF rather than to the BIR or Office of the Municipality of Tawi-Tawi 
 

14.10 Section 5 (c) of RA No. 10752 provides that the Implementing Agency (IA) shall pay 
for account of the seller/owner, the Capital Gains Tax (CGT), as well as the 
Documentary Stamp Tax (DST), transfer tax and registration fees, while the owner 
shall pay any unpaid real property tax. 



218  

14.11 The law specifically provides that the IA shall pay all the incidental expenses relating 
to the acquisition of land, therefore payments should be made directly to the BIR 
and/or the office of the LGU where the land lies. 

 
14.12 Related audit of the ROW acquisition for the Sanga-Sanga Airport Development 

Project revealed several checks totaling P23,183,718.36 were drawn in the name of 
the AIF, thus in violation of the abovementioned provision of RA No. 10752. 

 
14.13 Moreover, further review also revealed that in spite of the payment of the 1st tranche 

as well as incidental expenses totaling P25,979,702.07 to the AIF for the six lots 
acquired by the DOTr in various dates in March 2018, three out of the six titles 
remained not transferred in the name of the Republic of the Philippines. 

 
14.14 Consequently, the payments of the incidental expenses to the AIF rather than directly 

to the BIR and the LGU concerned in connection with the ROW acquisition poses risk 
of paying inaccurate amount since payments thereof is based on the computation by 
the DOTr and not by the respective government offices. In like manner, the same may 
also be a contributory factor for the noted delays in the transfer of title of at least three 
lots despite payments made by the Department. Had the payments of incidental 
expenses been made by the DOTr directly to the respective government offices, the 
timely transfer of the TCT in the name of the Republic of the Philippines would be 
guaranteed. 

 
14.15 We recommended that Management of the DOTr-OSEC: 

 
a. strictly adhere to Section 5 of RA No. 10752, in any case, incidental expenses 

such as CGT, DST, transfer tax and registration fees must be paid by the 
IA/DOTr directly to the BIR or Office of the LGU where the land lies; and 

 
b. closely coordinate with the AIF to follow-up the status of the transfer of the 

three lots that remained not transferred in the name of the Republic of the 
Philippines. 

 
c. Non-availment of the services of Government Financial Institutions (GFI) 

and/or Independent Property Appraisers (IPA) in ROW acquisition 
 

14.16 Meanwhile, in order to determine the appropriate price offer for acquiring ROW, 
Section 6.2 of the IRR of RA No. 10752 requires the use of the following: 

 
a. A GFI with adequate experience in property appraisal to be selected by the IA 

through a competitive process; or 
 

b. An IPA accredited by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) or a professional 
association of appraisers recognized by BSP. 



219  

14.17 Relative thereto, it was noted that the DOTr did not engage/avail the services of GFI 
or IPA as mandated by law in the determination of the appropriate price offer for 
acquiring ROW for the Sanga-Sanga Airport Development Project, instead it has used 
the Fair Market Value (FMV) of P500.00 as reflected in the Certification provided by 
the Office of the Provincial Assessor of the Province of Tawi-Tawi in computing the 
cost per sq.m. of the parcels of land to be acquired for the project. Likewise, the 
Ordinance No. 004 series of 2011 Office of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan of Bongao 
Province of Tawi-Tawi was used in the determination of the cost estimate for the fruit 
bearing trees located on the affected parcels of land. 

 
14.18 Henceforth, we recommended Management’s compliance with Section 6.2 of the 

IRR of the RA No. 10752 to ensure that appropriate price offer is obtained for its 
ROW acquisition. 

 
 

Delayed and/or non-submission of various financial reports and incomplete supporting 
documents 

 
15. Delayed and/or non-submission of financial and budgetary reports precluded the 

prompt audit of the accounts and financial transactions impeding early detection 
and correction of errors/deficiencies and timely reporting of the audit results to 
Management contrary to various issuances of COA and pertinent provisions of 
the GAM for NGAs. Moreover, audit disclosed disbursements totaling 
P223,684,266.37 were not supported with complete documentation.

222  

15.3 Further, numerous DVs totaling 253 pertaining to CY 2020 transactions of the DOTr- 
OSEC had not been submitted to the Audit Team as at end of the 1st quarter of       CY 
2021, which also affected the timeliness of the audit. 

 
15.4 It bears to note that the delayed submission of the foregoing reports has been the 

subject of prior years’ audit findings, and despite repeated reminder and issuance of 
Audit Observation Memorandum (AOM), the problem still persists due to 
Management’s lack of effort and determination to improve its methods and strategies 
in the maintenance and preparation of financial reports. 

 
15.5 Consequently, the failure to submit the various financial and budgetary reports along 

with the related supporting documents to the Office of the Auditor within the 
prescribed period has impeded the Audit Team to conduct timely and comprehensive 
examination of the propriety, veracity and legality of the transactions. Thus, errors that 
may have been uncovered could not be addressed and corrected immediately. 

 
15.6 We recommended that Management of DOTr and LTO offices concerned: 

 
a. require all agency officials/personnel concerned to comply strictly with the 

timelines in the submission of financial reports and other documents set 
forth in COA Circular Nos. 92-125A, 94-103, 2009-001 and 2009-006 and 
GAM provisions to ensure timely delivery of our audit outputs; and 

 
b. develop and implement adequate measures that will enable the officials 

concerned to religiously comply within the set timelines/due dates of 
submission of the required reports and documents. 

 
Management Comments: 

 
15.7 The concerned Accountant of the DOTr–CARAGA admitted to the delays in the 

submission and committed to do their best by fast tracking the sorting and filing of 
DVs and related supporting documents to improve their performance in terms of 
submission of financial reports. 

 
b. Non-submission of BRS - P449.840 million 

 
15.8 Section 3, Chapter 21, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs states that the BRS shall be 

prepared in order to: (a) check the correctness of both the bank’s and agency’s/entity’s 
records; (b) serve as a deterrent to fraud; and (c) enable the agency/entity or bank to 
take up charges or credits recognized by the bank or agency/entity but not yet known 
to the agency/entity or bank. 

 
15.9 Further, the same Chapter of Volume I of the GAM for NGAs states that within 10 

days from receipt of the monthly Bank Statements (BSs), the Chief 
Accountant/designated staff is required to reconcile the BS with the General Ledger 



223  

(GL) and prepare the monthly BRS for each of the bank accounts maintained by the 
agency using the Adjusted Balance Method. The same shall be submitted to the COA 
Auditor with all the supporting documents and Journal Entry Vouchers within 20 days 
after receipt of the BS. 

 
15.10 Examination of records showed that various BRS as at year-end were not submitted as 

at audit date. Details are shown in the following table.

224  

15.11 Management explained in its letter dated June 18, 2020 that the non-submission of 
BRS for the Cash Treasury/Agency Deposit, Trust accounts is due to the requirement 
of the BTr for an analysis of the accounts instead of reconciliation statement in order 
to establish the recorded balances. Such analysis statements have yet to be prepared 
by the Management and submitted to COA for its audit/verification before these can 
be submitted to the BTr. 

 
15.12 Moreover, inquiry with the Management revealed that the non-submission of BRS 

particularly that of DOTr-OSEC could be attributed mainly to the late submission of 
the BSs by the LBP branches concerned. However, Management informed that in CY 
2019, they have applied for enrollment to the weAccess banking facility of the LBP 
wherein the BSs can be accessed via internet. Apparently, only two bank accounts 
have been applied since only two accounts per request can be accommodated by the 
LBP. As at audit date, Management is yet to receive a reply and/or approval of its 
application from the LBP. 

 
15.13 We recommended that Management: 

 
a. follow up the status of its application for enrollment to weAccess banking 

facility of LBP for the two bank accounts and request for the immediate 
approval thereof in order to facilitate the timely preparation and 
submission of the required BRS; 

 
b. consider enrolling all their bank accounts in online banking facility of the 

depository bank to facilitate timely preparation and submission of BRS; 
and 

 
c. submit the BRS and Analysis Statements of various bank accounts listed in 

Table 74 once reconciliation and analysis are completed. 
 

Management Comments: 
 

15.14 Management of DOTr-OSEC noted the recommendations. Likewise, they are hoping 
that with the approval of their application for the weAccess banking facility, access to 
bank statements shall be facilitated and thus, contributes to the timely preparation and 
submission of the BRS. 

 
c. Incomplete supporting documents - P223.684 million 

 
15.15 Audit disclosed several expenditures were paid by the respective DOTr and LTO 

offices despite the lack of necessary documents to support the claims against 
government funds, contrary to various issuances of the COA and pertinent provisions 
of the GAM for NGAs, as presented in the succeeding table.

Remittances to various financial institutions

following documents: 

 
a. Statement of Account (SOA) or billings 

which should serve as the basis for salary 
deductions and remittance to the institution 
were attached to the payments; and 

b. 39.54% of the total remittances of

from the concerned financial institutions.

Total 223,684,266.37 
 

15.16 The aforementioned observations are indicative of the concerned offices’ failure to 
exercise thorough review and examination of the completeness and appropriateness of 



227  

the documents required in the processing of claims; thus, resulted to the incurrence of 
expenses with doubtful validity. 

 
15.17 We recommended that Management of DOTr and LTO offices concerned cause 

the immediate submission of the lacking documents in compliance with DBM 
Budget Circular No. 2020-1 and COA Circular Nos. 2012-001 and 96-004. 
Likewise, instruct the respective Accountants to refrain from processing claims 
and/or payments to internal and external creditors unless the submission of 
required supporting documents have been complied with. 

 
Management Comments: 

 
15.18 Management of DOTr-OSEC commented that all those who physically reported to 

DOTr-Clark, DOTr-Columbia and DOTr Operations Center during the period of ECQ 
and MECQ in 2020 were duly authorized, and were given Inter-Agency Task Force 
on Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATFEIDs) which were signed and approved by the 
DOTr Undersecretary for Administrative Services. 

 
15.19 Likewise, the required certification from the Budget Division/Finance and 

Management Service that during the period of implementation of ECQ and MECQ in 
CY 2020 all mandatory expenses were covered and paid for by the available funds 
prior to the payment of Hazard Pay was already submitted. 

 
15.20 Moreover, Management of DOTr-CARAGA and LTO-NCR concurred with the given 

audit recommendations and committed to submit the lacking supporting documents 
and refrain from processing payments and/or claims unless the required supporting 
documents have been complied with. 

 
Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 
15.21 Management of DOTr-CARAGA should require the personnel who incurred 

discrepancy of the airfare to refund the excessive claim. Likewise, the personnel who 
incurred double return airfare tickets should also be required to refund the 
corresponding amount, for failing to submit an explanation or justification. 

 
 

Delayed and/or non-submission of Contract Agreements/Memorandum of Agreement 
(MOA) and some documentary requirements 

 
16. Several approved Contract Agreements and Memoranda of Agreement 

involving total amounts of P19,764,179,830.59 and P3,074,743,973.38, 
respectively, were submitted late, in violation of item 3.1.1 of COA Circular No. 
2009-001. Further, submitted contracts lacked documentary requirements as set 
forth under item 8 of the COA Circular No. 2012-001, thereby, hindered the 
effective and complete review of transactions. 



228  

a. Delayed and/or non-submission of Contract Agreements/MOA 
 

16.1 Item 3.1.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-001 provides that within five working days from 
the execution of a contract by the government or any of its subdivisions, agencies, or 
instrumentalities, including government-owned and controlled and their subsidiaries, 
a copy of said contract and each of all the documents forming part thereof by reference 
or incorporation shall be furnished to the Auditor of the agency concerned. 

 
16.2 Item 2.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-001 also provides that it covers all contracts, 

purchase orders, and the like, entered into by any government agency irrespective of 
the amount involved. 

 
16.3 Review of the submission of various contracts revealed the following delays:

16.4 Aside from the above, we also noted that 28 MOA with total cost of P3,074,743,973.38 
remained unsubmitted to the Audit Team as at year end. Seemingly, it has been 
Management’s practice to submit MOA, as an attachment to the DVs, only upon the 
submission of the supporting documents of the fund transfers made by the DOTr. It 
bears to emphasize that MOA creates a legal relationship between two parties working 
towards a shared goal, hence, takes the form of a contract. As such, it should also be 
submitted within the prescribed five-working day period set forth in item 3.1.1 of COA 
Circular No. 2009-001 in order to facilitate timely review. 



229  

16.5 Along this backdrop, it is to be noted that the delays in the submission of contracts at 
DOTr-OSEC particularly those that were perfected from March to December 2020 
could be attributed to the implementation of the Enhanced/Modified/General 
Community Quarantine not just in Metro Manila but throughout the country due to the 
global pandemic COVID-19. 

 
16.6 In response thereof, the Department has stepped up health and safety measures to 

combat the spread of this dreaded virus. Amongst these are: (a) regular sanitation of 
premises; (b) disinfection of documents; (c) adoption of the Alternative Work 
Arrangement (AWA) primarily to observe social distancing in the office; (d) wearing 
of masks and face shields; and (e) imposition of strict quarantine for individuals who 
were exposed and/or tested positive to COVID-19 etc. Accordingly, the 
implementation of these measures had significant impact on the Department’s day-to- 
day operations and eventually in the timely delivery of services to its stakeholders, 
among these are the Department’s adherence to the prescribed timelines embodied in 
RA No. 9184 and its Revised IRR in relation to its procurement activities and timely 
submission of perfected contracts and its supporting documents to the Office of the 
Auditor. 

 
b. Submitted contracts lacked documentary requirements 

 
16.7 Meanwhile, item 8 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 provides the basic requirements 

supporting the contracts for all types of procurements. Generally, each and every 
document supporting the contract has its own purpose, hence, it is imperative that the 
Management of the DOTr ensure that all required documents as provided in the said 
COA Circular have been prepared and submitted to the Office of the Auditor. 

 
16.8 In the conduct of auditorial review, it was noted that some documentary requirements 

to support the approved 26 contracts remained unsubmitted to the Office of the 
Auditor. Details are summarized in the attached Appendix 3. 

 
16.9 Nevertheless, it is highlighted that delayed submission and/or non-submission of 

contracts and its related supporting documents have precluded the conduct of 
immediate review and verification of transactions as to: (a) legality, (b) terms and 
conditions, (c) reasonableness of the contract cost, (d) completeness of documentary 
requirements, and (e) compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations. 

 
16.10 We recommended that the respective BAC Secretariat Division of the DOTr- 

OSEC and LTO offices concerned: 
 

a. comply with the timely submission of Contracts Agreements/MOA and its 
supporting documents pursuant to COA Circular No. 2009-001; and 



230  

b. submit the documentary requirements listed in the attached Appendix 3 in 
order to facilitate the timely and complete review and evaluation of the 
subject contracts. 

 
Management Comments: 

 
16.11 The Management of DOTr-OSEC assures the submission of succeeding contracts to 

the Office of the Auditor within the prescribed periods set forth under COA Circular 
2009-001 to enable the latter to conduct systematic and effective review process. 
Likewise, Management was able to submit certified true copies of the following 
documents: 

 
a. MOA between DOTr and City Government of Tagum dated December 29, 2020 

for the Mindanao Railway Project (as of date, the supplemental MOA between 
DOTr and City Government of Tagum is pending legal review, submitted is the 
draft supplemental MOA); and 

 
b. For the Procurement of Rail Bus Augmentation Program (Lot 1) Phase 2: (i) 

Valid Mayor’s Permit/Business Permit; (ii) Valid PhilGEPs Registration 
No./Certification; (iii) Annual Income Tax Return CY 2018 and CY 2019; and 
(iv) Duly Notarized Omnibus Sworn Statement. 

 
16.12 Meanwhile, Management of LTO-SHO informed that the following actions have been 

undertaken: 
 

a. Memorandum was issued to the Bids and Awards Committee Secretariat and the 
Project Management Team to resubmit the actual market studies conducted 
pertaining to the subject procurement and the project plan and system 
architecture and design that were allegedly lacking in the subject projects; 

 
b. The LTO Management has sent a letter to LDLA Marketing and Trading, Inc., 

Data Center Design Corp., Ebizolution Inc. and Sunwest Construction and 
Development Corp., Joint Venture to effect the necessary adjustments needed in 
the computation of the detailed costing for the Central Command Center (C3) 
project, and to resubmit set of system designs, plans and drawings for the C3 
Project; 

 
c. A letter was sent to Ebizolution, Inc. and Philnox (Philippines), Inc. Joint 

Venture to resubmit the complete set of designs, plans and drawing for the 
Infrastructure component or the Civil, Mechanical, Electrical Works pf the 
construction of the MVRES Project; 

 
16.13 Likewise, Management of LTO-NCR East and West has acknowledged the 

recommendations and commented that all perfected JO contracts were already 



231  

submitted to the Office of the Resident Auditor on March 9, 2021 and March 10, 2021, 
respectively. 

 
Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 
16.14 The Audit Team appreciates the LTO-SHO Management’s prompt action on the 

recommendation by directing the BAC Secretariat and the Project Management Team 
to resubmit the actual market studies conducted pertaining to the projects and the 
project plan and system architecture and designs. Also, the submission of the lacking 
documents in the DVs and sending letters to the concerned contractors to effect 
necessary adjustments in the computation of the detailed costing for C3 and requiring 
the resubmission of the complete set of designs, plans and drawing on the 
infrastructure component of MVRES project. However, the Audit Team maintains its 
stand that there was no document attached to the approved contract as submitted 
regarding the actual market studies conducted by Management and project plan, 
system architecture and designs of the two projects; and the lacking documents were 
not attached to the DVs to support the claim of the contractor as stated in the Audit 
Observation Memorandum (AOM). 

 
 

Irregular payment of salaries/wages of Job Orders (JOs) – P6.523 million 
 

17. The DOTr-CAR contracted the services of Job Order workers without first 
obtaining the approval of the Undersecretary of Administrative Service or 
equivalent office contrary to DOTr DO No. 2019-004, resulting in irregular 
expenditures on the payment of salaries/wages amounting to at least 
P6,522,694.56. 

 
17.1 The DOTr issued Department Order (DO) No. 2019-004 dated February 11, 2019 to 

provide guidance in the engagement and renewal of Contract of Service/Job Order 
workers by the DOTr central, regional and sectoral offices and attached agencies. The 
internal policies which shall be effective until December 31, 2020 were aligned with 
CSC-COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 1, s. 2017, as amended. 

 
17.2 Under the said DO, the concerned office/unit shall submit a request to hire or renew 

JO personnel to the Office of the Undersecretary of Administrative Service or 
equivalent office, which shall approve the contracts of those applicants found to have 
met the qualifications. 

 
17.3 Records show that in CY 2020, the DOTr-CAR engaged the services of various Job 

Order (JO) employees whose term of contract ranged to a maximum of three months, 
renewable at the option of the OIC-Regional Director of LTO-CAR who approves and 
signs as the First Party in the Contract of Service (COS). 



232  

17.4 Review of the contracts and other pertinent documents revealed that the DOTr-CAR 
did not submit a request to hire or request for renewal of its JO personnel to the 
Undersecretary of Administrative Service or its equivalent office, thus, the necessary 
review of required documents and approval of contracts by the appropriate offices 
were not made. All decisions to hire or renew JO personnel, including the review and 
deliberation of applicants and preparation and approval of service contracts were done 
at the regional level only. 

 
17.5 Inquiry disclosed that the Personnel Section was not aware of DOTr DO No. 2019- 

004, thus, the DOTr-CAR followed a different process in the hiring and renewal of JO 
personnel. 

 
17.6 The Audit Team respectfully pointed out that the lack of authority in the hiring of JO 

personnel rendered the disbursements arising from the payment of salaries/wages 
amounting to at least P6,522,694.56 irregular. 

 
17.7 We recommended that Management of the DOTr-CAR obtain post-facto 

approval of the service contracts entered into by the Regional Office with the JO 
employees from the Office of the Undersecretary of Administrative Service or 
equivalent office, and also acquire the required authority for the contracts which 
have yet to be executed. 

Management Comments: 
 

17.8 Management of the DOTr-CAR informed that they have already prepared a letter- 
request for post-facto approval of the subject service contracts and that the contracts 
for the period January to June 2021 have been forwarded to the DOTr CO for approval. 

 
 

Compliance with RA No. 9184 and its IRR 
 

18. Deviations from certain provisions of RA No. 9184 and its Revised IRR were 
noted, thus, defeating the very purpose of prescribing the necessary rules and 
regulations for the modernization and standardization of the procurement 
activities of the government. 

 
18.1 The RA No. 9184 and its Revised IRR were promulgated for the purpose of prescribing 

the necessary rules and regulations for the standardization and regulation of 
procurement activities of all government agencies and instrumentalities. Provisions 
therein are in line with the government’s effort to adhere to the principles of 
transparency, accountability, equity, efficiency and economy in the procurement 
process. 

 
18.2 Review of transactions in the procurement of infrastructures, goods and services 

undertaken by the DOTr indicated deviations from certain provisions of the 
procurement law, as presented in the next page.

Annex “C” of the RA No. 9184 and its Revised IRR 
prescribed the operational timeline of procurement. The 
maximum period allowed for the procurement of 
infrastructure project is 141 CDs to 156 CDs, reckoning on 
the date of the pre-procurement conference up to the 
issuance of the Notice to Proceed (NTP). 

Failure to comply with the 
maximum period allowed for the 
procurement of various 
infrastructure projects. Delays 
ranging from 3 to 377 CDs were 
noted during the review. 

Non-adherence to the 
maximum period allowed

Government Procurement Policy Board-Technical Support 
Office (GPPB-TSO) has clarified in its NPM No. 003-2020 
that documentary requirements for Negotiated 
Procurement (Emergency Cases) s hall be submitted at any 
 time before the award of the contract. Thus, it may be 
required during (a) submission of offer/s; (b) evaluation of 
offer/s; and (c) before the issuance of the NOA. The 
Procuring Entity should indicate in the Request for 
Quotation/Proposal (RFQ/P) at what stage of the 
procurement process these requirements shall be 
submitted. 

At DOTr-MRT3, documentary 
requirements such as valid 
Mayor’s Permit/Business Permit, 
valid PhilGEPS Registration 
Number/Certification, Annual 
ITR for CY 2019 and duly 
notarized Omnibus Sworn 
Statement were required from the 
bidders prior to payment and not 
prior the issuance of NOA of the 
purchase orders as prescribed by 
existing guidelines. 

The practice of requiring 
the bidder/s to submit 
mandatory documentary 
requirements prior to 
payment or after the 
issuance of the NOA, 
exposes the agency to the 
risk of awarding purchase 
order/s to supplier/s who

transparency, 
competitiveness, 
streamlined procurement 
process and public 
monitoring. 

DOTr-CARAGA Section 54.3. It requires that in all instances of alternative 
methods of procurement, the BAC, through the Secretariat, 
shall post, for information purposes, the notice of award, 
contract or purchase order, including all notice to proceeds 
if necessary, in the PhilGEPS website, the website of the 
Procuring Entity concerned, if available, and at any 
conspicuous place reserved for this purpose in the premises 
of the Procuring Entity, except for contracts with ABC of 
Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) and below. 

The procurements of office 
supplies, semi-expendable office 
equipment and furniture, and 
materials for the repair and 
maintenance of service vehicles 
and comfort rooms covered by 
approved purchase orders with 
amounts exceeding P50,000.00 
each were done by directly 
obtaining quotations from at least 
three different suppliers, instead of 
posting the Request for Quotations 
(RFQs) in the PhilGEPS website 
for at least 
three days, as required. 

Due to the failure of the 
concerned Agency 
personnel to 
conscientiously observe 
the existing rules and 
regulations on the 
procurement of goods, 
particularly on the use of 
the PhilGEPS and the 
procurement of common- 
use supplies available at 
the PS, the government 
was deprived of the 
opportunity to avail of the 
most advantageous 
prices. Section 53.2 and GPPB Resolution No. 03-2020 requires 

the mode of Negotiated Procurement during emergency 
cases or in case of imminent danger to life or property 
during a state of calamity, or when time is of the essence 
arising from natural or man-made calamities or other 
causes where immediate action is necessary to prevent 
damage to or loss of life or property, or to restore vital 
public services, infrastructure facilities and other public 
utilities. 

Procurement of 20 pieces thermal 
scanner priced at P4,500.00 each 
or a total price of P90,000.00, was 
not supported with quotations 
from at least three suppliers. 
Moreover, the mode of 
procurement was not indicated in 
any of the documents attached to 
the DV. There was also no BAC 
Resolution recommending to 
resort to the said alternative mode 
of procurement, as required in 
GPPB Resolution No. 10-2017. 

LTO-SHO Item 6 of Annex “G” of the RA No. 9184 and its Revised 
IRR states that “the procuring entity may create a Design 
and Build Committee (DBC) composed of highly technical 
personnel experienced in the field of architecture, 
engineering and construction in the particular type of 
project to be bid.” The DBC shall assist the PMO in the 
preparation of the conceptual design and performance 
specifications and parameters, review of detailed 
engineering design and supervision of the project. It shall 
likewise, assist the BAC and the Technical Working Group 
(TWG)   in   the   evaluation   of   technical   proposals  in 
accordance with the criteria set in the Bidding Documents. 

Failure to create a Design and 
Build Committee to assist the 
BAC and the TWG in the 
evaluation of the technical 
proposals in accordance with the 
criteria set in the bidding 
documents. 

It defeats the purpose of 
the guidelines for the 
procurement of the 
project under the design 
and build projects. 

Item 7 of Annex “G” of the RA No. 9184 and its Revised 
IRR provides that “No bidding and award of design and 

Failure to prepare/conduct the 
required preliminary design and

preliminary design and construction studies have been 
sufficiently carried out and duly approved by the Head of 
the Procuring Entity.” 

construction studies before the 
conduct of the bidding and award 
which should have been duly 
approved by the Head of the 
Agency. 

 

Item 4.a of Annex “G” of the RA No. 9184 and its Revised 
IRR provides that “the ABC shall be a lump sum amount 
that shall cover the cost of design and construction works 
(at the option of the procuring entity) based on the 
conceptual design and performance specifications and in 
accordance with the applicable provisions of the law or 
agency guidelines. The ABC shall be calculated based on 
either the appropriate quantities of work of the conceptual 
design, from standardized designs or from cost records of 
previous project of similar kind. “ 

 
Item 7 of Annex “G” of the RA No. 9184 and its Revised 
IRR states that no bidding and award of design and build 
contracts shall be made unless the required preliminary 
design and construction studies have been sufficiently 
carried out and duly approved by the HOPE. 

 
Section 7.1.All procurement shall be within the approved 
budget of the Procuring Entity and should be meticulously 
and judiciously planned by the Procuring Entity. xxx. 
(emphasis supplied) 

Failure of the Management of 
LTO-SHO to prepare the 
preliminary designs and 
construction studies as a basis in 
the computation of the ABC. 

 
Moreover, in the course of 
contract review, it was noted that a 
30% profit margin was added in 
the ABC of both the Central 
Command Center Project and the 
Motor Vehicles Recognition and 
Enforcement System (MVRES), 
despite that the acceptable 
variance in the current and 
prevailing market price is only 
10% for government procurement. 

The project was not 
meticulously and 
judiciously planned by 
Management, thus lapses 
in the preparation of the 
ABC resulted to 
significant discrepancies 
between the ABC and the 
bid offer of the 
contractor. 

LTO-NCR Item 5.1 of Annex “E” of the RA No. 9184 and its Revised 
IRR states that “Once a month, the contractor may submit 
a statement of work accomplished (SWA) or progress 
billing and corresponding request for progress payment for 
work accomplished. The SWA should show the amounts 
which the contractor considers itself to be entitled to up to 
the end of the month, to cover (a) the cumulative value of 
the works it executed to date, based on the items in the Bill 
of Quantities, and (b) adjustments made for approved 
variation orders executed.” Likewise, item 5.2 also 
provides that “The procuring entity’s 
representative/project engineer shall check the 
contractor’s monthly SWA and certify the amount to be 
paid to the contractor as progress payment. Except as 
otherwise stipulated in the Instruction to Bidders, 
materials and equipment delivered on the site but not 
completely put in place shall not be included for 
payment.” (emphasis supplied) 

Failure to prepare or non- 
submission of Statement of Work 
Accomplished (SWA) which 
serves as the vital document in 
capturing the detailed construction 
work activities and deliverables 
per line items of Bill of Quantities. 

The non-preparation 
and/or submission of a 
SWA as well as 
photographs         before, 
during and after 
construction of items of 
work for every progress 
billing rendered the 
accuracy of the 
percentage of works 
claimed doubtful and 
may result to 
overpayment, to the 
prejudice of the best 
interest of the 
government and a clear 
violation of items 5.1 and 
5.2  of  Annex  E  of  the 
2016 revised IRR of RA 
No. 9184. 

Section 12.3. A majority of the total BAC composition as 
designated by the HOPE shall constitute a quorum for the 
transaction of business, provided that the presence of the 
Chairperson or Vice Chairperson shall be required. 
Likewise, Non-Policy Matter No. 136-2012 provides that 
“Absence of Quorum during the Opening of Financial Bid 
necessitates the collegial action of the BAC.” Thus, 
quorum constituting a majority of the members of the BAC 
must be present during the opening of the financial 
proposal for the purpose of conducting negotiations with 
the consultant. 

The conduct of opening of bids is 
done in the absence of a quorum. 

In the absence of such 
quorum, any decision 
rendered by the Chairman 
and/or Vice Chairman, 
acting alone or in concert, 
is regarded as unofficial 
and cannot be attributed 
to the collegial action of 
the BAC. It follows that 
any decision rendered 
during this stage, is an act 
that was done outside the 
legal parameters set by 
RA No. 9184 and its 
Revised IRR. 

Section 7.3.4. The Project Procurement Management Plans 
(PPMPs) shall then be submitted to the Procuring Entity’s 
Budget Office for evaluation in order to ensure consistency 

The PPMP for the procurement of 
Personal Protective Equipment for 
COVID-19    was    prepared  and 

It  exposes the  agency to 
risks that PPMP may not 
be   consistent   with  the

agency’s budget proposal 
and in compliance with 
existing budgeting rules. 

Item IV.M of Annex “H” of the RA No. 9184 and its 
Revised IRR on the requirement of posting of Performance 
Security (PS) for infrastructure projects. 

Non-posting of PS for four 
projects categorized as 
“construction projects” prior to 
entering into Job Orders. 

While it is true that the 
cost of the project is 
below the threshold for 
public bidding and 
procurement thereof was 
through SVP, the posting 
of PS for projects 
categorized   as 
“construction projects” 
and/or  similar 
transactions be required 
from the bidder prior to 
entering into JO. The 
non-compliance thereof, 
exposes the agency 
against the risk of a 
contractor failing to fulfil 
contractual obligations 
and/or faithfully 
complete the 
performance of the 
work/s  as  specified  and 
agreed in the JO. 

LTO-I Section 7.2. No procurement shall be undertaken unless it 
is in accordance with the approved Annual Procurement 
Plan (APP), including approved changes thereto. 

Meals and snacks were incurred 
despite not being included in the 
approved APP of the agency. 

The non-inclusion of 
meals and snacks in the 
approved APP resulted in 
the over-the-counter 
purchases, thus, without 
the assurance that the 
most advantageous price 
for the government was 
obtained. 

Section 37.2.3.f. Other contract documents that may be 
required by existing laws and/or the Procuring Entity 
concerned in the Bidding Documents, such as the 
construction schedule and S-curve, manpower schedule, 
construction methods, equipment utilization schedule, 
construction safety and health program approved by the 
Department of Labor and Employment, and Project 
Evaluation Review Technique/Critical Path Method 
(PERT/CPM) or other acceptable tools of project 
scheduling for infrastructure projects. 

The Construction Safety and 
Health Program (CSHP) were not 
approved by the DOLE. 

The protection and 
welfare of the workers 
employed in the 
construction site were not 
ensured. 

LTO-IX Section 23.1.a requires the submission of Class “A” Legal 
documents by the BAC for the purpose of determining the 
eligibility of the bidder. 

Failure of the bidder to submit the 
required documentary 
requirements considered as Class 
“A” Legal documents. 

Non-submission of 
eligibility requirements, 
exposes the agency to the 
possible risk that bidders 
are not capable and 
legally qualified to 
undertake the project. 

LTO-XI Section 62.1. For the procurement of Goods, in order to 
assure that manufacturing defects shall be corrected by the 
supplier, a warranty security shall be required from the 
contract awardee for a minimum period of three (3) 
months, in the case of Expendable Supplies, or a minimum 
period of one (1) year, in the case of Non-expendable 
Supplies, after the acceptance by the procuring Entity of the  
delivered  supplies.  The  obligations  for the warranty 
shall be covered by either retention money in an amount 
equivalent to at  least  one percent  (1%) of every progress 

Failure to deduct or require a 
warranty security in the form of 
retention money or a special bank 
guarantee to at least 1% of the total 
contract price from the winning 
bidder/awardee. 

The Management cannot 
demand the winning 
supplier to change, and/or 
repair the defective items 
in case goods delivered 
are with manufacturing 
defects and damages 
within the warranty 
period, thus,

 payment, or a special bank guarantee equivalent to at least 
one percent (1%) of the total contract price. The said 
amounts shall only be released after the lapse of the 
warranty period or, in the case of Expendable Supplies, 
after consumption thereof: Provided, however, that the 
supplies delivered are free from patent and latent defects 
and all the conditions imposed under the contract have been 
fully met. 

 disadvantageous to the 
government. 

Section 3.a prescribes that the procurement of the 
Government of the Philippines (GoP) shall be governed by 
the principles of “Transparency in the procurement 
process and in the implementation of procurement 
contracts through wide dissemination of bid opportunities 
and participation of pertinent non-government 
organization.” Further, Section 3.b also states that 
“Competitiveness by extending equal opportunity to enable 
private contracting parties who are eligible and qualified 
to participate in competitive bidding.” 

Procurement of cell cards were 
made directly to LTO Coop 
without the distributions of 
canvass papers to at least three 
suppliers as required. 

The principles  of 
transparency and 
competitiveness as 
espoused by the 
Government 
Procurement Law or RA 
No. 9184 have not been 
upheld. 

LTFRB Item 3.4 of GPPB Circular No. 01-2020 states that the BAC 
or end-user unit or any other appropriate bureau, 
committee, support or procuring unit duly authorized by the 
HoPE, shall immediately recommend award of contract to 
one that has the legal, technical, and financial capability to 
undertake the procurement at hand and comply with the 
technical specifications, scope of work or terms of 
reference set by the procuring entities. 

  

Item 3.5 of GPPB Circular No. 01-2020 requires that the 
contract includes a warranty clause where the supplier, 
distributor, manufacturer, or contractor warrants that, for 
the period stipulated covering the procurement at hand, the 
Goods or Infrastructure Projects to be delivered or 
implemented shall be free from defects and conform to 
quality standards and technical specifications of the said 
contract. 

  

 

18.3 We recommended that Management of the respective DOTr offices strictly 
adhere to the provisions of RA No. 9184 and its Revised IRR in all stages of 
procurement of infrastructures, goods and services to uphold transparency, 
efficiency and economy in the procurement process. 

 
Management Comments: 

 
18.4 During the exit conference, the Inspectorate Team of the DOTr-CAR informed that 

they have already completed the computation of the liquidated damages taking into 
consideration one work suspension which documents were inadvertently not attached 
to the Disbursement Vouchers or submitted to the Audit Team. He also mentioned that 
the said computation and the work suspension related documents will be submitted to 
the Audit Team the soonest. 

 
18.5 On the other hand, Management of the DOTr-MRT3 committed to adhere to GPPB 

NPM No. 003-2020, particularly on the submission of documentary requirements 
anytime before the award of contract for procurements through Negotiated 
Procurement due to Emergency. 



238  

18.6 Meanwhile, Management of the LTO–SHO commented that Memoranda were issued 
to the BAC Secretariat and the Project Management Team was required to resubmit 
the actual market studies conducted pertaining to the procurement and project plan and 
system architecture and design that were allegedly lacking in the subject projects. 
Moreover, during the exit conference, the Management of LTO-NCR informed that it 
already conducted re-orientation seminar on RA No. 9184 last February 2021. 

 
18.7 Furthermore, the Management of LTO-I, V and XI committed to adhere strictly to the 

provisions of the RA No. 9184 particularly on the requirement of CSHP, imposition 
of liquidated damages and deduction of 1% retention money or posting of warranty 
security. 

 
 

COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER GOVERNMENT LAWS, RULES AND 
REGULATIONS 

 
Gender and Development 

 
19. Control gaps and/or improvement opportunities were noted in the GAD 

planning, budgeting and implementation of the GAD programs, projects and 
activities (PPAs) of the DOTr, thereby, contrary to existing laws, rules and 
regulations on GAD and defeated the very purpose of addressing gender issues 
towards gender equality and women’s empowerment. 

 
19.1 Gender and Development (GAD) refers to the development perspective and process 

that is participatory and empowering, equitable, sustainable, free from violence, 
respectful of human rights, and supportive of self-determination and actualization of 
human potentials. It seeks to achieve gender equality as a fundamental value that 
should be reflected in development choices and contends that women are active agents 
of development, not just passive recipients of development. 

 
19.2 The Philippine Constitution recognizes the fundamental equality before the law of 

women and men. The Magna Carta of Women (MCW) or RA 9710 and the General 
Appropriations Act (GAA) and other laws enshrine this policy. As such, all 
government departments, including their attached agencies, offices, bureaus, state 
universities and colleges (SUCs), GOCCs, LGUs and other government 
instrumentalities shall formulate their annual GPBs within the context of their 
mandates to mainstream gender perspectives in their policies, programs and projects. 
GAD Planning shall be integrated in the regular activities of the agencies, the cost of 
implementation of which shall be at least five percent (5%) of their total budgets. The 
computation and utilization shall be implemented in accordance with the specific 
guidelines provided therein. 



239  

19.3 Verification and analysis of CY 2020 GAD Plan and Budget of the DOTr-OSEC, LTO 
and LTFRB offices disclosed the following control gaps and/or improvement 
opportunities:

Specific laws, rules and 
regulations on GAD Deficiencies Noted Reasons 

DOTr-OSEC Paragraph 2 of Section 31 of the 
General Provisions of FY 2020 
GAA or RA No. 11465 states that 
the GAD Plan shall be integrated in 
the regular activities of the agencies, 
which shall be at least five percent 
(5%) of their budgets. For this 
purpose, activities currently being 
undertaken by agencies which relate 
to GAD or those that contribute to 
poverty alleviation, economic 
empowerment especially of 
marginalized women, protection, 
promotion, and fulfillment of 
women’s human rights, and practice 
of gender-responsive governance are 
considered sufficient compliance 
with said requirements. xxx 

Of the total current appropriations of 
P27,099,878,116.09, only 
P125,446,121.00 or equivalent to 
0.46% was allocated for the 61 
identified GAD programs/ 
projects/activities, thereby, resulting 
to shortfall of P1,230,334.466.47 or 
equivalent to 4.54% from the required 
5% of the said budget. 

Lack of knowledge of the GAD 
Technical Working Group (TWG) 
members in the attribution of the 
GAD funds to the Department’s 
programs, projects and activities. 
Likewise, GAD TWG members 
are neither project planners nor 
implementers, thus, attribution 
was not taken into consideration. 
Nonetheless, it was informed that 
there was a reconstitution of the 
GAD TWG members last year, 
wherein project planners from the 
Planning Transportation Divisions 
of the DOTr were involved to help 
the Department in attributing the 
GAD funds to the Official 
Development Assistance (ODA) 
and FAPs. 

DOTr-OSEC No allocation for ODA and FAPs. 

LTO-VII Likewise, for the GAD of the 
Official Development Assistance 
(ODA) and Foreign Assisted 
Projects (FAPs), Section 2 (a), Rule 
I of the IRR of RA No. 7192 requires 
that “A substantial portion of the 
official development assistance 
funds received from foreign 
government and multi-lateral 
agencies and organizations shall be 
set aside and utilized by the agencies 
concerned to support programs and 
activities for women.” 

Management of LTO-VII has 
allocated P4.541,034.15 for the 
implementation of their CY 2020 
GAD PAPs, however, audit disclosed 
that such amount was below the 
required 5% of their budget. 

No reason provided in the CML. 

LTFRB Review of the Annual GAD AR for 
FY 2020 showed that the LTFRB 
GAD budget and actual expenditures, 
including attributions, were below the 
minimum 5% requirement at only 
P21,055,902.50 and P19,905,966.98 
or 4.65% and 4.40%, respectively, of 
the total allotments for FY 2020 
amounting to P452,909,096.10. 

The LTFRB GAD FPS 
representative commented that 
they based their budget 
formulation on the information 
provided by the LTFRB Financial 
and Management Division and 
they did not want to exceed from 
what they are allowed to spend for 
GAD activities. 

  Based on the Annual GAD AR for FY 
2020, the LTFRB GAD Focal Point 
System (FPS) planned to conduct 18 
client-focused GAD activities and 13 
organization-focused GAD activities 
with total costs of P13,241,937.50 and 
P7,813,965.00, respectively. Whereas, 
the actual expenditures amounted to 
P13,230,040.67 and P6,675,926.31, 
respectively. 

 

  Moreover, there were GAD activities 
that were supposed to address two 
GAD  mandates/gender  issues  which 
were planned to be executed during the    
year    but    were    not  actually

DOTr-OSEC Section 8.2 of PCW-NEDA-DBM

the GAD Focal Point System

Likewise, Section 8.2 of the same

GAD ARs for the previous year in 
accordance with the budget call. 

The submitted GPB along with their 
Annual GAD AR were not approved 
and endorsed by the Philippine 
Commission on Women (PCW). 

The noted deficiency could be 
attributed to the difficulties of 
other sectoral offices of the 
Department in formulating the

of the comments of the PCW 
reviewer, thereby, resulting to the 
delays in the submission and 
eventually to the approval and

19.5 Congruent thereto, the Management of the DOTr-OSEC, LTO and LTFRB offices 
confirmed that indeed several GAD PAPs were not implemented during the year due 
to the COVID-19 global pandemic, hence, resulting to significant unutilized amounts. 

 
19.6 Certainly, the deadly virus that struck the country has significantly affected the 

implementation of the identified GAD-related activities, however, the Management of 
the concerned offices could have considered other platform to implement the 
programmed and/or planned activities. Further, there is a need to implement the 
identified GAD-related activities in order to fully address gender issues towards 
gender equality and women’s empowerment and/or fully attain GAD objectives. 

 
19.7 In view of the foregoing, we recommended the following courses of action: 

 
a. comply with the allocation of at least 5% of its total appropriation as 

required by the MCW and the GAA; 
 

b. strictly comply with the requirements of the IRR of RA No. 7192 regarding 
the implementation of the Resource Mobilization for Gender Concerns and 
Women’s Activities of the ODA funds received by the Department from 
foreign government and multi-lateral agencies and organizations, and to 
properly prepare and accomplish the GPB incorporating the attributions of 
budget and programs specifically for FAPs and the related Accomplishment 
Report thereon addressing gender related activities/issues; 

 
c. ensure that GPB, along with the Annual GAD AR, are duly approved and 

endorsed by the PCW. Likewise, submit approved and endorsed reports to 
the assigned Audit Team pursuant to COA Circular No. 2014-001; 

 
d. closely monitor and consider in the ensuing year the implementation of the 

identified GAD PPAs that were affected by the global pandemic COVID- 
19, not only to maximize the utilization of the allocated budget but primarily 
to achieve the GAD objectives pursuant to Section 31 of RA No. 11465; 



242  

e. speed-up the establishment and completion of the GAD database/SDD with 
adequate and systematically gathered sex-disaggregated data which will 
provide the basis for gender analysis, planning, budgeting, programming 
and policy formulation and undertake gender analysis to identify and 
confirm existing gender issues and ensure that the programs, projects and 
activities are responsive to said issues; and 

 
f. require the GFPS to undertake regular capacity development training on 

GAD, including gender mainstreaming, gender analysis and gender- 
responsive planning and budgeting, to further their understanding and 
appreciation of GAD and be updated on GAD-related laws and 
commitments. 

 
Management Comments: 

 
19.8 Management of the offices concerned commented the following: 

 
Region/ 
Office 

Management Comments 

DOTr-OSEC The failure to comply with the allocation of at least 5% of its total appropriations can be 
attributed to the non-inclusion of ongoing ODA and FAPs in the GAD Budget due to the 
incapacity of the planners and implementers in the application of HGDG Tool. Moreover, 
Management committed to timely prepare and submit the GPB and AR and develop and 
implement effective strategies and sustainable plans to comply with GAD laws, rules and 
regulations. More so, Management commented that the CY 2020 unimplemented activities 
were included in the GPB for CY 2021. 

LTO Management of LTO-IVA and X commented that they will comply with the 
recommendations. Meanwhile, Management of LTO–III explained that due to the 
pandemic, they were inhibited to fully implement their GPB for CY 2020, however, they 
committed to comply with the recommendation. 

LTFRB The LTFRB GAD FPS representative commented that they based their budget formulation 
on the information provided by the LTFRB Financial and Management Division and they 
did not want to exceed from what they are allowed to spend for GAD activities. 

 
Moreover, there were GAD activities that were supposed to address two GAD 
mandates/gender issues which were planned to be executed during the year but were not 
actually conducted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

 
 

Programs/Projects for Senior Citizen and Differently-abled Persons 
 

20. The DOTr was not fully compliant with Section 32 of the General Provisions of 
RA No. 11465 or the GAA of FY 2020, thereby, concerns and needs of Senior 
Citizens (SCs) and Persons with Disabilities (PWDs) were not completely 
addressed. 

 
20.1 Section 32 of RA No. 11465, otherwise known as the GAA for FY 2020 provides that 

“all agencies of the government shall formulate plans, programs and projects intended 



243  

to address the concerns of senior citizens and persons with disability, insofar as it 
relates to their mandated functions, and integrate the same in their regular activities.” 

 
20.2 Moreover, all government infrastructures and facilities shall provide architectural or 

structural features, designs or facilities that will reasonably enhance the mobility, 
safety and welfare of persons with disability pursuant to Batas Pambansa Bilang 344 
and RA No. 7277. 

 
20.3 For CY 2020, results of audit of programs/projects related to SCs and PWDs of the 

DOTr are summarized in the following table. 
 

Region/ 
Office Results of Audit 

DOTr- 
OSEC 

The DOTr-OSEC was compliant with the formulation and allocation 
of funds for the implementation of identified programs/projects 
purposely to enhance and/or improve the mobility, safety and welfare 
of SCs and PWDs. However, only nine out of 14 programs/projects 
were implemented during the year due to the COVID-19 global 
pandemic, which resulted in the low utilization rate of the allocated 
budget and thus, related objectives thereof were not fully achieved. 

 
The DOTr-CARAGA failed to allocate and formulate 
programs/projects to address the needs of this sector of society, 
contrary with the above-cited provision of RA No. 11465. 

LTO- 
SHO 

Except for LTO-NCR and LTO-II, the LTO-SHO and all other LTO 
regional offices have substantially complied with Section 32 of the 
GAA for FY 2020. 

LTFRB The LTFRB Central Office and its RFROs have conducted several 
programs/activities which address the concerns of senior citizens (SCs) 
and persons with disabilities (PWDs) despite the pandemic. 

 
20.4 We recommended that Management of the DOTr offices concerned pursue the 

implementation of identified programs/projects which were put on hold due to 
the COVID-19 global pandemic and continue the formulation and integration of 
programs/projects in the agency’s regular activities in order to address the 
concerns and/or enhance the mobility, safety and welfare of SCs and PWDs in 
our transportation system. 

 
Management Comments: 

 
20.5 The Management of DOTr-OSEC commented that the CY 2020 programs, activities 

and projects which were partially implemented have already been undertaken. 
Accordingly, the Task Force on Accessibility (TFOA) has successfully conducted 
focused group discussions with various disability subsectors including blind or low 
vision persons, deaf or hard of hearing, women with disabilities, persons with learning 



244  

and developmental disabilities, and wheelchair users, which helped the TFOA gain in- 
depth understanding of various accessibility issues faced by these vulnerable 
transportation users. In like manner, seminars and workshops intended to capacitate 
the members of the TFOA in the development, formulation and or harmonization of 
accessibility design standards, operational guidelines, and other related policies, and 
at the same time to populate the contents of the proposed Accessibility Manual, have 
also been conducted. 

 
20.6 Moreover, other programs, activities and projects have also been planned to address 

the concerns and enhance the accessibility, mobility, safety and general welfare of the 
vulnerable transportation users, including but not limited to persons with disabilities, 
elderly, women, children and indigenous peoples. 

 
 

Remittance of taxes withheld, GSIS, Pag-IBIG, and PhilHealth premiums 
 

21. For CY 2020, offices under the DOTr-OSEC, DOTr-CAR, DOTr-CARAGA, 
LTO and LTFRB have substantially complied with the laws, rules and 
regulations pertinent to the withholding and remittance of taxes to the BIR, and 
premium contributions to the GSIS, Pag-IBIG and PhilHealth.

The reversion made by DOTr-OSEC to

unreconciled amount of P5,495,192.56 
was not supported with reconciliation 
report, hence, has no basis. 

 
LTO-NCR had inadvertently double its

However, LTO-NCR was not able to 
remit the total amount of P769,494.95 
due to the failure of the Accountant to 
conduct periodic verification, analysis 
and reconciliation of the account 
balances. While LTO-Region III failed 
to remit the prior years’ unremitted 
balance of P430,808.45 due to the 
difficulty in determining the nature of 
the individual transactions in the 
account. 

 
Likewise, late remittance of GSIS

LTFRB-V may result to the incurrence 
of unnecessary penalties/charges, and 
may affect the employees’ availment of

its 13 regional offices had regularly 
complied with the proper deductions 
and remittances of the premiums and

P783,533.33 was not remitted due to the 
failure of the Accountant to conduct

failed to remit the balance of

LTFRB-V is late to remit its PhilHealth

which may result to the incurrence of 
unnecessary penalties/charges, and may 
affect the employees’ availment of

21.2 We commended Management of DOTr-Proper, LTO and LTFRB offices for their 
substantial compliance with existing rules and regulations for the remittances of 
taxes withheld, GSIS, Pag-IBIG, and PhilHealth premiums. 

 
 

Uninsured Properties 
 

22. The DOTr-OSEC, DOTr-CAR, DOTr-CARAGA, LTO and LTFRB offices, 
except LTO-NCR, LTO-VI and XII, LTFRB-VI and X, have substantially 
complied with the Insurance of Property, Plant and Equipment pursuant to 
Section 2 of RA No. 656. 

 
22.1 Section 2 of RA No. 656 provides that “In order to indemnify or compensate the 

Government for any damage to, loss of, its properties due to fire, earthquake, storm, 
or other casualty there is hereby established the “Property Insurance Fund”, which 
shall consist of all moneys resulting from the liquidation of the insurance constituted 
in section three hundred forty of the Revised Administrative Code and from premiums 
and other incomes.” 

 
22.2 Moreover, Section 11 of the said law states that “Each government shall include in its 

annual appropriation the amount necessary to cover the premiums for the insurance 
of its properties during each fiscal period and remit the same immediately to the 
System as provided in section ten hereof.” 



247  

22.3 Review and evaluation of the Insurance Policies of the DOTr-Proper and LTO and 
LTFRB offices revealed that the following offices were not able to fully insure their 
assets contrary to the above regulation, as seen in Table 69.

thereby depriving the agency of adequate protection against any

Total 250,533,580.16  
 

22.4 The inability of the regional offices concerned to obtain insurance coverage to all its 
insurable assets is not only contrary to the provision of RA No. 656 but exposes the 
agency to the risk of non-recovery and/or non-indemnification in case of loss or 
damage. 

 
22.5 We recommended that Management direct the designated Supply/Property 

Custodian to insure all its insurable assets with the General Insurance Fund of 
the GSIS against any insurable risk to ensure that the government will be secured 
or indemnified for any damage or loss of properties. 

 
Management Comments: 

 
22.6 The Management agreed to the above recommendation. 

 
22.7 Management of LTO-NCR (West) commented that MVs with Plate No SHS-278 and 

SHS-292 was turned-over by LTO-SHO to LTO-NCR on November 25, 2020. Motor 
vehicle bearing plate No. SHS-292 was already registered in February 2021 and 
complied with TPL and comprehensive insurance from GSIS General Insurance Fund. 
Motor Vehicle bearing plate No. SHS-278 will be registered on August of which the 
same procedure will be made. Furthermore, the Property Section acknowledges the 
given recommendations and will strictly comply with the provisions of property 
insurance under RA No. 656, EO No. 33 and COA Circular No. 92-390, thereby, 



248  

ensuring that all insurable properties will be fully covered under GSIS General 
Insurance Fund for CY 2021. 

 
22.8 Management of LTO-XII informed that the insurance coverage for PPE amounting to 

P209,432.32 was paid to General Insurance Fund of the GSIS last January 11, 2021 
per check number 992662. Moreover, the Management already issued a memorandum 
for the acting Regional Property Officer to be mindful of his responsibilities and to 
monitor and submit on time the updated list of inventory of insurable properties with 
the GSIS so that the necessary insurance coverage for all assets can be covered by 
GSIS General Insurance Fund; and thereafter, ensure prompt renewal thereof for 
continuity of their coverage. 

 
 

Enforcement of COA Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges 
 

23. The unsettled suspensions, disallowances and charges as at December 31, 2020 
accumulated to P585,969,040.07, P1,406,089,894.58 and P13,566,942.20 
respectively, due to Management’s inability to enforce settlement from the 
persons held liable contrary to pertinent provisions of COA Circular No. 2009- 
006, which prescribes the use of the 2009 Rules and Regulations on Settlement of 
Accounts (RRSA). Moreover, suspensions, disallowances and charges, issued 
prior to the effectivity of the RRSA, in the amount of P173,412.25, 
P143,101,300.69, and P3,669,527.09, respectively, remained unsettled. 

 
23.1 The RRSA, as prescribed in COA Circular No. 2009-006, , provides the following 

rules on the settlement of suspensions, disallowances and charges: 
 

Section 7.1.1 “The Head of the Agency, who is primarily responsible for all 
government funds and property pertaining to his agency, shall ensure that: xxx (b) 
the settlement of disallowances and charges is made within the prescribed period; 
(c) the requirements of transactions suspended in audit are complied with; and xxx” 

 
Section 9.4 – “A suspension should be settled within ninety (90) calendar days from 
receipt of the Notice of suspension otherwise the transactions covered by it shall be 
disallowed after the auditor shall have satisfied himself that such action is 
appropriate.” 

 
Sections 10.4 and 11.4 – “The settlement of disallowances and charges made within 
six months from receipt of the Notice of Disallowance or Charge.” 

 
23.2 Moreover, COA Memorandum No. 2009-084 dated November 16, 2009 requires strict 

monitoring of the enforcement of the settlement of disallowances and charges, which 
have become final and executory, either covered or not by Auditor’s Order or Final 
Order of Adjudication.

23.5 Included in the unsettled suspensions of P585,969,040.07 are the partial payments 

made to the concerned contractor of MRT-3 totaling P527,761,083.18 relative to the 



250  

contract for the Design, Supply and Delivery of 48 LRVs for MRT-3 which were 
suspended in audit on October 15, 2018 due to non-submission of documentary 
requirements and various deficiencies in the Technical Specifications of the contract. 
The evaluation of the documents at hand is still on-going due to its highly technical 
nature. 

 
23.6 Furthermore, part of the unsettled disallowances are the payments made to the 

concerned contractor amounting to P964,256,082.18 for the services rendered relative 
to Procurement for the DOTC-MRT3 System Maintenance Services Provider, 43 
LRVs General Overhauling, Total Replacement of the Signaling System and 
Additional Maintenance Works. Said payments were disallowed in audit on July 26, 
2018 because the purported Joint Venture of Busan is not technically, legally and 
financially capable contractor, hence, the expenditures related thereto are illegal and 
irregular pursuant to COA Circular No. 85-55A as updated by COA Circular No. 2012- 
003. 

 
23.7 Suspensions of P173,412.25, Disallowances of P143,101,300.69 and Charges of 

P3,669,527.09 prior to the effectivity of the RRSA are not included in the foregoing 
balances but are deemed disallowances which shall continue to be enforced as 
provided in Section 28 of the RRSA. 

 
23.8 We recommended that Management strictly monitor the immediate settlement of 

the suspensions to prevent the same from maturing into disallowances; and 
refund of the disallowances, particularly those which were already final and 
executory through the withholding of salaries or institute legal remedies. 

 
Management Comments: 

 
23.9 During the exit conference of the DOTr-CAR, the OIC Assistant Regional Director of 

the LTO-CAR claimed that there were deductions made from the payrolls in the prior 
years but were inadvertently not applied to some of the disallowances. It was further 
mentioned that gathering of the pertinent documents is ongoing. 

 
 

Audit of COVID-19 Funds 
 

Deficiencies noted in the transfer of funds under the RA No. 11494 or the Bayanihan to 
Recover as One Act – P9.500 billion 

 
24. The DOTr had not attained optimum use of its P9,500,000,000.00 budgetary 

appropriation under RA No. 11494 “Bayanihan to Recover as One Act” due to 
delays noted in the release of funds to the IAs. Moreover, of the total Notice of 
Cash Allocations (NCAs) received under this Act, P9,398,574,014.69 or 98.93% 
thereof was utilized as at year-end, thereby resulting in the reversion to the Btr 
of P101,425,985.31 or 1.07%. In addition, required liquidation reports were not 



251  

submitted by the IAs to the DOTr, contrary to item 4.6 of COA Circular No. 94- 
013 and Memoranda of Agreement (MOA) with IAs. 

 
24.1 Following the outbreak of COVID-19 in the Philippines, Presidential Proclamation 

No. 922 s. 2020 was issued declaring a State of Public Health Emergency throughout 
the country purposely to facilitate the implementation of relevant provisions of RA 
No. 11332 (Mandatory Reporting of Notifiable Diseases and Health Events of Public 
Health Concern Act) and to capacitate government agencies and local government 
units to undertake critical, urgent and appropriate response and measures in a timely 
manner to curtail and eliminate the COVID-19 threat. 

 
24.2 The Congress, on the other hand, enacted RA No. 11469 (Bayanihan to Heal as One 

Act) and RA No. 11494 (Bayanihan to Recover as One Act) on March 24, 2020 and 
on September 11, 2020, respectively. RA No. 11469 declared the existence of a 
national emergency arising from the COVID-19 situation and a national policy in 
connection therewith, and to authorize the President of the Philippines for a limited 
period and subject to restrictions, to exercise powers necessary and proper to carry out 
the declared national policy. While RA No. 11494 provided for COVID-19 response 
and recovery interventions, including the mechanisms to accelerate the recovery and 
bolster the resiliency of the Philippine economy and the funds for the purpose. 

 
24.3 Section 4 (gg) of RA No. 11494 identified as among the COVID-19 response and 

recovery interventions the DOTr’s assistance to critically impacted businesses in the 
transportation industry, including transport cooperatives in the form of the following: 
direct cash or loan interest rate subsidy; grants for applicable regulatory fees; 
substitution of refund option to travel vouchers; grants for fuel subsidy and/or digital 
fare vouchers, as may be necessary; and grants for training, equipment, facilities, test 
kits and necessary personnel, on coping with increased health risks arising from 
infectious diseases. 

 
24.4 Further, Section 10 (g) of the said Act appropriated the amount of P9,500,000,000.00 

to finance specific programs of the DOTr, to wit: P2,604,000,000.00 to assist the 
critically impacted businesses in the transportation industry, P5,580,000,000.00 to 
provide temporary livelihood to displaced workers in the industry through service 
contracting of public utility vehicles (P3,000,000,000.00 for public utility jeepney 
drivers and P2,580,000,000.00 for drivers of other public utility vehicles), 
P1,000,000,000.00 to develop accessible sidewalks and protected bicycle lanes, 
procurement of bicycles and related safety equipment for bicycle distribution, sharing 
and lending programs, and procurement of bicycle racks. 



252  

24.5 Accordingly, a total of P9,500,000,000.00 was allotted to the DOTr intended for the 
following programs/activities/projects:

24.6 Relatedly, review of various documents disclosed that the DOTr has requested the 

release of the corresponding allotment from the DBM on October 2, 2020. However, 
it was noted that the allotment to cover the funding requirements for the 
implementation of the aforementioned programs/activities/projects was released under 
SARO No. SARO-BMB-A-20-0018176 amounting to P9,500,000,000.00 only on 
October 28, 2020 or 26 days from the date of request. On the same date, related Notice 



253  

of Cash Allocation (NCA) No. NCA-BMB-A-20-0011963 was also released and 
credited to the account of the DOTr. 

 
24.7 Apart from the late release of the SARO, several deficiencies were noted that 

hampered the attainment of the optimum use of the allocated budget to the DOTr, to 
wit: (i) delays of 6 up to 24 calendar days in the release of funds by the DOTr; and (ii) 
reversion of unutilized NCA. Moreover, our audit disclosed the non-submission of 
required liquidation reports by the concerned IAs to the DOTr as at year end. The 
details of which are discussed in the succeeding paragraphs. 

 
a. Delays of 6 up to 24 calendar days in the release of funds to IAs 

 
24.8 On various dates, the DOTr entered into Memoranda of Agreement (MOA) with 

different IAs for the implementation and distribution of grants to critically-impacted 
businesses in maritime, aviation and road sectors in the Philippines. 

 
24.9 Congruent thereto, examination of Disbursement Vouchers (DVs) for the fund 

transfers revealed that it took 6 up to 24 calendar days from the date of the MOA or 
the date of the submission of required documents to the date the transfers of funds were 
made. Moreover, delays were noted in the implementation of the programs/projects 
vis-à-vis target schedule. Details are shown in the following table.

24.10 Inquiry with the concerned personnel at the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Road 
Transport and Infrastructure revealed that the bike share program of MMDA took a bit 
of time with the preparation of the joint case and market studies on the implementation 
of the program as well as the finalization of the Terms of Reference, Program of Works 
and MOA since the program will introduce a new technology and will cover a huge 
area of operation. Accordingly, the said activities then lead to a slight setback in the 
finalization of documents for the transfer of funds. 



255  

24.11 Management also informed that delays were observed during the COVID-19 pandemic 
period which adversely affected the movement and signing of the documents. 
Accordingly, the current work arrangement within the Department and the fact that 
some of the signatories were in Manila and the mandatory disinfection of documents 
received, transmittal of the documents from one office to another also took some time. 
Moreover, considering the internal processes that had to be undergone before the funds 
are released and transferred, minimal delays were incurred. 

 
24.12 We acknowledge the explanation provided by the Management, however, the Audit 

Team wish to point out that the delays incurred in the transfer of funds to the IAs have 
a significant impact in the timely implementation of identified programs/projects. As 
shown in Table 37, all of the projects are yet to be completed with rates of completion 
ranging from 0% to 67.71%. 

 
24.13 It is our contention that had the DOTr released the funds from the date of submission 

of the required documents by the IAs, there would have been a greater number of 
critically impacted businesses benefited by the assistance program as at year end and 
the attainment of the optimum use of its allocated budget of P9.5 billion would have 
ensued. Further, it is emphasized that time is of the essence during this pandemic, thus, 
expeditious implementation of identified COVID-19 related programs/projects is 
necessary to ensure that funds are fully and properly utilized for its purpose and 
eventually to guarantee achievement of objectives for which such funds were released. 

 
b. Reversion of lapsed NCA to the BTr - P101.426 million 

 
24.14 Item 4.2.2 of NBC No. 578 dated January 6, 2020 provides that NCA under the Regular 

MDS Sub-account shall be valid until last working day of the third month of the quarter 
it was received. 

 
24.15 Review of the related documents showed that the DOTr received NCA amounting to 

P9,500,000,000.00 to cover the funding requirements for the implementation of the 
programs/activities/projects of the DOTr relative to RA No. 11494, however, only 
P9,398,574,014.69 or 98.93% of the funds were transferred as at December 31, 2020, 
resulting in the reversion to the BTr of P101,425,985.31 or 1.07% thereof. Details are 
shown in the following table.

24.16 As shown in Table 72, the reverted NCA was for the CPA and LTFRB amounting to 
P37,630,000.00 and P63,795,985.31, respectively. Interview with Management 
disclosed that while the MOA with CPA and LTFRB were dated as notarized on 
October 30, 2020 and December 29, 2020, respectively, the same were drafted only in 
November to December 2020 and actual signing by the other contracting parties were 
made only in January 2021 due to the delay in the receipt of the MOA, hence, fund 
transfers were not made in CY 2020 resulting in the reversion of the NCA totaling 
P101,425,985.31 at year-end. Moreover, the target implementation schedule which 
was supposed to start in October 2020 and will end in December 2020 was not 
achieved, depriving the target beneficiaries urgently in need of the 
assistance/subsidies. 

 
24.17 Additionally, Management informed that the funds for LTFRB amounting to 

P63,795,985.31 were originally allocated for a proposed program of LTFRB on the 
waiver of regulatory/supervision fees, however, in October 2020, the allocation was 
repudiated by the DBM as the rationale of the implementation is to cover the amount 
of fees waived in consideration of the pandemic and thus the proposed program was 
rejected. The said amount was then suggested to be allocated as additional funds for 
the implementation of a cash subsidy program to cover tourist transport services which 
were also greatly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The MOA with LTFRB for 
the Provision of support to road-based public transport stakeholders through Direct 
Cash Subsidies and PUV Service Contracting Program was revised and was received 
from LBP on January 8, 2021, after which the request for issuance of the NCA and the 
release of the funds were immediately submitted to DBM. However, the NCA for the 
P63,795,985.31 funds was yet to be issued by the DBM. 

 
24.18 In like manner, DOTr and CPA encountered several delays in securing the hard copies 

of the duly signed supporting documents due to courier issues from Cebu province to 
DOTr Clark Office/Manila, and vice versa, which affected the processing of the 
financial documents for submission to the DBM. However, the CPA began the 
implementation of the Bayanihan 2 intervention on November 28, 2020, as soon as 
both parties secured the electronic copies of the signed documentary requirements for 
the transfer and utilization of the Bayanihan 2 fund, until April 21, 2021. This is to 
immediately provide assistance to the domestic ships calling in CPA ports that are 
significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. 

 
24.19 Further, although the available appropriations under RA No. 11494 were carried over 

until June 30, 2021 pursuant to RA No. 11519 approved on July 27, 2020 and NBC 
No. 585 dated January 26, 2021, the Department is encouraged to maximize the 



257  

utilization of its funds for timely and efficient implementation considering that these 
programs and projects are urgent in nature. 

 
c. Non-liquidation of transferred funds by IAs 

 
24.20 Item 4.6 of COA Circular No. 94-013 provides that within 10 days after the end of 

each month/end of the agreed period for the Project, the IA shall submit the Report of 
Checks Issued (RCI) and the Report of Cash Disbursements (RCDisb) to report the 
utilization of the funds for all the actual project expenses. Only actual project expenses 
shall be reported. The reports shall be approved by the Head of the IA. 

 
24.21 Moreover, respective MOA with the IAs requires that within 10 days after each month, 

liquidation report shall be submitted to the DOTr such as but not limited to RCI and 
Report of Disbursement certified correct by the Accountant and approved by the 
Official concerned, including copies of paid disbursement vouchers in connection with 
the implementation of the Project. 

 
24.22 Review of the Statement of Subsidiary Ledger Balances (SSLB), however, disclosed 

that no liquidation reports were submitted by the IAs and recorded in the books of the 
DOTr as at year-end despite the implementation of about 0.15% to 67.71% as at year- 
end as shown in Table 71, contrary to the above-mentioned regulations. 

 
24.23 We recommended that Management of the DOTr-OSEC: 

 
a. moving forward, ensure the timely completion of all the requirements 

stipulated in the MOA and endeavor to achieve the implementation 
schedules/timelines set for the identified programs/projects of the DOTr 
through close monitoring and coordination with the IAs concerned; 

 
b. timely prepare the MOA and other necessary project documents to avoid 

reversion of NCA so as not to delay the implementation of the identified 
COVID-19 programs/projects of the Department; and 

 
c. require the respective IAs to submit liquidation reports in compliance with 

pertinent provisions of item 4.6 of COA Circular No. 94-013 and MOA with 
respective IAs. 

 
Management Comments: 

 
24.24 Management committed that they will continue to closely coordinate and regularly 

communicate with the IAs to monitor the timely implementation of the programs and 
to ensure that the funds allocated therein are properly utilized. 

 
24.25 Management commented that as at April 21, 2021, the LTFRB has submitted its initial 

liquidation reports for the Service Contracting and Direct Cash Subsidy Programs. On 



258  

the other hand, they are coordinating with the other IAs with regard to the submission 
of their respective liquidation reports, and that they are working hand-in-hand with the 
Accounting Division in monitoring thereof. 

 
24.26 Meanwhile, Management commented that based on the April 30, 2021 report of CPA 

to the DOTr, it was able to assist around 16,100 vessels with an estimated amount of 
P33,013,328.72 or 87.73% under the Bayanihan 2. 

 
 

Delayed Implementation of the Service Contracting Program under RA No. 11494 
 

25. Delays in the implementation of the Service Contracting Program ranging from 
2 to 10 weeks as at December 31, 2020 resulted in the minimal fund utilization of 
only P59,720,089.25 or 1.07% of the total project fund of P5,580,000,000.00, 
thereby delaying the intended benefits to the PUV drivers and operators. 
Furthermore, only a total of 29,871 drivers or 49.79% of the 60,000 targeted 
driver-participants were registered in the Program as at year-end. 

 
25.1 The LTFRB was designated as the principal implementing agency of the Public Utility 

Vehicle (PUV) Service 
Contracting Program 
of the DOTr which is 
part of the COVID-19 
Response and 
Recovery Interventions 
of the government and 
funded through RA No. 
11494 or the Bayanihan 
to Recover as One Act 
in the amount  of 
P5,580,000,000.00. 

 
a. Minimal fund utilization due to delayed project implementation 

 
25.2 Review of the Program reports and other pertinent documents revealed that delays in 

the implementation of the Service Contracting Program ranging from 2 to 10 weeks as 
at 31 December 2020 resulted in the minimal fund utilization of only P59,720,089.25 
or 1.07% of the total project fund of P5,580,000,000.00, thereby delaying the intended 
benefits to the PUV drivers and operators. 

 
25.3 Based on the POW and the Year-end Accomplishment Report (AR), delays were 

incurred in various activities for the implementation of the Program, as shown in Table 
73.

25.4 As a result of the aforementioned delays, only a total of P59,720,089.25 or 1.07% of 
the total project cost was obligated/utilized and only P8,811,042.96 or 14.75% thereof 
was actually paid/disbursed as at December 31, 2020, details of which are as follows:

Obligation over Allotment  1.07%  
Disbursement over Obligation   14.75% 

 
25.5 The LTFRB Financial and Management Division informed that some of the reasons 

for the low utilization rate were the late downloading of the funds in November 2020, 
delayed launching of the Program and late and incomplete submission of required 
documents by the driver-participants in December 2020 which delayed the processing 
of their initial subsidies. 

 
25.6 Further, the PIU reported several issues and concerns which also delayed the 

implementation of the Program including delays in the submission of requirements by 
the driver-participants, inconsistencies in the names of the drivers, lack of equipment 
for registration in the mobile application, etc. However, the PIU is implementing 
measures to address these issues.

b. Minimal Registration of Driver-Participants 
 

25.7 Despite the nationwide coverage of the Program, only a total of 29,871 drivers or 
49.79% of the 60,000 targeted driver-beneficiaries were registered in the Program 
whose data/information have already been submitted to the PIU/LTFRB, broken down 
as follows:

25.8 Based on the foregoing table, only 54.90% of them have already been oriented about 
the Program. Further, out of the 8,865 driver-participants who have already signed 
their respective SCA, only 4,716 contract agreements have been countersigned by the 
authorized LTFRB signatories and duly notarized. Finally, only 346 of the 2,125 
driver-participants who have been on-boarded/uploaded in the monitoring dashboard 
of the SM have actually activated their LTFRB Driver App. 

 
25.9 Management reported that the PIU and the Systems Manager are making efforts and 

maximizing solutions to increase the drivers on-boarding to the Program. Upcoming 
strategies include the launching of Hotline for LTFRB Driver App concerns to address 
the errors in logging in to the application that the drivers have been encountering, the 
launching of website for online registration and orientation for the Program and the 
improvement of the monitoring dashboard in the coming year. 

 
25.10 The intention of the Program is to alleviate the burden brought about by the COVID- 

19 pandemic to the affected PUV drivers and operators by providing them with 
government subsidy in exchange for their continued operation to serve the riding 
public, especially the healthcare workers and authorized persons outside residence, 
during this pandemic. However, considering the extended nationwide coverage of the 
Program, the very limited time to implement the same before the expiration of the 
funds and the limited manpower of the PIU, it is a must that all processes should be 
simplified and expedited in order for the intended benefits to be maximized and served 
expeditiously. 

 
25.11 We recommended that the LTFRB Management review the guidelines and 

simplify the processes for the implementation of the Service Contracting Program 
to maximize the utilization of the project funds and the participation of qualified 
PUV drivers and to serve the intended benefits expeditiously.

Slow implementation of Direct Cash Subsidy under RA No. 11494 
 

26. Out of the total Direct Cash Subsidy Program fund of P1,161,214,210.00, only 
the amount of P963,696,500.00 or 82.99% of which was utilized and only 
P839,520,500.00 or 87.11% thereof was actually disbursed, hence, delaying the 
benefits intended for the Program beneficiaries. 

 
26.1 To provide relief and cushion the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in the 

daily operations of the critically-impacted public transport stakeholders, the DOTr 
committed to implement the Provision of Support to Road-Based Public Transport 
Stakeholders Through the Direct Cash Subsidies which is funded through RA No. 
11494 or the Bayanihan to 
Recover as One Act in the 
amount of P1,161,214,210.00. 
This is a one-time cash subsidy 
amounting to P6,500.00 per 
public utility vehicle (PUV) 
unit which shall be used for (a) 
fuel purchase and other 
operational and maintenance 
expenses; (b) equipment, 
supplies, or facilities necessary 
on coping with increased health 
risks arising from the COVID-
19 pandemic; and (c) payment 
of loans. 

 
26.2 The DOTr, LTFRB and Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) entered into a MOA to 

distribute the cash subsidies to the operators of different modes of land transport PUVs, 
individual and consolidated, who are holders of a valid Certificate of Public 
Convenience (CPC) or Provisional Authority (PA). 

 
26.3 Review of the pertinent reports and documents relative to the implementation of the 

Program as at December 31, 2020 showed that out of the total Program fund of 
P1,161,214,210.00, only the amount of P963,696,500.00 or 82.99% of which was 
utilized and only P839,520,500.00 or 87.11% thereof was actually disbursed, hence, 
delaying the benefits intended for the Program beneficiaries. 

 
26.4 As at December 31, 2020, a total of 129,157 PUV units nationwide have been provided 

with cash subsidies out of the total target of 178,244 PUV units. Details are provided 
in Table 75.

26.5 Management informed that they started late on the over-the-counter (OTC) payment 

scheme due to the COVID-19 restrictions. The Technical Working Group (TWG) 
pushed for the bank-to-bank transactions in order to limit the face-to-face interactions 
with the operators in compliance with the IATF directives. Unfortunately, other 
operators could not provide their bank account details despite using the tri-media 
platform to gather the information. Thus, the TWG, together with the LBP and LTFRB 
Legal Office, formulated the Joint Implementing Guidelines and Data Sharing 
Agreement for OTC. 

 
26.6 Further, for the bank-to-bank (LBP to non-LBP) transactions, the submitted bank 

account details of the operators were either incomplete or incorrect upon initial 
assessment by the LTFRB Cashier Unit. Some accounts with complete details were 
also rejected during the actual crediting by the LBP via PESONet/FINDES (Financial 
Data Entry System) due to their dormant status. Some of the local banks submitted by 
the operators, especially those from the Regional Franchising and Regulatory Offices 
(RFROs), were not accredited by the LBP System. Hence, the TWG had to contact 
these operators in order to re-upload their files to the LBP System. 

 
26.7 The validity of the Program fund, as provided in RA No. 11494, was originally until 

December 31, 2020, however, it was amended by RA No. 11519 and was extended 
until June 30, 2021. Nevertheless, the intention of the Program was to alleviate the 
burden brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic to the affected land transport 
operators. With the delayed distribution of the cash subsidies to the qualified Program 
beneficiaries, the intended benefits are likewise delayed. 

 
26.8 We recommended that the LTFRB Management: (a) facilitate the immediate 

distribution of the remaining cash subsidies to the intended beneficiaries before 
the lapse of the Program fund to maximize its benefits; and (b) require the LBP 
to immediately return any excess/unutilized fund, including all interests earned, 
if any, to the DOTr once it lapses.

Deficiencies noted relative to COVID-19 expenditures – P1.772 million 
 

27. Payments for COVID-19 Hazard Pay of P1,771,500.00 to the DOTr-OSEC 
employees were not subjected to applicable withholding taxes, contrary to BIR 
Revenue Regulation No. 11-18. Further, the DOTr-MRT3 has failed to include 
in the contractual agreements warranty clause for the procured supplies in 
relation to COVID-19, contrary to pertinent clauses of GPPB Circular No. 01- 
2020 and NPM No. 003-2020. 

 
27.1 The escalating number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 and the related serious threat 

to the health, safety, security and disruption to the country’s economy causes the 
urgent need of the government agencies to undertake necessary measures to mitigate, 
if not contain, the transmission of the virus. Relative thereto, the Management of the 
DOTr has undertaken several procurements amounting to P253,923,726.19 charged to 
their regular fund intended for the prevention, protection and control of the COVID- 
19 within its premises. Details are shown in the following table.

27.2 Related audit of the COVID-19 expenditures charged against the general fund of the 
DOTr particularly those incurred by DOTr-OSEC and MRT3 disclosed some 
deficiencies, as discussed in the succeeding paragraphs: 

 
a. Non-provision of withholding taxes for COVID-19 Hazard Pay 

 
27.3 Administrative Order No. 26 dated March 23, 2020 authorized the grant of the 

COVID-19 Hazard Pay to qualified government personnel and contract of service 
(COS)/job order (JO) workers who physically report for work in areas during the 
implementation of an Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) and Modified 
Enhanced Community Quarantine (MECQ) in the amount not exceeding P500.00/day 
per person. 



264  

27.4 The grant of the COVID-19 Hazard Pay shall be effective beginning March 17, 2020 
and will be terminated once the area of their respective work stations has already been 
placed under General Community Quarantine (GCQ) or Modified General Community 
Quarantine (MGCQ). 

 
27.5 Section 6 (B) (13) Paragraph 4 of the Revenue Regulation No. 11-18 states that “xxx 

For purposes of these regulations, hazard pay shall mean the amount paid by the 
employer to MWEs who were actually assigned to danger or strife-torn areas, disease- 
infested places, or in distressed or isolated stations and camps, which expose them to 
great danger or contagion or peril to life. Any hazard paid to MWEs which does not 
satisfy the above criteria is deemed subject to income tax and consequently, 
withholding tax on the said hazard pay.” (emphasis supplied) 

 
27.6 Examination on test basis of Disbursement Vouchers (DVs) and related supporting 

documents for the payment of hazard pay totaling P1,771,500.00 revealed that DOTr- 
OSEC employees were paid in full based on the P500.00 per day computation on their 
rendered days, however, it was noted that the same were not subjected to applicable 
withholding taxes. 

 
27.7 Accordingly, the failure of the Management to appropriately withheld and remit to the 

BIR the correct amount of taxes from payments of Hazard Pay to DOTr employees is 
not only contrary to the provision of the aforementioned BIR Revenue Regulation but 
may also entail punishment by fines and other related charges and/or sanctions. 

 
b. Non-inclusion of warranty clause in the approved Purchase Orders (POs) 

 
27.8 Item 3.5 of GPPB Circular No. 01-2020 provides that “The contract shall include a 

warranty clause where the supplier, distributor, manufacturer, or contractor warrants 
that, for the period stipulated covering the procurement at hand, the Goods or 
Infrastructure Projects to be delivered or implemented shall be free from defects and 
conform to quality standards and technical specifications of the said contract. The 
contract awardee shall fulfill all the obligations and undertakings under the contract 
and the OSS.” 

 
27.9 Meanwhile, for the DOTR-MRT3, our review disclosed that the POs and related 

supporting documents did not include warranty clause for the procured supplies as 
required in the above-mentioned guidelines. Thus, assurance against manufacturing 
defects and non-conformance to quality standards and technical specifications of the 
said POs are lacking, hence, to the disadvantage of the agency. 

 
27.10 We recommended that Management of the DOTr-OSEC require the Chief 

Accountant to withhold applicable taxes on the payments of COVID-19 Hazard 
Pay pursuant to existing BIR Revenue Regulation. 



265  

27.11 Likewise, we recommended that DOTr-MRT 3 Management comply henceforth 
with the guidelines set forth under GPPB Circular No. 01-2020 and NPM No. 003- 
2020. 

 
Management Comments: 

 
27.12 The Management of the DOTr-OSEC commented that the withholding of applicable 

taxes will be implemented and effected on the CY 2021 income of the concerned 
personnel. Meanwhile, the Management of DOTr-MRT3 agreed to comply with the 
guidelines set forth under GPPB Circular No. 01-2020 and NPM No. 003-2020. 

 
 

Audit of Other Funds 
 

28. For CY 2020, DOTr did not receive funds for: (a) Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation 
(APEC) Fund, (b) Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Fund, (c) 
Marawi Rehabilitation Fund, (d) National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management 
(NDRRM) Fund, and (e) Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF) and 
Disbursement Acceleration Program (DAP) Fund.
