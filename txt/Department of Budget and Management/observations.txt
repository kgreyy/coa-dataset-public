OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

 
Financial Audit 

 
Accounting Errors 

 

1. Various accounting errors in the keeping of the accounts had resulted in misstatements 
totaling P132.704 million in some assets, liabilities and equity accounts.  

 

Section 15, Chapter 2, Volume I of Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for 

National Government Agencies (NGAs) states that the financial statements (FSs) shall 

present fairly the financial position, financial performance, and cash flows of an entity. Fair 

presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, 

and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, 

liabilities, revenue, and expenses. 

 

Analysis of the accounts and the related Journal Entry Vouchers (JEVs) and 

supporting documents revealed accounting errors arising from omissions, erroneous 

recognition and misclassifications in an aggregate amount of P132.704 million or 7.65 per 

cent of total expenditures, which resulted in the overstatement of assets and equity by 

P14.237 million and P19.801 million, respectively, with corresponding understatement of 

liabilities by P5.564 million, as shown in Table 1.

We recommended that Management and Functional Head of the Local

a) The CO and the Regional Office (RO) Accountants to make the necessary 
adjusting journal entries to correct the errors noted; 

 

b) Henceforth, observe the proper recognition of accounts and transactions in 
accordance with the GAM for NGAs and other existing accounting rules and 

regulations; and  

 

c) CO Accountant to monitor and ensure that the recommended adjustments at 
the ROs are complied with by the respective RO Accountants. 

 

 

Accounting Deficiencies 

 

2. The existence, completeness and accuracy of the balances of several assets and liabilities 
totaling P377.998 million could not be readily ascertained due to variances between 

books and related records and dormancy of some accounts, among others. 

     

Section 30, Chapter 2, Volume I, of GAM for NGAs provides that an entity shall 

present information including accounting policies in a manner that meets a number of 

qualitative characteristics such as understandability, relevance, materiality, reliability and 

comparability. These qualitative characteristics are the attributes that make the information 

provided in the FSs useful to users. 

 

Reconciliation is a process which ensures that two sets of records of a particular 

account are in agreement. As part of accounting controls, it facilitates a countercheck on the 

accuracy of accounting records and integrity of property custodianship. 

 

Comparison of accounting records and Report on the Physical Count of PPE 

(RPCPPE), RPCI and various NGAs’ book balances as at December 31, 2020, and analysis 

of the balances and variances revealed deficiencies totaling P378.035 million, as discussed 

and summarized in Table 2.

a. Unreconciled discrepancies between PPE balances per books and per RPCPPE – 
P1.008 million  

 

Comparison of the ROs IV-A and IV-B’s PPE balances per books against the 

RPCPPE as at December 31, 2020 disclosed a net unreconciled discrepancy of P1.008 

million. Details are shown in Table 3:

  Total P11,019,801.24 P10,011,765.16 P1,008,036.08 

 

The non-reconciliation of accounting records and RPCPPE was caused, among 

others, by the following: 

 

 Unrecognized PPE items in the books of accounts – P0.893 million; 

 Unreported PPE items in the RPCPPE – P1.837 million; 

 Items reported twice in the RPCPPE – P163,000.00; and 

 Misclassification of PPE items in the RPCPPE – P223,019.57. 
 

Efforts exerted by the Management to reconcile the accounting records and RPCPPE 

resulted in a significant decrease in the net discrepancy by P66.804 million, from P67.812 

million in CY 2019 to P1.008 million in CY 2020. 

 

The non-reconciliation of PPE balances in the books of the ROs IV-A and IV-B with 

that of the physical count affected the completeness and accuracy of the year-end account 

balances. 

  

We recommended and the Functional Head of the Local Government and 

Regional Operations Group agreed to require the Accountants and Property Officers 

in the ROs IV-A and IV-B to properly maintain, regularly update, and reconcile their 

respective records, and effect the necessary adjustments/corrections in their respective 

books/records, if warranted.

b. Unreconciled discrepancies between inventory accounts’ balances per books and per 
RPCI – P5.418 million  

 

Comparison of the CO, NCR, ROs IV-A and IX’s inventory account balances per 

books against the RPCI as at December 31, 2020 disclosed a net unreconciled discrepancy 

of P5.418 million. Details are shown in Table 4:

  Total P5,966,899.87 P548,625.92 P5,418,273.95 

 

The discrepancies between the accounting records and the RPCI were due to, among 

others, the following: 

 

 Unrecognized issuances of office supplies inventories in the books – P0.926 million; 

 Double recognition of the issuance of office supplies inventories in the books – 
P6,095.84;  

 Non-recognition of issuances to end-users of semi-expendable properties – P3.281 
million; 

 Presence of balances for Office Supplies Inventory, Other Supplies and Materials 
Inventory, Semi-Expendable Information and Communications Technology 

Equipment and Semi-Expendable Furniture and Fixtures in the books despite 

having zero quantity per RPCI and per books – P1.278 million; and 

 No regular reconciliation between balances per Stock Cards and per Supplies Ledger 
Cards   

 

Despite efforts exerted by the Management to reconcile the accounting records and 

RPCI, the net discrepancy even increased by P467,079.66, from P4.951 million in CY 2019 

to P5.418 million in CY 2020. 

  

The non-reconciliation of Inventory account balances in the books of the CO, NCR, 

ROs IV-A and IX with that of the physical count affected the completeness and accuracy of 

the year-end account balances. 

 



46 

 

We recommended and Management and the Functional Head of the Local 

Government and Regional Operations Group agreed to require the Accountants and 

Supply Officers in the CO, NCR, ROs IV-A and IX to properly maintain, regularly 

update, and reconcile their respective records, and effect necessary 

adjustments/corrections in their respective books/records, if warranted. 

 

c. Non-disposal of unserviceable PPE items and semi-expendable items aggregating 
P2.725 million 

 

Validation of actions taken by the Management on the previous year’s audit 

recommendation on non-disposal of unserviceable properties showed that unserviceable 

properties decreased from P3.951 million in CY 2019 to P2.725 million as at December 31, 

2020. Details are as follows:

Total P2,026,129.81 P166,395.50 P532,336.88 P2,724,862.19 

 

As emphasized in the previous years’ observations, the failure to dispose of the 

unserviceable properties at the earliest possible time has caused the assets to deteriorate 

further which then prevented the agency to benefit from the best possible mode of disposal 

of the assets. In addition, the properties unnecessarily occupied storage space for a 

considerable amount of time. 

 

We recommended that the Functional Head of the Local Government and 

Regional Operations Group require the Property Officers in the ROs VI, IX and XIII 

to cause the immediate disposal of all unserviceable properties. 

 

d. Unreconciled discrepancies between receivables’ balances per DBM books and per 
NGAs’ books – P130.148 million 

 

Comparison of the CO and RO I’s balances of Due from National Government 

Agencies with the Procurement Service (PS) and CO’s balance of Due from National 

Government Agencies with the Department of Information and Communications 

Technology-National Computer Center (DICT-NCC) as at December 31, 2020 disclosed a 

net discrepancy of P130.148 million, as shown in Table 6.

  Total P300,845,026.51 P170,697,165.19 P130,147,861.32 

 

The discrepancies between the book and confirmed balances could be attributed to, 

among others, the following: 

 

 Unrecognized purchase of software licenses from the PS in CY 2020 – P47.112 
million; 

 Unrecognized purchase of airline tickets from the PS in CYs 2019 and 2020 – 
P0.863 million; and 

 Incorrect amount of deliveries recognized in the books – P19,792.94 
 

Although the non-reconciliation of the DBM and NGAs’ records has been a recurring 

observation in the previous years, and recommendation to do reconciliation has been 

reiterated, the discrepancy between the DBM and PS’s books of accounts as at December 

31, 2020 of P130.109 million showed an increase by P49.625 million from last year’s 

discrepancy of P80.484 million. 

  

The non-reconciliation of the balances of Due from National Government Agencies 

of the DBM with those of the PS and DICT-NCC affected the completeness and accuracy of 

the year-end account balance. 

 

We recommended that Management and the Functional Head of the Local 

Government and Regional Operations Group require the Accountants in the CO and 

RO I to coordinate with the PS for the regular reconciliation of both records to ensure 

that all advances and deliveries are promptly and correctly recognized in the books. 

 

e. Long outstanding receivables totaling P237.520 million 
 

The aging analysis of the CO, NCR, and ROs VIII and X’s Due from National 

Government Agencies and Due from Officers and Employees showed that P237.520 million, 

or 78.10 per cent of the total carrying amount of P304.119 million, was outstanding for two 

years or more, as shown in Table 7.

Accumulation of outstanding fund transfers to the PS, COA, DICT-NCC and DPWH, 

and receivables from the CO officers and employees for two years or more was due to, 

among others, the following: 

 

 Delayed completion of the Budget and Treasury Management System (BTMS) 
Project – P154.481 million; 

 Unrefunded liquidated damages for the delayed accomplishment of the BTMS 
project deliverables – P55.866 million; 

 Undelivered goods by the PS for CY 2018 and prior years – P16.480 million; 

 Unrefunded residual balances from completed delivery of goods for CYs 2009 to 
2018 – P7.884 million; 

 Unliquidated fund transfer to COA for the project Improvement of Electronic New 
Government Accounting System-Unified Accounts Code Structure – P31,816.46; 

 Non-submission by the DICT-NCC of liquidation reports (LRs) and/or refund of 
any unexpended balance for the discontinuance of the project Creation of National 

Payroll System and Government Human Resource Information System as the 

systems were already integrated in the development of the BTMS – P2.198 million; 

 Non-submission by the DPWH of the LR for the completed construction of septic 
tank and renovation of comfort rooms – P360,000.00; and 

 Uncollected overpayments of salaries and allowances, and deficiencies in 
mandatory deductions of nine active officers/employees of P64,996.65 and 19 

separated officers/employees of P153,794.77, or a total of P218,791.42. 

 

Despite repeated requests by the DBM CO from the DICT-NCC for the submission 

of LRs to reconcile and settle the account, Management did not receive any response from 

the DICT-NCC regarding the matter. The last liquidation was recognized in the books on 

December 31, 2013, making the balance of P2.198 million outstanding for seven years as at 

year-end. Because of the age and uncertainty of collectability of the receivable, it may be 

assessed for impairment in accordance with Section 10, Chapter 7, Volume I of GAM for 

NGAs. 

 

The presence of the long outstanding balance of Due from National Government 

Agencies and Due from Officers and Employees, which had therefore been unremitted to the 

Bureau of the Treasury, had not made available additional funds for the National 

Government (NG)’s operations. On the other hand, the longer the receivables from former 



49 

 

officers and employees remain outstanding in the books of accounts, the lesser are the 

chances of their collection.  

 

We recommended that Management require the CO Accountant to: 

 

a) (i) demand from the PS the refund of the amounts pertaining to residual 
balances of completed deliveries of goods in the previous years of P7.884 million 

and liquidated damages of P55.866 million; (ii) require the DICT-NCC to 

submit the reports of liquidation/disbursements for the amount expended 

and/or to refund any balance; and (iii) demand from the COA the liquidation 

of the remaining balance of the fund transfer of P31,816.46;  

 

b) (i) deduct the amounts of long outstanding receivables of P64,996.65 from the 
succeeding salaries of active officers/employees; (ii) send demand letters to 

former officers/employees for the immediate settlement of their accounts of 

P153,794.77; (iii) if no responses are received, oblige the signatory who cleared 

the former officers/employees of financial accountabilities to assume the 

separated officers/employees’ liabilities; and (iv) verify the unsettled financial 

liabilities of officers/employees who will be separated from service prior to the 

approval of their clearances; and 

 

c) assess whether there is any objective evidence that the receivables from the 
DICT-NCC and from former CO officers/employees are impaired and 

recognize the corresponding impairment loss in the books of accounts.  

 

We also recommended that the Functional Head of the Local Government and 

Regional Operations Group direct the: 

 

a) NCR and RO VIII Accountants to demand from the PS the refund of the 
advances pertaining to undelivered goods for CY 2018 and prior years of 

P403,240.11 and P1.077 million, respectively, and immediately remit collections 

to the BTr; and 

 

b) RO X Accountant to require the DPWH RO X to submit the report of 
liquidation/disbursements for the completed project. 

 

f. Non-reversion of dormant payables totaling P1.217 million 
 

Analysis of the liability accounts of the CO and RO IX revealed that as at December 

31, 2020, a total of P1.217 million remained dormant for two to six years, as shown in Table 

8.

In the CO, the dormant payables of P1.195 million include payables that remained 

outstanding because of the cancellation of stale checks that were issued in prior years and a 

balance that existed since the conversion of accounts under the electronic-New Government 

Accounting System on July 31, 2014. 

 

In the RO IX, the security deposit payable pertains to the performance bond received 

from the supplier of the janitorial services in CY 2017, which remained unclaimed despite 

the termination of the contract in November 2018. 

 

Considering the lack of interest on the part of the creditors to claim the amounts due 

them, it would be appropriate to revert the said outstanding liabilities to the Accumulated 

Surplus or Deficit of the General Fund. The non-reversion of the dormant payables, which 

had remained outstanding for two to six years, affected the existence and accuracy of the 

accounts’ balances as at year-end. 

 

We recommended that Management and the Functional Head of the Local 

Government and Regional Operations Group require the Accountants in the CO and 

RO IX to revert all dormant payables to the General Fund of the National Government. 

 

 

Compliance Issues 

 

Error in FAR No. 1-SAAODB 

 

3. Unreported unreleased appropriations of P132.205 million in FAR No. 1-SAAODB for 
the fiscal year ending December 31, 2020 may affect the issuance of allotments to the 

DBM for CY 2021, considering that the validity for release and disbursement of 

appropriations under the General Appropriations Act for FY 2020 is extended until 

December 31, 2021, pursuant to RA No. 11520 dated December 29, 2020. 

 

An agency’s budget accountability is examined and evaluated through the 

preparation and submission of Budget and Financial Accountability Reports (BFARs), in 

consonance with the COA-DBM Joint Circular (JC) No. 2013-1 dated March 15, 2013, as 

amended by COA-DBM JC No. 2014-1 dated July 2, 2014. The BFAR formats and contents 

were restructured, through the issuance of COA-DBM JC No. 2019-1 dated January 1, 2019, 

to conform to the Program Expenditure Classification (PREXC)-fied Budget Structure, to 

provide more details for clarity and to ensure consistency in information being reported. 

 

Among the BFARs required to be prepared is the Financial Accountability Report 

(FAR) No. 1-Statement of Appropriations, Allotments, Obligations, Disbursements and 



51 

 

Balances (SAAODB) which shall reflect the agency’s authorized appropriations and 

adjustments, total allotments received including transfers, total obligations, total 

disbursements and balances. Columns 21 to 24 of the report show the unreleased 

appropriations, unobligated allotments, unpaid obligations that are due and demandable, and 

unpaid obligations that are not yet due and demandable, respectively, as of the reporting 

period. 

 

Review of the DBM’s Consolidated FAR No. 1-SAAODB for fiscal year (FY) 

ending December 31, 2020 disclosed that unreleased appropriations totaling P132.205 

million were not reflected in the report. Unreleased Appropriations (Column 21) of the 

report, which should have shown the difference between   the Adjusted Appropriations 

(Column 5) and Adjusted Total Allotments (Column 10), showed zero balance as at year-

end. Table 9 shows the details of the unreleased appropriations.

The error may affect the issuance of allotments to the DBM for CY 2021, considering 

that the validity for release and disbursement of appropriations under the General 

Appropriations Act (GAA) for FY 2020 is extended until December 31, 2021, pursuant to 

RA No. 11520 dated December 29, 2020. Moreover, it affected the accuracy of information 

submitted to the DBM and the COA which these oversight agencies use in reporting, 

monitoring and/or evaluating the agency’s performance necessary for making sound policy 

decisions. 

 

We recommended that Management advise the CO Accountant and the Budget 

Officer to revise the FAR No. 1-SAAODB to include the unreleased appropriations and 

submit the revised report to the DBM and the COA.  

 

 

Partial compliance with Modified Direct Payment Scheme (MDPS)  

 

4. Payments totaling P7.349 million were made to various creditors/payees through the 
issuance of MDPS checks, instead of using the LDDAP-ADA under the MDPS, thus, 

hindering the attainment of a more transparent and efficient payment scheme.  

 

Section 3.1 of DBM Circular Letter No. 2018-14 dated December 28, 2018 requires 

all NGAs to use the existing List of Due and Demandable Accounts Payables-Advice to 



52 

 

Debit Account (LDDAP-ADA) and Summary of LDDAP-ADAs Issued and Invalidated 

ADA Entries to settle all accounts payables to creditors/payees including utility companies 

and social insurance corporations. 

 

However, Section 3.4 of the same Circular Letter allows the NGAs to continue 

paying through the issuance of MDS checks or cash the creditors/suppliers enumerated 

therein who cannot be conveniently nor practicably be paid using the ADA. 

 

Review of disbursements for CY 2020 disclosed that the DBM has not fully adopted 

the MDPS as payments totaling P7.349 million were still made by the RO XII to 

creditors/payees who do not fall under any of the exemptions enumerated under Section 3.4 

of the Circular Letter.  

 

The RO sent letters to its creditors advising them to open an account with the 

Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) to no avail as most of the creditors already have 

existing accounts with the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) and some are unwilling to 

open an additional account with the DBP. Since the RO transferred its account from the DBP 

to the LBP effective July 1, 2020, creditors have been asked verbally for their account 

information in order to make the payment through LDDAP-ADA instead of MDS checks. 

 

As a result of the agency’s partial compliance with the implementation of the MDPS, 

the objective of a more transparent and efficient payment scheme to minimize the volume of 

outstanding checks and address cash programming concerns, by providing specific schedule 

of payments, was not fully attained. 

 

We recommended that Management ensure the full implementation of the 

MDPS on the settlement of accounts to all internal and external creditors and payees.  
 

 

RATA paid in advance 

 

5. RATA of OICs for CY 2020 totaling P0.544 million were paid in advance instead of on 
reimbursable basis, thereby exposing the agency to the risk of overpayment of RATA 

to officials/employees. 
 

Item No. 8.1.1 of DBM National Budget Circular (NBC) No. 548 dated May 15, 

2013 provides that an Officer-in-Charge (OIC) of a position, authorized in an agency staffing 

pattern and entitled to Representation Allowance and Transportation Allowance (RATA), 

may be allowed to collect the RATA for the position on reimbursable basis, if stipulated in 

the office order designating him/her as such. In addition, Item No. 6.1 of the same NBC 

provides that the grant of RATA shall be based on the number of days of actual work 

performance on workdays by the officials/employees concerned. 
 

Item No. 5.2 of the Revised Documentary Requirements for Common Government 

Transactions, as prescribed under COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012, 

enumerates the documents needed to support the payment of RATA. 

 



53 

 

Review of disbursements revealed that RATA for OICs of positions entitled to 

RATA for CY 2020 totaling P0.544 million were paid at the beginning of the month instead 

of the month after services were rendered in the NCR and in ROs IV-A and VI, as shown in

In the NCR and RO VI, no Daily Time Records (DTRs) and Certification that the 

official/employee did not use government vehicle and is not assigned any government 

vehicle were attached to the Disbursement Vouchers (DV)/payrolls for all payments as these 

have not yet been prepared at the date of payment.  

 

In the RO IV-A, supporting documents, such as Certificate of Service rendered for 

the month and Certification that the official/employee did not use government vehicle and is 

not assigned any government vehicle, were prepared prior to the rendition of services for a 

given month. In addition, no DTRs were attached to the DVs for the payments of 

reimbursable RATA. 

 

In both the NCR and RO IV-A, the Audit Team verified the DTRs and Records of 

Leave of Absences of the recipients of RATA for the period of claim and ascertained that  

all personnel concerned had rendered 17 days or more of actual work each month, thus the 

entitlement to 100 per cent of the monthly RATA. These, however, did not cure the non-

compliance with Item 6.1 of the NBC. 

 

The practice of paying RATA before personnel services are rendered may result in 

the overpayment of RATA to OICs who performed 16 days or less of actual work in a month. 

 

We recommended that the Functional Head of the Local Government and 

Regional Operations Group require the Accountants in the NCR and ROs IV-A and 

VI to: (a) pay the RATA only after actual services are rendered and required 

documents are submitted by the officials/employees; and (b) submit the required 

documents to support the payments of RATA for CY 2020.  

 

 

Non-compliance with posting requirements of RA No. 9184 

 

6. For CY 2020, 311 procurement documents were posted in the DBM website and the 
PhilGEPS one to 389 days beyond the prescribed period while 73 were not posted at all 

in the PhilGEPS, thus affecting the achievement of transparency in the procurement 

process of the DBM. 



54 

 

Section 3 of the Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA No. 9184 

enumerates transparency as among the five governing principles on government 

procurement.  
 

Posting of procurement documents in the Philippine Government Electronic 

Procurement System (PhilGEPS), procuring entity’s website, and in conspicuous places in 

the premises of the procuring entity for such length of time as may be necessary under the 

circumstances ensures the widest possible dissemination thereof, thereby promoting 

transparency in the procurement process. 
 

Evaluation of the DBM’s compliance with the posting requirements of RA No. 9184 

for CY 2020 disclosed delayed posting or non-posting of several procurement documents, 

as summarized in Table 11.

procurement documents were not posted at all

Three  Requests for Quotation, one  NOA, one  

PO and one  NTP for the purchase of 20 units 

of Uninterruptible Power Supply amounting 

to P70,000.00 were not posted in the 

PhilGEPS. 

 

Despite inclusion of the same observation in the consolidated audit report for CY 

2019 to address the issue, the number of procurement documents that were posted beyond 

the prescribed period increased from 157 to 311 while the maximum number of days of delay 

increased from 353 to 389. In addition, unposted procurement documents increased from 27 

to 73. 

 

In both CO and RO III, the adoption of alternative work arrangements during the 

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, led to a limited workforce that eventually 

caused the delayed posting of procurement documents.  

 

The delayed posting of procurement documents in both the DBM and PhilGEPS 

websites, as well as the non-posting in the latter, affected the transparency of the 

procurement process of the DBM.  



55 

 

We recommended that Management and the Functional Head of the Local 

Government and Regional Operations Group require the Bids and Awards 

Committee Secretariats in the CO and RO III, respectively, to devise ways to strictly 

observe the timely compliance with the posting requirements of procurement 

documents.   

 

 

Weaknesses in internal control 

 

7. Deficiencies in several JEVs, DVs, Payrolls, LRs, PCVs, ORS, LDDAP-ADA and POs 
totaling P89.013 million had not established the validity and authorization of 

transactions paid for and recognized in the books, and the use of funds for the intended 

purposes, among others. 
  

Section 123, Chapter 4, Title III of PD No. 1445 defines internal control as “the plan 

of organization and all the coordinate methods and measures adopted within an organization 

or agency to safeguard its assets, check the accuracy and reliability of its accounting data, 

and encourage adherence to prescribed managerial policies.” 

 

The responsibility lies with the Management to maintain a system of accounting and 

reporting which provides for the necessary internal controls to ensure that transactions are 

properly authorized and recognized in the books and assets are safeguarded against 

unauthorized use or disposition. 

 

Item No. 5 of the Revised Documentary Requirements for Common Government 

Transactions as prescribed under COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012, requires 

the following for all types of disbursement: 1) Cash is available for its payment; 2) 

Transaction is lawful; 3) Expenditure is approved by the Head of Office or his authorized 

representative; and 4) Payment is supported with sufficient and relevant documents to 

establish validity of claim. Properly accomplished DVs and Obligation Requests and Status 

(ORS) which invariably bear the certification and approval of responsible officials will help 

ensure compliance with the requirements of this COA Circular. 

 

In the CO and in the ROs III, IV-A, VI, VII, IX and XI, examination of JEVs, DVs, 

Payrolls, LRs, petty cash vouchers (PCVs), ORS, LDDAP-ADA and purchase orders (POs) 

for CY 2020 amounting to P89.013 million revealed  that the same were either incompletely 

and  improperly supported, not duly authorized and/or improperly accomplished as

Total  P89,012,959.14   

 

In the CO and in the ROs IV-A and IX, the validity of the transactions recognized in 

the books was not established because of the JEVs without proper supporting documents.   

 

In the CO and in the ROs III, IV-A, VI, VII and XI, the validity and propriety of the 

payments were not established because of the insufficient and improper documents that 

supported the DVs, Payrolls, LRs and PCVs. In addition, the lack of supporting documents 

in the LRs of the CO precluded the determination of whether the funds were spent for the 

specific purposes for which the cash advances were granted.  

 

Moreover, the following deficiencies in the evidences of receipts of payments 

attached to DVs posed a challenge in ascertaining whether the CO is transacting with 

suppliers that are compliant with the BIR rules and regulations on the issuance of official 

receipts (ORs)/sales invoices and the remittance of proper taxes: 1) attached charge sales 

invoices were without corresponding collection receipts; and 2) for DVs without  attached 

ORs/sales invoices/secondary receipts, attached LDDAP-ADA were not bank-validated. 

 

In the ROs IV-A and VII, the lack of signatures by the Head of the Requesting Office, 

Chief Accountant, Regional Director and Claimant/Payee in the DVs, LDDAP-ADA and 

ORS suggested that the following were not certified: 1) necessity and legality of 

expenditures; 2) availability of cash; 3) completeness, validity, propriety and legality of 

supporting documents; and 4) correctness of amounts claimed. Likewise, payments were not 

duly authorized and acknowledged. 



58 

 

In the ROs VI and VII, the absence of supplier’s signature and date of signing in the 

Conforme portion of the POs had not enabled the determination of the delivery period and 

will not facilitate the computation of liquidated damages in case of delayed delivery. 

 

 We recommended that Management and the Functional Head of the Local 

Government and Regional Operations Group require the: 

 

a) Accountants in the CO and in the ROs IV-A and IX to submit all the necessary 
documents to support the JEVs; 

 

b) Accountants in the CO and in the ROs III, IV-A, VI, VII and XI to: (i) submit 
the lacking documents to establish validity of claims in CY 2020; and (ii) ensure 

that future disbursements are sufficiently and properly documented in 

accordance with the Revised Documentary Requirements for Common 

Government Transactions; 

 

c) Cashier in the CO to: (i) require all concerned suppliers to submit ORs for 
payments made to them in CY 2020 and attach the submitted ORs to the DVs; 

(ii) attach the bank-validated LDDAP-ADA to the DVs without ORs in case of 

non-compliance by suppliers after notification on the requirement for the 

submission of the ORs; and, (iii) furnish the Audit Team with a copy of the 

submitted list of non-compliant suppliers to the BIR; 

 

d) Disbursing Officers in the ROs IV-A and VII to ensure that all DVs, LDDAP-
ADA and ORS bear the signatures of authorized officials/signatories; and 

 

e) Property/Supply Officers in the ROs VI and VII to ensure that all future POs 
are acknowledged by the suppliers and include their date of signing in the 

Conforme portion of the PO. 
 

 

Delayed/Non-submission of FSs, DVs, BRSs, Contracts/POs and RPCIs 

 

8. Submission of FSs, DVs, BRSs and supporting documents, perfected contracts and POs, 
and RPCIs within one to 238 days beyond the prescribed period or non-submission at 

all affected the audit disposition on the subject transactions.   
  

One of the qualitative characteristics of financial reporting as enumerated in IPSAS 

1 is timeliness. Timeliness affects the usefulness of financial statements, reports and 

information for decision-making needs of users. It is therefore of vital importance that 

financial statements, reports and information are submitted to the auditors on time so that 

prompt review thereof could be made to detect errors and recommend corrections. 

 

Pertinent provisions of COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009 require 

the prompt submission of contracts and POs to the Audit Team for the timely and complete 

auditorial review thereof. Checklists of documentary requirements that shall support the 

copies of contracts, POs, and the like are, likewise, provided for submission to the Audit 



59 

 

Team. Additionally, Appendix A, Annex H of the 2016 Revised IRR of RA No. 9184 

enumerates the documentary requirements for alternative methods of procurement which 

shall, likewise, form part of the contracts. 

 

Evaluation of the DBM’s compliance with the above provisions revealed that in the 

CO, and the ROs II, III, IV-A, V, VI and XIII, there had been delays in the submission of 

the FSs, DVs, Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRSs) and supporting documents, perfected 

contracts and POs, and RPCIs, as shown in Table 13.

Despite the inclusion of these observations in the AAR for CY 2019 and the efforts 

exerted by the concerned personnel to comply with the requirements, the delayed submission 

and/or non-submission of reports, contracts and POs still exist. The range of delays, which 

was mostly attributed to the adoption of alternative working arrangements during the 

COVID-19 pandemic and the delays by government servicing banks in their submission of 

bank statements to the ROs, resulted to the further increase in delays from two to 153 days 

in CY 2019 to one to 238 days in CY 2020, thereby affecting the delivery of the mandated 

audit services.  

 



60 

 

 We recommended that Management and the Functional Head of the Local 

Government and Regional Operations Group require the Accountants in ROs IV-A 

and XIII, Inventory Committees in CO and RO VI, and concerned Bids and Awards 

Committee Secretariats/Procurement officials in CO and ROs II, III, V and XIII to 

strictly comply with the timely submission of the reports, contracts and POs. 

 

 

Compliance with Other Mandatory Accounts/Areas 

 

9. COVID-19-Pandemic Response and Recovery Interventions 
 

For CY 2020, the DBM-CO and its ROs did not receive funds specifically for 

COVID-19 response and/or recovery but had utilized its budget for related expenses. 

 

COVID-19-related expenses charged to PS and MOOE totaled P5.524 million and 

P6.087 million, respectively. Breakdown is as follows:

Total P5,524,387.50 P6,087,478.69 P11,611,866.19 

 

The results of audit of these COVID-related transactions are as follows: 

 

On the grant of hazard pay to employees during the Enhanced Community Quarantine 

(ECQ)/Modified ECQ (MECQ) 

 

Section 1 of the Office of the President Administrative Order (AO) No. 26 dated 

March 23, 2020 authorized the NGAs to grant COVID-19 hazard pay to personnel who 

physically report for work during the implementation of the ECQ in their respective work 

stations, in an amount not exceeding P500.00 per day per person. 

 

Section 2 of the same AO provides the conditions on the grant of the COVID-19 

hazard pay and that the heads of government agencies may grant the COVID-19 hazard pay 

to their personnel/workers without the need for further approval by the DBM, subject to the 

following guidelines and conditions:  

 

1. The personnel are occupying regular, contractual or casual positions, or are workers 
engaged through COS, Job Order (JO), or other similar schemes. 

 

2. The personnel/workers have been authorized to physically report for work at their 
respective offices or work stations on the prescribed official working hours by the 



61 

 

head of agency/office during the period of implementation of ECQ measures in the 

area of such office or work station. 

 

3. The total rate of the COVID-19 hazard pay shall be based on the number of days an 
employee/worker physically reports for work during the ECQ period using the 

formula under Section 1, which is P500.00 x No. of days physically reporting for 

work during the quarantine period. 

 

Review of disbursements for CY 2020 disclosed that the CO and ROs granted 

COVID-19 hazard pay totaling P5.571 million, P5.524 million of which were granted to 

regular officers and employees while P46,500.00 were granted to COS workers and JO 

personnel who reported for work during the ECQ and Modified ECQ.  

 

In the CO, review of transactions recognized under Hazard Pay totaling P2.629 

million as at December 31, 2020 disclosed that payments totaling P160,250.00 lacked 

necessary documents to prove the validity of the payments made. The following documents 

were not attached to the DVs: (i) certified true copies of Alternative Workforce Arrangement 

Order, indicating that the employees claiming COVID-19 hazard pay were under Skeletal 

Workforce Arrangement; and (ii) DTRs/Blotter for periods covered by the ECQ and MECQ. 

 

Aside from the regular officers and employees who reported for work in the DBM 

and its ROs during the ECQ and MECQ, six COS workers in the CO and one on-call driver 

in the RO V also reported for work during the same period, hence also received hazard pay 

amounting to P32,500.00 and P14,000.00, respectively. 

 

On the provision of supplies and materials for workplace protocols 

 

Paragraph B, Section VI of AO No. 2020-0015 of the Department of Health (DOH) 

on Risk-based Public Health Standards Across Settings provides that at the minimum, all 

actors shall implement the prescribed interventions in various settings as presented under 

Annex A-Required Public Health Standards Across All Settings as of April 27, 2020, 

depending on their Risk Severity Grading. For each prescribed intervention, concrete 

examples of corresponding hazard controls (e.g., engineering controls, administrative 

controls and personal protective equipment) are provided. Column D of Annex A listed the 

engineering and administrative controls for offices/workplaces which include, among others, 

the provision of tissues and placement of handwashing facilities, hand sanitizers and 

dispensers with alcohol-based solution in all entrances, exits and areas with high foot traffic 

and facilities.  

 

Paragraph B, Section VII of the same AO provides that national government agencies 

shall develop and submit their sector-specific plans and guidelines on the operationalization 

of the risk-based public health standards to the DOH. 

 

The DBM issued DO Nos. 5, s. 2020 and 12, s. 2020 dated March 17, 2020 and May 

18, 2020, respectively, on the alternative work arrangement in the DBM during the period 



62 

 

of the state of national emergency due to COVID-19 pandemic. The said DOs provide 

specific guidelines in consonance with the aforesaid provisions of the DOH AO.  

 

The DBM and its ROs incurred a total of P5.057 million as at December 31, 2020 

for the purchase of various COVID-19 response items which included disinfectant/sanitation 

items, face masks and face shields, on top of the regular supplies given, such as tissues and 

alcohol. The DBM also purchased thermal gun scanners, sneeze guards/table shields for 

barrier between cubicles, air purifiers and sterilization boxes.  

 

Likewise, office buildings in the CO, and in the ROs IV-A, VI, X and XII were 

disinfected while sneeze guards, hand wash sinks, waiting tents and full body sanitizing 

cabins were installed in the ROs III, IX, X and XII. Also, COVID-19 related signages were 

printed, laminated and installed. Expenses incurred for these totaled P391,762.00. 

 

On the provision of transportation facilities to employees on skeleton workforce 

 

Item C, Section 4.0 of CSC Memorandum Circular (MC) No. 18, s. 2020 states that 

reasonable transportation facilities and housing quarters shall be provided to employees 

assigned as skeleton workforce, whenever practicable, and subject to budgeting, accounting 

and auditing rules and regulations. 

 

In the RO VI, gasoline expenses totaling P24,855.41 were incurred for the provision 

of shuttle services to employees.  

 

On the publication of DBM issuances 

 

Examination of transactions recognized under Advertising, Promotional and 

Marketing Expenses disclosed that a total of P0.568 million was incurred by the agency for 

publication of various budget circulars and joint circulars prescribing the guidelines on the 

utilization of budget for COVID-19-related expenses.  

 

Publication costs were duly supported with purchase requests, requests for quotation, 

abstracts of quotation, advertising invoices, advertising contracts and physical copies of the 

newspaper publication. 

 

Releases for the COVID-19-Pandemic Response and Recovery Interventions 

 

On March 16, 2020, a State of Calamity due to COVID-19 was declared throughout 

the Philippines through the issuance of Presidential Proclamation No. 929, s. 2020. 

Consequently, RA Nos. 11469, or the Bayanihan to Heal As One Act (Bayanihan 1), and 

11494, or the Bayanihan to Recover As One Act (Bayanihan 2), were signed by the President 

on March 24, 2020 and September 11, 2020, respectively. The pair of legislation authorized 

the President to exercise powers that are necessary and proper to undertake the 

implementation of response and recovery interventions. Both RAs were designed to prop up 

the healthcare system, provide cash subsidy to low-income households, extend credit to 

small businesses and hard-hit sectors, among others. 



63 

 

 

After the expiration of RA No. 11469, which mandated the discontinuance of 

appropriated programs, projects or activities under the FYs 2019 and 2020 GAA of any 

agency under the Executive Department, releases of funds for the NG’s expenses were 

continued. Hence, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Fund (NDRRMF), 

Miscellaneous Personnel Benefits Fund (MPBF), and Unprogrammed funds have been used 

as additional funding sources for the COVID-19 emergency response in accordance with the 

relevant provisions of the NDRRMF, MPBF and Unprogrammed Appropriations under the 

FYs 2019 and 2020 GAA.  

 

Based on the data in the e-Budget System as at December 31, 2020, Special 

Allotment Release Orders (SAROs) totaling P506.146 billion were issued by the DBM to 

various government agencies to fund measures that address and respond to the COVID-19 

emergency. Confirmation of the total releases was sought from the Management but no reply 

yet was received. The funds were sourced from the reprogrammed, reallocated and realigned 

current and continuing appropriations in the FY 2020 and 2019 GAAs. Details are shown in 

Table 15.

10. National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (NTF-ELCAC)  
 

Section 1 of EO No. 70 dated December 4, 2018 institutionalized the Whole-of-

Nation Approach as a government policy for the attainment of inclusive and sustainable 

peace. To achieve this, the Government shall prioritize and harmonize the delivery of basic 

services and social development packages in conflict-affected areas and vulnerable 

communities, facilitate societal inclusivity, and ensure active participation of all sectors of 

society in the pursuit of the country’s peace agenda. 

 

Sections 2 and 3 of the same EO provides for the creation and composition of a NTF-

ELCAC under the Office of the President to ensure efficient and effective implementation 

of the Whole-of-Nation Approach. Among the powers and functions of the NTF-ELCAC is 

the formulation and implementation of a Whole-of-Nation Approach-driven National Peace 

Framework, which shall contain, as stated in Section 5 of the same EO, principles, policies, 

plans and programs that will bring inclusive and sustainable peace, and address the root 



64 

 

causes of insurgencies, internal disturbances and tensions as well as other armed conflicts 

and threats in identified areas. 

 

 Section 7 of EO No. 70 provides that the funding requirement for the implementation 

of the programs, plans and activities in the National Peace Framework shall be included in 

the respective annual budgets of the concerned agencies. For CY 2020, the DBM released a 

total of P1.996 billion to government agencies, P1.148 billion of which was released through 

the GAA as Allotment Order (GAAAO) while P848.405 million was released through 

SAROs. Details are shown in Table 16.

11. Marawi Recovery, Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Program 
 

Section 1 of AO No. 03 dated June 28, 2017 provides for the creation and 

composition of an Inter-Agency Task Force for the Recovery, Reconstruction, and 

Rehabilitation of Marawi City, or the Task Force Bangon Marawi, to be headed by the 

Secretary of National Defense. 

 

As enumerated in Sections 2 and 3 of the AO, the Task Force Bangon Marawi and 

its sub-committees shall be responsible for the following: (a) immediate repair, rehabilitation 

and reconstruction of public schools, national roads and bridges, and government buildings; 

(b) immediate rehabilitation and construction of temporary or permanent shelters, and the 

restoration of water, electricity, and other public utilities therein; (c) provision of sanitation 

and health facilities, medical supplies, food, potable water, and other basic necessities; (d) 

implementation of an active campaign for the immediate revival of businesses and livelihood 

projects in the city; and (e) restoration and maintenance of peace and order, and the 

continuity of public services in the city. 

 



65 

 

Section 5 of the AO states that the resources needed for its implementation shall be 

sourced from available funds of the member agencies of the Task Force and such other 

appropriate funding sources as the DBM may identify, including the National Disaster Risk 

Reduction Management Fund, subject to existing budgeting, accounting and auditing laws, 

rules and regulations. For CY 2020, the DBM released a total of P7.356 billion to 

implementing agencies, broken down as follows:

Gender and Development (GAD) 

 

12. Implementation of only five of eight planned GAD activities in CY 2020 and the non-
submission of the final consolidated GAD AR for CY 2020 and its complete supporting 

documents resulted in the partial achievement of the intended benefits of the GAD Plan 

and the non-validation of accomplishments and related costs by the Audit Team, 

respectively.  
 

Section 31 of the General Provisions of the GAA for FY 2020 provides that all 

agencies of the government shall formulate a GAD Plan designed to address gender issues 

within their concerned sectors or mandate and implement the applicable provisions under 

RA No. 9710 or the Magna Carta of Women, Convention on the Elimination of All Forms 

of Discrimination Against Women, the Beijing Platform for Action, the Philippine Plan for 

Gender-Responsive Development (1995-2025) and the Philippine Development Plan (2017-

2020).  

 

Item No. 5.3 of Philippine Commission on Women (PCW) MC No. 2021-01 dated 

January 20, 2021 enumerates the supporting documents to be attached to the agency’s GAD 

Accomplishment Report (AR) submission. Further, Item No. 7.0 of PCW MC No. 2021-03 

dated March 15, 2021 requires agencies to print the final GAD AR with the PCW’s remarks 

and observations for signature, and submit signed copies to the PCW and their respective 

COA Audit Team. 

 

Evaluation of the DBM’s compliance with the abovementioned MCs revealed that 

the submitted copy of the consolidated GAD AR to the Audit Team was not the final GAD 

AR with PCW’s remarks and observations. Also, the supporting documents attached to the 

GAD AR were incomplete despite the ample time provided to the agency for the submission 

of documents. These affected the Audit Team’s validation of the accomplishments and the 

corresponding costs incurred, particularly the attribution of cost of P166.827 million or 97.74 

per cent of the total GAD expenditures for CY 2020 using the Harmonized Gender and 

Development Guidelines tool. 

 

Based on the submitted documents, the DBM utilized a total of P170.688 million 

which is equivalent to 92.48 per cent of the total GAD Budget of P184.570 million and 8.34 

per cent of the total appropriations of P2.046 billion.  

 

Based on the consolidated GAD AR submitted, four of eight activities were not 

implemented by the CO while three of eight activities were not implemented by the ROs 

because of the declaration of public health emergency, which prevented mass gatherings and 

face-to-face interactions. The activities not accomplished, such as hosting a GAD 

forum/seminar and carrying out GAD deepening sessions for the GAD Focal Point System 

(GFPS), Technical Working Group and GAD Champions could be conducted online. 

Further, the establishment and maintenance of the GAD database/sex-disaggregated data, 

and issuance of a policy on the use of gender fair language do not necessitate face-to-face 

interactions; therefore, accomplishment of these activities should not have been affected by 

the COVID-19 pandemic.  



67 

 

We recommended that Management advise the Chairperson, GFPS to (a) 

submit to the Audit Team a copy of the final PCW-reviewed GAD AR and its 

supporting documents to facilitate further verification; and (b) make sure that planned 

GAD activities are implemented to ensure that the gender issues identified are 

addressed. 

 

 

13. Senior Citizens (SCs) and Persons with Disability (PWD), and Youth 
 

Section 32 of the General Provisions of the GAA for FY 2020 requires all agencies 

of the government to formulate plans, programs and projects intended to address the 

concerns of SCs and PWDs, insofar as it relates to their mandated functions, and integrate 

the same in their regular activities. 

 

Section 33 also requires all agencies of the government to provide allocations for 

youth development projects and activities within the framework of the Philippine 

Development Plan (2017-2022). 

 

The DBM and its ROs, except for the ROs I, VI and VIII, were able to formulate 

plans, programs and projects intended to address the concerns of SCs and PWDs, insofar as 

it relates to their mandated functions, and integrate the same in the regular activities of the 

agency. Activities include, among others, the following: (i) giving utmost priority in the use 

of facilities and in the receipt and processing of budget and accounting-related transactions; 

(ii) actively advocating the programs of the SCs and PWDs during budget forum to increase 

awareness in client-agencies and to ensure that their concerns are considered in the budgets 

of both LGUs and state universities and colleges; and (iii) conducting and participating in 

various committee hearings/meetings on SCs and PWD-related topics. In addition, the ROs 

V, VII, IX and XI were able to provide structural facilities that enhanced the mobility, safety, 

and welfare of SCs and differently-abled persons. On the other hand, no observations were 

reported in the MLs of the ROs X and XII. 

 

In compliance with Section 33 of the General Provisions of the GAA for FY 2020, 

the DBM-CO, NCR, and ROs IV-A and V accommodated student interns from January to 

March 2020 before the declaration of public health emergency due to the COVID-19 

pandemic. In addition, CAR conducted a donation drive for orphans housed at the DSWD 

Children’s Facility while RO V participated in the Brigada Eskwela Project of the DepEd 

where supplies and personal protective equipment were donated to seven schools in the 

Province of Albay. However, no youth-related activities were conducted in the ROs I, III, 

VI, VIII and XIII, while no observations were reported in the MLs of the ROs II, IV-B, VII, 

IX, X, XI and XII.

14. Tax Laws and Regulations, GSIS and Pag-IBIG Premium Contributions and Loan 
Amortizations, and PhilHealth Premium Contributions 

 

For CY 2020, the DBM and its ROs, except for NCR and RO XII, had faithfully 

deducted from the salaries of personnel the required taxes, premiums, contributions on 

personal share for Pag-IBIG and PhilHealth and social insurance contributions; withheld 

taxes from contractors and creditable value-added taxes from suppliers/dealers, and remitted 

the same, as well as, the government share within the prescribed period, to the respective 

institutions or agencies. The summary is shown in Table 18.

Of the year-end balance of Due to BIR of P5.948 million, balances of the ROs 

totaling P2.941 million were remitted on time while taxes withheld by the CO of P3.007 

million were remitted only on January 25, 2021. 

 

The year-end balance of Due to GSIS of P4.957 million was remitted within the 

deadline except for the premium contributions of the CO, NCR and the ROs IV-A and XII  

totaling P4.581 million, P11,058.98, P1,614.73 and P108,998.42, respectively. The CO and 

the ROs IV-A and XII’s balances were remitted only on January 19, February 9, and 

February 10, 2021, respectively, while the NCR’s balance of P11,058.98 remained 

unremitted. 

 

Of the year-end balance of Due to Pag-IBIG of P65,066.35, P24,211.24 was 

remitted on time. The premium contributions of the NCR of P5,151.49 were not remitted 

while the balance of RO XIII of P35,703.62 was remitted only on January 26, 2021. 

 

The year-end balance of Due to PhilHealth amounting to P0.572 million was 

remitted within the deadline except for the premium contributions of NCR and RO XII of 

P2,329.65 and P28,037.97, respectively. The NCR’s balance remained unremitted while the 

RO XII’s balance was remitted only on February 10, 2021. 

 

a. Unremitted GSIS, Pag-IBIG and PhilHealth premium contributions – P18,540.12 
 

In the NCR, because of the non-maintenance of subsidiary ledgers, monthly 

remittances do not tally with monthly deductions, thereby leaving balances for each month 

which accumulated to P11,058.98, P5,151.49 and P2,329.65 for Due to GSIS, Due to Pag-

IBIG and Due to PhilHealth, respectively, as at December 31, 2020. 

 



69 

 

b. Delays in remittances of GSIS premium contributions – P369,823.43 
 

In the RO XII, GSIS premium contributions aggregating P369,823.43 were not 

remitted intact every 10th day of the following month with delays ranging from eight days to 

300 days. The RO XII Accountant explained that the noted delays were mainly because of 

the late updating of the GSIS web-based system where the premium contributions were not 

updated to account for the salary increase as a result of the Salary Standardization Law 

implementation and promotion of personnel. 

  

  We recommended that the Functional Head of the Local Government and 

Regional Operations Group require the Accountants:   

 

a) in NCR to (i) analyze and promptly remit the balances of Due to GSIS, Due to 
Pag-IBIG and Due to PhilHealth to the respective institutions; (ii) maintain 

subsidiary ledgers for each type of mandatory deduction which will serve as 

bases for the preparation of the summary of remittance; and (iii) remit the 

exact total amount of monthly deductions on or before the due dates; and  

 

b) in RO XII to remit the GSIS premium contributions on time. 
 

We recommend that the Functional Head of the Local Government and 

Regional Operations Group require the RO XII Accountant to timely update data on 

employees with salary increments in the GSIS web-based system so that premium 

contributions are reconciled with the billing statement. 

 

 

15. Information and Publicity on Projects/Programs/Activities (PPAs) 
 

Item 2.2 of COA Circular No. 2013-004 dated January 30, 2013 requires that 

notification to the public and other forms of announcement and/or publicity related to the 

PPAs shall be made at the least possible cost through posting relevant information on 

signboards, blackboards, whiteboards, among others, or similar materials in conspicuous 

places within the agency premises, and in the venue where the PPAs is located or carried 

out. 

 

In the CO, verification of the Reports of Quarterly Publicized PPAs for CY 2020 

showed that 34 projects totaling P1.631 billion were publicized. Likewise, the ROs II, III, V, 

VI and VIII have complied with the requirement while the NCR, CAR and RO IV-A have 

no PPAs in CY 2020 that require posting. No observations were reported in the MLs of the 

ROs IV-B, VII, IX, X, XI, XII and XIII. 

 

 

16. Transparency in Infrastructure Projects 
 

Section 93 of the General Provisions, GAA for FY 2020 requires all agencies of 

government to post in their websites details regarding infrastructure projects, such as the 



70 

 

project title, location, detailed description, detailed estimates in arriving at the Approved 

Budget for the Contract, and winning contractor and the detailed estimates of the bid as 

awarded, within 30 calendar days from entering into contract, among others. 

 

 The DBM have no infrastructure projects in CY 2020 that require the posting in its 

website. 

 

 

17. Transparency Seal on the Official Website  
 

  Both Section 94 of the General Provisions of the GAA for FY 2020 and Section 93 

of NBC No. 542 dated August 29, 2012 require that in order to enhance transparency and 

enforce accountability, all agencies of the government shall maintain a Transparency Seal to 

be posted on their websites. The Transparency Seal shall contain important data such as 

Agency's mandates and functions, names of its officials with their position and designation, 

and contact information; Annual procurement plan/s and contracts awarded with the winning 

supplier, contractor or consultant; BFARs; and other key information to be accessible to the 

public. 

 

  It is the responsibility of the Heads of the agencies and web administrators or their 

equivalent, to ensure compliance with the Transparency Seal requirements. While the 

updating may be delegated to specific owners, however, the responsibility remains with the 

Head of the agency. 

 

  Validation of the DBM’s compliance with the posting requirements revealed that 

all the required reports/information are included in the Transparency Seal in the DBM’s 

official website. 

 

 

GSIS Property Insurance Law 

 

18. Contents of the RO III’s office building and staff house totaling P8.825 million were not 
insured with the GIF of the GSIS which exposed the RO to the risk of not being 

indemnified in case of damage to or loss of its properties due to fire, earthquake, storm, 

or any unforeseen events. 

 

  Section 5 of RA No. 656, otherwise known as the Property Insurance Law, as 

amended by PD No. 245 dated July 13, 1973, requires all government agencies (except 

municipal governments below first class category) to insure against any insurable risk their 

properties, assets, and interests with the General Insurance Fund (GIF), as administered by 

the GSIS. 

 

  Evaluation of the agency’s compliance with RA No. 656 and COA Circular No. 

2018-002 revealed that the PPE of the DBM, except for the RO III’s PPE totaling P8.825 

million, were covered with adequate property insurance with the GSIS. 

 



71 

 

The RO III’s office building, staff house and four service vehicles were all insured 

while its office equipment, IT equipment, communications equipment, furniture and fixtures, 

and other PPE totaling P8.825 million were not insured with the GIF of the GSIS because 

the allocated budget for the payment of insurance premiums is insufficient to cover all of its 

insurable properties. According to the RO III Chief Administrative Officer, the inadequacy 

of funds, coupled with the weakness in the priority-setting process have contributed to their 

failure to fully comply with the requirement.  

  

  The non-insurance of these PPE items denied the RO III of adequate and reliable 

protection against any damage to or loss of its properties due to fire, earthquake, storm, or 

other fortuitous events/casualty. 

 

We recommended that Management require the Property Officer of RO III to: 

(a) request funds to cover the payment of insurance premiums of all the insurable 

properties of RO III; and (b) ensure that all of the insurable properties of the RO III 

are covered with adequate property insurance with the GSIS. 

 

 

19. Hiring of Casual, Job Orders, Contractual, and Consultants 
 

  By virtue of the CSC, DBM and the COA Joint Circular No. 1, s. 2017 dated June 

15, 2017, government agencies, including the Government Owned or Controlled 

Corporations, have been authorized on previous executive issuances and GAAs to enter into 

contracts with government entities, private firms, or individuals, and non-government 

organizations for services related or incidental to their respective functions and operations, 

whether on part-time or on full-time basis.  
 

  CSC-DBM-COA JC No. 1, s. 2017 was amended in 2019, which allowed the 

agencies to contract the services of new COS and JO workers and renew the existing 

contracts of COS and JO workers until December 31, 2020. 

 

               In CY 2020, a total of 36 COS workers and two JO personnel were hired and 

contracts renewed in the DBM and its ROs. The DBM had included in the contracts of COS 

workers and JO personnel the payment of salary or wage equivalent to the daily salary or 

wage of comparable positions in the government and a premium of up to 20 per cent of the 

salary wage. The hiring of COS workers and JO personnel was within the parameters 

provided for in the joint circular and no deficiency was noted in the audit of payments of 

salary/wage to COS workers and JO personnel, except for improperly documented first and 

last salary claims totaling P1.914 million as discussed in Table 12 and Appendix D of this 

report. 

 

 

20. Status of Audit Suspensions, Disallowances, and Charges 
 

For CY 2020, Notices of Suspension (NSs) in the RO XI on the payment for semi-

expendable properties, PPE and catering services totaling P0.892 million were fully settled 

upon submission of the lacking supporting documents. Notice of Settlement of 



72 

 

Suspension/Disallowance/Charge (NSSDC) Nos. 20-01 and 20-02 both dated June 25, 2020 

were issued to the persons responsible. 

 

In the CO, payments of P6,400.00 were made during the year to settle the eight 

Notices of Disallowance (NDs) issued from May 15 to 19, 2017 on unnecessary expenses
