internal controls regulating financial operations  and carried out compliance testing 

for determining the extent of control in operation; (iii)  conducted substantive testing 

of a representative sample of selected transactions;  (iv) carried out review, on test

balances of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses; and (v) conducted interviews 

and held discussions with the concerned officials and staff of the CO, as well as the 

ROs.  

The results of the audit were communicated to the Head of the Agency and the 

concerned officials through the issuance of Audit Observation Memoranda.
