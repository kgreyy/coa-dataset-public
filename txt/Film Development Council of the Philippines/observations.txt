OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

 

 

A. Financial Audit 
 

Erroneous recording of trust funds understated and overstated various accounts 

 

1. The erroneous recording of transactions pertaining to the receipt and transfer 
of funds from Singapore Film Council and Finas of Malaysia for the Cannes 

International Film Festival resulted in the overstatement of ₱10,310,863.98 and 

understatement of ₱7,207,841.98 of various accounts affecting the fair 

presentation of the financial statements, contrary to Section 15, Chapter 2, 

Volume I of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM). 

 

Section 15, Chapter 2, Volume I of the GAM provides that financial 

statements shall present fairly the financial position, financial performance and cash 

flows of an entity in accordance with the IPSASs.   

 

The audit of the accounts Cash-in-Bank-LCCA and Cash-MDS Trust as at 

December 31, 2020 revealed numerous errors in the recording of transactions that 

resulted in the unfair presentation of the agency’s financial statements.  

 

In February 2020, the FDCP received funds from Singapore Film Council and 

Finas of Malaysia for the booth sharing in the Cannes International Film Festival. 

However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the event was conducted on-line; hence, 

the payments made was refunded to FDCP.  Several journal entry vouchers (JEVs) 

were prepared to record the transactions, from the receipt of funds up to the closing 

of the lapsed NCA, where several errors were noted. 

 

Thereafter, the Audit Team issued an Audit Memorandum Observation 

(AOM) and consequently, the Accounting Unit prepared adjusting journal entry 

(AJE) to correct the errors noted. However, in addition to the remaining unadjusted 

erroneous entries, further mistakes were committed in the AJE. The result of analysis 

showed the following erroneous entries that overstated and understated by 

₱10,310,863.98 and ₱7,207,841.98, respectively, the affected accounts:

The Accountant explained that she is alone in the Accounting Unit and 

because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and numerous transactions, errors were 

inadvertently committed. 

 

COA Circular 2020-001 dated January 8, 2020, prescribing the Revised Chart 

of Accounts (Updated 2019), Volume III of the GAM, effective January 1, 2020, 

describes the following accounts: 

 

Account Name Description 

Subsidy from Other 

Funds 

Used to recognize the amount of funds/assets transferred 

from other funds. This account is debited, at year end, to 

close to the Revenue and Expense Summary account, 

and/or adjustments. 

Rental/Lease Expenses Used to recognize rental/lease of land, buildings, 

facilities, equipment, vehicle, machineries, ICT 

machinery and equipment and the like.

Accumulated 

Surplus/(Deficit) 

cumulative results of normal and continuous operations 

of an agency including prior period effects of changes in 

accounting policy and errors, and other capital 

adjustments. 

 

We recommended that Management direct the Accountant to: 

 

a. prepare the necessary adjusting entries to correct the erroneous recording 
of transactions; hence, would reflect the correct balances of the accounts; 

and 

 

b. henceforth, ensure the use of accurate accounts to avoid misstatements.   
 



35 

 

 

Management commented that the Accounting Unit inadvertently recorded the 

transactions in other accounts with no intention for misstatements as the description 

of transactions is stated in each Journal Entry Voucher (JEV). The Accounting Unit 

will be adopting better practices to review and ascertain the accuracy of entries in the 

preparation of the Financial Statements. Necessary adjusting entries will be prepared. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

The Audit Team will closely monitor the implementation of the 

recommendations.  

 

 

Unreliable balance of Receivables 

 

2. The aging schedule of FDCP’s receivables disclosed non-moving and/or 
dormant accounts for more than ten years totaling ₱77,984,920.04 due to (a) 

non-remittance by movie-houses and (b) LGUs of amusement taxes totaling 

₱3,133,577.13 and ₱55,393,426.17, respectively; (c) non-payment by film-

makers of the loan-assistance granted to them amounting to ₱18,127,158.09; and 

(d) various uncollected receivables totaling ₱1,330,778.65, which resulted in the 

uncertainty/unreliability of the balance of FDCP’s receivables.  

 

Pursuant to RA No. 9167, the FDCP is authorized to collect amusement tax 

for graded films from theater proprietors, operators and lessees of theaters or cinemas 

within Metro Manila and highly urbanized and independent cities in the Philippines 

of which 100 percent will be rebated to producers for films graded “A” and 65 percent 

for films graded “B”.  The remaining 35 percent share for Grade B films may be 

utilized by the FDCP to augment its operational expenses. Further, the FDCP can 

impose reasonable fees and charges for services rendered which it may also utilize to 

augment its operational expenses. 

 

As of December 31, 2020, the following receivables are non-moving/dormant 

for more than ten years up to 18 years:

As at December 31, 2020, ₱3,133,557.13 or 5.92 percent of the Accounts 

Receivable balance of ₱52,969,441.45 pertained to unremitted amusement taxes that 

have been dormant for over ten years. 

 

To validate the existence and accuracy of the account, the Audit Team sent 

out confirmation letters (CLs) to 47 operating theaters/debtors comprising 

₱50,660,002.44 of the ₱52,969,441.45 balance. However, no replies have been

According to the Accountant, several demand letters were already sent, in the 

past years and in CY 2020, to the cinema/theater operators, thru the OSG, to no avail, 

in non-conformance with Section 27(d), Article 8 of the IRR of RA No. 9167, the 

Act creating the FDCP, which states that “The proprietors, operators or lessees of the 

theaters or cinemas shall remit the amusement tax so deducted and withheld to the 

Council within thirty (30) days from the termination of the exhibition.” 

 

Management was advised that it should further examine the courses of action 

to be taken to maximize effort on the possible recovery of the dormant receivables, 

however, for those dormant account of 10 years and more, if collection proved futile, 

an appropriate request for authority to write-off dormant accounts should be filed 

strictly in accordance with COA Circular No. 2016-005. One of the supporting 



38 

 

 

documents for the request to write-off dormant receivable, as stated under Section 

8.3 therein is proof of exhaustion of all remedies to collect receivables, to wit: 

 

Section 8.3. The request shall be supported by the following 

documents: 

xxx 

b. Certified relevant documents validating the existence of the 
conditions, as applicable, such as: 

xxx 

b.6 Proof of exhaustion of all remedies to collect the receivables 

and demand to liquidate the cash advances and fund 

transfers, such as but not limited to copies of served or 

returned demand letters. 

xxx 

b.8 Certification by the responsible officials of the entity to the 

effect that there are no records/documents available to 

validate the claim. 

b.9 Other justifications, like in the case of request for write-off 

due to loss of documents, the circumstances of the loss 

should be stated in the letter request. 

The non-moving/dormant accounts casted doubts on the certainty/reliability 

of the balance of FDCP’s receivables. 

 

Further analysis of the account disclosed an understatement of ₱99,367.62 

resulting from the erroneous capture of the amount ₱1,430,146.22 instead of 

₱1,330,778.60 during reclassification from Accounts Receivable to Other 

Receivables, as shown below:

Limketkai CDO and 

SM Davao for 

MMFF. 

 

 

b) Due from LGUs 
 

Section 13 of RA No. 9167 authorizes the FDCP to give "A" or "B" grading 

to films, and such grade entitles the producer of the graded film an amusement tax 

reward as incentive. While Section 14 mandates the proprietors, operators or lessees 

of theaters or cinemas in cities and municipalities in Metro Manila and highly 

urbanized and independent component cities in the Philippines to remit the collected 

amusement tax to the FDCP. 
 



39 

 

 

The receivables from LGU pertained to amusement taxes remitted to LGU by 

theater owners/lessors. A total of ₱55,393,426.17 or 57.58 per cent have been non-

moving/dormant for more than ten years. The details are shown below: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

However, on December 10, 2019, the FDCP received the Supreme Court (SC) 

decision affirming SC’s previous decision with finality declaring as unconstitutional 

Section 13 and 14 of R.A. No 9167.  Sections 13 and 14 violate the principle of local 

fiscal autonomy since it authorized FDCP to earmark, and hence, effectively 

confiscate the amusement taxes, which should have otherwise inured to the benefit 

of the LGUs.  

 

Nevertheless, in the SC Decision G.R. 203754 dated June 16, 2015, the SC 

directed the Cebu City government to remit the amount of ₱76,836,807.08, which the 

FDCP was entitled to prior to the Court’s final decision. However, no remittance was 

made as at audit date; hence, there is uncertainty in the balance of the account Due 

from LGU. 

 

It was also observed that unlike the Accounts Receivable and Loans 

Receivable-Others accounts that have provision for Impairment Loss, the account 

Due from LGUs has no provision for such, in non-conformity with Section 10, 

Chapter 7, Volume I of the GAM, which states: 

 

An entity shall assess at the end of each reporting period whether 

there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or group of 

financial assets is impaired. If any such evidence exists, the entity 

shall measure the amount of loss as the difference between the 

carrying amount of the asset and the present value of estimated 

future cash flows discounted at the financial asset’s original 

effective interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset shall be 

reduced either directly or through use of an allowance account. The 

amount of the loss shall be recognized in surplus or deficit. 

 

 

c) Loans Receivable 
 

The account Loans Receivable with a balance of ₱18,127,158.09 pertains to 

loan assistance granted by FDCP to various filmmakers. The loan assistance was 

covered by a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) where, according to the 

Accountant, it was stipulated therein that in the event the movies turned out low in 

ticket sales, the producers shall turn over the films to FDCP as exchange for the

assistance granted.  However, it was noted that only the first page of the MOA is on 

file and that no other document is available to show the actual terms and conditions 

of the loan agreement; hence the Audit Team could not validate the statement of the 

Accountant. 

 

Verification revealed that the producers of the films were unable to pay the 

FDCP due to the movies’ low-turn-out of ticket sales. Some of these films were 

already turned over to FDCP and are stored in the film archive, and being utilized in 

its Sineng Pambansa Program. 

 

As at December 31, 2020, the following Loans Receivable from various 

producers have been dormant from 10 to 14 years: 

 

The absence of complete set of MOA and other supporting documents 

prevented the Audit Team from further verification and validation of the terms and 

conditions of the loan assistance; casting doubt on the fair presentation of the account. 

 

d) Other Receivables 
 

A total of ₱7,063,522.78 out of the Other Receivables account balance of 

₱14,529,196.17 remained uncollected as at December 31, 2020, and have been non-

moving/dormant from 2 to 18 years. The receivables pertained to the following:

Aside from the demand letters sent by the then Executive Director and Head 

National Film Festival on CYs 2012, 2013, and 2015 demanding for the submission 

of the final cut of the films or the return of the seed money granted to them as agreed 

upon in the MOAs and in the Undertakings, there were no additional documented 

actions from the Management for the collection of the ₱5,250,000.00. 

 

Moreover, reconciliation made by the agency resulted in the increase of the 

Other Receivables account balance by ₱482,744.18 and ₱2,465,673.39, representing 

receivable from SM Cinema from 2013-2015 and Cine Lokal from 2017-2018, 

respectively. Management informed the Audit Team that the adjustments were due 

to coordination with different LGUs in the enforcement of its powers towards the 

collection of the accounts and also due to series of meetings held with SM Lifestyle 



42 

 

 

Entertainment for the reconciliation and eventually payment of the outstanding 

balances.  

 

Notwithstanding, according to the Accountant, the LGUs would not cooperate 

and pay their outstanding balances unless they are provided with the MOAs, which 

could not be done by management as of this time due to the incomplete 

documentation on their file. 
 

A request sent to COA for the authority to write-off the ₱1,330,778.65 that 

pertained to amusement taxes receivables from all closed cinemas was denied due to 

lack of evidence on exhaustion of all efforts to collect the above amount. 

Management claimed that demand letters were sent to the last known address of the 

debtors, thru OSG, but failed. 

 

e) Interest Receivables 
 

Interest Receivables of ₱1,588,454.79 pertained to the accumulated unpaid 

interest for fines and penalties on the dormant Other Receivables of ₱5,250,000.00 

loan assistance granted to five filmmakers. The amount of ₱130,389.04 out of the 

₱1,588,454.79, has been dormant for eight (8) years. 

 

These five filmmakers were unable to produce five movies from years 2011 to 
2016, as allegedly stipulated in the MOA; thus, no film was submitted to FDCP.  The last 

documented demand letter sent by FDCP was in CY 2015 demanding for the submission 

of the final cut of the films or the return of the seed money granted to them. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to:  

 

a. examine other courses of action that maximize effort on the possible 
recovery of the dormant receivables and/or coordinate with the OSG to 

execute legal remedies; 

 

b. direct the Administrative and Finance Division to: 
i. intensify effort to locate and furnish the Audit Team the 

MOAs/Undertakings and all supporting documents, and pertinent 

records relevant to these receivables; and 

 

ii. pursue collection; 
 

c. if other remedies proved futile, request from COA for authority to write-
off dormant accounts in accordance with COA Circular No. 2016-005; and 

 

d. instruct the Accountant to: 
i. prepare AJE to correct the understatement of the Accounts 

Receivable account in the amount of ₱99,367.62; and 

 



43 

 

 

ii. provide for Impairment Loss for the account Due from LGUs. 
 

 

Deficiencies in the grant and utilization of Cash Advances (CAs)  

 

3. Various deficiencies, contrary to the provisions of COA Circular No. 97-002, 
were committed, such as (a) non-liquidation of CAs at the end of the year and  

the grant of additional CAs to Special Disbursing Officers (SDOs) with still 

unliquidated CAs resulting in its accumulation to ₱28,266,039.04 at year-end; 

(b) the transfer of the SDO’s CA to another personnel; (c) the grant of CAs to 

non-permanent/co-terminus employees; and (d) the use of CAs to purchase 

goods and services that can be acquired in regular procurement process; thus, 

making the CA susceptible to loss or misuse or theft, and the possibility of 

misplaced or lost supporting documents due to prolonged settlement. 
 

COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 provides the following 

rules on cash advances: 
 

Section 4.1.2 No additional cash advances shall be allowed to any 

official or employee unless the previous cash advance given to him 

is first settled or a proper accounting thereof is made. 

 

Section 4.1.4 Only permanently appointed officials shall be 

designated as disbursing officers. Elected officials may be granted a 

cash advance only for their official traveling expenses. 

 

Section 4.1.6 Transfer of cash advance from one Accountable 

Officer (AO) to another shall not be allowed. 

 

Section 5.8 All CAs shall be fully liquidated at the end of each year. 

Except for petty cash fund, the Accountable Officer shall refund any 

unexpected balance to the Cashier/Collecting Officer who will issue 

the necessary Official receipt. 

 

a) Non-liquidation at the end of the year; Grant of additional CAs to SDOs with 
unliquidated CAs 

  

As at December 31, 2020, the FDCP’s outstanding advances that were granted 

to 11 SDOs had accumulated to ₱28,266,039.04, with the following details:

As gleaned from the preceding Table, various SDOs were continuously 

granted additional CAs despite non-liquidation of their previous CAs, contrary to 

Section 4.1.2 of COA Circular No. 97-002. Considering that said CAs were granted 

with specific purpose and were time-bound, the SDOs are obligated to submit 

liquidation documents as soon as the purpose of their CAs have been served (Section 

4.1.3 of COA Circular 97-001). 



45 

 

 

 

The longer the SDOs are unable to settle/liquidate their advances, the more 

the cash in their possession is at risk of loss or misuse or theft, and the possibility of 

misplaced or lost supporting documents. 

 

Moreover, to inculcate AOs of their responsibility, the Civil Service 

Commission (CSC) issued CSC Memorandum Circular (MC) No. 23 s.2019 on the 

revised guidelines on the settlement of cash advances and the penalty to be imposed 

for failure to liquidate within the prescribed period. Section 5.4 thereof states: 

 

An Accountable Officer shall be held liable for Gross Neglect of 

Duty and impose the penalty of dismissal from the service for the 

first offence in any of the following instances, to wit: 

 

a. the Accountable Officer who, after formal demand by the State 
Auditor or Audit Team Leader, fails to make any liquidation, 

whether partial or full, of the cash advances within the 

prescribed period stated in the formal demand letter. xxx 

 

b) Transfer of the SDO’s CA to another personnel 
 

As provided for in Section 4.1.6 of the above-cited Circular, transfer of CA 

from one AO to another shall not be allowed. However, the Audit Team noted an 

instance where one SDO did not personally perform his disbursing functions but 

transferred his fund to another personnel. 

 

Our verification disclosed that a CA totaling ₱472,357.00 was granted in CY 

2020 to SDO Don Gervin Arawan for the enhancement of Cinematheque Iloilo, but 

he transferred the fund to Ms. Daniella Julieta Caro-Barbosa, a Contract of Service 

(COS) employee, who performed the disbursement for the Cinematheque Iloilo. 

Although the CA was subsequently liquidated within the year, the action of the SDO 

is irregular and contrary to the aforecited provisions of COA Circular 97-002. He 

exposed the fund to risk of possible loss. 

 

c) Grant of CAs to non-permanent/co-terminus employees 
  

  The Team further noted that FDCP grants CAs to non-permanent or co-

terminus employees, contrary to Section 4.1.4 of the Circular, which states that only 

duly appointed or designated disbursing officers may perform disbursing functions.

Co-terminus/Contractual

The practice of granting cash advances to non-permanent/co-terminus 

employees exposes the government to non-indemnification in case of loss, misuse or 

theft of the fund.   

 

d) Use of CAs to purchase goods and services that can be acquired in regular 
procurement process 

 

Section 2 of the COA Circular 97-002 states that all payments must be made 

by check, however, in practice, there are certain instances when it may be very 

difficult, impractical or impossible to make payments by check. In such cases, 

payments may be made by the disbursing officer in the form of cash through his cash 

advance. 

 

The special cash advances though are limited to the following purposes, in 

accordance with Section 3.2, to wit: 

 

3.2 Special cash advances are those granted on the explicit authority 

of the Head of the Agency only to duly designated disbursing 

officers or employees for other legally authorized purposes, as 

follows: 

 

3.2.1 Current operating expenditures of the agency field 
office or of the activity of the agency undertaken in the 

field when it is impractical to pay the same by check, 

such as – 

 

- Salaries, Wages and Allowances 

- Maintenance and other operating expenses xxx 

 

Review of the liquidation documents disclosed that CAs were granted to 

SDOs for purposes other than what is allowed under COA Circular 97-002. CAs 

were utilized for the procurement of goods and services aggregating ₱2,485,318.60 



47 

 

 

that could be paid by check without encountering difficulty, impracticality or 

impossibility.

The procurement procedure undertaken by the agency on the above 

transaction did not adhere with the provisions of Republic Act (RA) No. 9184, the 

Government Procurement Reform Act; hence, the government was deprived of 

obtaining the possible lowest prices on the procured items/services. 

 

Section 2 of the Revised Implementing Rules and Regulation (RIRR) of RA 

No. 9184 states that “xxx. It is the policy of the GOP that procurement of 

infrastructure projects, goods and consulting services shall be competitive and 

transparent, and therefore shall go through public bidding, except as otherwise 

provided in this IRR.” 

 

 Furthermore, the AOs at the time of the grant of CAs were not properly 

bonded, in violation of Section 101(2) of PD No. 1445 which states that- “Every 

accountable officer shall be properly bonded in accordance with law.” 

 

e) the expenses for CY 2020 was understated by undetermined amount 
 

Further review of the CAs showed that based on the purpose of the grant, the 

following activities have already been completed in CY 2020, however, due to the 



48 

 

 

non-submission of liquidation documents, expenditures were not recorded, thereby 

resulting in the understatement of expenses by undetermined amount.

The above conditions also reflect laxity in the monitoring and enforcement of 

regulations on the grant, utilization and liquidation of cash advances.  Delays in the 



49 

 

 

submission of liquidation reports signify poor internal control system where an 

adequate one could prevent possible loss and/or misappropriation. 

     

We recommended Management to: 

 

a. instruct the SDOs to liquidate their CAs within the prescribed period and 
at the end of the year to ensure proper recording of all expenses in the year 

they are incurred; and 

 

b. direct the Accountant and all concerned officials to strictly enforce the 
provisions of COA Circular No. 97-002, RA No. 9184, and the PD No. 1445 

pertaining to the grant, utilization and liquidation of cash advances. 

 

 Management commented the following: 

 

1) Cash advances remained unliquidated due to COVID-19 pandemic, which 
hinder the timely submission of the liquidation. Of the ₱28,266,039.04, the 

amount of ₱18,902,743.04 has already been submitted to the Accounting Office 

for checking and processing. 

 

2) The bonding application documents of all accountable officers have already 
been complied and submitted to the Bureau of Treasury for processing. 

 

3) The non-permanent personnel who were granted cash advances were already 
appointed regular. During dates where cash advances were granted to them, the 

appointment papers were in process for submission to CSC. 

 

4) For events of FDCP, cash advances were used to procure the much-needed 
goods and services that comprised mostly of services of talents, performers, 

actors who prefer payments in cash. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

The Audit Team will closely monitor the grant and liquidation of cash 

advances as well as compliance with the provisions of RA No. 9184.  

 

 

Unrecorded expenditures out of the liquidated advances 

 

4. Expenditures of ₱2,459,500.00 out of the liquidated cash advance of 
₱2,763,594.00 were not recorded in the books, resulting in understatement of the 

affected expenses accounts and overstatement of Accumulated Surplus/Deficit. 

Moreover, no liquidation reports were submitted to the Audit Team to validate 

the propriety and regularity of the cash advance utilization.

Verification disclosed that a total of ₱2,459,500.00 was posted in the General 

Ledger (GL) as liquidation for the CA of ₱2,763,594.00. However, the expenses 

related thereto were not recorded in the corresponding expenses accounts, resulting 

in their understatement. Details are as follows:

The non-submission of liquidation reports to the Audit Team prevented the 

validation of the propriety and regularity of the posted liquidation. 



51 

 

 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Accountant 

to: 

 

a. post to the GL the corresponding expenses of the liquidated amount; 
 

b. submit to the Audit Team the JEV and the liquidation documents to 
support the reported liquidation of ₱2,459,500.00; 

 

c. prepare the necessary AJE for the Repairs and Maintenance that were 

reverted back to Cash Advances; and 

 

d. thoroughly review all transactions before recording in the books of 

accounts. 

 

 

Unserviceable Property, Plant, and Equipment (PPE) have not been disposed  

 

5. The mode for disposal for the unserviceable PPEs of the agency totaling 
₱1,798,226.22 have been decided by the Disposal Committee and approved by 

the head of the agency, however, as of December 31, 2020, these unserviceable 

PPEs have not been disposed yet, and no Inventory and Inspection Report of 

Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) was prepared, contrary to Section 40 (d), 

Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM.  

 

Section 40 (d), Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM, which provides that “all 

unserviceable property shall be reported in the IIRUP. PPE reported in the IIRUP 

shall be dropped from the books by debiting Impairment Loss-Property, Plant and 

Equipment (cost of the PPE less Accumulated Depreciation). 

 

In compliance with prior year’s audit recommendation, the FDCP created a 

Disposal Committee who recommended to the Chairperson, and who subsequently 

approved, the disposal of the unserviceable PPEs totaling ₱1,798,226.22 with the 

following modes of disposal.  It was noted however, that no IIRUP was prepared, but 

only a list of unserviceable items for disposal was attached to the recommendation of 

Disposal Committee.

Verification, however, showed that as of date, these unserviceable equipment 

have not been disposed, no IIRUP was prepared, thus no provision for impairment 

has been recognized. 

 

Inquiry with management revealed a plan to revise the recommendation of 

the Disposal Committee on the unserviceable PPEs. 



53 

 

 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the: 

 

a. The Property Officer to prepare the corresponding IIRUP for all 
unserviceable PPEs; 

 

b. Accountant to prepare the necessary adjusting entries to recognize 
impairment loss of the unserviceable PPEs upon receipt of the IIRUP, in 

accordance with Section 40(d), Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM; and  

 

c. Disposal Committee to cause the immediate disposal of the unserviceable 
properties to avoid further deterioration and to generate additional income 

from their disposal. 

 

 

Financial Assistance recorded as outright expense 

 

6. Financial Assistance/Grants released to production companies and 
organizations amounting to ₱11,626,000.00 were recorded as expenses under 

Subsidies-Others account instead of Due from NGOs/CSOs or Other 

Receivables as provided in Paragraph 17 of the International Public Sector 

Accounting Standards (IPSAS) 23, resulting in the overstatement of expenses 

and understatement of receivables by the same amount. 
 

Audit of the expense account Subsidies-Others showed that it included 

grants/assistance amounting to ₱11,626,000.00, which pertained to the financial 

assistance of FDCP to filmmakers, production companies and NGOs. 

 

Paragraph 17 of IPSAS 23 provides that when a recipient initially recognizes 

an asset that is subject to a condition, the recipient also incurs liability; thus, the giver 

of the funds should record a corresponding receivable. 

 

Verification disclosed that the MOA contained conditions to be 

complied/submitted by the grantee to the FDCP, however, despite the presence of 

conditions, the funds released to the filmmakers, production companies and NGOs 

were recorded by the Accountant as outright expenses under Subsidies-Others 

account instead of Due from NGOs/CSOs or Other Receivables. Details are as 

follows:

The Revised Chart of Accounts (Updated 2019), Volume III of the GAM 

defines Subsidies-Others as used to recognize the financial assistance given to 



55 

 

 

individuals and institutions other than government agencies or NGOs/POs for 

government programs/projects/activities. 

 

While NGO is defined in Section 2.5 of COA Circular No. 2007-001 as a non-

profit, voluntary organization committed to the task of socio-economic development 

and established primarily for services such as assisting citizen or people’s 

organization in various ways by educating, training, or giving funds to them. This 

shall include foundations created for the same purpose. 

 

The practice of recording financial assistance with conditions as an outright 

expense not only would undermine the monitoring on the project’s progress, and on 

the compliance of the conditions set forth in the MOAs, but also is contrary to IPSAS 

23. 

 

Likewise, the noted deficiency resulted in the overstatement of Subsidies-

Others account by ₱11,626,000.00 and the understatement of the accounts Other 

Receivables and Due from NGOs/CSO by ₱10,626,000.00 and ₱1,000,000.00, 

respectively.  

 

We recommended that Management direct the Accountant to: 

 

a. review all documents relative to the financial assistance given to 
production companies/organizations and prepare the necessary adjusting 

entries to establish the correct balances of the accounts affected; and 

 

b. strictly monitor the submission by the grantees of the liquidation reports 
and supporting documents as required in the MOA. 

 

Management commented that they have made the necessary adjusting entries 

in February 2021 and instructed the concerned divisions/units of FDCP to strictly 

monitor the submission of required documents per MOA. 

 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

   

The Audit Team will closely monitor the submission of the liquidation reports 

and supporting documents as required in the MOA. 

 

  

B. Compliance Audit 

 

Compliance Audit on DEAR Program 

 

7. Weaknesses in internal control system in the implementation of the Disaster/Emergency 
Assistance and Relief (DEAR) Program resulted in: a) incomplete documentary 

requirements for the payment of DEAR assistance; b) failure to apply fidelity bond for 



56 

 

 

the AO; and c) irregular and excessive payment of DEAR assistance in the amount of 

₱309,000.00 thereby, affecting the validity and propriety of the Program. 

  

Efficient management of government resources is among the major 

responsibilities of every government agency.  Measures should be installed to prevent 

wastage and loss of public funds and properties. 

 

Section 4 (6) of PD 1445 requires that claims against government funds shall 

be supported with complete documentation.  

 

In connection with the DEAR Program, the following CAs were granted to 

Mr. Frank David Fabros, Executive Assistant I for the implementation of DEAR 

program for displaced film and AV workers.

The following deficiencies were noted in the review of the submitted 

Liquidation Reports (LRs) and its supporting documents: 

 

a) Documentary requirements for the payment DEAR assistance were incomplete 
 

Review of the LRs and the supporting documents for the first to fourth tranche 

of the DEAR assistance disclosed that the documentary requirements were 

incomplete. Almost all of the beneficiaries lack the required certification from 

DOLE/DSWD/SSS, which is crucial in the determination of whether the applicant is 

qualified or not to receive DEAR Assistance. 

 

Absence of required documents is contrary to Section 4 (6) of PD 1445 and 

FDCP Advisory Nos. 01, 02 and 04, series of 2020; hence, affects the validity and 

propriety of the disbursements made. The summary of incomplete documentary 

requirements is detailed in Annex E. 

 

In addition, the following deficiencies were noted in the review of supporting 

documents:

The abovementioned deficiencies indicated lapses; hence, requires control

b) Failure to apply fidelity bond for the AO 
 

Section 7.1 of COA Circular 2006-005 dated July 13, 2006 provides that each 

accountable officer whose total cash accountability is not less than ₱5,000 shall be 

bonded.  The amount of bond shall depend on the total accountability of the officer 



58 

 

 

as fixed by the Head of the Agency.  An official or employee who has both money 

and property accountability shall be bonded only once to cover both accountabilities, 

but the amount of bond shall be in accordance with the Schedule issued by the Bureau 

of Treasury. 

 

The audit team noted that the SDO was not bonded as prescribed by the 

Circular; thus, the agency is not protected in case of loss or misuse of government 

funds.  

 

c) Irregular and excessive payment of DEAR assistance amounting to 
₱309,000.00 in violation of COA Circular No. 2012-0002 dated October 29, 

2012 and FDCP DEAR Program Advisories 

 

COA Circular No. 2012-002 dated October 29, 2012 states that irregular 

expenditure signifies an expenditure incurred without adhering to established rules, 

regulations, procedural guidelines, policies, principles or practices that have gained 

recognition in laws.  

 

The FDCP DEAR Program provides that approved beneficiaries of the DEAR 

Program will receive a one-time flat rate cash financial assistance of ₱5,000.00 

₱8,000.00 to cover expenses during the disaster period, like personal needs, medical 

expenses housing and rent and other essentials.  

 

Review of the liquidation of DEAR Assistance revealed the following 

irregular expenditures totaling ₱309,000.00: 

 

     Amount (₱)     Particular Remarks 

270,000.00 Paid to the wife of allegedly

We recommended that Management strengthen its internal control 

system in the processing of claims such that: 

 

a. instruct the SDO to submit the necessary documents to support the 
liquidation of the 1st to 4th tranches in accordance with Section 4 (6) of PD 

1445 and FDCP Advisory No. 01 series of 2020, and to immediately apply 

for fidelity bond with the BTr, pursuant to COA Circular No. 2006-005 

dated July 13, 2006;  

 

b. require the beneficiaries who received double payment of the assistance to 
refund the excess payment or submit justification; and  

 

c. institute measures to prevent duplication/conflict of payment with other 
financial assistance granted by other government instrumentalities. 

 

Management commented the following: 

 

1) FDCP acknowledged that application documents, at the time of submission and 
acceptance, may have been incomplete or lacking signatures or unnotarized, but 

the Agency assures COA that a careful and thorough vetting of each applicant 

was conducted via maximized digital communication means by agents and 

verifiers. In instances where the documents cannot be provided by the 

applicants due to quarantine circumstances, FDCP provided alternative 

documents or means for applicants to prove their eligibility to the program, 

including Verifier’s Notes that are duly signed by the Agency’s verifiers who 

personally called, emailed, and communicated via all available means with 

employers, producers, and companies that vouched for each applicant. 

 

2) FDCP did not require actual documentary certifications coming from DOLE, 
DSWD or SSS from applicants, but instead, included a provision in the 

Affidavit of the applicants that they certify that they have not received any 

assistance from these agencies. The same is true of the applicants’ commitment 

to provide Return Service in exchange for the DEAR assistance. The applicants’ 

acceptance of the terms of the Affidavit, the falsification of which is punishable 

by law, already served to satisfy these particular eligibility requirements. 

Nonetheless, FDCP submitted the requested documents as mentioned in the 

AOM. Furthermore, in the event of reactivation of the DEAR Program, FDCP 

will be taking measures that allow for stricter verification and securing of 

documents (both hard copy and digital) from applicants. 

 



60 

 

 

3) FDCP acknowledged the need to secure fidelity bonds for its officers to cover 
financial accountability of the Agency’s fund. The SDO, along with the other 

officers of the Agency, has already secured the necessary medical certification 

for Form No. 58 and is currently processing the application for fidelity bond at 

the Bureau of Treasury. 

 

4) With regard to the grant of assistance to the wife of allegedly AV worker who 
died of COVID-19 for financial assistance, she submitted the necessary 

documents (letter of request, medical documents and bills, death certificate, 

marriage certificate and Mister Delos Reyes filmography and profile) that 

proved that her husband died due to COVID-19 and was a film worker and 

among those who were first from the industry to succumb to the virus and has 

not and until now, received any form of assistance from other government 

agencies. 

 

5) In the case of an actor and the director, FDCP clarifies that the FDCP advisory 
No. 1-A specified that the FDCP reserves the right to prioritized low-income 

individuals in its initial disbursement of funds, but does not automatically 

disqualify everyone else outside of the priority. 

 

6) Finally, with regard to inadvertent double payments to the recipients, FDCP has 
reached out already to the individuals to address and return the excess payments 

following agreed upon terms and condition. 

 

Auditors’ Rejoinder: 

 

The audit team will closely monitor the implementation of the audit 

recommendations. As in the case of the deceased AV worker, the Audit Team 

maintained that issuance of specific guidelines for payment for financial assistance 

for medical or hospital expenses related to COVID-19 should be made. On the other 

hand, since the payment has already been received by the wife, we require the 

submission of the copy of the official receipt for the payment of the hospital bill 

balance to De Lassalle University Medical Center for further validation and 

evaluation. 

 

 

Non-compliance with RA No. 9184 and its 2016 Revised IRR  

 

8. Pertinent provisions of the RA No. 9184 and its 2016 Revised Implementing 
Rules and Regulations (RIRR) were not complied with in the procurement of 

digital restoration and preservation of films totaling ₱3,375,000.00, and in the 

maintenance of Film Scanning and Paraphernalia totaling ₱2,058,904.24. 

 

Section 2 of PD No. 1445 states that: “it is the declared policy of the State 

that all resources of the government shall be managed, expended or utilized in 

accordance with law and regulations, and safeguarded against loss or wastage through 



61 

 

 

illegal or improper disposition, with a view to ensuring efficiency, economy and 

effectiveness in the operations of government.  The responsibility to take care that 

such policy is faithfully adhered to rests directly with the chief or head of the 

government agency concerned.” 

 

The governing principles on government procurement as contained in RA No. 

9184 and its 2016 RIRR, require among others the principle of transparency, 

competitiveness, economy, and streamlined procurement process. These principles 

are translated into provisions and requirements to attain efficient and effective 

method of procurement. 

 

The Philippine Film Archive (PFA) Division under the FDCP is duly 

mandated to take charge of the collection, archiving, preservation, management, and 

access provision of all Filipino films and other audio-visual materials produced in the 

Philippines and/or abroad.  Also, it is mandated to established to collect, conserve 

and protect audio-visual materials as part of the nation’s historical, cultural, and 

artistic heritage. 

 

During the year, the FDCP acquired the services of Central Digital Lab, Inc. 

for the digital restoration and preservation of various films with a total contract cost 

of ₱6,250,000.00. Review of the DVs disclosed that FDCP resorted to Direct 

Contracting mode of procurement as recommended by the Bids and Awards 

Committee (BAC). 

 

It was also observed that the one-quotation offer was approved and paid out 

of advance payment on the same day. Another quotation offer was not approved but 

paid out of advance payment two days after the offer.  Details are shown below:

It can be gleaned that the advance payments were 66.67 and 50 percent of 

each contract price, in violation of Section 4, Annex D of the 2016 RIRR of RA No. 

9184, which states that in accordance with PD No. 1445, advance payment shall be 

made only after prior approval of the President, and shall not exceed fifteen per cent 

of the contract amount, unless otherwise directed by the President. 

 

Examination of documents of another procurement disclosed that the contract 

amounting to ₱2,058,904.24 for the maintenance of Film Scanning and Paraphernalia 

by Media Village, Inc. was made through Shopping mode of procurement but without 

BAC Resolution. The Audit Team also noted that the supplier was paid a month in 

advance (September 24, 2020) since the dates of the signed/received Purchase Order 

and Billing Invoice were a month after the advance payment (October 20, 2020). 

 

Further, the necessary documentary requirements prescribed under Part IV, 

Annex “H” of the 2016 RIRR such as Mayor’s Permit, PhilGEPS Registration 

number, and Income Tax Return were not attached to the DVs. 

 

Sections 2, 10 and 48 of the RIRR of RA No. 9184 state that the procurement 

of goods, infrastructure projects and consulting services shall be competitive and 

transparent, and therefore shall undergo competitive bidding.  It provides that 

whenever justified by the conditions provided by the Act, the procuring entity (PE) 

may, in order to promote economy and efficiency, resort to any of the alternative 

methods of procurement, subject to the recommendation of the BAC and 

subsequently, the approval of the Head of the Procuring Entity (HOPE). 

 

The Alternative Methods of Procurement shall be resorted to only in the 

highly exceptional cases provided for in the Guidelines and subject to the prior 

approval of the HOPE upon recommendation of the BAC. In all instances, the PE 

shall ensure that the most advantageous price for the Government is obtained. 

 

It was noted that that all the above-mentioned procurements were not included 

in the submitted Annual procurement program (APP). Failure to prepare or update 

the APP signifies inadequate operational planning and budgeting that could badly 

affect the operation of the agency. 

 

We recommended that Management: 

 

a. submit an explanation for the advance payments that went beyond the 
limit of 15 percent of the contract costs, as mandated by law; 

 

b. submit an approved/revised APP that included the contracted projects; 
 

c. instruct the BAC to strictly comply with the provisions of RA No. 9184 and 
its 2016 RIRR, and submit the necessary documents required under Annex 

“H”; and 



63 

 

 

 

d. direct the Cashier to submit an explanation why payment was made ahead 
of the approval of the PO and the billing invoice. 

 

Management commented the following: 

 

1) On the manner of direct contracting for digital restoration services by the 
Agency - 

 

There was already an existing proposal prior to June 26, 2020 but that was 

changed in the final minute to include additional services beneficial to the 

government, which were transcription, translation and subtitling of the film. 

 

This was a product of several negotiations with the supplier. There is only 

one company in the Philippines that offers Film Restoration Services, Central 

Digital lab (CDL); hence, procurement through direct contracting. To get the 

best condition for the government, the FDCP and the CDL conducted several 

meetings to discuss the project film and the conditions for the film restoration 

agreement. The final items discussed in the negotiation were embodied in the 

final proposal agreement attached in the documentation of the project. 

 

Regarding the advance payment made of 50%, this service provider in the 

film restoration project already advanced several works on the project even 

prior to the finalization of the terms and conditions of the agreement as well 

as in determining the final cost of the project. It is in this manner that it is an 

industry practice or standard, that down payment of the film restoration 

projects is usually at the minimum of 50%. Further, in line with the processes 

involved in the film restoration, it can be said that 50% of the project is 

complete once the film passes from analog phase to digital phase. 

 

2) We will process and submit the revised APP to COA as soon as possible. 
 

3) Already instructed the BAC to strictly comply with the provisions of RA No. 
9184 and its 2016 RIRR, and submit the required documents under Annex H. 

 

4) On the Procurement of Film Scanning and Paraphernalia from Media 

Village, Inc. 

 

The annual payment made to the Media Village for the Maintenance of the 

Film Scanner and Paraphernalia includes almost all of the workstation in the 

film digitization of the PFA. This also includes system integration and 

monitoring. This item also includes licenses for the software being used in 

the various workstation such as Phoenix Refine. The services were availed 

from them since it is the same company from whom the hardware were 

purchased.  It should be corrected as well that the service was procured not 

by shopping but through direct contracting. A resolution/recommendation for 



64 

 

 

the same was already issued during the initial maintenance period of the 

system. As to the documents mentioned in the observation (Mayor's Permit, 

PhilGEPS Registration number, and the ITR), these have already been 

submitted by the company in initial transactions, but the Agency can submit 

these again. 

 

Furthermore, the PO for the maintenance of the film scanner was dated 

September 24, 2020, which FDCP already prepared the check based on the 

said PO but the check was not released/paid until the signed PO and billing 

was received by this office and attached to the voucher for   submission to 

COA. The check was released November 11, 2020. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

   

The Audit Team maintain that preparation of check prior to approval of the 

PO and billing statements is prohibited. Verification of the Bank Reconciliation 

Statement for September and October 2020 disclosed that this check has been 

reported as outstanding, indicating that the check has been reported in the bank as 

issued and has been outstanding since September 2020. Further, the Audit Team also 

maintain the need for proof of posting in PhilGEPS or PE website, and submission 

of Mayor's Permit, PhilGEPS Registration number, and the ITR before the payment 

was made as provided in the Annex “H” of the 2016 RIRR.  

 

We will closely monitor the implementation of the recommendations. 

 

 

Lack of supporting documents for payment of Other Professional Services 

 

9. The legality, validity and accuracy of the payments aggregating ₱25,040,013.91 
for the salaries of COS personnel for the period January to December 2020 

could not be ascertained due to non-submission of the documentary 

requirements such as Daily Time Records (DTRs), Contracts of Service and 

Accomplishment Reports (ARs), as required under Section 4(6) of PD No. 1445 

and COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012. 
 

Section 4(6) of PD No. 1445 requires that financial transactions and 

operations of any government agency shall be supported with complete 

documentation. 
 

Likewise, Paragraph 3, Section 4.1.3 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated 

June 14, 2012 on the documentation of payments for the salary of personnel under 

Casual/Contract of Service, provides that the documentary requirements shall 

include: (a) Copy of the Service Contract; (b) Certification by the Personnel Officer 

that the activities/services cannot be provided by regular or permanent personnel of 

the agency; (c) ARs; and (d) Approved DTRs. 
 



65 

 

 

Further, Paragraph 3.1.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-001 requires that: 

  
Within five (5) working days from the execution of a contract by the 
government agency xxx, shall submit a copy of said contract and 
each of all the documents forming part thereof by reference or 
incorporation to the Auditor of the agency concerned. 

 

Post audit of payrolls of COS employees for the period January 2020 to 

December 2020 showed that the documents required under Paragraph 3, Section 4.1.3 

of COA Circular No. 2012-001 were not attached to the payrolls nor submitted to the 

Audit Team. 

 

As stated in the contract, the COS employees have no employer-employee 

relationship and that they will provide a full-time service at a monthly rate specified 

therein. Hence, submission of the above documents is necessary to ascertain the 

legality, validity and accuracy of the payments of the salaries of COS personnel 

totaling ₱24,738,513.91. 
 

Further, included in the total amount of ₱24,738,513.91 are professional fees 

of talents, artist, crews and other professionals, paid out of CAs, during events of the 

FDCP in the total amount of ₱1,320,002.23. However, we noted that no AR or 

Certificate of Service Rendered were attached to the payments. 

 

The AR and Certificate of Service Rendered are necessary to assess and 

validate the actual duties performed as against the duties stipulated in the Contract of 

Service Agreement. Without these, the Audit Team could not validate if the functions 

performed are not part of the job description of the agency’s existing regular 

employee or if the services were actually rendered. 
 

The practice of not submitting the required supporting documents for the 

payments of salaries of COS employees and professional fees of 

talents/artists/professional is contrary to the above stated regulations. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to submit the documentary 

requirements for the payments of salaries of COS employees and the Certificate 

of Service Rendered for the professional fees paid to talents, artists, crews and 

other professionals. Henceforth, require the Accounting Unit that claims shall 

be processed for payment only when documentary requirements are complete 

to establish the validity of the claims.   

 

 

Delayed submission of POs and Job Orders (JOs) 
 

10. Copies of 49 PO and JOs and their supporting documents with corresponding 
amount of ₱7,485,158.24 were not submitted within the prescribed period under 

Items 3.1.1 and 3.2.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated 12 February 2009, 



66 

 

 

which precluded their timely review. Likewise, notices of delivery of procured 

items were not forwarded to the Auditor as prescribed under Section A.2 of 

COA Circular No. 96-010 dated August 15, 1996.  

 

Section 3.2.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-001 on the submission of copies of 

government contracts, POs and their supporting documents to the COA, states in part 

“A copy of any purchase order irrespective of amount, and each and every supporting 

document, shall, within five (5) working days from issuance thereof, be submitted to 

the Auditor concerned xxx.” 

 

 While Section A.2 of COA Circular 96-010 provides that “The agency 

official responsible for accepting deliveries of procured items shall, within twenty-

four (24) hours from such acceptance, notify the Audit of the time and date of the 

scheduled deliveries. Accordingly, the Circular enumerates the supporting 

documents necessary for the proper review of the procurement transactions. 

 

On the other hand, Appendix A, Annex “H” of the 2016 RIRR of RA No. 

9184 provides that that the  BAC, through its Secretariat, shall post the procurement 

opportunity [e.g., Request for Quotation (RFQ) or Request for Proposal (RFP) in the 

PhilGEPS website, the website of the PE concerned, if available, and at any 

conspicuous place reserved for this purpose in the premises of the PE for a period of 

at least three (3) calendar days for projects  involving Shopping for ordinary office 

supplies and equipment not available in DBM-PS with Approved Budget for the 

Contract (ABC) above ₱50,000.00. Annex “H” also provides that the BAC shall 

require from supplier/contractor the Mayor’s Permit and PhilGEPS Registration. 
 

Records showed that submission of 49 POs/JOs with corresponding amount 

of ₱7,485,158.24 were not made within the reglementary period, with delays ranging 

from six to 189 days. Details are as follows:

The delayed submission of the POs/JOs prevented the Audit Team from 

having a systematic and effective review of the documents with the end view of 

generating timely and relevant audit results. 

 

Further, notices of delivery were not furnished to the Audit Team within 24 

hours after acceptance of goods; thus, prevented the Audit Team from conducting 

timely inspections and ensuring correctness of the quantity delivered and in 

conformity with specifications in the approved PO.  

 

In addition, we noted that there were no proof of PhilGEPS or PE website 

posting, which is not in accordance with Section IV.G of Annex “H” that mandated 

all supplier/contractors doing business with the government to register with the 

PhilGEPS. 
 
This is a reiteration of previous audit observation embodied in the CY 2019 

Annual Audit Report (AAR) of FDCP. 
 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 

a. instruct the Property/Supply Officer to submit copies of 
POs/JOs/contracts and notices of deliveries and their supporting 
documents to COA within the period prescribed pursuant to COA 
Circular Nos. 2009-001 and 96-010; and  
 

b. require the concerned agency officials/personnel to strictly comply with 
the Revised IRR of RA 9184. 

 

 

Significant delays in submission of DVs  

 

11. Delayed submission of DVs including their supporting documents ranging from 
27 to 231 days, contrary to COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 

2009, hinder the timely audit and verification of transactions.  

 

Section 7.2.1(a) of COA Circular 2009-006 provides that the Chief 

Accountant, Bookkeeper or other authorized official performing accounting and/or 

bookkeeping functions of the audited agency shall ensure that the reports and 

supporting documents submitted by the accountable officers are immediately 

recorded in the books of accounts and submitted to the Auditor within the first ten 

days of the ensuing month. 

 

We have noted that there were delays in the submission of DVs and their 

supporting documents. The delays range from 27-231 days, as presented in the table 

on the next page.

The delay in the submission of the financial reports hinder the timely 

verification/audit of the same.  Likewise, the communication of audit results to 

management is consequently delayed.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Accountant: 

 

a. to submit all the DVs and its supporting documents as enumerated in the 
above table; and 

 

b. to impose the suspension of payment of salaries of personnel responsible 
for the undue delay or non-submission of the financial documents until

The following were noted in the audit of the above COVID-19-related 

expenses: 

 

1) The Audit Team conducted compliance audit on the FDCP Disaster/Emergency 
Assistance and Relief (DEAR) Program in the total amount of ₱28,000,000.00.  

The audit was conducted to ascertain compliance with FDCP Advisory Nos. 01 

to 05, series of 2020 on the implementation of DEAR Program and applicable 

COA rules and regulations. Deficiencies observed in the course of the audit 

were discussed in Observation no. 7 of this report. 

 

2) The FDCP paid for cash assistance for food and grocery allowance and health 
care assistance to its regular, contractual and COS/JOs personnel pursuant to 

Civil Service Commission (CSC) Memorandum No. 10, s. 2020. The Audit 

Team issued Notice of Disallowance Nos. 2020-001-101 and 2020-002-101, 

both dated March 8, 2021, in the amount of ₱400,000.00 and ₱476,896.87, 

respectively, because they contravened some of the existing government rules 

and regulations as defined in COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 

2012, COA Resolution No 2005-001 dated February 3, 2005 and Section 3 of 

Administrative Order 103, s. 2004. 

 



72 

 

 

COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012, provides for the 

updated guidelines for the prevention, and disallowance of Irregular, 

Unnecessary, Excessive, Extravagant and Unconscionable Expenditures.  

Annex “A” of the said Circular enumerates list of cases which are considered 

“Irregular” expenditures or uses of government funds, which included payment 

of food allowance, rice subsidy and health care insurance as there is no law 

authorizing the grant of such allowance. 

 

COA Resolution No. 2005-001 dated February 3, 2005 provides that the 

procurement of private health insurance by any agency or instrumentality of the 

government is an irregular expenditure and constitutes unnecessary use of 

public funds. 

 

Section 3 of Administrative Order (AO) 103, s. 2004, which directed 

NGAs, whether or not exempt from the Salary Standardization Law, to suspend 

the grant of new or additional benefits to officials and employees.  Under the 

same AO, no government entity is exempt from securing prior approval from 

the President granting additional benefits to its personnel. This is in conformity 

with the policy of standardization of compensation laid down in RA No. 6758. 

 

3) Disbursements for the grant of COVID-19 Hazard Pay to regular employees 
and other personnel amounting to ₱39,500.00 were supported with adequate 

documents that established the recipients’ qualifications and compliance with 

conditions set under the DBM Budget Circular No. 2020-1 dated March 24, 

2020. 

 

4) CAs for communication, gasoline and other supplies and materials totaling 
₱1,643,708.00 were audited and the deficiencies noted were part of the 

discussion in Observation No. 3 of this report.  

 

5) Procurement for COVID-19 supplies and materials amounting to ₱425,616.54 
were processed, approved and awarded to various suppliers/contractors and 

supported with complete documents as required under “Annex H” of the 2016 

RIRR of RA No. 9184 and COA Circular 2012-001.

Gender and Development (GAD) Plans and Programs 

 

14. The FDCP spent a total cost of ₱10,432,250.00 for its GAD related activities for 
CY 2020, which represents 3.36 percent of its total appropriations of 

₱265,068,000.00. 



73 

 

 

 

Section 31 of the General Provisions (GP) of 2020 General Appropriations 

Act (GAA) requires that: 

 

All agencies of the government shall formulate a GAD Plan 

designed to address gender issues within their concerned sectors or 

mandate and implement applicable provisions under R.A. 9170 or

Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the Beijing Platform for 

Action, the Millennium Development Goals (2000-2015), the 

Philippine Plan for Gender- Responsive Development, (1995-

2025), and the Philippine Development Plan. The GAD plan shall 

be integrated in the regular activities of the agencies, which shall be 

at least five percent (5%) of their   respective   budgets.   For   this   

purpose.   xxx activities that contribute to poverty alleviation, 

economic empowerment xxx are considered sufficient compliance 

with said requirement.  Utilization of the GAD budget shall be 

evaluated based on the GAD performance indicators identified by 

the said agency. 

 

The agency’s GAD Plan and Budget for CY 2020 and the actual cost to 

implement the major activities are shown below:

Programs and Projects related to Senior Citizens and Persons with Disability 

 

15. The FDCP featured films that were senior citizens and differently-abled person 
oriented; offered free movies, priority seats and free water; provided ramp for the 

use/mobility, safety and welfare of its clients from the said two sectors of the society, 

in compliance with Section 32 of the GP of 2020 GAA. 

 

Disaster Risk Reduction and Management, and Climate Change Adaptation 

 

16. For CY 2020, FDCP has installed fire extinguishers to all offices and maintained 
flood barriers for the Film Archive for protection of film elements in FDCP custody, 

in compliance with Section 36 of the GP of 2020 GAA.  

 

FDCP practices energy efficiency measures, including adoption of a standard 

thermostat level based on the Department of Energy’s Energy Conservation Program 

and the use of energy efficient lighting such as LED lamps in the office and common 

areas of the building, power off of all lighting and lighting fixture during lunch 

breaks, after office hours, and on weekends when without overtime work. Installation 

of Inverter Air-Conditioner Units and the regular check-up and Maintenance of 

existing Air-conditioning units. 

 

 

Compliance with Tax Laws 

 

17. Review of financial records showed that the FDCP was able to remit within the 
prescribed period all the taxes due for remittance. During the year, the total taxes 

withheld and remitted to the Bureau of Internal Revenue amounted to ₱6,363,378.98 

in compliance with DOF-DBM-COA Joint Circular No. 1-2000 and Presidential 

Memorandum Order 219. 

 

However, the Audit Team noted that the corresponding taxes for the payment 

of goods and services through cash advances amounting to more than ₱10,000.00 

were not withheld, contrary to Item II of RMO No. 23-2014; thus, deprived the 

government of the income that could be derived therefrom. 

 

Item II of RMO No. 23-2014 dated June 20, 2014 provides that all 

government offices are constituted as withholding agents for purposes of the 

creditable tax required to be withheld on the following: 

A. Withholding of Creditable Income Taxes - Income payments to its 
local/resident supplier of goods and services other than those covered by 

other rates of withholding tax. 

 

• Supplier of goods – One Percent 
• Supplier of Services – Two Percent 

 



75 

 

 

B. Withholding Tax on Government Money Payments 
 

• On purchases of goods and services from non-VAT registered 
suppliers/payees- Three Percent of the gross payments 

 

• Purchases of the government that are covered by POs duly signed 
by the authorized official/s as well as purchases using Petty Cash 

Fund shall be subject to the five percent final VAT withholding. 

 

Review of the disbursements out of special cash advances disclosed payments 

to suppliers of good and services totaling ₱1,453,377.40 were not subjected to 

withholding tax contrary to the above-cited revenue regulations. Details are as
