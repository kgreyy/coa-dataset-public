EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

 

A. Introduction 
 

The Film Development Council of the Philippines (FDCP) was created by 

Republic Act (RA) 9167, “An Act Creating the Film Development Council of the 

Philippines, Defining its Powers and Functions, Appropriating Funds Therefore, 

and for Other Purposes”, which was approved by the 12th Congress on June 7, 2002. 

The FDCP is under the Office of the President of the Philippines. The creation of 

the FDCP is pursuant to the constitutional guarantee on freedom of expression by 

which the State, as a policy, recognizes the need to promote and support the 

development and growth of the local film industry as a medium for the upliftment 

of aesthetic, cultural and social values for the better understanding and appreciation 

of the Filipino identity. RA 9167 abolished the Film Development Foundation of 

the Philippines, Inc. [FDFPI] and the Film Ratings Board [FRB] and transferred all 

their books, assets, rights, privileges, records, obligations and liabilities to the 

FDCP.  

 

On April 17, 2012, Administrative Order (AO) No. 26 was issued directing 

all departments, agencies and offices of the National Government, including 

government-owned or controlled corporations to turn-over their existing original 

copies of films and other audiovisual negatives, prints, or digital files, including but 

not limited to movie films, documentaries and animation to the FDCP-National Film 

Archive of the Philippines (NFAP) for care, preservation and reconstruction. 

 

FDCP is presently headed by Ms. Mary Liza B. Diño as Chairperson and 

assisted by an Executive Director and 10 operating units.  As of December 31, 2020, 

the manpower complement totaled 97, of which 16 were on permanent status, 72 

were under contract of service, and 9 were other personnel including consultants 

and security personnel.

D. Scope of Audit 
 

The audit was conducted to: a) ascertain the level of assurance that may be 

placed on the Management’s assertion on the financial statements; b) determine the 

propriety of transactions as well as extent of compliance on the applicable laws, 



iv 

 

rules and regulations; c) recommend agency improvement opportunities; and d) 

determine the extent of implementation of prior year’s audit recommendations. 

Moreover, the audit was conducted in accordance with the International Standards 

of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAIs). 

 

  

E. Independent Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements 
 

The auditor rendered a Qualified opinion on the fairness of the presentation 

of the Financial Statements of FDCP as at December 31, 2020 due to the following 

observations: 
 

1. The erroneous recording of transactions pertaining to the receipt and transfer 
of funds from Singapore Film Council and Finas of Malaysia for the Cannes 

International Film Festival resulted in the overstatement of ₱10,310,863.98 

and understatement of ₱7,207,841.98 of various accounts affecting the fair 

presentation of the financial statements, contrary to Section 15, Chapter 2, 

Volume I of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM). (Paragraph No. 1) 

 

2. Expenditures of ₱2,459,500.00 out of the liquidated cash advance of 
₱2,763,594.00 were not recorded in the books, resulting in understatement of 

the affected expenses accounts. Moreover, no liquidation reports were 

submitted to the Audit Team to validate the propriety and regularity of the 

cash advance utilization. (Paragraph No. 4) 

 

3. Financial Assistance/Grants released to production companies and 
organizations amounting to ₱11,626,000.00 were recorded as expenses under 

Subsidies-Others account instead of Due from NGOs/CSOs or Other 

Receivables as provided in Paragraph 17 of the International Public Sector 

Accounting Standards (IPSAS) 23, resulting in the overstatement of expenses 

and understatement of receivables by the same amount. (Paragraph No. 6) 
 

F. Significant Observations and Recommendations 
 

The following are the other significant audit observations and corresponding 

recommendations, which were discussed with Management officials concerned 

during the exit conference on April 6, 2021, details of which are further discussed 

in the Part II of this report. Management views and comments were incorporated in 

the report, where appropriate. 

 

1. The aging schedule of FDCP’s receivables disclosed non-moving and/or 
dormant accounts for more than ten years totaling ₱77,984,920.04 due (a) non-

remittance by movie-houses and (b) LGUs of amusement taxes totaling 

₱3,133,577.13 and ₱55,393,426.17, respectively; (c) non-payment by film-

makers of the loan-assistance granted to them amounting to ₱18,127,158.09; 



v 

 

and (d) various uncollected receivables totaling ₱1,330,778.65, which resulted 

in the uncertainty/unreliability of the balance of FDCP’s receivables.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to:  

a. examine other courses of action that maximize effort on the possible 
recovery of the dormant receivables and/or coordinate with the OSG to 

execute legal remedies; 

 

b. direct the Administrative and Finance Division to: 
i. intensify effort to locate and furnish the Audit Team the 

MOAs/Undertakings and all supporting documents, and pertinent 

records relevant to these receivables; and 

ii. pursue collection; 
 

c. if other remedies proved futile, request from COA for authority to write-
off dormant accounts in accordance with COA Circular No. 2016-005; 

and 

 

d. instruct the Accountant to: 
i. prepare AJE to correct the understatement of the Accounts 

Receivable account in the amount of ₱99,367.62; and 

ii. provide for Impairment Loss for the account Due from LGUs. 
 

2. Various deficiencies, contrary to the provisions of COA Circular No. 97-002, 
were committed, such as (a) non-liquidation of CAs at the end of the year and  

the grant of additional CAs to Special Disbursing Officers (SDOs) with still 

unliquidated CAs resulting in its accumulation to ₱28,266,039.04 at year-end; 

(b) the transfer of the SDO’s CA to another personnel; (c) the grant of CAs to 

non-permanent/co-terminus employees; and (d) the use of CAs to purchase 

goods and services that can be acquired in regular procurement process; thus, 

making the CA susceptible to loss or misuse or theft, and the possibility of 

misplaced or lost supporting documents due to prolonged settlement.  

 

We recommended Management to: 

a. instruct the SDOs to liquidate their CAs within the prescribed period and 
at the end of the year to ensure proper recording of all expenses in the 

year they are incurred; and 

 

b. direct the Accountant and all concerned officials to strictly enforce the 
provisions of COA Circular No. 97-002, RA No. 9184, and the PD No. 

1445 pertaining to the grant, utilization and liquidation of cash advances. 

 

3. The mode for disposal for the unserviceable PPEs of the agency totaling 
₱1,798,226.22 have been decided by the Disposal Committee and approved 

by the head of the agency, however, as of December 31, 2020, these 



vi 

 

unserviceable PPEs have not been disposed yet, and no Inventory and 

Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) was prepared, contrary 

to Section 40 (d), Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the: 

a. The Property Officer to prepare the corresponding IIRUP for all 
unserviceable PPEs; 

 

b. Accountant to prepare the necessary adjusting entries to recognize 
impairment loss of the unserviceable PPEs upon receipt of the IIRUP, in 

accordance with Section 40(d), Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM; and 

 

c. Disposal Committee to cause the immediate disposal of the 
unserviceable properties to avoid further deterioration and to generate 

additional income from their disposal. 

 

4. The legality, validity and accuracy of the payments aggregating 
₱25,040,013.91 for the salaries of COS personnel for the period January 2020 

to December 2020 could not be ascertained due to non-submission of the 

documentary requirements such as Daily Time Records (DTRs), Contracts of 

Service and Accomplishment Reports (ARs), as required under Section 4(6) 

of PD No. 1445 and COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012. 
 

We recommended and Management agreed to submit the documentary 

requirements for the payments of salaries of COS employees and the 

Certificate of Service Rendered for the professional fees paid to talents, artists, 

crews and other professionals. 

 

G. Implementation of Prior Year’s Audit Recommendation 
 

Of the 17 prior year’s audit recommendations contained in the CY 2019 

Annual Audit Report (AAR), nine were implemented and eight were not 

implemented.  The details are presented in Part III of this report.
