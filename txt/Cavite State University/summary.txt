liability accounts and prevent incurrence of the same accounting error in the succeeding 
years. 
 

2. The balance of Cash Collecting Officer (CCO) account of P790,626.13 presented in the 
Statement of Financial Position as of December 31, 2020 of the Main Campus is 
unreliable due to:  (a) significant variance of P733,796.07 between the Cashier’s Cash 
Receipts Record and Statement of Financial Position;  (b) the existence of negative 
CCO balances of (P2,118,340.83) and (P42,790.67) on Fund 163 and Fund 164, 
respectively;  (c) non-disclosure of information on the actual condition of the account in 
the Notes to Financial Statements; and (d) non-maintenance of Subsidiary Ledger.  This 
is contrary to Item 6.3 of Commission on Audit (COA) Circular No. 90-331, Section 15, 
Chapter 1, and Item f, Section 6, Chapter 19 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, and 
Section 12, Chapter 2 of the same Manual.  

 
We recommended that the University President instruct the: (a) Accountant and the 
Cashier to prioritize the reconciliation of Cash Collecting Officer account balance to 
ensure the correctness and completeness of the recorded entries/transactions; (b) 
Accountant to fully disclose the information on the Cash Collecting Officer account 
based on the actual condition of the fund to assist users in understanding the financial 
statements; and (c) Accountant to maintain separate Subsidiary Ledger for all the 
controlling accounts in the General Ledger particularly the Cash Collecting Officer 
account. 

 
3. The reported total Cash in Bank - Local Currency balance of P1,346,135,458.37 as of 

December 31, 2020, of the Main Campus is unreliable due to: (a) non-
preparation/submission of CY 2020 Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS) for 21 bank 
accounts; (b) incomplete and unreconciled Subsidiary Ledgers and schedules for Cash 
in Bank accounts; and (c) significant variance in the reported balances per bank 
confirmation and Cashier’s Check Disbursement Records (CkDR) as compared with 
accounting records.  This is contrary to Sections 3, 5 and 7 of Chapter 21 and Section 
12, Chapter 2 of GAM, Volume I and Appendix 6 of GAM, Volume II, both for NGAs. 

 
We recommended that the University President direct the: (a) Accountant to expedite the 
preparation of the Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRSs) for the 19 bank accounts 
under Local Currency-Current Account of Main Campus and submit the said BRSs to the 
Audit Team, together with the copies of bank statements, debit or credit memos and 
other relevant documents, so that reconciling items could be determined and analyzed to 
establish the accuracy and reliability of the reported cash balances in the financial 
statements, in compliance with Sections 3, 5 and 7 of Chapter 21 of GAM for NGAs, 
Volume I; (b) Accountant to continuously update the schedules/Subsidiary Ledgers (SLs) 
of cash in bank accounts following the format prescribed in Appendix 6 of GAM for 
NGAs, Volume II, and reconcile the SLs with the General Ledger balance; (c) Cashier to 
immediately prepare the reconciliation of CkDR of savings account under Fund 163, in 
order to arrive at an amount equal to the book and bank balances; (d) Accountant and 
Cashier to religiously conduct monthly reconciliation of the Cash in Bank balance to 
ensure the correctness and completeness of the recorded entries/transactions; and     
(e) Director for Finance Management Office to closely monitor the preparation and 
submission of BRSs to the Audit Team, including the regular reconciliation of records by 
the Accountant and the Cashier, and submit to the Office of the Audit Team the periodic 
report on the status of BRS preparation. 
 



4. The reported Due from NGAs account totaling P437,209,507.45, includes amount 
collectible from Commission on Higher Education (CHED) for the implementation of 
Republic Act (RA) No. 10931 or the Free Higher Education Act amounting to 
P430,403,492.50. This collectible should have been recorded under Accounts 
Receivable-CHED contrary to Chapter 3 of GAM for NGAs, Volume III. 

 
We recommended that the University President instruct the Accountant to prepare the 
necessary journal entry to correct the error made in recording the abovementioned 
receivable, and to ensure proper recognition of assets and income to properly present 
reliable account conditions in the financial statements. 

 
5. The collectability of CvSU’s receivables account aggregating P10,960,605.03, which 

have been non-moving for eight to 12 years, could not be ascertained due to absence of 
records from which the debtors could be identified, thereby affecting the validity of 
Receivables account as reported in the financial statements, contrary to COA Circular 
No. 2016-005 and Section 12, Chapter 2 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I.  This is also 
detrimental to the government given the remote chance of collection from unidentified 
debtors. 

 
We recommended that the University President and Campus Administrators direct the 
Accountants of Main, Naic and Rosario Campuses to: (a) maximize efforts to identify the 
debtors comprising the balances of Loans Receivable and Other Receivable accounts 
totaling P9,408,105.03 through formal inquiry with the Office of Student Affairs (OSA), 
and if possible, seek the assistance from the Commission on Higher Education Regional 
Office (CHED-RO) for possible identification of student-borrower; (b) issue the 
corresponding Billing Statement to enforce collection of P1,500,000.00; and (c) maintain 
Subsidiary Ledgers for all controlling accounts in the General Ledger, compliant with the 
format prescribed in Section 12(b), Chapter 2 of GAM, Volume I and Appendices 5 and 6 
of GAM, Volume II, both for NGAs. 

 
6. The balance of Inventories totaling P18,304,785.19 of CvSU-Rosario Campus is 

unreliable due to inclusion of slow/non-moving accounts aggregating P15,088,231.61, 
which were still taken up as assets as of December 31, 2020. The non-recognition as an 
expense on the proper period is contrary to the guidelines and procedures prescribed 
under Section 7, Chapter 8 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I, thus resulting in the 
overstatement of inventory and government equity accounts by P15,088,231.61. 

 
We recommended that the Campus Administrator of Rosario Campus to: (a) instruct the 
Officer-in-Charge (OIC) for External and Business Affairs (EBA) Office to submit the 
sales report for merchandise sold in the previous years to the Accountant, for proper 
adjustment of the Merchandise Inventory account; (b) direct the OIC for Supply Office to 
prepare the Report of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI) on the aforementioned 
consumable inventory accounts, which were issued in prior years, and submit the same 
to the Accountant for proper adjustment in the books of accounts; and (c) direct the 
Accountant to take up the adjusting journal entry/ies on the subject Inventory accounts 
based on the submitted RSMI and sales report to correct the reported balances, and 
observe strictly the proper recognition of expense as prescribed under Section 7, 
Chapter 8 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I. 

 
 



7. The reported Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) net of Construction in Progress (CIP) 
of the CvSU with a total acquisition cost of P1,731,511,063.85 is unreliable due to:  (a) 
significant variance of P89,568,854.71 between the amount recorded per books as 
against the Report on the Physical Count of PPE (RPCPPE); (b) continuous non-
reconciliation of records by the Accounting and Property Offices, including current year 
acquisitions; and (c) the reported PPE per financial statements and RPCPPE are not 
supported with updated PPE Ledger Card (PPELC) and Property Card (PC), 
respectively. Also, issued semi-expendable properties acquired in prior years still formed 
part of the PPE balance as of year-end, contrary to Sections 10 and 18.e, Chapter 8 of 
GAM for NGAs, Volume I and COA Circular No. 2005-002. 

 
We recommended that the University President and the Campus Administrators of Naic 
and Rosario Campuses to: (a) create an Inventory Committee composed of both 
Accounting and Property personnel to work on the unreconciled difference of 
P89,568,854.71 between the accounting records and the RPCPPE; (b) direct both the 
Accounting and Property Offices to: (i) continuously update the required PPE Ledger 
Cards and Property Cards to facilitate reconciliation of records; and (ii) submit to the 
Office of the University President/Campus Administrator the quarterly report on the 
status of their reconciliation to gradually reconcile pertinent accounting and property 
records, and thus avoid the accumulation of significant amount of discrepancies, in 
compliance with Section 42, Chapter 10 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I; (c) direct the 
Accountants to drop from the books of accounts, all issued semi-expendable properties 
acquired in previous years, in the PPE accounts; and (d) instruct the Directors for 
Finance Management Office (FMO)/Administration and Finance Services to monitor the 
maintenance and continuous updating of PPE Ledger Cards and Property Cards, 
including the quarterly/periodic reconciliation of both records, in accordance with the 
aforementioned provisions of GAM for NGAs, Volume I. 

 
8. The undelivered goods and unfinished projects of Naic and Rosario Campuses as of 

year-end amounting to P1,732,293.30 and P2,033,186.25 were recorded as outright 
expense and assets under the Inventory and PPE accounts, respectively and the 
corresponding liability were recognized in the books, contrary to Sections 2.a, 15 and 44, 
Chapters 6, 8 and 10 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I. This practice resulted in the 
overstatement of the affected asset, expense and liability accounts by the same amount. 

 
We recommended that the Campus Administrators of Naic and Rosario Campuses 
direct the Accountants to: (a) prepare the necessary adjusting journal entry/ies on the 
affected accounts; (b) record the corresponding liability account as soon as the 
item/project is delivered and accepted based on approved Purchase Orders/Contracts, 
Inspection and Acceptance Reports and Delivery Receipts, in compliance with Sections 
2.a, 15 and 43, Chapters 6, 8 and 10, respectively, of GAM for NGAs, Volume I; and (c) 
stop the practice of recording expenses for goods/services/projects which are yet to be 
delivered/rendered/completed, consistent with accounting rules and regulations 
prescribed in the same Manual. 

 
The audit observations, together with the recommended courses of action, were discussed 
by the Audit Team with the concerned Management officials and staff during the exit 
conference conducted on May 10, 2021. Management’s comments were incorporated in the 
Report, where appropriate.

respectively;  (c) non-disclosure of information on the actual condition of the account in 
the Notes to Financial Statements; and (d) non-maintenance of Subsidiary Ledger.  This 
is contrary to Item 6.3 of Commission on Audit (COA) Circular No. 90-331, Section 15, 
Chapter 1, and Item f, Section 6, Chapter 19 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, and 
Section 12, Chapter 2 of the same Manual.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
 
The Cavite State University (CvSU) in Indang, Cavite was established as a pioneer 
intermediate school by the American Thomasites in 1906.  It became the Don Severino 
Agricultural College (DSAC) in 1964 under Republic Act (RA) No. 3917, creating it as a state 
agricultural college.  On January 22, 1998, it was converted into a state university by virtue 
of RA No. 8468 and is now known as Cavite State University. 
 
The CvSU is tasked primarily to provide advance instruction and professional training in 
agriculture, science and technology, education and other related fields, undertake research 
and extension services, and provide progressive leadership in these areas. Its avowed 
mission is to provide excellent, equitable and relevant educational opportunities in the arts, 
sciences and technology through quality instruction and responsive research and 
development activities. It shall produce professional, skilled and morally upright individuals 
for global competitiveness. 
 
The Management System of the CvSU has been assessed by AJA Registrars and is ISO 
9001:2015 certified with original registration date on December 4, 2018. With this 
certification, the CvSU can now make its services accessible, convenient and pleasant to

and managed by the CvSU. A total of P616,574,823.11 was utilized as of the end of the 
year. 
   
 
AUDIT OPINION ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
The Auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of the presentation of the 
consolidated financial statements of the CvSU due to the following: 

 
1. Fifteen (15) asset and two liability accounts of Main Campus posted abnormal balances 

totaling P152,200,377.90 and P930,888.97, respectively, as of December 31, 2020. This 
significantly affects the accuracy and reliability of financial information presented in the 
financial statements, contrary to Section 15, Chapter 1 and Sections 6.f and 7, Chapter 
19 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies 
(NGAs), Volume I. 
 

2. The balance of Cash Collecting Officer (CCO) account of P790,626.13 presented in the 
Statement of Financial Position as of December 31, 2020 of the Main Campus is 
unreliable due to:  (a) significant variance of P733,796.07 between the Cashier’s Cash 
Receipts Record and Statement of Financial Position; (b) the existence of negative CCO 
balances of (P2,118,340.83) and (P42,790.67) on Fund 163 and Fund 164, respectively;  
(c) non-disclosure of information on the actual condition of the account in the Notes to 
Financial Statements; and (d) non-maintenance of Subsidiary Ledger.  This is contrary to 
Item 6.3 of Commission on Audit (COA) Circular No. 90-331, Section 15, Chapter 1, and 
Item f, Section 6, Chapter 19 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, and Section 12, Chapter 2 
of the same Manual.  
 

3. The reported total Cash in Bank - Local Currency balance of P1,346,135,458.37 as of 
December 31, 2020, of the Main Campus is unreliable due to: (a) non-
preparation/submission of CY 2020 Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS) for 21 bank 
accounts; (b) incomplete and unreconciled Subsidiary Ledgers and schedules for Cash in 
Bank accounts; and (c) significant variance in the reported balances per bank 
confirmation and Cashier’s Check Disbursement Records (CkDR) as compared with 
accounting records.  This is contrary to Sections 3, 5 and 7 of Chapter 21 and Section 12, 
Chapter 2 of GAM, Volume I and Appendix 6 of GAM, Volume II, both for NGAs. 
 

4. The reported Due from NGAs account totaling P437,209,507.45, includes amount 
collectible from Commission on Higher Education (CHED) for the implementation of 
Republic Act (RA) No. 10931 or the Free Higher Education Act amounting to 
P430,403,492.50. This collectible should have been recorded under Accounts 
Receivable-CHED contrary to Chapter 3 of GAM for NGAs, Volume III. 
 

5. The collectability of CvSU’s receivables account aggregating P10,960,605.03, which 
have been non-moving for eight to 12 years, could not be ascertained due to absence of 
records from which the debtors could be identified, thereby affecting the validity of 
Receivables account as reported in the financial statements, contrary to COA Circular 
No. 2016-005 and Section 12, Chapter 2 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I.  This is also 
detrimental to the government given the remote chance of collection from unidentified 
debtors. 
 



iv 

 

6. The balance of Inventories totaling P18,304,785.19 of CvSU-Rosario Campus is 
unreliable due to inclusion of slow/non-moving accounts aggregating P15,088,231.61, 
which were still taken up as assets as of December 31, 2020. The non-recognition as an 
expense on the proper period is contrary to the guidelines and procedures prescribed 
under Sections 7, Chapter 8 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I, thus resulting in the 
overstatement of inventory and government equity accounts by P15,088,231.61. 
 

7. The reported Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) net of Construction in Progress (CIP) 
of the CvSU with a total acquisition cost of P1,731,511,063.85 is unreliable due to:  (a) 
significant variance of P89,568,854.71 between the amount recorded per books as 
against the Report on the Physical Count of PPE (RPCPPE); (b) continuous non-
reconciliation of records by the Accounting and Property Offices, including current year 
acquisitions; and (c) the reported PPE per financial statements and RPCPPE are not 
supported with updated PPE Ledger Card (PPELC) and Property Card (PC), respectively. 
Also, issued semi-expendable properties acquired in prior years still formed part of the 
PPE balance as of year-end, contrary to Sections 10 and 18.e, Chapter 8 of GAM for 
NGAs, Volume I and COA Circular No. 2005-002. 

 
8. The undelivered goods and unfinished projects of Naic and Rosario Campuses as of 

year-end amounting to P1,732,293.30 and P2,033,186.25 were recorded as outright 
expense and assets under the Inventory and PPE accounts, respectively and the 
corresponding liability were recognized in the books, contrary to Sections 2.a, 15 and 44, 
Chapters 6, 8 and 10 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I. This practice resulted in the 
overstatement of the affected asset, expense and liability accounts by the same amount. 

 
The reliability and validity of these accounts were affected due to the prevailing conditions 
and deficiencies. 

 

 
SIGNIFICANT OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS   

 
For the exceptions enumerated in the preceding pages, the Auditor recommended the 
following courses of action: 

 
1. The University President direct the Accountant to prioritize the reconciliation of the 

accounts, particularly for those with significant abnormal/negative balances, and 
thereafter, prepare the necessary adjusting journal entry/ies to achieve the fair 
presentation of accounts in the financial statements. Likewise, maintain Subsidiary 
Ledger to address the current abnormal balances of pertinent assets and liability 
accounts and prevent incurrence of the same accounting error in the succeeding years. 

 
2. The University President instruct the: (a) Accountant and the Cashier to prioritize the 

reconciliation of Cash Collecting Officer account balance to ensure the correctness and 
completeness of the recorded entries/transactions; (b) Accountant to fully disclose the 
information on the Cash Collecting Officer account based on the actual condition of the 
fund to assist users in understanding the financial statements; and (c) Accountant to 
maintain separate Subsidiary Ledger for all the controlling accounts in the General 
Ledger particularly the Cash Collecting Officer account. 

 



v 

 

3. The University President direct the: (a) Accountant to expedite the preparation of the 
Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRSs) for the 19 bank accounts under Local Currency-
Current Account of Main Campus and submit the said BRSs to the Audit Team, together 
with the copies of bank statements, debit or credit memos and other relevant 
documents, so that reconciling items could be determined and analyzed to establish the 
accuracy and reliability of the reported cash balances in the financial statements, in 
compliance with Sections 3, 5 and 7 of Chapter 21 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I;           
(b) Accountant to continuously update the schedules/Subsidiary Ledgers (SLs) of cash 
in bank accounts following the format prescribed in Appendix 6 of GAM for NGAs, 
Volume II, and reconcile the SLs with the General Ledger balance; (c) Cashier to 
immediately prepare the reconciliation of CkDR of savings account under Fund 163, in 
order to arrive at an amount equal to the book and bank balances; (d) Accountant and 
Cashier to religiously conduct monthly reconciliation of the Cash in Bank balance to 
ensure the correctness and completeness of the recorded entries/transactions; and     
(e) Director for Finance Management Office to closely monitor the preparation and 
submission of BRSs to the Audit Team, including the regular reconciliation of records by 
the Accountant and the Cashier, and submit to the Office of the Audit Team the periodic 
report on the status of BRS preparation. 

 
4. The University President instruct the Accountant to prepare the necessary journal entry 

to correct the error made in recording the abovementioned receivable, and to ensure 
proper recognition of assets and income to properly present reliable account conditions 
in the financial statements. 
 

5. The University President and Campus Administrators direct the Accountants of Main, 
Naic and Rosario Campuses to: (a) maximize efforts to identify the debtors comprising 
the balances of Loans Receivable and Other Receivable accounts totaling 
P9,408,105.03 through formal inquiry with the Office of Student Affairs (OSA), and if 
possible, seek the assistance from the Commission on Higher Education Regional Office 
(CHED-RO) for possible identification of student-borrower; (b) issue the corresponding 
Billing Statement to enforce collection of P1,500,000.00; and (c) maintain Subsidiary 
Ledgers for all controlling accounts in the General Ledger, compliant with the format 
prescribed in Section 12(b), Chapter 2 of GAM, Volume I and Appendices 5 and 6 of 
GAM, Volume II, both for NGAs. 
 

6. The Campus Administrator of Rosario Campus to: (a) instruct the Officer-in-Charge 
(OIC) for External and Business Affairs (EBA) Office to submit the sales report for 
merchandise sold in the previous years to the Accountant, for proper adjustment of the 
Merchandise Inventory account; (b) direct the OIC for Supply Office to prepare the 
Report of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI) on the aforementioned consumable 
inventory accounts, which were issued in prior years, and submit the same to the 
Accountant for proper adjustment in the books of accounts; and (c) direct the Accountant 
to take up the adjusting journal entry/ies on the subject Inventory accounts based on the 
submitted RSMI and sales report to correct the reported balances, and observe strictly 
the proper recognition of expense as prescribed under Section 7, Chapter 8 of GAM for 
NGAs, Volume I. 
 

7. The University President and the Campus Administrators of Naic and Rosario 
Campuses to: (a) create an Inventory Committee composed of both Accounting and 
Property personnel to work on the unreconciled difference of P89,568,854.71 between 
the accounting records and the RPCPPE; (b) direct both the Accounting and Property 



vi 

 

Offices to: (i) continuously update the required PPE Ledger Cards and Property Cards to 
facilitate reconciliation of records; and (ii) submit to the Office of the University 
President/Campus Administrator the quarterly report on the status of their reconciliation 
to gradually reconcile pertinent accounting and property records, and thus avoid the 
accumulation of significant amount of discrepancies, in compliance with Section 42, 
Chapter 10 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I; (c) direct the Accountants to drop from the 
books of accounts, all issued semi-expendable properties acquired in previous years, in 
the PPE accounts; and (d) instruct the Directors for Finance Management Office 
(FMO)/Administration and Finance Services to monitor the maintenance and continuous 
updating of PPE Ledger Cards and Property Cards, including the quarterly/periodic 
reconciliation of both records, in accordance with the aforementioned provisions of GAM 
for NGAs, Volume I. 
 

8. The Campus Administrators of Naic and Rosario Campuses direct the Accountants to: 
(a) prepare the necessary adjusting journal entry/ies on the affected accounts; (b) record 
the corresponding liability account as soon as the item/project is delivered and accepted 
based on approved Purchase Orders/Contracts, Inspection and Acceptance Reports and 
Delivery Receipts, in compliance with Sections 2.a, 15 and 43, Chapters 6, 8 and 10, 
respectively, of GAM for NGAs, Volume I; and (c) stop the practice of recording 
expenses for goods/services/projects which are yet to be delivered/rendered/completed, 
consistent with accounting rules and regulations prescribed in the same Manual. 

 

 
The following are the other significant observations and recommendations: 

 
1. General claims thru Automated Teller Machine (ATM) for salaries, allowances and other 

forms of compensation totaling P145,225,773.45, were unsupported with Payroll 
Registers and Letter to the Bank to credit employees’ account of their claims, contrary to 
Items 4.2, 5.2, 5.3 and 5.11 of COA Circular No. 2012-001. This prevented the Audit 
Team to verify the propriety and correctness of actual amounts credited to the 
employees’ account. Moreover, there was no evidence that the said claims were actually 
received by the concerned employees. 

 
We recommended that the University President instruct the Accountant to submit to the 
Audit Team the Payroll Registers (hard and soft copy) and Letter/s to the Bank to credit 
employees’ account of their salaries, or other claims on the subject disbursements for 
post-audit purposes. Moreover, direct the Accountant to strictly observe the required 
documentation in the processing of employees’ general claims for salaries, allowances 
and other forms of compensation as prescribed in COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated 
June 14, 2012. 

 
2. Purchases of materials and payment of internet and other operating expenses of CvSU-

Rosario Campus totaling P171,803.00 were made thru cash advances (CAs) to the 
Special Disbursing Officer when the same can be paid through checks. This practice 
resulted in: (a) granting of additional CAs despite non-liquidation of previous CAs given 
to him; (b) transferring of CAs to another Accountable Officer; and (c) non-liquidation of 
special CAs within 20 days from accomplishment of the purpose, in violation of Items 
4.1.2, 4.1.6 and 4.3.2 of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997, and Item 
1.0 of COA Circular No. 2012-004 dated November 28, 2012. Likewise, the mode of 



vii 

 

procurement made was not in accordance with Sections 53.2 and 53.9 of the 2016 
Revised Implementing Rules and Regulation (RIRR) of Republic Act (RA) No. 9184. 

 
We recommended that the Campus Administrator of Rosario Campus: 

 
a. stop the practice of: (a) allowing the grant of special CAs under his name on account 

of purchases of materials, and payment of internet and other operating expenses, 
which can be paid through checks; (b) granting of additional CAs despite non-
liquidation of previous CAs; and (c) transferring of CAs to another Accountable 
Officer, in compliance with the rules and regulations on the granting and utilization of 
CAs as prescribed under Items 4.1.2, 4.1.6 and 4.3.2 of COA Circular No. 97-002 
dated February 10, 1997.  

  
b. liquidate his CAs within 20 days from accomplishment of the purpose as required 

under Item 1.0 of COA Circular No. 2012-004 dated November 28, 2012; and 
  
c. direct the Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) to strictly comply with the procurement 

procedures in the procurement of goods. As a general rule, all procurement should 
be subjected to public bidding, except for those allowed to be undertaken through 
alternative mode, as recommended by the BAC, pursuant to 2016 RIRR of RA No. 
9184. 

 
3. Fund transfers to Cooperating State Universities and Colleges (SUCs) totaling 

P6,434,000.70, which have been outstanding for more than two years, remained 
unliquidated as of year-end due to the inability of the concerned Cooperating Agencies 
to liquidate and submit the Financial/Terminal Reports, contrary to the provisions stated 
in the Memoranda of Agreement (MOA) and Section 5.4 of COA Circular No. 94-013. 
This also affects the reliability of Due from NGAs account as reported in the financial 
statements.  

 
We recommended that the University President direct the Vice President (VP) for 
Research and Extension and the concerned Project Leaders to:  

 
a. send follow-up letters to enforce submission of financial/liquidation reports by the 

concerned cooperating agencies, as well as the terminal reports of the projects, 
and/or require refund of the unused funds, if there are any, copy furnished the 
funding agency, for monitoring purposes;  

 
b. request the funding agency to directly release subsequent fund transfers to 

cooperating agencies, to mitigate the burden caused by non-liquidation of funds by 
the latter, which ultimately affects the CvSU’s ability to liquidate to the funding 
agency; and 

 
c. adopt an effective scheme to monitor strict compliance by the cooperating agencies 

with their obligations as stated in the MOA. 

 
4. The CvSU Research Grant given to the CvSU faculty researchers on separate tranches 

lack sufficient guidelines on the granting, utilization and liquidation of the funds, thus 
preventing the audit and verification of project results/outputs.  Moreover, the grant given 
to 26 officials and employees totaling P2,639,688.50 representing research grants were 



viii 

 

improperly recorded as outright expenses, instead of receivables from the researchers, 
contrary to Chapter 3 of GAM for NGAs, Volume III. 

 
We recommended that the University President: 

 
a. instruct the Office of the Vice-President for Research and Extension to be keen in the 

monitoring and approval of grants to researchers, and to set out sufficient guidelines 
on the granting, utilization and liquidation of the funds; and, 
 

b. direct the Accountant to reclassify the entries made on the disbursed funds, and to 
properly account them to either current or non-current receivables, consistent with 
Chapter 3 of GAM for NGAs, Volume III. 

 
5. The Accountant did not maintain SLs for the controlling accounts in the General Ledger 

(GL), contrary to Section 12, Chapter 2 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I, Appendix 6 of the 
same Manual, Volume II, and Sections 111 and 121 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 
1445, known as the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines.  Thus, check and 
balance of the accounts in the financial statements could not be easily ascertained. 

 
We recommended that the University President instruct the Accountant to maintain 
separate SLs for all controlling accounts in the GL, pursuant to Section 12, Chapter 2 of 
GAM for NGAs, Volume I, and Appendix 6 of the same Manual, Volume II, and the 
pertinent provisions of PD No. 1445.  

 
6. Management of CvSU-Rosario Campus did not impose liquidated damages on late 

deliveries of supplies, equipment and other materials totaling P1,053,407.00 with delays 
ranging from seven to 154 days. This is contrary to Item 3, Annex D of the 2016 RIRR of 
RA No. 9184, which is manifestly disadvantageous to the government. 

 
We recommended that the Campus Administrator of Rosario Campus direct the 
concerned officers/employees to: (a) compute the corresponding liquidated damages on 
the subject purchases, and deduct the amount from any money due or which may 
become due to the suppliers; and (b) strictly monitor the delivery of goods by the 
suppliers within the specified delivery schedule as indicated in the approved 
contract/purchase orders, in case of default, impose liquidated damages in accordance 
with Item 3, Annex D of the 2016 Revised IRR of RA No. 9184. 

 
7. Donations of three-layer washable face masks sourced from internally funded COVID-19 

response project of the CvSU-Rosario Campus were not supported with report of 
inventory, and were not properly accounted for, contrary to Item II, 1.a.2 of COA Circular 
No. 2020-009 and Sections 3 and 7, Chapter 8 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I. 
Consequently, understating the Inventory Account on the amount of the undistributed 
masks. Furthermore, the sale of 3,000 pieces face masks funded under Fund 164 
(Special Trust Fund) was done by the Research and Extension Office, despite the 
absence of such undertaking per approved project proposal, contrary to Item v.1, 
Section 3 of CHED Memorandum Order (MO) No. 20, s. 2011 and Section 4.g of the 
CvSU Manual of Operations. 

 

 

 



ix 

 

We recommended that the Campus Administrator of Rosario Campus:  
 

a. instruct the Proponents of COVID-19 response project to submit the distribution 
report, sales report and inventory report as of December 31, 2020, to the Accountant 
for proper adjustment of the Inventory account;  

  
b. direct the Accountant to take up the adjusting journal entry/ies on the subject 

Inventory accounts on the basis of the reports submitted, to correct the reported 
balances, and observe strictly the proper recognition of expense as prescribed under 
Sections 3 and 7, Chapter 8 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I; and 

  
c. instruct the Director of Research and Extension Office to refrain from marketing 

Income Generating Projects (IGPs), which are not the directives of his good Office 
and are mandated under the Office of the Business Affairs (OBA). The OBA is the 
appropriate unit which undertakes the management of the IGPs. 

 
8. The Gender and Development (GAD) Resource Center of the CvSU did not comply with 

the mandatory requirement of allocating at least  five percent of the total appropriation 
for GAD programs, projects and activities (PAPs) in CY 2020, contrary to Philippine 
Commission on Women (PCW)-National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA)- 
Department of Budget and Management (DBM) Joint Circular (JC) No. 2012-01, thus the 
deficiency of allocation on the budgetary requirements of the GAD programs may 
prevent the CvSU in implementing major programs and activities that addresses gender 
issues, and pursues women’s empowerment and gender equality within the 
organization. 

 
We recommended that the University President: 

 
a. require the GAD Resource Center, in coordination with the OIC-Budget Officer, to 

strictly comply with the budgetary requirements set by the PCW-NEDA-DBM JC No. 
2012-01 during planning and budgeting phase; and 
 

b. instruct the GAD Focal Point System, in coordination with the GAD Focal Person, to 
maximize the utilization of GAD funds through the implementation of GAD-related 
programs and projects as planned, in order to attain the objective for which funds 
were provided.

COMMISSION ON AUDIT

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT 
 

 
Dr. HERNANDO D. ROBLES 
University President 
Cavite State University 
Indang, Cavite 
 
Opinion 
 
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the Cavite State University 
(CvSU) Main and its Campuses which comprise the Statement of Financial Position as at 
December 31, 2020, and the Statements of Financial Performance, Cash Flows, Changes in 
Net Assets/Equity and Statement of Comparison of Budget and Actual Amounts for the year 
then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory 
information. 
 
In our opinion, except for the effects on the matter described in the Bases for Qualified 
Opinion paragraphs, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material 
respects, the financial position of the CvSU as of December 31, 2020, and of its financial 
performance and cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with International Public 
Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS). 
 
Bases for Qualified Opinion 
 
As discussed in the Observations and Recommendations portion of this Report, the 
following are our bases for rendering a qualified opinion on the consolidated financial 
statements: 
 
1. Fifteen (15) asset and two liability accounts of Main Campus posted abnormal balances 

totaling P152,200,377.90 and P930,888.97, respectively, as of December 31, 2020. This 
significantly affects the accuracy and reliability of financial information presented in the 
financial statements, contrary to Section 15, Chapter 1 and Sections 6.f and 7, Chapter 
19 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies 
(NGAs), Volume I. 
 

2. The balance of Cash Collecting Officer (CCO) account of P790,626.13 presented in the 
Statement of Financial Position as of December 31, 2020 of the Main Campus is 
unreliable due to: (a) significant variance of P733,796.07 between the Cashier’s Cash 
Receipts Record and Statement of Financial Position;  (b) the existence of negative CCO 
balances of (P2,118,340.83) and (P42,790.67) on Fund 163 and Fund 164, respectively;  
(c) non-disclosure of information on the actual condition of the account in the Notes to 
Financial Statements; and (d) non-maintenance of Subsidiary Ledger.  This is contrary to 
Item 6.3 of Commission on Audit (COA) Circular No. 90-331, Section 15, Chapter 1, and 
Item f, Section 6, Chapter 19 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, and Section 12, Chapter 2 
of the same Manual.

3. The reported total Cash in Bank - Local Currency balance of P1,346,135,458.37 as of 

December 31, 2020, of the Main Campus is unreliable due to: (a) non-
preparation/submission of CY 2020 Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS) for 21 bank 
accounts; (b) incomplete and unreconciled Subsidiary Ledgers and schedules for Cash in 
Bank accounts; and (c) significant variance in the reported balances per bank 
confirmation and Cashier’s Check Disbursement Records (CkDR) as compared with 
accounting records.  This is contrary to Sections 3, 5 and 7 of Chapter 21 and Section 12, 
Chapter 2 of GAM, Volume I and Appendix 6 of GAM, Volume II, both for NGAs. 
 

4. The reported Due from NGAs account totaling P437,209,507.45, includes amount 
collectible from Commission on Higher Education (CHED) for the implementation of 
Republic Act (RA) No. 10931 or the Free Higher Education Act amounting to 
P430,403,492.50. This collectible should have been recorded under Accounts 
Receivable-CHED contrary to Chapter 3 of GAM for NGAs, Volume III. 
 

5. The collectability of CvSU’s receivables account aggregating P10,960,605.03, which 
have been non-moving for eight to 12 years, could not be ascertained due to absence of 
records from which the debtors could be identified, thereby affecting the validity of 
Receivables account as reported in the financial statements, contrary to COA Circular 
No. 2016-005 and Section 12, Chapter 2 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I.  This is also 
detrimental to the government given the remote chance of collection from unidentified 
debtors. 
 

6. The balance of Inventories totaling P18,304,785.19 of CvSU-Rosario Campus is 
unreliable due to inclusion of slow/non-moving accounts aggregating P15,088,231.61, 
which were still taken up as assets as of December 31, 2020. The non-recognition as an 
expense on the proper period is contrary to the guidelines and procedures prescribed 
under Sections 7, Chapter 8 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I, thus resulting in the 
overstatement of inventory and government equity accounts by P15,088,231.61. 
 

7. The reported Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) net of Construction in Progress (CIP) 
of the CvSU with a total acquisition cost of P1,731,511,063.85 is unreliable due to:  (a) 
significant variance of P89,568,854.71 between the amount recorded per books as 
against the Report on the Physical Count of PPE (RPCPPE); (b) continuous non-
reconciliation of records by the Accounting and Property Offices, including current year 
acquisitions; and (c) the reported PPE per financial statements and RPCPPE are not 
supported with updated PPE Ledger Card (PPELC) and Property Card (PC), respectively. 
Also, issued semi-expendable properties acquired in prior years still formed part of the 
PPE balance as of year-end, contrary to Sections 10 and 18.e, Chapter 8 of GAM for 
NGAs, Volume I and COA Circular No. 2005-002. 

 
8. The undelivered goods and unfinished projects of Naic and Rosario Campuses as of 

year-end amounting to P1,732,293.30 and P2,033,186.25 were recorded as outright 
expense and assets under the Inventory and PPE accounts, respectively and the 
corresponding liability were recognized in the books, contrary to Sections 2.a, 15 and 44, 
Chapters 6, 8 and 10 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I. This practice resulted in the 
overstatement of the affected asset, expense and liability accounts by the same amount. 

 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards of Supreme Audit 
Institutions (ISSAIs). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We 
are independent of the agency in accordance with the Revised Code of Conduct and Ethical 
Standards for Commission on Audit Officials (Code of Ethics) together with the ethical 
requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the Philippines, and 
we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and 
the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 
 
Key Audit Matters 
 
Except for the matter described in the Bases for Qualified Opinion section, we have 
determined that there are no other key audit matters to communicate in our report. 
 
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the 
Financial Statements  
 
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial 
statements in accordance with International Public Sector Accounting Standards, and for 
such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of 
financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
 
Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the agency’s financial 
reporting process. 
 
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements 
 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements 
as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue 
an auditor’s report that includes our opinion.  Reasonable assurance is a high level of 
assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISSAIs will 
always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or 
error and are considered material, if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably 
be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
financial statements.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 

 
1. General Information/Agency Profile  

 
The consolidated financial statements of the Cavite State University (CvSU) were authorized 
for issue on February 15, 2021 as shown in the Statement of Management’s Responsibility 
for Financial Statements signed by Dr. Hernando D. Robles, University President.  
 
The CvSU was previously known as the Don Severino Agricultural College. It was converted 
into a State University to be known as the CvSU by virtue of Republic Act (RA) No. 8468. 
The mandate of the CvSU is to produce skilled, globally competitive and morally upright 
individuals. Further, the University aims to provide excellent, equitable, and relevant 
educational opportunities in the arts, sciences and technology through quality instruction 
and responsive research and development activities. The main office is located in Indang, 
Cavite. 
 
The University has eleven satellite campuses located at Trece Martires City, Silang, Tanza, 
Bacoor, General Trias, Imus, Cavite City, Carmona, Maragondon, Naic and Rosario 
Campuses. 
  
 

2. Statement of Compliance and Basis of Preparation of Financial Statements  
 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the 
International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) issued by the Commission on 
Audit (COA) per COA Resolution No. 2020-001 dated January 9, 2020. 
 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of historical cost, 
unless stated otherwise.  The Statement of Cash Flows is prepared using the direct method. 
   
 

3.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
 
3.1 Basis of Accounting  
 
The financial statements are prepared on an accrual basis in accordance with IPSAS. 
 
3.2 Cash and Cash Equivalents  

 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and cash in bank, deposits on call and 
highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less, which are readily 
convertible to known amounts of cash and are subject to insignificant risk of changes in 
value. For the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash 
equivalents consist of cash and short-term deposits as defined above, net of outstanding 
bank overdrafts. 
 
 
 
 
 



18 
 

3.3 Inventories 
 
Inventory is measured at cost upon initial recognition. To the extent that inventory was 
received through non-exchange transactions (for no cost or for a nominal cost), the cost of 
the inventory is its fair value at the date of acquisition. 
  
3.4  Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) 

 
Recognition 
 
An item is recognized as PPE if it meets the characteristics and recognition criteria as a 
PPE. 
 
The characteristics of PPE are as follows: 
 

 tangible items; 
 

 are held for use in the production or supply of goods or services, for rental to others, or 
for administrative purposes; and 

 

 are expected to be used during more than one reporting period. 
 
An item of PPE is recognized as an asset if:   
 

 it is probable that future economic benefits or service potential associated with the item 
will flow to the entity; and 

 

 the cost or fair value of the item can be measured reliably. 
 

Measurement at Recognition 
 

An item recognized as PPE is measured at cost. 

A PPE acquired through non-exchange transaction is measured at its fair value as at the 

date of acquisition. 

The cost of the PPE is the cash price equivalent, or for PPE acquired through non-exchange 

transaction, its cost is its fair value as at recognition date.  

Cost includes the following: 
 

 Its purchase price, including import duties and non-refundable purchase taxes, after 
deducting trade discounts and rebates; 

 

 Expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items; and 
 

 Initial estimate of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site 
on which it is located, the obligation for which an entity incurs either when the item is 
acquired, or as a consequence of having used the item during a particular period for 
purposes other than to produce inventories during that period. 



19 
 

Measurement After Recognition 

 

After recognition, all PPE are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment 
losses (if applicable). 

 
When significant parts of PPE are required to be replaced at intervals, the University 
recognizes such parts as individual assets with specific useful lives and depreciates them 
accordingly. Likewise, when a major repair/replacement is done, its cost is recognized in the 
carrying amount of the plant and equipment as a replacement if the recognition criteria are 
satisfied.  

 
All other repair and maintenance costs are recognized as expense in surplus or deficit as 
incurred. 
 
Depreciation 
 
The depreciation charge for each period is recognized as expense unless it is included in 
the cost of another asset. 

 
Initial Recognition of Depreciation 
 
Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use such as when it is in the location 
and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by 
Management. 
 
Depreciation Method 
 
The straight-line method of depreciation is adopted unless another method is more 
appropriate for agency operation. 
 
Estimated Useful Life 
 
The University uses the Schedule on the Estimated Useful Life of PPE by classification 
prescribed by the COA. 
 
The CvSU uses a residual value equivalent to at least five percent of the cost of the PPE as 
prescribed in the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies 
(NGAs). 
 
Derecognition 
 
The CvSU derecognizes items of PPE and/or any significant part of an asset upon disposal 
or when no future economic benefits or service potential is expected from their continuing 
use. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference 
between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the 
surplus or deficit when the asset is derecognized. 
 



20 
 

3.5 Budget information 
 
The annual budget is prepared on a cash basis and is published in the government website.  
 
A separate Statement of Comparison of Budget and Actual Amounts (SCBAA) were 
prepared since the budget and the financial statements were not prepared on comparable 
basis. The SCBAA was presented showing the original and final budget and the actual 
amounts on comparable basis to the budget. Explanatory comments are provided in the 
notes to the annual financial statements. The budget figures were those approved by the 
governing body both at the beginning and during the year following a period of consultation 
with the public. 
 
There is a material difference between the Final Budget and Actual Amount for Capital 
Outlay due to inclusion of PPEs/Construction in Progress (CIP) which are covered by 
Supplemental Budget approved in year 2019 which are not included in the year 2020 
budget. Also, there are projects which are included in the 2020 budget but have not yet 
materialized as of the end of Fiscal Year (FY) 2020. 
 
Reconciliation between the actual amounts on a comparable basis as presented in the 
SCBAA and the actual amounts in the Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended 
December 31, 2020, is presented below. There is an entity difference: the budget is 
prepared based on the General Appropriations Act (GAA) and other Funds of the Campus, 
while the Cash Flow Statement includes all funds, as well as receipts and payments not 
covered in budget. Entity difference reflected is composed of scholarship and salary refunds 
from employees. Basis difference is composed of Tax Remittance Advice (TRA), Increase in 
Accounts Receivable, refund of Disallowances, receipt and expenditure of externally funded 
projects, grant of cash advances and refund of the same, decrease in inventory, remittance 
of withholding taxes, increase in PPE accounts and reversal of unutilized Notice of Cash 
Allocation (NCA). There is also a basis difference: the actual amounts in budget are 
prepared on accrual basis and the Cash Flow on cash basis.

3.6 Employee benefits 
 
The employees of the CvSU are members of the Government Service Insurance System 
(GSIS), which provides life and retirement insurance coverage.  
 
The CvSU recognizes the undiscounted amount of short-term employee benefits, like 
salaries, wages, bonuses, allowance, etc., as expense unless capitalized, and as a liability 
after deducting the amount paid. 
 
The CvSU recognizes expenses for accumulating compensated absences when these were 
paid (commuted or paid as terminal leave benefits). Unused entitlements that have 
accumulated at the reporting date were not recognized as expense. Non-accumulating 
compensated absences, like special leave privileges, were not recognized. 
 
 

4. Changes in accounting policies and estimates  
 
The CvSU recognizes the effects of changes in accounting policy retrospectively. The 
effects of changes in accounting policy were applied prospectively if retrospective 
application is impractical. 
 
The CvSU recognizes the effects of changes in accounting estimates prospectively by 
including in surplus or deficit. 
 
The CvSU corrects material prior period’s errors retrospectively in the first set of financial 

statements authorized for issue after their discovery by: 

• restating the comparative amounts for prior period(s) presented in which the error 
occurred; or 

 
• if the error occurred before the earliest prior period presented, restating the opening 

balances of assets, liabilities and net assets/equity for the earliest prior period 
presented. 

  
The CvSU adopted the following new accounting policies: 
 
On January 9, 2020, the CvSU adopted the IPSAS which replaced the existing standards. 
The new standard includes the requirement for proper recognition, measurement, 
presentation and disclosure of accounts. This accounting change had minor significant 
impact on the CvSU’s Consolidated Financial Statements.  
 
Prior period adjustments reflected in the Statement of Changes of Net Assets/Equity of the 
Main Campus for the period December 31, 2020, consist of the following:

Part II – Observations and Recommendations



35 

 

OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

 
1. Fifteen (15) asset and two liability accounts of Main Campus posted abnormal 

balances totaling P152,200,377.90 and P930,888.97, respectively, as of December 31, 
2020. This significantly affects the accuracy and reliability of financial information 
presented in the financial statements, contrary to Section 15, Chapter 1 and Sections 
6.f and 7, Chapter 19 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National 
Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I. 
 
Section 15, Chapter 1 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I provides:  
 

“The Financial Statements (FSs) shall present fairly the financial position, 
financial performance and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the 
faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events and conditions 
in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, 
revenue and expenses set out in Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standards 
(IPSAS). The application of IPSAS, with appropriate disclosure, if necessary, 
would result in fair presentation of the FS.” 

 
Item f, Section 6, Chapter 19 of the said Manual states, among others, the Qualitative 
Characteristic of Financial Reporting, as follows:  
 

“Faithful Representation - information to represent faithfully transactions and 
other events, it should be presented in accordance with the substance of the 
transactions and other events, and not merely their legal form.” 

 
Section 7, Chapter 19 of the same Manual provides that financial statements shall present 
fairly the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of an entity. Fair 
presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, 
and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, 
liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in IPSASs. The application of IPSASs, with 
additional disclosures when necessary, is presumed to result in financial statements that 
achieve a fair presentation. (Par. 27, IPSAS 1)  
 
An entity whose financial statements comply with IPSASs shall make an explicit and 
unreserved statement of such compliance in the notes. Financial statements shall not be 
described as complying with IPSASs unless they comply with all the requirements of 
IPSASs. (Par. 28, IPSAS 1) 
 
A fair presentation also requires an entity to: 
  
a. select and apply accounting policies in accordance with IPSAS 3, Accounting Policies, 

Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors. IPSAS 3 sets out a hierarchy of 
authoritative guidance that management considers, in the absence of a Standard that 
specifically applies to an item;  
 

b. present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, 
reliable, comparable and understandable information; and  
 



36 

 

c.  provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in 
IPSASs is insufficient to enable users to understand the impact of particular 
transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial 
performance. (Par. 29, IPSAS 1).  

 
Verification of the Statement of Financial Position per fund of Main Campus as of December 
31, 2020, showed that 15 asset and two liability accounts posted abnormal balances, which 
significantly affect the accuracy and reliability of financial information presented in the 
financial statements. The details are enumerated below with comparative figures for CY 
2019.

Analysis of the accounts revealed the following observations: 
 
a. The negative balances of five asset* and one liability accounts* were still carried in the 

books and remained unadjusted for three consecutive years;  
 

b. The negative balances on three asset** accounts existed in calendar year (CY) 2020 
due to the erroneous posting of refund of cash advances to Fund 101 (Trust 
Miscellaneous) instead of General Fund (Fund 101). No Subsidiary Ledger was 
maintained to monitor the balances;  
 

c. The negative balance on the Receivables - Disallowances/Charges account under Fund 
101 (Trust Miscellaneous) remarkably increased by P17,855,869.26 or 413 percent from 
the previous year’s balance of P4,326,399.67. This was mainly due to the charging of 
settlement of some disallowances which were not yet final and executory to the said 
account. No set-up for the said disallowances was made in the books of accounts since 
no Notice of Finality of Decision (NFD) was issued yet, hence the abnormal balance. 
Furthermore, no Subsidiary Ledger was maintained to monitor the balances; and  
 

d. The negative balance on the account Guaranty/Security Deposits Payable under Fund 
163 existed due to payments to Contractors for the refund of retention and other fees, 
which were debited to the account despite insufficient account balance on the said fund.  

 



37 

 

Inquiry with the Accountant disclosed that there is ongoing reconciliation for the 
abovementioned accounts. She explained that adjustments will be made on the Receivables 
- Disallowances/Charges account to reclassify the entry made for the settlement of 
disallowances with no NFD yet once original set-up of the receivable account is retrieved. 
However, she encounters difficulties in reconciling the said accounts due to unavailability of 
subsidiary ledgers, lack of human resources and imposition of community quarantines. 
 
This finding is a reiteration of prior years’ audit observation in view of the inability of the 
Accountant to reconcile the negative balances. 
 
These abnormal balances were offset upon consolidation of all funds except for the account 
Receivables - Disallowances/Charges. Moreover, the negative debit or credit balances of 
the foregoing accounts were indicative of errors in recording financial transactions. This 
significantly affected the accuracy and reliability of financial information presented in the 
financial statements. 
 
We recommended that the University President direct the Accountant to prioritize the 
reconciliation of the accounts, particularly for those with significant 
abnormal/negative balances, and thereafter, prepare the necessary adjusting journal 
entry/ies to achieve the fair presentation of accounts in the financial statements. 
Likewise, maintain Subsidiary Ledger to address the current abnormal balances of 
pertinent assets and liability accounts and prevent  incurrence of  the same  
accounting error in the succeeding years. 
 
Management’s Comments: 
 
The University President has already instructed the Accountant to prioritize the reconciliation 
of the accounts, and to maintain Subsidiary Ledger to prevent incurrence of abnormal 
balances in succeeding years. 
 
Auditor’s Rejoinder: 
 

The Audit Team acknowledged Management’s commitment, and will monitor full 
implementation of the said audit recommendations. 
 
 

2. The balance of Cash Collecting Officer (CCO) account of P790,626.13 presented in the 
Statement of Financial Position as of December 31, 2020 of the Main Campus is 
unreliable due to:  (a) significant variance of P733,796.07 between the Cashier’s Cash 
Receipts Record and Statement of Financial Position;  (b) the existence of negative 
CCO balances of (P2,118,340.83) and (P42,790.67) on Fund 163 and Fund 164, 
respectively;  (c) non-disclosure of information on the actual condition of the account 
in the Notes to Financial Statements; and (d) non-maintenance of Subsidiary Ledger.  
This is contrary to Item 6.3 of Commission on Audit (COA) Circular No. 90-331, 
Section 15, Chapter 1, and Item f, Section 6, Chapter 19 of the Government 
Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I, and 
Section 12, Chapter 2 of the same Manual.  
 
Item 6.3 of COA Circular No. 90-331 dated May 3, 1990, states that “The Accountable 
Officer (AO) shall reconcile the book balance with the cash on hand daily.  He shall foot and 



38 

 

close the books at the end of each month.  The AO and the Accountant shall reconcile their 
books of accounts at least quarterly.” 
 
Section 15, Chapter 1 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I provides: 
 

“The Financial Statements (FSs) shall present fairly the financial position, 
financial performance and cash flows of an entity.  Fair presentation 
requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other 
events and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition 
criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses set out in Philippine 
Public Sector accounting standards (PPSAS).  The application of PPSAS 
with appropriate disclosure, if necessary, would result in fair presentation of 
the FS.” (PPSAS was renamed to IPSAS) 
 

Item f, Section 6, Chapter 19 of the same Manual states, among others, the Qualitative 
characteristic of Financial Reporting, as follows: 

 
“Faithful Representation – information to represent faithfully transactions 
and other events.  It should be presented in accordance with the substance 
of the transactions and other events, and not merely their legal form.” 
 

Item No. 127 of IPSAS 1 states: 
 

“The notes shall: 
 

a. present information about the basis of preparation of the financial 
statements and the specific accounting policies used in accordance with 
paragraphs 132-139; 
 

b. disclose the information required by IPSASs that is not presented on the 
face of the statement of financial position, statement of financial 
performance, statement of changes in net assets/equity, and cash flows 
statement; and  
 

c. provide additional information that is not presented on the face of the 
statement of financial position, statement of financial performance, 
statement of changes in net assets/equity, and cash flow statement, but 
that is relevant to an understanding of any of them.” 

 
Notes shall, as far as practicable, be presented in a systematic manner. Each item on the 
face of the statement of financial position, statement of financial performance, statement of 
changes in net assets/equity, and cash flow statement shall be cross-referenced to any 
related information in the notes (Par. 128, IPSAS 1).  

 
Section 12, Chapter 2 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I prescribes the books of accounts to be 
maintained in the National Government entities consisting of the following: 
 

a.  Journals 
 

1. General Journals 



39 

 

2. Cash Receipts Journals 
3. Cash Disbursement Journals 
4. Check Disbursement Journals 
 

b. Ledgers 
 

1. General Ledgers 
2. Subsidiary Ledgers (Appendix 6) (boldfacing supplied) 

 
The Subsidiary Ledger (SL) is a book of final entry showing the details of the balances of 
controlling accounts appearing in the General Ledger (GL). Postings to the SL originate from 
source documents. Example of GL accounts which should be supported with SL are Cash -
Collecting Officer, Cash Disbursing Officers, Cash in Bank - Local Currency and Current 
Account and Accounts Receivable, among others. The totals of SL balances are reconciled 
with their respective accounts at the end of each month, and a statement thereon is 
prepared periodically to support the corresponding controlling GL accounts. 

 
The Cash - Collecting Officer account’s balance as presented in the Statement of Financial 
Position of the Main Campus for the year ended December 31, 2020, amounted to 
P790,626.13, consisting of the following: 

 
Fund 101 (Trust Miscellaneous) P    2,760,820.63 
Fund 161 190,937.00 

Fund 163 (2,118,340.83) 
Fund 164                     (42,790.67) 
      Total P       790,626.13 

  
Verification of the Campus’ financial statements as of December 31, 2020, disclosed that 
the balance of the Cash - Collecting Officer account for all funds totaling P790,626.13 was 
not reconciled with the Cashier’s Cash Receipts Record balance of P56,830.06, or a 
significance variance of P733,796.07. The details are presented below:

       Total P       790,626.13 P    56,830.06 P       733,796.07 

 
Comparison of balance per Statement of Financial Position (SFP) and per Cashier’s Cash 
Receipts Record (CRR) disclosed the following deficiencies: 

 

 The SFP showed a negative balances of (P2,118,340.83) and (P42,790.67) on Fund 
163 and Fund 164, respectively. These abnormal balances were offset upon 
consolidation of all funds. The existence of abnormal balances was discussed in audit 
observation no. 1. 
 



40 

 

 Material differences of P2,720,098.13 and P190,937.00 were noted under Fund 101 - 
Trust Miscellaneous and Fund 161, respectively, which is indicative that the Cashier and 
the Accountant did not reconcile their records religiously. 
 

Moreover, review of Note 5 in the Notes to Financial Statements as of December 31, 2020, 
disclosed that the balance of Cash Collecting Officer amounting to P790,626.13 represents 
undeposited collection of the Main Campus, which is due for deposit on the next banking 
day. This statement, however, violates Section 15, Chapter 1, and Item 6, Section 6, 
Chapter 19 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I due to the inability of the Accountant to fully 
disclose the information on the actual condition of the fund as presented in the foregoing 
table. 

 
Furthermore, it was observed that the material discrepancy between the CRR and SFP was 
attributed to the absence of Subsidiary Ledger considering that the CvSU has eight 
campuses with no complete set of books of accounts. The non-maintenance of Subsidiary 
Ledger was discussed in audit observation no.14.  

 
The foregoing conditions prevented the Audit Team to establish the accuracy of the reported 
Cash - Collecting Officer account, thus rendering the Cash Collecting Officer account 
balance unreliable. 

  
We recommended that the University President instruct: 
 
a. The Accountant and the Cashier to prioritize the reconciliation of Cash Collecting 

Officer account balance to ensure the correctness and completeness of the 
recorded entries/transactions; 

 
b. The Accountant to fully disclose the information on the Cash Collecting Officer 

account based on the actual condition of the fund to assist users in 
understanding the financial statements; and  

 
c. The Accountant to maintain separate Subsidiary Ledger for all the controlling 

accounts in the GL, particularly the Cash Collecting Officer account. 
 
Management’s Comments: 
 
The University President has already directed the Accountant and the Cashier to prioritize 

the reconciliation of Cash - Collecting Officer account to ensure the correctness and 

completeness of record.  

Moreover, he already advised the Accountant for full disclosure of the actual condition of the 
account and the maintenance of all supporting documents. 
 
Auditor’s Rejoinder: 
 
The Audit Team acknowledged Management’s commitment and will monitor full 
implementation of the said audit recommendations.

3. The reported total Cash in Bank - Local Currency balance of P1,346,135,458.37 as of 
December 31, 2020, of the Main Campus is unreliable due to: (a) non-
preparation/submission of calendar year (CY) 2020 Bank Reconciliation Statements 
(BRS) for 21 bank accounts; (b) incomplete and unreconciled Subsidiary Ledgers and 
schedules for Cash in Bank accounts; and (c) significant variance in the reported 
balances per bank confirmation and Cashier’s Check Disbursement Records (CkDR) 
as compared with accounting records.  This is contrary to Sections 3, 5 and 7 of 
Chapter 21 and Section 12, Chapter 2 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) 
for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I and Appendix 6 of the same 
Manual for NGAs, Volume II. 
 
Section 3, Chapter 21 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I sets forth the objectives for the 
preparation of BRS, to wit: 
 

a. “check correctness of both the bank’s and agency’s/entity’s records; 
b. serve as a deterrent to fraud; and  
c. enable the agency/entity or bank to take up charges or credits recognized by 

the bank or agency/entity but not yet known to the agency/entity or bank.”   
 
Section 5 of the said Chapter and Manual provides that “The Chief Accountant/Designated 
Staff shall within ten days from receipt of the monthly Bank Statement (BS) together with the 
paid checks, original copies of Debit Memoranda (DM)/Credit Memoranda (CM) from the 
GSB, reconcile the BS with the GL and prepare the Bank Reconciliation Statement (BRS) in 
four copies.” 
 
Moreover, Section 7 of the same Chapter and Manual prescribes the reporting period of 
BRS:  
 

“The Chief Accountant shall submit the BRS within twenty (20) days after receipt of the 
monthly Bank Statements (BS) to the following: 

 
Original – COA Auditor (with all the supporting documents and JEVs) 

Copy 2 – Head of Agency/Entity 
Copy 3 – Accounting Division/Unit file 
Copy 4 – Bank, if necessary 

 
Section 12, Chapter 2 of the same Manual, prescribes among others, the books of accounts 
to be maintained by NGAs, as follows: 
  

b.  Ledgers 
 

1. General Ledger (Appendix 5)  
2. Subsidiary Ledgers (Appendix 6) (boldfacing supplied) 

 
Appendix 6 of GAM for NGAs, Volume II prescribes the maintenance of Subsidiary Ledger, 
as follows:  
 

“This ledger shows detail for each control account in the General Ledger which is 
maintained per account and fund cluster by the Accounting Division/Unit.” 

 



42 

 

Item 6.3 of COA Circular No. 90-331 dated May 3, 1990 states that “The Accountable 
Officer (AO) shall reconcile the book balance with the cash on hand daily.  He shall foot and 
close the books at the end of each month.  The AO and the Accountant shall reconcile their 
books of accounts at least quarterly.”  
 
The total Cash in Bank - Local Currency balance as reflected in the Statement of Financial 
Position for the year ended December 31, 2020, amounted to P1,346,135,458.37, consisting 
of the following: 
 

Fund 101 (Trust Miscellaneous) P     343,366,993.14 

Fund 164 (Special Trust Fund)   981,039,199.82 

Fund 161 334,786.05 

Fund 163 21,394,479.36 

Total P  1,346,135,458.37 

 
Verification of the Main Campus’ Statement of Financial Position per fund revealed the 
following observations: 
 
A. Non-preparation/submission of CY 2020 BRS for 21 bank accounts 
  
Bank Reconciliation is an essential internal control tool necessary in preventing and 
detecting fraud. 
  
For five consecutive years, the non-preparation/non-submission of BRS has been the 
subject of audit finding which the Cavite State University (CvSU) Management attributed 
such on the lack of enough staff to handle the preparation of BRSs for the 21 bank 
accounts, of which 19 are under its Local Currency, Current Account and two are under 
Local Currency, Savings Account. 
 
For CY 2020, the Accounting Office had partially prepared and submitted the previous 
year’s BRS as of September 30, 2020, for Fund 101 (Trust Miscellaneous) and   Fund 164 
(Special Trust Fund) accounts only. Verification of the submitted BRS disclosed that the 
Accountant did not provide a complete list of information on the reconciling items amounting 
to P80,527,758.75 and P33,010,987.77, respectively, thus rendering the BRS unreliable. 
Likewise, no BRSs were submitted for the remaining 19 bank accounts. 
 
In order to comply with the audit recommendation, an accounting personnel was assigned to 
focus on the preparation of BRS. However, due to the imposition of quarantine restrictions, 
they have been encountering difficulties reconciling all the records, and as of the report 
writing, they are still preparing BRS as of year-end for the remaining bank accounts. 
 
Nevertheless, the continuous non-submission of accomplished current year’s BRS to the 
Audit Team prevented the review and verification of cash in bank reconciling items, as well 
as adjustments/corrections, if there are any, thus accuracy of the book balances cannot be 
established. 
 
Moreover, as part of audit procedures, the Audit Team made a bank balance confirmation 
on all depository accounts maintained by the Main Campus with the Landbank of the 
Philippines (LBP) under its Local Currency account as of December 31, 2020. Comparison

not be verified and reconciled due to continuous non-preparation and non-submission of

B. Incomplete and unreconciled Subsidiary Ledgers (SLs) and schedules for Cash in 
Bank accounts 

  
As cited under Item e, Section 6, Chapter 2 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I, the Accounting 
Office requires to maintain, among others, the SL to show the detailed schedules of the 
Cash in Bank - Local Currency account’s balances. 
  
The total Cash in Bank account’s balance of P1,346,135,458.37 cannot be fully verified due 
to incomplete and unreconciled schedules of Cash in Bank accounts. Though the 
Accounting Office was able to prepare the schedules for Funds 164, 161, 163 and Trust 
Miscellaneous Fund, the balances, however, were not reconciled with the General Ledger 
(GL), as shown below: 

             
Fund Balance per GL Balance per SL Difference 

Fund 164    P     981,039,199.82  P      615,296,637.07  P        365,742,562.75

Moreover, relative to the above schedule, the Audit Team cannot validate the accuracy of 
the difference shown due to the inaccuracy of the reported beginning balances of Cash in 
Bank in the SL. 
 
C. Significant variance in the reported balances per bank confirmation and Cashier’s 

Check Disbursements Record (CkDR) as compared with accounting records 
 

Item 6.3 of COA Circular No. 90-331 dated May 3, 1990, states that “The Accountable 
Officer (AO) shall reconcile the book balance with the cash on hand daily.  He shall foot and 
close the books at the end of each month.  The AO and the Accountant shall reconcile their 
books of accounts at least quarterly.”  
  
Certification of bank balances per Cashier’s CkDR as of December 31, 2020, disclosed a 
total Cash in Bank balance of P1,276,543,239.48, which includes two savings account 
under Fund 163 and Trust Miscellaneous Fund. However, the CkDR disclosed that savings 
account under Fund 163, which is the CvSU Cavite City 163, has an unreconciled difference 
with the book and bank balance of P2,245,152.03. 
 
Likewise, non-reconciliation of Accounting and Cashier’s records is still prevalent as 
evidenced by the material discrepancy of (P69,592,218.89) in their reported balances. The 
incomplete and unreconciled schedules of Cash in Bank accounts by the Accounting Office 
also hindered the reconciliation process. The details of discrepancies per bank account are 
shown  below.

Despite prior years’ audit recommendation, this perennial finding was not fully implemented 
by the Accounting Office, hence the Audit Team cannot attest to the fair presentation of 
Cash in Bank accounts in the financial statements. 
 
The foregoing conditions prevented the Audit Team to establish the accuracy of reported 
Cash in Bank accounts, thus rendering the Cash in Bank-Local Currency account’s 
balances unreliable. 
 
We recommended that the University President direct the: 
 
a. Accountant to expedite the preparation of the BRSs for the 19 bank accounts 

under Local Currency - Current Account of Main Campus and submit the said 
BRSs to the Audit Team, together with the copies of bank statements, debit or 
credit memos and other relevant documents, so that reconciling items could be 
determined and analyzed to establish the accuracy and reliability of the reported 
cash balances in the financial statements, in compliance with Sections 3, 5 and 7, 
Chapter 21 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I; 
 

b. Accountant to continuously update the schedules/SLs of cash in bank accounts 
following the format prescribed in Appendix 6 of GAM for NGAs, Volume II, and 
reconcile the SLs with the GL balance;  



46 

 

 
c. Cashier to immediately prepare reconciliation of CkDR of savings account under 

Fund 163, in order to arrive at an amount equal to the book and bank balances; 
 
d. Accountant and Cashier to religiously conduct monthly reconciliation of the Cash 

in Bank balance to ensure the correctness and completeness of the recorded 
entries/transactions; and 

 
e. Director for Finance Management Office to closely monitor the preparation and 

submission of BRSs to the Audit Team, including the regular reconciliation of 
records by the Accountant and the Cashier, and submit to the Office of the Audit 
Team the periodic report on the status of BRS preparation. 
 

Management’s Comments: 
 
The University President has already instructed the Accountant to expedite the preparation 
of Bank Reconciliation Statements for the 19 Bank Accounts under Cash in Bank - Local 
Currency Account, and to continuously update the schedules/Subsidiary Ledgers of the 
account. 
 
Moreover, he also directed the immediate preparation of reconciliation of Fund 163 and the 
religious reconciliation of the Cashier and the Accountant’s records for strict monitoring of 
the Director for Finance Management Office. 
 
Auditor’s Rejoinder: 
 

The Audit Team acknowledged Management’s commitment and will monitor full implementation 
of the said audit recommendations. 
 
 

4. The reported Due from National Government Agencies (NGAs) account totaling 
P437,209,507.45, includes amount collectible from Commission on Higher Education 
(CHED) for the implementation of Republic Act (RA) No. 10931 or the Free Higher 
Education Act amounting to P430,403,492.50. This collectible should have been 
recorded under Accounts Receivable-Commission on Higher Education (CHED) 
contrary to Chapter 3 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National 
Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume III. 

 
Chapter 3 of GAM for NGAs, Volume III provides the description of accounts that will enable 
the agency to properly recognize and present its financial transactions, to wit, 

 
“Accounts Receivable. This account is used to recognize the amount due from 
customers arising from regular trade and business transactions. Credit this 
account upon collection of receivables, transfers or write-off. 
 
Due from National Government Agencies. This account is used to recognize 
advances for purchase of goods/services as authorized by law, fund transfers to 
the NGAs for implementation of projects and other receivables from NGAs. 
Credit this account upon receipt of goods/services, and liquidation of fund 
transfers/receivables.” 



47 

 

 
Review of the Main Campus’ Statement of Financial Position and Notes to Financial 
Statements for calendar year (CY) 2020 showed that part of the Inter-Agency Receivables 
(Due from NGAs Account) was the receivable from CHED amounting to P430,403,492.50. 
The said amount pertains to Tuition Fees and Other School Fees (TOSF) for the First 
Semester, Academic Year (AY) 2020-2021 to be charged against the Free Higher Education 
of CHED. The same was billed on October 14, 2020 with billing reference number 04-CvSU-
2020-1-1. 

 
Relative to this, the entry made to recognize the said revenue was a debit to Due from 
National Government Agencies, instead of Accounts Receivable. Based on the description 
provided for by Chapter 3 of GAM for NGAs, Volume III, the Due from NGAs account shall 
only be used to “recognize advances for purchase of goods/services as authorized by law, 
fund transfers to the NGAs for implementation of projects and other receivables from NGAs.”  
Since TOSF arises from regular trade and business transactions and are classified under 
Business Income, the said transaction shall be recorded as the Agency’s Accounts 
Receivable. Notwithstanding the fact that this income is collected from CHED, which is an 
NGA, this still represents the income generated from doing regular business transactions 
which primarily shall be paid by the students/enrollees. 
 
Inquiry with the Accountant revealed that she erroneously recorded the collectible as Due 
from NGAs thinking that it is the appropriate account to be used for the fund transfer to 
NGA.  She further explained that adjustment will be effected immediately. 
 
This deficiency made in the recording and reporting of income and receivable may mislead 
users of the financial statements as to the current financial position of the Agency. 

 
We recommended that the University President instruct the Accountant to prepare the 
necessary journal entry to correct the error made in recording the abovementioned 
receivable, and to ensure proper recognition of assets and income to properly 
present reliable account conditions in the financial statements. 
 
Management’s Comments: 
 

The Accountant already prepared a correcting entry with reference no. 2021-164-01-04 
dated January 31, 2021. Likewise, disclosure was also made in the Notes to Financial 
Statements. 
 
Auditor’s Rejoinder: 
 

The Audit Team acknowledged Management’s commitment and will monitor full 
implementation of the said audit recommendations. 
 
 

5. The collectability of CvSU’s receivables account aggregating P10,960,605.03, which 
have been non-moving for eight to 12 years, could not be ascertained due to absence 
of records from which the debtors could be identified, thereby affecting the validity of 
Receivables account as reported in the financial statements, contrary to Commission 
on Audit (COA) Circular No. 2016-005 and Section 12, Chapter 2 of the Government 
Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I.  This 



48 

 

is also detrimental to the government given the remote chance of collection from 
unidentified debtors. 
  
COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016, was issued to prescribe the 
Guidelines and Procedures on the Write-off of Dormant Receivables, Cash Advances and 
Fund Transfers. Item 5.4 of the said Circular defines dormant receivables as: “accounts 
which balances remained inactive or non-moving in the books of accounts for ten years or 
more and where settlement/collectability could no longer be ascertained.” 
 
Further, to assess the existence of recorded assets especially the Receivables account, 
Section 7.1 of the aforementioned Circular states that “The Accountant shall conduct regular 
and periodic verification, analysis and validation of the existence of receivables, unliquidated 
cash advances and fund transfers and determine the concerned debtors, accountable 
officers and the source and implementing government agencies concerned.” 

 
Moreover, Section 12, Chapter 2 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I prescribes the maintenance of 
books of accounts, particularly the General Ledgers and Subsidiary Ledgers, among 
others.    
 
Review of the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position for the year ended December 
31, 2019, showed four receivable accounts with an aggregate amount of P10,960,605.03, 
which remained non-moving for several years, as shown hereunder: 
 

Account Name Amount Yrs. Outstanding Campus 

Accounts Receivable P        52,500.00 12 (since 2008) Rosario Campus 

Loans Receivable - Others 220,000.00 9 (since 2011) Main Campus 

Due from Operating Units   1,500,000.00 8 (since 2012) Main Campus 
Other Receivables      9,188,105.03 9-12 (since 2008) Main, Naic and Rosario 

    Total P 10,960,605.03   

 
Main Campus  
 
The Due from Operating Units has been identified as receivable from Cavite State University 
(CvSU) Naic Campus and recorded in its book under the Due to Central Office account. The 
Accountant of Main Campus explained that the amount remained uncollected due to 
unavailability of records and source documents as basis for collection. 
 
The other two receivable accounts, namely, Loans Receivable - Others and Other 
Receivables consist of loans granted to students and collectibles of the CvSU from its 
different projects and business operations. The two accounts remained in the books for nine 
to 12 years without detailed schedules and documents to support their validity.  
 
The Accountant commented that the Accounting Unit is exerting effort in tracing the records 
to substantiate the balance of the subject receivables. 
 
Naic Campus 
 
The Accountant identified the Other Receivables as the outstanding balance of the financial 
assistance named Student Assistance for Education (SAFE) Loan to qualified students in 
year 2011. 



49 

 

 
Management explained that there were no records/schedules forwarded to them by the 
Main Campus to substantiate the validity and existence of the loan. Moreover, no loan 
records were likewise kept by the Office of the Student Affairs (OSA) of Naic Campus.  
 
Rosario Campus 
 
Verification of previous years’ financial statements disclosed outstanding receivables 
amounting to P52,500.00 under Fund 163, which remained non-moving for 12 years, thus 
already considered dormant. Likewise, the Other Receivables amounting to P4,536,987.10 
under the Special Trust Fund (Fund 164) has been non-moving since calendar year (CY) 
2016 up to the reporting date, indicating increased probability of dormancy. Furthermore, 
these balances remained in the books for several years up to the reporting date without 
schedules nor documents to substantiate their validity. 
 
This is a reiteration of previous year’s audit observation. However, no substantial 
compliance with the Audit Team’s recommendation was seen. 
 
The absence of records would mean remote chance of collection since no information as to 
the name and identity of debtors was identified from which collections could be enforced, 
thus detrimental to the government.  
 
Likewise, lapses in maintaining subsidiary ledgers for receivable accounts resulted in the 
accumulation of huge balances that remained non-moving/dormant for eight to 12 years, 
thus of doubtful validity. 
 
We recommended that the University President and Campus Administrators direct the 
Accountants of Main, Naic and Rosario Campuses to: 
 
a. maximize efforts to identify the debtors comprising the balances of Loans 

Receivable and Other Receivable accounts totaling P9,408,105.03 through formal 
inquiry with the Office of Student Affairs (OSA) and if possible, seek the 
assistance from the commission on Higher Education Regional Office (CHED-RO) 
for possible identification of student-borrower; 
 

b. Issue the corresponding Billing Statement to enforce collection of P1,500,000.00;  
 
c. maintain Subsidiary Ledgers for all controlling accounts in the General Ledger, 

compliant with the format prescribed in Section 12(b), Chapter 2 of GAM for 
NGAS, Volume I and Appendices 5 and 6 of the same Manual for NGAs, Volume II. 

 
Management’s Comments: 
 
Main Campus 
 
The University President has directed the concerned officials to comply with the audit 
recommendations.  
 
 
 



50 

 

Naic Campus 
 
The Campus Administrator has already instructed the Accountant to verify through an 
inquiry with the former accountant and OSA of Main Campus to identity the debtors.  
However, due to lack of documents and improper turnover of positions, no records were 
obtained.  Moreover, the Accountant will initiate request to write-off the receivable once all 
remedies are already exhausted. 
 
Rosario Campus 
 
The Campus Administrator has directed the Accountant to exert more effort on the recovery 
and analysis of records pertaining to prior year’s transactions, in order to reconstruct the 
schedules to support the balances of receivables, and to make the necessary adjustment in 
the books.  Moreover, if efforts remain futile, the Accountant shall initiate request for write-off 
of the accounts as prescribed by COA Circular No. 2016-005. 
 
Auditor’s Rejoinder:  
 
The Audit Team acknowledged Management’s commitment and will monitor full 
implementation of the said audit recommendations. 
 
 

6. The balance of Inventories totaling P18,304,785.19 of Cavite State University (CvSU)-
Rosario Campus is unreliable due to inclusion of slow/non-moving accounts 
aggregating P15,088,231.61, which were still taken up as assets as of December 31, 
2020. The non-recognition as an expense on the proper period is contrary to the 
guidelines and procedures prescribed under Section 7, Chapter 8 of the Government 
Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I, thus 
resulting in the overstatement of inventory and government equity accounts by 
P15,088,231.61. 

 
Section 7, Chapter 8 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I provides policies on inventories as follows: 

 
“Recognition as an Expense. When inventories are sold, exchanged, or 
distributed, their carrying amount shall be recognized as an expense in the 
period in which the related revenue is recognized. If there is no related revenue, 
the expense is recognized when the goods are distributed or the related service 
is rendered.”  (bold facing supplied) 

 
Review of the General Ledger and Statement of Financial Position for the year ended 
December 31, 2020, disclosed several inventory accounts which reported minimal 
movement on previous years’ balances. Total credits to the inventory accounts amounted to 
P587,358.15 only, thereby reducing the slow/non-moving accounts to P15,088,231.61 as of 
December 31, 2020.  The details are shown on the next page:

This is a reiteration of previous year’s audit recommendation, in view of the inability of the 
Accounting Office to adjust the issued and sold inventories in the books of accounts.  
 
The Accountant explained that he was unable to adjust the accounts accordingly due to 
absence of reports and documents specifically Report of Supplies and Materials Issued 
(RSMI), and Sales Report of External and Business Affairs Office for merchandise sold in 
prior years to support the recognition as an expense for proper adjustment in the 
government equity account.  
 
Verbal inquiry with the Accountant also disclosed that no regular reconciliation of accounting 
records and actual inventories on hand as reported by the Supply Officer was conducted to 
ascertain the validity and existence of inventory items. The Audit Team followed-up the 
submission of the Report on the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) with the Supply 
Officer to determine the balance on hand as of December 31, 2020.   However, the Supply 
Officer has yet to submit the report as of this report writing. She also commented that they 
have minimal amount of stocks as most of these were already issued, and current year’s 
supplies were delivered in 2021 only. 
 
The continuous reporting of inventory accounts which are already issued, distributed and 
sold overstated the reported balance of Inventory in the financial statements.  Furthermore, 



52 

 

the government equity account is likewise overstated due to non-recording of expense in the 
proper period, contrary to Section 7, Chapter 8 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I.  
  
We recommended that the Campus Administrator of Rosario Campus:  
 
a. instruct the Officer-in-Charge (OIC) for External and Business Affairs (EBA) Office 

to submit the sales report for merchandise sold in the previous years to the 
Accountant, for proper adjustment of the Merchandise Inventory account;  

  
b. direct the OIC for Supply Office to prepare the RSMI on the aforementioned 

consumable inventory accounts, which were issued in prior years, and submit the 
same to the Accountant for proper adjustment in the books of accounts; and 

  
c. direct the Accountant to take up the adjusting journal entry/ies on the subject 

Inventory accounts based on the submitted RSMI and sales report to correct the 
reported balances, and observe strictly the proper recognition of expense as 
prescribed under Section 7, Chapter 8 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I. 

 
Management’s Comments: 
 
The Campus Administrator instructed the concerned Officers to review their records of prior 
year’s transactions and to prepare and submit the needed reports to the Accountant, in 
order to adjust the balance of Inventories in the books to fully adhere to the guidelines set 
forth in GAM for NGAs, Volume I. 
 
Auditor’s Rejoinder: 
 

The Audit Team acknowledged Management’s commitment and will monitor full 
implementation of the said audit recommendations. 
 
 

7. The reported Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) net of Construction in Progress 
(CIP) of the Cavite State University (CvSU) with a total acquisition cost of 
P1,731,511,063.85 is unreliable due to: (a) significant variance of P89,568,854.71 
between the amount recorded per books as against the Report on the Physical Count 
of PPE (RPCPPE); (b) continuous non-reconciliation of records by the Accounting 
and Property Offices, including current year acquisitions; and (c) the reported PPE 
per financial statements and RPCPPE are not supported with updated PPE Ledger 
Card (PPELC) and Property Card (PC), respectively. Also, issued semi-expendable 
properties acquired in prior years still formed part of the PPE balance as of year-end, 
contrary to Sections 10 and 18.e, Chapter 8 of the Government Accounting Manual 
(GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I and Commission on Audit 
(COA) Circular No. 2005-002. 
 
The importance of maintaining a complete and updated records by the Accounting and 
Property Offices is emphasized in Section 42, Chapter 10 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I, 
which provides: 
 

“The Chief Accountant shall maintain the Property, Plant and Equipment Ledger 
Card (PPELC) for each category of PPE including work and other animals, 



53 

 

livestock etc. The PPELC shall be kept to record promptly the acquisition, 
description, custody, estimated useful life, depreciation, impairment loss, 
disposal and other information about the asset. For check and balance, the 
Property and Supply Office/Unit shall likewise maintain Property Card (PC) for 
PPE in their custody to account for the receipt and disposition of the same. The 
balance per PC shall be reconciled with PPELC maintained by the 
Accounting Division/Unit.”  (emphasis ours) 

 
Also, Section 10, Chapter 8 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I stipulates that tangible items below 
the capitalization threshold of P15,000.00 shall be accounted as semi-expendable property 
and the following policies shall be applied: 
 

a. “Semi-expendable properties which were recognized as Property, Plant and 
Equipment (PPE) shall be reclassified to the affected accounts.  
 

b. The tangible items shall be recognized as expenses upon issue to the end-
user.”  (emphasis ours) 

 
Section 18.e of the same Manual provides illustrative accounting entries for the 
acquisition and issuance of semi-expendable items.  
 
Likewise, COA Circular No. 2005-002 dated April 14, 2005, provides the accounting policy 
on items with serviceable life of more than one year but small enough to be considered as 
PPE. Small tangible items shall be recorded as Inventories upon acquisition and expense 
upon issuance. 
 
The PPE of the CvSU net of CIP was reported at a total acquisition cost of 
P1,731,511,063.85, which accounts for 51.14 percent of the total assets of 
P3,385,620,933.77 as at December 31, 2020. Review of PPE balances reported in the 
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as compared with the RPCPPE disclosed a 
significant variance of P89,568,854.71. The details are shown in the hereunder table:

Verification of records disclosed the following observations: 
 

 Comparison of the previous year’s RPCPPE against the current year’s report showed an 
increase of P136,583,557.52. However, an increase of P184,889,557.39 in PPE was 
also noted in the review of the financial statements. The material difference in 
acquisitions amounting to P48,306,000.14 indicates continuous non-reconciliation of 
current year records, which contributed to the accumulation of significant amount of 
discrepancies; 
 

 Significant variance in the recorded PPE per books and per RPCPPE was also noted 
totaling P89,568,854.71, representing 5.17 percent of the total acquisition cost recorded 
per books; 
 

 Presence of varying PPE accounts such as water supply systems, Disaster Response 
and Rescue Equipment and Other Leases Assets Improvements per books and Railway 
systems per RPCPPE, due to absence of proper reconciliation.  

 

 The reported PPE in the financial statements and RPCPPE are not supported with 
PPELCs and PCs, respectively. The Accounting and Property Offices are still updating 
the records prospectively; 
 

 Issued semi-expendable properties acquired from previous years were still included in 
the PPE balance as of year-end by the Accounting Office.  Per inquiry with the 
Accountant, adjustment will be reflected in CY 2021 financial statements. 



55 

 

 
This is a reiteration of previous year’s audit observations, however, no substantial 
compliance with the Audit Team’s audit recommendation was seen. 
 
Consequently, the continuous inaction by both Accounting and Property Offices to gradually 
reconcile their records affected the existence and validity of the reported PPE balances. 
 
The foregoing considered, there is no assurance that all PPE in the accounting records 
actually exist, and that all the PPE in the RPCPPE are recorded in the books of accounts. 
 
We recommended that the University President and the Campus Administrators of 
Naic and Rosario Campuses: 
 
a. create an Inventory Committee composed of both Accounting and Property 

personnel to work on the unreconciled difference of P89,568,854.71 between the 
accounting records and the RPCPPE; 
 

b. direct both the Accounting and Property Offices to: (a) continuously update the 
required PPE Ledger Cards and Property Cards to facilitate reconciliation of 
records; and (b) submit to the Office of the University President/Campus 
Administrator the quarterly report on the status of their reconciliation to gradually 
reconcile pertinent accounting and property records, and thus avoid the 
accumulation of significant amount of discrepancies, in compliance with Section 
42, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I;  

 
c. direct the Accountants to drop from the books of accounts, all issued semi-

expendable properties acquired in previous years, in the PPE accounts; and  
 
d. instruct the Directors for Finance Management Office (FMO)/Administration and 

Finance Services to monitor the maintenance and continuous updating of PPE 
Ledger Cards and Property Cards, including the quarterly/periodic reconciliation 
of both records, in accordance with the aforementioned provisions of GAM for 
NGAs, Volume I. 

 
Management’s Comment: 
 
Main Campus 
 
The University President will create an Inventory Committee composed of both Accounting 
and Property personnel to work on reconciliation.  Likewise, he has already instructed the 
officials and employees of Finance Management Office and Supply and Property Officer to 
comply with the audit recommendations. 
 
Naic Campus 
 
The Campus Administrator has directed both the Accountant and Supply Officer to exert 
more effort in the process of reconciling all PPE acquisitions and disposals made by the 
Campus.  Possible issues identified at the onset of reconciliation were: (a) improper 
accounting of unserviceable PPE; (b) not capitalizing the cost of major repairs and 
improvements; and (c) the inclusion of the newly constructed buildings on the RPCPPE 



56 

 

which is funded by the Main Campus.  Likewise, the Accountant and the Supply Officer 
assured the Audit Team that periodic reconciliation will be made until significant variance 
are fully eliminated. 
 
Moreover, Management will comply with the rest of the audit recommendations. 
 
Rosario Campus 
 
The Campus Administrator has ordered the Inventory Committee, together with the 
Accounting and Property Offices personnel, to expedite the recovery, review and analysis of 
the records of prior year’s transactions to determine the unreconciled difference between the 
accounting records and the RPCPPE, and make the necessary adjustment in the books to 
come up with the accurate and reliable balance of PPE in the financial statements. Likewise, 
the Campus Administrator also has ordered the Director for Administrative and Finance 
Services to monitor the progress of the reconciliation, and to ensure the reconciliation of 
both records in all future transactions, in accordance with the provisions of GAM for NGAs, 
Volume I. 
 
Auditor’s Rejoinder: 
 
The Audit Team acknowledged Management’s commitment and will monitor full 
implementation of the said audit recommendations.  
 
 

8. The undelivered goods and unfinished projects of Naic and Rosario Campuses as of 
year-end amounting to P1,732,293.30 and P2,033,186.25 were recorded as outright 
expense and assets under the Inventory and Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) 
accounts, respectively, and the corresponding liability were recognized in the books, 
contrary to Sections 2.a, 15 and 44, Chapters 6, 8 and 10 of the Government 
Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I. This 
practice resulted in the overstatement of the affected asset, expense and liability 
accounts by the same amount. 
 
Section 2.a, Chapter 6 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I defines Accounts Payable as: valid and 
legal obligations of NGAs/Operating Units (OUs), for which, goods/services/projects have 
been delivered/rendered/completed and accepted, regardless of the year when these 
obligations were incurred. (bold facing supplied) 
 
Sections 15 and 44 of Chapters 8 and 10, respectively, of the same Manual provide for the 
Procedures in the Receipt, Inspection, Acceptance and Recording of Deliveries of Inventory 
and PPE Items as follows:

The Audit Team reviewed the transactions recorded under Accounts Payable for calendar 
year (CY) 2020 to ascertain its existence and validity as per accounting rules prescribed in 
GAM for NGAs, Volume I.  It was observed that the Accountants of Naic and Rosario 
Campuses record the corresponding liability for the undelivered goods on the basis of POs 



58 

 

without the necessary IAR and DR, and Obligation Request and Status (ORS) for unfinished 
projects, contrary to the aforementioned procedures. 
 
Naic Campus 
 
Review of the Schedules of Accounts Payable as of December 31, 2020, revealed that 
accounts payable totaling P1,732,293.30 (Annex A) consist of undelivered goods and 
unfinished project, which were recorded as outright expenses. Verbal inquiry with the Supply 
Officer likewise disclosed that most of the subject items were delivered only in January and 
February 2021, hence do not constitute valid liability of the Campus as of December 31, 
2020. Furthermore, the recognition of expense accounts is improper considering the said 
goods have not been issued yet to end-users. Verification with the Supply Officer also 
revealed that the Repairs of Superintendent Cottage and Guidance Office are still ongoing. 
 
Rosario Campus 
 
Review of the JEV Nos. GJ 101-20-09-05, GJ 164-20-12-08 and GJ 163-20-12-04 to take 
up accounts payable for CY 2020, revealed a total of P2,033,586.25 (Annex B) undelivered 
items which were recorded as Inventory and PPE accounts as of year-end. Verification with 
the Supply Office likewise revealed that most of the subject items were delivered only in 
January and February 2021, hence do not constitute valid liability of the Campus as of 
December 31, 2020.  
 
The practice of the Accountants in recording liability for undelivered goods and 
uncompleted/unaccepted projects is contrary to Sections 2.a, 15 and 44, Chapters 6, 8 and 
10, respectively, of GAM for NGAs, Volume I. To constitute as valid obligations, said 
goods/services/projects must be delivered/rendered/completed and duly supported with 
necessary documents. Non-compliance with the recording of delivered items resulted in the 
overstatement of affected assets by P2,033,586.25, expense by P1,732,293.30 and liability 
accounts by P3,765,879.55. 
  
We recommended that the Campus Administrators of Naic and Rosario Campuses 
direct the Accountants to: 
 
a. prepare the necessary adjusting journal entry/ies on the affected accounts; 

 
b. record the corresponding liability account as soon as the item/project is     

delivered and accepted based on approved POs/Contracts, IAR and DRs, in 
compliance with Sections 2.a, 15 and 43, Chapters 6, 8 and 10, respectively, of 
GAM for NGAs, Volume I; and 

 
c. stop the practice of recording expenses for goods/services/projects which are yet 

to be delivered/rendered/completed, consistent with accounting rules and 
regulations prescribed in the same Manual for NGAs, Volume I. 

 
 
 
 
 
 



59 

 

Management’s Comments: 
 
Naic Campus 
 
The Campus Administrator has directed the Accountant to make the necessary journal 
entry/ies to adjust the affected accounts.  Likewise, they will comply with the rest of the audit 
recommendations. 
 
Rosario Campus 
 
The Campus Administrator has directed the Accountant to prepare the necessary adjusting 
entries on affected accounts to correct the ending balances as of December 31, 2020.  also, 
the Accountant was reminded to strictly comply with the provisions of GAM to avoid the 
over/understatement of accounts in the financial statements. 
 
Auditor’s Rejoinder: 
 
The Audit Team acknowledged Management’s commitment and will monitor full 
implementation of the said audit recommendations. 
 
 

9. General claims thru Automated Teller Machine (ATM) for salaries, allowances and 
other forms of compensation totaling P145,225,773.45 were unsupported with Payroll 
Registers and Letter to the Bank to credit employees’ account of their claims, 
contrary to Items 4.2, 5.2, 5.3 and 5.11 of Commission on Audit (COA) Circular No. 
2012-001. This prevented the Audit Team to verify the propriety and correctness of 
actual amounts credited to the employees’ account. Moreover, there was no evidence 
that the said claims were actually received by the concerned employees. 
 
COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012, prescribes the Guidelines and 
Documentary Requirements for Common Government Transactions.  
 
Items 4.2, 5.2, 5.3 and 5.11 of the same Circular enumerate the supporting documents that 
should be attached to the Disbursement Vouchers, to wit: 
 

“4.2   Salary - General Claims through the Automated Teller Machine (ATM) 
  

 Salary Payroll 
 Payroll Register (hard and softcopy) (boldfacing ours) 
 Letter to the Bank to credit employees’ account of their salaries or 

other claims (boldfacing ours) 
 Validated deposit slips   

 
5.2   Representation and Transportation Allowances (RATA) - General Claims  

  
 RATA Payroll 
 Payroll Register (hard and softcopy)  
 Letter to the Bank to credit employees’ account of their salaries or 

other claims  
 Validated deposit slip, if applicable  



60 

 

 
5.3   Clothing/Uniform Allowance - General Claims  

  
 Clothing/Uniform Allowance Payroll 
 Payroll Register (hard and softcopy)  
 Letter to the Bank to credit employees’ account of their salaries or 

other claims  
 Validated deposit slip, if applicable  

 
5.11   Year-End Bonus (YEB) and Cash Gift (CG) - General Claims  

  
 YEB and CG Payroll 
 Payroll Register (hard and softcopy)  
 Letter to the Bank to credit employees account of their YEB and 

CG claims  
 Deposit slips”  (boldfacing ours) 

 
Post-audit of selected transactions pertaining to payment of salaries, representation 
and transportation allowance (RATA), clothing allowance and mid-year bonus for the period 
January to September 2020 revealed that general claims of employees thru ATM were 
unsupported with complete documentation, such as payroll registers and letter to the bank 
to credit employees’ account.  
 
It also disclosed employees’ claims totaling P145,225,773.45 (Annex C) which lacked the 
afore-cited documents as required under Items 4.2, 5.2, 5.3 and 5.11 of COA Circular No. 
2012-001. The Audit Team observed that the disbursement vouchers for payment of 
salaries were supported only with approved payrolls, certification from Human Resources 
Department on actual days/hours rendered, Daily Time Records (DTRs) and 
accomplishment reports. Other allowances and compensation were likewise supported with 
approved payrolls only.  
 
Inquiry with the Accountant revealed that she was unaware of the guidelines prescribed in 
the pertinent provisions of COA Circular No. 2012-001, particularly the attachment of payroll 
registers in the disbursement vouchers to support employees’ general claims thru ATM. 
Nevertheless, she committed to strictly observe the guidelines on the required 
documentation as prescribed in the aforementioned Circular. 
 
The lack of payroll registers and letter/s to the bank to credit employees’ account prevented 
the Audit Team to verify the propriety and correctness of actual amounts credited to the 
employees’ accounts. Likewise, there was no evidence that the said claims were actually 
received by the concerned employees. 

 
We recommended that the University President instruct the Accountant to submit to 
the Audit Team the Payroll Registers (hard and softcopy) and Letter/s to the Bank to 
credit employees’ account of their salaries, or other claims on the subject 
disbursements for post-audit purposes. Moreover, direct the Accountant to strictly 
observe the required documentation in the processing of employees’ general claims 
for salaries, allowances and other forms of compensation as prescribed in COA 
Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012. 
 



61 

 

Management’s Comments: 
 

The University President has already instructed the Accountant to submit to the Audit Team 
the above-mentioned documents, and to ensure strict compliance with the documentary 
requirements prescribed in COA Circular No. 2012-001. 
 
Auditor’s Rejoinder: 
 

The Audit Team acknowledged Management’s commitment and will monitor full 
implementation of the said audit recommendations. 
 
 

10. Purchases of materials and payment of internet and other operating expenses of 
Cavite State University (CvSU)-Rosario Campus totaling P171,803.00 were made thru 
cash advances (CAs) to the Special Disbursing Officer when the same can be paid 
through checks. This practice resulted in: (a) granting of additional CAs despite non-
liquidation of previous CAs given to him; (b) transferring of cash advances to another 
Accountable Officer; and (c) non-liquidation of special CAs within 20 days from 
accomplishment of the purpose, in violation of Items 4.1.2, 4.1.6 and 4.3.2 of 
Commission on Audit (COA) Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997, and Item 1.0 
of COA Circular No. 2012-004 dated November 28, 2012. Likewise, the mode of 
procurement made was not in accordance with Sections 53.2 and 53.9 of the 2016 
Revised Implementing Rules and Regulation (RIRR) of Republic Act (RA) No. 9184. 

 
COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997, prescribes the Rules and Regulations 
on the granting, utilization and liquidation of CAs. Specific provisions under Item 4 of the 
said Circular states the rules on granting and utilization of CAs, as follows: 

 
“xxx 
 
4.1.2 No additional cash advances shall be allowed to any official or employee 
unless the previous cash advance given to him is first settled or a proper 
accounting thereof is made. 
 
xxx 
 
4.1.6 Transfer of cash advance from one Accountable Officer (AO) to another 
shall not be allowed. 
 
4.3.2 The cash advance shall not be used for payment or regular expenses, such 
as rentals, subscriptions, light and water and the like.” 

 
Likewise, Item 1.0 of COA Circular No. 2012-004 requires the liquidation of special purpose 
and time bound activity within 20 days from accomplishment of the purpose. 
 
Section 53 of the 2016 RIRR of RA No. 9184 provides for Negotiated Procurement as a 
method of procurement of Goods, Infrastructure Projects and Consulting services, whereby 
the Procuring Entity directly negotiates a contract with a technically, legally and financially 
capable supplier, contractor or consultant in any of the following cases: 

 



62 

 

“xxx 
 
53.2. Emergency Cases. In case of imminent danger to life or property during a 
state of calamity, or when time is of the essence arising from natural or man-
made calamities or other causes where immediate action is necessary to prevent 
damage to or loss of life or property, or to restore vital public services, 
infrastructure facilities and other public utilities. In the case of Infrastructure 
Projects, the Procuring Entity has the option to undertake the project through 
negotiated procurement or by administration or, in high security risk areas, 
through the AFP. 
 
xxx 
 
53.9. Small Value Procurement. Procurement of Goods, Infrastructure Projects 
and Consulting Services, where the amount involved does not exceed the 
threshold prescribed in Annex ‘H’ of this IRR: Provided, that in case of Goods, 
the procurement does not fall under shopping in Section 52 of this IRR.”  
 

For CY 2020, the Campus Administrator was granted cash advances for special purpose 
due to limited number of permanent and bonded personnel who can perform disbursing 
functions. Post-audit of cash advances for Special Disbursing Officer (SDO) for calendar 
year (CY) 2020 revealed deficiencies in the granting of CAs. The detail are shown below:

       Total P171,803.00  

 
 Payments of materials for special project totaling P81,883.00 were made through CA 

although the same is already part of the regular activity of External and Business Office, 
inconsistent with Item 4.3.2 of COA Circular No. 97-002. Verbal inquiry with the 
Accountant disclosed that Management resorted to procurement of materials through CA 
due to urgency of orders; 
  

 Payment of regular expenses such as internet expense and other operating expenses of 
the Campus totaling P18,000.00 and P71,920.00, respectively, were paid through CAs 
when the same can be paid through checks; 
  

 Additional CAs were granted to the SDO even though his previous CAs were not yet 
liquidated, thereby resulting in accumulation of unliquidated CAs, in violation of Item 
4.1.2 of the same Circular;  
  

 Review of liquidation reports for the aforementioned CAs revealed that the Campus 
Administrator transfers his CAs to another accountable officer (AO) for disbursement of 
the latter, contrary to Item 4.1.6 of the same Circular. It was observed that Box A of the 
liquidation reports, which must be signed by the employee/officer who was granted the 
cash advance, was signed by another AO instead of the Campus Administrator himself; 
and   

 
 As shown in the preceding schedule, the SDO was unable to liquidate most of his 

special CAs within 20 days from accomplishment of the purpose. As of reporting date, 
four of the subject CAs remained unliquidated even if the purpose for which they were 
granted have already been served, contrary to Item 1.0 of COA Circular No. 2012-004. 

 
Furthermore, the practice resorted to by Management in procuring materials for its special 
projects runs counter to the provisions of Item 4.3.2 of COA Circular No. 97-002 and the 
RIRR of RA No. 9184 for the reasons cited on the next page.  

 
 The production of several products to be sold to Campus’ clients and customers forms 

part of the regular activity of External and Business Office, thus the urgency of orders 
was not an excuse for non-compliance with the established rules and regulations on the 
granting of CAs; and 
 

 There was no Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) Resolution recommending the use of 
Negotiated Procurement to the Head of the Procuring Entity (HoPE) as required under 
Section 12.1 of the IRR to justify the procurement as falling under emergency cases per 



64 

 

Section 53.2 of the same IRR. Neither was there a request for Small Value Procurement 
(SVP) from the end-user and BAC Resolution recommending the same to justify the use 
of alternative mode of procurement per Section 53.9 of the same IRR. Hence, the 
procurement of materials was undertaken by the end-user thru CAs without following the 
proper procedures for alternative modes. 

 
Procurement of materials should be included in the Annual Procurement Plan (APP), thus 
Management should set a lead time from procurement up to sale of finished products to 
avoid resorting their purchases through CAs.  
 
The above deficiencies indicate Management’s leniency in observing the rules and 
regulations on the granting, utilization and liquidation of special cash advances as 
prescribed in COA Circular Nos. 97-002 and 2012-004, which resulted in delayed 
liquidations and unliquidated CAs. Consequently, due to improper granting of CAs, the 
mode of procurement used was not in accordance with the procedures for alternative mode 
per the Revised IRR of RA No. 9184. 
 
We recommended that the Campus Administrator of Rosario Campus: 
 
a. stop the practice of: (a) allowing the grant of special CAs under his name on 

account of purchases of materials, and payment of internet and other operating 
expenses which can be paid through checks; (b) granting of additional CAs 
despite non-liquidation of previous CAs; and (c) transferring of CAs to another 
Accountable Officer, in compliance with the rules and regulations on the granting 
and utilization of CAs as prescribed under Items 4.1.2, 4.1.6 and 4.3.2 of COA 
Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997;  

  
b. liquidate his CAs within 20 days from accomplishment of the purpose as required 

under Item 1.0 of COA Circular No. 2012-004 dated November 28, 2012; and 
  
c. direct the Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) to strictly comply with the 

procurement procedures in the procurement of goods. As a general rule, all 
procurement should be subjected to public bidding, except for those allowed to 
be undertaken through alternative mode, as recommended by the BAC, pursuant 
to 2016 Revised IRR of RA No. 9184. 

 
Management’s Comments: 
 
The Campus Administrator, thru the Director for Administrative and Finance Services, has 
issued a memorandum directing all unit heads and coordinators to prepare and submit their 
respective purchase request at least one month prior to the conduct of their activities to 
minimize the granting of unnecessary CAs for Campus activities, and in order to comply with 
all the provisions of COA Circular No. 97-002. Also, all requestors were reminded to submit 
all supporting documents as soon as possible to complete the liquidation process of all 
unliquidated CAs as of December 31, 2020. 
 
Moreover, the Campus Administrator reminded the BAC and the Procurement Unit to strictly 
implement the rules and procedures provided in 2016 Revised IRR of RA No. 9184.

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 
 
The Audit Team acknowledged Management’s commitment and will monitor full 
implementation of the said audit recommendations. 
 
 

11. Fund transfers to Cooperating State Universities and Colleges (SUCs) totaling 
P6,434,000.70, which have been outstanding for more than two years, remained 
unliquidated as of year-end due to the inability of the concerned Cooperating 
Agencies to liquidate and submit the Financial/Terminal Reports, contrary to the 
provisions stated in the Memoranda of Agreement (MOA) and Section 5.4 of COA 
Circular No. 94-013. This also affects the reliability of Due from National Government 
Agencies (NGAs) account as reported in the financial statements.  
 
The Main Campus has entered into several MOA with Cooperating SUCs and Research and 
Development Institute (RDI) for the implementation of Department of Science and 
Technology-Philippine Council for Agriculture, Aquatic and Natural Resources Research and 
Development (DOST-PCAARRD)-funded programs, namely: “Creating Growth in the 
Countryside through Development of Appropriate Technologies on Coffee Production and 
Processing Projects 1 and 2” and “Enhancing and Operationalizing Intellectual Property (IP) 
Management and Business Development Office in Consortia Member Agencies” in calendar 
year (CY) 2016. The MOA specifically provides the implementation of the two programs, the 
Cavite State University (CvSU) being the lead agency, the PCAARRD as funding and 
monitoring agency, and several SUCs and RDI as the Cooperating/Collaborating agencies. 
 
The MOA provides, among others, the following obligations of Cooperating Agencies to the 
CvSU as regards to the submission of financial reports: 
 

“Submit to CvSU the following financial reports: 
 

 Quarterly financial report using DOST Form No. 4 certified correct by the 
Agency Accountant and approved by the agency head within two weeks 
after each project quarter. 
  

 Terminal audited financial report (TAFR) using DOST Form No. 9B within 
two (2) months after project completion. The reported unexpended 
balance shall be refunded to PCAARRD through CvSU.”  

 
Section 5.4 of COA Circular No. 94-013 states that “The Source Agency (SA) shall require 
the Implementing Agency (IA) to submit the required reports and furnish the IA with a copy 
of the journal voucher taking up the expenditures.” 

 
Per review of the Statement of Financial Position and other supporting documents, the Audit 
Team noted that the reported balance of Due from NGAs account as of December 31, 2020, 
amounting to P6,806,014.95, and the Revised Status Report of Fund Transfer as of 
December 31, 2020, totaling P7,464,486.30, showed an unreported difference of 
P658,471.35. This amount pertains to a correction of the Due from NGAs account accruing 
to Mindanao State University. Nevertheless, this variance was disclosed in the Notes to 
Financial Statements of the Main Campus and for adjustment in CY 2021.  
 



66 

 

Hence, the amount of P7,464,486.30 represents unliquidated fund transfers of CvSU to 
Cooperating Agencies for the implementation of the aforementioned projects. Out of this 
amount, P6,434,000.70 or 86.19 percent pertains to fund transfers to Cooperating SUCs 
which are outstanding for more than two years and remained unliquidated as of year-end. 
The details are shown in the table below:

The duration of the collaboration for the project “Creating Growth in the Countryside through 
Development of Appropriate Technologies on Coffee Production and Processing Projects 1 
and 2” was for a period of one year or until intended milestones had been achieved. 
However, after more than three years, the fund transfers remained unliquidated and terminal 
financial reports were not submitted to the CvSU. The project was already terminated as of 
December 31, 2018. This condition also contributed to the inability of the CvSU to liquidate 
funds received from the PCAARRD for the implementation of the aforecited projects under 
the Due to NGAs account. 
 
The project “Enhancing and Operationalizing Intellectual Property (IP) Management and 
Business Development Office in Consortia Member Agencies” commenced implementation 
in 2017. However, accounting records show that out of the nine cooperating agencies, the 
University of the Philippines-Los Baños did not submit the required financial reports for 
liquidation purposes. It was also observed that additional funds were transferred to 
Cooperating Agencies even if they have existing unliquidated balance.  
 
The Project Leader justified that they notified the project staff of the respective Cooperating 
Agencies several times. However, only four participating SUCs had submitted the Terminal 
Financial Reports, and the rest remained unsubmitted.  He further explained that the 
PCAARRD, as funding agency, will transfer the fund directly to the Cooperating Agencies in 
CY 2021.  
 
This audit observation is a reiteration of prior year’s audit observation in view of the partial 
implementation by Management. 



67 

 

 
The non-submission of Financial Reports (FRs) caused by the non-compliance of the 
Cooperating Agencies with their obligations in the MOA counters the rules provided in Section 
5.4 of COA Circular No. 94-013. Moreover, this also affected the reliability of Due from NGAs 
account as reported in the financial statements. 
 
We recommended that the University President direct the Vice-President (VP) for 
Research and Extension and concerned Project Leaders to:  

 
a. send follow-up letters to enforce submission of financial/liquidation reports by the 

concerned cooperating agencies, as well as the terminal reports of the projects, 
and/or require refund of the unused funds, if there are any, copy furnished the 
funding agency for monitoring purposes;  

 
b. request the funding agency to directly release subsequent fund transfers to 

cooperating agencies, to mitigate the burden caused by non-liquidation of funds 
by the latter, which ultimately affects the CvSU’s ability to liquidate to the funding 
agency; and 

 
c. adopt an effective scheme to monitor strict compliance by the cooperating 

agencies with their obligations as stated in the MOA. 
 
Management’s Comments: 
 
The University President, thru the Office of the VP for Research and Extension, already sent 

follow-up letters to enforce submission of financial, liquidation and terminal reports by the 

concerned agencies. 

Moreover, recent fund transfers made by the PCAARRD has already been released directly 
to the cooperating agency. However, other agencies have yet to do the same despite the 
request. 
 
Auditor’s Rejoinder: 
 
The Audit Team acknowledged Management’s commitment and will monitor full 
implementation of the said audit recommendations. 
 
 

12. The Cavite State University (CvSU) Research Grant given to the CvSU faculty 
researchers on separate tranches lack sufficient guidelines on the granting, 
utilization and liquidation of the funds, thus preventing the audit and verification of 
project results/outputs.  Moreover, the grant given to 26 officials and employees 
totaling P2,639,688.50 representing research grants were improperly recorded as 
outright expenses, instead of receivables from the researchers, contrary to Chapter 3 
of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies 
(NGAs), Volume III. 

 
Chapter 3 of GAM for NGAs, Volume III provides the description of accounts that will enable 
the agency to properly recognize and record its financial transactions, to wit, 
 



68 

 

“Other Receivables. This account is used to recognize amount due from debtors 
and other agencies not falling under any of the specific receivable account. This 
also includes receivables from individuals or entities intended for specific projects 
or purpose not falling under any of the specific receivable account. Credit this 
account for payment/liquidation of receivables. 
 
Research, Exploration and Development Expenses. This account is used to 
recognize the cost incurred in the conduct of studies to gain scientific or technical 
knowledge on future projects including development, refinement or evaluation of 
policies for use of management. This account shall be closed to the Revenue 
and Expense Summary account.” 

 
With the aspiration of becoming a global university, the CvSU is promoting research and 
development activities in every discipline through awarding of Research Grants. These 
grants aim to support quality and sustainability of research activities in the CvSU, which in 
turn, support scholarly pursuits, nurture creativity and innovation, and promote a research 
culture in the CvSU. 
 
In line with this, the Board approved a resolution on the creation of “CvSU Research Grant 
(CRG)” and the allotment of P3,000,000.00 from the CvSU’s Income. It sets forth the 
overview of the CvSU Research Grant, including the Proposal Format, Deadline of Proposal 
Submission, Estimated Date of Awarding of Grant, Amount of Grant and Duration, 
Mechanism of Evaluation, Monitoring and Evaluation, and Terminal Report. It is further 
stated therein that “The grant money shall be subject to usual COA auditing rules and 
guidelines”. However, no documents were forwarded to the Audit Team for review apart 
from the Disbursement Vouchers (DVs) and payrolls for the payment of Research Grant. 
 
For calendar year (CY) 2020, the Main Campus disbursed a total of P2,639,688.50 
representing Research Grants to faculty/employee researchers, which were recorded under 
the account Research, Exploration and Development Expense. 
 
Post-audit of DVs and General Ledger (GL) showed that these researches have varying 
timelines of less than a year to two years until completion of the project.  However, the DVs 
were not properly supported by contracts, proposals, and other documentary requirements. 
There were also no sufficient guidelines on the grant, utilization and liquidation of the funds, 
which prevented the Audit Team in verifying the use of the disbursed government funds and 
the results/outputs thereof. The details of the grants expensed are as follows:

Moreover, at the onset of the research, grants awarded to several employees were 
improperly recorded as Research, Exploration and Development Expense. This is contrary 
to the descriptive information provided by GAM, Volume III, which states that the 
aforementioned expense account shall be “used to recognize the cost incurred in the 
conduct of studies to gain scientific or technical knowledge on future projects including 
development, refinement or evaluation of policies for use of management.” (emphasis 
supplied) 
 
Hence, the Audit Team would like to emphasize that since the nature of the grant is the 
same as the fund transfers being made by other NGAs to State Universities and Colleges 



70 

 

(SUCs) in the form of special projects, it is proper that the said grants be recorded as a 
Receivable rather than an expense. This is to properly monitor disbursement and liquidation 
of funds granted to researchers, procurement and/or development of necessary equipment 
or systems and existence of outputs through research papers. 
 
We recommended that the University President: 

 
a. instruct the Office of the VP for Research and Extension to be keen in the 

monitoring and approval of grants to researchers, and to set out sufficient 
guidelines on the granting, utilization and liquidation of the funds; and, 
 

b. direct the Accountant to reclassify the entries made on the disbursed funds, and 
to properly account them to either current or non-current receivables, consistent 
with Chapter 3 of GAM for NGAs, Volume III. 

 
Management’s Comments: 
 

The University President has already instructed the Office of the VP for Research and 
Extension in the monitoring and approval of grants. Consequently, the Office of the VP for 
Research and Extension has started to review its guidelines, especially for utilization and 
liquidation of grants to be revised as needed. 
 
Moreover, the University President has already directed the Accountant to prepare the 
necessary entry to reclassify initial recording made, consistent with Chapter 3 of GAM for 
NGAs, Volume III. 
 
Auditor’s Rejoinder: 
 

The Audit Team acknowledged Management’s commitment and will monitor full 
implementation of the said audit recommendations. 
 
 

13. The Accountant did not maintain Subsidiary Ledgers (SLs) for the controlling 
accounts in the General Ledger (GL), contrary to Section 12, Chapter 2 of the 
Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), 
Volume I, Appendix 6 of the same Manual for NGAs, Volume II, and Sections 111 and 
121 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445, known as the Government Auditing Code of 
the Philippines.  Thus, check and balance of the accounts in the financial statements 
could not be easily ascertained. 
 
Section 12, Chapter I of GAM for NGAs, Volume I prescribes the books of accounts to be 
maintained by the National Government entities consisting of the following: 
  

c.    “Journals 
1. General Journals 
2. Cash Receipts Journals 
3. Cash Disbursement Journals 
4. Check Disbursement Journals 

 
 



71 

 

d. Ledgers 
1. General Ledgers 
2. Subsidiary Ledgers (Appendix 6)” (boldfacing supplied) 

 
Moreover, Volume II of the same Manual for NGAs provides for the required Accounting 
Books, Registries, Records, Forms and Reports, which includes the Subsidiary Ledger, to 
wit: 

 
“Appendix 6. Subsidiary Ledger (SL) – 

 
Instructions. 

 
A. This ledger shows detail for each control account in the GL which is 

maintained per account and fund cluster by the Accounting Division/Unit. 
 
xxx. 
 
C.  At the end of each month, after all transactions in the journals have been 

posted, the debit and credit columns of each account shall be footed in 
pencil and the balance indicated in ink.  The totals of the SL balances 
shall be reconciled with the corresponding GL controlling account. 

 
D.  At the end of the fiscal year, each SL shall be ruled and closed.  All totals 

shall be written legibly in ink and the balance of the account carried 
forward as the opening balance of the new SL for the next fiscal year.” 

 
Furthermore, pertinent provisions of PD No. 1445 set forth: 

 
“Section 111.  Keeping of accounts. 

 
1. The accounts of an agency shall be kept in such detail as is necessary to 

meet the needs of the agency and at the same time be adequate to 
furnish the information needed by fiscal or control agencies of the 
government. 
 

2. The highest standard of honesty, objectivity and consistency shall be 
observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate or 
misleading information.” 

 
Section 121. Financial Reports and Statements. 

 
“xxx 

 
2. The financial statements shall be based on official accounting records kept in 

accordance with law and the generally accepted accounting principles and 
standards.”  

 
The SL (Annex E) is a book of final entry showing the details of the balances of controlling 
accounts appearing in the GL. Postings to the SL originate from source documents. Some of 
the GL accounts which should be supported with SL are Cash accounts totaling 



72 

 

P1,346,926,084.50, Receivables amounting to P585,934,059.40, Inventories of 
P1,685,693.53, Advances of P450,775.04, Prepayments of P16,487,542.67 and Property, 
Plant and Equipment (PPE) of P1,017,922,254.52, among others, as of December 31, 2020.  
The totals of SL balances are reconciled with their respective accounts at the end of each 
month and a statement thereon is prepared periodically to support the corresponding 
controlling General Ledger accounts. 

 
For the audit of CY 2020 accounts and transactions, the Audit Team conducted tracing of 
accounting entries and verification of balances reported in the financial statements as of 
December 31, 2020. However, the Accountant was only able to present SLs for the Cash in 
Bank, which is still incomplete, and Advances to Contractors accounts.  

 
On March 25, 2021, the Audit Team requested certified true copies of SLs maintained by the 
Accountant on all controlling accounts, to validate the existence of the SL and the accuracy 
of the amount recorded in the GL. However, no certified true copies of SLs for other 
accounts were submitted as of report date. 
  
The absence of SLs for the controlling accounts in the General Ledger, particularly those 
that are highly volatile and inherently risky, such as Cash accounts, Receivables, Advances, 
Inventory, Construction in Progress, PPE and other accounts, made it difficult for the Audit 
Team to reconcile financial information and establish accountability over them. Thus, the 
accuracy, completeness and reliability of the balances reported in the financial statements 
cannot be ascertained. 

 
We recommended that the University President instruct the Accountant to maintain 
separate SLs for all controlling accounts in the GL, pursuant to Section 12, Chapter 2 
of GAM for NGAs, Volume I, and Appendix 6 of the same Manual for NGAs, Volume II, 
and the pertinent provisions of PD No. 1445.  
 
Management’s Comments: 
 
The University President has already directed the Accounting Office to comply with the 
recommendations of the Audit Team. 
 
Auditor’s Rejoinder: 
 
The Audit Team acknowledged Management’s commitment and will monitor full 
implementation of the said audit recommendations. 
 
 

14. Management of Cavite State University (CvSU)-Rosario Campus did not impose 
liquidated damages on late deliveries of supplies, equipment and other materials 
totaling P1,053,407.00 with delays ranging from seven to 154 days. This is contrary to 
Item 3, Annex D of the 2016 Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (RIRR) of 
Republic Act (RA) No. 9184, which is manifestly disadvantageous to the government. 
 
Annex D of the 2016 RIRR of RA No. 9184 prescribes the Contract Implementation 
Guidelines for the Procurement of Goods, Supplies and Materials. Item 3, Annex D of the 
same Act provides for the imposition of liquidated damages, as follows:  
 



73 

 

“xxx 
 
3. Liquidated Damages 
 
3.1. When the supplier fails to satisfactorily deliver goods under the contract 
within the specified delivery schedule, inclusive of duly granted time extensions, 
if any, the supplier shall be liable for damages for the delay and shall pay 
the procuring entity liquidated damages, not by way of penalty, an amount 
equal to one-tenth (1/10) of one percent (1%) of the cost of the delayed 
goods scheduled for delivery for every day of delay until such goods are finally 
delivered and accepted by the procuring entity concerned.  
 
3.2. The procuring entity need not prove that it has incurred actual damages to 
be entitled to liquidated damages. Such amount shall be deducted from any 
money due or which may become due to the supplier, or collected from any 
securities or warranties posted by the supplier, whichever is convenient to the 
procuring entity concerned. In no case shall the total sum of liquidated damages 
exceed ten percent (10%) of the total contract price, in which event the procuring 
entity concerned may rescind the contract and impose appropriate sanctions 
over and above the liquidated damages to be paid.”  (bold facing supplied) 
 

Post-audit of the disbursement vouchers pertaining to procurement transactions of the 
Campus revealed several delays in the delivery of goods with period ranging from seven to 
154 days as shown in Annex F. 
 
Review of supporting documents showed that the subject transactions were not issued with 
time extensions nor supported with letters from the suppliers explaining the reasons for 
incurring delays in the delivery of the said supplies, equipment and other materials. 
 
Notwithstanding the failure of the concerned suppliers to satisfactorily deliver goods within 
the specified delivery schedule per approved purchase orders, the concerned 
officers/employees did not impose liquidated damages from the amounts due to them, 
contrary to Item 3, Annex D of the 2016 RIRR of RA No. 9184. Clearly, the penalty clause in 
the Purchase Orders specifically the imposition of one-tenth of one percent for every day of 
delay on the undelivered item/s was not observed by Management, to the disadvantage of 
the government. 
 
We recommended that the Campus Administrator of Rosario Campus direct the 
concerned officers/employees to: (a) compute the corresponding liquidated damages 
on the subject purchases, and deduct the amount from any money due or which may 
become due to the suppliers; and (b) strictly monitor the delivery of goods by the 
suppliers within the specified delivery schedule as indicated in the approved 
contract/purchase orders; in case of default, impose liquidated damages in 
accordance with Item 3, Annex D of the 2016 RIRR of RA No. 9184. 
 
Management’s Comments: 
 
The Campus Administrator directed the concerned employees to strictly comply with the 
abovementioned audit recommendations. Likewise, the Director for Administrative and 
Finance Services directed the Supply Office personnel to look into the factors that caused 



74 

 

the delayed deliveries, and require justifications from suppliers why the goods were not 
delivered within the specified schedule. 
 
Auditor’s Rejoinder: 
 
The Audit Team acknowledged Management’s commitment and will monitor full 
implementation of the said audit recommendations. 
 
 

15. Donations of three-layer washable face masks sourced from internally funded COVID-
19 response project of the Cavite State University (CvSU)-Rosario Campus were not 
supported with report of inventory, and were not properly accounted for, contrary to 
Item II, 1.a.2 of Commission on Audit (COA) Circular No. 2020-009 and Sections 3 and 
7, Chapter 8 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government 
Agencies (NGAs), Volume I. Consequently, understating the Inventory Account on the 
amount of the undistributed masks. Furthermore, the sale of 3,000 pieces face masks 
funded under Fund 164 (Special Trust Fund) was done by the Research and 
Extension Office, despite the absence of such undertaking per approved project 
proposal, contrary to Item v.1, Section 3 of Commission on Higher Education (CHED) 
Memorandum Order (MO) No. 20, s. 2011 and Section 4.g of the CvSU Manual of 
Operations. 
 
COA Circular No. 2020-009 dated April 21, 2020, prescribes the temporary relaxation in the 
application of certain provisions of COA Circular No. 2014-002 dated April 15, 2014 and 
COA Memorandum No. 2014-009 dated August 28, 2014, in areas subject to quarantine 
during the period of State of Calamity declared under Proclamation No. 929 dated March 16, 
2020. 
 
Item II of the same Circular provides for certain guidelines, as follows: 
 

“2. To ensure that the aids and donations received by the recipient agencies 
during the quarantine are properly accounted for, the recipient agencies shall be 
required to submit a Summary/List of Donations Received, Distributed and 
Balances. The Summary/List should be categorized (i.e food, medical supplies, 
medicines, etc.) and can be submitted within (10) working days after the end of 
the quarantine, or if the quarantine exceeds three (3) months, within ten (10) 
working days after the end of each quarter, supported with: 

   
(1) acknowledgement receipts of the donations in-kind; 
(2) proof of receipt by and distribution to the beneficiaries, not necessarily in 
the required form; and 
(3) inventory of remaining undistributed items, if any.”  (bold facing 
supplied) 

  
Likewise, Sections 3 and 7, Chapter 8 of GAM for NGAs provides: 

 
“Sec. 3. Cost of Inventories. The cost of inventories shall comprise all costs of 
purchase, costs of conversion (materials, labor and overhead) and other costs 
incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition, 
excluding abnormal amounts of wasted materials, labor, other production and 



75 

 

selling costs, administrative overheads that do not contribute to bringing 
inventories to their present location and condition. Trade discounts, rebates, and 
other similar items are deducted in determining the costs of purchase. (Pars. 18, 
19 & 25, PPSAS 12) 
 
xxx 
 
Sec. 7. Recognition as an Expense. When inventories are sold, exchanged, or 
distributed, their carrying amount shall be recognized as an expense in the 
period in which the related revenue is recognized. If there is no related revenue, 
the expense is recognized when the goods are distributed or the related service 
is rendered.” 

 
Moreover, Item v, Section 3 of CHED MO No. 20, series of 2011 defines “Special Trust 
Fund” in accordance with its operational meaning as: 

 
“v) Special Trust Fund (STF) – refers to the income of the SUC arising from the 

collection of tuition fees, miscellaneous fees, service and other income. This 
is broken down into: 

 
(1) Tuition Fees for use by the SUC in carrying out its trifocal function: 
instruction, research and extension, and production, as well as defray its 
administrative costs (general administrative support);” (emphasis supplied) 

 
Furthermore, Section 4 of the CvSU Manual of Operations sets the specific goals of Office of 
Business Affairs (OBA): 

 
“1.) The Office of Business Affairs focuses its effort to raise income through the 

following thrusts and concerns: 
 

 xxx 
 
 Under Fund 163 

 
xxx 
 
 f.) Rentals and Concessions 
g.) Marketing and Trading Center  
h.) Student Housing Unit 
i.) University Services Unit 
j.) Coffee Trading and Processing”  (bold facing supplied) 

 
In light of the recent Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic, CvSU-Rosario Campus 
initiated an internally funded response project to provide new technologies and devices, 
including ergo-face masks, which intends to help protect the community while curbing the 
effects and spread of COVID-19 thru provision of projects/livelihood to the extension 
beneficiaries.

Review of the internally funded COVID-19 response project undertaken by the Rosario 
Campus disclosed that distribution of face masks were not properly substantiated as of 
report date. Schedule of distribution of re-washable masks is presented hereunder:

Total        6,514      

 
Out of 6,514 pieces, the 1,964 remaining washable masks were not substantiated by 
inventory report, contrary to the set of guidelines provided by Item II of COA Circular No. 
2020-009 dated April 21, 2020. 
 
Likewise, no proper accounting was made to record the cost of produced masks. Entries 
were outright Other Supplies and Materials Expense Account, for the purchase and 
issuance of raw materials, and Labor and Wages, for the payment of assembly of the 
washable face masks, instead of using Inventory Held for Sale and for Distribution Accounts 
and Cost of Sales (or Goods Manufactured) Account. Hence, understating the Inventory and 
the related Cost of Sales (or Goods Manufactured) and overstating the aforementioned 
expense accounts on the amount of the remaining face masks in the Campus’s custody. 
 
Inquiry made with the Accountant revealed that no supporting documents were forwarded to 
their Office as basis of recording of the items. Thus, remain unrecognized in the books.  
 
Furthermore, the Audit Team acknowledges the rationale of the COVID-19 project proposal 
to effectively transfer research outputs for the benefit of the community and the extension 
beneficiaries, being one of the State University and College (SUCs)’s trifocal function 
mandated under the use of Special Trust Fund.  
 



77 

 

However, it is noted that 3,000 face masks were sold to the Central Student Government of 
Rosario Campus and CvSU-Main Campus, despite the unconditional transfer made to other 
organizations and communities. The Audit Team would also like to emphasize that the sales 
transaction carried out using Fund 164 (as shown on the above schedule) by the Research 
and Extension Office, was not in accordance with the mandate of the Special Trust Fund as 
discussed in Item v.1, Section 3 of CHED MO No. 20, s. 2011. 
 
Consequently, if the objective of the project includes revenue raising activities and/or to 
recoup its investment on the project, then it should have been undertaken thru or in 
partnership with the OBA under Fund 163, in compliance with Section 4 of CvSU MO. 
 
We recommended that the Campus Administrator of Rosario Campus:  
 
a. instruct the Proponents of COVID-19 response project to submit the distribution 

report, sales report and inventory report as of December 31, 2020, to the 
Accountant, for proper adjustment of the Inventory account;  

  
b. direct the Accountant to take up the adjusting journal entry/ies on the subject 

Inventory accounts on the basis of the reports submitted, to correct the reported 
balances, and observe strictly the proper recognition of expense as prescribed 
under Sections 3 and 7, Chapter 8 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I; and 

  
c. instruct the Director of Research and Extension Office to refrain from marketing 

Income Generating Projects (IGPs), which are not the directives of his good Office 
and are mandated under the Office of the Business Affairs (OBA). The OBA is the 
appropriate unit which undertakes the management of the IGPs. 

 
Management’s Comments: 
 
The Campus Administrator directed the proponents of the COVID-19 response project to 
submit all the needed reports to the Accountant for proper accounting and recording in the 
books, and for the latter to make the necessary adjusting entries on the journal to arrive at 
the correct balance of the inventory account. The Director for Research and Extension was 
also advised to refrain from marketing IGPs and coordinate such matters to the OBA 
instead. 
 
Auditor’s Rejoinder: 
 
The Audit Team acknowledged Management’s commitment and will monitor full 
implementation of the said audit recommendations. 
 
 
Gender and Development (GAD) Implementation 
 

16. The GAD Resource Center of the CvSU did not comply with the mandatory 
requirement of allocating at least  five percent of the total appropriation for GAD 
programs, projects and activities (PAPs) in calendar year (CY) 2020, contrary to 
Philippine Commission on Women (PCW)-National Economic and Development 
Authority (NEDA)-Department of Budget and Management (DBM) Joint Circular (JC) 
No. 2012-01, thus the deficiency of allocation on the budgetary requirements of the 



78 

 

GAD programs may prevent the CvSU in implementing major programs and activities 
that addresses gender issues, and pursues women’s empowerment and gender 
equality within the organization. 
 
Item 6.1 of PCW-NEDA-DBM JC No. 2012-01 provides: 
 

“At least five percent (5%) of the total agency budget appropriations authorized 
under the annual GAA shall correspond to activities supporting GAD plans and 
programs. The GAD budget shall be drawn from the agency’s maintenance and 
other operating expenses (MOOE), capital outlay (CO), and personal services 
(PS). It is understood that the GAD budget does not constitute an additional 
budget over an agency’s total budget appropriations.” 

  
Furthermore, Item 6.4 of the said JC states that “Attribution to the GAD budget of a portion 
or the whole of the budget of an agency’s major program is a means toward gradually 
increasing the gender responsiveness of government programs and budgets.” 
 
For CY 2020, the CvSU, thru its GAD Focal Point System (GFPS), was able to prepare and 
submit the GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) duly reviewed and endorsed by the PCW. 
However, it was observed that the submitted GPB showed an inadequate allocation based 
on the CvSU’s final budget per General Appropriations Act (GAA) of FY 2020. The details 
are presented hereunder: 
 

 
GAA Allocation 

% of 
Allocation 

Per GPB P  539,851,000.00  P      8,122,579.02  1.50% 

Per Audit 539,851,000.00  26,992,550.00  5.00% 

Overallocation/(Underallocation)   P (18,869,970.98) (3.50%) 

 
Based on the foregoing, although the GPB was updated based on the Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 
GAA, the allocation is still insufficient, with a deficit of 3.50 percent or equivalent to 
P18,869,970.98, contrary to the provisions of PCW-NEDA-DBM JC No. 2012-01, which 
explicitly states that, “At least five percent (5%) of the total agency budget appropriations 
authorized under the annual GAA shall correspond to activities supporting GAD plans and 
programs.” (emphasis supplied) 
 
Moreover, the Audit Team was furnished a copy of the GAD Accomplishment Report (AR) 
for CY 2020, duly approved by the University President. The Audit Team inquired with the 
GAD Focal Persons regarding the submission of GAD AR to the PCW, and she explained 
that the report was already submitted to the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) 
Regional Office No. IV-A for review on February 25, 2021. Thereafter, a representative from 
the PCW notified them thru email that the GAD AR was already endorsed to them by the 
CHED R04A on March 10, 2021.  Copies of the letters notifying them on the status of their 
report were submitted to the Audit Team. 
 
Review of the GAD AR submitted showed that the utilization totaled 103.59 percent of the 
allocation provided by Management. However, this is due to the inability of the GAD 
Resource Center to allocate sufficient budget for GAD PAPs. Should the GPB be revised 



79 

 

based on the required allocation per JC, the total utilization would only be 31.17 percent, 
equivalent to an unexpended amount of P18,578,655.25, as shown below. 
 

  
Utilized Allocation 

Over/ 
(Underutilization) 

% of 
Utilization 

Per GPB P   8,413,894.75  P    8,122,579.02   P         291,315.73  103.59% 

Per Audit  8,413,894.75  26,992,550.00   (18,578,655.25) 31.17% 

  
This deficiency of allocation noted on the budgetary requirements of the GAD programs may 
prevent the Agency in implementing major programs and activities that addresses gender 
issues and pursues women’s empowerment and gender equality within the organization, in 
compliance with Item 6.4 of the said JC. 
 
We recommended that the University President: 
 
a. require the GAD Resource Center, in coordination with OIC-Budget Officer, to 

strictly comply with the budgetary requirements set by PCW-NEDA-DBM JC No. 
2012-01 during planning and budgeting phase; and 
 

b. instruct the GAD Focal Point System, in coordination with the GAD Focal Person, 
to maximize the utilization of GAD funds through the implementation of GAD-
related programs and projects as planned, in order to attain the objective for 
which funds were provided. 

 
Management’s Comments: 
 
The 2020 GPB of the CvSU was prepared in August 2019 and submitted through the 

Gender Mainstreaming Monitoring System (GMMS) for review of the CHED in September 

2019 and to the PCW in October 2019. The original GPB of the CvSU strictly followed the 

budgetary requirements set forth by PCW-NEDA-DBM JC No. 2012-01, but due to the 

COVID-19 pandemic, the PCW released on April 27, 2020, Memorandum Circular (MC) No. 

2020-03 - Adjustment of the GPB to Address COVID-19.  

In view of this PCW MC No. 2020-03, the GAD-RC, together with the members of the GAD 
TWG, met in May 2020 and discussed the adjustments to be made on the said 2020 GPB. A 
lot of GAD activities included in the first GPB submitted to the PCW were greatly affected 
due to the existing Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) on Emerging Infectious Diseases 
guidelines to prevent the spread of the COVID-19, which restricted the movement of the 
people. The activities to be conducted were limited to online teleconferencing, thus affecting 
the original budget that made allocation for foods, rentals, transportation, accommodation, 
and distribution and printing of information, education and communication (IEC) materials. 
Despite these obstacles, most of the target number of activities and participants were met 
and achieved. 
 
Nevertheless, the University President assured the Audit Team of compliance with the audit 
recommendations.

State Universities and 
Colleges (SUCs) 
totaling P4,117,585.77,

44. Inspection and Accept-
ance Reports (IARs) 
were not submitted by 
the Supply Office to the 
Accounting Unit for 
recording of PPE and 
setting up of payables, 
contrary to Section 15 
of GAM for NGAs, 
Volume I, thus resulted 
in understatement of 
asset and liability 
accounts for the current 
accounting period. 

91. We recommended that 
the University President 
require the Accountant   
to   record the asset as 
soon as it is delivered 
and accepted as 
evidenced by IAR, and 
recognize the 
corresponding liability 
thereon.   

 

The Supply Officer 
had submitted IAR 
to the Accounting 
Office on a monthly 
basis for recording 
of PPE and setting 
up of payables.

cited accounts, pursuant 
to Section 12 of GAM for
