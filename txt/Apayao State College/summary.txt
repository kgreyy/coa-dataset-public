C)	Opinion of the Auditor on the Fairness of Presentation of the Financial Statements



We rendered an unmodified opinion on the fairness of the presentation of the financial statements of the College for the year ended December 31, 2020.



D)	Summary of Significant Observations and Recommendations



The following are the significant observations and recommendations:



1)	The Land account was misstated by ₱1,146,575.00 due to recording of two parcels of land without clear ownership rights. 



We recommended and Management agreed to derecognize the ₱1,146,575.00 cost of the two (2) lots in Cubet Campus under the Land account until a clear proof of ownership is secured by the University; however, the matter shall be disclosed in the Notes to FS.  



2)	Issued items of equipment and furniture and fixtures which falls under the recognition criteria of semi expendable property amounting to ₱1,229,749.00 was recognized as Office and Other Supplies and Materials Expense instead of Semi-expendable Machinery and Equipment and Semi-expendable Furniture and Fixtures expense accounts, contrary to Section 10, Chapter 8 of the Government Accounting Manual for NGAS, Volume I; resulting in the misstatement of the said accounts in the FS.



We recommended and Management agreed to properly classify items of inventory account for accurate account balances in the financial statements at any given period. 



3)	Lack of monitoring of fund transfers from other National Government Agencies resulted in unliquidated funds of prior years amounting to ₱792,401.88; contrary to COA Circular Nos. 94-013 and 2016-005.



We recommended and Management agreed that the Accounting Unit reconcile their records and immediately return the balance of fund transfers to source agencies pursuant to Section 6.7 of COA Circular No. 94-013.



4)	Advance payments of ₱4,520,384.58 were not recouped from the contractors whose projects were rescinded/terminated, contrary to paragraph 4.3 of Annex E of the Revised IRR of RA 9184, which poses the risk of wasting government funds. 



We recommended and Management agreed that steps will be taken for the immediate return of the unrecouped advances or forfeit the corresponding surety bonds posted by the contractors in favor of the government. We further recommended that the agency officials concerned be required to strictly comply with the provisions of existing issuances regarding the recoupment of advance payments made to the contractors. 



5)	The overdue loans granted to the students of Apayao State College under the CHED-Student Financial Assistance Program (StuFAP) and Student Assistance Fund for Education (SAFE) amounting to ₱1,726,136.50 remained uncollected due to Management’s failure to compel and impose sanctions against the defaulting student-borrowers, depriving the government and students of the benefits from the use of the fund had it been collected. 



 We recommended and Management agreed to: 



5.1    require the Accountant to conduct a thorough review and evaluation of the account; after which, exhaust all possible measures of collection which includes the issuance of demand letters, not only to the student-borrowers, but also to the guarantors indicated in the MOA/contract. 



5.2   request for write-off of dormant accounts, following strictly the procedures under COA Circular No. 2016-005. 



6)	Insurance proceeds and excess amounts from proceeds from sale of bid documents amounting to ₱1,054,308.69, were not remitted to the Treasury contrary to regulations; hence, needed funds by the National Government for implementation of its programs and projects remained idle with the College. 



We recommended and Management agreed to remit immediately to the Bureau of Treasury the insurance proceeds from GSIS and the unutilized portion of the proceeds from sale of bid documents. 



7)	Of the total allotments received of ₱166,134,672.00 for CY 2020, ₱158,858,695.53 or 95.60% was obligated; however, only ₱108,361,542.08 or 65.20% thereof was disbursed, mainly due to delayed/non-implementation of four (4) infrastructure projects, contrary to Section 70 of the General Appropriations Act of 2020. 



We recommended and Management agreed to:



	1)	maximize the use of allotments received by ensuring prompt initiation of the procurement process and timely implementation of programs and projects so as to minimize the incurrence of unobligated allotments; and



	2)	supervise and monitor the implementation of programs and projects making sure that the same within the approved timelines. 



8)	The agency did not deduct 80 days of unauthorized leave of absence incurred by regular and casual employees for the period from January 2020 to December 2020, in violation of Rule XVI Section 50 of the Omnibus Rules implementing Book V of EO 292; resulting in over payment of salaries and benefits amounting to ₱116,461.92. 



		        We recommended and Management agreed to: 

		

	1)	strictly monitor, check the completeness of filed application for leave and enforce the provision regarding unauthorized leave of absence; and 

		

	2)	cause the employees who received salary for unauthorized leave of absence to return the amount they received erroneously; 



9)	The agency failed to remit compulsory contributions due to GSIS, PhilHEALTH and HDMF totaling ₱40,018.57 within the prescribed period. Of the amount, ₱8,119.61 pertained to prior years’ under-remittance due to increase in employees’ salaries which was not communicated to said agencies. 



					We recommended and Management agreed to: 

			

	1)		strictly comply in remittance of compulsory contributions within the prescribed period as provided by the mandated provisions; and 

			

	2)		 regularly update GSIS when there are changes in salary of employees in order to avoid under-remittance of contributions. 



10)	The agency did not strictly require the registration and tax compliance requirements of individuals hired under job order, or contract of service agreement, which resulted in the foregone government revenue amounting to ₱505,471.51 representing the unpaid Annual Registration Fee of ₱89,000.00 and unwithheld percentage tax amounting to ₱416,471.51, contrary to Items A.2 and A.10 of Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 51-2018 dated June 8, 2018.



We recommended and Management agreed that the Accounting Unit strictly impose the registration requirements and withhold taxed required from the hired job orders and contract of services in support to the tax collection effort of the government. 



E)	Summary of Total Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges



As of December 31, 2020, the College had ₱2,955,073.36 in unsettled disallowances and ₱442,108.25 in unsettled suspensions.
