Observations and Recommendations



1)	The Land account was misstated by ₱1,146,575.00 due to recording of two parcels of land without clear ownership rights. 



	1)	Section 3 of Chapter 10 of the GAM, Volume 1 on the Criteria for Recognition of PPE requires that the cost of PPE shall be recognized as assets if beneficial ownership and control clearly rest with the recording agency, among others. 



	2)	The College’s Statement of Financial Position has recognized the two (2) occupied land in Cubet an asset of the agency with a total cost of ₱1,146,575.00. 



	3)	Analysis of the account, however, disclosed that the validity of the balance is cannot be readily ascertained in view of the lack of title to support assertion of absolute ownership for the two (2) lots. 



	4)	These lots used as school sites were claimed by the agency to have been purchased by the DPWH in 1998 and eventually donated to the ASC. One (1) lot that has a land area of 8,404 sq.m. is recorded in the books with the value of ₱6,575.00 and another lot has a land area of 10,000 sq.m. and carried at ₱1,140,000.00. 



	5)	The parcel of land costing ₱1,140,000.00 was supported with a Deed of Donation between the DPWH and the then College President while none for the land costing ₱6,575.00. 



	6)	Inquiry with the Property Officer revealed that the said lots are still part of the mother titles of the original private landowners although already declared for tax purposes in the name of DPWH.



	7)	Recording the value of the land with no proof of ownership overstated the land account by ₱1,146,575.00. 



	8)	We recommended and Management agreed to derecognize the ₱1,146,575.00 cost of the two (2) lots in Cubet Campus under the Land account until a clear proof of ownership is secured by the University; however, the matter shall be disclosed in the Notes to FS.  



	9)	During the exit conference, the College President acknowledged that ASC could not assert ownership of the two (2) lots in Cubet until it is transferred to its name. 



	10)	She also informed the audit team that she already directed the Property Officer to prioritize the titling of the lots in Cubet while the original landowners are still alive to prevent possible additional issues and demands from the landowners and wastage of government funds representing the buildings already constructed and still being constructed in the untitled lots which the government may stand to lose in case of dispute. 



2)	Issued items of equipment and furniture and fixtures which falls under the recognition criteria of semi expendable property amounting to ₱1,229,749.00 was recognized as Office and Other Supplies and Materials Expense instead of Semi-expendable Machinery and Equipment and Semi-expendable Furniture and Fixtures expense accounts, contrary to Section 10, Chapter 8 of the Government Accounting Manual for NGAS, Volume I; resulting in the misstatement of the said accounts in the FS.



	1)	Section 10 of Chapter 8 of the Government Accounting Manual for NGAs, Volume I provides that tangible items below the capitalization threshold of ₱15,000.00 shall be accounted as semi-expendable property. The following policies apply as follows: 



a)	Semi-expendable property which were recognized as PPE shall be reclassified to the affected accounts. 



b)	These tangible items shall be recognized as expenses upon issue to the end-user. 



	2)	Further, Chapter 3 of the Government Accounting Manual for NGAs, Volume II defines the following inventory accounts as follows: 



Account Title

Description

Semi-expendable Information and Communications Technology Equipment

This account is used to recognize the cost/fair value of the purchased/acquired information and communications technology equipment, which includes laptops, printers, scanners, and the like, costing less than ₱15,000.00 for the use in government operations. Credit this account for issuance, transfers, loss or other disposal. 

Semi-expendable Office Equipment

This account is used to recognize the cost/fair value of the purchased/acquire office equipment costing less than ₱15,000.00 for the use in government operations. Credit this account for issues, transfers, losses or other modes of disposal.

Semi-expendable Furniture and Fixtures

This account is used to recognize the cost/fair value of the purchased/acquired furniture and fixtures costing less than ₱15,000.00 for the use in the government operations. Credit this account for issuance, transfer, loss or other disposal and adjustments. 



	3)	During the calendar year 2020, the agency purchased items of office equipment, information and communication technology equipment and furniture and fixtures totaling ₱1,229,749.00 which falls under the recognition criteria of semi-expendable property. The Accounting Unit recorded these items as part of office supplies and other supplies and materials inventory account upon purchase instead of using the appropriate semi-expendable inventory account then subsequently adjust them to the corresponding expense account upon issuance. 



	4)	The practice resulted in overstatement of office supplies and other supplies and materials expenses accounts and understatement of semi-expendable furniture and fixtures expense and semi-expendable machinery and equipment expense accounts. Although expense accounts will be subsequently closed to Accumulated Surplus/Deficit, these items should be properly classified and recorded because failure to do so will result in misstatements of specific accounts in the agency’s Financial Statements.

	5)	We recommended and Management agreed to properly classify items of inventory account for accurate account balances in the financial statements at any given period. 



3)	Lack of monitoring of fund transfers from other National Government Agencies resulted in unliquidated funds of prior years amounting to ₱792,401.88; contrary to COA Circular Nos. 94-013 and 2016-005.



	1)	Section 6.7 of COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994 on the Rules and Regulation in the Grant, Utilization and Liquidation of Funds Transferred to Implementing Agencies, states among others, that the implementing agency (IA) shall return to the source agency any unused balance and refund of disallowance upon completion of the project.



	2)	Verification of the Due to NGAs account as of December 31, 2020 disclosed that the agency has a prior years’ unliquidated fund without identified project amounting to ₱792,401.88.



	3)	One requirement of COA Circular No. 94-013 is the keeping of subsidiary records for each trust liability whether or not a separate bank account is maintained. This is to facilitate efficient monitoring of all funds transferred to the agency. 



	4)	The College Accountant informed the audit team that they will do reconciliation of records and will trace the origin of the unliquidated funds of prior years. With the limitations brought by the pandemic followed by transfer of the two (2) staff and maternity leave of another staff, the Accounting Office was undermanned making it impossible to finish their reconciliation. 



	5)	Due to lack of monitoring of fund transfers, the amount of ₱792,401.88 was not returned to the source agencies and remained idle in the account of the College. 



	6)	We recommended and Management agreed that the Accounting Unit reconcile their records and immediately return the balance of fund transfers to source agencies pursuant to Section 6.7 of COA Circular No. 94-013.



4)	Advances for Petty Cash Fund amounting to ₱25,508.00 was not liquidated for a long period of time contrary to Section 1.2 of COA Circular 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012. 



	1)	Section 1.2 of COA Circular 2012-001 states that: The accountable officer shall liquidate cash advances within the following period: 



--	Petty Cash Fund (PCF) – as soon as the disbursement reaches 75 percent or as needed, the PCF shall be replenished which shall be equal to the total amount of expenditures made therefrom. In case of termination, resignation, retirement, or dismissal of the PCF Custodian, immediately thereafter. 



	2)	As of December 31, 2020, one (1) Petty Cash Custodian has not fully liquidated the fund in her custody amounting to ₱25,508.00. Non-liquidation of the Petty Cash Fund has the effect of overstating the cash account of the agency, in case the CA had already been utilized.



	3)	We recommended that the Accountant demand from the Accountable Officer the immediate liquidation of the Cash Advance.



	4)	The Accountant informed that she gave reminders to liquidate throughout the year, however, no liquidation report has been submitted to her office until the end of the year. She promised to follow-up with the accountable officer after the exit conference. 



5)	Advance payments of ₱4,520,384.58 were not recouped from the contractors whose projects were rescinded/terminated, contrary to paragraph 4.3 of Annex E of the Revised IRR of RA 9184, which poses the risk of wasting government funds. 



	1)	 Paragraph 4.3 of Annex E of the Revised IRR of RA 9184 provides that “The advance payment shall be repaid by the contractor by deducting fifteen percent (15%) from his periodic progress payments a percentage equal to the percentage of the total contract price used for the advance payment.”



	2)	Review of the Advances to Contractors account revealed that the agency failed to collect the advance payments on rescinded or terminated contracts amounting to ₱4,520,384.58.

	3)	The construction of the project “Continuation of MPB” awarded to KCN Construction was stopped to implement the Technical Audit Specialist’s recommendation on the noted defects. However, these remained uncorrected for over a year, thus, the possibility that the contractor will no longer correct the defects.



	4)	The project “Continuation of Payanan R&D Phase I and Production Facilities Phase III” previously awarded to RMG Builders was terminated, reprogrammed and awarded to RVJ Construction. The project “Construction of R&D Building – Conner” was also terminated, reprogrammed and awarded to OCP Construction.



	5)	The Management could have required the immediate return of the balance of the advance payments upon contract termination, or could have caused the forfeiture of the surety bonds posted by the contractors. Enforcement of the claim against bonds posted is necessary to recover the loss from such contracts. 



	6)	We recommended and Management agreed that steps will be taken for the immediate return of the unrecouped advances or forfeit the corresponding surety bonds posted by the contractors in favor of the government. We further recommended that the agency officials concerned be required to strictly comply with the provisions of existing issuances regarding the recoupment of advance payments made to the contractors. 



Management Comment



	7)	For KCN Construction amounting to ₱196,957.65 - A collection notice would be prepared to collect from the contractor. In case the contractor refuse, the cash advance would be recouped from his guaranty deposit from previous completed project “Construction/ Repair/ Rehab of Academic Building (Luna)” amounting to ₱126,712.28 and the remaining amount would be collected from them.

 

	8)	RMG Builders’ cash advance amounting to ₱1,444,030.86 was partially recouped from their accomplishment of the terminated project equivalent to 8.19%, or ₱788,408.64. A JEV debiting CIP-School Building and crediting Advances to contractors for the said amount was drawn on March 11, 2021. For the difference of ₱655,622.22, the contractor would be notified that it will be deducted from the guaranty deposit of his completed project “Construction of Payanan R&D Center Phase I” and “Food Production Facility Phase II”, amounting to ₱958,424.96. A JEV would be prepared to effect the adjustment after notification to the contractor.

 

	9)	IBDC’s cash advance amounting to ₱2,879,396.07 - This would be recouped by drawing a JEV recognizing the value of his work accomplishment from the terminated project, which was equivalent to the amount of cash advance or 15%. Copy of the SWA was requested from the infrastructure unit.



Auditor’s Rejoinder



	10)	The JEV to be drawn should be supported with the needed supporting documents to prove the reliability of the entry drawn and also to facilitate technical inspection (ex. pictures of the completed projects, inspection report by the Inspectorate Team, acceptance by the head of the agency, computations, and all other documents necessary to establish the reliability of the value of work done as presented in the Statement of Work Accomplished.) 



	11)	During the exit conference, the Accountant requested the Director of Infrastructure and Development to furnish her office with the documents to support the JEV drawn and to be drawn by her office. 



6)	The overdue loans granted to the students of Apayao State College under the CHED-Student Financial Assistance Program (StuFAP) and Student Assistance Fund for Education (SAFE) amounting to ₱1,726,136.50 remained uncollected due to Management’s failure to compel and impose sanctions against the defaulting student-borrowers, depriving the government and students of the benefits from the use of the fund had it been collected. 



	1)	Among the programs of the CHED are the StuFAP and SAFE, both aimed to broaden the access of deserving and qualified students to higher education, which is intended to contribute to the long-term objectives of enhancing the nation’s human capital, competitiveness and economic development. 

	

	2)	CHED Memorandum Circular Order (CMO) No. 4 series of 2004, which specifies the guidelines for the implementation of the StuFAP, provided the following: 



a)		Qualified borrowers may be allowed to borrow a maximum amount of ₱8,000.00 per semester covering the following benefits: school fees, course projects, board and lodging. They shall not be charged any interest on their loan fund and payable on the following terms: 

	

--		Loans below ₱4,000.00 are payable within five years.

--		Loans above ₱4,000.00 are payable in 10 years. 

	

b)		The student borrower’s parents (either father or mother), any relatives or persons he or she may present, shall sign the loan agreement, together with the students. 

	

c)		The loan borrower shall pay the amount borrowed within the amortization period and shall notify the school within 30 days for any changes on the following: 



--		Change of permanent address

--		Commencement of employment

--		Transfer of change of employment; and

--		Change of civil status

	

	3)	Meanwhile, SAFE Loan Program was designed to cater to financial to needy students who are in their 3rd, 4th, 5th or graduating year of study. 

	

	4)	CHED Memorandum Order No. 25 s.2008 provides the guidelines for the implementation of the Student Assistance Fund for Education (SAFE) Loan, which includes: 

	

a)		Qualified loan grantees can borrow as much as eight thousand pesos (₱8,000.00), depending on individual circumstance and requirements. 

	

b)		The grantee shall: 



--		Carry a full semestral load as prescribed in the curriculum, and furnish the same within the normal duration of the program; and 

--		Notify the school within 30 days from occurrence about any change of permanent address, status or married name. 

	

c)		Participating Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) shall perform the following: 

	

--		Shall establish Student Financial Assistance (SFA) Unit to manage the disbursements of the program to undertake operations internal to the private HEI, with the option to utilize its existing unit equivalent to SFA Unit for this purpose; 

--		Treat the Fund transferred from the CHED Regional Office as Revolving Fund to expand the number of beneficiaries of the SAFE Loan Program; 

--		Xxx

--		Xxx

--		Draw corresponding duly notarized promissory note for repayment within 2 to 5 years after graduation, duly signed by the student borrower when grant of loan is awarded; 

--		Maintain separate accounting records for the program that will be subjected to periodic monitoring by CHED and/or COA Audit Teams; 

--		Xxx

--		Assist CHEDRO to monitor or track the whereabouts of the scholars after graduation in order that the latter properly comply with their obligation to refund the loan at the intended period of repayment. 

	

	5)	With regard to the school’s policy on the repayment of loan, the audit team requested for copies of Loan Agreements, however, we were informed that they could not readily produce the documents. The original program coordinators were no longer connected with the agency and there was also no proper turnover of documents. According to the Accounting Unit, they have their copies of the Loan Agreements before, however, these were given to the program coordinators when it was once requested to them, but was not returned. 



	6)	Analysis of the Loans Receivable account revealed that the agency was able to collect ₱36,500.00 from the total loans which were outstanding for 10 years or more. This signify failure to compel and impose sanctions against the defaulting student-borrowers, hence, depriving the government and students of the benefits from the use of the funds had it been collected.

	7)	We were informed from our prior inquiries that collecting from student-borrowers was difficult since most of them could no longer be located. The minimal collections were from prior years’ outstanding accounts of borrowers thru social media, or from those who were securing school credentials. 

	

	8)	We recommended and Management agreed to: 



		1)		  require the Accountant to conduct a thorough review and evaluation of the account; after which, exhaust all possible measures of collection which includes the issuance of demand letters, not only to the student-borrowers, but also to the guarantors indicated in the MOA/contract.



		2)		  request for write-off of dormant accounts, following strictly the procedures under COA Circular No. 2016-005. 



	9)	During the exit conference, the Accountant recommended the re-installation of the Students’ Financial Assistance Committee which shall oversee the scholarships and subsidies granted to the students of the College. The College President informed that SFA is already incorporated in the Students’ Services Department. 



	10)	 The Accountant also informed that they were able to locate some loan agreements and were able to identify the employee-guarantors of some loans. 



	11)	 After all measures to collect have been exhausted, they will prepare the documents for the request for write-off with the Commission. 



7)	Insurance proceeds and excess amounts from proceeds from sale of bid documents amounting to ₱1,054,308.69, were not remitted to the Treasury contrary to regulations; hence, needed funds by the National Government for implementation of its programs and projects remained idle with the College. 



	1)	Section 6 of the General Provisions of GAA 2020 provides: 



“The following shall be deposited with the National Treasury and recorded as trust receipts in accordance with E.O. No. 338, s. 1996, as implemented by COA-DBM-DOF J.C. No. 1-07 dated January 2, 1997, and such other guidelines issued thereon: 



a)	Receipts collected or received by departments, bureaus, offices, and instrumentalities, including Constitutional Offices enjoying fiscal autonomy and SUCs: (i) from non-tax sources, such as insurance proceeds, acting as trustee, agent or administrator, (ii) as guaranty for the fulfillment of an obligation, or (iii) from donations authorized by law or contract with a term not exceeding one (1) year; and 



b)	Those classified by law or regulations as trust receipts. 



Trust receipts shall be disbursed in accordance with the purpose for which it is created, subject to applicable provisions and accounting and auditing rules and regulations. 



	2)	Section 4 of Chapter 5 of the Government Accounting Manual for NGAs, Volume I requires that receipt shall be recorded as revenue of the Special, Fiduciary or Trust Funds (TF) or Funds other than the GF, only when authorized by law and following such rules and regulations as may be issued by the Permanent Committee consisting of the Secretary of Finance as Chairman, and the Secretary of the Budget and the Chairman, Commission on Audit, as members. 



	3)	Further, Item 6.2 of Budget Circular No. 2004-5A provides that any excess in the amount collected from sale of bid documents, fees from contractors/suppliers registry, fees charged for copies of minutes of bid openings, BAC resolutions and other BAC documents protest fees, liquidated damages and proceeds from bid/performance security forfeiture shall be remitted to the Bureau of Treasury. 



	4)	Review of the agency’s transactions and accounts revealed that the amount of ₱1,054,308.69 from the Internally Generated Fund and Special Trust Fund represented unremitted insurance proceeds and unutilized portion of the proceeds from sale of bid documents. The insurance proceeds were recorded by the Accounting Unit as Miscellaneous Income, while receipts from sale of bid documents were recognized as liability under the Other Payables account.

	5)	The practice of not remitting to the Bureau of Treasury is not supportive of the directives of the government discouraging dormant funds to ease the fiscal pressures and to facilitate the implementation of its programs and projects. 



	6)	We recommended to Management and they agreed to remit immediately to the Bureau of Treasury the insurance proceeds from GSIS and the unutilized portion of the proceeds from sale of bid documents. 



	7)	However, ₱342,044.76 will be retained to pay for the refund of cancelled bids and unpaid BAC honoraria of prior year. The disbursement vouchers were already prepared and will be remitted as soon as the said DVs were approved.



8)	Of the total allotments received of ₱166,134,672.00 for CY 2020, ₱158,858,695.53 or 95.60% was obligated; however, only ₱108,361,542.08 or 65.20% thereof was disbursed, mainly due to delayed/non-implementation of four (4) infrastructure projects, contrary to Section 70 of the General Appropriations Act of 2020. 



	1)	Section 70 of the General Appropriations Act of 2020 states that “as a general rule, departments, bureaus and offices of the National Government, including Constitutional Offices enjoying fiscal autonomy and SUCs shall spend what is programmed in their respective appropriations xxx.”



	2)	Review of the College’s appropriations, allotments and obligations for CY 2020 disclosed that, out of the total allotments received in the aggregate amount of ₱166,134,672.00, only ₱158,858,685.53 was obligated, leaving an unobligated amount of ₱7,275,976.47, and was only able to disburse ₱108,361,542.08.



	3)	It can be gleaned that, although the agency has a high obligation rate over allotments received, the low disbursement rate indicated that Management was not able to effectively manage the amount of funds entrusted to the agency. 



	4)	The low disbursement rate in CY 2020 was mainly attributed to the delayed implementation of three (3) projects and non-implementation of one (1) project.

	5)	To expedite the implementation of projects, the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) issued guidelines authorizing agencies to start undertaking the initial processes of their procurement activities based on the proposed budget levels per National Expenditure Program (NEP), pending the approval of the General Appropriations Act (GAA) and/or receipt of the allotments (obligatory authority) issued by DBM. 



	6)	Early Procurement Activities shall refer to the conduct of procurement activities, from posting of the procurement opportunity, if required, until recommendation of the Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) to the HoPE as to the award of the contract, for goods to be delivered, infrastructure projects to be implemented and consulting services to be rendered in the following fiscal year, pending approval of their respective funding sources. 



	7)	Despite the authority to conduct early procurement activities, the agency only started the procurement process in the first quarter of 2020. The agency was able to issue the Notices to Proceed for three (3) projects in the third quarter and only in the fourth quarter for one (1) project. In addition, the contractor for the project “Completion of ICT Building Phase IV” could not immediately commence construction due to the delay in the completion of Phase IIIa of the same infrastructure project.



	8)	This deprived the students and employees of the College of the immediate access to better infrastructure.





	9)	 We recommended and Management agreed to:



		1)		  maximize the use of allotments received by ensuring prompt initiation of the procurement process and timely implementation of programs and projects so as to minimize the incurrence of unobligated allotments. 



		2)		   supervise and monitor the implementation of programs and projects making sure that the same are within the approved timelines.  



	10)	The Management informed the audit team that the delay and non-implementation of projects was due to the restrictions brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Infrastructure and Development Office had also acquired additional manpower to properly supervise and monitor the implementation of programs and projects of the agency so as to avoid delay in the implementation of projects. 



9)	The agency did not deduct 80 days of unauthorized leave of absence incurred by regular and casual employees for the period from January 2020 to December 2020, in violation of Rule XVI Section 50 of the Omnibus Rules implementing Book V of EO 292; resulting in over payment of salaries and benefits amounting to ₱116,461.92. 



	1)	 Rule XVI, Section 50 of the Omnibus Rules implementing Book V of EO 292 provides: 



Sec. 50. Effect of unauthorized leave - An official/employee who is absent without approved leave shall not be entitled to receive his salary corresponding to the period of his unauthorized leave of absence. It is understood, however that his absence shall no longer be deducted from his accumulated leave credits, if there are any.



	2)	During the post-audit of the payment of salaries of regular and casual employees of the College for the CY 2020, it was found out that several regular and casual employees incurred a total of 80 days of unauthorized leave of absence for the period from January 2020 to December 2020. 



	3)	Inquiry made from the Human Resource (HR) Department, who is in-charge in the consolidation of monthly DTR, together with the supporting documents and preparation of monthly payroll, disclosed that paid unauthorized leave occurred because the staff in-charge in the screening of documents needed for payroll preparation was not able to check the completeness of every document submitted. Late submission of DTR of some employees was also seen as one cause wherein some DTRs were submitted only after the payroll was prepared.



	4)	The above practice resulted in the over payment of salaries, GSIS, and PHILHEALTH amounting ₱103,446.46, and ₱13,015.46 respectively, for the Calendar Year 2020. 



	5)	We recommended that Management:



		1)			 strictly monitor, check the completeness of filed application for leave and enforce the provision regarding unauthorized leave of absence;

	

		2)			cause the employees who received salary for unauthorized leave of absence to return the amount they received erroneously.

	

	6)	The following were the corrective actions presented by the HRMU on the noted deficiencies: 



a)	employees concerned submitted their approved Form 6 and other documents supporting the non-entries in the DTRs which were claimed to have been inadvertently not attached to the DTRs; 



b)	employees concerned consented to payback ₱74,414.59 in succeeding monthly salaries; 



c)	corrected DTRs indicating they are on WFH arrangements;

 

(d)  submitted justifications on the non-entries in the logbook. 



Auditor’s Rejoinder



	7)	Based on the submitted documents, the audit team had the following rejoinders: 



a)	the missing logbook for reference could not be accepted as a justification for not returning the overpaid salary by one (1) employee; 



b)	the Form 6 of one (1) employee was disapproved by the College President; 



c)	December 26 as the start of Christmas vacation was used by one employee to justify his absence on December 23; 



d)	work suspension for Typhoon Ulysses was November 11-13, 2020. November 16, 2020 was not included in the suspension;



e)	submitted Travel Order did not coincide with the date of travel; and



f)	December 8 and not December 21 was Immaculate Conception Day



	8)	During the exit conference, the College President informed the audit team that she already gave an order that applications for leave not filed within the prescribed period will not be approved. It will automatically be considered as unauthorized leave and subject for deduction. 



	9)	As for the WFH accomplishments, we were informed that the President has an order that WFH outputs, such as modules and instructional materials, shall be kept at the level of the Deans, and be made available at all times for verification. 



	10)	The Accountant also asked the HR Unit that they should ensure the completeness of the supporting documents of the payroll before submitting to their office for processing to avoid committing similar lapses in the future. 



	11)	In addition, the College President ordered the HRMO and Accounting Unit to fully deduct the overpayments in the March 2021 payroll as installment payments would only require another monitoring for the units concerned.  



10)	Fifty-five (55) application for leave of casual and regular employees for the period from January 2020 to December 2020, have been processed and paid without accomplishing Box 7.A (Certification of Leave Credits) of CSC Form No. 6 - Application for Leave Form; resulting in overstated leave credit balances of employees at the end of the year.

	2)	Contrary to the above provision, post audit of the supporting documents in the payment of salaries to casual and regular employees revealed that fifty-five (55) application for leave have been processed and paid for the period from January 2020 to December 2020 without accomplishing the box 7.A of the said application for leave summarized as follows:

	3)	Inquiry made to the Human Resource (HR) department who is in-charge in accomplishing and certifying Box No. 7.A disclosed that these kind of application for leave did not go through them for certification during the time of filing. They only found out and adjusted the leave credits of the concerned employees when the audit team asked and showed a case of such application for leave.



	4)	Although thirty (30) of the fifty-five (55) cases has been adjusted in the employees leave ledgers at year-end, such practice should not be allowed as it is against the established standard operating procedures and it will cause the overstatement of employees leave credits. It will also entitle an employee with no available leave credit with a paid leave of absence.

	

	5)	We recommended and Management agreed that the HR Unit deduct from employees leave credits the twenty-five (25) application for leave not yet adjusted at year-end. 



	6)	As of the date of exit conference, the HR Unit already adjusted 18 days from the noted leaves of various employees and will continue to reconcile their records for the remaining balance of unadjusted leave of absences noted in audit. 



	7)	The audit team reiterated and it was agreed by the College President that leave balances should be properly and regularly monitored by the units concerned as this may pose the risk of possibly approving benefits to employees who are not qualified to certain benefits (ex. approving monetization requests of employees with no available leave credits). 



11)	One (1) Accountable Officer was not bonded; thus, not fully insured for the faithful performance of all duties imposed upon her by law, contrary to Section 101 (2) Chapter 5 of P.D. 1445 and Section 4.1 of Treasury Circular No. 02-2009. 



	1)	Section 101 (2), Chapter 5 of P.D. No. 1445 states: “Every accountable officer shall be properly bonded in accordance with law. 



	2)	Likewise, Section 4.1 of Treasury Circular No. 02-009 dated August 6, 2009 provides, “Every officer, agent, and employee of the government of the Philippines or xxx, regardless of the status of their appointment shall, whenever the nature of the duties performed by such officer, agent or employee permits or requires the possession, custody or control of funds or properties for which he is accountable, be deemed a bondable officer and shall be bonded or bondable and his fidelity insured.”



	3)	During the cash examination, we have noted that the College Board Secretary who made cash advances for the expenses of the Board of Trustees during regular and special board meetings, was not bonded. 



	4)	Upon inquiry, the Accountable Officer informed the Audit Team that she did not apply for a fidelity bond because she thought that the nature of her work did not require it.



	5)	We recommended and Management agreed to require every Accountable Officer of the College to be bonded. 



	6)	During the exit conference, the Chief Administrative Officer informed the audit team that the Accountable Officer already applied for bond awaiting approval of Bureau of Treasury.  



Compliance with withholding and remittance of mandatory contributions



12)	For CY 2020, the agency had duly withheld the mandatory deductions and remitted to GSIS, a total amount of ₱11,948,027.94, to the PHIC, a total amount of ₱1,332,178.04, and to the HDMF, a total amount of ₱2,668,282.73, however, the agency failed to remit compulsory contributions due to GSIS, PHILHEALTH and HDMF totaling ₱40,018.57 within the prescribed period. Of the amount, ₱8,119.61 pertained to prior years’ under-remittance due to increase in employees’ salaries which was not communicated to said agencies. 



	1)	 Section 46 of the General Appropriations Act of 2020 provides:



Remittance of Compulsory Contributions. The government and employee shares in the compulsory contributions to the Employees’ Compensation Commission, PHILHEALTH, GSIS and HDMF pursuant to P.D. No. 626, as amended, R.A. No. 6111, R.A. No. 7875, as amended, R.A. 8291, and R.A. No. 9679, respectively shall be remitted directly by departments, bureaus and offices of the National Government, including Constitutional Offices enjoying fiscal autonomy and SUCs to the respective recipient agencies unless a different arrangement is agreed upon in writing between the DBM and the recipient agency.

 

	2)	 Further, the following provisions prescribes the due date of remittance of compulsory contributions to GSIS, PHILHEALTH and HDMF as follows:



Government Provision

Particulars

Section 6 (b) of RA 8291

Each employer shall remit directly to the GSIS the employees’ and employers’ contributions within the first ten (10) days of the calendar month following the month to which the contributions apply. The remittance by the employer of the contributions to the GSIS shall take priority over and above the payment of any and all obligations, except salaries and wages of its employees.

Section 20 Paragraph b of Title III Rule III of the Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations of the National Health Insurance Act of 1995 (Republic Act 7875 as a111ended by Republic Act 9241)

The monthly premium contribution of employed members shall be remitted by the employer on or before the tenth (10'") calendar day of the month following the applicable month for which the payment is due and applicable"

Section 3 (a) Rule VII of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of R.A. No. 9679

All employers shall remit to the Fund their contributions and the contributions of their covered employees as well as the latter’s loan amortizations or payments to the Fund, as provided for under Section 2 of this Rule, when applicable, within fifteen (15) days from the date the same were collected unless another period is previously agreed upon between the employer and the Fund, or within such periods as the Fund may prescribe otherwise. The Fund may prescribe a different remittance schedule for Filipinos employed by foreign based employers depending on the nature of their contracts or manner of their deployment abroad.



	3)	Audit of the Due to GSIS, Due to PHILHEALTH and Due to PAG-IBIG accounts as of December 31, 2020 revealed that ₱40,018.57 of the total balance represents past due accounts which were not remitted to GSIS, PHILHEALTH and HDMF within the prescribed period. Further verification also showed, that P8,119.61 of the total amount were balances from prior years, summarized as follows:

 ₱8,119.61 



	4)	Upon inquiry, the Audit Team was informed that portion of the unremitted GSIS contributions was due to under-remittance, meaning, GSIS contributions withheld was greater than the contributions remitted. This occurred because the GSIS eBilling and Collection System (eBCS) did not accept increase in remittance, resulting from salary increase when this has not yet been updated in their System.





	5)	   We recommended that Management:



		1)				strictly comply in remittance of compulsory contributions within the prescribed period as provided by the mandated provisions; and

	

		2)				regularly update GSIS when there are changes in salary of employees in order to avoid under-remittance of contributions.



Management Comment



	6)	One of the reasons for the unremitted GSIS premiums was caused by technical problems with records that are not reconciled with the GSIS. Some were already remitted on March 2021 and the unremitted loan payment was refunded to the employee because her consoloan has already been fully settled.  The other items were still being reconciled by the payroll officer to determine the appropriate action to be done. 



	7)	Remittance vouchers of the unremitted PHIC premiums for the month of December was already being processed, while they still need to determine that payee of the March 2020 with unremitted premium from the casual payroll of Luna Campus. 



	8)	The prior year unremitted balances of HDMF representing loan payment were corrected by refunding the amount withheld to the concerned employees, while the unremitted premiums were reconciled with the payroll unit and the remittance list was already prepared. 



	9)	The attention of concerned officials was called to avoid occurrence of the same mistake in the future. It was also noted that payroll preparation was manually done, and although it was not a valid reason to commit mistake, manual operation sometimes led to occurrence of errors, like the computation of correct premiums. Purchase of a payroll system is considered by Management to become more efficient. Also, an internal policy of adjusting salaries of employees is taken into account to avoid unreconciled items, like adjustment of salaries due to step increment will only be recognized in the payroll after the GSIS record of the employee has been adjusted. 



Compliance with Tax Laws



13)	The agency did not strictly require the registration and tax compliance requirements of individuals hired under job order, or contract of service agreement, which resulted in the foregone government revenue amounting to ₱505,471.51 representing the unpaid Annual Registration Fee of ₱89,000.00 and unwithheld percentage tax amounting to ₱416,471.51, contrary to Items A.2 and A.10 of Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 51-2018 dated June 8, 2018.



	1)	Item A of the Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 51-2018 provides the registration and compliance requirements of Professionals and Other Supplier of Services Hired under a Contract of Service or Job Order deriving gross receipts of ₱250,000.00 and below in any 12-month period from a Lone Payor and with no other source of income.

 

	2)	 Item A.2 of the same circular requires the payment of Annual Registration Fee of ₱500.00. 



	3)	Item A. 10 provides:



a)	If opted to avail of the Graduated Income Tax Rates under Section 24(A)(2)(a) of the Tax Code, as amended – subject to withholding of three (3%) percentage tax under Section 5.116(A)(1) of the Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 2-98, as amended; and 



b)	Exempted from filing and payment of percentage tax and/or withholding of percentage tax if qualified and opted to avail of the 8% income tax rate and submits and Income Payee’s Sworn Declaration of his/her gross receipts/sales (Annex “A1) to the lone income payor/withholding agent, together with a copy of duly received BIR Form No. 1901 or copy of BIR Form No. 0605 – Annual Registration Fee payment, in lieu of the Certificate of Registration, (COR). 



	4)	Perusal of the registration and tax requirements submitted by the Accounting Office, revealed that only 74 out of the 237 hired under job order and contract of service have submitted Income Payee’s Sworn Declaration of Gross Receipts/Sales.

	5)	The audit team also noted that only 59 out of the 237 contracted individuals have paid the Annual Registration Fee of ₱500.00, equivalent to uncollected Annual Registration Fee of ₱89,000.00. 



	6)	Post audit of transactions revealed that the Accounting Unit failed to withhold the 3% percentage tax on individuals who (a) opted for the Graduated Income Tax Rate, (b) did not choose from the options or (c) did not submit registration and tax compliance requirements. As a result, the revenue which could have been generated by the government for the implementation of its programs and projects were not collected. 



	7)	For the period CY 2020, the agency had a total disbursement of ₱19,498,751.16 for the payment of services rendered by the hired job order and contract of service wherein ₱416,471.51 three (3) percent percentage tax was not withheld.  



	8)	We recommended that the Accounting Unit strictly impose the registration requirements and withhold the taxes required from the hired job orders and contract of services in support to the tax collection effort of the government.

	

	9)	In its comment, the agency informed that the College Accountant conducted an orientation to COS/JOs of the College regarding the provisions of Revenue Memorandum Circular 51-2018 dated June 8, 2018, however, some COS/JOs still have not complied with the said Revenue Memorandum Circular. 



	10)	The Office of the Chief Administrative Officer also issued a Memorandum Order regarding the matter to reiterate the submission of the 2021 Income Payee’s Sworn Declaration of Gross Receipts/Sales together with a copy of duly received BIR Form 1901 or Copy of BIR For 0605 for the Annual Registration Fee payment, in lieu of the Certificate of Registration (COR). 



	11)	Management further gave its commitment to continuously support the tax collection effort of the government. 

	

14)	The agency had duly withheld from suppliers, contractors and employees  and remitted to the BIR a total amount of ₱9,629,293.80, however, withholding taxes from government money payments to various supplier of goods and services amounting ₱6,581.79 was not remitted to the Bureau of Internal Revenue, within the prescribed period, contrary to Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 23-2007, thereby, depriving the national government the timely collection of revenues needed for the implementation of its programs and projects. 



	1)	 Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 23-2007 provides that the following forms shall be prepared by the person in-charge of withholding in each government agency: 



a)			BIR Form 1600 (Monthly Remittance Return of VAT and other Percentage Taxes Withheld) - to be filed on or before the 10th day of the month following the month in which the withholding was made;



b)			BIR Form 1601-E (Monthly Remittance Return of Creditable Income Taxes Withheld-Expanded) - to be filed on or before the 10th day of the month following the month in which the withholding was made except for tax returns covering transactions in December which shall be filed on or before January 15 of the succeeding year. Filers under the Electronic Filing and Payment System (EFPS) of the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) are governed by the EFPS rules on filing of tax returns and payment of taxes.



	2)	Contrary to the above provision, audit of the December 31, 2020 balance of the agency’s Due to BIR account revealed that ₱6,581.79 of the total balance represents VAT and EWT withholding taxes withheld from various supplier of goods and services during the calendar year 2020 which were not remitted within the prescribed period. 



	3)	The delay in remittance or non-remittance of taxes withheld deprived the national government of timely collection of revenues on taxes, thus hinder the implementation of government programs/projects.



	4)	Likewise, failure of the withholding agent to perform the obligations imposed upon her makes her liable for not remitting on prescribed period. 



	5)	We recommended that Management strictly comply with the prescribed period of remittance of withholding taxes as provided by regulations. 

	

	6)	The Management acknowledged its shortcomings in the full compliance of tax laws. 



	7)	The unremitted taxes were incorporated in the 1st quarter 2021 tax remittances. The tax withheld from RRM Plants Nursery was not remitted in December 2020 because the Accounting Unit planned to refund it to the payee considering that the items purchased from them are agricultural products which are exempt from withholding taxes, however, it was also remitted since the supplier did not demand for a refund. As for the other payees, the agency admitted to have overlooked them, and thus, immediately included in their succeeding remittances. 



	Gender and Development



15)	For Calendar Year 2020, the agency had a total appropriation of ₱166,134,672.00, of which ₱41,223,105.00 was budgeted for the implementation of its GAD Activities. This was reviewed and endorsed through the GMMS by the Philippine Commission on Women on February 12, 2020. Due to the restrictions brought about by the COVID 19 pandemic, the agency was only able to disburse ₱13,242,695.48 from the budgeted amount. 



For CY 2020, the agency set up a child-minding center to provide employees with young children and women with lactating children with private, clean and well-ventilated facility for child care lactation. Employees also attended webinars on GAD related meetings, assembly, symposium, trainings and conferences. 



To facilitate the mainstreaming of GAD in ASC, it hired one (1) IT expert for GMMS and other IT related works and two (2) GAD researchers and staff. Two (2) employees were also designated as GAD Office Director and GAD Focal Point Person in Conner Campus. 



GAD Concerns were also incorporated in the discussions during Academic Council meetings to mainstream GAD in the work and financial plans of the deparments/units. 

 

In addition, the agency also gave equal opportunities to women in their employees’ development programs like scholarships, attendance to conventions and trainings, and completion of the faculties’ graduate studies. 



Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges



16)	Disallowances and suspensions amounting to ₱2,955,073.36 and ₱442,108.25 respectively, remained unsettled as of year-end.
